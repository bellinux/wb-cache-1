5|$|Carson rose {{within the}} Fish and Wildlife Service, by 1945 supervising a small writing staff and in 1949 {{becoming}} chief editor of publications. Though her position provided increasing opportunities for fieldwork and freedom in choosing her writing projects, it also entailed increasingly tedious administrative responsibilities. By 1948, Carson {{was working on}} material for a second book, and had made the <b>conscious</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> begin a transition to writing full-time. That year, she took on a literary agent, Marie Rodell; they formed a close professional relationship that would last the rest of Carson's career.|$|E
5|$|To {{write his}} own batch of songs, Farrar looked through {{several of the}} over 3,000 {{handwritten}} lyrics that Guthrie's estate has preserved before incidentally focusing on his California period. The connection to Guthrie's Los Angeles years was accidental—Farrar simply chose lyrics that he found compelling and Nora pointed out that they came from a relatively brief period of her father's life when he lived in Los Angeles. He also made a <b>conscious</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> write instrumentation in a style more similar to Guthrie's than other tribute projects, such as The Klezmatics' klezmer-based Woody Guthrie's Happy Joyous Hanukkah and Wonder Wheel. Farrar had never listened to the Bragg and Wilco material to ensure that his songwriting would not be influenced by it.|$|E

5|$|West made a <b>conscious</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> {{abstain from}} the {{widespread}} recording practice of excessive rap albums saturated with skits and filler and instead comprised Graduation with significantly fewer tracks. He also chose {{to scale back}} on the guest appearances, limiting himself to just one single guest rap verse on the entire studio album. The stylistic divergence and desire for a leaner, more economical studio album was a creative reaction that was {{brought on by the}} alternative rock and indie-rock that West had been listening to {{around the time of the}} recording of his third studio album. West cites the rock bands The Killers, Keane, Modest Mouse, and indie-pop singer-songwriter Feist, whom he also looked towards for songwriting inspiration, for being among his favorite musicians and having considerably profound influence on the sound of Graduation. Largely due to all this and the inclusion of the layered electronic synthesizers, West believed that his record took hip-hop in a different direction. But he also acknowledged the fact that the differences did not right away and without a doubt make Graduation a good album. However, he felt it was a representation of the music he was listening to at that time.|$|E

50|$|One way {{to combat}} {{emotional}} eating is to employ mindfulness techniques. For example, approaching cravings with a nonjudgmental inquisitiveness can help differentiate between hunger and emotionally-driven cravings. An individual may ask his or herself if the craving developed rapidly, as emotional eating {{tends to be}} triggered spontaneously. An individual may also {{take the time to}} note his or her bodily sensations, such as hunger pangs, and coinciding emotions, like guilt or shame, in order <b>to</b> make <b>conscious</b> <b>decisions</b> <b>to</b> avoid emotional eating.|$|R
25|$|Poverty {{and lack}} of {{educational}} and economic opportunities in one's hometown may lead women to voluntarily migrate and then be involuntarily trafficked into sex work. As globalization opened up national borders to greater exchange of goods and capital, labor migration also increased. Less wealthy countries have fewer options for livable wages. The economic impact of globalization pushes people <b>to</b> make <b>conscious</b> <b>decisions</b> <b>to</b> migrate and be vulnerable to trafficking. Gender inequalities that hinder women from participating in the formal sector also push women into informal sectors.|$|R
25|$|In {{response}} to the demographic trend of longer lifespans and an expanding older market, and to its child-centered image, McDonald's made a <b>conscious</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> attempt to market its food to a more adult audience.

In early 1992, Loung studied at Cannes International College as part of Saint Michael's curriculum.

25|$|After the Children of God album, Gira professed himself tired {{with the}} band's fearsome {{reputation}} for noise, feeling that their audience now had expectations {{that he had}} no intention of fulfilling. He made a <b>conscious</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> tone down the band's sound, introducing more acoustic elements and increasingly emphasizing Jarboe as a singer. The first results of this shift in direction were the two records recorded by Gira and Jarboe under the names Skin (in Europe) and World of Skin (in the US). The first, Blood, Women, Roses, featured Jarboe on lead vocals, and the second, Shame, Humility, Revenge, featured Gira on lead vocals. Both were recorded together in 1987, although Shame, Humility, Revenge was not released until 1988. These albums are full of slow, ethereal, melancholy, dirge-like songs, sounding like stripped down acoustic versions of the Children of God songs.|$|E

25|$|If one accepts that Shakespeare made a <b>conscious</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> use Holinshed more {{frequently}} during his re-editing of True Tragedy, one must ask why {{he may have}} done so. True Tragedy is roughly one thousand lines shorter than 3 Henry VI, and whilst many of the differences are simple aesthetic changes and alternate phraseology (much of which is easily attributable to inaccurate reporting), one major {{difference between the two}} that runs throughout is how they each handle violence. On the whole, 3 Henry VI is far more restrained in its depiction of war, whereas True Tragedy has more explicit and sustained on-stage combat and more royal processions and celebrations after combat. Much more so than does 3 Henry VI, True Tragedy conforms to the so-called Tudor myth that the Wars of Roses were God's punishment for people straying from the path laid out for them, and His means of purging the country of evil and opening the way for the righteous Tudor dynasty to establish peace. Traditionally, this has been a common way of interpreting the entire octalogy; advocated and elaborated upon by critics as diverse as August Wilhelm Schlegel, Hermann Ulrici, Georg Gottfried Gervinus, Irving Ribner, M.M. Reese, Robert Rentoul Reed, and, most famously, E.M.W. Tillyard, with whom the phrase Tudor myth is now most associated.|$|E

500|$|The Bala Kanda of the Ramayana is the {{earliest}} text to describe Ahalya's seduction in detail. It states that Indra becomes enamoured by Ahalya's beauty, learns of her husband's absence {{and comes to}} the ashram disguised as Gautama to request sexual intercourse with her, praising her as a shapely and slim-waisted woman. She sees through his disguise, but consents owing to her [...] "curiosity". According to another interpretation, Ahalya's pride in her beauty compels her. Having satiated his lust, Ahalya requests that Indra, her [...] "lover" [...] and the [...] "best of gods", flee and protect them from Gautama's wrath. The Kathasaritsagara (11th century CE) {{is one of the}} few texts that mirror the Bala Kandas Ahalya, who makes a <b>conscious</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> accept Indra's advances.

The band blamed their record label, Creation, for the relative failure of the singles—particularly [...] "Northern Lites", which they felt [...] "could have been bigger" [...] if the label had produced a better music video and conducted a more successful marketing campaign. As a result, the group became tired of playing [...] "chart games" [...] and went on [...] "pop strike", deciding to release music just [...] "for the joy of it", with no agenda.|$|E

Curry was influenced by the real-life story of Mary Kay Letourneau, a teacher who became involved with her underage student, causing her to be convicted for rape charges. Director Rob Cohen revealed that in Curry's draft, the character of Noah was younger, but he made the <b>conscious</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> age him to 19, because he felt as if it was [...] "not healthy" [...] and that audiences would lose sympathy for the protagonist.

The contention is, however, that “individual freedom and courage to act is more valuable than collective adherence to journalistic codes of conduct.” As journalists make <b>conscious</b> <b>decisions</b> <b>to</b> write authentically, they are able to contribute more value in their work. The consequence of authentic writing is positive and ensures that the journalist, according to Merrill, “grows, matures, creates himself, and projects himself into the future.” ...|$|R
