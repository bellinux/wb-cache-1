40|$|Background. In {{design and}} {{construction}} practice, we often {{have to deal with}} complete and incomplete drainage. Complete horizontal drainages are arranged in single-layer beds or water-bearing beds of small thickness if confining bed is bu-ried at a depth of no more than 8 - 10 m. In single-layer beds of large thickness, as well as in two-layer beds drainage is incomplete. In the latter <b>case</b> <b>drain</b> cuts across the upper layer (usually low-permeable) and uncover the lower layer. Results and conclusions. The technique of selection of design parameters of a drainage facility {{in the context of the}} general problem of icing control at the stage of its formation is considered.

40|$|Graduation date: 2006 A {{discrete}} trap {{model is}} developed and employed for elucidation of thin-film transistor (TFT) device physics trends. An attractive {{feature of this}} model is that only two model parameters are required, the trap energy depth, E[subscript T], and the trap density, N[subscript T]. The most relevant trends occur when E[subscript T] is above the Fermi level. For this <b>case</b> <b>drain</b> current – drain voltage simulations indicate that the drain current decreases {{with an increase in}} N[subscript T] and E[subscript T]. The threshold voltage, V[subscript T], extracted from drain current – gate voltage (I[subscript D] – V[[subscript GS]) simulations, is found to be composed of two parts, V[subscript TRAP], the voltage required to fill all the traps and V[subscript ELECTRON], the voltage associated with electrons populating the conduction band. V[subscript T] moves toward a more positive voltage as N[subscript T] and E[subscript T] increase. The inverse subthreshold voltage swing, S, extracted from a log(I[subscript D]) – V[subscript GS] curve, increases as N[subscript T] and E[subscript T] increase.

40|$|Condition Monitoring is an {{area that}} has seen {{substantial}} growth in the last few decades. The purpose for implementing condition monitoring in industry is to increase productivity, decrease maintenance costs and increase safety. Therefore, condition monitoring can be used not only for planning maintenance but also for allowing the selection of the most efficient equipment to minimize operating costs. Hydraulic systems are widely used in industry, aerospace and agriculture and are becoming more complex in construction and in function. Reliability of the systems must be supported by an efficient maintenance scheme. Due to component wear or failure, some system parameters may change causing abnormal behaviour in each component or in the overall circuit. Research in this area has been substantial, and includes specialized studies on artificial fault simulation at the University of Saskatchewan. In this research, an axial pump was the focus of the study. In an axial piston pump, wear between the various faces of components can occur {{in many parts of the}} unit. As a consequence, leakage can occur in locations such as between the valve plate and barrel, the drive shaft and oil wiper, the control piston and piston guide, and the swash plate and slippers. In this study, wear (and hence leakage) between the pistons and cylinder bores in the barrel was of interest. Researchers at the University of Saskatchewan, as well as at other research institutions, have been involved in studies to detect wear in pumps using a variety of condition monitoring algorithms. However, to verify the reliability and indeed, limitations of some of the approaches, it is necessary to test the algorithms on systems with “real” leakage. To introduce actual wear in the piston of pumps can be very difficult and very expensive. Hence, introducing piston wear in an “artificial” manner would be of great benefit in the evaluation of various condition monitoring techniques. Since leakage is a direct consequence of piston wear, it is logical to conclude that varying the leakage in some prescribed manner can be used to artificially simulate wear. A prime concern, therefore, is to be able to precisely understand the dynamic relationships between the wear and leakage and the effect it has on the output flow or pressure waveform from the pump. Introducing an artificial leakage to simulate the wear of pistons is a complex task. The creation of an artificial leakage path was not simply a process of providing a resistive short to the tank at the outlet of the pump port as was done in other studies. The objective was to create a leakage environment that would simulate leakage from a single piston (or combination of several pistons thereof). The complexity of the flow and pressure ripple waveforms (which various condition monitoring algorithms did require) was such that a more comprehensive leakage behaviour had to be modeled and experimentally created. A pressure control servo valve with a very high frequency response was employed to divert the flow from the pump outlet with a prescribed waveform directly to the tank to simulate the piston leakage from the high pressure discharge chamber to the pump <b>case</b> <b>drain</b> chamber as the simulated worn piston made contact with the high pressure chamber. The control algorithm could mimic the action of a single worn piston at various degrees of wear. The experimental results indicated that the experimental system could successfully introduce artificial leakage into the pump which was quite consistent with a unit with a “real” worn piston. Comparisons of the pressure ripples from an actual faulty pump (worn piston) and the “artificial” faulty pump (artificial leakage) are presented...|$|E
40|$|AIM: The aim of {{this study}} is to present our {{experience}} on not using drain for thyroidectomy in a teaching hospital. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 5 years single surgeon’s clinically study in a teaching hospital conducted between July 2007 to June 2012. Age group considered was from 11 years to 70 years. Data was obtained from a pre designed profroma from the hospital records and analyzed by chi s quare and percentages. RESULTS: Indication for thyroid surgery was more in females. More cases were between 21 0 30 years. Out of 87 cases in 68 <b>cases</b> <b>drain</b> was not placed and in 19 <b>cases</b> <b>drain</b> was placed. Out of 68 <b>cases</b> in which <b>drain</b> was not placed, onl y 2 had minor post - operative complications. In almost all patients without drain were discharged within 48 hours of surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Placement of drains after routine thyroid surgery has no influence on complications. Impact it leads to an extra scar and increase the hospital stay.

40|$|Objectives/Hypothesis: Preauricular sinuses are benign {{congenital}} malformations of preauricular soft tissues. Complete excision using either sinectomy or supra-auricular approach is advised to prevent recurrence. Reported recurrence varies between 0 and 42 %. We evaluated which surgical technique resulted in lowest complication and recurrence rates. Study Design: PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science. Methods: Two authors appraised studies on directness {{of evidence and}} risk of bias. Original data were extracted and pooled when I 2 was smaller than 50 %. Results are reported according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. Results: Fourteen high directness of evidence studies were included. Reported complication rates were similar: sinectomy [0 - 31. 4 %] and supra-auricular approach (SAA) [0 - 18. 2 %]. Pooled recurrence rates showed that sinectomy resulted in significantly (P =. 04) more recurrence 5. 5 % (95 % confidence interval [CI] 3. 6 - 8. 3 %) than SAA 2. 2 % (95 % CI 0. 7 - 7. 0). Sinectomy using the microscope resulted in the lowest sinectomy recurrence rates (1. 9 %). SAA in combination with a Penrose drain resulted in 0 % recurrence in revision <b>cases.</b> <b>Drain</b> use resulted in the lowest SAA recurrence rates; however, drain application was not advised due to higher complication rates (frequent wound infection [P =. 003] and more [P =. 002] and longer [P =. 001] compression dressing use). Conclusion: SAA could be the preferable technique for preauricular sinus removal. If despite evidence, sinectomy is elected over SAA, microscope use can further decrease recurrence rates comparable to SAA levels. Level of included evidence (Ib-IV) indicates {{the need for a}} prospective study comparing surgical outcomes between techniques...|$|R
40|$|Background/Aims: Proper venous outflow {{reconstruction}} {{is essential}} for the success of living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). It has also a decisive impact on postoperative graft dysfunction. The accessory right inferior hepatic veins (IHVs) usually drain parts of the lateral sector of the right hemiliver graft (RHL). The purpose of our study was to: 1) evaluate the drainage patterns of the IHVs in right hemiliver grafts; 2) analyze the influence of IHVs on the dominance relationships between the right and middle hepatic veins in RHL's; 3) evaluate some potential correlation between drainage patterns of IHVs and the portal vein anatomy. Methodology: We analyzed 3 -dimensional CT-imaging reconstructions of 71 potential live liver donors evaluated at our Institution between January 2003 and October 2004. Results: 1) Thirty-six (51 %) donors had inferior hepatic veins (IHV) with detectable venous drainage territories, 2) the RHV/IHV-complex was dominant in 97 % of cases, and the RHV as a single vein without anatomical IHV was dominant in 94 % of right hemiliver grafts, 3) 27 of 71 livers (38 %) showed a central (n= 11) or peripheral (n= 16) PV anomaly, 4) IHV provided a mean 32 % of venous drainage in the right lateral sector, and in some <b>cases</b> <b>drained</b> up to 25 % of the right medial sector irrespective of the PV anatomy, 5) such cases required IHV reconstruction to prevent severe tissue congestion in the right hemiliver graft.

40|$|Electrical cables that {{dissipate}} spurious static electric charges, {{in addition}} to performing their main functions of conducting signals, have been developed. These cables are intended for use in trapped-ion or ionizing-radiation environments, in which electric charges tend to accumulate within, and on the surfaces of, dielectric layers of cables. If the charging rate exceeds the dissipation rate, charges can accumulate in excessive amounts, giving rise to high-current discharges that can damage electronic circuitry and/or systems connected to it. The basic idea of design and operation of charge-dissipative electrical cables is to drain spurious charges to ground by use of lossy (slightly electrically conductive) dielectric layers, possibly in conjunction with drain wires and/or drain shields (see figure). In typical <b>cases,</b> the <b>drain</b> wires and/or drain shields could be electrically grounded via the connector assemblies {{at the ends of}} the cables, in any of the conventional techniques for grounding signal conductors and signal shields. In some cases, signal shields could double as drain shields...|$|R
