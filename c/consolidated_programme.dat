40|$|The {{present study}} has been {{conducted}} by the Joint Research Centre on behalf of DG ENER with the purpose to understand the status of programmes promoting energy audits and energy management systems in the Member States of the European Union. The objectives of this report are to assess {{the extent to which}} the requirements of Article 8 of the Energy Efficiency Directive (EED) are already met and to understand the level of additional effort needed by the Member States to meet their obligations under the named article. Another objective of this report is to identify eventual barriers and make recommendations on how the goals of Article 8 can be fulfilled. This report was put together by sending a survey to different contact points in the Member States, such as members of energy agencies, governmental bodies responsible for the implementation and regulation of energy policy, energy efficiency experts, and members of the academia. There were also performed interviews with national experts and representatives of standardization bodies that gave their input in the matters of the implementation of Article 8 throughout the European Union. It was possible to gather contributions from contact points from the great majority of the Member States except from the cases of Belgium, Ireland and Luxembourg. For the cases of Belgium and Ireland, since these countries have been carrying, for many years now, <b>consolidated</b> <b>programmes</b> on the subject of energy efficiency and energy audits it was still possible to gather sufficient information to perform an evaluation on the status of their general policies. Also, during the workshop organized by the JRC on behalf of DG ENER on the implementation of Article 8 in the month of March of 2014, it was possible to contact with representatives from Member States, from the industry sector and from certification bodies that shared their view on the implementation of this article within their areas of action and expertise.

40|$|One of {{the main}} goals of the ELIXIR-EXCELERATE project from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 {{programme}} is to support a pan-European training programme to increase bioinformatics capacity and competency across ELIXIR Nodes. To this end, a Train-the-Trainer (TtT) programme has been developed by the TtT subtask of EXCELERATE’s Training Platform, to try to expose bioinformatics instructors to aspects of pedagogy and evidence-based learning principles, to help them better design, develop and deliver high-quality training in future. As a first step towards such a programme, an ELIXIR-EXCELERATE TtT (EE-TtT) pilot was developed, drawing on existing ‘instructor training’ models, using input both from experienced instructors and from experts in bioinformatics, the cognitive sciences and educational psychology. This manuscript describes the process of defining the pilot programme, illustrates its goals, structure and contents, and discusses its outcomes. From Jan 2016 to Jan 2017, we carried out seven pilot EE-TtT courses (training more than sixty new instructors), collaboratively drafted the training materials, and started establishing a network of trainers and instructors within the ELIXIR community. The EE-TtT pilot represents an essential step towards {{the development of a}} sustainable and scalable ELIXIR TtT programme.

40|$|Chile’s free-market {{economic}} and political reforms, designed and implemented under Pinochet’s military regime (1973 - 1990), have been important in discussions of neoliberal public policy and environmental governance. However, understandings {{of how and why}} these reforms unfolded often overlook the complex power dynamics involved. This paper examines the role of water in consolidating the design, implementation and outcomes of Chile’s neoliberal programme, through the contested production, retention and reform of the 1981 Water Code. Drawing on the idea that water and power are mutually constitutive, it demonstrates the significance of the transition to private tradable water rights with minimal state regulation not only for changing social relationships with water, but also for <b>consolidating</b> the neoliberal <b>programme</b> and the ambitions of the military regime, government technocrats and business conglomerates. I make three related arguments: first, that water was more central to the formation and effectiveness of the neoliberal programme in Chile, and the ambitions of its core supporters, than hitherto acknowledged; second, that political interest groups, and their alliances, can play crucial roles in neoliberalising nature; and, third, that water institutional reforms consolidate power relationships and produce waterscapes in particular ways...|$|R

The article concludes that the Lisbon Treaty and the Stockholm <b>programme</b> <b>consolidate</b> and strengthen existing trends.

40|$|Background: No {{study has}} yet {{assessed}} {{the impact of}} physicians' skills acquisition after a communication skills training programme {{on the evolution of}} patients' anxiety following a medical consultation. This study aimed to compare the impact, on patients' anxiety, of a basic communication skills training programme (BT) and the same <b>programme</b> <b>consolidated</b> by consolidation workshops (CW), and to investigate physicians' communication variables associated with patients' anxiety. Patients and methods: Physicians, after attending the BT, were randomly assigned to CW or to a waiting list. The control group was not a non-intervention group. Consultations with a cancer patient were recorded. Patients' anxiety was assessed with the State Trait Anxiety Inventory before and after a consultation. Communication skills were analysed according to the Cancer Research Campaign Workshop Evaluation Manual. Results: No statistically significant change over time and between groups was observed. Mixed-effects modelling showed that a decrease in patients' anxiety was linked with screening questions (P = 0. 045), physicians' satisfaction about support given (P = 0. 004) and with patients' distress (P < 0. 001). An increase in anxiety was linked with breaking bad news (P = 0. 050) and with supportive skills (P = 0. 013). No impact of the training programme was observed.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{potential}} benefit of silymarin (special extract from {{the fruits of}} Silybum marianum) {{in the treatment of}} liver diseases remains a controversial issue. METHODS: For this systematic review electronic databases identified 65 papers for the search terms silymarin, silibinin, silicristin or milk thistle and clinical trial. Only 19 complied with the criteria'double-' or 'single-blind'. These publications were analysed from a clinical point of view and meta-analytic calculations were performed. RESULTS: The clinical evidence ofa therapeutic effect of silymarin in toxic liver diseases is scarce. There is no evidence of a favourable influence on the evolution of viral hepatitis, particularly hepatitis C. In alcoholic liver disease, comparing with placebo, aspartate aminotransferase was reduced in the silymarin-treated groups (p = 0. 01) while alkaline phosphatase was not. In liver cirrhosis, mostly alcoholic, total mortality was 16. 1 % with silymarin vs. 20. 5 % with placebo (n. s.); liver-related mortality was 10. 0 % with silymarin vs. 17. 3 % with placebo(p = 0. 01). CONCLUSIONS: Based on the available clinical evidence it can be concluded - concerning possible risks /probable benefits - that it is reasonable to employ silymarin as a supportive element in the therapy of Amanita phalloides poisoning but also (alcoholic and grade Child 'A') liver cirrhosis.

40|$|Background: Antimicrobial {{resistance}} has led {{to widespread}} implementation of interventions for appropriate prescribing. However, such interventions are often adopted without an adequate understanding of the challenges facing doctors-in-training as key prescribers. Methods: The review followed a realist, theory-driven approach to synthesizing qualitative, quantitative and mixed-methods literature. Consistent with realist review quality standards, articles retrieved from electronic databases were systematically screened and analysed to elicit explanations of antimicrobial prescribing behaviours. These explanations were <b>consolidated</b> into a <b>programme</b> theory drawing on social science and learning theory, and shaped though input from patients and practitioners. Results: By synthesizing data from 131 articles, the review highlights the complex social and professional dynamics underlying antimicrobial prescribing decisions of doctors-in-training. The analysis shows how doctors-in-training often operate within challenging contexts (hierarchical relationships, powerful prescribing norms, unclear roles and responsibilities, implicit expectations about knowledge levels, uncertainty about application of knowledge in practice) where they prioritize particular responses (fear of criticism and individual responsibility, managing one’s reputation and position in the team, appearing competent). These complex dynamics explain how and why doctors-in-training decide to: (i) follow senior clinicians’ prescribing habits; (ii) take (or not) into account prescribing aids, advice from other health professionals or patient expectations; and (iii) ask questions or challenge decisions. This increased understanding allows for targeted tailoring, design and implementation of antimicrobial prescribing interventions. Conclusions: This review contributes {{to a better understanding}} of how antimicrobial prescribing interventions for doctors-in-training can be embedded more successfully in the hierarchical and inter-professional dynamics of different healthcare settings...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} {{the political}} economy of the financial regulation of US investment banking, which is an under-researched topic within the IPE of finance. Various academics claim investment banks – or “Wall Street” – have significant influence on regulatory decision-making as well as policy making more generally so that they can shape the outcomes to suit their preferences. As this thesis will show, the vast majority of these claims are not rooted in empirics. The dissertation examines the factors and circumstances that led to a de-regulatory outcome in the area of financial regulation of investment banking. Five case studies are analysed in this regard: the repeal of the Glass Steagall Act, which is split into three case studies given the length of the period of observation and complexity involved, the Commodity Futures Modernisation Act, which legalised the non-regulation of OTC derivatives markets in the USA, and the Securities and Exchange Commission’s alternative net capital rule regime and <b>Consolidated</b> Supervised Entities <b>Programme.</b> The author tests to what extent interest group based explanation, the role of ideas, the judiciary as well as regulators’ statutory authority played a role in arriving at deregulation. The thesis’s case studies span a period of fourty years. 	When analysing the cases, the thesis finds that investment banks’ interest groups were important in providing regulators with information, however the role of the judiciary in interpreting existing laws and thereby given them a different meaning carried as much weight in deregulatory policy outcomes as the aspect of regulators’ own regulatory amendments. Generally speaking, absent legislative change, regulators were successful in achieving their policy outcomes if they were largely aligned with the ideational consensus of the regulatory and market community and acted within their statutory authority. Regulators failed when they acted within their authority, but went against the ideational consensus of the entire regulatory and market community. The thesis shows that these episodes of de-regulation were in fact not driven by “Wall Street” and its lobbyists, but the result of complex chains of causalities in which the judiciary and regulators played major roles. ...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MBA) -University of Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2003. The {{water sector}} in South Africa {{is in the}} {{delivery}} phase of its transformation process, with transformation having commenced in 1994. This transformation is not unlike developments in this sector in other developing countries. South Africa is facing huge backlogs {{in the provision of}} basic rural water and sanitation services (DWAF, 2002 a, p. 3), typical of the scenario facing international developing countries. The SA Government has committed itself to eliminate the basic water supply backlogs by 2008, and the basic sanitation backlogs by 2010 (DWAF, 2002 b, p. ii). These targets are more ambitious than the international Millennium Development Goals of halving the world's population without adequate or safe drinking water, or access to basic sanitation by 2015 (WSSCC, 2002 a, p. l). The research investigates whether the targets set by Government are achievable in the Province of Kwazulu-Natal (KZN). The South African targets were set ahead of the completion of the Water Services Development Plans or the planning required of the Water Services Authorities (WSAs) in KZN. Although some Municipalities, in their capacity as Water Services Authority, have completed their Water Services Development Plans, others are {{still in the process of}} doing so. The deficiency in the provision of basic water and sanitation services in KZN, has been ascertained in this investigation. Also ascertained are the costs and financial resources needed to address the backlogs in service provision and the constraints to delivery of the needed services. The research findings have shown that the backlog in basic water supply in KZN is approximately 3, 66 million people, representing 38, 2 % of the KZN population, whilst the backlog in basic sanitation services is 4, 94 million persons, representing some 51, 4 % of the KZN population. In a rural context only, these figures are appreciably higher. This investigation has shown that the targets set by Government to address rural backlogs in basic services in KZN are ambitious. In terms of planned programmes at Water Services Authority level, it will take an estimated average of 12 years to eliminate the basic water supply and sanitation backlog. The earliest and longest water supply delivery programme ranges from 5 years to 20 years, whilst that for sanitation delivery, ranges from 6 years to 33 years. These programmes far exceed Government's target dates. In terms of the research findings, the backlogs in basic water services in KwaZulu-Natal will require financial resources of R 4, 87 billion to totally eradicate all basic water backlogs. Similarly, to address the basic sanitation backlog has been estimated at R 1, 44 billion. It has been recommended in this report that with relatively little additional annual funding that it will be easier to achieve the government target of 2010 (DWAF, 2002 b, p. ii) for sanitation delivery than it would for water supply. The planned level of sanitation service has been ascertained to be the VIP latrine in all cases, which does not require a water supply, and thus water and sanitation delivery programmes can be implemented separately. The investigation has revealed that there is sufficient grant funding available in South Africa to meet the planned basic water services delivery programmes of the WSAs, but their programmes exceed the target dates set by Government by many years. If the delivery programmes are accelerated to meet the Government's target dates, the current budget allocations of both DWAF and the <b>Consolidated</b> Municipal Infrastructure <b>Programme</b> (CMIP) are insufficient. In the short-term, the WSAs are not expected to have sourced donor funding to assist with their planned delivery programmes. Thus funding sources within South Africa will initially have to be relied upon. Whilst planned programmes have been developed for the alleviation of water services backlogs in KZN, it has been recommended in the report that they need to be monitored to ensure delivery of services in terms of these programmes. This monitoring and certification of the implementation of planned programmes are essential management tools, as the current planned programmes of the WSAs do not meet the Government's targets of 2008 and 2010 respectively for the elimination of the basic water and sanitation backlogs (DWAF, 2002 b,. ii). Financial budgets have been cited as being a problem area by most, but a higher priority problem appears to be the lack of institutional capacity at WSA level to ensure sustainability of projects/schemes in the post-construction phase. Should the projects/schemes not be adequately operated or maintained, it could lead to the implemented projects/schemes becoming defunct, which would negate the national initiatives aimed at backlog alleviation. It is fortunate that legislation such as the Municipal Systems Act (Act N° 32 of 2000) enables Local Government to implement a range of public and private water service provider options that can assist with the needed institutional capacity building, and to also render operations and maintenance services on a contract basis. It is evident from this investigation that a number of major obstacles may delay the achievement of either the planned delivery programmes of the WSAs, or the even greater challenges to meet the Government's targets. The successful, sustainable implementation of these programmes will be dependent on both sufficient funding being available and on solving the lack of institutional capacity. Umngeni Water...|$|R
40|$|This 2016 Closing the Gap report shows, as in {{previous}} years, {{that there have}} been mixed levels of success in meeting the targets set by the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) in 2008. It underscores the need for all Australian governments to intensify their efforts and partner with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and all Australians to effect change. The results outlined in this report reiterate that while these targets may be ambitious, striving to meet them is essential in building a robust and healthy Australia. The targets focus on the areas of health, education and employment, which are recognised as the key drivers for success in addressing the significant disparity in the health, wellbeing and prosperity between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. THE POPULATION Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people make up three per cent of Australia’s population with almost 80 per cent living in regional and metropolitan areas. The locations with the largest Indigenous populations are in the cities and regional centres closest to coastal areas. While only 14 per cent of Indigenous Australians live in very remote areas, they make up a large proportion (45 per cent) of Australians living in these areas. The proportion of the Indigenous population who live in remote and very remote areas is projected to fall from 21. 3 per cent in 2011 to 17. 5 per cent in 2026. As well as differences in where Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people live, there is great diversity in cultures, language, experience and circumstances. Inherent in this diversity, is a strong connection to country and culture. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population is quite young compared to the general population. In 2011, 36 per cent of Indigenous Australians were aged 0 - 14 years compared to 18 per cent of non-Indigenous Australians. However, the Indigenous population is getting older and by 2026 the proportion of the Indigenous population aged over 65 is projected to almost double from the proportion in 2011 (from 3. 4 per cent in 2011 to 6. 4 per cent in 2026). Outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in education, employment and safety vary by remoteness. For example, in 2015, Indigenous Year 5 students in metropolitan areas were, on average, twice as likely to meet national minimum standards in reading as Indigenous students in very remote areas. PROGRESS AGAINST THE TARGETS There have been some tangible successes and continuing improvement in many of the areas critical to addressing inequality. While long-term improvements are evident, {{it is important to note}} that overall progress has been varied and that meeting many of the Closing the Gap targets remains a significant challenge. State and territory governments will continue to have a critical role in making progress against the targets. The target to halve the gap in child mortality by 2018  is on track. Over the longer term, Indigenous child death rates declined by 33 per cent and the gap narrowed (by 34 per cent) between 1998 and 2014. Immunisation rates for Indigenous children are high – by the age of five a higher percentage of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children are immunised compared with other Australian children. While total Indigenous mortality rates have declined over the longer term, particularly from circulatory diseases (such as heart disease and stroke) the target to close the gap in life expectancy is not on track, based on data since the 2006 baseline. In remote areas, 85 per cent of all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander four-year-olds were enrolled in preschool in 2013. In December 2015, COAG renewed the early childhood education target, aiming for  95 per cent of all Indigenous four-year-olds enrolled in early childhood education by 2025. The baseline data for this new target will be available in March 2016. The latest data shows mixed progress on the target to halve the gap in reading and numeracy for Indigenous students by 2018. Across the eight areas (reading and numeracy for Years 3, 5, 7 and 9), the proportion of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students achieving national minimum standards is on track in four of these eight areas. In May 2014, COAG agreed to a new target to close the gap in school attendance by the end of 2018. In 2015, the attendance rate for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students was 83. 7 per cent, little change from the rate in 2014 (83. 5 per cent). Progress will need to accelerate for this target to be met. An increasing proportion of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people are completing Year 12, up from 45. 4 per cent in 2008 to 58. 5 per cent in 2012 - 13. This means the target to halve the gap in Year 12 attainment by 2020 is on track. Over the past decade there was a 70 per cent increase in the number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students in higher education award courses. There is almost no employment gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous university graduates. The target to halve the gap in employment by 2018  is not on track. Factors such as economic growth, strong Indigenous businesses and gains in Indigenous education will have an impact on the results. HOW IS THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT RESPONDING? It is a shared responsibility of all governments to partner with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in order to meet the Closing the Gap targets. COAG has identified Indigenous affairs as a key priority on its agenda and governments are working together to pursue national reforms that will expand opportunities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and their communities. In 2015, the Australian Government transformed the way Indigenous programmes are funded through the implementation of the Indigenous Advancement Strategy. The Strategy <b>consolidates</b> policies and <b>programmes</b> into five overarching themes: Jobs, Land and Economy; Children and Schooling; Safety and Wellbeing; Culture and Capability; and Remote Australia Strategies. These changes have enabled greater flexibility and responsiveness in programme delivery, to better meet the aspirations and priorities of individual communities. Ensuring Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children have a positive start to life will strengthen their opportunities later in life. The Government’s Better Start to Life approach is expanding established maternal and child health programmes aimed at improving prenatal, postnatal and child health and parenting. Indigenous parenting and playgroup services are helping to build parent-child relationships, develop parent and carer capacity, and provide support to vulnerable children and families, so young children have the opportunities to develop skills in the important years before formal schooling. The focus on early childhood health complements the ongoing investment in chronic disease prevention and management, both essential elements to close the gap in life expectancy. The Government is also continuing its strong support for Aboriginal community controlled health organisations as critical providers of effective primary health care to Indigenous Australians. Early childhood and school education will continue to be prioritised across governments, both of which are critical for increasing opportunities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children later in life. Communities are being supported to identify and address barriers to school attendance through the Remote School Attendance Strategy, resulting in more children regularly attending school in remote Indigenous communities. And beyond school attendance, there are strategies to improve school attainment outcomes, which will lead to increased employment opportunities. Under the new Community Development Programme job seekers in remote Australia are contributing to their communities and gaining valuable work skills. There has been a promising increase in the number of remote Indigenous job seekers on Newstart now engaged in work-related activities. The Australian Government will continue to establish economic development opportunities for Indigenous businesses and native title holders. Recent amendments to the Government’s procurement policy have encouraged government departments to increase their use of Indigenous businesses in their supply chain. This new approach has resulted in new contracts with Indigenous businesses conservatively valued at around $ 36 million between July and December 2015. Meanwhile, opportunities for Indigenous land owners and native title holders to leverage their land assets for economic development will be explored, in line with the recommendations of the COAG investigation into Indigenous land administration and use. All governments are working together to reduce substance abuse and harm, prevent crime, reduce violence and support victims – particularly women and children. The Australian Government’s $ 100 million Women’s Safety Package includes $ 21 million to support Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. This report highlights the interrelated elements that impact the cultural, physical and social wellbeing of Indigenous Australians. It provides valuable insight into where progress is being made, what is and isn’t working and where a more concerted effort is needed. Meeting all the Closing the Gap targets will be challenging, and will take a national commitment and resolve across Indigenous-specific and mainstream programmes. Responsive and innovative solutions are essential to address the current disparity and build a promising future. This will be achieved through true partnership between governments, businesses and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The targets and their impacts cannot be considered independently – they are intrinsically interlinked. Improvements in one area can positively impact another. For example, providing children with a healthy start to life will give them the best chance of academic success which will, in turn, have positive flow-on effects for employment opportunities. The report shows that, while progress against a number of the targets has been limited, the actions taken over recent years are making a difference. The data summarised in this report provides valuable insight into where the need is greater and what strategies are most effectiv...|$|R
