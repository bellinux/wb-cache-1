5000|$|The term <b>communal</b> <b>land</b> in Zimbabwe {{refers to}} certain rural areas within Zimbabwe. <b>Communal</b> <b>lands</b> were {{formerly}} called Tribal Trust Lands (TTL's). Subsistence farming and small scale commercial farming {{are the principal}} economic activities in <b>communal</b> <b>lands,</b> there is usually limited additional employment apart from in a Growth point and with jobs like teaching. Some <b>communal</b> <b>lands</b> have high population densities, {{and as a consequence}} overgrazing by cattle and goats and soil erosion can occur. The farms of <b>communal</b> <b>lands</b> are traditionally unfenced. <b>Communal</b> <b>lands</b> have resident traditional African Chiefs. Many <b>communal</b> <b>lands</b> are at a lower elevation than the richer commercial farms, and consequently experience higher average temperatures, and lower rainfall levels. http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1986/09/01/000009265_3970701165133/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf Since independence, in <b>communal</b> <b>lands,</b> schools have been established and expanded, roads tarred, and electrification has spread.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{background}} {{of this research}} is a phenomenon of uncertified ownership of tanah ulayat (<b>communal</b> <b>land)</b> in which certification is a formal prerequisite in obtaining / arranging for permits to fulfill by all citizens including the owners of <b>communal</b> <b>land.</b> Office for City Planning and Interior of Padang City specifies a specific policy for uncertified <b>communal</b> <b>land</b> that community should fulfill requirements for IMB (Building Permit) by having a so-called “use permit” that is a formal letter which proves the ownership for as well as a permit to utilize the <b>communal</b> <b>land.</b> It is made by a chief of clan being authorized in arrangements for <b>communal</b> <b>land,</b> acknowledged by Head of Village and Head of Subdistrict. The use permit has no legality for there are no local regulations or Mayor’s Decree which stipulate it in building permit (IMB) arrangement for uncertified <b>communal</b> <b>land.</b> This research aims to study and to analyze coordination among formal and informal institutions in permit arrangement (IMB) which utilizes the use permit for uncertified <b>communal</b> <b>land</b> in Padang city. The objective of research is focused on analysis of variables related to coordination among formal and informal institutions in permit arrangement which utilizes the use permit for uncertified <b>communal</b> <b>land.</b> In particular, analysis of actor variable with reference to role and authority functions of formal and informal institutions. This very research employs qualitative-descriptive approach by means of interview and observation techniques as well as an in-depth study of relevant documents. The purpose is to figure out roles and functions of formal institutions engaged in permit arrangements and those of traditional community that require a permit to establish a building on uncertified <b>communal</b> <b>land,</b> and to find out any related processes/procedures, legalities as well as coordination among formal and informal institutions. The research findings reveal that coordination indeed takes place between government institution (Office for City Planning and Interior) and traditional/informal institution (chief of clan) in the form of use permit. It is an informality taking place within a formal process. Government applies a managerial approach in the form of coordination with traditional institution to deal with permit issues for uncertified <b>communal</b> <b>land.</b> The coordination also shows the role and function of informal institution being respectable and applicable in daily lives of communal society. Thus Office for City Planning and Interior can carry out its role and function in controlling development through permit (IMB) in line with the city plan. The use permit is merely a policy with no legality. However, building permit (IMB) for uncertified <b>communal</b> <b>land</b> with use permit is valid and legal. There seems to be no coordination with other government institutions pertaining to permit arrangement. Besides, there has not yet been database on <b>communal</b> <b>land</b> in the form of statistical data or ownership mapping of <b>communal</b> <b>land.</b> The recommendation proposed is {{that there should be a}} specific policy for <b>communal</b> <b>land</b> which regulates legal permit mechanism and institutional coordination related to permit arrangement (IMB). The use permit may be an effective solution for monitoring and controlling development in line with the city plan.

40|$|In South Africa two diverse {{property}} regimes exist alongside one another, {{namely the}} system of individualised, common-law landownership, predominantly based on civil-law principles, and {{the system of}} <b>communal</b> <b>land</b> tenure, predominantly based on the shared use of land by communities in terms of indigenous-law principles. Added to this is a registration system originally based on the Dutch land registration procedures, but modified {{in the nineteenth century}} through the introduction of English cadastral survey procedures linked to the registration system. Only individualised common-law landownership, co-ownership and limited real rights are registrable. The registration system does not provide for the registration of <b>communal</b> <b>land</b> rights, which has the effect that official information in respect of <b>communal</b> <b>land</b> tenure is currently unreliable. The failure to provide tenure security for indigenous communities can be attributed to several factors, including a large incidence of dysfunctional communities; a defective, and often entirely absent, administrative system to support communities; the wrong kind of formalisation introduced by legislation, namely Westernised corporate models too far removed from accepted customs; the absence of the publicity principle; and the lack of a suitable information and recording system. The main aim of a formalised structure should not be the individualisation of <b>communal</b> <b>land</b> tenure in the form of freehold title, but the security offered by information (recording and publication) of <b>communal</b> <b>land</b> rights exercised within accepted community structures. The existing deeds registration already provides for different forms of registration, namely individualised land rights in the case of surveyed land and urban fragmented property holding in the case of sectional titles and timesharing. This article explores the possibility of the development of a third form to record <b>communal</b> <b>land</b> rights in the name of communities, in accordance with the distinctive nature of community structures and <b>communal</b> <b>land</b> tenure. The aim of such a register should be the recording of use rights associated with <b>communal</b> <b>land</b> tenure, which will provide the necessary information (publication) {{for the development of a}} comprehensive land administration system that is lacking at this stage...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} aimed at {{analysing}} <b>communal</b> <b>land</b> use management practices and policies towards sustainability and climate resilience. The objectives {{of this study were}} to assess rainfall variability, climate change impact, adaptation practices and impediment factors for adaptation on the one hand and, on the other, analysing the pressure, scrutinising the sustainability of institutional practices, and assessing policy setting and its application status in managing <b>communal</b> <b>lands.</b> To conduct the study, a household survey, key informant interviews and group discussions were used. It employed both quantitative and qualitative methods. For analysis, rainfall variability trend analysis, different empirical formulas, Principal Component Analysis and analysis of variance were used. In addition, Qualitative Content Analysis technique and descriptive statistical tools were also used. The study found that there was spatiotemporal rainfall variability. About 18 extreme wet and 8 extreme dry events were depicted out of 194 frequencies of events. The most outstanding manifestations of climate change/variability impacts identified were: water scarcity, migration, severe erosion and feed scarcity. Applying biophysical measures on <b>communal</b> <b>lands,</b> practicing area enclosure and constraction of feeder road were moderately excersised adaptation and mitigation practices while, low level community awareness was the most outstanding barrier for community adaptation. Besides, feed source and fuel biomass energy did not satisfy community demand. Government recognition to support community user groups, the existence of community labour contribution and congruence between government legislation and community by-laws were found moderately strong. Besides, <b>communal</b> <b>land</b> administration and use of legislative setting and instruments to govern land administration were adequately in place to implement <b>communal</b> <b>land</b> use and management. However, workability of by-laws in applying them at the ground was a major weakness. In conclusion, the study revealed that there exist generally a weak <b>communal</b> <b>land</b> use management practices and policy implementation towards enhancing sustainability and climate resilience. Hence, the following recommendations were forwarded: enhancing community awareness, encouraging communities to establish their own private woodlots and grazing areas to reduce the pressure on <b>communal</b> <b>land,</b> applying proper <b>communal</b> <b>land</b> resource use and management plans and certifying <b>communal</b> <b>lands</b> with demarcation and maps should be given due emphasis to enhance sustainability. Moreover, policy and legislation evaluation and revision to improve its application at the ground is fundamental.

40|$|Bibliography: pages 77 - 83. This thesis {{describes}} {{some of the}} <b>communal</b> <b>land</b> tenure systems {{pertaining to}} Namibia. Understandably, <b>lands</b> held under <b>communal</b> <b>land</b> tenure {{have tended to be}} neither fully documented nor legally and explicitly formalised; <b>communal</b> <b>land</b> tenure systems have been through the mercy of arbitrary action by the state, private individuals or other institutions (S. A Government, 1996 : 43). The study attempts to examine the issues involved in the design of a <b>communal</b> <b>land</b> tenure information system for Namibia. It therefore seeks to examine the possibility of using information technology to plan and manage customarily held land, the requirement for an effective design and implementation of such a system and the method of designing such an information system to make room for continual improvement and the addition of finer detail. The research begins with an in-depth literature review of the <b>communal</b> <b>land</b> tenure systems in Namibia and a description of similar information systems. This is followed by the research methodology, which describes the technique used for collecting, analysing and presenting the results of the study. The needs analysis and the data structure contained in the atlas are outlined. The fundamental concepts of database design and the various steps taken by the author to design and construct the land tenure database model for the dissertation are also discussed. The pilot project is analysed, taking into account the capability of the system, its success in terms of a needs analysis, and the adequacy of the data. It specifically analyses the design in the light of social relationships, person or group interests and the spatial component of <b>communal</b> <b>land</b> tenure systems with respect to each area. In addition, it seeks to answer the question whether the tool fits the <b>communal</b> <b>land</b> tenure system, discusses {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} the overall system design and the implementation strategies. It is envisaged that, with the provision of the information system in union with its database, this will help to identify and document a <b>communal</b> <b>land</b> tenure system. For the rural dweller or farmer, this system will provide a pictorial image of what is really happening on the ground. The information system could later be upgraded and fully implemented, enabling individuals to effectively plan activities around the existing circumstances and conditions. The recommendation that came out from the study was that given the limited information available on <b>communal</b> <b>land</b> tenure systems, more effort should be spent to study and gather data on the system. It is strongly recommended, therefore, that research into conditions in the communal areas be regarded as a top pri 01 ity by the Government of Namibia. This could lead to a richer information base in the communal areas to be utilised to improve the lifestyle of the rural communities. Thus, the prototype project designed in this thesis should be implemented fully and later developed and incorporated into an information system which, in the past, has lacked <b>communal</b> <b>land</b> tenure input. The research could not touch on all the <b>communal</b> <b>land</b> tenure areas in Namibia. It is therefore advised that the rest should be investigated in more detail. The inheritance and conflict resolution mechanism which were not modelled effectively should also be reinvestigated...|$|R
