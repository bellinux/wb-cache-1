40|$|In Quebec province, cycling {{has been}} growing in {{popularity}} in recent years. Projects such as « La Route Verte » were created so that local authorities could develop and improve their bicycle networks. Decisions must increasingly be taken in rural areas concerning the designation of bicycle routes and associated roadside improvements. However, no tool adapted to Quebec conditions has been developed to identify the most <b>compatible</b> <b>routes</b> for cyclists on the road network. This research aims to build a safety and compatibility index for rural and urban fringe areas, {{using a combination of}} parameters (ex. speed, traffic, and layout). The resulting CRC Index (Compatibility of Roads for Cyclists) is an innovative tool: it allows the evaluation of both existing and potential routes, and of modifications that may be needed. The index is built on the results of a survey to evaluate a variety of rural sites by cyclists, and to understand their perceptions of comfort and safety relative to different elements of bicycle routes and the characteristics of rural roads. This decision-aid tool should be easy to use both by planners and bicycle coordinators. Also, the CRC Index goes further than previous tools using cartographi...|$|E
40|$|Micro fuel cells, {{especially}} {{proton exchange}} membrane fuel cells (PEM-FCs), are promising {{high energy density}} power sources for portable applications. For example, Rice et al. have reported a PEM-FC using formic acid as the fuel with Pd-based anode catalysts. 1 Good, robust catalysts are crucial {{for the performance of}} these micro fuel cells that are often intended for portable applications.

In this paper, the authors {{report on the}} use of electrodeposited Cu films on Si for transfer free fabrication of suspended graphene devices. The quality of graphene layers on optimized electrodeposited Cu and Cu foil are found to be the same. By selectively etching the underlying Cu, the authors have realized by a transfer free process metal contacted, suspended graphene beams up to 50 mu m in length directly on Si. The suspended graphene beams do not show any increase in defect levels over the as grown state indicating the efficiency of the transfer free process. Measured room temperature electronic mobilities of up to 5200 cm(2) /V. s show that this simpler and CMOS <b>compatible</b> <b>route</b> has the potential to replace the foil based route for such suspended nano and micro electromechanical device arrays.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to verify the potential of SNAP III (Scheduling and Network Analysis Program) as a support tool for harvesting and wood transport planning in Brazil harvesting subsystem definition and establishment of a <b>compatible</b> <b>route</b> were assessed. Initially, machine operational and production costs were determined in seven subsystems for the study area, and quality indexes, construction and maintenance costs of forest roads were obtained and used as SNAP III program input data. The results showed, that three categories of forest road occurrence were observed in the study area: main, secondary and tertiary which, based on quality index, allowed a medium vehicle speed of about 41, 30 and 24 km/hours and a construction cost of about US$ 5, 084. 30, US$ 2, 275. 28 and US$ 1, 650. 00 /km, respectively. The SNAP III program used as a support tool for the planning, was found to have a high potential tool in the harvesting and wood transport planning. The program was capable of defining efficiently, the harvesting subsystem on technical and economical basis, the best wood transport route and the forest road to be used in each period of the horizon planning...|$|R

We envision an environment, in which the motion of these crowdsourced mobile resources is coordinated, according to their preexisting schedules to satisfy geo-temporal demand on a mobility field. In this paper, we propose an incentive <b>compatible</b> <b>route</b> coordination mechanism for crowdsourced resources, in which participating mobile agents satisfy geo-temporal requests in return for monetary rewards. We define the Flexible Route Coordination (FRC) problem, in which an agent’s flexibility is exploited to maximize the coverage of a mobility field, with an objective to maximize the revenue collected from satisfied paying requests. Given that the FRC problem is NP-hard, we define an optimal algorithm to plan the route of a single agent on a graph with evolving labels, then we use that algorithm to define a 1 -approximation algorithm to solve the 2 problem in its general model, with multiple agents. Moreover, we define an incentive compatible, rational, and cash-positive payment mechanism, which guarantees that an agent’s truthfulness about its flexibility is an ex-post Nash equilibrium strategy. Finally, we analyze the proposed mechanisms theoretically, and evaluate their performance experimentally using real mobility traces from urban environments...|$|R

40|$|Nanostructured {{composites}} of inorganic {{and organic}} materials are attracting extensive interest for electronic and optoelectronic device applications. In this paper, we introduce a general method for the fabrication of metal sulfide nanoparticle/polymer films employing a low-cost and low temperature <b>route</b> <b>compatible</b> with large-scale device manufacturing. Our approach {{is based upon}} the controlled in situ thermal decomposition of a solution processable metal xanthate precursor complex in a semiconducting polymer film. To demonstrate the versatility of our method, we fabricate a CdS/P 3 HT nanocomposite film and show that the metal sulfide network inside the polymer film assists in the absorption of visible light and enables the achievement of high yields of charge photogeneration at the CdS/P 3 HT heterojunction. Photovoltaic devices based upon such nanocomposite films show solar light to electrical energy conversion efficiencies of 0. 7 % under full AM 1. 5 illumination and 1. 2 % under 10 % incident power, demonstrating the potential of such nanocomposite films for low-cost photovoltaic devices...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: One of {{the major}} {{challenges}} faced by designers of ad hoc network systems is supporting the deployment of applications that require tightly constrained communication support. Examples of this application class include emergency response systems, military systems and mobile or sensor-based scientific applications. This paper describes QoS-AODV ¸ an integrated End-to-End Delay (EED) bounded route discovery and bandwidth reservation protocol. QoS-AODV is designed to operate within a Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) network. Unlike other path finding protocols that ignore {{the impact of the}} data link layer, QoS-AODV incorporates slot scheduling information to ensure that bandwidth reserved and EED requirements satisfied as well. To minimize EED, QoS-AODV uses an efficient heuristic algorithm for TDMA slot assignment that in addition provides zero delay jitter. QoS-AODV is an enhanced version of the Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector routing protocol, and is therefore <b>compatible</b> with proposed <b>route</b> discover and maintenance techniques. In order to test the effectiveness of our protocol we implemented a version of QoS-AODV, along with several QoS enable variations, in the ns- 2 simulator. Our experiments showed the QoS-AODV significantly improved the probability of being able to find an end-to-end QoS path...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMost {{of what we}} {{know about}} the human frontal eye field (FEF) is {{extrapolated}} from studies in animals. There is ample evidence that this region is crucial for eye movements. However, evidence is accumulating that this region also plays a role in sensory processing and that it belongs to a "fast brain" system. We set out to investigate these issues in humans, using intracerebral recordings in patients with drug-refractory epilepsy. Event-related potential recordings were obtained from 11 epileptic patients from within the FEF region while they passed a series of visual and auditory perceptual tests. No eye movement was required. Ultra-rapid responses were observed, with mean onset latencies at 24 ms after stimulus to auditory stimuli and 45 ms to visual stimuli. Such early responses were <b>compatible</b> with cortical <b>routes</b> as assessed with simultaneous recordings in primary auditory and visual cortices. Components were modulated very early by the sensory characteristics of the stimuli, in the 30 - 60 ms period for auditory stimuli and in the 45 - 60 ms period for visual stimuli. Although the frontal lobes in humans are generally viewed as being involved in high-level cognitive processes, these results indicate that the human FEF is a remarkably quickly activated multimodal region that belongs to a network of low-level neocortical sensory areas...|$|R
40|$|The {{amino acid}} leucine is {{efficiently}} {{used by the}} trypanosomatid Leishmania mexicana for sterol biosynthesis. The incubation of [2 - 13 C]leucine with L. mexicana promastigotes {{in the presence of}} ketoconazole gave 14 -methylergosta- 8, 24 (241) - 3 -ol as the major sterol, which was shown by mass spectrometry to contain up to six atoms of 13 C per molecule. 13 C NMR analysis of the 14 -methylergosta- 8, 24 (241) - 3 -ol revealed that it was labeled in only six positions: C- 2, C- 6, C- 11, C- 12, C- 16, and C- 23. This established that the leucine skeleton is incorporated intact into the isoprenoid pathway leading to sterol; it is not converted first to acetyl-CoA, as in animals and plants, with utilization of the acetyl-CoA to regenerate 3 -hydroxy- 3 -methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA). An inhibitor of HMG-CoA synthase (L- 659, 699) blocked the incorporation of [1 - 14 C]acetate into sterol but had no inhibitory effect on [U- 14 C]leucine incorporation. The HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor lovastatin inhibited promastigote growth and [U- 14 C]leucine incorporation into sterol. The addition of unlabeled mevalonic acid (MVA) overcame the lovastatin inhibition of growth and also diluted the incorporation of [1 - 14 C]leucine into sterol. These results are <b>compatible</b> with two <b>routes</b> by which the leucine skeleton may enter intact into the isoprenoid pathway. The catabolism of leucine could generate HMG-CoA that is then directly reduced to MVA for incorporation into sterol. Alternatively, a compound produced as an intermediate in leucine breakdown to HMG-CoA (e. g. dimethylcrotonyl-CoA) could be directly reduced to produce an isoprene alcohol followed by phosphorylation to enter the isoprenoid pathway post-MVA...|$|R
40|$|Polyethylene {{terephthalate}} (PET) {{is one of}} {{the major}} polymers produced worldwide. However, the polycondensation of PET requires the use of a catalyst which is nowadays antimony-based. Even if there is still no restrictive legislation, antimony-based catalysts are suspected to be hazardous and have come under increasing scrutiny with regard to food packaging applications. PET producers are therefore searching for alternatives. A possibility is to use titanium alkoxides which are cheap, very efficient catalysts and said to be of low toxicity. Nevertheless, titanium alkoxides induce a strong yellowing of the polymer that is commercially unacceptable. Consequently, the major objective of the thesis is to find a synthesis <b>route</b> <b>compatible</b> with the industrial requirements in order to avoid the coloration arising from the use of titanium catalysts. As a polymerization process is influenced by large number of factors, it cannot be approached globally with classical methodologies. For this reason, the study of the PET synthesis proposed here will use a statistical methodology called “design of experiments” (DOE). The DOE method uses the multivariate analysis in order to model a phenomenon from a limited and well-defined number of experiments. The DOE study demonstrates that it is possible to synthesize PET suitable for soft-drinks bottles using titanium alkoxides. This result is obtained by combining low titanium catalyst concentration and moderate synthesis temperature with the addition of phosphoric acid during the polycondensation. The role of phosphoric acid is to limit the strong catalysis of the PET thermal degradation by the titanium which is the main cause of the yellowing. Finally, in the search for colored species, an unexpected biphenyl structure was identified in the PET degradation products. This structure is not directly responsible of the PET yellowness but provides important informations concerning the side-reactions arising from the thermal degradation. (AGRO 3) [...] UCL, 201...|$|R
40|$|Oxidative {{biocatalysts}} have a vast {{industrial and}} biotechnological potential {{in areas such}} as fine chemical and antibiotic synthesis. They offer an environmentally <b>compatible</b> and sustainable <b>route</b> to catalysis, often simpler and more specific than chemical alternatives. However, the routine use of biocatalysts in biopharmaceutical manufacture has been hindered by biocatalyst complexity and the experimental burden necessary for implementation. This thesis aims to investigate, using automated microscale technologies, how oxidative biocatalytic bioprocesses can be designed and developed at a reduced cost and timeframe compared to conventional laboratory scale experimentation. A robotic platform was used with 96 -Deep square well microtiter plates to develop an effective bioprocess for investigating cyclohexanone monooxygenase (CHMO). E. coli cultivations for CHMO production, bioconversion, liquid-liquid metabolite extraction and analytic techniques were conducted using the developed microscale automated approach. Each step allowed rapid and reproducible collection of quantitative kinetic data over multiples runs achieving ‘walk away operation’. Whole bioprocess evaluation was achieved, whereby linking multiple unit operations enabled rapid assessment of process interactions. Factors influencing CHMO activity and bioconversion yields were investigated along with alternative bioconversion substrates. From identified limitations of the CHMO system an optimised process was developed where the processing time was almost halved and CHMO activity increased 5 -fold. Two novel self-sufficient cytochrome P 450 systems, P 450 SU 1 and P 450 SU 2 were investigated using an automated approach where factors limiting bioconversion were identified. Implementation of the required improvements resulted in a 5 -fold improvement in enzymatic expression and 5 -fold and 1. 5 -fold increase in product formation from cytochrome P 450 SU 1 and P 450 SU 2, respectively. A matched oxygen transfer coefficient approach was used for predictive scale-up. The optimised microscale CHMO and P 450 processes were scaled to 75 L and 7. 5 L bioreactor scale, respectively. Growth and bioconversion kinetics were found to be identical between scales for the CHMO system whereas differences were observed for the P 450 systems. Results described in this thesis have demonstrated the benefits of microscale automated methodologies for the creation, investigation and predictive scale-up of oxidative biocatalytic bioprocesses. The established strategies evaluated in this work contribute to meeting the current demand to decrease developmental costs and timelines...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the synthesis of chiral pyrrolidinone scaffolds as mimics of the natural product pramanicin, and the evaluation of their antibacterial properties for use towards the development of potential novel antibacterial lead compounds. Chapter 1 discusses the urgency of the antibiotic resistance problem as well as the current lack of new antibiotics in the drug pipeline. This dearth of new antibacterials is partly attributed to the combinatorial libraries used in the screening process which occupies a limited chemical space. By applying the natural product-inspired paradigm, it is hypothesised that a drug discovery process with a starting point based on a natural product, possessing intrinsic antibacterial properties, may provide insights to a novel class of antibacterials. Chapter 2 describes the synthesis of three different scaffolds of oxygenated pyrrolidinones via a common bicyclic intermediate synthesised from L-pyroglutamic acid. The use of a mild and facile epoxidation condition utilising H 2 O 2 /tertiary amine afforded the epoxypyrrolidinones. α-Hydroxylation with “Davis oxaziridine” and a Ru-mediated dihydroxylation gave 2 -hydroxypyrrolidinones and 2, 3 -dihydroxypyrrolidinones respectively. In all cases, a pendant Weinreb amide was used to introduce a variety of side-chains onto the parent pyrrolidinones. The enantioselective oxygenation of these scaffolds was accomplished {{as a result of the}} chiral [3. 3. 0] bicyclic intermediate. Chapter 3 describes the attempted synthesis of oxygenated pyrrolidinones via tetramic acids. Although progress was thwarted by synthetic challenges discussed therein, a series of tetramic acids was synthesised. A synthetic sequence to install a 3 -acyl moiety onto the parent tetramic acid core was accomplished via an O -acyl/ C -acyl rearrangement using a series of carboxylic acids in the presence of excess DMAP. The use of a 3 -acyltetramic acid with a pendant phosphorane permits a general synthetic <b>route,</b> <b>compatible</b> with a wide range of aldehydes, towards 3 -enoyltetramic acids via Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons olefination. These tetramic acids are mimics of another class of bactericidal natural products which nonetheless allows the natural product-inspired paradigm to be investigated. Finally, an analysis of the antibacterial properties of the synthesised compounds is discussed in Chapter 4. A cellular hole-plate bioassay with E. coli and S. aureus was chosen to provide a rapid assessment for active compounds. A correlation between the physicochemical properties and the observed activities of these active compounds suggested possible chemical modifications which could be undertaken in the future to improve their activities.

40|$|The oil {{industry}} has {{a vital role}} in energy provision and the economic aspects of its operations, which is associated with high values and risks. Continuous oil production from fields is essential, and it is important that this is supported by robust logistics solutions. Offshore production facilities require supplies that are transported from an onshore port to the facility by platform supply vessels. Ship transportation is the most costly part of the upstream logistics sector, making good planning even more critical. This study examines the order cycle for Petrobras in the Campos Basin in Brazil. Models are developed simulating the situations where supply orders are generated from a random distribution and where different policies concerning the vessel voyages are applied. Periodic problems are solved to determine the order service and corresponding sailing routes for each given ship journey. The objective functions minimises costs for orders that are not served at departures from where they are requested, in addition to the distances travelled when this is proposed as a possibility. Inconvenience costs were set proportional to the demand quantities for the specific orders, with more weight put on delivery service rather than pickup. The model is flexible and simple with fixed routes and schedules in use, imitating the present situation. Challenging the voyages however, complicates it. Petrobras experience problems in their supply chain originating in onshore logistics. 25 % of the orders scheduled for given departures arrive at the port too late to be transported, and 50 % of orders are requested as emergencies whilst the percentage in fact should be 10. No-shows lead to low utilisation of the vessels and frequent express leasing, which if further impacted by the amount of emergencies in need of hurried services with express. Overbooking is a strategy that potentially can correct parts of the problem. This was proven when planning for 20 - 25 % excess capacity than the actual, where the expected delays were reduced by one third. If Petrobras were able to reduce the proportion of no-shows to 15 % and emergency requests back to its normal state of 10 %, the analyses show reductions of nearly 40 % and 80 % in order delay and express demand, respectively. In addition, if they were able to make their Logistics <b>compatible</b> with dynamic <b>route</b> planning as well, the potential of saving up to 70 - 75 % in order delay is evident, where there no longer exists any reasons to use express. This should act as an incentive to make an effort to improve the logistics system. Nevertheless, there is a trade-off with the use of different policies applied due to the uncertain nature of the problem. A detailed evaluation is left to the decision makers...|$|R
