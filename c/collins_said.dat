According to Collins, Bamber went on to have sexual relationships with men and women, finding that his good looks and charm made him popular with both. He left school with no qualifications, much to Nevill's anger, but managed to pass seven O-levels at sixth-form college in Colchester, which he left in 1978.|$|E

500|$|David W. Collins as PROXY— Starkiller's droid sidekick. <b>Collins</b> <b>said</b> PROXY has C-3PO's innocence {{but also}} is [...] "really dangerous." [...] The {{companion}} trade paperback describes {{the conflict between}} PROXY's primary programming to kill Starkiller and its self-imposed desire to help him; PROXY is eager to please Starkiller, but {{does not know how}} dangerous it can be or that there is a conflict between its programming and Starkiller's wishes. Trying to avoid having PROXY's dialogue become too reminiscent of either C-3PO or the villainous HK-47 of Knights of the Old Republic, developers focused on PROXY's friendly naïvety.|$|E
500|$|The {{first four}} rounds were {{relatively}} close, with Gomez leading according to pundits, but the fight {{ended in the}} fifth round under bizarre circumstances when {{for no apparent reason}} Gomez stopped fighting and failed to defend himself. He then received a number of unanswered punches from McDonagh before being floored. Gomez rose from the canvas immediately but appeared to ignore the referee and walk towards his corner while the referee continued with his count. [...] Gomez then left the ring as the referee was waving the fight off. RTÉ commentator Steve <b>Collins</b> <b>said</b> [...] "I smell a rat, something's not right here." ...|$|E

But I learned that the female powers of persuasion easily trump fangs and knives and guns."

50|$|In March 2016, Det.

He noted {{that of the}} six cases being investigated, five of the cats had not been claimed {{which would make it}} difficult to bring charges of theft or criminal damage. An investigating vet said he had found raw chicken in the stomachs of a number of the felines killed, believing the perpetrator was using the meat to lure the cats. The RSPCA believes that the deaths were due to blunt trauma, possibly from a moving vehicle. SNARL said some animals may have been thrown against a wall.|$|R

[...] In 1800, Madison was appointed as a trustee of the Kentucky Seminary in Franklin County. On December 5, 1806, he served on a grand jury in the case of Aaron Burr's conduct; they did not find grounds for treason charges. Madison was appointed director of the Bank of Kentucky later that year.|$|E

500|$|Internationalist was {{recorded}} at Melbourne's Sing Sing Studios, with Powderfinger accompanied by American producer Nick DiDia {{for the first}} time. As the band had already prepared [...] "about 30 or 40" [...] songs when they entered the studio, DiDia's task was relatively minor. Bassist John <b>Collins</b> <b>said</b> of DiDia; [...] "Nick was really good. The way Nick based the record was {{that he wanted to}} record the band how we were at that particular moment, he didn't want to play around too much." [...] As a result of this attitude, the band only spent one month in the studio, and the album was mixed by DiDia soon after. [...] Powderfinger used the extra time to play table tennis, which was the band's recreation of choice during the Internationalist and Odyssey Number Five recording sessions.|$|E

500|$|Inspiration for the book's content {{came from}} {{numerous}} sources. In an interview {{posted on the}} Wizards of the Coast website, <b>Collins</b> <b>said</b> that inspiration came from Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel, various Dracula films, along with films The Mummy and The Mummy Returns. Cordell said that pop culture has [...] "less impact on [...] conceptualizations of the undead", but he did mention The Evil Dead, 28 Days Later and the novel Salem's Lot. According to Collins, he and Cordell worked equally on the book, with Collins focusing more on material relating to character building, sample undead and running undead, while Cordell dealt with monster design and undead material, {{but he said that}} they [...] "dabbled in each others'" [...] sections quite a bit as well". He also mentioned a monster template designed by Matt Sernett that was originally written for the Monster Manual III and had been included in Libris Mortis.|$|E
500|$|The {{album is}} named after an {{incident}} at The Pump Room restaurant in Chicago, Illinois. Collins, entering the restaurant with former Led Zeppelin lead vocalist Robert Plant, was denied admittance {{because he did not}} meet the restaurant's dress code of [...] "jacket required" [...] for dinner while Plant was allowed in. Collins was wearing a jacket and argued about it. The maître d'hôtel argued that the jacket was not [...] "proper". <b>Collins</b> <b>said</b> in an interview with Playboy that he was, at that point, never so mad in his life. After the incident, the singer often appeared on shows such as Late Night with David Letterman and The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, denouncing the restaurant and telling his story. The management of the restaurant later sent him a complimentary sport coat and an apology letter, stating that he could come to the restaurant wearing whatever he wanted.|$|E
500|$|Collins {{described}} the album {{as not being}} as easy listening as their previous work, and that it contained numerous experiments in songwriting {{that they had not}} put into previous albums. Fanning later said Internationalist was [...] "a better record" [...] than Double Allergic, but acknowledged that it was not as easily likeable—it was just an improvement in songwriting. Collins and Fanning acknowledged that the album's experimental nature could lose them some old fans, but the pair drew parallels with bands such as U2, who <b>Collins</b> <b>said</b> had [...] "constantly re-invented themselves, and with success". He said Powderfinger's reinvention was as much for the band's own interest as it was for the [...] "public's perception". Meanwhile, guitarist Ian Haug {{described the}} album as a [...] "moderation" [...] between Parables for Wooden Ears ("the complicated beast") and Double Allergic ("totally simplified"), Powderfinger's two previous albums. He also agreed that the album was much more experimental, and described the album as the band's [...] "most successful", as well as stating that the album that best replicated [...] "the sound we have live".|$|E
50|$|The song's lyrics {{tell the}} story of a boy who runs away from his abusive home, and—after some reconsideration—attempts to return, only to be rebuked by his father.

Collins {{was not allowed to}} compete by his Olympic {{committee}} after they found out he stayed with his wife, outside of the Olympic village. Collins required to get permission to stay outside the village for multiple nights in a row, and the committee stated he violated team discipline rules. On the issue of not being allowed to compete, <b>Collins</b> <b>said</b> [...] "I feel that I should stay in a hotel with my wife, with or without their permission, that’s the honest to God truth whether they like it or not." [...] He planned to never race for the country again, stating, [...] "This is how it ends, it ends on a really sad note. I should have been allowed to run. I don’t see what is the big deal, I am a grown man, I’m just about to become a grandfather." [...] Collins would later compete in the 2016 Olympics under the same flag.|$|E
500|$|The group's touring {{schedule}} had put particular {{pressure on}} Collins, whose marriage was {{at risk of}} collapse due to him being away from home frequently. His wife, Andrea, had warned {{him that if he}} committed himself to the full ...And Then There Were Three... Tour, she would not be there when he returned. Collins, however, was convinced that Genesis {{were on the verge of}} an international breakthrough and that his work with the band would pay dividends in the future. By the end of 1978, Andrea had decided to move to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada with their children. Realising that his marriage was more important than the band, Collins held a meeting with Banks, Rutherford and manager Tony Smith. He said he was moving to Vancouver and try and re-build the family, and that the group would have to accommodate this. In an interview for Sounds, <b>Collins</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I went off for two months to try and sort things out ... I was never going to leave the band. It was just that if I was going to be living in Vancouver then we'd have had to organise ourselves differently." [...] He also noted that the individual members of his side project Brand X were geographically dispersed.|$|E
500|$|The next {{international}} {{visitors to}} Australia were the English team of 1924–1925, under the captaincy of Arthur Gilligan. In the First Test at Sydney, Collins opened the batting and scored 114. Batting {{with a young}} Victorian in his début Test, Bill Ponsford, Collins was confident enough to shelter him from the brilliant swing bowling of Maurice Tate. Ponsford went on to make a century (110) on début. Ponsford later said [...] "I was most grateful for Herbie taking [...] until I was settled in. I doubt I would have scored a century but for his selfless approach." [...] In the Second Test at Melbourne, chasing 600, the English pair of Jack Hobbs and Herbert Sutcliffe batted throughout the third day for an unbroken partnership of 283. Before play commenced the next day, <b>Collins</b> <b>said</b> to his profligate leg spinner, [...] "You're going straight on to get Hobbs if we're to have a chance". The first ball of the day, Mailey bowled a full toss. Collins moved the field, leaving {{a gap in the}} offside field. The next ball was another full toss and Hobbs, looking to hit it into the gap, missed it all ends up and was bowled for 154.|$|E

5000|$|In a one-star {{review in}} The Daily Telegraph, Robbie <b>Collin</b> <b>said</b> [...] "it {{may be the}} most staggeringly {{perfunctory}} piece of filmmaking I have ever seen." [...] Phelim O'Neill, in another one-star review for The Guardian, said [...] "the script ... must have taken longer to read than it did to write." [...] Writing in The Sun, Alex Zane was slightly less critical in a two-star review entitled [...] "This Lemon sucks", saying that [...] "this film just doesn’t capture the anarchy that makes Keith Lemon enjoyable, unpredictable and, most importantly... amusing." [...] In writing for Total Film, George Bass describes the funniest moment in the film as [...] "a bus sign (“T’LEEDS”). Six letters and an apostrophe. Save yourself the ticket." [...] Chris Tookey of the Daily Mail named the film as one of the worst British comedies of all time and said that, [...] "Nothing funny happens...

500|$|Prior to the 1977 tour Bruford {{declined}} {{an offer}} to return as second drummer, leaving Collins searching for a replacement. He heard American drummer Chester Thompson, of Frank Zappa's band and Weather Report, play a drum passage on [...] "More Trouble Every Day" [...] from Zappa's live album Roxy & Elsewhere. <b>Collins</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "It floored me completely ... I had never met him. I rang him up and said, 'Hi Chester, I've heard your stuff, {{would you like to}} play with Genesis?' ... He didn't even audition!" [...] Genesis toured Wind & Wuthering from January to July 1977 across Europe, North America, and for the first time, Brazil. The stage show cost £400,000 (equivalent to £ in [...] ). which featured a new PA system, lasers and smoke, and lighting supplied from two rows of Boeing 747 aircraft landing lights. Touring began on 1 January with three sold-out shows at the Rainbow Theatre in London, where 80,000 applications were made for the 8,000 available tickets. They returned to London for three nights at Earls Court, then the largest arena in Britain, supported by Richie Havens. The band's growing popularity in North America led to television appearances and concerts organised in larger venues than previous tours, including Madison Square Garden in New York City. Their Brazilian dates were attended by over 150,000 people and a proposed 100,000-person gig was cancelled over rioting fears. An armed bodyguard accompanied each member throughout their stay.|$|E
500|$|The game on May 1 in Philadelphia {{became a}} moment of peace in the rivalry during {{the top of the}} ninth inning. Mets' Daniel Murphy was batting as a pinch-hitter against Phillies' {{reliever}} Ryan Madson when the fans started chanting [...] "U-S-A!" [...] The Phillies didn't know the reason for the chants, but in the Mets' dugout, bench coach Ken Oberkfell told Manager Terry Collins that al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, the mastermind of the September 11 attacks, had been killed by United States special operations forces in Abbottabad, Pakistan. Shane Victorino later told the Phillies the news. However, when asked how they learned about it during an on-air telephone call with Mike and Mike in the Morning on ESPN Radio the next day, he said that a trainer in the dugout broke the news. Ryan Howard called the news [...] "an uplifting moment," [...] while Victorino said it was [...] "a special moment...for families...who...lost their loved ones...(on) 9/11" [...] and [...] "a big day in American history." [...] On the Mets' side, David Wright called it [...] "just an incredible moment and...you kind of come together...for a common cause", while <b>Collins</b> <b>said</b> that the Mets 21, 14-inning win behind Ronny Paulino's game-winning RBI double in his Mets debut was [...] "a good win for us, and obviously a huge win for America tonight", but felt they [...] "could have finished the game two hours ago and celebrated a little bit of it." [...] Mike Lopresti of USA Today called the game between the rivals [...] "a perfect fit" [...] when the news broke, while Adam Rubin of ESPNNewYork.com called the peace in the rivalry [...] "fitting" [...] for a Mets fan, and said that it drew parallels to their 32 win over rival Atlanta Braves on September 21, 2001 in the first major sporting event in New York City since the attacks.|$|E
500|$|In June 1974, Genesis {{started work}} on their double concept album The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway. It marked the start of Gabriel's {{increasingly}} strained relationship {{on the rest of}} the group which contributed to his departure. The album was written at Headley Grange in East Hampshire where upon their arrival, the building was in a state left by the previous band with excrement on the floor and rat infestations. Gabriel objected to Rutherford's idea of an album based on The Little Prince by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, thinking the idea was [...] "too twee". He persuaded the band with a less fantastical and more complicated story involving Rael, a Puerto Rican youth living in New York City who embarks on a spiritual quest to establish his freedom and identity while meeting several bizarre characters on the way. Gabriel wrote the story with influences from West Side Story, [...] "a kind of punk" [...] twist to Pilgrim's Progress, author Carl Jung, and the film El Topo by Alejandro Jodorowsky. Most of the album's lyrics were written by Gabriel, leaving much of its music to the rest of the group. His absence from a considerable amount of writing sessions due to difficulties with his wife's first birth was something Rutherford and Banks [...] "were horribly unsupportive" [...] of. Gabriel also left the group when director William Friedkin asked him to write a screenplay, but returned after the project was shelved. In August 1974, production moved to Glaspant Manor in Carmarthenshire, Wales with Burns, as co-producer, operating Island Studios' mobile equipment. Further work and mixing took place at Island where Brian Eno contributed synthesizers and effects that the album's sleeve credits as [...] "Enossification". When Gabriel asked Eno how the band could repay him, Eno said he needed a drummer for his track [...] "Mother Whale Eyeless". <b>Collins</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I got sent upstairs as payment". Gabriel was pleased with Eno's work but Banks was less enthusiastic.|$|E
5000|$|Billy <b>Collins</b> {{originally}} <b>said</b> the paradelle {{was invented}} in 11th-century France, but he later admitted that he invented it himself to parody strict forms of poetry, particularly the villanelle.

25|$|Another option {{available}} to the committee was to have allowed Collins to take his potential game-winning kick at a later date. Although the modern laws of the game allow a match to be abandoned after a delay of thirty minutes, this provision {{was not included in}} the laws of 1967. <b>Collins</b> himself <b>said</b> that he was surprised that he was not allowed to return to take his kick the following day.|$|R
500|$|Several Midwestern lawmakers {{commented that}} they {{continued}} to oppose EPA's consideration of the [...] "dicey science" [...] of indirect land use that [...] "punishes domestic fuels".
