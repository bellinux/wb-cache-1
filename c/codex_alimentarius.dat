25|$|The United Nations' food {{standards}} body, <b>Codex</b> <b>Alimentarius</b> Commission, has set {{the maximum}} amount of melamine allowed in powdered infant formula to 1mg/kg and the amount of the chemical allowed in other foods and animal feed to 2.5mg/kg. While not legally binding, the levels allow countries to ban importation of products with excessive levels of melamine.|$|E
25|$|FAO and the World Health Organization {{created the}} <b>Codex</b> <b>Alimentarius</b> Commission in 1961 to develop food standards, {{guidelines}} and texts such as {{codes of practice}} under the Joint FAO/ WHO Food Standards Programme.

25|$|In 2003, the <b>Codex</b> <b>Alimentarius</b> removed any upper {{dose limit}} for food {{irradiation}} {{as well as}} clearances for specific foods, declaring that all are safe to irradiate. Countries such as Pakistan and Brazil have adopted the Codex without any reservation or restriction. Other countries, including New Zealand, Australia, Thailand, India, and Mexico, have permitted the irradiation of fresh fruits for fruit fly quarantine purposes, amongst others.|$|E
25|$|Depuration {{of oysters}} {{is a common}} {{industry}} practice and widely researched {{in the scientific community}} but is not commonly known by end consumers. The main objective of seafood depuration is to remove fecal contamination in seafood before being sold to end consumers. Oyster depuration is useful since they are generally eaten raw and in many countries, the requirement to process is government-regulated or mandatory. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) formally recognizes depuration and has published detailed documents on the process, whereas the <b>Codex</b> <b>Alimentarius,</b> encourages the application of seafood depuration.|$|E
25|$|Since 2012, the Chinese {{government}} has effectively banned Korean kimchi exports to China through government regulations. Ignoring {{the standards of}} Kimchi outlined by the <b>Codex</b> <b>Alimentarius,</b> China defined kimchi as a derivative {{of one of its}} own cuisines, called pao cai. However, due to significantly different preparation techniques from pao cai, kimchi has significantly more lactic acid bacteria through its fermentation process, which exceeds China's regulations. Since 2012, commercial exports of Korean kimchi to China has reached zero, the only minor amounts of exports accounting for Korean kimchi exhibition events held in China.|$|E
25|$|Adulteration {{of honey}} is the {{addition}} of other sugars, syrups, or compounds into honey to change its flavor or viscosity, make it cheaper to produce, or increase the fructose content to stave off crystallization. According to the <b>Codex</b> <b>Alimentarius</b> of the United Nations, any product labeled as honey or pure honey must be a wholly natural product, although different nations have their own laws concerning labeling. Adulteration of honey is sometimes used {{as a method of}} deception when buyers are led to believe that the honey is pure. The practice was common dating back to ancient times, when crystallized honey was often mixed with flour or other fillers, hiding the adulteration from buyers until the honey was liquefied. In modern times, the most common adulteration-ingredient became clear, almost-flavorless corn syrup, which, when mixed with honey, is often very difficult to distinguish from unadulterated honey.|$|E

2500|$|The {{international}} trade in food is standardized in the <b>Codex</b> <b>Alimentarius.</b> Hydrogenated oils and fats come under the scope of Codex Stan 19. Non-dairy fat spreads are covered by Codex Stan 256-2007. In the <b>Codex</b> <b>Alimentarius,</b> trans fat to be labelled as such {{is defined as the}} geometrical isomers of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids having non-conjugated [...] carbon-carbon double bonds in the trans configuration. This definition excludes specifically the trans fats (vaccenic acid and conjugated linoleic acid) that are present especially in human milk, dairy products, and beef.|$|E

The NHF also opposes interventions such as water fluoridation and childhood vaccines. The Federation has official observer status at meetings of the <b>Codex</b> <b>Alimentarius</b> Commission, the highest international body on food standards.

2500|$|In 1996, Korea protested against Japanese {{commercial}} production of kimchi {{arguing that the}} Japanese-produced product (kimuchi) was different from kimchi (in particular, Japanese kimuchi was not fermented so it was salted but sweet cabbage). [...] Korea lobbied for an international standard from the <b>Codex</b> <b>Alimentarius,</b> an organization associated with the World Health Organization that defines voluntary standards for food preparation for international trade purposes. In 2001, the <b>Codex</b> <b>Alimentarius</b> published a voluntary standard defining kimchi as [...] "a fermented food that uses salted napa cabbages as its main ingredient mixed with seasonings, and goes through a lactic acid production process at a low temperature", but which neither specified a minimum amount of fermentation nor forbade {{the use of any}} additives.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1990s, {{a dispute}} arose {{regarding}} {{the marketing of}} kimchi, {{considered to be a}} traditional Korean dish. Kimchi was growing in popularity, and its consumption and production were expanding. Korean manufacturers, however, argued that Japanese kimchi is fundamentally different, in that Japanese manufacturers often skip fermentation and mimic the flavors through the use of additives. South Korean producers argued that this made the product fundamentally different from kimchi, while Japanese producers argued they were simply altering the product to fit local tastes. In 2000, South Korea began lobbying the makers of the <b>Codex</b> <b>Alimentarius,</b> an international food-standards maker which provides voluntary advice to national food agencies, to designate kimchi as only that which is produced in the traditional Korean style. In 2001, the <b>Codex</b> <b>Alimentarius</b> published a voluntary standard defining kimchi as [...] "a fermented food that uses salted napa cabbages as its main ingredient mixed with seasonings, and goes through a lactic acid production process at a low temperature," [...] but which did not specify a minimum amount of fermentation or forbid the use of additives.|$|E
2500|$|According to the <b>Codex</b> <b>Alimentarius</b> Commission of the FAO and WHO: [...] "The term shrimp (which {{includes}} the frequently used term prawn) {{refers to the}} species covered by the most recent edition of the FAO listing of shrimp, FAO Species Catalogue, Volume 1, [...] FAO Fisheries Synopsis No. 125." [...] In turn, the Species Catalogue says the highest category it deals with is [...] "the suborder Natantia of the order Crustacea Decapoda to which all shrimps and prawns belong".|$|E
2500|$|Three {{other efforts}} to improve {{regulation}} of international pesticide trade are the United Nations London Guidelines for the Exchange of Information on Chemicals in International Trade and the United Nations <b>Codex</b> <b>Alimentarius</b> Commission. [...] The former seeks to implement procedures for ensuring that prior informed consent exists between countries buying and selling pesticides, while the latter seeks to create uniform standards for maximum levels of pesticide residues among participating countries. Both initiatives operate on a voluntary basis.|$|E
2500|$|The United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and World Health Organization (WHO) {{have stated}} that the {{guidelines}} are a consumer protection measure [...] "to stop consumers overdosing on vitamin and mineral food supplements."

[...] The WHO has also said that the Guidelines [...] "ensure that consumers receive beneficial health effects from vitamins and minerals." ...|$|E
2500|$|In food use, {{the term}} milk is defined under <b>Codex</b> <b>Alimentarius</b> {{standards}} as: [...] "the normal mammary secretion of milking animals obtained {{from one or}} more milkings without either addition to it or extraction from it, intended for consumption as liquid milk or for further processing." [...] This definition thereby precludes non-animal products which may resemble milk in color and texture (milk substitutes) such as soy milk, rice milk, almond milk, and coconut milk. [...] The correct name for such products are 'soy beverage', 'rice beverage', etc.|$|E
2500|$|The US defines {{irradiated}} foods as {{foods in}} which the irradiation causes a material change in the food, or a material change in the consequences that may result {{from the use of}} the food. Therefore, food that is processed as an ingredient by a restaurant or food processor is exempt from the labeling requirement in the US. This definition is not consistent with the <b>Codex</b> <b>Alimentarius.</b> All irradiated foods must bear a slightly modified Radura symbol at the point of sale and use the term [...] "irradiated" [...] or a derivative there of, in conjunction with explicit language describing the change in the food or its conditions of use.|$|E
2500|$|A 2001 World Health Organization (WHO) {{report found}} that infant formula {{prepared}} in accordance with applicable <b>Codex</b> <b>Alimentarius</b> standards was a safe complementary food and a suitable breast milk substitute. In 2003, the WHO and UNICEF published their Global Strategy for Infant and Young Child Feeding, which restated that [...] "processed-food products for...young children should, when sold or otherwise distributed, meet applicable standards recommended by the <b>Codex</b> <b>Alimentarius</b> Commission", and also warned that [...] "lack of breastfeeding—and especially lack of exclusive breastfeeding during the first half-year of life—are important risk factors for infant and childhood morbidity and mortality". In particular, the use of infant formula in less economically developed countries is linked to poorer health outcomes because of the prevalence of unsanitary preparation conditions, including lack of clean water and lack of sanitizing equipment. UNICEF estimates that a formula-fed child living in unclean conditions is between 6 and 25 {{times more likely to}} die of diarrhea and four times more likely to die of pneumonia than a breastfed child. Rarely, use of powdered infant formula (PIF) has been associated with serious illness, and even death, due to infection with Cronobacter sakazakii and other microorganisms that can be introduced to PIF during its production. [...] Although C. sakazakii can cause illness in all age groups, infants are believed to be at greatest risk of infection. Between 1958 and 2006, there have been several dozen reported cases of E. sakazakii infection worldwide. The WHO believes that such infections are under-reported.|$|E
2500|$|The health-freedom {{movement}} vehemently {{opposes the}} Guidelines for Vitamin and Mineral Food Supplements, {{adopted by the}} <b>Codex</b> <b>Alimentarius</b> Commission as a voluntary standard at its meeting in Rome in July 2005, which includes requirements for the packaging and labelling of vitamin and mineral supplements. The text specifies that [...] "supplements should contain vitamins/provitamins and minerals whose nutritional value for human beings has been proven by scientific data and whose status as vitamins and minerals is recognised by FAO and WHO." [...] In addition, it states that the [...] "sources of vitamins and minerals may be either natural or synthetic" [...] and that [...] "their selection {{should be based on}} considerations such as safety and bioavailability." ...|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Codex</b> <b>Alimentarius</b> Code of Hygienic Practice for Milk {{notes that}} milk {{pasteurization}} {{is designed to}} achieve at least a 5 log10 reduction of Coxiella burnetii. [...] The Code also notes that: “The minimum pasteurization conditions are those having bactericidal effects equivalent to heating every particle of the milk to 72°C for 15 seconds (continuous flow pasteurization) or 63°C for 30 minutes (batch pasteurization)” and that “To ensure that each particle is sufficiently heated, the milk flow in heat exchangers should be turbulent, i.e. the Reynolds number should be sufficiently high.” [...] The point about turbulent flow is important because simplistic laboratory studies of heat inactivation that use test tubes, without flow, will have less bacterial inactivation than larger scale experiments that seek to replicate conditions of commercial pasteurization.|$|E
2500|$|The {{provisions}} of the <b>Codex</b> <b>Alimentarius</b> are that any [...] "first generation" [...] product must be labeled [...] "irradiated" [...] as any product derived directly from an irradiated raw material; for ingredients the provision is that even the last molecule of an irradiated ingredient must be listed with the ingredients even {{in cases where the}} unirradiated ingredient does not appear on the label. The RADURA-logo is optional; several countries use a graphical version that differs from the Codex-version. The suggested rules for labeling is published at CODEX-STAN– 1 (2005), and includes the usage of the Radura symbol for all products that contain irradiated foods. The Radura symbol is not a designator of quality. The amount of pathogens remaining is based upon dose and the original content and the dose applied can vary on a product by product basis.|$|E
2500|$|The use of immunoinformatics tools can {{be useful}} to predict protein {{allergenicity}} and will become increasingly important in the screening of novel foods before their wide-scale release for human use. Thus, there are major efforts under way to make reliable broad based allergy databases and combine these with well validated prediction tools in order to enable the identification of potential allergens in genetically modified drugs and foods. Though the developments are on primary stage, the World Health organization and Food and Agriculture Organization have proposed guidelines for evaluating allergenicity of genetically modified foods. According to the <b>Codex</b> <b>alimentarius,</b> a protein is potentially allergenic if it possesses an identity of ≥6 contiguous amino acids or ≥35% sequence similarity over an 80 amino acid window with a known allergen. Though there are rules, their inherent limitations have started to become apparent and exceptions to the rules have been well reported [...] So to make these things easier computational tools and algorithms have been actively developed to assess the allergenic potential of genetically modified food crops, bio-pharmaceuticals and various other products.|$|E

50|$|Until the Mid 20th Century, the <b>Codex</b> <b>Alimentarius</b> Austriacus was not {{well-known}} {{beyond the}} German-speaking countries of Europe. It subsequently lent {{its name to}} the international <b>Codex</b> <b>Alimentarius</b> Commission, the current international food codex collaboratively worked out by the Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Health Organization. Consisting of three volumes, the Codex was finished sometime between 1910-1917 by O. Dafert. It lacked actual integration into Austrian law until 1975. The idea of a Europe-wide <b>Codex</b> <b>Alimentarius</b> based on the Austrian model was actively pursued by Hans Frenzel of Austria between 1954 and 1958.
