40|$|Purpose: This {{piece of}} {{research}} quantifies and analyses empirically the given economic differences among public service television in Spain {{according to the}} adopted management model (classic or outsourced). Design/methodology/approach: In so doing, an average contrast of different economic variables studied in the literature is conducted (audience share, total assets, public subsidies, <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>personnel,</b> suppliers spending and profit after taxes). In addition, these variables are related so as to calculate productivity obtained by each two groups of television operators. This analysis is conducted for period 2010 - 2013, featured by a crisis context in the Spanish economy. Findings: Management model adopted by each regional broadcaster impacts on different economic variables as obtained share, total assets, public subsidies, <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>personnel,</b> suppliers spending or profit after taxes. Moreover, those public corporations adopting an outsourced management model present better productivity values. Research limitations/implications: Only one country has been analyzed for a 4 years period. Practical implications: Regional public service broadcasters with an outsourced model present less economic losses and require less public subsidies by their corresponding regional governments. Social implications: Outsourcing part of the value chain can be useful {{so as to guarantee}} sustainability of regional public service television.

A basic crew rostering model is extended by introducing constraints that produce a schedule that raises a flight's service quality without causing additional costs.

One example is the ‘Guide on the methodology for carrying out cost-benefit analysis’. Siciliano et al. [4] reviewed and adapted the methodology to assess innovative rail freight services. The research shows that the adapted methodology is capable of representing the multiple effects resulting from the theoretical introduction of an innovative rail service in the freight transport sector – assessing the impact of the proposed new rail freight service compared to the baseline scenario solutions (all-road solutions and regular rail solutions). The research also shows that the logical articulation of the analysis ‘Guide on the methodology for carrying out cost-benefit analysis’ is flexible to some extent. For example, two specific estimation schemes (the estimation of ad hoc unit parameters for the external costs involving emissions, noise and accidents and ad hoc approach for using Generalised Logistic Costs (GLC) as proxies of users’ surplus in a scenario where the introduction of the innovative service modifies the modal split of freight transport between different solutions) were applied to this research.
