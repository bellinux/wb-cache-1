The rice rat eats more animal food than any of those, and perhaps A.forresteri has an intermediate host that is not eaten by the other species. A.forresteri is markedly more prevalent in the wet season (spring) than the dry season (autumn), perhaps because rainfall patterns influence the habits of the rice rat in some way. One possibility is that the intermediate host is an earthworm or other oligochaete worm that moves to the surface when it rains.|$|E

40|$|Abstract - Daytime refuges are {{important}} to nocturnal rodents for protection from predators and environmental extremes. Because refuges of forest-dwelling rodents are often associated with woody debris, we examined refuge use by 37 radio-collared Peromyscus gossypinus (<b>cotton</b> <b>mice)</b> in experimental plots with different levels of woody debris. Treatment plots had six times (≈ 60 m 3 /ha) the volume of woody debris as control plots (≈ 10 m 3 /ha). Of 247 refuges, 159 were in rotting stumps (64 %), 32 were in root boles (13 %), 19 were in brush piles (8 %), and 16 were in logs (6 %); 10 refuges could not be identified. Stumps were the most common refuge type in both treatments, but the distribution of refuge types was significantly different between treatment and control plots. Root boles and brush piles were used more on treatment plots than on control plots, and logs were used more on control plots than on treatment plots. Refuge type and vegetation cover were the best predictors of refuge use by cotton mice; root bole refuges and refuges with less vegetation cover received greater-than-expected use by mice. Abundant refuges, particularly root boles, may improve habitat quality for <b>cotton</b> <b>mice</b> in southeastern pine forests...|$|R

40|$|Studies of {{secondary}} seed dispersal by small mammals {{have largely been}} focused on the interaction between nut-bearing tree species and sciurid rodents such as squirrels, and on heteromyid rodents in the southwestern United States. However, there is now evidence that wind-dispersed tree species such as pines also undergo a process {{of secondary}} seed dispersal, where animals redistribute (cache) seeds that have already fallen to the ground, often in microhabitats more suitable for successful seed germination. In Florida sandhill, where fire suppression has threatened wind-dispersed longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) by encouraging the encroachment of hardwoods such as sand live oak (Quercus geminata), secondary seed dispersal may be an important factor in determining community composition and persistence of longleaf pine systems. Using a combination of seed depots and seed predator exclosures, I looked at both longleaf pine and sand live oak in terms of whether small animals such as squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis) and <b>cotton</b> <b>mice</b> (Peromyscus gossypinus) cache the seeds, and where the seeds of these two tree species best germinate. Since sand live oak acorns are prone to infestation by weevils (Curculio spp.), I also examined whether nut condition affects acorn germination potential. I found that longleaf pine seeds are cached by small mammals to a small degree. While these seeds are not moved great distances from where they originate, they are often redistributed into microhabitats that promote successful seed germination. Caging experiments indicated that seeds were most likely to germinate when buried in open areas between adult trees, and to some degree, under shrub cover. On the other hand, sand live oak acorns appear to face heavy predation by large seed predators such as raccoons (Procyon lotor) and wild pigs (Sus scrofa). Those acorns that do escape predation, including weevil-infested acorns, may provide an opportunity for seedling establishment. However, it appears that sand live oak depends heavily on vegetative sprouting for regeneration. This suggests that {{even in the absence of}} fire, longleaf pines in Florida sandhill are able to persist through secondary seed dispersal by small animals coupled with heavy seed predation on competing sand live oak...|$|R
