5|$|Bivalves {{vary greatly}} in overall shape. Some, {{such as the}} <b>cockles,</b> have shells that are nearly globular; <b>cockles</b> can jump by bending and {{straightening}} their foot. Others, such as the razor clams, are burrowing specialists with elongated shells and a powerful foot adapted for rapid digging. The shipworms, in the family Teredinidae have greatly elongated bodies, but their shell valves are much reduced and restricted to the anterior end of the body, where they function as scraping organs that permit the animal to dig tunnels through wood.|$|E

5|$|Bivalves {{have been}} an {{important}} source of food for humans at least since Roman times and empty shells found in middens at archaeological sites are evidence of earlier consumption. Oysters, scallops, clams, ark clams, mussels and <b>cockles</b> are the most commonly consumed kinds of bivalve, and are eaten cooked or raw. In 1950, the year in which the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) started making such information available, world trade in bivalve molluscs was 1,007,419 tons. By 2010, world trade in bivalves had risen to 14,616,172 tons, up from 10,293,607 tons a decade earlier. The figures included 5,554,348 (3,152,826) tons of clams, <b>cockles</b> and ark shells, 1,901,314 (1,568,417) tons of mussels, 4,592,529 (3,858,911) tons of oysters and 2,567,981 (1,713,453) tons of scallops. China increased its consumption 400-fold during the period 1970 to 1997.|$|E

40|$|Cow <b>cockle</b> (Vaccaria hispanica (Mill.) Rauschert) is an {{important}} medicinal weed. Its therapeutic properties are due to present of triterpenoid saponins. Large potential exists to use cow <b>cockle</b> as source of pharmaceutical products or as medicinal plant. Cow <b>cockle</b> seedlings are very cold tolerance. A limiting factor in cow <b>cockle</b> production is weed interference. Cow <b>cockle</b> crop can tolerate clethodim and isoxaflutole herbicides. Cow <b>cockle</b> responds strongly to nitrogen fertilization. Harvest occurred 90 - 100 days after sowing. Moreover, {{a number of different}} genotypes are available. The wild populations from different geographical regions constitute a gene pool that can be utilized for the improvement of cow <b>cockle</b> crop.

At the first stage of the experimental work, mixes containing various percentage of crushed <b>cockle</b> shell as partial sand replacement were prepared in form of cubes and then water cured. Based on the compressive strength test conducted, only the best performing mix containing <b>cockle</b> shell were used to produce brick for the second stage of the work. The bricks were subjected to water curing until the testing age. The compressive strength test was carried out at 7 and 28 days. The findings show that the compressive strength of the mix increases when suitable content of crushed <b>cockle</b> shell is used. Addition of suitable content of crushed <b>cockle</b> shell up to 20 % successfully enhances the compressive strength of the mortar mix.

25|$|Grey {{described}} his men killing 40 or 50 French soldiers {{and others who}} came out of the town to gather <b>cockles</b> and periwinkles on 13 May. The French journalist wrote of the same event, relating that some of the hungry townspeople went out to collect shell-fish and were attacked by the English. A little French boy taken on the shore was brought to Grey of Wilton. When asked if they had enough food for a fortnight, the boy said he had heard the captains say the English would not take the town by famine or force for four or five months yet.
