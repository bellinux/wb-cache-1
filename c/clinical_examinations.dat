40|$|Purpose of review: In {{the acute}} setting of circulatory shock, {{physicians}} largely depend on <b>clinical</b> <b>examination</b> and basic laboratory values. The daily use of <b>clinical</b> <b>examination</b> for diagnostic purposes contrasts sharp with {{the limited number}} of studies. We aim to provide an overview of the diagnostic accuracy of <b>clinical</b> <b>examination</b> in estimating circulatory shock reflected by an inadequate cardiac output (CO). Recent findings: Recent studies showed poor correlations between CO and mottling, capillary refill time or central-to-peripheral temperature gradients in univariable analyses. The accuracy of physicians to perform an educated guess of CO based on <b>clinical</b> <b>examination</b> lies around 50 % and the accuracy for recognizing a low CO is similar. Studies that used predefined clinical profiles composed of several <b>clinical</b> <b>examination</b> signs show more reliable estimations of CO with accuracies ranging from 81 up to 100 %. Summary: Single variables obtained by <b>clinical</b> <b>examination</b> should not be used when estimating CO. Physician's educated guesses of CO based on unstructured <b>clinical</b> <b>examination</b> are like the flip of a coin'. Structured <b>clinical</b> <b>examination</b> based on combined clinical signs shows the best accuracy. Future studies should focus on using a combination of signs in an unselected population, eventually to educate physicians in estimating CO by using predefined clinical profiles...|$|R
40|$|Background: Developmental {{dysplasia}} of hip (DDH) {{is one of}} the congenital anomalies in newborns that if not diagnosed {{and treated}} on time can lead to a severe disability. Although <b>clinical</b> <b>examination</b> is a very useful way for screening, but in some patients, a confirmatory diagnostic method such as ultrasonography is needed. The aim of the present study is to compare the sensitivity and specificity of <b>clinical</b> <b>examination</b> and ultrasonography in early detecting of DDH. Materials and Methods: A total of 5800 of newborns were examined by orthopedic surgeon as a screening method. The newborns with risk factors or suspicious on <b>clinical</b> <b>examination</b> were introduced to repeat <b>clinical</b> and ultrasonographic <b>examination</b> of hip. The results were collected and recorded by a check list and then the sensitivity and specificity of <b>clinical</b> <b>examination</b> were calculated. Results: Of 5701 newborns (11402 hips) who were studied by two methods of <b>clinical</b> <b>examination</b> and ultrasonography (by Graf method), the overall incidence of DDH was 29 per 1000. Only 94 hips (13. 5 %) of 694 disordered ones according to <b>clinical</b> <b>examination</b> were involved on ultrasonographic evaluation. A total of 240 hips of 334 (72 %) involved hips according to ultrasonography (Graf type IIb or more) were diagnosed normal on <b>clinical</b> <b>examination,</b> considering ultrasonography as a gold standard method of evaluating DDH, the sensitivity and specificity of <b>clinical</b> <b>examination</b> were calculated 28. 1 % and 94. 5 %, respectively. Conclusion: According to the present study, ultrasonogeraphic examination has a high valuable in screening of DDH and the <b>clinical</b> <b>examination</b> done by an experienced orthopedic surgeon has an acceptable value in primary screening of DDH in developing countries for detecting of healthy neonates, but if the newborn has a risk factor or is suspicious on <b>clinical</b> <b>examination,</b> {{it will be necessary to}} get assistance from ultrasonography by an experienced sonographer...|$|R

2500|$|However, {{despite his}} paper being widely {{reported}} by the media, an undermining error, according to teams of other epidemiologists who point out Tsuda's remarks are fatally wrong, is that Tsuda did an apples and oranges comparison by comparing the Fukushima surveys, which uses advanced ultrasound devices that detect otherwise unnoticeable thyroid growths, with data from traditional non-advanced <b>clinical</b> <b>examinations,</b> to arrive at his [...] "20 to 50 times what would be expected" [...] conclusion.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{compare the}} work-related {{limitations}} assessed using self-report, <b>clinical</b> <b>examination</b> and functional testing {{in patients with}} chronic low back pain (CLBP). METHODS: Work-related limitations of 92 patients were assessed using self-report, <b>clinical</b> <b>examination</b> and functional testing. To obtain the assessed limitations the patient (self-report), the physician (<b>clinical</b> <b>examination)</b> and a trained evaluator (functional testing) completed a scorings form about the work-related limitations of the patient. The Isernhagen Work Systems Functional Capacity Evaluation (IWS FCE) was used to obtain the functional testing results. A kappa value of more than 0. 60, absolute agreement of more than 80 % and ICC of more than 0. 75 were considered as acceptable. RESULTS: Little agreement and correlation among self-report, <b>clinical</b> <b>examination</b> and functional testing were found {{for the assessment of}} work-related limitations.

The aims of this study were first to investigate the frequency and distribution of finger flexor tenosynovitis using ultrasound in early arthritis, second to compare <b>clinical</b> <b>examination</b> with ultrasound (US) using the latter as the gold standard. Methods 33 consecutive patients who had who were initially diagnosed with polyarthritis and suspected of polyarthritis and clinical suspicion of inflammatory arthritis of the hands and wrists were assessed during consecutive, routine presentations to the rheumatology outpatient clinic. We scanned a total of 165 finger tendons and subsequent comparisons were made using <b>clinical</b> <b>examination.</b> Results Flexor tenosynovitis was found in 17 patients (51. 5 %) on ultrasound compared with 16 (48. 4 %) of all patients on <b>clinical</b> <b>examination.</b> Most commonly damaged joint involved on US was the second finger followed by the third, fifth, and fourth. Both modalities demonstrated more pathology on the second and third metacarpophalangeal (MCP) compared with the fourth and fifth MCP. A joint-by-joint comparison of US and <b>clinical</b> <b>examination</b> demonstrated that although the sensitivity, specificities and positive predictive values of <b>clinical</b> <b>examination</b> were relatively high, negative predictive value of <b>clinical</b> <b>examination</b> was low (0. 23). Conclusions Our study suggest that <b>clinical</b> <b>examination</b> can be a valuable tool for detecting flexor disease in view of its high specificity and positive predictive values, but a negative <b>clinical</b> <b>examination</b> does not exclude inflammation and an US should be considered.
