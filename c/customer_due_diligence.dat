40|$|Mergers and {{acquisitions}} (M&A) {{have become an}} important strategy for international expansion, even though numerous acquisitions fail to achieve their financial and strategic objectives. The risk associated with transactions partly depends {{on the extent to}} which the insight into the target company actually holds true. <b>Due</b> <b>diligence</b> is performed to eliminate this information asymmetry. <b>Due</b> <b>diligence</b> is an audit conducted prior to the planned transaction. It can be described as a purposeful and systematic investigation of business opportunity and risk during on-going sale negotiations. The importance of <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> is emphasized widely in the academic literature as well as among M&A practitioners. On the other hand, researches and practitioners have differing views on what and how much is enough for a <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> audit. Therefore, this study examines the role of <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> in a cross-border acquisition process. The main objective of the research is fulfilled by examining the reasons for conducting <b>due</b> <b>diligence,</b> recognizing the elements affecting effective <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> and analyzing the need and opportunities for enhancing the utilization of <b>due</b> <b>diligence.</b> For the empirical part of this qualitative study five expert interviews were conducted among experienced Finnish acquirers and advisors. In addition, five expert interviews conducted for a distinct study were utilized as a secondary source of data. The results of this study present fundamental reasons for conducting <b>due</b> <b>diligence.</b> However, conducting <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> is not always self-evident. Doubtful attitude towards <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> exists, though it is exceptional. Carefully planning the focus of <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> and compiling and managing the team conducting <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> are identified as the main elements affecting effective <b>due</b> <b>diligence.</b> Altogether, <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> can have plural roles which in this study are categorized as the confirmatory, preparative, and cross-functional roles of <b>due</b> <b>diligence.</b> The older academic literature tends to emphasize the confirmatory role whereas the current academic discussion also supports the preparative role of <b>due</b> <b>diligence.</b> It can be argued that the roles of <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> differ among experienced <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> practitioners based on several factors. In attempt to increase the value of <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> for acquirers, more than one role of <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> is likely to exist.

40|$|Cambridge University Press 2013. In {{the context}} of {{corporate}} accountability, <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> and complicity are two important concepts. The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> as ‘the care that a reasonable person exercises to avoid harm to other persons or their property’. In the business context, <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> refers to the ‘research and analysis of a company or organization done {{in preparation for a}} business transaction’, or the ‘duty of a firm’s directors and officers to act prudently in evaluating associated risks in all transactions’. Complicity, on the other hand, is described as ‘association or participation in… a wrongful act’. <b>Due</b> <b>diligence</b> and complicity are thus different notions. This chapter will explore the various possible connections between these two concepts. Questions arising in this respect include, for example, whether the assessment and avoidance of the risk of complicity is part of a company’s <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> responsibility. If so, can complicity liability arise even though the company acted with <b>due</b> <b>diligence,</b> but harm nevertheless occurs? And can <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> responsibilities help to define the elements of complicity liability, with regard to both the question of which acts might result in liability of the company for third party wrongdoing, and which mental element is necessary in order to hold the corporation to account in such circumstances?
