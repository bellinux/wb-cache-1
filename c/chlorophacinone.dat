5000|$|Poisoning, both {{intentional}} and unintentional, {{is perhaps}} the most insidious man-made threat to golden eagles. The usual targets of carrion-poisoning are species such as coyotes, red fox and gray wolves, which are considered pest that threaten livestock (a charge usually vastly exaggerated by the human imagination). However, golden eagles are occasionally targeted as well for the same reasons. The main cause of mortality for golden eagles in Britain has been poisoning, with a number of 51 eagles verified to be killed by poisoning from 1980 to 2008 probably being far lower than the actual amount killed as such. A disproportionate amount of golden eagle poisonings in Scotland from 1981 to 2000 were linked to grouse moors (where grouse are kept for the pleasure of shooting) and were probably cases of gamekeepers deliberately poisoning eagles and foxes to keep their stock of grouse high. It is estimated that the adult survival rate is reduced by 3 to 5% in Scotland by intentional poisonings. In the 1980s, California ground squirrels, due to the perception among cattle rangers that they are agricultural pests, were poisoned by the anticoagulant rodenticide, <b>Chlorophacinone.</b> In turn, the poisonings caused golden eagles, as one of the major natural predator of California ground squirrels, to die in turn. At least 10 individuals died in 1971 from eating Thallium(I) sulfate-laced pronghorn set out by sheep ranchers in Wyoming; despite public outcries, poisoning by sheep ranchers continued into the 1980s. In the 20th century, organochloride and heavy metal poisonings were also commonplace, but these have declined thanks to tighter regulations on pollution. In southern Idaho, 10 out of 17 golden eagles examined were found to have had exposure to lead. As a whole, the golden eagle is less susceptible than most raptors to organochlorine pesticides because of mammal-feeding habits, as opposed to predominantly bird-eating species like peregrine falcons and fish-eating species like bald eagles, both of which had huge population declines in the 20th century due to the use of pesticides like DDT [...] Eggs from golden eagle nests that were collected after 1946 in North America had shell thicknesses similar to (of less than a 10% difference) those collected in earlier years. However, in Scotland egg shell thickness did decrease by around 10% from 1951 to 1965. A dead golden eagle collected on the island of Lewis had the highest concentration of organochlorine known from a modern bird in Scotland. The higher effects of organochlorines in Scotland {{may be due to the}} fact that birds there consume a relatively high quantity of seabirds, as opposed to North America, where this practice is rare.|$|E

40|$|The {{mountain}} beaver (Aplodontia rufa) is a fossorialrodent species endemic to the Pacific Northwest and portions of California. This herbivore inflicts {{millions of dollars}} of damage annually to forest seedling plantations. Currently, extensive trapping prior to planting is the most reliable method for reducing damage. With increasing restrictions placed on trapping, forest resource managers need alternative tools to minimize forest damage. This study assessed the potential of four toxicants registered for underground use to control{{mountain beaver}}; zinc phosphide, diphacinone, <b>chlorophacinone,</b> and strychnine. Zinc phosphide and strychnine are acute toxicants, whereas diphacinone and <b>chlorophacinone</b> are anticoagulants. Anticoagulants prevent the recycling of vitamin K in the body, which inhibits the production of clotting factors. Efficacy varied among treatments. Zinc phosphide and strychnine were avoided by mountain beaver. Pre-baiting marginally increased acceptance of strychnine, but did not alter mountain beaver acceptance of zinc phosphide. Diphacinone and <b>chlorophacinone</b> were both readily consumed, but only <b>chlorophacinone</b> was 100 % effective after a 14 -day baiting regime. Subsequently, we tested the effects of diet on the efficacy of diphacinone by varying the availability of food containing vitamin K, the anticoagulant antidote. Restricting access to potential sources of vitamin K appeared to increase efficacy. We conclude that anticoagulants hold some promise as additional tools for managers to reduce mountain beaver populations with <b>chlorophacinone</b> showing the most promise. However, limitations to anticoagulant baits include the necessity of long-term baiting (greater than 10 days), a possible decrease in toxicity if baits contact moisture, and potential primary hazards...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Secondary {{toxicity}} in {{mammals and}} birds that consume animals containing residues of anticoagulant rodenticides represents a persistent conflict between conservation, agriculture and environmental contamination. <b>Chlorophacinone</b> residues in black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) represent a secondary exposure hazard to predatory and scavenging avian and mammalian {{species in the}} Central Plains of the United States, especially considering efforts to re-establish black-footed ferrets (Mustela nigripes). Rozol® Prairie Dog Bait (<b>chlorophacinone</b> 0. 005 %) is registered to control black-tailed prairie dogs in ten states throughout themidwestern and western United States. RESULTS:We fed Rozol Prairie Dog Bait to captive black-tailed prairie dogs for 2 days and analyzed their livers and whole bodies (without livers) for <b>chlorophacinone</b> residue on days 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 14, 18 and 27 post-exposure. We found the greatest levels of residues in livers (x = 5. 499 mgkg− 1) and whole bodies (x = 1. 281 mgkg− 1) on day 3. Residues in both tissues declined rapidly over time,with estimated half-lives of approximately 6 days post-exposure. However, a risk assessment of secondary toxicity to non-targetmammals indicated acute risks for mammalian species up to 27 days post-exposure and negligible risks for birds. CONCLUSION: The {{results suggest that the}} greatest risk of secondary toxicity occurs ≤ 14 days post-application of Rozol Prairie Dog Bait and declines thereafter. This corresponds to the timewhen <b>chlorophacinone</b> residues are high, and prairie dogs exhibit signs of intoxication and are perhapsmost susceptible to predation and scavenging. These results confirm that Rozol PrairieDog Bait should not be used in areas where black-footed ferrets or other sensitive species occur...|$|E

40|$|Voles {{can cause}} {{significant}} losses to agriculture and wood fibre production. California growers typically rely on baits containing <b>chlorophacinone</b> and diphacinone to reduce vole population densities, but {{the efficacy of}} those rodenticides has been decreasing. One hypothesis suggests that voles are consuming high levels of an antidote (vitamin K 1) to the anticoagulants, contained within green leafy plants. We tested that hypothesis by first feeding Montane Voles (Microtus montanus) diets that were high in vitamin K 1, and then providing the animals with either: (1) chlorophacinone-containing bait, (2) diphacinone-containing bait, or (3) a control diet. We found that the chlorophacinone-containing bait remained efficacious (100 % mortality), whereas the diphacinone-containing bait had a much lower efficacy (60 % mortality). When only the diphacinone-containing bait was presented, the efficacy was somewhat better (80 %). We infer that a diet rich in vitamin K 1 did not negate {{the effects of the}} <b>chlorophacinone</b> for voles, and so we recommend its continued use in California unless anticoagulant resistance is known to have developed in the vole population. We hypothesise that: (1) diphacinone has a relatively low efficacy against Montane Voles when compared to <b>chlorophacinone,</b> and (2) this lower efficacy could be further reduced by a vitamin K 1 -rich diet...|$|E
40|$|The {{mountain}} beaver is a fossorial rodent species endemic to the Pacific Northwest and portions of California. This herbivore is managed as a pest species {{because of the}} impact it has on newly planted Douglas-fir seedlings. Currently, managers are limited to trapping for population control; however, in Washington trapping has been further curtailed by anti-trapping legislation. Presently there are no registered underground toxicants for {{mountain beaver}} control. We have documented the efficacy of <b>chlorophacinone,</b> presented in daily doses, as a possible alternative for mountain beaver control.

The crystal structures of the two compounds {{have been used as}} input geometries for a series of computational chemistry efforts, involving other anticoagulant derivatives as well. Thus, ab initio, semiempirical molecular orbital, molecular mechanics and molecular dynamics/simulated annealing calculations have been performed on thirteen anticoagulant rodenticides. In particular, the annealing calculations have been made to assess the conformational freedom of the compounds under scrutiny. All the generated conformers have been classified into families. The classification has first been made empirically, and then validated by means of a cluster analysis. A number of structural and physico-chemical parameters derived from the calculations has been used in turn for structure-activity relationships (SARs) investigations. In the latter, we have assessed how the selected parameters affect toxicity. The results seem to be consistent with a three-dimensional biophore model, in which higher toxicity is predicted for the more voluminous rodenticides.

In general, the most practical and cost-effective control method for rodents in many agricultural environments is the use of rodenticides (toxic baits), but little or no information exists on the efficacy of current rodenticides in controlling roof rats and deer mice in orchards. Therefore, our goals were to develop an index of rodent activity to monitor efficacy of rodenticides and to subsequently test the efficacy of three California Department of Food and Agriculture rodenticide baits (0. 005 % <b>chlorophacinone</b> treated oats, 0. 005 % diphacinone treated oats, and 0. 005 % diphacinone wax block) to determine their utility for controlling roof rats and deer mice in agricultural orchards. We determined that a general index using the number of roof rat photos taken at a minimum of a 5 -min interval was strongly correlated to the minimum number known estimate of roof rats; this approach was used to monitor roof rat and deer mouse populations pre- and post-treatment. Of the baits tested, the 0. 005 % diphacinone treated oats was most effective for both species; 0. 005 % <b>chlorophacinone</b> grain was completely ineffective against roof rats.

Hence, if translocation were to occur, the elements—-not the parent compound—-would be the likely candidates. Finally, radioactive (14 C) braomdiolone was tested for translocatability. From the preliminary data developed to the date of this report, little, if any, translocation occurs...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of Cornell University 2 ̆ 7 s research {{program is to}} develop a successful integrated system to control pine and meadow vole damage in the apple orchards of the Hudson Valley. This is being accomplished by determining the effect of habitat manipulation and rodenticides on vole populations. We are also doing research to quantify the amount of damage apple trees sustain from various densities of pine voles. By coupling the results of these two avenues of research, we hope to provide growers with a cost-effective pest management plan. Efficacy of <b>Chlorophacinone</b> (Chempar, Inc.) and Brodificoum (ICI Americas, Inc.) in various populations and treatments were evaluated in 1980 and 1980 (Table I) ...|$|E
40|$|During {{autumn of}} 1978 and 1979 the New York Cooperative Wildlife Research Unit {{continued}} its program {{of research and}} management aimed at the pine vole (Pitymys pinetorum) and meadow vole (Microtus pennsylvanicus). Two herbicides, Ammate-X (E. I. Dupont de Nemours) and Kerb (Rhom S Haas Corp.) along with 4 candidate rodenticides, Bromadiolone and <b>Chlorophacinone</b> (Chempar Inc.), Volak (I. C. I. Chemicals Inc.) and zinc phosphide (Bell Laboratories Inc.) were tested in both orchard and laboratory situations. This work is being conducted {{in conjunction with a}} separate research unit project aimed at evaluating the potential of using populations of the larger meadow vole to limit the invasion and success of the smaller but more troublesome pine vole. This biological control aspect will be treated in a separate manuscript...|$|E
40|$|During {{the period}} from 1980 to 1985 the {{laboratory}} of toxicological analysis associated with the National Veterinary Antipoison Center received 1, 343 samples for research of anticoagulant rodenticide (e. g., 14. 1 % of total samples) : 79 % concerned animals, 31 % baits. Six compounds marketed in France were investigated (warfarin, <b>chlorophacinone,</b> bromadiolone, difenacoum, coumachlore, coumatetralyl). In two-thirds of the samples, none of these substances could be found. Warfarin {{was by far the}} most incriminated rodenticide (23. 1 %), and dogs represented the most affected species (65. 7 %). However, its occurrence decreases regularly. The other compounds were found with a very low frequency (1 to 3 %). In 70 % of the cases, baits were prepared with criminal intention of killing animals other than rodents...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{cultivation}} {{three times}} a year (May, July, and November) or cultivation plus a residual herbicide twice a year (July and November) greatly aided in the control of pine voles Microtus pinetorum (LeConte) in apple orchards. The use of <b>Chlorophacinone</b> (CPN) or Diphacinone (DPN) baits placed by hand in holes and runs 2 - 3 weeks after the November cultivation resulted in a very effective control procedure. Without cultivation at least two applications of anticoagulant baits at the rate of 10 lbs/acre each were required to insure adequate control. Due to low apple prices in 1975, large numbers of dropped apples existed under trees when apple and prepared hand baits were applied. We believe dropped apples interfered with control achieved with toxic baits...|$|E
40|$|Very {{effective}} {{control of the}} short-tailed meadow mice (Microtus spp.) was obtained by means of grass and weed spraying in two orchards with <b>Chlorophacinone.</b> This toxin was applied in one orchard with a boom-type tractor sprayer and in another orchard with a hand-gun nozzle operated from the tractor manually. The anti-coagulant rodenticide in each orchard was mixed in spray tanks {{at the rate of}} one pint per 100 gallons water. Spray was directed to an area two feet on each side of apple tree rows applying six pints of the concentrate per treated acre. A five-foot strip of dense grassy area bordering the orchards was also sprayed to prevent mouse invasion. We found no injurious affect to wildlife or domestic animals that were in the vicinity of orchards following toxicant treatment...|$|E
