60|$|Boyd Dawkins {{believes}} that the park-cattle are descended from anciently domesticated, and not truly wild animals; and from the occasional appearance of dark-coloured calves, it is improbable that the aboriginal Bos primigenius was white. It is curious what a strong, though not invariable, tendency there is in wild or escaped cattle to become white with coloured ears, under widely different conditions of life. If the old writers Boethius and Leslie (3/52. Boethius was born in 1470; 'Annals and Mag. of Nat. Hist.' volume 2 1839 page 281; and volume 4 1849 page 424.) can be trusted, the wild cattle of Scotland were white and furnished with a great mane; but the colour of their ears is not mentioned. In Wales (3/53. 'Youatt on Cattle' 1834 page 48: See also page 242, on shorthorn <b>cattle.</b> <b>Bell</b> in his 'British Quadrupeds' page 423 states that, after long attending to the subject, he has found that white cattle invariably have coloured ears.), during the tenth century, some of the cattle are described as being white with red ears. Four hundred cattle thus coloured were sent to King John; and an early record speaks of a hundred cattle with red ears having been demanded as a compensation for some offence, but, if the cattle were of a dark or black colour, 150 were to be presented. The black cattle of North Wales apparently belong, as we have seen, to the small longifrons type: and as the alternative was offered of either 150 dark cattle, or 100 white cattle with red ears, {{we may presume that}} the latter were the larger beasts, and probably belonged to the primigenius type. Youatt has remarked that at the present day, whenever cattle of the shorthorn breed are white, the extremities of their ears are more or less tinged with red.|$|E
60|$|<b>Cattle</b> <b>Bells,</b> in {{countries}} {{where they can be}} used without danger, should always be taken; it adds greatly to the cheerfulness and gregariousness of the animals--mules positively require them. Hard wood is sonorous enough for bells.|$|R
50|$|The Llanrwst Bell {{has been}} {{described}} as an old funeral bell and, according to Geraldus Cambrensis was in use about 450 AD. The bells, from Ireland, were originally used as <b>cattle</b> <b>bells</b> but later adapted for ecclesiastical purposes.|$|R
60|$|VERA (rising {{and going}} to the door). I don't know, Father; it is not like the <b>cattle</b> <b>bells,</b> or I would think Nicholas had come from the fair. Oh!

Oh! don't let them in, Father; I couldn't look at them.|$|R
60|$|Victoria {{loved to}} sit in that balcony, a book lying {{neglected}} in her lap, listening to the summer sounds: the tinkle of distant <b>cattle</b> <b>bells,</b> the bass note of a hurrying bee, the strangely compelling song of the hermit-thrush, which made her breathe quickly; the summer wind, stirring wantonly, was prodigal with perfumes gathered from the pines and the sweet June clover {{in the fields and}} the banks of flowers; in the distance, across the gentle foreground of the hills, Sawanec beckoned--did Victoria but raise her eyes!--to a land of enchantment.|$|R
2500|$|Despite being a {{well-known}} artifact of the Yayoi era, {{the concept of}} dotaku did not initially originate in Japan. According to several studies, these bells {{are thought to be}} derived from [...] "earlier, smaller Korean examples that adorned horses and other domesticated animals", from Chinese <b>cattle</b> <b>bells,</b> or Han Chinese zhong, which were bells without clappers used for composing ritual music. However, further studies show that the Yayoi did not have cattle farms, and although several dotaku do have suspension rings and clappers, they make [...] "muffled tones" [...] or [...] "rattling sounds" [...] when struck, suggesting that they were not meant to be rung. [...] Therefore, any bells from China were imported as ritual objects.|$|R
60|$|Then {{his mind}} {{flew back to}} Agnes. Would she see it? She was at work, getting breakfast, but he hoped she had time to see it. He was in that mood so common to him now, when he could not fully enjoy any sight or sound unless he could share it with her. Far down the road he heard the sharp clatter of a wagon. The roosters were calling near and far, in many keys and tunes. The dogs were barking, <b>cattle</b> <b>bells</b> jangling in the wooded pastures, and as the youth passed farmhouses, lights in the kitchen windows showed that the women were astir about breakfast, {{and the sound of}} voices and curry-combs at the barn told that the men were at their daily chores.|$|R

60|$|But {{in spite}} of this heat from above and below, doing one on both sides, Calistoga was a {{pleasant}} place to dwell in; beautifully green, for it was then that favoured moment in the Californian year, when the rains are over and the dusty summer has not yet set in; often visited by fresh airs, now from the mountain, now across Sonoma from the sea; very quiet, very idle, very silent but for the breezes and the <b>cattle</b> <b>bells</b> afield. And there was something satisfactory in the sight of that great mountain that enclosed us to the north: whether it stood, robed in sunshine, quaking to its topmost pinnacle with the heat and brightness of the day; or whether it set itself to weaving vapours, wisp after wisp growing, trembling, fleeting, and fading in the blue.|$|R

6000|$|... § 11. Now just {{so far as}} the old {{bridge at}} Lucerne, with the pure, deep, and blue water of the Reuss eddying down between its piers, and with the sweet {{darkness}} of green hills, and far-away gleaming of lake and Alps alternating upon the eye on either side; and the gloomy lesson frowning in the shadow, as if the deep tone of a passing-bell, overhead, were mingling for ever with the plashing of the river as it glides by beneath; just so far, I say, as this differs from the straight and smooth strip of level dust, between two rows of round-topped acacia trees, wherein the inhabitants of an English watering-place or French fortified town take their delight,--so far I believe the life of the old Lucernois, with all its happy waves of light, and mountain strength of will, and solemn expectation of eternity, to have differed from the generality of the lives of those who saunter for their habitual hour up and down the modern promenade. But the gloom is not always of this noble kind. As we penetrate farther among the hills we shall find it becoming very painful. We are walking, perhaps, in a summer afternoon, up the valley of Zermatt (a German valley), the sun shining brightly on grassy knolls and through fringes of pines, the goats leaping happily, and the <b>cattle</b> <b>bells</b> ringing sweetly, and the snowy mountains shining like heavenly castles far above. We see, a little way off, a small white chapel, sheltered behind one of the flowery hillocks of mountain turf; and we approach its little window, thinking to look through it into some quiet home of prayer; but the window is grated with iron, and open to the winds, and when we look through it, behold--a heap of white human bones mouldering into whiter dust! ...|$|R

50|$|The {{earliest}} {{archaeological evidence}} of bells {{dates back to}} more than 5000 years ago, from the 3rd millennium BC in Neolithic China. During this era, {{there is evidence of}} early forms of pottery cowbells, which were likely used to track goats, sheep, and <b>cattle.</b> The pottery <b>bells</b> were later replaced by metal bells. In West Asia, the first bells appeared in 1000 BC. The earliest metal bells, one found in the Taosi site, and four in the Erlitou site, are dated to about 2000 BC.|$|R

6000|$|When an American {{arrives at}} a new town it is his bounden duty to [...] "take it in." [...] California swung his coat over his {{shoulder}} with the gesture of a man used to long tramps, and together, at eight in the evening, we explored The Dalles. The sun had not yet set, {{and it would be}} light for at least another hour. All the inhabitants seemed to own a little villa and one church apiece. The young men were out walking with the young maidens, the old folks were sitting on the front steps,--not the ones that led to the religiously shuttered best drawing-room, but the side-front-steps,--and the husbands and wives were tying back pear trees or gathering cherries. A scent of hay reached me, and in the stillness we could hear the <b>cattle</b> <b>bells</b> as the cows came home across the lava-sprinkled fields. California swung down the wooden pavements, audibly criticising the housewives' hollyhocks and the more perfect ways of pear-grafting, and, as the young men and maidens passed, giving quaint stories of his youth. I felt that I knew all the people aforetime, I was so interested in them and their life. A woman hung over a gate talking to another woman, and as I passed I heard her say, [...] "skirts," [...] and again, [...] "skirts," [...] and [...] "I'll send you over the pattern"; and I knew they were talking dress. We stumbled upon a young couple saying good-by in the twilight, and [...] "When shall I see you again?" [...] quoth he; and I understood that to the doubting heart the tiny little town we paraded in twenty minutes might be as large as all London and as impassable as an armed camp. I gave them both my blessing, because [...] "When shall I see you again?" [...] is a question that lies very near to hearts of all the world. The last garden gate shut with a click that travelled far down the street, and the lights of the comfortable families began to shine in the confidingly uncurtained windows.|$|R
50|$|In 1854, Chisum became {{engaged in}} the cattle {{business}} {{and became one of}} the first to send his herds to New Mexico Territory. He obtained land along the Pecos River by right of occupancy and eventually became the owner of a large ranch in the Bosque Grande, about forty miles south of Fort Sumner, with over 100,000 head of cattle. In 1866-67, Chisum formed a partnership with cattlemen Charles Goodnight and Oliver Loving to assemble and drive herds of cattle for sale to the United States Army in Fort Sumner and Santa Fe, New Mexico, to provide cattle to miners in Colorado as well as provide <b>cattle</b> to the <b>Bell</b> Ranch.|$|R
30|$|In {{terms of}} better {{understanding}} livestock-wildlife interactions in East African savannahs, {{a starting point}} is the reality that different types of animals eat different types of forage (du Toit 2011). Species such as giraffe, gerenuk, kudu, and domestic goats are browsers, eating leaves from trees and bushes, whereas species such as wildebeest, zebra, buffalo, gazelle, and <b>cattle</b> are grazers. <b>Bell</b> (1971), based on research {{carried out in the}} Serengeti, describes a process of ‘grazing succession’ whereby different species of wild ungulates, such as wildebeest and zebra, progressively move through a grazing area. The diversity of grazing ungulates that exists in East Africa is possible because different species can co-exist without directly competing for grazing since their feeding preferences are different. For example, zebra eat taller, more coarse grass while wildebeest, as well as smaller grazers such as gazelle, are more selective and efficient grazers (antelopes and gazelle, unlike zebra, are ruminants and have much more efficient digestive systems) preferring shorter swards of grass. This enables wildebeest to graze areas that zebra have already passed through and grazed over initially, and in this way, zebra may facilitate grazing by wildebeest and other more selective grazers including cattle (du Toit 2011).|$|R
