40|$|The {{variation}} in maturity at harvest during grain filling {{has a major}} effect on the carbohydrate composition (starch:NDF ratio) and fatty acid (FA) content of <b>corn</b> <b>silages,</b> and can alter the FA composition of milk fat in dairy cows. This study evaluated the effect of <b>silage</b> <b>corn</b> (cv.

Sixty-four multiparous Holstein-Friesian dairy cows in their first week of lactation {{were assigned to the}} 8 dietary treatments according to a randomized complete block design. The 8 dietary treatments consisted of a factorial combination of the 4 <b>corn</b> <b>silages</b> and the 2 concentrates. <b>Corn</b> <b>silages</b> were offered ad libitum as part of a basal forage mixture, whereas the concentrates were given at the rate of 8. 5 kg of DM/cow per day during the 15 -wk experimental period. Dry matter, crude protein, and energy intakes did not differ across the <b>corn</b> <b>silages.</b> However, the intake of starch increased, and those of NDF and C 18 : 3 n- 3 decreased with increasing maturation. Milk yield and composition were not different across the <b>corn</b> <b>silages.</b> Yield (kg/d) of milk, protein, and lactose was higher for low-degradable carbohydrate compared with HC concentrate-fed groups. Increasing maturity of <b>corn</b> <b>silages</b> decreased the content of C 18 : 3 n- 3 and total n- 3 and increased the n- 6 :n- 3 ratio in milk fat. Concentrate type significantly altered the composition of all trans FA, except C 18 : 2 trans- 9, 12. Inclusion of the HC concentrate in the diets increased the contents of all C 18 : 1 trans isomers, C 18 : 2 cis- 9,trans- 11, and C 18 : 2 trans- 10,cis- 12 conjugated linoleic acid in milk fat. Milk fat composition was strongly influenced by the stage of lactation (wk 3 to 10). The content of all even short- and medium-chain FA changed with lactation, except C 8 : 0 and C 10 : 0. The content of C 12 : 0, C 14 : 0, and C 16 : 0 and total saturated FA increased and the content of C 18 : 0, C 18 : 1 cis total, and total cis monounsaturated FA decreased with lactation. Maturity of the <b>corn</b> <b>silages</b> at harvest did not affect the production performance of dairy cows, but resulted in a decreased content of C 18 : 3 n- 3, total n- 3, and an increased n- 6 :n- 3 ratio in the milk fat of dairy cows...|$|R

Corn stover can be beneficial to beef cattle producers because the “corn stover can provide a low cost feed source for mid-gestation beef cows.” In addition to the stalks, leaves, husks, and cobs remaining in the field, kernels of grain may also be left over from harvest. These left over kernels, along with the corn stover, serve as an additional feed source for grazing cattle. Over time, the stalks will decrease in value as feed, so farmers aim to graze the corn stover as soon as possible after harvest.
