50|$|Day was the Games Editor for Chess Canada Magazine {{and wrote}} the tournament book for the 1972 Closed Canadian Championship. He wrote a booklet on The Big <b>Clamp</b> <b>opening</b> system and co-authored a 1982 book on the Grand Prix Sicilian line with English Grandmaster Julian Hodgson. He {{wrote a book about}} the life and games of the late Canadian International Master Bryon Nickoloff (1956-2004), a close friend, {{published}} in 2007 by Chess'n Math Association. He is constantly updating his own selection of games, for eventual publication. Day became the chess columnist for the high circulation Toronto Star newspaper in 1976, and has written a popular weekly column ever since, now more than 1,500 in total, usually featuring some newsy information from around the chess world (peppered with his insightful analysis), a Master game with notes, and a chess problem, the answer to which is provided the following week. Since the late 1960s, he has been a successful contributor to Canadian chess magazines, respected widely for his great stories blended with incisive notes.|$|E
40|$|Detailed {{mechanisms}} of DNA clamps in prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems were investigated by probing their mechanics with single-molecule force spectroscopy. Specifically, the mechanical forces {{required for the}} Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae <b>clamp</b> <b>opening</b> were measured at the single-molecule level by optical tweezers. Steered molecular dynamics simulations further examined the forces involved in DNA <b>clamp</b> <b>opening</b> {{from the perspective of}} the interface binding energies associated with the <b>clamp</b> <b>opening</b> processes. In combination with additional molecular dynamics simulations, we identified the contact networks between the clamp subunits that contribute significantly to the interface stability of the S. cerevisiae and E. coli clamps. These studies provide a vivid picture of the mechanics and energy landscape of <b>clamp</b> <b>opening</b> and reveal how the prokaryotic and eukaryotic clamps function through different mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|Clamp loaders load {{ring-shaped}} sliding clamps onto DNA. Once {{loaded onto}} DNA, sliding clamps bind to DNA polymerases {{to increase the}} processivity of DNA synthesis. To load clamps onto DNA, an open clamp loader-clamp complex must form. An unresolved question is whether clamp loaders capture clamps that have transiently opened or whether clamp loaders bind closed clamps and actively open clamps. A simple fluorescence-based <b>clamp</b> <b>opening</b> assay was developed {{to address this question}} and to determine how ATP binding contributes to <b>clamp</b> <b>opening.</b> A direct comparison of real time binding and opening reactions revealed that the Escherichia coli γ complex binds β first and then opens the clamp. Mutation of conserved “arginine fingers” in the γ complex that interact with bound ATP decreased <b>clamp</b> <b>opening</b> activity showing that arginine fingers make an important contribution to the ATP-induced conformational changes that allow the clamp loader to pry open the clamp...|$|E
40|$|The {{technical}} solution of this diagnostic device for in-situ and laboratory measuring of conventional {{strength and the}} module of deformation by <b>opening</b> <b>clamps</b> in a drilled hole belongs {{to the field of}} quality and material property testing, especially concerning timber. In dependence on the specific {{technical solution}}, the device can be used for an establishment of conventional strength and the module of deformation of any material by <b>opening</b> <b>clamps</b> in a drilled hole in the examined volume. It also finds application in the situations when resistance drilling cannot be used and the mechanical properties of timber need to be established through the entire section of the examined element. Its main advantages are its speed and simple operation without a need for power distribution network...|$|R
40|$|Tool furnishes large pushing or pulling forces. Device {{includes}} two clamping blocks, two clamping plates, and a motor-driven linear actuator with selflocking screw shaft. Power <b>clamp</b> exerts <b>opening</b> or closing force at push of switch. Tool approximately 1 m long. Originally designed to secure payload aboard Space Shuttle, operated {{with one hand}} to apply opening or closing force of up to 1, 000 lb (4, 400 N). Clamp has potential applications as end effector for industrial robots and in rescue work to push or pull wreckage with great force...|$|R
40|$|A calcium-permeable, voltage-insensitive {{non-specific}} cation {{channel that}} is activated by cytoplasmic calcium {{was found in}} approximately 50 % of the cell-attached patches in cultured human retinal glial cells sampled by the patch <b>clamp</b> technique. Spontaneous <b>openings</b> of this channel were infrequent, but increased markedly when glial cells were exposed to basic fibroblast growth factor. Although the role of these cation channels is uncertain, they provide a mechanism to perpetuate a transient rise in cytosolic calcium induced by the release of calcium from intracellular stores...|$|R
40|$|Using single-molecule {{fluorescence}} {{resonance energy}} transfer, we have defined bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP) clamp conformation {{at each step}} in transcription initiation and elongation. We find that the clamp predominantly is open in free RNAP and early intermediates in transcription initiation but closes upon formation of a catalytically competent transcription initiation complex and remains closed during initial transcription and transcription elongation. We show that four RNAP inhibitors interfere with <b>clamp</b> <b>opening.</b> We propose that <b>clamp</b> <b>opening</b> allows DNA to be loaded into and unwound in the RNAP active-center cleft, that DNA loading and unwinding trigger clamp closure, and that clamp closure accounts for the high stability of initiation complexes and the high stability and processivity of elongation complexes...|$|E
40|$|The anthrax lethal toxin {{consists}} of protective antigen (PA) and lethal factor (LF). Understanding both the PA pore formation and LF translocation through the PA pore {{is crucial to}} mitigating and perhaps preventing anthrax disease. To better understand the interactions of the LF-PA engagement complex, {{the structure of the}} LFN-bound PA pore solubilized by a lipid nanodisc was examined using cryo-EM. CryoSPARC was used to rapidly sort particle populations of a heterogeneous sample preparation without imposing symmetry, resulting in a refined 17 Å PA pore structure with 3 LFN bound. At pH 7. 5, the contributions from the three unstructured LFN lysine-rich tail regions do not occlude the Phe <b>clamp</b> <b>opening.</b> The open Phe clamp suggests that, in this translocation-compromised pH environment, the lysine-rich tails remain flexible and do not interact with the pore lumen region...|$|E
40|$|Sliding DNA clamps {{are loaded}} at a ss/dsDNA {{junction}} by a clamp loader {{that depends on}} ATP binding for <b>clamp</b> <b>opening.</b> Sequential ATP hydrolysis results in closure of the clamp so that it completely encircles and diffuses on dsDNA. We followed events during loading of an E.  coli β clamp in real time by using single-molecule FRET (smFRET). Three successive FRET states were retained for 0. 3  s, 0. 7  s, and 9  min: Hydrolysis of the first ATP molecule by the γ clamp loader resulted in closure of the clamp in 0. 3  s, and after 0. 7  s in the closed conformation, the clamp was released to diffuse on the dsDNA for at least 9  min. An additional single-molecule polarization study revealed that the interfacial domain of the clamp rotated in plane by approximately 8 ° during clamp closure. The single-molecule polarization and FRET studies thus revealed the real-time dynamics of the ATP-hydrolysis-dependent 3 D conformational change of the β clamp during loading at a ss/dsDNA junction...|$|E

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of type II DNA topoisomerases involves {{the formation of}} an enzyme-operated gate in one double-stranded DNA segment and the passage of another segment through this gate. DNA gyrase is the only type II topoisomerase able to introduce negative supercoils into DNA, a feature that requires the enzyme to dictate the directionality of strand passage. Although it is known that this is a consequence of the characteristic wrapping of DNA by gyrase, the detailed mechanism by which the transported DNA segment is captured and directed through the DNA gate is largely unknown. We have addressed this mechanism by probing the topology of the bound DNA segment at distinct steps of the catalytic cycle. We propose a model in which gyrase captures a contiguous DNA segment with high probability, irrespective of the superhelical density of the DNA substrate, setting up an equilibrium of the transported segment across the DNA gate. The overall efficiency of strand passage is determined by the position of this equilibrium, which depends on the superhelical density of the DNA substrate. This mechanism is concerted, in that capture of the transported segment by the ATP-operated <b>clamp</b> induces <b>opening</b> of the DNA gate, which in turn stimulates ATP hydrolysis...|$|R
40|$|Sliding clamps are {{toroidal}} {{proteins that}} encircle DNA {{and act as}} mobile platforms for DNA replication and repair machinery. To be loaded onto DNA, the eukaryotic sliding clamp Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) must be splayed open {{at one of the}} subunit-subunit interfaces by the ATP-dependent clamp loader, Replication Factor C, whose clamp-interacting sites form a right-handed spiral. Earlier molecular dynamics (MD) studies suggested that when PCNA opens, it preferentially adopts a right-handed spiral to match the spiral of the clamp loader. Here, analysis of considerably longer MD simulations shows that although the opened form of PCNA can achieve conformations matching the helical pitch of Replication Factor C, it is not biased toward a right-handed spiral structure. A coarse-grained elastic model was also built; its strong correspondence to the all-atom MD simulations of PCNA suggests that the behavior of the open clamp is primarily due to elastic deformation governed by the topology of the clamp domains. The elastic model was further used to construct the energy landscape of the opened PCNA clamp, including conformations that would allow binding to the clamp loader and loading onto double-stranded DNA. A picture of PCNA emerges of a rather flexible protein that, once opened, is mechanically compliant in the <b>clamp</b> <b>opening</b> process...|$|E
40|$|In all {{domains of}} life, sliding clamps tether DNA polymerases to DNA to {{increase}} the processivity of synthesis. Clamp loaders load clamps onto DNA in a multi-step process that requires ATP binding and hydrolysis. Like other AAA+ proteins, clamp loaders contain conserved Walker A and Walker B sequence motifs, which participate in ATP binding and hydrolysis, respectively. Mutation of the glutamate residue in Walker B motifs (or DExx-boxes) in AAA+ proteins typically reduces ATP hydrolysis {{by as much as}} a couple orders of magnitude, but has no effect on ATP binding. Here, the Walker B Glu {{in each of the four}} active ATP sites of the eukaryotic clamp loader, RFC, was mutated to Gln and Ala separately, and ATP binding- and hydrolysis-dependent activities of the quadruple mutant clamp loaders were characterized. Fluorescence-based assays were used to measure individual reaction steps required for clamp loading including clamp binding, <b>clamp</b> <b>opening,</b> DNA binding and ATP hydrolysis. Our results show that the Walker B mutations affect ATP-binding-dependent interactions of RFC with the clamp and DNA in addition to reducing ligand-dependent ATP hydrolysis activity. Here, we show that the Walker B glutamate is required for ATP-dependent ligand binding activity, a previously unknown function for this conserved Glu residue in RFC...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} whether hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) could effectively protect the small intestine mucosa against an ischemic insult, according to different periods of application. METHODS: The gut of 32 male rats {{was subjected to}} 60 -min ischemia (clamping the mesenteric artery and vein); After they were further reperfused upon <b>clamp</b> <b>opening</b> during 60 min. Animal groups were as follows. GII = placed on HBO during the ischemia period; GIII = placed on HBO during reperfusion; GIV = treated with HBO throughout the ischemia-reperfusion period. Some animals (GI) did not receive HBO treatment at all and served as reference of ischemia-reperfusion injury (IR). HBO {{was carried out in}} a cylindrical acrylic chamber (2. 0 ATA). Samples of small bowel were prepared for H. E staining for histological evaluations. RESULTS: The histological injury of mucosa was significantly less when HBO was administered during the ischemia period (17. 6 ± 0. 6) as compared with the IR (21. 3 ± 1. 8). HBO was not effective when applied during reperfusion (23. 1 ± 2. 1) or during the ischemia plus reperfusion period (18. 7 ± 1. 9). The thickness of the mucosa was preserved by HBO in ischemia (327. 50 ± 30. 23 µm) in comparison with the IR (172. 79 ± 5. 95 µm). In the periods of reperfusion (162. 50 ± 6. 05 µm) and ischemia plus reperfusion (296. 49 ± 20. 01 µm) the mucosa revealed a structural injury. CONCLUSION: Hyperbaric oxygen affects the ischemic insult of small bowel, being the favorable effect obtained when hyperbaric oxygen was administered early in the ischemic period...|$|E
40|$|DNA sliding clamps are {{structurally}} conservative toroid-shape {{proteins that}} encircle and slide along DNA, serving as scaffold for other functional enzymes {{to act on}} DNA and ensuring the replication proccessivity, thereby, of fundamental biological significance across domains of life. Mechanistic details and related functional implications concerning <b>clamp</b> <b>opening,</b> interaction between clamp and clamp-interactive proteins, post-translational modification of sliding clamp remain largely elusive due to technical difficulties in single molecule level manipulations and structural studies on large biological complex. Toward the end of providing a unified molecular-level description on clamp loading that would account for all available experimental observations, we calculated the interface binding energy and depicted the residue pair contributions using MM/PBSA and MM/GBSA calculations to compare the different interfaces of sliding clamps, and dissolved the uncertainty in comparative stability of different sliding clamp interfaces. The possible interface breaking pathways were investigated by sampling the opening state of interfaces using SMD simulations. Functioning as a polymerase accessory factor, sliding clamp associates with the dual enzymatic functional polymerase B (PolB) as DNA replication occurs. The massive conformational switch of PolB between replicating and editing mode is recognized for its functional significance but little is understood {{in the context of}} the PCNA/PolB/DNA complex. We integrated the structural informations from individual and binary crystal structures, as well as low-resolution structural information and other functional assay results, to build the complex atomistic models in both modes and refine them through atomistic simulations. The transition process was probed using TMD and ENM to reveal the structural characteristics and determinants of the transition. Sliding clamp is also a master coordinator of cellular responses to DNA damage. Efforts with the same methodology were made on human PCNA/FEN 1 /DNA ternary complex to investigate the reversible associations of FEN 1 to PCNA and the conformational switching leading to exchange of repair intermediates. In the third thrust, we modeled the ubiquitin-modified and SUMO-modified PCNA using protein-protein docking and atomic simulation. Alongside with the SAXS data, our results revealed the structural basis for the distinct functional outcomes upon different posttranslational modification of PCNA...|$|E

OBJETIVO: Determinar se a oxigenação hiperbárica (OHB) protege a mucosa do intestino delgado de ratos após isquemia e reperfusão. MÉTODOS: 32 ratos machos foram submetidos a clampeamento da artéria e da veia mesentéricas superiores durante 60 minutos (isquemia) seguido de 60 minutos de reperfusão. Após estes procedimentos os animais fora separados em quatro grupos, a saber: grupo I (GI) isquemia e reperfusão (IR); grupo II (GII) submetido a OHB concomitante a isquemia, Grupo III (GIII) submetido a OHB durante a reperfusão e, grupo IV (GIV) submetido a OHB durante o período de isquemia e de reperfusão. A OHB foi realizada em câmara acrílica (2. 0 ATA). Após anestesia, fragmentos do intestino delgado (íleo) foram fixados e processados para inclusão em parafina sendo os cortes corados pelo HE. As lâminas foram avaliadas quanto a presença de lesões histopatológicas da mucosa e avaliado a espessura da mucosa. RESULTADOS: A lesão histopatológica da mucosa foi significativamente inferior quando a OHB foi administrada na isquemia (12. 6 ± 0. 6) em comparação com o IR (21. 3 ± 1. 8). A OHB não foi efetiva quando aplicada durante a reperfusão (23. 1 ± 2. 1), ou durante a isquemia e reperfusão (18. 7 ± 1. 9). A espessura da mucosa foi preservada pela OHB na isquemia (327, 50 ± 30. 23 µm) em comparação com o IR (172. 79 ± 5. 95 µm). Nos períodos de reperfusão (162. 50 ± 6. 05 µm) e a isquemia (296. 49 ± 20. 01 µm) a mucosa apresentou lesão estrutural. CONCLUSÃO: A oxigenação hiperbárica protege a mucosa intestinal quando realizada durante o período de isquemia...|$|E
