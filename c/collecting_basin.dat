40|$|The {{continental}} slopes in {{the oceans}} are often covered by small-scale topographic features such as submarine canyons and ridges. When dense plumes, flowing geostrophically along the slope, encounter such features they may be steered downslope inside and alongside the topography. A set of laboratory experiments was conducted at the rotating Coriolis platform to investigate the effect of small-scale topography on plume mixing. A dense water source was placed {{on top of a}} slope, and experiments were repeated with three topographies: a smooth slope, a slope with a ridge, and a slope with a canyon. Three flow regimes were studied: laminar, waves, and eddies. When a ridge or a canyon were present on the slope, the dense plume was steered downslope and instabilities developed along the ridge and canyon wall. This happened regardless of the flow characteristics on the smooth slope. Froude and Reynolds numbers were estimated, and were found to be higher for the topographically steered flow than for flow on smooth topography. The stratification in the <b>collecting</b> <b>basin</b> was monitored and the mixing inferred. The total mixing and the entrainment rate increased when a ridge or a canyon were present. The difference in mixing levels between the regimes was smaller when topography was present, indicating that it was the small-scale topography and not the large-scale characteristics of the flow that determined the properties of the product water...|$|E
40|$|Artificial {{recharge}} for {{the purpose}} of replenishing the fresh ground-water body in Hawaii has been deliberately practiced in a few areas for many years, and has been recognized as incidental to other practices, principally irrigation, in many areas for several decades. The effects of these various artificial recharge practices on Hawaii Ghyben-Herzberg aquifers are briefly described in this report. In recent years, the practice of artificially recharging wastewater such as storm runoff, sewage effluent, and various industrial wastes into the subsurface has become of growing importance in Hawaii. In 1970 the Kahului Development Company began construction of a <b>collecting</b> <b>basin</b> and four deep injection wells for the disposal of storm runoff from a residential development in Kahului, Maui. This presented a unique opportunity to evaluate the suitability of the site for artificial recharge and to study the possible effects recharge of storm runoff might have on the local ground-water body, both from a water quality and a hydraulic standpoint. Studies were made to determine the following information: (i) the concentrations of selected chemical and biological parameters in storm runoff from residential areas in the town of Kahului and in the ground-water body {{in the area of the}} <b>collecting</b> <b>basin</b> and injection wells {{for the purpose}} of predicting the effects of artificial recharge of storm runoff on the water quality of the existing local ground-water body, (ii) the injection rates that can be expected for the completed injection wells by means of pumping and injection tests, and (iii) the movement of the injected water by monitoring water levels and selected chemical and biological parameters at observation wells near the injection site. The results of pumping and injection tests of one completed well and one test hole indicate that the finished injection wells should be able to inject at rates in excess of 5500 gallons per minute per well if significant clogging from sediment does not occur, and if hydraulic interference between the four wells operating simultaneously is not significant. Water analyses indicate that quality of the storm runoff from the Kahului area is generally good, with low dissolved solids and low chloride concentrations. Some fecal coliform will undoubtedly be introduced into the aquifer during injection of storm runoff. However, dilution of the injected runoff by the ground water and the hostile environment presented by the saline water in the disposal zone should eliminate any bacterial hazard. The most serious potential water quality problem may be a reduction in injection efficiency owing to possible well clogging by heavy sediment loads. The general water quality effects of injecting storm runoff into the ground-water body will be to decrease the dissolved solids concentration of the ground water in the vicinity of the wells.

50|$|Irrigation is {{the process}} of artificially {{applying}} water to soil to allow plant growth. This term is preferably used when large amounts of water is applied to dry, arid regions in order to facilitate plant growth. The process of irrigation not only increases the growth rate of the plant bust also increments the yield amount. In temperate and tropical areas rainfall and snowfall are the main suppliers of irrigation water, but in dry places with unfavourable weather conditions, groundwater serves as an essential source. Groundwater <b>collects</b> in <b>basins</b> made up of gravel and aquifers which are water-holding rocks.Dams also act as an essential distributive source of irrigation water. Underground wells also {{play an important role in}} storing water for irrigation, specifically in America and Arizona. Water and debris from streams filled by water accumulated during storms, also <b>collects</b> into underground <b>basins.</b> There are two types of irrigation techniques: spray irrigation and drip irrigation.

30|$|The {{study area}} can be {{differentiated}} into two main hydro-physiographic provinces: the watersheds, and water collector. The surface watersheds {{are defined by}} a simple process of identifying the highest elevations in land that drains to the surface water body. The southern tableland (from 100 to 140  m above sea level) is considered as the main watershed area of the study area, whereas the Piedmont and coastal plains {{as well as the}} drainage network are working as water collectors. The main surface water divide is located to the studied basins where the surface runoff goes toward north. This watershed area is only used locally for grazing and barley cultivation by rainwater. The tableland is cut by the drainage basins, which drains to north. In addition, the other water divide lines are located inside the Piedmont and coastal plains where the ridges are considered as local watershed areas. Rainwater flows to the north following the regional slope of the tableland surface either towards the low coastal plain and/or towards the sea. The rest of rainwater infiltrates through joints to feed the lower limestone aquifers. However, the presence of a thin hard crust accelerates the surface runoff to the north. The Piedmont and coastal plains act as <b>collecting</b> <b>basins</b> for the rainfall and runoff water from the southern tableland. The hydrographic pattern of the area was mainly developed during the Pluvial periods prevailing in the Quaternary period (Taha 1973). In the study area, a well-developed drainage pattern is absent, while the drainage patterns which are located to the south of the study area are more developed. The drainage lines dissecting the elevated tableland are structurally controlled. They are well developed in areas where lines of weakness are common (mainly South-North direction in all the studied basins, except Wadi Kheriga Basin, which is West-East direction).|$|R
