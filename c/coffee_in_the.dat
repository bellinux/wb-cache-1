50|$|<b>In</b> 1889, <b>coffee</b> {{production}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country saw a great decline {{following the}} introduction of <b>coffee</b> rust <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country and increased incidence of insect infestation.

By 1891, <b>coffee</b> production <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country was reduced to 1/6 of its total production two years earlier. By this period, Brazil has regained its position as a major coffee producer. Surviving coffee seedlings were transferred to Cavite as many farmers in Batangas shifted to growing other crops.|$|R

25|$|A coffee {{percolator}} {{is a type}} of pot used to brew <b>coffee.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> case of coffee-brewing the solvent is water, the permeable {{substance is}} the coffee grounds, and the soluble constituents are the chemical compounds that give coffee its color, taste, and aroma.

25|$|Brazil {{became the}} largest {{producer}} of <b>coffee</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world by 1852 {{and it has}} held that status ever since.

The period since 1950 saw the widening of the playing field due to the emergence of several other major producers, most notably Colombia, Ivory Coast, Ethiopia, and, most recently, Vietnam, which overtook Colombia and became the second-largest producer in 1999 and reached 15% market share by 2011.|$|E
25|$|Brazil {{then became}} the largest {{producer}} of mate.
