Discrimination of the newly derived <b>cut-points</b> was excellent and demonstrated greater agreement compared with the previously published <b>cut-points.</b> CONCLUSION: Output from accelerometers can differentiate physical activity intensity in children with an acquired brain injury.

Minutes of sedentary behaviour and vigorous activity were greater using Puyau et al. (2002) <b>cut-points,</b> but light, moderate, and moderate-to-vigorous (MVPA) were greater when derived using Puyau et al. (2004) <b>cut-points</b> (P < 0. 01). Total hip activity counts were lower than wrist. Sedentary minutes were greater at the hip, but minutes of light, vigorous and MVPA were lower (P < 0. 01). Moderate minutes were greater at the hip, but differed only when applying the Puyau et al. (2004) <b>cut-points</b> (P < 0. 01). In conclusion, data comparisons between two hip derived AW <b>cut-points</b> and between hip and wrist data are inappropriate. Future researchers using the AW at the hip should present data reduced using both published <b>cut-points.</b> As hip and wrist data differ, the wrist placement is preferable as it will likely increase children's compliance to monitoring protocols due to reduced obtrusiveness compared to the hip...|$|R

Objective: To (1) evaluate previously described steps/day <b>cut-points</b> in a sample of White and South Asian British primary school children and (2) use ROC analysis to generate alternative, ethnic specific, steps/day cut-offs for children. Methods and procedures: Height, body mass and pedometer determined physical activity were assessed in 763 British children (357 boys and 406 girls) from White (n = 593) and South Asian (n = 170) ethnic groups, aged 8 - 11 years. Results: The Vincent and Pangrazi <b>cut-points</b> significantly predicted BMI in white (p = 0. 006, Adjusted R(2) = 0. 08) and South Asian children (p = 0. 039, Adjusted R(2) = 0. 078). The Tudor-Locke et al. <b>cut-points</b> significantly predicted BMI in White children (p = 0. 0001, Adjusted R(2) = 0. 079) but not South Asian children (p < 0. 05). ROC analysis indicated significant alternative <b>cut-points</b> in White and South Asian boys and girls (all p = 0. 04 or better, Adjusted R(2) = 0. 091 for White and 0. 09 for South Asian children). Subsequent <b>cut-points</b> associated with healthy weight, when translated to steps/day were 13 625 for White boys, 13 135 for White girls, 10 897 for South Asian boys and 10 161 for South Asian girls. Conclusions: Previously published steps/day <b>cut-points</b> for healthy weight may not account for known ethnic variation in physical activity between White and South Asian children in the UK.

40|$|There {{is little}} strong {{evidence}} that currently recommended higher waist circumference <b>cut-points</b> for Europids compared with South Asians are associated with similar risk for type 2 diabetes. This {{study was designed to}} provide such evidence. Longitudinal studies over 5 years were conducted among 5, 515 Europid and 2, 214 ethnically South Asian participants. Age-standardized diabetes incidence at different levels of waist circumference and incidence difference relative to a reference value were calculated. The Youden Index was used to determine waist circumference <b>cut-points.</b> At currently recommended <b>cut-points,</b> estimated annual diabetes incidence for a 50 -year-old Europid was < 0. 6 % for both sexes, and for a 50 -year-old South Asian, 5. 8 % for men and 2. 1 % for women. Annual diabetes incidence of 1 % was observed for a 50 year old at a waist circumference 35 – 40 cm greater in Europid compared to South Asian men and women. Incidence difference between recommended <b>cut-points</b> and a reference value (80 cm in men, 70 cm in women) was 0. 3 and 4. 4 % per year for Europid and South Asian men, and 0. 2 and 0. 8 % per year for Europid and South Asian women, respectively. Waist circumference <b>cut-points</b> chosen using the Youden Index were shown to be dependent on obesity levels in the population. The much higher observed risk of diabetes in South Asians compared to Europids at the respective recommended waist circumference <b>cut-points</b> suggests that differences between them should be greater.

METHODS We analysed the trend of the ownership of each IEN variable and the distribution of the households’ scores. We calculated the correlation coefficients of each variable separately with the IEN score and the household income. We also evaluated how the changes of the score distribution over time affected the validity of the published reference <b>cut-points.</b> We used data from consortium surveys conducted every two years from 2002 to 2014 in the city of Pelotas, Brazil. RESULTS An increase in the educational level of household heads and in the ownership of all IEN assets, except radio and telephone, was observed in the study period. In general, the correlation of the assets with the IEN scores decreased over time. There was an increase in the score, with a consequent increase in the quintiles <b>cut-points,</b> but the distance between these <b>cut-points</b> had no significant variation. Thus, the reference <b>cut-points</b> for Pelotas, quickly became outdated.
