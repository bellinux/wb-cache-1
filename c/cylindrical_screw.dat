40|$|As helical surfaces, {{in their}} many and varied forms, are finding {{more and more}} {{applications}} in engineering, new approaches to their efficient design and manufacture are desired. To that end, the helical projection method that uses curvilinear projection lines to map a space object to a plane is examined in this paper, focusing on its mathematical model and characteristics in terms of graphical representation of helical objects. A number of interesting projective properties are identified in regard to straight lines, curves, and planes, and then the method is further investigated with respect to screws. The result shows that the helical projection of a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>screw</b> {{turns out to be}} a Jordan curve, which is determined by the screw's axial profile and number of flights. Based on the projection theory, a practical approach to the modeling of screws and helical surfaces is proposed and illustrated with examples, and its possible application in screw manufacturing is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Transforming {{growth factor}} beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) {{has been shown}} to stimulate bone healing in several animal models and may {{influence}} bone response directly after implant installation. Aim of the present study is to investigate the effect of a low dose of TGF-beta 1, on the early bone-healing around oral implants placed in trabecular bone (femoral condyle of goats). Twenty-four <b>cylindrical</b> <b>screw</b> type implants were used and TGF-beta 1 in two different concentrations were applied on sixteen of them. Each animal received three implants: one Ti (control), one Ti loaded with 0. 5 microg TGF-beta 1 (Ti-TGF(0. 5)), and one Ti loaded with 1. 0 microg TGF-beta 1 (Ti-TGF(1. 0)). The eight animals were euthanized at 6 weeks after implantation and implants with surrounding tissue were retrieved for histological preparation and histomorphometrical evaluation. Light microscopical analysis showed the occurrence of an intervening fibrous tissue layer around about half of the TGF-beta 1 loaded implants. Further, the histomorphometrical measurements revealed that the Ti implants demonstrated the highest percentage of bone-implant contact (65 +/- 4 %), while Ti-TGF(1. 0) implants showed the lowest amount (45 +/- 12 %). The difference between these two groups was statistically significant. On basis of the results, it is concluded that a low dose of TGF-beta 1 has a negative effect on the integration of oral implants in trabecular bone during the early post-implantation healing phase...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Pedicle screws with PMMA cement {{augmentation}} {{have been}} shown to significantly improve the fixation strength in a severely osteoporotic spine. However, the efficacy of screw fixation for different cement augmentation techniques, namely solid screws with retrograde cement pre-filling versus cannulated screws with cement injection through perforation, remains unknown. This study aimed to determine the difference in pullout strength between conical and <b>cylindrical</b> <b>screws</b> based on the aforementioned cement augmentation techniques. The potential loss of fixation upon partial screw removal after screw insertion was also examined. Method The Taguchi method with an L 8 array was employed to determine the significance of design factors. Conical and <b>cylindrical</b> pedicle <b>screws</b> with solid or cannulated designs were installed using two different screw augmentation techniques: solid screws with retrograde cement pre-filling and cannulated screws with cement injection through perforation. Uniform synthetic bones (test block) simulating severe osteoporosis were used to provide a platform for each screw design and cement augmentation technique. Pedicle screws at full insertion and after a 360 -degree back-out from full insertion were then tested for axial pullout failure using a mechanical testing machine. Results The results revealed the following 1) Regardless of the screw outer geometry (conical or <b>cylindrical),</b> solid <b>screws</b> with retrograde cement pre-filling exhibited significantly higher pullout strength than did cannulated screws with cement injection through perforation (p = 0. 0129 for conical screws; p = 0. 005 for <b>cylindrical</b> <b>screws).</b> 2) For a given cement augmentation technique (screws without cement augmentation, cannulated screws with cement injection or solid screws with cement pre-filling), no significant difference in pullout strength was found between conical and <b>cylindrical</b> <b>screws</b> (p > 0. 05). 3) Cement infiltration into the open cell of the test block {{led to the formation of}} a cement/bone composite structure. Observations of the failed specimens indicated that failure occurred at the composite/bone interface, whereas the composite remained well bonded to the screws. This result implies that the screw/composite interfacial strength was much higher than the composite/bone interfacial strength. 4) The back-out of the screw by 360 degrees from full insertion did not decrease the pullout strength in any of the studied cases. 5) Generally, larger standard deviations were found for the screw back-out cases, implying that the results of full insertion cases are more repeatable than those of the back-out cases. Conclusions Solid screws with retrograde cement pre-filling offer improved initial fixation strength when compared to that of cannulated screws with cement injection through perforation for both the conically and cylindrically shaped screw. Our results also suggest that the fixation screws can be backed out by 360 degrees for intra-operative adjustment without the loss of fixation strength. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background This {{study was}} {{designed}} to derive the theoretical formulae to predict the pullout strength of pedicle screws with an inconstant outer and/or inner diameter distribution (conical screws). For the transpedicular fixation, one of the failure modes is the screw loosening from the vertebral bone. Hence, various kinds of pedicle screws have been evaluated to measure the pullout strength using synthetic and cadaveric bone as specimens. In the literature, the Chapman's formula has been widely proposed to predict the pullout strength of screws with constant outer and inner diameters (<b>cylindrical</b> <b>screws).</b> Methods This study formulated the pullout strength of the conical and <b>cylindrical</b> <b>screws</b> as the functions of material, screw, and surgery factors. The predicted pullout strength of each screw was compared to the experimentally measured data. Synthetic bones were used to standardize the material properties of the specimen and provide observation of the loosening mechanism of the bone/screw construct. Results The predicted data from the new formulae were better correlated with the mean pullout strength of both the <b>cylindrical</b> and conical <b>screws</b> within an average error of 5. 0 % and R 2 = 0. 93. On the other hand, the average error and R 2 value of the literature formula were as high as - 32. 3 % and - 0. 26, respectively. Conclusion The pullout strength of the pedicle screws was the functions of bone strength, screw design, and pilot hole. The close correlation between the measured and predicted pullout strength validated the value of the new formulae, so as avoid repeating experimental tests. </p...|$|R

40|$|Medical microrobots {{have been}} widely used in {{clinical}} applications, particularly the spiral type locomotion mechanism, which was recently considered one of the main self-propelling mechanisms for the next medical microrobot to perform tasks such as capsule endoscopy and drug delivery. However, limits in clinical applications still exist. The spiral action of the microrobot while being used for diagnosis may lead to pain or even damage to the intestinal wall due to the exposed mechanisms. Therefore, a new locomotive mechanism, named the shrouded propeller mechanism, was proposed to achieve a high level of medical safety as well as effective propulsive performance in our study. The shrouded propeller mechanism consists of a bare spiral propeller and a non-rotating nozzle. To obtain a high effective propulsive performance, two types of screw grooves with different shapes including the <b>cylindrical</b> <b>screw</b> groove and the rectangular screw groove with different parameters were analyzed using the shrouded model. Two types of magnetic actuated microrobots with different driving modes, the electromagnetic (three-pole rotor) actuated microrobot and the permanent magnet (O-ring type magnet) actuated microrobot were designed to evaluate the performance of the electromagnetic actuation system. Based on experimental results, the propulsive force of the proposed magnetic actuated microrobot with a shrouded propeller was larger than the magnetic actuated microrobot with a bare spiral propeller under the same parameters. Additionally, the shrouded propeller mechanism as an actuator can be used for other medical microrobots for flexible locomotion...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{a method}} is {{proposed}} for determining a basic prole of a cc-type single-screw compressor including the gate rotor and the screw rotor. The cc-type has a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>screw</b> and two cylindrical gate rotors. Based on this method, {{a mathematical model}} of the meshing principles of a cc-type screw rotor meshed with a gate rotor, that has either straight edge teeth or conical teeth, is presented. The inverse envelope concept is {{used to determine the}} cutting-edge curve of a gate rotor. Based on this concept, the required cutter for machining a cc-type screw rotor can be obtained by the envelope of a one-parameter family. The obtained screw rotor is an envelope to the family of the gate rotor ’ s surfaces. The obtained envelope becomes the generating surface. The inverse envelope can be used to obtain the envelope to the family of generating surfaces. Then the prole of a gate rotor cutting-edge curve can be easily obtained. The surface analysis including contact lines is shown for the design and manufacture of a screw compressor. As an example, the cc-type single-screw compressor with a compressor ratio of 11 : 6 was determined with the aid of the proposed mathematical model. Using rapid prototyping (RP) and manufacturing technology, a cc-type single-screw rotor with a gate rotor was designed. The RP primitives provide an actual full-size physical model that can be analysed and used for further development. Results from these mathematical models should have applications in the design of cc-type single-screw compressors...|$|E
40|$|Study Design. Ex vivo {{study of}} the {{mechanical}} performance of cylindrical and dual-core pedicle screws after insertion, removal, and reinsertion in the same hole. Objective. To evaluate the effect of repeated use of same screw hole on the insertion torque and the retentive strength of the cylindrical and dual-core screws. Summary of Background Data. Insertion and removal of pedicle screws is sometimes necessary during surgical procedure to assess {{the integrity of the}} pilot-hole wall. However, this maneuver may compromise the implant-holding capacity. Methods. Sixty thoracolombar vertebrae (T 13 -L 5), harvested from 10 healthy calves, were used to insert 2 different designs of pedicle screws: cylindrical (5. 0 -mm outer diameter) and dual-core screws (5. 2 -mm outer diameter). Three experimental groups were created {{on the basis of the}} number of insertions of the screws and 2 subgroups were established according to the core pedicle screw design (dual-core and cylindrical). The insertion torque was measured during initial insertion, second insertion, and third insertion. Pullout screw tests were performed using a universal testing machine to evaluate the pullout strength after initial insertion, second insertion, and third insertion. Results. Significant reductions of 38 % in mean insertion torque and 30 % in mean pullout strength of dual-core screw were observed between the initial insertion and the third insertion. The <b>cylindrical</b> <b>screw</b> observed significant reductions of 52. 5 % in mean insertion torque and 42. 3 % in mean pullout strength between the initial insertion and the third insertion. A reduction of mean insertion torque and pullout strength between the first insertion and the second insertion but without significance was also observed for both types of screws. Conclusion. Insertions and reinsertion of either cylindrical or dual-core pedicle screws have compromised insertion torque and pullout strength of the implants as measured by mechanical tests.

40|$|The {{present study}} aims {{to the design}} of a finite-element model {{simulating}} accurately the pullout behaviour of <b>cylindrical</b> pedicle <b>screws</b> and predicting their pullout force. Three commercial pedicle screws, subjected to pure pullout from synthetic bone, were studied experimentally. The results were used for the design, calibration and validation of a finite-element model. Special attention was paid to the accurate simulation of the failure inside the host material under shear. For this purpose, a bilinear cohesive zone material model was adopted, controlling the mode-II debonding of neighbouring elements {{in the vicinity of the}} screw. Comparison between experimental and numerical results proved that the implementation of this approach can significantly enhance the accuracy of the numerical simulation of a screw's mechanical behaviour under pure pullout loads. The numerical model was used for the parametric study of various factors affecting the pullout performance of a <b>cylindrical</b> pedicle <b>screw.</b> It was concluded that the major parameter influencing the pullout force is the outer radius (increasing its value by 36 % increases the pullout force by 34 %). The influence of the purchase length of the screw is of similar quantitative nature. The respective dependence on the thread inclination, depth and pitch was significantly weaker. (C) 2009 IPEM.

PURPOSE: The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the 12 -month implant survival after immediate loading of 4 to 6 implants with fixed screw-retained prostheses in edentulous maxillae. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-one patients, edentulous or with remaining teeth to be extracted in the maxilla, received 4 to 6 implants (n= 111). The patients were restored with screw-retained fixed provisional prostheses supported by palladium-alloy frameworks within 24 hours after surgery. Insertion torques for implants were at least 40 Ncm. Implants, grouped as tapered or <b>cylindrical</b> <b>screws,</b> were placed in healed bone or extraction sockets. Implants were also classified as either vertical or off-angle. Definitive prostheses were placed after a mean healing time of 18 weeks. Radiographic examinations were made at the time of placement of provisional prostheses and 12 months later. Between-groups bone resorption was compared using 2 -way ANOVA (alpha=. 05). RESULTS: The mean follow-up time for all of the patients was 20 months (range, 13 to 28 months).

40|$|The {{inclusion}} of a healing chamber in dental implants {{has been shown to}} promote biological healing. In this paper, a novel numerical approach to the design of the healing chamber for additive-manufactured dental implants is proposed. This study developed an algorithm for the modeling of bone growth and employed finite element method in ANSYS to facilitate the design of healing chambers with a highly complex configuration. The model was then applied to the design of dental implants for insertion into the posterior maxillary bones. Two types of ITI® solid <b>cylindrical</b> <b>screwed</b> implant with extra rectangular-shaped healing chamber as an initial design are adopted, with which to evaluate the proposed system. This resulted in several configurations for the healing chamber, which were then evaluated based on the corresponding volume fraction of healthy surrounding bone. The best of these implants resulted in a healing chamber surrounded by around 9. 2 % more healthy bone than that obtained from the original design. The optimal design increased the contact area between the bone and implant by around 52. 9 %, which is expected to {{have a significant effect on}} osseointegration. The proposed approach is highly efficient which typically completes the optimization of each implant within 3 – 5 days on an ordinary personal computer.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{modeling}} of the contact conditions associated with <b>cylindrical,</b> prismatic, and <b>screw</b> joints in flexible multi-body systems. In the classical formulation these joints are developed for rigid bodies, and kinematic constraints are enforced between the kinematic variables of the two bodies. These constraints express the conditions for relative translation and rotation of the two bodies along and about a body fixed axis, and imply the relative sliding and rotation of the two bodies which remain in constant contact with each other. However, these kinematic constraints no longer imply relative sliding with contact {{when one of the}} bodies is flexible. To remedy this situation, a sliding joint and a sliding screw joint are proposed that involves kinematic constraints at the instantaneous point of contact between the sliding bodies. For sliding screw joints, additional constraints are added on the relative rotation of the contacting bodies. Various numerical examples are presented that demonstrate the dramatically different behavior of <b>cylindrical,</b> prismatic, or <b>screw</b> joints and of the proposed sliding and sliding screw joints in the presence of elastic bodies, and the usefulness of these constraint elements in the modeling of complex mechanical systems. © 2000 The American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc.

Mathematical {{modeling}} {{of the impact}} of a solid body upon a buffer positioned on a thin isotropic plate, whose dynamic behaviour is described by the Uflyand-Mindlin wave equations taking the rotary inertia and shear deformations into account, is investigated. Two types of the isotropic plate are considered in the present paper: elastic and viscoelastic. The buffer represents a steel <b>screw</b> <b>cylindrical</b> spring and a liquid damper connected with the spring consecutively. Wave equations allow to assume that in a plate the transient wave of transverse shear, because of which there is a deformation of a plate material outside of contact area, is generated with final velocity. As a method of the decision the ray method and method of splicing asymptotic expansion received for small times in a contact area and outside of it are used. ...|$|R

40|$|This work {{deals with}} the {{transient}} analysis of flexible multibody systems within a hybrid finite element framework. Hybrid finite elements {{are based on a}} two-field variational formulation in which the displacements and stresses are interpolated separately yielding very good coarse mesh accuracy. Most of the literature on flexible multibody systems uses beam-theory-based formulations. In contrast, the use of hybrid finite elements uses continuum-based elements, thus avoiding the problems associated with rotational degrees of freedom. In particular, any given three-dimensional constitutive relations can be directly used within the framework of this formulation. Since the coarse mesh accuracy as compared to a conventional displacement-based formulation is very high, the scheme is cost effective as well. A general formulation is developed for the constrained motion of a given point on a line manifold, using a total Lagrangian method. The multipoint constraint equations are implemented using Lagrange multipliers. Various kinds of joints such as <b>cylindrical,</b> prismatic, and <b>screw</b> joints are implemented within this general framework. Hinge joints such as spherical, universal, and revolute joints are obtained simply by using shared nodes between the bodies. In addition to joints, the formulation and implementation details for a DC motor actuator and for prescribed relative rotation are also presented. Several example problems illustrate the efficacy of the developed formulation...|$|R
40|$|STUDY DESIGN: Detailed biomechanical {{analysis}} of the anchorage performance provided by different pedicle screw design and placement strategies under pullout loading. OBJECTIVE: To biomechanically characterize the specific effects of surgeon-specific pedicle screw design parameters on anchorage performance using a finite element model (FEM). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Pedicle screw fixation is commonly used {{in the treatment of}} spinal pathologies. However, there is little consensus on the selection of an optimal screw type, size, and insertion trajectory depending on vertebra dimension and shape. METHODS: Different screw diameters and lengths, threads and insertion trajectories were computationally tested using a design of experiment (DOE) approach. A detailed FEM of an L 3 vertebra was created including elastoplastic bone properties and contact interactions with the screws. Loads and boundary conditions were applied to the screws to simulate axial pullout tests. Force-displacement responses and internal stresses were analyzed to determine the specific effects of each parameter. RESULTS: The DOE analysis revealed significant effects (P< 0. 01) for all tested principal parameters along with the interactions between diameter and trajectory. Screw diameter had the greatest impact on anchorage performance. The best insertion trajectory to resist pullout involved placing the screw threads closer to the pedicle walls using the straight-forward insertion technique, which showed the importance of the cortical layer grip. The simulated <b>cylindrical</b> single-lead thread <b>screws</b> presented better biomechanical anchorage than the conical dual-lead thread screws in axial loading conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The model made it possible to quantitatively measure the effects of both screw design characteristics and surgical choices, enabling to recommend strategies to improve single pedicle screw performance under axial loading...|$|R
