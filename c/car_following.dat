25|$|After an {{interlude}} by Mr. Hudson, furious {{about the}} need to re-shoot the first scene, the scene continues from where it left off. The rally car speeds up continuing the donuts that ended the first scene before speeding to the far left corner of the arena where a police car suddenly appears. The rally car brakes with just centimetres to spare. It then reverses half the width of the arena before performing a reverse-180 turn and driving towards the second police car at the far right of the arena. The rally car then speeds up to the left end of the arena with the second police <b>car</b> <b>following</b> it. At this point the rally car drifts the corner before returning to the right side performing a 180 skid to park the car perpendicular with the right wall. The two police cars follow performing the same manoeuvre resulting in the three cars being in parallel with each other. The rally car first races off the arena through the centre exit. The police cars then meet in the middle and perform donuts, with the nose of each car nearly touching the next, before following the exit of the rally car. At this point the motorcyclist makes his return by shooting a third police car with his gun, which causes it to split in half.|$|E

Wiggins shadowed his team-mate's run, in a <b>car</b> <b>following</b> him up the hill, to gather information about what lay ahead before his start time. Pate's time held for almost 20 minutes until 's Bart De Clercq bettered his time, breaking the 21-minute barrier.
