40|$|To date, however, {{there has}} been little {{investigation}} into how and why bottlenecks occur at the empty <b>container</b> off-dock <b>depots</b> around the world.

In particular, the paper aims to reveal the stakeholders’ perceptions and identify the main causes of the bottlenecks that exist at off-dock <b>container</b> <b>depots.</b> Based on direct observations and in-depth interviews with a panel of thirty experts in the physical movement of empty containers, the results indicated that the most frequent causes of bottlenecks that stakeholders perceived included work attitudes, operations handling, monitoring, information and facilities/others. Of these, the ‘operations handling’ related to <b>container</b> <b>depots</b> was considered the most significant identifiable barrier to container movements. The research outcomes should assist the container chain players to understand the practice requirements for empty containers in Malaysia...|$|R
