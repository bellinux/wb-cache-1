In order to further assess such application, the pressure drop across Activated carbon fibers in respirators must be adequately low to allow comfortable breathing of the wearer. This study investigated the pressure drop, PD across Activated carbon fibers in <b>respirator</b> <b>cartridges</b> using realistic breathing patterns. Two forms of Activated carbon fibers, cloth, ACC and felt, ACN were tested at three different surface areas: 1000, 1500 and 2000 g/m². Each Activated carbon fiber was placed in <b>respirator</b> <b>cartridge</b> at three different layers and subjected to two patterns of breathing: 20 litres per minute by 20 breaths per minute, and 68 litres per minute by 20 breaths per minute from a dynamic breathing machine supplied with purified air at 23 °C and 50 % relative humidity. PD determination {{was carried out in}} a customized Teflon testing chamber. Woven ACC was composed of closely knitted fibers while the unwoven ACN was composed of gradually distributed fibers. The individual effect of Activated carbon fibers forms, layers, breathing patterns, and surface areas was significant on inhalation and exhalation PD. Inhalation and exhalation PD were not significantly different, P= 0. 446 and P= 0. 736, respectively between the two forms. Increasing airflow in a single <b>respirator</b> <b>cartridge</b> to 68 LPM significantly increased inhalation PD, P< 0. 001 and exhalation PD, P< 0. 001 compared to PDs measurements obtained from 20 x 20 breathing pattern. Differences in inhalation and exhalation PD of the surface areas were not significant, P= 0. 647 and P= 0. 665. Increasing the Activated carbon fibers layers significantly increased both inhalation PD, P= 0. 016 and exhalation PD, P< 0. 001. This observation suggest an optimum layer for Activated carbon fibers' use in respiratory protection also, respirator certification testing using 68 litres per minute sinusoidal airflow may simulate strenous activities in work place better.

40|$|Full list {{of author}} {{information}} {{is available at the}} end of the articleIntroduction Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are a class of che-mical pollutants in the environment that can cause se-vere health problems. Some VOCs, like benzene, toluene and xylene (BTX) are known or suspected as carcino-gens [1, 2]. Adsorption of contaminants on sorbents is one of the most important methods for controlling VOC emissions. Activated carbon (AC) is the most versatile and fre-quently used sorbent for environmental control in the form of a fixed bed. This is due to its large internal sur-face area and pore volume, and its ability to absorb or-ganic vapors at low cost. These characteristics make it one of the most practical adsorbents [3, 4] for removing toxic gases and vapors from inhaled air via air-purifying respirators or personal protection devices. <b>Respirator</b> <b>cartridges</b> and canisters contain activated carbon gra-nules in a packed bed which adsorb organic vapors from air while passed through the sorbents [5].

M., Worker 3 left the cold area {{to make a phone}} call and set off a hand and foot counter in Building 514. Upon discovering the contamination, the shredding operation was stopped and surveys were conducted in the shredder area. Surveys conducted on the workers found significant levels of contamination on their PPE and the exterior of their <b>respirator</b> <b>cartridges.</b> An exit survey of Worker 1 was conducted {{at approximately}} 10 : 05 A. M., and found contamination on his PPE, as well as on the exterior and interior of his respirator. Contamination was also found on his face, chest, back of neck, hair, knees, and mustache. A nose blow indicated significant contamination, which was later determined to be curium- 244...|$|R
40|$|The current {{military}} respirator provides {{protection from}} contaminants using a cartridge packed with adsorbent activated carbon particles treated with metal salts to provide protection from toxic gases. However, the user of this respirator {{is subject to}} a physiological burden as a result. One component of this burden is the pressure drop, which makes breathing through the respirator filter difficult, with the burden becoming more severe at higher breathing rates. This project investigates the reduction of pressure drop and hence burden in <b>respirator</b> <b>cartridges</b> by using adsorbent hollow fibres. These {{are made up of}} adsorbent powder held together with a polymer binder to replace the conventional adsorbent particles. Adsorbent hollow fibres have a number of advantages, including lower pressure drop, the ability to operate in any orientation, no special filling requirements and customisability against emerging threats, such as toxic industrial chemicals. Dynamic challenges were performed using ammonia, hydrogen sulphide and cyclohexane as candidate gases, as each typifies a particular category of toxic industrial chemicals. Adsorbent hollow fibres were customised by treating with metal salts, metal organic frameworks and pore forming agents, and by replacing the hollow fibre polymer binder with a novel microporous polymer. In addition, the pressure drop of these adsorbent fibres was compared to granular beds. Pressure drop was then modelled using the Hagen-Poiseuille equation, and the breakthrough time was modelled with the Wheeler-Jonas equation, enabling the prediction of pressure drop and breakthrough time for new designs of adsorbent hollow fibre cartridges...|$|R
40|$|NASA is {{developing}} two new pieces of emergency response equipment that recognize {{and address the}} constraints of a confined space environment. One piece of equipment is a respirator designed {{for use in a}} post fire environment. Traditional first responders generally use supplied air respirators - they provide cool, dry, safe breathing air to the first responder, and because they are supplied at above ambient pressure, the system is tolerant to a loose-fitting mask. Supplied air respirators have a limited supply of air, but because the traditional first responder intends to address the emergency from outside and then retreat, this limited air supply does not pose a serious problem. NASA uses a supplied oxygen respirator for first response to an emergency affecting air quality on the International Space Station. The air supply is rated for 15 minutes - ISS program managers sponsored a hardware development activity to provide the astronauts up to 8 hours of breathing protection after the supplied air system is exhausted. Size and weight limitations prevent the use of a supplied air system for 8 hours for six crew members. A trade study resulted in the selection of a filtering respirator system over a re-breather system; due to design simplicity, operational simplicity, and likely threats to air quality on ISS. The <b>respirator</b> <b>cartridge</b> that filters smoke particles, adsorbs organics and acid gases, and catalytically converts carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide has been qualified for use on ISS, and was delivered on STS- 135, the final mission of the Space Shuttle Program...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Occupational Hygiene)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2005. The {{study was}} {{undertaken}} after initial surveys indicated that lead (Pb) {{was present at}} concentrations {{in excess of the}} occupational exposure limit (OEL) on the matte tapping floor (MTF). A follow up study was designed in accordance with the Occupational Exposure Sampling Strategy Manual (OESSM), to determine personal exposure levels of the tappers to Pb whom are employed on the MTF. Following the initial static samples taken during the identification phase, follow up static samples were taken during the follow up personal exposure survey. This enabled us to determine if there were any significant changes in conditions between the initial and static samples. Simultaneously personal samples were taken on a representative group of the 30 tappers employed in the furnace building on the two tapping floors. Samples were taken over a 12 hour period due to the shift duration worked by the tappers. A decision was taken to compare the MTF and the slag tapping floor (STF) due to the similarities in the processes used on both floors. In order to evaluate the possible effect of lead on the workers employed as "tappers", a group of 30 workers employed in the furnace on the tapping floors of the Polokwane Smelter building were evaluated. The group consists of 30 men from multicultural urban environments. This group was further divided into smokers and non-smokers. Personal samples were conducted on 16 of the workers in the aforementioned group of “tappers", who were randomly selected to ensure a top 10 % exposure, with a 90 % confidence level as prescribed by OESSM. A short calculation gave an indication that the exposure to Pb according to the Lead Regulations of the Occupational Health and Safety Act (OHS Act), Act 85 of 1993, the OEL for Pb other than tetraethyl Pb is 0. 15 mg/m 3 for an 8 -hour shift would decrease to 0. 10 mg/m 3 for a 12 -hour shift. This value was then used to compare exposure levels to the adapted statutory limits. Lead serves no useful purpose in the human body, and it's presence in the body can lead to toxic effects, regardless of the exposure pathway. The blood lead level (BLL) could be expected to be between 1 and 5 µg/dL in rural people and around 13 µg/dL in urban The results of the BLL tests performed during the study however indicated that all BLL were under 10 µg/dL, which indicated that the current control measures that are in place are keeping the exposure of the tappers to Pb down. The amount of time per individual spent on the MTF is being kept to a minimum by rotating the 30 tappers on a shift basis, which means that a particular employee will only work for one shift on the MTF before being rotated to another area within the plant. The results obtained showed that there is {{no significant difference between the}} initial and static samples taken on the MTF and STF. The BLL tests performed on the group of tappers were cross-referenced against the risk factors that were identified, as being possible sources of non-occupational sources of exposure to Pb. No significant results were obtained for this comparison showing no effect on the BLL's due to non-occupational exposures to Pb. Lastly there was a significant difference between the personal exposures measured at the MTF and the STF, indicating that there is a higher level of Pb in the ambient atmosphere of the MTF. This was expected, due to the fact that Pb is a heavy metal and would tend to group and sort with the rest of the valuable metals, which are found on the MTF. The electric arc furnace is designed to incorporate a slant downward from the STF to the MTF. Bone dry concentrate is fed pneumatically into the furnace. The concentrate which is in powder form is then smelted and reaches a temperature of approximately 1500 °C. In the time it takes for this concentrate to be smelted and reach a fluid state, the valuable heavy metals, including lead, move down the slope toward the MTF and to accumulate where it can then be "tapped" out by opening the tap hole on the MTF. However a small amount of Pb and other heavy metals like: platinum, gold, rhodium, rubidium, silver, etc., remain caught up in the mixture and are passed out along with the waste product slag, on the STF. This explains why small amounts of Pb were also found in the ambient atmosphere of the STF. Recommendations were made to improve on the current extraction ventilation system, to increase the effective uptake of Pb from the ambient atmosphere on the MTF whilst the molten metal is being allowed to run along the launder to the ladle. By optimising the shift rotation roster it could be ensured that the minimum amount of time is spent on the MTF by each individual. An increased awareness of personal hygiene, and standard operating procedures could further decrease personal exposure to Pb. The problem however lies in decreasing the amount of airborne Pb on the MTF to below the OEL, and as an interim this area has been declared a respirator zone. Personal Protective Equipment (F'PE) was the only effective form of control at the time of the survey. Half mask <b>respirators</b> with <b>chemical</b> <b>cartridges,</b> which along with dust filters present a barrier between the lungs and the ambient atmosphere of the MTF. Master...|$|R
