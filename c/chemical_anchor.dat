40|$|AbstractThe {{anchorage}} {{formed by}} the post-installed steel chemical anchors {{can be used for}} new buildings. Thanks to easy and fast installation can be used particularly for reconstructions. Chemical anchors are the most frequently used with concrete and reinforced concrete. On the trade of anchoring, the <b>chemical</b> <b>anchor</b> systems are represented by a number of variants of this anchorage type but, in fact, they always consist of a steel bolt (anchor) installed in a pre-drilled hole. The connection between a steel bolt and concrete or masonry (most frequently) is done by glue, i. e. usually by different types of epoxy. The research presented in this article is focused on a possible application of these anchor types, namely in the connection of a steel beam with a face plate to different types of columns. The analysis of a connection steel beam cantilever stressed by bending moment to the construction of the column with bonded anchors. The loading capacity of anchors connected (bonded) to steel HEB concreted column will be compared to loading capacity of anchors bonded to reinforced concrete column. Comparisons will be done on the basis of experimental tests and subsequently validated by numerical models. Compared resistance of the anchors is different for columns and the rigidity of joints...|$|E

Here, gradients of extracellular matrix molecules are formed synthetically by {{the combination of}} a surface nanopatterning technique called block copolymer nanolithography (BCN) and a biofunctionalisation technique. A modified substrate dip-coating process of BCN allows for the formation of precise molecular gradients of cyclic RGDfK peptide patches at interfaces, which are presented to cells for testing cell adhesion and polarisation. Surfaces formed by BCN consist of hexagonally ordered gold dot patterns with a gradient in particle spacing. Each dot serves as a <b>chemical</b> <b>anchor</b> for the binding of cyclic RGDfK peptides, which are specifically recognised by alpha(v) beta(3) integrins. Due to steric hindrance only up to one integrin binds to one functionalised gold dot which forms a peptide patch spacing. We demonstrate how cell morphology, adhesion area, actin and vinculin distribution as well as cell body polarisation are influenced by the peptide patch spacing gradient. As a consequence, these gradients of adhesive ligands induce cell orientation towards smaller particle spacing when the gradient strength is 15 nm/mm at least. This implicates that an adherent cell's sensitivity to differentiate between ligand patch spacing is approximately 1 nm across the cell body...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{improvement}} in mechanical and adhesion properties of polymer resins have allowed to progressively substitute cast-in place rebars by polymer-based anchors in some applications, by providing equivalent or even higher mechanical properties at ambient temperature. However, a temperature increase {{has the effect}} of weakening the bond and leads to a significant decay in the bearing capacity of the adhesive anchors. This paper presents a study of the phenomena that occur at high temperature in an adhesive anchor when exposed to high temperatures by means of two pull-out test procedures and by thermomechanical characterization of the polymer resin. Results showed that the resin glass transition is the responsible for the decay in the fire resistance of adhesive anchors.

40|$|Macroporous polymer monoliths with {{interconnected}} structures {{have attracted}} considerable {{interest in the}} fields of supported catalysis, chromatography, water purification, etc. A popular and straightforward synthesis approach for such open-cell polymers is based on the emulsion-templated polymerization. In this strategy, a major phase is dispersed in a minor continuous phase containing monomers, cross-linker, initiator and surfactant.

A very popular and straightforward synthetic approach for such open-cell polymers is the High Internal Phase Emulsion (HIPE) polymerization method. The latter consists in three steps: (i) stabilization of an emulsion in which an internal phase with a volume fraction higher than 74 % is dispersed within a minor continuous phase containing a polymer network precursor, (ii) curing of the polymer phase by polymerization or crosslinking reactions, (iii) removal of the internal phase to release the porosity.

The immobilisation has been carried out at room temperature, under visible light, in ambient atmosphere and without applying any external driving force or chemical activation of the epoxy photoresist surface. Atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy investigation demonstrate the spontaneous <b>chemical</b> <b>anchoring</b> of the organic-coated TiO 2 NCs on the microcantilevers, which resulted in a highly interconnected nanoporous multilayer structure. The chemical and morphological characterisation shows that the immobilised NCs do not change either their pristine morphology or the chemical structure after binding.

Finally, the results show that the fabrication procedure of the microcantilevers has not been affected by the immobilisation protocol.

40|$|A new {{approach}} for the attachment of vertically-aligned shortened carbon nanotube architectures to a silicon (100) substrate by <b>chemical</b> <b>anchoring</b> {{directly to the}} surface has been demonstrated for the first time. The ordered assembly of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) was accomplished by hydroxylating the silicon surface followed by a condensation reaction with carboxylic acid functionalised SWCNTs. This new nanostructure has been characterised by X-ray photoelectron, Raman and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy as well as scanning electron and atomic force microscopy. The assembly behaviour of SWCNTs onto the silicon surface shows a fast initial step producing isolated functionalised carbon nanotubes or nanotube bundles anchored to the silicon surface followed by a slower step where the adsorbed nanotubes grow into larger aggregates via van der Waals interactions between adsorbed and solvated nanotubes. The electrochemical and optical properties of the SWCNTs directly attached to silicon have also been investigated. These new nanostructures are excellent electrochemical electrodes. They also fluoresce in the wavelength range 650 - 800 nm. The successful attachment of the SWCNTs directly to silicon provides a simple, new avenue for fabrication and development of silicon-based nanoelectronic, nano-optoelectronic and sensing devices.

40|$|A common {{method to}} reduce {{cellular}} and proteinaceous fouling is the immobilization of antifouling polymers on biomaterial surfaces (Fig. 1). Several polymer classes have been explored for this purpose, including polyacrylates 3 - 7, oligosaccharides 8, 9, polymer mimics of phospholipids 10 - 12, and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) 13 - 17. Although the general {{physical and chemical}} properties that make surfaces antifouling are not known, Merrill 18 as well as Whitesides and coworkers 19 postulate that nonfouling surfaces should be electrically neutral, hydrophilic, and possess hydrogen bond acceptors but not hydrogen bond donors. Although exceptions to these rules have been observed 20, 21, many polymers with antifouling properties possess most of these traits. Two basic strategies exist for functionalizing material surfaces with antifouling polymers. The first approach, termed graft-to, consists of the adsorption to surfaces of presynthesized polymer chains end-functionalized with a <b>chemical</b> <b>anchoring</b> group (Fig. 1, top). Alternatively, graft-from approaches, in which a polymer is grown in situ from the surface via a surface-adsorbed initiation group, are generally capable of producing denser polymer layers (Fig. 1, bottom).

The present thesis aims to explore the possible benefits of controlled radical polymerization (CRP) for the design of advanced macroporous monoliths via emulsion templated polymerization. In a general approach, copolymers with precise architecture, composition and chain-end functionality, were synthesized by CRP and used as macromolecular surfactants for stabilizing various types of high and medium internal phase emulsion polymerizations.
