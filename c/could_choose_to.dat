5|$|Instead of {{destroying}} confiscated ivory, a government <b>could</b> <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> sell it, {{and put the}} funds to use in one of several ways. Several of the countries involved in the ivory trade, especially those {{on the supply side}} in Africa, are also some of the nations which struggle the most with poverty. Destroying ivory in those countries is thus often a controversial decision for internal stakeholders as well as external commentators, as the funds gained by selling the material could be used {{to improve the quality of}} life for human citizens.|$|E
5|$|Using touch controls, {{the player}} would aim {{with one of}} their {{characters}} and shoot them towards enemies like billiards, with the character bouncing off upon contact with enemies or walls until it ran out of momentum. After the player's turn was over, the enemies {{would do the same}} thing, and attack the player's characters. With a certain number of turns passed, the player <b>could</b> <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> activate their characters' individual special attacks.|$|E
5|$|A {{major theme}} {{of the game is}} heroism, where being a hero may bring more harm than help. During development, there was a point at the {{beginning}} of the game where players <b>could</b> <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> leave Dubai. This was cut from the game, as the team found it not effective enough, and it broke a player's immersion in the game. According to Williams, the choice system was originally designed to be similar to Fable II, where after a player makes a decision, they cannot reload the game and choose differently unless they start a new game. This was later removed due to the game's structure as a shooter, as the team feared that it might make the game unwinnable and cause players to feel frustrated. Williams later added that adding achievements to the game was a mistake, as it disrupts the game's narrative.|$|E

5|$|At {{seventeen}} years of age, Watts entered the 2008 season primarily playing school football with Brighton Grammar in the Associated Public Schools of Victoria (APS) competition, instead of under-18 {{level in the}} TAC Cup with the Sandringham Dragons. He was completing year eleven and <b>could</b> <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> nominate for the AFL draft in either 2008 or 2009; touted as a likely early draft pick despite being a year younger than most of his fellow draft prospects, he spent {{the majority of the}} season undecided on whether he would nominate for the 2008 draft. He did, however, state that he would remain in Victoria in 2009 to complete year twelve at Brighton Grammar even if he was recruited by an interstate team.|$|E
5|$|Life on Brook Farm {{was based}} on {{balancing}} labor and leisure while working together {{for the benefit of}} the greater community. Each member <b>could</b> <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> do whatever work they found most appealing and all were paid equally, including women. Revenue for the community came from farming and from selling handmade products like clothing as well as through fees paid by the many visitors to Brook Farm. The main source of income was the school, which was overseen by Mrs. Ripley. A pre-school, primary school, and a college preparatory school attracted children internationally and each child was charged for his or her education. Adult education was also offered.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} secure a {{position}} as a teacher, erudite in the capital, or government official, a student could choose one of several paths to become well educated. Perhaps the most prestigious path was enrollment in the Imperial University. Students had to be above the age of eighteen to enroll, and were selected by the Minister of Ceremonies from those recommended by local authorities. Other students <b>could</b> <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> enroll in a school sponsored by the local commandery government. A professional teacher who opened a private school {{in a small town}} or village could sometimes gather a following of several hundred to over a thousand students. Students were expected to pay tuition, thus a teacher enjoyed a significant salary. His standing in the local community was usually paramount, and was even sought as an arbiter in disputes. Although the size of the Imperial Academy was greatly expanded in Eastern Han, private schools grew in importance as the imperial government lost authority and its academy's persecution of Old Text tradition drove many to pursue Old Text studies in private institutions.|$|E

5|$|The U.S. also {{increased}} the installation {{and use of}} full-body scanners in many of its major airports {{as a result of}} the attack. The scanners are designed to be able to detect bombs under clothing, and 11 airports, including O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, began to receive the machines in March 2010. The TSA said that it had plans to have 1,000 of the machines in airports by the end of 2011. Before, the U.S. had only 40 scanners across 19 airports. The government also said that it planned to buy 300 additional scanners in 2010 and another 500 in the following fiscal year, starting October 2010. It costs around an estimated $530 million to purchase the 500 machines and hire over 5,300 workers to operate them. However, the U.S. government has stated that being scanned is voluntary and that passengers who object to the process <b>could</b> <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> undergo a pat-down search or be searched with hand-held detectors. Under new rules prompted by the incident, airline passengers traveling to the U.S. from 14 nations would undergo extra screening: Afghanistan, Algeria, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Nigeria, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. The inclusion of non-Muslim Cuba on the list was criticized.|$|E
5|$|The main food staples in {{the diet}} of the lower classes {{remained}} rice, pork, and salted fish.

They could choose {{from a wide variety}} of meats and seafood, including shrimp, geese, duck, mussel, shellfish, fallow deer, hare, partridge, pheasant, francolin, quail, fox, badger, clam, crab, and many others. Dairy products were rare in Chinese cuisine at this time. Beef was rarely consumed since the bull was a valuable draft animal, and dog meat was absent from the diet of the wealthy, although the poor <b>could</b> <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> eat dog meat if necessary (yet it was not part of their regular diet). People also consumed dates, raisins, jujubes, pears, plums, apricots, pear juice, lychee-fruit juice, honey and ginger drinks, pawpaw juice, spices and seasonings of Sichuan pepper, ginger, soy sauce, oil, sesame oil, salt, and vinegar.|$|E
