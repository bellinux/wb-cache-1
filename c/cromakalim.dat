In the presence of tetrodotoxin, <b>cromakalim</b> (30 – 100 mol/l) produced a hyperpolarization up to 4 mV associated with a decrease in input resistance up to 10 MOhms. Determination of the equilibrium potential of the <b>cromakalim</b> action revealed that the hyperpolarization {{is due to the}} activation of a potassium conductance. This cromakalim-activated potassium conductance was voltage-dependent, i. e. it increased with hyperpolarization. Among a number of potassium channel blockers tested, only Cs+ (2 mmol/l) and Ba 2 + (0. 5 mmol/ 1) were able to inhibit the cromakalim-induced effects. Simultaneously, both cations suppressed the hyperpolarizing inward rectification (anomalous rectification) in these neurons, indicating that <b>cromakalim</b> activated or potentiated an inwardly rectifying potassium conductance.

" The present study aimed at characterizing the effects of <b>cromakalim</b> on 86 Rb outflow, 45 Ca outflow and insulin release from prelabeled and perifused rat pancreatic islets. <b>Cromakalim</b> provoked a concentration-dependent reduction in 86 Rb outflow. This inhibitory effect was attenuated in islets exposed throughout to glibenclamide or to a Ca+(+) -free medium.

Lastly, <b>cromakalim</b> elicited a concentration-dependent inhibition of insulin release from islets perifused in the presence of glucose and extracellular Ca++. The present data suggest that the paradoxical inhibitory effect of <b>cromakalim</b> on 86 Rb outflow probably reflects the capacity of the drug to reduce the activity of the ATP-sensitive K+ channels and to indirectly inhibit the Ca+(+) -activated K+ channels.

Therefore, intracellular recordings were used to measure the effects of <b>cromakalim</b> on the membrane potential and input conductance of fibres from human skeletal muscle biopsies. <b>Cromakalim</b> in a concentration above 1 mol/l induced an increase in membrane K+ conductance. This effect resulted in a membrane hyperpolarization. The magnitude of this polarization depended on the difference between resting and K+ equilibrium potential. The effect had a rapid onset and was quickly reversible after washing. Fibres from two patients with hyperkalaemic periodic paralysis showed an excessive membrane depolarization during and also after exposure to an slightly elevated extracellular K+ concentration. In the latter situation, <b>cromakalim</b> repolarized the fibres to the normal resting potential.

Both agonists induced contractions by stimulating pharmacologically similar receptors, probably of the M 3 muscarinic subtype. The receptor reserve was larger, and the coupling between stimulation and contraction (E-C coupling) more efficient when ACh was the stimulating agonist. For stimulations that produced equal levels of muscle response, <b>cromakalim</b> was more efficacious in inhibiting contractions induced by pilocarpine. The efficacy of <b>cromakalim</b> in relaxing contractions induced by ACh increased when the number of functional receptors decreased. <b>Cromakalim</b> and nifedipine decreased the efficiency of E-C coupling for ACh and pilocarpine. <b>Cromakalim</b> efficacy decreased in a sigmoid manner when stimulating concentrations of ACh (and receptor occupancy) increased, and there was an inverse relationship between receptor occupancy by ACh and <b>cromakalim</b> efficacy. In the presence of TEA, a K+ channel blocker, nifedipine almost completely inhibited contractions induced by the M 3 muscarinic agonist bethanechol. These data indicate that in bovine tracheal smooth muscle, electro-mechanical coupling is an inherent part of muscarinic E-C coupling, but its functional expression is dependent upon the efficacy of stimulation.

Little is known about {{the influence of the}} mucosa on spontaneous contractions and whether the nature of these contractions differs between the bladder dome and trigone. MATERIALS AND METHODS Paired longitudinal strips of female pig bladders were isolated from the dome and trigone. The mucosa was removed from one strip per pair and tissues were set up in organ baths. Spontaneous activity was allowed to develop and recorded, and then cumulative concentration–response curves to <b>cromakalim</b> were obtained. The time needed for spontaneous contractions to develop, the frequency and amplitude of spontaneous contractions, and the effect of <b>cromakalim</b> were analysed. The strips of mucosa removed from the dome to produce denuded strips were also analysed by immunofluorescence using antibodies specific for vimentin and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA). RESULTS In the dome removal of the mucosa delayed the development of spontaneous contractions compared with mucosa-intact strips, whilst the trigone strips developed spontaneous contractions soon after set up in the organ baths irrespective of {{the presence or absence of}} mucosa. In the dome, <b>cromakalim</b> was more potent in suppressing spontaneous contractions when the mucosa was absent; whilst in the trigone the effects of <b>cromakalim</b> were similar in mucosa-intact and denuded strips. Upon examination of the strips of mucosa by immunofluorescence these strips were shown to contain cells positive for α-SMA or vimentin and cells positive for both, suggesting the presence of not only urothelium but also suburothelium and some detrusor smooth muscle bundles.

After 15, 20, or 30 min of ischemia, hearts were reperfused and noradrenaline content of the first 100 ml of reperfusate was measured. <b>Cromakalim</b> (n = 16) prevented the second rise of extracellular [K(+) ] in accordance with its cardioprotective effect. <b>Cromakalim</b> significantly reduced noradrenaline release after 15 min (mean, 169 +/- SEM 97 pmol/gr dry weight vs. control 941 +/- 278; p < 0. 05) and 20 min of ischemia (230 +/- 125 pmol/gr dry wt vs. control 1, 460 +/- 433; p < 0. 05), but after 30 min of ischemia, the difference in noradrenaline release was no longer significant (<b>cromakalim</b> 2, 703 +/- 1, 195 pmol/gr dry wt vs. control 5, 413 +/- 1, 310; p = 0. 08). Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia occurred in 10 of 13 control hearts (77 %) (n = 19), in six of 10 glibenclamide-treated hearts (60 %) (n = 15), and in six of 14 cromakalim-treated hearts (43 %) (p = NS). <b>Cromakalim</b> significantly accelerated onset of ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation (mean +/- SEM onset after 12. 5 +/- 1. 6 min ischemia vs. control 16. 2 +/- 0. 7 min; p < 0. 05). Noradrenaline release occurred only in cromakalim-treated hearts with early-onset arrhythmias whereas no noradrenaline release was observed in cromakalim-treated hearts without ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. Our results show that activation of the K(ATP) channel by <b>cromakalim</b> during ischemia reduces myocardial noradrenaline release and postpones the onset of irreversible damage, contributing to the cardioprotective potential of K(ATP) openers during myocardial ischemi...|$|E

Lemakalim (up to 100 μM) had no effect on potassium current in sinoatrial cells. Both Lemakalim and <b>Cromakalim</b> (100 μM) displayed a two-fold action on atrial myocytes: (1) they increased an outwardly rectifying conductance at potentials positive to EK and, (2) they markedly decreased a TTX-sensitive Na+ current active in the voltage range − 50 − 30 mV. This novel action on TTX-sensitive currents is of particular since these two benzopyrans have been thought to specifically target potassium channels...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAlthough {{there is}} {{evidence}} that diabetes affects seizure susceptibility, the underlying mechanism has not been completely understood. Several studies also suggest a pivotal role for KATP channels in the seizure modulation. The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the seizure threshold induced by pentylenetetrazole in diabetic mice at different times (3 days, 1 – 8 weeks) after induction of diabetes with streptozocin and to examine the possible role of ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels in this manner. Our data showed a time-dependent alteration in the threshold in diabetic mice, reaching a peak on week 2 after streptozocin injection and declining significantly afterwards. The seizure threshold in 8 -week diabetic mice was even lower than control levels, though the difference was not significant. The KATP channel opener <b>cromakalim</b> (0. 1 – 30 μg/kg, i. p.) significantly increased the seizure threshold in control mice. Although the KATP channel blocker glibenclamide (0. 5, 1 mg/kg) had no effect, it prevented the effects of the potent dose of <b>cromakalim</b> (30 μg/kg) on seizure threshold in control mice. Glibenclamide (1 mg/kg, i. p.) also decreased the seizure threshold in 2 -week diabetic mice to the control levels which was blocked by pre-treatment with <b>cromakalim</b> (10 μg/kg, i. p.). <b>Cromakalim</b> (10 μg/kg, i. p.) significantly increased the seizure threshold in 8 -week diabetic mice which was inhibited by pre-treatment with glibenclamide (1 mg/kg, i. p.). We demonstrated a time-dependent alteration in the pentylenetetrazole-induced seizure threshold in diabetic mice. This phenomenon might be due to the probable alteration in the KATP channel functioning during the diabetic condition...|$|E
40|$|With {{the aim of}} {{discovering}} new molecules with K+-channel activating properties, we have synthesized derivatives of <b>cromakalim</b> (CRK), an important molecule which shows specific affinity towards K+ channels, by replacing the benzopyrane ring of this reference compound with a 1, 4 -benzoxazine moiety. A different number of substituents showing a good discrimination between hydrophobic and electronic properties have been inserted at the 6 -position of the 1, 4 -benzoxazine ring. We describe here the synthesis and discuss the solid state conformation of these new molecules.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{evaluate}} the importance of the Na,K-pump in relaxations induced by KATP-channel openers in rabbit coronary small arteries. Arterial segments were mounted in myographs for recording of isometric tension. Whole-cell patch clamp was used to assess KATP-channel currents in isolated smooth muscle cells from the arteries. In arteries preconstricted with the thromboxane A 2 analogue U 46619 pinacidil and <b>cromakalim</b> induced concentration-dependent relaxations. In arteries preconstricted with potassium (124 mM) only high concentrations of pinacidil had a small relaxant effect. In arteries preconstricted with U 46619 pinacidil-induced relaxations were unaffected by pretreatment with Nω-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA) and only slightly reduced after mechanical removal of the endothelium. Pinacidil induced relaxations were not significantly affected by 1 μM glibenclamide. However, the relaxations were partly inhibited in potassium-free media and by 1 μM ouabain. In contrast, the concentration-dependent relaxation to <b>cromakalim</b> was partly blocked by 1 μM glibenclamide and partly by 1 μM ouabain and when both drugs were present the inhibition increased. Ouabain (1 μM) and glibenclamide (1 μM) each partly inhibited an ATP-sensitive current induced by pinacidil and <b>cromakalim.</b> In the presence of both inhibitors a greater inhibition was seen. When the solution in the patch pipette was sodium-free the current was reduced and ouabain had no effect. The study suggests that the relaxation to <b>cromakalim</b> and most likely pinacidil is mediated through opening of KATP channels. Inhibition of the Na,K-pump, however, may change the local environment for the KATP channels (i. e. increases the ATP/ADPratio and/or decreases the transmembrane potassium gradient), which partly prevents the activation of the KATP-channel current...|$|E
40|$|New 2 H- 1, 4 -benzoxazine {{derivatives}} were synthesized {{and tested}} for their agonist properties on the ATP-sensitive K+ channels (KATP) of native rat skeletal muscle fibres {{by using the}} patch-clamp technique. The novel modifications involved the introduction at position 2 of the benzoxazine ring of alkyl substituents such as methyl (–CH 3), ethyl (–C 2 H 5) or propyl (–C 3 H 7) groups, while maintaining pharmacophore groups critical for conferring agonist properties. The effects of these molecules were {{compared with those of}} <b>cromakalim</b> in {{the presence or absence of}} internal ATP (10 − 4 M). In the presence of internal ATP, all the compounds increased the macropatch KATP currents. The order of potency of the molecules as agonists was −C 3 H 7 (DE 50 = 1. 63 × 10 − 8 M) >−C 2 H 5 (DE 50 = 1. 11 × 10 − 7 M) >–CH 3 (DE 50 = 2. 81 × 10 − 7 M) >cromak-slim (DE 50 = 1. 42 × 10 − 5 M). Bell-shaped dose–response curves were observed for these compounds and <b>cromakalim</b> indicating a downturn in response when a certain dose was exceeded. In contrast, in the absence of internal ATP, all molecules including <b>cromakalim</b> inhibited the KATP currents. The order of increasing potency as antagonists was <b>cromakalim</b> (IC 50 = 1. 15 × 10 − 8 M) ⩾–CH 3 (IC 50 = 2. 6 × 10 − 8 M) >–C 2 H 5 (IC 50 = 4. 4 × 10 − 8 M) >–C 3 H 7 (IC 50 = 1. 68 × 10 − 7 M) derivatives. These results suggest that the newly synthesized molecules and <b>cromakalim</b> act on muscle KATP channel by binding on two receptor sites that have opposite actions. Alternatively, a more simple explanation is to consider the existence of a single site for potassium channel openers regulated by ATP which favours the transduction of the channel opening. The alkyl chains at position 2 of the 2 H- 1, 4 -benzoxazine nucleus is pivotal in determining the potency of benzoxazine derivatives as agonists or antagonists...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectivesThis {{study was}} done to {{estimate}} the potential neuroprotective role of potassium channel openers in cerebral ischemia–reperfusion (IR) injury in streptozotocin (STZ) induced type-I diabetic rats (T 1 DR). MethodsPotassium channel openers – <b>cromakalim,</b> cinnarizine and nicorandil; potassium channel blocker –glibenclamide, insulin (as an antidiabetic standard), telmisartan (as an anti-hypertensive standard agent) and vitamin E (as an antioxidant and antiapoptotic standard agent) were given for 3 days in streptozotocin (45 mg/kg i. v.) induced type I diabetic rats along with middle cerebral artery occlusion. After 24 h of surgery, plasma glucose, neurobehavioral score, cerebral infarct volume, blood pressure and caspase- 3 levels were measured to evaluate the mechanism of potassium channel openers (KCOs) for neuroprotection. ResultsFollowing STZ administration and ischemia–reperfusion, blood sugar, neurobehavioral score, cerebral infarct volume and caspase- 3 levels were significantly high in diabetic-IR groups. Treatment with <b>cromakalim,</b> cinnarizine, nicorandil, insulin and vitamin E significantly reduce neurobehavioral score while nicorandil and vitamin E significantly reduced cerebral infarct volume. Caspase- 3 levels were significantly reduced by <b>cromakalim</b> and nicorandil treated animals. Except insulin and glibenclamide, none of the agents significantly reduce plasma glucose levels. ConclusionTreatment of ischemic stroke with potassium channel openers in T 1 DR is neuroprotective. Inhibition of apoptosis may contribute to their neuroprotective effects after stroke in T 1 DR...|$|E

In this study, we investigate the mechanism(s) of Bdph-induced contraction in the tissue. Isolated trachea was bathed in 5 [*]mL of Krebs solution containing indomethacin (3 [*]μM), and its tension changes were isometrically recorded. <b>Cromakalim</b> (3 [*]μM), an ATP-dependent K+ channel opener, significantly antagonized the Bdph-induced enhancement of baseline tension.

Bdph (300 [*]μM) {{did not significantly}} influence the antagonistic effects of glibenclamide (GBC, 1 [*]μM) and tetraethylammonium (TEA, 8 [*]mM) against the cromakalim-induced relaxation. However, Bdph (300 [*]μM) and 4 -aminopiridine (4 -AP, 5 [*]mM), a blocker of Kv 1 family of K+ channels, in combination significantly rightward shifted the log concentration-relaxation curve of <b>cromakalim.</b> The antagonistic effect of the combination almost equals {{the sum of the}} individual effects of Bdph and 4 -AP, suggesting that the antagonistic mechanism of Bdph may be similar to that of 4 -AP.

The biological {{data indicate that}} most compounds were, like the reference molecule <b>cromakalim,</b> more active on the vascular smooth muscle tissue (myorelaxant effect on 30 mM KCl induced contractions of rat aorta rings) than on the pancreatic tissue (inhibition of 16. 7 mM glucose induced insulin release from rat pancreatic islets). However, some drugs (8 h, 8 i, 9 f, 9 g, 9 h, and 9 i) markedly inhibited insulin release and exhibited an activity equivalent or {{greater than that of}} diazoxide. Compounds 9 h and 9 i were also found to be more active on pancreatic beta-cells than on vascular smooth muscle cells. Last, the amide 6 b was selected in order to examine its mechanism of action on vascular smooth muscle cells. Pharmacological results suggest that the compound acted as a K(ATP) channel opener.
