It was first described and named by Nils A. E. Nordenskiöld when he traveled on Greenland's icecap in 1870.

Based on a set of derived objectives, the main features of the study are: What are the fundamental limits to miniaturisation?

What are the strategic and economic challenges of MST {{and the development of a}} sensor suite network? In general, there are few fundamental physical laws that limit the size of the sensor system. Limits tend to be driven by other factors including user requirements and the external environment. A simple breadboard model of the sensor suite consisting current COTS MST components raised practical issues such as circuit layouts, power requirements and packaging. A grid illustrating features of the Martian surface was created. Various patterns of target and sensor clusters were simulated. Overall, for larger target areas, clusters of sensors produced the best “hit rate”. The overall system utilises both wired and wireless communications methods.

In Polar freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems, cyanobacteria often constitute the major carbon fixers and the base of the food web.

Indeed, most of the Antarctic stations were constructed many years before the protocol of Madrid became operational, so that there are no data on the original state of these sites. Field observations, microscopy and molecular analyses (including DGGE and sequencing of cultured organisms) of terrestrial samples from the Utsteinen nunatak and ridge showed the presence of three bird species (Snow Petrel, South Polar Skua and Wilson’s Storm-Petrel), 21 lichen species, 1 moss species, 12 morphotypes of cyanobacteria, at least 880 strains of cultured bacteria, 9 different sequences of chlorophytes, a rotifer community but no diatoms.

Microscopy of the granules revealed that the granules contain bacteria with mucus like substance, and that {{the surface of the}} granules was covered with filamentous blue-green algae. These observations suggest that the granules are formed by algal and bacterial activity on the glaciers, and that the <b>cryoconite</b> includes a large amount of biological products. The amount of the <b>cryoconite</b> per unit area on the glacier surface was generally small (mean 48 g m^ in dry weight). In contrast, a large amount of the <b>cryoconite</b> was deposited at the bottom of <b>cryoconite</b> holes. The small amount of <b>cryoconite</b> on the glacier surface means that the effect of the <b>cryoconite</b> on albedo reduction of the glacier surface is small...|$|E

Journal of Glaciology, 57 (204), 651 - 657. There is growing recognition {{of the significance of}} biologically active supraglacial dust (<b>cryoconite)</b> for glacial mass balance and ecology. Nonetheless, the processes controlling the distribution, transport and fate of <b>cryoconite</b> particles in the glacial system remain somewhat poorly understood. Here, using a 216 hour time series of plot-scale (0. 04 m 2) images, we quantify the small-scale dynamics of <b>cryoconite</b> on Longyearbreen, Svalbard. We show significant fluctuations in the apparent <b>cryoconite</b> area and dispersion of <b>cryoconite</b> over the plot, within the 9 day period of observations. However, the net movement of <b>cryoconite</b> across the ice surface averaged only 5. 3 mm d? 1. High-resolution measurements of <b>cryoconite</b> granule motion showed constant, random motion but weak correlation with meteorological forcing factors and no directional trends for individual particle movement. The high-resolution time-series data suggest that there is no significant net transport of dispersed <b>cryoconite</b> material across glacier surfaces. The areal coverage and motion of particles within and between <b>cryoconite</b> holes appears to be a product of differential melting leading to changes in plot-scale microtopography, local meltwater flow dynamics and weather-dependent events. These subtle processes of <b>cryoconite</b> redistribution may be significant for supraglacial albedo and have bearing on the surface energy balance at the glacier scale. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|In the Polar Regions, Cyanobacteria {{represent}} key primary {{producers and}} are the main drivers of the food webs {{in a wide range}} of aquatic to terrestrial habitats. For example, they build benthic microbial mats in lakes and soil crusts in terrestrial biotopes. They may present interesting features to survive freeze/thaw cycles, seasonally contrasted light intensities, high UV radiations, dessication and other stresses. 	The BCCM/ULC public collection funded by the Belgian Science Policy Office since 2011 aims to gather a representative portion of the polar cyanobacterial diversity with different ecological origins (limnetic mats, soil crusts, <b>cryoconites,</b> endoliths…). It makes it available for researchers to study the taxonomy, evolution, adaptations to harsh environmental conditions, and genomic make-up. It presently includes 226 cyanobacterial strains, with 119 being of Antarctic origin (catalogue: [URL] An ISO 9001 certificate was obtained for the public deposition and distribution of strains, as part of the multi-site certification for the BCCM consortium. 	The morphological identification shows that the strains belong to the orders Synechococcales, Oscillatoriales, Pleurocapsales, Chroococcidiopsidales and Nostocales. The 16 S rRNA and ITS sequences of the strains are being characterized. Our results show that the Antarctic strains are positioned into 25 OTUs (sequences with > 97, 5 % 16 S rRNA similarity), and thus, represent a quite large diversity. 	In addition, cyanobacteria are known to produce a wide range of secondary metabolites (e. g. alkaloids, cyclic and linear peptides, polyketides) with bioactive potential. Among these bioactive metabolites, some display antibiotic, anticancer or antifungal effects. In collaboration with the BCCM/IHEM collection of biomedical fungi, a screening of cyanobacterial strains from BCCM/ULC was performed in order to discover potential new antifungal drugs. The analysis of a first set of methanol extracts from 15 different strains put in evidence the antifungal activity of a Phormidium priestleyi isolate. The latter remains active up to 0. 5 % (v/v) of fungal culture and was able to inhibit the growth of various fungal species among Candida, Cryptococcus, Aspergillus, and Penicillium. The raw extract was subjected to HPLC and a fraction containing the active molecule was obtained. This molecule appeared to be a thermostable hydrophobic compound. Moreover, in vitro toxicological analyses suggest that the compound has a general cytotoxic effect that could be inhibited by the mammalian metabolism. Further analyses are needed to identify the molecule and to determine if it could be a candidate for a new antifungal drug. 	In summary, the BCCM/ULC public collection serves as a Biological Resource Centre to conserve ex situ and document the biodiversity of polar cyanobacteria, as well as a repository for discovery of novel bioactive compounds...|$|R
40|$|<b>Cryoconite</b> is {{granular}} sediment {{found on}} glacier surfaces comprising both mineral and biological material.

Article No: 19468 <b>Cryoconite</b> holes are foci of unusually high microbial diversity and activity on glacier surfaces worldwide, comprising melt-holes {{formed by the}} darkening of ice by biogenic granular debris. Despite recent studies linking <b>cryoconite</b> microbial community structure to the functionality of <b>cryoconite</b> habitats, little is known of the processes shaping the <b>cryoconite</b> bacterial community. In particular, the assertions that the community is strongly influenced by aeolian transfer of biota from ice-marginal habitats {{and the potential for}} <b>cryoconite</b> microbes to inoculate proglacial habitats are poorly quantified despite their longevity in the literature. Therefore, the bacterial community structures of <b>cryoconite</b> holes on three High-Arctic glaciers were compared to bacterial communities in adjacent moraines and tundra using terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Distinct community structures for <b>cryoconite</b> and ice-marginal communities were observed. Only a minority of phylotypes are present in both habitat types, implying that <b>cryoconite</b> habitats comprise distinctive niches for bacterial taxa when compared to ice-marginal habitats. Curiously, phylotype abundance distributions for both <b>cryoconite</b> and icemarginal sites best fit models relating to succession.
