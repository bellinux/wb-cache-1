40|$|Purpose of Study: Several {{studies have}} {{examined}} <b>challenge</b> <b>and</b> threat via specific cardiovascular parameters in relation to sporting performance. However, limited evidence exists that utilises self-report measures of <b>challenge</b> <b>and</b> threat and the impact upon sport performance. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine self-report of <b>challenge</b> <b>and</b> threat and its association with shooting performance. Methodology: One hundred and two participants (Mean age= 26. 82, SD= 10. 01) were recruited for the study. A quasi-experimental study was implemented to explore the association between self-report measures of <b>challenge</b> <b>and</b> threat and its relationship with shooting performance. Cardiovascular (CV) parameters recorded during the experiment included cardiac output and total peripheral resistance due to their association with <b>challenge</b> <b>and</b> threat. Results: There was a significant proportion of variance accounted for by <b>challenge</b> <b>and</b> shooting performance (R²=. 42, p< 0. 05). As challenge report increased, shooting performance decreased (ß=-. 204, p< 0. 05). Moreover, when <b>challenge</b> <b>and</b> threat patterns were examined, the analysis indicated that moderate challenge/low threat had a more facilitative performance in the shooting task (Mean= 7. 96, SD= 1. 49) compared to all of the other combinations of <b>challenge</b> <b>and</b> threat patterns. In regard to CV measures, there was no significant associations observed between <b>challenge</b> <b>and</b> threat or shooting performance (p< 0. 05). Discussion and Conclusion: Higher levels of challenge are not ideal when completing a discrete motor skill task, such as shooting. These findings appear to suggest that a combination of moderate <b>challenge</b> <b>and</b> low threat may elicit a facilitative performance in regards to a discrete motor skill...|$|R
40|$|Introduction There is some {{contention}} {{within the}} existing literature examining <b>Challenge</b> <b>and</b> Threat in a sport context. It is suggested that <b>Challenge</b> <b>and</b> Threat can be experienced simultaneously (Cerin, 2003; Meijen et al, 2013); however this has been seldom examined. Based upon the suggestions of The Theory of <b>Challenge</b> <b>and</b> Threat in Athletes model (TCTSA; Jones et al, 2009) <b>Challenge</b> <b>and</b> Threat result in differing sport performance and have an impact upon emotions experienced. <b>Challenge</b> <b>and</b> Threat self-report was examined alongside shooting performance and emotions. Methodology One hundred and two participants (mean age= 26. 82, SD= 10. 01) were recruited for the study. A quasi-experimental study was implemented. Self-report of <b>Challenge</b> <b>and</b> Threat were collected alongside emotions via the Sport Emotion Questionnaire (Jones et al, 2005) with reference to a shooting task. Results There was {{a significant proportion of}} variance accounted for by <b>Challenge</b> <b>and</b> shooting performance (R²=. 42, p< 0. 05). As Challenge report increased, shooting performance decreased (ß=-. 204, p< 0. 05). Moreover, when <b>Challenge</b> <b>and</b> Threat patterns were examined, the analysis indicated that moderate Challenge/low Threat had a more facilitative performance in the shooting task (Mean= 7. 96, SD= 1. 49) compared to all of the other combinations of <b>Challenge</b> <b>and</b> Threat patterns. In regards to emotion moderate Challenge/low Threat reported lower amounts of happiness (mean= 1. 32, SD=. 88) and excitement (mean 1. 42, SD= 68) and moderate Challenge/moderate Threat reported more anxiety (mean= 2. 05, SD=. 69) than all of the other group combinations. Conclusion The study support suggestions that patterns of <b>Challenge</b> <b>and</b> Threat can have an impact upon performance, moreover emotions also differ between different patterns of <b>Challenge</b> <b>and</b> Threat. Future research should examine patterns of <b>Challenge</b> <b>and</b> Threat and the potential impact this has upon central tenants of the TCTSA model for example control. This study has implications for application to the applied field as the influence of <b>Challenge</b> <b>and</b> Threat has been shown to have an impact upon sporting performance...|$|R

5|$|Michael's {{hatred of}} Toby has been {{transferred}} to the new human resources representative, Holly Flax (Amy Ryan), and he and Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) plan to haze her. When she playfully affects disdain for Toby, Michael takes her seriously, and suddenly {{falls in love with}} her. Taking advice from Jim Halpert (John Krasinski), Michael succeeds in warming Holly up with small talk and jokes, and even tempers Toby's exit interview, which he had originally planned to be brutally insulting, because Holly attends. Dwight, however, continues the hazing, telling Holly that Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) is mentally <b>challenged,</b> <b>and</b> putting a raccoon in her car. When Michael catches Dwight trying to release a raccoon into Holly's car, he loudly proclaims his esteem for Holly. Holly gives special attention to Kevin throughout the episode due to her belief that he is mentally challenged, but Kevin believes her attention is a sexual interest in him.|$|E
5|$|Mobile's city {{commission}} form {{of government}} was <b>challenged</b> <b>and</b> finally overturned in 1982 in City of Mobile v.

Finding that the city had adopted a commission {{form of government}} in 1911 and at-large positions with discriminatory intent, the court proposed that the {{three members of the}} city commission should be elected from single-member districts, likely ending their division of executive functions among them. Mobile's state legislative delegation in 1985 finally enacted a mayor-council form of government, with seven members elected from single-member districts. This was approved by voters. As white conservatives increasingly entered the Republican Party in the late 20th century, African-American residents of the city have elected members of the Democratic Party as their candidates of choice. Since the change to single-member districts, more women and African Americans were elected to the council than under the at-large system.|$|E

While posted abroad, he met his mistress Marie Juliette Louvet, by whom he had a daughter, Charlotte Louise Juliette, born in Algeria in 1898. As Prince of Monaco, Louis II spent much time elsewhere, preferring to live on the family estate of Le Marchais close to Paris. In 1911 Prince Louis had a law passed legitimising his daughter so that she could inherit the throne, in order to prevent its passing to a distant German branch of the family. The law was <b>challenged</b> <b>and</b> developed into what became known as Monaco succession crisis.

5|$|British {{participants}} {{were involved in}} a number of controversies regarding the reallocation of medals during the Games. Shelly Woods was initially awarded the silver medal in the women's 5000m T54, but a rerun was ordered by the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) after the Australian, US and Swiss teams protested the result because six competitors {{were involved in a}} crash on the penultimate lap. When the race was rerun Woods won the bronze medal. David Weir believed he had won the gold medal in the men's 800m T54 but a rerun of the race was ordered after it was discovered that the Australian silver medallist, Kurt Fearnley, had begun the race in the wrong lane. Following a letter from Fearnley and the Australian authorities to the IPC, which asked that the result not be overturned in the spirit of sportsmanship, the rerun was cancelled and Weir's medal reinstated. Discus thrower Rebecca Chin was originally awarded the silver medal in the women's F37–38, but her classification was <b>challenged</b> <b>and</b> Chin was deemed ineligible for the event, stripped of her medal, and her results were erased. The decision was particularly controversial given that Chin had already been assessed earlier in the Games whilst she competed in the women's F37–38 shot put final.|$|E
5|$|During the 16th century, Josquin {{gradually}} {{acquired the}} {{reputation as the}} greatest composer of the age, his mastery of technique and expression universally imitated and admired. Writers as diverse as Baldassare Castiglione and Martin Luther wrote about his reputation and fame; theorists such as Heinrich Glarean and Gioseffo Zarlino held his style as that best representing perfection. He was so admired that many anonymous compositions were attributed to him by copyists, probably to increase their sales. More than 370 works are attributed to him; {{it was only after}} the advent of modern analytical scholarship that some of these attributions were <b>challenged,</b> <b>and</b> revealed as mistaken, on the basis of stylistic features and manuscript evidence. Yet in spite of Josquin's colossal reputation, which endured until the beginning of the Baroque era and was revived in the 20th century, his biography is shadowy, and virtually nothing is known about his personality. The only surviving work which may be in his own hand is a graffito {{on the wall of the}} Sistine Chapel, and only one contemporary mention of his character is known, in a letter to Duke Ercole I of Ferrara.

5|$|Gabbar Singh, the film's antagonist, {{was well}} {{received}} by the audience, despite his pervasive sadistic cruelty. Dissanayake explains that the audience {{was fascinated by the}} dialogues and mannerisms of the character, and this element of spectacle outweighed his actions, a first for Indian melodrama. He notes that the picturisation of violence in the film was glamourised and uninhibited. He further notes that, unlike earlier melodramas in which the female body occupies the audience's attention as an object of male fetish, in Sholay, the male body becomes the centrepiece. It becomes the battleground where good and evil compete for supremacy. Dissanayake argues that Sholay {{can be viewed as a}} national allegory: it lacks a comforting logical narrative, it shows social stability being repeatedly <b>challenged,</b> <b>and</b> it shows the devaluation of human life resulting from a lack of emotions. Taken together, these elements comprise the allegorical representation of India. The narrative style of Sholay, with its violence, revenge, and vigilante action, is occasionally compared by scholars to the political unrest in India at the time of its release. This tension culminated in the Emergency (rule by decree) declared by prime minister Indira Gandhi in 1975.|$|E
5|$|On 21 February 1809, a large French fleet under Admiral Jean-Baptiste Willaumez {{attempted}} to escape Brest and was chased by the blockade squadron and driven to shelter under the Ile d'Aix. Shortly afterwards, three French frigates {{attempted to}} break out of Lorient, but were <b>challenged</b> <b>and</b> destroyed at the Action of 24 February 1809. These operations were the preliminaries to the Battle of Basque Roads in April, but also provided the cover required for Troude's force to escape Lorient while the British were engaged elsewhere. Travelling rapidly across the Atlantic, the French encountered no British warships but were able to seize a number of lone British merchant ships, from whom Troude learned that the invasion of Martinique was already underway. While Troude's expedition had been preparing at Lorient, Cochrane had been preparing his own operation to Martinique, following the interception of the same despatches warning of the island's low morale and preparedness in the summer of 1808. Amassing an expeditionary force of 44 ships and 10,000 men at Carlisle Bay, Barbados, Cochrane began the invasion on 30 January 1809 and his troops rapidly overran the French defences, despite stiff resistance in the central highlands. By 10 February, the only remaining point in French hands was Fort Desaix, which held out until the magazine was breached on 24 February, at which point Governor Louis Thomas Villaret de Joyeuse surrendered unconditionally.|$|E
5|$|The second {{considered}} {{application is}} animal agriculture. Cochrane argues that animals possess concrete rights {{not to be}} made to suffer or be killed while being raised for food. The book argues that factory farming inflicts suffering upon the animals used, and this suffering outweighs the cost to humans of not using the method. Killing animals for their flesh is also <b>challenged,</b> <b>and</b> objections that this infringes on human liberty, that many humans would lose their jobs and that flesh-consumption is necessary for human health are all considered and rejected. Milk and egg production may be permissible under certain circumstances, provided animals are not killed or made to suffer, and, equally, animal corpses could be used provided that the animals have died naturally. Three counter arguments are considered. First, Cochrane contends that the fact farmed animals would not exist {{were it not for the}} human desire for their flesh is irrelevant: it is not clear that creating animals is good for them, and, even if it is, doing a good thing for an animal will not justify subsequently harming them, just as it would not in a human case. Second, Cochrane considers the fact that some animals are killed by nonhuman predators. He rejects Regan's claim that intervention is not required when killers are not moral agents and the consequentialist claim that interference will do more harm than good, instead suggesting that nonhuman predators need to kill to survive, but humans do not. Third, he considers the fact that animals are killed in the harvesting process. These animals, he suggests, are killed for human survival, but as fewer are killed than would be killed were humans eating meat, they do not possess a concrete right to life. Despite this, political communities must take steps to ensure that fewer animals are killed in harvest.|$|E

40|$|The aims of this {{research}} programme were to a. Further examine and develop an existing self-report measure of <b>Challenge</b> <b>and</b> Threat within a sport context, b. Examine <b>Challenge</b> <b>and</b> Threat self-report with performance in a sport context, c. Further examine the Biopsychosocial Model (BPSM) proposed in relation to <b>Challenge</b> <b>and</b> Threat and sport performance, d. Examine the associations between Challenge, Threat, cortisol response and sport performance, e. Examine self-report of emotions direction and intensity experienced during a sport performance in regard to <b>Challenge</b> <b>and</b> Threat <b>and</b> f. Examine <b>Challenge</b> <b>and</b> Threat in combination {{with each other in}} regard to sport performance. These 6 aims were addressed in 3 different empirical studies. Study 1 used a cross sectional study design to explore the validity and reliability of an existing self-report measure of <b>Challenge</b> <b>and</b> Threat. Participants were gym users (n= 200, Mage= 24. 91) and asked to complete the self-report measure before a dart-throwing competition. Study 2 comprised of three different stages. Stage 1; a cross sectional study design to examine the content validity of a pool of existing self-report items to measure <b>Challenge</b> <b>and</b> Threat in a range of athletes (n= 25, Mage= 22. 00). Participants comprised of male and female athletes engaged in various sports (football, n= 6, cricket, n= 2, swimming, n= 5, tennis, n= 1, rugby, n= 6, netball, n= 3, basketball, n= 2.). Stage 2, used a cross sectional study design to further examine the construct validity of the remaining items from stage 1. This stage used principle components analysis (PCA) to determine whether <b>Challenge</b> <b>and</b> Threat self-report items were grouped in a particular way (Kline, 1994). Participants were competitive runners (n= 197, Mage= 37. 11) and asked to complete the self-report measure regarding <b>Challenge</b> <b>and</b> Threat before competition. Stage 3 used a cross sectional study design to explore the validity and reliability of the self-report measure of <b>Challenge</b> <b>and</b> Threat developed in stages 1 - 2 in competitive runners (n= 147, Mage = 30. 06), using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to examine how well the data total fitted the proposed hypothetical model. Finally a quasi-experimental study (study 3) examined the association between <b>Challenge</b> <b>and</b> Threat and shooting performance. This study explored the <b>Challenge</b> <b>and</b> Threat self-report measure and its relationship with performance, emotions and physiological responses. Participants in this study comprised of university student and staff members (n= 102, Mage = 27. 11). Results from study 1 suggested that the existing self-report measure of <b>Challenge</b> <b>and</b> Threat utilised was not suitable for use within a sport context. Results from study 2, stage 1, revealed a pool of self-report items that athletes described as applicable and relevant to their sports performance. Results from study 2, stage 2, suggested that items identified in study 2, stage 1 represented a two component solution, one associated with Threat <b>and</b> the other <b>Challenge.</b> Results from study 2, stage 3 suggested that a 12 item self-report measure was suitable for use within a sport context <b>and</b> that <b>Challenge</b> has a positive association with sport performance. Finally, study 3, suggested that the self-report measure of <b>Challenge</b> <b>and</b> Threat developed in study 2 (stages 1 - 3) was suitable for use within a sport context. Results from study 3 also suggest that a mixture of <b>Challenge</b> <b>and</b> Threat can have implications for performance outcome. Emotions reported were shown to have associations with <b>Challenge</b> <b>and</b> Threat self-report, as suggested by The Theory of <b>Challenge</b> <b>and</b> Threat States in Athletes (TCTSA).

5|$|This {{cycle of}} growth and {{dormancy}} strings together volcanoes over millions of years, {{leaving a trail of}} volcanic islands and seamounts across the ocean floor. According to Wilson's theory, the Hawaiian volcanoes should be progressively older and increasingly eroded the further they are from the hotspot, and this is easily observable; the oldest rock in the main Hawaiian islands, that of Kauai, is about 5.5 million years old and deeply eroded, while the rock on Hawaii island is a comparatively young 0.7 million years of age or less, with new lava constantly erupting at Kīlauea, the hotspot's present center. Another consequence of his theory is that the chain's length and orientation serves to record the direction and speed of the Pacific Plate's movement. A major feature of the Hawaiian trail is a sudden 60° bend at a 40- to 50-million-year-old section of its length, and according to Wilson's theory, this is evidence of a major change in plate direction, one that would have initiated subduction along much of the Pacific Plate's western boundary. This part of the theory has recently been <b>challenged,</b> <b>and</b> the bend might be attributed to the movement of the hotspot itself.|$|E

40|$|Objectives This study {{examined}} the relationship between the cognitive and affective components of the theory of <b>challenge</b> <b>and</b> threat states in athletes (TCTSA). It was expected that cognitive components, specifically self-efficacy, perceived control, and achievement goals, predict <b>challenge</b> <b>and</b> threat appraisals and emotional states, as well as the interpretation of emotional state. Design A cross-sectional design was employed to measure self-efficacy, perceived control, achievement goals, emotional state, interpretation of emotional state, <b>and</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>and</b> threat cognitive appraisal in relation to how participants typically approach an important competition. Method 177 collegiate athletes completed questionnaires measuring the cognitive and affective components of <b>challenge</b> <b>and</b> threat states. Results A regression analysis was performed to examine if cognitive elements predicted <b>challenge</b> <b>and</b> threat appraisals and emotions. Threat appraisal was predicted by avoidance goals and emotions were predicted by cognitive components. There was a negative association between anxiety and self-efficacy and a positive association between anxiety and avoidance goals. Also, differences between <b>challenge</b> <b>and</b> threat appraisal patterns (high challenge/high threat, high challenge/low threat, low challenge/high threat, low challenge/low threat) were analysed. Participants with a high <b>challenge</b> <b>and</b> low threat appraisals pattern scored higher on self-efficacy and lower on avoidance goals and anxiety than other challenge/threat patterns. Conclusions The results provide support for the TCTSA. What athletes think, based on their cognitive components, influences the emotions they experience, and their approaches to competition...|$|R
