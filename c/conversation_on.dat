5|$|Meanwhile, Groves had {{met with}} J.

Groves was impressed with the breadth of Oppenheimer's knowledge. A long <b>conversation</b> <b>on</b> a train in October 1942 convinced Groves and his deputy Kenneth Nichols that Oppenheimer thoroughly understood the issues involved in setting up a laboratory in a remote area. These were features that Groves found lacking in other scientists, and he knew that broad knowledge would be vital in an interdisciplinary project that would involve not just physics, but chemistry, metallurgy, ordnance and engineering.|$|E

They are fleeing from Crete, where the pair have been complicit in the slaying of Ariadne's monster half-brother, the Minotaur, in the labyrinth below the palace of her father, King Minos. Venus is aware that Theseus intends to abandon Ariadne on Naxos, and to proceed to Athens alone. Cupid offers to rekindle Theseus's passion for Ariadne, but Venus has decided to unite her with the god Bacchus, and asks Cupid to arrange this.|$|E

5|$|One of Groves' early {{problems}} {{was to find}} a director for Project Y, the group that would design and build the bomb. The obvious choice was one of the three laboratory heads, Urey, Lawrence, or Compton, but they could not be spared. Compton recommended Oppenheimer, who was already intimately familiar with the bomb design concepts. However, Oppenheimer had little administrative experience, and, unlike Urey, Lawrence, and Compton, had not won a Nobel Prize, which many scientists felt that the head of such an important laboratory should have. There were also concerns about Oppenheimer's security status, as many of his associates were Communists, including his brother, Frank Oppenheimer; his wife, Kitty; and his girlfriend, Jean Tatlock. A long <b>conversation</b> <b>on</b> a train in October 1942 convinced Groves and Nichols that Oppenheimer thoroughly understood the issues involved in setting up a laboratory in a remote area and should be appointed as its director. Groves personally waived the security requirements and issued Oppenheimer a clearance on 20 July 1943.|$|E

Former Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Arens also opposes continued US aid, arguing that Israel no longer needs it.

25|$|On {{their first}} tours, Fugazi worked out its DIY {{aesthetic}} {{by trial and}} error. The group's decisions were partly motivated by pragmatic considerations that were essentially a punk rock version of simple living: for example, selling merchandise on tour would require a full-time merchandise salesperson who would require lodging, food, and other costs, so Fugazi decided to simplify their touring by not selling merchandise. The band was also motivated by moral or ethical considerations: for example, Fugazi's members regarded pricey admission for rock concerts as tantamount to price gouging a performer's most loyal fans. Fugazi's inexpensive target goal of $5 admission was spawned during a <b>conversation</b> <b>on</b> an early tour when the band's members were debating the lowest profitable admission price.|$|E
25|$|Lord Ashley {{now retired}} to the Netherlands, {{where he became}} acquainted with Jean Leclerc, Pierre Bayle, Benjamin Furly, the English Quaker merchant, at whose house Locke had resided during his stay at Rotterdam, and {{probably}} Limborch {{and the rest of}} the literary circle of which Locke had been a cherished and honoured member nine or ten years before. To Lord Ashley this society was probably far more congenial than his surroundings in England. Unrestrained <b>conversation</b> <b>on</b> the topics which most interested him—philosophy, politics, morals, religion—was at this time to be had in the Netherlands with less danger and in greater abundance than in any other country in the world. To the period of this sojourn in the Netherlands must probably be referred the surreptitious impression or publication of an imperfect edition of the Inquiry concerning Virtue, from a rough draught, sketched when he was only twenty years of age. This liberty was taken, during his absence, by Toland.|$|E

25|$|Later {{that year}} Suzuki spent {{a short time}} in the {{hospital}} with tuberculosis, but soon recovered. In 1927 an important chapter in Suzuki's life was turned. He went to visit a teacher in England he had at Komazawa named Miss Nona Ransom, a woman who had taught English to such people as the last emperor of China, Pu-yi, and more so his wife, the last empress of China, Jigoro Kano (the Founder of Judo), the children of Chinese president Li Yuanhong, and some members of the Japanese royal family. She hired him that day to be a translator and to help with errands. Through this period he realized she was very ignorant of Japanese culture and the religion of Buddhism. She respected it very little and saw it as idol worship. But one day, when there were no chores to be done, the two had a <b>conversation</b> <b>on</b> Buddhism that changed her mind. She even let Suzuki teach her zazen meditation. This experience is significant in that Suzuki realized that Western ignorance of Buddhism could be transformed.|$|E
25|$|Looking {{into the}} new millennium, the <b>conversation</b> <b>on</b> a National level turned {{to the role of}} {{religion}} in ritual. In 1968, Theta Phi opened its doors to women of all faith and replaced the crucifix used in ritual to a cross. In 1988, there was discussion of removing the cross in ritual. The discussion was tabled during convention but it was decided that the cross would have a less prominent role in ritual In 1990, Theta Phi Alpha surveyed the sisters about the Catholic influences in the ritual. The most positive response was to adjusting the ritual to match the current views of the national fraternity, while the most negative response was to removing all references to God in the ritual. This dissonance between the sisters is still discussed today. However, Theta Phi Alpha is slowly removing religious aspects, in 1990 the Lord's Prayer was removed from the ritual. In 1992, the Theta Phi Alpha Prayer was removedand the following year a less religious ritual for deceased members and a nonreligious national philanthropy, The House that Theta Phi Alpha Built were introduced.|$|E
25|$|While repressive {{measures}} were relaxed {{starting in the}} mid-1970s, gaining new converts proved difficult. One method involved members traveling in pairs by train, starting a <b>conversation</b> <b>on</b> religious topics and beginning to proselytize after gaining the interest of others in their compartment. Another strategy was to start religious discussions in cemeteries or in crowded areas like rail and bus stations. The Watchtower was sent into Romania in English, translated by Witnesses into Romanian, the manuscript sent into Austria and copies then brought back into Romania, distributed to members and used in conversion efforts. According to British political scientist Tom Gallagher, by the 1980s, one source of converts to the Witnesses, {{as well as to}} Protestant denominations, was the new working class housed in urban high-rise settlements, as the Orthodox hierarchy was reluctant {{to take care of this}} group's religious needs. In an interview with the World Council of Churches' official magazine, Metropolitan Antonie Plămădeală of the dominant Romanian Orthodox Church said that gaining official recognition would have been very difficult for Jehovah's Witnesses in Romania because of their attitude toward the Communist state and to military service, but it would not have been impossible if the state had better understood their views and been less paranoid. He claimed that if they kept a low profile and were not active against the state, the authorities would be unconcerned about them.|$|E
