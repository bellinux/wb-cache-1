60|$|In conclusion, {{let me add}} {{one word}} of warning as to certain popular errors about the young fry of sundry {{well-known}} species. Nothing is more common than to hear it asserted that sprats are only immature herring. This is a complete mistake. Believe it not. Sprats are a very distinct species of the herring genus, and they never grow much bigger than when they appear, brochés, at table. The largest adult sprat measures only six inches, while full-grown herring may attain as much as fifteen. Moreover, herring have teeth on the palate, always wanting in sprats, by which means the species may be readily distinguished at all ages. When in doubt, therefore, do not play trumps, but examine the palate. On the other hand, whitebait, long {{supposed to be a}} distinct species, has now been proved by Dr. Günther, the greatest of ichthyologists, to consist chiefly of the fry or young of herring. To complete our discomfiture, the same eminent authority has also shown that the pilchard and the sardine, which we thought so unlike, {{are one and the same}} fish, called by different names according as he is caught off the Cornish coast or in Breton, Portuguese, or Mediterranean waters. Such aliases are by no means uncommon among his class. To say the plain truth, fish are the most variable and ill-defined of animals; they differ so much in different habitats, so many hybrids occur between them, and varieties merge so readily by imperceptible stages into one another, that only an expert can decide in doubtful cases--and every expert carefully reverses the last man's opinion. Let us at least be thankful that whitebait by any other name would eat as nice; that science has not a single whisper to breathe against their connection with lemon; and that whether they are really the young of <b>Clupea</b> <b>harengus</b> or not, the supply at Billingsgate shows no symptom of falling short of the demand.|$|E

50|$|The {{distinction}} between demersal {{species of fish}} and pelagic species is not always clear cut. The Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) is a typical demersal fish, but {{can also be found}} in the open water column, and the Atlantic herring (<b>Clupea</b> <b>harengus)</b> is predominantly a pelagic species but forms large aggregations near the seabed when it spawns on banks of gravel.|$|E
50|$|The {{recipe is}} often mistranslated into English, with {{anchovies}} being substituted for sprats. This is because sprats (Sprattus sprattus) pickled in sugar, salt and spices {{have been known}} in Sweden as ansjovis {{since the middle of}} the 19th century, while true anchovies (Engraulis encrasicolus) are sold in Sweden as sardeller (sardelles). Also, small herrings (<b>Clupea</b> <b>harengus)</b> may be used instead of sprats.|$|E
50|$|Atlantic herring (<b>Clupea</b> <b>harengus)</b> is a herring in {{the family}} Clupeidae. It {{is one of the}} most {{abundant}} fish species in the world. Atlantic herrings can be found on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, congregating in large schools. They can grow up to 45 cm in length and weigh up to 1.1 kg. They feed on copepods, krill and small fish, while their natural predators are seals, whales, cod and other larger fish.|$|E
50|$|Haisborough Sands and its {{surrounding}} shoals {{are known to be}} spawning grounds for Sand eels Ammodytes, Lemon sole Microstormus Kitt and sole Solea solea.

There are small numbers of Harbour porpoise regularly observed within the boundaries of the sands. The common seals Phoca vitulina which are resident in the Wash are occasionally observed in this area.|$|E
5000|$|Adult herring are {{harvested}} for their meat and eggs, {{and they are}} often used as baitfish. The trade in herring is an important sector of many national economies. In Europe the fish {{has been called the}} [...] "silver of the sea", and its trade has been so significant to many countries that it has been regarded as the most commercially important fishery in history.

50|$|Clupea is genus of planktivorous bony fish {{belonging}} to the family Clupeidae, commonly known as herrings. They {{are found in the}} shallow, temperate waters of the North Pacific and the North Atlantic oceans, including the Baltic Sea. Three species of Clupea are recognized. The main taxa, the Atlantic herring (<b>Clupea</b> <b>harengus)</b> and the Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii) may each be divided into subspecies. Herrings are forage fish moving in vast schools, coming in spring to the shores of Europe and America, where they form important commercial fisheries.|$|E
50|$|The small-sized herring in {{the inner}} parts of the Baltic Sea, which is also less fatty than the true Atlantic herring, is {{considered}} a distinct subspecies (<b>Clupea</b> <b>harengus</b> membras) ("Baltic herring"), {{despite the lack of}} a distinctive genome. The Baltic herring has a specific name in many local languages (Swedish strömming, Finnish silakka, Estonian räim, silk, Livonian siļk, Russian салака, Polish śledź bałtycki, sałaka, Latvian reņģes, Lithuanian strimelė) and is popularly and in cuisine considered distinct from herring. For example, the Swedish dish surströmming is made from Baltic herring.|$|E

Once comprising a highly diverse and rich ecosystem the Firth of Clyde marine environment has seen dramatic alterations throughout the last 200 years. [...] During the 19th century, diverse mixed fisheries existed in the Firth of Clyde for herring (<b>Clupea</b> <b>harengus),</b> cod (Gadus morhua), haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus), turbot (Psetta maxima) {{and a variety of}} other species.|$|E
50|$|A Chorkor oven is an oven {{used for}} fish smoking. It gets {{its name from}} Chorkor, a fishing village and suburb of the capital of Ghana, Accra. In Chorkor, this oven is widely used for smoke-drying {{sardinella}} (in Ghana also known as 'herring', {{not to be confused}} with the real herring <b>Clupea</b> <b>harengus)</b> and other fish. The Chorkor oven was an improvement of the traditional rectangular oven with a fixed surface. It was developed in the early 1970s by the Ghana Food Research Institute in collaboration with the women of Chorkor village and assisted by an FAO project.|$|E
50|$|The cold waters, extreme tidal mixing, {{and diverse}} {{bottom of the}} Gulf make {{it one of the}} most {{productive}} marine environments in the North Atlantic, and it furnishes habitat for many diverse species including most notably Haddock, the Acadian redfish (Sebastes fasciatus), the Atlantic herring (<b>Clupea</b> <b>harengus)</b> and the American lobster (Homarus americanus), which grows to famously large sizes in the Gulf. The waters of the Gulf of Maine system, particularly at the boundary with the Bay of Fundy are also home to the summering grounds for many different bird and whale species, most notably the highly endangered North Atlantic right whale.|$|E

50|$|The {{variety of}} {{habitats}} {{and the large}} volume of plankton on the surface support prolific marine life. Energy moves from the top to the bottom according to Vinogradov's ladder of migrations; that is, some species are benthic and others pelagic, but there are graded marine layers within which species move vertically for short distances. In addition, some species are benthopelagic, moving between surface and bottom. The benthic species include Coryphaenoides rupestris, Argentina silus, Etmopterus spinax, Chimaera monstrosa and Glyptocephalus cynoglossus. On the top are <b>Clupea</b> <b>harengus,</b> Scomber scombrus, Sprattus sprattus. Some species that move between are Pandalus borealis, Sabinea sarsi, Etmopterus spinax.|$|E

50|$|Scientific {{investigations}} {{aboard the}} ATOLL concentrated {{on one of}} the most important food chain transitions: the linkages between the early life stages of herring (<b>Clupea</b> <b>harengus)</b> and their principal prey, the copepods. A major hypotheses of fisheries ecologists is that the microdistribution of prey, the microturbulence of the ocean, or the retention conditions are normally not suited to allow strong year classes of fish to develop. In most years more than 99% of herring larvae do not survive. Occasionally however, physical and biotic conditions are favorable, larval survival is high, and large year-classes result. Research work at the ATOLL investigated the effects of small-scale dynamics on fish feeding and predator avoidance and their correlation to year-class strength.|$|E
50|$|In 1988, {{the first}} marine strain of VHSV, now {{designated}} type IV, {{was found in}} normal-appearing salmon returning from the Pacific to rivers of Washington State. This strain and other marine strains were not lethal to rainbow trout. The discovery prompted further studies, and by the mid-1990s, marine VHSV was found in eight species along the northern North America's Pacific coast, and 14 species {{in and around the}} Atlantic's North Sea.1996 saw the first VHSV in Japan, among Japanese flounder farmed in the Seto Inland Sea, and different genotypes have appeared in different areas since then. Type IV was later found off North America's northern Atlantic coast,in Atlantic herring (<b>Clupea</b> <b>harengus)</b> mummichog (Fundulus heteroclitus), stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus aculeatus), brown trout (Salmo trutta), and striped bass (Morone saxatilis), as well as dozens of freshwater species in the Great Lakes.|$|E
50|$|In 1866 the Royal Commission on the Sea Fisheries, which {{included}} among its officers Professor Thomas Henry Huxley, had reported that fears of over-exploitation {{of the sea}} fisheries were unfounded. They recommended removing existing laws regulating fishing grounds and closed seasons. However, {{the increase in the}} size and number of fishing vessels was causing widespread concern, and there were reports from all around the UK coasts about the scarcity of particular fish. This concern was expressed at the International Fisheries Exhibition in London in 1883, a conference called to discuss the commercial and scientific aspects of the fishing industry, and which was attended by many leading scientists of the day. Nevertheless, in his opening address, Huxley discounted reports of fish scarcities and repeated the views of the Royal Commission of 1866. He stated that with existing methods of fishing, it was inconceivable that the great sea fisheries, such as those for cod (Gadus morhua), herring (<b>Clupea</b> <b>harengus)</b> and mackerel (Scomber scombrus), could ever be exhausted.|$|E
50|$|Fisheries {{investigations}} {{were conducted}} in the 1970s by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection to determine the fishery composition and life stages of estuarine fish using this specific bay. Sixty-six species were caught during these studies and, as in the Barnegat system, the catches were dominated by forage species, with bay anchovy and Atlantic silverside (Menidia menidia) being very abundant. The top ranked fish by their relative abundance were: bay anchovy (Anchoa mitchilli), Atlantic silverside (Menidia menidia), silver perch (Bairdiella chrysoura), alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus), striped killifish (Fundulus majalis), sea herring (<b>Clupea</b> <b>harengus),</b> white perch (Morone americana), northern puffer (Sphoeroides maculatus), oyster toadfish (Opsanus tau), and striped anchovy (Anchoa hepsetus). Commercial fisheries activities include the harvest of northern quahog (Mercenaria mercenaria), blue crab (Callinectes sapidus), white perch, winter flounder, and American eel (Anguilla rostrata). The bay is an important spawning and nursery area for blue crab. The area between Graveling Point and the Wading River tributaries supports large eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) beds, {{many of which are}} considered extremely productive seed beds.|$|E
50|$|Like most gulls, {{they also}} capture fish with some {{regularity}} and will readily capture any fish smaller than itself found {{close to the}} surface of the water. Whether caught or eaten after death or injury from other sources, stomach contents of great black-backed gulls usually show fish to be the primary food. On Sable Island in Nova Scotia, 25% of the stomach contents were comprised by fish but 96% of the regurgitations given to young was made up fish. Similarly, on Great Island in Newfoundland, 25% of the stomach contents were fish but 68% of regurgitants were fish. The most regularly reported fish eaten in Nova Scotia and Newfoundland were capelin (Mallotus villosus), Atlantic cod (Gadus morrhua), Atlantic tomcod (Microgadus tomcod), Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus), Atlantic herring (<b>Clupea</b> <b>harengus)</b> and sand lance (Ammodytes hexapterus). Other prey often includes various squid, Jonah crabs (Cancer borealis), rock crabs (Cancer irroratus), sea urchins, green crabs (Carcinus maenas), starfish (Asterias forbesi and Asterias rubens) and other echinoderms, crustaceans and mollusks when they come across the opportunity. From observations in northern New England, 23% of observed prey was echinoderms and 63% was crustaceans.|$|E
5000|$|The Pillar Point Harbor at the {{northern}} edge of Half Moon Bay offers a protected landing for boats and provides other marine infrastructure. In the late 1980s a new master plan was developed for the Harbor. [...] A variety of fish species have been identified in the harbor area. The most abundant fish include flatfish, particularly the speckled sanddab (Citharichthys stigmaeus) and the commercially important English sole (Parophrys vetulus), several species of rockfish (Sebastes sp.) with boccacio (S. paucispinis) most abundant, many members of the surfperch family, the most abundant being shiner (Cymanogaster aggregata) and dwarf surfperches (Micrometrus minimus), and the commercially important Pacific herring (<b>Clupea</b> <b>harengus).</b> Smaller populations of many other species, including significant commercial or sport species such as various surfperch, flatfish including halibut (Paralichthys californicus), lingcod (Ophiodon elongatus), and cabezon (Scoraenichthys marmotarus) also are found in the harbor during the summer. Abundant winter species include starry flounder (Platichthys stellatus) and topsmelt (Atherinops affinis). At Pillar Point Harbor, fishermen sell crab and fish catches straight off their boats at discount prices directly to the public, and restaurants will fillet the fish for purchasers.|$|E
50|$|Coastal marshes, bays, tidal creeks, {{and rivers}} support diverse {{shellfish}} and finfish populations. Sunfish (Lepomis species), creek chub (Semotilus atromaculatus), cunner (Tautogolabrus adspersus), golden shiner (Notemigonus crysoleucas), common mummichog (Fundulus heteroclitus), American eel (Anguilla rostrata), and white sucker (Catostomus commersoni) abound. Brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) and brown trout (Salmo trutta) are stocked in rivers and estuaries each year. The Ogunquit River sustains alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus), blueback herring (Alosa aestivalis), pollock (Pollachius virens), bluefish (Pomatomus saltatrix), longhorn sculpin (Myoxocephalus octodecimspinosus), and winter flounder (Pleuronectes americanus). The Webhannet River has native {{species such as}} winter flounder, northern pipefish (Syngnathus fuscus), Atlantic herring (<b>Clupea</b> <b>harengus),</b> common mummichog, Atlantic silversides (Menidia menidia) and Atlantic mackerel. The Merriland River sustains populations of American eel, brown trout, and brook trout. The Mousam River attracts little skate (Raja erinacea), American shad (Alosa sapidissima), striped bass (Morone saxatilis), bluefish, cunner, Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus), pollock, and rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax). The Spurwink River supports blueback herring, Atlantic menhaden (Brevoortia tyrannus), American shad, pollock, cunner, winter flounder, and little skate. Striped bass and brown trout are popular recreational fishing resources in the area. The National Marine Fisheries Service has designated as “essential fish habitat” areas that provide substrate necessary for fish spawning, breeding, feeding, or growth to maturity. Estuaries within the refuge boundaries are part of that essential fish habitat.|$|E
