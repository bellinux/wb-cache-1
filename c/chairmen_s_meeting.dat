40|$|This {{article is}} {{a study of the}} {{development}} and role of early Quaker women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Meetings</b> {{during the second half of}} the seventeenth century. It is based upon the contemporary records of the Owstwick women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> Monthly <b>Meeting,</b> held in the East Riding of Yorkshire. Rather than focussing upon the individual travelling Quaker female ministers or their writings, as the historiography has tended to, it examines the everyday organisation and responsibilities that were held by early Quaker women. It argues that although the women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Meetings</b> were regarded as inferior to those of the men, they evolved alongside each other and operated in tandem, each with their own areas of responsibility. This allowed women to gain status as a group, rather than as individuals, in the early Quaker movement...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the ELISA speaker segmentation approach applied on multiple audio channel meeting recordings {{in the framework}} of NIST RT’ 04 <b>s</b> <b>meeting</b> (spring) evaluation campaign. As done for BN data speaker segmentation, the ELISA “meeting ” system involves two speaker segmentation systems developed individually by the CLIPS and LIA laboratories. The main originality consists in a “two-axis” merging strategy, proposed to deal with both multiple expert segmentation outputs and multiple microphone segmentation outputs. While expert merging strategy did not really lead to an improvement of the performance, the individual microphone segmentation merging strategy allowed to provide a global segmentation output from several audio channels (microphones) with acceptable performance. The best system obtained 22. 6 % of diarization error rate during the NIST RT’ 04 <b>s</b> <b>meeting</b> evaluation. 1...|$|R
