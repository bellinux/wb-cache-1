5|$|Ashlynn Yennie as Jenny, {{the rear}} {{section of the}} <b>centipede.</b> As with Williams, The Human <b>Centipede</b> was Yennie's first major film role. Yennie {{was one of several}} actresses to {{audition}} for the role, as the producers searched for an actress who would have good on-screen chemistry with Williams. Yennie was able to further develop her relationship with Williams when the pair shared an apartment in the Netherlands during filming. Yennie auditioned to Ilona Six, sister of Tom Six and the film's producer, and did not meet Tom Six, who had viewed tapes of her reading, until fitting for the <b>centipede</b> special effects in the Netherlands. Yennie was drawn to the role by the humanity throughout the story, referring to how the three victims of Heiter are unwillingly forced into their situation. She also said the story was so realistic it scared her.|$|E
5|$|Once the {{operation}} is complete, Heiter attempts to train his <b>centipede</b> as a pet, often belittling Katsuro with racist insults and beating him with a crop when he becomes rebellious. When Katsuro defecates, Lindsay is forced to swallow his excrement while the doctor watches in delight. However, he eventually becomes irritated after being kept awake by the constant screaming of Katsuro (who, as the front part of the <b>centipede,</b> has his mouth free and is still able to speak) and the realization that Jenny is dying from septicemia. When two detectives, Kranz (Andreas Leupold) and Voller (Peter Blankenstein), visit the house to investigate the disappearance of tourists, Heiter comes {{up with an idea}} to add them as replacements for Jenny in a new creation; a four-segment <b>centipede.</b> He offers the two detectives water spiked with sedatives in hopes of knocking the two unconscious. After being given the water, the detectives become suspicious and obtain a search warrant for his home. While the detectives leave Heiter's home, the victims attempt to escape. Katsuro attacks Heiter in the process. Their attempt to escape ultimately fails. Katsuro confesses to the doctor that he deserves his fate because he had treated his own family poorly, then commits suicide by slitting his throat with a glass shard.|$|E
5|$|The Human <b>Centipede</b> was {{released}} in the United Kingdom on DVD and Blu-ray on 4 October 2010 and in the US the following day, where, as of September 2011, DVD sales have totalled $2,113,186.|$|E
50|$|Lithobius {{is a large}} genus of <b>centipedes</b> in {{the family}} Lithobiidae, {{commonly}} called stone <b>centipedes,</b> common <b>centipedes</b> or brown <b>centipedes.</b>|$|R
25|$|Unlike {{most other}} <b>centipedes,</b> house <b>centipedes</b> and their close {{relatives}} have well-developed faceted eyes.|$|R

5|$|Phoenix and the {{surrounding}} areas are also home {{to a wide variety}} of native invertebrates including the Arizona bark scorpion, giant desert hairy scorpion, Arizona blond tarantula, Sonoran Desert <b>centipede,</b> tarantula hawk wasp, camel spider, and tailless whip scorpion. Of great concern is the presence of Africanized bees which can be extremely dangerous—even lethal—when provoked.|$|E
5|$|Skye {{tries to}} defend them both, {{but when the}} team finds {{evidence}} that Lydon was paid substantially for the information, she turns on him and cooperates with the agents. The team tracks the buyer, Raina, to a Project <b>Centipede</b> facility in Hong Kong, where they are draining Chan's fire-resistant platelets against his will, to use as stabilizers for the extremis serum within their super-soldiers. Chan, angry with this betrayal and with S.H.I.E.L.D. for constricting him, attacks both. He kills, among others, Quan and the <b>Centipede</b> head doctor Debbie. Realizing that Chan can't be reasoned with, Coulson and May inject him with a large dose of extremis, causing him to explode. Lydon, convinced that what he did is harming people, helps by using his hacking skills to direct the blast through the ventilation and out {{the top of the}} building, while the others escape to safety.|$|E
5|$|Akihiro Kitamura as Katsuro, a Japanese tourist {{and front}} {{section of the}} <b>centipede.</b> Having already acted in or written {{for a number of}} films and {{television}} shows (including popular American television series Heroes), Kitamura was a relatively experienced actor compared to other cast members. He auditioned for the role of Katsuro via Skype from Los Angeles after the casting director saw him on television and recommended him for the role. The rest of the cast did not meet Kitamura until the day before shooting commenced.|$|E
50|$|True <b>centipedes</b> (class Chilopoda) are venomous, many-legged arthropods, {{and while}} no living species are fully marine, several species inhabit the {{intertidal}} zone (including beaches and rocky shores), and can tolerate occasional inundation by seawater. These <b>centipedes</b> are {{primarily in the}} group Geophilomorpha, commonly known as soil <b>centipedes.</b>|$|R
25|$|Geophilomorph <b>centipedes</b> {{have been}} used to argue for the {{developmental}} constraint of evolution; that the evolvability of a trait, the number of segments in the case of geophilomorph <b>centipedes,</b> was constrained by the mode of development. The geophilomorph <b>centipedes</b> have variable segment numbers within species, yet as with all <b>centipedes,</b> they always have an odd number of pairs of legs. In this taxon, the number of segments ranges from 27 to 191, but is never an even number.|$|R
40|$|Checklist of the Dutch <b>centipedes</b> (Myriapoda: Chilopoda) An updated {{checklist}} for the <b>centipedes</b> of the Netherlands is presented. One species, Lithobius subtilis, is new {{compared with}} the previous checklist. The updated list {{will be used for}} the project ‘The <b>centipedes</b> of the Netherlands’ of the European Invertebrate Survey - Nederland...|$|R
5|$|Although The Human <b>Centipede</b> {{is set in}} Germany, {{principal}} photography {{took place}} in the Netherlands due to the neighboring countries' similar landscapes. Heiter's home, where most of The Human <b>Centipede</b> takes place, was a villa in the Netherlands found by the production team. The property was in a residential area and not surrounded by woodland as it appears in the film, but by other houses. This meant the filmmakers had some difficulty ensuring that the other houses did not appear in shot. Some conversion of the property took place prior to filming, for example, a cinema room was converted to form Heiter's basement operating theatre, with real hospital beds and intravenous drips rented from a local hospital. The paintings of conjoined twins that were displayed throughout the house were painted by Tom Six, which he felt contributed to the atmosphere in the house. The hotel room scene near the beginning of the film was filmed in a hotel suite at a location near Amsterdam. The film was shot almost entirely in sequence, which Yennie stated helped the actors to develop their characters throughout the film. The opening scene, which only featured Laser and de Wit, was shot {{on the last day of}} filming.|$|E
5|$|In {{developmental}} biology, organs {{that developed}} in the embryo {{in the same manner}} and from similar origins, such as from matching primordia in successive segments of the same animal, are serially homologous. Examples include the legs of a <b>centipede,</b> the maxillary palp and labial palp of an insect, and the spinous processes of successive vertebrae in a vertebral column. Male and female reproductive organs are homologous if they develop from the same embryonic tissue, as do the ovaries and testicles of mammals including humans.|$|E
5|$|Laser {{remained}} in character as Heiter throughout the filming process, often shouting {{at the rest}} of the cast on set, but wherever possible staying away from the other actors and crew between scenes to preserve a level of separation. He only ate food he had brought onto the set himself, eating mostly fruit. He contributed dialogue for his character and selected many of his character's outfits from his personal wardrobe. Six claims that the jacket Heiter wore, which was bought by Laser, was a genuine jacket worn by real Nazi doctors. Laser was also happy for the other actors in The Human <b>Centipede</b> to add their own ideas to the film. For example, when Heiter is explaining his procedure to his victims, Katsuro's dialogue was improvised, which pleased Laser. During filming Laser accidentally kicked Kitamura (Katsuro), leading to a fight on set between the actors. The incident contributed to the tension and anger throughout the scene they were filming, in which Heiter sits at his dining table eating while the <b>centipede</b> eats dog food from the floor alongside him. Laser also hurt Williams during the scene when Heiter roughly grabs and injects Lindsay, which caused a pause in shooting before the filmmakers could continue.|$|E
50|$|Scolopendra subspinipes mutilans {{is known}} for {{harbouring}} little aggression to other <b>centipedes,</b> a trait very rare amongst giant <b>centipedes</b> and allows it to be kept communally.|$|R

25|$|The {{fossil record}} of <b>centipedes</b> extends back to , during the Late Silurian. They {{belong to the}} subphylum Myriapoda which {{includes}} Diplopoda, Symphyla, and Pauropoda. The oldest known fossil land animal, Pneumodesmus newmani, is a myriapod. Being among the earliest terrestrial animals, <b>centipedes</b> {{were one of the}} first to fill a fundamental niche as ground level generalist predators in detrital food webs. Today, <b>centipedes</b> are abundant and exist in many harsh habitats.|$|R
5|$|When {{approaching}} investors {{prior to}} filming, Six {{did not mention}} the mouth-to-anus aspect of the plot, fearing it would put off potential backers. The financiers of The Human <b>Centipede</b> did not discover the full nature of the film until it was complete. The film received generally mixed reviews from mainstream film critics, but it won several accolades at international film festivals. The film was released in the United States on a limited theatrical release on 30 April 2010. A sequel, entitled Full Sequence, also written and directed by Six, was released in 2011.|$|E
5|$|K'Nex {{announced}} a toy marketing tie-in for 2014. Respawn announced other marketing tie-ins in late January including apparel, Jinx clothing, Mad Catz peripherals (keyboards, mice, mouse pads, headsets), posters, Prima strategy guides, a Titan Books art book, Turtle Beach Xbox One headsets, USB flash drives. Before release, Electronic Arts and Respawn unveiled a browser game collection of three Atari games (Asteroids, Missile Command, and <b>Centipede)</b> with an added Titanfall theme. Respawn also announced forthcoming Titanfall live action content from {{a partnership with}} Canadian post-production studio Playfight. Figurine manufacturer Threezero announced in March 2014 that they will produce 1/12 to 1/6 scale models of Titanfall Titans and pilots. A worldwide marketing campaign included large statues of Titans across multiple cities, and an advertising campaign that spanned billboards, television commercials, Twitch, the web, and YouTube.|$|E
5|$|The {{first season}} of the American {{television}} series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., {{which is based on}} the Marvel Comics organization S.H.I.E.L.D. (Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division), revolves around the character of Phil Coulson and his team of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, who are assigned to several dangerous cases. The cases are centered on Project <b>Centipede</b> and its leader, The Clairvoyant, while Coulson also searches for answers concerning his mysterious resurrection after dying in The Avengers. It is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), sharing continuity with the films of the franchise, and was produced by ABC Studios, Marvel Television, and Mutant Enemy Productions. Jed Whedon, Maurissa Tancharoen, and Jeffrey Bell served as showrunners.|$|E
25|$|Some {{species of}} <b>centipedes</b> can be {{hazardous}} to humans {{because of their}} bite. Although a bite to an adult human is usually very painful and may cause severe swelling, chills, fever, and weakness, {{it is unlikely to}} be fatal. Bites can be dangerous to small children and those with allergies to bee stings. The venomous bite of larger <b>centipedes</b> can induce anaphylactic shock in such people. Smaller <b>centipedes</b> are generally incapable of piercing human skin.|$|R
50|$|Among myriapods, <b>centipedes</b> have strong, bristly mandibles, {{which have}} a row of teeth in all <b>centipedes</b> except {{for members of the}} order Geophilomorpha. Millipedes have small mandibles, their only {{functioning}} mouthparts, as the maxillae are fused to the lower lip (labium).|$|R
5000|$|... "Prior {{to putting}} the Cap of <b>Centipedes</b> on the head, {{his hair was}} shaved, {{to make it easy}} for the <b>centipedes</b> to suck blood, which in turn made holes in his skull. In spite of that {{punishment}} the noble custodian of Husain's Head felt no pain at all. Salahuddin ordered more <b>centipedes</b> to be put on the nobleman's head, but it could not kill or pain him. Finally, Salahuddin Ayyubi ordered for a tight cap full of <b>centipedes</b> to accomplish the result. Even this method could not torture or kill him. The Ayyubid brutes were greatly astounded further when they saw, on removing the cap, the <b>centipedes</b> were dead. Salahuddin asked the nobleman to reveal the secret of this miracle. The nobleman revealed as follows: When Raas al Imam al Husain was brought to Qasar, Al Moizziyat al Qahera, he had carried the casket on his head. 'O Salahuddin! This is the secret of my safety.'" ...|$|R
5|$|During {{the seventeenth}} century the bonshō was also a symbol of a temple's leadership; {{possession}} of the bell indicated ownership of the associated temple. As a result, bells were often stolen; the folk hero Benkei {{is said to have}} dragged the three-ton bell of Mii-dera temple up Mount Hiei during one such theft. The deep scratches in the Benkei bell, which is still displayed at Mii-dera, are said in the legend {{to be the result of}} Benkei's kicking the bell all the way back to the monastery when he discovered that it would not toll for him. The Benkei bell is also associated with the legendary hero Tawara Tōda, who originally donated it to the Mii-dera temple. He acquired it as a gift from the dragon deity Ryūjin, after saving the god from a giant <b>centipede.</b>|$|E
5|$|Insects {{have been}} used medicinally in {{cultures}} around the world, often according to the Doctrine of Signatures. Thus, the femurs of grasshoppers, which were said to resemble the human liver, were used to treat liver ailments by the indigenous peoples of Mexico. The doctrine was applied in both Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and in Ayurveda. TCM uses arthropods for various purposes; for example, <b>centipede</b> is used to treat tetanus, seizures, and convulsions, while the Chinese Black Mountain Ant, Polyrhachis vicina, {{is used as a}} cure all, especially by the elderly, and extracts have been examined as a possible anti-cancer agent. Ayurveda uses insects such as Termite for conditions such as ulcers, rheumatic diseases, anaemia, and pain. The Jatropha leaf miner's larvae are used boiled to induce lactation, reduce fever, and soothe the gastrointestinal tract. In contrast, the traditional insect medicine of Africa is local and unformalised. The indigenous peoples of Central America used a wide variety of insects medicinally. Mayans used Army ant soldiers as living sutures. The venom of the Red harvester ant was used to cure rheumatism, arthritis, and poliomyelitis via the immune reaction produced by its sting. Boiled silkworm pupae were taken to treat apoplexy, aphasy, bronchitis, pneumonia, convulsions, haemorrhages, and frequent urination.|$|E
25|$|Insects {{and other}} {{invertebrates}} are abundant, including the world's largest <b>centipede,</b> the Amazonian giant <b>centipede,</b> and the Homerus swallowtail, the western hemisphere's largest butterfly.|$|E
50|$|Symphylans, {{also known}} as garden <b>centipedes</b> or pseudocentipedes, are soil-dwelling {{arthropods}} of the class Symphyla in the subphylum Myriapoda. Symphylans resemble <b>centipedes,</b> but are smaller and translucent, and only distantly related to true <b>centipedes.</b> They can move rapidly through the pores between soil particles, and are typically found from the surface down {{to a depth of}} about 50 cm. They consume decaying vegetation, but can do considerable harm in an agricultural setting by consuming seeds, roots, and root hairs in cultivated soil.|$|R
2500|$|Within the myriapods, <b>centipedes</b> are {{believed}} to be the first of the extant classes to branch from the last common ancestor. The five orders of <b>centipedes</b> are: Craterostigmomorpha, Geophilomorpha, Lithobiomorpha, Scolopendromorpha, and Scutigeromorpha. These orders are united into the clade Chilopoda by the following synapomorphies: ...|$|R
2500|$|Worldwide, an {{estimated}} 8,000 species of <b>centipedes</b> {{are thought to}} exist, of which 3,000 have been described. <b>Centipedes</b> have a wide geographical range, where they even reach beyond the Arctic Circle. They are found {{in an array of}} terrestrial habitats from tropical rainforests to deserts. Within these habitats, <b>centipedes</b> require a moist microhabitat because they lack the waxy cuticle of insects and arachnids, therefore causing them to rapidly lose water. Accordingly, they are found in soil and leaf litter, under stones and dead wood, and inside logs. <b>Centipedes</b> are among the largest terrestrial invertebrate predators, and often contribute significantly to the invertebrate predatory biomass in terrestrial ecosystems. [...] Only one species, Scolopendra cataracta, is known to be amphibious and is believed to hunt aquatic or amphibious invertebrates.|$|R
