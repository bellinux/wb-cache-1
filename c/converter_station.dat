Gradually, the power line turns to the southeast, as it crosses under several 735kV power lines.|$|E

The electric tram system ran on 600Volts DC supplied at first from two converter stations, No.1 <b>converter</b> <b>station</b> on East Terrace with 2,500kW of AC to DC capacity and No.2 station at Thebarton with a capacity of 900kW. To cope with variable loads on the system, very large storage lead–acid batteries were installed, the initial one at East Terrace comprising 293 cells and a 50ton tank of sulphuric acid.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a {{new method}} of observing {{the status of}} other distant <b>converter</b> <b>stations</b> {{from each of the}} <b>converter</b> <b>stations</b> is presented. The {{patterns}} of select voltage and current waveforms available at other <b>converter</b> <b>stations</b> have been used to characterise system status at other <b>converter</b> <b>stations.</b> Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been used to associate the different patterns with the corresponding systems technique. This method can be extended to serve as a tool for decentralised control of MTDC (multi terminal DC) systems, thereby reducing the need for fast telecommunications...|$|R

50|$|This HVDC line {{is not in}} use for a long time.

25|$|The great {{distance}} between generating {{sites on the}} Nelson River and load centers in southern Manitoba required the use of HVDC transmission lines to bring the energy to market.

25|$|An HVDC {{converter}} converts {{electric power}} from high voltage alternating current (AC) to high-voltage direct current (HVDC), or vice versa. HVDC {{is used as}} an alternative to AC for transmitting electrical energy over long distances or between AC power systems of different frequencies. HVDC converters capable of converting up to two gigawatts (GW) and with voltage ratings of up to 900 kilovolts (kV) have been built, and even higher ratings are technically feasible. A complete <b>converter</b> <b>station</b> may contain several such converters in series and/or parallel.|$|E

25|$|This {{interchange}} {{is a broad}} {{complex of}} overpasses and bridges that was nearly complete {{at the time of}} the earthquake and not all portions were open to traffic. Several instances of failure or collapse at the site took place and two men were killed while driving in a pickup truck as a result. The westbound I-210 to southbound I-5, which was complete except for paving at the ramp section, collapsed to the north, likely because of vibration that moved the overpass off its supports due to an inadequate seat. Unlike the situation at the Antelope Valley Interchange, permanent ground movement (defined as several inches of left-lateral displacement with possibly an element of thrusting) was observed in the area. The movement contributed to heavy damage at the Sylmar Juvenile Hall facility, Sylmar <b>Converter</b> <b>Station,</b> and the Metropolitan Water District Treatment Plant, but its effects on the interchange was not completely understood as of a 1971 report from the California Institute of Technology.|$|E
2500|$|The {{thyristor}} valve {{was first}} used in HVDC systems in 1972 on the Eel River <b>Converter</b> <b>Station</b> in Canada. The thyristor is a solid-state semiconductor device similar to the diode, but with an extra control terminal {{that is used to}} switch the device on at a defined instant. Because thyristors have breakdown voltages of only a few kilovolts each, HVDC thyristor valves are built using large numbers of thyristors connected in series. Additional passive components such as grading capacitors and resistors need to be connected in parallel with each thyristor {{in order to ensure that}} the voltage across the valve is shared uniformly between the thyristors. [...] The thyristor plus its grading circuits and other auxiliary equipment is known as a thyristor level.|$|E
2500|$|The {{simplest}} (and also, the highest-amplitude) waveform {{that can}} be produced by a two-level converter is a square wave; however this would produce unacceptable levels of harmonic distortion, so some form of Pulse-width modulation (PWM) is always used to improve the harmonic distortion of the converter. As {{a result of the}} PWM, the IGBTs are switched on and off many times (typically 20) in each mains cycle. This results in high switching losses in the IGBTs and reduces the overall transmission efficiency. [...] Several different PWM strategies are possible for HVDC but in all cases the efficiency of the two-level converter is significantly poorer than that of a LCC because of the higher switching losses. A typical LCC HVDC <b>converter</b> <b>station</b> has power losses of around 0.7% at full load (per end, excluding the HVDC line or cable) while with 2-level voltage-source converters the equivalent figure is 2-3% per end.|$|E

2500|$|As {{fuel economy}} became a bigger {{priority}} among Americans following the Arab Oil Embargo of late 1973 and early 1974, Chevy made the smaller [...] small block V8 with two-barrel carburetor standard on all Caprice models except wagons for 1975. In California, the four-barrel [...] 350 V8 was the base engine and this engine was unavailable elsewhere. Optional engines included the [...] small block V8 (standard on wagons) and [...] big block, the last {{was not available}} in California.

2500|$|Differential ground {{motion and}} strong shaking (MMI VIII (Severe)) was {{responsible}} for serious damage to the Sylmar Juvenile Hall facility and the Sylmar <b>Converter</b> <b>Station</b> (both located close to the Upper Van Norman lake). The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, {{as well as the}} County of Los Angeles, investigated and verified that local soil conditions contributed to the ground displacement and resulting destruction. The area of surface breaks on the ground at the site was [...] (at its widest) and stretched [...] down a 1% grade slope towards the southwest. As much as [...] of lateral motion was observed on either end of the slide, and trenches that were excavated during the examination at the site revealed that some of the cracks were up to [...] deep. The two facilities, located near Grapevine and Weldon canyons that channel water and debris off the Sierra Madre Mountains, are lined by steep ridges and have formed alluvial fans at their mouths. The narrow band of ground disturbances were found to have been the result of settling of the soft soil in a downhill motion. Soil liquefaction played a role within confined areas of the slide, but it was not responsible for all the motion at the site, and tectonic slip of faults in the area was also excluded as a cause.|$|E

30|$|Regarding {{short-circuit}} power, {{the design}} of the power converter of type IV wind turbines limits the maximum short-circuit current output to 1.1 – 1.2 per-unit [12].
