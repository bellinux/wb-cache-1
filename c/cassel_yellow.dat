5000|$|Historically, {{the primary}} use of lead oxychlorides {{was in a}} mixture with other lead {{compounds}} (e.g. lead carbonate [...] "white lead") as a pigment in lead paints. The lead compounds were first fused, and the product then ground to fine powder. The powder was then suspended in drying oils (e.g. linseed), to produce e.g. Pattinson's white (PbCl2 2Pb(OH)2) or Turner's yellow (PbCl2 5-7PbO). Turner's yellow {{is also known as}} Patent yellow, <b>Cassel</b> <b>yellow,</b> Montpelier yellow, Kassler yellow, mineral yellow, and Verona yellow.|$|E
