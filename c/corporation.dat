40|$|Japanese <b>corporations</b> and American and European <b>corporations</b> take {{different}} approaches {{when it comes}} to business in China in general : (i) American <b>corporations</b> are concentrated in the music, motion picture, and software industries, so they have a particular interest in solving copyright infringement problems; (ii) American and European <b>corporations</b> have started to actively use China as a base for research and development; and (iii) many American <b>corporations</b> have clear China-specific technological strategies. The systems for managing intellectual property in China also differ among Japanese <b>corporations</b> and American and European <b>corporations</b> : (i) whether American and European <b>corporations</b> have an IP department depends on the individual <b>corporations</b> overall management policies; (ii) locally hired employees managing intellectual property in American and European <b>corporations</b> are usually the ones entrusted with important IP-related duties; (iii) there are many requirements for employment and the remuneration is high for locally hired employees managing intellectual property in American and European corporations; and (iv) relatively few Japanese <b>corporations</b> attribute intellectual property rights to their subsidiaries in China. Various aspects also differentiate Japanese <b>corporations</b> and American and European <b>corporations</b> in terms of the measures they take to combat counterfeit products : (i) American and European <b>corporations</b> show a similar trend as Japanese <b>corporations</b> toward taking administrative enforcement measures or civil proceedings, but a trend toward using criminal proceedings is emerging among American and European corporations; (ii) in American and European <b>corporations,</b> internal employees often prepare warning letters, conduct research, and collect evidence; (iii) the budget of American and European <b>corporations</b> for measures to combat counterfeit products is far greater than that of Japanese corporations; (iv) American and European <b>corporations</b> are active in exchanging information with and collecting information from governments; and (v) American <b>corporations</b> emphasize using estimated amounts of damages and quantifying the effectiveness of their measures to combat counterfeit products. Two key points stand out as being essential when considering measures to combat leakages of technology and infringements of trade secrets : (A) that good personnel management is effective as a measure for combating the leakage of technology and the infringement of trade secrets; and (B) that good information management is essential for preventing technology leakages and trade secret infringements. Many differences are evident between Japanese <b>corporations</b> and American and European <b>corporations</b> with respect to these measures : (i) American and European <b>corporations</b> are more active than Japanese <b>corporations</b> in willfully transferring technology to China; (ii) Japanese <b>corporations</b> are considerably less popular in China than American and European corporations; (iii) American and European <b>corporations</b> are more progressive in terms of assigning managerial powers to Chinese management personnel; (iv) the level of compensation offered at Japanese <b>corporations</b> in China is considerably lower than that offered at American and European <b>corporations</b> in China; (v) American and European <b>corporations</b> in China engage in corporate PR in many different ways, but Japanese <b>corporations</b> in China do not do enough; (vi) American and European <b>corporations</b> employ various initiatives to increase the motivation of Chinese personnel; and (vii) Regulations at American and European <b>corporations</b> provide severe punishment for personnel who divulge secrets. Japanese <b>corporations</b> and American and European <b>corporations</b> take {{different approaches}} {{when it comes to}} strategies for intellectual property and preventing technology leakage in China. But it is important that Japan adopts the good aspects of the methods used by American and European <b>corporations</b> {{at the same time as}} it continues to collaborate and cooperate with international institutions, governments, and anti-counterfeiting organizations. ...|$|R

Instead, Ohio chose to admit these <b>corporations</b> to conduct business in Ohio, a privilege that these <b>corporations</b> paid taxes to secure and maintain.
