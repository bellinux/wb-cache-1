5000|$|The {{introduction}} &hellip; {{of so-called}} high-assurance or extended validation (EV) certificates that allow CAs to charge more for them than standard ones, {{is simply a}} case of rounding up twice the usual number of suspects—presumably somebody’s going to be impressed by it, but the effect on phishing is minimal since it is not fixing any problem that the phishers are exploiting. Indeed, cynics would {{say that this was}} exactly the problem that certificates and CAs were supposed to solve in the first place, and that “high-assurance” certificates are just a way of charging a second time for an existing service. A few years ago certificates still cost several hundred dollars, but now that the shifting baseline of certificate prices and quality has moved {{to the point where they}} can be obtained for $9.95 (or even for nothing at all) the big commercial CAs have had to reinvent themselves by defining a new standard and convincing the market to go back to the prices paid in the good old days.This deja-vu-all-over-again approach can be seen by examining Verisign’s certificate practice statement (CPS), the document that governs its certificate issuance. The security requirements in the EV-certificate 2008 CPS are (except for minor differences in the legalese used to express them) practically identical to the requirements for Class 3 certificates listed in Verisign’s version 1.0 CPS from 1996. EV certificates simply roll back the clock to the approach that had already failed the first time it was tried in 1996, resetting the shifting baseline and charging 1996 prices as a side-effect. There have even been proposals for a kind of sliding-window approach to <b>certificate</b> <b>value</b> in which, as the inevitable race to the bottom cheapens the effective value of established classes of certificates, they’re regarded as less and less effective by the software that uses them&hellip; ...|$|E

40|$|With an {{automatic}} photoplate-evaluation system in Spark-Source Mass Spectrometry, complete photoplate information {{is used for}} the concentration-procedure, that means, all isotopes of single and multiple-chargedions contribute to the analytical result. Experiments show that the ion-intensities of elements in their ionization states lie on parabolas. The parabola-position of impurity-elements within a matrix is mainly influenced by that matrix and shows a characteristic relation to the analytical result. Systematic investigations lead to a significant parameter, the so-called "mean charge number" Zi, which forms a common link between the very different parabola-positions of all elements within a matrix. This knowledge is the basis for a new evaluation procedure which, without using a calibration standard,leads to an essential improvement of the analytical result. Experiments in practical analysis work show that this method, used on many different matrices, show a maximum deviation from the <b>certificate</b> <b>value</b> by a factor of 2 (in many cases < 1. 5). Analyzing the main components in alloys yields accuracies between 10 and 20 %. For the standard-deviation of analysis results an upper limit of 10 % was reached.

In the UK, the existing building stock is replaced {{at a rate of}} less than 2 % a year; thus, many of today’s buildings will still be in use in 2060. Retrofitting aged buildings can significantly reduce their energy use. This paper analyses the selection process and success factors in retrofit façade decision-making. Literature relating to building retrofit and façade selection is reviewed. A case study is conducted on a five-storey 1970 s UK commercial office building, retrofitted in 2011. Data is collected via in-depth interviews with key project decision-makers, a documentary evidence review, and thermography of the completed retrofitted façade. The façade evolution is mapped according to seven identified project stages and the RIBA Plan of Work 2007. The retrofit satisfied the client’s aesthetic needs, while delivering an 85 % reduction in the ’wall’ U-value and a ’B’ rated Energy Performance <b>Certificate.</b> <b>Value</b> engineering (VE) greatly influenced the façade selection, with less expensive alternatives replacing original elements of the façade design. The façade’s thermal success is linked to the VE focusing on façade elements covering only a small extent of the building. Façade success factors key to attracting tenants (lower running costs and aesthetics) may apply to commercial buildings in general. Thermography aided in assessing the retrofitted thermal envelope, but to act as a tool to aid retrofit façade selection, it should ideally involve a ’before’ and ’after’ survey...|$|E

All the analyses were calibrated using aqueous standards. Slurries were injected into an electrothermal atomiser. The effects of furnace programme, background correction and air ashing were investigated. As, Se, Cd and Sb were successfully determined in a variety of certified reference material coals. For As the coal was slurried in nickel nitrate, magnesium nitrate, nitric acid and ethanol. Continuiun source and Smith-Hiefije background correction were compared for correction of a broadened Al line interference at the As (193. 7 nm) line. Only the latter was effective. Smaller Se signals were obtained from coal compared to aqueous solutions. Iron coal produced structured background and hence overcorrection. The successful method introduced air into the ash stage. Both DCP and ICP techniques yielded good agreement with <b>certificate</b> <b>values</b> provided that the particle size was reduced to below 16 um and 10 um respectively. Simplex optimisation identified the critical parameters for aluminium determinations as being high injector flow rate and low observation height. Preliminary investigations of slurry atomisation using ICP-MS and 0. 2 % m/v slurried coal gave no blocking. Contamination from zirconia grinding elements used to comminute coal was investigated using laser ablation ICP-MS. Excitation temperature (Texc), ionisation temperature (Tion) rotational temperature (Trot) and electron number density (ng), were measured for different slurry concentrations (1 - 30 % m/v) in the ICP. Depending on themometric species used, Texc may decrease with slurry concentration, but there were no similar decreases in Tion, T(rot) and ng. Observed decreases in analyte emission with increased sample loadings (> 10 %) were shown to be caused by transport effects. National Coal Board Coal House Lyon Road HARROW Middlese...|$|R
40|$|The {{cadmium content}} in surface water is {{regulated}} by the last European Water Framework Directive to a maximum between 0. 08 and 0. 25 μg L - 1 depending on the water type and hardness. Direct measurement of cadmium at this low level is not straightforward in real samples, and we hereby propose a validated method capable of addressing cadmium content below μg L- 1 level in natural water. It is based on solid-phase extraction using TiO 2 nanoparticles as solid sorbent (0. 05 g packed in mini-columns) to allow the separation and preconcentration of cadmium from the sample, combined to direct isotope dilution and detection by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ID-ICP-MS). The extraction setup is miniaturised and semi-automated to reduce risks of sample contamination and improve reproducibility. Procedural blanks for the whole measurement process were 5. 3 ± 2. 8 ng kg- 1 (1 s) for 50 g of ultrapure water preconcentrated ten times. Experimental conditions influencing the separation (including loading pH, sample flow rates, and acid concentration in the eluent) were evaluated. With isotope dilution the Cd recovery rate {{does not have to}} be evaluated carefully. Moreover, the mathematical model associated to IDMS is known, and provides transparency for the uncertainty propagation. Our validation protocol was in agreement with guidelines of the ISO/IEC 17025 standard (chapter 5. 4. 5). Firstly, we assessed the experimental factors influencing the final result. Secondly, we compared the isotope ratios measured after our separation procedure to the reference values obtained with a different protocol for the digested test material IMEP- 111 (mineral feed). Thirdly, we analysed the certified reference material BCR- 609 (groundwater). Finally, combined uncertainties associated to our results were estimated according to ISO-GUM guidelines (typically, 3 - 4 % k = 2 for a cadmium content of around 100 ng kg - 1). We applied the developed method to the groundwater and wastewater samples ERM-CA 615 and BCR- 713, respectively, and results agreed with <b>certificate</b> <b>values</b> within uncertainty statements.
