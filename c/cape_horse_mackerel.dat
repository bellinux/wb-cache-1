5000|$|<b>Cape</b> <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> is a bycatch {{species in}} the {{offshore}} demersal trawl, which operates mainly off {{the waters of the}} Western Cape at depths of 110m and deeper. The offshore demersal trawl fishery operates using trawl nets which are dragged behind the boat along the ocean floor at depths from 110 - 800 m. <b>Cape</b> <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> caught in the midwater trawl fishery are considered to be more sustainable than those caught in the offshore trawl fishery (see <b>Cape</b> <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> assessment for midwater trawl). This fishery primarily targets deepwater hake (Merluccius paradoxus) on soft, sandy bottoms, as well as commercially valuable bycatch species such as kingklip (Genypterus capensis) and monkfish (Lophius vomerinus). Although trawling is a highly unselective fishing method, offshore fishing grounds are not generally very biodiverse (i.e. they are only inhabited by a few species) and the discard rate for this fishery is estimated to be 10% of the total catch. However, this fishing method is likely to have significant impacts on bottom habitats and concerns are expressed around the number of seabird mortalities caused during trawling (estimated at 8000 per year). The hake component of the offshore demersal trawl fishery has been certified by the Marine Stewardship Council since 2004, and the current management system for this fishery employs a number of ecosystem-based management measures which address issues such as bycatch, closed areas and benthic habitat impacts. The <b>Cape</b> <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> is managed in terms of a maximum precautionary catch Limit (MPCL). The MPCL has been maintained at 44 000 tonnes in recent years and accommodates both mid-water-directed and bycatch in the hake-directed demersal trawl sector. Juvenile horse mackerel are occasionally targeted on the West Coast where a 5 000 tonnes precautionary catch limit is enforced (the whole small pelagic sector is closed if the limit is exceeded). Despite the absence of direct evidence of ecosystem change, a potential for ecosystem impact exists, as this is an important small pelagic species, and fills a similar ecosystem niche to other small pelagic species such as sardine and anchovy.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Cape</b> <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> (Trachurus capensis) is a pelagic species, {{usually found}} {{to a depth}} of 300 m. They are mostly found over the {{continental}} shelf, often over sandy bottoms. The shoals rise to feed in surface waters at night, but can be found close to the bottom during the day. Horse mackerel are very abundant in South African and Namibian waters, though much of the catch is exported. Their stock status is uncertain, but expert opinion is that the stock is most likely underfished.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. The <b>Cape</b> <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> (Trachurus trachurus capensis) has {{traditionally}} made {{an important contribution}} to the South African fishing industry and is a key component of the Benguela ecosystem. This thesis concerns the assessment and management of the South African horse mackerel resource. It starts with a brief review of the biology of the <b>Cape</b> <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> and the history of the fishery, {{as well as of the}} Management Strategy Evaluation approach, which was applied in this work. Assessments of the horse mackerel resource are currently undertaken through the combined efforts of the Demersal and Pelagic Scientific Working Groups (SWGs) of the South African Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF). A joint effort is required because the resource is available to multiple fisheries: as directed catch to the midwater trawl fishery and as bycatch to the demersal trawl and pelagic purse-seine fisheries. Management of the resources complicated by differences in the age-structures of the horse mackerel caught in each of these three fisheries. The data available for the assessments are described, including the details of their collection and processing. Four age-structured production models (each reflecting different assumptions about the horse mackerel resource) are fitted to those data using the maximum-likelihood estimation method, and are used to provide assessments. Estimates of the current status of the stock indicate that it is healthy, putting it well above its Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) level. For the directed midwater fishery, MSY is estimated to be in the region of 50 000 - 100 000 tonnes per annum. However, the results of constant catch projections suggest that there is a pronounced yield-per-recruit effect, with even small bycatches of juvenile horse mackerel in the pelagic fishery having a pronounced negative effect on the level of a catches in the midwater fishery that can be sustained...|$|E
40|$|Predator–prey {{interactions}} of mammals and their fish prey in marine ecosystems are rarely identified and recorded. We document {{for the first}} time the underwater behaviour of hunting dusky dolphins Lagenorhynchus obscurus and the responses of their prey, <b>Cape</b> <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> Trachurus capensis, observed in open ocean waters off northern Namibia. Predator–prey interactions were monitored acoustically during a continuous period of 2 h with a split-beam scientific echo sounder, and the surface behaviour of the dolphins was observed from the ship’s deck. In total 54 predator–prey events were observed (mean, 0. 45 events min– 1). The maximum burst speed during attack was 9. 9 m s– 1, while the average attack speed was 3. 4 m s– 1 (mean swimming speed: 1. 4 m s– 1). Dolphin traces were predominantly located underneath the fish aggregation (63 % of the time), as the dolphins attacked the schools from underneath (mean depth: 120 m; maximum depth: 156 m). The dolphin target strength at 38 kHz was, on average, – 31. 5 dB (95 % CI: – 33. 4 to – 30. 2 dB). The attacks caused immediate reactions in the <b>Cape</b> <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> aggregations: subschools were forced towards the surface where they were herded into dense aggregations by the dolphins. Observed predator response patterns included ‘Vacuole’ (n = 21), ‘Split’ (n = 19), ‘Bend’ (n = 10) and ‘Hourglass’ (n = 4). Packing densities changed significantly before (0. 4 fish m– 3), during (2. 0 fish m– 3) and after (0. 3 fish m– 3) the dolphin attacks, and when predators burst into the fish aggregations, mean (±SD) intraschool packing densities of horse mackerel were significantly lower in front of the predators (0. 33 ± 0. 17 fish m– 3) than behind (6. 65 ± 1. 76 fish m– 3) ...|$|E

40|$|The goal of <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> stock {{discrimination}} was tackled {{by integrating}} both established and innovative approaches such as genetic markers (allozymes, mtDNA, microsatellite DNA and SSCP), morphometry and parasites, tagging experiments and life history traits (growth, reproduction and distribution), within the EU-funded HOMSIR project. The sampling covered almost the whole distribution range of <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> through 20 sampling localities. 200 fish per sampling site were collected {{taking in consideration}} the spawning season and temporal variation (two years of sampling). The results from genetic approaches (Multilocus Allozyme Electrophoresis, mtDNA and microsatellite DNA) showed {{that there was only}} slight genetic differentiation among sampling sites. Another genetic technique (SSCP), was successful in finding a genetic marker that demonstrated substructuring in <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> populations. Several approaches (SSCP, morphometrics, parasites) support the separation between the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea in <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> populations, although the most western Mediterranean area could also be connected with the Atlantic populations. In the Northeast Atlantic, various stocks can be distinguished: The west Atlantic coast of the Iberian Peninsula (southern stock); the west coasts of European countries from northern Spain to Norway (western stock) and the North Sea stock. This information implies the revision of the boundaries of the so-called southern and western stocks as currently defined. Various results suggested that adult <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> could migrate through different areas/or stocks in the Northeast Atlantic. <b>Horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> from the Mauritanian coast is distinguished by its high production parameters (growth and batch fecundity). The population of <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> in the Mediterranean Sea is substructured roughly in at least three main areas: western, central and eastern Mediterranean.

40|$|The <b>Cape</b> <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> Trachurus trachurus capensisis one of Namibia's most {{valuable}} fish stocks, {{and an important}} component to the diet of Cape fur seals, Arctocephalus pusillus pusillus, off northern Namibia. The level of overlap in the utilization of this resource between seals and the purse-seine fishery was investigated using two overlap indices. For high overlap measures, seals and the purse-seine fishery utilized age- 2 horse mackerel. For low overlap measures, seals mainly consumed age- 0 fish whereas the fishery caught age- 2 fish. Both indices were adjusted by the proportion of horse mackerel in the seal diet, {{with the assumption that}} the proportion consumed by the seals reflects the abundance of horse mackerel in the coastal waters of Cape Cross, Namibia. Both unadjusted and adjusted overlap indices showed that overlap between seals and the fishery in their utilization of juvenile horse mackerel was high only at times when horse mackerel abundance was high, and low when abundance was small. Confidence intervals and significance testing were included. Overall, there was little overlap between seals and the purse-seine fishery. This study provides important information that should be taken into account in the management of the horse mackerel resource...|$|E
40|$|A {{survey of}} parasites infecting <b>Cape</b> <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel,</b> Trachurus capensis Castelnau, 1861, {{from both the}} {{southern}} and northern Benguela ecosystems was conducted {{to test the hypothesis}} of discrete stocks in each subsystem. One hundred and twenty five T. capensis of two size classes were collected off the coasts of South Africa and Namibia and their bodies and organs were examined for parasitic infections. Differences in parasite assemblages between smaller and larger T. capensis within each subsystem, between T. capensis of each size class from the two subsystems, and between larger fish collected in different seasons within the southern Benguela, were assessed. A total of twenty-nine parasite species were found infecting T. capensis. Ten of these were identified to species level (Ceratomyxa australis, Davisia donecae, Ectenurus lepidus, Gastrocotyle trachuri, Goussia cruciata, Lernanthropus trachuri, Nybelinia lingualis, Rhadinorhynchus cadenati, Scolex pleronectis and Tergestia laticollis), three to genus level (Anisakis sp., Caligus sp. and Kudoa sp.). Significant spatial differences in T. capensis parasites were observed, with larger fish differing in infection intensity and abundance of Anisakis sp. and infection intensity of L. trachuri. Significant spatial variation in parasites was also observed in smaller fish, which differed in Anisakis sp. abundance, L. trachuri infection intensity and abundance, G. trachuri abundance and G. cruciata infection intensity and abundance. Significant fish size effects on T. capensis parasites were also observed in both subsystems. Anisakis sp. infection intensity and abundance and G. cruciata abundance differed significantly between larger and smaller fish from the southern Benguela. Larger and smaller fish from the northern Benguela differed in G. cruciata infection intensity and abundance, G. trachuri abundance and L. trachuri abundance. No seasonal differences in parasites of larger T. capensis from the southern Benguela were observed. By using a discriminant function analysis parasite abundance data correctly assigned 92 % of larger fish and 96 % of smaller fish to their respective southern and northern Benguela sub-populations or stocks. These results show that analyses of parasites can be used to infer population structure and support the hypothesis of distinct T. capensis stocks in the northern and southern Benguela subsystems...|$|E

40|$|Thirty-two {{specimens}} of the sixgill sawshark, Pliotrema warreni, were trawled near Bird Island in Algoa Bay on the Eastern coast of South Africa in April and May 2015. The specimens were examined for anatomical proportions, reproductive characteristics, diet, and parasite assemblages. Several external measurements were collected including mass, total length, standard length, girth, rostrum length, interoccular to pre-caudal length, first dorsal origin to second dorsal origin, first dorsal origin to pre-caudal origin, and mouth width. The equation for mass (g) vs. total length (mm) was ln(Mass) = 0. 2997 *ln(TL) + 2. 0383 for females and ln(Mass) = 0. 3321 *ln(TL) + 1. 941 for males. 1 st Dorsal to 2 nd dorsal origin length (DD) to total length equations for {{females and males}} were DD= 0. 2451 *TL- 26. 677 and DD= 0. 2598 *TL- 34. 535, respectively. Mean lengths and masses were 11. 5 % greater and 50. 3 % heavier in females than males, respectively. Females were on average, 994 mm (759 mm – 1283 mm) in length while males were 891. 8 mm (763 mm – 1015 mm). Average mass for females was 1702. 5 g (602. 5 g – 3478. 5 g) whereas males it was 1132. 6 g (687 g – 1593. 5 g). Based on these data both sexes display isometric growth. Males were determined to reach sexually maturity around 850 mm {{which is similar to}} that reported by Ebert et al., (2013) around 830 mm. Females were found to reach sexual maturity at 1000 mm which is 100 mm smaller than what is reported by Ebert et al., (2013). Stomach mass increased with total mass and total length regardless of sex (female R² = 0. 507; male R² = 0. 213 for length and female R² = 0. 6123; male R² = 0996 for mass). Females consumed larger prey items in terms of mass and length as well as a higher quantity of prey than males presumably because they are the larger sex and have an increased need for nourishment to provide for pregnancy. Prey items were redeye round herring, Etrumeus whiteheadi (64. 96 % of the diet), a benthic shrimp species not identified (7. 69 %), and <b>Cape</b> <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel,</b> Trachurus trachurus capensis (0. 85 %). Despite strict adherence to the guidelines for age determination for elasmobranchs provided in the literature, the conventional method used which involved extensive cleaning of the vertebral centra with an array of chemicals, setting and cutting in an epoxy resin, and staining for microscopy, did not yield readable results which could be used to determine the ages of these sharks. The highest abundance of parasites were found in the stomachs. Three {{specimens of}} a cymothoid isopod was found externally. Two specimens of Ascaris sp. nematode were found in the visceral cavity. The remaining 18 parasites consisted of three Neoechinorhynchidae sp. of acanthocephalan and 15 Proleptus obtusus nematodes all of which were found inside the stomachs. Given the results of the parasite survey, males and females {{do not have the same}} parasites as females have four different species while males only have one. More collections from other areas and times of year are necessary to obtain a better description of the species...|$|E
40|$|Three {{stocks of}} the <b>Cape</b> <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel,</b> Trachurus trachurus capensis, have been {{recognised}} in the ICSEAF convention region off southern Africa (Figure 1) {{on the basis of}} catch distribution and biological analyses. They were identified as being off Namibia (ICSEAF Divisions 1. 3 and 1. 4), off the West Coast of South Africa (Div. 1. 6) and off the South Coast (Div. 2. 1 and 2. 2). Recently, speculation as to the accuracy of the classification of the South African populations has arisen. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the number of stocks In Divisions 1. 6, 2. 1 and 2. 2, using methodology which assessed the spatial and temporal nature and the phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of the species. The distribution of horse mackerel was evaluated by studying the trends in catch data and length frequency distributions obtained from the demersal industry during 1986 to 1988 and from the demersal biomass cruises in 1987 and 1988. Adult fish, found in Div. 2. 1 and 2. 2, probably migrated; during the months in which horse mackerel were expected to spawn, CPUE values were higher over the central Agulhas Bank than in the east of the study region. During the quiescent period, catches and numbers were higher in the latter region. Juvenile horse mackerel were found in the nursery areas utilised by pelagic fish and it is likely that they were transported northward from the Agulhas Bank. A decrease in biomass of individuals in Div. 1. 5 indicated a separation between a northern and a southern population. Analyses of the phenotype, or epigenetic characters, of horse mackerel were used as a further test of stock integrity. Monthly samples were drawn from Div. 1. 6, 2. 1 and 2. 2 during May 1988 to June, 1989. Comparisons for the values obtained from growth, length-at- 50 %-maturity and the season of otolith ring formation from each region showed no significant variation in the phenotype. Morphometric analysis proved inconclusive. Monthly gonadosomatic indices show that fish south of the Orange River share the same spawning season. Reports from the literature show that horse mackerel in the latter region differ from those of northern Namibia in spawning season, age-at- 50 %-maturity and season of otolith ring formation. The genetic structure of the populations of horse mackerel was evaluated by means of a restriction enzyme analysis of the Mitochondrial DNA of 37 fish collected from Divisions 1. 4, 1. 5, 1. 6, 2. 1 and 2. 2. Two composite genotypes of horse mackerel were found; one belonging to fish in Div. 1. 4 and one to fish in Div. 1. 6, 2. 1 and 2. 2. The genetic distance between the two genotypes, 0. 07, was the expected distance between two populations at a subspecies level. Fish in Div. 1. 5 consisted of both genotypes and may be a region of mixing between the two populations. The interpretation of results was cautioned; prevlous work has shown that the migration of a small number of individuals between two stocks can be expected to maintain a low variation between the populations. In concluding, it was recommended that the horse mackerel be managed as two stocks, one in Div. 1. 3 and 1. 4 and one in Div. 1. 6, 2. 1 and 2. ...|$|E

The consumption of the larger specimens could lead to an increase in mercury exposure for consumers. Estimated weekly intakes, calculated on the basis of concentrations relative to each size class, revealed a high exposure associated with the consumption of fish larger than 30 cm (<b>horse</b> <b>mackerel,</b> 11. 63 to 20. 16 microg/kg of body weight; Mediterranean <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel,</b> 5. 86 to 13. 55 microg/kg of body weight). An understanding of the factors leading to an increase in mercury exposure can help consumers make informed decisions about eating fish...|$|R
