5|$|As {{early as}} 16 April, the German command {{realised}} that the British were evacuating troops on ships at Volos and Piraeus. The campaign then {{took on the}} <b>character</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pursuit. For the Germans, it was now primarily a question of maintaining contact with the retreating British forces and foiling their evacuation plans. German infantry divisions were withdrawn due to their limited mobility. The 2nd and 5th Panzer Divisions, the 1st SS Motorised Infantry Regiment and both mountain divisions launched a pursuit of the Allied forces.|$|E

5|$|Going {{against the}} normal {{convention}} that the strongest characters {{should be the}} largest in terms of physical size, he designed many of Dragon Balls most powerful characters, including Goku, with small statures. Toriyama explained that he had Goku grow up so that drawing fight scenes would be easier, even though Torishima was against it initially because it was rare to have the main <b>character</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> manga series change drastically. Torishima later referred to this as his own biggest crisis during the series, with Toriyama threatening to end it if Goku could not grow up. The editor said his concerns were unfounded, as readers accepted the change without complaint.|$|E

5|$|Historic {{districts are}} {{generally}} {{two types of}} properties, contributing and non-contributing. Broadly defined, a contributing property is any property, structure or object which adds to the historical integrity or architectural qualities that make a historic district, listed locally or federally, significant.

5|$|On April 5, 622, Heraclius left Constantinople, entrusting {{the city}} to Sergius and general Bonus as regents of his son. He {{assembled}} his forces in Asia Minor, probably in Bithynia, and, after he revived their broken morale, he launched a new counter-offensive, which took on the <b>character</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> holy war; an acheiropoietos image of Christ was carried as a military standard.|$|E
5|$|On stage, Harlequin Munchausen, or the Fountain of Love, a {{pantomime}} {{based on}} the Raspe text, was produced in London in 1818, and Herbert Eulenberg made the Baron the main <b>character</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> 1900 play, Münchhausen. The Expressionist writer Walter Hasenclever turned the stories into a comedy, Münchhausen, in 1934. Grigori Gorin used the Baron as the hero of his 1976 play That Very Munchausen; a film version was made in 1980. Baron Prášil, a Czech musical about the Baron, opened in 2010 in Prague. The following year, the National Black Light Theatre of Prague toured the United Kingdom with a nonmusical production of The Adventures of Baron Munchausen.|$|E
40|$|A {{short and}} simple {{derivation}} of the formula of Frobenius, {{which gives the}} dimensions of the irreducible representations of Sn, the symmetric group on any number, n, of symbols, is given. These dimensions are the <b>characters</b> <b>of</b> the identity element of the group, i. e., of the element all of whose cycles are unary. It is shown how <b>a</b> slight modification <b>of</b> Frobenius' formula yields, when n = 2 p is even, the <b>characters</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> element <b>of</b> Sn all of whose cycles are binary and, when n = 3 p is <b>a</b> multiple <b>of</b> 3, the <b>characters</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> element <b>of</b> Sn all of whose cycles are ternary and, generally, when n = kp is <b>a</b> multiple <b>of</b> any positive integer k, the <b>characters</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> element <b>of</b> Sn all of whose cycles are of length k. It is noteworthy that the calculations become simpler, rather than more complicated, as k increases. Finally, this paper shows how to derive from Frobenius' formula the <b>characters</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> element <b>of</b> Sn which has at least one unary cycle and, from the present modifications of Frobenius' formula, the <b>characters</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> element <b>of</b> Sn which has at least one cycle of length k, k = 2, 3, [...] ., n...|$|R

5|$|Smetana's early {{songs are}} {{settings}} of German poems for single voice. Apart from his 1848 Song of Freedom, {{he did not}} begin to write pieces for a full choir until after his Gothenburg sojourn, when he composed numerous works for the Hlahol choral society, mostly for unaccompanied male voices. Smetana's choral music is generally nationalistic in character, ranging in scale from the short Ceremonial Chorus written {{after the death of}} the composer's revolutionary friend Havlíček, to the setting of Song of the Sea, a substantial work with the <b>character</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> choral drama.|$|E

5|$|Cedar Lane Cinema {{had been}} the township's lone movie theater, and had also hosted live {{performances}} on its stage by local performance groups, until it closed its doors in November 2012, with theater operator Majestic Entertainment citing costs that could run {{to as much as}} $500,000 to modernize the projection systems on all four screens to use digital technology rather than 35mm reels of film. New owner Matthew Latten signed a lease in April 2013 and undertook extensive renovations that included new seating, modern digital projection systems and digital signage. After hosting the Teaneck International Film Festival in November, the reopening of the renamed Teaneck Cineams was delayed until December 2013, with added time needed to complete the work needed to add modern features and conveniences while retaining the Art Deco <b>character</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> theater first constructed in 1937.|$|E

5|$|Even {{among other}} festive music written by Bach, this work's scoring for four {{trumpets}} is unusual. It is characterised {{by a very}} solemn character and the attributes of courtly homage music, such as the opening chorus {{in the form of}} a French overture or fanfare-like trumpet interjections in the bass recitative. Bach created a work that in musical terms corresponds less to sacred music and more to the type of secular music for a princely court, as had been required of him during his time in office in Köthen. Only in its final two movements does Bach again use simple forms to emphasize the work's <b>character</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> church cantata, implying that earthly powers do not last, but God – the supreme ruler – is entitled to have the last word.|$|E
5|$|First {{movement}} in moderate or fast tempo, and in sonata form. The exposition {{consists of two}} or three thematic and tonal areas and, as common in the Classical style, moves from tonic to dominant (in major mode works) or to the relative major (in minor mode works). However, as often with Schubert, the harmonic scheme of the exposition involves additional, intermediate tonalities, which may be quite remote from the tonic-dominant axis, and sometimes imbue certain expository passages with the <b>character</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> development section. The main themes of the exposition are often in ternary form, with their middle section digressing to a different tonality. The themes generally do not form symmetrical periods, and irregular phrase lengths are prominent. The exposition ends with a repeat sign. The development section opens with an abrupt turn into a new tonal area. A new theme, based on a melodic fragment from the second thematic group of the exposition, is presented in this section over recurrent rhythmic figuration, and then developed, undergoing successive transformations. The first thematic group returns in the recapitulation with different or additional harmonic digressions; the second group returns unaltered, only transposed a fourth up. The short coda maintains the tonic key and mainly soft dynamics, achieving a resolution of the movement's conflicts and ending pianissimo.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{accession}} of Heraclius, the Sassanid advance pushed {{deep into}} the Levant, occupying Damascus and Jerusalem and removing the True Cross to Ctesiphon. The counter-attack launched by Heraclius took on the <b>character</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> holy war, and an acheiropoietos image of Christ was carried as a military standard (similarly, when Constantinople was saved from a combined Avar–Sassanid–Slavic siege in 626, the victory was attributed to the icons of the Virgin that were led in procession by Patriarch Sergius about {{the walls of the}} city). In this very siege of Constantinople of the year 626, amidst the climactic Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628, the combined Avar, Sassanid, and Slavic forces unsuccessfully besieged the Byzantine capital between June and July. After this, the Sassanid army was forced to withdraw to Anatolia. The loss came just after news had reached them of yet another Byzantine victory, where Heraclius's brother Theodore scored well against the Persian general Shahin. Following this, Heraclius led an invasion into Sassanid Mesopotamia once again.|$|E
