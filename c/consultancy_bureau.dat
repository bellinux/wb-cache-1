40|$|In the {{backdrop}} of depopulation and the participation society, citizen initiatives in rural areas are expected to contribute to community liveability by maintaining various types of facilities in the area. Studies on which factors influence {{the success or failure}} of citizen initiatives have thus far neglected to conceptualize what actually is regarded as successful or unsuccessful, although it is relevant to have a clear expectation of what citizen initiatives can achieve, and when and in which sense they can be called successful (or not). Is a financially independent citizen initiative more successful than an initiative that represents the wishes of an entire community? Or can a citizen initiative only be successful if it achieves the goals that were initially set? This study aims to conceptualize determinants of success and failure of rural citizen initiatives from the perspective of professionals in the field of depopulating rural areas. Three focus group discussions were conducted with in total 23 experts from local governments, housing corporations or <b>consultancy</b> <b>bureaus</b> in the North of the Netherlands. The resulting conceptualization will add to future research in studying factors influencing success or failure of citizen initiatives. Furthermore, it may improve evaluations of the achievements of the citizen initiatives and classifications of various types of initiatives...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{relationships}} between regulatory focus, job crafting, work engagement and perceived employability. In addition, it was expected that career competencies would moderate relationships between job crafting, work engagement and perceived employability. Data were gathered using an online survey on social media and among candidates of a <b>consultancy</b> <b>bureau</b> in the life sciences (N = 441). As hypothesized, promotion focus was positively related to crafting structural resources and challenges and social resources. Crafting hindering demands was negatively related to promotion focus and positively related to prevention focus. Furthermore, crafting resources and challenging demands were positively related to work engagement and perceived employability. Moderation effects of career competencies were found for perceived employability, but not for work engagement. The findings suggest that job crafting could be beneficial and has implications for management practice and future research...|$|E

40|$|SOMO is a centre for {{research}} on multinational corporations. In 1973 SOMO was founded to provide different organisations with knowledge on the structure and organisation of Transnational Corporations (TNCs) by conducting independent research. In the Seventies the conduct of Transnational Corporations gave cause for intense international discussions. TNCs were accused of using their power in a negative way. There {{was a lot of}} debate about the growth of the economic and political power of TNCs as being the main carriers of Foreign Direct Investment. The concerns included the abuse of dominant market positions, a lack of commitment to the host economy, disrespect for labour rights and interference in national politics. At that time it appeared there was little basic knowledge on the structure and organization of TNCs. SOMO is an independent research and <b>consultancy</b> <b>bureau.</b> Whether a TNCs investment strategy is involved, the environmental policy of an entire sector, or a major reorganisation at a local branch, SOMO can provide a clear analysis and a critical assessment of the relevant factors.

40|$|A {{considerable}} portion in {{the construction}} industry of Sri Lanka is covered by the government sector and organizational structure of most of them is different and they use different strategies for performing projects. There is no unique organizational structure for all the organizations in the government sector {{in the construction}} industry. Most of organizations in government sector follow a centralized management system and decentralized system not much significant. Central Engineering <b>Consultancy</b> <b>Bureau</b> (CECB) as a government organization bare a large portion of construction and consultancy works {{in the construction industry}} of Sri Lanka at present and it is a grate example for practicing decentralized management system to perform project undertaken by it. It has separate eighteen sub divisions under Additional General Managers and this separate sub divisions function independently with sub organizations structures using delegations of authority. Deputy General Managers, project managers and other technical staff members directly working under Additional General Managers. Five AGM divisions of CECB out of eighteen were selected for the case study done under this research and three persons namely AGM, DGM and PM were interviewed from each division according to a semi-structured interview. Content analysis and cognitive mapping techniques were used for data analysis in this research. Cross-case analysis includes a comprehensive comparison between the selected cases and with the extant literature. It was observed that there are three most significant features affect to superiors in delegation of authority Viz.; saving time and energy, releasing of operational working load, opportunity for real top management functions and five most significant features affect to subordinate 'in delegation of authority Viz.; autonomy, decision making, responsibility, participation, and motivation and satisfaction and six most significant factors leading to effective delegation of authority Viz.; goals and roles, authority, communication, control mechanisms, trust and understanding, and rewarding and training...|$|E
40|$|The European Map of Job Flows (EMJF) is a {{term used}} to denote a dataset of meso- and macro-level {{variables}} describing different aspect of labour mobility within national labour markets in Europe. In this paper, EMJF is centred {{on the notion of}} job “flows”, namely the changes in the level of employment at different breakdowns and levels of aggregation. EMJF is very rich in information content due to the wide variety of possible breakdown of the data and in this sense it is a “map” mostly in the virtual sense, namely, that {{it is not possible to}} visualise in the form of geographic maps all the wealth of available information. In terms of its value as a research product and tool, EMJF is mostly an intermediate product in the sense that it is a convenient means to organise the relevant information, which could subsequently be used for different analytical and research purposes. It provides both for cross-sections/snapshots of job flows at different point in time but also it allows their assessment and analysis over longer periods of time. In this sense, EMJF can be widely used for various types of labour-market analysis and research. EMJF’s visual components can also be a convenient tool for policy makers dealing with labour market policies at different level (regional, national or supra-national) in the decision-making process. Here we present a Compilation of a EMJF on the basis of firm-level data In this sense the job flows are built up on the basis of firm-level data for individual countries, following a common methodology. We adopt an approach of establishing such a EMJF on the basis of the AMADEUS dataset developed by the <b>consultancy</b> <b>Bureau</b> van Dijk. The dataset in its most extended version contains balance sheet data and ownership data for almost 14 million firms from 43 different European countries (September 2009 update). For many EU countries the dataset has in principle access to the entire universe of firms which have to report a balance sheet. In terms of countries, the geographic coverage of AMADEUS encompasses information for all the 27 members of the European Union (albeit with different qualities in terms of national coverage) as well as other 16 European countries that complete the geographical and political definition of the continent. Another interesting feature of the database is given by the detailed definition of a firm's location, with data available on the region (NUTS 2) and the city in which the firm operates. This project deliverable presents the main results from the final stage of MICRO-DYN work on the EMJF. It discusses the approach to building the EMJF on the basis of AMADEUS data and illustrates the analytical potential of the EMJF as a research tool with a range of Europe-wide analytical exercises. Probably the most important outcome of this research effort is the demonstrated capability to perform meta-analysis at the European level of important labour market characteristics on the basis of firm-level data. ...|$|E
40|$|Investigations of the {{development}} of hydro power in the upper Walawe river basin using the head difference of about 350 m between the two pineplaines of the south eastern part of the central high lands of Sri Lanka had commenced in mid 1950 's. Several studies have been conducted since then on the possible ways of developing this potential. These studies lead to the finalization of Samanalawewa hydro power project in 1985. The scheme envisaged {{the development}} of the potential in two stages. Under the stage I major components such as main dam, low pressure tunnel,surge chamber,a single penstock add power plant of 120 MW capacity housing two generating units were to be developed. Work under stage I was completed and plant was commissioned in 1992. Stage II of the scheme envisaged the construction of Diyawini Oya reservoir, a second penstock and an extension to the stage I power house to install two additional generating units to bring the total installed capacity of Samanalawewa hydro power project to 240 MW. According to the studies the installation of additional 120 MW capacity in the second stage of the project was aimed at providing the needs of additional peaking capacity in the CEB generating system at a future date. The studies conducted in 1985 expected such requirement to be in the CEB system in early 21 st century. After completion of the wet blanketing of the reservoir to arrest the leakage which developed on the right abutment of the dam Ceylon Electricity Board wished to evaluate the feasibility {{of the development}} of stage II of the scheme {{in the early years of}} 21 " century as envisaged ill 1985. In 1999, CEB requested Central Engineering <b>Consultancy</b> <b>Bureau</b> to review the feasibility of implementing the stage II of Samanalawewa hydro power project. During this review the capacity of the existing system to cater for the conditions after the installation of additional units the feasibility of construction of Diyawini Oya reservoir and the installed capacity to be developed in the near future were evaluated. Most of components of the existing project are found to have sufficient capacity to cater for the increased flows after stage II. Some modifications are required in the surge chamber in order to connect the Intake from the Diyawini oya reservoir. A provision has already been made available for this purpose in the surge chamber. Review of the feasibility {{of the development of}} Diyawini reservoir by CECB indicated that the water tightness of the reservoir is uncertain in the light of the latest geological information available. It was also noted that any treatment of reservoir to improve the water tightness will be prohibitively costly. Accordingly CEB apparently had given up the proceeding of stage II studies. However it was interesting to investigate the possibility of using Diyawini Oya waters diverted in the direction of the surge chamber and released in to the surge chamber at a feasible point. This way additional water quantity from the stream can be pumped in to the surge chamber and it is added to generate electricity at the power station. It is very important to check the electrical energy loss when pumping such a quantity of water and then compared with the energy gain at the end. All relevant calculations were done and it indicates that the project is well profitable and impacts on Environmental and social aspects are in favor of the project...|$|E
