We can speak to America and the world because we speak in names of a whole nation.” In this 1960 speech, Castro also criticized many Latin American liberal democracies, describing them as a “Pretense of democracy”, as, he claimed, they did not allow such gatherings.|$|E

Bono offered for the group to perform a benefit concert or small show in Sarajevo, but the city requested they hold the full PopMart show.

[...] After the completion of the PopMart Tour, he said, [...] "it was amazing and confounding to discover that on our most 'pop' of tours some of the best shows were in political hotspots like Santiago, Sarajevo, Tel Aviv [...] anywhere music meant more than entertainment".
