5|$|A close {{binary star}} system occurs when two stars orbit {{each other with}} an average {{separation}} that is of the same order of magnitude as their diameters. At these distances, more complex interactions can occur, such as tidal effects, transfer of mass and even collisions.

5|$|In {{addition}} to making secretory proteins, the rough ER makes membranes that grows in place from {{the addition of}} proteins and phospholipids. As polypeptides intended to be membrane proteins grow from the ribosomes, they are inserted into the ER membrane itself and are kept there by their hydrophobic portions. The rough ER also produces its own membrane phospholipids; enzymes built into the ER membrane assemble phospholipids.

5|$|Since its inaugural school year, Union City High School {{has offered}} college-level courses to students, and through its {{partnerships}} with nearby colleges and universities, {{increased the number}} of such courses for the 2010–2011 school year, enabling students to accumulate up to 12 - 15 college credits by graduation that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>transferred</b> to New Jersey public colleges. In addition to Liberal Arts courses, students can take advanced placement biology, chemistry, physics, anatomy & physiology, forensic science, robotics, geometry, algebra 2, and calculus at the AEA. Students preparing for civil engineering and architecture careers can take pre-engineering, computer networking and computer aided design (CAD) at the AEA.

5|$|Special {{abilities}} and actions {{are controlled by}} the Force Gauge, an energy meter which determines how long special skills can be active. Once drained, the skill cannot be activated until the meter refills, which it does during battles. Four skills can be equipped for each character. After battles, characters earn Enhancement Points (EP), {{which can be used}} to strengthen equipped armor, weapons and accessories, instead of using Gald (the in-game currency) as with previous Tales titles. EP <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>transferred</b> between weapons. An optional battle arena was added in the PSP version of the game with both single-player and multiplayer matches: in both modes, players need to defeat an enemy team (either AI-controlled enemies or an opposing team) within a time limit.|$|E

It reflects {{the development of the}} dramatization of Andersen's fairy-tale, which was changing all the time during the rehearsals with actors, and the development of practising the performance as well. An analysis aims to answer the questions: What <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>transfered</b> from a prosaic text into a dramatic one? What <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>transfered</b> from a dramatic text onto the stage? The thesis intends to evaluate the created dramatic text and the form of the performance and explain the reasons for a success or a failure...|$|R

5|$|Their genome {{is usually}} a {{circular}} bacterial chromosome – a single loop of DNA, although they can also harbor small pieces of DNA called plasmids. These plasmids <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>transferred</b> between cells through bacterial conjugation. Bacteria have an enclosing cell wall, which provides strength and rigidity to their cells. They reproduce by binary fission or sometimes by budding, but do not undergo meiotic sexual reproduction. However, many bacterial species can transfer DNA between individual cells by a horizontal gene transfer process referred to as natural transformation. Some species form extraordinarily resilient spores, but for bacteria this is a mechanism for survival, not reproduction. Under optimal conditions bacteria can grow extremely rapidly and can double as quickly as every 20 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Amongst the Hispanic {{pioneers in}} the Coast Guard were the Andreu family of Florida; Joseph Ximenez, the first Hispanic-American to command a Coast Guard vessel; and Detlef Frederick Argentine de Otte, the first Hispanic to {{graduate}} from Revenue Cutter Service School of Instruction. The Coast Guard <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>transferred</b> to the Department of the Navy by the President or Congress during time of war. During World War I, Hispanics served in the United States Revenue Cutter Service and U.S. Life-Saving Service; and during World War II, Hispanics served aboard ships guarding {{the shores of the}} United States and the Atlantic Ocean against enemy submarines. However some men, such as Jose R. Zaragoza, served on missions on lonely atolls. Hispanics have served in every major conflict, and continue to do so. Coast guard service is not limited to armed conflicts with other nations; the Coast Guard also plays a vital role in the apprehension of illegal immigrants and drug smugglers.|$|E

5|$|As {{only one}} of the {{electrons}} <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>transferred</b> from the QH2 donor to a cytochrome c acceptor at a time, the reaction mechanism of complex III is more elaborate than those of the other respiratory complexes, and occurs in two steps called the Q cycle. In the first step, the enzyme binds three substrates, first, QH2, which is then oxidized, with one electron being passed to the second substrate, cytochrome c. The two protons released from QH2 pass into the intermembrane space. The third substrate is Q, which accepts the second electron from the QH2 and is reduced to Q.−, which is the ubisemiquinone free radical. The first two substrates are released, but this ubisemiquinone intermediate remains bound. In the second step, a second molecule of QH2 is bound and again passes its first electron to a cytochrome c acceptor. The second electron is passed to the bound ubisemiquinone, reducing it to QH2 as it gains two protons from the mitochondrial matrix. This QH2 is then released from the enzyme.|$|E
5|$|In plant cells, vacuoles cover {{anywhere}} from 30% to 90% {{of the total}} cell volume. Most mature plant cells contain one large central vacuole encompassed by a membrane called the tonoplast. Vacuoles of plant cells act as storage compartments for the nutrients and waste of a cell. The solution that these molecules are stored in is called the cell sap. Pigments that color the cell are sometime located in the cell sap. Vacuoles can also {{increase the size of}} the cell, which elongates as water is added, and they control the turgor pressure (the osmotic pressure that keeps the cell wall from caving in). Like lysosomes of animal cells, vacuoles have an acidic pH and contain hydrolytic enzymes. The pH of vacuoles enables them to perform homeostatic procedures in the cell. For example, when the pH in the cells environment drops, the H+ ions surging into the cytosol <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>transferred</b> to a vacuole {{in order to keep the}} cytosol's pH constant.|$|E
5|$|In 1914, the {{schooner}} Isaiah K. Stetsen sank off {{the coast}} of Massachusetts during a storm. Mess Attendant First Class Arthur J. Flores and Seaman John E. Gomez, assigned to USRC Acushnet, volunteered to save survivors of the schooner and were awarded the Silver Lifesaving Medal for their heroism. That same year, USRC Algonquin, which was stationed in the Caribbean, set sail with fifteen Hispanic-Americans (a fourth of the cutter's complement) to San Juan, Puerto Rico to assist the Puerto Ricans battling fires that threatened to destroy parts of that city. In 1915, the City of San Juan, Puerto Rico, paid tribute to the crew of the cutter Algonquin and presented them with an Official Resolution of Thanks. The Coast Guard was already formed by September 1918, with the merger of United States Revenue Cutter Service and United States Life-Saving Service, when Seaman Richard E. Cordova became the first Hispanic Coast Guardsman to perish in a military conflict when his cutter, the USCGC Tampa, was torpedoed and sunk with all its crew by a German U-Boat during World War I. The Coast Guard <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>transferred</b> to the Department of the Navy by the President or Congress during time of war. Boatswains Mate First Class Pablo Valent and Surfman Indalecio Lopez, members of the Texas Brazos Life-Saving Station crew were awarded the Coast Guard Silver Lifesaving Medal and The Grand Cross Medal from the American Cross of Honor Society for their assistance in the rescue of the crew of the schooner Cape Horn on September 16, 1919. In 1935, Chief Boatswains Mate Pablo Valent was given command of the Port Isabel (Texas) Boat Station, becoming the first Hispanic-American to do so.|$|E
