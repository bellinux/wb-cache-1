40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis study examines the potential {{impacts of the}} DoD emphasizing the use of parametric <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> <b>methods</b> or techniques in the acquisition process. As one of many initiatives to improve the DoD acquisition process through use of commercial practices, parametric <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> {{has the potential to}} be helpful in many applications for which it had never before been considered. This study, conducted through a questionnaire, personal interviews and a review of recently released publications from the DoD Joint Government/ Industry Initiative, identifies areas of interest for those anticipating using parametric <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> <b>methods</b> and techniques. These areas include the Program Definition & Risk Reduction and Engineering & Manufacturing Development phases of program management as well as for many pre-award contract actions. The data from this thesis show that the majority of the personnel in the DoD acquisition community believe that parametric <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> <b>methods</b> can be used effectively in those areas. The data also show that the methods also may have applications in the Production, Fielding/Deployment & Operational Support phase of program management and post-award contract actions such as negotiating changes, forward pricing rate agreements, or analyzing claims[URL] Commander, United States Nav...|$|R

Although the method is theoretically sound, many assumptions are involved in each of its estimation steps, and uncertainty exists in each step. The control <b>cost</b> <b>estimate</b> <b>method</b> <b>estimates</b> the marginal emission control cost, which represents the opportunity cost offset by emission reductions from some given control measures. Studies conducted to estimate emission values in US regions used either the damage <b>estimate</b> <b>method</b> or the control <b>cost</b> <b>estimate</b> <b>method.</b> Taking emission values estimated for some US air basins, this paper establishes regression relationships between emission values and total population and air pollutant concentrations.

40|$|Purpose: The main aim of {{research}} was to elaborate <b>methods</b> to <b>estimate</b> <b>costs</b> in construction series of types production process. Design/methodology/approach: Based on manufacturing cost of one element {{it is possible to}} determine cost of other elements belonged to the same construction series of types. The four main <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> <b>methods</b> were distinguished. The first method is feature-based. The technological operations are dedicated to specified pieces of element. Cost manufacturing of every piece is specified. Based on elementary costs the manufacturing cost of whole part is calculated. The second method uses construction similarity theory. The selected part manufacturing costs are functionally depended on main part manufacturing costs. The CAM method is based on time calculation from manufacturing process simulation. The simplified method uses normalized masses of analyzed parts pieces. The balance coefficients of those pieces are specified. Findings: Manufacturing cost estimation methods were analyzed. Those methods are based on construction and manufacturing technology. The main conclusion is that CAM method is most accurate. Research limitations/implications: The CAM method is limited to analyze only manufacturing process based on numerically controlled machines. The Feature-based method require developed database for analyzed part family. Practical implications: Presented method was applied in hydraulic props manufacturing cost analysis.

40|$|NASA is {{responsible}} for developing much of the nation's future space technology. <b>Cost</b> <b>estimates</b> for new programs are required early in the planning process so that decisions can be made accurately. Because of the long lead times required to develop space hardware, the <b>cost</b> <b>estimates</b> are frequently required 10 to 15 years before the program delivers hardware. The system design in conceptual phases of a program is usually only vaguely defined and the technology used is so often state-of-the-art or beyond. These factors combine to make <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> for conceptual programs very challenging.

40|$|The {{results are}} {{documented}} {{of an investigation}} into current <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> practices of contractors for construction projects. A questionnaire survey of contractors was undertaken, in which the respondents are classified into four groups based on their turnover namely: very small, small, medium and large firms. The survey indicates that contractors, irrespective of size, continue to undertake <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> predominantly for construction planning purposes, including the preparation of tenders and cost control of projects during the execution stage and, to a lesser extent, for construction project evaluation. Recent developments in <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> <b>methods</b> and tools that consider risks and variability in <b>cost</b> <b>estimates,</b> {{such as the use of}} range estimating and parametric estimating techniques, have not been adopted by contractors. The practice of <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> does not differ from conventional techniques based on the use of labour and material constants to obtain prices for bills of quantities items on an item by item basis. The study shows that the major causes of inaccuracy in <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> continue to be the lack of practical knowledge of the construction process by those responsible for the estimating function, insufficient time to prepare <b>cost</b> <b>estimates,</b> poor tender documentation and the wide variability of subcontractors' prices. <b>Cost</b> <b>Estimate,</b> Tendering, Performance Appraisal, Estimating Techniques, Analysis Of Variance,...|$|R

In the development of such a new product, {{there is often a}} lack of historical knowledge and data available to be used to perform cost estimation accurately. This {{is due to the fact}} that traditional cost estimation methods are used to predict costs only after a product model has been built, and not at an early design stage when there is little data and information available. In light of this, original equipment manufacturers are also facing critical challenges of becoming globally competitive and increasing demands from customer for continuous innovation. To alleviate these situations this research has identified a new approach to cost modelling with the inclusion of product lifecycle management solutions to address innovative product development.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis provides {{the background and}} motivation for furthering the Fully Burdened Cost of Fuel (FBCF) <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> methodology and calculations {{in the context of}} a naval aviation fixed wing platform. The FBCF contribution to Total Ownership Cost in the Analysis of Alternatives for Major Defense Acquisition Programs requires steady advancement to meet an October 2011 implementation deadline. Applying OSD guidance and calculator mathematical process facilitates comparison of the additional costs to deliver and protect fuel demanded by the F/A- 18 E/F aircraft with those added costs for a ship platform. Total costs throughout a realistic operation and support life cycle and applying a notional scenario to the newest calculator demonstrate a range of <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> <b>methods.</b> Our conclusions support previous analysis that air refueling contributes significantly to logistics support costs and that investment in fuel conservation technologies and platform endurance can be a strategic opportunity for the Department of Defense and the Department of the Navy.

40|$|Preliminary <b>cost</b> <b>estimates</b> {{rely on the}} {{conceptual}} design {{of the project and}} use only basic design technologies. Although they present the lowest expected accuracy, they are often used by key people involved in the construction process, thus playing a significant role. Bridge construction has increased over the last years, often exhibiting substantial overruns above <b>estimated</b> <b>costs.</b> To overcome this problem, it is crucial for the decision makers to have an early estimate of the final cost based on previous experience. This paper addresses the need for easy-to-use and reliable <b>cost</b> <b>estimates</b> during the early stages of projects for bridge superstructures, presenting a major impact on the total bridge construction cost. It proposes a conceptual <b>cost</b> <b>estimate</b> <b>method</b> that involves the estimation of both the material quantities and the relevant costs. It describes the development of prediction models for the material quantities of concrete and reinforcing and prestressing steel for three major bridge deck construction methods using regression analysis, while a bootstrap resampling method is used to produce estimate ranges. The material estimating models rely on the development of a database after collecting actual data from a large sample of modern bridges. The major assumptions underlying the correct application of the regression methodology were tested, and necessary adjustments were made.

40|$|For future giant telescopes, {{control of}} {{construction}} and operation {{costs will be}} the key factor in their success. The best way to accomplish this cost control, while maximizing {{the performance of the}} telescope, will be through design-to-cost methods that use value engineering techniques to develop the most cost-effective design in terms of performance per dollar. This will require quantifiable measures of performance and cost, including: (1) a way of quantifying science value with scientific merit functions; (2) a way of predicting telescope performance in the presence of real-world disturbances by means of integrated modeling; and (3) a way of predicting the cost of multiple design configurations. Design-to-cost methods should be applied as early as possible in the project, since the majority of the life-cycle costs for the observatory will be locked in by choices made during the conceptual design phase. However, there is a dilemma: how can <b>costs</b> be accurately <b>estimated</b> for systems that have not yet been designed?

40|$|Estimating {{design and}} {{construction}} costs in a consistent, reliable, and accurate way is critical for an organization since the information generated is the basis for: projecting program funds, prioritizing projects by financial analysis, determining required funds, and providing a baseline for project control. This thesis focused on <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> <b>methods,</b> database, and prototype tool development for {{design and construction}} of rural and small urban transit facilities that are usually small, numerous, and geographically dispersed. To address these issues, the National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) funded a research team to provide guidance to state transit agencies in assisting their sub-recipients with preparing accurate design and construction <b>cost</b> <b>estimates.</b> This thesis was written according to {{the scope of the}} funded research project. The main objectives of this study were to determine the distinct characteristics of rural and small urban transit facilities and to develop a cost database and a prototype tool to assist agencies with preparing conceptual estimates. Conducting a literature review and telephone interviews with experts in the transit facility industry improved the understanding of the estimating practices used in the rural and small urban transit facility industry. Unique characteristics and risk factors of those facilities were identified. A <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> database was constructed based on the historical cost data collected through online surveys. A <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> prototype tool was developed based on the findings obtained from the literature review, telephone interviews, and analysis of the <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> database. Review of the prototype tool was then performed to ensure the tool?s self-explanation, functionality, and user-friendliness. This thesis contributes to the transit facility industry by developing the first national database and prototype tool to support conceptual estimating for rural and small urban transit facilities.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this Oversight Procedure is to {{describe}} the review, analysis and recommendation procedures and reporting requirements expected by Federal Transit Administration (FTA) from the Project Management Oversight Contractor (PMOC) with regard to the: • Soundness of the Grantee’s <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> <b>methods</b> and processes compared with proven professional quantity surveying and <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> practices for projects of this scale; • Congruence of the project <b>cost</b> <b>estimate</b> with the project scope and schedule, i. e. do these three elements fully reflect each other; • Reliability of the estimate for procurements, contract bids, and contract closeout, i. e. will the project budget prove to be adequate at these milestone events. 2. 0 BACKGROUND Congress and FTA’s good stewardship require that a Grantee’s <b>cost</b> <b>estimates</b> be reliable. Before entry to preliminary engineering and final design, {{as well as other}} points in project development, a thorough evaluation of the scope, schedule and cost is performed to confirm the estimate’s reliability. 3. 0 OBJECTIVES FTA’s objective is to assess the consistency of <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> information, understand its characteristics, and confirm that the estimate adequately reflects the overall project scope, the estimated quantities shown on the design documents, the anticipated market conditions, and the project schedule. The first time this review is performed, usually prior to entry of the project into preliminary engineering, a cost or cost range is established as a base from which future estimates are measured. Later, when contract packages are conceived, the PMOC will evaluate the estimates in the packages. This review may be performed prior to issuance of documents for bid, or during construction. The review results should help the Grantee with decisions regarding the level of cost control measures and mitigations required; in addition, the results will assist FTA with decisions regarding project advancement and funding...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a neural network-based <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> <b>method,</b> {{developed for the}} generation of conceptual <b>cost</b> <b>estimates</b> for low-rise prefabricated structural steel buildings. Detailed <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> is current practice {{for this type of}} buildings, since cost estimators are often challenged by a wide variety of different parameters. The developed method employs neural networks (NNs) for modeling individual project parameters associated with the direct cost of a project. It integrates NN cost models with cost adjustments, allowing for evaluation of different project alternatives, in a timely manner. The ability of NNs to capture real life experiences encountered on actual projects (i. e. actual costs), generalize and utilize that knowledge for <b>estimating</b> the <b>cost</b> of new projects makes it a very powerful tool to the application at hand. Data used in this study (75 building projects) were collected from a large manufacturer of prefabricated structural steel buildings in Canada (Canam Manac) over a 3 -month period. The performance of developed cost models was tested against costs incurred by projects not used in training of those models, and costs predicted by regression. Results indicate that the proposed models, when used for projects with parameters within the range for which the models were trained, outperform regression. In addition, the proposed models can account for a number of parameters defining a project, and bearing considerable impact on the project cost. The proposed methodology can easily be adapted to provide decision-support for risk management and to assist in developing productivity models {{in a wide range of}} industries...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The level of achieved accuracy in design <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> is generally accepted by researchers as being less than desirable. Low accuracy {{has been attributed to}} the nature of historical <b>cost</b> data, <b>estimating</b> <b>method</b> and the expertise of the estimator. Previous researchers have suggested that the adoption of resource based estimating by designers could eliminate data and method-related problems. The work in this thesis has shown that this will not solve the problem of inaccuracy in estimating. A major problem in assessing accuracy in design <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> has been the absence of a generally agreed definition of the'true cost' of a construction project. Hitherto, studies of accuracy in design <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> have relied solely on the assessment of errors using the low bid as a datum. Design cost estimators do not always focus on predicting the low bid. Rather, they may focus on the lowest, second lowest, third lowest or any other bid, mean/median of bids, or sometimes, on just being'within the collection'. This has resulted in designers and researchers having different views on the level of achieved accuracy in estimating. To resolve this problem, an analysis package, ACCEST (ACCuracy in ESTimating), was developed to facilitate 'fair' assessment of accuracy in design <b>cost</b> <b>estimates.</b> Tests - using cost data from 7 offices, the ACCEST package and the OPEN ACCESS II package on an IBM PS/ 2 - have shown that error in design <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> (averaging 3. 6...|$|R
40|$|Most {{parametric}} software {{cost estimation}} models used today {{evolved in the}} late 70 's and early 80 's. At that time, the dominant software development techniques being used were the early 'structured methods'. Since then, several new systems development paradigms and methods have emerged, one being Jackson Systems Development (JSD). As current <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> <b>methods</b> do not take account of these developments, their non-universality means they cannot provide adequate estimates of effort and hence cost. In order to address these shortcomings two new estimation methods {{have been developed for}} JSD projects. One of these methods JSD-FPA, is a top-down <b>estimating</b> <b>method,</b> based on the existing MKII function point method. The other method, JSD-COCOMO, is a sizing technique which sizes a project, in terms of lines of code, from the process structure diagrams and thus provides an input to the traditional COCOMO method. The JSD-FPA method allows JSD projects in both the real-time and scientific application areas to be costed, as well as the commercial information systems applications to which FPA is usually applied. The method is based upon a three-dimensional view of a system specification as opposed to the largely data-oriented view traditionally used by FPA. The method uses counts of various attributes of a JSD specification to develop a metric which provides an indication {{of the size of the}} system to be developed. This size metric is then transformed into an estimate of effort by calculating past project productivity and utilising this figure to predict the effort and hence cost of a future project. The effort estimates produced were validated by comparing them against the effort figures for six actual projects. The JSD-COCOMO method uses counts of the levels in a process structure chart as the input to an empirically derived model which transforms them into an estimate of delivered source code instructions...|$|R
40|$|Research {{involving}} carbon {{management has}} received increased attention {{over the last}} decades, due to {{the threat posed by}} global warming and increases in the atmospheric Green House Gas (GHG) emission. Improving energy efficiency, use of renewable energy and carbon dioxide(CO 2) capture and storage are among the proposed method for carbon management in the industrial sectors. Previous researchers have used carbon emission pinch analysis (CEPA) techniques to plans for carbon emission in the industry. But the cost effectiveness of the techniques has not been verified. This research is aimed at developing a graphical cost-screening technique for the CO 2 emission reduction planning in an industrial site. This method employs the carbon management hierarchy (CMH) as a tool to guide CO 2 emission reduction planning. It also extends the Systematic Hierarchical Approach for Resilient Process Screening (SHARPS) graphical cost-screening technique that was developed for water system to guide and screen design options involving process changes in order to obtain a cost effective system that meets a given CO 2 emission targets. Application of the SHARPS screening techniques has successfully achievedthe final cost effective minimum CO 2 emission target for a stationary site with TPPset (Total payback period set by designer) of 2 years, targeting 29. 12 tons/hr of fresh CO 2 and 16. 74 tons/hr of CO 2 emission prior to design. Using the predesign <b>cost</b> <b>estimate</b> <b>method,</b> the system needs approximately a net capital investment of USD 556. 21 million,to give a net annual savings of USD 333. 7 million with a total payback period of approximately 18 months...|$|R
40|$|Additive Manufacture (AM) {{is a novel}} {{manufacturing}} method; it is {{a process}} of forming components by adding materials. Owing to material saving and manufacturing cost saving, more and more research has been focused on metal AM technologies. WAAM is one AM technology, using arc as the heat sources and wire as the material to create parts with weld beads on a layer-by-layer basis. The process can produce components {{in a wide range of}} materials, including aluminum, titanium and steel. High deposition rate, material saving and elimination of tooling cost are critical characteristics of the process. Cost estimation is important for all companies. The estimated results can be used as a datum to create a quote for customers or evaluate a quote from suppliers, an important consideration for the application of WAAM is its cost effectiveness compared with traditional manufacture methods. The aim of this research is to find a way to develop a <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> <b>method</b> capable of providing manufacturing cost comparison of WAAM with CNC. A cost estimation model for CNC machining has been developed. A process planning approach for WAAM was also defined as part of this research. An Excel calculation spreadsheet was also built and it can be easily used to estimate and compare manufacture cost of WAAM with CNC. Using the method developed in this research, the cost driver analysis of WAAM has been made. The result shows that reduced material cost is the biggest cost driver in WAAM. The cost comparison of WAAM and CNC also has been made and the results show that with the increase of buy-to-fly ratio WAAM is more economical than CNC machining...|$|R

The state custom rate guides provide some indication of machines costs based on what is being charged (Wisconsin Custom Rate Guide, 2004). The guides do not take into account your specific conditions, which may be quite different for you. Data in the guide may be impacted by the supply and demand of custom operators in a geographical area. Available machine cost tables provide an estimate based assumed input data such as machine list price, recommended acreage, fuel price, and labor. These tables often do not use of information specific to your operation. A frequently used table is the Minnesota Machine <b>Cost</b> <b>Estimates</b> published annually (Lazarus and Selley, 2005). They obtained list prices from machinery dealer surveys and used American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineer...|$|R
40|$|Process {{flow sheets}} were {{developed}} for the thermal treatment of southern pine wood chips at four temperatures (150, 180, 230, and 270 degrees C) and two different scales (20 and 100 ton/hour). The larger capacity processes had as their primary heat source hot gas assumed to be available in quantity from an adjacent biorefinery. Mass and energy balances for these flow sheets were developed using Aspen Plus process simulation software. The hot gas demands in the larger processes, up to 1. 9 million lb/hour, were of questionable feasibility because of the volume to be moved. This heat was of low utility because the torrefaction process, especially at higher temperatures, is a net heat producer if the organic byproduct gases are burned. A thermal treatment flow sheet using wood chips dried in the biorefinery to 10 % moisture content (rather than 30 % for green chips) with transfer of high temperature steam from the thermal treatment depot to the biorefinery was also examined. The equipment size information from all of these cases was used in several different equipment <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> <b>methods</b> to <b>estimate</b> the major equipment costs for each process. From these, factored estimates of other plant costs were determined, leading to estimates (+ / - 30 % accuracy) of total plant capital cost. The 20 ton/hour processes were close to 25 million dollars except for the 230 degrees C case using dried wood chips which was only 15 million dollars because of its small furnace. The larger processes ranged from 64 - 120 million dollars. From these capital costs and projections of several categories of operating costs, the processing cost of thermally treated pine chips {{was found to be}} $ 28 - 33 per ton depending on the degree of treatment and without any credits for steam generation. If the excess energy output of the two 20 ton/hr depot cases at 270 degrees C can be sold for $ 10 per million BTU, the net processing cost dropped to $ 13 /ton product starting with green wood chips or only $ 3 per ton if using dried chips from the biorefinery. Including a 12 % return on invested capital raised all of the operating cost results by about $ 20 /ton...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Construction clients, particularly those {{with little or no}} previous experience of building projects, depend on the advice given by building professionals during the early design stages. Accurate advice regarding the <b>estimated</b> <b>cost</b> of the proposed project is fundamental, as this will determine the financial feasibility of the proposed project. All professionals give advice based on the information available to them at the time. Therefore, cost advisors need to have an accurate appreciation of the client's requirements from the building, before they can <b>estimate</b> the likely <b>cost.</b> Inexperienced building clients may have difficulty expressing their requirements, or understanding detailed technical information prepared by building professionals. This thesis addresses the problem of poor communication between clients and building professionals leading to mis-interpretation of mechanical and electrical (M&E) services requirements and inaccurate <b>cost</b> <b>estimates.</b> The research hypothesised that the cost of M&E services was related to the form and function of the building, {{and the quality of the}} M&E services required by the building client. It was believed that the required "quality" of the M&E services had a major cost implication, and therefore the production of an accurate <b>cost</b> <b>estimate</b> depended on an accurate understanding of the quality of M&E services required by the building client. The research examined existing <b>method,</b> of early <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> for M&E services, to establish how early <b>cost</b> <b>estimates</b> are prepared, and what type of information is considered. Detailed statistical analysis work was undertaken to examine relationships between various building form, parameters and M&E services costs, for buildings of different functions. M&E services quality was considered in relation to the function, performed by different systems, using the value engineering technique of function analyis and customer oriented function analysis system technique (FAST) diagrams method for improving early design stage communications developed, to improve the interpretation of M&E services quality requirements and lead to more accurate <b>cost</b> <b>estimates.</b> The <b>method</b> involved the introduction of a briefing workshop to consider functional requirements from the building, possible M&E services solutions, and interfaces between building structure and fabric and the M&E services. The proposed method was evaluated in the field. It was found to be a valid method of improving early design stage communications between clients and building professionals, that could lead to improved early cost advice for M&E services...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Estimating</b> <b>methods</b> {{may vary}} by type and class of <b>estimate.</b> The <b>method</b> used for most {{definitive}} estimates is to fully define {{and understand the}} scope, take off or quantify the scope, and apply costing to the scope, which can then be summed to a total cost. Proper documentation and review are also important. Pricing transforms the <b>cost</b> <b>estimate</b> into what the firm wishes to charge for the scope. Early estimates may employ various means of cost modeling. The basic characteristics of effective estimating include: clear identification of task, broad participation in preparing estimates, availability of valid data, standardized structure for the estimate, provision for program uncertainties, recognition of inflation, recognition of excluded costs, independent review of estimates, and revision of estimates for significant program changes. Application of best practices helps ensure a high-quality estimate. “Certain best practices should be followed if accurate and credible <b>cost</b> <b>estimates</b> are to be developed. These best practices represent an overall process of established, repeatable methods that result in high-quality <b>cost</b> <b>estimates</b> that are comprehensive and accurate {{and that can be}} easily and clearly traced, replicated, and updated.” ...|$|R
40|$|The {{increased}} interest in using Building Information Modeling (BIM) in detailed construction <b>cost</b> <b>estimates</b> calls for methodologies {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of BIM-Assisted Detailed Estimating (BADE) tools in generating detailed construction <b>cost</b> <b>estimates.</b> The focus of this research is on developing a quantified evaluation method to measure the impact of these BADE tools. Further, in order to understand the cognitive details of the estimator, this research also tested and evaluated the impact of the visualization factor and the compound impact of the visualization factor and aggregated calculation factor on the construction <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> process. Two cases study were tested, building and bridge. Three methods were applied on each case study,method 1 the manual <b>estimating</b> <b>method,</b> method 2 used a BADE tool without a calculation function (i. e., the quantities of the individual building components can be read as properties of the component), method 3 used a BADE tool with calculation functions that allowed the user to directly calculate/aggregate the query results of the BIM database in the MS Excel spreadsheet. Results obtained from the test cases helped to reinforce the reliability of the observations and the evaluation. Four parameters were used to evaluate the performance results individually in the first step: generality, flexibility, efficiency, and accuracy. Then a multiattribute utility model, which took into account the four individual parameters, was developed and used to evaluate the overall performance of BIM assisted estimating versus the performance of the traditional <b>estimating</b> <b>method</b> on quantity takeoffs. The research concluded that the BIM-assisted estimate demonstrated better performance over traditional <b>estimating</b> <b>methods.</b> Both the visualization and aggregation functions of the BADE tool had significant impact on the performance of the detailed estimate...|$|R
