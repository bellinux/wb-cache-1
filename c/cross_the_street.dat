5|$|Many {{stations}} in the subway system have mezzanines. Mezzanines allow for passengers to enter from multiple locations at an intersection and proceed to the correct platform without having to <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> before entering. Inside mezzanines are fare control areas, where passengers physically pay their fare to enter the subway system. In many older stations, the fare control area is at platform level with no mezzanine crossovers. Many elevated stations also have platform-level fare control with no common station house between directions of service.|$|E
5|$|The {{prosecution}} presented four {{witnesses to}} the court. Robert Chobert, a cab driver who testified he was parked behind Faulkner, identified Abu-Jamal as the shooter. Cynthia White, a prostitute, testified that Abu-Jamal emerged from a nearby parking lot and shot Faulkner. Michael Scanlan, a motorist, testified that from two car lengths away, he saw a man, matching Abu-Jamal's description, run {{across the street from}} a parking lot and shoot Faulkner. Albert Magilton, a pedestrian who did not see the shooting, testified to seeing Faulkner pull over Cook's car. As Abu-Jamal started to <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> toward them, Magilton turned away and lost sight of what happened next.|$|E

25|$|Mr. Trowbridge {{returned}} from the school {{to say that the}} only hope for safety to any Americans seemed to be to return to the school, staying there alone, separated from the Armenians. He declared that we were powerless to save the Armenians. It seems that after we left the school, Miss Wallace, Mr. Chambers, and a young Armenian preacher attempted to <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> from Miss Wallace's to the school. Just at this time a mob rushed around the corner. The infuriated Turks recognized the preacher as an Armenian, and although Mr. Chambers threw his arms about him and did all in his power to save the man's life, they shot him dead. Not a single Armenian would they leave alive, the assassins shouted, as Mr. Chambers dragged the murdered preacher into the building.|$|E
25|$|The {{station is}} part of the {{original}} set of stations which made up the first phase of Line 2. It was built on October 31, 1980 at Konkuk University intersection and originally called Hwayang Station. The initial section of Line 2 ran from Sinseoul-Dong to the Sports Complex Station in Jamsil-dong. On March 7, 1985 the station's name was changed from Hwayang to Konkuk University station. Line 7 was joined with Line 2 at this station on October 11, 1996. Star City, a residential and shopping complex, was finished in October 2008 {{with the opening of the}} Lotte Department Store. As part of the development an underground exit was built between the Line 7 platform and complex. It was opened on July 25, 2009. It links the areas without requiring passengers to <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> and will house several shops.|$|E
25|$|During construction, {{there was}} also {{controversy}} about the unused land between the new roadway and the old one, since Geneva didn't own all of the property. Geneva wanted the state to give the land the college didn't own for free. However, the state refused, but later sold the land (as well as the former Route 18 alignment, which became a private access road for the university) to Geneva. After construction of the new right-of-way was complete and opened, Geneva shrunk part of the southern end to a one-lane road (in order {{to make room for}} the expansion of Reeves Field) and put a sidewalk in where the northern end used to make the first bend in the s-turn, permanently blocking access to the s-bend. A traffic light was installed at the intersection along the new alignment with Geneva R.P. Church, requiring students to <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> at the light.|$|E

25|$|Many {{stations}} in the subway system have mezzanines. In underground stations, this typically consists of the first level below the street or the areas between the street and platform level. For open-cut, grade-level and elevated stations, prevalent in uptown Manhattan and the outer boroughs, the mezzanine area often consists of a station house at street level or above the street. Mezzanines allow for passengers to enter from multiple locations at an intersection and proceed to the correct platform without having to <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> before entering. At busy intersections, they also act as a pedestrian underpass or overpass. They also allow for crossover between uptown and downtown trains on side platforms or a pair of island platforms, which is very useful when local tracks are closed for construction. Within the mezzanines are fare control areas, where passengers physically pay their fare to enter the subway system. In underground subway stations built close to ground level or under narrow streets, a characteristic of early IRT and BMT construction, the fare control area is at platform level with no mezzanine crossovers. Many elevated stations also have platform-level fare control with no common station house between directions of service.|$|E
500|$|Later in 2003, The Hurricane [...] "discovered" [...] Rosey's {{potential}} as a superhero and christened him as [...] "Rosey, the Super Hero in Training" [...] (the S.H.I.T.). Rosey was involved in numerous sketches involving him training to be a superhero, including helping an old lady to <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> and attempting to get changed into his superhero costume in a phonebox. Rosey and The Hurricane teamed regularly together during this time, wrestling against teams including Chris Jericho and Christian and Evolution. On the July 19, 2004, episode of Raw, Rosey appeared with a new costume, seemingly graduated to a full superhero, officially turning him into a fan favorite.|$|E
500|$|The duel {{occurred}} as Goebel {{and two of}} his acquaintances went to cash a check in Covington. Goebel suggested they avoid Sanford's bank, but Sanford, standing outside the bank, engaged the trio in conversation before they could <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> to another bank. As Sanford greeted Goebel's friends, he offered his left hand, his right remaining on a pistol in his pocket. Goebel, noticing this and being likewise armed, clutched the revolver in his own pocket. Sanford asked Goebel, [...] "I understand that you assume authorship of that article?"; [...] "I do", replied Goebel. Witnesses agree that both men fired at each other, but none was sure who fired first. Goebel was uninjured, the bullet passing through his coat and ripping his trousers; Sanford was struck in the head and died five hours later. Goebel was acquitted, pleading self-defense, but the incident would haunt his political career. The acquittal was also significant because of prohibitions against duelling in the Kentucky Constitution. If Goebel had been convicted, he would have been ineligible to hold any public office.|$|E

[...] The next day, as Walter approaches Mike at the bar, Mike tells Walter that he observed Walter tailing him to the bar. Mike then reveals he could tell that Walter was carrying a weapon in the lab. Walter suggests he and Mike {{are in the same}} danger, and Gus could easily kill Mike the same way he killed Victor. This visibly unnerves Mike, who appears to be aware of this. Walter asks that Mike get him in a room with Gus so he can kill him. In response, Mike punches Walter, knocking him to the floor, kicks him in the torso a few times and then leaves the bar.|$|E

2500|$|Turns on red are {{especially}} problematic for pedestrians due to drivers looking left for traffic on red light and not noticing a pedestrian waiting to <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> to the driver's right. This {{may lead to}} a [...] "right hook" [...] collision when the driver and pedestrian both enter the intersection. Right on red reduces perceived safety for pedestrians and hence walkability. Suburbanization and car oriented development of the west has been a driving force behind right turn on red, although in some downtown core areas even in Western US right on red is explicitly prohibited with signs.|$|E

Nevertheless, the two often bicker, often behaving more like sisters than mother and daughter; however, in the manga, although both bicker towards one another, Chibiusa is shown to have an admiration for Usagi. At times, a mother and daughter relationship is established between the two, shown in various everyday actions such as Usagi holding Chibiusa's hand to <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> etc. In Sailor Moon Crystal, Usagi talks to Chibiusa as in a mix of motherly and sister fashion.|$|E
