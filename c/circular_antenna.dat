The compact <b>circular</b> microstrip <b>antenna</b> is realized by placing the shorting plate/post along the zero field line at fundamental TM 11 mode and by using {{only half of the}} shorted patch.

Because its huge circular reflecting screen looks like a circular fence, the antenna has been colloquially referred to as the elephant cage.

50|$|Mounted {{on either}} side of the {{tracking}} radar antenna is a small J band parabolic dish antenna to track the missile. Below that is a small <b>circular</b> <b>antenna</b> which emits an I band uplink capture beam to gather the missile shortly after launch. The final antennas in the array are two small white rectangular ones, one {{on either side}} of the array mounted alongside the I band. These are used for command uplink to the missile. This twin antenna system permits the 'Land Roll' radar to control up to two missiles simultaneously against a single target. Furthermore, the two missiles can be guided on different frequencies to further complicate ECM. There is also a tubular device fitted to and above the tracking radar; this is a 9Sh33 electro-optical tracker. It can be used to track the target when the main tracking radar is jammed by ECM.|$|E
