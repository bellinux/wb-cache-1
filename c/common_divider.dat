5000|$|Battery cages are {{a housing}} system used for various animal {{production}} methods, but primarily for egg-laying hens. The name {{arises from the}} arrangement of rows and columns of identical cages connected together, sharing <b>common</b> <b>divider</b> walls, as in the cells of a battery. Although the term is usually applied to poultry farming, similar cage systems are used for other animals. Battery cages have generated controversy between advocates for animal rights, and industrial producers. Battery cages are the predominant form of housing for laying hens worldwide. They reduce aggression and cannibalism among hens, but are barren, restrict movement, prevent many natural behaviours, and increase rates of osteoporosis. As of 2014, approximately 95% of eggs in the US were produced in battery cages.In the UK, statistics from the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) indicate that 50% of eggs produced in the UK throughout 2010 were from cages (45% from free-range, 5% from barns). [...] However, introduction of the European Union Council Directive 1999/74/EC which banned conventional battery cages in the EU from January 2012 for welfare reasons, means the number of eggs from battery cages in the EU states is rapidly decreasing.|$|E
40|$|The Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) has a {{dramatic}} {{impact on the}} growth of digital technology. VLSI has not only reduced the size and the cost, but also increased {{the complexity of the}} circuits. Due increase there is a problem of circuit testing, which becomes increasingly difficult as the scale of integration grows. One solution to this problem is to add logic to the IC so that it can test itself. In this paper we have design GCD (greatest <b>common</b> <b>divider)</b> processors in VHDL with BIST capability and compared the area overhead of with and without BIST...|$|E
30|$|In [16], we {{have already}} {{presented}} the basic idea for the protocol described here, that is, the time divisioned usage of a slot by multiple sensors. By means of calculation of the common factor between requested bitrates, a scheduling scheme can be found that allows the sharing of a single slot by multiple nodes through a round-robin like scheme. We proposed in this article to use the greatest <b>common</b> <b>divider</b> (gcd) as a common factor, which is a valid solution for bitrates that have a low least common multiple (lcm). However, since the periodicity {{is determined by the}} value of the lcm, it results in far too big cycles when the gcd is significantly smaller compared to the bitrates. Another disadvantage of this method is shown in [17], where it is mentioned that round-robin scheduling results in a fair schedule if all data amounts are equally sized. If they vary too much, nodes with more data are favored over others.|$|E

50|$|Convention centers, {{by their}} very nature, are large {{facilities}} with wide open internal spaces. Consequently, they often need to {{be broken down into}} smaller areas. The most <b>common</b> room <b>divider</b> used in convention center is pipe and drape. The convention center sets up frames made of plastic, metal, or wire tubing. Fabric material is then hung over the frame to create back drops and hide other unsightly places in addition to creating multiple subdivided rooms.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} an attempt to show the astronomical design {{principles}} that are encoded in the geometrical forms of the largest five pyramids of the fourth Egyptian dynasty, in Giza and Dahshur plateaus, based on using the pyramids’ design-modules that are mentioned in the so-called Rhind Mathematical Papyrus. It shows the astronomical algorithms for quantifying the slopes of pyramids, with reference to specific range of earth’s axial tilt, within spherical co-ordinates system. Besides, it decodes the design of the ancient Egyptian cubit rods with reference to the systems of measurement used by Herodotus and Diodorus, and proves that Herodotus never talked about Giza pyramids and he meant only the pyramids of Memphis in Dahshur. In addition, it proves that the Egyptian arrow of 22. 5 cm, or half the mean cubit of 45 cm, is the largest <b>common</b> <b>divider</b> of the design-modules of these pyramids, and accordingly it retrieves their intended astronomical design dimensions...|$|E
40|$|Under this {{research}} {{we developed a}} system destined as a teaching aid for students with communication difficulties. Our methodology examines the underlying mathematical concepts from a highly analytical perspective and derives appropriate courseware material of equivalent quality. The case-studies described in this paper deliver basic courseware on number theory and generalised mathematical concepts by presenting the geometrical meaning of the underlying concepts and providing alternative representations that enable understanding of the underlying theory. This process {{has resulted in the}} development of a visual set of case-studies that teach basic mathematical and geometrical concepts which may subsequently be extended to algorithms such as division, Greatest <b>Common</b> <b>Divider,</b> multiplication, least common multiplier, attributes and requirements for division. Interactive multimedia technologies are used extensively in the development of the teaching environment. A game-like interface aided by realistic binaural audio and animation has proved to attract user-attention for longer periods than using traditional teaching methods, aiding the educational process by providing an immersive multimedia interactivelearning alternative, for students with communication problems...|$|E
40|$|Medical {{image data}} is usually {{represented}} by a uniformly spaced grid of voxels. However, CT scanners for example are capable of producing non-uniformly spaced slice images. This is desirable when for a particular patient some regions (lesions) need to be imaged with a high resolution, while a lower resolution would be su#cient in other areas. Such an adaptive slice spacing can significantly reduce X-ray dose, thus directly benefiting the patient. Unfortunately, computational handling of the resulting volume data is far less e#cient than that of uniformly spaced images. To deal with this problem, the present paper introduces a novel data structure for non-uniformly spaced image coordinates, the so-called virtual uniform axes. By a generalization of Euclid's greatest <b>common</b> <b>divider</b> (GCD) algorithm, a table of virtual voxels on a uniform grid is produced. Each of the uniform voxels in the virtual grid holds a pointer to the corresponding voxel in the original, non-uniform grid. Finding a voxel in the virtual uniform image {{can be done in}} constant time as compared to logarithmic time for finding a voxel in a non-uniform image. This is achieved with significantly less additional storage than by resampling the image data itself to a uniform grid. Interpolation artifacts are also completely avoided...|$|E
