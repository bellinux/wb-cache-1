That eminent chemist was the first who {{drew attention to the}} distinction which may be made of all substances into two classes, termed by him crystalloids and colloids; or rather, of all states of matter into the crystalloid and the colloidal states, for many substances are capable of existing in either. When in the <b>colloidal</b> <b>state,</b> their sensible properties are very {{different from those of the}} same substance when crystallized, or when in a state easily susceptible of crystallization. Colloid substances pass with extreme difficulty and slowness into the crystalline state, and are extremely inert in all the ordinary chemical relations. Substances in the colloid state are almost always, when combined with water, more or less viscous or gelatinous. The most prominent examples of the state are certain animal and vegetable substances, particularly gelatine, albumen, starch, the gums, caramel, tannin, and some others. Among substances not of organic origin, the most notable instances are hydrated silicic acid, and hydrated alumina, with other metallic peroxides of the aluminous class.|$|E

Preparation of the Solution: This {{may involve}} several steps {{including}} adjustment of the pH {{of the solution}} {{in order for the}} precipitate to occur quantitatively and get a precipitate of desired properties, removing interferences, adjusting the volume of the sample to suit the amount of precipitating agent to be added. 2. Precipitation: This requires addition of a precipitating agent solution to the sample solution. Upon addition of the first drops of the precipitating agent, supersaturation occurs, then nucleation starts to occur where every few molecules of precipitate aggregate together forming a nucleous. At this point, addition of extra precipitating agent will either form new nuclei or will build up on existing nuclei to give a precipitate. This can be predicted by Von Weimarn ratio where, according to this relation the particle size is inversely proportional to a quantity called the relative supersaturation where Relative supersaturation = (Q - S)/S The Q is the concentration of reactants before precipitation, S is the solubility of precipitate in the medium from which it is being precipitated. Therefore, in order to get particle growth instead of further nucleation we need to make the relative supersaturation ratio as small as possible. The optimum conditions for precipitation which make the supersaturation low are: a. Precipitation using dilute solutions to decrease Qb. Slow addition of precipitating agent to keep Q as low as possiblec. Stirring the solution during addition of precipitating agent to avoid concentration sites and keep Q lowd. Increase solubility by precipitation from hot solutione. Adjust the pH in order to increase S but not a too much increase np as {{we do not want to}} loose precipitate by dissolutionf. Usually add a little excess of the precipitating agent for quantitative precipitation and check for completeness of the precipitation 3. Digestion of the precipitate: The precipitate is left hot (below boiling) for 30 min to 1 hour in order for the particles to be digested. Digestion involves dissolution of small particles and reprecipitation on larger ones resulting in particle growth and better precipitate characteristics. This process is called Ostwald ripening. An important advantage of digestion is observed for colloidal precipitates where large amounts of adsorbed ions cover the huge area of the precipitate. Digestion forces the small colloidal particles to agglomerate which decreases their surface area and thus adsorption. You should know that adsorption is a major problem in gravimetry in case of colloidal precipitate since a precipitate tends to adsorb its own ions present in excess, Therefore, forming what is called a primary ion layer which attracts ions from solution forming a secondary or counter ion layer. Individual particles repel each other keeping the colloidal properties of the precipitate. Particle coagulation can be forced by either digestion or addition of a high concentration of a diverse ions strong electrolytic solution in order to shield the charges on colloidal particles and force agglomeration. Usually, coagulated particles return to the <b>colloidal</b> <b>state</b> if washed with water, a process called peptization.|$|E

40|$|We poorly {{understand}} the macroscopic properties of complex fluids and of amorphous bodies in general. This is mainly {{due to the}} interplay between phenomena at different levels and length-scales. In particular, {{it is not necessarily}} true that the microscopic level (dominated by direct interactions) coincides with the level where the continuum description comes into play. This is typically the case in the presence of structural inhomogeneities which are inherent to all structurally disordered states of matter below close packing. As a consequence, the macroscopic response to external fields of either fluid or arrested disordered states is not well understood. In order to disentangle this complexity, in this work we build upon a simple yet seemingly powerful concept. This can be summarized as follows: the mesoscopic length-scale of structural inhomogeneities is assumed to be the characteristic length-scale of the effective building blocks, while the degrees of freedom of the primary particles are integrated out. Theoretical results are derived, in the present work, for the macroscopic response of fluid and dynamically arrested model <b>colloidal</b> <b>states</b> in fields of shear.

40|$|International audienceFor many {{decorative}} applications like {{industrial and}} architectural paints, prevention of metal substrates from corrosion {{is a primary}} function of organic coatings. Triggered release of inhibitor species is generally accepted as a remedy for starting corrosion in case of coatings damage. A polyurethane based coating, doped with bola-amphiphiles of varying molecular weight but with a common head group motif that stems from ring-opened alkenyl succinic anhydride, enables passivation of the defect and mitigates cathodic delamination, if applied on cold rolled steel. An antagonistic effect results from the intercalation of the bola-amphiphiles into layered double hydroxide Zn 2 Al(OH) 6 and subsequent incorporation of the hybrid phase into the organic matrix. In particular higher molecular weight bola-amphiphiles get immobilized through alkaline degradation of the layered framework in the basic milieu at the cathode. By means of sediments from <b>colloidal</b> <b>states</b> it is demonstrated that in-situ formed zinc oxide encapsulates the hybrid phase, evidenced by impeded dissolution of the ZnO based shell into caustic soda.

30|$|In {{terms of}} {{practical}} application, we evaluate here the potential generalization {{of this method}} to widespread homopolyelectrolytes (homoPEs). For the homoPEs without neutral part, we need to control their strong interaction with oppositely charged NPs and find a stable <b>colloidal</b> cluster <b>states</b> as polyelectrolyte-neutral block copolymers. As a matter of fact, when the PE chains are adsorbed on the particle surface, there exist competing electrostatic interactions which are attractive between the polymer and the oppositely charged surface and repulsive between the same charged polymers. Nguyen and Shklovskii explained that when the surface charge of the particle is reduced by condensed oppositely charged polyions, the correlation-induced short-range attraction dominates the long-range electrostatic repulsion, leading to the cluster formation [52 – 54]. Close to the isoelectric point, such destabilization (and eventually the precipitation of the solid fraction) is observed [55]. However, symmetrically {{on both sides of}} the isoelectric point, the formation of long-lived, finite size aggregates overstays [56 – 58]. These aggregates have a size ranging from a few hundred nanometers to a few microns, getting closer to the border of the ‘destabilization zone’. They form almost immediately when the polyelectrolyte is added to the colloidal suspension and then remain stable in time for weeks, without showing any tendency toward further aggregation.|$|R
