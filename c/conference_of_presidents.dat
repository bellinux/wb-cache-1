500|$|The {{assignment}} of the multilingualism portfolio to the Romanian Commissioner by Barroso was highly controversial. Barroso was severely criticized {{for creating a}} new Commissioner portfolio so that the accessing countries in 2007 could hold a post. The portfolio was criticized for being too [...] "light" [...] for such a high-rank official, {{that there would be}} an overlap of responsibilities with other Commissioners and the good functioning of the Commission would be endangered. The portfolio was considered insubstantial for a Commissioner due to the limited jurisdiction of the EU in affecting language policy and the more administrative (rather than political character) of the post. In addition, it appeared that the portfolio had been created to complete a 27-strong Commission; Romania's appointment of a technocrat rather than a politician, given the country's deficits in interior and justice policies, especially in terms of corruption, would result in the Romanian Commissioner taking a degraded portfolio. This criticism came from the Social Democratic Party (PSD), Romania's main opposition party, the Socialist Group (PES) in the European Parliament and the liberal Financial Times newspaper. Socialist Group leader, Martin Schulz, suggested a portfolio for the protection of ethnic minorities instead. The <b>Conference</b> <b>of</b> <b>Presidents</b> of the European Parliament asked Barroso to clarify the mandate of the Commissioner for Multilingualism as well as the mandate of {{the other members of the}} Commission with regards to the [...] "intercultural dialogue". Barroso turned down the PES proposal and defended the post. He stated that Ján Figeľ, the Commissioner for Education, Training and Culture, [...] "will remain responsible for the management of actions to directly promote the inter-cultural dialogue".|$|E

He concludes that most of the [...] "great ambivalent middle" [...] would not defend an apartheid Israel because [...] "American Jews are among the staunchest defenders of traditional liberal values" [...] resulting in the [...] "new Afrikaners" [...] becoming increasingly marginalized over time.
