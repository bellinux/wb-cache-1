5|$|A special but unusual <b>consideration</b> <b>is</b> {{cardiogenic}} shock, {{where the}} blood pressure is decreased not due to dehydration but due to inability of the heart to pump blood through the blood vessels. This situation requires ICU admission, monitoring of the central venous pressure (which requires the insertion of a central venous catheter in a large upper body vein), and the administration of medication that increases the heart pumping action and blood pressure.|$|E
5|$|According to the Rocky Mountain Institute, sound biofuel {{production}} practices would not hamper food and fibre production, nor cause water or environmental problems, and would enhance soil fertility. The selection of {{land on which}} to grow the feedstocks is {{a critical component of}} the ability of biofuels to deliver sustainable solutions. A key <b>consideration</b> <b>is</b> the minimisation of biofuel competition for prime cropland.|$|E
5|$|For {{patients}} who benefit, half achieve a seizure reduction within five days (if the diet starts {{with an initial}} fast of one to two days), three-quarters achieve a reduction within two weeks, and 90% achieve a reduction within 23 days. If the diet does not begin with a fast, the time for half of the patients to achieve an improvement is longer (two weeks) but the long-term seizure reduction rates are unaffected. Parents are encouraged to persist with the diet {{for at least three}} months before any final <b>consideration</b> <b>is</b> made regarding efficacy.|$|E

5|$|In 2002, Member of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly Janet Woollard {{called for}} the statue's {{genitalia}} to be covered up, but nothing was done. In November 2005 Richard Wilkes again {{called for the}} statue's groin to be covered, {{on the grounds that}} such a depiction would be more historically accurate, as Yagan would have worn a covering for most of the year. Also under <b>consideration</b> <b>is</b> {{the creation of a new}} statue with a head shape that accords better with the forensic reconstruction of Yagan's head.|$|E
5|$|The final <b>consideration</b> <b>is</b> cost: {{how much}} will a {{particular}} defensive strategy cost a plant in energy and materials? This is particularly important, as energy spent on defense cannot be used for other functions, such as reproduction and growth. The optimal defense hypothesis predicts that plants will allocate more energy towards defense when the benefits of protection outweigh the costs, specifically in situations where there is high herbivore pressure.|$|E
5|$|To numerically add {{physical}} quantities with units, {{they must}} be expressed with common units. For example, adding 50milliliters to 150milliliters gives 200milliliters. However, if a measure of 5feet is extended by 2inches, the sum is 62inches, since 60inches is synonymous with 5feet. On the other hand, it is usually meaningless to try to add 3meters and 4square meters, since those units are incomparable; this sort of <b>consideration</b> <b>is</b> fundamental in dimensional analysis.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{generally}} accepted maximum penetration of wind energy {{that would be}} feasible in any given grid. Rather, economic efficiency and cost <b>considerations</b> <b>are</b> more likely to dominate as critical factors; technical solutions may allow higher penetration levels {{to be considered in}} future, particularly if cost <b>considerations</b> <b>are</b> secondary.|$|R

5|$|The Norwegian Border Commissioner {{is located}} in Kirkenes and is {{responsible}} for managing the Norway–Russia border and upholding the border agreement. Special <b>consideration</b> <b>is</b> needed {{as it is the}} only non-Schengen Area land border of Norway. Border controls are the responsibility of the respective police district. The National Police Computing and Material Service is responsible for managing the police's information and communications technology, procurement, security and real estate. Norway has two joint rescue coordination centers, one for Northern Norway located in Bodø and on one for Southern Norway located in Sola. Their jurisdiction border goes at the 65th parallel north (Nord-Trøndelag–Nordland border). Organizationally they are directly subordinate to the Ministry of Justice and the Police, although their operations are subordinate to the chiefs of police in Salten and Rogaland, respectively. The Police Security Service is Norway's security agency; although considered a law enforcement agency, it is not subordinate to the National Police Directorate nor part of the Norwegian Police Service.|$|E
5|$|The lung/swim bladder {{originated}} as {{an outgrowth}} of the gut, forming a gas-filled bladder above the digestive system. In its primitive form, the air bladder was open to the alimentary canal, a condition called physostome and still found in many fish. The primary function is not entirely certain. One <b>consideration</b> <b>is</b> buoyancy. The heavy scale armour of the early bony fishes would certainly weigh the animals down. In cartilaginous fishes, lacking a swim bladder, the open sea sharks need to swim constantly to avoid sinking into the depths, the pectoral fins providing lift. Another factor is oxygen consumption. Ambient oxygen was relatively low in the early Devonian, possibly about half of modern values. Per unit volume, there is much more oxygen in air than in water, and vertebrates are active animals with a high energy requirement compared to invertebrates of similar sizes. The Devonian saw increasing oxygen levels which opened up new ecological niches by allowing groups able to exploit the additional oxygen to develop into active, large-bodied animals. Particularly in tropical swampland habitats, atmospheric oxygen is much more stable, and may have prompted a reliance of lungs rather than gills for primary oxygen uptake. In the end, both buoyancy and breathing may have been important, and some modern physostome fishes do indeed use their bladders for both.|$|E
