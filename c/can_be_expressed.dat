5|$|Human {{language}} {{is unique in}} comparison {{to other forms of}} communication, such as those used by non-human animals.

5|$|Possession <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>expressed</b> {{either by}} the possessive {{enclitic}} -s (also traditionally called a genitive suffix), or by the preposition of. Historically the -s possessive {{has been used for}} animate nouns, whereas the of possessive has been reserved for inanimate nouns. Today this distinction is less clear, and many speakers use -s also with inanimates. Orthographically the possessive -s is separated from the noun root with an apostrophe.|$|E
5|$|The derived {{units in}} the SI are formed by powers, {{products}} or quotients of the base units and are unlimited in number. Derived units are associated with derived quantities, for example velocity is a quantity that {{is derived from the}} base quantities of time and length, so in SI the derived unit is metres per second (symbol m/s). The dimensions of derived units <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>expressed</b> in terms of the dimensions of the base units.|$|E
5|$|In 1962, Kestin and Persen {{published}} a paper describing solutions for heat transfer when the thermal boundary layer is contained entirely within the momentum layer and for various wall temperature distributions. For {{the problem of}} a flat plate with a temperature jump at , they propose a substitution that reduces the parabolic thermal boundary-layer equation to an ordinary differential equation. The solution to this equation, the temperature {{at any point in}} the fluid, <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>expressed</b> as an incomplete gamma function. Schlichting proposed an equivalent substitution that reduces the thermal boundary-layer equation to an ordinary differential equation whose solution is the same incomplete gamma function.|$|E

5|$|In archaea such as Thermoplasma acidophilum, all the α {{and all the}} β {{subunits}} are identical, whereas eukaryotic proteasomes such {{as those}} in yeast contain seven distinct types of each subunit. In mammals, the β1, β2, and β5 subunits are catalytic; although they share a common mechanism, they have three distinct substrate specificities considered chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like, and peptidyl-glutamyl peptide-hydrolyzing (PHGH). Alternative β forms denoted β1i, β2i, and β5i <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>expressed</b> in hematopoietic cells in response to exposure to pro-inflammatory signals such as cytokines, in particular, interferon gamma. The proteasome assembled with these alternative subunits is known as the immunoproteasome, whose substrate specificity is altered relative to the normal proteasome.|$|E
5|$|The NZGB {{encourages}} {{the use of}} original Māori names and has given some places official double names. These <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>expressed</b> as alternative names where officially either name could be used (Mount Taranaki or Mount Egmont) or dual names where both names should be used together (Matiu / Somes Island). In 1998, {{as a result of}} the settling of the Ngai Tahu Treaty claim, New Zealand's tallest mountain officially became Aoraki / Mount Cook. There are also a few English dual names, with Wellington harbour also officially known as Port Nicholson.|$|E
5|$|The {{genetic code}} is {{the set of}} rules by which {{information}} encoded within genetic material (DNA or mRNA sequences) is translated into proteins by living cells. Translation is accomplished by the ribosome, which links amino acids in an order specified by mRNA, using transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules to carry amino acids and to read the mRNA three nucleotides at a time. The genetic code is highly similar among all organisms and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>expressed</b> in a simple table with 64 entries.|$|E

The marginal opportunity costs of guns in terms of butter is simply the reciprocal of the marginal opportunity cost of butter in terms of guns. If, for example, the (absolute) slope at point BB in the diagram is equal to 2, to produce one more packet of butter, the production of 2 guns must be sacrificed. If at AA, the marginal opportunity cost of butter in terms of guns is equal to 0.25, the sacrifice of one gun could produce four packets of butter, and the opportunity cost of guns in terms of butter is 4.|$|E
5|$|The term anekāntavāda is {{not found}} in early texts {{considered}} canonical by Shwetambara tradition of Jainism (denied by Digambara tradition as canonical). However, traces of the doctrines are found in comments of Mahavira in these Shwetambara texts, where he states that the finite and infinite depends on one's perspective. The word anekantavada was coined by Acharya Siddhasen Divakar to significant the teaching of Mahavira that truth <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>expressed</b> in infinite ways. The earliest comprehensive teachings of anekāntavāda doctrine {{is found in the}} Tattvarthasutra of Umasvati, and is considered to be authoritative by all Jain sects. In the Digambara tradition texts. The 'two-truths theory' of Kundakunda also provides the core of this doctrine.|$|E
5|$|Geometrical optics {{provides}} further matrix applications. In this approximative theory, {{the wave}} nature of light is neglected. The {{result is a}} model in which light rays are indeed geometrical rays. If the deflection of light rays by optical elements is small, the action of a lens or reflective element on a given light ray <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>expressed</b> as multiplication of a two-component vector with a two-by-two matrix called ray transfer matrix: the vector's components are the light ray's slope and its distance from the optical axis, while the matrix encodes {{the properties of the}} optical element.

5|$|Historian {{of science}} Thierry Bardini argues that Engelbart's complex {{personal}} philosophy (which drove all his research) foreshadowed the modern {{application of the}} concept of coevolution to the philosophy and use of technology. Bardini points out that Engelbart was strongly influenced by the principle of linguistic relativity developed by Benjamin Lee Whorf. Where Whorf reasoned that the sophistication of a language controls the sophistication of the thoughts that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>expressed</b> by a speaker of that language, Engelbart reasoned that the state of our current technology controls our ability to manipulate information, and that fact in turn will control our ability to develop new, improved technologies. He thus set himself to the revolutionary task of developing computer-based technologies for manipulating information directly, and also to improve individual and group processes for knowledge-work.|$|E
