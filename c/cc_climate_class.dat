40|$|The surface {{radiation}} budget {{of a region}} is strongly tied to its climate. An 8 -yr climatology of surface {{radiation budget}} components for 2. 5 deg over the earth is examined {{in order to learn}} how the regional climate and surface radiation are related. The yearly cycles of a few individual regions were studied by plotting monthly mean net longwave flux as a function of net shortwave flux at the surface. These plots show trajectories that are characteristic of the <b>climate</b> <b>class.</b> The behavior of the trajectories of surface radiation and their relation to the regional climate can be understood with simple conceptual models for many cases. From an examination of these trajectories, a set of parameters is developed, such as mean net longwave flux and range of net shortwave flux, which distinguish various <b>climate</b> <b>classes</b> {{on the basis of the}} surface radiation. These criteria are applied to produce a map of regional <b>climate</b> <b>classes</b> based on surface radiation, similar to those of Koeppen or Trewartha and Horn, which were based on vegetation, temperature, and precipitation.

40|$|An {{understanding}} of the diurnal cycle of surface radiation is fundamental to modeling climate. For example, deep convection is initiated by the solar heating of the surface during the day, and the height to which the convection carries heat, water vapor and momentum greatly influences the resulting global circulation. The NASA/GEWEX surface radiation budget (SRB) data set is {{used to examine the}} relation of the diurnal cycles to regional climate for the average July. Over land, the net shortwave flux (SWN) at the surface provides the driving energy for the diurnal cycle of the surface temperature, which creates the diurnal cycle of the longwave upward flux (LWU). The boundary layer heating results in the cycle of longwave downward flux (LWD). The diurnal cycles of SWN, LWU and LWD over land can each be described to first order as a principal component for the time variation and a geographical coefficient, which is the empirical orthogonal function. The coefficient map is partitioned into <b>climate</b> <b>classes,</b> and a two-dimensional histogram in the domain of LWU and SWN is constructed for each class. The points cluster {{in different parts of the}} domain according to the <b>climate</b> <b>class.</b> These clusters are explained by the circulation and cloud patterns of the <b>climate</b> <b>classes.</b> For ocean, the processes are different. Since the surface skin temperature is held constant during the day-night in the SRB data set, the diurnal cycle of LWU over ocean is neglected in this study. Hence, the diurnal cycle of LWD over ocean is due to the absorption of shortwave flux within the atmosphere...|$|R

The present study compares seven methods of calculating PBL depth in the GEOS- 5 atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) over land. These methods depend on the eddy diffusion coefficients, bulk and local Richardson numbers, and the turbulent kinetic energy. The computed PBL depths are aggregated to the Koppen <b>climate</b> <b>classes,</b> and some limited comparisons are made using radiosonde profiles. Most methods produce similar midday PBL depths, although in the warm, moist <b>climate</b> <b>classes,</b> the bulk Richardson number method gives midday results that are lower than those given by the eddy diffusion coefficient methods. Additional analysis revealed that methods sensitive to turbulence driven by radiative cooling produce greater PBL depths, this effect being most significant during the evening transition. Nocturnal PBLs based on Richardson number are generally shallower than eddy diffusion coefficient based estimates. The bulk Richardson number estimate is recommended as the PBL height to inform {{the choice of the}} turbulent length scale, based on the similarity to other methods during the day, and the improved nighttime behavior...|$|R

40|$|The annual {{cycles of}} surface shortwave flux are {{investigated}} using the 8 -yr dataset {{of the surface}} radiation budget (SRB) components for the period July 1983 -June 1991. These components include the downward, upward, and net shortwave radiant fluxes at the earth's surface. The seasonal cycles are quantified in terms of principal components that describe the temporal variations and empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) that describe the spatial patterns. The {{major part of the}} variation is simply due to the variation of the insolation {{at the top of the}} atmosphere, especially for the first term, which describes 92. 4 % of the variance for the downward shortwave flux. However, for the second term, which describes 4. 1 % of the variance, the effect of clouds is quite important and the effect of clouds dominates the third term, which describes 2. 4 % of the variance. To a large degree the second and third terms are due to the response of clouds to the annual cycle of solar forcing.

We have used tracer simulations of aerosols emitted from MPCs worldwide to assess the fractions which are deposited at various distances away from their source location. Considering only source location, prevailing meteorology, and the aerosol size and solubility, we show that fine aerosol particles have a high potential to pollute remote regions. About half of the emitted mass of aerosol tracers with an ambient diameter Ã¢ÂÂ¤ 1. 0 ÃÂ¼m is typically deposited in regions more than 1000 km away from the source. Furthermore, using the KÃÂ¶ppen-Geiger climate classification to categorize the sources into various <b>climate</b> <b>classes</b> we find substantial differences in the deposition potential between these classes. Tracers originating in arid regions show the largest remote deposition potentials, with values more than doubled compared to the smallest potentials from tracers in tropical regions. Seasonal changes in atmospheric conditions lead to variations in the remote deposition potentials. On average the remote deposition potentials in summer correspond to about 70 Ã¢ÂÂ 80 % of the values in winter, with a large spread among the <b>climate</b> <b>classes.</b> For tracers from tropical regions the summer remote deposition values are only about 31 % of the winter values, while they are about 95 % for tracers from arid regions...|$|R

40|$|Access {{to natural}} {{resources}} {{is a problem}} current and future generations must overcome. To better understand potential changes in access for society due to environmental impacts, global spatio-temporal modeling is required. Spatial data for global assessments have uncertainty, and decision making can be problematic in regards to combining data. The basic problem associated with combining data for global assessments is the data’s heterogeneous nature in terms of source, type, quality, uncertainty, and accuracy. The data uncertainty must be communicated. The overarching question is: how can uncertain information be defined and modelled for global scale studies? This thesis applies geographic information systems for solving spatial questions requiring the combination of several data sets that cover large geographical areas, come from many different data providers, and have varying quality with known and unknown uncertainty. The thesis uses combined spatial data for decision-making related to petroleum exploration and climate change. The first section elucidates the spatial understanding of <b>climate</b> <b>class</b> change on ecosystem services. An ecosystem service assessment valuation composed of 19 criteria is proposed. A global, spatial valuation is calculated by combining empirical data from 23 spatial and nonspatial databases. The global value presented is less than previous studies; however, this study excludes criteria from previous publications {{and was unable to}} reliably quantify all criteria. Uncertainty in the input data are described but not quantified. Using five general circulation models and four representative concentration pathways, the Köppen-Geiger climate classification transitions were modeled from 2005 to 2099. The ecosystem service value was evaluated to quantify how much would be in a new <b>climate</b> <b>class.</b> Depending on the representative concentration pathway, between 25 - 66 % of the ecosystem service value will be affected by a <b>climate</b> <b>class</b> change. Uncertainty in the results are presented as a range of values. The second section focuses on using spatial multi-criteria evaluation and error propagation for petroleum exploration. The first part proposes a fuzzy logic multi-criteria evaluation by combining 16 criteria comprised of 26 data sets. The data sets are empirically defined and expert-based. The use of fuzzy logic is meant to mimic the traditional approach by a geologist evaluating the data but provides a framework for consistency, repeatability, and uncertainty evaluation. A case study of northern South America predicts new areas for exploration. Uncertainty is quantified {{in the second half of}} the study. After the multi-criteria evaluation is applied, the attribute classification, fuzzy logic memberships, and multi-criteria evaluation calculations are subjected to an error propagation analysis in order to quantify the uncertainty. The error propagation analysis showed that attribute classification using expert-defined uncertainty was the preferred approach over a constant defined uncertainty. Further, attribute classification uncertainty affected the results more than the fuzzy membership uncertainty, which could therefore be omitted; uncertainty related to the multi-criteria evaluation calculations heavily influenced the results and thus require care when selecting. In the concluding remarks, a data and model transparency checklist is provided based on what may be considered appropriate points in a study to quantify or describe the uncertainty in a model...|$|R
