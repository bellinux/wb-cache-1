25|$|The {{arrival of}} Europeans to New Zealand {{dates back to}} the 17th century, {{although}} {{it was not until the}} expeditions of James <b>Cook</b> <b>over</b> a hundred years later that any meaningful interactions occurred between Europeans and Māori. For Māori, the new arrivals brought opportunities for trade, which many groups embraced eagerly. Early European settlers introduced tools, weapons, clothing and foods to Māori across New Zealand, in exchange for resources, land and labour. Māori began selectively adopting elements of Western society during the 19th century, including European clothing and food, and later Western education, religion and architecture.|$|E
25|$|The chief's crest is a boar's head erased, argent, {{holding in}} its mouth a deer's shankbone, proper. A Mackinnon legend that is {{supposed}} to explain the chief's crest is of a Mackinnon who was hunting on the shores of Loch Scavaig in Skye. After becoming separated from his hunting party the Mackinnon spent the night in a cave for shelter. While preparing some venison which he was about to <b>cook</b> <b>over</b> an open fire he was attacked by a wild boar which charged into the cave. Mackinnon then drove the butchered deer's leg into the mouth of the boar, jamming it open, before killing the wild animal.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of pottery {{allowed for the}} creation of fireproof cooking vessels in a variety of shapes and sizes. Coating the earthenware with some type of plant gum, and later glazes, converted the porous container into a waterproof vessel. The earthenware cookware could then be suspended over a fire through use of a tripod or other apparatus, or even be placed directly into a low fire or coal bed {{as in the case of}} the pipkin. Ceramics conduct heat poorly, however, so ceramic pots must <b>cook</b> <b>over</b> relatively low heats and over long periods of time. However, most ceramic pots will crack if used on the stovetop, and are only intended for the oven.|$|E

60|$|The Mexicans were leisurely cooking {{their morning}} meal. They had two fires, one for warmth, {{the other to}} <b>cook</b> <b>over.</b> Gale had an idea these raiders were {{familiar}} to him. It seemed all these border hawks resembled one another--being mostly small of build, wiry, angular, swarthy-faced, and black-haired, and they wore the oddly styled Mexican clothes and sombreros. A slow wrath stirred in Gale {{as he watched the}} trio. They showed not the slightest indication of breaking camp. One fellow, evidently the leader, packed a gun at his hip, the only weapon in sight. Gale noted this with speculative eyes. The raiders had slept inside the little adobe house, and had not yet brought out the carbines. Next Gale swept his gaze to the corral, in which he saw more than a dozen horses, some of them fine animals. They were stamping and whistling, fighting one another, and pawing the dirt. This was entirely natural behavior for desert horses penned in when they wanted to get at water and grass.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{can feel}} for him, my love," [...] said Valentine, {{pointing}} {{a piece of}} chalk for Zack. [...] "The tradespeople have harassed me--not because I could not pay them certainly, but because I could not add up their bills. Never owe any man enough, Zack, {{to give him the}} chance of punishing you for being in his debt, with a sum to do in simple addition. At the time when I had bills (go on with your drawing; you can listen, and draw too), I used, of course, to think it necessary to check the tradespeople, and see that their Total was right. You will hardly believe me, but I don't remember ever making the sum what the shop made it, on more than about three occasions. And, what was worse, if I tried a second time, I could not even get it to agree with what I had made it myself the first time. Thank Heaven, I've no difficulties of that sort to grapple with now! Everything's paid for the moment it comes in. If the butcher hands a leg of mutton to the <b>cook</b> <b>over</b> the airey railings, the cook hands him back six and nine--or whatever it is--and takes his bill and receipt. I eat my dinners now, with the blessed conviction that they won't all disagree with me in an arithmetical point of view {{at the end of the}} year. What are you stopping and scratching your head for in that way?" ...|$|E
6000|$|There {{is another}} thing I want to explain about before I stop. Mary Vance told me that Mr. Evan Boyd is blaming the Lew Baxters for {{stealing}} potatoes out of his field last fall. They did not touch his potatoes. They are very poor, but they are honest. It was us did it--Jerry and Carl and I. Una was not with us at the time. We never thought it was stealing. We just wanted a few potatoes to <b>cook</b> <b>over</b> a fire in Rainbow Valley one evening to eat with our fried trout. Mr. Boyd's field was the nearest, just between the valley and the village, so we climbed over his fence and pulled up some stalks. The potatoes were awful small, because Mr. Boyd did not put enough fertilizer on them {{and we had to}} pull up a lot of stalks before we got enough, and then they were not much bigger than marbles. Walter and Di Blythe helped us eat them, but they did not come along until we had them cooked and did not know where we got them, so they were not to blame at all, only us. We didn't mean any harm, but if it was stealing we are very sorry and we will pay Mr. Boyd for them if he will wait until we grow up. We never have any money now because we are not big enough to earn any, and Aunt Martha says it takes every cent of poor father's salary, even when it is paid up regularly--and it isn't often--to run this house. But Mr. Boyd must not blame the Lew Baxters any more, when they were quite innocent, and give them a bad name. [...] Yours respectfully, [...] FAITH MEREDITH." ...|$|E
