40|$|Recently, {{there has}} been a lot of {{research}} on floating wind turbines. These structures have to be moored for a station keeping, which is relatively straightforward for deep waters. In transitional water depths (35 - 70 m) however, it is not obvious how to find a good, cost-efficient mooring system. In this thesis a catenary mooring system for a typical floating wind turbine is designed with different options for the cables: chains, metal and synthetic rope, mixed type and <b>clump</b> <b>weights.</b> The analyses are executed with a Matlab model developed by the author. This helps to explore and improve the design and therefore lower the cost. Mooring system stiffness is calculated for catenary lines, and the environmental excitations are modelled as turbulent wind and random waves. The results are verified with DNV software, using a model for a floating wind turbine that already exists. The results are same, and a mooring system with <b>clump</b> <b>weights</b> is proposed to a floating wind turbine. This is because <b>clump</b> <b>weights</b> ensure horizontal loads to the anchors. Therefore the possibility for shorter lines and lower costs, compared to other options. The reader will find the developed model in appendix helpful in optimizing mooring systems with different line segments, and <b>clump</b> <b>weights.</b> Input is wave and wind loading, output is station keeping performance. The primary reference used for this thesis is "Developments in Offshore Engineering: Wave Phenomena and Offshore Topics" (Herbich, 1999). This book provides a method to calculate tension-displacement characteristics for a mooring line of different segments and <b>clump</b> <b>weights.</b> The reader is encouraged to consult the references for through discussion of the various topics connected to optimizing a mooring system for a floating wind turbine. This subject requires more discussion than can be afforded herein. For further work, the stability of the floating wind turbine needs to be studied. </p...|$|R

40|$|A new hybrid {{mooring system}} based on the {{traditional}} taut mooring lines was proposed in the present study. A series of <b>clump</b> <b>weights</b> were attached to {{the lower end of}} each mooring line to form a catenary shape. Some buoys were connected to the upper ends of the lines to reduce the top tension on each mooring line. In order to verify the advantages of this new hybrid system, we investigated the motion responses of a semi-submersible platform moored by the proposed hybrid mooring system. The top tension on the lines was also calculated by using the time domain method. Comparing the results from the taut mooring system, it can be found that the tension on the lines could be reduced by using the present hybrid mooring system, while the motion responses were hardly influenced. Furthermore, a catenary shape was formed {{at the lower end of}} each mooring line, which could reduce the requirement of the anti-uplift capacity of the anchors. We also carried out the parametric study to investigate the optimal position and volume of the buoys. The discussions were highlighted on the influence of the water depth...|$|R

50|$|Deployment usually starts by {{lowering}} the <b>clump</b> <b>weight,</b> which is a large ballast weight suspended from a cable which runs down one side from the gantry, {{through a set of}} sheaves on the weight, and up the other side back to the gantry, where it is fastened. The weight hangs freely between the two parts of the cable, and due to its weight, hangs horizontally and keeps the cable under tension. The bell hangs between the parts of the cable, and has a fairlead on each side which slides along the cable as it is lowered or lifted. Deployment of the bell is by a cable attached to the top. As the bell is lowered, the fairleads prevent it from rotating on the deployment cable, which would put twist into the umbilical and risk loops or snagging. The <b>clump</b> <b>weight</b> cables therefore act as guidelines or rails along which the bell is lowered to the workplace, and raised back to the platform. If the lifting winch or cable fails, and the bell ballast is released, a positively buoyant bell can float up and the cables will guide it to the surface to a position where it can be recovered relatively easily. The <b>clump</b> <b>weight</b> cable can also be used as an emergency recovery system, in which case both bell and weight are lifted together. An alternative system for preventing rotation on the lifting cable is the use of a cross-haul system, which may also be used as a means of adjusting the lateral position of the bell at working depth, and as an emergency recovery system.|$|E

The bell's drop weights, another secondary means of bell recovery, were lashed to the bell frame with nylon rope to prevent their accidental release. The accidental release of drop weights had caused fatal diving bell accidents in the North Sea in 1974 and 1976. The Wildrake bell also had no bell stage to keep the bottom hatch out of the mud if the bell became stranded on the sea bottom.|$|E

40|$|Master's thesis in Offshore technologyThe dive {{support vessel}} Seven Havila {{is a new}} and top modern vessel with the most {{advanced}} dive system in the world. In 2011 she was awarded with the prestigious title “Support Vessel of the Year”. But modern design has their downsides, as a design often needs several versions before all the “child diseases” are gone. Onboard Seven Havila a problem was encountered in the bell handling system. They are having {{a problem with the}} port and starboard bell <b>clump</b> <b>weight</b> deployment angle. The problem is that when the <b>clump</b> <b>weight</b> is deployed before the bell, the <b>clump</b> <b>weight</b> gets a tilt up to 60 degrees. Over a period of time this will cause the guide wires and bell frame bushes to wear and will increase the amount of maintenance. The objective with this master thesis is to find possible solutions to straighten up the deployment/ recovery angle so they are sitting in the horizontal position as the design specification instructed. As a research method, experimental trials with a <b>clump</b> <b>weight</b> model have been conducted. Studies of other <b>clump</b> <b>weight</b> designs were also {{an important part of the}} research. Simple calculations have been done to give an indication of the effect of the different solutions. Several of the solutions will have a positive effect, but none of the solutions, except the use of two winches instead of one, will remove the tilt problem completely. The use of ballast weight to lower the CoG gave good results in the test trials, but because we are limited with the amount of weight we are allowed to add, we cannot expect the same effect. The use of support arms to act as a momentum counter to the tilt force gave the best results during the trials. The final recommendation is to either: 1. Expand the diameter on the split bush and to add the allowable weight of 250 kg at the bottom of the <b>clump</b> <b>weight.</b> A lower COG will counter the tilt angle while the expanded diameter will allow for more free space and reduce the amount of friction caused by the bend. 2. Install supports arms and where the remaining weight is placed at the bottom of the <b>clump</b> <b>weight.</b> The first option will require less work and is more cost effective than the second option, but the last option will give more tilt reduction...|$|E

40|$|A recent {{development}} in bottom trawling {{is the use}} of twin trawl equipment, where two trawl nets are towed side by side from a single vessel. This increases the catch rate and efficiently of the trawler. Governed by cost and catch optimization, the use of twin trawl systems are expected to become more popular in the future. Using two trawl nets will, in addition to trawl doors on each side, require a heavy <b>clump</b> <b>weight</b> in the middle to prevent the trawl nets lifting from the seabed. The largest clump weights can have a mass up to 9000 kg and can cause substantial load towed across subsea pipelines, and may in many cases be the governing design load with respect to external loads in pipeline design. The main objective in this thesis work was to simulate and investigate pull-over forces from clump weights on free spanning pipelines. All simulations were carried out in the computer software SIMLA. Six different small scale tests were simulated in order to verify the finite element model, a very good agreement was obtained. Design loads from trawl gear are generally implemented according to DNV-RP-F 111. The calculation methods provided in this recommended practice are based on the same small scale tests which was made available to this thesis work for verification purposes. The validity range of DNV-RP-F 111 reflects the range of the small scale tests i. e. only valid for rigid pipelines. The effect of increasing pipeline flexibility was investigated. Simulations were carried out for span heights 0. 25 m, 0. 50 m and 0. 75 m for a 12 ” pipeline. Two different pipeline models was applied, a 25 m rigid pipeline model with spring representing the lateral pipeline stiffness, and a 1000 m pipeline model including realistic soil resistance. The major finding was that pull-over forces decrease for increasing pipeline flexibility. Compared to DNV-RP-F 111 the obtained pull-over loads was found considerably lower, both in magnitude and duration. To avoid over-conservatism it is thus recommended that a design method accounting for pipeline flexibility should be developed and used in future pipeline designs. The effect of warp angle was simulated varying the warp line length from 2. 5 to 3. 5 times the water depth. The horizontal pull-over force was found to increase for increasing warp line length. Regarding <b>clump</b> <b>weight</b> design and towing configuration, simulations have shown that a forward <b>clump</b> <b>weight</b> center of gravity will reduce the pull-over loads. Applying a lower warp line attachment point resulted in a more uniform sliding motion of the <b>clump</b> <b>weight</b> during interference and pull-over loads was almost complete reduced to a case of initial impact. It is thus suggested that future <b>clump</b> <b>weight</b> design should reflect this to reduce interference loads on both trawl gear and subsea pipelines. </p...|$|E
40|$|Lately, {{focus is}} put on {{renewable}} energy resources as the environmental concerns regarding exploitation of hydrocarbons are increasing. The enormous energy potential found in offshore wind fields is proposed utilized by installing floating wind turbines in interconnected wind farms. As for all other floating structures operating within a limited area, stationkeeping is {{needed in order to}} keep the motions of the floating structure within permissible limits. In this study, methods for selecting and optimising the mooring system for floating wind turbines in shallow water are investigated. The design of the mooring system is checked against the governing rules and standards. Initially, the forces and moments associated with such structures are identified as the various terms in the equations of motions. Furthermore, the different mooring system concepts investigated in the study are described. They include distributed mass-, clump weight-, and buoyancy element mooring system. They are all based on the Hywind design with three distributed main mooring lines, each split into two delta-lines. Software programs suitable for analysing the system behaviour are recognized as SIMO, Riflex and TDHMILL 3 D. The analysis methods include quasi-static catenary analysis, eigenvalue analysis and decay analysis, in addition to integrated time domain analysis. The mooring system concepts are studied, and the <b>clump</b> <b>weight</b> mooring system is shown to be the preferred one with respect to limiting peak tensions in the mooring lines. The selected design concept is subjected to an optimisation procedure, where the main focus is to select mooring line segments with adequate breaking strength to sustain the maximum line tension with sufficient margins and to avoid vertical forces on the anchors. From parameter studies, the size of the <b>clump</b> <b>weight</b> is shown to be the most influential design parameter. Other parameters investigated include the position of the <b>clump</b> <b>weight,</b> pretension, overall length of the mooring system, chain and wire weight/dimension, vertical fairlead position and the delta-line length. Finally, the intact optimised mooring system is checked against the Ultimate limit state, while Accidental limit state control is performed for the mooring system in damaged condition. Both the cases of loss of line and loss of <b>clump</b> <b>weight</b> are investigated. The Troll field is selected as design location. For the Ultimate limit state, the criteria given in the standards are fulfilled for all directions. For the Accidental limit state, the mooring system design fails to meet the criteria given in the standards. Lack of redundancy is shown as this may cause loss of additional anchorlines. </p...|$|E

The soils of the experimental site are on the leeward side of an industrial area and the ground water has become saline due to industrial effluents. A field experiment was initiated to study the influence of gypsum in soil remediation and its influence on the growth and herb yield of lemongrass. Due to application of four tons of gypsum /ha a progressive decrease in the soil pH was observed and soil pH also decreased with advancement in time and it decreased from 7. 73 to 7. 40 at 120 days after planting due to gypsum application. EC increased progressively in all the treatments with time. The increase was less due to gypsum treatments. Similar trend was noticed in case of bicarbonate content of the soil and carbonates were absent in the soil. Gypsum application resulted in increased herb and essential oil yield of lemongrass due to better growth of plants(plant height, number of leaves /plant, number of tillers / <b>clump</b> and <b>weight</b> of plant / clump) and the optimum dose of gypsum required is four tons/ha...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} a {{remarkable}} development in offshore wind energy. From the view of cost efficiency, floating wind turbine becomes more competitive than bottom fixed wind turbine when the water depth comes above 50 m. Semi-submersible floater concepts have been proposed to be deployed in shallow waters (50 m - 100 m) because of its smaller draft compared to other floater types. However, mooring system design is extremely challenging for floating structures in shallow water. There is a transition from linearity to nonlinearity {{in the relationship between}} mooring line tension and offset at the fairlead, which indicates a potential for extremely large mooring line tension during harsh environment when the floater motions have large offset ranges. Moreover, the nonlinear tension increment in shallow water becomes more critical than deep water. In addition, the degree of tightness of mooring system will influence the tension increment trend as well. In present thesis, two mooring system design concepts in 100 m and 50 m water depth (shallow water) have been proposed for the use of 5 -MW-CSC semi-submersible floating wind turbine. Original mooring system design in 200 m water depth is taken as a reference. Initially, preliminary static design has been carried out in SIMA to determine mooring line properties, mooring system configurations and document static performances of mooring line. Afterwards, free decay tests are carried out to calculate the natural periods of the floating wind turbine with mooring system at six degrees of freedom in the three water depths. At last, fully coupled time-domain dynamic analysis in ultimate limit state and fatigue limit state were performed using Simo-Riflex-AeroDyn. Critical responses have been checked to verify if proposed design concepts satisfy design standards. In order to achieve desired mooring line pretension and catenary shape in different water depths, studless chain link has been chosen for 50 m and spiral rope has been selected for 100 m. The corresponding <b>clump</b> <b>weights</b> have been enlarged to 60 tonnes for both cases. Moreover, in order to avoid large nonlinear tension increment, mooring system is designed to be soft on purpose in 50 m. Meanwhile, corresponding natural periods have been examined to be close to the reference model, larger than the periods of most relevant waves. Extreme condition test results indicate that the maximum response of mooring line tension and floater motion occurs when wave is acting aligned with mooring line configuration. Despite, mooring line strengths are sufficient in the light of utilization factor calculations and floater motions have been successfully limited to a reasonable extent. In accordance with operational condition test, accumulated fatigue damage for chain link is larger than spiral rope, even though the stress ranges do not show big difference. This is because highly contact force between chain links produces significant fatigue damage, which does not apply to spiral rope. Furthermore, there is no protection treatment for chain link like plastic sheathing for wire rope. According to spectrum analysis, wave is dominating the responses during extreme condition, while wind contributes most to the responses by influencing low-frequency motion resonant responses in operational condition. The strategy to fight against the nonlinear tension increment in 50 m is to design the mooring system to be relatively soft, which will lead to relatively large floater motion at the same time. Nevertheless, the compromise has achieved great effect: extreme mooring line tensions do not exceed the capacities, even though the tension has increased nonlinearly. Meanwhile the compromised floater motions are under reasonable ranges, without mooring line being totally lifted up. Mooring system design for 100 m shows great performance as well without extreme line tension or large floater motion, which could be regarded as a satisfactory design concept...|$|R
40|$|Clump weights come {{in several}} shapes, {{with a mass}} {{generally}} between 2 to 9 tons [5]. With extensive oshore development in the last decades, vast networks of pipelines are installed on the sea bottom. With both pipeline extension and trawl equipment development in mind, the need for designing pipelines able to resist forces from trawl gear interaction have emerged. A recommended practice for pipeline design, DNV-RP-F 111, was established by DNV. In this master thesis, a brief introduction to trawl gear and recommended practices are given. The main objective of the master thesis is to reproduce model tests numerically and analyse the response from <b>clump</b> <b>weight</b> over-trawling pipelines. Evidence is sought to establish and dierentiate between the importance of various parameters, e. g free span height, pipeline diameter, and pipe end conditions. Several sensitivity studies were performed, with alterations in several parameters, e. g warp line angle alteration and <b>clump</b> <b>weight</b> wobbling. A full scale pipeline model was also analysed, investigating eects of exibility in pipelines and comparing the results with design loads. All analyses are performed in SIMLA, a special purpose non-linear nite element program. A general description of non-linear nite element method {{is included in the}} report. All input values used to model the dierent cases are presented in the master thesis. A good correspondence linking model test results and reproduced simulated models were generally achieved, with some deviations. The deviations are primarily found for low free spans, indicating that this discrepancy can be reduced by further development of the numerical model, e. g by introducing friction to the model. For the full scale pipeline model, design loads are evidently higher than vii viii the pull over force from the corresponding full scale simulation. When comparing design loads with pull over forces from simulated experimental test models, they are more closely related. For small diameter pipelines, a simulation in a full scale model, compared to the rigid model simulations, reduce the pull over forces signicantly. Sensitivity simulations indicate a connection between free span height, pipeline diameter and pull over force. For high free spans, the simulated pull over force increase with decreasing pipe diameter. For low free spans, the simulated pull over force decrease when decreasing the pipe diameter. <b>Clump</b> <b>weight</b> wobbling have in the master thesis been shown to reduce the pull over force. This is seen in the sensitivity analyses performed. Changing <b>clump</b> <b>weight</b> geometry can lead to signicant changes in results. An alteration of the warp line bracket was performed, extending the bracket with 4 cm. The eect was an reduction in the pull over force by approximately 10 %, in all cases. A change in warp line angle was also performed, by increasing and then decreasing the angle with 20 %. The eect was an reduction in pull over force by 10 % and an increase in pull over force by approximately 10 %, respectively. For further details regarding the results, see chapter 5. </p...|$|E
40|$|Recently, {{focus has}} been placed on ocean energy {{resources}} as environmental concerns regarding the exploitation of hydrocarbons are increasing. The enormous energy potential in tidal current power fields has been exploited by installing floating tidal current power turbines. Due to other floating structures operating within a limited area, stationkeeping is needed {{in order to keep the}} motions of the floating structures within permissible limits. In this study, methods for selecting and optimizing the mooring system for floating tidal current power systems in shallow water are investigated. The mooring system provides restoring forces and moments on a floating structure, pulling the structure back toward its equilibrium position. Typically, the mooring lines are segmented in order to optimize the force and displacement characteristics known as the mooring line characteristics.

40|$|Subsea {{pipelines}} {{are likely}} to be exposed to fishing activity, which may results in trawl gear interacting with a pipeline. The interaction is classified into impact, pull-over and a special case called hooking. The trawl load is considered to be an important design load in pipeline design. In the recent developments of the subsea pipelines, the pipe-in-pipe (PIP) system is a solution for high-pressure/high-temperature requirements. Previous research and findings mainly focus on trawl gear interaction with a single pipe wall pipeline. There is limited research on trawl gear-PIP interaction. The main objective of this thesis work is to simulate and investigate the impact and pull-over responses of a pipe-in-pipe system during the interference with an otter trawl board. The numerical study were carried out based on nonlinear finite element (FE) method by means of the computer software SIMLA. Based on the previous models for the single pipe wall pipe, modifications on the models were made to account for PIP. An advanced impact model was enabled to study the impact response of PIP. Later, a detailed <b>clump</b> <b>weight</b> pullover model was modified and studied by using the new contact element (cont 153) in SIMLA. Finally, a detailed trawl board pull-over model (with simplified geometry) was modified with the cont 153 element to study the PIP response under pull-over loads. More details are described as follows. Firstly, a study was carried out to investigate the impact response of a single pipe wall pipe and a PIP system. The impact model was established according to the Recommended Practice DNV-RP-F 111 (RP) by using an advanced impact calculation method. Various pipeline parameters like pipe wall thickness, content density, concrete coating, specified minimum yield strength (SMYS), different trawl gears, and position of centralisers for PIP were considered. The purpose is to check how these parameters influence the impact response. For pull-over analysis, to gain more understanding of the cont 153 element, the <b>clump</b> <b>weight</b> model from Maalø’s work was tested. As a result of this study, a contact stiffness with good contact behaviour was obtained and then used in further study. It is also found that the ii friction coefficient has important influence on the results. The new contact element was then used in a trawl board model with the stiffness defined in the <b>clump</b> <b>weight</b> case. The warp line tension results are compared with previous model test results. The comparisons show that for lower span heights (0. 5 m and 1. 0 m), good agreements were achieved, but noticeable deviations were found for higher span heights (5. 0 m). Finally, the detailed trawl board model was used to investigate the pull-over responses (displacement, bending moment, strain, etc.) of a PIP at low span height (up to 1. 0 m). The pull-over responses from the detailed model were compared with those from RP load. The main finding is that the responses increases as the span height increases, and the responses from the detailed model are in general lower than the RP case. This finding indicates the possibility to further optimise PIP design in the view point of trawl board pull-over loads at low span heights...|$|E

40|$|Summary The {{thesis is}} focused on the {{evaluation}} of the influence of genotype variety, harvest date of potatoes tubers collection and location for the yield of irrigated early potatoes, it´s structure in two terms harvests following fourteen consecutive days. The problem was studied in two localities in early potato growing areas in the framework of ÚKZÚZ field trials. ÚKZÚZ results were obtained after harvest trials. In 2015 I personally participated in the harvest, and in the next months, I evaluated the results separetaly. Experiment in 2007 was conducted in Přerov nad Labem and was focused on the influence of genotype varieties and date the collection on the structure and yield of irrigated early potatoes. Trials in 2015 was conducted in a research station in Přerov nad Labem and in Lednice in Moravia and was focused on the influence of genotype varieties for yield, location and date of harvest in irrigated early potatoes. Based on the results was found demonstrable influence of genotype varieties for yield, in which Suzan variety achieved the highest yield (28, 82 t/ha), on average both two locations and two the collection dates. For all tested varieties was proved that the location has significant influence on the yield. In Přerov nad Labem was achieved on average all varieties of 18, 5 t/ha (109 %) higher yield rate than in Lednice in Moravia. During the examining the influence of harvest date on the yield was found ambiguous the yield growth in the second collection term. The average of all varieties increased yields in theese fourteen days in Lednice of 10, 8 t/ha (93, 9 %), ie. An average of 0, 77 t/ha per day in Přerov nad Labem about 16, 6 t/ha (61, 3 %), it´s an average of 1, 2 t/ha per day. The influence of genotype variety and harvest term on the average weight of potato tubers in one clump, the average number of tubers in one <b>clump</b> and average <b>weight</b> per tuber was proved in all cases. The highest weight of tubers under a single clump reached Monika variety in both collection terms. Variety Magda achieved in both terms of the collection the highest number of tubers. The highest weight of single tuber were measured in the first term oh the collection in the variety Monika and in the second term the collection in the variety Bellarosa. In my opinion, genotype of the variety, location and the harvest term have a significant influence on yield and its structure.
