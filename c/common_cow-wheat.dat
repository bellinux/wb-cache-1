50|$|The ground flora include <b>common</b> <b>cow-wheat,</b> great woodrush, wavy hair-grass, {{foxglove}} {{and slender}} St John's wort. These are all plans which grow in acid conditions.

5000|$|... 40% of {{the reserve}} is densely planted conifer {{plantation}} and 40% is sweet chestnut coppice plantation. The remaining 20% is mixed native deciduous woodland.

50|$|Despite of {{transformation}} of the basic tree vegetation, the same form of undergrowth survived. There occurs: daphne mezereum, red elderberry, hazel, platanthera bifolia, sweet woodruff, herb paris, cranberry, wood sorrel, chickweed wintergreen, <b>Common</b> <b>Cow-wheat</b> and lily of the valley. The parts over 800 m are mainly covered with grasses, purple small-reeds, cranberries, and willow gentian.|$|E
5000|$|The adult bugs can {{be found}} from May to August. They are often found on <b>common</b> <b>cow-wheat</b> (Melampyrum pratense). They feed mostly on members of the Faboideae (Papilionaceae), notably clover (Trifolium), vetches (Vicia), Cytisus scoparius, Sarothamnus scoparius and deervetches (Lotusspecies). A {{recorded}} host plant is also Quercus pedonculata (Fagaceae). [...] These bugs are also predators, mainly on aphids and small fles. The eggs overwinter.|$|E

Typical woodland flowers include bluebell, wood anemone, early-purple orchid, primrose, ramsons (wood garlic), common dog-violet and yellow archangel. Uncommon species are meadow saffron, herb-paris, <b>common</b> <b>cow-wheat,</b> bitter-vetch and violet helleborine. The grassy rides support betony, devil's-bit scabious, saw-wort, common spotted-orchid, greater knapweed, greater butterfly-orchid, cowslip and yellow-rattle. The damper rides supports lesser spearwort, ragged-robin, marsh ragwort, brooklime and various sedges and rushes.|$|E

Habitats include {{calcareous}} grassland with an alkaline soil type, broadleaved woodland, the river and associated riverbank vegetation. Species of plants include <b>Common</b> <b>Cow-wheat,</b> Bitter Vetch, Black Spleenwort, Harebell, Nettle-leaved Bellflower, Bluebell and Viper's Bugloss. A micro-moth, Pammene trauniana, can be found - also dippers, kingfishers, buzzards, otters, bats and damselflies.|$|E
5000|$|A {{number of}} {{distinct}} assemblages of flora are observed at Briarwood Banks. Dominant on lower slopes is wych elm (Ulmus glabra), beneath which are found dog’s mercury (Mercurialis perennis), woodruff (Galium odoratum), wood melick (Melica uniflora), giant bellflower (Campanula latifolia), enchanter’s nightshade (Circaea lutetiana) and wood avens (Geum urbanum). Oak (Quercus petraea) predominates the higher slopes with creeping soft-grass (Holcus mollis), false brome (Brachypodium sylvaticum), wood sorrel (Oxalis acetosella) and broad buckler-fern (Dryopteris dilatata); and on very acid soil beneath oaks, great wood-rush (Luzula sylvatica), bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) and <b>common</b> <b>cow-wheat</b> (Melampyrum pratense) are found.|$|E
50|$|A {{twisting}} trail {{winds through}} 42 acre of natural ancient woodland which {{is attached to}} the Blean, one of the largest areas ofancient woodland in southern England. The woods have been managed by humans on acoppice rotation, harvesting trees between 5-20 years, allowing the stools to regenerate. Parts of the Blean woods are a Site ofSpecial Scientific Interest due to the presence of habitats and species of national importance. Heathy areas provides animportant habitat for the rare heath fritillary butterfly Melitaea athalia, a UK BAP priority species, historically linked with traditional woodland coppicing. The caterpillar’s food plant, <b>common</b> <b>cow-wheat</b> is abundant in the woodland.|$|E
50|$|The wood {{has been}} heavily managed {{in the past}} as wood pasture and as a source for sweet {{chestnut}} (Castanea sativa) coppice. When conditions are open, after the coppice is cut, much of the ground is colonised by <b>common</b> <b>cow-wheat</b> (Melampyrum pratense), which is the food plant of the caterpillar of the rare heath fritillary (Melitaea athalia) butterfly. As the chestnut grows up again and the shade becomes denser, the habitat becomes unsuitable for the flowers and butterflies, therefore {{it is very important that}} regular coppicing is carried out to maintain open areas for our colony of one of Britain's rarest butterflies. The older coppice is, however, valuable for nesting birds such as warblers, and the maturing oak and wild service tree (Sorbus torminalis) stands attract many insects and birds such as woodpeckers, nuthatches and treecreepers.|$|E
