Temporal prediction is a difficult problem faced in most human endeavours. While many specialised time series prediction techniques have been developed, these techniques have limitations. Most are restricted to modeling whole series rather than extracting predictive features and are difficult for domain experts to understand. Symbolic machine learning promises to address these limitations. Symbolic machine learning has been very successful on {{a broad range of}} complex problems. To date, few {{attempts have been made to}} apply symbolic machine learning directly to temporal prediction. This has resulted in systems that cannot explicitly represent temporally ordered examples or handle changing target concepts. Financial prediction is a challenging target domain, which is temporally ordered, has target concepts that <b>change</b> <b>ove</b> [...] ...|$|E

The Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) has provided downscaled RCP (Representative Concentration Pathway) scenarios over Korea with 1 km spa-tial resolution. If there are additional {{climate projection}}s produced by dynamically downscale, the quality of impacts and vulnerability assessments of Korea would be improved with uncer-tainty information. This technical note intends to instruct the methods to downscale the cli-mate projections dynamically from the Community Earth System Model (CESM) to the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model. In particular, here we focus on the instruction to utilize CAM 2 WRF, a sub-program to link output of CESM to initial and boundary condition of WRF at Linux platform. We also provide the example of the dynamically downscaled results over Korean Peninsula with 50 km spatial resolution for August, 2020.

PREFACE Between the early 1980 s and the mid- 1990 s, the situation facing renters in Canada changed. The demography of Canada's population changed, the economy went through boom, bust, and much restructuring, and changes in spending by governments on social programs forced some renters (not to mention homeowners) to make difficult choices. This report assembles compara-ble data on the change in condition of renter households between the early 1980 s and mid 1990 s.

Abstract. This paper analyzes the prospects for cumulative theory development in organization theory. Organization theory generally takes organizations (business corporations, non-profits, hospitals, universities, and so on) as discrete and meaningful units of analysis. The revolution in {{information and communication technologies}} {{over the past two decades}} has made comprehensive time-series data on millions of organizations widely available to scholars around the world. Yet it is not obvious that organization theory has become more precise, more general, or more accurate as a result. I argue that this is due to three difficulties that additional data cannot fully resolve: (a) researchers lack experimental control, limiting their ability to draw causal inferences, and are largely inattentive to the standards for valid quasi-experimental design; (b) organizations are more appropriately construed as tools rather than as natural objects susceptible to “laws; ” and (c) the regularities underlying organizational dynamics <b>change</b> <b>ove...</b>|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} beliefs and framing {{strategies}} of interest groups {{during a period of}} policy change and the factors explaining policy change. We develop propositions to explore questions concerning policy change primarily from the advocacy coalition framework as well as from other theorie. The propositions are tested by examining the promulgation of a Colorado regulation requiring the disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing. Using coded data of documents published by organizations involved in the rulemaking process, we find divergence between industry and environmental groups on their beliefs concerning hydraulic fracturing, as well as their portraying themselves and each other as heroes, victims, and villains, but some convergence on their more specific beliefs concerning disclosure of chemicals. Interviews point to the importance of policy entrepreneurs, timing, a negotiated agreement, and learning for explaining policy change. The findings provide both theoretical and methodological insights into how and why policy changes.

40|$|Spatial {{variations}} in sea surface temperature (SST) and rainfall changes over the tropics are investigated based on ensemble simulations {{for the first}} half of the 21 st century under the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission scenario A 1 B with coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation models at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) and National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). Despite a GHG increase that is nearly uniform in space, pronounced patterns emerge in both SST and precipitation. Regional differences in SST warming can be as large as the tropical mean warming. Specifically, the tropical Pacific warming features a conspicuous maximum along the equator and a minimum in the southeast subtropics. The former is associated with westerly wind anomalies while the latter is linked to intensified southeast trade winds, suggestive of wind-evaporation-SST feedback. There is a tendency for a greater warming in the northern than southern subtropics in accordance with asymmetries in trade wind changes. Over the equatorial Indian Ocean, surface wind anomalies are easterly, the thermocline shoals and the warming is reduced in the east, indicative of Bjerknes feedback. In the midlatitudes, ocean circulation changes generate narrow banded structures in SST warming. The warming is negatively correlated with wind speed <b>change</b> <b>ove...</b>|$|E
40|$|All {{opinions}} {{are those of}} the authors and should not be attributed to the Joint Committee on Recent research on United States levels and trends in income inequality vary substantially in how they measure income. Piketty and Saez (2003) examine market income of tax units based on IRS tax return data, Denavas-Watt, Proctor, and Smith (2012) and most CPS-based research uses pretax, post-transfer cash income of households, while the CBO (2012) uses both data sets and focuses on household size-adjusted comprehensive income of persons, including taxable realized capital gains. This paper provides a crosswalk of income growth across these common income measures using a unified data set. It then uses a more consistent Haig-Simons income definition approach to comprehensive income by incorporating yearly accrued capital gains to measure yearly changes in wealth rather than focusing solely on the realized taxable capital gains that appear in IRS tax return data. Doing so dramatically reduces the observed growth in income inequality across the distribution, but most especially the rise in top-end income since 1989. 1 Much of the debate over the distributional fairness of fiscal policies is discussed in the context of the current distribution of income in the United States and how it has <b>changed</b> <b>ove...</b>|$|R

40|$|Repeated {{measures}} data {{generated from}} longitudinal designs {{are often used}} when studying correlates of individual change. Such studies pose several challenges: (1) The measurement scale must be invariant over time; (2) covariates of interest are often multilevel (e. g., measured at the person and neighborhood level); (3) some item-level missing data can be expected. To cope with these challenges, we propose a repeated measures, multilevel Rasch model with random effects. Under assumptions of conditional independence, additivity, and measurement invariance over time, the approach enables the investigator to calibrate the items and persons on an interval scale, incorporate covariates at each level, and accommodate data missing at random. Using data on 8 items tapping violent crime from 2, 842 adolescents ages 9 - 18 nested within 196 census tracts in Chicago, we illustrate how to test key assumptions, how to adjust the model in light of diagnostic analyses, and how to interpret parameter estimates. 3 Longitudinal data enable us to repeatedly measure the status of individuals over a specified time period.
