2500|$|To {{understand}} the mosquito mouthparts, {{it is helpful}} to draw a comparison with an insect that chews food, such as a dragonfly. A dragonfly has two mandibles, which are used for chewing, and two maxillae, which are used to hold the food in place as it is chewed. The labium forms the floor of the dragonfly's mouth, the labrum forms the top, while the hypopharynx is inside the mouth and is used in swallowing. Conceptually, then, the mosquito's proboscis is an adaptation of the mouthparts that occur in other insects. The labium still lies beneath the other mouthparts, but also enfolds them, and it has been extended into a proboscis. The maxillae still [...] "grip" [...] the [...] "food" [...] while the mandibles [...] "bite" [...] it. The top of the mouth, the labrum, has developed into a channeled blade the length of the proboscis, with a cross-section like an inverted [...] "U". Finally, the hypopharynx has extended into a tube that can deliver saliva {{at the end of the}} proboscis. Its upper surface is somewhat flattened so, when pressed against it, the labrum forms a <b>closed</b> <b>tube</b> for conveying blood from the victim.|$|E

The {{infusible}} {{condition of}} the silver at the temperature used, and the length and ramifying character of its crystals, render the above experiment difficult to perform, and uncertain in its results. I therefore wrought with chloride of lead, using a green-glass tube, formed as in fig. 72. A weighed platina wire was fused {{into the bottom of}} a small tube, as before described (789.). The tube was then bent to an angle, at about half an inch distance from the closed end; and the part between the angle and the extremity being softened, was forced upward, as in the figure, so as to form a bridge, or rather separation, producing two little depressions or basins a, b, within the tube. This arrangement was suspended by a platina wire, as before, so that the heat of a spirit-lamp could be applied to it, such inclination being given to it as would allow all air to escape during the fusion of the chloride of lead. A positive electrode was then provided, by bending up the end of a platina wire into a knot, and fusing about twenty grains of metallic lead on to it, in a small <b>closed</b> <b>tube</b> of glass, which was afterwards broken away. Being so furnished, the wire with its lead was weighed, and the weight recorded.|$|E

60|$|Mouth.--This {{is seated}} {{in exactly the}} same {{position}} as in the mature Cirripede, on a slight prominence, fronting the thoracic limbs, and so far within the carapace, that it was obviously quite unfitted for the seizure of prey; and it was equally obvious, that the limbs were natatory, and incapable of carrying food to the mouth. This enigma was at once explained by an examination of the mouth, which was found to be in a rudimentary condition and absolutely closed, so {{that there would be no}} use in prey being seized. Underneath this slightly prominent and closed mouth, I found all the masticatory organs of a Cirripede, in an immature condition. The state of the mouth will be at once understood, if we suppose very fluid matter to be poured over the protuberant mouth of a Cirripede, so as to run a little way down, in the shape of internal crests, between the different parts, and in the shape of a short, shrivelled, certainly <b>closed</b> <b>tube,</b> a little way (.008 of an inch in L. australis) down the oesophagus. Hence, the larva in this, its last stage, cannot eat; it may be called a locomotive Pupa;[11] its whole organisation is apparently adapted for the one great end of finding a proper site for its attachment and final metamorphosis.|$|E
60|$|Alimentary Canal.--The {{oesophagus}} is {{of considerable}} length: it is formed of strong, transparent, much folded membrane, continuous with the outer integuments, and moulted with them: it {{is surrounded by}} corium, and as already stated, by numerous muscles: at its lower end it expands into a bell, with the edges reflexed, and sometimes sinuous: this bell lies within the stomach, and keeps the upper broad end expanded. According to the less or greater distance of the mouth from the adductor muscle, the oesophagus runs in {{a more or less}} parallel course to the abdominal surface between the first and succeeding pairs of cirri, and enters the stomach more or less obliquely. In Ibla alone, it passes exteriorly to, and over the adductor scutorum muscle. The stomach lies in a much curved, almost doubled course; it is often a little constricted where most bent; it is broadest at the upper end, and here, in Lepas and Conchoderma, there are some deep branching cæca; in the latter of these two genera, the whole surface is, in addition, pitted in transverse lines. The stomach is coated by small, opaque, pulpy, slightly arborescent glands, believed to be hepatic; these are arranged in longitudinal lines, in all the genera, except in Alepas, in which they are transverse and reticulated: the whole stomach is thus coated. There is, also, a coating of excessively delicate, longitudinal and transverse muscles without striæ. The rectum varies in length, extending inwards from the anus to between the bases of the second and fifth pair of cirri: it is narrow, and formed of much folded transparent membrane, resembling the oesophagus, continuous with the outer integuments, with which it is periodically moulted. The anus is a small longitudinal slit, in the triangular piece of membrane representing the abdomen, let in between the last thoracic tergal arches, as already mentioned under the head of the Metamorphoses; it lies almost between the caudal appendages, and opens on the dorsal surface. Within the stomach, there can generally be plainly seen, in accordance with the period of digestion when the specimen was taken, a thin, yet strong, perfectly transparent epithelial membrane, not exhibiting under the highest power of the microscope any structure: it enters the branching cæca, and extends {{from the edge of the}} bell of the oesophagus to the commencement of the closed rectum, and consequently terminates in a point: it consists of chitine, like the outer integuments of the animal, and by placing the whole body in caustic potash, I have dissolved the outer coats of the stomach, and seen the bag open at its upper end, perfectly preserved, floating in the middle of the body, and full of the debris of the food. In most of the specimens which I have examined, preserved in spirits of wine, this epithelial lining was some little way distant and separate from the coats of the stomach; and hence was thought by M. Martin St. Ange to be a distinct organ, like the <b>closed</b> <b>tube</b> in certain Annelids. Occasionally, I have seen one imperfect epithelial bag or tube within another and later-formed one. Digestion seems to go on at the same rate throughout the whole length of the stomach; if there be any difference, the least digested portions lie in the lower and narrower part. The prey, consisting generally of crustacea, infusoria, minute spiral univalves, and often of the larvæ of Cirripedes, is not triturated: when the nutritious juices have been absorbed, the rejectamenta are cast out through the anus, all kept together in the epithelial bag, which is excluded like a model of the whole stomach, with the exception of that part coated by the bell of the oesophagus. I have sometimes thought that the bag was formed so strong, for the sake of thus carrying out the excrement entire, so as not to befoul the sack. I believe Lepas can throw up food by its oesophagus; at least, I found in one case, many half-digested small Crustaceans in the sack, and others of the same kind in the stomach.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>closed</b> <b>tube</b> (also {{called a}} [...] "stopped pipe" [...] in the organ) is a tube which is closed at one end.

A <b>closed</b> <b>tube</b> resonates at the same fundamental frequency as an open tube twice its length, with a wavelength equal to four times its length. In a <b>closed</b> <b>tube,</b> a displacement node, or point of no vibration, always appears at the closed end and if the tube is resonating, it will have an antinode, or point greatest vibration at the Phi point (length × 0.618) near the open end.|$|E

40|$|It {{is unknown}} whether {{components}} present in heart failure (HF) patients' serum provide an angiogenic stimulus. We {{sought to determine}} whether serum from HF patients affects angiogenesis and its major modulator, the Notch pathway, in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). In cells treated with serum from healthy subjects or from patients at different HF stage we determined: (1) Sprouting angiogenesis, by measuring cells network (<b>closed</b> <b>tubes)</b> in collagen gel. (2) Protein levels of Notch receptors 1, 2, 4, and ligands Jagged 1, Delta-like 4. We found a higher number of <b>closed</b> <b>tubes</b> in HUVECs treated with advanced HF patients serum in comparison with cells treated with serum from mild HF patients or controls. Furthermore, {{as indicated by the}} reduction of the active form of Notch 4 (N 4 IC) and of Jagged 1, advanced HF patients serum inhibited Notch signalling in HUVECs in comparison with mild HF patients' serum and controls. The circulating levels of NT-proBNP (N-terminal of the pro-hormone brain natriuretic peptide), a marker for the detection and evalutation of HF, were positively correlated with the number of <b>closed</b> <b>tubes</b> (r= 0. 485) and negatively with Notch 4 IC and Jagged 1 levels in sera-treated cells (r=- 0. 526 and r=- 0. 604, respectively). In conclusion, we found that sera from advanced HF patients promote sprouting angiogenesis and dysregulate Notch signaling in HUVECs. Our study provides in vitro evidence of an angiogenic stimulus arising during HF progression and suggests a role for the Notch pathway in it. J. Cell. Physiol. 9999 : 1 - 11, 2016...|$|R
