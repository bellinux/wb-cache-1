40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to investigate the spread pattern of Korean legal <b>certification</b> <b>systems</b> and their impact on industry performance. Methods: It first analyzes the life cycle of legal <b>certification</b> <b>systems</b> and classifies them into four categories based on the spread patterns in a chronological view. A survey study is then conducted to find out the impact of legal <b>certification</b> <b>systems</b> on financial performance. Both the legal mandatory <b>certification</b> <b>systems</b> and the legal voluntary <b>certification</b> <b>systems</b> are included in the survey. Results: Four spread patterns of legal <b>certification</b> <b>systems</b> are sustainable growth, stagnation after growth, decrease after growth, and repetition of growth and declination. 56 % of 293 certified corporations responded positively about the financial impact of their <b>certification</b> <b>systems.</b> Conclusion: The policy makers can utilize {{the results of this study}} in designing additional <b>certification</b> <b>systems</b> as well as promoting the current legal <b>certification</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R

These principles include adherence to ILO agreements such as those banning child and slave labour, guaranteeing a safe workplace {{and the right to}} unionise, adherence to the United Nations charter of human rights, a fair price that covers the cost of production and facilitates social development, and protection and conservation of the environment. The Fairtrade <b>certification</b> <b>system</b> also attempts to promote long-term business relationships between buyers and sellers, crop prefinancing, and greater transparency throughout the supply chain and more.|$|E
25|$|The Fairtrade <b>certification</b> <b>system</b> {{covers a}} growing range of products, {{including}} bananas, honey, coffee, oranges, Cocoa bean, cocoa, cotton, dried and {{fresh fruits and}} vegetables, juices, nuts and oil seeds, quinoa, rice, spices, sugar, tea, and wine.

The International Fairtrade Certification Mark was launched in 2002 by FLO, and replaced twelve Marks used by various Fairtrade labelling initiatives.

For a product to carry either the International Fairtrade Certification Mark or the Fair Trade Certified Mark, it must come from FLO-CERT inspected and certified producer organizations. The crops must be grown and harvested {{in accordance with the}} international Fair trade standards set by FLO International.

25|$|In {{an effort}} to {{complement}} the Fairtrade product <b>certification</b> <b>system</b> and allow most notably handcraft producers to also sell their products outside worldshops, the World Fair Trade Organization (WFTO) launched in 2004 a new Mark to identify fair trade organizations (as opposed to products {{in the case of}} FLO International and Fairtrade). Called the FTO Mark, it allows consumers to recognize registered Fair Trade Organizations worldwide and seeks to guarantee that standards are being implemented regarding working conditions, wages, child labour, and the environment. The FTO Mark offers Fair Trade Organizations (including handcrafts producers) definable standards which inform consumers, business partners, governments, and donors of the applicable trading standard. in 2014 the Fairtrade Program Mark was introduced to create new sales opportunities, initially for cocoa, sugar and cotton producers. It has the same round logo alongside the word FAIRTRADE in black and underneath the program title in turquoise.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} for Chinese {{plugs and sockets}} (excluding Hong Kong and Macau) is set out in GB2099.1‐2008 and GB1002‐2008. As part of China's commitment for entry into the WTO, the new CPCS (Compulsory Product <b>Certification</b> <b>System)</b> has been introduced, and compliant Chinese plugs have been awarded the CCC Mark by this system. The plug is three wire, earthed, rated at 10A, 250V and used for Class 1 applications; a slightly larger 16A version also exists. The nominal pin dimensions of the 10A version are: 1.5mm thick by 6.4mm wide, the line & neutral are 18mm long, and the earth is 21mm long. It {{is similar to the}} Australian plug. Many 3 pin sockets in China include a physical lockout preventing access to the active and neutral terminals unless an earth pin (which is slightly longer than the other 2 pins) is entered first. China also uses American/Japanese NEMA 1‐15 sockets and plugs for Class-II appliances. The voltage at a Chinese socket of any type is 220V.|$|E
25|$|In response, the Legislative Council {{proposed}} {{to restrict the}} right of such persons by adding another requirement {{that one of the}} child's parents must have been a permanent resident {{at the time of the}} child's birth. On 10 July 1997, the Legislative Council passed the Immigration Amendment (No. 3) Ordinance, which introduced a <b>certification</b> <b>system.</b> Under this system, any person who claimed to have the right of abode in Hong Kong could prove their status only by showing a certificate of right of abode issued by the Director of Immigration of Hong Kong. This certificate could be applied for only in mainland China, and it would not be issued until the application obtained a one-way permit to cross the border to Hong Kong from the Chinese Public Security Bureau. The amendment was made retroactive to 1 July 1997, which meant that even children who had already arrived in Hong Kong with previously sufficient legal documentation would have been stripped of their right for lack of a certificate that did not yet exist when they entered Hong Kong. The retroactivity of the amendment triggered a number of test cases in court, which eventually came before the Court of Final Appeal as Ng Ka Ling v. Director of Immigration and Chan Kam Nga v. Director of Immigration.|$|E

40|$|Forest {{certification}} {{is perceived}} as a new instrument to promote sustainable forest management (SFM). It developed widely after the Earth Summit in Rio in 1992 with the primary goal of achieving SFM. Expectations held for the <b>certification</b> <b>systems</b> included decreasing forest land degradation, the establishment of sound forest management policy, the promotion of public participation in management, a price premium for certified wood products and improved access to the 'green market'. The majority of <b>certification</b> <b>systems</b> aim to maintain or improve the ecological, social and economic functions of forest ecosystems. Certification is supposed to guarantee that forests are well-managed. Forest certification is categorised by function and geographical location. There are currently two types of functions 'management-system-based' and 'performance-based'. Managementsystem-based systems assess a company's management processes. On the other hand, performance-based systems evaluate a company's operations in the managed land. Currently, many certifications are management-system-based. From a geographic perspective, there is international certification and national certification. Many national certification schemes are members of international certification schemes. Certification can also apply to wood products that use wood material certified against the standard when all chain of production processes are evaluated, with respect to the environmental and social impacts. A single certification logo can be issued to the producer. Forest certification schemes can assess any type of forest against criteria and indicators (C&I) to assess if they have been implemented against standards at the national level. At least nine international initiatives and agreements for C&I forest <b>certification</b> <b>systems</b> have been developed. Six recognized forest <b>certification</b> <b>systems</b> are reviewed within. None of these <b>certification</b> <b>systems</b> have exactly the same C&I thresholds. Differences between schemes largely arise from the different expectations of the primary stakeholders of the schemes. Certification bodies are voluntary, independent, and non-government. An increasing number of certifications may bring confusion and complexity as various standards develop. The <b>certification</b> <b>systems</b> are not clear to the general public because targets and effects are not usually well defined. Different types of forests can be assessed at specific levels of the standard. However, dissimilar forests approved by the same certification can equally claim that their forest management practice is environmentally sound. Yet, different criteria, conditions, and systems for environmental sustainability are found in each standard. Nevertheless, all certification bodies seem to be developing towards socially and economically acceptable systems. Standards have been adapting {{to the needs of the}} various stakeholders. This can make the different <b>certification</b> <b>systems</b> converge. Measures for ecological sustainability in <b>certification</b> <b>systems</b> seem to be less well-developed, in general, than measures to ensure social and economic sustainability...|$|R
