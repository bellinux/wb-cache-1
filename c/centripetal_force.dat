The difference in angular speeds (or equivalently, in angular momenta) causes {{a difference in the}} <b>centripetal</b> <b>force</b> requirement; to offset this, the radial force must be altered with an inverse-cube force.|$|E

The method applies equally to the case where the force is centrifugal.|$|E
5|$|The {{configuration}} of the magnetodisk's field is maintained by the azimuthal ring current (not an analog of Earth's ring current), which flows with rotation through the equatorial plasma sheet. The Lorentz force resulting from the interaction of this current with the planetary magnetic field creates a <b>centripetal</b> <b>force,</b> which keeps the co-rotating plasma from escaping the planet. The total ring current in the equatorial current sheet is estimated at 90–160million amperes.|$|E

5|$|Fourth, camber thrust {{contributes}} to the <b>centripetal</b> <b>force</b> necessary to cause the bike to deviate from a straight path, along with cornering force due to the slip angle, and can be the largest contributor. Camber thrust {{contributes to}} the ability of bikes to negotiate a turn with the same radius as automobiles but with a smaller steering angle. When a bike is steered and leaned in the same direction, the camber angle of the front tire is greater than that of the rear and so can generate more camber thrust, all else being equal.|$|E
5|$|When an {{electron}} is moving through a magnetic field, it {{is subject to}} the Lorentz force that acts perpendicularly to the plane defined by the magnetic field and the electron velocity. This <b>centripetal</b> <b>force</b> causes the electron to follow a helical trajectory through the field at a radius called the gyroradius. The acceleration from this curving motion induces the electron to radiate energy in the form of synchrotron radiation. The energy emission in turn causes a recoil of the electron, known as the Abraham–Lorentz–Dirac Force, which creates a friction that slows the electron. This force is caused by a back-reaction of the electron's own field upon itself.|$|E
5|$|In 1679, Newton {{returned}} to his work on (celestial) mechanics by considering gravitation {{and its effect on}} the orbits of planets with reference to Kepler's laws of planetary motion. This followed stimulation by a brief exchange of letters in 1679–80 with Hooke, who had been appointed to manage the Royal Society's correspondence, and who opened a correspondence intended to elicit contributions from Newton to Royal Society transactions. Newton's reawakening interest in astronomical matters received further stimulus by the appearance of a comet in the winter of 1680–1681, on which he corresponded with John Flamsteed. After the exchanges with Hooke, Newton worked out proof that the elliptical form of planetary orbits would result from a <b>centripetal</b> <b>force</b> inversely proportional to the square of the radius vector (see Newton's law of universal gravitation– History and De motu corporum in gyrum). Newton communicated his results to Edmond Halley and to the Royal Society in De motu corporum in gyrum, a tract written on about nine sheets which was copied into the Royal Society's Register Book in December 1684. This tract contained the nucleus that Newton developed and expanded to form the Principia.|$|E

5|$|From this work, he {{concluded}} that the lens of any refracting telescope would suffer from the dispersion of light into colours (chromatic aberration). As a proof of the concept, he constructed a telescope using reflective mirrors instead of lenses as the objective to bypass that problem. Building the design, the first known functional reflecting telescope, today known as a Newtonian telescope, involved solving the problem of a suitable mirror material and shaping technique. Newton ground his own mirrors out of a custom composition of highly reflective speculum metal, using Newton's rings to judge {{the quality of the}} optics for his telescopes. In late 1668 he was able to produce this first reflecting telescope. It was about eight inches long and it gave a clearer and larger image. In 1671, the Royal Society asked for a demonstration of his reflecting telescope. Their interest encouraged him to publish his notes, Of Colours, which he later expanded into the work Opticks. When Robert Hooke criticised some of Newton's ideas, Newton was so offended that he withdrew from public debate. Newton and Hooke had brief exchanges in 1679–80, when Hooke, appointed to manage the Royal Society's correspondence, opened up a correspondence intended to elicit contributions from Newton to Royal Society transactions, which had the effect of stimulating Newton to work out a proof that the elliptical form of planetary orbits would result from a <b>centripetal</b> <b>force</b> inversely proportional to the square of the radius vector (see Newton's law of universal gravitation– History and De motu corporum in gyrum).

The centrifugal and <b>centripetal</b> <b>forces</b> resulting from the rotation are always present and need to be included into considerations. Using the previously derived metric for a centrally gravitating body the effect of the centrifugal and <b>centripetal</b> <b>forces</b> can be included.

25|$|Apart {{from any}} {{acceleration}} that might {{occur in the}} direction of the path, the lower panel of the image above indicates the forces on the ball. There are two forces; one is the force of gravity vertically downward through the center of mass of the ball mg, where m is the mass of the ball and g is the gravitational acceleration; the second is the upward normal force exerted by the road at a right angle to the road surface man. The <b>centripetal</b> <b>force</b> demanded by the curved motion is also shown above. This <b>centripetal</b> <b>force</b> is not a third force applied to the ball, but rather must be provided by the net force on the ball resulting from vector addition of the normal force and the force of gravity. The resultant or net force on the ball found by vector addition of the normal force exerted by the road and vertical force due to gravity must equal the <b>centripetal</b> <b>force</b> dictated by the need to travel a circular path.

25|$|Newton {{examined}} {{this problem}} himself using rotating spheres, {{as shown in}} Figure 2 and Figure 3. He pointed out that if the spheres are not rotating, {{the tension in the}} tying string is measured as zero in every frame of reference. If the spheres only appear to rotate (that is, we are watching stationary spheres from a rotating frame), the zero tension in the string is accounted for by observing that the <b>centripetal</b> <b>force</b> is supplied by the centrifugal and Coriolis forces in combination, so no tension is needed. If the spheres really are rotating, the tension observed is exactly the <b>centripetal</b> <b>force</b> required by the circular motion. Thus, measurement of the tension in the string identifies the inertial frame: it is the one where the tension in the string provides exactly the <b>centripetal</b> <b>force</b> demanded by the motion as it is observed in that frame, and not a different value. That is, the inertial frame is the one where the fictitious forces vanish.|$|E
