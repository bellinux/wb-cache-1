50|$|The 1990s {{began the}} decade in a recession, which {{resulted}} in weak auto sales and operating losses. In addition, the Invasion of Kuwait by Iraq caused a temporary jump in oil prices. However, the automakers recovered fairly quickly. In the mid-1990s, light truck sales (which included Sport utility vehicles, Pickup trucks and Minivans) began to rise sharply. Due to the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards differentiating between passenger cars and light trucks, the automakers were able to sell large and heavy vehicles without fear of the <b>CAFE</b> <b>fines.</b> Low oil prices also gave incentives for consumers to buy these gas-guzzling vehicles. The American automakers sold combined, and even separately, millions of pickup trucks and body-on-frame SUVs during this period. Imports such as the Toyota 4Runner, Land Cruiser, Tacoma, and Nissan Pathfinder and Frontier were also popular during this time period.|$|R

5000|$|Cafés {{may have}} a {{standardized}} shot (size and length), such as [...] "triple ristretto", only varying the number of shots in espresso-based drinks such as lattes, but not changing the extraction - changing between a double and a triple requires changing the filter basket size, while changing between ristretto, normale, and lungo may require changing the grind, which is less easily accommodated in a busy <b>café,</b> as <b>fine</b> tweaking of the grind is a central aspect to consistent quality espresso-making.|$|R

2500|$|In the 1950s, {{the area}} was {{repopulated}} and reinvigorated by artists and intellectuals attracted to its location between the historic center and Chapultepec Park. This period saw the opening of trendy bars, clubs, restaurants, cafes, bookstores, and art galleries which gave the area a bohemian feel. By the 1960s, politicians such as Adolfo López Mateos, Adolfo Ruiz Cortines, and Miguel Alemán, as well as painters such as José Luis Cuevas and writers such as Carlos Fuentes and Carlos Monsivais, lived, worked and visited the clubs here such as <b>Café</b> Kineret. <b>Fine</b> restaurants were established such as Focolare in 1953, La Gondola [...] in 1958 and Passy, also in 1958. These three don't exist anymore. Clubs and restaurants were exclusive, with dress codes. However, there were also several clubs known for chorus girls. One of these was the Can-can, {{on the corner of}} Hamburgo and Genova Streets. This mix of bohemian and propriety prompted Cuevas to comment that the area [...] "Es demasiado ingenua para ser roja, pero demasiado frívola para ser blanca, por eso es precisamente rosa (is too naive to be red, but too frivolous to be white, for this reason it is precisely pink)". This is the origin of the area’s current name.|$|R
50|$|In 1825 the Austrian-born confectionist Johann Georg Kranzler (1795-1866) began {{business}} in a small pastry shop (Konditorei) on Unter den Linden No. 25, {{at the corner of}} Friedrichstraße (present-day site of The Westin Grand). Refurbished as a coffeehouse according to plans designed by the architect Friedrich August Stüler, the original Café Kranzler was opened in 1834. Including a sun terrace, outside tables on the pavement, an ice-cream parlour and a smokers' room, it swiftly gained the reputation of being one of the city's <b>finest</b> <b>cafés,</b> also after the rivalling Café Bauer opened vis-à-vis in 1877. Café Kranzler was particularly known for its New Year's Eve celebrations that even were broadcast on national radio. In May 1944 the parent house in Mitte was destroyed during the Bombing of Berlin in World War II.|$|R
40|$|Background: Very limited {{research}} has been conducted on career progression and development of Chefs working at different levels within restaurants of Ireland. Objective: This research intends to explore the perceptions of training, development and motivation in Chefs’ career progression. It also tries to explore the organisational support on continuous professional development they encounter during their career. Design: Applying the Interpretivism paradigm, this research reports the findings from eight unstructured interviews. Settings: Small casual dining, <b>café</b> and <b>fine</b> dining restaurants of Cork, Limerick and Dublin city of Ireland. Participants: Five Chefs from casual dining restaurants including one retired Chef, one Chef from the Café, one Chef from the fine dining restaurant and one General Manager of the casual dining restaurants. Participants were recruited from the authors’ professional link and prior work relations. Methods: The raw data collected from eight interviews was analysed generating the themes and sub-themes. Results: The findings of this research suggest that the communication plays a vital part in order to gain organisational support to upgrade the talent pool through the process of training and development. Conclusion: The findings of this study concluded that the small restaurants are not providing enough opportunities on training for the Chefs to develop professionally. They are bound to work anti-social and long working hours with enormous work load and disappointing communication gap. Majority of the interviewees pinpointed these factors in leading to the high staff turnover rate of the restaurant sector...|$|R
50|$|The APT Group {{invested}} {{in the building of}} luxury river boats in Europe in 2005 with Jimmy Murphy of Brennan Tours and cruising expert, Rudi Schreiner. Through a co-ownership of AmaWaterways and buoyed by the exponential global popularity of river cruising, by 2009 APT had a fleet of ships and had pioneered full-size French balconies within 75% of all cabins on board the AmaWaterways Europe river cruise fleet and subsequently the all-weather twin balcony. APT and AmaWaterways expanded into Russia with the major reconstruction and renovation of the MS AmaKatarina. APT and AmaWaterways, in partnership with Indochina Sails, built a ship in Vietnam on the Mekong River, the MS AmaLotus, in 2012. Amawaterways built a second ship, the AmaDara in 2015.
