40|$|A vibration-based testing {{methodology}} {{has been developed}} that will assess fatigue behavior of the metallic material of construction for the Advanced Stirling Convertor displacer (planar) spring component. To minimize the testing duration, the test setup is designed for base-excitation of a multiplespecimen arrangement, driven in a high-frequency resonant mode; this allows completion of fatigue testing in an accelerated period. A high performance electro-dynamic exciter (shaker) is used to generate harmonic oscillation of cantilever beam specimens, which are clasped on the shaker armature with specially-designed <b>clamp</b> <b>fixtures.</b> The shaker operates in closed-loop control with dynamic specimen response feedback provided by a scanning laser vibrometer. A test coordinator function synchronizes the shaker controller and the laser vibrometer to complete the closed-loop scheme. The test coordinator also monitors structural health of the test specimens throughout the test period, recognizing any change in specimen dynamic behavior. As {{this may be due}} to fatigue crack initiation, the test coordinator terminates test progression and then acquires test data in an orderly manner. Design of the specimen and fixture geometry was completed by finite element analysis such that peak stress does not occur at the <b>clamping</b> <b>fixture</b> attachment points. Experimental stress evaluation was conducted to verify the specimen stress predictions.

40|$|During total hip arthroplasty, {{surgeons}} {{insert a}} prosthetic femur head onto the femur bone, {{as well as}} inserting a prosthetic acetabular cup so both prosthetic components can cope with one other. Surgeons also insert pins onto the hip and femur bones to track the movement of those bones via infrared arrays, using computer navigated software, in order to mitigate surgical error. In the US {{there is more than}} 310, 000 total hip replacement surgeries conducted per year, most of which are over the age of 45. Hip replacement surgery is needed for individuals who have osteoarthritis, avascular necrosis, and/or trauma. The average stay after total hip replacement for patients aged 45 and over is 4 days. The average cost of the surgery is about $ 31, 000. Decreasing recovery time in the hospital by just one day can decrease the cost between 10 - 20 %. The greatest risks of this procedure would be misalignment of the hip bones or impairment of the femur bones. The objective is to design a surgical <b>clamp</b> <b>fixture</b> which will replace the current pins being used. Instead of penetrating a hole of 10 mm in diameter onto the hip, the design will clamp onto the iliac crest horizontally, along with the attached infrared arrays and provide proper fixation with no more than 0. 5 mm of deviation from the clamping axis. By performing specific testing protocols the resulting outcome will be more beneficial than the current pins. The <b>clamp</b> <b>fixture</b> will be applied to synthetic material and then subjected to surgical forces, including application of excess forces along all axis’, torsional forces and rotational forces to ensure stability and rigidity.

40|$|In {{manufacturing}} industries, process {{variation is}} known to be a major source of poor quality. As such, process monitoring and diagnosis is critical towards continuous quality improvement. This becomes more challenging when involving two or more correlated variables (multivariate). The traditional statistical process control (SPC) charting schemes are known to be effective in monitoring aspect but nevertheless, they are lack of diagnosis. In recent years, the control chart pattern recognition (CCPR) schemes have been developed for solving this issue. Design consideration involved the modeling of manufacturing process data to select input representation based on raw data. Proper design of artificial neural network (ANN) model is important in developing an effective CCPR scheme. In this research, the multivariate model ANN pattern recognizer, namely Statistical Features – ANN was investigated in monitoring and diagnosing process variation in manufacturing of hard disc drive component.

5000|$|If {{the program}} is wrong, {{there is a high}} {{probability}} that the machine will crash, or ram the tool into the part under high power. This can be costly, especially in newer machining centers. It is possible to intersperse the program with optional stops (M01 code) that let the program run piecemeal for testing purposes. The optional stops remain in the program but are skipped during normal running. Fortunately, most CAD/CAM software ships with CNC simulators that display the movement of the tool as the program executes. Nowadays the surrounding objects (chuck, <b>clamps,</b> <b>fixture,</b> tailstock, and more) are included in the 3D models, and the simulation is much like an entire video game or virtual reality environment, making unexpected crashes much less likely. Many modern CNC machines also allow programmers to execute the program in a simulation mode and observe the operating parameters of the machine at a particular execution point. This enables programmers to discover semantic errors (as opposed to syntax errors) before losing material or tools to an incorrect program.

40|$|Characterizing the {{relationship}} between material structure and mechanical function is important in engineering applications. Modeling this structure-function relationship in living tissue provides the groundwork to later determine stimuli-structure-function relationships {{in order to enhance}} healing by developing effective treatment strategies. However, there are few models that accurately predict the mechanical behavior of soft tissue based on structure. A challenge in developing these models is that mechanical testing is required to validate model accuracy. Many mechanical test systems are designed for more traditional materials and specialized <b>clamp</b> <b>fixtures</b> need to be created for testing soft tissue due to small size and variable geometry of the testing samples. In this undergraduate research project, a mechanical clamp system was developed to meet the design requirements of testing soft tissue. The clamps apply loads up to 10 N in a tension configuration and 7 N in a shear configuration. The clamp stiffness is 4000 N/mm in tension and 150 N/mm in shear. Electrical integration between the clamps and the test system provides load data transmission to the controlling computer with a load signal noise under 0. 02 N.

The objective {{of this study was to}} understand the impact-damage resistance of these novel composites, so that they can be designed optimally for impact-resistant aircraft applications. The FML panels were made up of aluminum alloy 7475 T 761 and unidirectional S 2 glass/epoxy oriented in a cross-ply configuration.

In particular, delaminations occurred in the back face of the aluminum-alloy sheet and its adjacent fiber reinforced epoxy layer and in between adjacent fiber-reinforced epoxy layer.

40|$|Fibre-reinforced {{composite}} materials are increasingly used in airframes and {{the tendency is}} to built the main fuselage in Carbon Fibre Reinforced Polymer (CFRP). In general CFRP has a wide application in light-weight structural members, because it {{is characterized by a}} high strength-to-weight and stiffness-to-weight ratio, but it is vulnerable to damage caused by transverse loads, such as those arising from indentation and impact loading. One of the main reasons that inhibits more widespread applications of {{composite materials}} is their lack of resistance to low velocity and low energy impact damage[1 - 3], particularly in the case of thermoset matrix like epoxy, while the probability of such loadings occurring during the manufacture, service or maintenance of composite structures is very high [4] The research dealt with the correlation between damage and tensile residual strength in quasi-isotropic carbon fibre reinforced epoxy resin laminate loaded at the centre. Load was applied by means of a servo hydraulic machine and it was supposed to simulate a low velocity impact. The Acoustic Emission (AE) technique was used to detect damage progression. Tensile resistance after indentation was investigated and correlated with acoustic emissions parameters. This was been done for different lamination sequences on specimens cut from the damaged plates and for two different damage levels, one corresponding to the first load drop in the load-displacement curve[5] and to the complete perforation of the plate. Composite plates square 250 x 250 mm graphite/epoxy laminates were studied; their thickness was 1. 6 mm.
