During the in vitro experiments a maximum valve leakage of 6 % during ejection and 21 % during aspiration was found. The maximum flow resistance coefficient (K) was 4. The animal experiments demonstrated that the PUCA-II could be positioned within a few minutes into the left ventricle without X-ray guidance and without using a vascular graft.

40|$|Determinants of early, {{late and}} event-free {{survival}} of <b>combined</b> <b>valve</b> and {{coronary artery bypass}} graft (CABG) surgery were studied in 420 patients using multivariate analysis. It was found that the risk of hospital death increases 5 times when the preoperative NYHA class was > or = IV, 3 times when left ventricular (LV) function is significantly impaired and is double when mitral regurgitation is present. The survival probability of hospital survivors was 91 % (87. 3 - 94. 5 %) at 5 years. Late mortality was determined by advanced preoperative NYHA class (> or = IV) and the presence of mitral regurgitation. The event-free survival probability of hospital survivors, i. e. total events including death, valve-related complications, ischemic complications and recurrent NYHA class > or = IV, was 73. 0 % (66. 7 - 79. 5 %) at 5 years. Postoperative events were determined by the presence of preoperative NYHA class > or = IV, impaired ventricular function, mitral regurgitation and non-sinus rhythm.

40|$|AbstractBackground:Gender-related {{differences}} in {{morbidity and mortality}} are well described for coronary artery bypass grafting but are not well understood for <b>combined</b> <b>valve</b> and bypass surgery. MethodsWe reviewed retrospectively the morbidity and mortality of 1570 consecutive patients who underwent <b>combined</b> <b>valve</b> and bypass procedures at the Toronto General Hospital between January 1990 and October 2000. ResultsThere were 1073 men (68 %) and 497 women (32 %). The mean ages (± 1 SD) {{of women and men}} were 69 ± 9 and 68 ± 9 years, respectively (P =. 02). Of the 1570 total patients, 973 patients (62 %) underwent aortic valve and coronary bypass surgery, 481 patients (31 %) had mitral valve and coronary bypass operations, and 116 (7 %) patients had double or triple valve and coronary bypass operations. Preoperative hypertension (P =. 002), diabetes (P =. 001), and atrial fibrillation (P =. 001) were seen more frequently in women. Body surface area was significantly lower in women (P =. 0001). At presentation, more women were in congestive heart failure (69 % vs 58 %, P =. 001) and in New York Heart Association functional class III or IV (25 % vs 19 %, P =. 001). Although {{there was no difference in}} the number of women with three or more diseased vessels (32 % vs 38 %), only 35 % of women received three or more grafts compared with 44 % of men (P =. 001). The use of left internal thoracic grafts, although uncommon in the whole study population (36 %), was less common in women than in men (26 % vs 41 %, P =. 001). Multivariable logistic analyses for morbidity and mortality showed female gender to be an independent risk factor. Mitral valve replacement, age, left ventricular dysfunction, New York Heart Association classes III and IV, and association of tricuspid valve disease, diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, and preoperative renal failure were found to be independent risk factors for mortality. ConclusionFemale gender is an independent risk factor for combined morbidity and mortality during and after <b>combined</b> <b>valve</b> and coronary bypass surgery. As with isolated coronary artery bypass grafting, women undergoing combined procedures have more premorbid conditions, are more often in heart failure, had an equal incidence of triple vessel disease but received fewer grafts than men, and, therefore, were more frequently incompletely revascularized...|$|E

Some studies conclude that off-pump coronary artery bypass (OPCABG) may decrease the incidence of AF, whereas the combination of CABG with heart valve replacement may result in more frequent postoperative atrial fibrillation. The aim of our study was to compare the early postoperative AF incidence rate during ICU stay in three groups of patients: after CABG, OPCABG, and CABG <b>combined</b> with <b>valve</b> replacement. During the period from January 2009 till January 2012. Clinical profile of 650 patients were included in a prospective study, factors having potential influence on postoperative AF did not show any {{significant differences between the}} groups. The presence of arrhythmia history was the reason of excluding 42 patients from the statistical analysis. 525 cases after conventional CABG, 96 after OPCABG, and 29 after CABG <b>combined</b> with <b>valve</b> surgery were analyzed. Results: Atrial fibrillation occurred during the postoperative ICU stay in 9. 8 % of patients after CABG, in 10. 2 % after OPCABG, and in 21 % after CABG <b>combined</b> with <b>valve</b> replacement. There {{was no significant difference between}} CABG and OPCABG groups (P= 0. 965).

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study was to review the outcome of dialysis-dependent {{patients}} undergoing cardiac surgery. We retrospectively reviewed 36 dialysis-dependent patients with a mean age of 63 ± 9. 4 years who underwent cardiac operations. Surgery included coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in 27 patients (75 %), valve surgery in 2 (5. 5 %), combined CABG plus valve surgery in 5 (13. 8 %), <b>combined</b> <b>valve</b> surgery and MAZE procedure in 1 patient, <b>combined</b> <b>valve</b> surgery, CABG and MAZE procedure in 1 patient, major aortic surgery in 1 patient, suture of injured right ventricle in 1 patient and extirpation of infected right atrial thrombus in 1 patient. In-hospital mortality rate was 11. 1 %. All the deaths occurred in patients who underwent urgent procedure. Two of the deaths occurred in patients who underwent cardiac surgery procedure on pump (ascending aorta replacement and infected thrombus removing), one death occurred in a patient who underwent suture of injured right ventricle and another one death occurred in patient who underwent the conventional myocardial revascularization. The survival was 77. 8 % at 1 year. Generally suggested predictors of increased late mortality are heart failure, urgent/emergent surgery, the complexity of the surgical procedures (valve surgery, combined CABG, valve and major aortic surgery) and postoperative low cardiac output syndrome. In dialysis-dependent patients, CABG has an acceptable risk. Results in patients affected by valve lesions associated or not with coronary artery disease are improved by an early referral to surgery, before the onset of symptoms of heart failure...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND. Factors {{determining}} {{the outcome of}} operative correction of valvular abnormalities combined with coronary artery bypass grafting are still incompletely defined. METHODS. Determinants of early and late (more than 90 days) deaths and event-free survival were studied for <b>combined</b> <b>valve</b> operations and coronary artery bypass grafting in 741 patients using multivariate analysis. RESULTS. Ninety-day survival probability was 89 % (95 % confidence interval, 87 % to 92 %). Preoperative risk factors for early death were age, female sex, renal failure, New York Heart Association class IV or V, and mitral insufficiency. The operative risk factor was the duration of aortic cross-clamping. Five- and 10 -year survival probabilities were 74 % (95 % confidence interval, 71 % to 78 %) and 43 % (95 % confidence interval, 36 % to 50 %), respectively. Preoperative risk factors for late death were age, preoperative renal failure, New York Heart Association class IV or V, vessel disease, and nonsinus rhythm. Five- and 10 -year event-free survival probabilities were 57 % (95 % confidence interval, 53 % to 61 %) and 23 % (95 % confidence interval, 17 % to 28 %), respectively. Preoperative risk factors for non-event-free survival were age, female sex, reduced left ventricular function, mitral regurgitation, and pacemaker rhythm. CONCLUSION.

40|$|Background: venous {{bypass graft}} flow {{measurement}} {{is a useful}} tool to detect intra-operatively surgical technical anastomotic failures or poor run-off. We tested a simple device (VGF- 7) that allows measuring of outflow resistance during the episode of aortic cross-clamping when corrective action can easily be performed. Methods: In patients undergoing <b>combined</b> <b>valve</b> and coronary artery bypass surgery, venous bypass graft flow was measured with the VGF- 7 during aortic cross-clamping on a cardioplegic heart, and during reperfusion on the beating heart. These measurements were compared with graft flows measured with ultrasonic transit-time volume flow measurements after weaning from extracorporeal circulation. Results: Significant logarithmic relations exist between VGF- 7 measured flow and ultrasonic transit-time volume flow. As expected mean flow decreases after removal of the aortic cross clamp and after the heart start beating again.

40|$|Multivalvular disease (MVD) {{is common}} among {{patients}} with valvular disease, {{and has a}} complex pathophysiology dependent on the specific combination of valve lesions. Diagnosis is challenging because several echocardiographic methods commonly used {{for the assessment of}} stenosis or regurgitation have been validated only in patients with single-valve disease.

METHODS: The Pexelizumab for Reduction in Myocardial Infarction and Mortality in Coronary Artery Bypass Graft surgery trial, a phase III prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, enrolled 3099 patients at 205 centers. The primary end point was the composite of death, myocardial infarction, or both at postoperative day 30 in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting without valve surgery. Postoperative myocardial infarction {{was defined as a}} creatine kinase MB fraction value of 100 ng/mL or greater, Q-wave myocardial infarction with a creatine kinase MB fraction value of 70 ng/mL or greater, or new Q-wave evidence of myocardial infarction by postoperative day 30. Because patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting with a valve procedure {{were not included in the}} primary population, separate analysis of death and myocardial infarction was conducted in 218 patients undergoing <b>combined</b> aortic <b>valve</b> replacement and coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. RESULTS: Of the 353 patients randomized to any valve procedure, 106 (61 %) underwent <b>combined</b> aortic <b>valve</b> replacement and coronary artery bypass grafting in the pexelizumab treatment group compared with 112 (63 %) patients in the placebo group. Coronary artery bypass grafting was performed with 1 or more internal thoracic artery grafts in 139 (64 %) patients and with 1 or more saphenous vein grafts in 179 (82 %) patients. There were 4 (3. 8 %) deaths in the pexelizumab group versus 11 (9. 9 %) in the placebo group by postoperative day 30 and 6 (5. 7 %) deaths in the active group versus 16 (14. 4 %) in the placebo group by postoperative day 180 (P =. 107 and P =. 043, respectively, Fisher exact test).

Methods: From November 1, 2004, to October 1, 2009, 7957 patients underwent cardiac surgery supported by cardiopulmonary bypass and were not transfused. The relationship between nadir hematocrit and morbidity, markers of end-organ function, and survival was studied using generalized propensity score analysis. Factors associated with nadir hematocrit were identified by linear regression. Results: Median nadir hematocrit was 30 % (25 th to 75 th percentile, 27 %- 33 %).

One- and 5 -year actuarial survival rates were, respec-tively, 85 % 6 5 % and 58 % 6 10 % for the CABG group, 78 % 6 7 % and 53 % 6 12 % for the valve group, and 69 % 6 9 % and 63 % 6 10 % for the <b>combined</b> CABG and <b>valve</b> group. Sixty-one percent of patients in the CABG group, 40 % in the valve group, and 38 % in the <b>combined</b> CABG and <b>valve</b> group were in New York Heart Association class I or II postoperatively at a mean follow-up time of 2. 1 6 2. 4 years. Similarly, 91 %, 85 %, and 80 %, respec-tively, thought that they had an improved quality of life and were satisfied with their functional status. Conclusions. Cardiac reoperations can be performed successfully in most octogenarians, although with an increased risk, particularly in the <b>combined</b> CABG and <b>valve</b> group. Long-term survival is acceptable with im-proved quality of life and functional status. However, it is possible that these results could be improved in this high-risk group of patients with earlier referral and surgical intervention, for the effective use of health care resources...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY A scintigraphic {{technique}} using indium-ill labelled platelets {{to detect}} left atrial thrombi {{was used in}} 28 patients, 14 of whom had mitral valve disease and 14 <b>combined</b> <b>valve</b> disease. Imaging was performed in the anterior, right anterior oblique (450), and left lateral views {{on the day of}} injection and thereafter at one or two day intervals for a maximum of four days. When scin-tiphotos obtained in two or three views 72 or 96 hours after the platelet injection showed "hot spot areas " within the left atrial pool and indium- 11 activity in these areas did not decrease with time they were interpreted as positive for thrombi. Of 28 patients, seven had positive platelet images by this criterion; of these, three underwent surgery and were found to have left atrial thrombi. One patient died, and a thrombus was found at necropsy. The remaining 21 patients had normal scintiphotos; of these, seven had no thrombi at operation and one had false negative images. The diagnostic accuracy of platelet scintigraphy by this criterion of positivity in the 12 patients in whom surgical or postmortem confirmation of thrombi could be obtained was 92 %. These results indicate that this technique is a promising method for detecting active left atrial thrombi. Left atrial thrombi occur in patients with mitral valve disease and may lead to catastrophic embolic events...|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveThis {{study was}} {{undertaken}} to delineate outcomes {{and to assess}} risk factors for in-hospital mortality among Chinese patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. MethodsFrom 2007 to 2008, a total of 9838 consecutive adult patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting {{were enrolled in the}} Chinese Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting Registry, which included 43 centers from 17 province-level regions in China. This registry collected information on 67 preoperative factors and 30 operative factors believed to influence in-hospital mortality. The relationship between risk factors and in-hospital mortality was evaluated by univariate and logistic regression analyses. ResultsOverall in-hospital mortality was 2. 5 %. Eleven risk factors were found to be significant predictors for outcome: age (continuous), body mass index (continuous), left ventricular ejection fraction (continuous), preoperative New York Heart Association functional class III or IV, chronic renal failure, extracardiac arteriopathy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, preoperative atrial fibrillation or flutter (within 2 weeks), preoperative critical state, other than elective surgery, and <b>combined</b> <b>valve</b> procedure. Calibration with the Hosmer-Lemeshow test was satisfactory (P = . 35), and the discrimination power was good (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0. 81; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 79 – 0. 84). ConclusionsThe risk profiles and in-hospital mortality of Chinese patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting were determined from data in the most up-to-date multi-institutional database. Eleven variables were demonstrated to be independent risk factors for in-hospital death after coronary artery bypass grafting...|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveTo {{discover}} {{the effects of}} the lowest hematocrit during cardiopulmonary bypass on end-organ function and mortality in patients who did not receive red blood cell transfusion and to identify predictors of nadir hematocrit. MethodsFrom November 1, 2004, to October 1, 2009, 7957 patients underwent cardiac surgery supported by cardiopulmonary bypass and were not transfused. The relationship between nadir hematocrit and morbidity, markers of end-organ function, and survival was studied using generalized propensity score analysis. Factors associated with nadir hematocrit were identified by linear regression. ResultsMedian nadir hematocrit was 30 % (25 th to 75 th percentile, 27 %– 33 %). Lower nadir hematocrit was associated with higher maximum intraoperative lactic acid (intrasubject correlation, − 0. 44). After risk adjustment, nadir hematocrit was associated with worse renal function (lower estimated glomerular filtration rate; P = . 012), more myocardial injury (higher troponin level; P = . 004), longer postoperative ventilator support (P < . 001), longer hospital stay (P < . 001), and higher mortality (P = . 042). Female gender, older age, lower body mass index, higher New York Heart Association class, and <b>combined</b> <b>valve</b> procedure and coronary artery bypass were associated with lower nadir hematocrit; however, the strongest correlate was preoperative hematocrit (correlation coefficient, 0. 74). ConclusionsAlthough red blood cell transfusion has associated morbidity risk, there must be a tradeoff between adverse effects of low hematocrit during cardiac surgery and those of transfusion. The strong association of nadir hematocrit with preoperative hematocrit suggests the need for investigation and optimization before elective cardiac surgery...|$|E
40|$|Pulmonary {{hypertension}} (PH) due to left {{heart disease}} (LHD) {{is the most}} common form of pulmonary hypertension. We know from previous studies that PH in patients with LHD is associated with poor prognosis. Regarding incidence and prevalence of PH associated with mitral valve disease we have different data depending of study population. The purpose of this study was to evaluate effects of pulmonary hypertension on short and long term survival following mitral valve surgery at KFSH&RC. Methods: Retrospective study of all patients who have undergone mitral valve (MV) surgery since January 2010 until December 2011 with follow up to December 2013. Pulmonary artery pressure was assessed by Doppler echocardiography pre- and postoperatively. The impact of pulmonary hypertension (PASp ⩾  50  mm Hg) on early (30  days) and late outcomes and duration of hospital stay was analyzed. Results: During the period of 2  years 233 patients (63 % female) with mean age 45  ±  14 (range 19 – 83  years) underwent MV surgery. Mean follow up was 2. 8  ±  0. 97  years. Main indication for MV surgery was rheumatic valve disease (83 %). Isolated MV surgery has been performed in 130 patients and <b>combine</b> <b>valve</b> surgery in 103 patients. Mortality was significantly higher after <b>combine</b> <b>valve</b> surgery (p =  0. 028). Primary valve surgery has been done in 162 cases and re-do surgery in 71 cases. Interesting, there were no difference in survival between these two groups (p =  0. 88). There were no significant difference in survival after MV replacement (n =  195) and MV repair (n =  38; p =  0. 18). Pulmonary hypertension was present in 115 (51 %) patients. Duration of hospitalization stay after valve surgery was almost twofold longer in patients with PH (24  ±  48 vs. 13  ±  14  days, p =  0. 02). Patients died within 30 days had a significantly higher PASp (64  ±  30 vs. 48  ±  17  mmHg; p =  0. 003). We found a clear tendency to higher mortality in patients with pulmonary hypertension. Conclusions: Pulmonary hypertension clearly affects early and late survival after MV surgery. Better survival and shorter duration of hospital stay in patients without PH supports early admission for MV surgery before occurrence of PH...|$|R
