40|$|In {{this paper}} we present the DeSiX design space {{exploration}} methodology for software component-based systems on multiprocessor architectures. The proposed technique adopts multi-dimensional quality attribute {{analysis in the}} early design phases {{and is based on}} (1) various types of models for software components, processing nodes, memories and bus links, (2) scenarios of system critical execution, allowing the designer to focus only on relevant static and dynamic system configurations, (3) simulation of tasks automatically reconstructed for each scenario and (4) Pareto curves for identification of optimal architecture alternatives. The feasibility of our methodology is shown by a detailed case study of a car radio navigation system, where te starting point is five candidate system architectures, representing different <b>cost</b> versus <b>performance</b> <b>sensitivity</b> versus reliability tradeoffs...|$|R

The scope and time frame of information gathering is generally responsive to the boundaries set by the National Research council (NRC), but includes a broad range of interests and programs which cover hot gas cleanup through the year 2010. As the status of hot gas cleanup is continually changing, additional current data and information are being obtained for this effort from this 1996 METC Contractors` Review Meeting {{as well as from the}} 1996 Pittsburgh Coal Conference, and the University of Karlsruhe Symposium.

40|$|At {{the core}} of high {{throughput}} DNA sequencing platforms lies a bio-physical surface process that results in a random geometry of clusters of homogenous short DNA fragments typically hundreds of base pairs long - bridge amplification. The statistical properties of this random process and length of the fragments are critical as they affect the {{information that can be}} subsequently extracted, i. e., density of successfully inferred DNA fragment reads. The ensemble of overlapping DNA fragment reads are then used to computationally reconstruct the much longer target genome sequence, e. g, ranging from hundreds of thousands to billions of base pairs. The success of the reconstruction in turn depends on having a sufficiently large ensemble of DNA fragments that are sufficiently long. In this paper using stochastic geometry we model and optimize the end-to-end process linking and partially controlling the statistics of the physical processes {{to the success of the}} computational step. This provides, for the first time, a framework capturing salient features of such sequencing platforms that can be used to study <b>cost,</b> <b>performance</b> or <b>sensitivity</b> of the sequencing process...|$|R

The purpose of this economic analysis was to assess the cost-effectiveness of MSP compared with an established opportunistic screening strategy (OS) in Switzerland, to identify the major factors influencing the economic outcome. MethodsUsing cancer registries and clinical data, a Markov-based decision model was designed to compare MSP with OS in the Swiss female population, considering the main screening-specific performance parameters. ResultsThe discounted incremental life expectancy amounted to 0. 022 life-years gained in favor of MSP when screening started at age 40 years and decreased to 0. 008 years at the age of 70 years (number needed to screen to avoid one death over 10 years ranged from 10, 000 to 2439 women depending on the baseline age). The total discounted life-time cost for screening, treatment at the baseline age of 40 years amounted in MSP to $ 4366 (OS: $ 2802) and decreased with the baseline age of 70 years to $ 2412 (OS: $ 1446). The discounted incremental cost-effectiveness ratio comparing MSP versus OS ranged from $ 73, 018 (age 40 years) to $ 118, 193 (age 70 years) per life-year gained. Testing all model variables confirmed that both incidence and mortality of breast cancer play the most important role in the health economic outcome, whereas <b>cost</b> and <b>performances</b> (<b>sensitivity,</b> specificity) of screening had a minor impact on the efficiency. ConclusionThis analysis, performed under conservative assumptions, supports that MSP in Switzerland enables a relevant reduction of breast cancer mortality, at moderate additional cost, compared with OS...|$|R
40|$|To gain {{maritime}} {{dominance in}} the littorals in the 2020 timeframe, the US Navy must have capabilities to assure access to the littorals and to enable Sea Basing and Sea Strike. These capabilities necessitate innovative and radical concepts for systems, tactics, support, and force structures. Focusing on only system-of systems (SoS) concepts, we consider a system of only manned platforms, a system of primarily unmanned platforms, and a balanced hybrid system of manned and unmanned platforms. Based on a <b>cost,</b> risk-to-personnel, <b>performance,</b> and <b>sensitivity</b> analysis, using a Shallow Water Acoustics Toolset (Excel/SWAT), the Autonomous Littoral Warfare Systems Evaluator Discrete Event Simulation (ALWSE), and a Force/Theater Extend Model, we select a balanced hybrid system of manned and unmanned platforms that uses distributed communications network architecture and a decentralized command and control structure. Our work demonstrates that unmanned platforms, while cost effective and capable of reducing risk to personnel, complement but cannot replace manned platforms. Manned platforms will still be required for command and control, crucial operational decision making, and logistics support to unmanned vehicles. Finally, we suggest further research to provide additional insight into {{the solution to the}} problem of maritime {{dominance in the}} littorals...|$|R

40|$|We {{explore the}} impact of stock pay and stock {{holdings}} on the pay to <b>performance</b> <b>sensitivity</b> in Denmark. Our research is motivated {{by the fact that}} most non-UK/US studies ignore stock based pay and stock holdings when measuring the pay to <b>performance</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> Further, most studies that explore the pay to performance relation apply the Black and Scholes approach assuming that the executive is both risk neutral due to hedge possibilities and well diversified. However, as pointed by Hall and Murphy (2002) executives are neither risk neutral nor well diversified. We adopt the certainty equivalence approach developed by Lambert et al (1991) to demonstrate that in a setting where executives are risk averse and undiversified there is a gap between the cost of granting stock options and the value, which executives receive from the same stock option program. Our findings indicate that the Danish level of pay is lower than in the UK and the US but more in line with the pay in other Scandinavian countries. Further, our results show that stock options are less frequently used to compensate Danish executives. On the other hand, stock ownership seems to be a more popular way to align the interests of the management and the shareholders than stock options. Furthermore, including stock holdings affect our four pay to <b>performance</b> <b>sensitivity</b> measures significantly. We also demonstrate that the pay to <b>performance</b> <b>sensitivity</b> is considerably lower than indicated by the Black and Scholes approach. Finally, the pay to <b>performance</b> <b>sensitivity</b> is on average smaller in Denmark than in the US.

Multi-objective synthesis is based on the need of flight mission and subjectivity inclination of decision-maker. The decision-maker, however, has illegibility for understanding the requirements of multiple objectives and the subjectivity inclination. It is important to develop a reasonable <b>cost</b> <b>performance</b> index for describing the illegibility of the decision-maker in multi-objective path planning. Based on Voronoi diagram method for the path planning, this paper studies the synthesis method of the multi-objective <b>cost</b> <b>performance</b> index. According to the application of the <b>cost</b> <b>performance</b> index to the path planning based on Voronoi diagram method, this paper analyzes the <b>cost</b> <b>performance</b> index which has been referred to at present. The analysis shows the insufficiency of the <b>cost</b> <b>performance</b> index at present, i. e., it is difficult to synthesize sub-objective functions because of the great disparity of the sub-objective functions. Thus, a new approach is developed to optimize the <b>cost</b> <b>performance</b> index with the multi-objective fuzzy optimization strategy, and an improved performance index is established, which could coordinate the weight conflict of the sub-objective functions. Finally, the experimental result shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach...|$|R
