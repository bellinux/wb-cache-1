The molecular simulations include constructing atomic structure of OCP <b>crystallographic</b> <b>planes</b> and representative segments of HSA and LSZ {{with three different}} initiate orientations respect to OCP planes. The simulation reveals the dynamic process of the protein absorption. The absorption behavior of proteins is quantified by the interaction energy between proteins and OCP planes and the strain energy of proteins in absorption.
