40|$|Radio AGN {{feedback}} in X-ray <b>cool</b> <b>cores</b> {{has been}} proposed as a crucial ingredient {{in the evolution of}} baryonic structures. However, it has long been known that strong radio AGN also exist in "noncool core" clusters, which brings up the question whether an X-ray <b>cool</b> <b>core</b> is always required for radio feedback. In this work, we present a systematic analysis of BCGs and strong radio AGN in 152 groups and clusters from the Chandra archive. All 69 BCGs with radio AGN more luminous than 2 x 10 ^ 23 W Hz^- 1 at 1. 4 GHz are found to have X-ray <b>cool</b> <b>cores.</b> The BCG <b>cool</b> <b>cores</b> can be divided into two classes, the large-cool-core (LCC) class and the corona class. Small coronae, easily overlooked at z> 0. 1, can trigger strong heating episodes in groups and clusters, long before large <b>cool</b> <b>cores</b> are formed. Strong radio outbursts triggered by coronae may destroy embryonic large <b>cool</b> <b>cores</b> and thus provide another mechanism to prevent formation of large <b>cool</b> <b>cores.</b> However, it is unclear whether coronae are decoupled from the radio feedback cycles as they have to be largely immune to strong radio outbursts. Our sample study also shows the absence of groups with a luminous <b>cool</b> <b>core</b> while hosting a strong radio AGN, which is not observed in clusters. This points to a greater impact of radio heating on low-mass systems than clusters. As examples of the corona class, we also present detailed analyses of a BCG corona associated with a strong radio AGN (ESO 137 - 006 in A 3627) and one of the faintest coronae known (NGC 4709 in the Centaurus cluster).

40|$|Timing {{observations}} of rapidly rotating neutron stars revealed {{a great number}} of glitches, observed both from canonical radio pulsars and magnetars. Among them, 76 glitches have shown exponential relaxation(s) with characteristic decay times ranging from several days to a few months, followed by a more gradual recovery. Glitches displaying exponential relaxation with single or multiple decay time constants are analysed in terms of a model based on the interaction of the vortex lines with the toroidal arrangement of flux tubes in the outer core of the neutron star. Model results agree with the observed timescales in general. Thus, the glitch phenomenon can be used to deduce valuable information about neutron star structure, in particular on the interior magnetic field configuration which is unaccessible from surface observations. One immediate conclusion is that the magnetar glitch data are best explained with a much <b>cooler</b> <b>core</b> and therefore require that direct Urca type fast cooling mechanisms should be effective for magnetars.

40|$|Gas lenses work on {{the basis}} that {{aerodynamic}} media can be used to generate a graded refractive index distribution which can be used to focus a laser beam. An example is a spinning pipe gas lens (SPGL). It is a steel pipe whose walls are heated to a preselected temperature and then rotated along the axis to any desired speed to generate a <b>cooler</b> <b>core</b> of incoming air. A laser beam propagating through these lenses is focussed in space. However, experimental observation has shown that distortions are generated in the beam. We provide a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of the lens and experimental results of the Zernike aberrations measured using a Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor which show that the aerodynamic medium in the lens have a deleterious effect on laser beam quality (M 2). The effect on the SPGL is that the beam deterioration increases with rotation speed and temperature though the worst M 2 measured at speed 20 Hz and temperature 155 °C was ∼ 3. 5 which is fairly good. © 2010 SPIE.

X-ray emitting hot gas imaged by both the Chandra and XMM-Newton shows a globally relaxed spatial distribution, supporting the idea that fossil groups are old galaxy systems with no recent mergers. However, the diffuse X-ray emission shows signs of asymmetries {{in the core of}} the system. With a mean gas temperature of ~ 4. 0 keV and total gravitational mass of 3. 1 x 10 ^ 14 solar mass, within the virial radius, this is better described as a fossil galaxy cluster rather than a fossil group. The temperature profile shows no sign of a significant <b>cooler</b> <b>core</b> despite a cooling time dropping to 5 Gyr within the resolved core. We find a mass concentration parameter c_ 200 ~ 11 which is relatively high for a cluster of this mass, indicative of an early formation epoch. Using the spectroscopically identified cluster members we present the galaxy luminosity function for this fossil system. We measure the velocity dispersion of the galaxies to be ~ 700 km/s based on 18 confirmed members. The dynamical mass is nearly twice the total gravitational mass derived from the X-ray analysis. The measured R-band mass-to-light ratio, within the virial radius, is ~ 440 M/L (solar) which is not unusual for clusters of galaxies.

The X-ray emission of NGC 507 is extended at least out to 1000 sec (458 kpc at a distance of 94. 5 Mpc). The radial profile of X-ray surface brightness goes as Sigma(sub x) is approximately r(exp - 1. 8) outside the core region. The radial profile is a function of energy such that the softer X-rays have a smaller core radius and a flatter slope. Spectral analysis reveals that the emission temperature, with an average of 1 keV, peaks at an intermediate radius of 2 - 3 min and falls toward the center (possibly decreases outward as well). The absorption column density is consistent with the Galactic line-of-sight value. The X-ray emission of NGC 499 is extended to 300 sec and suggests a similarly <b>cooler</b> <b>core.</b> The cooler cores of NGC 507 and NGC 499 are strong evidence of the presence of cooling flows in these galaxies. Assuming hydrostatic equilibrium outside the cooling radius, the estimated mass-to-light ratio of NGC 507 is 97 +/- 16 within 458 kpc, indicative of the presence of a heavy halo. Similarly, the mass-to-light ratio of NGC 499 is 89 +/- 14 within 137 kpc. Near the edge of the X-ray-emitting region of NGC 507 we detect 19 soft, unresolved sources. These sources do not have optical counterparts and are significantly in excess of the expected number of background serendipitous sources. We speculate that they may represent cooling clumps in the halo of NGC 507.

40|$|Increasing the {{economic}} competitiveness {{of nuclear energy}} is vital to its future. Improving {{the economic}}s of BWRs is the main goal of this work, focusing on designing cores with higher power density, to reduce the BWR capital cost. Generally, the core power density in BWRs {{is limited by the}} thermal Critical Power of its assemblies, below which heat removal can be accomplished with low fuel and cladding temperatures. The present study investigates both increases in the heat transfer area between the fuel and coolant and changes in operating parameters to achieve higher power levels while meeting the appropriate thermal as well as materials and neutronic constraints. A scoping study is conducted under the constraints of using fuel with cylindrical geometry, traditional materials and enrichments below 5 % to enhance its licensability. The reactor vessel diameter is limited to the largest proposed thus far. The BWR with High power Density (BWR-HD) is found to have a power level of 5000 MWth, equivalent to 26 % uprated ABWR, resulting into 20 % cheaper O&M and Capital costs. This is achieved by utilizing the same number of assemblies, but with wider 16 x 1 6 assemblies and 50 % shorter active fuel than that of the ABWR. The fuel rod diameter and pitch are reduced to just over 45 % of the ABWR values. Traditional cruciform form control rods are used, which restricts the assembly span to less than 1. 2 times the current GE 14 design due to limitation on shutdown margin. Thus, it is possible to increase the power density and specific power by 65 %, while maintaining the nominal ABWR Minimum Critical Power Ratio (MCPR) margin. The optimum core pressure {{is the same as the}} current 7. 1 MPa. The core exit quality is increased to 19 % from the ABWR nominal exit quality of 15 %. The pin linear heat generation rate is 20 % lower, and the core pressure drop and mass of uranium are 30 % lower. The BWR-HD's fuel, modelled with FRAPCON 3. 4, showed similar performance to the ABWR pin design. The fuel cycle is only 12 month long, but on the per kWhr, the new design operates with 14 % lower fuel cycle front-end costs and similar total fuel cycle cost to the 18 month ABWR fuel cycle. The plant systems outside the vessel are assumed to be the same as the ABWR- 1 I design, utilizing a combination of active and passive safety systems. Safety analyses applied a void reactivity coefficient calculated by SIMULATE- 3 for an equilibrium cycle core that showed a 15 % less negative coefficient for the BWR-HD compared to the ABWR. The feedwater temperature was kept the same for the BWR-HD and ABWR which resulted in 4 °K <b>cooler</b> <b>core</b> inlet temperature for the BWR-HD given that its feedwater makes up a larger fraction of total core flow. The stability analysis using the STAB and S 3 K codes showed satisfactory results for the hot channel, coupled regional out-of-phase and coupled core-wide in-phase modes. A RELAP 5 model of the ABWR system was constructed and applied to six transients for the BWR-HD and ABWR. The AMCPRs during all the transients were found to be equal or less for the new design and the core remained covered for both. The lower void coefficient along with smaller core volume proved to be advantages for the simulated transients. Helical Cruciform Fuel (HCF) rods were proposed in prior MIT studies to enhance the fuel surface to volume ratio. In this work, higher fidelity models (e. g. CFD instead of subchannel methods for the hydraulic behaviour) are used to investigate the resolution needed for accurate assessment of the HCF design. For neutronics, conserving the fuel area of cylindrical rods results in a different reactivity level with a lower void coefficient for the HCF design. In single-phase flow, for which experimental results existed, the friction factor is found to be sensitive to HCF geometry and cannot be calculated using current empirical models. A new approach for analysis of flow crisis conditions for HCF rods in the context of Departure from Nucleate Boiling (DNB) and dryout using the two phase interface tracking method was proposed and initial results are presented. It is shown that the twist of the HCF rods promotes detachment of a vapour bubble along the elbows which indicates no possibility for an early DNB for the HCF rods and in fact a potential for a higher DNB heat flux. Under annular flow conditions, it was found that the twist suppressed the liquid film thickness on the HCF rods, at the locations of the highest heat flux, which increases the possibility of reaching early dryout. It was also shown that modeling the 3 D heat and stress distribution in the HCF rods is necessary for accurate steady state and transient analyses. The safety analysis of the 20 % uprated HCF design in the context of a BWR/ 4 RPV showed satisfactory AMCHFR performance only if CR is estimated by the EPRI- 1 correlation. by Koroush Shirvan.

However, it has long been known that strong radio AGNs also exist in "noncool core" clusters, which brings up the question whether an X-ray <b>cool</b> <b>core</b> is always required for radio feedback. We present a systematic analysis of 152 groups and clusters to show that every BCG with a strong radio AGN has an X-ray <b>cool</b> <b>core.</b> Those strong radio AGNs {{in the center of the}} "noncool core" systems identified before are in fact associated with small X-ray <b>cool</b> <b>cores</b> with typical radii of < 5 kpc (we call them coronae). Small coronae are most likely of ISM origin and they carry enough fuel to power radio AGNs. Our results suggest that the traditional <b>cool</b> core/noncool <b>core</b> dichotomy is too simple. A better alternative is the <b>cool</b> <b>core</b> distribution function with the enclosed X-ray luminosity. Other implications of our results are also discussed, including a warning on the simple extrapolation of the density profile to derive Bondi accretion rate.

40|$|Sunyaev–Zel'dovich (SZ) surveys find massive {{clusters}} of galaxies {{by measuring the}} inverse Compton scattering of cosmic microwave background off of intra-cluster gas. The cluster selection function from such surveys {{is expected to be}} nearly independent of redshift and cluster astrophysics. In this work, we estimate the effect on the observed SZ signal of centrally peaked gas density profiles (<b>cool</b> <b>cores)</b> and radio emission from the brightest cluster galaxy by creating mock observations of a sample of clusters that span the observed range of classical cooling rates and radio luminosities. For each cluster, we make simulated SZ observations by the South Pole Telescope and characterize the cluster selection function, but note that our results are broadly applicable to other SZ surveys. We find that the inclusion of a <b>cool</b> <b>core</b> can cause a change in the measured SPT significance of a cluster between 0. 01 and 10 % at z > 0. 3, increasing with cuspiness of the <b>cool</b> <b>core</b> and angular size on the sky of the cluster (i. e., decreasing redshift, increasing mass). We provide quantitative estimates of the bias in the SZ signal as a function of a gas density cuspiness parameter, redshift, mass, and the 1. 4 GHz radio luminosity of the central active galactic nuclei. Based on this work, we estimate that, for the Phoenix cluster (one of the strongest <b>cool</b> <b>cores</b> known), the presence of a <b>cool</b> <b>core</b> is biasing the SZ significance high by ~ 6 %.

40|$|We {{present a}} new model for the {{creation}} of <b>cool</b> <b>cores</b> in rich galaxy clusters within a CDM cosmological framework using the results from high spatial dynamic range, adaptive mesh hydro/N-body simulations. It is proposed that <b>cores</b> of <b>cool</b> gas rst form in subclusters and these subclusters merge to create rich clusters with cool, central X-Ray excesses. The rich cool clusters do not possess ows " due to the presence of bulk velocities in the intracluster medium in excess of 1000 km/sec produced by on-going accretion of gas from supercluster laments. This new model has several attractive features including the presence of substantial core substructure within the <b>cool</b> <b>cores,</b> and it predicts the appearance of cool bullets, cool fronts, and cool laments all of which have been recently observed with X-Ray satellites. This hierarchical formation model is also consistent with the observation that <b>cool</b> <b>cores</b> in Abell clusters occur preferentially in dense supercluster environments. On the other hand, our simulations overproduce <b>cool</b> <b>cores</b> in virtually all of our numerical clusters, the central densities are high, and physical core temperatures are often below 1 keV (in contrast to recent observations).

40|$|We {{argue that}} the {{recently}} reported Kolmogorov-like magnetic turbulence spectrum in the <b>cool</b> <b>core</b> of the Hydra A galaxy cluster can be understood by kinetic energy injection by active galaxies that drives a turbulent non-helical magnetic dynamo into its saturated state. Although dramatic differences exist between small-scale dynamo scenarios, their saturated state {{is expected to be}} similar, as we show for three scenarios: the flux rope dynamo, the fluctuation dynamo, and the explosive dynamo. Based on those scenarios, we develop an analytical model of the hydrodynamic and magnetic turbulence in <b>cool</b> <b>cores.</b> The model implies magnetic field strengths that fit well with Faraday rotation measurements and minimum energy estimates for the sample of <b>cool</b> <b>core</b> clusters having such data available. Predictions for magnetic fields in clusters for which the appropriate observational information is still missing, and for yet unobserved quantities like the hydrodynamical turbulence velocity and characteristic length-scale are provided. The underlying dynamo models suggest magnetic intermittency and possibly a large-scale hydrodynamic viscosity. We conclude that the success of the model to explain the field strength in <b>cool</b> <b>core</b> clusters indicates that in general cluster magnetic fields directly reflect hydrodynamical turbulence, also in clusters without <b>cool</b> <b>cores.</b> Comment: 15 pages, 4 figures, A&A in pres...|$|R
40|$|Summary. We have {{observed}} a new, complete, cooling-core sample with the VLA, {{in order to}} understand how the massive black hole in the central galaxy interacts with the local cluster plasma. We find that every <b>cooling</b> <b>core</b> is currently being energized by an active radio jet, which has probably been destabilized by its interaction with the <b>cooling</b> <b>core.</b> We argue that current models of cooling-core radio galaxies need to be improved before they can be used to determine {{the rate at which the}} jet is heating the <b>cooling</b> <b>core.</b> We also argue that the extended radio haloes we see in many cooling-core clusters need extended, in situ re-energization, which cannot be supplied solely by the central galaxy. What heats <b>cooling</b> <b>cores?</b> The spotlight has turned on active galactic nuclei (AGN), driven by massive black holes in the heart of the galaxy at the center of the <b>cooling</b> <b>core</b> (CC). The jets in a few bright, well-studied radio galaxies (RGs) (e. g., M 87 [17]; A 2052 [2]; Perseus A [9]) seem to be pouring out more than enough energy to offset radiative cooling in the CC in these clusters.

40|$|Using {{data from}} the Two Dimensional XMM-Newton Group Survey (2 dXGS), we have {{examined}} the abundance profile properties of both <b>cool</b> <b>core</b> (CC) and non <b>cool</b> <b>core</b> (NCC) galaxy groups. The ten NCC systems in our sample represent a population which to date has been poorly studied in the group regime. Fitting the abundance profiles as a linear function of log radius, we find steep abundance gradients in <b>cool</b> <b>core</b> (CC) systems, with a slope of - 0. 54 +/- 0. 07. In contrast, non <b>cool</b> <b>core</b> (NCC) groups have profiles consistent with uniform metallicity. Many CC groups show a central abundance dip or plateau, and we find evidence for anticorrelation between the core abundance gradient and the 1. 4 GHz radio power of the brightest group galaxy (BGG) in CC systems. This may indicate the effect of AGN-driven mixing within the central ~ 0. 1 r_ 500. It {{is not possible to}} discern whether such behaviour is present in the NCC groups, due to the small and diverse sample with the requisite radio data. The lack of strong abundance gradients in NCC groups, coupled with their lack of <b>cool</b> <b>core,</b> and evidence for enhanced substructure, leads us to favour merging as the mechanism for disrupting <b>cool</b> <b>cores,</b> although we cannot rule out disruption by a major AGN outburst.

40|$|We {{report on}} a deep, multiwavelength study of the galaxy cluster MACS J 1931. 8 - 2634 using Chandra X-ray, Subaru optical, and VLA 1. 4 GHz radio data. This cluster (z= 0. 352) harbors {{one of the most}} X-ray {{luminous}} <b>cool</b> <b>cores</b> yet discovered, with an equivalent mass cooling rate within the central 50 kpc is approximately 700 solar masses/yr. Unique features observed in the central core of MACSJ 1931. 8 - 2634 hint to a wealth of past activity that has greatly disrupted the original <b>cool</b> <b>core.</b> We observe a spiral of relatively cool, dense, X-ray emitting gas connected to the <b>cool</b> <b>core,</b> as well as highly elongated intracluster light (ICL) surrounding the cD galaxy. Extended radio emission is observed surrounding the central AGN, elongated in the east-west direction, spatially coincident with X-ray cavities. The power input required to inflate these `bubbles' is estimated from both the X-ray and radio emission to reside between 4 and 14 e 45 erg/s, putting it among the most powerful jets ever observed. This combination of a powerful AGN outburst and bulk motion of the <b>cool</b> <b>core</b> have resulted in two X-ray bright ridges to form to the north and south of the central AGN at a distance of approximately 25 kpc. The northern ridge has spectral characteristics typical of <b>cool</b> <b>cores</b> and is consistent with being a remnant of the <b>cool</b> <b>core</b> after it was disrupted by the AGN and bulk motions. It is also the site of H-alpha filaments and young stars. The X-ray spectroscopic cooling rate associated with this ridge is approximately 165 solar masses/yr, which agrees with the estimate of the star formation rate from broad-band optical imaging (170 solar masses/yr).

40|$|Galaxy {{groups are}} the least massive systems where the bulk of baryons begin to be {{accounted}} for. Not simply the scaled-down versions of rich clusters following self-similar relations, galaxy groups are ideal systems to study baryon physics, which is important for both cluster cosmology and galaxy formation. We review the recent observational results on the hot gas in galaxy groups. The {{first part of the}} paper is on the scaling relations, including X-ray luminosity, entropy, gas fraction, baryon fraction and metal abundance. Compared to clusters, groups have a lower fraction of hot gas around the center (e. g., r r_ 500 regions. The hot gas in groups is also iron poor at large radii (0. 3 r_ 500 - 0. 7 r_ 500). The iron content of the hot gas within the central regions (r < 0. 3 r_ 500) correlates with the group mass, in contrast to the trend of the stellar mass fraction. It remains to be seen where the missing iron in low-mass groups is. In the second part, we discuss several aspects of X-ray <b>cool</b> <b>cores</b> in galaxy groups, including their difference from cluster <b>cool</b> <b>cores,</b> radio AGN heating in groups and the cold gas in group <b>cool</b> <b>cores.</b> Because of the vulnerability of the group <b>cool</b> <b>cores</b> to radio AGN heating and the weak heat conduction in groups, group <b>cool</b> <b>cores</b> are important systems to test the AGN feedback models and the multiphase <b>cool</b> <b>core</b> models.

40|$|Summary. — Clusters {{of galaxies}} {{are the largest}} relaxed {{structures}} in the Universe, and {{have proven to be}} among the most important cosmological probes. They are composed of roughly 85 % dark matter, 12 % hot gas, and 3 % stars and galaxies. In this chapter, the basic properties of clusters are reviewed. The physics of the intracluster gas is described in some detail. Gases at these temperatures (10 7 – 10 8 K) mainly emit X-rays. Many clusters of galaxies have central regions of dense, cooler intracluster gas called “cool cores. ” The properties and physics of <b>cool</b> <b>cores</b> are reviewed. Clusters are formed hierarchically by mergers of smaller systems. The basic physics of cluster mergers is discussed. Finally, I describe the phenomena which occur when clusters with <b>cool</b> <b>cores</b> merge. Mergers may disrupt <b>cool</b> <b>cores.</b> <b>Cool</b> <b>cores</b> in merging clusters lead to sharp density discontinuities called “cold fronts ” which have proven {{to be one of the}} most common features of high resolution Chandra images of clusters. c ○ Società Italiana di Fisica 12 Craig L.
