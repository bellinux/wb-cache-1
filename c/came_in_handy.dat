5|$|After the United States Army Corps of Engineers {{took over}} the Manhattan Project, it gave {{responsibility}} for the detailed design and construction of the reactors to DuPont. There was friction between the company and Wigner and his team. Major differences between Wigner's reactor design and DuPont's included {{increasing the number of}} process tubes from 1,500 in a circular array to 2,004 in a square array, and cutting the power from 500 MW to 250 MW. As it turned out, the design decision by DuPont to give the reactor additional tubes <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>handy</b> when neutron poisoning became a problem for the B Reactor at the Hanford Site. The extra tubes allowed a greater fuel load to overcome the poisoning. Without them the reactor would have had to be run at low power until enough of the boron impurities in the graphite had been burned up to allow it to reach full power, which would have delayed full operation by up to a year.|$|E

Abe Masahiro, who at the time was a rōjū, was one of these friends. Abe spoke on behalf of the Tokugawa shogun in regards to Japan’s national military defense and was the one who placed Nariakira in charge of Satsuma’s dealing with the Ryūkyū Western Trade Treaty crisis.|$|E

25|$|He {{was a part}} of the 15-man squad for {{the tour}} of Bangladesh in June 2015 but later withdrew due to dengue fever. He then made a {{comeback}} for the first Test of the Sri Lankan tour after Murali Vijay was ruled out due to injury. But he did not show any progress as he got out early in both innings for less than 10 runs. In the second match of the series, Shikhar Dhawan lost his place due to injury and was ruled out of the rest of the tour. Rahul replaced Dhawan and made his second Test century, 108 runs from 190 balls, which included 14 fours and 1 six. India went on to win the match to level the series and Rahul was named as the man of the match. His wicket-keeping skills <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>handy,</b> when Wriddhiman Saha got injured. Rahul took a catch to dismiss Angelo Mathews in the second innings.|$|E
25|$|In early 1868, the British force seeking Tewodros’ surrender, {{after he}} refused to release imprisoned British subjects, arrived {{on the coast of}} Massawa. The British and Dajazmach Kassa came to an {{agreement}} in which Kassa would let the British pass through Tigray (the British were going to Magdala which Tewodros had made his capital) in exchange for money and weapons. Surely enough, when the British completed their mission and were leaving the country, they rewarded Kassa for his cooperation with artillery, muskets, rifles, and munitions, all in all worth approximately £500,000. This formidable gift <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>handy</b> when in July 1871 the current emperor, Emperor Tekle Giyorgis II, attacked Kassa at his capital in Adwa, for Kassa had refused to be named a ras or pay tribute. Although Kassa's army was outnumbered 12,000 to the emperor's 60,000, Kassa's army was equipped with more modern weapons and better trained. At battle's end, forty percent of the emperor's men had been captured. The emperor was imprisoned and would die a year later. Six months later on 21 January 1872, Kassa became the new emperor under the name Yohannes IV.|$|E
25|$|Shastri {{continued}} as vice captain to Kapil Dev in the 1985–86 season. This {{season and the}} England tour of 1986 were ordinary ones for him. Australia, Sri Lanka and Pakistan toured India in 1986–87. Shastri {{played a crucial role}} in the Tied Test at Madras against Australia, scoring 62 and 48*. When Indian middle order collapsed and India fell behind the run rate, his two sixes in quick succession off off–spinner Greg Matthews <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>handy.</b> In the final Test at Bombay he scored 121*. As was becoming increasingly common, it was played in first and fourth gear. He hung around for around 30 minutes for the last run for his fifty and twice as long in the nineties. Yet he hit six sixes, three of which came after he completed his hundred. The huge six off left arm fast bowler Bruce Reid – a cross batted heave that went over longon – was particularly memorable. Six sixes in an innings was an Indian record at the time. But he was outshone by Dilip Vengsarkar who scored 164* in the same innings. They added a record 298* for the sixth wicket.|$|E

500|$|Perry {{thoroughly}} enjoyed {{what he was}} doing, {{saying in}} a 1989 interview, [...] "I {{got a kick out}} of live television. The spontaneity was the fun of it." [...] Spontaneity and the ability to be himself <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>handy</b> for swimmer/actress Esther Williams' guest appearance of March 16, 1957. A wardrobe malfunction meant that viewers were seeing more of Esther than 1950s television considered to be in good taste; more live show mishaps followed. At the show's end, Williams was swimming in a pool specially constructed on the set for her appearance. Como simply said, [...] "Goodnight, folks," [...] and leaped, fully clothed, into the swimming pool.|$|E
500|$|As {{in other}} Eastern Bloc countries, {{there was a}} Soviet-style {{political}} purge of communist officials in Poland after 1948, accused of [...] "nationalist" [...] or other [...] "deviationist" [...] tendencies. In September, Władysław Gomułka who opposed Stalin's direct control of the Polish PPR party, was charged, together {{with a group of}} communist leaders who like Gomułka spent the war in Poland, with ideological departure from Leninism, and dismissed from the post of the party's first secretary. Gomułka, accused of [...] "right-wing nationalist deviations", had indeed emphasized the Polish socialist traditions and severely criticized Rosa Luxemburg's SDKPiL party for belittling Polish national aspirations. More insidiously, the Soviets claimed Gomułka's participation in an anti-Soviet international conspiracy. Following Bolesław Bierut's order, he was arrested by the Ministry of Public Security (MBP) in early August 1951 and interrogated by Romkowski and Fejgin, as demanded by the Soviets. Gomułka was not subjected to physical torture unlike other communists persecuted under the regime of Bierut, Jakub Berman and other Stalin's associates. Under interrogation he defiantly conducted his defense, threatened to reveal [...] "the whole truth" [...] if put on a trial, and remained unbroken. Gomułka was thus placed in prison without a typical show trial until released in December 1954. Bierut, heading the victorious PPR faction whose members spent the war in the Soviet Union, replaced Gomułka as the PPR (and then the PZPR) leader. Gomułka remained protected by his Polish comrades {{to the best of their}} ability and the record of his sometime defiance <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>handy</b> when in 1956 there was an opportunity for the Polish party to reassert itself.|$|E

[...] Some trial runs with passenger coaches were done in south-west Scotland before D600 was allocated to Swindon in January 1958.

The new members were John Lodge, their bassist from El Riot who was now finished with his education, and Justin Hayward, formerly of the Wilde Three. Hayward was recommended to Pinder by Eric Burdon of the Animals and was endorsed by famed UK singer Marty Wilde, {{the leader of the}} Wilde Three. Pinder phoned Hayward after reading his lead guitarist letter, and was impressed when Hayward played him his 45 rpm single [...] "London is Behind Me" [...] during their car ride to meet the other members in Esher.|$|E
2500|$|In {{preparation}} for the 2008 Under-19 World Cup the West Indies under-19s competed in the 2007–08 KFC Cup. Bravo played for the side in two matches, the first saw his team dismissed for a one-day record low total of 18, Bravo was one of six players who was dismissed without scoring. Bravo {{described it as a}} learning experience saying: [...] "Collins was getting a lot of movement and Edwards was bowling very fast. It was difficult to get them away but the experience was good for us and it <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>handy</b> in the other games." [...] At the under-19 World Cup Bravo played in all five of West Indies matches scoring 165 runs at 55. In the plate final against Nepal he took three wickets for nine runs (3/9) and scored 24 not out. Bravo finished the 2007/08 season with two first-class matches but failed to score a substantial innings with a best of 29.|$|E

2500|$|This time, Griffith's gamble {{paid off}} and he succeeded in {{establishing}} his printing works in Middle Abbey Street, {{across the street from}} the Freeman's Journal and the newspaper wholesalers Eason & Son. The financial health of the SFPP remained, however, extremely fragile as payments for debentures trickled in over a six-year period. These sums <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>handy</b> for petty cash and to pay small bills but could not be used for any long-term investment. Griffith was therefore forced to make the daily newspaper as attractive as possible for the greatest number of readers, what might be called [...] "tabloidisation" [...] today. In contrast with the austerity of Griffith's previous publications, the Sinn Féin Daily was abundantly illustrated with cartoons, photographs and maps. We find large tables of national statistics, articles on industry or the language movement, and extracts from the Resurrection of Hungary side by side with descriptions of the latest Paris fashions, serialised novels and sensational news gleaned from the international press. It is a measure of Griffith's understanding of the market and his skill as an editor that the circulation of the two newspapers reached 64,515 during the month which followed the launch of the daily.|$|E
2500|$|In 1845, the First Anglo-Sikh War broke out, and Gulab Singh [...] "contrived to hold himself aloof {{till the}} battle of Sobraon (1846), when he {{appeared}} as a useful mediator and the trusted advisor of Sir Henry Lawrence. [...] Two treaties were concluded. [...] By the first the State of Lahore (i.e. West Punjab) {{handed over to the}} British, as equivalent for (rupees) tenmillion of indemnity, the hill countries between Beas and Indus; by the second the British made over to Gulab Singh for (Rupees) 7.5 million all the hilly or mountainous country situated to the east of Indus and west of Ravi" [...] (i.e. the Vale of Kashmir). The Treaty of Amritsar freed Gulab Singh from obligations towards the Sikhs and made him the Maharajah of Jammu and Kashmir. The Dogras' loyalty <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>handy</b> to the British during the revolt of 1857 which challenged British rule in India. Dogras refused to provide sanctuary to mutineers, allowed English women and children to seek asylum in Kashmir and sent Kashmiri troops to fight on behalf of the British. British in return rewarded them by securing the succession of Dogra rule in Kashmir. Soon after Gulab Singh's death in 1857, his son, Ranbir Singh, added the emirates of Hunza, Gilgit and Nagar to the kingdom.|$|E
2500|$|During December 1915 and January 1916 Lord Clive was {{stationed}} in the Thames Estuary to shoot down approaching German Zeppelins with shrapnel shells fired by her main guns, but she was denied a chance to waste ammunition when the Zeppelins never came within range. She bombarded German batteries at Westende on 26 January using the newly developed air-spotting techniques, but she only fired about eleven rounds during the half-hour bombardment. This was the last bombardment {{for the next seven}} months as the monitors were used to support British light forces, minefields and net defenses in the Channel. Lord Clive was refitted during this period with a pair of six-inch guns to enhance her armament against German ships. This <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>handy</b> on 8 June when she, along with other monitors and destroyers, rebuffed an attempt by a dozen German ships to clear the nets and sweep the minefields. Lord Clive participated in a deception operation on 8 July when she, as well as French [...] guns, fired blanks to cover the fire of the brand-new 12-inch Dominion Battery at Adinkerke bombarding the Tirpitz Battery. She was fitted with dummy second funnel to make the Germans think that she was a new monitor. The idea was to deceive the Germans as to the true origin of the shells landing around the battery, but the Germans were not totally deceived and retaliated against the French guns. Shortly afterwards they deployed a smokescreen to hide the battery which hampered spotting and they also located the Dominion Battery and fired against it.|$|E
