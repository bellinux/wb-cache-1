25|$|One {{model of}} horse {{domestication}} starts with individual foals being kept as pets while the adult horses were slaughtered for meat. Foals {{are relatively small}} and easy to handle. Horses behave as herd animals and need companionship to thrive. Both historic and modern data shows that foals <b>can</b> <b>and</b> <b>will</b> bond to humans and other domestic animals to meet their social needs. Thus domestication may have started with young horses being repeatedly made into pets over time, preceding the great discovery that these pets could be ridden or otherwise put to work.|$|E

The next defence Minister Hans Hillen planned to continue the purchase in the face of budget cuts that will see thousands of defense employees go as well as the sell off of Dutch military aircraft and ships, in order to maintain Dutch industrial participation in the F-35 program. On 20 April 2011 the newly elected Dutch parliament reversed the vote by its predecessor and voted to purchase a second test F-35.|$|E
25|$|SSB takes {{advantage}} {{of the fact that the}} entire original signal is encoded in either one of these sidebands. It is not necessary to broadcast the entire mixed signal, a suitable receiver can extract the entire signal from either the upper or lower sideband. This means that the amplifier can be used much more efficiently. A transmitter can choose to send only the upper or lower sideband, the portion of the signal above or below the carrier. By doing so, the amplifier only has to work effectively on one half the bandwidth, which is generally easier to arrange. More importantly, with the carrier suppressed before it reaches the amplifier, it can amplify the signal itself to higher energy, it is not wasting energy amplifying a signal, the carrier, that <b>can</b> (<b>and</b> <b>will)</b> be re-created by the receiver anyway.|$|E

500|$|American {{alligators}} play {{an important}} role in the restoration of the Everglades as biological indicators of restoration success. American alligators are highly sensitive to changes in the hydrology, salinity, and productivity of their ecosystems; all are factors that are expected to change with Everglades restoration. American alligators also may control the long-term vegetation dynamics in wetlands by reducing the population of small mammals, particularly coypu, which may otherwise overgraze marsh vegetation. [...] In this way, the vital ecological service they provide may be important in reducing rates of coastal wetland losses in Louisiana. They may provide a protection service for water birds nesting on islands in freshwater wetlands. American alligators prevent predatory mammals from reaching island-based rookeries and in return eat spilled food and birds that fall from their nests. Wading birds appear to be attracted to areas with alligators and have been known to nest at heavily trafficked tourist attractions with large numbers of American alligators, such as the St. Augustine Alligator Farm in St. Augustine, Florida. In addition to basking on shore, American alligators <b>can</b> <b>and</b> <b>will</b> climb trees to bask in if no shoreline is available. However, this is not often seen as the American alligators will retreat back into the water by jumping from their perch.|$|E

500|$|In {{response}} to the first destruction, on 21 October 2015, Creative Commons started the New Palmyra project, an online repository of three-dimensional models representing the city's monuments; the models were generated from images gathered, and released into the public domain, by the Syrian internet advocate Bassel Khartabil between 2005 and 2012. About the destruction during the second ISIL occupation, Abdulkarim states “This time, they don’t seem to have damaged Palmyra as badly as we feared.” and states that [...] "approximately 80% of Palmyra’s antiquities are in fairly good condition and 15% of those more heavily damaged also <b>can</b> <b>and</b> <b>will</b> be restored." [...] Consultations with the UNESCO, UN specialized agencies, archaeological associations and museums produced plans to restore Palmyra; the work is postponed until the violence in Syria ends as many international partners fear {{for the safety of}} their teams as well as ensuring that the restored artifacts will not be damaged again by further battles. The general director of the Czech National Museum, Michal Lukeš, signed an agreement in June 2017 committing the institution to help Syria save, preserve and conserve much of its cultural and historical heritage damaged by war, including the ancient site of Palmyra; he met with Abdulkarim and discussed plans for the works that are said to last until 2019.|$|E
500|$|The double {{burden is}} usually {{view as a}} primary problem for single women or married women. However, it is often less {{recognized}} that men can and often do {{go through the same}} trials and hard times as a parent trying to balance work and the family. Within the book The Canadian Family in Crisis, Conway addresses this issue with an argument from Eichler. Eichler says, [...] "Social science fails to understand men" [...] by tending [...] "to downplay or ignore a potential conflict between work and home for men." [...] Married men can avoid the full impact of the double burden, but single fathers are totally incapable of avoiding the double burden of family and work. Though single fathers face the same number of problems that single mothers face, they have two advantages that play in their favor. Men usually have a higher income and have a shorter time of being single than women. However, until they are remarried or have a woman to help them out around the house, men still must deal with the sexual and emotional frustration as a woman does. They must deal with the balancing of work, childcare, and domestic responsibilities. Single fathers are usually doubtful about their ability be a parent, and they are challenged psychologically. [...] "The problems faced by the working single father are more than merely the logistical problems shared by all working parents. He has to change the way he feels about himself as man." [...] A man being a single parent and feelings the effects of the double burden <b>can</b> <b>and</b> <b>will</b> interfere with his career just as it does with a single mother that has a career. A study showed that five percent of single fathers were fired form their jobs due to the double burden and another eight percent quit because the double burden became too much of a burden for them to balance both work and the family. With that being said, single fathers feel the same, if not more, of the effect of the double burden as women do.|$|E

In contrast, decision procedures require a clear-cut decision, yielding an irreversible action, and the procedure is based on costs of error, which, he argues, are inapplicable to scientific research.|$|E
