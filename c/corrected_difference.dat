With OLV for each patient, {{the practice of}} correcting the estimate by an initial measurement of (Paco 2 — PE'co 2) was evaluated by subtracting the initial (PaC 02 — PfCo 2) from subsequent values mea-sured at 10 -min intervals. Net (uncorrected) and corrected differences during OLV were analysed using ANOVA. (Paco-Pf'coJ values during TLV and OLV were similar: mean (SD) 1. 3 (0. 6) kPa and 1. 2 (0. 7) kPa, respectively (ns). Mean (Paco 2 -Pfco 2) varied in the range 0. 2 - 2. 5 kPa, while maximum fPaCOj—P£'C 0 J was 0. 3 - 2. 8 kPa. The mean (SD) of 133 pairs of measurements with OLV was 1. 1 (0. 7) kPa. Even after correction, mean (Pa co 2 — P^co,) varied in the range — 0. 7 to 0. 8 kPa; individual extreme values were from — 1. 3 to 1. 7 kPa.

40|$|The {{process of}} {{gravitational}} collapse excites the fields propagating {{in the background}} geometry and gives rise to thermal radiation. We demonstrate by explicit calculations that the density matrix corresponding to such radiation actually describes a pure state. While Hawking's leading order density matrix contains only the diagonal terms, we calculate the off-diagonal correlation terms. These correlations start very small, but then grow in time. The cumulative effect is that the correlations become comparable to the leading order terms and significantly modify the density matrix. While the trace of the Hawking's density matrix squared diverges from unity during the evolution, the trace of the total density matrix squared remains unity at all times and all frequencies. This implies {{that the process of}} radiation from a collapsing object is unitary.

40|$|There {{has been}} a {{resurgence}} in use of earth as a construction material largely driven by environmental concerns. Extruded earth masonry is a method of earth brick production that utilises existing fired brick manufacturing techniques. Extruded earth has distinct physical characteristics compared to other earthen building techniques. As industrial scale extrusion trials require large volumes of material, laboratory scale material development relies on samples prepared using alternative forming methods, such as moulding and compaction, which do not reliably reproduce the full-scale manufacturing process. The paper presents a representative method of manufacturing small scale extruded earth bricks. A suitable testing methodology is proposed, with varying curing conditions investigated. The small scale bricks are compared against equivalent large scale unfired earth bricks. The small scale bricks achieved a compressive strength of 3. 39 MPa and with a <b>corrected</b> <b>difference</b> com[pared to the full scale bricks of 0. 07 MPa; {{were found to be}} a reliable basis for laboratory scale investigation of material performance.

40|$|Environmental impacts {{associated}} with high salt concentration related to industrial activities can be assessed and monitored using geophysical methods. Repeated three-dimensional electrical resistivity imaging (ERI) was used {{over a three-year period}} to map the distribution and level of the salt concentration as well as evaluate the efficiency of a system of tile drains installed {{as a part of the}} remediation efforts, at a salt contaminated site in central Alberta. Maps of electrical conductivity distribution of the subsurface, collected at different times, were calibrated for environmental changes (temperature) between the survey times before they were interpreted for the distribution of high salt concentration. The corrected results exhibit the importance of the environmental factors in observed changes in the electrical conductivity of the subsurface which can completely obscure the subtle changes caused by natural or induced remediation of salt in the subsurface. The <b>corrected</b> <b>difference</b> maps of conductivities show clear reduction of EC along the tile-drain system in the region of high salt concentration. The corrected maps were further converted into the saturated-paste EC values using relationship developed in saturated-past laboratory experiments. The results were categorized into the map of regulatory values, using Alberta Environment Salt Contamination Assessment & Remediation Guidelines, to identify regions of subsurface which require further remediation. It has been hypothesized that chargeability changes due to free phase hydrocarbon contamination may be detected with induced polarization (IP) surveys. An IP line over a known hydrocarbon plume produced a zone of elevated chargeability coincident with the know location of the plume.

40|$|Introduction: Systemic {{sclerosis}} {{is a rare}} chronic inflammatory {{autoimmune disease}} in which course inflammation and a pathological proliferation of collagenous connective tissue develops. The complexity of the ocular changes associated with systemic sclerosis has been studied {{in only a few}} studies. This study compares the biomechanical properties of the cornea in patients with systemic sclerosis and a healthy control cohort. These possible structural changes in the extracellular matrix should be detected by collagen remodeling. Methods: 14 patients with systemic sclerosis (f:m 14 : 0 / average age: 55. 86 years) and 38 control subjects (f:m 18 : 20 / average age: 57. 43 years) were examined. All subjects underwent a clinically established ophthalmological preliminary investigation. Subsequently, a randomized study eye was investigated non-invasively on its corneal biomechanical properties, such as the central corneal thickness (CCT), corneal hysteresis (CH) and the corneal resistance factor (CRF). The determination of the intraocular pressure was measured by various methods (Goldmann applanation tonometry [GAT], dynamic contour tonometry [DCT], noncontact tonometry [NCT] by the Ocular Response Analyzer [ORA, Reichert, USA]). Results: The evaluation of the ophthalmological findings (spherical equivalent, cup / disc ratio, anterior chamber, axial eye length, GAT IOP) showed no significant difference. The measurement of intraocular pressure revealed significant lower values in patients with systemic sclerosis (DCT IOP: p = 0. 048, NCT IOPgat: p = 0. 002 and NCT IOPcc: p = 0. 000). Furthermore patients with systemic sclerosis showed a significantly thinner cornea (mean: 511. 65 ± 37. 35 microns) than healthy controls (mean: 552. 80 ± 31. 62 microns; p = 0. 001). Regarding the CH and CRF there were no statistically significant differences between groups. The corrected CH and the corrected CRF showed after applying the correction equation CHkorr -CRFkorr, in both groups a negative difference, which showed slightly decreased values in patients with systemic sclerosis (- 0. 83) compared to the healthy controls (- 0. 66). Conclusion: The biomechanical parameters (CH, CRF) showed no significant differences. Patients with systemic sclerosis had significantly lower intraocular pressure. These values were in comparison with other studies among the normal range, whereas the CCT in patients with systemic sclerosis was significantly reduced compared to healthy controls. The reduced value of the <b>corrected</b> <b>difference</b> CH and CRF's could be due to a slight degression of viscous component and reduced corneal damping capacity in patients with systemic sclerosis. The thinner CCT and the decreased difference value allow the conclusion of changing processes in the composition of corneal extracellular matrix in patients with systemic sclerosis...|$|E
