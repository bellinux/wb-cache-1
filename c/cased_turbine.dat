40|$|Poor {{design of}} low head turbine intakes {{can lead to}} a {{non-uniform}} flow incoming to the machine inlet. This can affect performance and operational features along its useful life. In most of the <b>cases,</b> <b>turbine</b> acceptance test are performed with ideal intake conditions without considering the actual upstream flow condition. This situation may result in different behavior between the model and the prototype, so it is advisable to model the flow approaching the inlet section. Such modeling is usually studied by physical modeling which can be costly and may require excessive construction and test time, especially when an optimized design is required, due to this fact is preferred CFD modeling. This work aims to propose the use of a methodology that allows the optimization of low head turbine intakes. The methodology takes as its starting point the Fisher-Franke´s [1] authors guidelines.

40|$|Reported {{experimental}} and {{computational fluid dynamic}} (CFD) studies have demonstrated significant power augmentation of diffuser shrouded horizontal axis micro wind turbine compared to bare turbine. These studies also found the degree of the augmentation {{is strongly dependent on}} the shape and geometry of the diffuser such as the length and the expansion angle. However the study of flow field over the rotor blades in shrouded turbine has not received much attention. In this paper, CFD simulations of an experimental diffuser shrouded micro wind turbine have been carried out with the aim to understand the mechanisms underpinning the power augmentation phenomenon. The simulations provide insight of the flow field over the blades of bare wind turbine and of shrouded one elucidating the augmentation mechanisms. From the analysis, sub-atmospheric back pressure leading to velocity augmentation at the inlet of diffuser and lowering of the static pressure on the blade suction sides have been identified as the dominant mechanisms driving the power augmentation.
