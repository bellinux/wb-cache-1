40|$|AbstractThe {{objects of}} this {{investigation}} were sculptures taken from a ca. three hundred years old baroque epitaph of a church in Tönning, a town in Northern Germany. Around 1900 it {{was found in a}} disastrous state heavily damaged by wood-worm. At that time, the whole artwork was treated with the tar extract <b>carbolineum</b> as a remedy. Nowadays, this substance has been identified as carcinogenic, and its presence can be perceived by its stench and visually at certain spots on the surface where it has penetrated the covering paint. A gold-painted sculpture of a massive wooden skull was interrogated with X-rays and fast neutrons to investigate the internal distribution of the <b>carbolineum.</b> The X-ray tomography, with its excellent spatial resolution revealed galleries left over from the worm infestation in the outer areas and cracks in the central region. The golden color coating appeared as a thick and dense layer. In comparison the tomography with fast neutrons, though being of lower resolution and yet unresolved artefacts revealed sections of slightly different densities in the bulk of the wood. These differences we attribute to the differences in the distribution of the impregnant in the wood, visible due to its higher hydrogen content making it less transparent for neutrons...|$|E
40|$|TH E {{observations}} reported herein {{were conducted}} to investigate the utility {{of some of the}} newer insecticides in the control of the common red mite of poultry (Dermanyssus gallinae) and of the northern fowl mite (Liponyssus sylvarium) Lethane A- 70, hexachlorocyclohexane, and pentachlorophenol were selected for the tests. Lethane A- 70, a powerful contact in-secticide, when used as a dust was found by Alicata et al. (1946) to destroy all mites and lice upon poultry within 48 hours. Slade (1945) first reported the gamma isomer (gammexane) of hexachlorocyclo-hexane to be effective against the red mite of poultry. Telford (1947) and Steward (1947) have confirmed the ob-servation. In laboratory experiments, Hixon and Muma (1947) regarded penta-chlorophenol as superior to <b>carbolineum</b> in the control of the red mite. Field testing was not undertaken...|$|E
