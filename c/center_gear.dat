50|$|This is the {{simplest}} of rotary positive displacement pumps. It consists of two meshed gears that rotate in a closely fitted casing. The tooth spaces trap fluid and force it around the outer periphery. The fluid does not travel back on the meshed part, because the teeth mesh closely in the <b>center.</b> <b>Gear</b> pumps see wide use in car engine oil pumps and in various hydraulic power packs.|$|E
5000|$|The 23B in 1963 had the {{original}} <b>center</b> <b>gear</b> shifter relocated {{to the right}} side of the driver, and the radiator and oil cooler were combined into a single unit, with the lower 1/5 or so acting as the oil cooler. The frame received additional structural tubes to take the torque of Lotus TwinCam-based 1.6 litre Cosworth Mk.XII and Mk.XIII, mated to [...] "high torque spec" [...] 5 speed Hewland Mk.V transaxle. Smaller displacement engines were mated to 5 speed Hewland Mk.IV.

The experimental results are compared with an analytical model that includes windage effects. The resulting findings show that the analytical model provides good agreement with the experimental impingement depth and that small oil drops are affected by gear windage.

40|$|A CFD {{method has}} been {{developed}} for application to gear windage aerodynamics. The goals of this research are to develop and validate numerical and modeling approaches for these systems, to develop physical understanding of the aerodynamics of gear windage loss, including the physics of loss mitigation strategies, and to propose and evaluate new approaches for minimizing loss. Absolute and relative frame CFD simulation, overset gridding, multiphase flow analysis, and sub-layer resolved turbulence modeling were brought to bear in achieving these goals. Several spur gear geometries were studied for which experimental data are available. Various shrouding configurations and free-spinning (no shroud) cases were studied. Comparisons are made with experimental data from the open literature, and data recently obtained in the NASA Glenn Research <b>Center</b> <b>Gear</b> Windage Test Facility. The results show good agreement with experiment. Interrogation of the validative and exploratory CFD results have led, for the first time, to a detailed understanding of the physical mechanisms of gear windage loss, and have led to newly proposed mitigation strategies whose effectiveness is computationally explored...|$|E
40|$|In this study, design {{requirements}} for a dynamically viable, four-square type gear test machine are investigated. Variations of four-square type gear test machines {{have been in}} use for durability and dynamics testing of both parallel- and cross-axis gear set. The basic layout of these machines is illustrated. The test rig is formed by two gear pairs, of the same reduction ratio, a test gear pair and a reaction gear pair, connected to each other through shafts of certain torsional flexibility to form an efficient, closed-loop system. A desired level of constant torque is input to the circuit through mechanical (a split coupling with a torque arm) or hydraulic (a hydraulic actuator) means. The system is then driven at any desired speed by a small DC motor. The main task in hand is {{the isolation of the}} test gear pair from the reaction gear pair under dynamic conditions. Any disturbances originated at the reaction gear mesh might potentially travel to the test gearbox, altering the dynamic loading conditions of the test gear mesh, and hence, influencing the outcome of the durability or dynamics test. Therefore, a proper design of connecting structures becomes a major priority. Also, equally important is the issue of how close the operating speed of the machine is to the resonant frequencies of the gear meshes. This study focuses on a detailed analysis of the current NASA Glenn Research <b>Center</b> <b>gear</b> pitting test machine for evaluation of its resonance and vibration isolation characteristics. A number of these machines as the one illustrated has been used over last 30 years to establish an extensive database regarding the influence of the gear materials, processes surface treatments and lubricants on gear durability. This study is intended to guide an optimum design of next generation test machines for the most desirable dynamic characteristics...|$|E

30|$|In this paper, a {{parametric}} {{study of}} the rhombic drive mechanism of a solar low-temperature Stirling engine was conducted. The goal {{is to find out}} the relationship between the rhombic drive mechanism parameters and the performance of a low-temperature differential Stirling engine. The results indicate that the offset distance from the <b>gear</b> <b>center</b> and <b>gear</b> radius of the rhombic drive mechanism have to be maximized, in order to increase the indicated power, while other rhombic drive parameters should be reduced for the same reason. Another result is that for realizing the optimized phase angle for beta-type Stirling engines, one should act on working piston-related bars and rhombic drive gear radius.|$|R

50|$|Maria Mitchell {{was born}} in Tulsa, Oklahoma and has lived there ever since, only {{spending}} time away when she attended Drury College, located in Springfield, Missouri. Her parents owned a chain of bakeries in the Tulsa area, so she spent {{a good amount of}} her childhood helping out in the bakery. Mitchell graduated from Edison High School in 1963. She graduated with her undergraduate degree in speech and drama from Drury in 1967. Mitchell married in July 1967 after being reacquainted with an old family friend. After three years, the two had their daughter, Missy, who was born with a rare condition leaving her legally blind. Tulsa did not have the resources at the time of Missy's birth to provide support for children with vision impairments. In 1972, Mitchell and another parent opened their own <b>center</b> <b>geared</b> toward visually impaired children, Little Light House, on October 3, 1972.|$|R

50|$|However, as the {{development}} process continued, engineers at BorgWarner discovered that, with clever software programming, they could control the variable electromagnetic multi-disc clutch {{to a point where}} it would allow the front and rear drive shafts to turn at different rotational speeds on its own, without the aid of a planetary or bevel <b>geared</b> <b>center</b> differential. In Auto mode the new software algorithms allowed the multi-disc clutch pack's friction and clutch discs to slip as needed, simulating a planetary or bevel <b>geared</b> <b>center</b> differential, making a geared differential redundant. Thus, the geared differential was abandoned and therefore never included on the final production version of the four-wheel drive system.|$|R

30|$|Theoretical {{analysis}} has been performed {{to study the}} rhombic drive mechanism parameter effect on a low-temperature solar Stirling engine. The variation of the machine spaces was investigated, and a thermodynamic analysis and a calculation of power based on Schmidt theory were conducted. A parametric study was then performed to evaluate the effect of each rhombic drive mechanism parameter on some machine characteristics, like power, piston and displacer strokes, and phase angle. In accordance with the obtained results of this study, offset distance from the <b>gear</b> <b>center</b> and <b>gear</b> radius have to be maximized {{in order to maximize}} the indicated power, while other rhombic drive parameters should be reduced for the same reason. Their minima values were given relatively to each other. Directives about realizing the optimal phase angle of beta-type Stirling engines were also given. As a conclusion, based only on rhombic drive optimization, one can increase the studied prototype power about 50 %.|$|R
