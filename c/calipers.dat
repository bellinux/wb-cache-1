5|$|Modern {{archaeology}} {{has led to}} {{the discovery}} of Han artwork portraying inventions which were otherwise absent in Han literary sources. As observed in Han miniature tomb models, but not in literary sources, the crank handle was used to operate the fans of winnowing machines that separated grain from chaff. The odometer cart, invented during Han, measured journey lengths, using mechanical figures banging drums and gongs to indicate each distance traveled. This invention is depicted in Han artwork by the 2nd century AD, yet detailed written descriptions were not offered until the 3rd century AD. Modern archaeologists have also unearthed specimens of devices used during the Han dynasty, for example a pair of sliding metal <b>calipers</b> used by craftsmen for making minute measurements. These <b>calipers</b> contain inscriptions of the exact day and year they were manufactured. These tools are not mentioned in any Han literary sources.|$|E
5|$|In {{the remains}} of a small cabin in the bow of the ship and in a few other {{locations}} around the wreck was found the earliest dated set of navigation instruments in Europe found so far: compasses, divider <b>calipers,</b> a stick used for charting, protractors, sounding leads, tide calculators and a logreel, an instrument for calculating speed. Several of these objects are not only unique in having such an early, definite dating, but also because they pre-date written records of their use; protractors would have reasonably been used to measure bearings and courses on maps, but sea charts are not known to have been used by English navigators {{during the first half of}} the 16th century, compasses were not depicted on English ships until the 1560s, and the first mention of a logreel is from 1574.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{archaeology}} {{has led to}} {{the discovery}} of Han artwork portraying inventions which were otherwise absent in Han literary sources. This includes the crank handle. Han pottery tomb models of farmyards and gristmills possess the first known depictions of crank handles, which were used to operate the fans of winnowing machines. The machine was used to separate chaff from grain, but the Chinese of later dynasties also employed the crank handle for silk-reeling, hemp-spinning, flour-sifting, and drawing water from a well using the windlass. To measure distance traveled, the Han-era Chinese also created the odometer cart. This invention is depicted in Han artwork by the 2nd century CE, yet detailed written descriptions were not offered until the 3rd century CE. The wheels of this device rotated a set of gears which in turn forced mechanical figures to bang gongs and drums that alerted the travelers of the distance traveled (measured in li). From existing specimens found at archaeological sites, it is known that Han-era craftsmen made use of the sliding metal caliper to make minute measurements. Although Han-era <b>calipers</b> bear incised inscriptions of the exact day of the year they were manufactured, they are not mentioned in any Han literary sources.|$|E

25|$|<b>Calipers</b> are {{hand tools}} {{designed}} to precisely measure {{the distance between}} two points. Most <b>calipers</b> have two sets of flat, parallel edges used for inner or outer diameter measurements. These <b>calipers</b> can be accurate to within one-thousandth of an inch (25.4 μm). Different types of <b>calipers</b> have different mechanisms for displaying the distance measured. Where larger objects need to be measured with less precision, a tape measure is often used.|$|E

25|$|The Veyron's brakes use cross drilled, {{radially}} vented {{carbon fibre}} reinforced silicon carbide (C/SiC) composite discs, manufactured by SGL Carbon, {{which have a}} much greater resistance to brake fade when compared with conventional cast iron discs. The lightweight aluminium alloy monobloc brake <b>calipers</b> are made by AP Racing; the fronts have eight titanium pistons and the rear <b>calipers</b> have six pistons. Bugatti claims maximum deceleration of 1.3g on road tyres. As an added safety feature, {{in the event of}} brake failure, an anti-lock braking system (ABS) has also been installed on the handbrake.|$|E

25|$|In {{vehicles}} with rear disc brakes, the parking brake either actuates the disc <b>calipers</b> (again, with much less force) {{or a small}} drum brake housed within the hub assembly (the inner circumference of the disc is often used instead of a separate drum).|$|E
50|$|A <b>caliper</b> is {{a device}} {{used to measure}} the {{distance}} between two opposite sides of an object. A <b>caliper</b> {{can be as simple as}} a compass with inward or outward-facing points. The tips of the <b>caliper</b> are adjusted to fit across the points to be measured, the <b>caliper</b> is then removed and the distance read by measuring between the tips with a measuring tool, such as a ruler.|$|R

50|$|Another type of {{floating}} <b>caliper</b> is a swinging caliper.Instead {{of a pair}} of horizontal bolts that allow the <b>caliper</b> to move straight in and out respective to the car body, a swinging <b>caliper</b> utilizes a single, vertical pivot bolt located somewhere behind the axle centerline. When the driver presses the brakes, the brake piston pushes on the inside piston and rotates the whole <b>caliper</b> inward, when viewed from the top. Because the swinging <b>caliper's</b> piston angle changes relative to the disc, this design uses wedge-shaped pads that are narrower in the rear on the outside and narrower on the front on the inside.|$|R
25|$|A new front-drive {{platform}} underpinned the car, {{although the}} wheelbase remained unchanged and overall length grew by a lone centimetre.

40|$|The Body <b>Caliper</b> is a {{relatively}} new model of skin–fold <b>caliper</b> (approximately 13 years old) whose reliability and validity has yet to be investigated on an adult population. Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} was to investigate the reliability and validity of the Body <b>Caliper</b> as an instrument and method for evaluating body composition in adults. One hundred adults (62 men, 38 women) aged 18 to 60 years participated in this cross–sectional study. Skin–fold measurements were taken with the Body <b>Caliper</b> using the YMCA protocol, and body density was calculated by the Jackson 2 ̆ 6 Pollock sum–of– 3 equations for men and women. Hydrostatic weighing served as the criterion method that the Body <b>Caliper</b> was compared to for validation.

25|$|<b>Calipers</b> are of two types, {{floating}} or fixed. A {{fixed caliper}} {{does not move}} relative to the disc and is thus less tolerant of disc imperfections.

25|$|For 2007, Ford's Special Vehicle Team {{launched}} Shelby GT500, {{a successor}} to the 2003/2004 Mustang SVT Cobra. The GT500 shared basic design characteristics {{with that of the}} Mustang V6 and GT. It retained the same basic live axle rear suspension setup of the Mustang V6 and GT, with some minor durability enhancements such as thicker sheetmetal supports and extra welds, as well as redesigned strut towers to accommodate a wider engine. The supercharged 5.4L 32-valve DOHC V8 engine with an iron block and aluminum heads was rated at 500hp (373kW) @ 6000rpm and 480lb·ft (650N·m) of torque @ 4500rpm. The Tremec TR6060 6-speed manual transmission used a 3.31:1 rear drive ratio. Wheels are 18×9.5inch with P255/45ZR18 tires in the front and P285/40ZR18 tires in the rear.
