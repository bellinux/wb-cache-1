40|$|High {{strength}} compacted {{graphite iron}} (CGI) or alloyed cast iron components are substituting previously used non-ferrous castings in automotive power train applications. The {{mechanical engineering industry}} has recognized the value in substituting forged or welded structures with stiff and light-weight cast iron castings. New products such as wind turbines have opened new markets for an entire suite of highly reliable ductile iron cast components. During the last 20 years, casting process simulation has developed from predicting hot spots and solidification to an integral assessment tool for foundries for the entire manufacturing route of castings. The support of the feeding related layout of the casting {{is still one of}} the most important duties for casting process simulation. Depending on the alloy poured, different feeding behaviors and self-feeding capabilities need to be considered to provide a defect free casting. Therefore, it is not enough to base the prediction of shrinkage defects solely on hot spots derived from temperature fields. To be able to quantitatively predict these defects, solidification simulation had to be combined with density and mass transport calculations, in order to evaluate the impact of the solidification morphology on the feeding behavior as well as to consider alloy dependent feeding ranges. For cast iron foundries, the use of casting process simulation has become an important instrument to predict the robustness and reliability of their processes, especially since the influence of alloying elements, melting practice and metallurgy need to be considered to quantify the special shrinkage and solidification behavior of cast iron. This allows the prediction of local structures, phases and ultimately the local mechanical properties of cast irons, to asses casting quality in the foundry but also to make use of this quantitative information during design of the casting. Casting quality issues related to thermally driven stresses in castings are also gaining increasing attention. State-of-the-art tools allow the prediction of residual stresses and iron casting distortion quantitatively. Cracks in castings can be assessed, as well as the reduction of <b>casting</b> <b>stresses</b> during heat treatment. As the property requirements for cast iron as a material in design strongly increase, new alloys and materials such as ADI might become more attractive, where latest software developments allow the modeling of the required heat treatment. Phases can be predicted and parametric studies can be performed to optimize the alloy dependent heat treatment conditions during austenitization, quenching and ausferritization. All this quantitative information about the material's performance is most valuable if it can be used during casting design. The transfer of local properties into the designer抯 world, to predict fatigue and durability as a function of the entire manufacturing route, will increase the trust in this old but highly innovative material and will open new opportunities for cast iron in the future. The paper will give an overview on current capabilities to quantitatively predict cast iron specific defects and casting performance and will highlight latest developments in modeling the manufacture of cast iron and ADI as well as the prediction of iron <b>casting</b> <b>stresses...</b>|$|E

Experiments are conducted using a cylindrical casting to study this effect for different sands (silica and zircon) and different sand binder systems (phenolic urethane and sodium silicate). The type of sand has a significant effect on the final casting dimensions, in particular because the expansion of silica sand can be irreversible. The sand expansion effect is enhanced by the presence of sodium silicate binder. In addition, the size of the core, which in the present experiments controls the amount of steel in the mould and thus the heat input to the mould, strongly affects the internal and external dimensions of the resulting casting. A combined <b>casting</b> and <b>stress</b> simulation code is used to predict the dimensional changes of the castings. In several cases, the pattern allowances are predicted successfully both for free and hindered shrinkage cases. Disagreements between the simulation results and the measurements can be attributed to the fact that the stress model does not account for the irreversible nature of the silica sand expansion, which is important when silica sand is heated to temperatures above ~ 1200 °C; and the outer mould sand surrounding the casting, which can cause inaccuracies when there is significant early mould expansion, hindrance, or movement...|$|R

Los métodos utilizados fueron el de moldeo por compresión a 140 ºC y 1 MPa y el método de {{casting a}} 23 ºC y 55 % de humedad relativa. El método de moldeo por compresión presenta la ventaja de involucrar menos tiempo y menos incertidumbre para la formación de las películas comparado con el método de casting. Por otro lado, mejora las propiedades mecánicas de las películas aumentando su stress máximo y su elongación y disminuyendo su permeabilidad al vapor de agua y su solubilidad. Palabras clave: Moldeo por compresión, <b>casting,</b> fuerza, <b>stress,</b> elongación, módulo de Young. Abstract The films {{were made from}} whey protein isolate (WPI) {{solutions}} using glycerol as plasticizer and {{with or without the}} use of potassium sorbate as antimicrobial. The methods used were compression molding at 140 ºC and 1 MPa and the casting method at 23 º C and 55 % of humidity. The compression molding method has the advantage of involving less time and uncertainty for the film forming than the casting method. On the other hand, it improves the mechanical properties bringing  films with higher tensile strength and elongation, and less water vapor permeability and solubility.

40|$|This report {{documents}} {{the results of}} an investigation which was undertaken to reveal the similarities and differences in the mechanical properties and microstructural characteristics of three Ni-Hard I alloys. One alloy (B 1) is ASTM A 532 class IA Ni-Hard containing 4. 2 wt. pct. Ni. The second alloy (B 2) is similar to B 1 but higher in Cr, Si, and Mo. The third alloy (T 1) also falls in the same ASTM specification, but it contains 3. 3 wt. pct. Ni. The alloys were evaluated in both as-cast and stress-relieved conditions except for B 2, which was evaluated in the stress-relieved condition only. While the matrix of the high Ni alloys is composed of austenite and martensite in both conditions, the matrix of the low Ni alloy consists of a considerable amount of bainite, in addition to the martensite and the retained austenite in as cast condition, and primarily bainite, with some retained austenite, in the stress relieved condition. It was found that the stress relieving treatment does not change the tensile strength of the high Ni alloy. Both the as <b>cast</b> and <b>stress</b> relieved high Ni alloys had a tensile strength of about 350 MPa. On the other hand, the tensile strength of the low Ni alloy increased from 340 MPa to 452 MPa with the stress relieving treatment. There {{was no significant difference in}} the wear resistance of these alloys in both as-cast and stressrelieved conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} {{cyclically}} <b>stressed</b> <b>cast</b> iron components requires the {{knowledge about the}} non homogenous microstructure. Even 'defect free' non-destructively tested (NDT) components can show significant differences in cycle life. Typically structures are stressed by varying stress fields. Experimental and calculative fatigue evaluation methods {{have to take the}} interaction between varying stress fields and varying strength fields into account in order to deliver reliable fatigue life estimations in service. Only reliable fatigue evaluation methods can be the basis of optimized design, manufacturing and quality management of cast iron components. In the paper a method is presented which fulfils these requirements and paves the way for a localized fatigue evaluation of nodular and vermicular cast iron components. This method can be applied by means of cast simulation or image analyses of microsections. It was developed by microstructure analyses, fatigue tests on specimens w ith varying nodular and vermicular microstructure and proved out by measurements and tests on components. The dependencies were described by multivariate correlations...|$|R
40|$|The {{dispersion}} of surface phonons for the Li-covered Mo(1 1 0) surface displays significant {{deviations from the}} dispersion on the clean Mo surface near the (N) over bar and (H) over bar points of the surface Brillouin zone, at low and high coverages of Li, respectively. So far, these deviations {{have been attributed to}} Kohn anomalies, similar to those known for the hydrogen covered Mo-surface. The failure to find appropriate nesting vectors in the Fermi surface and the new measurements on the Li-induced surface <b>stress</b> <b>cast</b> doubt on this interpretation, however. In this paper we explore the possibility to describe the frequency shifts by normal lattice dynamics which models the surface stress by loaded springs between nearest and next nearest neighbors in the surface. We conclude that lattice dynamics can account for the observed "anomalies" and coupling to e-h pair excitations need not be invoked. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Modelling and {{targeted}} experimentation {{are used to}} quantify the processing conditions which cause recrystallization in a single-crystal superalloy. The plasticity needed is traced to the differential thermal contractions of the metal and its ceramic mould during processing. For typical cooling rates, the plasticity causing recrystallization is induced above 1000 °C, thus over a temperature interval of approximately 300 °C after solidification is complete. The total accumulated plastic strain needed for recrystallization {{is estimated to be}} in the range of 2 - 3 %. Modelling is used to rationalize the influence of mould thickness, stress concentration factor and geometry on the induced plasticity. Negligible plastic strains were predicted in a solid <b>casting</b> with no <b>stress</b> concentration features, as found experimentally. However, recrystallization occurred in thin-walled sections, particularly beneath shroud-like features due to the plasticity induced there. The model provides the foundation for a systems-based approach which enables recrystallization to be predicted and thus avoided in new designs of turbine blade aerofoil. © 2012 Acta Materialia Inc.

40|$|Botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) is {{increasingly}} bring {{used for the}} treatment of childhood spasticity, particularly cerebral palsy. However, until very recently, all such use in this indication has been unapproved with no generally accepted treatment protocols, resulting in considerable uncertainty and variation in its use as a therapeutic agent. In view of the increasing awareness of, and interest in, this approach to the treatment of spasticity, and also the recent licensing in a number of countries of a BTX-A preparation fnr treating equinus deformity in children, it would seem timely to establish a framework of guidelines for the safe and efficacious use of BTX-A for treating spasticity in children. This paper represents an attempt, by a group of 15 experienced clinicians and scientists from a variety of disciplines, to arrive at a consensus and produce detailed recommendations as to appropriate patient selection and assessment, dosage, injection technique and outcome measurement. The importance of adjunctive physiotherapy, orthoses and <b>casting</b> is also <b>stressed.</b> (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
