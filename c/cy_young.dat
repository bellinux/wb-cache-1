5|$|Koufax was {{the first}} pitcher to win {{multiple}} <b>Cy</b> <b>Young</b> Awards, {{as well as the}} first pitcher to win a <b>Cy</b> <b>Young</b> Award by a unanimous vote. He is also the only pitcher to win three <b>Cy</b> <b>Young</b> Awards in the era in which the award was presented to one pitcher across the board, rather than one in each major league, and one of three Dodgers pitchers to win the one-across-the-board <b>Cy</b> <b>Young</b> Award. (The others were Don Newcombe, the first <b>Cy</b> <b>Young</b> winner in 1956, and Don Drysdale in 1962.) Each of Koufax's three <b>Cy</b> <b>Young</b> Awards were by unanimous vote. Koufax and Juan Marichal are the only two pitchers in the post-war era (1946-date) to have more than one 25-win season, with each pitcher recording three.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Cy</b> <b>Young</b> Award {{was first}} {{introduced}} in 1956 by Commissioner of Baseball Ford C. Frick in honor of Hall of Fame pitcher <b>Cy</b> <b>Young,</b> who died in 1955. The award would be given to pitchers only. Originally given to the single best pitcher in the major leagues, the award changed its format over time. From 1956 to 1966, the award was given to one pitcher in Major League Baseball. After Frick retired in 1967, William Eckert became the new Commissioner of Baseball. Due to fan requests, Eckert announced that the <b>Cy</b> <b>Young</b> Award would be given out both in the American League and the National League. From 1956 to 1958, a pitcher {{was not allowed to}} win the award on more than one occasion; this rule was eliminated in 1959. After a tie in the 1969 voting for the AL <b>Cy</b> <b>Young</b> Award, the process was changed, in which each writer was to vote for three different pitchers: the first-place vote received five points, the second-place vote received three points, and the third-place vote received one point.|$|E
50|$|In {{his second}} year in the major leagues, Perrine called balls and strikes for a no-hit game thrown by Addie Joss in 1910. In that same year, he umpired in <b>Cy</b> <b>Young's</b> 500th career win {{in the second game}} of a doubleheader.|$|R

5000|$|Listed at , 154 lb., Parent {{was known}} {{primarily}} for his fielding skills, {{but he also}} was a solid hitter and an intelligent baserunner. Twice he hit [...]300, including a career-high [...]306 in 1901, and led American League in at bats in 1902. He broke up three no-hit bids, as he got his club's only hits in these games. At shortstop, his fine defensive plays saved four no-hitters, including <b>Cy</b> <b>Young's</b> perfect game. He also {{was a member of the}} Boston team who clinched in 1903 the first World Championship in major league history.|$|R
500|$|Young {{began his}} {{professional}} career in 1889 with the Canton, Ohio {{team of the}} Tri-State League, a professional minor league. During his tryout, Young impressed the scouts, recalling years later, [...] "I almost tore the boards off the grandstand with my fast ball." [...] <b>Cy</b> <b>Young's</b> nickname came from the fences that he had destroyed using his fastball. The fences looked like a cyclone had hit them. Reporters later shortened the name to [...] "Cy", which became the nickname Young used {{for the rest of}} his life. During Young's one year with the Canton team, he won 15 games and lost 15.|$|R

5|$|The <b>Cy</b> <b>Young</b> Award is {{an honor}} given {{annually}} in baseball to the best pitchers in Major League Baseball, one each for the American and National Leagues. The award was first introduced in 1956 by Commissioner Ford Frick in honor of Hall of Fame pitcher <b>Cy</b> <b>Young,</b> who died in 1955. The award was originally given to the single best pitcher in the major leagues, but after Frick's retirement in 1967, the award was given to one pitcher in each league. Each league's award is voted on {{by members of the}} Baseball Writers' Association of America, with two representatives from each team.|$|E
50|$|In {{terms of}} high scores, the system favors current pitchers. It is {{difficult}} to achieve a very high score in a game without amassing {{a substantial number of}} strikeouts. In earlier eras, even for the very best pitchers, strikeouts were less plentiful. For instance, <b>Cy</b> <b>Young's</b> two no-hitters earned scores of just 90 and 88 due to their low strikeout totals (three and two, respectively). However, most of the all-time high game scores occurred in baseball's earlier era, when starting pitchers were permitted to remain in games longer than today; four of the top six all-time game scores were accomplished in stints of 21 innings or more.|$|R
5000|$|In 1906, Castleton moved {{east and}} joined the minor league Youngstown Ohio Works, a team based in the steel-production center of Youngstown, Ohio. The {{youngest}} player on a club of seasoned veterans, Castleton gained national exposure with a perfect game against rival Akron, shutting them out at 4-0. The local media compared the feat to <b>Cy</b> <b>Young's</b> perfect game a year earlier, and Castleton quickly received offers from major league managers, including Clark Griffith of the New York Highlanders. Drafted by the Highlanders, Castleton played out {{the remainder of the}} season in Youngstown, ending with a 22-12 record and striking out 156 batters in 278 innings.View Minor League Statistics ...|$|R
50|$|Waddell {{followed}} that season with 349 strikeouts in 1904, 110 more than runner-up Jack Chesbro. No other pitcher compiled consecutive 300-strikeout seasons until Sandy Koufax in 1965 and 1966. Waddell was the opposing pitcher for <b>Cy</b> <b>Young's</b> perfect game on May 5, 1904, {{and hit a}} flyball for the final out. Waddell's 349 strikeouts represented the modern-era season record for more than 60 years, and remains sixth on the modern list. In 1946, it was initially believed that Bob Feller's 348 strikeouts had broken Waddell's single-season mark, but research into his 1904 season box scores revealed uncounted strikeouts that lifted him back above Feller. Waddell still holds the AL single-season strikeout record by a left-handed pitcher.|$|R
5|$|The <b>Cy</b> <b>Young</b> Award {{is given}} {{annually}} {{to the best}} pitchers in Major League Baseball (MLB), one each for the American League (AL) and National League (NL). The award was first introduced in 1956 by Baseball Commissioner Ford Frick in honor of Hall of Fame pitcher <b>Cy</b> <b>Young,</b> who died in 1955. The award was originally given to the single best pitcher in the major leagues, but in 1967, after the retirement of Frick, the award was given to one pitcher in each league.|$|E
5|$|Twelve of the fifty-eight World Series MVPs {{have also}} won the MLB MVP, the <b>Cy</b> <b>Young</b> Award, or the LCS MVP in the same season. Koufax (1963), Frank Robinson (1966), Jackson (1973), Stargell, and Mike Schmidt (1980) are the only players to have won the MLB MVP and the World Series MVP. A total of six players won the <b>Cy</b> <b>Young</b> Award and the World Series MVP in the same season: Bob Turley (1958), Whitey Ford (1961), Koufax (1963, 1965), Bret Saberhagen (1985), Orel Hershiser (1988), and Johnson (2001). Seven players have won the World Series MVP in the same season in which they won the LCS MVP: Stargell (1979), Darrell Porter (1982), Hershiser (1988), Liván Hernández (1997), Cole Hamels (2008), David Freese (2011), and Madison Bumgarner (2014)—all of them were the NLCS MVPs. Koufax (1963) {{is the only person}} to have won the <b>Cy</b> <b>Young</b> Award, the MLB MVP, and the World Series MVP in the same season, while Stargell (1979) is the only person to have won the MLB MVP, the LCS MVP and the World Series MVP in the same season.

5000|$|Cuppy {{was born}} George Maceo Koppe in Logansport, Indiana (it is unclear {{at what point}} he changed his name but [...] "Cuppy" [...] is the phonetic {{spelling}} of the German name [...] "Koppe"). His rookie season came with the Cleveland Spiders in 1892, two years after <b>Cy</b> <b>Young's</b> debut with the team. In his first season Cuppy recorded an ERA of 2.51 and a record of 28-13, a performance better than either of Young's first two major league seasons. However, Cuppy {{was never able to}} match these figures. In 1893 the distance between the pitcher's mound and home plate increased from 50 feet to 60 feet, 6 inches. Although he remained an effective pitcher throughout the rest of his career, after this rule was enacted he never recorded an ERA under 3.00.|$|R
5000|$|Schreckengost {{made his}} Major League Baseball debut with the Louisville Colonels on September 8, 1897, and {{appeared}} in his final game on October 2, 1908, which was the perfect game pitched by Addie Joss. He was also {{on the wrong side}} of <b>Cy</b> <b>Young's</b> perfect game, pitched four years earlier. He may be best remembered for being Rube Waddell's primary catcher and roommate for the duration of Waddell's Philadelphia Athletic years. Waddell's unpredictable and bizarre nature famously led to Ossee insisting on a [...] "no crackers in bed" [...] clause added to Waddell's contract. Players at the time would bunk together while on the road, and while Ossee was one of the few who could generally handle Rube's antics, even he couldn't get past having to sleep with food in the bed.|$|R
50|$|Grey {{chose the}} University of Pennsylvania on a {{baseball}} scholarship, where he studied dentistry and joined Sigma Nu fraternity; he graduated in 1896. When he arrived at Penn, he had to prove himself worthy of a scholarship before receiving it. He rose to the occasion by coming in to pitch against the Riverton club, pitching five scoreless innings and producing a double in the tenth which contributed to the win. The Ivy League was highly competitive and an excellent training ground for future pro baseball players. Grey was a solid hitter and an excellent pitcher who relied on a sharply dropping curve ball. When {{the distance from the}} pitcher's mound to the plate was lengthened by ten feet in 1894 (primarily to reduce the dominance of <b>Cy</b> <b>Young's</b> pitching), the effectiveness of Grey's pitching suffered. He was re-positioned to the outfield. The short, wiry baseball player remained a campus hero on the strength of his timely hitting.|$|R
5|$|Despite lack of run support {{contributing}} to a poor win-loss record, Hamels was among the best pitchers in the National League, and was even mentioned as a <b>Cy</b> <b>Young</b> candidate. On September 1, Hamels pitched six innings of a Phillies combined no-hitter against the Atlanta Braves. Hamels was pulled for a pinch hitter {{in the top of}} the seventh due to having five walks, a hit-batter, and 108 pitches through six innings. Overall, Hamels was the only consistent star on the Phillies, finished sixth in <b>Cy</b> <b>Young</b> voting, and was frequently mentioned as a candidate to be traded in the offseason to bolster the Phillies' lackluster farm system, after he avoided being dealt at the July trading deadline.|$|E

5000|$|This {{change has}} been brought about by strict {{adherence}} to pitch counts {{as a basis for}} removing a pitcher, even though he may appear to be pitching well, and new pitching philosophies in general. Many {{have come to believe that}} the risk of arm injuries becomes far more prevalent after a pitcher has thrown 100 to 120 pitches in a single game. Though Hall-of-Famer Nolan Ryan once threw well over 200 pitches in a single game (a 1974 contest in which he pitched 13 innings), it is now rare for a manager to allow a pitcher to throw more than 120 pitches in a start. Former pitcher Carl Erskine noted the increase in ex-pitchers on coaching staffs since the 1950s, whom he considered better evaluators of a pitchers' ability to pitch late into games. [...] Given this, sabermetricians generally regard <b>Cy</b> <b>Young's</b> total of 749 complete games as the career baseball record most unlikely to ever be broken. Further supporting the belief is that only three pitchers (Young, Ryan, and Don Sutton) even made at least 749 starts in their careers.|$|R
