5|$|The prisoners {{begin to}} behave like {{soldiers}} around Irwin, using <b>code</b> <b>words</b> and gestures, infuriating the commandant. Winter reaches out to an anti-social prisoner named Yates (Mark Ruffalo), a former officer and Apache helicopter pilot convicted of running a drug-smuggling ring. Yates is bribed to inform about Irwin's plans {{in exchange for a}} reduced sentence.|$|E
5|$|From {{his newly}} {{established}} command post, {{in the trenches}} on the eastern bank of the canal near the bridge, Howard learned that the river bridge had also been taken. Captain Neilson of the engineers reported that although the bridges had been prepared for demolition, the explosives had not been attached. Howard ordered his signalman to transmit the <b>code</b> <b>words</b> 'Ham' and 'Jam' then brought Fox's platoon across the canal bridge, positioning them at the Bénouville to Le Port crossroads as the company's forward platoon.|$|E
5|$|Some {{women were}} able {{to arrive at the}} {{recruiting}} station in a man's suit, deny ever having been in love with another woman, and be easily inducted. Sexual activity, however, was forbidden, and blue discharge was almost certain if one identified oneself as a lesbian. As women found each other, they formed into tight groups on base, socialized at service clubs, and began to use <b>code</b> <b>words.</b> Historian Allan Bérubé documented that homosexuals in the armed forces either consciously or subconsciously refused to identify themselves as homosexual or lesbian, and also never spoke about others' orientation.|$|E
5000|$|Top Secret is {{the highest}} level of classification. However some {{information}} is compartmentalized by adding a <b>code</b> <b>word</b> so that only those who have been cleared for each <b>code</b> <b>word</b> can see it. This information is also known as [...] "Sensitive Compartmented Information" [...] (SCI). A document marked SECRET (<b>CODE</b> <b>WORD)</b> could only be viewed by a person with a secret or top secret clearance and that specific <b>code</b> <b>word</b> clearance. Each <b>code</b> <b>word</b> deals with a different kind of information. The CIA administers <b>code</b> <b>word</b> clearances.|$|R

5|$|Hamming {{set himself}} {{the task of}} solving this problem, which he {{realised}} would have an enormous range of applications. Each bit can only be a zero or a one, so if you know which bit is wrong, then it can be corrected. In a landmark paper published in 1950, he introduced a concept {{of the number of}} positions in which two <b>code</b> <b>words</b> differ, and therefore how many changes are required to transform one code word into another, which is today known as the Hamming distance. Hamming thereby created a family of mathematical error-correcting code, which are called Hamming codes. This not only solved an important problem in telecommunications and computer science, it opened up a whole new field of study.|$|E

25|$|After World War II, the folklorist {{and author}} Stetson Kennedy {{infiltrated}} the Klan; he provided internal data to media {{and law enforcement}} agencies. He also provided secret <b>code</b> <b>words</b> to the writers of the Superman radio program, resulting in episodes in which Superman took on the KKK. Kennedy stripped away the Klan's mystique and trivialized its rituals and <b>code</b> <b>words,</b> which {{may have contributed to}} the decline in Klan recruiting and membership. In the 1950s, Kennedy wrote a bestselling book about his experiences, which further damaged the Klan.|$|E
5000|$|Pair each <b>code</b> <b>word</b> {{with the}} polarity-inverse of that <b>code</b> <b>word.</b> The {{receiver}} is {{designed so that}} either <b>code</b> <b>word</b> of the pair decodes to the same data bits, such as alternate mark inversion, Differential Manchester encoding, coded mark inversion, Miller encoding, etc.|$|R
5000|$|Use a constant-weight <b>code.</b> In other <b>words,</b> each {{transmitted}} <b>code</b> <b>word</b> is corrected {{such that}} every <b>code</b> <b>word</b> that contains some {{positive or negative}} levels also contains enough of the opposite levels, such that the average level over each <b>code</b> <b>word</b> is zero. For example, Manchester code and Interleaved 2 of 5.|$|R
5000|$|Use a paired {{disparity}} <b>code.</b> In other <b>words,</b> {{the transmitter}} {{has to make}} sure that every <b>code</b> <b>word</b> that averages to a negative level is paired with another <b>code</b> <b>word</b> that averages to a positive level. Therefore, it must keep track of the running DC buildup, and always pick the <b>code</b> <b>word</b> that pushes the DC level back towards zero. The receiver is designed so that either <b>code</b> <b>word</b> of the pair decodes to the same data bits. For example, AMI, 8B10B, 4B3T, etc.|$|R
25|$|Triple M {{also began}} a new {{frequent}} listener’s initiative in August 2003 with the Freq Club. It involved listening for <b>code</b> <b>words,</b> {{which could be}} accumulated and redeemed for prizes.|$|E
25|$|As the war progressed, {{additional}} <b>code</b> <b>words</b> {{were added}} on and incorporated program-wide. In other instances, informal short-cut <b>code</b> <b>words</b> were devised {{for a particular}} campaign and not disseminated beyond the area of operation. To ensure a consistent use of code terminologies throughout the Pacific Theater, representative code talkers {{of each of the}} U.S. Marine divisions met in Hawaii to discuss shortcomings in the code, incorporate new terms into the system, and update their codebooks. These representatives in turn trained other code talkers who could not attend the meeting. For example, the Navajo word for buzzard, , was used for bomber, while the code word used for submarine, , meant iron fish in Navajo. The last of the original 29 Navajo code talkers who developed the code, Chester Nez, died on June 4, 2014.|$|E
25|$|Blumenthal {{and other}} state {{attorneys}} general reached a settlement with Craigslist on the issue; the settlement called {{for the company to}} charge people via credit card for any ads that were suggestive in nature so the person could be tracked down if they were determined to in fact be offering prostitution. However, Blumenthal remarked that subsequent to the settlement, the ads had continued to flourish using veiled <b>code</b> <b>words.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{acknowledgement}} bit is used {{to signal}} the correct reception of the base <b>code</b> <b>word.</b> This corresponds to having received three identical copies of the base <b>code</b> <b>word.</b> Upon receiving these three identical copies, the device sends a link <b>code</b> <b>word</b> with the acknowledge bit set to one from six times to eight times.|$|R
3000|$|... /N 0 value, and NRTX(i) is {{the number}} of {{required}} retransmissions for the correct decoding of the i th <b>code</b> <b>word.</b> In the case that <b>code</b> <b>word</b> i has not been correctly decoded within the maximum number of retransmissions, then we consider that NRTX(i) → ∞. Note that for the regular Pre-HARQ scheme, where the retransmissions include the entire <b>code</b> <b>word,</b> L = 1 in Equation 28.|$|R
50|$|Also {{note that}} this only applies to strings of b−1 bits at the {{beginning}} of a <b>code</b> <b>word.</b> Longer strings of identical bits are permitted as long as they straddle a <b>code</b> <b>word</b> boundary.|$|R
25|$|Note {{that the}} scaling of the luma and chroma {{channels}} is not identical. The minimum and maximum of these ranges represent the preferred signal limits, though the video payload may venture outside these ranges (providing that the reserved <b>code</b> <b>words</b> of 0 - 3 and 1020 - 1023 are never used for video payload). In addition, the corresponding analog signal may have excursions further {{outside of this}} range.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{complexity}} and obscurity of alchemical literature, and the 18th-century disappearance of remaining alchemical practitioners into the area of chemistry; the general understanding of alchemy has been strongly influenced by several distinct and radically different interpretations. Those focusing on the exoteric, such as historians of science Lawrence M. Principe and William R. Newman, have interpreted the 'decknamen' (or <b>code</b> <b>words)</b> of alchemy as physical substances. These scholars have reconstructed physicochemical experiments that they say are described in medieval and early modern texts. At {{the opposite end of}} the spectrum, focusing on the esoteric, scholars, such as George Calian and Anna Marie Roos, who question the reading of Principe and Newman, interpret these same decknamen as spiritual, religious, or psychological concepts.|$|E
500|$|I'm {{not sure}} how that will play out. The geneticists, if you read their papers, have long been using <b>code</b> <b>words.</b> They sort of dropped the term [...] "race" [...] about 1980 or earlier, and instead you see <b>code</b> <b>words</b> like [...] "population" [...] or [...] "population structure." [...] Now that they're able to define race in genetic terms they tend to use other words, like [...] "continental groups" [...] or [...] "continent of origin," [...] which does, indeed, {{correspond}} to the everyday conception of race. When I'm writing I prefer {{to use the word}} race because that's the word that everyone understands. It's a word with baggage, but it's not necessarily a malign word.|$|E
5000|$|Every fast link pulse burst transmits {{a word of}} 16 bits {{known as}} a link <b>code</b> <b>word.</b> The first such word {{is known as a}} base link <b>code</b> <b>word,</b> and its bits are used as follows: ...|$|R
5000|$|To decode a <b>code</b> <b>word,</b> {{remove the}} final [...] "1", assign the {{remaining}} the values 1,2,3,5,8,13... (the Fibonacci numbers) to the bits in the <b>code</b> <b>word,</b> and sum {{the values of}} the [...] "1" [...] bits.|$|R
5000|$|An m of n code is a {{separable}} {{error detection}} code with a <b>code</b> <b>word</b> length of n bits, where each <b>code</b> <b>word</b> contains exactly m instances of a [...] "one." [...] A single bit error will cause the <b>code</b> <b>word</b> to have either m + 1 or m [...] - [...] 1 [...] "ones". An example m-of-n code is the 2 of 5 code used by the United States Postal Service.|$|R
500|$|The Hamming bound, {{also known}} as the sphere-packing or volume bound is a limit on the {{parameters}} of an arbitrary block code. It is from an interpretation in terms of sphere packing in the Hamming distance into the space of all possible words. [...] It gives an important limitation on the efficiency with which any error-correcting code can utilize the space in which its <b>code</b> <b>words</b> are embedded. [...] A code which attains the Hamming bound {{is said to be a}} perfect code. Hamming codes are perfect codes.|$|E
500|$|Brunel {{developed}} {{a system of}} [...] "disc and crossbar" [...] signals to control train movements, but the people operating them could only assume that each train reached the next signal without stopping unexpectedly. The world's first commercial telegraph line was installed along the [...] from Paddington to West Drayton and came into operation on 9 April 1839. This later spread throughout the system and allowed stations to use telegraphic messages to tell the people operating the signals when each train arrived safely. A long list of <b>code</b> <b>words</b> were developed to help make messages both quick to send and clear in meaning.|$|E
500|$|At 05:45 on 12 July, Leibstandartes {{headquarters}} started receiving {{reports of}} the sound of many tank engines as the Soviet tanks moved into their assembly areas for the attack. At around 06:50, elements of Leibstandartes 1st SS-Panzergrenadier Regiment nudged forward and drove the Soviet infantry out of Storozhevoe, while elements of the division's 2nd SS-Panzergrenadier Regiment fanned out from the Oktyabrsky State Farm. The Soviet forces began a preparatory artillery barrage at around 08:00, and as the last shells fell at 08:30, Rotmistrov radioed the <b>code</b> <b>words</b> [...] "Stal! Stal! Stal!" [...] ("Steel, Steel, Steel!") – the order to commence the attack. With that the Soviet armour of the 5th Guards Tank Army began their advance.|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "code word" [...] {{was used}} {{prominently}} in 1998 by Harvard Law professor Alan Dershowitz when he {{testified before the}} House Judiciary Committee, opposing the impeachment of President Bill Clinton. Rep.

5000|$|Let's say three errors corrupt the {{transmitted}} {{bits and}} the received sequence is [...] Decoding is usually {{done by a}} simple majority decision for each <b>code</b> <b>word.</b> That lead us to [...] as the decoded information bits, because {{in the first and}} second <b>code</b> <b>word</b> occurred less than two errors, so the majority of the bits are correct. But in the third <b>code</b> <b>word</b> two bits are corrupted, which results in an erroneous information bit, since two errors lie above the error correcting capacity.|$|R

500|$|When {{naming the}} company, Sundberg, Blomberg {{and the other}} {{employees}} brought {{up a list of}} military <b>code</b> <b>words</b> used during World War II. They ultimately decided upon [...] "Avalanche" [...] as the company's name. The company worked on a prototype project called Rico: Terror in the Tropics in 2003. The project, designed by Sundberg himself, would eventually become Avalanche's first title, Just Cause. He pitched the game's concept to publisher Eidos Interactive, which was accepted. According to Sundberg, he wanted to develop a game [...] "where you could skydive onto the roof of a car and keep on going". The game was released in 2006 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 2 and Xbox 360. Sundberg considered Just Cause to be the 'DNA' and 'center point of the studio', since it was the first game they developed.|$|E
500|$|Protest {{organizers}} {{knew they}} would meet with violence from the Birmingham Police Department and chose a confrontational approach {{to get the attention}} of the federal government. Wyatt Tee Walker, one of the SCLC founders and the executive director from 1960 to 1964, planned the tactics of the direct action protests, specifically targeting Bull Connor's tendency to react to demonstrations with violence: [...] "My theory was that if we mounted a strong nonviolent movement, the opposition would surely do something to attract the media, and in turn induce national sympathy and attention to the everyday segregated circumstance of a person living in the Deep South." [...] He headed the planning of what he called Project C, which stood for [...] "confrontation". Organizers believed their phones were tapped, so to prevent their plans from being leaked and perhaps influencing the mayoral election, they used <b>code</b> <b>words</b> for demonstrations.|$|E
500|$|At Tobolsk, she and {{her sisters}} sewed jewels into their {{clothing}} in hopes of hiding them from their captors, since Alexandra had written to warn them that she, Nicholas and Maria had been searched upon arriving in Yekaterinburg, and had items confiscated.
