6000|$|Miss Mackenzie {{expressed}} {{her willingness}} {{to do so and}} regretted that Mrs Stumfold should have to work so hard. <b>Could</b> <b>she</b> <b>be</b> of assistance? ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs Durbeyfield {{clapped her}} hands like a child. Then she looked down, then stared again. <b>Could</b> <b>she</b> <b>be</b> deceived as {{to the meaning of}} this? ...|$|E
6000|$|Somehow Geoffrey's {{conversational}} powers failed him. Where was Beatrice? {{she ought}} to be back from school. It was holiday time indeed. <b>Could</b> <b>she</b> <b>be</b> away? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because she can’t whistle," [...] replied Captain Brisket, {{feeling his}} way carefully. [...] "And what’s more, she wouldn’t if <b>she</b> <b>could.</b> <b>She’s</b> <b>been</b> too well brought up for that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To begin with, {{they don't}} employ {{women in a}} Canadian bar. Then Sadie's quite a good sort and understands Bob--perhaps better than an English girl <b>could.</b> <b>She</b> <b>was</b> brought up on the plains and knows all about the life we lead." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yet," [...] {{rejoined the}} Baital impudently, [...] "if Tribikram had not {{preserved}} her bones how <b>could</b> <b>she</b> have <b>been</b> restored to life? And if Madhusadan had not learned {{the science of}} restoring the dead to life how <b>could</b> <b>she</b> have <b>been</b> revivified? At least, {{so it seems to}} me. But perhaps your royal wisdom may explain." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, how <b>could</b> <b>she</b> <b>be?</b> What did she do?" [...] cried Jill, forgetting her own {{troubles}} {{to look up}} with an open, eager face again.|$|E
6000|$|... 'What {{will she}} ever do!' sobbed Minnie. 'Where will she go! What {{will become of}} her! Oh, how <b>could</b> <b>she</b> <b>be</b> so cruel, to herself and him!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't guess, James. Why, where <b>could</b> <b>she</b> <b>be,</b> {{and where}} can she be staying if not with us? I didn't see her. Are {{you sure you}} are not mistaken?" ...|$|E
60|$|Juliette, for the moment, took {{no notice}} of her. As quickly and as dexterously as <b>she</b> <b>could,</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> tearing open the heavy leather {{case with a}} sharp pair of scissors, and very soon its {{contents}} were scattered before her on the table.|$|R
25|$|How <b>could</b> <b>she</b> have <b>been</b> without fear? <b>She</b> knew <b>she</b> might <b>be</b> killed, yet <b>she</b> did not care.|$|R
50|$|Fouan, Olympe, {{also known}} as La Trouille - {{daughter}} of Hyacinthe. Her mother, who was a tramp, ran off when the child was three years old, leaving her to grow up as best <b>she</b> <b>could.</b> <b>She</b> <b>was</b> passionately fond of geese, of which she had a large flock.|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{would do}} for a man, and in that I {{respected}} Captain Dornton's convictions, as you told them to me. But for a girl, how <b>could</b> <b>she</b> <b>be</b> independent, except with money?" ...|$|E
60|$|Could she kiss them? <b>Could</b> <b>she</b> <b>be</b> blithe {{and cheerful}} in her parting? Could she venture {{to reveal her}} face to them without a blush? Yes. Tackleton {{observed}} her closely, and she did all this.|$|E
6000|$|... "But having removed {{herself into}} that position, being {{as she would}} be, a Countess, or a Duchess, or what not, how <b>could</b> <b>she</b> <b>be</b> happy if she were {{excluded}} from the community of Countesses and Duchesses?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How <b>could</b> <b>she</b> have <b>been</b> so cruel, {{knowing his}} condition? She might, with woman's tact, have {{rejected}} him less abruptly." ...|$|R
60|$|Elizabeth had the {{satisfaction}} of receiving an answer to her letter as soon as <b>she</b> possibly <b>could.</b> <b>She</b> <b>was</b> no sooner in possession of it than, hurrying into the little copse, where <b>she</b> <b>was</b> least likely to <b>be</b> interrupted, <b>she</b> sat {{down on one of}} the benches and prepared to be happy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial.|$|R
60|$|Jessie {{gave all}} the time <b>she</b> <b>could.</b> <b>She</b> <b>was</b> glad to have {{something}} to think about, for Miss Manners was from home, so there were no readings before the Sundays; and her sharp eyes could not help seeing that there was something underhand going on between Amy and Florence--where she did not know whether to interfere or not.|$|R
60|$|But, {{sitting at}} work, {{not far from}} Doctor Strong, was a very pretty young lady--whom he called Annie, and who was his daughter, I supposed--who got {{me out of my}} {{difficulty}} by kneeling down to put Doctor Strong's shoes on, and button his gaiters, which she did with great cheerfulness and quickness. When she had finished, and we were going out to the schoolroom, I was much surprised to hear Mr. Wickfield, in bidding her good morning, address her as 'Mrs. Strong'; and I was wondering <b>could</b> <b>she</b> <b>be</b> Doctor Strong's son's wife, or <b>could</b> <b>she</b> <b>be</b> Mrs. Doctor Strong, when Doctor Strong himself unconsciously enlightened me.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh no, I like it awfully,' laughed Ursula, {{a little}} bit excited and bewildered, because Hermione seemed to be {{compelling}} her, coming very close to her, as if intimate with her; and yet, how <b>could</b> <b>she</b> <b>be</b> intimate? ...|$|E
60|$|Poor little one! how {{my heart}} ached for her! How readily was she {{acquiring}} the miserable experience from which I {{would have saved}} her. Never again <b>could</b> <b>she</b> <b>be</b> the Mariposilla she had been before this unfortunate visit.|$|E
60|$|But {{before he}} <b>could</b> answer, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> already effacing that naive {{question}} {{in her most}} grown-up manner.|$|R
50|$|During {{the years}} of {{conflict}} Guillot continued in the same stubborn way to express pacifist ideas wherever <b>she</b> <b>could.</b> <b>She</b> <b>was</b> comforted by Romain Rolland's Au-dessus de la mêlée (Above the fray - September 1914), by the attitude of Pierre Monatte with whom she corresponded throughout the war, and by the pronouncements of other teachers for peace. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> questioned several times but was not arrested during the war.|$|R
60|$|She {{tried to}} stand up and comfort him trustfully; but <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not; <b>she</b> <b>was</b> troubled at his presence, like the brethren at the avowal of Joseph.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{thank you}} all," [...] Beric said, [...] "for {{my wife and}} myself. She knows that in no place <b>could</b> <b>she</b> <b>be</b> so safe as here, guarded by the brave men who have so {{faithfully}} followed her husband." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oldring's Masked Rider! Oldring's daughter!" [...] exclaimed Jane [...] "And she's innocent! You ask me {{to believe}} much. If this girl is--is what you say, how <b>could</b> <b>she</b> <b>be</b> going away {{with the man who}} killed her father?" ...|$|E
6000|$|And she, the old spinning-woman, was the apple, eternal, unchangeable, whole {{even in her}} partiality. It {{was this}} which gave the {{wonderful}} clear unconsciousness to her eyes. How <b>could</b> <b>she</b> <b>be</b> conscious of herself when all was herself? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't, either. But I <b>could</b> {{see that}} <b>she</b> <b>was</b> just as nervous as <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>be,</b> {{every minute of}} the time. I guess she didn't like Mrs. Corey any too well from the start, and she couldn't seem to act like herself." ...|$|R
60|$|Venetia held forth her arms; <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not speak; <b>she</b> <b>was</b> stifled {{with her}} emotion.|$|R
60|$|Before {{the girl}} <b>could</b> answer <b>she</b> <b>was</b> gently pulled {{aside from the}} doorway, and Bishopriggs, thunder-struck, saw Anne Silvester {{standing}} in her place.|$|R
60|$|It {{was a sad}} day to Elspeth. <b>Could</b> <b>she</b> <b>be</b> {{expected}} to smile while her noble brother did this great deed of sacrifice? But she bore up bravely, partly for his sake, partly {{for the sake of}} one unborn.|$|E
60|$|Then {{nothing but}} liquor had been found; {{there would have}} been a great powwow if it had been the gold. So the {{treasure}} was gone forever--gone forever! But what <b>could</b> <b>she</b> <b>be</b> crying about? Curious that she should cry.|$|E
6000|$|... 'How <b>could</b> <b>she</b> <b>be</b> so cruel--so spiteful,' sobbed Charlotte, 'when he {{only came}} to ask one question, {{and did a}} good turn for me with the mats. I never thought of such a thing. Sweetheart, indeed! So cruel of her!' ...|$|E
6000|$|Their guest {{instantly}} {{abandoned his}} attitude of supplication {{for one of}} boasting: [...] "Destitute? Who the hell said I was destitute, heh?" [...] He was snarling across Claire at Mr. Boltwood. His wet face was five inches from hers. She drew her head {{as far back as}} <b>she</b> <b>could.</b> <b>She</b> <b>was</b> sure that the man completely appreciated her distaste, for his eyes popped with amusement before he roared on: ...|$|R
6000|$|In the meantime, {{she applied}} to the beadle to know whether [...] "there was any house in the village where <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> civilly entertained for her money, and whether <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> {{permitted}} {{to speak to the}} clergyman?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It wouldn't do {{any harm}} {{if you asked}} her," [...] said Nan. At first Una did not think <b>she</b> <b>could.</b> <b>She</b> <b>was</b> so shy that to ask a favour of anybody was agony to her. And <b>she</b> <b>was</b> very much {{in awe of the}} bustling, {{energetic}} Mrs. Elliott. She liked her very much and always enjoyed a visit to her house; but to go and ask her to adopt Mary Vance seemed such a height of presumption that Una's timid spirit quailed.|$|R
