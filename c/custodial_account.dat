40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "As part of its business systems modernization program, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is acquiring a system known as the <b>Custodial</b> <b>Accounting</b> Project (CAP). In September 2000, Congress directed that IRS limit its spending on CAP until IRS provided a compelling business case for investing in this project and started managing CAP as an integrated {{part of the business}} systems modernization program. GAO found that IRS has satisfied both of these directives. However, its business case guidance does not explicitly specify cost-effectiveness analyses as a way to economically justify proposed investments and define when and how these analyses should be prepared. As a result, IRS runs the risk of spending time and money developing future business cases for proposed system solutions that, like CAP, cannot be adequately justified on the basis of costs and benefits alone. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "This report reviews the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) third expenditure plan for its systems modernization project. GAO found that the plan satisfied the conditions specified in Treasury's 1998 and 1999 appropriations acts and that IRS was making progress towards satisfying Congress' direction on the <b>Custodial</b> <b>Accounting</b> Project (CAP) and Security and Technology Infrastructure Release (STIR) Project. Although IRS has made significant progress in establishing effective modernization management capability, important and challenging work remains {{to ensure that the}} systems work as intended. GAO also found that five modernization initiatives experienced schedule delays or cost increases, each of which IRS disclosed in the third plan. However, the third plan did not address whether projects' prior commitments for delivery of promised systems capabilities and benefit/business value were being met. IRS used contractor-provided "rough order-of-magnitude" estimates in preparing its third expenditure plan. However, consistent with its established practice, IRS planned to validate the third plan's estimates as part of its negotiating and definitizing contract task orders. For IRS' second expenditure plan, this process resulted in finalized contract costs that were $ 9 million under the "rough order-of-magnitude" estimates in the plan. ...|$|R

50|$|A <b>custodial</b> <b>account</b> is a {{financial}} account (such {{as a bank}} account, a trust fund or a brokerage account) {{set up for the}} benefit of a beneficiary, and administered by a responsible person, known as a custodian, who has a fiduciary obligation to the beneficiary.|$|E
50|$|In one form, a <b>custodial</b> <b>account</b> is {{an account}} {{set up for}} a minor, because the minor is under the legal age of majority. The {{custodian}} is often the minor's parent.

40|$|The Investment Company Act of 1940 {{regulates the}} capital {{structure}} {{of mutual funds}} in order to restrain their leverage and speculative character. It is often (mistakenly) assumed that the law prohibits open-end mutual funds from borrowing money. This Article (I) analyzes the law governing mutual fund capital structure to reveal when (and to what extent) borrowing is allowed and (ii) examines a novel dataset on mutual fund capital structure that shows borrowing is an unexpectedly common practice. Using data on all registered investment companies in the U. S. from 1998 to 2013, I find that nearly 8 % of open-end mutual funds, and 10 % of all mutual funds, borrow money for leverage purposes each year. This figure increases to over 12 % of funds when I include non-conventional forms of borrowing. In fact, mutual funds borrow about {{as often as they}} employ the most commonly used derivatives. Closed-end funds are more aggressive than open-end funds in their borrowing, often pushing leverage to the regulatory limits. I find that, in addition to borrowing for leverage purposes, mutual funds also borrow on a short-term basis to manage liquidity, via a host of practices: bank lines of credit, overdrafts on <b>custodial</b> <b>accounts,</b> and joint borrowing and lending facilities that allow funds to borrow from other funds. Recent regulatory initiatives (which focus on risks arising from illiquidity and derivatives) overlook the substantial borrowing practices of mutual funds...|$|R
50|$|For example, in {{the context}} of the Individual Retirement Account, a {{brokerage}} firm distinguishes its <b>custodial</b> <b>account</b> IRAs from trust IRAs when seeking IRS tax approval for an IRA plan which is part of a brokerage account agreement.

50|$|In another form, a <b>custodial</b> <b>account</b> is a {{trust account}} owned by an {{individual}} or institution, managed by a named party for purposes of rapid distribution of funds in that account.

40|$|This Issue Brief {{examines}} {{accounts that}} can be used to pay for health care services on a tax-favored basis. Starting with health savings accounts (HSAs), the function of these accounts is described, followed by a discussion of issues related to the accounts, whether expectations for the accounts will be met, and recent evidence on their impact. • HSAs are now one of a handful of accounts that individuals can use to pay for health care services on a tax-favored basis. Flexible spending accounts (FSAs) have been available since the 1970 s, while Archer Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs) have been available since 1996. Some employers also offer health reimbursement arrangements (HRAs). • An HSA is a tax-exempt trust or <b>custodial</b> <b>account</b> that an individual can use to pay for health care expenses. Contributions to the account are deductible from taxable income and distributions for qualified medical expenses are not counted in taxable income. Tax-free distributions are also allowed for certain premiums. There is no use-it-or-lose-it rule associated with HSAs, as there is with FSAs. In order to make tax-free contributions to an HSA, an individual must be covered by a health plan that has an annual deductible of not less than $ 1, 000 for self-only coverage and $ 2, 000 for family coverage...|$|E
