This mixed methods study was designed to elucidate and apply my theory of therapy in order to identify fidelity to my model as well as understand the effects it has on clients. This study also focused on how experiences in each session of therapy influenced the next session. Three couples who presented for therapeutic services at the Utah State University Marriage and Family Therapy clinic participated in the study. Then therapy sessions were conducted.

40|$|We have {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} an automatic anaesthesia record keeper (AARK) on record keep-ing time and vigilance. With informed patient consent and institutional approval, we videotaped the attending anaesthetist and his/her immediate surroundings during 66 surgical procedures. Thirty-seven <b>cases</b> were <b>charted</b> manually and the re-maining 29 were charted with a commercially available AARK. In order to evaluate vigilance, a physician examiner entered the operating room unannounced once during 33 of the manually <b>charted</b> <b>cases</b> and during 22 of the automatically <b>charted</b> <b>cases</b> and asked the anaesthetist {{to turn away from}} the monitors and recall the current value of eight patient physiological variables. The exam-iner recorded the recalled values and also the actual current monitor values of these variables. The video-tapes were reviewed and the anaesthetist's intra-operative time was categorized into 15 predefined activities, including intraoperative anaesthesia re-cord keeping time. We compared recalled and actual variable values to determine if the recalled values were within clinically relevant error limits. There was no statistical difference between the mean percentage case time spent recording manu-ally (14. 11 (S D 3. 9 8) %) and automatically (12. 39 (3. 92) %). Moreover, use of the AARK did not significantly affect vigilance. Despite major adva-nces in monitoring technology over the past 14 years, record keeping still occupies 10 - 15 % of the anaesthetist's intraoperative time. It appears that in using an AARK, the anaesthetist reallocates intra-operative record keeping time from manual charting to dealing with problems in the anaesthetist machine interface caused by inadequate design.
