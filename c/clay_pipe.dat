The north part includes a small necropolis, while the south part was probably a baptistery, as it features a square installation with a <b>clay</b> <b>pipe</b> that resembles a baptismal font. However, Nikolova considers its shape much too unusual and its depth unsuitable for baptism, and believes it may instead have been designed as a vessel for dispensing holy water.|$|E

There have been excavated four house foundations in Västergarn with different sorts of <b>clay</b> <b>pipes</b> dating to the post-medieval period. Can they tell which people used them or which country they were produced? By discussing the meaning of <b>clay</b> <b>pipes</b> in early modern society on Gotland this essay tries to answer these questions...|$|R

2500|$|Tsunami {{deposits}} {{linked to}} the 1693 tsunami have been found both onshore and offshore. At Ognina, just south of Syracuse, {{at the head of}} a ria, a sequence containing several coarse clastic layers has been found, inconsistent with its lagoonal setting. The uppermost coarse layer, which has a strongly erosive base, consists of coarse sand with up to granule size clasts. The layer has been dated as 17th to 18th century based on pottery shards and one well-preserved <b>clay</b> <b>pipe,</b> consistent with the 1693 tsunami. Offshore from Augusta, a sequence identified using chirp sonar data was sampled with a [...] gravity core in [...] of water. Following detailed analysis of both grain size and foraminifera assemblages, eleven possible high-energy events were found based on the presence of large numbers of shallow water forams combined with a greater proportion of fine sand in the same interval. The uppermost two events correlate well with the tsunamis from the 1908 Messina earthquake and the 1693 earthquake.|$|E

2500|$|One legend told {{among the}} Delaware Indians {{describes}} {{the discovery of}} a fragment of bone left by a monster that had once been killing people near modern Philadelphia in either Pennsylvania or eastern New Jersey. When the hunting party brought the piece of bone back to the village, a wise man encouraged them to set out and find more of the monsters remains. He said that smoking fragments of the bone with tobacco in a small clay spoon could grant wishes like good health for one's children, longevity, or successful hunting. Fossils of the mosasaur Tylosaurus have been found in the area, but dinosaurs and Cretaceous crocodiles are also possible sources. This legend likely predates European contact and may have originated prior to 1500. The bones being burnt in the [...] "clay spoon" [...] is a reference to a primitive kind of <b>clay</b> <b>pipe</b> that the local people had abandoned in favor of a design with a deeper bowl by the 17th century.
