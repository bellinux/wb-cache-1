At the Fraunhofer Institute for Ceramic Technologies and Systems {{the principle of}} manufacturing of a novel generation of kiln furniture with advanced properties is investigated. The combination of different shaping technologies (tape casting, winding, extrusion) allow the manufacturing of kiln furniture with a low density and low heat capacity but also with a high stiffness and a good thermal shock behavior. Planar green tapes are laminated with a supporting structure, which has macroscopic cavities allowing passage of air or gas and which reduce {{the density of the}} structure. The paper presents the manufacturing and the advantages of the new kiln furniture. The simulation of different geometries for the supporting structure allows the maximization of the ratio between strength and mass of the kiln furniture.

40|$|Destructive <b>testing</b> of <b>creep</b> exposed {{components}} {{is a powerful}} tool for evaluation of remaining lifetime of high temperature pipe systems. The most common destructive evaluation method used today is uniaxial <b>creep</b> <b>testing.</b> Uniaxial <b>creep</b> <b>tests</b> can produce accurate creep curves but the test method has some drawbacks such as costliness and long testing times.

The time-dependent properties of viscoelastic materials in nanoscale are evaluated by using a harmonic nanoindentation test which is performed by a nanoindenter assembled on an atomic force microscope with a three sided pyramidal Berkovich probe tip. The experimental data are calculated by a numerical regression to fit the three-parameter Kelvin-Maxwell viscoelastic model and compared with the data determined from a <b>creep</b> <b>test</b> conducted by a tension machine.

Conventionally identifying material properties by a uniaxial test is widely applied to engineering. How the properties obtained from a small punch test can be applied with the same utility has been a goal.

Also, the proportion of life consumed will vary from position to position within a component and the plant.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work {{was to develop a}} {{practical}} method for constitutive modelling of polyethylene, based on a phenomenological approach, which can be applied for structural analysis. Polyethylene (PE) is increasingly used as a structural material, for example in pipes installed by trenchless methods where relatively low stiffness of PE reduces the required installation forces, chemical inertness makes it applicable for corrosive environments, and adequate strength allows to use it for sewer, gas and water lines. Polyethylene exhibits time-dependent constitutive behaviour, which is also dependent on the applied stress level resulting in nonlinear stress-strain relationships. Nonlinear viscoelastic theory has been well established and a variety of modelling approaches have been derived from it. In {{order to be able to}} realistically utilize the nonlinear modelling approaches in design, a simple method is needed for finding the constitutive formulation for a specific polyethylene type. In this study, time-dependent constitutive relationships for polymers are investigated for polyethylene materials. <b>Creep</b> <b>tests</b> on seven polyethylene materials were conducted and the experimental results indicate strong nonlinear viscoelasticity in the material responses. <b>Creep</b> <b>tests</b> on seven materials were conducted for 24 hours for modelling purposes.
