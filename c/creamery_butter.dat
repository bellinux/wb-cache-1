The dairy subsector {{includes}} companies that manufacture <b>creamery</b> <b>butter,</b> condensed and evaporated milk, frozen desserts, ice cream, natural and processed cheese, and specialty dairy products. In canning, salt is primarily added as a flavor enhancer and preservative. It also {{is used as a}} carrier for other ingredients, dehydrating agent, enzyme inhibitor and tenderizer. In baking, salt {{is added to}} control the rate of fermentation in bread dough. It also is used to strengthen the gluten (the elastic protein-water complex in certain doughs) and as a flavor enhancer, such as a topping on baked goods. The food-processing category also contains grain mill products. These products consist of milling flour and rice and manufacturing cereal breakfast food and blended or prepared flour. Salt is also used a seasoning agent, e.g. in potato chips, pretzels, cat and dog food.|$|E

5000|$|The {{company was}} started by Virgil Odell. Virgil Odell owned several theatres in Idaho in the 1960s. At the time theatres were using <b>creamery</b> <b>butter,</b> or stick butter {{as we know it}} today, to put on top of popcorn. The problem with <b>creamery</b> <b>butter</b> is that it needs to be {{refrigerated}} and when melted it separates into water, milk solids and butterfat so it had to be constantly stirred before being put on the popcorn. Virgil discovered a process used by the military to remove water and milk solids from butter. This process enabled butter to be shipped overseas without refrigeration or special handling. This process led to the introduction of Odell’s Anhydrous Butterfat for the use on theatre popcorn, it was an immediate success with theatres. On January 31, 1961, Odell Concession Specialty Co., Inc., was formed.On October 27, 1979, Virgil Odell died. Arthur R. Anderson assumed the duties of the President with 51% ownership in Odell Concession Specialty Co., Inc., the other 49% was split between three other individuals. At the time Odell Concession Specialty Co., Inc., consisted of five theatres and what is commonly referred to as ‘the Butter Company’. Within five years of Virgil’s death the company was split up and the three share holders chose to own and operate the theatres and Art Anderson became sole proprietor of what is now called Odell’s, ‘the Butter Company.’In 2001 Art Anderson sold Odell’s to his son Arthur M. Anderson and his wife Vikki B. Anderson ...|$|E

5000|$|Sugar cane was an {{important}} industry to the early settlers, with many small mills operating across the district. These were later replaced by larger more efficient steam mills such as those erected in 1882 at Alstonville (owned by the Melbourne Sugar Company) adjacent to Maguires Creek and at Rous Mill adjacent to Youngman Creek. By 1896 the Rous mill boasted a light rail line to transport cane from Alstonville. From the 1890s ownward, dairies became common across the area, later becoming the dominant industry {{for the first half}} of the 20th century. Due to lack of refrigeration, cream, not milk, was the product of interest, which was transported to local factories to be made into butter. The first butter factories were located at Wollongbah (1889), Rous (1889) and Teven Road (1890). In 1900 [...] the NSW <b>Creamery</b> <b>Butter</b> Company built the Alstonville factory near Maguires Creek, which was sometime later acquired by NORCO. After closing this building became a caravan factory, peanut factory, and finally a furniture factory, which is still open today.|$|E

Arthur took over the management of Franklyn Vale, which ultimately became his home, in 1891. In the 1890s he acquired his brother's interest in the property, and after his father's death in 1900, became sole owner. He developed Herefords and dairy cattle at Franklyn Vale, but mainly used the run as a fattening depot for his two other Queensland cattle properties: Redbank in the Burnett and Avoca in the Brisbane Valley.|$|R

As the town grew, it soon hosted a dairy {{management}} office, dormitories for employees, a livery stable, a blacksmith, and later a gas station. A school was built, and a feed store and post office gave Harmony official status as a community. At its peak, the creamery employed 10 workers, producing high quality dairy products, including butter and cheese that gave Harmony name recognition statewide. The <b>creamery</b> purified <b>butter</b> by cooking it in the traditional Swiss way, clarifying and giving it a golden color—old-world dairymen claimed butter produced by this method never turned rancid.

50|$|From {{the late}} 1880s, the Queensland {{government}} promoted {{the establishment of}} dairying in Queensland as a commercial, rather than subsistence, activity. The development of dairying as a staple industry was considered a means of relieving selector poverty and debt, and as encouragement to closer settlement of the land. The Meat and Dairy Produce Act 1893 was introduced to offer subsidies to dairy farmers and a tax on cattle, the latter funding the establishment of <b>creameries,</b> cheese and <b>butter</b> factories throughout Queensland. In 1895, Queensland produced its first butter surplus.|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} a common {{practice}} for some years for Iowa creameries to send samples of butter to the Iowa Experiment Station for chemical analysis. These analyses reveal {{the fact that there}} is considerable variation in the chemical composition of butter manufactured in the various creameries. At times there are large variations in the composition of butter manufactured in the same creamery. A project was initiated in 1980 to determine the extent of such irregularities and at the same time to assist the <b>creameries</b> to manufacture <b>butter</b> of a more uniform chemical composition. Similar work was carried on by the University of California as early as 1925; Oregon State College began a similar project in 1929. The Land O’Lakes Company, of Minneapolis, Minn., has maintained a service laboratory for its group of creameries for several years. During recent years service laboratories have been established by various butter marketing groups as well as by some of the Agricultural Experiment stations...|$|R
40|$|In 2001, {{extensive}} archaeological excavations {{were conducted}} at the Oneida Cheese Factory in Jones County. The county {{is a microcosm of}} larger dairying trends found throughout northeast Iowa, the state’s premier dairy-producing region. Jones County moved from homemade cheese and butter production by farm women, to the industrialization of the dairy farm and opening of cheese factories and <b>butter</b> <b>creameries.</b> A number of innovations affected the industry around the turn-of-the-twentieth century, including reliable butterfat testing, the introduction of ensilage (silos) that created yearround milk production, and consolidation of the many local creameries into larger creamery organizations, such as the Diamond Creamery run by Henry D. Sherman of Jones County. Iowa’s dairy industry of today looks very different from its heritage: consolidation and competition have drastically reduced the number of cows, dairy farms, and processing plants. In recent years, northeast Iowa has become the center of a movement to revitalize Iowa’s dairy industry, particularly through the use of value-added strategies, such as niche markets and large regional co-operatives: the lessons from Iowa’s dairying legacy are resurfacing as a solution to modern agricultural challenges...|$|R

40|$|Note:Until {{the last}} few years, Canada has never devoted much {{attention}} to the development of markets for her surplus <b>creamery</b> <b>butter.</b> Although this product has been exported in varying quantities since the introduction of mechanical refrigeration on steamships in 1897, the period of rapid growth prior to the war steadily reduced the volume available for export, until in 1913 this country imported six times as much as she exported. More recently, there has been a decided increase in butter production, not only in Ontario and Quebec, but also in the three Prairie Provinces. In the latter, the phenomenal growth of the dairy industry can be attributed largely {{to the development of a}} system of mixed farming, as a result of the poor returns from grain-growing after 1920. Thus these provinces, which not long ago imported butter, now manufacture nearly as much as is made in Ontario. Unlike the latter province, these provinces have few industrial centres to provide a home market, and are forced to seek a market for any surplus farther afield. [ [...] . ...|$|E
40|$|New Zealand's {{economy is}} {{dependent}} on dairying {{as a source of}} national income to a very marked degree, for {{more than one-third of the}} country's total export income is derived from this source. Of the total whole milk produced *at the pail* in the 1952 - 53 season, over 68 per cent was manufactured into <b>creamery</b> <b>butter,</b> yielding 200, 000 tons. A revenue in excess of £ 52, 000, 000 was derived from this butter. A processing industry of this magnitude and importance merits close attention. Although much time and research have been devoted to technical manufacturing problems, very little analytical work has been conducted in New Zealand on the economic aspect of efficiency in dairy processing industry. Although data are available in the form of reports, compiled statistics and articles, they are descriptive in character, or mere compilations. As such they fail in the important task of analysis of the conditions they describe. It seems strange that in a country like New Zealand where the standard of scientific reasearch is so high and where the dairy industry contributes so much to the national economy, that so little is known of the economic aspects of the dairy industry. Apart from TASKER's two papers TASKER, J. P. (1938;: The Cost and Capitalization of North Auckland creameries during 1935 - 36. The Accountants' J.

A), PP. 204 - 213, 1944. the amount of analytical research is almost nil. The valuable information compiled by the New Zealand Dairy Board is largely descriptive and statistical and does not throw light upon the problems as investigated by research workers in this field overseas.
