5|$|Tchaikovsky {{remained}} friendly {{but never}} intimate {{with most of}} The Five, ambivalent about their music; their goals and aesthetics did not match his. He took pains to ensure his musical independence from {{them as well as}} from the conservative faction at the Conservatory—an outcome facilitated by his acceptance of a professorship at the Moscow Conservatory offered to him by Nikolai Rubinstein, Anton's brother. When Rimsky-Korsakov was offered a professorship at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory, it was to Tchaikovsky that he turned for advice and guidance. Later, when Rimsky-Korsakov was under pressure from his fellow nationalists for his <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>attitude</b> on music education and his own intensive studies in music, Tchaikovsky continued to support him morally, told him that he fully applauded what he was doing and admired both his artistic modesty and his strength of character. In the 1880s, long after the members of The Five had gone their separate ways, another group called the Belyayev circle took up where they left off. Tchaikovsky enjoyed close relations with the leading members of this group—Alexander Glazunov, Anatoly Lyadov and, by then, Rimsky-Korsakov.|$|E
5|$|The symphony had {{established}} itself {{by the end}} of the 18th century as the most prestigious of instrumental genres. While the genre had been developed with considerable intensity throughout that century and appeared in a wide range of occasions, it was generally used as an opening or closing work; in between would be works that included vocal and instrumental soloists. Because of its lack of written text for focus, it was seen as a vehicle for entertainment rather than for social, moral or intellectual ideas. As the symphony grew in size and artistic significance, thanks in part to efforts in the form by Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven, it also amassed greater prestige. A concurrent <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>attitude</b> toward instrumental music in general also took place, and the lack of text, once seen as a handicap, became considered a virtue.|$|E
5|$|There was a {{significant}} difference in painting trends between the Northern Song period (960–1127) and Southern Song period (1127–1279). The paintings of Northern Song officials were influenced by their political ideals of bringing order to the world and tackling the largest issues affecting the whole of their society, hence their paintings often depicted huge, sweeping landscapes. On the other hand, Southern Song officials were more interested in reforming society from the bottom up and on a much smaller scale, a method they believed had a better chance for eventual success. Hence, their paintings often focused on smaller, visually closer, and more intimate scenes, while the background was often depicted as bereft of detail as a realm without substance or concern for the artist or viewer. This <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>attitude</b> from one era to the next stemmed largely from the rising influence of Neo-Confucian philosophy. Adherents to Neo-Confucianism focused on reforming society from the bottom up, not the top down, which can be seen in their efforts to promote small private academies during the Southern Song instead of the large state-controlled academies seen in the Northern Song era.|$|E

25|$|In 2008, however, Sam Ramji, {{the then}} head of open source {{software}} strategy in Microsoft, began working closely with Bill Gates to develop a pro-open source attitude within the software industry as well as Microsoft itself. Ramji, before leaving the company in 2009, built Microsoft's familiarity and involvement with open source, which is evident in Microsoft's contributions of open source code to Windows Azure, “its new-age web service for building and hosting applications on the net”, among other projects. These contributions would have been previously unimaginable by Microsoft. Microsoft’s <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>attitude</b> about open source and efforts to build a stronger open source community is evidence of the growing adoption and adaption of open source.|$|E
25|$|In 2016 an {{interview}} within the book De dybeste rødder (en: The Deepest Roots) she showed, according to historians at Saxo instituttet, a <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>attitude</b> to immigration towards a more restrictive stance. She {{stated that the}} Danish people should have more explicitly clarified the rules and values of Danish culture {{in order to be}} able to teach them to new arrivals. Further stated that the Danes in general have underestimated the difficulties involved in successful integration of immigrants, exemplified with the rules of a democracy not being clarified to Muslim immigrants and a lack of readiness to enforce those rules. This was received as a change in line with the attitude of the Danish people.|$|E
25|$|Cromwell's {{treatment}} of Kilkenny and Clonmel {{is in contrast}} to that of Drogheda and Wexford. Despite the fact that his troops had suffered heavy casualties attacking the former two, Cromwell respected surrender terms which guaranteed the lives and property of the townspeople and the evacuation of armed Irish troops who were defending them. The <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>attitude</b> {{on the part of the}} Parliamentarian commander may have been a recognition that excessive cruelty was prolonging Irish resistance. However, in the case of Drogheda and Wexford no surrender agreement had been negotiated, and by the rules of continental siege warfare prevalent in the mid-17th century, this meant no quarter would be given; thus it can be argued that Cromwell's attitude had not changed.|$|E

25|$|After a 1976 {{report by}} the United States National Academy of Sciences {{concluded}} that credible scientific evidence supported the ozone depletion hypothesis a few countries, including the United States, Canada, Sweden, Denmark, and Norway, moved to eliminate the use of CFCs in aerosol spray cans. At the time this was widely regarded {{as a first step}} towards a more comprehensive regulation policy, but progress in this direction slowed in subsequent years, due to a combination of political factors (continued resistance from the halocarbon industry and a general <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>attitude</b> towards environmental regulation during {{the first two years of}} the Reagan administration) and scientific developments (subsequent National Academy assessments that indicated that the first estimates of the magnitude of ozone depletion had been overly large).|$|E
25|$|From around 70 AD {{colourless}} glass becomes the predominant material for fine wares, and the cheaper glasses move towards pale shades of blue, green, and yellow. Debate continues whether {{this change in}} fashion indicates a <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>attitude</b> that placed glass as individual material of merit no longer required to imitate precious stones, ceramics, or metal, or whether the shift to {{colourless glass}} indicated an attempt to mimic highly prized rock crystal. Pliny's Natural History states that “the most highly valued glass is colourless and transparent, {{as closely as possible}} resembling rock crystal” (36, 192), which is thought to support this last position, as is evidence for the persistence of casting as a production technique, which produced the thickly walled vessels necessary to take the pressure of extensive cutting and polishing associated with crystal working.|$|E
25|$|An {{economic}} transition {{occurred during}} this period, {{due to the}} diversity of the service sector being far greater than any other previous or contemporary society, and the high degree of economic integration between the labour force and the economy. Islamic society also experienced a <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>attitude</b> towards manual labour. In previous civilizations such as ancient Greece and in contemporary civilizations such as early medieval Europe, intellectuals saw manual labour in a negative light and looked down on them with contempt. This resulted in technological stagnation as they did not see the need for machinery to replace manual labour. In the Islamic world, however, manual labour was seen in a far more positive light, as intellectuals such as the Brethren of Purity likened them to a participant in the act of creation, while Ibn Khaldun alluded to the benefits of manual labour to the progress of society.|$|E

25|$|During the 1980s and 1990s, {{while the}} inflow of foreign workers {{remained}} steady, the demographic composition of these migration flows changed. While the initial {{part of the}} third wave mainly brought Arab migrant workers to the Gulf region, their numbers declined during the 1980s and 1990s as they were replaced with Southeast Asian migrants. In comparison, there were approximately 2.000.000 migrant workers in the oil-producing countries, of which 68% were Arab workers, while in 1983 {{the total number of}} migrant workers had risen to 5.000.000, of which only 55% were Arab migrants. More specifically, in Saudi Arabia the number of Arab migrant workers decreased from 90% to 32% between 1975 and 1985. This change in composition was caused by a <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>attitude</b> towards Arab foreign workers. At first, the shared language, religion and culture were seen as benefits by the GCC states. Nevertheless, the rise of Pan-Arabism in the region heightened authorities' fears of political activism and anti-government activities by Arab migrants. Furthermore, the authorities feared that the often low-educated Arab migrants would corrupt the culture of the Gulf states. Thus Asia, and specifically India, became the obvious solution for the GCC countries, considering the historical ties, the geographical proximity and the abundance of workers willing to migrate to the Gulf region. Although the majority of migrants to the GCC today come from either Asia or other Middle Eastern countries, with India making up the highest number, a high number of North Americans and Europeans also migrate to the GCC region. Especially Kuwait and Oman constitute a target destination for high-skilled workers mainly from the United States, the United Kingdom, Denmark, Sweden and France. All in all, the third wave has resulted in that more than 50% of the workforce in any of the GCC countries consists of migrant workers.|$|E

[...] Alternatively, this <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>attitude</b> amongst the Allies (who had waited patiently {{off the coast of}} Salamis for at least a week while Athens was captured) may have been in response to Persian offensive maneuvers.
