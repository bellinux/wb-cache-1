5|$|Balabushka <b>cues</b> <b>from</b> the Gus Szamboti era are {{typified by}} {{straight}} grained maple forearms bearing four ebony points, with four veneers included, normally colored black, green, white and mahogany, or sometimes with an orange veneer {{in place of}} mahogany. Balabushka <b>cues</b> <b>from</b> this era, spanning {{the last five years}} of his life, are considered the finest of his career as a class. There have been unconfirmed rumors that some few cues made during this period included splices made by Balabushka himself.|$|E

5|$|A {{successor}} for the C3 Picasso {{was revealed}} in 2017 {{as the new}} C3 Aircross, and revealed at the Geneva Motor Show in March as the C-Aircross Concept, with an expected launch in late 2017. Auto Express reported the vehicle is taking design <b>cues</b> <b>from</b> the C-Aircross Concept, and will {{make the transition from}} MPV to an SUV design.|$|E
5|$|Another {{addition}} to the fighting force debuting in Halo 2 were Drones, or Yanme'e (from the planet Palamok); the animators found the creatures challenging, as {{they had to be}} animated to walk, run, crawl, or fly on multiple surfaces. Old concept art from Combat Evolved was re-purposed in influencing the Drone's final shape, which took <b>cues</b> <b>from</b> cockroaches, grasshoppers, and wasps.|$|E

5|$|The soundtrack in MediEvil: Resurrection is orchestrated, {{unlike the}} first instalment. Approximately {{half of the}} themes from the {{original}} were removed while new themes were created to fit with the new levels. The music is split into two halves; the <b>cues</b> <b>from</b> the first half are largely reminiscent of a select number of <b>cues</b> <b>from</b> the original game {{with the addition of}} extra thematic elements to strengthen them. The other half of the music is original and composed exclusively for Resurrection. The new soundtrack was composed by Bob & Barn and features performances from members of the City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra that was recorded in the Czech Republic. The orchestra, headed by Nic Raine, consisted of approximately 80 performers and in addition benefits from a 32 piece choir, also recorded in the same venue. This was in similar vain to SCE Cambridge Studio's previous orchestral game Primal, which was also recorded in Prague by the same performers.|$|E
5|$|Dead reckoning, {{in animals}} usually known as path integration, means the putting {{together}} of <b>cues</b> <b>from</b> different sensory sources within the body, {{without reference to}} visual or other external landmarks, to estimate position relative to a known starting point continuously while travelling on a path {{that is not necessarily}} straight. Seen as a problem in geometry, the task is to compute the vector to a starting point by adding the vectors for each leg of the journey from that point.|$|E
5|$|N. T. Rama Rao and Akkineni Nageswara Rao {{were chosen}} as the male leads, making Gundamma Katha their 10th film together; the film was Rama Rao's 100th film as an actor and Nageswara Rao's 99th as an actor. Savitri and Jamuna were {{chosen as the}} female leads. Jamuna's character, Saroja, was created by Chakrapani for the film, taking <b>cues</b> <b>from</b> The Taming of the Shrew. S. V. Ranga Rao, Ramana Reddy and Rajanala Kaleswara Rao were cast in {{supporting}} roles. Haranath and L. Vijayalakshmi were chosen to play Gundamma's son and daughter-in-law respectively. M. Pithambaram and T. P. Bhaktavatsalam provided the make-up.|$|E

5|$|Since Darwin's On the Origins of Certain Instincts (quoted above) in 1873, path {{integration}} {{has been}} shown to be important to navigation in animals including ants, rodents and birds. When vision (and hence the use of remembered landmarks) is not available, such as when animals are navigating on a cloudy night, in the open ocean, or in relatively featureless areas such as sandy deserts, path integration must rely on idiothetic <b>cues</b> <b>from</b> within the body.|$|E
5|$|A 2016 {{study by}} {{independent}} environmental consulting group FishBio {{showed that the}} artificial spring pulse flows from New Melones Dam do fairly little to support salmon and steelhead out-migration in the Stanislaus River. Rather, the fish take their <b>cues</b> <b>from</b> increased water flow due to rainfall, as they naturally would have before the many dams on the Stanislaus River were built. In the spring of 2016 about 12,500 juvenile salmon migrated downriver to the sea during April and May, but less than 1percent migrated during the pulse flow. In years of drought when the lake level is low, releasing water during the spring creates consequences {{later in the year}} – because there is not enough cold water left for the autumn spawning run.|$|E
5|$|In March 2013 it was {{announced}} that Feyenoord signed a four-year deal which would make Opel the club's main sponsor and would return the name Opel to its match kit beginning {{at the start of the}} 2013–14 season. It marks a return for Opel as Feyenoord's main sponsor, a position it held from 1984 to 1989. The match kits for the new season were presented in April 2013. The home jersey was similar to the previous season version with an updated sponsor name. The away kit took design <b>cues</b> <b>from</b> the white and green colours of the flag of Rotterdam and incorporates the coat of arms of Rotterdam on the side of the jersey.|$|E

5|$|In {{works from}} Jeux vénitiens, Lutosławski wrote long {{passages}} {{in which the}} parts of the ensemble are not to be synchronised exactly. At <b>cues</b> <b>from</b> the conductor each instrumentalist may be instructed to move straight on to the next section, to finish their current section before moving on, or to stop. In this way the random elements within compositionally controlled limits defined by the term aleatory are carefully directed by the composer, who controls the architecture and harmonic progression of the piece precisely. Lutosławski notated the music exactly; there is no improvisation, no choice of parts is given to any instrumentalist, and there is thus no doubt about how the musical performance is to be realised.|$|E
5|$|Resident Evil 4 {{redefined the}} {{survival}} horror genre by emphasizing reflexes and precision aiming, thus broadening the gameplay {{of the series}} with elements from the wider action game genre. However, this also led some reviewers {{to suggest that the}} Resident Evil series had abandoned the survival horror genre, by demolishing the genre conventions that it had established. Other major survival horror series followed suit, by developing their combat systems to feature more action, such as Silent Hill Homecoming and the 2008 version of Alone in the Dark. These changes represent an overall trend among console games shifting towards visceral action gameplay. While working on The Last of Us, Naughty Dog took <b>cues</b> <b>from</b> Resident Evil 4, particularly the tension and action.|$|E
5|$|Rodents {{are able}} to {{recognize}} close relatives by smell and this allows them to show nepotism (preferential behavior toward their kin) and also avoid inbreeding. This kin recognition is by olfactory <b>cues</b> <b>from</b> urine, feces and glandular secretions. The main assessment may involve the MHC, where the degree of relatedness of two individuals is correlated to the MHC genes they have in common. In non-kin communication, where more permanent odor markers are required, as at territorial borders, then non-volatile major urinary proteins (MUPs), which function as pheromone transporters, may also be used. MUPs may also signal individual identity, with each male house mouse (Mus musculus) excreting urine containing about a dozen genetically encoded MUPs.|$|E

5|$|Serrate {{used the}} Mk. IV {{equipment}} for reception and display, replacing only the receiver unit. This could be switched {{in or out}} of the circuit from the cockpit, which turned off the transmitter as well. In a typical interception, the radar operator would use Serrate to track the German fighter, using the directional <b>cues</b> <b>from</b> the displays to direct the pilot on an intercept course. Range was not supplied, but the operator could make a rough estimate by observing the signal strength and the way the signals changed as the fighter maneuvered. After following Serrate to an estimated range of , the fighter's own radar would be turned on for the final approach.|$|E
5|$|The Blitz game mode was {{the result}} of experimenting with ideas for a fast-paced and {{accessible}} variation of RTS gameplay. The development team wanted to streamline mechanics, such as base building and resource management, that players typically viewed as being complex and intimidating. The initial design of Blitz involved players having an army roster, like in tabletop war games. After playtesting this version, they realized that the scale of battles would shrink and become less appealing {{over the course of the}} match. They revised the mode by implementing a card-and-deck system for unit deployment and introducing randomly spawning resources on the maps. Blitz was influenced by the Warzone game mode from Halo 5: Guardians and Blizzard Entertainment's collectible card game Hearthstone, taking design <b>cues</b> <b>from</b> the card collecting and deck building systems. 343 Industries' head of strategy games Dan Ayoub cited the multiplayer online battle arena genre as impactful on the design of Blitz, since games in the genre replaced resource management with individual unit combat.|$|E
