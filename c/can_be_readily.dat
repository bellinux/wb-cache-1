5|$|Superficial or surface anatomy is {{important}} as the study of anatomical landmarks that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>readily</b> seen from the exterior contours of the body.

5|$|In {{laboratory}} experiments, octopuses <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>readily</b> {{trained to}} distinguish between different shapes and patterns. They {{have been reported to}} practise observational learning, although the validity of these findings is contested. Octopuses have also been observed in what has been described as play: repeatedly releasing bottles or toys into a circular current in their aquariums and then catching them. Octopuses often break out of their aquariums and sometimes into others in search of food. They have even boarded fishing boats and opened holds to eat crabs. The veined octopus collects discarded coconut shells, then uses them to build a shelter, an example of tool use.|$|E

5|$|Inocybe maculata {{is similar}} to the {{variable}} Inocybe lacera, the split fibrecap, but it can be differentiated by the darker colouration of the cap, and the white remains of the veil in the centre of the cap. The species is also similar in appearance to Inocybe lanatodisca, but <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>readily</b> distinguished by odour (I.lanatodisca has a characteristic sweet, green-corn smell) and the colour of the cap (I.lanatodisca has a fulvous cap). It is closely related to Inocybe fastigiata, but can again be distinguished by colour; I.fastigiata has lighter coloured fibrils.|$|E
5|$|More {{representatives of}} the genus are present in Asia. At least nine species have been {{recorded}} from mainland India, some of which also overlap C.cinnabarinums range in Indonesia, Taiwan, or Japan. Many of these species <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>readily</b> distinguished by macroscopic features. C.japonicum is pinkish orange and lacks a gelatinous outer layer, while both C.jiangii and C.junghuhnii are brown. However, others require microscopic features of spore shape and ornamentation for identification. Unlike the uniformly elongated spores of C.cinnabarinum, C.guizhouense possesses both elliptical and globose spores. C.pengii differs primarily {{in the pattern of}} ornamentation on its spore surface.|$|E
5|$|Plants grow {{best in a}} moist but well-drained, acidic soil, {{with added}} peat being helpful. They may be grown in coastal gardens in a {{sheltered}} position, and generally require some degree of shade. Once established, plants can tolerate short dry spells. As they age, plants may become straggly, but benefit from hard pruning after fertilizing and watering, which promotes compact, bushier growth. Common heath can be short-lived and difficult to transplant, though it <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>readily</b> grown as a pot plant. Along {{with other members of}} the genus, Epacris impressa initially proved difficult to grow and maintain on original soil in the Australian National Botanic Gardens in Canberra.|$|E

5|$|Some silver {{compounds}} are very explosive, {{such as the}} nitrogen compounds silver azide, silver amide, and silver fulminate, as well as silver acetylide, silver oxalate, and silver(II) oxide. They can explode on heating, force, drying, illumination, or sometimes spontaneously. To avoid the formation of such compounds, ammonia and acetylene should be kept away from silver equipment. Salts of silver with strongly oxidising acids such as silver chlorate and silver nitrate can explode on contact with materials that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>readily</b> oxidised, such as organic compounds, sulfur and soot.|$|E
5|$|The cap is chestnut, rusty, olive brown, or {{dark brown}} {{in color and}} {{generally}} 4–10cm (rarely to 13cm) in diameter at maturity. The cap has a distinctive conical shape, later flattening out. It is slimy to the touch, bare, smooth, and glossy even when dry, and the cuticle is easily peeled off. The tiny, circular pores of the tubes are initially yellow but turn olive to dark yellow with maturity. Like {{the skin of the}} cap, they <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>readily</b> peeled away from the flesh.|$|E

This harmless shark <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>readily</b> maintained in captivity and is used as a model organism for biological research. It is caught incidentally, and generally discarded, by commercial fisheries. These activities do not appear to have negatively affected its population, leading it to be listed under Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E

Tricholoma lookalikes in the same geographic region grow at lower elevations, typically in autumn. T.portentosum has a gray cap, a stipe with yellow tints, and lacks a ring, while T.mutabile has violet tones in its cap and also lacks a ring. Other lookalikes include Hygrophorus subalpinus and H.camarophyllus, but these species have broad, waxy gills, and lack the characteristic odor of T.vernaticum.|$|E
5|$|Although {{contemporary}} {{sources are}} {{silent on the}} matter, {{it is more than}} likely that on Somairle's demise, his territory was divided amongst his surviving sons. The precise allotment of lands is unknown; even though the division of lands amongst later generations of meic Somairle <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>readily</b> discerned, such boundaries are unlikely to have existed during the chaotic twelfth century. It is possible that the territory of the first generation of meic Somairle may have stretched from Glenelg in the north, to the Mull of Kintyre in the south; with Áengus ruling in the north, Dubgall centred in Lorne (with possibly the bulk of the inheritance), and Ragnall in Kintyre and the southern islands.|$|E

5|$|Because {{germanium}} is transparent in {{the infrared}} wavelengths, {{it is an important}} infrared optical material that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>readily</b> cut and polished into lenses and windows. It is especially used as the front optic in thermal imaging cameras working in the 8 to 14micron range for passive thermal imaging and for hot-spot detection in military, mobile night vision, and fire fighting applications. It is used in infrared spectroscopes and other optical equipment that require extremely sensitive infrared detectors. It has a very high refractive index (4.0) and must be coated with anti-reflection agents. Particularly, a very hard special antireflection coating of diamond-like carbon (DLC), refractive index 2.0, is a good match and produces a diamond-hard surface that can withstand much environmental abuse.|$|E
5|$|Characteristic {{diagnostic}} {{features of}} Entoloma murrayi include the bright yellow coloring, the conical cap, cube-shaped spores, and club-shaped cheilocystidia. Entoloma quadratum {{is similar in}} size and morphology, but is colored salmon-orange. E.murrayi has the habit and form of some similarly colored mushrooms in the genus Hygrocybe (such as Hygrocybe marginata var. concolor), but it <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>readily</b> distinguished from those by its salmon-pink spore print, non-waxy gills, and the angular shape of its spores. Entoloma luteum is a duller yellow color, with a less distinctly pointed umbo. The South American species E.dennisii, originally misidentified as E.murrayi, can be distinguished from the latter by its less conical cap and considerably smaller spores that measure 5.5–7μm.|$|E
5|$|Harmless and docile, the thornback {{guitarfish}} <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>readily</b> approached underwater, and fares well {{in public}} aquariums. Off the United States, this ray is common and faces no substantial threats: {{it is only}} occasionally caught incidentally by commercial and recreational fishers, and has no economic value. As most of its range lies within US waters, the species has been assessed as Least Concern overall by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). However, in Mexican waters the thornback guitarfish population is small and fragmented, {{and the degree to}} which it is affected by fishing is uncertain. There, the IUCN has listed it locally under Data Deficient while noting its susceptibility to inshore lagoon fisheries and shrimp trawlers, and the urgent need for additional information to ensure its long-term regional survival.|$|E
