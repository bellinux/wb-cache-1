50|$|A {{number of}} {{currencies}} were official ISO 4217 <b>currency</b> <b>codes</b> and <b>currency</b> names until their replacement by the euro or other currencies. The {{table below shows}} the ISO <b>currency</b> <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> former <b>currencies</b> and their common names (which do not always match the ISO 4217 names). These codes were first introduced in 1989 after a request from the reinsurance sector in 1988 was accepted.|$|R
5|$|Platinum is a {{precious}} metal commodity; its bullion has the ISO <b>currency</b> <b>code</b> <b>of</b> XPT. Coins, bars, and ingots are traded or collected. Platinum finds use in jewellery, usually as a 90–95% alloy, {{due to its}} inertness. It is {{used for this purpose}} for its prestige and inherent bullion value. Jewellery trade publications advise jewellers to present minute surface scratches (which they term patina) as a desirable feature in attempt to enhance value of platinum products.|$|R
50|$|The ISO 4217 <b>currency</b> <b>code</b> <b>of</b> gold is XAU. Many {{holders of}} gold store it {{in form of}} bullion coins or bars as a hedge against {{inflation}} or other economic disruptions. Modern bullion coins for investment or collector purposes do not require good mechanical wear properties; they are typically fine gold at 24k, although the American Gold Eagle and the British gold sovereign continue to be minted in 22k (0.92) metal in historical tradition, and the South African Krugerrand, first released in 1967, is also 22k (0.92).|$|R
5|$|The largest use of {{palladium}} {{today is}} in catalytic converters. Palladium {{is also used}} in jewelry, dentistry, watch making, blood sugar test strips, aircraft spark plugs, surgical instruments, and electrical contacts. Palladium {{is also used to}} make professional transverse (concert or classical) flutes. As a commodity, palladium bullion has ISO <b>currency</b> <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> XPD and 964. Palladium is one of only four metals to have such codes, the others being gold, silver and platinum. Because it absorbs hydrogen, palladium is a key component of the controversial cold fusion experiments that began in 1989.|$|R

2500|$|In October 2005, {{the head}} of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, Dr. Gideon Gono, {{announced}} that Zimbabwe would have a new currency the following year, and new banknotes and coins would be produced. However, in June 2006, it was decreed that, for a new currency to be viable, Zimbabwe had to first achieve macro-economic stability (i.e., double digit inflation). Instead, in August 2006, the first dollar was redenominated to the second dollar at the rate of 1000 first dollars to 1 second dollar (1000:1). At the same time, the currency was devalued against the US dollar, from 101000 first dollars (101 once revalued) to 250 second dollars, a decrease of about 60% (see exchange rate history table below). ISO originally assigned a new <b>currency</b> <b>code</b> <b>of</b> ZWN to this redenominated currency, but the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe could not deal with a currency change, so the <b>currency</b> <b>code</b> remained 'ZWD'. The revaluation campaign, which Gideon Gono named [...] "Operation Sunrise", was completed on 21 August 2006. It was estimated that some ten trillion old Zimbabwe dollars (22% of the money supply) were not redeemed during this period.|$|R
25|$|The in-game {{economy in}} Eve Online {{is an open}} economy that is largely player-driven. Non-player {{character}} (NPC) merchants sell skill books used by players to learn new skills and blueprints to manufacture ships and modules. NPC merchants also buy and sell Trade Goods. Some Trade Goods are only for trade between NPC merchants while others have a functional use and are not good for trade with NPC's. The characters themselves gather the necessary raw materials to manufacture {{almost all of the}} ships and ship modules in the game. NPC ships can be looted and salvaged for items and materials. Non-player created ships and equipment may be purchased from various NPC factions as a character gains status with them, and can be resold in the in-game economy. The in-game currency is ISK (Interstellar Kredits), which is also the <b>currency</b> <b>code</b> <b>of</b> the Icelandic króna, the real-world currency of Iceland, where the Eve Online development studio is located.|$|R

5|$|Today, silver bullion has the ISO 4217 <b>currency</b> <b>code</b> XAG, one <b>of</b> {{only four}} {{precious}} metals {{to have one}} (the others being palladium, platinum, and gold). Silver coins are produced from cast rods or ingots, rolled to the correct thickness, heat-treated, and then used to cut blanks from. These blanks are then milled and minted in a coining press; modern coining presses can produce 8000 silver coins per hour.|$|R
5000|$|South Africa {{introduced}} the Krugerrand in 1967 {{to cater to}} this market; this {{was the reason for}} its convenient and memorable gold content [...] - [...] exactly one troy ounce. It was the first modern, low-premium (i.e. priced only slightly above the bullion value of the gold) gold bullion coin. Bullion coins are also produced in fractions of an ounce [...] - [...] typically half ounce, quarter ounce, and one-tenth ounce. Bullion coins sometimes carry a face value as legal tender.The face value is minted on the coin, and it is done so in order to bestow legal tender status on a coin, which generally makes it easier to import or export across national borders, as well as subject to laws against counterfeiting. However, their real value is measured as dictated by their troy weight, the current market price of the precious metal contained, and the prevailing premium that market wishes to pay for those particular bullion coins. The face value is always significantly less than the bullion value of the coin. Legal tender bullion coins are a separate entity to bullion gold. One enjoys legal tender status, the latter is merely a raw commodity. Gold has an international <b>currency</b> <b>code</b> <b>of</b> XAU under ISO 4217. ISO 4217 includes codes not only for currencies, but also for precious metals (gold, silver, palladium and platinum; by definition expressed per one troy ounce.|$|R
5000|$|Currency pairs are {{sometimes}} then written by concatenating the ISO <b>currency</b> <b>codes</b> (ISO 4217) <b>of</b> the base currency and the counter currency, separating {{them with a}} slash character. Often the slash character is omitted, alternatively the slash may be replaced by and etc. A widely traded currency pair is {{the relation of the}} euro against the US dollar, designated as EUR/USD. The quotation EUR/USD 1.2500 means that one euro is exchanged for 1.2500 US dollars. Here, EUR is the base currency and USD is the quote currency(counter currency). This means that 1 Euro can be exchangeable to 1.25 US Dollars.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{practice}} of eco-design requires relating traditional design criteria to new environmental criteria. So far, {{few studies have}} investigated the nature and singularities of eco-design. This article provides some elements of response based upon the redesign of a consumer product (disposable razor). The study was conducted by three groups of experienced eco-designers using existing eco-design tools (SIMAPRO, ECOFAIRE, ECODESIGN PILOT). A protocol analysis with a three-level <b>coding</b> <b>of</b> <b>transactions</b> was carried out for this purpose. Two main findings are reported: (1) environmental assessment, solution finding and strategy definition are the activities which differentiate eco-design from design; (2) environmental initial assessment and strategy definition are more heavily influenced by eco-designers’ expertise than support from tools. Highlights► This study investigates the nature and singularities of eco-design compared to traditional design. ► A protocol analysis based on the observation of three experienced eco-designers' teams is conducted. ► Each team implements a different existing eco-design tool to redesign the same consumer product. ► Environmental assessment, solution finding and strategy definition appear to be specific to eco-design practice. ► Initial environmental assessment and strategy definition are heavily influenced by eco-designers' expertise...|$|R
40|$|Optimistic {{replication}} lets multiple users update local {{replicas of}} shared data independently. These replicas may diverge {{and must be}} reconciled. In this paper, we present a general-purpose reconciliation system for mobile transactions. The basic reconciliation engine treats reconciliation as an optimization problem. To direct the search, it relies on semantic information and user intents expressed as relations among mobile transactions. Unlike previous semantics-based reconciliation systems, our system includes a module that automatically infers semantic relations from the <b>code</b> <b>of</b> mobile <b>transactions.</b> Thus, {{it is possible to}} use semantics-based reconciliation without incurring the overhead of specifying the semantics of the data types or operations...|$|R
