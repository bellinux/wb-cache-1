5000|$|The EJ series flat-4 {{aluminium}} alloy engine, specially {{developed for the}} Legacy, was the most powerful engine Subaru had built to date, and the engine is currently offered in many configurations. In an attempt to ensure durability and longevity, Subaru chose to use five main crankshaft bearings. The engine has either single or double overhead camshaft architecture and pent-roof, cross flow cylinder firing chambers. The ignition utilized distributorless ignition, using a computer-controlled <b>coil</b> <b>pack</b> and spark plug wires to supply the electrical charge. Later versions of this engine used coil packs installed directly {{on top of the}} spark plug. Problems detected by the cars' on-board computers are signified by a [...] "check engine" [...] light, alerting the driver that maintenance is needed immediately. The air-fuel mixture is monitored by a mass air flow sensor and emissions are controlled by an oxygen sensor installed in front of a catalytic converter. It also uses reverse flow engine cooling, meaning cool water from the radiator entered the cylinder heads first and then exited through the top of the engine block back into the top of the radiator. The water flow was controlled by the thermostat which is located next to the water pump underneath the engine. Installing the thermostat in this position allows it to more accurately control the temperature of the water as it enters the engine from the cylinder heads first, thereby better preventing an occurrence of thermal shock.|$|E

We have replaced the collar functionality in our 14 Tesla R and D Nb{sub 3 }Sn dipole magnets with an assembly procedure based on an aluminum shell and bladders. Bladders, placed between the <b>coil</b> <b>pack</b> and surrounding yoke inside the shell, are pressurized up to 10 ksi [70 MPa] to create an interference gap. Keys placed into the interference gap replace the bladder functionality. Following the assembly, the bladders are deflated and removed.

During assembly, a force of 8. 2 x 10 {sup 5 } lbs/ft [12 MN/m] is generated by the bladders and the stress in the 1. 57 inch [40 mm] aluminum shell reaches 20. 3 ksi [140 MPa].

A total of 37 unruptured cerebral aneurysms treated with coiling were analyzed using follow-up angiograms, simulated CFD prior to coiling (control CFD), and porous media CFD. Coiled aneurysms were classified into stable or recurrence groups according to follow-up angiogram findings. Morphological parameters, <b>coil</b> <b>packing</b> density, and hemodynamic variables were evaluated for their correlations with aneurysmal recurrence. We also calculated residual flow volumes (RFVs), a novel hemodynamic parameter used to quantify the residual aneurysm volume after simulated coiling, which has a mean fluid domain > 1. 0 cm/s. Follow-up angiograms showed 24 aneurysms in the stable group and 13 in the recurrence group.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Endovascular coiling is a {{well-established}} therapy for treating intracra-nial aneurysms. Nonetheless, postoperative hemodynamic changes induced by this therapy remain not fully understood. The {{purpose of this}} work is to assess the influence of <b>coil</b> configuration and <b>packing</b> density on intra-aneurysmal hemodynamics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three 3 D rotational angiography images of 3 intracranial aneurysms before and after endovascular coiling were used. For each aneurysm, a 3 D representation of the vasculature was obtained after the segmentation of the images. Afterward, a virtual coiling technique was used to treat the aneurysm geometries with coil models.

40|$|Tight <b>coil</b> <b>packing</b> with {{density of}} at least 20 %- 25 % {{is known to be}} {{important}} for preventing recanalization after embolization of cerebral aneurysms. However, large aneurysms sometimes recanalize regardless of the packing density, suggesting that the absolute residual volume which is determined by aneurysm volume and packing density may be more important risk factor for recanalization. To validate this hypothesis, we analyzed the factors affecting the outcomes of treated aneurysms at our institute. We included 355 small and large aneurysms. The following six factors were obtained from every case: aneurysm volume (mL), neck size (mm), packing density (%), residual volume (mL), rupture status at presentation, and stent assistance (with or without stent). The data were then subjected to multivariate logistic regression analysis to identify significant risk factors for recanalization. Recanalization occurred in 61 aneurysms (17. 2 %). Significant predictors for recanalization were aneurysm volume (odds ratio, 15. 3; P < 0. 001) and residual volume (odds ratio, 30. 9; P < 0. 001), but not packing density (odds ratio, 0. 98; P = 0. 341). These results showed that for each 0. 1 -mL increase in aneurysm volume and residual volume, the risk of recanalization increased by 1. 3 times and 1. 4 times, respectively. The most influential risk factor for recanalization after coil embolization was residual volume, not packing density. The larger the aneurysm volume, the greater the packing density has to be to minimize the residual volume and risk of recanalization. Since tight <b>coil</b> <b>packing</b> has already been aimed, further innovation of coil property or embolization technique may be needed.

40|$|Typical {{treatment}} of intracranial aneurysm includes: surgical clipping, intrasacular packing, and parent artery occlusion.

30|$|Pulmonary {{arteriovenous}} malformations (PAVMs) are abnormal fistulous {{connections between}} pulmonary arteries and veins forming a venous sac.

According to the international guidelines for the diagnosis and management of HHT, transcatheter embolization is the first-line treatment for symptomatic PAVMs (Faughnan et al. 2011). For asymptomatic PAVMs, the feeding artery 3  mm or greater in diameter is generally considered as the size threshold for embolization, although embolization can be also performed in smaller feeding arteries.
