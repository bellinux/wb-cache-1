We review the existing means of detecting the transportation of dangerous materials and illicit objects and show that no systems are available that <b>completely</b> <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>requirements</b> of homeland security and are simultaneously cost-efficient for cargo inspection. The current equipment is either both bulky and very expensive, does not provide completely reliable inspection results, or demands a time-consuming inspection procedure requiring several types of scanner (which is unacceptable given the huge and permanently increasing volume of transported cargo). We compare various techniques of detecting the transportation of dangerous materials and illicit objects, discuss how they correspond to the current needs, and propose a possible solution to the existing serious problems. As {{the next step towards}} the reliable detection of dangerous materials in large cargoes we propose development of an integrated system that combines the best features of the most developed technologies; namely, X-ray analysis (providing the high-speed monitoring and identification of suspicious objects and areas) and neutron analysis (providing high selectivity and precise identification). Such a layered approach would allow the avoidance of the unnecessary scanning of all objects in the active interrogation mode, thus reducing the inspection time. Moreover, it makes it possible to clarify all suspicious areas in the container via a single system inspection.

The study was undertaken to evaluate multilevel designed carbonated hydroxyapatite (CHA) obtained by hydrothermal method, as a bone substitute in healing bone defects with or without corticosteroid treatment in rats as assessed by histopathologic methods. Methods. Bone defects were created in the alveolar bone by teeth extraction in 12 rats. The animals were initially divided into two groups. The experimental group was pretreated with corticosteroids: methylprednisolone and dexamethasone, intramuscularly, while the control group was without therapy. Posterior teeth extraction had been performed after the corticosteroid therapy. The extraction defects were fulfilled with hydroxyapatite with bimodal particle sizes {{in the range of}} 50 - 250 μm and the sample from postextocactional defect of the alveolar bone was analyzed pathohystologically. Results. The histopatological investigations confirmed the biologic properties of the applied material. The evident growth of new bone in the alveolar ridge was clearly noticed in both groups of rats. Carbonated HA obtained by hydrothermal method promoted bone formation in the preformed defects, confirming its efficacy for usage in bone defects. Complete resorption of the material’s particles took place after 25 weeks. Conclusion. Hydroxyapatite <b>completely</b> <b>meets</b> <b>the</b> clinical <b>requirements</b> for a bone substitute material.

A review of {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} these instruments are presented here. The review also includes commercially unavailable technology such as the electronic nose and the Tunable Diode Laser (TDL) IR Spectrometer. It was found that <b>the</b> TDL could <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> majority of these criteria including fast response, minimum maintenance, portability, and reasonable cost. An experiment was conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of such a system using an existing (non-portable) instrument. A lead-salt tunable diode laser, cooled to 85 degrees Kelvin was used to record direct absorption and second-derivative spectra of Hydrazine at several pressures to study the sensitivity to low levels of Hydrazine. Spectra of NH 3 and CO 2 were used for wavelength identification of the scanned region. With a pathlength of 80 m, detection sensitivities of about 1 ppb were achieved for hydrazine in dry nitrogen at a cell pressure of 100 mbar. For spectroscopic detection of Hydrazine, spectral regions including strong Ammonia or Carbon Dioxide lines must be avoided. Strong Hydrazine absorption features were identified at 940 /cm showing minimal contribution from Ammonia interferences as suitable candidates for Hydrazine gas detection. For the studies reported here, the particular laser diode could only cover the narrow regions near 962 /cm and 965 /cm where strong Ammonia interferences were expected. However, the high resolution (0. 001 /cm) of the TDL spectrometer allowed individual lines of Hydrazine to be identified away from interferences from either Ammonia or Carbon Dioxide, especially at lower pressures. A Hydrazine line was identified at 961. 75 /cm which was free from Ammonia absorption and would be suitable to monitor hydrazine levels. This paper also shows data on the degradation of the detectivity of Hydrazine with increasing pressure.

These are the Long-Term Agreements on Energy-Efficiency 2001 - 2012, the Energy-Efficiency Benchmarking Agreement, the Agreement on Glasshouse Cultivation and the Environment and the Agreement on Coal-Fired Power Stations and CO 2 -reduction. These voluntary agreements are used in the Netherlands to implement the Kyoto Protocol. The enforceability and enforcement of voluntary agreements and of voluntary climate agreements in particular has been tested against <b>the</b> <b>requirements</b> of <b>the</b> Dutch democratic rule-of-law state. These <b>requirements</b> are: <b>the</b> principle of legal certainty, the equality principle, <b>the</b> <b>requirement</b> that <b>the</b> authorities are bound by the law, the protection of fundamental rights, the principle of democracy, judicial control and the principle of serving the government. In general, it may be concluded that the enforceability of voluntary environmental agreements under the law currently in force to a certain degree fulfils or is able to fulfil <b>the</b> <b>requirements</b> set for enforceability by the democratic rule of law principles. This general statement is supported by the analysis of the four voluntary climate agreements. It further generally emerges that the parties to a voluntary agreement are quite free to determine to what extent they will give substance to aspects of enforceability and that for this reason it is nog guaranteed that <b>the</b> <b>requirements</b> of <b>the</b> democratic rule of law will be respected. This also emerges from the analysis of the four voluntary climate agreements. If the parties fail to fulfil these requirements, they do not immediately act contrary to objective law. Also because of tensions between the application of democratic rule-of-law requirements it is not always possible to <b>completely</b> <b>meet</b> all <b>the</b> <b>requirements</b> set. If possible, a balance should be found in applying these <b>requirements</b> then. Overviewing <b>the</b> various possible paths to enforcement it can generally be concluded that in theory at least sufficient possibilities exist for both actual parties and third parties to enforce obligations from voluntary environmental agreements and that it is clear which enforcement mechanisms may be applied. The enforcement mechanisms cannot, however, just be applied simultaneously or consecutively; there are issues of harmonization between the different mechanisms. Furthermore, it is too a large extent dependent upon the parties to what degree the possibilities for enforcement method can and will be used...|$|R
