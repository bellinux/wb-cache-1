5|$|<b>Coney</b> Island–Stillwell Avenue (also {{known as}} <b>Coney</b> Island Terminal and signed on some trains as either <b>Coney</b> Island or Stillwell Avenue) is a New York City Subway {{terminal}} in <b>Coney</b> Island, Brooklyn, {{acting as the}} railroad-south terminus for the D, F, N, and Q trains. The large facility, originally built in 1919, was designed {{at a time when}} <b>Coney</b> Island was the primary summer resort area for the New York metropolitan area, with all of the rail lines in southern Brooklyn funneling service to the area. It {{is one of the largest}} elevated transportation terminals in the world.|$|E
5|$|Rail {{transportation}} to <b>Coney</b> Island had been available since 1864. The Brooklyn, Bath and <b>Coney</b> Island Railroad {{was the first}} steam railroad to <b>Coney</b> Island. It ran from Fifth Avenue and 36th Street {{in what is now}} Sunset Park, to its West End Terminal, at the present-day <b>Coney</b> Island Terminal's location, along what is now the right-of-way of the West End Line. The nearby Culver Depot, along the Atlantic Ocean waterfront near the site of the present-day West Eighth Street station, served the Brooklyn, Flatbush, and <b>Coney</b> Island Railway (now the Brighton Line) and Prospect Park and <b>Coney</b> Island Railroad (now the Culver Line). Other rail transportation included the Manhattan Beach Railroad; the Sea Beach Railroad; the <b>Coney</b> Island and Brooklyn Railroad; and Long Island City via the Long Island Rail Road.|$|E
5|$|<b>Coney</b> Island–Stillwell Avenue {{has eight}} tracks and four island platforms, with trains {{entering}} from both compass north and south. It {{is located at}} the corner of Stillwell and Surf Avenues in <b>Coney</b> Island, the site of the former West End Terminal. Geographically, the station is the southernmost terminal in the New York City Subway system.|$|E
50|$|In September 1941, 59-year-old Theodore <b>Coneys</b> {{intended}} to ask former acquaintance Philip Peters for a handout {{at his home}} on 3335 West Moncrieff Place in Denver, Colorado. <b>Coneys</b> broke into the house in Peters' absence to steal food and money. In the ceiling of a closet, <b>Coneys</b> found a small trapdoor {{that led to a}} narrow attic cubbyhole and decided to occupy the small space without Peters' knowledge. <b>Coneys</b> lived in the house undiscovered for about five weeks. On October 17, 1941, Peters discovered <b>Coneys</b> at the refrigerator. Peters struck at <b>Coneys</b> with a cane he carried, but <b>Coneys</b> clubbed him with an old pistol he had found in the house. After the gun broke apart, <b>Coneys</b> continued the battery with a heavy iron stove shaker and bludgeoned the 73-year-old Peters to death. <b>Coneys</b> then returned to the attic cubbyhole.|$|R
50|$|Theodore <b>Coneys</b> {{was born}} November 10, 1882 in Petersburg, Illinois to T. H. <b>Coneys,</b> a Canadian {{immigrant}} {{who owned a}} hardware store in Petersburg, and his wife. After the elder <b>Coneys</b> died in 1888, Mrs. <b>Coneys</b> and her son moved to a farm near Beloit, Wisconsin, then to Denver, Colorado in 1907, where {{she worked as a}} housekeeper at the Denver Democratic Club. She died in 1911.|$|R

5|$|Gone to <b>Coney</b> Island and Booming Business are two 1910 American silent short comedy {{productions}} by the Thanhouser Company. Both {{were released}} {{together on a}} single film reel on July 5, 1910. Gone to <b>Coney</b> Island is a comedy that features <b>Coney</b> Island, which the mere subject would make for a successful film. Booming Business {{may have been the}} very type of slapstick comedy that Edwin Thanhouser specifically said the Thanhouser Company would not produce. The productions of both films have no credits for the cast or crew, but possible candidates for these roles exist. Reviews of the films favored Gone to <b>Coney</b> Island, but some reviewers specifically refused to explain the plot because <b>Coney</b> Island subjects were deemed self-explanatory. Booming Business received one detailed review in The New York Dramatic Mirror which was negative. The films are presumed lost.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} Culver Line {{was opened}} by the Prospect Park and <b>Coney</b> Island Railroad {{and was named}} after the railroad's builder, Andrew N. Culver. The line ran along the surface of McDonald Avenue (then Gravesend Avenue) from Greenwood Cemetery (where it connected with horse car lines including the Vanderbilt Avenue Line, operated by the PP until 1886) to the Culver Depot in <b>Coney</b> Island, on June 25, 1875. The PP began serving the Union Depot at 36th Street, where transfer {{could be made to}} the Fifth Avenue Elevated, on June 7, 1890, by using the Prospect Park and South Brooklyn Railroad from a junction at Parkville. During a period of Long Island Rail Road control, from 1893 to 1899, a ramp at 36th Street was opened in 1895, allowing Brooklyn Elevated Railroad trains to operate over the Culver Line to <b>Coney</b> Island. The Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT), by then the owner of the Brooklyn Elevated, leased the Culver Line (to the Brooklyn Heights Railroad) on June 18, 1899, and began using it to take not only elevated trains but also trolleys to <b>Coney</b> Island.|$|E
5|$|Upon this station's {{opening the}} routes of the B and D were rerouted via the new connection. BB trains were relabeled the B, {{and began to}} run to <b>Coney</b> Island via the Chrystie Street Connection, the Manhattan Bridge north tracks, Fourth Avenue Line express tracks, and the West End Line. D trains were rerouted from the Culver Line to run to <b>Coney</b> Island via the new Sixth Avenue express tracks, the Chrystie Street Connection, the Manhattan Bridge north tracks, and the Brighton Line.|$|E

5|$|At Ditmas Avenue, the Culver Ramp {{ends and}} the {{underground}} line becomes elevated. This is a three-track Dual Contracts elevated on the former BMT line over McDonald (formerly Gravesend) Avenue. Just before the station, the southbound local track merges into the southbound express track, while the northbound express track becomes the El's bidirectional center express track. During the 1990s and 2000s, the center express track in this section was occasionally used for non-revenue testing. After Avenue X station, a ramp diverges to the surface {{for access to the}} Culver Yard of the <b>Coney</b> Island Yards complex. At this point the Culver Line narrows to a two-track structure bearing one more station–Neptune Avenue–before curving into West Eighth Street–New York Aquarium station on <b>Coney</b> Island.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1910s, a {{completely}} reconstructed New West End Terminal (which gradually became {{better known as}} <b>Coney</b> Island Terminal) was built on an elevated structure. The new terminal unified the terminals {{of most of the}} former steam railroad lines terminating at <b>Coney</b> Island, aside from the Long Island Rail Road-controlled New York and Manhattan Beach Railway. This new terminal could accommodate hundreds of thousands of passengers a day. This project entailed rerouting the Brighton and Culver Lines from a ground-level alignment to an elevated structure with four tracks and eight platforms.|$|E

50|$|<b>Coneys</b> {{suffered}} from poor health {{and had been}} told by doctors not to expect to see his 18th birthday, so he did not finish high school. As an adult, he worked as a bookkeeper at the Denver Brass Works and in advertising and sales, yet spent much of his adult life homeless. <b>Coneys</b> resented the way he was treated by others for his frail condition, later expressing that he wanted a place where he could be alone and free from the judgment of others.|$|R

5|$|Each {{platform}} has two same-level fare control areas, one {{at either}} end of the station, and there are no crossovers or crossunders. The full-time ones are at the north end and each has a turnstile bank, token booth, and two street stairs. The ones on the Manhattan-bound platform go up to the northeast and southeast corners of Bergen and Smith Streets while those on the <b>Coney</b> Island-bound platform go up to the northwest and southwest corners. The fare control areas on the south end of the platforms are unstaffed, containing full height turnstiles and one street stair to the northeast corner of Warren and Smith Streets on the Manhattan-bound platform and the northwest corner for the <b>Coney</b> Island-bound platform. The south fare control area is more heavily used.|$|E
5|$|In 1956, {{residents}} of <b>Coney</b> Island protested against paying a {{transfer to the}} bus on Mermaid Avenue (now the B74 bus to Sea Gate), with some saying that the 15-cent fee for transferring should be abolished because the bus was essentially an adjunct to the station. In 1979, the City Planning Commission proposed something similar, in that <b>Coney</b> Island residents would get a free transfer between the /B74 bus routes and the subway station. It was noted that the station {{was the only one}} that did not get a free bus transfer after the corresponding subway transfer was discontinued (in sharp contrast to the BMT Culver Line, BMT Myrtle Avenue Line, and IRT Third Avenue Line, which were discontinued but replaced by bus transfers). The free transfers would allow a $200 million apartment complex nearby, funded by the government, to get more residents to move in, as well as diversify Mark Twain Junior High School and attract a stable middle class.|$|E

5|$|North of the station, tracks 7 and 6 {{merge into}} one track (with a switch from track 7 to track 8), tracks 5 through 2 merge into another track, and tracks 1 and 8 stay separate, {{so that there}} is a four-tracked {{structure}} when the BMT West End Line and BMT Sea Beach Line cross the <b>Coney</b> Island Creek. Before the structure crosses the creek, all four tracks have switches that connect the tracks to each other, before the West End and Sea Beach Lines split. Tracks from these lines then lead into <b>Coney</b> Island Yard. South of the station, tracks 4, 5, and 6 stay separate from the other tracks (with a pair of switches between tracks 5 and 6) and tracks 1, 2, and 3 merge and have a diamond crossover with track 4. Tracks 3 and 4 (the Brighton Line tracks) are above tracks 5 and 6 (the Culver Line tracks) at this point.|$|E
5|$|Originally, the Chrysler Building was the Reynolds Building, {{a project}} of real estate {{developer}} and former New York State Senator William H. Reynolds. Prior to his involvement in planning the building, Reynolds was best known for developing <b>Coney</b> Island's Dreamland amusement park. However, when the amusement park was destroyed in a fire in 1911, Reynolds turned his attention to Manhattan real estate, where {{he set out to}} build the tallest building in the world.|$|E
5|$|The Great Blizzard of 1888 helped {{demonstrate}} {{the benefits of}} an underground transportation system. A plan {{for the construction of}} the subway was approved in 1894, and construction began in 1900. The first underground line of the subway opened on October 27, 1904, almost 36 years after the opening of the first elevated line in New York City, which became the IRT Ninth Avenue Line. The fare was $0.05 and on the first day the trains carried over 150,000 passengers. The oldest structure still in use opened in 1885 as part of the BMT Lexington Avenue Line in Brooklyn and is now part of the BMT Jamaica Line. The oldest right-of-way, {{which is part of the}} BMT West End Line near <b>Coney</b> Island Creek, was in use in 1864 as a steam railroad called the Brooklyn, Bath and <b>Coney</b> Island Rail Road.|$|E
