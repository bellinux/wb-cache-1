50|$|Some {{formulations}} are ohmic {{until at}} least 250 kV/cm (25 MV/m), after which current grows exponentially with field strength before reaching avalanche breakdown; but PZT exhibits time-dependent dielectric breakdown — breakdown may occur under <b>constant-voltage</b> <b>stress</b> after minutes to hours, depending on voltage and temperature, so its dielectric strength depends on the time scale over which it is measured. Other formulations have dielectric strengths measured in the 8-16 MV/m range.|$|E
40|$|Lee, Yi-Mu. Breakdown and {{reliability}} of CMOS devices with stacked oxide/nitride and oxynitride gate dielectrics prepared by RPECVD. (Under the direction of Professor Gerald Lucovsky) Remote-plasma-enhanced CVD (RPECVD) silicon nitride and silicon oxynitride alloys have been proposed to be the attractive alternatives to replace conventional oxides as the CMOS logic and memory technology node is scaled beyond 100 nm. This dissertation {{is focused on the}} degradation and breakdown of RPECVD stacked oxide/nitride (O/N) and oxynitride gate dielectrics under constant-current stress (CCS) and <b>constant-voltage</b> <b>stress</b> (CVS). By monitoring the time-to-breakdown of the dielectrics, the device reliability can be determined and further used to evaluate the dielectric quality and the scaling limits of the dielectric thickness. It is found that the breakdown behavior of the gate oxide and RPECVD gate dielectrics is influenced by the degree of boron penetration, which in turn leads to increases in the gate leakage current. During electrical stresses, positive charges and hole trapping are generated at the Si/SiO 2 interface and also in the dielectric layer...|$|E
40|$|Several {{breakdown}} {{events and}} multilevel current fluctuations {{have been observed}} when ultrathin SiO 2 films are subjected to <b>constant‐voltage</b> <b>stresses.</b> These breakdown events are sometimes reversible, and consist in a local change of conduction mechanism. This reversibility shows that no catastrophic thermal effects occur, and that the breakdown is only a local switching between two oxide conduction states of very different conductivities...|$|R
40|$|SiO 2 or Cu-doped SiO 2 (Cu:SiO 2) {{insulating}} films {{combined with}} Cu or W upper electrodes were constructed on the W/Si substrates {{to form the}} conductive-bridging RAM (CB-RAM) cells. The CB-RAMs were then subjected to a <b>constant-voltage</b> <b>stressing</b> (CVS) at room temperature. The experimental {{results show that the}} room-temperature CVS treatment can effectively affect the current conduction behavior and stabilize the resistive switching of the memory cells. After the CVS, the current conduction mechanisms in the high resistance state during the set process of the Cu/Cu:SiO 2 /W cell can be changed from Ohm’s law and the space charge limited conduction to Ohm’s law, the Schottky emission, and the space charge limited conduction. Presumably, it is due to the breakage of the conduction filaments during the CVS treatment that the conduction electrons cannot go back to the back electrode smoothly...|$|R
40|$|Atomic-layer-deposited SnO 2 {{is used as}} a gate {{electrode}} to replace indium tin oxide (ITO) in thin-film transistors and circuits for the first time. The SnO 2 films deposited at 200 °C show low electrical resistivity of ≈ 3. 1 × 10 − 3 Ω cm with ≈ 93 % transparency in most of the visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum. Thin-film transistors fabricated with SnO 2 gates show excellent transistor properties including saturation mobility of 15. 3 cm 2 V− 1 s− 1, a low subthreshold swing of ≈ 130 mV dec− 1, a high on/off ratio of ≈ 109, and an excellent electrical stability under <b>constant-voltage</b> <b>stressing</b> conditions to the gate terminal. Moreover, the SnO 2 -gated thin-film transistors show excellent electrical characteristics when used in electronic circuits such as negative channel metal oxide semiconductor (NMOS) inverters and ring oscillators. The NMOS inverters exhibit a low propagation stage delay of ≈ 150 ns with high DC voltage gain of ≈ 382. A high oscillation frequency of ≈ 303 kHz is obtained from the output sinusoidal signal of the 11 -stage NMOS inverter-based ring oscillators. These results show that SnO 2 can effectively replace ITO in transparent electronics and sensor applications...|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{shrinking}} {{of the device}} size in integrated circuits together {{with the use of}} novel, less stable low-k back-end-of-line dielectrics more attention has to be paid to the time dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB) effect. In this work the TDDB mechanisms are investigated and modeled based on <b>constant-voltage</b> bias-temperature <b>stress</b> (BTS) experiments from the 90 nm and 45 nm technology nodes. The modeling of the I-t dependencies is based on the numerical model of Haase in which it is assumed that the degradation of the dielectric is caused just by the electronic leakage current itself. By two simple modifications of the model and an adjustment of several model parameters it was possible to achieve a very good agreement between the model and the experiment for single constant-voltage BTS dependencies. For two different experimental data sets from the 45 nm technology node the TDDB behavior in dependence on the bias voltage and temperature is analyzed and compared with the results of the modified Haase model and the Poole-Frenkel lifetime model...|$|R
