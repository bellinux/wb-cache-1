5|$|In 1900, Hart's brother Walter {{travelled}} to South Africa {{for service}} with the Fourth <b>Contingent</b> in the Second Boer War. This inspired Hart {{to volunteer for}} the Eighth New Zealand South African <b>Contingent,</b> but his application was declined. However, he, along with another brother, George, successfully enlisted for the Ninth <b>Contingent.</b> The minimum age for volunteers was 20 and he falsified his age to enlist. By {{the time he reached}} South Africa in April 1902, the war was effectively over. He was discharged in July 1902 with the rank of lance sergeant but travelled to England instead of returning to New Zealand {{with the rest of the}} <b>contingent.</b>|$|E
5|$|Instead, the {{argument}} considers the entire collection (jumla) of <b>contingent</b> things, {{the sum total}} of every <b>contingent</b> thing that exists, has existed, or will exist. Avicenna argues that this aggregate, too, must obey the rule that applies to a single <b>contingent</b> thing; in other words, it must have something outside itself that causes it to exist. This cause has to be either <b>contingent</b> or necessary. It cannot be <b>contingent,</b> though, because if it were, it would already be included within the aggregate. Thus the only remaining possibility is that an external cause is necessary, and that cause must be a necessary existent.|$|E

50|$|Masistius {{is first}} {{mentioned}} as {{the commander of}} the Saspirian and Alarodian <b>contingents</b> of Xerxes's army which had been gathered for the second invasion of Greece. Masistius would have been appointed to this position by the senior commanders of the Persian army. It would have been Masistius's responsibility to appoint officers to command the squads into which the Saspirian and Alarodian <b>contingents</b> would have been divided. Interestingly, these <b>contingents</b> commanded by Masistius were probably infantry <b>contingents</b> equipped with small rawhide shields, short spears and swords, rather than cavalry.|$|R
5|$|The German <b>contingent</b> {{comprised}} about 2,000 knights; the French <b>contingent</b> {{had about}} 700 knights from the king’s lands while the nobility raised smaller numbers of knights; and the Kingdom of Jerusalem had about 550 knights and 6,000 infantrymen.|$|E

The <b>contingent</b> operated as a single unit, unlike its predecessors, and Davies became the first officer from New Zealand to command an independent force on active service overseas.|$|E
5|$|Avicenna {{distinguishes between}} {{a thing that}} needs an {{external}} cause in order to exista <b>contingent</b> thingand a thing that is guaranteed to exist by its essence or intrinsic naturea necessary existent. The argument, or proof, tries to prove that there is indeed a necessary existent. It does this by first considering whether the opposite could be true: that everything that exists is <b>contingent.</b> Each <b>contingent</b> thing will need something other than itself to bring it into existence, which will in turn need another cause to bring it into existence, and so on. Because this seemed to lead to an infinite regress, cosmological arguments before Avicenna concluded that some necessary cause (such as God) is needed to end the infinite chain. However, Avicenna's argument does not preclude {{the possibility of an}} infinite regress.|$|E

5|$|On 16 August 1819, Royton (like its neighbours) sent a <b>contingent</b> of its townsfolk to Manchester to {{join the}} mass {{political}} demonstration {{now known as the}} Peterloo massacre (owing to the 15 deaths and 400–700 injuries that followed).

5|$|On 3 October 1899 Davies {{transferred}} {{into the}} Permanent Force of the New Zealand Militia, {{where he was}} made responsible for the training of volunteer mounted units. The Boer War, however, was declared a week later; Davies was quickly seconded to command a company of the volunteer First New Zealand <b>Contingent</b> {{being sent to the}} Cape. The <b>contingent</b> sailed on 21 October, arrived in late November, and was on active service within a week. Davies was promoted to Major in May 1900, and in the same month was given temporary command of the Third New Zealand <b>Contingent.</b> He was transferred to the Rhodesian Field Force, where he commanded the Fourth New Zealand <b>Contingent</b> in August 1900.|$|E
5|$|Passing through London {{en route}} to Gibraltar, where the Pangloss was based, Worsley met Shackleton, {{recently}} assigned by the War Office to the International <b>Contingent</b> destined for Northern Russia to aid the White movement in its fight against the Bolsheviks. Shackleton's expertise in the polar regions had been recognised by the War Office, and with the temporary rank of major, he was preparing the <b>contingent</b> for a winter deployment to Murmansk. Shackleton had already recruited several veterans of the Endurance to serve with him and arranged for Worsley, keen for action, {{to be transferred to}} join the <b>contingent.</b> Worsley, by now a lieutenant commander, left for Murmansk the following month.|$|E
