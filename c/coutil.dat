In the 18th and early 19th century, thin strips of baleen, also called whalebone, were favoured for the boning.Plastic {{is now the}} most commonly used material for lightweight, faux corsets and the majority of poor-quality corsets. Spring and/or spiral steel is preferred for stronger and generally better quality corsets. Other materials used for boning have included ivory, wood, and cane. (By contrast, a girdle is usually made of elasticized fabric, without boning.) ...|$|E

It is woven tightly to inhibit {{penetration of the}} corset's bones and resist stretching. <b>Coutil</b> has a high cotton content. Cotton has good dimensional stability, or a resistance to stretching, {{which makes it a}} good choice for such a stressed garment.Coutil may be made to be plain (similar to 100% cotton facing), satin, or brocade. It is common for <b>coutil</b> to have a herringbone texture, or a similar woven texture.|$|E
