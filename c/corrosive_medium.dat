50|$|Stress {{corrosion}} cracking {{is a phenomenon}} where a synergistic action of corrosion and tensile stress leads to brittle fracture of normally ductile materials at generally lower stress levels. During stress {{corrosion cracking}}, the material is relatively unattacked by the corrosive agent, but fine cracks form within it. This process has serious implications on {{the utility of the}} material because the applicable safe stress levels are drastically reduced in the <b>corrosive</b> <b>medium.</b> Season cracking and caustic embrittlement are two stress corrosion cracking processes which affected the serviceability of brass cartridge cases and riveted steel boilers respectively.|$|E
50|$|There are {{number of}} {{instances}} where {{this picture of}} a critical crack is modified by corrosion. Thus, fretting corrosion occurs when a <b>corrosive</b> <b>medium</b> is present at the interface between two rubbing surfaces. Fretting (in the absence of corrosion) results from the disruption of very small areas that bond and break as the surfaces undergo friction, often under vibrating conditions. The bonding contact areas deform under the localised pressure and the two surfaces gradually wear away. Fracture mechanics dictates that each minute localised fracture has to satisfy the general rule that the elastic energy released as the bond fractures has to exceed the work done in plastically deforming it and in creating the (very tiny) fracture surfaces. This process is enhanced when corrosion is present, not least because the corrosion products act as an abrasive between the rubbing surfaces.|$|E

40|$|A simple current-sourced {{adaptive}} {{corrosion protection}} system (ACPS) {{along with a}} technology to extract the protection current from the Tafel plot is presented. For reliable protection of the target metal, first, the Tafel plot of the target metal is obtained. Subsequently, a novel technique proposed in this paper is used to extract the protection current from the Tafel plot. This extracted protection current is fed to the target metal to protect the metal in the existing corrosive environment. This three-part system is adaptively used to update the required protection current to effectively protect the target metal continuously.

30|$|The {{dipole moment}} (μ) value of {{inhibitor}} {{is found to}} be 2.4, which favors its adsorption on steel. The Mulliken population is a good probe to locate adsorption sites present on inhibitor molecule. From the review of several kinds of literature, adsorption centers are negatively charged heteroatom and negatively charged carbon atoms of an aromatic ring. If the negative charges present on several atoms of an inhibitor molecule, the adsorption of inhibitor takes place in plane with the metal surface resulting in its even distribution [41, 42]. The TNC value is another important parameter to quantify the adsorption centers present on a molecule. Higher the value of TNC for an inhibitor, larger is the charge separation and hence the good number of adsorption sites is present on inhibitor [43]. In the present case, Mullikan charge distribution (Supplementary Table S 1) and the TNC value revealed the presence of more number of adsorption site.

One of the main causes of a new surgical intervention is attributed to the phenomenon of fretting-corrosion, i. e. wear under small movements (lower than 100 µm) in <b>corrosive</b> aqueous <b>medium.</b> To understand this degradation, the fretting between 316 L steel and PMMA has been investigated to simulate the fretting between femoral stem and bone cement. First, fretting in air has been studied as a reference environment. No significant wear was observed on the stainless steel. PMMA suffers a wear that exhibits a linear evolution {{as a function of the}} cumulated dissipated energy. Third body evolution could explain the particular W shape of the active wear track in PMMA, in dry conditions. In aerated Ringer's solution, at free corrosion potential, stainless steel suffers significant wear damage, and the wear volume increases linearly with time but not with dissipated energy. Moreover the optical observations and three-dimensional (3 -D) profilometry show a 'W' shape of the wear track of 316 L. A corrosion mechanism involving a crevice effect enhanced by fretting allows to explain the location of the maximum damage zones. Finally, the effect of electrochemical potential on the behaviour of 316 L/PMMA contacts has been studied by recording current intensity and cumulated dissipated energy under potentiodynamic conditions. Dissipated energy exhibited a reproducible variation with potential. Lubrication regimes and effect of potential on the surface charges could account for such a behaviour...|$|R
40|$|Commercial pumps {{tested at}} MIT's Jensen lab for {{applications}} pumping highly <b>corrosive</b> materials at <b>medium</b> pressure (100 - 300 psi) {{and a low}} flow rate (less than 50 mL/min) have proven unreliable. The most common failures observed have been check valve failure and insufficient chemical compatibility. Some of these pumps use dual reciprocating pistons to drive the fluid, requiring the use of four check valves. This lowers {{the reliability of the}} pump as a whole to an undesirable level. A novel pump system design could operate without the need for any check valves. Operating three diaphragm pumps in series creates a pseudo-peristaltic pump, but requires check valves on both sides of each diaphragm pump. Instead, a diaphragm pump was designed such that the diaphragm can completely seal at the apex of each stroke, eliminating the need for check valves between the pumps. Proper timing of the draw and pump phases of the cycle of each pump eliminates the need for check valves at the ends of the series as well. Thus, each stroke of the pump is able to drive fluid forward and seal to allow adjacent pumps to draw effectively and prevent them from creating backflow. Additionally, current pumps have problems with chemical compatibility due to poor material selection. Thus, this new pump could be made to be more reliable and more robust against corrosion by choosing materials with high chemical compatibility.

40|$|Epsilon-Caprolactam, {{the main}} {{product of the}} Beckmann {{rearrangement}} of cyclohexanone oxime, is an intermediate {{in the manufacture of}} nylon- 6. Currently, most of the industrial plants produce epsilon-caprolactam by the Beckmann rearrangement of cyclohexanone oxime using sulphuric acid or oleum as a homogeneous catalyst. This process has two main disadvantages: (i) The production of uneconomical by-product, such as ammonium sulphate, and (ii) the environmentally unfriendly <b>corrosive</b> reaction <b>medium.</b> In recent years, the demand for environmentally benign processes has been increasing due to the stringent environmental regulations. Therefore, the new route of the vapor-phase Beckmann rearrangement of cyclohexanone oxime on solid acid catalysts has gained increasing interest as an environmentally, economically and energetically favorable process. For the first time in 2003, the catalytic vapor-phase Beckmann rearrangement of cyclohexanone oxime on high-silica MFI-type zeolites has been industrialized by Sumitomo Chemical Company Ltd. in Japan. Despite the commercialization of this process, several issues are not clear and remain under debate. The main issues are: (i) The nature and location of active sites of the catalysts, (ii) the chemistry of the vapor-phase Beckmann rearrangement reaction (i. e. adsorption and desorption behavior of reactants, intermediates, products, and by-products of the reaction), (iii) the reasons for the catalyst deactivation, and (iv) the influence of additives during the vapor-phase Beckmann rearrangement. The present work mainly focussed on the above-mentioned issues. In this study, for better understanding of the reaction, mechanistic aspects of the vapor-phase Beckmann rearrangement on solid catalysts have been studied by in situ solid-state NMR spectroscopy. To study the reaction, several solid catalysts, such as MFI-type zeolites (silicalite- 1, H-[B]ZSM- 5 and H-ZSM- 5) and mesoporous materials (SBA- 15, [Al]SBA- 15, H-[Si]MCM- 41, and H-[Al]MCM- 41) were prepared according to the procedures described in the literature. The catalysts were characterized by various techniques, such as powder X-ray diffraction, ICP-OES, N 2 adsorption measurements (BET surface), SEM, and solid-state 1 H, 2 H, and 29 Si MAS NMR spectroscopy. It has been reported that boron-containing ZSM- 5 zeolite (H-[B]ZSM- 5) is highly selective in the vapor-phase Beckmann rearrangement of cyclohexanone oxime. However, the nature of the active sites in this zeolite and the influence of reactant molecules on framework boron atoms were not reported in the literature. In this study, the nature of active sites and the coordination change of framework boron atoms upon adsorption of reactant molecules in H-[B]ZSM- 5 (nSi / nB = 38) zeolite were studied by simultaneous 1 H and 11 B MAS NMR spectroscopy. For this purpose, several probe molecules characterized by different proton affinities (PA) were adsorbed on the zeolite. Probe molecules, such as pyridine, ammonia, and acetone, were loaded on H [B]ZSM- 5 zeolites by an in situ flow technique. The 1 H MAS NMR spectrum of dehydrated zeolite H [B]ZSM- 5 consists of signals at 1. 9, 2. 5, and 3. 2 ppm. Upon adsorption of pyridine (PA = 930 kJ mol- 1) and ammonia (PA = 854 kJ mol- 1) on H-[B]ZSM- 5 zeolite, the signal at 2. 5 ppm was mainly affected. Therefore, the signal at 2. 5 ppm was assigned to the Brønsted acidic SiOH[B] groups in the vicinity of framework boron species. On the other hand, by 11 B MAS NMR spectroscopy, the coordination change of B[3] species into B[4] species was investigated. It was found that the proton affinity of PA &# 8805; 854 kJ mol- 1 is required for probe molecules to induce the coordination change of the framework B[3] species into B[4] species in H-[B]ZSM- 5 zeolite. This coordination change of framework boron was accompanied by the protonation of probe molecules with PA &# 8805; 854 kJ mol- 1. As a result of protonation, a decrease of the 11 B quadrupole coupling constant from CQCC = 2. 7 ± 0. 1 MHz (B[3]) to CQCC &# 8804; 0. 85 MHz (B[4]) was noticed. This PA value (&# 8805; 854 kJ mol 1) is slightly higher (ca. 30 kJ mol- 1) than the proton affinity of PA = 821 kJ mol- 1 required for the protonation of probe molecules adsorbed on aluminum-containing zeolites reported in the literature. This is supported by the lower acid strength of SiOH[B] groups in H-[B]ZSM- 5 zeolites than the bridging OH groups (SiOH[Al]) in aluminum-containing zeolites. In the present study, for the first time, high-speed 2 H MAS NMR spectroscopy at the sample spinning rates of 25 kHz was applied to study the surface sites of deuterated catalysts and their interaction with non-deuterated reactant molecules. Deuterated catalysts, such as H/D-ZSM- 5, H/D-[Al]SBA- 15, and H/D-SBA- 15, were successfully prepared by the H/D exchange of OH groups using D 2 O vapor. By 2 H MAS NMR spectroscopy, suitable spectral resolution of the signals of SiOH groups (ca. 1. 8 ppm) and bridging hydroxyl groups (ca. 5. 7 ppm) in the 2 H MAS NMR spectrum of H/D-ZSM- 5 was achieved. Two reactant molecules characterized by different molecular diameters, such as cyclohexanone oxime (ca. 0. 65 nm) and cyclododecanone oxime (ca. 0. 9 nm), were adsorbed on H/D exchanged catalysts at room temperature. Upon adsorption of non-deuterated reactant molecules (i. e. cyclohexanone and cyclododecanone oximes), a dominating signal at ca. 12 ppm was observed in the 2 H MAS NMR spectra of H/D exchanged catalysts (H/D-ZSM- 5, H/D-[Al]SBA- 15, and H/D-SBA- 15). These results indicate that all kinds of surface sites of H/D-ZSM- 5 zeolite, such as silanol groups, silanol nests, or Brønsted acid sites, which can be located on the external surface, near the pore mouth, or in the interior pores, are accessible for cyclohexanone oxime. In situ solid-state 1 H and 15 N MAS NMR spectroscopy were utilized to study the chemistry of the vapor-phase Beckmann rearrangement of cyclohexanone oxime on MFI-type zeolites and mesoporous MCM- 41 and SBA- 15 -type materials. The results obtained in this work help to understand the adsorption, desorption, and reaction behavior of reactants, intermediates, products, and by-products formed during the reaction. Initially, in situ 1 H MAS NMR spectroscopy was applied to study the step-wise conversion of cyclohexanone oxime-D 11 on silicalite- 1 (nSi / nAl = 1700) and H-ZSM- 5 (nSi / nAl = 14) catalysts. Deuterated cyclohexanone oxime (i. e. cyclohexanone oxime-D 11) was successfully prepared with the H/D exchange degree of ca. 83 %. The vapor-phase Beckmann rearrangement of cyclohexanone oxime-D 11 was performed on non-deuterated silicalite- 1 and H-ZSM- 5 catalysts at different reaction temperatures. The 1 H MAS NMR spectroscopy provided the evidence on the formation of reaction intermediates, such as H-bonded cyclohexanone oxime and N-protonated cyclohexanone oxime on SiOH groups and bridging hydroxyl groups, respectively. From the 1 H MAS NMR studies of the vapor-phase Beckmann rearrangement of cyclohexanone oxime-D 11 on weakly acidic silicalite- 1, the formation of epsilon-caprolactam, hydroxylamine, and 5 -cyano- 1 -penetene was observed as product and by-product molecules of the reaction. In contrast, on strongly acidic H-ZSM- 5 catalyst, the O-protonated epsilon-caprolactam was identified due to the strong adsorption of this species on bridging hydroxyl groups. Furthermore, the conversion of O-protonated epsilon-caprolactam on bridging hydroxyl groups of H-ZSM- 5 {{led to the formation of}} N-protonated epsilon-caprolactam, or non- or N-protonated epsilon-aminocapric acid species. The observable chemical shift range of 15 N MAS NMR spectroscopy is larger than the observable chemical shifts range of 1 H MAS NMR spectroscopy. Therefore, in situ solid-state 15 N NMR spectroscopy is the most suitable technique to study the reaction mechanism. Furthermore, the interpretation of 15 N MAS NMR signals is less complicated than of 1 H MAS NMR signals. In this work, the chemistry of the vapor-phase Beckmann rearrangement on solid catalysts was thoroughly studied by in situ 15 N MAS NMR spectroscopy. The 15 N MAS NMR results suggest that both SiOH and Brønsted acid sites are active in this reaction. 15 N-cyclohexanone oxime interacts with SiOH groups via hydrogen bonding, which is indicated by the 15 N MAS NMR signal in the range of - 30 to - 46 ppm, while it interacts strongly with Brønsted acid sites and form N-protonated cyclohexanone oxime as represented by the 15 N MAS NMR signal in the range of - 145 to - 160 ppm. By-products, such as hydroxylamine and amines, were also observed on siliceous catalysts. The corresponding 15 N MAS NMR signals of these species are in the range of - 269 to - 280, and - 375 to - 387 ppm, respectively. In addition, O-protonation of the main product epsilon-caprolactam was found on both siliceous and Brønsted acidic catalysts as evidenced by the 15 N MAS NMR signal at - 237 ppm. On siliceous catalysts, however, the O protonation of epsilon-caprolactam depends on the number of acidic Q 3 (Si(OSi) 3 OH) silanol groups, which is ascertained by 29 Si MAS NMR spectroscopy. Furthermore, the conversion of O-protonated epsilon-caprolactam into N-protonated epsilon-caprolactam, and non- or N protoanted epsilon-aminocapric acid was exclusively observed on Brønsted acidic catalysts. Generally, methanol as an additive in the reaction system improves the selectivity towards the desired product epsilon-caprolactam during the vapor-phase Beckmann rearrangement of cyclohexanone oxime. In this study, the influence of the methanol on the adsorbed species formed and the conversion of the additive methanol during the vapor-phase Beckmann rearrangement reaction were investigated by in situ 15 N and 13 C MAS NMR spectroscopy. On silicalite- 1 and H-ZSM- 5 zeolites, hydrocarbons (13 C MAS NMR signals in the range of 25 to 30 ppm) were formed and deposited at increasing reaction|$|R
