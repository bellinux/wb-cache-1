The Commission was requested to undertake a research study to examine the impacts of options for reforming Australia’s general <b>consumer</b> <b>product</b> safety system. The Commission’s final report recommends a new national approach is needed to improve Australia’s <b>consumer</b> <b>product</b> safety system. The adoption of a single national law and regulator, replacing the States and Territories authority, is recommended by the Commission as a key reform {{to create a more}} consistent and responsive <b>consumer</b> <b>product</b> protection system. The Commission has also called for the responsiveness of the system to be improved by: introducing a new requirement for suppliers to notify the regulator of products associated with serious injury or death; developing a nationally coordinated product hazard identification system; and improving the targeting and timeliness of standards-making processes. To address information gaps, the Commission has endorsed a number of initiatives including: a national internet based one-stop shop for business and consumer information; and a one-off base line research study into the incidence and costs of product-related accidents, and an analysis of their causes.

5|$|Economic life in {{the towns}} was {{subsequently}} brought {{under the control of}} entrepreneurial Bugis, Makassarese, and Butonese immigrants from South Sulawesi, while East Timor products were exported under partnerships between army officials and Indonesian businessmen.

Indonesian entrepreneurs came to dominate non-Denok/military enterprises, and local manufactures from the Portuguese period made way for Indonesian imports.|$|E
5|$|Elemental {{chlorine}} is commercially {{produced from}} brine by electrolysis. The high oxidising potential of elemental chlorine {{led to the}} development of commercial bleaches and disinfectants, and a reagent for many processes in the chemical industry. Chlorine is used in the manufacture of a wide range of <b>consumer</b> <b>products,</b> about two-thirds of them organic chemicals such as polyvinyl chloride, and many intermediates for the production of plastics and other end products which do not contain the element. As a common disinfectant, elemental chlorine and chlorine-generating compounds are used more directly in swimming pools to keep them clean and sanitary. Elemental chlorine at high concentrations is extremely dangerous and poisonous for all living organisms, and was used in World War I as the first gaseous chemical warfare agent.|$|E

5|$|Exposure to lead {{can occur}} by {{contaminated}} air, water, dust, food, or <b>consumer</b> <b>products.</b> Children are {{at greater risk}} as {{they are more likely to}} put objects in their mouth such as those that contain lead paint and absorb a greater proportion of the lead that they eat. Exposure at work is a common cause of lead poisoning in adults with certain occupations at particular risk. Diagnosis is typically by measurement of the blood lead level. The Centers for Disease Control (US) has set the upper limit for blood lead for adults at 10µg/dl (10µg/100 g) and for children at 5µg/dl. Elevated lead may also be detected by changes in red blood cells or dense lines in the bones of children as seen on X-ray.|$|E
5|$|Nazi Germany had {{a strong}} anti-tobacco {{movement}} as pioneering research by Franz H. Müller in 1939 demonstrated a causal link between tobacco smoking and lung cancer. The Reich Health Office took measures to try to limit smoking, including producing lectures and pamphlets. Smoking was banned in many workplaces, on trains and among on-duty members of the military. Government agencies also worked to control other carcinogenic substances such as asbestos and pesticides. As {{part of a general}} public health campaign, water supplies were cleaned up, lead and mercury were removed from <b>consumer</b> <b>products</b> and women were urged to undergo regular screenings for breast cancer.|$|E

Nickel is preeminently an alloy metal, and its chief use is in nickel steels and nickel cast irons, in which it typically increases the tensile strength, toughness, and elastic limit. It is widely used in many other alloys, including nickel brasses and bronzes and alloys with copper, chromium, aluminium, lead, cobalt, silver, and gold (Inconel, Incoloy, Monel, Nimonic).|$|E

Consumer goods such as watches, furniture and radios were produced in abundance. The plan still left the bulk of the state's investment in industrial capital-goods production. This outcome was not seen as a positive sign {{for the future of the}} Soviet state by the majority of top party functionaries within the government; by 1975 consumer goods were expanding 9% slower than industrial capital-goods. The policy continued despite Brezhnev's commitment to make a rapid shift of investment to satisfy Soviet consumers and lead to an even higher standard of living. This did not happen.|$|E

5|$|Blackcurrants {{were once}} {{popular in the}} United States as well, but became less common in the 20th century after currant farming was banned in the early 1900s, when blackcurrants, as a vector of white pine blister rust, were {{considered}} {{a threat to the}} U.S. logging industry. The federal ban on growing currants was shifted to jurisdiction of individual states in 1966, and was lifted in New York State in 2003 through the efforts of horticulturist Greg Quinn. As a result, currant growing is making a comeback in New York, Vermont, Connecticut and Oregon. However, several statewide bans still exist including Maine, New Hampshire, Virginia, Ohio, and Massachusetts. Since the American federal ban curtailed currant production nationally for nearly a century, the fruit remains largely unknown in the United States, and has yet to regain its previous popularity to levels enjoyed in Europe or New Zealand. Owing to its unique flavour and richness in polyphenols, dietary fibre and essential nutrients, awareness and popularity of blackcurrant is once again growing, with a number of <b>consumer</b> <b>products</b> entering the U.S. market.|$|E
