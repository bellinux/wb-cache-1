5|$|A bodyline {{delivery}} was {{one where}} the cricket ball was bowled at {{the body of the}} batsman, in the hope that when he defended himself with his bat, a resulting deflection could be caught by one of several fielders standing close by.

5|$|Also {{attributable}} to Gasparo Cairano, and dated at this stage, is the singular St John the Baptist {{placed in the}} tympanum of the capitol of the eponymous Abbey in Parma. The work, undocumented and traditionally attributed by <b>critics</b> <b>to</b> Antonio Ferrari d'Agrate, was assigned in 2010 to the catalog {{of the works of}} Cairano due to obvious correlation with the mature art of the artist. This spread of Gasparo's artistic reach is significant and demonstrates that he could prove a success even outside of Brescia.|$|E
5|$|Although the xx {{had been}} {{strongly}} influenced by R acts, the album also drew comparisons from <b>critics</b> <b>to</b> alternative rock, electronica, and post-punk sounds. The melancholic songs on xx featured minimalist arrangements and were built around Smith's beats, Oliver Sim's basslines, and sparse guitar figures played by Baria Qureshi and Romy Madley Croft, who employed reverb in her lead guitar parts. Most of them were sung as low-key duets by Croft and Sim, both of whom wrote emotional lyrics about love, intimacy, loss, and desire.|$|E

5|$|Beyond {{recognition}} {{on their}} albums and concerts; his unauthorised {{use of other}} artists' works has led to disputes with musicians, most notably with Rickie Lee Jones. During their live shows of the 1990s, the Orb performed using digital audio tape machines optimised for live mixing and sampling before switching to laptops and digital media. Despite changes in performance method, the Orb maintained their colourful light shows and psychedelic imagery in concert. These visually intense performances prompted <b>critics</b> <b>to</b> compare the group to Pink Floyd.|$|E
5|$|Mendelssohn's Songs Without Words (Lieder ohne Worte), eight cycles each {{containing}} six lyric pieces (two published posthumously), remain {{his most}} famous solo piano compositions. They became standard parlour recital items even during the composer's lifetime, and their overwhelming popularity has itself caused many <b>critics</b> <b>to</b> underrate their musical value. Other composers who were inspired to produce similar pieces of their own, included Charles-Valentin Alkan (his five sets of Chants, each ending with a barcarole), Anton Rubinstein, Ignaz Moscheles, and Edvard Grieg.|$|E

5|$|Often {{compared}} by <b>critics</b> <b>to</b> Breathless (1960) and Rebel Without a Cause (1955), it is a stylistic {{departure from}} studio norms, driven by its jazz score and employing filmic techniques {{described as being}} as energetic and frantic as its characters. It achieved success in Japan and was followed by Black Sun (1964), featuring {{many of the same}} cast, crew and characters, with the addition of acclaimed drummer Max Roach to the soundtrack.

5|$|Paintings by Bellette {{were among}} those of twelve Australian artists {{included}} in the 1953 Arts Council of Great Britain exhibition in London, five regional British cities, and at the Venice Biennale. Bellette {{was one of only}} two women represented, the other being Constance Stokes. As with her Sulman prize-winners, Bellette's subjects were classically themed works: Electra (1944) and Oedipus (1945). Arts Council chairman Kenneth Clark was disappointed with the response of British <b>critics</b> <b>to</b> the exhibition, and their focus on a theme of nationhood paid little regard to the works of Bellette and several others.|$|E

Coinciding with their move to Nashville and work on their second album Weather and Water, the changes in location and sound were observed by <b>critics</b> <b>to</b> be a deliberate move from the jam-style of their debut album Movin' On to instead concentrate on Americana-focused music. By 2006, The Greencards had an annual slot at Merlefest, held yearly in Wilkesboro, North Carolina.

The appointment came despite his mixed batting form during the New Zealand tour. The selectors further demonstrated their view to the future when they dropped veteran Ray Lindwall altogether. The average age of Craig's team was {{two and a half years}} younger than the Australian squad sent to England in 1956, and they had only one player over the age of 30, whereas the 1956 team had five members over the age of 30. As a result of the team's relative inexperience, they were judged by <b>critics</b> <b>to</b> be the worst to have left Australian shores. Craig joined his team in Johannesburg after flying in from London, where he had been working for six months as a pharmacist, with the approval of the Australian board.|$|E
