An inverse correlation between phenol concentrations causing a 50 % reduction in keratinocyte and fibroblast viability at 24 h and their octanol water-partition coefficients (i. e., hydrophobicity) was observed. 3, 5 -xylenol, <b>chloroxylenol,</b> hexyl-resorcinol, and sodium dodecyl sulfate, but not resorcinol or phenol, induced release of interleukin- 1 α from keratinocytes at cytotoxic concentrations. Variable release of tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin- 8 from keratinocytes occurred only at toxic threshold concentrations of the phenols or sodium dodecyl sulfate. Subtoxic concentrations of phenols or sodium dodecyl sulfate did not induce cytokine release from keratinocytes. Neither the phenols nor sodium dodecyl sulfate induced release of the chemokines interleukin- 8, growth-related oncogene-α or monocyte chemotactic protein- 1 from fibroblasts.

Evan&#x 2032;s Blue (EvB) identifies the morphological integrity of the endospores while MTT (3 -[4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 yl]- 2, 5 -diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) identifies metabolic activity through its reduction by cellular dehydrogenases to microscopically visible deposits of insoluble formazan.

40|$|Conjugates of estrogenic chemicals, {{endogenous}} {{as well as}} xenobiotic, {{are mainly}} excreted via bile into the intestine. Therefore, measurement of estrogenic activity in bile yields useful information about an organism's internal exposure to (xeno-) estrogens. Although previous studies in The Netherlands have reported estrogenic activity in male fish bile, the contribution of natural hormones and xenobiotic substances to this activity is unknown. To identify compounds responsible for estrogenic activity in fish bile, we developed a bioassay-directed fractionation method for estrogenic chemicals. In this approach, the in vitro reporter gene assay ER-CALUX (Estrogen Responsive Chemical Activated Luciferase Gene Expression) {{was used to assess}} estrogenic activity in deconjugated bile samples and to direct RP-HPLC fractionation and chemical analysis (by GC-MS) of estrogenic compounds. The method was applied to bile from male breams (Abramis brama) collected at three locations in The Netherlands. At one of these locations, the River Dommel, extremely high levels of plasma vitellogenin and a high incidence of intersex gonads in these male breams have previously been observed, indicating the exposure to estrogens. In this study, the natural hormones 17 β-estradiol, estrone, and estriol accounted for the majority of estrogenic activity in male bream bile. At the River Dommel, the synthetic contraceptive pill component ethynylestradiol was found in effective concentrations as well.
