25|$|In human–{{computer}} interaction, computer accessibility (also {{known as}} accessible computing) {{refers to the}} accessibility of a computer system to all people, regardless of disability or severity of impairment, examples include web accessibility guidelines. Another approach is for the user to present a token to the <b>computer</b> <b>terminal,</b> such as a smart card, that has configuration information to adjust the computer speed, text size, etc. to their particular needs. This is useful where users want to access public computer based terminals in Libraries, ATM, Information kiosks etc. The concept is encompassed by the CEN EN 1332-4 Identification Card Systems - Man-Machine Interface. This development of this standard has been supported in Europe by SNAPI and has been successfully incorporated into the Lasseo specifications, but with limited success {{due to the lack}} of interest from public <b>computer</b> <b>terminal</b> suppliers.|$|E

25|$|The {{heads-up display}} shows {{the amount of}} {{ammunition}} for the currently selected weapon, along with the suit's shield status and its energy. The game also features an automap to help players navigate the {{different areas of the}} game. On every floor, the player can access to the <b>computer</b> <b>terminal</b> with an ID Card and a Record Card in their possession. ID cards are used to reveal unexplored parts of the floor, while Record Cards hold pre-recorded messages that can be read with the terminal. At certain points in the game, the player can also acquire Armor ROMs to enhance the suit's defense system, which reduces damage from enemy attacks.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} Selectric mechanism {{was designed}} and manufactured by the office equipment division of IBM and was not engineered {{for use as a}} <b>computer</b> <b>terminal.</b> Adapting this mechanism to the needs of computer input/output was not simple. Microswitches were added to the keyboard, solenoids were added to allow the computer to trigger the typing mechanism, and interface electronics were also needed. Several mechanical components, in particular the motor and the main clutch, had to be upgraded from the typewriter versions to reliably support continuous operation. Additional microswitches had to be added to sense the state of various parts of the mechanism, such as case (upper vs. lower).|$|E
25|$|On April 1, 1976, Jobs and Wozniak formed Apple Computer (now called Apple Inc.) {{along with}} {{administrative}} supervisor Ronald Wayne, whose {{participation in the}} new venture was short lived. Wozniak resigned from his job at Hewlett-Packard and became the {{vice president in charge}} of research and development at Apple. Wozniak's Apple I was similar to the Altair 8800, the first commercially available microcomputer, except the Apple I had no provision for internal expansion cards. With expansion cards the Altair could attach to a <b>computer</b> <b>terminal</b> and be programmed in BASIC. In contrast, the Apple I was a hobbyist machine. Wozniak's design included a $25 microprocessor (MOS 6502) on a single circuit board with 256 bytes of ROM, 4K or 8K bytes of RAM, and a 40-character by 24-row display controller. Apple's first computer lacked a case, power supply, keyboard, and display, all components the user had to provide.|$|E
25|$|Customization was {{required}} because hardware choices were not constrained by compatibility with any one popular standard. For example, some manufacturers used separate <b>computer</b> <b>terminal,</b> while others designed a built-in integrated video display system. Serial ports for printers and modems could use {{different types of}} UART chips, and port addresses were not fixed. Some machines used memory-mapped I/O instead of the 8080 I/O address space. All of these variations in the hardware were concealed from other modules of the system by use of the BIOS, which used standard entry points for the services required to run CP/M such as character I/O or accessing a disk block. Since support for serial communication to a modem was very rudimentary in the BIOS or may have been absent altogether, it was common practice for CP/M programs that used modems to have a user-installed overlay containing all the code required to access a particular machine's serial port.|$|E

Desmond walks Locke at gunpoint to the <b>computer</b> <b>terminal,</b> and forces him to enter [...] "the numbers" [...] into the computer, which resets a 108 minute timer. Soon after, Desmond detects Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox), and after channeling him to the computer room, forces Locke to greet Jack as seen in the previous episode.|$|E
500|$|To {{increase}} the interactivity with the game-world, id Software designed hundreds of high-resolution animated screens for in-game computers. Rather than using a simple [...] "use key" [...] to operate these computers, the crosshair {{acts as a}} mouse cursor over the screens allowing the player to use a computer in the game world. This allows for in-game <b>computer</b> <b>terminal</b> to perform more than one function, from operating security door codes, activating machinery, toggling lights or unlocking weapons lockers. According to the Doom 3 manual, GUI designer Patrick Duffy wrote over 500,000 lines of script code, and generated more than 25,000 image files to create all of the graphical interfaces, computer screens, and displays throughout Doom 3. Other important features of the game engine are normal mapping and specular highlighting of textures, realistic handling of object physics, dynamic, ambient soundtrack, and multi-channel sound. Doom 3 on Xbox supports 480p widescreen video display resolution and Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound.|$|E
500|$|In January 1972, Popular Electronics {{changed its}} {{editorial}} focus {{in an attempt}} to attract more advertising revenues. Reviews of stereo equipment and citizens band radio were featured; experimenter and constructions projects were gone. Dan Meyer, Don Lancaster, Forrest Mims, John Simonton and many other authors immediately started contributing to the competing Radio-Electronics magazine. The June 1972 cover story was [...] "Experimenting with a $32 Solid State Laser" [...] by Forrest Mims. Another article in that issue was [...] "Experiments with Op-Amps" [...] by B.R. Rogen; this was a pseudonym of Popular Electronics technical editor, Les Solomon. Solomon wrote articles for Radio-Electronics while working for Popular Electronics. Lou Garner, the longtime solid-state editor, moved to Radio-Electronics for a year. Several MITS kit projects were featured in Radio-Electronics including the ITC 1800 Integrated Circuit Tester (May 1972), the Model 1700 Function Generator (July 1973), the Model 1440 Calculator (July 1973) and the 88 VLCT <b>Computer</b> <b>Terminal</b> (November 1974).|$|E

500|$|With {{the help}} from system {{developers}} at QZ, the three {{set up their}} game – at the time just titled Stuga ("Cottage") – on Oden in 1978, and created the message board Thorvalds stugråd ("Thorvald's cottage council") for it; scientists working at QZ played the game, {{and were able to}} discuss it on the message board. The developers participated in the discussions, and used the message board to find information about bugs in the game. The Eriksson brothers and Johansson used a single Texas Silent Writer <b>computer</b> <b>terminal</b> in the Erikssons' parents' bedroom to program the game, through which they could log into Oden. Connecting to Oden was expensive, so they sometimes visited KTH during the evening to work on the game, as Oden only cost money to use during the day. At KTH, they had access to one terminal each, which used actual monitors to display text, as opposed to their writer terminal at home which printed the text on [...] "enormous amounts of paper".|$|E
500|$|Still underground, Picard discovers a <b>computer</b> <b>terminal,</b> {{which he}} activates, causing a {{hologram}} of the salesman to appear and explain they are witnessing {{a demonstration of}} an intelligent weapon system which is able to upgrade in response to any enemy threat. Picard surmises that the Minosians and the Drake were destroyed by the weapons. He unsuccessfully attempts to coerce the hologram to end the demonstration. Data is able to locate Picard, and determines that while the sentries could be set to destroy their own power source, the resulting explosion would probably take out the whole area, including the away-team. Picard finally tells the salesman he will buy the system, causing the salesman to disappear and the probes on the planet to shut down. Meanwhile, La Forge uses the planet's atmosphere to reveal {{the location of the}} space-born probe and destroys it. [...] The away team returns to the star-drive section, where Picard allows La Forge to stay in command until they rendezvous with the saucer section, remarking that he left him with the ship intact and would like it returned in the same condition.|$|E
500|$|The book {{is divided}} into five chapters. Each chapter {{is divided into}} five parts, each {{describing}} events {{from the perspective of}} one of the five main characters: Karen, Rick, Luke, Rachel, and Player One. The first chapter, [...] "Hour One: Cue the Flaming Zeppelin", has Karen arriving at the Toronto airport on a flight from Winnipeg to meet a man she met online. She sits on a stool at the airport hotel bar in which Rick is the bartender, Rachel is at a <b>computer</b> <b>terminal,</b> and Luke is sitting at a table drinking scotch. Rachel is there with the expectation to meet a man who can father her child and approaches Luke. Karen's date goes badly as she finds the man too assertive physically and too distant intellectually. A self-help guru, Leslie Freemont, enters with his assistant Tara to welcome Rick into his empowerment program; Leslie gives a speech to the group, takes Rick's money, and leaves. Meanwhile, oil prices rapidly increase and explosions start to occur outside. With the power unreliable, Karen, Rick, Luke, and Rachel run to Rick's vehicle to listen to the radio. Karen's date, Warren, is killed by a sniper as he runs to the group, who quickly return to the bar lounge where they barricade themselves in.|$|E

500|$|The {{majority}} of the episode—like the rest of seasons six, seven, eight and nine—was filmed in Los Angeles, California. The first scene, featuring Mulder breaking into a military base, was shot in a hydroelectric power plant east of Fresno, California. The rooms that were featured in the episode were the main rooms for the power plant that The X-Files design team redecorated; the crew later called the set the [...] "war room". Most of the decoration and interior scene {{was done by the}} visual effect crew; the only visible part seen in real life was a large generator that pumped water. Bill Roe, the cinematographer for the episode, spent four to five days lighting the set for filming. Kim Manners called his work [...] "a great job". The scenes that take place in the main <b>computer</b> <b>terminal</b> room were shot on a sound stage at 20th Century Fox; the crew built the set themselves. The scenes with Mulder being tortured by the military guards were shot at Fort MacArthur, an abandoned military base in San Pedro, California, including The Marine Mammal Care Center located at Fort MacArthur. Filming the court room was one of the [...] "most challenging sequences" [...] Manners had ever done. Carter wanted the courtroom to have no spectators and no jury. This meant that Manners had to shoot each scene with a limited amount of actors and make them look [...] "fresh". Manners was terrified to film the 40-page long courtroom scene, pointing out that the show was basically re-telling a nine-year history of The X-Files. Corey Kaplan designed the set.|$|E
500|$|The Eriksson {{brothers}} and Johansson used the programming language BASIC {{to create the}} game, which Kimmo called noteworthy: it was considered impossible to write big programs in BASIC, and The Cottage was [...] "gigantic". The reason for their choice in programming language {{was that it was}} the only one all three knew beforehand; Kimmo said that they would no longer have chosen BASIC if they had programmed The Cottage in 1986, as they had access to many more programming languages by that time. According to Johansson, another reason was [...] "pure defiance" [...] towards the Eriksson brothers' father, who had told them they {{would never be able to}} get the game running if they programmed it in BASIC. Johansson said that the most challenging aspect of the development was getting the game to understand the Swedish language; to keep the size of the game's command interpreter [...] "reasonable", they decided to limit it to two-word commands. Acknowledging that different people use different words for things, they play-tested it with friends and family, writing down all attempted commands and deciding what the game should be expected to understand. During a short period of the game's development, the developers also logged all actions players at QZ had taken that the command interpreter had not understood; based on this data, they improved the interpreter and changed the outcomes to certain actions. At one point, the Eriksson {{brothers and}} Johansson took a two-year break from the game, but eventually returned to it and finished it in 1979. At this point, the only ways to play the game were by using a <b>computer</b> <b>terminal</b> in a university or by connecting to Oden via a modem.|$|E

The system acted primarily {{in the form of}} a buy and sell system with the tags taking the place of the more traditional classifications. But users found ways to express themselves outside these bounds, and the system spontaneously created stories, poetry and other forms of communications. Unfortunately, the system was expensive to operate, and when their host machine became unavailable and a new one could not be found, the system closed in January 1975.|$|E
