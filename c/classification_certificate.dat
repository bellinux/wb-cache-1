40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the validity of}} racial/ethnic information in California birth certificate data. DATA SOURCES: Computerized birth certificate data and postpartum interviews with California mothers. STUDY DESIGN AND DATA COLLECTION: Birth certificates were matched with face-to-face structured postpartum interviews with 7, 428 mothers to compare racial/ethnic information between the two data sources. Interviews were conducted in Spanish or English during delivery stays at 16 California hospitals, 1994 - 1995. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The sensitivity of racial/ethnic <b>classification</b> in birth <b>certificate</b> data was very high (94 percent to 99 percent) for African Americans, Asians/Pacific Islanders, Europeans/Middle Easterners, and Latinas (Hispanics). For Native Americans, however, the sensitivity was only 54 percent. The positive predictive value of birth <b>certificate</b> <b>classification</b> of race/ethnicity was high for all racial/ethnic groups (96 percent to 97 percent). CONCLUSIONS: Despite limited training of birth clerks, the maternal racial/ethnic information in California birth certificate data {{appears to be a}} valid measure of self-identified race and Hispanic ethnicity for groups other than Native Americans...|$|R
