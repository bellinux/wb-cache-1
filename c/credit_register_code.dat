The {{first part of the}} thesis focuses on description of <b>credit</b> <b>registers,</b> their creation and functioning {{at the level of the}} European Union. The second part describes and compares <b>credit</b> <b>registers</b> in the Czech Republic. The last part analyses the influence of negative information obtained from <b>credit</b> <b>registers</b> on the approval process and the use of <b>registers</b> when offering <b>credit</b> products to clients. In this part the positive influence of the use of <b>credit</b> <b>registers</b> in the banking sector is proved. The method of description and descriptive analysis is used in the thesis...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{the operation of}} credit bureaus and public <b>credit</b> <b>registers</b> in Europe and extract potential lessons for upgrading <b>credit</b> <b>registers</b> in other countries. The evidence that we report is based on questionnaires directed to private credit bureaus and central banks, on direct interviews and on official sources. The European experience highlights a set of important issues. First, European privacy protection laws affect greatly the amount and type of information shared between lenders. Second, credit bureaus tend to originate from local lenders. Third, in Europe as elsewhere there are powerful forces pushing towards consolidation of the credit bureaus industry. While this process reflects the "natural monopoly" feature of the industry, its pace has been accelerated by technological factors and, especially within Europe, by the increasing international integration of capital markets. Three annexes complete the paper, reporting detailed descriptions of private credit bureaus activity in European countries, the main features of European public <b>credit</b> <b>registers,</b> and privacy protection restrictions to the activity of credit bureaus and public <b>credit</b> <b>registers</b> in Europe. information sharing, credit markets...|$|R

40|$|Information asymmetries can {{severely}} limit cross-border border {{expansion of}} banks. When a bank enters a new market, it has incomplete information about potential new clients. Such asymmetries are reduced by <b>credit</b> <b>registers,</b> which distribute financial data on bank clients. We investigate {{the interaction of}} <b>credit</b> <b>registers</b> and bank entry modes (in form of branching and M&A) by using {{a new set of}} time series cross-section data for the EU- 27 countries. We study how the presence of public and private <b>credit</b> <b>registers</b> and the type of information exchanged affect bank entry modes during the period 1990 - 2007. Our analysis shows that the existence of both types of registers increases the share of branching in the overall entries. Additionally, the establishment of public registers reduces concentration ratios, and some banking competition indicators (such as overhead costs/assets). The introduction of a private credit bureau, on the other hand, has no effect on concentration ratios, but positively contributes to competition (by decreasing interest rate margins). This suggests that <b>credit</b> <b>registers</b> facilitate direct entry through a reduction of information asymmetries, which in turn intensifies competition. credit registries, foreign entry, asymmetric information...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} readiness as a correlate of academic success among beginning university students. A total of 829 first-time entering {{students from a}} large business sciences faculty were participants (males = 319, females = 510, mean age = 19, SD = 0. 50 years). They completed the Academic Readiness Questionnaire (Lemmens, 2010) during the first-year orientation week. Data on academic success, consisting of subject marks and credits were collected in 2009 after a results verification process. Data were analysed with three separate multiple regression analyses. The first analysis consisted of the overall student sample, {{the second and third}} consisted of the black and the white students separated from the overall student sample. The main findings reveal that high school marks, the number of subjects in first year (<b>credits</b> <b>registered),</b> goal orientation, race, learning-efficacy, gender and the geographical area of high school have a direct relationship with academic success. The variables that predict academic success for black students are high school marks, <b>credits</b> <b>registered,</b> and parental education.

We focus the discussion {{on the role of}} a limited set of variables (collateral, type of lender and bank borrower relationship) while controlling for the other explanatory variables. The study uses information on the more than three million loans entered into by Spanish credit institutions over a complete business cycle (1988 to 2000) collected by the Bank of Spain's <b>Credit</b> <b>Register</b> (Central de Información de Riesgos). We find that collateralised loans have a higher PD, loans granted by savings banks are riskier and, finally, that a close bank borrower relationship increases the willingness to take more risk. credit risk, probability of default, collateral, relationship banking, <b>credit</b> <b>register...</b>|$|R

Information from an ad hoc survey of Italian asset management companies, combined with accounting data for 2008 drawn from the Central <b>Credit</b> <b>Register,</b> is used to develop a number of indices for 341 Italian investee companies. A multivariate statistical analysis on accounting and credit quality data (from the Central <b>Credit</b> <b>Register)</b> finds 41 companies with high credit risk and low profitability; taking additional financial indices and ratios into account, the number of “critical” companies rises to 137 (40 percent of the total).

50|$|The {{instruction}} set is very symmetrical. Every instruction {{consists of a}} 9-bit opcode, a 4-bit <b>register</b> <b>code,</b> and a 23-bit effective address field, which consists in turn of a 1-bit indirect bit, a 4-bit <b>register</b> <b>code,</b> and an 18-bit offset. Instruction execution begins by calculating the effective address. It adds {{the contents of the}} given register (if non-zero) to the offset; then, if the indirect bit is 1, fetches the word at the calculated address and repeats the effective address calculation until an effective address with a zero indirect bit is reached. The resulting effective address can be used by the instruction either to fetch memory contents, or simply as a constant. Thus, for example, MOVEI A,3(C) adds 3 to the 18 lower bits of register C and puts the result in register A, without touching memory.|$|R

On demand of the Accompanying Committee of the Central Individual <b>Credit</b> <b>Register</b> the data of this unique and quasi exhaustive database have been thoroughly analysed in 2005. In the article, some of the results of that analysis, which was published in January 2006 in Working Paper n° 78, are given. More specifically, the article investigates borrowing and payment behavior according to debtor characteristics. The analysis finds that borrowing patterns, especially as credit portfolio composition is concerned, clearly diverge according to age and residence. Furthermore, striking differences were found for the percentage of loan defaults if these variables were taken into account. In particular, the article comes to the conclusion that loan defaults aggregated at the regional level show remarkably strong correlations with economic and demographic factors. credit bureau, consumer credits, mortgage loans, loan payment defaults...|$|R
