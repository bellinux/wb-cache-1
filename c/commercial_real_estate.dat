5|$|In 1988, Chicago Mayor Harold Washington {{approved}} a $24million subsidy to FJV Venture to develop Block 37. There were {{a series of}} subsequent alternate redevelopment plans. Among the prior redevelopment plans for the block were the original Block 37 Towers, for which the original block was demolished and which included a 47-story tower designed by Murphy/Jahn, Inc. Another failed plan was a Solomon Cordwell Buenz plan including a 711-foot 66-story residential tower and a 12-story Marriott Hotel towering over a 4-story retail base. This had followed the 39-story Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates design scheduled for 2004 completion. The developments fell through, which put the property back into the city's possession. In 2002, the city initiated a competition for the development rights to the property. In 2004, the city sold the property to Mills Corp. at a $20million loss. Mills sold the development rights to Joseph Freed and Associates in 2005, when the city committed $42million in tax-increment funding. In 2007, the city learned the development was $150million over budget. The complex was originally being developed by <b>commercial</b> <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> developer Mills Corporation, {{best known for its}} ownership of numerous super-regional shopping malls.

40|$|This {{paper is}} a quantitatively-oriented {{theoretical}} {{study of the}} interaction between housing prices, aggregate production, and household behavior over a lifetime. We develop a life-cycle model of a production economy in which land and capital are used to build residential and <b>commercial</b> <b>real</b> <b>estates.</b> We find that, in an economy where the share of land in the value of <b>real</b> <b>estates</b> is large, housing prices react more to an exogenous change in expected productivity or the world interest rate, causing a large redistribution between net buyers and net sellers of houses. Changing financing constraints, however, has limited effects on housing prices. <b>Real</b> <b>estates,</b> land, housing prices, life cycle, collateral constraints...|$|R
