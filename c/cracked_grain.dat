Triaxial experiments were carried out on wet and dry intact samples of Verzasca Gneiss at T = 300 and 500 °C, Pc = 500 and 1030 MPa, ε = 0. 013 - 1. 6 x 10 - 4 s- 1. The GSD has been determined from SEM-micrographs and {{is characterized by the}} slope, D, of its log(frequency) -log(radius) histogram. The GSD is not fractal; we observe two slopes for all GSDs. The larger grains in experimentally deformed samples have a D value, D>, of 2. 04 and 2. 26 for feldspar and quartz gouge. <b>Cracked</b> <b>grains</b> yield values of D = 1. 5 - 1. 6. Increasing the confining pressure or temperature decreases the D-value. For grains smaller than ~ 2 μm another D-value, D = 2. 02 for gouge and 1. 64 for cracked grains; D< = 0. 97. Grain size reduction in fault zones develops by a two-stage process: rupturing creates cracked grains; further displacement of fragments causes further comminution by wear and attrition. <b>Cracked</b> <b>grains</b> have been used to calculate the surface energy associated with faulting; it follows that this energy forms a small fraction in the total energy-budget of earthquakes...|$|R

5000|$|The {{first step}} in wort {{production}} is to make malt from dried, sprouted barley. The malt is then run through a roller mill and cracked. This <b>cracked</b> <b>grain</b> is then mashed, that is, mixed with hot water and steeped, a slow heating process that enables enzymes to convert the starch in the malt into sugars. At set intervals, most notably when the mixture has reached temperatures of 45, 62 and 73 °C (113, 144 and 163 °F), the heating is briefly halted. The temperature of the mixture is usually increased to 78 °C (172 °F) for mashout. Lautering is the next step, which means the sugar-extracted grist or solids remaining in the mash are separated from the liquid wort. In homebrewing, the malt-making and mashing steps can be skipped by adding malt extract to water. The mixture is then boiled to sanitize the wort and, {{in the case of}} most beer production, to extract the bittering, flavour and aroma from hops. In beer making, the wort is known as [...] "sweet wort" [...] until the hops have been added, after which it is called [...] "hopped or bitter wort". The addition of hops is generally done in three parts at set times. The bittering hops, added first, are boiled in the wort for approximately one hour to one and a half hours. This long boil extracts resins, which provides the bittering. Then, the flavouring hops are added, typically 15 minutes {{from the end of the}} boil. The finishing hops are added last, toward the end of or after the boil. This extracts the oils, which provide flavour and aroma but evaporate quickly. In general, hops provide the most flavouring when boiled for approximately 15 minutes, and the most aroma when not boiled at all.|$|E

40|$|A model {{study on}} {{fractured}} systems was performed using {{a concept that}} treats isotropic cracked systems as ensembles of <b>cracked</b> <b>grains</b> by analogy to isotropic polycrystalline elastic media. The approach has two advantages: (a) Averaging performed is ensemble averaging, thus avoiding the criticism legitimately leveled at most effective medium theories of quasistatic elastic behavior for cracked media based on volume concentrations of inclusions. Since crack effects are largely independent of the volume they occupy in the composite, such a non-volume-based method offers an appealingly simple modeling alternative. (b) The second advantage is that both polycrystals and fractured media are stiffer than might otherwise be expected, due to natural bridging effects of the strong components. These same effects have also often been interpreted as crack-crack screening in high-crack-density fractured media, {{but there is no}} inherent conflict between these two interpretations of this phenomenon. Results of the study are somewhat mixed. The spread in elastic constants observed in a set of numerical experiments is found to be very comparable to the spread in values contained between the Reuss and Voigt bounds for the polycrystal model. However, computed Hashin-Shtrikman bounds are much too tight to be in agreement with the numerical data, showing that polycrystals of <b>cracked</b> <b>grains</b> tend to violate some implicit assumptions of the Hashin-Shtrikman bounding approach.

40|$|Four sorghum cultivars (white, sumac, high tannin and black) differing in kernel {{characteristics}} were evaluated for cooking quality using whole, cracked and decorticated kernels. Whole grain had longer minimum cooking time (MCT) and lower water uptake. MCT ranged from 20 to 55 min for all varieties. Soluble solid loses (SSL) {{were lower than}} for <b>cracked</b> <b>grain</b> (1. 0 to 1. 5 %). Formation of a gruel-like texture, darker pericarp color, splitting and agglomeration of kernels occurred especially for white grain. Cracked sorghum had shorter MCT (8. 8. to 17. 5 min) but produced higher SSL (1. 3 to 2. 9 %). Changes in color and appearance due to leaching of pigments especially for the sorghums with a pigmented testa occurred. Utilization of decorticated kernels reduced MCT (11 to 25. 3 min), but nutritional value is affected with {{the removal of the}} pericarp, plus the SSL (0. 5 to 0. 7 %) produced during cooking. The long grain rice types have comparatively lower values in terms of MCT (22 min) than whole sorghum and SSL are similar to values obtained for <b>cracked</b> <b>grain</b> (1. 7 to 2. 2 %) showing a minimum of splitting. Short and medium rice grain shows relatively long cooking time (30 to 35 min) but no longer than cracked or decorticated sorghum and produced higher SSL (28 % to 40 %) during processing, showing extensive disintegration. When sorghum was precooked; cooking quality improved. The combination of dry heat and microwave reduced MCT and SSL from 31 to 49 % and 6. 6 to 41. 3 %, respectively for all varieties compared to the control. This treatment produced grain with softer texture, increased dietary fiber and higher antioxidant activity retention (67. 8 %) for the tannin varieties than the control (22. 7 %). Evaluations of cooking quality of whole sorghum and the application of precooking process have more applications than just preparation of rice-like products.

The performance, in this respect, {{of the most commonly}} used alloys at Volvo Aero Corporation (VAC), 718 and the higher temperature capacity Waspaloy, are therefore the main subjects for this thesis. The emerging Allvac 718 ® PLUSTM (718 Plus) is also included due to the prospect of replacing the expensive Waspaloy. The overall emphasis is on weldability through Varestraint testing but limited work was initially carried out on notch rupture sensitivity of 718 Plus. The notch rupture testing of 718 Plus emphasized the importance of the secondary phases like delta-phase in the grain boundaries. Hot cracks were observed in all alloys with re-solidified products on the liquated and re-solidified grain boundaries. Grain boundary liquation and segregation of alloying elements was considered to be the primary reason for liquation of HAZ grain boundaries which caused cracking.

40|$|International audienceBoth {{nucleation}} and {{propagation of}} fatigue cracks in fcc metals are investigated, using 3 D discrete dislocation dynamics (DDD) simulations. Firstly, DDD simulations explain the mechanisms {{leading to the}} formation of persistent slip bands in surface grains loaded in fatigue. Extrusions are evidenced where the bands intercept the free surface. The extrusion growth rate is estimated for different material parameters and loading conditions. Energy and stress calculations performed inside the simulated grain lead to a possible scenario for the crack initiation at the interface between the band and the matrix, as reported in the literature. Secondly, a crack is inserted at the persistent slip band interface and the crack tip slip displacement evolutions are evaluated. It is shown that the crack growth rate is strongly related to the grain size and to the distance to the grain boundary; the smaller the grain, the faster the crack growth. Finally, the crack propagation to the next grain is investigated by conducting DDD fatigue simulations in a surface grain next to a <b>cracked</b> <b>grain.</b> It is shown that the development of the persistent slip band is modified by the presence of the crack.

40|$|Sub-critical {{intergranular}} {{crack growth}} {{is an important}} creep fracture mechanism in polycrystalline superalloys. The root cause of this fracture is not well understood. The role of grain orientation on the formation of sub-critical grain boundary cracks during creep of a conventionally cast nickel-based superalloy has been analyzed in this study. The crystallographic orientations of grain pairs adjacent to grain boundaries normal to the tensile axis were measured using Electron Back-Scattered Diffraction (EBSD). The difference in the Schmid factor for the 1113 ̆c 1123 ̆e slip system between the grains was compared to the occurrence of sub-critical grain boundary cracking.

The uncracked grain boundaries were found to have small Schmid factor mismatch, as well as small potential primary creep strain mismatch, than those of the <b>cracked</b> <b>grain</b> boundaries. Larger mismatches in Schmid factor and potential primary creep strain indicate possible development of large enough stress concentration at the grain boundary sufficient to initiate sub-critical cracks.

40|$|Climate {{change has}} been an {{increasingly}} significant factor behind fluctuations in the yield and quality of rice (Oryza sativa L.), particularly regarding chalky (white-back, basal-white, and milky-white) grain, immature thin grain, and <b>cracked</b> <b>grain.</b> The {{development and use of}} heat-tolerant varieties is an effective way to reduce each type of grain damage based on the existence of each varietal difference. Cultivation methods that increase the available assimilate supply per grain, such as deep-flood irrigation, are effective for diminishing the occurrence of milky-white grains under high temperature and low solar radiation conditions. The application of sufficient nitrogen during the reproductive stage is important to reduce the occurrence of most heat damage with the exception of milky-white grain. In regard to developing measures for heat-induced poor palatability of cooked rice, a sensory parameter, the hardness/adhesion ratio may be useful as an indicator of palatability within a relatively wide air–temperature range during ripening. Methods for heat damage to rice can be classified as either avoidance or tolerance measures. The timing of the measures is further divided into preventive and prompt types. The use of heat-tolerant varieties and late transplanting are preventive measures, whereas the application of sufficient nitrogen as a top dressing and irrigation techniques during the reproductive stage are prompt types which may function to lower the canopy temperature by enhancing evapotranspiration. Trials combining the different types of techniques will contribute towards obtaining more efficient and steady countermeasures against heat damage under conditions of climate change...|$|E
