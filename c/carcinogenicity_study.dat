This {{is supported by the}} positive results of the NTP bioassays with Ni sub-sulfide and Ni oxide in rats and mice. The human and animal data consistently indicate a lack of carcinogenicity via the oral route of exposure and limit the carcinogenicity of nickel compounds to respiratory tumours after inhalation. Nickel metal is classified as a suspect carcinogen; there is consistency between the absence of increased respiratory cancer risks in workers predominantly exposed to metallic nickel and the lack of respiratory tumours in a rat lifetime inhalation <b>carcinogenicity</b> <b>study</b> with nickel metal powder. In the rodent inhalation studies with various nickel compounds and nickel metal, increased lung inflammations with and without bronchial lymph node hyperplasia or fibrosis were observed. In rat studies, oral ingestion of water soluble nickel salts can trigger perinatal mortality effects in pregnant animals. Whether these effects are relevant to humans is unclear as epidemiological studies of highly exposed female workers have not shown adverse developmental toxicity effects.|$|E
2500|$|Ethidium bromide {{is thought}} {{to act as a}} mutagen because it intercalates double {{stranded}} DNA (i.e., inserts itself between the strands), deforming the DNA. This could affect DNA biological processes, like DNA replication and transcription. [...] Ethidium bromide {{has been shown to be}} mutagenic to bacteria via the Ames test, but only after treatment with liver homogenate, which simulates the metabolic breakdown of the molecule being tested. The lack of detected mutagenicity without liver homogenate indicates that ethidium bromide is not directly mutagenic, but that its metabolites are.

These conclusions are supported by a subchronic <b>carcinogenicity</b> <b>study</b> in mice, whereby no mutagenic effects were detected. Ethidium bromide (Homidium brand) use in animals to treat trypanosome infection suggests that toxicity and mutagenicity are not high. [...] Studies have been conducted in animals to evaluate EtBr as a potential antitumorigenic chemotherapeutic agent. Its chemotherapeutic use is due to its toxicity to mitochondria. A more recent study shows that EtBr acts as a topoisomerase I poison, just like several anticancer drugs used in humans. [...] The above studies do not support the commonly held idea that ethidium bromide is a potent mutagen in humans, but they do indicate that it can be toxic at high concentrations.|$|E

40|$|In an {{exercise}} {{designed to reduce}} animal use, we analysed the results of rat sub-chronic toxicity studies from 289 pharmaceutical compounds with the aim to predict the tumour outcome of carcinogenicity studies in this species. The results {{were obtained from the}} assessment reports available at the Medicines Evaluation Board of the Netherlands for 289 pharmaceutical compounds that had been shown to be non-genotoxic. One hundred and forty-three of the 239 compounds not inducing putative preneoplastic lesions in the sub-chronic study did not induce tumours in the <b>carcinogenicity</b> <b>study</b> (True Negatives - TN), whereas 96 compounds were categorised as False Negatives (FN), because tumours were observed in the <b>carcinogenicity</b> <b>study.</b> For the remaining 50 compounds, 31 showed preneoplastic lesions in the subchronic study and tumours in the <b>carcinogenicity</b> <b>study</b> (True positives - TP), and 19 only showed preneoplastic lesions in subchronic studies but no tumours in the <b>carcinogenicity</b> <b>study</b> (False positives - FP). In addition, we then re-assessed the prediction of the tumour outcome by integrating the pharmacological properties of these compounds. These pharmacological properties were evaluated with respect to {{the presence or absence of}} a direct or indirect proliferative action. We found support for the absence of cellular proliferation for 204 compounds (TN). For 67 compounds the presence of cellular hyperplasia as evidence for proliferative action could be found (TP). Therefore, this approach resulted in an ability to predict non-carcinogens at a success rate of 92 % and the ability to detect carcinogens at 98 %. The combined evaluation of pharmacological and histopathological endpoints eventually led to only 18 unknown outcomes (17 categorised as FN. 1 as FP), thereby enhancing both the negative and positive predictivity of an evaluation based upon histopathological evaluation only. The data show the added value of a consideration of the pharmacological properties of compounds in relation to potential class-effects, both in the negative and positive direction. A high negative and a high positive predictivity will both result in waiving the need for conducting 2 -year rat carcinogenicity studies, if this is accepted by Regulatory Authorities, which will save, large numbers of animals, reduce drug developmen...|$|E

40|$|There {{is general}} {{agreement}} {{in the scientific community}} on the need to improve carcinogenicity testing and the assessment of human carcinogenic risk and to incorporate more information on mechanisms and modes of action into the risk assessment process. Advances in molecular biology have identified a growing number of genes such as protooncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes that are highly conserved across species and are associated {{with a wide variety of}} human and animal cancers. In vivo transgenic rodent models incorporating such mechanisms are used to identify mechanisms involved in tumor formation and as selective tests for carcinogens. Transgenic methods can be considered an extension of genetic manipulation by selective breeding, which long has been employed in science and agriculture. The use of two rodent species in carcinogenicity testing is especially important for identifying transspecies carcinogens. The capacity of a substance to induce neoplasia across species suggests that the mechanism(s) involved in the induction of the neoplasia are conserved and therefore may have significance for humans. Based on available information there is sufficient experience with some in vivo transgenic rodent carcinogenicity models to support their application as complementary second species studies in conjunction with a single 2 -year rodent <b>carcinogenicity</b> <b>study.</b> The optional substitution of a second 2 -year rodent <b>carcinogenicity</b> <b>study</b> with an alternative study such as an in vivo transgenic <b>carcinogenicity</b> <b>study</b> is part of the International Conference on Harmonization guidance S 1 B: Testing for Carcinogenicity of Pharmaceuticals. This guidance is intended to be flexible enough to accommodate a wide range of possible carcinogenicity assessment models currently under consideration or models that may be developed in the future. The use of an in vivo transgenic mouse model in place of a second 2 -year mouse study will improve the assessment of carcinogenic risk by contributing insights into the mechanisms of tumorigenesis and potential human relevance not available from a standard 2 -year bioassay. It is envisioned that this will stimulate the further development of more efficient and relevant methods for identifying and assessing potential human carcinogenic risk, which will benefit public health...|$|E
40|$|Since the {{discovery}} of the excellent features of MWCNT, there has been an increase in potential applications, {{despite the fact that they}} have been discussed to have a toxic potential depending on their length and fiber-like shape. For this reason, potential adverse biological effects of MWCNT have been investigated in vivo (rat) in a project funded by the German BMBF (contract No. 03 X 0109 A). Tailor-made MWCNT with different lengths and diameters were produced, suspended in artificial lung medium and injected intraperitoneally in rats in two dose groups (low: 1 x 109 WHO fibers; high: 5 x 109 WHO fibers) in a BrdU screening test (MWCNT 1, 2, 3) and a <b>carcinogenicity</b> <b>study</b> (MWCNT 1, 2, 3, 3 a). Long amosite asbestos (0. 1 x 109 WHO fibers) served as positive control, ground MWCNT and Printex 90 (5 mg/rat) as negative control. Suspension and length/ diameter distribution were measured in SEM. Proliferation of cells in the diaphragmatic peritoneum was investigated as a shorttime screening test 3 and 6 months after i. p. injection of fibers in rats, using the BrdU method and measurement of peritoneal thickness. Furthermore, animal mortality and tumor development were monitored over two years in a <b>carcinogenicity</b> <b>study.</b> There was a time-independent significant increase in cell proliferation after injection of MWCNT 1 (high) (L= 7. 9 m; D= 0. 037 m), MWCNT 2 (low/high) (L= 10. 24 m; D= 0. 04 m), and MWCNT 3 (low/high) (L= 8. 57 m; D= 0. 085 m), like after exposure to long amosite asbestos (L= 13. 95 m; D= 0. 39 m) as positive control.

40|$|AbstractSub-chronic {{toxicity}} studies of 163 non-genotoxic chemicals were evaluated {{in order to}} predict the tumour outcome of 24 -month rat carcinogenicity studies obtained from the EFSA and ToxRef databases. Hundred eleven of the 148 chemicals that did not induce putative preneoplastic lesions in the sub-chronic study also did not induce tumours in the <b>carcinogenicity</b> <b>study</b> (True Negatives). Cellular hypertrophy {{appeared to be an}} unreliable predictor of carcinogenicity. The negative predictivity, the measure of the compounds evaluated that did not show any putative preneoplastic lesion in de sub-chronic studies and were negative in the carcinogenicity studies, was 75 %, whereas the sensitivity, a measure of the sub-chronic study to predict a positive carcinogenicity outcome was only 5 %. The specificity, the accuracy of the sub-chronic study to correctly identify non-carcinogens was 90 %. When the chemicals which induced tumours generally considered not relevant for humans (33 out of 37 False Negatives) are classified as True Negatives, the negative predictivity amounts to 97 %. Overall, the results of this retrospective study support the concept that chemicals showing no histopathological risk factors for neoplasia in a sub-chronic study in rats may be considered non-carcinogenic and do not require further testing in a <b>carcinogenicity</b> <b>study...</b>|$|E
