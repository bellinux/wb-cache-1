In conducting this work, GAO analyzed 62 <b>contract</b> <b>solicitations</b> from fiscal years 2007 and 2008 and met with 121 contracting officials.

40|$|This {{research}} {{reviews the}} {{intellectual property rights}} in software acquired by the Department of Defense (DoD). The intent {{of the study is}} to analyze the effectiveness of the DoD's policy concerning noncommercial software intellectual property rights. Surveys were developed to assess the current policy. Contracting officials in the military and commercial sector were the respondents to the interviews. The conclusions based on this research are that contracting officers do not fully understand the myriad of intellectual property rights management tools at their disposal. The research also uncovered the perception that DoD's overall policy in this area is fragmented and confusing. Recommendations include: (1) acquisition and contracting students of Federal acquisition programs should receive instruction in ADP or FIP (Federal Information Processing) acquisition, (2) acquisition and contracting students of Federal acquisition programs should receive increased class sessions on intellectual property rights, (3) DoD contracting personnel should increase usage of 'specifically negotiated license rights' in software contracts, and (4) DoD contracting personnel should strengthen software <b>contract</b> <b>solicitations.</b> NANAU.

5000|$|Several controversies arose {{over the}} H Street/Benning Road line in early 2012. According to United Streetcar, a {{streetcar}} manufacturing {{company based in}} Oregon, the city awarded United Streetcar $8.7 million in contracts to build trolley cars for the H Street/Benning Road line. Contracts were awarded in June 2011 and again in September 2011. On December 16, 2011, D.C. City Councilwoman Mary Cheh filed a [...] "disapproval resolution" [...] with the mayor's office, placing a 40-day hold on the contract after questions arose {{as to whether the}} contract called for the construction of two trolley cars (as the city claimed) or three (as Cheh believed). On December 21, 2011, Inekon Group filed a protest of the award with the D.C. Contract Appeals Board, claiming that cost/price trade-off analysis used by the city was inapporpriate. Streetcar proponents worried that the protest could delay the contract by up to 2.5 years, but DDOT moved much more quickly and canceled the contracts in early January 2012 after a formal internal review. In February, DDOT began the <b>contract</b> <b>solicitation</b> process anew. Due to the contract controversy, DDOT said it might begin running the H Street/Benning Road line with just three streetcars instead of five. D.C. City Council member Tommy Wells pressed DDOT to wait until it could run five trolley cars, arguing that with just three cars the streetcar system would not be convenient enough for passengers. Council member Mary Cheh, chair of the council's transportation committee, said the DDOT's management of the streetcar project had lost the confidence of the public and that she would seek legislation establishing an independent authority to run the system. [...] A new contract for vehicles was awarded in April, again to United Streetcar.|$|E

50|$|Cranberries are {{a kind of}} tart red berry {{produced}} by various plant species, but it is the large-fruited, or “American cranberry” (Vaccinium macrocarpon), that is farmed for commercial production. Currently, the main cranberry farming Canadian provinces are British Columbia, Québec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island. However, the lower temperatures present in the Eastern provinces require the use of irrigation and flooding to prevent frost damage and moisture loss. Wet harvesting is the common harvesting method used for cranberries that are to become cranberry juice. A paddled machine called a water reel harvester is used to separate the ripe cranberries from the vines, then collected through a large suction pipe and transported by truck to a processing plant. At the processing plant, the cranberries go through a sequence of fruit crushing, mash maceration, mash heating, juice pressing, and pasteurization to produce a cranberry concentrate that is separated from pulp. To prepare a cranberry juice/cocktail product, cranberry juice concentrate is reconstituted with varying amounts of water, specified by the <b>solicitation,</b> <b>contract,</b> or purchase order.|$|R
40|$|The {{rate for}} {{reimbursement}} of Facilities and Administrative (F&A, {{also referred to}} as indirect) costs is calculated according to the procedures set forth in OMB Circular A- 21 and is audited by the Federal Government.

These rates are also utilized by the university for non-federally sponsored projects. Non-federal extramurally sponsored projects are inclusive of those which result from <b>contract</b> and grant <b>solicitations</b> to state agencies, local governmental bodies and private sponsors.

40|$|Sponsored Report (for Acquisition Research Program) This {{research}} paper explores {{the use of}} the modular open systems approach (MOSA) as a method for implementing an evolutionary acquisition strategy and investigates the implications of using the MOSA on the contracting process. First, a background on evolutionary acquisition is presented from a perspective of current DoD acquisition regulations. Next, basic concepts of open systems are discussed, along with applications of the open systems approach to defense systems development and acquisition. The implications of using a modular open systems approach on the contracting process is then presented, with a focused discussion on the various contracting activities and documents related to each phase of the contracting process. The report uses the generally accepted phases of the <b>contracting</b> process''procurement planning, <b>solicitation</b> planning, <b>solicitation,</b> source selection, <b>contract</b> administration, and contract closeout to discuss the contracting activities and documents that should be affected by using a modular open systems approach. Additionally, a brief highlight of intellectual property issues is provided, along with a review of the applicable major regulatory provisions. The research concludes with the identification of the characteristics of a successful MOSA program procurement and resulting contract and provides areas for further study.

We provide condition studies, restoration recommendations, prioritization of need, restoration estimates, restoration specifications, bid and <b>contract</b> documents, bid <b>solicitation,</b> restoration project management, and appraisals exclusively for stained-glass windows. We have performed condition studies on some of America’s most important stained glass windows, including works by Tiffany Studios, John La Farge, Connick Studio, Willet Studio, Frank Lloyd Wright, and other important artists of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Our major projects include oversight of the restoration of the windows of Harvard University’s Memorial Hall; a comprehensive condition study of the windows of Frank Lloyd Wright’s Robie House; serving as consultant to H.
