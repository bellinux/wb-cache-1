40|$|Although {{the manual}} mode of stone carving is still quite frequent, modern world's need {{faster and more}} precise {{production}} of engraving and stone surfaces. Today, the stone market has become more selective and demand for special product and service is greater. Big problem in stone branches is large surface area, large dimension and weight of the stone workpiece that can't be produced by typical machine for stone engraving. In these situations portable stone <b>carving</b> <b>machine</b> can solve that problems, because the machine has less mass and easier to put the machine on the workpiece than the workpiece on the machine. It will also greatly reduce work time and increase productivity.

50|$|Carving wax is a smooth, non-brittle wax {{designed}} for <b>carving</b> and/or <b>machining.</b> Although the formulas for most commercial waxes are proprietary, most suppliers will state that hard waxes are some blend of waxes and plastics. This family of waxes has a hardness and consistency of plastic or softer wood. They {{can be cut}} or carved with knives, files and rotary or machine tools. To illustrate the usefulness {{of this type of}} wax, if one were to get a candle, mount it on a lathe and feed a tool into it, the wax would slough off like butter, stick to the tool and make a mess. Hard wax, on the other hand, will machine more like soft aluminum, giving fine edges and a fine finish if worked properly.|$|R

40|$|Linear motors, as {{direct-drive}} actuators, {{have been}} quickly developed within {{recent years and}} now they are widely applied in the industrial production area, such as automatic soldering, <b>carving</b> and embroidery <b>machines,</b> etc [1]. At present, linear permanent magnetic motors (LPMMs) are the mainstream of market due to their considerable force output performance with high power density and efficiency [2]. However, high cost of the permanent magnets (PMs) restricts the widespread use of LPMMs for certain control applications. On the other hand, the characteristics of the PMs are readily influenced by temperature variations and vibrations. Pure linear switched reluctance motors (LSRMs) intrigue the researchers' interests by their simple structure, high robustness, low cost without PMs, etc. Nevertheless, they have the disadvantages of low force output and efficiency. In order to increase the efficiency and force output of the LSRMs, some machines that are combined with PMs have been investigated in recent years [3, 4]. Most of the PMs are embedded into the main magnetic circuits of the motors, however, this inevitably increases the reluctance of the motors and deteriorates the continuity of flux lines, thus reducing the efficiency of the motors. In addition, cogging force is another defect that deteriorates the accuracy of position control applications based on such linear hybrid motors. Department of Electrical Engineerin...|$|R

40|$|The lobbies {{of hotels}} and banks, airport {{terminals}} and rail stations are often elegantly paved with polished natural stone, such as granite. While making a pleasant sight, glossy stone floors may become slippery when wet and dirt are brought in on peoples shoes. To prevent people slipping and injuring themselves, the natural stone floors of public buildings {{need to have}} a non-slip finish. The Fraunhofer Institute for Material and Beam Technology IWS in Dresden have developed a laser process for this purpose, which does not deteriorate the gloss and color intensity to the tiled floor. Conventionally, polished stone floors are provided with a non-slip or anti-skid finish by a form of suction pads, increasing the friction between shoe soles and the floor. The laser process produces the same effect, but is environmentally harmless and not affected by external influences. The pulsed laser beam is guided by two scanner mirrors and a special optical co nfiguration, allowing the treatment to proceed at extremely high speed and with exceptional precision. The <b>machine</b> <b>carves</b> 8, 000 to 10, 000 micro-craters per second into the stone slabs. Different degrees of non-slip effect can be achieved by varying the dimensions of the indentations and the distance between them. Depending on the safety each 0. 3 to 0. 5 millimeters apart. Despite the roughened surface, cleaning the floor is just as easy as before. The process was successfully tested in 1997 with a stationary pilot device. Since last year, it works on an industrial scale, applying the non-slip finish to stone slabs in the production line of a factory. Until recently, existing floors could only be given the conventional chemical treatment but now the available prototype mobile device can provide the non-slip surface finish in situ...|$|R
40|$|Novel {{printing}} and layering technologies that incorporate a raised or embossed surface have demonstrated {{new opportunities for}} novel applications. Textured images have been used extensively in the print industry as decorative decals and embellishments to enhance the surface qualities of packaging and prints. As the resolution and print quality has improved, and the technology has become more accessible, {{there are now more}} opportunities to explore texture in artworks, especially in relation to tactile printing for blind or visually impaired. Over the last two decades, museums have broadened the idea of cultural accessibility for blind people, for example, to cultural events and museums. Access to knowledge began by enabling users to engage with texts and printed word, and then as second hand experience through audio books and description about artefacts and events, and now the opportunity to give access to images, such as artworks, picture books and photographs, in museums whereby a second hand experience is replaced by first hand experience. On a practical level, day-to-day understanding of identifying information and things, ways of identifying colour and colour relationships has been developed by Okudera (2015) in the form of textile tags to convey colour information is a practical method to enable blind people to identify the colour of their clothes and to know that their clothes colour co-ordinated. A simple iron on tactile tag, based on the hue circle, enabled users to identify colour relationships. Ten small raised (rubber to the touch) dots are arranged around a Munsell hue circle each representing primary colours, along with three raised vertical dots in the centre to represent white, grey and black. In order to identify the representative colour, a bigger dot or hole is punctured into the tag (Okudera). Tactile pictures for blind can provide an enhanced understanding for the user. Appropriate methods for image segmentation is necessary to distinguish different parts of a picture. Traditional approaches use contours and patterns, which creates a distinct and recognisable shape and enables separate objects to identified. A contour arises on the boundary between two surfaces and is usually described by a line. Different textures can also be incorporated to convey an idea of a picture. Living Paintings provide touch to see pictures, which can range from current events such as the Olympics to educational books such as dinosaurs to cultural object such as from the British Museum London. These relief tactile pictures use highly simplified shapes, but provide essential unambiguous information. The pages are vacuum formed using thermo plastic sheet over a <b>carved</b> or <b>machined</b> board, and then ring bound together with other pages to form a flip-book. This cheap method means that books can be mass-produced, widely circulated, and are fairly robust. However, we would argue that accuracy is not even wanted in most of the applications, as a certain degree of interpretation of the full body of things may be more valuable and welcome than a cold replica. An interesting project, where interpretation and exploration is fundamental, is demonstrated by Studios Durero. The Didu project in collaboration with the Prado Madrid, has attempted to make classic paintings accessible to visually impaired people through relief prints. Their designers worked alongside art specialists and with visually impaired people to understand how to either exaggerate textures already present in a painting, or to create new ones that would be visually relevant but needed to be exaggerated to be perceived by blind participants. Likewise 3 D Photoworks have studied how to make fine art prints accessible by building a high-relief surface of paintings, and Tooteko use sound and touch to assist the user to explore a range of images. This short presentation will discuss aspects and requirements of relief, tactile 2. 5 D printing, and surface manufacturing in relation to tactile printing for the visually impaired...|$|R
60|$|The {{house was}} quiet, the {{children}} having gone to bed, and he groped {{his way through}} the dark parlour to his den, turning on the electric switch, sinking into an armchair, and lighting a cigar. He liked this room of his, which still retained something of that flavour of a refuge and sanctuary it had so eminently possessed in the now forgotten days of matrimonial conflict. One of the few elements of agreement he had held in common with the late Mrs. Ditmar was a similarity of taste in household decoration, and they had gone together to a great emporium in Boston to choose the furniture and fittings. The lamp in the centre of the table was a bronze column supporting a hemisphere of heavy red and emerald glass, the colours woven into an intricate and bizarre design, after the manner of the art nouveau--so the zealous salesman had informed them. Cora Ditmar, when exhibiting this lamp to admiring visitors, had remembered the phrase, though her pronunciation of it, according to the standard of the Sorbonne, left something to be desired. The table and chairs, of heavy, shiny oak marvellously and precisely <b>carved</b> by <b>machines,</b> matched the big panels of the wainscot. The windows were high in the wall, thus preventing any intrusion from the clothes-yard on which they looked. The bookcases, protected by leaded panes, held countless volumes of the fiction from which Cora Ditmar had derived her knowledge of the great world outside of Hampton, together with certain sets she had bought, not only as ornaments, but with a praiseworthy view to future culture,--such as Whitmarsh's Library of the Best Literature. These volumes, alas, were still uncut; but some of the pages of the novels--if one cared to open them--were stained with chocolate. The steam radiator was a decoration in itself, the fireplace set in the red and yellow tiles that made the hearth. Above the oak mantel, in a gold frame, was a large coloured print of a Magdalen, doubled up in grief, with a glory of loose, Titian hair, chosen by Ditmar himself as expressing the nearest possible artistic representation of his ideal of the female form. Cora Ditmar's objections on the score of voluptuousness and of insufficient clothing had been vain. She had recognized no immorality of sentimentality in the art itself; what she felt, and with some justice, was that this particular Magdalen was unrepentant, and that Ditmar knew it. And the picture remained an offence to her as long as she lived. Formerly he had enjoyed the contemplation of this figure, reminding him, as it did, of mellowed moments in conquests of the past; suggesting also possibilities of the future. For he had been quick to discount the attitude of bowed despair, the sop flung by a sensuous artist to Christian orthodoxy. He had been sceptical about despair--feminine despair, which could always be cured by gifts and baubles. But to-night, as he raised his eyes, he felt a queer sensation marring the ecstatic perfection of his mood. That quality in the picture which so long had satisfied and entranced him had now become repellent, an ugly significant reflection of something--something in himself he was suddenly eager to repudiate and deny. It was with a certain amazement that he found himself on his feet with the picture in his hand, gazing at the empty space where it had hung. For he had had no apparent intention of obeying that impulse. What should he do with it? Light the fire and burn it--frame and all? The frame {{was an integral part of}} it. What would his housekeeper say? But now that he had actually removed it from the wall he could not replace it, so he opened the closet door and thrust it into a corner among relics which had found refuge there. He had put his past in the closet; yet the relief he felt was mingled with the peculiar qualm that follows the discovery of symptoms never before remarked. Why should this woman have this extraordinary effect of making him dissatisfied with himself? He sat down again and tried to review the affair from that first day when he had surprised in her eyes the flame dwelling in her. She had completely upset his life, increasingly distracted his mind until now he could imagine no peace unless he possessed her. Hitherto he had recognized in his feeling for her nothing but that same desire he had had for other women, intensified to a degree never before experienced. But this sudden access of morality--he did not actually define it as such--was disquieting. And in the feverish, semi-objective survey he was now making of his emotional tract he was discovering the presence of other disturbing symptoms such as an unwonted tenderness, a consideration almost amounting to pity which at times he had vaguely sensed yet never sought imaginatively to grasp. It bewildered him by hampering a ruthlessness hitherto absolute. The fierceness of her inflamed his passion, yet he recognized dimly behind this fierceness an instinct of self-protection--and he thought of her in this moment as a struggling bird that fluttered out of his hands when they were ready to close over her. So it had been to-night. He might have kept her, prevented her from taking the car. Yet he had let her go! There came again, utterly to blot this out, the memory of her lips.|$|R
