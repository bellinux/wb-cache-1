Around 1990, French bottom trawlers began to fish for Portuguese dogfish and leafscale gulper sharks (<b>Centrophorus</b> <b>squamosus)</b> west of the British Isles for meat and livers; these two species are together referred to as siki. The siki catch peaked at 3,284 tons in 1996 before declining to 1,939 tons in 1999. The French have since been joined by Norwegian, Irish, and Scottish longliners and trawlers, making the Portuguese dogfish a significant component of deepwater fisheries in the northwest Atlantic. While stocks off Portugal seem to be stable for now, stocks off the British Isles have diminished substantially in recent years; this may reflect the disparity between the less massified Portuguese fishery and the commercial French fishery. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Near Threatened, because of its commercial value and low reproductive productivity.|$|E

40|$|ICES {{received}} this {{request from the}} European Commission: “During the last negotiations for fixing the fishing opportunities for EU vessels for certain deep-sea fish stocks for 2013 and 2014, some Member States ’ delegates asked for a revision {{to the list of}} species of deep–sea sharks (Annex of Council Regulation (EU) No 1262 / 2012). In particular the request referred that black-mouth catshark (Galeus melastomus) be excluded from the list and low fin gulper shark (Centrophorus lusitanicus) be included in the list. The rationale behind the former case responds to consider the species as only demersal and not illustrative of deep-sea habitats. The latter regards to landings in ICES area IX, where the landings of other morphologically very similar species such as gulper shark (<b>Centrophorus</b> <b>squamosus)</b> may have been underreported due to misidentification among both species. Concerning deep-sea sharks, the main commercial species are considered depleted and no directed fishing should take place. The Council agreed to fix TAC equal to zero since 2012, and, therefore, the content of the list of species of deep-sea sharks is deemed to be essential. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Alkylglycerols (alkyl-Gro) are ether lipids {{abundant}} in the liver of some elasmobranch fish species such as ratfishes and some sharks. Shark liver oil from <b>Centrophorus</b> <b>squamosus</b> (SLO), or alkyl-Gro mix from this source, have several in vivo biological activities including stimulation of hematopoiesis and immunological defences, sperm quality improvement, or anti-tumor and anti-metastasis activities. Several mechanisms are suggested for these multiple activities, resulting from incorporation of alkyl-Gro into membrane phospholipids, and lipid signaling interactions. Natural alkyl-Gro mix from SLO contains several alkyl-Gro, varying by chain length and unsaturation. Six prominent constituents of natural alkyl-Gro mix, namely 12 : 0, 14 : 0, 16 : 0, 18 : 0, 16 : 1 n- 7, and 18 : 1 n- 9 alkyl-Gro, were synthesized and tested for anti-tumor and anti-metastatic activities on a model of grafted tumor in mice (3 LL cells). 16 : 1 and 18 : 1 alkyl-Gro showed strong activity in reducing lung metastasis number, while saturated alkyl-Gro had weaker (16 : 0) or no (12 : 0, 14 : 0, 18 : 0) effect. Multiple compounds and mechanisms are probably involved in the multiple activities of natural alkyl-Gro...|$|E
40|$|Aspects of {{the biology}} of three {{exploited}} sharks (Elasmobranchii: Squalidae) from the continental slopes of the Rockall Trough and Porcupine Bank (NE Atlantic) were examined using specimens taken during trawl and long-line surveys (December 1995 to December 1999) and commercial samples obtained from trawlers (March 1997 to June 1998). The species under study were Centroscymnus coelolepis, <b>Centrophorus</b> <b>squamosus,</b> and Deania calceus. The entire depth range (300 m – 1, 800 m) of each species was sampled. C. squamosus and D. calceus were abundant between 700 m and 900 m. C. coelolepis was more abundant deeper (1, 300 m) but gravid females were more abundant in shallower waters. Small specimens of each species were absent from the study area. Trawls and long-lines selected for different size ranges of C. coelolepis and D. calceus, though not C. squamosus. Deepwater bobbin and French high headline trawls did not select for different size ranges of C. coelolepis. Unlike the other species D. calceus is not landed. Discard rates from long-liners exceeded 40 % of total catch depending on depth fished. While percentage discard rates from trawlers were lower, an estimated 745 t of this species were discarded in 1996 alone. Sexual maturity was achieved at large size, more than 75 % of maximum length in each species. No evidence of seasonal cycles in reproduction was found from spermatogenic analysis or the occurrence of maturity stages. Mean ovarian fecundity was low; C. squamosus, 8, C. coelolepis and D. calceus 13. Dorsal spine sections were used for age estimation. Significant positive regressions of spine width and total length were found and the growth rates of first and second spines were not significantly different. Estimates of 21 - 70 years (C. squamosus) and 11 - 35 years (D. calceus) were obtained. Agreement within 1 year was found for more than 93 % of D. calceus and 88 % of C. squamosus first and second spines. Empirical and von Bertalanffy growth data suggest that growth had slowed down or ceased {{before the onset of}} maturity. Estimates of natural mortality (M) for C. squamosus (0. 066 – 0. 087) and D. calceus (0. 116 - 0. 177) were low. Fishing mortality (F) for D. calceus was estimated to have reached the level of M for females but below M for males. This study suggests that these species have conservative life-history strategies. No management plan currently exists for the multi-species deepwater fishery in the northeast Atlantic. In the absence of suitable abundance indices, stock assessment should be based on known life history parameters of target and by-catch species. Such an approach will facilitate the rational management of the fishery. Correspondance à: Maurice Clarke, Marine Institute, Abbotstown, Dublin 15, République d’Irlande.

40|$|A {{comparison}} {{was made}} between catches from deepwater trawl and longline surveys (1993 – 2000) in the Northeast Atlantic. Longline catches {{were dominated by}} elasmobranchs, particularly squalid sharks and species numbers were low. Trawl catches had higher species numbers, with more teleosts, though elasmobranchs were still an important component. Species composition of the catch was depth dependent. Comparative trawl and longline surveys of the eastern and southern slopes of the Rockall Trough (west and north of Ireland) were used to examine size-selectivity. Trawls and longlines selected for significantly different size frequency distributions of Centroscymnus coelolepis and Deania calceus, though not for <b>Centrophorus</b> <b>squamosus.</b> These data highlight some important aspects of behavior of the species studying relation to fishing gears. Smaller C. coelolepis were selected by longlines than trawls, suggesting that smaller sharks were present at a considerable height above the seabed, {{out of reach of}} trawls, but attracted to baited hooks. In the case of D. calceus, larger females were selected by hooks, but were not present in trawl catches, possibly indicating their ability to escape towed gears. Trawl selectivity ogives were constructed for D. calceus and ogives for C. coelolepis and C. squamosus were simulated, using available data. Results suggest that longlines are not as selective for C. coelolepis as trawls. Selectivity ogives for D. calceus were similar in form, but longlines selected bigger individuals. Life history studies suggest that these species cannot sustain high fishing pressures. The implications of these results for the management of fisheries taking elasmobranchs are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Squaliforme {{sharks are}} a common but {{relatively}} vulnerable bycatch in many deep water fisheries. Eleven species of squaliforme shark are commonly caught at depths of 200 – 1200 m on Chatham Rise, New Zealand, and their diversity suggests they might occupy different niches. The diets of 133 Deania calcea and 295 Squalus acanthias were determined from examination of stomach contents. The diet of D. calcea was characterised by mesopelagic fishes, and S. acanthias by benthic to pelagic fishes, but was more adaptive and included likely scavenging. Multivariate analyses found the most important predictors of diet variability in S. acanthias were year, bottom temperature, longitude, and fish weight. The diet of the nine other commonly caught squaliforme sharks was reviewed, and the spatial and depth distribution of all species on Chatham Rise described from research bottom trawl survey catches. The eleven species had {{a variety of different}} diets, and depth and location preferences, consistent with niche separation to reduce interspecific competition. Four trophic groups were identified, characterised by: mesopelagic fishes and invertebrates (Centroselachus crepidater, D. calcea, and Etmopterus lucifer); mesopelagic and benthopelagic fishes and invertebrates (Centroscymnus owstoni, Etmopterus baxteri); demersal and benthic fishes (<b>Centrophorus</b> <b>squamosus,</b> Dalatias licha, Proscymnodon plunketi); and a generalist diet of fishes and invertebrates (S. acanthias).

40|$|The present survey {{took place}} {{over a period of}} 12 days in August 1997 along the eastern slope of Rockall Trough between 53 and 58 ºN {{including}} the Northern slope of the Porcupine Bank. Fishing was carried out in six separate areas, in depths between 300 and 2, 925 meters. The primary objective of the survey was to obtain samples of chondricthyan and teleost fish for the Marine Institute (MI) deepwater research programme, for contaminant analysis of fish by the MI chemistry section and for food technology analysis at the Teagasc National Food Centre. The survey was carried out on the Norwegian commercial long-liner "Skarheim," using commercial deep-water autoline gear. In total over 70, 000 hooks were set during the trip and on average 80 % of these were baited. In total 20 species of chondricthyan and 18 species of teleost fish were taken. Among the most abundant species in the catch were leafscale gulper shark <b>Centrophorus</b> <b>squamosus</b> (36 %), bird beak dogfish Deania calcea (21 %), Portuguese dogfish Centrascyflium coefofepis (13 %), tusk, Brosme brosme (11 %) and mora, Mora mora (6 %). Over the entire survey, discarding was estimated as 30 % of the total catch. The main species discarded were bird beak dogfish and greater lantern shark Etmopterus princeps. Catch per 1, 000 hooks showed that highest abundances were found at 600 - 1, 100 metres throughout the whole fishing area. Three settings were made at depths between 2, 000 and 3, 000 meters.

40|$|Deep-water sharks exhibit species-specific {{reproductive}} strategies, {{which include}} segregation by sex, size and reproductive stage. However, {{due to the}} wide spatial distribution of most species, available information, usually collected at a regional scale, is usually not adequate to infer species reproductive spatial dynamics. This study draws together information {{on the distribution of}} reproductive stages of three species of squaliform sharks: Portuguese dogfish Centroscymnus coelolepis (Somniosidae), leafscale gulper shark <b>Centrophorus</b> <b>squamosus</b> (Centrophoridae) and birdbeak dogfish Deania calcea (Centrophoridae), gathering data from several geographical areas from the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans. For each species we analysed the sex ratio and the spatial patterns of reproductive stages within regions, considering the influence of geographical area, depth, season, temperature and salinity. The combination of statistical methods used in this study successfully identified a number of life history patterns which reflect different use of habitats by sex and life cycle stage. Pregnant females of the three species are spatially segregated, inhabiting shallower and/or warmer waters. In the case of the leafscale gulper shark this segregation might be associated with large scale migrations. In contrast, in Portuguese dogfish all adult maturity stages occur in the same geographical area. Pregnant female birdbeak dogfish were rare in all samples. Larger immature specimens of all the three species distribute deeper than the remaining maturity stages in most of the regions analysed. Mature males of leafscale gulper shark and birdbeak dogfish were more broadly distributed than mature females, supporting the possibility of sex-biased dispersal. Neonates and small sized specimens were scarce in the Northeast Atlantic potentially explained by their concentration in nurseries, and/or by gear selectivity. Management measures will benefit from considering the geographic scale of demographic variation between species. However, standardized collaborative approaches will be needed for comprehensive assessment. Publicado...|$|E
40|$|Portuguese {{commercial}} Elasmobranch landings were {{analysed for}} the period 1986 – 2009 and revealed that some species may be in danger of overfishing. Landings totalled 122, 515 mt, {{with an average of}} 5, 105 mt landed yearly, with captured sharks, skates and rays representing 8 orders, 14 families and 44 species. Annual landings for the fishery generally decreased over time, with a corresponding increase in price per kilogram. The most landed group, skates (Raja sp.), accounted for 33 % of the landings, or 40, 344 mt. They were followed by lesser spotted catsharks (Scyliorhinus sp.), Portuguese dogfish (Centroscymnus coelolepis), leafscale gulper sharks (<b>Centrophorus</b> <b>squamosus),</b> blue sharks (Prionace glauca) and gulper sharks (Centrophorus granulosus) (accounting for 12 %, 11 %, 10 %, 9 % and 8 % of the landings, respectively). In the absence of CPUE data, comparative trends of landings and price over time were used as an indicator of the status of specific Elasmobranch species. Centrophorus granulosus, smoothounds (Mustelus sp.), torpedo rays (Torpedo sp.), requiem sharks (Carcharhinus sp.) and angel sharks (Squatina sp.) displayed indications of possible over-exploitation, with significantly decreasing landings and increasing prices over time, and merit the focus of future research. The pattern shown by fishing effort over time (i. e. number of fishing vessels over time) displayed a marked decrease, although this was substantially less than the decrease shown by landings of the species mentioned earlier. It is therefore unlikely that such a decrease in landings is justified solely by a decrease in number of fishing vessels. Similarly, the increase in price shown for all species was largely superior to the increase in inflation, which would suggest that the increase in inflation alone would not account for the increase in price. All results and data corroborate the notion that some species are, in fact, over-exploited and in need of immediate management and conservation measurements. These findings were substantiated by min/max auto-correlation factor analysis (MAFA), which shows that the most important trend is that of a decrease in landings of those species where overfishing in indicated.
