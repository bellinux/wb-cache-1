5000|$|A logging tool {{description}} {{from the}} Lumberman's Museum at Patten, Maine, reads in part: [...] "A <b>cant</b> <b>dog</b> or cant hook {{was used for}} lifting, turning, and prying logs when loading sleds and on the drive. At first, a swivel hook on a pole with nothing {{to hold it in}} position was used. This was called a swing dingle." [...] However, the term swing dingle is more often published as being a type of logging sled. These early types are also called a ring dog or ring dog cant hook. In 1858, Joseph Peavey, a blacksmith in Stillwater, Maine, made a rigid clasp to encircle the <b>cant</b> <b>dog</b> handle with the hook on one side. It moved up and down, but not sideways. All loggers have used it ever since." ...|$|E
5000|$|The peavey {{was named}} for {{blacksmith}} Joseph Peavey of Upper Stillwater, Maine, who invented the tool as a refinement to the cant hook (also known as a [...] "cant dog") in the 1850s. Many lumberjacks use the terms interchangeably, though a peavey has a spike {{in the end of}} the handle, and a <b>cant</b> <b>dog</b> has a blunt end or possibly small teeth for friction.|$|E
