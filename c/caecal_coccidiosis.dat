40|$|A farm of two broiler flocks fed {{from one}} day old to 56 days of age a diet {{naturally}} contaminated with high level of Aflatoxin (AF), were suffered from <b>caecal</b> <b>coccidiosis</b> at 35 days of age Aflatoxin levels in feed commodities and mixed feed were determined using ELISA test. Results of ELISA showed that the average level of corn, soybean and mixed feeds contamination with aflatoxin were 1915, ppb, 229 ppb and 860 ppb respectively. Diagnosis of <b>caecal</b> <b>coccidiosis</b> was confirmed by clinical signs, post-mortem findings, fecal oocyst excretion per gram, oocyt size, morphological characteristic of eggs, lesion score and schizonts size. The significance of AF as predisposing factor to coccidiosis infection was discussed...|$|E
40|$|Infections were {{produced}} in patent caeca by administering oocysts of Eimeria tenella per os to fowls {{in which one}} caecum was ligated. The caeca were later challenged with sporozoites and {{it was found that}} a resistance to infection had been acquired by the previously uninfected ligated caeca. The observations indicate that resistance to <b>caecal</b> <b>coccidiosis</b> develops in areas not previously exposed to parasitism by E. tenella. It is suggested that the immunity acquired by the ligated caeca is mediated through the circulation either by humoral antibodies or by lymphoid cells, or by a combination of both...|$|E
40|$|The present {{investigation}} was undertaken to evaluate histo-pathological, haemotological and biochemical changes in broiler chicken naturally infected with Eimeria tenella. A Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) based assay {{was also done}} for the detection, identification and differentiation of pathogenic species of Eimeria in poultry. Post mortem examination revealed petechial haemorrhages, oedema, necrosis and sloughing of caecal epithelium. Histopathological evidence showed leakage of blood, oedema and necrosis. Haemotological studies revealed that coccidial infection caused significant decrease {{in the value of}} haemoglobin and Packed Cell Volume (PCV). The value of Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV) and Mean Corpuscular Haemoglobin Concentration (MCHC) revealed that <b>caecal</b> <b>coccidiosis</b> resulted in macrocytic hypochromic anaemia. Biochemical serum analysis of coccidial infected chicken showed a significant increase in level of glucose, Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) and Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) while there was a significant decrease in the level of alkaline phosphatase (SAP) and cholesterol. In PCR using specific primers for E. tenella only the ITS 1 regions of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) could be amplified...|$|E
40|$|Coccidiosis has a {{major impact}} on poultry {{industry}} as it affects broiler and layer birds of all age groups. <b>Caecal</b> <b>coccidiosis,</b> caused by Eimeria tenella is a very devastating enteric disease in broiler,which involves huge economic loss In present study, experimental infective dose of Eimeria tenella isolated from field was determined in broiler chicken and subsequent alterations in different plasma biochemical constituents were evaluated at interval of 5 th, 7 th and 9 th day of post inoculation (PI) with the selected dose of 20000 - 25000 sporulated oocyst per bird. The dose was selected based on titration. A significant increase in plasma glucose, total cholesterol level and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activity were observed where as a significant decrease in the level of total plasma protein, albumin, globulin, triglyceride and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity were evident during infection. Highest degree of infection was found on 7 th day PI. Onward 9 th day of PI onward clinical recovery was confirmed on the basis of pathognomonic caecal lesion score, clinical signs and symptoms.

40|$|Aim: To {{assess the}} humoral immune {{response}} of Eimeria tenella sporozoites in broiler chickens by a developed enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the efficacy in terms of bodyweight, lesion score and oocysts excretion in immunized broilers. Materials and Methods: Purified live E. tenella sporozoites were administered subcutaneously in neck region of broiler chickens in the early life (first week) at different concentrations. The potency of the sporozoite vaccine as assessed by IgG levels and the performance in immunized broilers as assessed by body weight, lesion score and oocysts excretion in faeces after challenge with 10, 000 live E. tenella oocysts at 49 days of age were evaluated. Results: The chickens of group (T 4) immunized with 20 µg of antigen on day 6 showed an increase in IgG levels (0. 161 ± 0. 004) two weeks post immunization (PI) peaking (0. 399 ± 0. 016) at 5 weeks PI. The mean weekly weight gain (g) after challenge, at 56 days of age was high in T 4 (148 ± 4. 751 g) with a low mean lesion score (2. 5 ± 0. 22) and mean oocyst output (x 103 oocytes per gram (OPG) in faeces (100. 3 ± 45. 72) when compared to unimmunised infected controls. Conclusion: An early but partial immune response against <b>caecal</b> <b>coccidiosis</b> could be achieved by immunization with E. tenella specific sporozoites in chickens of {{less than a week}} old. Moreover, the performance of immunized chickens as indicated by weight gain, lesion score and oocyst output was found to be superior to the unimmunized infected controls...|$|E
40|$|Proteins {{derived from}} the rhoptry {{secretory}} organelles are crucial for the invasion and survival of apicomplexan parasites within host cells. The rhoptries are club-shaped organelles that contain two distinct subpopulations of proteins that localise to separate compartments of the organelle. Proteins from the neck region (rhoptry neck proteins, RON) are secreted early in invasion and a subset of these is critical for the formation and function of the moving junction between parasite and host membranes. Proteins from the bulb compartment (rhoptry protein, ROP) are released later, into the nascent parasitophorous vacuole {{where they have a}} role in modifying the vacuolar environment, and into the host cell where they act as key determinants of virulence through their ability to interact with host cell signalling pathways, causing an array of downstream effects. In this paper we present the results of an extensive proteomics analysis of the rhoptry organelles from the coccidian parasite, Eimeria tenella, which is a highly pathogenic parasite of the domestic chicken causing severe <b>caecal</b> <b>coccidiosis.</b> Several different classes of rhoptry protein have been identified. First are the RON proteins that have varying degrees of similarity to proteins of Toxoplasma gondii and Neospora caninum. For some RON families, E. tenella expresses more than one gene product and many of the individual RON proteins are differentially expressed between the sporozoite and merozoite developmental stages. The E. tenella sporozoite rhoptry expresses only a limited repertoire of proteins with homology to known ROP proteins from other coccidia, including just two secreted ROP kinases, both of which appear to be equipped for catalytic activity. Finally, a large number of hitherto undescribed proteins that map to the sporozoite rhoptry are identified, many of which have orthologous proteins encoded within the genomes of T. gondii and N. caninum. © 2012...|$|E
