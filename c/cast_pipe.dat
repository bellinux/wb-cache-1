40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{corrosion}} is the predominant mechanism for the deterioration of <b>cast</b> iron <b>pipes,</b> leading to the reduction of pipe capacity and ultimate collapse of the pipes. In order to assess the remaining service life of corroded <b>cast</b> iron <b>pipes,</b> it is imperative to understand the mechanisms of corrosion over a long term and to develop models for pipe deterioration. Although many studies have been carried out to determine the corrosion behavior of cast iron, little research has been undertaken to understand how <b>cast</b> iron <b>pipes</b> behave over a longer time scale than hours, days, or weeks. The present paper intends to fill the gap regarding the long-term corrosion behaviour of <b>cast</b> iron <b>pipes</b> in the absence of historical data. In this paper, a comprehensive experimental program is presented in which the corrosion behaviour of three exservice pipes was thoroughly examined in three simulated service environments. It has been found in the paper that localised corrosion is the primary form of corrosion of <b>cast</b> iron water <b>pipes.</b> It has also been found that the microstructure of cast irons is a key factor that affects the corrosion behaviour of <b>cast</b> iron <b>pipes.</b> The paper concludes that long-term tests on corrosion behaviour of <b>cast</b> iron <b>pipes</b> can help develop models for corrosion-induced deterioration of the pipes for use in predicting the remaining service life of the pipes...|$|R

40|$|Exploitation {{investigations}} of a centrifugally <b>cast</b> <b>pipe</b> of austenitic cast steel {{indicated a significant}} influence of its microstructure on functional properties. Determination {{of the possibility of}} forming the microstructure and properties of the investigated cast steel by heat treatments was the aim of the presented paper. According to the Standard ASTM A 297, material from which the pipe was made is determined as HF type cast steel. The solution heat treatment from a temperature of 1080 °C was performed and followed by the microstructure observations and hardness measurements. It was found, that the solution heat treatment from this temperature will notsignificantly improve the material strength properties. However, it will visibly influence its fracture toughness. An influence of agingperformed after the solution heat treatment on microstructure and hardness was also investigated. Cast steel was aged for 1 hour at 600 °C (solution heat treatment from 1080 °C). On the basis of the obtained results it was found, that the solution heat treatment temperature should be the maximum permissible by the Standard i. e. 1150 °C. Heating the supersaturated material (from 1150 °C) even toa temperature of 600 °C should not cause the carbide precipitation in a form of the continuous network in grain boundaries, which woulddecrease fracture toughness of the investigated cast steel. Due to fracture toughness a service exposure of this material should not exceed 600 °C. The permissible service exposure up to 900 °C, given for this material in the Standard, is correct only on account of heat and high temperature creep resistance but not fracture toughness...|$|E

40|$|Work at the University of Newcastle and {{by others}} in {{developing}} methodologies for the Condition Assessment {{of cast iron}} water mains suggests a degree of correlation between the long- term corrosion rates of various cohorts of <b>cast</b> iron <b>pipes</b> and their method of manufacture. Recent, preliminary data indicates that the older, statically <b>cast</b> <b>pipes</b> perform better than the spun Delavaud pipes introduced into Australasia in 1929 and these, in turn, have better performance than the 'Super Delavaud' pipes manufactured between 1941 and the mid 1970 's when cast iron was superseded by Ductile iron material. These observations differ somewhat from the classical conclusions by Romanoff for USmade pipes. Samples from various cast and spun <b>cast</b> iron <b>pipes</b> exhumed in the Sydney and Newcastle region of NSW and originally installed in the period 1909 to 1974 were subjected to metallographic and chemical analysis, {{as well as a}} micro hardness survey, in order to determine differences that may account for this behavior. Elemental segregation mapping of minor elements of each pipe sample was also obtained by SEM/EDS. The preliminary results show that elemental segregation of phosphorus, silicon and other elements did not show any pattern that might account for the better corrosion resistance of the older statically <b>cast</b> <b>pipes</b> and that microstructural differences caused by widely different regimes of cooling rate and heat treatment offer the best basis for the corrosion performance variations. However, at this time the precise relationships between complex microstructures and corrosion resistance remain to be established...|$|R

40|$|Cast iron {{was used}} in the water {{industry}} prior to 1970 and a large number of <b>cast</b> iron <b>pipes</b> still remain as trunk mains. These pipes have been subjected to different levels of corrosion and variety of loading conditions. This leads <b>cast</b> iron <b>pipes</b> to fail in the field without prior warning. Water utilities are seeking solutions to optimise <b>cast</b> iron <b>pipe</b> renewal and rehabilitation programs for critical water mains (diameter ≥ 300 mm). A new experimental set-up has been developed at Monash University in order to perform burst testing of large diameter <b>cast</b> iron <b>pipes</b> (diameter ≥ 300 mm). A section of <b>cast</b> iron <b>pipe,</b> extracted during maintenance in Sydney, was laser scanned to determine the remaining thickness of the pipe (minimum of 7 - 8 mm at the most critical patches). Although the pipe was pressurised to 3. 6 MPa, catastrophic failure did not occur. Water leakage from the two critically corroded patches was observed at around 3. 25 - 3. 45 MPa internal pressure. Strain results on the outer pipe surface were greater than the strain measured during tensile testing of the same pipe material. A 3 -D finite element model using the scanned pipe dimensions was able to predict the maximum pressure at pipe failure (~ 3. 7 MPa) within the range of leaking water pressure level observed in the experiment...|$|R
40|$|Cast iron was the {{dominant}} material for buried pipes for water networks {{prior to the}} 1970 s in Australia and overseas. At present, many water utilities still have {{a significant amount of}} ageing <b>cast</b> iron <b>pipes.</b> <b>Cast</b> iron is a brittle material and when large diameter <b>cast</b> iron <b>pipes</b> (diameters above 300 mm) further deteriorate, the consequences of failure can be substantial. Focusing on the likelihood of failure to assist risk assessment, this paper examines the performance of large-diameter <b>cast</b> iron <b>pipes</b> using probabilistic analysis, incorporating uncertainties of governing variables. Finite element analysis is first conducted to study the physical mechanism of buried pipes subjected to complex environmental conditions. The deterioration of <b>cast</b> iron <b>pipes</b> due to corrosion is considered on the basis of recent research. The uncertainties of governing variables, such as the physical properties of soil, cast iron, water pressure and corrosion patterns, in pipe failure risk assessment are considered. Using probabilistic physical modelling, the lifetime probability of failure is derived and a time-dependent sensitivity analysis is presented. The results of this probabilistic physical modelling are compared with cohorts of failure data from two Australian water utilities to examine the underlying trends from both physical modelling and statistical analysis...|$|R
