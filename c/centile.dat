40|$|Background: The {{adoption}} in May 2009 by the UK of the WHO 2006 standard necessitated {{the provision of}} UK-based birth <b>centiles</b> for pre-term infants. The pre-existing British 1990 reference birth <b>centiles,</b> used in the UK since 1995, had been biased by the inclusion of post-natal data. Aim: To describe {{the construction of new}} UK birth <b>centiles</b> for weight, length and head circumference, based on British 1990 reference data, but excluding post-natal data. Subjects and methods: Birth data from the five original studies, collected between 1983 - 1993, were pooled and analysed by the LMS method, for the sexes separately. In addition, sex-specific composite <b>centiles</b> were constructed for infants born at term (37 - 42 completed weeks). Results: The birth data included 9443 weights, 985 lengths and 1841 head circumferences, covering 23 - 44 weeks gestation. The analysis provided LMS tables defining reference <b>centiles</b> for weight and head circumference from 23 - 42 weeks and for length from 26 - 42 weeks. The term <b>centiles</b> are for use at age 0 on the post-natal 0 - 1 year chart. Conclusion: These new <b>centiles,</b> replacing those of the British 1990 reference, are more accurate than their predecessors which were biased due to the inclusion of post-natal data...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} a series of papers which focused on creating age-, sex-, and ethnicity-specific body fat <b>centiles</b> and the concordance of those <b>centiles</b> with other commonly used childhood obesity indices. Anthropometric and body composition data of 5 to 18 year olds were taken from a large, multi-ethnic, nationally-representative sample participating in one of three cycles of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys. Percent body fat (%BF) was calculated using tricep and subscapular skinfold measurements within the commonly used Slaughter equations. %BF growth curves were created for white, black, and Mexican-American children and adolescents. Values were provided so that future researchers can identify children based on these reference data. In addition, the concordance of single-value body fat cutpoints, Body Mass Index (BMI) <b>centiles,</b> Waist Circumference (WC) <b>centiles</b> and %BF <b>centiles</b> was examined. It was found that BMI and WC <b>centiles</b> demonstrated a reasonable level of agreement with the single-value %BF cutpoints of 25 % and 30 % in boys and girls, respectively. However, current Centers for Disease Control BMI cutpoints for obesity have low sensitivity and high specificity when compared to these values. Further, BMI and WC <b>centiles</b> agreed more consistently with single-value %BF cutpoints in boys than girls. Using receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves, it was indicated that %BF <b>centiles</b> corresponded consistently with currently used BMI cutpoints for overweight and obesity. Furthermore, the values of sensitivity, specificity, and area under the ROC indicated no large discrepancies between the sexes or among ethnic groups. The optimal %BF values identified at younger ages were well below the single-value %BF cutoffs of 25 % and 30 % fat. The LMS-derived %BF <b>centiles</b> can be used to improve agreement between %BF measures and current BMI classification systems. Single-value, or static, %BF thresholds are not sensitive to growth and maturation and should not be used across the pediatric age range...|$|R

40|$|A self-selected {{sample of}} 417 urban and 379 rural {{preschool}} children attending the under- 5 s clinics was weighed in Sierra Leone. The individual weights {{were related to}} the weight-for-age Harvard 3 rd <b>centiles</b> and 80 % levels of the Harvard medians. In this analysis there were considerable discrepancies between the sexes. Further investigation showed that the distribution of the weight-for-age Harvard <b>centiles</b> for girls is much wider than the distribution of the Harvard <b>centiles</b> for boys. These distributions appear to be unusual when compared with those from London and Hong Kong studies. Accordingly, use of the weight-for-age Harvard <b>centiles</b> may lead to inaccuracy in the assessment of the nutritional status of preschool children. The "percentage method" as suggested by Jelliffe (1966) and Gomez et al. (1956) does not take account of the normal range of distribution of the standards. This study has shown that the 80 % levels of sex-specific median weight-for-age occupy positions as much as 600 g below the sex-specific 3 rd <b>centiles</b> for Hong Kong Chinese children, while the 80 % levels closely follow the 3 rd <b>centiles</b> for London children in the preschool age group. Thus the Hong Kong 80 % levels are not comparable with the London 80 % levels.

40|$|Background: Large-for-gestational-age (LGA) or macrosomic infants are {{associated}} with adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. It is unclear if these associations are stronger using customised birthweight <b>centiles.</b> We compared outcomes between term infants defined macrosomic by birthweight > 4000 g (Macro 4000) or LGA by population <b>centiles</b> (LGApop) with those defined LGA by customised <b>centiles</b> (LGAcust). Methods: This is a prospective cohort study of 2668 term nulliparous women recruited into the Screening for Pregnancy Endpoints (SCOPE) study centres in Auckland, New Zealand and Adelaide, Australia. Maternal (caesarean delivery, postpartum haemorrhage) and infant (severe neonatal morbidity/mortality and admission to neonatal intensive care) outcomes in Macro 4000 and LGA groups were compared with appropriate-for-gestationalage infants by customised <b>centiles</b> using logistic regression. Results: Customised <b>centiles</b> defined fewer infants as LGA (10. 3 % LGAcust, 14. 8 % Macro 4000, 11. 2 % LGApop). However customised <b>centiles</b> showed stronger association with adverse outcomes. Pre-labour and intrapartum caesarean section were increased twofold in LGAcust pregnancies, including those that were not Macro 4000 or LGApop. Postpartum haemorrhage was increased twofold in mothers of LGAcust infants only when infants were also LGApop. Severe neonatal morbidity/mortality or admission to neonatal intensive care was increased twofold in LGAcust who were also either Macro 4000 or LGApop. Importantly 52. 3 % of Macro 4000 and 25. 5 % of LGApop infants were AGAcust and not at increased risk of most adverse maternal or neonatal outcomes. Conclusions: The use of customised <b>centiles</b> are more strongly associated with adverse birth outcomes and its use {{should be considered in}} the definition of LGA.

50|$|The {{diagnosis}} of Perlman syndrome {{is based on}} observed phenotypic features and confirmed by histological examination of the kidneys.

Fetal overgrowth, particularly with an occipitofrontal circumference (OFC) greater than the 90th <b>centile</b> for gestational age, as well as an excess of amniotic fluid in the amniotic sac (polyhydramnios), may be the first signs of Perlman. Using ultrasound diagnosis, Perlman syndrome has been detected at 18 weeks. During the first trimester, the common abnormalities of the syndrome observed by ultrasound include cystic hygroma and a thickened nuchal lucency. Common findings for the second and third trimesters include macrosomia, enlarged kidneys, renal tumors (both hamartoma and Wilms), cardiac abnormalities and visceromegaly.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{adiposity}} rebound is {{the second}} rise in body mass index that occurs {{between 3 and 7}} years. An early age at adiposity rebound is known to be a risk factor for later obesity. The aim here is to clarify the connection between the age at rebound and the corresponding pattern of body mass index change, in <b>centile</b> terms, so as to better understand its ability to predict later fatness. Discussion Longitudinal changes in body mass index during adiposity rebound, measured both in original (kg/m 2) and standard deviation (SD) score units, are studied in five hypothetical subjects. Two aspects of the body mass index curve, the body mass index <b>centile</b> and the rate of body mass index <b>centile</b> crossing, determine a child's age at rebound. A high <b>centile</b> and upward <b>centile</b> crossing are both associated separately with an early rebound, while a low <b>centile</b> and/or downward <b>centile</b> crossing correspond to a late rebound. Early adiposity rebound is a risk factor for later fatness because it identifies children whose body mass index <b>centile</b> is high and/or crossing upwards. Such children are likely to have a raised body mass index later in childhood and adulthood. This is an example of Peto's "horse racing effect". The association of <b>centile</b> crossing with later obesity is statistical not physiological, and it applies at all ages not just at rebound, so adiposity rebound cannot be considered a critical period for future obesity. Body mass index <b>centile</b> crossing is a more direct indicator of the underlying drive to fatness. Summary An early age at adiposity rebound predicts later fatness because it identifies children whose body mass index <b>centile</b> is high and/or crossing upwards. Such children are likely to have a raised body mass index later. Body mass index <b>centile</b> crossing is more direct than the timing of adiposity rebound for predicting later fatness. </p...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Fetal growth {{restriction}} (FGR) has {{a strong}} negative influence on pregnancy outcome, and identifying this is of great importance in antenatal care. Serial measurement of fundal height is widely used as a screening tool to detect FGR pregnancies, despite lacking evidence of effectiveness in preventing perinatal deaths. One potential avenue of screening is customized growth <b>centiles,</b> adjusted for constitutional factors known to influence birth weight, and thus potentially improving the separation between the constitutionally small vs. the pathologically small baby. The aim of this literature review was to identify the current evidence for the {{development and use of}} such customized <b>centiles</b> for screening purposes. Methods: Literature searches were conducted through PubMed, EMBASE, Medline and the Cochrane Databases in English literature after 1990. First, we searched for papers on what potentially constitutional factors affect birth weight. Second, what models had previously been developed for customized <b>centiles.</b> We then explored in depth the characteristics of potentially constitutional factors identified. Finally we searched for evidence of effectiveness screening with customized <b>centiles</b> to prevent adverse pregnancy outcomes. Results and discussion: On the basis of articles found, we have isolated eleven factors being subject of a thorough analysis {{to decide whether or not}} to include them in future customized <b>centiles.</b> The factors are: Fetal sex, gestational age, mother and father’s height & weight, parent’s/siblings’ birth weight, parity, maternal age, maternal weight gain during pregnancy, smoking and ethnicity. Conclusion: The following factors should be included in the development of customized birth weight and fetal growth centiles: Fetal sex, gestational age, maternal height and weight, the latter two after excluding the pathology of the extremes. Further, we have found that the effectiveness of customized <b>centiles</b> is promising, however still uncertain and randomized controlled trials are needed to assess their true evidence...|$|R

Methods:The data relate to a multi-stage random sample of healthy school children in Shiraz, southern Iran, collected in 2002 - 2003 academic year. The mean�SD age of these children was 9. 1 � 1. 4 yaers. The weight and height were estimated as 28. 2 � 6. 9 kg and 131. 3 � 9. 6 cm, respectively. Cross-sectional weight-for-height curves were constructed for both sexes. Parametric Lambda-Median-Standard Deviation (LMS) method was applied to estimate weight-for-height <b>centiles.</b> Findings:Weight-for-height <b>centiles</b> for boys and girls were nearly close to each other, except for the children of older age in which boys' <b>centiles</b> lay below those of girls. <b>Centiles</b> of the present study lay above previous ones. In both sexes CDC weights were greater than those of Iranians for a given height. This discrepancy was more pronounced in extreme high <b>centiles.</b> Conclusion:The necessity for updating local weight-for-height reference data for clinical work in Iran is emphasized.

Birth weight percentiles were corrected for gestational age at delivery, parity, and gender. Macrosomia was defined as birth weight ≥ 95 th <b>centile.</b> We included 6503 fetuses. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that birth weight <b>centile</b> was positively correlated with NT multiples of the median (MoM), PAPP-A MoM, and maternal body mass index, and it was negatively correlated with smoking. An NT ≥ 95 th <b>centile</b> was present in 315 fetuses (4. 8 %). Although median birth weight <b>centile</b> was not significantly different between cases with NT ≥ 95 th <b>centile</b> and those 95 th <b>centile</b> was more common (11 % vs 7 %) in the presence of NT ≥ 95 th <b>centile.</b> Pregnancy associated plasma protein was elevated (≥ 95 th <b>centile)</b> in 303 cases (7. 9 %). Median birth weight was higher (P 56 vs P 51, P[*]=[*] 0. 03) in case of elevated PAPP-A compared with PAPP-A < 95 th <b>centile.</b> There was a trend toward higher macrosomia rate in case of PAPP-A ≥ 95 th <b>centile</b> (7. 4 % vs 6. 3 %, P[*]=[*] 0. 07).

These children were followed for up to 8 years, during which time there were only two clinical episodes which might be ascribed to Hartnup disease. The mental development of all the children was normal. 10 had height <b>centiles</b> less than the midparent height <b>centiles,</b> while 4 had <b>centiles</b> equal to or above the midparent <b>centiles.</b> The study shows that in children with Hartnup disease in Australia symptoms are very uncommon. Mental development is normal, and heights are possibly slightly below that expected. Hartnup disease has an incidence of approximately 1 in 33 000 in New South Wales. Hartnup disease is a disorder of renal tubular and intestinal transport of amino acids, with reported clinical association with pellagra-like rash and ataxia.
