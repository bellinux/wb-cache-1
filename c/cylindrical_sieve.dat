Processing of African locust bean seed starts with the pretreatment of the harvested fruit before the seed can be converted into its numerous derivatives. Depulpping of locust bean seed is a crucial pretreatment operation, preceding fermentation of the seed. This operation is tedious, time consuming and energy sapping for women and children that are involved in the processing of locust bean. Small Scale equipment for depulpping of African locust bean seed was designed, constructed and tested. Techno-economic status {{of the women in the}} rural areas who are directly involved in the processing of locust bean and its derivatives was taken into consideration. The depulpping machine comprises of a vertical cylindrical tank, <b>cylindrical</b> <b>sieve</b> and a vertical rotating shaft which carries both the paddles and brushes. The vertica...|$|E
40|$|Microalgae are {{potential}} resources for producing renewable fuel; however, {{the process of}} fuel production from microalgae is itself highly energy consuming and not commercially feasible, yet. Repetitive non-destructive extraction, also called repetitive milking, is a novel method for production of hydrocarbons from Botryococcus braunii â€“ a species of microalgae. In this study, superstructure optimization technique is used to analyse the energetic feasibility of the repetitive milking process and to find the suitable technology options for each stage involved. The repetitive milking process {{is found to be}} energetically positive with an average net energy ratio of two for the optimum route. Open pond, <b>cylindrical</b> <b>sieve</b> rotator filter and nanofiltration were found to be the optimum technologies for growth and hydrocarbon production, dewatering and solvent recovery stages, respectively. Belt filter press and vibratory screen filter for dewatering and distillation for solvent recovery are also found to be energetically feasible technologies...|$|E

The depulpping machine comprises of a vertical cylindrical tank, <b>cylindrical</b> <b>sieve</b> and a vertical rotating shaft which carries both the paddles and brushes. The vertical shaft was mounted at the central axis of the depulpping unit. The machine has a capacity to depulp 10 kg of locust bean seed during a unit batch operation. Five levels of soaking time corresponding to five levels of locust bean moisture contents and five levels of shaft speeds were tested. Test results indicated that the depulpping efficiency varied between 64 and 98 %. The seed membrane damage and seed loss were less than 5 and 9. 2 % respectively at 45 minutes soaking time and at 350 rpm depulpping shaft speed. The maximum power requirement was 2. 25 kW at a shaft speed of 550 rpm. The operating conditions of shaft speed at 350 rpm, 45 minutes soaking time indicated higher depulpping efficiency, lower seed membrane damage and seed loss during depulpping operation. Result of process performance showed that the final depulpping process compared favourantly with that of traditional method...|$|E
