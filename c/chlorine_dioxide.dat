5|$|Chlorine {{perchlorate}} (ClOClO3) is a {{pale yellow}} liquid {{that is less}} stable than ClO2 and decomposes at room temperature to form chlorine, oxygen, and dichlorine hexoxide (Cl2O6). Chlorine perchlorate may also be considered a chlorine derivative of perchloric acid (HOClO3), similar to the thermally unstable chlorine derivatives of other oxoacids: examples include chlorine nitrate (ClONO2, vigorously reactive and explosive), and chlorine fluorosulfate (ClOSO2F, more stable but still moisture-sensitive and highly reactive). Dichlorine hexoxide is a dark-red liquid that freezes to form a solid which turns yellow at −180°C: it is usually made by reaction of <b>chlorine</b> <b>dioxide</b> with oxygen. Despite attempts to rationalise it as the dimer of ClO3, it reacts more {{as though it were}} chloryl perchlorate, +−, which has been confirmed to be the correct structure of the solid. It hydrolyses in water to give a mixture of chloric and perchloric acids: the analogous reaction with anhydrous hydrogen fluoride does not proceed to completion.|$|E
25|$|<b>Chlorine</b> <b>dioxide</b> is {{sometimes}} used for bleaching of wood pulp {{in combination with}} chlorine, but it is used alone in ECF (elemental chlorine-free) bleaching sequences. It is used at moderately acidic pH (3.5 to 6). The use of <b>chlorine</b> <b>dioxide</b> minimizes the amount of organochlorine compounds produced. <b>Chlorine</b> <b>dioxide</b> (ECF technology) currently {{is the most important}} bleaching method worldwide. About 95% of all bleached kraft pulp is made using <b>chlorine</b> <b>dioxide</b> in ECF bleaching sequences.|$|E
25|$|All three sodium {{chlorite}} chemistries can produce <b>chlorine</b> <b>dioxide</b> with high chlorite conversion yield, {{but unlike the}} other processes the chlorite-sulfuric acid method produces completely chlorine-free <b>chlorine</b> <b>dioxide,</b> although it suffers from the requirement of 25% more chlorite to produce an equivalent amount of <b>chlorine</b> <b>dioxide.</b> Alternatively, hydrogen peroxide may be efficiently used in small-scale applications.|$|E
50|$|The sulfochlorination first {{described}} by Cortes F. Reed in 1936 proceeds under almost identical conditions as the conventional photochlorination. 48 In addition to <b>chlorine,</b> sulfur <b>dioxide</b> is also {{introduced into the}} reaction mixture. The products formed are alkylsulfonyl chlorides, which are further processed into surfactants.|$|R
50|$|The {{irritant}} gases are sulfur dioxide, ammonia, nitrogen <b>dioxide,</b> <b>chlorine,</b> phosgene, and fluorine and its compounds, {{which include}} luroine and hydrofluoric acid, fluorspar, fluorapatite, cryolite, and organic fluorine compounds.|$|R
50|$|Disposal of {{the gases}} {{can be done}} by burning the {{flammable}} ones (carbon monoxide, hydrogen, hydrocarbons), absorbing them in water (ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, sulfur <b>dioxide,</b> <b>chlorine),</b> or reacting them with a suitable reagent.|$|R
25|$|<b>Chlorine</b> <b>dioxide</b> is a faster-acting {{disinfectant}} than elemental chlorine. It {{is relatively}} rarely used, because {{in some circumstances}} it may create excessive amounts of chlorite, which is a by-product regulated to low allowable levels in the United States. <b>Chlorine</b> <b>dioxide</b> can be supplied as an aqueous solution and added to water to avoid gas handling problems; <b>chlorine</b> <b>dioxide</b> gas accumulations may spontaneously detonate.|$|E
25|$|<b>Chlorine</b> <b>dioxide</b> is toxic, hence {{limits on}} {{exposure}} to it {{are needed to}} ensure its safe use. The United States Environmental Protection Agency has set a maximum level of 0.8mg/L for <b>chlorine</b> <b>dioxide</b> in drinking water. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), an agency of the United States Department of Labor, has set an 8-hour permissible exposure limit of 0.1 ppm in air (0.3 mg/m3) for people working with <b>chlorine</b> <b>dioxide.</b>|$|E

25|$|Alkanes {{will react}} with steam in the {{presence}} of a nickel catalyst to give hydrogen. Alkanes can be chlorosulfonated and nitrated, although both reactions require special conditions. The fermentation of alkanes to carboxylic acids is of some technical importance. In the Reed reaction, sulfur <b>dioxide,</b> <b>chlorine</b> and light convert hydrocarbons to sulfonyl chlorides. Nucleophilic Abstraction can be used to separate an alkane from a metal. Alkyl groups can be transferred from one compound to another by transmetalation reactions.|$|R

25|$|Acute {{inhalation}} injury {{may result}} from frequent and widespread use of household cleaning agents and industrial gases (including chlorine and ammonia). The airways and lungs receive continuous first-pass exposure to non-toxic and irritant or toxic gases via inhalation. Irritant gases are those that, on inhalation, dissolve in {{the water of the}} respiratory tract mucosa and provoke an inflammatory response, usually from the release of acidic or alkaline radicals. Smoke, <b>chlorine,</b> phosgene, sulfur <b>dioxide,</b> hydrogen chloride, hydrogen sulfide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and ammonia are common irritants.|$|R

25|$|It is {{also used}} in {{processing}} aluminium, beryllium, copper, steel and vanadium. In the pulp and paper industry, salt is used to bleach wood pulp. It also is used to make sodium chlorate, which is added along with sulfuric acid and water to manufacture <b>chlorine</b> <b>dioxide,</b> an excellent oxygen-based bleaching chemical. The <b>chlorine</b> <b>dioxide</b> process, which originated in Germany after World War I, is becoming more popular because of environmental pressures to reduce or eliminate chlorinated bleaching compounds. In tanning and leather treatment, salt is added to animal hides to inhibit microbial activity {{on the underside of}} the hides and to attract moisture back into the hides.|$|E

40|$|AbstractNanostructured ZnSnO 3 {{thin films}} were {{prepared}} onto preheated glass substrate by a spray pyrolysis technique using water soluble Zinc chloride and Stannic chloride as precursors. The crystallinity of the prepared samples was analyzed by X-ray diffraction spectroscopy. The X-ray diffractogram of as prepared thin film clearly indicated the stichiometric and pervoskite nanostructured nature of ZnSnO 3. The TEM image shows few nanorods along with fine particles of pervoskite ZnSnO 3. The band gap energy of thin film sample was observed to be 4. 13 eV.

25|$|<b>Chlorine</b> <b>dioxide</b> is a {{compound}} that can decompose extremely violently when separated from diluting substances. As a result, preparation methods that involve producing solutions of it {{without going through}} a gas-phase stage are often preferred. Arranging handling in a safe manner is essential.|$|E
25|$|Ozone {{is used as}} an {{alternative}} to chlorine or <b>chlorine</b> <b>dioxide</b> in the bleaching of wood pulp. It is often used in conjunction with oxygen and hydrogen peroxide to eliminate the need for chlorine-containing compounds in the manufacture of high-quality, white paper.|$|E
25|$|<b>Chlorine</b> <b>dioxide</b> is {{superior}} to some other secondary water disinfection methods in that chlorine dioxide: 1) is an EPA registered biocide, 2) is not negatively impacted by pH, 3) does not lose efficacy over time (the bacteria will not grow resistant to it) and 4) is not negatively impacted by silica and phosphate, which are commonly used potable water corrosion inhibitors.|$|E
5000|$|Carbon dioxide, hydrogen, nitrous oxide, oxygen, ammonia, <b>chlorine,</b> sulfur <b>dioxide</b> and {{manufactured}} fuel gas were already being {{used during the}} 19th century, and mainly had uses in food, refrigeration, medicine, and for fuel and gas lighting. For example, carbonated water was being made from 1772 and commercially from 1783, chlorine was first used to bleach textiles in 1785 [...] and nitrous oxide was first used for dentistry anaethesia in 1844. At this time gases were often generated for immediate use by chemical reactions. A notable example of a generator is Kipps apparatus which was invented in 1844 [...] and {{could be used to}} generate gases such as hydrogen, hydrogen sulfide, chlorine, acetylene and carbon dioxide by simple gas evolution reactions. Acetylene was manufactured commercially from 1893 and acetylene generators were used from about 1898 to produce gas for gas cooking and gas lighting, however electricity took over as more practical for lighting and once LPG was produced commercially from 1912, the use of acetylene for cooking declined.|$|R
25|$|Respiratory {{damage is}} related to the {{concentration}} of the gas and its solubility. Irritant gas exposures predominantly affect the airways, causing tracheitis, bronchitis, and bronchiolitis. Other inhaled agents may be directly toxic (e.g. cyanide, carbon monoxide), or cause harm simply by displacing oxygen and producing asphyxia (e.g. methane, carbon dioxide). The effect of inhaling irritant gases depends on the extent and duration of exposure and on the specific agent <b>Chlorine,</b> phosgene, sulfur <b>dioxide,</b> hydrogen chloride, hydrogen sulfide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and ammonia are among the most important irritant gases. Hydrogen sulfide is also a potent cellular toxin, blocking the cytochrome system and inhibiting cellular respiration. More water-soluble gases (e.g. <b>chlorine,</b> ammonia, sulfur <b>dioxide,</b> hydrogen chloride) dissolve in the upper airway and immediately cause mucous membrane irritation, which may alert people to the need to escape the exposure. Permanent damage to the upper respiratory tract, distal airways, and lung parenchyma occurs only if escape from the gas source is impeded. Less soluble gases (e.g. nitrogen dioxide, phosgene, ozone) may not dissolve until they are well into the respiratory tract, often reaching the lower airways. These agents are less likely to produce early warning signs (phosgene in low concentrations has a pleasant odor), are more likely to cause severe bronchiolitis, and often have a lag of ≥ 12 h before symptoms of pulmonary edema develop.|$|R
50|$|Water {{has limited}} {{solubility}} in silicate melts ranging from essentially zero at surface pressure {{to up to}} as much as 10% at 1100 °C and 5 kbar of pressure for a granitic melt. Solubility is lower for more mafic magmas. As the temperature and pressure drop during emplacement and cooling of the magma a separate aqueous phase will exsolve. This aqueous phase will be enriched in other volatile and silicate incompatible species such as the metals: copper, lead, zinc, silver and gold; alkalis and alkaline earths and others, including: lithium, beryllium, boron, rubidium; and volatiles: fluorine, <b>chlorine</b> and carbon <b>dioxide.</b>|$|R

25|$|While Cryptosporidium {{is highly}} {{resistant}} to chlorine disinfection, with high enough concentrations and contact time, Cryptosporidium will be inactivated by <b>chlorine</b> <b>dioxide</b> and ozone treatment. The required levels of chlorine generally preclude {{the use of}} chlorine disinfection as a reliable method to control Cryptosporidium in drinking water.

25|$|Very few {{compounds}} of main group {{elements are}} paramagnetic. Notable examples include: oxygen, O2; nitric oxide, NO; nitrogen dioxide, NO2 and <b>chlorine</b> <b>dioxide,</b> ClO2. In organic chemistry, compounds with an unpaired electron {{are said to}} be free radicals. Free radicals, with some exceptions, are short-lived because one free radical will react rapidly with another, so their magnetic properties are difficult to study. However, if the radicals are well separated from each other in a dilute solution in a solid matrix, at low temperature, they can be studied by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). Such radicals are generated by irradiation. Extensive EPR studies have revealed much about electron delocalization in free radicals. The simulated spectrum of the CH3• radical shows hyperfine splitting due to the interaction of the electron with the 3 equivalent hydrogen nuclei, each of which has a spin of 1/2.|$|E

5000|$|Radon is {{a member}} of the zero-valence {{elements}} that are called noble gases. It is inert to most common chemical reactions, such as combustion, because the outer valence shell contains eight electrons. This produces a stable, minimum energy configuration in which the outer electrons are tightly bound. 1037 kJ/mol is required to extract one electron from its shells (also known as the first ionization energy). In accordance with periodic trends, radon has a lower electronegativity than the element one period before it, xenon, and is therefore more reactive.
