30|$|Geometrical {{parameters}} of the <b>chamfer</b> <b>tool</b> influence the machined surface quality directly. Xiong et al. [3] analysed the influence of point appearance of cemented carbide cutting tools on quality of the machined surface. To improve the surface quality, the wiper technique was employed in super long rod processing by Lai et al. [4]. Wang et al. [5] analysed the effects of rake angle and flank angle of the tool on machined surface roughness of potassium dihydrogen phosphate crystal in diamond turning. Jiang et al. [6] introduced that the comparison test of surface quality and tool wear was carried out using three polycrystalline diamond (PCD) tools with different grinding surface quality, and flank surface quality of PCD cutting tool has a big influence on machined surface quality, but has less effects on cutting tool’s life. The effect of the tool flank wear (VB) on the surface roughness and cutting force was studied by Wu et al. [7], and the mechanism of production was discussed. Dong et al. [8] reported that the machined surface quality can be improved by using a designed diamond tool sharpness.|$|E

40|$|The chamfer {{enhances the}} {{performance}} of the tool by strengthening the edge and reducing the possibility of tool wear and breakage. The strength of the <b>chamfered</b> <b>tool</b> can be investigated by analysis of process variables. This research investigates the effects of chamfer width and chamfer angle on process variables (force, stress, tool temperature and tool stress) in machining of a mild carbon low alloy steel by a cemented carbide tool using finite element method. The simulations show that the dead metal zone created under the tool acts as the effective cutting edge of the tool and increases the cutting forces. The predicted results show that the effect of chamfer width and angle is more pronounced on the thrust force than the cutting force. It also investigates the effect of chamfer on the effective shear angle and chip thickness, and comparison with available experimental results is presented. Tool temperatures are also predicted which suggests the presence of an optimum chamfer angle from the viewpoint of maximum tool temperature...|$|R
40|$|Machining is {{the most}} widely used and {{efficient}} material removal process, and tool wear in machining is usually of great interest in order to improve machining efficiency and effectiveness. Cutting tool wear patterns such as the flank and crater wear and the dead metal zone (DMZ) may induce the cutting tool geometry variation in machining. As a result, cutting forces may increase or decrease due to the change of tool effective cutting geometry during machining operations. A quantitative understanding of and the ability to predict cutting forces in relation to tool wear are important to the tool life estimation, chatter prediction, and tool condition monitoring. Most available force models are limited to fresh tool conditions or worn tool conditions only considering the flank wear. Furthermore, the effect of DMZ on cutting forces, especially when a <b>chamfered</b> <b>tool</b> is used, is frequently ignored. The objective of this dissertation is to analytically model the combined effect of the crater and flank wear as well as the effect of DMZ on cutting forces in 2 D and 3 D turning.

30|$|The {{surface quality}} of chamfer milling of {{stainless}} steel is closed related to the products of 3 C (Computer, Communication and Consumer electronics), where a cutter is a major part to achieve that. Targeting a high-quality cutter, an experimental evaluation is carried out {{on the influence of}} grinding texture of cutter flank face on surface quality. The mathematic models of chamfer cutter are established, and they are validated by a numerical simulation. Also the grinding data are generated by the models and tested by a grinding simulation for safety reasons. Then, a set of <b>chamfer</b> cutting <b>tools</b> are machined in a five-axis CNC grinding machine, and consist of five angles between the cutting edge and the grinding texture on the 1 st flank faces, i.e., 0 °, 15 °, 30 °, 45 ° and 60 °. Furthermore, the machined cutting tools are tested in a series of milling experiments of chamfer hole {{of stainless steel}}, where cutting forces and surface morphologies are measured and observed. The results show that the best state of both surface quality and cutting force is archived by the tool with 45 ° grinding texture, which can provide a support for manufacturing of cutting <b>tool</b> used in <b>chamfer</b> milling.|$|R
