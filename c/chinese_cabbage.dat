5|$|Cabbage is {{prepared}} and consumed in many ways. The simplest options include eating the vegetable raw or steaming it, though many cuisines pickle, stew, sautée or braise cabbage. Pickling {{is one of}} the most popular ways of preserving cabbage, creating dishes such as sauerkraut and kimchi, although kimchi is more often made from <b>Chinese</b> <b>cabbage</b> (B.rapa). Savoy cabbages are usually used in salads, while smooth-leaf types are utilized for both market sales and processing. Bean curd and cabbage is a staple of Chinese cooking, while the British dish bubble and squeak is made primarily with leftover potato and boiled cabbage and eaten with cold meat. In Poland, cabbage {{is one of the}} main food crops, and it features prominently in Polish cuisine. It is frequently eaten, either cooked or as sauerkraut, as a side dish or as an ingredient in such dishes as bigos (cabbage, sauerkraut, meat, and wild mushrooms, among other ingredients) gołąbki (stuffed cabbage) and pierogi (filled dumplings). Other eastern European countries, such as Hungary and Romania, also have traditional dishes that feature cabbage as a main ingredient. In India and Ethiopia, cabbage is often included in spicy salads and braises. In the United States, cabbage is used primarily for the production of coleslaw, followed by market use and sauerkraut production.|$|E

In the present work, a WRKY TF, termed BrWRKY 75 was isolated from <b>Chinese</b> flowering <b>cabbage</b> [Brassica rapa L. ssp. chinensis (L.) Mokino var. utilis Tsen et Lee]. Analysis of deduced amino acid sequence and the phylogenetic tree showed that BrWRKY 75 has high homology with WRKY 75 from Brassica oleracea and Arabidopsis thaliana, and belongs to the II c sub-group. Sub-cellular localization and transcriptional activity analysis revealed that BrWRKY 75 is a nuclear protein with transcriptional repression activity, and was up-regulated during leaf senescence.

40|$|Plant-specific WRKY {{transcription}} factors (TFs) {{have been}} implicated {{to function as}} regulators of leaf senescence, but their association with postharvest leaf senescence of economically important leafy vegetables, is poorly understood. In this work, the characterization of a Group IIe WRKY TF, BrWRKY 65, from <b>Chinese</b> flowering <b>cabbage</b> (Brassica rapa var. parachinensis) is reported. The expression of BrWRKY 65 was up-regulated following leaf chlorophyll degradation and yellowing during postharvest senescence. Subcellular localization and transcriptional activation assays showed that BrWRKY 65 was localized in the nucleus and exhibited trans-activation ability. Further electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and transient expression analysis clearly revealed that BrWRKY 65 directly bound to the W-box motifs in the promoters of three senescence-associated genes (SAGs) such as BrNYC 1 and BrSGR 1 associated with chlorophyll degradation, and BrDIN 1, and subsequently activated their expressions. These findings demonstrate that BrWRKY 65 may be positively associated with postharvest leaf senescence, at least partially, by the direct activation of SAGs.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{estimate}} the economic effect of the large scale irrigation project that had being constructed in upland farming area in Northern Sakai district of Fukui Prefecture for 1971 - 1982. The results are as follows; 1) The water irrigation turned out the waste land to arable upland in the area, and that led the individual farmer larger in terms of land owner. However, most of those irrigated lands of small part-time farmers were actually leased to the other farmers who operate dairy and tobacco farming, and expanded the farm size of those farmers. 2) This irrigation project costed large investment for the construction due to unfavourable site of the facilities and unexpected inflation occured in the rapid economic growth, that became the cause of higher charges for the use of irrigated water. 3) The demand of the medium scale farmers engaged in vegetables or in rice-and-vegetables production is large for irrigated water in order to provide it to radishes and <b>Chinese</b> <b>cabbages</b> in the open fields, and to melons and water melons in both the open fields and vinyl covered houses. But the demand is less in the large scale farmers who specialized in dairy and tobacco, and in the other small scale part-time farms. So that the total amount of irrigated water used in the district is far less than the amount planned initially. 4) The higher charges for the irrigated water spending by the farmers lift up the level of the rent of the land, that is the cause of obstacle to lease the land among farmers. 5) To develop the irrigated upland farming in this area for long term, it is necessary to realize the technological innovation appropriated to each type of farming by using irrigation water; i. e. (a) Yield-increasing technology for dairy or tobacco farms to foster the irrigated field enable to bear the higher rent. (b) Labour-saving technology for vegetables or vegetables-and-rice farms to enlarge their farm size. (c) Group-farming technology for small and medium farms to realize the advantage of scale eco本稿では, 後進の畑地かんがい事業が, 受益地域における農業経営の展開に与える影響を明らかにするために, 福井県坂井北部丘陵地域を事例として取り上げ, とくに畑地造成とかんがい用水供給に対応した農業経営の動きを分析した. これまでの分析結果は, 要約すると下記の如くである. 1) 大規模かんがいによる畑の造成は, 多数の農家の所有耕地を増加したが, その利用権は, 流動化推進によって安い借地料で少数の酪農, タバコ作経営に集積され, これらの経営耕地規模を著しく拡大した. 2) しかし畑地かんがい事業は, その後進性と劣悪な立地のために, 先進畑地かんがい地域よりもはるかに多額の投資を伴い, 用水費用の負担を高めている. 3) 農業経営の畑地かんがい用水使用は, そ菜作付率の増加によって促進され, 2 種兼化によって阻害される傾向があり, 前者の効果は, 後者の効果よりもはるかに大きい. したがって用水使用志向は, 経営耕地規模階層間, 経営組織間で違いがあり, 中規模層の野菜作, 及び稲作経営では用水使用農家が比較的多いが, 大規模層の酪農, タバコ作経営, 及び小規模層の 2 種兼稲作経営では極めて少ない. そのために用水の使用水量は, 計画量を大きく下回っている. 4) 受益畑における多額の用水費用負担は, 借地料水準を引き上げ, その流動化を阻害する作用を果たす. したがって受益畑は, 用水効果が不変にとどまる限り, 小規模 2 種兼農家に滞留し, 投資額に見合った収益を実現できないままに, 非効率的利用を続ける可能性が大きい. 5) 用水地域の農業を長期的に発展させるためには, 経営条件に適合した技術革新の遂行が不可欠である. すなわち大規模層の酪農, タバコ作経営は, 地代形成力を高める...|$|R
