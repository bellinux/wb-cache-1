40|$|Abstract. Chlamydia psittaci is a {{major cause}} <b>of</b> ovine <b>abortion</b> in the fourth to fifth months of gestation. During the lambing seasons of 1986, 1987, and 1988, fetuses from 52 cases <b>of</b> ovine <b>abortion,</b> stillbirth, or {{perinatal}} death were submitted to the laboratory for necropsy examination. Placenta or fetal tissues from 34 cases were cultured on mouse L cells for C. psittaci. Chlamydia psittaci was identified by immunofluorescence on cultures in 20 of these cases. The major gross lesion consistently associated with <b>Chlamydial</b> <b>abortion</b> was placentitis with multifocal cotyledonary necrosis and accumulation of red-brown exudate in the intercotyledonary placenta Chlamydiae appeared as spherical organisms, less than 1 µm in diameter, in the cytoplasm of tropho-blasts in impression smears of cotyledons. H istologically, placentitis was sometimes accompanied by pneumonia or encephalitis in the fetus. Chlamydia psittaci was considered the cause for fetal death when Chlamydial isolation was associated with placentitis or inflammation of other fetal tissues and when other abortifacient agents were not detected.

40|$|The {{immunobiology}} <b>of</b> enzootic <b>abortion</b> <b>of</b> <b>ewes</b> (EAE) is incompletely understood. The causative {{agent is}} Chlamydia psittaci, which infects many ruminant species and has zoonotic potential. The organism can {{survive in the}} ovine host for many months without causing clinical symptoms but does not generate a sterile immunity during this time. It has been postulated that the organism persists in the host entering at a latent phase, possibly mediated by host cytokine production. The effects of cytokines on chlamydial multiplication vary between host species, between different cell types within those species and also vary between chlamydial species and strains. The multiplication of the EAE strain of C. psittaci in ovine ST- 6 cells can be restricted by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) but not with comparable concentrations of IFN-alpha. Altering the nutrient composition of the cultures by addition of tryptophan partially reverses the antichlamydial effects of the IFN-gamma. This offers a potential mechanism by which C. psittaci can persist in sheep. The implications of these observations for the pathogenesis of EAE are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Chlamydophila abortus {{is one of}} {{the major}} causes <b>of</b> {{infectious}} <b>abortion</b> in pregnant sheep (enzootic <b>abortion</b> <b>of</b> <b>ewes</b> or EAE) worldwide. Organisms shed in infected placentas and uterine discharges at lambing time are the main sources of environmental contamination, responsible for transmission to susceptible animals and possible human contacts. In the present study, a recently developed test, based on a recombinant fragment of the polymorphic outer membrane protein POMP 90 (rOMP 90 - 4 indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [iELISA]) and one based on the variable segment 2 (VS 2) region of the major outer membrane protein (MOMP) (MOMP VS 2 iELISA) were compared using sera from C. abortus-infected ewes at different stages throughout pregnancy. The rOMP 90 iELISA detected antibody much earlier in pregnancy than the MOMP iELISA, which, like the complement fixation test, detected antibody only at the time <b>of</b> <b>abortion</b> or lambing. No anti-MOMP antibody response could be detected in three of seven experimentally infected ewes. Furthermore, the rOMP 90 iELISA detected antibody in an animal that seroconverted during the course of the study, which the MOMP iELISA failed to detect. Overall, the results show that the rOMP 90 - 4 iELISA is considerably more sensitive than the MOMP VS 2 iELISA for identifying animals infected with C. abortus.

This discharge lasted for up to 7 - 8 days after lambing. Ewes were clinically normal with rectal temperatures between 39. 1 C adn 39. 6 C. White to brownish, watery discharge with a foetid smell was designated Type 2. Affected ewes had rectal temperatures of 39. 9 C ti 41. 5 C. The most severe discharge (Type 3) was yellow/white with large lumps of pus and affected ewes were inappetant, visibly depressed with rectal temperatures in excess of 41. 5 C.

Knowledge of the physiological background of pregnancy in ewes: changes, mechanisms and interactions, during pregnancy {{is important for the}} overall health management <b>of</b> <b>ewes</b> during pregnancy. Health management <b>of</b> pregnant <b>ewes</b> includes diagnosis <b>of</b> pregnancy and evaluation of the number of foetuses borne, which will support strategies for subsequent management of the flock. Nutritional management <b>of</b> <b>ewes</b> depends upon the stage of lactation and specifically aims to (i) prevention of pregnancy toxaemia and other metabolic diseases during the peri-partum period, (ii) formation of colostrum in appropriate quantity and quality, (iii) production of lambs with normal future birth bodyweight and (iv) support of increased milk yield during the subsequent lactation. At the end of lactation, udder management <b>of</b> pregnant <b>ewes</b> includes its clinical examination, culling <b>of</b> <b>ewes</b> considered unsuitable for lactation and, possibly, the intramammary administration of antibiotics; {{objectives of}} that procedure are (i) to cure infections which have occurred during the previous lactation and (ii) to prevent development of new mammary infection during the dry period. Management <b>of</b> <b>abortions</b> includes the correct and timely diagnosis of the causative agent of the disorder, as well as the strategic administrations of chemotherapeutic agents, aiming to prevent abortions in flocks with confirmed infection with an abortifacient agent, especially if no appropriate vaccinations had been carried out before the mating season. During the final stage of pregnancy, health management <b>of</b> <b>ewes</b> includes administration <b>of</b> appropriate anthelmintic drugs, aiming to eliminate gastrointestinal helminthes (thus, increasing production output <b>of</b> <b>ewes)</b> and preventing the built-up of parasitic burdens in the environment (thus, reducing infection of lambs during their neonatal period). Vaccinations <b>of</b> pregnant <b>ewes</b> aim to protect these animals, as well as their offspring, especially against diseases which are a frequent cause of neonatal mortality (e. g., clostridial infections). Health management also aims to prevent the main metabolic disorders <b>of</b> pregnant <b>ewes</b> (i. e., pregnancy toxaemia and hypocalcaemia), as well as to monitor flocks for development of these disorders. Health management <b>of</b> pregnant <b>ewes</b> is completed with application of husbandry practices {{before the start of the}} lambing season.

The research lasted 4 months respectively, 2 months with ewes during high pregnancy, 2 months with ewes during lactation and on their lambs during suckling period. Ewes ration from control group one was composed from 300 g/day/animal feed mixture without addition of selenium and 150 g/day/animal barley and alfalfa hay that they had ad libitum. Feed mixture from second group <b>of</b> <b>ewes</b> was supplemented with 0. 3 mg/kg organic form of selenium (Sel-Plex®), and feed mixture from third group with the same amount inorganic form of selenium (sodium selenite). Selenium supplementation <b>of</b> <b>ewes</b> feed mixture did not significantly influence on the production traits of their lambs postpartum. Selenium supplementation <b>of</b> <b>ewes</b> and their lambs had influence on a significant (P< 0. 01; P< 0. 05) increase in the concentration of selenium, GSH-Px and SOD in whole blood compared to control group <b>of</b> <b>ewes.</b> Organic selenium supplement had a more significant impact on the increase in concentration of selenium and GSH-Px in the blood. In the ewes and lambs blood was determined decrease of MDA with increasing concentrations of selenium in the blood. Generally, the selenium supplementation led to an increase (P< 0. 05) in the number of WBC and lymphocytes in the blood <b>of</b> <b>ewes</b> and lambs. Also, the increase in the number of RBC, HGB content and MCV in lambs and MCH as well as MCHC in ewes that had a selenium supplement in feed mixture were determined.

Inorganic source of selenium influenced on a significant increase of pO 2 in the blood <b>of</b> <b>ewes</b> and increasing trend in lambs. Strong ion difference (SID) and the z-value in the blood of lambs, average age of 23 days, were significantly decreased with the addition of inorganic selenium in the feed mixture. Inorganic selenium supplement in the feed mixture <b>of</b> pregnant <b>ewes</b> influenced a significant increase in the anion gap. It was determined a slight increase in activity of AST and LDH and a decrease in serum CK <b>of</b> <b>ewes</b> supplemented with selenium, while in the lambs organic and inorganic selenium supplements influenced on a significant decrease of AST, GGT and CK. Selenium supplementation <b>of</b> high pregnant <b>ewes</b> had influence on the growth of the concentration of T 3 and T 4 in the blood. Inorganic selenium supplement in lactating ewes influenced a significant increase in concentration of T 3. In the lambs, average age 23 days, selenium supplement had influence increase of concentrations of T 3 and T 4, while aged 63 days had influence on increase T 3 and decrease T 4.

40|$|This {{work was}} {{undertaken}} {{to study the}} milk yield <b>of</b> Corriedale <b>ewes</b> and the liveweight of lambs produced from those ewes with special reference to {{the relation of the}} milk yield to the growth from birth to weaning of suckling lambs. The animals used were 7 Corriedale <b>ewes</b> <b>of</b> 3 years of age and 9 Iambs (singles 5, twins 4) born from those ewes in the spring, 1957 at the Chugoku Stock Breeding Farm of the Department of Agriculture and Forestry. The milk yield <b>of</b> <b>ewes</b> was estimated from the difference of the liveweight of lambs weighed before and after suckling and the records of the milk yeild <b>of</b> <b>ewes</b> and <b>of</b> the liveweight of lambs were taken at 10 days intervals after birth. The results obtained were as follows : (1) It was found that the milk yield <b>of</b> <b>ewes</b> was highest during the period from 10 to 20 days after lambing and then gradually declined. (2) It seems that the <b>ewes</b> <b>of</b> higher milk yield during the first one month after lambing are greater on the average daily milk production during each 10 days period after lambing and on the total milk production during three months, as compared with those of lower milk yield. (3) Significant correlations were not found between the total milk yield <b>of</b> <b>ewes</b> during three months after lambing and their liveweight on the lambing day and between the former and the liveweight of lambs on the day of lambing. (4) Average total milk yield during three months from birth to weaning was 83. 3 kg and the average daily weight gain per single lamb 240 g. (5) There were a few significant correlations between the milk yield <b>of</b> <b>ewes</b> during each one month period and during three months period and the liveweight gains of lambs after birth and was generally a increasing tendency of the correlation coefficient values, as lambs grew older. It seems that those tendencies need further investigation. (6) However, a significent correlation (r=+ 0. 91) was found between the total milk yield <b>of</b> <b>ewes</b> and the average daily weight gain of lambs during three months period from lambing to weaning. (7) It was found that the correlations between the average daily liveweight gain of lambs during three months period and the liveweight <b>of</b> <b>ewes</b> on the lambing day and between the former and the birth weight of lambs were not significant...|$|R

40|$|Ewe lambs {{have the}} ability to be {{successfully}} bred at 7 - 9 months <b>of</b> age. Breeding <b>ewe</b> lambs has a number of advantages including increased profitability and lifetime reproductive performance. However due to low and variable reproductive performance and the potential for negative effects on future performance, most ewe lambs are not bred. This review compares the differences in reproductive performance between ewe lambs and mature ewes. In addition, it summarises the known effects <b>of</b> <b>ewe</b> lamb breeding on lifetime performance. It also focuses on factors affecting the success <b>of</b> <b>ewe</b> lamb breeding. Lastly, it outlines the optimal management <b>of</b> the <b>ewe</b> lamb to the weaning of her first lamb and to maximise her lifetime performance...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{selenium}} (Se) supplementation <b>of</b> <b>ewes</b> with blood Se concentration ranging between 100 - 200 ng/ml on embryonic survival {{during the early}} post-mating period (days 15 - 35) was studied in 4 trials. In the 1 st 2 trials 137 ewes were used in 1991 and 118 in 1992. After being mated as a single flock, these ewes were stratified randomly into 3 groups. One group served as a control, the 2 nd was injected with 1 ml Deposel (containing 50 mg Se as Ba selenate) and the 3 rd group injected with 1 ml containing 1 mgSe as Na selenite. During 1991, supplementation was administered immediately after the mating period. It was postponed by 14 days in 1992. Parenteral Se supplementation reduced (p 19 % during 1991 but not during 1992. The number <b>of</b> <b>ewes</b> producing twins was unaffected. In trials 3 and 4 there was a consistent indication that parenteral Se supplementation <b>of</b> pregnant <b>ewes</b> between 15 - 35 days after mating resulted in a reduced (22 - 40 %) embryonic survival rate, although significant (p ≤ 0. 10) differences were only observed after the pooling of treatments receiving parenteral Se supplementation. Drenching <b>of</b> <b>ewes</b> with 50 mg Se as Na selenite resulted in a similar tendency. Biochemical appraisal of the blood, kidney and liver Se status <b>of</b> <b>ewes</b> failed to reveal toxic levels. The possible mechanisms involved in impaired embryonic survival are unclear. Supplementation <b>of</b> <b>ewes</b> during the 1 st month of pregnancy with parenteral Se preparations is not recommended. Articl...|$|R
