40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} reactor {{model was}} established for a packed-bed electrochemical reactor with cooled cathode (PERCC) for producing glyoxylic acid from oxalic acid {{based on the}} system's reaction kinetics, mass conservation equation, and the equation of charge conservation in terms of solution-cathode potential to describe the distributions of glyoxylic acid concentration and electrolyte potential in the cathode compartment of the PERCC. The equation for a <b>circulating</b> <b>mixer</b> was also presented {{to account for the}} accumulation of glyoxylic acid in the catholyte of a batch electroreduction process. Using the orthogonal collocation approach, the partial differential equations of the model could be converted into sets of algebraic equations and be numerically solved. The effects of operating temperature, conductivity of catholyte, operating cathode potential, and volumetric flow rate of the catholyte on the current efficiency and concentration of glyoxylic acid were simulated and discussed, with emphasis on the current densities generated from main and side reactions. The model was used in a batch operation process and a continuous operation process, with the predicted results being generally in good agreement with the experimental data for both the cases.

40|$|Abstract. Three {{turbulent}} models, standard k-ε model, realizable k-ε {{model and}} SST k-ω model, are proposed {{to calculate the}} distribution of the flow field in a novel static <b>circulating</b> jet <b>mixer.</b> The results show that the SST k-ω model can depict truly the fluid motion in the novel jet mixer from the velocity vector distribution. The k-ε Standard model overestimates k in the wall and the bulk zones. Comparing the numerical models, the SST k-ω model gives better results than the other k-ε models at the same Reynold number...|$|R
40|$|The study {{consisted}} of reactor design used for transesterification process, effect of glycerol separation on transesterification reaction, determination of biodiesel quality, and mass balance analysis. The reactor was designed by integrating <b>circulated</b> pump/stirrer, static <b>mixer,</b> and sprayer that intensify the reaction in the outer tank reactor. The objective was to reduce the use of methanol in excess and to shorten the processing time. The {{results showed that the}} reactor that applied the glycerol separation was able to compensate for the decreased use of the reactant methanol from 6 : 1 to 5 : 1 molar ratio, and changed the mass balance in the product, including: (i) the increase of biodiesel production from 42. 37 % to 49. 34 %, and (ii) the reduction of methanol in excess from 42. 37 % to 32. 89 %. The results suggested that the efficiency of biodiesel production could be increased with the glycerol separation engineering. </div...|$|R
