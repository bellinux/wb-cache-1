50|$|Rather than {{cutting and}} turning {{the soil to}} produce ridged furrows, the ard breaks up a narrow strip of soil and cuts a shallow furrow (or drill), leaving {{intervening}} strips undisturbed. The ard is not suited for clearing new land, so grass and undergrowth are usually removed with hoes or mattocks. <b>Cross-ploughing</b> is often necessary to break the soil up better, where the soil is tilled twice {{at right angles to}} the original direction (lengthwise and across). This usually results in square or diamond-shaped fields and is effective at clearing annual weeds. The ard's shallow furrows are ideal for most cereals, and if the seed is sown broadcast, the ard can be used to cover the seed in rows. In fact, the ard may have been invented in the Near East to cover seed rather than till. That would explain why in Mesopotamia seed drills were used together with ards. The ard is most useful on light soils such as loams or sands, or in mountain fields where the soil is thin, and can be safely used in areas where deep ploughing would turn up hardpan or would cause salination or erosion.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} was the bow ard, {{which consists}} of a draft-pole (or beam) pierced by a thinner vertical pointed stick called the head (or body), with one end being the stilt (handle) {{and the other a}} share (cutting blade) that was dragged through the topsoil to cut a shallow furrow ideal for most cereal crops. The ard does not clear new land well, so hoes or mattocks must be used to pull up grass and undergrowth, and a hand-held, coulter-like ristle could be used to cut deeper furrows ahead of the share. Because the ard leaves a strip of undisturbed earth between the furrows, the fields are often <b>cross-ploughed</b> lengthwise and widthwise, and this tends to form squarish fields (Celtic fields). The ard is best suited to loamy or sandy soils that are naturally fertilised by annual flooding, as in the Nile Delta and Fertile Crescent, {{and to a lesser extent}} any other cereal-growing region with light or thin soil. By the late Iron Age, ards in Europe were commonly fitted with coulters.|$|R
50|$|Some ancient hoes, {{like the}} Egyptian mr, were pointed and {{strong enough to}} clear rocky soil and make seed drills, {{which is why they}} are called hand-ards. However, the {{domestication}} of oxen in Mesopotamia and the Indus valley civilization, perhaps as early as the 6th millennium BC, provided mankind with the draft power necessary to develop the larger, animal-drawn true ard (or scratch plough). The earliest was the bow ard, which consists of a draft-pole (or beam) pierced by a thinner vertical pointed stick called the head (or body), with one end being the stilt (handle) and the other a share (cutting blade) that was dragged through the topsoil to cut a shallow furrow ideal for most cereal crops.

5000|$|As a {{continuing}} process of thetheatre movement in Manipur, some theatre lovers viz, (1) Sorokhaibam Lalit Singh, (2) Chingakham Mayurdhaja Singh, (3) Hijam Irabot Singh, (4) Khomdram Dhanachandra Singh, (5) Nongmaithem Tombi Singh and (6) Ngangbam Shyamkishore Singh grouped {{together to form}} a theatre organization with the name ‘Yaishkul Nipamacha School Drama Party’. All the members excepting Kh. Dhanachandra were from Yaiskul area. Later the name was changed ‘Meitei Dramatic Union’. In order to encompass more theatre lovers cutting across community line, the name was later changed to ‘Manipur Dramatic Union’ (MDU). The first play to be presented by MDU was ‘Areppa Marup’ on 15 March 1931. It was written and directed by S. Lalit Singh. Its first show was funded by Maharajkumari Tamphasana Devi. This was followed by ‘Sati Khongnang’ (1931) (MK Binodini in her book “Churachand Maharaj gee Emung” wrote that MK Tamphasana wanted to record “Sati Khongnang” play and had even called S. Lalit for discussion in this regard. Unfortunately, Tamphasana died before any steps could be taken up). MDU started staging ‘ticket plays’ on a regular basis. Initially, an outhouse of Nangbam Shyamkishore, which also happened to be the maternal home of Queen Dhanamanjuri was used as the theatre space. MDU received good royal patronage. [...] But Queen Dhanamanjuri strongly objected to ‘ticket plays’ at her own maternal home as it would belittle her prestige. Owing to this, the venue shifted to a corner of the plot of Chingakham Mayurdhaja. Hijam Irabot took active role in construction of a stage there. He also designed the emblem of MDU, which is a <b>cross-plough.</b> Irabot was also an actor. In a scene from the play “Areppa Marup”, he was acting as a person, who was in desperate need of a sum of Rs. 200/-. So he mouthed the dialogue “lupa channi…” (Rs. two hundred) again and again on the stage. Maharaj Churachand, who was in the audience shouted “hey nunggi lupa channi do eingondagi louro!” (take your Rs. two hundred from me!).|$|R
