5000|$|... m/42 - The most {{well-known}} Swedish military bicycle. It {{was produced by}} several large Swedish bicycle manufacturers (Rex, Husqvarna, Monark, Nymans) from the 1940s to the 1950s with a maximum of interchangeable parts. [...] It uses a rear, one-speed Novo C <b>coaster</b> <b>brake</b> <b>hub,</b> and a Husqvarna-produced front drum brake (chain-operated by an integrated right-hand lever). In addition, it has a large, sturdy rack with a tool box and storage tube for a short frame pump. Weight: up to 26 kg (57 lb.) ...|$|R
2500|$|Coaster-brake {{bicycles}} {{are generally}} {{equipped with a}} single cog and chain wheel and often use ⅛ in (3.2mm) wide chain. [...] However, {{there have been several}} models of <b>coaster</b> <b>brake</b> <b>hubs</b> with dérailleurs, such as the Sachs 2x3. These use special extra-short dérailleurs which can stand up to the forces of being straightened out frequently and do not require an excessive amount of reverse pedal rotation before the <b>brake</b> engages. <b>Coaster</b> <b>brakes</b> have also been incorporated into hub gear designs - for example the AWC and SRC3 from Sturmey-Archer, and the Shimano Nexus 3-speed. They can have up to eight gears, like the Nexus inter-8.|$|R
50|$|Chains come in 3/32 in, 1/8 in, 5/32 in, or 3/16 in roller widths, the {{internal}} width between the inner plates. 1/8 in chains are typically used on bikes {{with a single}} rear sprocket: those with <b>coaster</b> <b>brakes,</b> <b>hub</b> gears, fixed gears such as track bicycles, or BMX bikes. Chains with 3/32 in wide rollers are generally used on bikes with derailleurs such as racing, touring, and mountain bikes. Fixed sprockets and freewheels are also available in 3/32 in widths so fixed-gear and single-speed bikes {{can be set up}} to use the narrower and lighter 3/32 in chains. Finally, chains with 5/32 in wide rollers are used on freight bicycles and tricycles.|$|R
5000|$|... "Shimano Nexus" [...] - Shimano's {{family of}} {{internally}} geared hubs. Available in 3-, 7- and 8-speed {{with or without}} a <b>coaster</b> <b>brake.</b> The Nexus <b>hubs</b> are comparable in range to a full 16-20 speed system.|$|R
2500|$|In 1893, BSA {{commenced}} making bicycle hubs {{and continued}} to supply the cycle trade with bicycle parts up to 1936. BSA bought The Eadie Manufacturing Company of Redditch in 1907 and so began to manufacture the Eadie two speed hub gear and the Eadie <b>coaster</b> <b>brake</b> <b>hub.</b> BSA also {{signed an agreement with}} the Three Speed Gear Syndicate in 1907 to manufacture a 3 speed hub under licence. [...] This was later classified as the Sturmey Archer Type X. BSA introduced a 'Duo' hub in the late 1930s which was capable of one fixed gear and one gear with a freewheel. [...] All BSA hub gear production temporarily ceased in 1939, until they recommenced making their 3 speed hub around 1945. The Eadie coaster hub made a brief return in 1953 on two BSA bicycle models. BSA forever ceased production of their hub gears in 1955.|$|R
50|$|While a chain tool is {{required}} to shorten simple chains on a bicycle, and as described above, can often be used to reconnect them, there are fast-release chain links that allow repeated making and breaking of a chain. They are connected by hand pressure but often need a pair of needle-nosed pliers for removal. These links invariably replace a pair of outside plates on a chain, so joining two sets of inside plates. Bicycles with a single front chainring and rear sprocket (for example bicycles with <b>hub</b> gears or <b>coaster</b> <b>brake</b> <b>hubs)</b> may have a master link on the chain which holds the pin in place with an easily removable c-clip. Some master links are bevelled on top, and can interfere with the smooth operation of a derailleur system. Some derailleur suppliers have produced a chain with a fast-release link, made with straight plates to suit their derailleur products.|$|R
50|$|All Kronan {{bicycles}} have following basic equipment: large tires {{for more}} {{comfort in the}} city, a rear license plate, extra large saddle, <b>coaster</b> <b>brake</b> and front <b>hub</b> <b>brake</b> (As of March 2007, all Kronan models are equipped with a hand brake), dynamo powered front and automatic rear light, rear rack (7 inches (18 cm) wide and 18 inches (46 cm) front to back), stainless steel chain and spokes, steel frame with extra coating for protection, and rims and fenders/mudguards in steel in same color as frame, internal gear hubs, kick stand, bell, and air pump.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Coaster</b> <b>brakes</b> {{have the}} {{advantage}} of being protected from the elements and thus perform well in rain or snow. Though <b>coaster</b> <b>brakes</b> generally go years without needing maintenance, they are more complicated than rim brakes to repair if it becomes necessary, especially the more sophisticated type with expanding <b>brake</b> shoes. <b>Coaster</b> <b>brakes</b> also do not have sufficient heat dissipation for use on long descents, a characteristic made legendary through events such as the 'Repack Downhill' race, where riders almost certainly would need to repack their <b>coaster</b> <b>brakes</b> after the grease melted or smoked due to the heat from lengthy downhill runs. A <b>coaster</b> <b>brake</b> can only be applied when the cranks are reasonably level, limiting how quickly it can be applied. As <b>coaster</b> <b>brakes</b> are only made for rear wheels, they have the disadvantage common to all rear brakes of skidding the wheel easily. This disadvantage may, however, be alleviated if the bicycle also has a hand-lever-operated front brake and the cyclist uses it. Another disadvantage is that the <b>coaster</b> <b>brake</b> is completely dependent on the chain being fully intact and engaged. If the chain breaks or disengages from the chainwheel and/or rear sprocket, the <b>coaster</b> <b>brake</b> provides no braking power whatsoever. [...] Like all <b>hub</b> <b>brakes</b> except disc <b>brakes,</b> a <b>coaster</b> <b>brake</b> requires a reaction arm to be connected to the frame. [...] This may require unbolting when the wheel is removed or moved in its fork ends to adjust chain tension.|$|R
50|$|With {{hand-operated}} brakes, {{force is}} applied to brake levers mounted on the handlebars and transmitted via Bowden cables or hydraulic lines to the friction pads. A rear <b>hub</b> <b>brake</b> may be either hand-operated or pedal-actuated, as in the back pedal <b>coaster</b> <b>brakes</b> which were popular in North America until the 1960s, and are common in children's bicycles.|$|R
25|$|With {{hand-operated}} brakes, {{force is}} applied to brake levers mounted on the handlebars and transmitted via Bowden cables or hydraulic lines to the friction pads, which apply pressure to the braking surface, causing friction which slows the bicycle down. A rear <b>hub</b> <b>brake</b> may be either hand-operated or pedal-actuated, as in the back pedal <b>coaster</b> <b>brakes</b> which were popular in North America until the 1960s.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Coaster</b> <b>brake</b> - <b>coaster</b> <b>brakes</b> are a {{particular}} type of drum brake which is actuated by a backward pressure applied to the pedals. The mechanism is contained inside the bicycle wheel hub shell.|$|R
5000|$|Hub gears can be {{manufactured}} {{to include a}} <b>coaster</b> <b>brake</b> (though not all hub gears are available with <b>coaster</b> <b>brakes).</b> This is not possible with derailleur systems, because the chain cannot transmit a backwards pull.|$|R
50|$|In 1898, {{after the}} advent of {{freewheel}} coasting mechanisms, the first internal <b>coaster</b> <b>brakes</b> were introduced for the rear wheel. The <b>coaster</b> <b>brake</b> was contained in the rear wheel hub, and was engaged and controlled by backpedaling, thus eliminating the issue of tyre wear. In the United States, the <b>coaster</b> <b>brake</b> was the most commonly fitted brake throughout {{the first half of}} the 20th century, often comprising the only braking system on the bicycle.|$|R
50|$|Many {{were sold}} as either single speed with <b>coaster</b> <b>brake</b> or {{fitted with a}} Sturmey-Archer AW three-speed hub. The New-Zealand-manufactured version was offered with a duomatic {{two-speed}} hub, which shifted gears by kicking back the pedals and also had a built-in <b>coaster</b> <b>brake.</b>|$|R
50|$|Unlike most {{drum brakes}} (but like a Shimano roller <b>brake)</b> a <b>coaster</b> <b>brake</b> is {{designed}} to run with all its internal parts coated in grease for quiet operation and smooth engagement.

50|$|<b>Coaster</b> <b>brakes</b> and rim brakes were common. The 1968 Schwinn Krate models had a {{front drum}} brake. The 1972 Schwinn Pea Picker {{included}} a rear disc brake.|$|R
5000|$|Until about 2000 Kronan bikes {{were only}} {{available}} in {{a limited number of}} colors, with a single gear and <b>coaster</b> <b>brakes.</b> New models have been added with 3-speed SRAM hub gears and drum brakes.|$|R

50|$|The 1st {{downhill}} time-trial race {{took place}} in Fairfax, California on October 21, 1976 on a fireroad now referred to as Repack Road, due {{to the need to}} repack the <b>hub</b> <b>brake</b> after each descent. The bikes used were based on cruiser bicycles that had a drum or <b>coaster</b> <b>brake</b> that worked by pedalling backwards. The mechanism operated with a conical brake shoe being wound on a thread in a metal hub. To prevent the brake from seizing it was kept filled with grease. Heavy use during the descent would cause the brake to over heat, softening the grease and causing it to drain from the hub, requiring frequent repacking. Ten riders descended 1300 ft of Repack road in about 5 minutes.|$|R
50|$|Though made {{obsolete}} by {{the introduction}} of the duck <b>brake,</b> <b>coaster</b> <b>brake,</b> and rod brake, spoon brakes continued {{to be used in the}} West supplementally on adult bicycles until the 1930s, and on children's bicycles until the 1950s. In the developing world, they were manufactured until much more recently.|$|R
50|$|Some {{innovations}} {{introduced in}} bicycles designed for military use {{found their way}} to civilian markets as well, such as <b>coaster</b> <b>brakes</b> and the cyclometer.

50|$|Enclosed {{drum brakes}} or a rear <b>coaster</b> <b>brake</b> are used on most European city bikes, rather than rim brakes. A bike with drum brakes is {{optimized}} for stopping in wet weather: in wet weather, drum brakes provide more stopping power and reliability than rim brakes; but in dry weather, less.|$|R
50|$|In 1975 {{he was one}} of {{the first}} racers to covert from <b>coaster</b> <b>brakes</b> to freewheels and caliper brakes. By {{comparison}} Stu Thomsen would not covert until 1978. He also was one of the first to use light weight components in an era of 30 to 40 pound race bikes.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1960s, Bendix {{automotive}} brakes blossomed {{with the}} introduction of fixed-caliper disc brakes and the [...] "Duo-Servo" [...] system (which became, virtually, a de facto world standard for drum brakes). During the 1960s, Bendix also dabbled in bicycle hardware, producing a reliable, totally self-contained, 2-speed [...] "Kick-Back" [...] planetary rear axle with <b>coaster</b> <b>braking.</b>|$|R
50|$|Rims {{designed}} for use with rim brakes provide a smooth parallel braking surface, while rims meant for use with disc <b>brakes</b> or <b>hub</b> <b>brakes</b> sometimes lack this surface.|$|R
