25|$|Later {{development}} of the Stelo stagnated. The Universal League founders wanted to show their good will by maintaining a constant value for the Stelo, but their efforts were doomed to failure. The Dutch price of bread gradually increased, but nobody thought to adjust {{the relationship between the}} Stelo and the guilder. The ratio remained four Steloj to the guilder, and bank <b>currency</b> <b>conversion</b> tables were used to fix the value of the Stelo in other countries. Moreover, even the Universal League gave up the idea of recording bookkeeping transactions in Stelo monetary units, so nobody gained experience with a coin of constant value. It is no wonder that the Stelo lost its reputation and that its use even by Esperantists became rare.|$|E
25|$|In {{the final}} months before Zimbabwe's central bank reforms of 30 April 2008, {{virtually}} all popular <b>currency</b> <b>conversion</b> resources relied upon the official rate of 30,000 ZWD to 1 USD for published figures, {{in spite of}} the vast differences between that and free market rates. By 23 May 2008, Bloomberg and Oanda began publishing floating rates based on Zimbabwe's formally regulated domestic bank market, while Yahoo Finance started using the updated official rate in July, albeit with a decimal point shift of 6 places. Those reported rates generally reflected the Official Rate as shown in the above table. They soon began to differ, in overvaluation of the Zimbabwean dollar, increasingly substantially in comparison to less regulated markets such as offshore markets or paper cash freely traded on the streets of Harare, reflected above as Parallel Rates.|$|E

40|$|Financial {{transactions}} {{taxes have}} recently gained attention {{as a possible}} means to influence the behavior of financial markets and to reduce destabilizing capital flows. One variation is a tax on all foreign <b>currency</b> <b>conversions,</b> often termed a “Tobin tax. ” This paper suggests that these taxes would probably not produce the desired effects and {{would be difficult to}} design and implement. It is unclear that the possible advantages in reducing some short-term speculative trading would outweigh the possible disadvantages in impairing the efficiency of financial markets.
