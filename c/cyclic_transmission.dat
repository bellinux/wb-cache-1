This problem, named optimal power flow (OPF), is nonconvex due to the nonlinearities imposed {{by the laws of}} physics, and has been studied since 1962. We have recently shown that a convex relaxation based on semidefinite programming (SDP) is able to find a global solution of OPF for IEEE benchmark systems, and moreover this technique is guaranteed to work over acyclic (distribution) networks. The present work studies the potential of the SDP relaxation for OPF over <b>cyclic</b> (<b>transmission)</b> networks. Given an arbitrary weakly-cyclic network with cycles of size 3, it is shown that the injection region is convex in the lossless case and that the Pareto front of the injection region is convex in the lossy case. It is also proved that the SDP relaxation of OPF is exact for this type of network. Moreover, it is shown that if the SDP relaxation is not exact for a general mesh network, it still has a low-rank solution whose rank depends on the structure of the network. Finally, a heuristic method is proposed to recover a rank- 1 solution for the SDP relaxation whenever the relaxation is not exact. I...|$|E

In Trypanosoma brucei stock EATRO 1125, the VATs AnTat 1. 30 and 1. 45 are reproducibly present in about 15 % and 4 % of the metacyclic population, respectively. The genes encoding the corresponding antigens or variant surface glycoproteins (VSGs) are in telomeres of large chromosomes, as are some non-metacyclic VSG genes from the same stock. Their activation mechanism has been studied in seven independent clones, 3 of which, referred to as 'first wave' metacyclic VATs (M-VATs), have been cloned from the first wave of parasitemia after <b>cyclic</b> <b>transmission.</b> In all these clones, activation of the antigen gene was linked to the transposition of an expression linked copy (ELC) of the gene to a telomeric expression site. For first wave M-VATs, this site seems variable, although restricted to large chromosomes, and it can be re-used for VSG gene expression in the bloodstream form. In 'late bloodstream' M-VATs, isolated from established chronic infections, the active expression site, {{at the end of a}} 200 kb chromosome, is the one preferred for the expression of late antigen types. It can be concluded that no characteristic feature in the genomic location and expression mechanism can distinguish metacyclic antigen genes from those expressed in the bloodstream forms, although the control of their expression must clearly be different.

40|$|Background: West Nile virus (WNV) {{infection}} is an {{emerging zoonotic disease}} caused by an RNA virus of the genus Flavivirus. WNV is preserved in the environment through <b>cyclic</b> <b>transmission,</b> with mosquitoes, particularly Culex species, serving as a vector, birds as an amplifying host and humans and other mammals as dead-end hosts. To date, no studies {{have been carried out}} to determine the prevalence of the WNV antibody in Malaysia. The aim {{of this study was to}} screen for the seroprevalence of the WNV in Malaysia's Orang Asli population. Methods: Serum samples of 742 Orang Asli were collected in seven states in peninsular Malaysia. The samples were assessed to determine the seroprevalence of WNV immunoglobulin (Ig) G with the WNV IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. For each individual, we documented the demographic factors. Anti-dengue and anti-tick-borne encephalitis virus IgG ELISA were also performed to rule out a cross reaction. All statistical analyses were performed using the GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad Software, Inc.); p values of less than 0. 05 were considered significant. Results: The serosurvey included 298 men (40. 16 %) and 444 women (59. 84 %) of Malaysia's Orang Asli. Anti-WNV IgG was found in 9 of the 742 samples (1. 21 %). The seroprevalence was 0. 67 % (2 of 298) in men and 1. 58 % (7 of 444) in women. The presence of anti-WNV IgG was found not to be associated with gender but, however, did correlate with age. The peak seroprevalence was found to be 2. 06 % (2 of 97) in individuals between 30 to 42 years of age. Conclusions: No previous studies have examined the seroprevalence of the WNV antibody in the human population in Malaysia, and no clinical reports of infections have been made. Screening for the WNV seroprevalence is very significant because of many risk factors contribute to the presence of WNV in Malaysia, such as the abundance of Culex mosquitoes as the main vector and a high degree of biodiversity, including migratory birds that serve as a reservoir to the virus...|$|E

In fact, the nature of the wireless medium has created a number of new challenging and fascinating research topics. In particular, a prerequisite for achieving higher and higher transmission rates in wireless systems is to develop strategies for efficiently dealing with the frequency selectivity of the wireless channel. A good candidate is the so-called <b>cyclic</b> prefixed block <b>transmission,</b> and in particular its two most popular variants which are the cyclic prefixed single-carrier (CPSC) and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulations.

Firstly, this thesis contributes to the current state-of-the-art on the performance comparison between CPSC and OFDM, focusing on the derivation of analytical results when possible. If the channel state information is not available at the transmitter side, CPSC with minimum mean square error linear receiver is shown to achieve the best trade-off between performance and complexity, as it exploits the multipath diversity under some realistic hypotheses. Secondly, this thesis aims at using a system-based or cross-layer criterion, called goodput, for allocating resource in a coded OFDM system. Interestingly, the well-known waterfilling solution, when adequately parametrized, is proved to be near-optimal from a goodput point of view.

40|$|The {{prototype}} Alphavirus, Sindbis virus (SIN), {{relies on}} <b>cyclic</b> <b>transmission</b> between the mosquito and vertebrate hosts {{in order to}} be maintained in nature. This broad host range suggests that alphaviruses use a universally expressed molecule for attachment. Heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG), a ubiquitous SIN receptor present on the cell surface of most eukaryotic cells, has been reported in the salivary glands and midguts of mosquitoes. These organs are essential for virus transmission from this hematophageous invertebrate. Variable host cell response in the mosquito following intrathoracic inoculation with SIN has been documented. In this study, per os infection of Aedine species with variants of SIN was used to determine organ specific responses to virus as well as the temporal kinetics of SIN dissemination via leg assay. Analysis indicated AR 339 virus dissemination in samples at day 14 days post infection (p. i.). TR 339 was identified at day 12 in legs of virus fed individuals. AR 339, the HSPG adapted variant resulted in SIN-associated pathology in salivary glands of Aedes albopictus. This pathology was limited to lateral lobes, while the median lobe remained unaffected. Infection with TR 339, a HSPG-independent variant, did not result in virus-associated pathology in the salivary gland to day 28 post infection. Immunohistochemistry determined that HSPG was located in the lateral lobe duct region of the salivary glands. It has been suggested that human lactoferrin (hLF) may interfere with virus receptor attachment and is involved in inhibition of virus infection in vertebrate cells. To that end, the effects of bovine LF inhibition on virus attachment were compared between AR 339 and TR 339 in the mosquito cell line C 7 - 10. Cytopathic effect was observed earlier and with greater intensity in TR 339 infected monolayers when compared to AR 339 infected monolayers. This suggests that bovine LF has an inhibitory effect on AR 339 infection in invertebrate cells, possibly due to this variants use of HPSG for attachment...|$|E
40|$|Most {{mitochondrial}} transcripts in African trypanosomes are edited {{to generate}} translatable transcripts. The reaction is catalyzed by a macromolecular protein complex, the 20 S editosome. Editing {{is characterized by}} the site-specific insertion and/or deletion of exclusively U nucleotides and in order to catalyze the reaction, editosomes must bind a panel of different substrate pre-mRNAs. The experiments documented in chapter one verify that 20 S editosomes bind different “in vivo-sized” transcripts with nanomolar affinities and association/dissociation rate constants typical for RNA/protein complexes. The editosome/RNA interaction is non-discriminative, thus enabling the interaction with different pre-edited mRNAs as well as with partially edited mRNAs and guide RNAs. Using immunogold-labeling in combination with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) I was able to demonstrate that editosomes have only one RNA substrate-binding site, which suggests that both subtypes of the RNA editing reaction (U-insertion and U-deletion) are catalyzed within a single, bifunctional reaction center. In chapter two I present the first atomicforce microscopy (AFM) -based pictures of 20 S editosomes and 20 S editosome/RNA complexes. The data confirm that editosomes have a single RNA binding domain and further demonstrate that editosomes contain a so far unknown “chaperone-type” RNA unwinding activity. Upon RNA binding, transcripts become progressively unwound, ultimately enabling multiple 20 S editosomes to interact with one substrate RNA. RNA editing is a pre-requisite for the survival of Trypanosoma brucei. The life cycle of the parasite involves the <b>cyclic</b> <b>transmission</b> between a mammalian host and the Tsetse fly as the insect vector. Since RNA editing {{has been shown to be}} regulated between the two developmental stages, I analyzed in chapter three whether RNA editing is also regulated within the cell cycle of the parasite. Editosome isolates from the G 1 - and G 2 -phase of the trypanosome cell cycle were tested for their RNA editing activity. The experiments identified catalytic activity in both phases thus demonstrating that the processing reaction is not cell cycle-regulated. The basic steps of the editing reaction cycle have been unraveled with the help of an in vitro assay that is per-formed at dilute solvent conditions. However, in vivo the reaction takes place inside the highly “crowded” mitochondrial environment. In chapter four I analyzed the effects of macro-molecular crowding on RNA editing using defined conditions from dilute to semidilute to crowded solvent proper-ties. I was able to demonstrate that the thermodynamic stabilities of the pre-mRNA/gRNA hybrid RNAs differ at these conditions. Crowded solvent properties stabilize the RNA molecules and alter the rate constants for the association and dissociation of the substrate RNAs to editosomes. Ultimately, the processing reaction is inhibited. These results imply that the in vivo reaction cannot rely on a diffusionally-controlled, collision-based mechanism. The data advocate a scenario in which RNA editing is conducted by a “hand-over” or “channeling” of substrate RNAs from one processing machinery to the next. ...|$|E

In this letter, a soft-decision-directed correction (SDDC) -aided turbo FDE technique is presented for reduced-CP SC-based block transmission systems using conventional frame structures. The relations with some already known iterative FDE techniques are established, and a set of performance results is reported and dis-cussed. The advantages of the proposed approach are emphasized, namely, the possibility of approximately achieving (besides the obvious bandwidth efficiency gain) the maximum power efficiency gain that a strong CP reduction allows.

A new conductive superparamagnetic nanocomposite, γ-Fe 2 O 3 /polyaniline-curcumin (γ-Fe 2 O 3 /PANI-curcumin), was prepared {{by using the}} interaction between an amino group in polyaniline and a ketone group in curcumin. The γ-Fe 2 O 3 /PANI-curcumin nanocomposite showed superparamagnetism (30 emu·g− 1) and electrochemical activity, {{based on the results}} of magnetization curve and <b>cyclic</b> voltammetry (CV). <b>Transmission</b> electron microscope (TEM) indicated that the particle size of γ-Fe 2 O 3 /PANI-curcumin was between 10 and 50 nm. Fourier transform infrared spectra (FT-IR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were used to characterize the γ-Fe 2 O 3 /PANI-curcumin nanocomposite, confirming that curcumin was immobilized into the γ-Fe 2 O 3 /PANI chain.

40|$|MC-CDMA (MultiCarrier Code Division Multiple Access), {{currently}} {{regarded as}} a promissing multiple access scheme for broadband communications, is known to combine the advantages of an OFDM-based (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing), CP-assisted (<b>Cyclic</b> Prefix) block <b>transmission</b> with those of CDMA systems. Recently, it was recognised that DS-CDMA (Direct Sequence) implementations can also {{take advantage of the}} beneficts of the CP-assisted block transmission approach, therefore enabling an efficient use of FFT-based (Fast Fourier Transform), chip level FDE (Frequency- Domain Equalisation) techniques. In this paper we consider the use of IB-DFE (Iterative Block Decision Feedback Equalisation) FDE techniques within both CP-assisted MC-CDMA systems with frequency-domain spreading and DS-CDMA systems. Our simulation results show that an IB-DFE receiver with moderate complexity is suitable in both cases, with excellent performances that can be close to the single-code matched filter bound (especially for the CP-assisted DSCDMA alternative), even with full code usage...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a <b>cyclic</b> prefixed conjugate <b>transmission</b> technique with adaptive receiver {{to cancel out}} the ICI in OFDM systems using MMSE equalizer. The receiver design {{is based on the}} phase rotated conjugate cancellation (PRCC) concept, where two individual phase rotations are employed on the two receive paths, rather than only one phase rotation is adopted for the two transmit paths in the PRCC scheme. Cyclic prefix increases signal spacing and makes the signal more robust to ISI. The two phase rotations are chosen properly using the criterion of maximizing the carrier-to-interference ratio such that an additional phase distortion on the detected symbol could be completely removed. Block least mean-squared algorithm is applied to adaptively update the two phase rotations with the frequency offset variation. BER performance of the proposed method with MMSE and Zero Forcing Equalizer is compared. Simulation results shows that MMSE equalizer based approach can further improve the performance of proposed scheme at low to medium SNRs...|$|R
40|$|Abstract – We {{propose a}} simple inter-symbol {{interference}} (ISI) and inter-block interference (IBI) cancellation scheme for single carrier block <b>transmission</b> with <b>cyclic</b> prefix (SC-CP) systems with insufficient guard interval (GI). In the SC-CP system, the equalization and demodulation processing is {{conducted in a}} block-by-block manner, therefore, the IBI can be reduced by using previously detected data signals. For the ISI cancellation, we firstly generate replica signal of the ISI using tentative decisions {{in order to make}} the defective channel matrix to be circulant, and then we perform the conventional FDE to compensate the ISI. We also derive minimum mean–square–error (MMSE) and zero forcing (ZF) equalizers for the shake of performance benchmark. Computer simulation results show that the proposed interference cancellation scheme can significantly improve the bit error rate (BER) performance and can outperform the MMSE equalizer while it requires lower computational complexity.

40|$|Guard periods {{are widely}} used to avoid inter block {{interference}} in wireless communication systems. The independent processing of each data block enables computational efficient data estimation, however, the necessary insertion of guard periods produces a transmission overhead and reduces the throughput of the respective transmission system. By using overlapping techniques a block-wise data estimation can be realized without using guard periods. With this modification, either the throughput of the system can be increased or the code rate of the forward error correction code can be reduced. Based on the latter option we will propose two optimized channel coding schemes for the overlapping based system. The first uses a reduced code rate while the second exploits the characteristic error distribution of the overlapping based data estimator. The bit error performance of the resulting transmission systems is finally compared to a common <b>cyclic</b> prefix based <b>transmission</b> system.
