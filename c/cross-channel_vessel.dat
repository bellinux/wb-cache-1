5000|$|The Dour leads {{straight}} into the English Channel, so speculation has been made ever since its discovery about whether the Dover boat went to sea and sailed to the Continent. There is plenty of evidence that there was cross-Channel communication, {{but it is not}} known what kind of boats actually sailed across. Keith Miller, a regional archaeologist told the BBC that the older Ferriby Boats would have been used to cross the North Sea and certainly the Ferriby Heritage Trust describe Ferriby Boat 3 as Europe's first known seacraft. [...] The BBC television programme Operation Stonehenge: What Lies Beneath Pt 2, broadcast on BBC Two in September 2014, describes the boat as seagoing and describes the tons of cargo it could have taken across the Channel. However, The Dover Museum consider that the Dover Bronze Age Boat is the oldest seagoing boat known, at only 1550 BC. They are backed by a different channel and programme from the BBC- Neil Oliver in the Bronze Age episode of A History of Ancient Britain [...] They are also backed by the Time Team Special, broadcast in September 2014 on UK Channel 4, which stated that to be a proper sea-going, <b>cross-channel</b> <b>vessel</b> the boat would have to have the curved 'rocker' bottom and the (unproven) pointed bow that only the more modern Dover boat possesses. Confusingly, the Oakleaf reproduction of the Ferriby boats was given a pointed bow and the Ferriby boats are described by the museum that houses them as having curved rocker bottoms, which sounds much the same as the Dover boat.|$|E
50|$|Ditchburn and Mare {{were among}} the first {{builders}} of iron ships in the area; their partnership commenced with the construction of small paddle steamers of between 50 and 100 tons, before progressing to <b>cross-Channel</b> <b>vessels</b> and by 1840 were building ships of more than 300 tons. The company's early customers included the Iron Steamboat Company and the Blackwall Railway Company, several paddle steamers being constructed for the latter, including the Meteor and the Prince of Wales, which operated between Gravesend and the company's station on Brunswick Wharf.|$|R
50|$|It was a <b>cross-channel</b> cargo <b>vessel,</b> reconstructed as some 13.6 m {{long and}} 3.4 m wide and 1 m in draught. Later studies, {{including}} dendrochronology {{determined that it}} was built from oak, in the mid-890s. It was abandoned in the mud in 950AD. It was also found {{that one of the}} last cargos it carried was hops (vines used in making beer). Other remains include fragments of quern-stones (grinding stones) made from Mayen lava, located in the Rhineland, Germany.|$|R
5000|$|The Navy {{found that}} <b>cross-Channel</b> {{passenger}} <b>vessels</b> were particularly suitable {{because of their}} large cargo capacity. As experience with the programme increased, the armed boarding vessels received heavier armament. The Navy realized the need for heavier armament after the German auxiliary cruiser [...] attacked and sank the armed boarding ship HMS Ramsey on 8 August 1915. The Navy wanted to arm the boarding ships with some obsolete 14" [...] torpedo tubes, and modern 4" [...] (102mm) guns (possibly the BL 4 inch naval gun Mk VII); Meteor had sunk Ramsey using both a torpedo, and gunfire from two 88mm (3.5") guns.|$|R
