[...] School of Computing and Engineering. University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2016 The strain gauge is a commonly used tool for dynamic load and strain measurement of a system. The work {{presented in this}} thesis describes the development and evaluation of strain gauges applied to both an aerodynamic decelerator system and an unmanned aerial vehicle. This thesis has three main objectives: (1) develop and evaluate test a circular parachute strain gauge-based load distribution measurement system, (2) develop and evaluate a strain gauge thrust estimation system for a quadrotor unmanned aircraft, and (3) compare the developed strain gauge-based thrust estimation technique with an indirect real time parameter estimation technique for motor fault detection. In pursuit of the ﬁrst thesis objective, a load distribution measurement system for the suspension lines of circular parachutes was developed. The motivation to create a load distribution measurement system stems from parachute system design traditionally requiring an extensive ﬂight testing regimen. Numerical solution-based design is difﬁcult due to the highly nonlinear deformation behavior of the parachute canopy. Traditionally, circular parachutes are assumed to have symmetric <b>canopy</b> <b>loading</b> upon inﬂation and during terminal descent. Asymmetric <b>canopy</b> <b>loading</b> can have a signiﬁcant impact on circular parachute suspension line loads, but is typically neglected. The developed strain gauge-based load distribution measurement system for circular parachutes has wireless capabilities and can be readily applied {{to a wide variety}} of aerodynamic declarator systems. The developed system can be used to observe asymmetric behaviors in order to help determine the signiﬁcance of asymmetric <b>canopy</b> <b>loading.</b> Custom strain gauge load cells with mounted custom circuitry to calibrate, amplify, and transmit the load data were ﬁxed to canopy suspension lines. Parachute drop testing was performed to evaluate the effectiveness to identify any signiﬁcant asymmetric <b>canopy</b> <b>loading</b> behavior. Drop testing was performed with a 1. 2 m (4. 0 ft) quarter-spherical cross based canopy with a payload of 2. 0 kg (4. 4 lbs). A 12 m (39 ft) guide-line based drop rig was implemented to prevent canopy rotational movement that could hinder testing repeatability. Load distribution data was ﬁrst veriﬁed via both static calibration and in-ﬂight total canopy load measurements. Drop testing was then conducted to identify loading asymmetry during both inﬂation and terminal descent. Results demonstrated the use of the strain gauge-based load distribution measurement system for measuring signiﬁcant asymmetric <b>canopy</b> <b>loading</b> patterns. In pursuit of the second thesis objective, strain gauges were used to aid in the development of a thrust estimation system for individual motors/propellers of a small quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Small UAVs have become increasingly utilized for a wide range of applications; however, such aircraft typically do not undergo the same rigorous safety protocols as their larger human-piloted counterparts. A thrust estimation technique for a quadrotor unmanned aircraft was developed and evaluated that could potentially improve ﬂight control design by increasing sensory feedback information. Strain gauges were integrated into the quadrotor frame to provide total force measurements on each arm of the aircraft. A dynamic model coupled with state information from motion capture and on-board measurement data was implemented to compensate for inertial forces caused by rotational and translational acceleration. Testing was conducted to evaluate the accuracy of the individual load cells, inertial compensation,and free-ﬂight motor thrust estimates. Results demonstrate inertial force compensation during high frequency aircraft motion, which could potentially be useful for detecting an in-ﬂight failure. The measurement system therefore has the potential to quickly detect an in-ﬂight failure. The focus of the third thesis objective is to expand on the development of the thrust estimation system by performing an evaluation of the fault detection capabilities. A comparative study was conducted of the thrust estimation system along with a real time parameter estimation in the frequency domain during two motor failure scenarios of a small quadrotor UAV. Detecting and mitigating disturbances caused by in-ﬂight mo tor/propeller failures is an important aspect of a robust ﬂight controller for multirotor aircraft. The comparative study was performed in an attempt to determine whether direct thrust estimation (strain gauge-based) or indirect thrust estimation (parameter estimation using on-board measurement) more accurately and quickly capture an in-ﬂight failure. Flight test results were post-processed to mimic real-time parameter estimation and strain gauged-based fault detection. Results show the strain gauge-based parameter estimation exhibits noisy estimates, but does have faster response to the failure. The parameter estimation using onboard data does not respond to failures as quickly as the strain-gauge based technique, but does produce better parameter estimate stability. Although both estimation techniques display strengths and weaknesses, neither technique is optimal for real time failure detection individually. A combination of the real-time parameter estimation in the frequency domain and the strain gauge-based thrust estimation techniques may yield a fast yet stable fault detection system. The evaluation of the fault detection capabilities of the thrust estimation system did not prove unsuccessful, however it has warranted further investigation into the overall effectiveness of the system for fault detection.

40|$|The Crew Exploration Vehicle Parachute Assembly System (CPAS) {{is being}} {{designed}} {{to land the}} Orion Crew Module (CM) at a safe rate of descent at splashdown. Flight test performance must be measured to {{a high degree of}} accuracy to ensure this requirement is met with the most efficient design possible. Although the design includes three CPAS Main parachutes, the requirement is that the system must not exceed 33 ft/s under two Main parachutes, should one of the Main parachutes fail. Therefore, several tests were conducted with clusters of two Mains. All of the steady-state rate of descent data are normalized to standard sea level conditions and checked against the limit. As the Orion design gains weight, the system is approaching this limit to within measurement precision. Parachute "breathing," cluster interactions, and atmospheric anomalies can cause the rate of descent to vary widely and lead to challenges in characterizing parachute terminal performance. An early test had contradictory rate of descent results from optical trajectory and Differential Global Positioning Systems (DGPS). A thorough analysis of the data sources and error propagation was conducted to determine the uncertainty in the trajectory. It was discovered that the Time Space Position Information (TSPI) from the optical tracking provided accurate position data. However, the velocity from TPSI must be computed via numerical differentiation, which is prone to large error. DGPS obtains position through pseudo-range calculations from multiple satellites and velocity through Doppler shift of the carrier frequency. Because the velocity from DGPS is a direct measurement, it is more accurate than TSPI velocity. To remedy the situation, a commercial off-the-shelf product that combines GPS and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) was purchased to significantly improve rate of descent measurements. This had the added benefit of solving GPS dropouts during aircraft extraction. Statistical probability distributions for CPAS Main parachute rate of descent and drag coefficient were computed and plotted. Using test data, a terminal rate of descent at splashdown can be estimated as a function of <b>canopy</b> <b>loading...</b>|$|E

40|$|The fuel complex {{variables}} canopy {{bulk density}} and canopy base height {{are often used}} to predict crown fire initiation and spread. Direct measurement of these variables is impractical, and they are usually estimated indirectly by modelling. Recent advances in predicting crown fire behaviour require accurate estimates of the complete vertical distribution of canopy fuels. The objectives {{of the present study}} were to model the vertical profile of available canopy fuel in pine stands by using data from the Spanish national forest inventory plus low-density airborne laser scanning (ALS) metrics. In a first step, the vertical distribution of the <b>canopy</b> fuel <b>load</b> was modelled using the Weibull probability density function. In a second step, two different systems of models were fitted to estimate the canopy variables defining the vertical distributions; the first system related these variables to stand variables obtained in a field inventory, and the second system related the canopy variables to airborne laser scanning metrics. The models of each system were fitted simultaneously to compensate the effects of the inherent cross-model correlation between the canopy variables. Heteroscedasticity was also analyzed, but no correction in the fitting process was necessary. The estimated <b>canopy</b> fuel <b>load</b> profiles from field variables explained 84 % and 86 % of the variation in <b>canopy</b> fuel <b>load</b> for maritime pine and radiata pine respectively; whereas the estimated <b>canopy</b> fuel <b>load</b> profiles from ALS metrics explained 52 % and 49 % of the variation for the same species.

Plots are presented that show the distribution of pressure at four longitudinal stations through each canopy for a range of conditions selected {{to determine the effects of}} varying canopy position, yaw, lift coefficient, and power. The results indicate that the maximum loads, based on the external-internal pressure differential, for the front and rear canopies were obtained with the airplane simulating the high speed flight condition. The highest loading on the front canopy was in the exploding direction for the configuration with the front and rear canopies closed. The highest loads on the rear canopy were in the crushing direction with the front canopy open and the rear canopy closed. For most of the simulated flight conditions, the highest loads on the front canopy, per unit area, were over twice as great as the highest loads on the rear canopy when the comparison was made for the most critical canopy configuration in each case. The external pressure distribution over the front and rear canopies, which were fairly symmetrical to 0 degree angle of yaw, were greatly distorted at other yaw attitudes, particularly for the propeller operating conditions.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the pyric environment that influences the crown fire initiation and spread in Aleppo pine forests in Greece. Regression equations that predict the <b>canopy</b> fuel <b>load</b> by diameter class were developed for Aleppo pine in northern Evia, Greece. The log/log transformation of the allometric model y=axb gave the best fit for all crown fuel components except the branches with diameter > 7. 5 cm. The R 2 values were between 0. 82 and 0. 88 and SEE were small. Forty Aleppo pine trees were classified into groups according to their expected available <b>canopy</b> fuel <b>load,</b> by applying multivariate statistical methods (Hierarchical Cluster Analysis and Canonical Discriminant Analysis) on the values of their most significant dendrometric characteristics (diameter at breast height, total height, live crown length, crown width). Inventory of the critical canopy fuel characteristics that influence the initiation and spread of crown fires was conducted in representative Aleppo pine stands in the Kassandra peninsula, Greece. Vertical profiles of available <b>canopy</b> fuel <b>load,</b> <b>canopy</b> base height and canopy bulk density are presented. Aleppo pine crown fuel complexes are characterized by low canopy base height, while available <b>canopy</b> fuel <b>load</b> and <b>canopy</b> bulk density values are similar with other conifer fuel types worldwide. Crown fire behavior (probability of crown fire initiation, fire type, crown fire rate of spread, fireline intensity and flame length) in Aleppo pine stands with various surface fuel types and under various meteorological conditions, was simulated with modern and field-tested models of crown fire prediction. The simulation results indicated that crown fires in Aleppo pines forests cover a wide range of expected fire behavior. The probability of crown fire initiation was found high and passive crown fires and high intensity active crown fires were observed in uneven aged and even aged stands, respectively. Assessment of potential crown fire behavior is required in regional fire management planning and suppression tactics. Nomographs for the calculation of the pyric parameters (probability of crown fire initiation, active crown fire rate of spread, fireline intensity and flame length) of crown fires burning in the Aleppo pines stands in Greece were created. Fuel complexes typical of Aleppo pine forests were comprised and used as inputs to recent models of crown fire prediction, in order to calculate the pyric parameters under a wide range of environmental conditions. The results are considered as realistic, based on common experience of crown fire behavior in conifer forests, worldwide. Such nomographs are presented for the first time in Greece and are expected to offer substantial help to fire management practice. Fuel treatments that affect crown fire behavior in Aleppo pine stands were simulated under extreme and normal fuel moisture conditions. Treatments were simulated by adjusting surface fuels (total load, load-by-size class, depth) and canopy fuels (available <b>canopy</b> fuel <b>load,</b> <b>canopy</b> base height, canopy bulk density). Under typical conditions, stand thinning followed by prescribed burning and/or controlled grazing with slash removal avert crown fire initiation in most cases. Restoration of Aleppo pines ecosystems must include an analysis of how proposed treatments affect fuel structures.

Two high resolution images were used originally for discriminating Aleppo and Calabrian pines crown regions through a geographic object based image analysis approach. Subsequently, the crown region images were segmented using a watershed segmentation algorithm and crown width was extracted. The overall accuracy of the tree crown isolation expressed through a perfect match between the reference and the delineated crowns was 34. 00 % for the Kassandra site and 48. 11 % for the Thessaloniki site, while the coefficient of determination between the ground measured and the satellite extracted crown width was 0. 5. <b>Canopy</b> fuel <b>load</b> values estimated {{in the current study}} presented mean values from 1. 29 ± 0. 6 to 1. 65 ± 0. 7 kg/m 2 similar to other conifers worldwide.

40|$|Abstract. Precise {{knowledge}} of fuel conditions {{is important for}} predicting fire hazards and simulating fire growth and intensity across the landscape. We present amethodology to retrieve andmap forest canopy fuel and other forest structural parameters using small-footprint full-waveform airborne {{light detection and ranging}} (LiDAR) data. Full-waveform LiDAR sensors register the complete returned backscattered signal through time and can describe physical properties of the intercepted objects. This study was undertaken in a mixed forest dominated by Douglas-fir, occasionally mixed with other conifers, in north-west Oregon (United States). We extracted two sets of LiDAR metrics using pulse detection and waveform modelling and then constructed several predictive models using forward stepwise multiple linear regression. The resulting models explained, 80 % of the variability for many of the canopy fuel and forest structure parameters: aboveground biomass (R 2 0. 84), quadratic mean diameter (R 2 0. 82), canopy height (R 2 0. 79), canopy base height (R 2 0. 78) and <b>canopy</b> fuel <b>load</b> (R 2 0. 79).

30|$|Prescribed and {{resource}} benefit fires {{are used to}} manage fuels in fire-prone landscapes in the Southwest. These practices, however, typically occur under different conditions, potentially leading to differences in fire behavior and effects. The objectives {{of this study were}} to investigate the effects of recent prescribed fires, resource benefit fires, and repeated fires in ponderosa pine forests, as well as recent resource benefit fires in pinyon-juniper woodlands. The Gila National Forest was the study area because it has a rich history of using fire as a restoration tool. In each vegetation type, fuels and stand structure were sampled using random plots stratified by burn severity in resource benefit fires. In ponderosa pine, sampling and analysis also included prescribed fire and areas subject to repeated resource benefit fires. To assess potential fire behavior, we used the crown fire behavior prediction model Nexus using ninetieth percentile weather conditions. In ponderosa pine forests, surface fuels were similar between prescribed fires and low severity resource benefit fires. However, resource benefit fires significantly reduced basal area, resulting in lower <b>loading</b> of <b>canopy</b> fuels and crown fire potential. Additionally, effects of resource benefit fire on stand structure and fuels seem to be sustained in areas that burned in two or three resource benefit fires in the last century. In pinyon-juniper woodlands, resource benefit low severity fires had no effect on surface or <b>canopy</b> fuel <b>loads.</b> Moderate severity resource benefit fires, on the other hand, did significantly reduce surface and <b>canopy</b> fuel <b>loads.</b> Results from this study are pertinent to fire and fuels managers throughout the southwestern United States who utilize prescribed {{and resource}} benefit fire to reduce fuel loads and restore historical forest conditions.|$|R
30|$|Fuel {{treatments}} in {{forests are}} often designed to decrease crown fire behavior (i.e., propensity for crown fire ignition or spread) by reducing canopy and surface fuels, and increase {{resistance to fire}} (i.e, overstory survival) by favoring fire-tolerant species and removing competition. Fire exclusion and canopy ingrowth {{over the past century}} have elevated surface and <b>canopy</b> fuel <b>loading</b> in the western US (Parsons and DeBenedetti 1979, Covington and Moore 1994, Keeling et al. 2006). Increased surface and <b>canopy</b> fuel <b>loading</b> in conjunction with a warmer and drier climate have caused wildfires to increase in size and frequency, resulting in greater suppression costs to protect resources (Westerling et al. 2006, Flannigan et al. 2009, Miller et al. 2009). Crown fires threaten human safety and property, and, in forest types where crown fire is uncharacteristic, it also threatens ecological resilience (Savage and Nystrom Mast 2005). Fuel reduction is a proactive silvicultural treatment that alters potential fire behavior by removing and modifying fuels to encourage low-severity (low overstory mortality) surface fire instead of high-severity (high overstory mortality) crown fire. Fuel treatments are typically designed to reduce surface fuel <b>loading</b> and <b>canopy</b> densities; increase heights to canopy base; and retain large, fire resistant trees (Agee and Skinner 2005, Hessburg et al. 2015). Although these goals can be attained with various silvicultural techniques, thinning and burning are the most typical means of fuel reduction. The relative effectiveness of thinning and burning to reduce crown fire behavior has been thoroughly studied immediately after treatment (Stephens and Moghaddas 2005, Harrington et al. 2007, Stephens et al. 2009, Fulé et al. 2012, McIver et al. 2012), generally highlighting that burning reduces surface fuels, thinning improves forest structure, and the combination of the two best reduces crown fire potential.|$|R
30|$|We {{evaluated}} {{differences in}} surface and canopy fuel characteristics and potential fire behavior metrics between fuel reduction treatments (no-action or control, burn-only, thin-only, thin+burn) implemented in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Lawson & C. Lawson)−Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii [Mirb.] Franco)-dominated forests that were subsequently {{affected by a}} mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) outbreak after treatment. Experimental units were measured in 2002 (immediately following fuel treatment) and in 2016 (14  years after treatment and at least 4  years following a beetle outbreak). We found that beetle-altered thinning treatments (thin-only and thin+burn combined) had less fuel (i.e., 34 % and 83 % lower fine and coarse woody debris loading, respectively) and lower crown fire potential (i.e., 47 % lower probability of torching and 42 % greater crowning index) than corresponding unthinned treatments (control and burn-only). There was no post-beetle-outbreak effect of burning treatments (burn-only and thin+burn combined) on surface fuel loading, but burning reduced crown fire potential (i.e., 37 % greater crowning index) over unburned units (control and thin-only) 14  years after treatment. Additionally, we determined the relative impacts of fuel treatments and the bark beetle outbreak on fuel and crown fire potential differences and found that bark beetle-caused tree mortality inflated differences between controls and thinned treatments (thin-only and thin+burn) for surface fuel loading and probability of torching, but diminished differences between these treatments for <b>canopy</b> fuel <b>loading,</b> <b>canopy</b> bulk density, and crowning index.|$|R
30|$|However, fuel {{treatments}} are only temporarily effective (Reinhardt et al. 2008, Martinson and Omi 2013). As treated areas age, regeneration, ingrowth, and residual trees grow into {{open space and}} increase surface and <b>canopy</b> fuel <b>loading,</b> causing concomitant increases in crown fire potential (Keyes and O’Hara 2002, Keyes and Varner 2006, Affleck et al. 2012). Although stimulated growth and regeneration are expected to follow treatment because of release from competition, it is still unclear how long treatments remain effective. Studies have identified that fuel treatments may be effective for a decade following treatment (Finney et al. 2005, Fernandes 2009, Jain et al. 2012, Stephens et al. 2012), but evidence beyond a decade is scant (though simulated by Tinkham et al. 2016).

An allometric approach to estimating these canopy fuel characteristics was useful, but, for accuracy, estimates of vertical biomass distribution and site-adjustment factors were required.

40|$|A {{detailed}} study of canopy fuel characteristics in five different forest types provided a unique dataset for simulating the effects of various stand manipulation treatments on canopy fuels. Low thinning, low thinning with commercial dbh limit, and crown thinning had similar effects on canopy bulk density (CBD) and <b>canopy</b> fuel <b>load</b> (CFL), but only the strict low thinning significantly affected canopy base height (CBH). In four of five sampled stands, CBD and CFL responded linearly to increasing treatment intensity in those three thinning treatments. The ponderosa-pine/Douglas-fir stand, with its significant understory component, showed little change in CBD with the commercial limit and crown thinning treatments. The diameterlimit harvest exhibited little consistency among sites and, hence, {{it is not a}} good silvicultural tool for creating canopy fuel reduction prescriptions. Due to fire-induced mortality, crown scorch (from prescribed fire) was more effective than mechanical pruning (to an equivalent height) at modifying canopy fuel characteristics. At achievable scorch and pruning heights, neither treatment had a significant effect on CBD or CFL...|$|R
30|$|Several {{estimates}} of canopy fuels {{are needed to}} predict crown fire potential, including <b>canopy</b> fuel <b>load</b> (CFL), <b>canopy</b> bulk density (CBD), and CBH. Multiple methods are available for estimating such metrics and no one method has yet gained wide acceptance.

Also, stand-level regression equations developed by Cruz et al. (2003) are easy to use and have been widely applied. Both methods can result in dramatically different {{estimates of}} canopy fuels and, thus, crown fire behavior prediction. Allometric equations generally result in more accurate assessments of canopy fuel characteristics (Reinhardt et al. 2006). While stand-level equations developed by Cruz et al. (2003) seem to overpredict canopy fuel characteristics, they can lead to more realistic predictions in crown fire behavior models (Roccaforte et al. 2008). Thus, {{there is good reason to}} examine multiple methods of estimating canopy fuels for the purpose of evaluating potential fire behavior.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—We {{compared}} the {{accuracy and precision}} of digital hemispherical photog-raphy and the LI-COR LAI- 2000 plant canopy analyzer as predictors of canopy fuels. We collected data on 12 plots in western Montana {{under a variety of}} lighting and sky conditions, and used a variety of processing methods to compute estimates. Repeated measurements from each method displayed considerable variability, but hemispherical photography proved to be the more precise method. To evaluate the accuracy of the different methods, we correlated measurements with allometrically derived estimates of canopy bulk density and available canopy fuel. Measurements from both methods were more highly correlated with available canopy fuel than canopy bulk density. Hemispherical photography emerged as the superior methodology, displaying greater precision and accuracy, at least when measurements must be collected under sub-par lighting conditions. In order to assess the potential risk of crown fi res, accurate estimates of <b>canopy</b> fuel <b>loads</b> are needed. Direct met hods for measuring these loads are often diffi cult and time consuming, involving destructive sampling of th...|$|R
30|$|To intercompare {{fuel loading}} maps, we {{prepared}} vegetation maps for each fuel loading data source. Additional maps were created for each fuel strata (total fuel loading, surface fuel <b>loading,</b> <b>canopy,</b> shrubs, herbaceous, woody fuels, duff, and litter) {{and for each}} of the fuel loading maps. We calculated summary fuel loading statistics (minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, maximum) in megagrams per hectare for each fuel map, and calculated relative differences (with FCCS 2 1 km set as the reference map for coarse scale fuel loading maps and FCCS 2 30 m serving as the reference map for fine scale fuel loading maps) to identify potential variability across the landscape by data source.|$|R
30|$|Canopy base height, canopy bulk density, and <b>canopy</b> fuel <b>loading</b> were {{calculated}} using Canopy Fuels Inventory Processor (CFIP) (Larry Wilson; Larkspur, California; unpublished report). The CFIP is a vegetation simulation program {{largely based on}} the algorithms used in the Forest Vegetation Simulator (Crookston and Stage 1991) and the Fire and Fuels Extension (Reinhardt and Crookston 2003). The processor incorporates a post-treatment reduction in canopy bulk density and canopy base height for hardwoods and select conifers in California. To represent changes in canopy bulk density and canopy base height post-treatment, the fraction of crown length removed was multiplied by the average crown mass (Noonan-Wright et al. 2006). This reduced crown mass value was then applied to the vertical distribution for calculations of canopy base height and canopy bulk density for each plot. Otherwise, for hardwoods such as black oak, and conifers such as red fir and white fir, measured changes in individual tree crown base height {{would have resulted in}} higher values of crown bulk density, post-treatment. Surface and ground fuel loads {{were calculated}} using Brown et al. (1984) with coefficients specific to California tree species (van Wagtendonk et al. 1996).|$|R
40|$|Application of {{crown fire}} {{behavior}} models in fire management decision-making {{have been limited}} by the difficulty of quantitatively describing fuel complexes, specifically characteristics for the canopy fuel stratum. To estimate canopy fuel stratum characteristics of four broad fuel types found in the western United States and adjacent areas of Canada, namely Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, mixed conifer, and lodgepole pine forest stands, data from the USDA Forest Service 2 ̆ 7 s Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) Database were analysed and linked with tree-level foliage dry weight equations. Models to predict canopy base height (CBH), <b>canopy</b> fuel <b>load</b> (CFL) and <b>canopy</b> bulk density (CBD) were developed through linear regression analysis and using common stand descriptors (e. g. stand density, basal area, stand height) as explanatory variables. The models developed were fuel type specific and coefficients of determination ranged from 0. 90 to 0. 95 for CFL, between 0. 84 and 0. 92 for CBD and from 0. 64 to 0. 88 for CBH. Although not formally evaluated, the models seem to give a reasonable characterization of the canopy fuel stratum for use in fire management applications...|$|R
40|$|High {{elevation}} five needle pines {{are rapidly}} declining throughout western North America due to warming temperatures, mountain pine beetle, white pine blister rust, and alteration of the naturally occurring fire regime. The impact {{of climate change}} is especially acute in sky islands of the Great Basin as warming temperatures alter tree distribution and contribute to overstory tree mortality. Great Basin bristlecone pine forests occur as ecological islands at the highest elevations of mountain ranges separated by extensive rangeland or desert basins. Great Basin bristlecone pine ecosystems are highly fragmented and contain many biodiversity “hot spots” {{with a high degree}} of species endemism. It is the fragmentation history and the number and character of the sky islands that are key to understanding biodiversity of Great Basin bristlecone pine forests. This paper will address the effects of climate change on Great Basin bristlecone pine forests. Specifically we will discuss climate-induced changes to the fire regime through alteration of surface and <b>canopy</b> fuel <b>loading,</b> fire hazard and risk, and on predicted changes in fire behavior and severity. Secondly we will evaluate Great Basin bristlecone pine volatile organic compounds across elevation gradients to assess changes in tree biochemistry in response to climatic stress...|$|R

To meet this challenge, robust analysis tools are needed to estimate <b>canopy</b> stresses and <b>loads</b> in the <b>canopy</b> reinforcement. In this study, structural analysis of the MSL parachute system is performed using two finite element codes. The {{purpose of this study}} is threefold. First, the study evaluates the effect of fabric anisotropy on the predicted stress distribution in the canopy. Second, the effect of various design changes on canopy stress distribution is examined. Finally, the study provides a comparison of the stresses predicted by the two different finite element codes used for the analysis. I...|$|R
50|$|Upon {{its opening}} the station {{consisted}} of a single platform 100 yd in length, a run-around loop, a siding leading down to a fish shed and platform by the harbour where fish consignments were loaded, and a small goods shed on the Down side with <b>canopies</b> over the <b>loading</b> points on each side. The station incorporated the stationmaster's residence and was constructed of local stone. A platform canopy decorated with saw-tooth valancing was also added. Finally, a stone 18-lever signal box was situated near the platform. The first changes occurred in 1900 when a turntable was installed. Around 1910 a carriage siding was added to next to the run-round loop, followed by {{the construction of the}} South Jetty served by two long sidings.|$|R
40|$|Snowfall {{interception}} {{is particularly}} important to the hydrology of forested cold regions. Unloading of intercepted snow controls the snow available for interception loss due to sublimation from that held in the canopy. This thesis seeks to determine the factors that affect the magnitude and timing of unloading at the forest-stand scale. A field program was established that measured interception and unloading at a forest-stand scale using a series of hanging lysimeters and a 7 m tall spruce tree suspended, in-situ, on a load-cell. Meteorological conditions including snowfall, wind speed, air temperature, and incoming radiation were recorded {{above and below the}} forest canopy. Unloading did not behave as described by current unloading models. It was observed to be triggered by occurrences of wind gusts or melt conditions within the canopy but no trends were found in the measurements {{that could be used to}} predict the onset of unloading from gusts or air temperature alone. An association between intercepted snow sublimation and unloading was found and this relationship was further found to be an exponential function of air temperature. An expression based on this empirical model can be used to calculate unloading as a function of sublimation rate in hydrological models or to calculate unloading directly as a function of <b>canopy</b> snow <b>load</b> and air temperature...|$|R
40|$|Understanding fire {{behavior}} characteristics {{and planning for}} fire management require maps showing the distribution of wildfire fuel loads at medium to fine spatial resolution across large landscapes. Radar sensors from airborne or spaceborne platforms have the potential of providing quantitative information about the forest structure and biomass components that can be readily translated to meaningful fuel load estimates for fire management. In this paper, we used multifrequency polarimetric synthetic aperture radar imagery acquired over a large area of the Yellowstone National Park (YNP) by the AIRSAR sensor, to estimate the distribution of forest biomass and <b>canopy</b> fuel <b>loads.</b> Semi-empirical algorithms were developed to estimate crown and stem biomass and three major fuel <b>load</b> parameters, <b>canopy</b> fuel weight, canopy bulk density, and foliage moisture content. These estimates when compared directly to measurements made at plot and stand levels, provided more than 70 % accuracy, and when partitioned into fuel load classes, provided more than 85 % accuracy. Specifically, the radar generated fuel parameters were in good agreement with the field-based fuel measurements, resulting in coefficients of determination of R(sup 2) = 85 for the canopy fuel weight, R(sup 2) =. 84 for canopy bulk density and R(sup 2) = 0. 78 for the foliage biomass...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{framework}} for on-board trajectory planning and guidance for a large class of autonomously guided parafoils. The problem is for the parafoil to reach a given location at a specified altitude with a specified final heading. Through appropriate change of the independent variable, the trajectory planning problem is converted from a three-dimensional free-final time problem to a two-dimensional fixed-final time problem. Using the well-known Dubins path synthesis and known parafoil performance parameters a concept of altitude margin is developed as a quantitative measure of the available maneuvering energy for use in trajectory planning. A hybrid strategy using two methods to generate kinematically feasible fixed-time trajectories is presented, each targeting different range of initial values of the altitude margin. The trajectory can be re-planned on-board in every guidance cycle, making the guidance effectively closed loop, or re-planned whenever the deviation of the actual condition from the reference trajectory exceeds a threshold. The proposed planning and guidance algorithm applies to a large class of parafoil canopies and payloads which encompasses wide variations in the lift-to-drag ratio, wing loading, and maximum turn rate. The guidance logic requires no tuning to accommodate variations in canopy performance. Monte Carlo simulations are conducted {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of the algorithm with dispersions in <b>canopy</b> performance, <b>loading,</b> wind profile errors, navigation uncertainty, using lateral control only and with both longitudinal and lateral control...|$|R
