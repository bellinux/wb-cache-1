40|$|The 21 st {{century has}} seen a {{paradigm}} shift to inhaled therapy, for both systemic and local drug delivery, due to the lung's favourable properties of a large surface area and high permeability. Pulmonary drug delivery possesses many advantages, including non-invasive route of administration, low metabolic activity, control environment for systemic absorption and avoids first bypass metabolism. However, because the lung {{is one of the}} major ports of entry, it has multiple <b>clearance</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> which prevent foreign particles from entering the body. Although these <b>clearance</b> <b>mechanisms</b> maintain the sterility of the lung, <b>clearance</b> <b>mechanisms</b> can also act as barriers to the therapeutic effectiveness of inhaled drugs. This effectiveness is also influenced by the deposition site and delivered dose. Particulate-based drug delivery systems have emerged as an innovative and promising alternative to conventional inhaled drugs to circumvent pulmonary <b>clearance</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and provide enhanced therapeutic efficiency and controlled drug release. The principle of multiple pulmonary <b>clearance</b> <b>mechanisms</b> is reviewed, including mucociliary, alveolar macrophages, absorptive, and metabolic degradation. This review also discusses the current approaches and formulations developed to achieve optimal pulmonary drug delivery systems...|$|R

50|$|Inhaled {{asbestos}} fibres enter {{the upper and}} lower respiratory tracts when asbestos is released into the air. Some of the inhaled fibers are cleared by the mucociliary <b>clearance</b> <b>mechanism</b> but long thin asbestos fibers may reach the lower airways and alveoli, and can be retained in the lungs for many years. Amphibole fibers are not cleared as effectively as serpentines and therefore accumulate more readily in the distal lung parenchyma. Asbestos fibres are recognised by the lungs as foreign bodies and cause the activation of the lung’s local immune system leading to inflammation, cell and tissue damage. In the long term, this can lead to fibrosis, or rarely to malignancy. From the lungs, some {{asbestos fibres}} (mainly short fibres) can also migrate to pleural and peritoneal spaces.|$|E

40|$|Peripheral taste {{receptor}} cells {{depend on}} distinct calcium signals to generate appropriate cellular responses that relay taste {{information to the}} central nervous system. Some taste cells have conventional chemical synapses and rely on calcium influx through voltage-gated calcium channels. Other taste cells lack these synapses and depend on calcium release from stores to formulate an output signal through a hemichannel. Despite the importance of calcium signaling in taste cells, {{little is known about}} how these signals are regulated. This review summarizes recent studies that have identified 2 calcium <b>clearance</b> <b>mechanisms</b> expressed in taste cells, including mitochondrial calcium uptake and sodium/calcium exchangers (NCXs).

40|$|Cell wall {{impermeability}} {{is a major}} {{determinant of}} the susceptibility of gram-negative bacilli to ~-lactam antibiotics. The outer membrane, which ~-lactam agents cross via pores composed of porin proteins, is the major individual barrier in the wall structure but does not of itself exclude these antibiotics. Rather, it slows their influx to a levelthat the periplas-mic <b>clearance</b> <b>mechanisms</b> may manage to contain.

40|$|Platelets for {{transfusion}} {{are stored}} {{at room temperature}} because refrigerated platelets are cleared rapidly from circulation. Room temperature storage causes major inconveniences for blood banks and medical risks for recipients. To address this clinically important problem a macrophage-dependent <b>clearance</b> <b>mechanism</b> was defined for platelets refrigerated 48 h (Paper 1). To investigate this different outcome we developed a mouse model for studies of storage of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) at 4 °C for 48 h. In vitro characterization of the 4 °C stored mouse platelets showed similar changes as measured on human platelets after 48 h of refrigeration. Importantly, using the mouse model we demonstrated that galactosylation {{has no effect on}} the survival of > 48 h long-term refrigerated mouse platelets (Paper 1). Using the mouse platelet storage model we dissected the <b>clearance</b> <b>mechanism</b> of platelets stored for > 48 h in plasma at 4 ºC, showing that 48 h refrigerated platelets are removed by an additional macrophage-independent mechanism, i. e. by the hepatic galactose-dependent lectin the Ashwell-Morell Receptor (AMR) (Paper 2). This conclusion was based on the following evidence: (a) macrophage depletion in mice dramatically improved the circulation of 4 h chilled platelets, but not clearance of 48 h refrigerated platelets; (b) streptavidin-POD staining revealed the localization of long-term refrigerated biotinylated platelets in hepatocytes; (c) 48 h refrigeration tremendously increased the binding of the βgalactose-recognizing lectin RCA-I to platelets; (d) KO mice lacking Asgpr- 1 or Asgpr- 2 subunits of the AMR supported 48 h refrigerated platelet circulation; (e) co-injection of asialofetuin, a competitive inhibitor of the AMR, restored the survival of 48 h refrigerated platelets but not of isolated platelets stored for < 4 h; (f) ingestion of fluorescently labeled long-term refrigerated platelets in a hepatocyte culture was prevented by asialofetuin. Circulation of 48 h platelets was markedly improved by removal of the N-terminal domain of GPIbα using O-sialopeptidase (Paper 2). Platelets from mice lacking the sialyltransferase ST 3 GalIV were used to investigate the increased clearance of platelets with decreased sialylation. We demonstrated that platelets with increased galactose exposure {{due to the lack of}} ST 3 GalIV expression are also removed by a macrophage-independent mechanism, through AMRs on hepatocytes (Paper 3). In conclusion, our results defined a new hepatic-based <b>clearance</b> <b>mechanism</b> for desialylated platelets, representing the first example of blood cell removal by a non-myeloid cell...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{respiratory}} system is constantly exposed to particulate matter {{suspended in the}} inhaled air and one among the efficient mechanisms to trap and expel the particulate substances is the nasal and bronchial mucociliary <b>clearance</b> <b>mechanism.</b> This mucociliary <b>clearance</b> <b>mechanism</b> is influenced by both physiological and pathological factors that alter {{the functioning of the}} respiratory cilia and the overlying mucosal layer that traps the particulate agents. As Body mass index (BMI) determines the health of a person by influencing various physiological parameters, this study has been planned to study the effect of normal and abnormal BMI (overweight and obese range) on the nasal mucociliary clearance (NMC). Aim: To evaluate the effect of BMI on nasal mucociliary clearance (NMC). Materials & Methods: NMC was measured in 20 volunteers with normal BMI (18. 5 - 22. 9 Kg/m 2) and 20 volunteers with BMI in overweight and obese range (23 Kg/m 2 and above). The NMC time was recorded by the time the volunteers appreciated the sweet taste following the placement of ¼ of saccharin tablet (1 mm x 1 mm) in the nostril referred as saccharin transit time (STT). Results: NMC was found to be prolonged in overweight and obese population and BMI has positive correlation with NMC as calculated by Pearson correlation with r value of 0. 591 and p value 0. 001 which is statistically significant. Conclusion: NMC time is prolonged in abnormal BMI referring to the impairment in the mucociliary escalator mechanism thus predisposing to disease states...|$|E
30|$|Frequently, {{non-linear}} PK of mAbs may {{be explained}} by target mediated disposition (TMD). TMD is a saturable process and it is characterized by decreasing clearance with increasing doses. On the contrary, clearance of unconjugated anti-CD 74 appeared to be higher when higher doses were administered. In addition, since this anti-CD 74 antibody does not recognize the murine target receptor, its PK was not expected to reflect TMD. Here, observed increases in clearance at higher doses are consistent with the presence of a low affinity, high capacity off-target antibody sink (i.e., a non-specific <b>clearance</b> <b>mechanism).</b> This is, in general, an undesirable property for a targeting antibody that is characterized for its specificity and extended systemic half-life.|$|E
