5|$|Chadwick's Clerk-Maxwell studentship {{expired in}} 1923, {{and he was}} succeeded by the Russian {{physicist}} Pyotr Kapitza. The Chairman of the Advisory Council of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, Sir William McCormick arranged for <b>Chadwick</b> to become Rutherford's assistant director of research. In this role, <b>Chadwick</b> helped Rutherford select PhD students. Over {{the next few years}} these would include John Cockcroft, Norman Feather and Mark Oliphant, who would become firm friends with <b>Chadwick.</b> As many students had no idea what they wanted to research, Rutherford and <b>Chadwick</b> would suggest topics. <b>Chadwick</b> edited all the papers produced by the laboratory.|$|E
5|$|After the war, <b>Chadwick</b> {{followed}} Rutherford to the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge, where <b>Chadwick</b> {{earned his}} Doctor of Philosophy degree under Rutherford's supervision from Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, in June 1921. He was Rutherford's {{assistant director of}} research at the Cavendish Laboratory for over a decade at a time when it was one of the world's foremost centres for the study of physics, attracting students like John Cockcroft, Norman Feather, and Mark Oliphant. <b>Chadwick</b> followed his discovery of the neutron by measuring its mass. He anticipated that neutrons would become a major weapon in the fight against cancer. <b>Chadwick</b> left the Cavendish Laboratory in 1935 to become a professor of physics at the University of Liverpool, where he overhauled an antiquated laboratory and, by installing a cyclotron, made it an important centre for the study of nuclear physics.|$|E

5000|$|Newspapers had {{previously}} tallied runs scored, but <b>Chadwick's</b> 1859 box score looked similar in structure to modern ones. Baseball researcher Bill James credits <b>Chadwick's</b> {{creation of the}} box score with {{his interest in the}} game, but he criticized <b>Chadwick's</b> omission of the walk from calculation of a player's batting average: [...] ""What they failed to understand is that actually the batter has as much or a little more to do with when the walk occurs as the pitcher does. They ignored that element of it and that did distort the game for a lot of people." [...] The box score was popularized in 1925 when Baseball Magazine republished <b>Chadwick's</b> 1859 Clipper article.|$|R

5|$|<b>Chadwick</b> did {{not believe}} that there was any {{likelihood}} of another war with Germany in 1939, and took his family for a holiday on a remote lake in northern Sweden. The news of the outbreak of the Second World War therefore came as a shock. Determined not to spend another war in an internment camp, <b>Chadwick</b> made his way to Stockholm as fast as he could, but when he arrived there with his family, he found that all air traffic between Stockholm and London had been suspended. They made their way back to England on a tramp steamer. When he reached Liverpool, <b>Chadwick</b> found Joseph Rotblat, a Polish post-doctoral fellow who had come to work with the cyclotron, was now destitute, as he was cut off from funds from Poland. <b>Chadwick</b> promptly hired Rotblat as a lecturer, despite his poor grasp of English.|$|E

5|$|At Liverpool the Medicine and Science faculties worked {{together}} closely. <b>Chadwick</b> was automatically a committee member of both faculties, and in 1938 {{he was appointed}} to a commission headed by Lord Derby to investigate the arrangements for cancer treatment in Liverpool. <b>Chadwick</b> anticipated that neutrons and radioactive isotopes produced with the 37-inch cyclotron {{could be used to}} study biochemical processes, and might become a weapon in the fight against cancer.|$|E

5|$|By March 1943 Conant {{decided that}} British help would benefit {{some areas of}} the project. In particular, the Manhattan Project could benefit enough from {{assistance}} from James <b>Chadwick,</b> the discoverer of the neutron, and one or two other British scientists to warrant the risk of revealing weapon design secrets. Bush, Conant and Groves wanted <b>Chadwick</b> and Peierls to discuss bomb design with Robert Oppenheimer, and Kellogg still wanted British comments on the design of the gaseous diffusion plant.|$|E
5|$|<b>Chadwick</b> {{accepted}} that the Americans {{did not need}} British help, but that it could still be useful in bringing the project to an early and successful conclusion. Working closely with {{the director of the}} Manhattan Project, Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., he attempted to do everything he could to support the effort. He also endeavoured to place British scientists in as many parts of the project as possible in order to facilitate a post-war British nuclear weapons project to which <b>Chadwick</b> was committed. Requests from Groves via <b>Chadwick</b> for particular scientists tended to be met with an immediate rejection by the company, ministry or university currently employing them, only to be overcome by the overriding priority accorded to Tube Alloys. As a result, the British team was critical to the Project's success.|$|E
5|$|<b>Chadwick</b> {{was himself}} {{a critic of}} Big Science in general, and Lawrence in particular, whose {{approach}} he considered careless and focused on technology {{at the expense of}} science. When Lawrence postulated the existence of a new and hitherto unknown particle that he claimed was a possible source of limitless energy at the Solvay Conference in 1933, <b>Chadwick</b> responded that the results were more likely attributable to contamination of the equipment. While Lawrence rechecked his results at Berkeley only to find that <b>Chadwick</b> was correct, Rutherford and Oliphant conducted an investigation at the Cavendish that found that deuterium fuses to form helium-3, thereby causing the effect that the Lawrence had observed. This was another major discovery, but the Oliphant-Rutherford particle accelerator was an expensive state-of-the-art piece of equipment.|$|E

5|$|During the Second World War, <b>Chadwick</b> {{carried out}} {{research}} {{as part of}} the Tube Alloys project to build an atomic bomb, while his Liverpool lab and environs were harassed by Luftwaffe bombing. When the Quebec Agreement merged his project with the American Manhattan Project, he became part of the British Mission, and worked at the Los Alamos Laboratory and in Washington, D.C. He surprised everyone by earning the almost-complete trust of project director Leslie R. Groves, Jr. For his efforts, <b>Chadwick</b> received a knighthood in the New Year Honours on 1 January 1945. In July 1945, he viewed the Trinity nuclear test. After this, he served as the British scientific advisor to the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission. Uncomfortable with the trend toward Big Science, <b>Chadwick</b> became the Master of Gonville and Caius College in 1948. He retired in 1959.|$|E

40|$|To honour the 175 th {{anniversary of}} Edwin <b>Chadwick's</b> seminal ‘Report on the Sanitary Conditions of the Labouring Poor’, we update <b>Chadwick's</b> famous {{analysis}} of geographical differences in occupational based inequalities. Much {{of the field}} of Health Geography owes both its direction of development and its initial impetus to his 1842 report. The report presented evidence for the importance of local context to health, with individuals of the lowest occupations in Rutland living longer than individuals of the highest occupations in Liverpool. Here we update the 1842 analysis using data from the Office of National Statistics on individual mortality records by occupation (2010 - 12) and population data from the 2011 Census. Sex-specific directly standardised premature (16 - 74) mortality rates were calculated for hierarchical occupational categories similar to <b>Chadwick's</b> categories, for the nearest equivalent areas to those used in <b>Chadwick's</b> report. Although there is no longer consistent evidence on individuals in the lowest occupational group having lower mortality rates than those in the highest group, there were clear social gradients in mortality within each area and the extent of these inequalities varied between areas. Individuals who live in Rutland had lower premature mortality rates across each occupational group compared to the other areas. Our results demonstrate that while life expectancy has nearly doubled since <b>Chadwick's</b> report, social and spatial inequalities in health have persisted. We suggest that <b>Chadwick's</b> legacy on the importance of locality continue...|$|R
5|$|In 1941, Frisch {{moved to}} London {{to work with}} <b>Chadwick</b> and his cyclotron. Frisch built a Clusius tube there to study the {{properties}} of uranium hexafluoride. Frisch and <b>Chadwick</b> discovered that {{it is one of}} the gases for which the Clusius method will not work. This was only a minor setback because Simon was already in progress of establishing the alternative method of separation through ordinary gaseous diffusion.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, <b>Chadwick</b> was {{appointed}} Dean of Christ Church, uniquely a dual {{role as a}} cathedral dean and head of a college. This period was not entirely happy; a scholarly ability to see all sides of a question, along with an ingrained desire not to upset his colleagues, sometimes made it {{hard for him to}} make a quick or firm decision. However, during his time as Dean the college benefited from a continued programme of renovation with internal changes that provided more student accommodation. The position gave <b>Chadwick</b> the chance to influence the musical direction of the cathedral. In The Independent newspaper, obituary writer Andrew Louth notes that at the retirement of Sydney Watson as organist, when he and <b>Chadwick</b> played piano duets together Chadwick's technique was the equal of Watson's. The new organist, Simon Preston, had ambitious plans for improving musical standards, and <b>Chadwick</b> was pleased to be able to support these, not least by raising funds for a new organ.|$|E
5|$|In March 1935, <b>Chadwick</b> {{received}} {{an offer of}} the Lyon Jones Chair of physics at the University of Liverpool, in his wife's home town, to succeed Lionel Wilberforce.

The university's prestige was soon bolstered by Chadwick's Nobel Prize, which was announced in November 1935. His medal was sold at auction in 2014 for $329,000.|$|E

5|$|Rutherford gave <b>Chadwick</b> a {{part-time}} teaching position at Manchester, {{allowing him to}} continue research.

In April 1919, Rutherford became director of the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge, and <b>Chadwick</b> joined him there a few months later. <b>Chadwick</b> was awarded a Clerk-Maxwell studentship in 1920, and enrolled as a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) student at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. The first half of his thesis was his work with atomic numbers. In the second, he looked at the forces inside the nucleus. His degree was awarded in June 1921.
