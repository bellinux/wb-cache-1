5|$|Arsenal's European Cup defeat to Benfica in October 1991 is {{regarded}} as a watershed moment in Graham's managerial career. He altered his tactics and built a stubborn team, which lacked the creativity associated with the first half of his Arsenal reign. Graham's Arsenal struggled to put together a title <b>challenge</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> newly-formed Premier League, but were cup specialists in the early half of the nineties. In 1992–93, Graham became the first manager to win the FA Cup and League Cup in the same season. A season later, he guided Arsenal to their first European trophy for almost a quarter of a century, as the team won the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup.|$|E
5|$|Australia's biggest <b>challenge</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> post-Test tour matches {{was against}} the Leveson-Gower's XI, named after H. D. G. Leveson-Gower.

After his demands were met, Bradman named a full-strength team. After the tourists dismissed the home team for 177, Morris made 62 in a 102-run opening stand with Barnes before Yardley bowled him.

5|$|Despite {{its initial}} plausibility, the {{identity}} theory faces a strong <b>challenge</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{form of the}} thesis of multiple realizability, first formulated by Hilary Putnam. It is obvious that not only humans, but many different species of animals can, for example, experience pain. However, it seems highly unlikely {{that all of these}} diverse organisms with the same pain experience are in the identical brain state. And if this is the case, then pain cannot be identical to a specific brain state. The identity theory is thus empirically unfounded.|$|E
