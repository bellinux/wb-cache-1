40|$|Although {{religious}} <b>congregations</b> <b>in</b> the United States {{constitute a}} significant part of the nation 2 ̆ 7 s safety net (Cnaan, Boddie, and Weinburg, 1999), questions still remain: are religious <b>congregations</b> <b>in</b> the United States unique in their involvement in social service provision? To answer this question, we need to compare them with <b>congregations</b> <b>in</b> countries similar to the United States. Congregational social and community involvement in the United States is attributed to several factors: the unique separation of state and church, a pluralistic ethnic society, and the market economy of religion in the United States. If these factors explain the impressive involvement of local religious <b>congregations</b> <b>in</b> helping people in need and in enhancing quality of life in the community, then we should expect similar findings regarding <b>congregations</b> <b>in</b> other countries with similar characteristics...|$|R
