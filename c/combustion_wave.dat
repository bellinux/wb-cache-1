The engine has a spinning disk with curved blades. Once fuel and air enter the engine, the rotation of the disk creates shockwaves that compress the mixture. When ignited, the burning mixture expands, pushing against the blades, causing them to spin. The spinning of the disk itself opens and closes intake and exhaust ports.

40|$|In this thesis, we {{investigate}} the properties and linear stability of homogeneous premixed planar propagating <b>combustion</b> <b>waves</b> in one spatial dimension. In particular, {{we investigate}} travelling premixed <b>combustion</b> <b>waves</b> in a diffusional-thermal {{model with a}} two-step competitive exothermic reaction mechanism in which both reactions are exothermic and the same reactive material provides the feed for both exothermic reactive steps. Such reactions have direct relevance to the combustion of MeCH₂, where Me is either titanium or zirconium. <b>Combustion</b> <b>waves</b> in two-step competitive exothermic-reaction schemes are investigated for various fuel types, including gaseous, porous and solid fuels, under both adiabatic and nonadiabatic conditions. In addition, the Evans Function Method is employed to analyze the linear stability of the <b>combustion</b> <b>waves.</b> The {{purpose of the study}} is to investigate how the properties of the <b>combustion</b> <b>waves</b> vary as various parameter values change. Of particular interest are those parameters describing the ratios of the activation energies, pre-exponential factors and enthalpies of the two reactions, the Lewis number of the reactants, the heat-loss parameter and ambient temperature. As well as the transitions from stable to unstable planar wave solutions, various bifurcations are analyzed. The properties and linear stability of the travelling-wave solutions from two-step competitive exothermic reactions are more complicated that those from single-step exothermic reaction; in particular, regions of bi-stability exist: different solutions coexist for the same parameter values. When bi-stability does not exist, the behaviour of the <b>combustion</b> <b>waves</b> is similar to that from the single-step reaction. When bistability does exist, two stable branches, a fast branch with fast flame speeds and a slow branch with slow flame speeds, can co-exist. The transitions between the fast and slow branches are observed by altering the fuel temperature profiles. The steady travelling waves become unstable due to the existence of Hopf bifurcations and there are three possible scenarios. The conditions of the existence of bi-stability are discussed...|$|R

The results indicate that travelling <b>combustion</b> <b>waves</b> whose reaction is turned off because the solid temperature becomes too low are always unstable, whereas travelling waves whose reaction is turned off due to depletion of solid reactant can be stable.

40|$|This study investigates {{peculiarities of}} the {{filtration}} combustion (FC) of the gaseous fuel-air mixtures in a porous inertia media (PIM). <b>Combustion</b> <b>wave</b> velocities and temperatures were measured for hydrogen-air, propane-air and methane-air mixtures in the PIM at different mixture filtration velocities. It is {{shown that the}} dependences of the <b>combustion</b> <b>wave</b> velocities on the equivalence ratio are V-shaped, It was further confirmed that the FC in the PIM has more contrasts than similarities with the normal homogeneous combustion. One of the interesting observations in the present study, which is not common in normal homogenous combustion, is the shifting of the fuel-air equivalent ratio at the minimum <b>combustion</b> <b>wave</b> velocity from the stoichiometric condition (¢ = 1). For a hydrogen-air mixture, the fuel-air equivalence ratio at the minimum combustion velocity shifts from the stoichiometric condition to the rich region, while for the propane-air and methane-air mixtures the fuel-air equivalence ratio at the minimum combustion velocity shifts toward fuel-leaner conditions. The measured maximum porous media temperatures in the combustion waves {{are found to be}} weakly dependent on the mixture filtration velocities.

40|$|There are {{not many}} studies on DDT with no {{obstacles}} and the initiation of DDT {{near the end of}} a closed tube. Therefore in the present study we experimentally investigate the mechanism of the <b>combustion</b> <b>wave</b> transition to a detonation wave when there are no obstacles. In particular, we show that a local explosion near the tube wall is necessary for the initiation of a detonation. Parameters that we varied are the wall configuration, distance between the ignition point and the wall, and initial filling pressure. The combustion waves and the compression waves are visualized using the Schlieren optical system. From the results, we found it is necessary for the <b>combustion</b> <b>wave</b> to reach four walls so that the detonation could be initiated by the local explosion. In the conditions of the present experiment, we exhibited that the local explosion did not occur in the vicinity of a single wall and four orthogonal walls; instead, the local explosion occurred in a situation with five orthogonal walls.

40|$|We use a {{one-dimensional}} {{model to}} present numerical and analytical {{results on the}} propagation of <b>combustion</b> <b>waves,</b> driven by competing exothermic and endothermic chemical reactions in parallel with water evaporation. The research was motivated by the phenomenology of emulsion explosives comprising a mixture of fuel and an ammonium nitrate (AN) -water solution. An extensive programme of computational modelling has covered a range of important physical influences, particularly the water fraction and the ambient pressure, on which the endothermic effect of evaporation is critically dependent. A substantial, and not immediately obvious, influence of the evaporation, through {{its effect on the}} temperature, is on the fraction of the AN consumed, respectively, by the competing exo- and endothermic reactions, which are controlled by differing, temperature-sensitive kinetics.

40|$|The {{combustion}} mode in a steady-flow {{propulsion system}} {{has a strong}} influence on the overall efficiency of the system. To evaluate {{the relative merits of}} different modes, we propose that it is most appropriate to keep the upstream stagnation state fixed and the wave stationary within the combustor. Because of the variable wave speed and upstream stagnation state, the conventional Hugoniot analysis of <b>combustion</b> <b>waves</b> is inappropriate for this purpose. To remedy this situation, we propose a new formulation of the analysis of stationary <b>combustion</b> <b>waves</b> for a fixed initial stagnation state, which we call the stagnation Hugoniot. For a given stagnation enthalpy, we find that stationary detonation waves generate a higher entropy rise than deflagration <b>waves.</b> The <b>combustion</b> process generating the lowest entropy increment is found to be constant-pressure combustion. These results clearly demonstrate that the minimum entropy property of detonations derived from the conventional Hugoniot analysis does not imply superior performance in all propulsion systems. This finding reconciles previous analysis of flowpath performance analysis of detonation-based ramjets with the thermodynamic cycle analysis of detonation-based propulsion systems. We conclude that the thermodynamic analysis of propulsion systems based on stationary detonation waves must be formulated differently than for propagating waves, and the two situations lead to very different results.
