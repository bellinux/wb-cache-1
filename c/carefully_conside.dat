40|$|The {{e-learning}} {{industry is}} predicted by Gartner Group {{to grow to}} $ 33. 4 billion by 2005 indicating a pheno-menal expansion of market size- almost 16 times its current state. The research results reported here {{are based on a}} major study involving over 370 e-learners within a large telecommunications company in Australia. Analysis indicates that staff do not prefer e-learning over its traditional face-to-face counterpart and that this is primarily driven by the perception that the disadvantages outweigh the advantages. This research also ex-plores the effect of demographic characteristics on an individualâ€™s preference for e-learning and finds that each of gender, age, time in the workplace and managerial status has an effect on the way it is perceived. The paper concludes by suggesting that the introduction of e-learning into the corporate environment maybe more difficult than short-term cost savings might suggest. It also suggests that management will need to <b>carefully</b> <b>conside...</b>|$|E

Termed the Electronic ProdHx Cod (EPC), this standM d will serve not only as a next generation Universal ProdWM Cod (UPC), but also as amethod toidOHqq ying components, assembliesand systems.

This network will have a number of important characteristics. First, unlike conventional bar-codxN this system will network physical objects without human intervention or manipulation by automatic machines. Second the network will be seamless. In other wordr it will operate continuously throughout the environment rather than just at the checkout or exit, as with current scanningand Electronic Article Surveillance (EAS) systems. Third the network will be relatively inexpensive. Although it was technically possible to create such a network in the past, new technologies make its practical implementation a reality. Fourth, the network will be ubiquitous, operating in manydLqM se environments [...] from manufacturing plantsand dtswBHBOMw centers to retail establishmentsand homes. Finally, the network willadqH standN d in cooperation with governingbodHNE such as the Uniform Cod Council (UCC), the European Article Number (EAN) Association, the American National StandM d Inst [...] ...|$|E
