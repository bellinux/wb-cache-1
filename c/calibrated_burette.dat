5000|$|A typical {{titration}} {{begins with}} a beaker or Erlenmeyer flask containing a very precise volume of the analyte and {{a small amount of}} indicator (such as phenolphthalein) placed underneath a <b>calibrated</b> <b>burette</b> or chemistry pipetting syringe containing the titrant. Small volumes of the titrant are then added to the analyte and indicator until the indicator changes color in reaction to the titrant saturation threshold, reflecting arrival at the endpoint of the titration. Depending on the endpoint desired, single drops or less than a single drop of the titrant can make the difference between a permanent and temporary change in the indicator. When the endpoint of the reaction is reached, the volume of reactant consumed is measured and used to calculate the concentration of analyte by ...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Today, {{all kinds}} of vehicle engines work with fossil fuels. The limited fossil fuel {{resources}} and {{the negative effects of}} their consumption on the environment have led researchers to focus on clean, renewable and sustainable energy systems. In all of the fuels being considered as an alternativefor gasoline, methanol {{is one of the more}} promising ones and it has experienced major research and development. Methanol can be obtained from many sources, both fossil and renewable; these include coal, natural gas, food industry and municipal waste, wood and agricultural waste. In this study, the effect of using methanol–unleaded gasoline blends on engine performance characteristics has been experimentally investigated. The main objective of the study was to determine engine performance parameters using unleaded gasoline and methanol-unleaded gasoline blends at various engine speeds and loads, and finally achieving an optimal blend of unleaded gasoline and methanol. Materials and Methods: The experimental apparatus consists of an engine test bed with a hydraulic dynamometer which is coupled with a four cylinder, four-stroke, spark ignition engine that is equipped with the carbureted fuel system. The engine has a cylinder bore of 81. 5 mm, a stroke of 82. 5 mm, and a compression ratio of 7. 5 : 1 with maximum power output of 41. 8 kW. The engine speed was monitored continuously by a tachometer, and the engine torque was measured with a hydraulic dynamometer. Fuel consumption was measured by using a <b>calibrated</b> <b>burette</b> (50 cc) and a stopwatch with an accuracy of 0. 01 s. In all tests, the cooling water temperature was kept at 82 ± 3 ˚C. The test room temperature was kept at 29 ± 3 ˚C during performing the tests. The experiments were performed with three replications. The factors in the experiments were four methanol- unleaded gasoline blends (M 0, M 10, M 20 and M 30) and six engine speeds (2000, 2500. 3000, 3500, 4000 and 4500 rpm). Methanol with a purity of 99. 9...|$|E
40|$|The acromegalic state {{often is}} {{accompanied}} by an enlargement of the soft tissues of the body. The {{purpose of the present}} work was to determine whether these tissue changes are accompanied by changes in the content and distribution of water and electrolytes in the body. In this connection the administration of growth hormone was shown to induce an increase in the total body water of normal (1 - 4) and hypophysectomized (5) rats, and of normal dogs and cats (3). Similarly, growth hormone caused a retention of sodium and potassium in normal (6) and diabetic (7) rats, and a retention of sodium, potassium, and chloride in adrenalectomized rats (8). The thiocyanate space in normal and hypophysectomized rats (9) and the plasma volume in dogs (10) increased after injection of growth hormone. The present paper gives the results of measure-ments of the total body water, the extracellular water and the exchangeable sodium in 18 acro-megalic patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS Total body water was calculated from the volume of distribution of antipyrine (11). Total exchangeable sodium was calculated from the apparent volume of dis-tribution of the radioactive sodium isotope Na ' (12). The extracellular water was calculated from the vol-umes of distribution of inulin (13) or thiosulfate (14). In six cases, both of these methods were used to esti-mate the volume of extracellular water. In six cases, no measurement of the extracellular fluid was made. All experiments started at 8 a. m. The patients were not allowed to eat after 8 p. m. the day before the test. Urine was collected the preceding day for the determi-nation of the blank excretion of inulin. The antipyrine was given from a <b>calibrated</b> <b>burette,</b> and venous blood samples were drawn after two, three, four, and five hours. Immediately after the injection of antipyrine the constant infusion of inulin was started. The infusion of inulin was continued for 6 to 7 hours. When simultaneous 1 These studies were aided by grants from the Medica...|$|E
