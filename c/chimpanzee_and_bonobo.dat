25|$|The gene {{showing a}} human-specific {{increase}} in DUF1220 copy number was first {{identified as the}} result of a genome-wide array CGH study of lineage-specific copy number differences between human and great ape species. The study found 134 genes that showed human lineage-specific increases in copy number, one of which, MGC8902 (also known as NBPF15, cDNA IMAGE:843276), encoded 6 DUF1220 domains. DUF1220 protein domains are found almost exclusively in the NBPF gene family (which includes the MGC8902 gene), which was independently identified as a result of the first member of this family being disrupted in an individual with neuroblastoma. It was recently found that the exceptional increase in human DUF1220 copy number was the results of intragenic domain hyper-amplification primarily involving the three-domain unit called the HLS DUF1220 triplet. Hyper-amplification of the triplet resulted in the addition of ~149 copies of DUF1220 specifically to the human lineage since its divergence from the Pan species, <b>chimpanzee</b> <b>and</b> <b>bonobo,</b> approximately 6 million years ago. The ancestral DUF1220 domain is not part of the NBPF family but rather is found as a single copy within the PDE4DIP (Myomegalin) gene. PDE4DIP encodes a centrosomal protein and is a homolog of CDK5RAP2, a gene that lacks DUF1220 sequences and, when mutated, has been implicated in microcephaly.|$|E

30|$|The {{leaves were}} {{evacuated}} intact. It {{is clear that}} the civets obtained very little, if any, nutritional or energetic benefit from this type of ingestive behavior. Ingesting grass leaves by the Chinese lesser civet may function to remove Toxocara worms, which live in the intestinal lumen and share several life history traits in common with Oesophagostomum, another nematode species (Anderson 2000; Holland and Smith 2006) closely associated with leaf swallowing in <b>chimpanzee</b> <b>and</b> <b>bonobo</b> populations across Africa (Huffman 1997, 2010; Dupain et al. 2002; Fowler et al. 2007; McLennan and Huffman 2012).

40|$|Malaria parasites, though {{widespread}} among wild chimpanzees and gorillas, {{have not}} been detected in bonobos.

TL 2 bonobos harbour P. gaboni, formerly only found in chimpanzees, {{as well as a}} potential new species, Plasmodium lomamiensis sp. nov. Rare co-infections with non-Laverania parasites were also observed. Phylogenetic relationships among Laverania species are consistent with co-divergence with their gorilla, <b>chimpanzee</b> <b>and</b> <b>bonobo</b> hosts, suggesting a timescale for their evolution. The absence of Plasmodium from most field sites could not be explained by parasite seasonality, nor by bonobo population structure, diet or gut microbiota. Thus, the geographic restriction of bonobo Plasmodium reflects still unidentified factors that likely influence parasite transmission...|$|E
40|$|Chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, are {{the most}} {{sophisticated}} tool-users among all nonhumanprimates.

However, {{only a small number of}} bonobo groups have been studied in the wild and only over comparably short periods. Here, we show that captive bonobos and chimpanzees are equally diverse tool-users in most contexts. Our observations illustrate that tool use in bonobos can be highly complex and no different from what has been described for chimpanzees. The only major difference in the <b>chimpanzee</b> <b>and</b> <b>bonobo</b> data was that bonobos of all age-sex classes used tools in a play context, a possible manifestation of their neotenous nature. We also found that female bonobos displayed a larger range of tool use behaviours than males, a pattern previously described for chimpanzees but not for other great apes. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that the female-biased tool use evolved prior to the split between bonobos and chimpanzees...|$|E
40|$|Our two closest living primate relatives, {{chimpanzees}} (Pan troglodytes) and bonobos (Pan paniscus), exhibit significant behavioral differences despite {{belonging to}} the same genus and sharing a very recent common ancestor.

However, the neurobiological basis of these differences has only been minimally investigated and remains uncertain. Here, we present the first ever comparison of <b>chimpanzee</b> <b>and</b> <b>bonobo</b> brains using diffusion tensor imaging, supplemented with a voxel-wise analysis of T 1 -weighted images to specifically compare neural circuitry implicated in social cognition. We find that bonobos have more gray matter in brain regions involved in perceiving distress in both oneself and others, including the right dorsal amygdala and right anterior insula. Bonobos also have a larger pathway linking the amygdala with the ventral anterior cingulate cortex, a pathway implicated in both top-down control of aggressive impulses as well as bottom-up biases against harming others. We suggest that this neural system not only supports increased empathic sensitivity in bonobos, but also behaviors like sex and play that serve to dissipate tension, thereby limiting distress and anxiety to levels conducive with prosocial behavior...|$|E

40|$|Humans are a gregarious species, {{with close}} {{bisexual}} bonds. Human’s closest living relatives, <b>chimpanzees</b> (Pan troglodytes) <b>and</b> <b>bonobos</b> (Pan paniscus), show different social systems. In <b>chimpanzees</b> <b>and</b> <b>bonobos,</b> males are philopatric and females disperse, which predicts close social bonds between related males and relatively solitary females. In bonobos, however, evidence states differently and the strongest bonds are formed between unrelated females and between mother <b>and</b> son. <b>Chimpanzees</b> generally seemed {{to fit the}} model. However, recently, {{it has been suggested}} that chimpanzee female sociality is highly variable across populations. In particular, West African chimpanzees seem to form more bisexual bonds than East African <b>chimpanzees,</b> <b>and</b> thus resemble <b>bonobos</b> more closely. However, little is known about western chimpanzee sociality. It remains to be determined if western chimpanzees are indeed more social and whether a potential difference is due to environmental factors or genetics. By focussing on the sociality patterns of a West African chimpanzee community in the Nimba Mountains, Guinea, this study aims to 1) examine and compare the level of bisexual bonding in this population, 2) assess which environmental factors influence sociality in this population and 3) compare the sociality patterns of this population with the sociality patterns observed in other communities of western <b>chimpanzees,</b> eastern <b>chimpanzees</b> <b>and</b> <b>bonobos.</b> With answering these urgent questions, this study will provide new insights; not only into the social systems of chimpanzees, but even so into the origins of human sociality and the social system of the last common ancestor of humans, <b>chimpanzees</b> <b>and</b> <b>bonobos...</b>|$|R
