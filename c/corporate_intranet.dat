40|$|Virtual Private Networks (VPN) {{and link}} sharing are cost {{effective}} way of realizing <b>corporate</b> <b>intranets.</b> <b>Corporate</b> <b>intranets</b> will increasingly have to provide Integrated Services for voice and multimedia traffic. Although packet scheduling algorithms {{can be used to}} implement Integrated Services in link sharing [1] and virtual private networks [2], their statistical multiplexing gains are limited. Recently capacity resizing of Virtual Leased Links (VLLs) has been proposed to obtain better statistical multiplexing gains. Carrying out capacity resizing naively may result into unfair distribution of capacities among different VPNs. This is a serious problem especially because the VPN customers who pay for the service expect a well defined grade of service and protection from other misbehaving customers sharing the same infrastructure. We propose a new scheme called Stochastic Fair Sharing (SFS) to carry out fair link sharing and fair sharing among VLLs. In the link sharing environment, ca [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The xSearch project explores a {{promising}} {{new approach to}} intranet search. Google does a remarkable job of searching the external web on the Internet, but tools for searching internal webs on <b>corporate</b> <b>intranets</b> are often disappointing. It turns out that <b>corporate</b> <b>intranets</b> are {{quite different from the}} Internet in their structure, and even Google produces only mediocre results on intranets. The main idea behind xSearch is to let user feedback influence the order in which pages are returned by a search engine. We have identified a simple, effective way to monitor users and deduce which pages best answer their queries. We have also identified several ways to use these implicit page endorsements to rank pages in ways that are both dynamic (respond quickly to changes in user preferences) and robust (resistant to malicious attack). A large-scale experiment is getting underway in collaboration with the @HP Search team...|$|R
