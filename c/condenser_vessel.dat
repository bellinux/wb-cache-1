Above the main cylinder, a perforated container is placed, inside {{of which is a}} metallic collector kept on an iron tripod. The metallic collector is where the distillate sulai is collected. The bottom of the <b>condenser</b> <b>vessel</b> is plastered with mud to prevent excess ventilation during distillation.Water is replaced three to five times after it is heated. Condensed Sulai is collected in a small metallic vessel. The strength of the brew is determined by the number of times water is replaced, with the amount of untreated alcohol being higher when this is done fewer times.|$|E

50|$|Winsor went to Britain before 1799 {{and became}} {{interested}} in the technology and economics of fuels. In 1802 he went to Paris to investigate the 'thermo-lamp' which French engineer Philippe Lebon had patented in 1799. Returning to Britain, he started a gasworks and in 1807 lit one side of Pall Mall, London, with gas lamps. In 1804-09 he was granted various patents for gas furnaces and purifiers. His application to Parliament for a charter for the Gas Light and Coke Company having failed, Winsor once more moved to France, but in Paris his company made little progress and was liquidated in 1819.The distilling retort Winsor used consisted of an iron pot with a fitted lid. The lid had a pipe in the centre leading to the conical <b>condensing</b> <b>vessel,</b> which was compartmented inside with perforated divisions to spread the gas to purify it of hydrogen sulphide and ammonia. The device was not very successful, and the gas being burned was impure and emitted a pungent smell.Winsor published Description of the Thermo-lamp Invented by Lebon of Paris in 1802, Analogy between Animal and Vegetable Life, Demonstrating the Beneficial Application of the Patent Light Stoves to all Green and Hot Houses in 1807, and other works.|$|R
50|$|The {{design of}} small {{autoclaves}} need {{not take into}} consideration the possibility of drawing a vacuum inside the pressure vessel, but this assumption must not be made in larger ones. Steam autoclaves, for example, can be exposed to an internal vacuum if the steam fully <b>condenses</b> while the <b>vessel</b> remains sealed. Although external pressure cannot exceed one atmosphere, that can suffice to collapse the vessel in some cases. Thus, stiffening may be required.|$|R
40|$|Portions of the 242 -A Evaporator on the Hanford Site must be {{assessed}} {{to meet the}} requirements of the Washington State Department of Ecology`s Dangerous Waste Regulation, Washington Administrative Code (WAC) 173 - 303. The assessment is limited to the provisions of Section 173 - 303 - 640. This Integrity Assessment Plan (IAP) identifies tasks which will be performed during the assessment phase and describes the intended assessment techniques. The 242 -A Evaporator facility processes waste solutions from most of the operating laboratories and plants of the Hanford Site. The waste solutions are concentrated in the evaporator to a slurry of liquid and crystallized salts. This concentrated slurry is returned to the Tank Farms at a significantly reduce volume. The water vapor from the evaporation process is condensed, filtered, and can be pumped through an ion exchange bed before transfer to a retention basin. The non-condensable portion of the vapor is filtered and continuously monitored before venting to the atmosphere. The 242 -A Evaporator will {{be assessed}} as seven subsystems. Four of the subsystems store, transport or treat Washington State Dangerous wastes, the other three subsystems are integral parts of the process, however, they do not directly store, transfer, or treat listed dangerous wastes. The facility will be inspected, tested, and analyzed through this assessment. The seven subsystems, defined in detail in Appendix B, are: Evaporator Process and Slurry Subsystem; Vapor <b>Condenser</b> Subsystem; <b>Vessel</b> Vent Subsystem; Process Condensate Subsystem; Steam Condensate Subsystem; Raw Water Disposal Subsystem; and Building and Secondary Containment Subsystem...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{software}} {{tool for the}} analysis of 3 D-line shaped objects in a 3 D grey valued image. We discuss the extraction of the object from the image, the measurement of its shape features and its display. keywords: 3 D-curves, shape measurement, interactive visualization This work was supported by the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs through SPIN grants " 3 D Computer Vision" and " 3 D Image Analysis. We further acknowledge the help of Pia Pfluger in the numerical aspects of the shape estimation. 1 1 Introduction In 3 D, one can distinguish objects bounded by a surface, such as cells, organs, and the skull, from objects which are tubular shaped. Examples of the latter are <b>condensed</b> chromosomes, blood <b>vessels,</b> and transport channels. The shape of the tubular objects is best described by the shape of the axis of the object which is a 3 D-spatial curve. Segmentation of such objects differs from the more usual 3 D-volume segmentation as in for example [Strasters and Gerbrands, 1991]. W [...] ...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} a {{previously}} unrecognized fibro-myofibroblastic tumor in the oral cavity of a 15 -year-old girl. Morphologically, the tumor mimicked a rhabdomyosarcoma, botryoid variant. It was composed of mitotically active small- to medium-sized, vimentin+/desmin+, round- to oval- to epithelioid-shaped cells embedded in an alternating fibrous to myxoid/edematous stroma. These cells were separated from the overlying squamous epithelium by a rim of fibrous stroma. The tumor contained abundant small- to medium-sized, thin-walled blood vessels without hyalinization. Frequently, neoplastic cells <b>condensed</b> around these <b>vessels.</b> An unusual and striking feature was the presence of numerous hyalinized collagen mats, including "amianthoid-like fibers", similar to those observed in myofibroblastomas. The presence of these collagen mats and the expression of desmin, in association with no immunoreactivity to myogenin and MyoD 1, were {{in keeping with the}} fibro-myofibroblastic nature of the tumor, excluding the diagnosis of embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma. Regarding fibro-myofibroblastic tumors, we believe that the present case falls within the wide spectrum of benign stromal tumors, originally described in the lower female genital tract, but potentially occurring also at extragenital sites. As morphological and immunohistochemical features were reminiscent of, but not identical with, angiomyofibroblastoma, the term "polypoid angiomyofibroblastoma-like tumor" is proposed. Awareness and recognition of this tumor is crucial to avoid a diagnosis of malignancy...|$|R
40|$|The oxy-combustion of {{hydrogen}} and carbon monoxide mixtures at initial atmospheric condition of temperature and pressure {{has shown the}} presence of intense peak overpressures, higher than the adiabatic value and oscillating pressure signal. In this thesis the observed explosion mode have been addressed to the rapid phase transition of super-heated liquid water produced by the combustion reaction and <b>condensed</b> on the <b>vessel</b> walls. Such complex phenomenon has {{to be included in}} the general explosion classification and it is due to the synergic coupling between a physical explosion (Rapid Phase Transition) and a chemical explosion (Deflagration). This mode has been named combustion-induced Rapid Phase Transition (c-RPT). c-RPT does not occur for CO/O 2 /N 2 mixture because of the absence {{of hydrogen}} (no H 2 O in the products). The limiting value of H 2 in CO/O 2 /N 2 mixtures, for the c-RPT occurrence, has been identified as 1 % in the fuel (H 2 +CO). A general criterion for c-RPT peaks based on characteristic times of evaporation and combustion has been developed. When applying the criterion of c-RPT phenomenon to literature data, it turns out that they are often the result of c-RPT rather to Deflagration to Detonation Transition or Heat Explosio...|$|R
