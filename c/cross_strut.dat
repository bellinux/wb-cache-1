2500|$|Robert E. Drake, who {{had been}} {{employed}} by the Woodworth Company was busy {{with a group of}} men doing cable work at the west anchorage. His death was due the breaking of a cable on a derrick, which sent the boom directly on top of him. The second death, on April 7, 1950, was that of 36-year-old ironworker Lawrence S. Gale. His death was due to a temporary weld failure at a lower chord <b>cross</b> <b>strut</b> at panel 33. It was Gale's {{first day on the job}} building the stiffening truss work, and he had noticed a weld that didn't look right. He was going to repair the weld, when it broke.

2500|$|The D.7, major {{parts of}} which were built by Short Brothers, re-used the same wing but with a very {{different}} structure supporting it. [...] The wing was straight edged, tapering from a central chord of 6ft 3 in (1.91 m) to 5ft 0 in (1.52 m) at the tips. [...] The leading edge was swept at 35°. The heavy A-frames were replaced {{with a pair of}} rectangular frames which extended above and below the wings, linked at the bottom by two transverse members. These frames served as double kingposts from which each wing was wire braced above and below. A substantial undercarriage structure was mounted {{at the bottom of the}} frames, comprising a long pair of skids which extended from the pusher propeller line well forward beyond the nacelle and curving strongly upwards. Each skid was multiply braced to its frame and inwards to the nacelle; the pair were joined by a <b>cross</b> <b>strut</b> near the forward tip. Both carried a pair of wheels and, at the rear, an articulated and sprung extension to absorb landing shocks.|$|E

50|$|A box kite {{is a high}} {{performance}} kite, noted for developing relatively high lift; it is a type within the family of cellular kites. The typical design has four parallel struts. The box is made rigid with diagonal <b>crossed</b> <b>struts.</b> There are two sails, or ribbons, whose width is {{about a quarter of}} the length of the box. The ribbons wrap around the ends of the box, leaving the ends and middle of the kite open. In flight, one strut is the bottom, and the bridle is tied between the top and bottom of this strut. The dihedrals of the sails help stability.|$|R
50|$|The Reynolds Bridge {{is located}} roughly midway between Waterbury {{and the town}} center of Thomaston, just east of Connecticut Route 8's Exit 38. It is {{oriented}} northwest-southeast, and spans the Naugatuck River, the active railroad of the Naugatuck Railroad, which run along the river's east bank, and a former right-of-way of a streetcar line which ran along the river's west bank. The bridge is a three-arch open spandrel concrete structure, with four concrete beam approach spans on either side. The main span is 169 ft long, while the secondary arches are each 97 ft; the brige has a total length of 487 ft. The arches are joined by <b>crossing</b> <b>struts,</b> and vertical columns rise from the arch to support the road deck. The deck has a width of 42 ft, with the sidewalks cantilevered outside the supporting arches.|$|R
50|$|Instead, {{the station}} {{platforms}} consist of two chambers linked by cross tunnels, each having two platforms {{on top of}} each other. The side of each chamber was made up of two drift tunnels, one at the top and one at the bottom. These were then linked together by 228 vertically raise bored shafts, 1 metre in diameter and 3 metres apart. The shafts and drifts were then filled with concrete, and formed the side skeleton of the station chambers. The arch of each chamber was then constructed underground {{across the top of the}} two side walls, the material below the arch excavated down to the bottom of the side walls, and temporary <b>cross</b> <b>struts</b> added between the raise bored columns until the permanent elements were added. This innovative method resulted in a $1 million saving in construction costs (in 1975 dollars).|$|R

50|$|The roof work of {{the choir}} was built in two phases between 1317 and 1323 from east to west, as a rafter roof with collar beam {{position}} and <b>cross</b> <b>strut.</b> The approximately 28 m long roof has a roof pitch of 57°, consists of 24 rafters and includes the polygonal upper fixation of the choir. The roof turret design was developed in 1496, and the belfry in 1475. Due to the strong inclination of the rafter container of about 97 cm, a pursuit of spruce and fir {{was set up in}} the 17th century. The roof structure was two times repaired what easily is recognizable. The first repair contained, among other things, the installation of the supporting struts, which stabilized the rafter container. Towards {{to the end of the}} 17th century, the second repair was implemented, which concentrated on the eastern chancel. One can note that the inclination of the entire roof work is originated by the pressure of the polygonal choir construction.|$|E
50|$|Two DH.52s were built. The first machine (competition no.4) had {{a single}} <b>cross</b> axle, <b>strutted</b> {{undercarriage}} for its first flight on 5 October 1922, but this {{was replaced by a}} pair of smaller wheels mounted close to the fuselage sides on an axle fixed to the lower longerons. The second (no. 33) had this undercarriage from the start.|$|R
50|$|The {{very basic}} Manuel glider was an all wood two bay biplane without stagger, sweep or dihedral. The bays were divided by pairs of {{parallel}} interplane struts; the interplane gap was large. The {{upper and lower}} wings had the same span and were precisely rectangular in plan, with ailerons on the upper planes. The tail surfaces were carried on a horizontally orientated flat girder formed from two long wooden members joined by four <b>cross</b> <b>struts</b> and diagonal wire bracing. This was fixed to the wing, at mid gap, through another pair of interplane struts and wire braced from the wings against vertical deflections. The horizontal tail was all-moving and a rhomboidal rudder was attached to a slender triangular fin. The pilot sat, exposed, ahead of the lower wing on a short platform with the same width as the fuselage girder and extending a little behind the trailing edge.|$|R
50|$|Whilst {{the timber}} framing of the 14th and 15th centuries was still simple and large-scale, in the 16th to 18th centuries ever more {{complicated}} designs evolved, {{on one hand}} to give the building greater stability, {{and on the other}} for decorative reasons. Especially popular were <b>crossed</b> <b>struts</b> that formed a St. Andrew's Cross. Timber framed buildings continued to be erected until the mid-19th century. Then there was a change: in the southern Bresse rammed earth (Stampflehm) was increasingly used for the walls, which usually had reinforced corners of brick or stone, and the façades were covered with rammed earth. In the northern Bresse, brick has generally been used since the 19th century, albeit bricks of low quality. At the same time, the hips on the gable ends were shortened to create a half-hipped roof or even a simple gable roof, with the eaves on the gable ends disappearing almost completely.|$|R

40|$|ObjectivesThe {{incidence}} and effect of bare stent <b>struts</b> <b>crossing</b> the renal ostia following endovascular aortic aneurysm repair with the Talent stent-graft is not known. The study aims {{to establish the}} incidence in which bare stent <b>struts</b> <b>cross</b> the renal ostia and to assess any associated effects on renal function. MethodsFifty-five patients (51 men, mean age 73 years, range 57 – 90) who had endovascular repair of their abdominal aortic aneurysms with a Talent suprarenal stent-graft {{were included in the}} study. Patients were scanned at a variety of follow-up periods (median 24 months, range 3 – 102). The relationship between the bare stent struts and the renal ostia, together with renal function were retrospectively recorded. The presence and location of the bare stent struts was assessed using CT virtual intravascular endoscopy (CT VIE). Struts were defined as being absent, peripherally located or in the central channel of the renal ostia. Renal function was assessed from glomerular filtration rates (GFR) derived from serum creatinine levels and the Cockcroft and Gault formula. ResultsA total of 109 renal ostia were evaluated by CT VIE with one patient having a previous nephrectomy. Bare stent <b>struts</b> <b>crossed</b> 1 renal ostium in 22 (40 %) patients and bilateral ostia in 5 (9 %) patients. Of the 109 ostia assessed, 15 (14 %) ostia were crossed centrally and 17 (16 %) had <b>struts</b> <b>crossing</b> the ostium peripherally. There were no statistically significant differences in the change between pre-operative GFR and latest GFR in the group without any strut involvement (6 mLs/min± 7 mLs/min) and the group with <b>struts</b> <b>crossing</b> one or both renal ostia (2 mLs/min± 9 mLs/min; p>. 05). ConclusionPeripheral or central coverage of renal ostia by bare stent struts occurs in a third of all renal arteries following EVAR. Crossing of renal ostia by bare stent struts does not affect follow-up GFR...|$|R

40|$|AbstractTrabecular bone {{disconnection}} is {{an independent}} factor in age-related skeletal failure where real termini (ReTm; rare in youth) may cause weakness disproportionate to tissue loss, yet their structural contribution at vulnerable locations remains uncertain. ReTm (previously recorded at the iliac crest) were mapped in “normal” aged vertebral bodies (T 11 –L 5 autopsy; 20 females, 10 males) and corresponding proximal femora (autopsy; 10 females). Results were compared with biomechanically failed femora from orthopaedic subjects aged > 58 yr (osteoporosis OP, 10 females; osteoarthritis OA, 10 females). A novel direct 2 D/ 3 D histological method was applied to large, thick (300 μm) slices superficially silver-stained to separate ReTm (unstained) from apparent termini (planar artefacts, brown). Light microscope field co-ordinates enabled ReTm mapping and statistical testing relative to i) sex, ii) tissue sector and iii) slicing plane. In men ReTm populations were small and random while in women they were large and sector-specific. In vertebrae they clustered anterior/superior being rare posterior/inferior; in the femoral head they concentrated distal/superior and also near the fovea, being fewer distal/inferior. A distribution polarity was evident with 100 % more ReTm observed transversely (i. e., on tensile-related <b>cross</b> <b>struts)</b> than longitudinally (i. e., on compression-related vertical struts). Their numbers rose in OP (BV/TV 14 %), remaining polarised and sector-specific in OP only. Comparative experimentation by marrow elution of an OP animal model demonstrated “floating segments” as a possible outcome. Conclusions were supported statistically that trabecular disconnection “hotspots” at vulnerable locations are sex- and sector-specific, mainly transaxial, and subject to disease modulation...|$|R

40|$|Background: Complex {{deformity}} correction and fracture {{treatment with}} the Ilizarov method needs extensive preoperative analysis and laborious postoperative fixator alterations, which are error-prone. We report our initial experience in treating the first 22 patients having fractures and complex deformities and shortening with software-controlled Taylor spatial frame (TSF) external fixator, for its {{ease of use}} and accuracy in achieving fracture reduction and complex deformity correction. Settings and Design: The struts of the TSF fixator have multiplane hinges at both ends and the six struts allow correction in all six axes. Hence the same struts act to correct either angulation or translation or rotation. With a single construct assembled during surgery all the desired axis corrections can be performed without a change of the montage as is needed with the Ilizarov fixator. Materials and Methods: Twenty-seven limb segments were operated with the TSF fixator. There were 23 tibiae, two femora, one knee joint and one ankle joint. Seven patients had comminuted fractures. Ten patients who had 13 deformed segments achieved full correction. Eight patients had lengthening in 10 tibiae. (Five of these also had simultaneous correction of deformities). One patient each had correction of knee and ankle deformities. Accurate reduction of fractures and correction of deformities and length could be achieved {{in all of our}} patients with minimum postoperative fixator alterations as compared to the Ilizarov system. The X-ray visualization of the osteotomy or lengthening site due to the six <b>crossing</b> <b>struts</b> and added bulk of the fixator rings which made positioning in bed and walking slightly more difficult as compared to the Ilizarov fixator. Conclusions: The TSF external fixator allows accurate fracture reduction and deformity correction without tedious analysis and postoperative frame alterations. The high cost of the fixator is a deterrent. The need for an internet connection and special X-rays to operate the fixator add to its complexity...|$|R
40|$|A finite-element-method-based {{micromechanics}} {{has been}} used for predicting the orthotropic properties of opencell foams that have tetrakaidecahedral unit cells. Foams with equisided and Kelvin-elongated tetrakaidecahedron as unit cells are studied. The results for elastic constants from the finite element models agree well with those of available analytical models. The struts were modeled using both Euler–Bernoulli and Timoshenko beam elements. It is found that classical beam theory overpredicts the elastic moduli when the struts have smaller length-to-thickness ratios. The effect of varying <b>strut</b> <b>cross</b> section on the elastic constants is studied. The variation is assumed to be such that the <b>strut</b> <b>cross</b> section gradually decreases from maximum value at the support ends to minimum value at the beam midsection.

40|$|This thesis {{sought to}} develop a model to emulate {{coronary}} balloon-stent angioplasty. A model predictive of the radial expansion experienced by a balloon-stent-vessel system under internal pressure was developed. Seven parametric stent configurations modeled after the Boston Scientific TAXUStm Express 2 tm stent were generated in Pro/Engineer 4. 0 which varied in <b>strut</b> <b>cross</b> section. These stents were expanded using finite element package ABAQUS/CAE 6. 7 under non-linear, large deformation conditions. An elasto-plastic, Ramberg-Osgood material model for 316 L stainless steel with two different work hardening exponents was used. Radial expansion vs. internal pressure data was collected in each simulation. The blood vessel expansion behavior was analytically developed using a hyperelastic model borrowed from existing literature. An area fraction model {{was used to assess}} the load transfer from the balloon external surface to the stent inner surface. The balloon, stent, and vessel models were combined and favorably compared to the manufacturing data that accompanied the TAXUS stent. It was found that stent <b>strut</b> <b>cross</b> section and material work hardening greatly affected the radial expansion-pressure curves. Balloon effects were found to be prominent and increased in severity as the stent unfolded. Vessel behavior was found to be relatively compliant compared to the stent, but with the inclusion of atherosclerotic plaque the simple rule of mixtures showed that the effective shear modulus of the vessel stiffened significantly. These results verify the feasibility of generating an accurate predictive model of balloon-stent-vessel expansion and serve as the foundation for future modeling...|$|R

50|$|The {{rectangular}} cross-section fuselage consisted of four spruce Warren girders, fabric covered behind the engine. The cockpit {{was at the}} trailing edge of the wing and behind there was a deep, rounded fabric covered decking. In front of the cockpit the decking was continued in aluminium, enclosing the fuel tank. Forward of this and beyond a firewall, the inverted in-line engine was mounted on a frame of square section steel members. It drove a two bladed metal propeller. Comper was an early adopter of retractable undercarriages for light aircraft {{at a time when the}} balance of advantage between drag loss and weight penalty was not obvious. The main wheels of the Streak were mounted at the end of the wing centre section, each between pairs of compression legs. Pairs of <b>cross</b> braced <b>struts,</b> joining the legs a little way above the axle and hinged at top and bottom, rotated to retract the wheels rearwards. In common with many aircraft of the time, the retracted undercarriage left a part of the wheel exposed, to give some protection in a wheels up landing.

In {{order to get the}} general results applicable to this kind of materials, the dimensionless compressive stress is used and the stress-strain curves of foam models with different geometrical properties are obtained. Then, the influences of open-cell geometrical properties, including the shape of <b>strut</b> <b>cross</b> section, relative density and cell shape irregularity, on the compressive nonlinear mechanical performance are analyzed. In addition, the numerical results are compared with the predicted results of cubic staggering model. Numerical results indicate that the simulated results reflect the compressive process of foams quite well and the geometrical properties of cell have significant influences on the nonlinear mechanical behavior of foams...|$|R
