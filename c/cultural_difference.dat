25|$|With {{regards to}} {{cultural}} {{differences in how}} the genders view infidelity, {{it was observed that}} females found emotional infidelity much more distressful and males found sexual infidelity to be much more distressful than females. A comparison between modern day Chinese and American societies showed that there was greater distress with sexual infidelity in the US than in China. The <b>cultural</b> <b>difference</b> is most likely due to the more restrictive nature of Chinese society, thus, making infidelity a more salient concern. Sexual promiscuity is more prominent in the United States, thus it follows that American society is more preoccupied with infidelity than Chinese society (Geary et al. 1995).|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{elucidate}} the effects of organizational and national <b>cultural</b> <b>differences</b> on international acquisitions. We argue that <b>cultural</b> <b>differences</b> prompt social identity building that leads to ‘us versus them’ thinking and thereby creates the potential for social conflict. We also maintain that the same <b>cultural</b> <b>differences</b> can contribute to learning in terms of knowledge transfer. We develop a structural equation model to test these hypothesized effects on a sample of related international acquisitions. Our analysis shows that <b>cultural</b> <b>differences</b> at the organizational level are positively associated with social conflict, but that national <b>cultural</b> <b>differences</b> can decrease social conflict. Furthermore, both organizational and national <b>cultural</b> <b>differences</b> are positively associated with knowledge transfer. This analysis shows the importance of disentangling the various effects that <b>cultural</b> <b>differences</b> have on international acquisitions. It also suggests that national <b>cultural</b> <b>differences</b> are less of a problem in international acquisitions than is usually assumed...|$|R

Shanghai Auto wanted the brand and technology to expand its footprint in China. However, the <b>cultural</b> <b>difference,</b> the objection to transfer the technology and the failed sales of new SUV model put Shanghai Auto's ambition of expansion in jeopardy. It caused huge conflict between Ssangyong employees and Shanghai Auto as things didn't go well as planned. And the 2008 global economic crisis put Ssangyong on a survival mode, let alone expansion. After the negotiation with the labor union to reduce wages failed, Shanghai Auto decided to exit from Ssangyong and didn't get a penny back for their US$500 million investment.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the demands}} made in the 1971 Croatian Spring, such as giving more {{autonomy}} to the individual republics, became reality with the new federal constitution 1974. At {{the same time that}} the constitution gave the republics more autonomy it also awarded a similar status to two autonomous provinces within Serbia: Kosovo, a largely ethnic Albanian populated region, and Vojvodina, a region with Serb majority but large numbers of ethnic minorities, such as Hungarians. These reforms satisfied most of the republics, especially Croatia as well as the Albanians of Kosovo and the minorities of Vojvodina. But the 1974 constitution deeply aggravated Serbian communist officials and Serbs themselves who distrusted the motives of the proponents of the reforms. Many Serbs saw the reforms as concessions to Croatian and Albanian nationalists, as no similar autonomous provinces were made to represent the large numbers of Serbs of Croatia or Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serb nationalists were frustrated over Tito's support of the recognition of Montenegrins and Macedonians as independent nationalities, as Serbian nationalists had claimed that there was no ethnic or <b>cultural</b> <b>difference</b> separating these two nations from the Serbs that could verify that such nationalities truly existed.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the biggest}} {{obstacle}} to higher education for women is the physical and cultural distance of the universities from Negev Bedouin towns. Even the nearest universities require significant travel time to and from campus. In many instances, Bedouin women are only permitted {{to make the trip}} if accompanied by a male relative. Moreover, the university is a very different cultural space than Negev Bedouin towns. Jewish-Israeli culture is largely modern and secular, as opposed to the traditional, religious culture in Negev Bedouin society. This pronounced <b>cultural</b> <b>difference</b> is both an obstacle to enrolling at universities and a challenge women must overcome once they arrive. Additionally, societal pressure to marry young can conflict with attaining a university education. While there have been cases where women could attain a university education after marrying, the familial responsibilities (childcare and housework, for instance) provide additional challenges to completing their studies. Further, studying after marriage is entirely dependent upon the approval of the women's husbands. In other words, women are always dependent upon male consent for their studies, either from their fathers (or other male guardians) or their husbands. Finally, the lack of female employment opportunities means that studying at a university {{does not seem to be}} a reasonable investment, especially in instances where family resources are limited.|$|E

In this case study, I researched Japanese-Dutch <b>cultural</b> <b>differences</b> in one company and looked at which <b>cultural</b> <b>differences</b> there are, which problems they caused and how employees dealt with them. Then I compared the results with the literature about <b>cultural</b> <b>differences</b> and examined how the literature could help predict, understand and deal with the <b>cultural</b> <b>differences</b> in the company. My case study shows the importance of looking critically at models and theories that are often used for research on <b>cultural</b> <b>differences,</b> such as Geert Hofstede’s cultural dimensions and Edward Hall’s model of high and low-context communication. My conclusion is that case studies are more helpful to predict and understand <b>cultural</b> <b>differences</b> in practice than these models, because culture is too dynamic to capture in models that try to reduce its complexity to fit it in their models. Instead of categorizing <b>cultural</b> <b>differences,</b> it is better to focus on developing a framework and consistent methods for researching them in practice.

It proposes that post-acquisition conflict {{can be explained by}} <b>cultural</b> <b>differences</b> and acculturation factors. The sample is based on domestic and international acquisitions carried out by Finnish corporations during the period 2001 - 2004. The results show that organizational <b>cultural</b> <b>differences</b> and organizational <b>cultural</b> preservation increase conflict, partner attractiveness decreases conflict, while national <b>cultural</b> <b>differences</b> have no influence on the level of conflict.

In the past two decades, business negotiations between China and the U. S. have been growing remarkably. However, there are huge <b>cultural</b> <b>differences</b> {{between the two countries}} and the <b>cultural</b> <b>differences</b> always {{have a negative effect on}} Sino-American business negotiations. Hence, it is widely accepted that understanding <b>cultural</b> <b>differences</b> is vital to Sino-American business negotiations. This paper also emphasizes that in business negotiations people must be familiar with the other cultures, enhance sensitivity to <b>cultural</b> <b>differences</b> and reduce instability caused by the <b>cultural</b> <b>differences.</b> Only in this way can people increase the predictability of the other negotiation’s behavior and develop appropriate negotiation strategy, thus become more active in the negotiating process.

40|$|In this article, <b>cultural</b> <b>differences</b> {{in values}} and norms will be {{explored}} {{in relation to}} <b>cultural</b> <b>differences</b> in child images. The first question addressed concerns whether parents from different cultures differ in the values and norms that are most important to {{them in terms of}} child-rearing and, if so, what those <b>cultural</b> <b>differences</b> are and what they say about <b>cultural</b> <b>differences</b> in child images. Interwoven with this exploration is the social debate about values, norms, and problems involving ethnic minorities in The Netherlands. In addition, the issue of the relationship between <b>cultural</b> <b>differences</b> in values and norms, and problems experienced by ethnic minorities, will be addressed. We conclude that, using the individualist-collectivist concepts, there are small intercultural differences in the importance of values and norms, and that these differences might lead to <b>cultural</b> <b>differences</b> in child images. Other than this difference, European parents are remarkably similar in terms of the norms and values they think are important in child rearing. Because of the finding that the <b>cultural</b> <b>differences</b> in child images are quite small, it is argued that, if these differences have anything at all to do with problems of ethnic minorities, they certainly are not the main cause of these problems...|$|R

2500|$|The {{cultural}} {{practices of the}} United States show considerable similarities to those in northern and central European regions, such as Germany, Scandinavia, and the United Kingdom.

This topic has been explored in A History of Private Life (2001), under the general editorship of Philippe Ariès and Georges Duby. On the other hand, those living in densely populated places likely have lower expectations of personal space.

40|$|Heterogamy is {{commonly}} considered detrimental to relationships {{because of its}} hypothesized link with <b>cultural</b> <b>differences</b> and social disapproval. Focusing on the link with <b>cultural</b> <b>differences,</b> this explanation lacks solid empirical support. The scarce studies encounter problems related to the choice and measurement of <b>cultural</b> <b>differences,</b> while psychology oriented studies have generally not confirmed this link. In addition, the wide theoretical base that supports this link, is challenged {{by a number of}} empirical considerations that cast doubt on the cultural similarity of homogamous couples (e. g. gender differences in values and behaviors), and the quasi-mechanical effect that is assumed to lead to <b>cultural</b> <b>differences</b> for heterogamous couples (e. g. selection on values and behaviors). Progressing from the inconclusive findings of previous studies, this study examines the theoretically founded link between educational heterogamy, as heterogamy in achieved characteristics is asserted most important for <b>cultural</b> <b>differences,</b> and <b>cultural</b> <b>differences</b> concerning child-rearing. In addition, Diagonal Reference Models are used to analyze the individually measured values and behaviors of both partners, as couples data from the Netherlands are used (survey Child-rearing and family in the Netherlands). Results indicate that education shows the expected positive association with the child-rearing behaviours of support, and the expected negative association with the child-rearing behaviours of negative control and the child-rearing values of adaptation. However, for educational heterogamy, the situation appears more complex, as results show that homogamous couples are not free of <b>cultural</b> <b>differences</b> either (e. g. gender differences in negative control), while the degree of <b>cultural</b> <b>differences</b> is affected by other important factors as well (e. g. processes of selection). Nevertheless, a positive link between educational heterogamy and <b>cultural</b> <b>differences</b> was found for support and adaptation. For negative control, a different mechanism appeared to be at work with increased negative control for both partners in heterogamous couples. While this does not support the hypothesis of increased <b>cultural</b> <b>differences</b> for heterogamous couples, it does fit with the idea of heterogamy leading to problems in heterogamous families...|$|R
