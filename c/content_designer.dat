The project required the collaboration of two design teams: (1) the <b>content</b> <b>designers</b> and (2) the multimedia designers.

40|$|As content becomes {{increasingly}} significant in giving “face” to information technology (IT), {{the need to}} train and produce <b>content</b> <b>designers</b> has also {{become more and more}} important. The development of powerful computer technologies and the complexity of design have demanded designers to re-examine the design process and consider the adaptation of tools that will provide for creativity, improve the overall design process and, at the same time, reveal new insights (Rafi and Karboulonis, 2000). This paper gives an overview of the relationship between art and science through the ages, and discusses their relatively recent re-convergence. This text further argues that a re-convergence between art and science is currently occurring, highlighting the need to accelerate the process. It is suggested that re-convergence is a result of new technologies being researched, namely related to effective visualisation and communication of ideas and concepts, subsequently adopted by practitioners. Such elements, with tools that offer increased power and new abilities, are widely found today in the multimedia and the Virtual Environment (VE) as scientists and designers venture into each otheris domain. This paper also argues that <b>content</b> <b>designers</b> of the future must not only be both artist and technologist, but artist and technologist that are aware of the context in which content is being developed.

40|$|Human {{creativity}} {{works best}} {{when there are}} constraints - pressures to react to, to shape, to suggest. People are generally {{not very good at}} making it all up from scratch (Laurel, 1991). Emerging technology particularly virtual reality (VR) Multimedia and Internet is yet to be fully discovered as it allows unprecedented creative talent, ability, skill set, creative thinking, representation, exploration, observation and reference. In an effort to deliver interactive <b>content,</b> <b>designers</b> tend to freely borrow from different fields such as advertising, medicine, game, fine art, commerce, entertainment, edutainment, film-making and architecture (Rafi, Kamarulzaman, Fauzan and Karboulonis, 2000). As a result, content becomes a base that developers transfer the technique of conventional medium design media to the computer. What developers (e. g. artist and technologist) often miss is that to develop the emerging technology content based {{on the nature of the}} medium. In this context, the user is the one that will be the best judge to value the effectiveness of the content.   The paper will introduce Global Information Infrastructure (GII) that is currently being developed in the Asian region and discuss its impact on the Information Age society. It will further highlight the “natural” value and characteristics of the emerging technologies in particular Virtual Reality (VR), Multimedia and Internet as a guidance to design an effective, rich and innovative content development. This paper also argues that <b>content</b> <b>designers</b> of the future must not only be both artist and technologist, but artist and technologist that are aware of the re-convergence of art and science and context in which content is being developed. Some of our exploration at the Faculty of Creative Multimedia, Multimedia University will also be demonstrated.
