40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} to tune the holes in colloidal masks used for nanolithography. Using a simple wet-chemical method, {{a thin layer of}} silica is grown on masks of silica particles. The size of the holes is controlled by the amount of tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) added. More accurate tuning of the hole size is possible {{in the presence of a}} <b>calibrated</b> <b>seed</b> dispersion of silica colloids. Wedemonstrate modified masks that were used to create arrays of metal nanoparticles with a size ranging from 400 nm, for unmodified masks, down to tens of nanometers. The method is easy-to-use, fast, and inexpensive...|$|E

40|$|Methods: Three dosimetric {{studies have}} been performed: The first one used thermoluminescent {{detectors}} in a solid water phantom with NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology, USA) <b>calibrated</b> <b>seeds,</b> and two separate studies were of Monte Carlo photon transport calculations (MCNP 5 code). The TG- 43 U 1 protocol was applied to derive dosimetric parameters for clinical applications. Results: The radial dose function g(r) was determined at different distances ranging from 0. 5 to 10 cm; and the anisotropy function F(r,theta) at angles ranging from 0 degrees to 350 degrees in 10 degrees increments. Monte Carlo calculations were performed in liquid water to obtain values for Lambda, g(r), F(r,theta), and phi(an) (r) as recommended by the TG- 43 U 1 protocol for use in treatment planning system software. SmartSeed's biocompatible polymer capsule permits fluorescence x rays (3, 5, and 12 keV), generated by lead glass marker, {{to be present in}} the emission spectrum, influencing the dose rate constant. The impact on near field dosimetry in water from these x rays was also investigated and reported. The capsule also attenuates iodine- 125 energies much less than typical titanium encased sources, resulting in a highly isotropic source. Conclusions: SmartSeed has a dose rate constant of 0. 895 +/- 7. 3 % cGy h(- 1) U- 1, a radial dose function nearly identical to the IBt-Bebig model I 25. S 06 seed, and a highly isotropic dose distribution. Fluorescence x rays account for the relatively low value of Lambda, yet their variable contribution to dosimetry arising from seed dimensional uncertainties is estimated to be < 0. 2 %...|$|R
40|$|Infl uence of ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) and N-nitrose-N´-ethyl urea (ENU) {{mutagenic}} treatments {{was investigated}} on three time sub-cultured calli obtained from leaf petiole explants of 7 -day old sterile plants. <b>Calibrated</b> sterile <b>seeds</b> {{of the common}} bean Bulgarian variety Plovdiv 11 M were pre-cultivated on MS basal medium supplemented with 1 µmM BAP. Then, both mutagens EMS and ENU were applied for different times such as 15, 30, 60 and 90 min on the explants at the concentrations of: 2. 5. 10 - 2 M and 6. 2. 10 - 3 M, respectively. Times of the mutagenic treatments infl uenced callus growth, calli from 30 -min treatment with both mutagens showing the highest weights. In both cases, the 90 -min mutagen application caused a too relevant effect either on callus browning or growth inhibition. In general, ENU showed a stronger effect than EMS. The effect of subcultures on callus growth was higher than mutagenic treatments. Interactions between these factors checked by by correlation ratio (η%) were quite low...|$|R
40|$|AbstracteSolar {{provides}} a low-cost, modular heliostat field solution for tower-based CSP facilities. Industry-leading cost {{has been achieved}} via large quantities of small (∼ 2. 2 m 2) single-facet, individually-controlled heliostats with simple field installation methods. These modular fields can contain up to 50, 000 heliostats (108, 000 m 2) per receiver and {{a dozen or more}} modules may comprise a single plant, presenting a challenge for timely commissioning and calibration with previously existing technology. In response to this challenge, eSolar has developed a fully-automated proprietary calibration system that enables accurate individual heliostat tracking rapidly upon commissioning. The system operates by reflecting light from LEDs located on towers around the field into cameras, which are located on the same towers. The efficacy of this approach is demonstrated at eSolar's Sierra SunTower facility in Lancaster, CA, USA (Fig. 1) where a field of > 24, 000 heliostats can be <b>calibrated</b> from realistic <b>seed</b> conditions in less than two weeks with resultant pointing error of < 1. 5 mrad. The calibration system's precise, parallel, and high throughput data collection further enables rapid detection of broken and mis-pointing heliostats, dramatically reducing the Mean Time to Repair (MTTR) from individual heliostat failures, as well as automating the task of discovering such failures. This paper describes the technical solution that eSolar has created and elaborates on the benefits of the system...|$|R
