5|$|Animals are {{susceptible}} {{to a number of}} diseases and conditions that may affect their health. Some, like <b>classical</b> <b>swine</b> <b>fever</b> and scrapie are specific to one type of stock, while others, like foot-and-mouth disease affect all cloven-hoofed animals. Where the condition is serious, governments impose regulations on import and export, on the movement of stock, quarantine restrictions and the reporting of suspected cases. Vaccines are available against certain diseases, and antibiotics are widely used where appropriate. At one time, antibiotics were routinely added to certain compound foodstuffs to promote growth, but this practice is now frowned on in many countries because of the risk that it may lead to antibiotic resistance. Animals living under intensive conditions are particularly prone to internal and external parasites; increasing numbers of sea lice are affecting farmed salmon in Scotland. Reducing the parasite burdens of livestock results in increased productivity and profitability.|$|E

2500|$|Pestiviruses have {{a single}} stranded, [...] positive-sense RNA genomes. They cause <b>Classical</b> <b>swine</b> <b>fever</b> (CSF) and Bovine viral diarrhea(BVD). [...] Mucosal disease is a distinct, chronic {{persistent}} infection, whereas BVD is an acute infection.|$|E
40|$|Hog cholera, {{also known}} as <b>classical</b> or European <b>swine</b> <b>fever,</b> is caused by hog cholera virus, {{a member of the}} genus Pestivirus. It is shown here that the end stage of lethal {{infection}} in the natural host is associated with a dramatic depletion preferentially of B lymphocytes in the circulatory system as well as in lymphoid tissues. Already at the onset of disease, viral replication in lymphoid tissues demarcates the germinal centers, and the viral genome remains localized to that site as the disease progresses even after morphologic disintegration of the follicular structure. A block in B-lymphocyte maturation by infection and destruction of germinal centers is discussed as a key event in the pathogenesis of acute, lethal hog cholera...|$|R
5000|$|Livestock is widespread, {{with about}} 60 percent of rural {{families}} depending {{on it for}} their income. Animal production is dominated by extensive livestock rearing, pigs and poultry. There is also a growing modern poultry industry around the main cities. In 2008, livestock accounted for 9.7 million of head of cattle, 2 million sheep and goats, 1.4 million pigs, and 26 million poultry. Overall, meat production was estimated at 251,000 tons; milk, 530,000 tons; and hen eggs, 19,000 tons. [...] Zebus are also used for agricultural work for puddling rice fields {{as well as for}} ploughing and pulling carts. The high prevalence of disease is the main constraint undermining an increase of production. For example, Newcastle disease is a major ubiquitous problem for poultry, Anthrax affects cattle, and <b>Classical</b> and African <b>swine</b> <b>fever</b> affect pigs. Overall, the performances of this sub-sector are poor, with the exception of some filières (milk, small animals).|$|R

40|$|We have {{developed}} a system of porcine {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} for the synthesis of antibodies in vitro, induced by partially purified African <b>swine</b> <b>fever</b> virus particles inactivated with formaldehyde. The antibodies synthesized were detected by a radioimmunoassay with a sensitivity of 3 ng of immunoglobulin. Primary responses were dependent on supernatants from peripheral blood mononuclear cells incubated with concanavalin A, macrophages and T lymphocytes. Secondary responses did not require concanavalin A-conditioned medium. The kinetics of antibody synthesis was similar in both primary and secondary responses, but the extent of synthesis was four to five times larger in the secondary than in the primary response. The antibodies synthesized in vitro were specific for African <b>swine</b> <b>fever</b> virus antigens (and did not react with viral antigen other than that from African <b>swine</b> <b>fever</b> virus particles), in contrast to pokeweed mitogen-induced antibodies, which reacted with all the antigens tested. African <b>swine</b> <b>fever</b> virus-induced antibodies did not neutralize the virus. These results and the inability of the virus to stimulate a primary response in the absence of concanavalin A supernatants indicate that inactivated African <b>swine</b> <b>fever</b> virus is not a polyclonal stimulator...|$|R

40|$|Long-term {{persistent}} infection {{was established}} in 100 % of pigs (n = 19) experimentally infected with African <b>swine</b> <b>fever</b> virus (ASFV). Viral DNA was detected in peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes (PBML) at greater than 500 days postinfection by a PCR assay. Infectious virus was not, however, isolated from the same PBML samples. In cell fractionation studies of PBML, monocytes/macrophages were found to harbor viral DNA during the persistent phase of infection. This result indicates that monocytes/macrophages are persistently infected with ASFV and that ASFV-swine monocyte/macrophage interactions can result in either lytic or persistent infection.
