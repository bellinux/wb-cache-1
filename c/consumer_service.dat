2500|$|Voddler is a Stockholm, Sweden-based {{provider}} of a video-on-demand (VOD) platform and a streaming technology for over-the-top (OTT) streaming {{on the public}} Internet. In Scandinavia, Voddler is primarily known for the commercial VOD-service Voddler, which was launched in 2009. As a company, Voddler was founded in 2005 and developed its own streaming solution, called Vnet. Vnet is based on peer-to-peer (p2p), where all users contribute by streaming movies to each other, but, unlike traditional p2p, Vnet has a central administrator who decides which users that have access to which movies. Due to this exception, Vnet {{has been referred to}} as a [...] "hybrid p2p distribution system", [...] "walled garden p2p" [...] or [...] "controlled p2p". In addition to running the <b>consumer</b> <b>service</b> Voddler, the company Voddler also offers, since 2013, Vnet as a stand-alone technology for other streaming platforms.
