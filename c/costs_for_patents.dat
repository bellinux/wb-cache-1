40|$|The non-effectiveness {{of certain}} codified {{human rights is}} {{particularly}} apparent {{with reference to the}} lack of access to essential drugs in developing countries, which represents a breach of the human right to receive adequate health assistance. This paper underlines the conflict and the legal contradictions between human rights, namely health rights, international Intellectual Property Rights, in particular patent law, as well as international trade law. The paper discusses the crucial links between R&D <b>costs</b> <b>for</b> innovation, <b>patents</b> and new medical drugs, with the goal of reformulating the hierarchies of priorities and of interests at stake in the international intellectual property (IP) law system. Different from what happens today, International patent law should be a legal instrument apt at rebalancing an axiological asymmetry between the (conflicting) needs at stake The core argument in the paper is the proposal of an alternative pathway, namely a feasible proposal <b>for</b> a <b>patent</b> law reform. IP laws tend to balance the benefits deriving from innovation with the costs of the provided monopoly, but since developing countries and industrialized countries are in completely different political and economic situations, it is necessary to (re) modulate such exchange according to the different needs. Based on this critical analysis, the paper puts forward a proposal, called Trading Time for Space (TTS), whereby a longer time <b>for</b> <b>patent</b> exclusive life in western countries (Time) is offered to the patent holder company, in exchange for the latter selling the medical drug at cost price in developing countries (Space). Accordingly, pharmaceutical companies should sell drugs in developing countries at the cost price, or alternatively grant a free license for the sale in such countries, without any royalties or fees. However, such social service shall be duly compensated. Therefore, the consideration for such a service shall be an extension of the temporal duration of the patent’s exclusive in the country of origin that will compensate the reduced profits caused by the supply at the price cost in developing countries...|$|R

40|$|The Chinese Patent Office {{published}} {{its first}} issue of the Official Gazette of Patents and pamphlets of applications on 10 September 1985. Adding the new contents in the Chinese patent documents to the treasure house of world patent information will benefit China {{and the rest of}} the world as well. Some explanations on the newly published Chinese patent documents are briefly introduced in the article. After the entering into force of the Chinese Patent Law on 1 April 1985, expectation from both domestic enthusiasts and friends abroad has been centering on such questions as: Can the Chinese Patent Law run smoothly? When will the Chinese Patent Office have their patent documents published? What sort of information will be disclosed in the first batch of publications? Some answers to these doubts were provided at a news conference held by the Chinese Patent Office on 10 September 1985. On that day, the Chinese Patent Office published its {{first issue of}} Official Gazette of <b>Patents</b> <b>for</b> Inventions (Fig. 1), Official Gazette of <b>Patents</b> <b>for</b> Utility Models (Fig. 2) and Official Gazette of <b>Patents</b> <b>for</b> Designs (Fig. 3) annoucing the decision to publish the first batch of its applications <b>for</b> <b>patents</b> <b>for</b> inventions examined by the Patent Office in conformity with the prescriptions of Article 39 of the Patent Law, and the first batch of its applications <b>for</b> <b>patents</b> <b>for</b> utility models and designs after preliminary examination in conformity with the prescriptions of Article 40 of the Patent Law. On that day, the Chinese Patent Office did simultaneously publish the unesamined applications for inventions, the examined applications <b>for</b> <b>patents</b> <b>for</b> inventions and the applications <b>for</b> <b>patents</b> <b>for</b> utility models. It is an important step <b>for</b> the Chinese <b>Patent</b> Office to publish the applications <b>for</b> <b>patents</b> before patents are granted and to let anyone have the chance to file an opposition to them, in order that the quality of examination and granting of patents may be assured. In fact, the Chinese Patent Office describes the opposition procedure as a good way to combine the examination of patents by professionals and by the public. If no oppositions are filed in conformity with the Law, patent right shall be granted to all these announced applications <b>for</b> <b>patents.</b> Up to the end of September 1985, the Chinese Patent Office had all together received 10 751 applications <b>for</b> <b>patents,</b> of which 6602 are applications <b>for</b> <b>patents</b> <b>for</b> inventions taking 61. 4 % of the total, 3686 are applications <b>for</b> <b>patents</b> <b>for</b> utility models, taking 34. 3 % of the total, and 463 are applications <b>for</b> <b>patents</b> <b>for</b> designs, taking 4. 3 % of the total. Of the total number of applications <b>for</b> <b>patents,</b> 7138 are filed by Chinese nationals, taking 66. 4 % of the whole number, and 3613 are filed by foreigners, taking 33. 6 % of the whole number. The publication of patent documents signifies that China has taken a substantive step forward in the implementation of the Patent Law. From that day on, China began to have its own patent documents which will form a complete set of informative and publicly available technical files, and searching was dependent on the text alone for selection. This difference alone may account for much of the difference in the outcomes. This issue will be analyzed more fully when the USPTO conducts more comprehensive analyses in the course of the evaluation of its Automated Patent System. ...|$|R

40|$|Paying {{the fees}} <b>for</b> <b>patents</b> is expensive. Therefore, a {{selection}} {{has to be}} made on which patent applications should be submitted and which not, and where. This is because each country has its own IP system and its own fees. Moreover, what kind of strategy is to be considered for licensing, if any. The study is concentrated or limited mainly to patents. Trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, although they constitute IP elements too, they will not be treated in detail in this study. The reason is because there is that there is not only a sheer size of the scholar literature regarding these other systems, but in addition, I find that deeper details may be assured in discussing <b>patents,</b> <b>for</b> the given limit of the thesis length. The study is mainly theoretical; it shall discuss in detail the issues and strategies that the companies might like to adapt when dealing with intellectual property. The research methodology is literature survey, for which the latest trends in intellectual property have been searched for and described using the web search tools of the library ([URL] accessed August 2014), NTNU library s books and the Google Scholar search engine ([URL] accessed August 2014). The departing point of the study is Chapter 1, with the history of patents, costs implied by patents, challenges of IP systems, reasons why companies apply <b>for</b> <b>patents,</b> presentation of the situation of the patent market, its contributors and influence, its development and its trends, some thoughts on the value of patents and what patents can not do. Then, the various options of the IP holders and IP non-holders are presented in Chapter 2. Also, various views of the IP strategy are presented, such as the analogy with the military strategy, and the high tempo patent strategy or IP strategies {{at the level of the}} organization. In chapter 3, various patent-related peculiarities of different geographical locations are presented together with methods of negotiation, issues of interest <b>for</b> <b>patents</b> <b>for</b> the respective markets and personal opinions, without considering the implied costs of the respective IP systems. The conclusions and the personal proposal of the processes IP framework are presented in Chapter 4. Chapter 5 mentions the references. The major finding of the study is that there is no perfect IP strategy, but rather best is to consider an adaptable IP strategy, continuously tuned to the environment. Among the recommendations that I formulated, alternative dispute resolutions should be included in the licensing contract, to avoid costly litigation situations. Moreover, I observed that it is very important to spend the time to create and continuously update a database of patents and patents applications, to avoid unnecessary <b>costs</b> <b>for</b> ongoing <b>patents</b> or risking a lapse of patents. In addition, patenting in all 196 countries of the world is too expensive to be an option to consider in practice. An idea that I did not see mentioned in literature is having a patent of a solution that is not to be sold in practice. This ensures continuous revenues from the competition, as it would be more cost-effective for it to send payments to the patent owner compared to shifting upwards processes & equipment to the newer technology. A summary of the top 50 IP strategy mistakes presented by Duncan Bucknell, an experienced IP broker from Australia, is offered in Table 3 in the Appendix. For non-IP holders, some observations that I make are that if they consider disseminating rapidly, they should probably consider an IP insurance. I consider that lapsed patents may present themselves with unthought opportunities, together with startups that are based on a specific technology. For various reasons (timing in market, marketing, finances, legislation, risks), startups might not be successful, even if their core patented technologies are extremely promising. Here I think comes the opportunity for the non-IP holder to acquire the patents of interest, or license them, or use the respective information freely, if the patents were lapsed because the maintenance fees were not covered...|$|R
