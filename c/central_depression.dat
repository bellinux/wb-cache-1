These include cup and ring marks, a <b>central</b> <b>depression</b> carved into stone, surrounded by rings, sometimes not completed. These are common elsewhere in Atlantic Europe {{and have been}} found on natural rocks and isolated stones across Scotland. The most elaborate sets of markings are in western Scotland, particularly in the Kilmartin district. The representations of an axe and a boat at the Ri Cruin Cairn in Kilmartin, and a boat pecked into Wemyss Cave, {{are believed to be}} the oldest known representations of real objects that survive in Scotland. Carved spirals have also been found on the cover stones of burial cists in Lanarkshire and Kincardine.|$|E
5|$|Production {{is still}} {{specialized}} in horticultural goods, {{but most of}} the masseiras were substituted by greenhouses and a significant share of the production is exported to other Western European markets. Póvoa de Varzim is part of the ancient Vinho Verde winemaking region, and there is commercial wine production, however local masseira wines are not commercially produced. The inland valley region is committed to milk production and the Agros corporation headquarters of Lactogal, the largest dairy products and milk producer company in the Iberian Peninsula, is located in Espaço Agros and has several departments such as exhibition park and laboratories. In agriculture, the masseira farm fields were developed. This technique increases agricultural yields by using large, rectangular depressions dug into sand dunes, with the spoil piled up into banks surrounding the depression. Grapes are cultivated on the banks to the south, east and west, and trees and reeds on the northern slope act as a windbreak against the prevailing northern wind. Garden crops are grown in the <b>central</b> <b>depression.</b>|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the data from}} the successful use of three non-intrusive surveys that created the first complete topographic and subsurface map of the Dorset Palaeoeskimo site of Phillip’s Garden, Port au Choix, Newfoundland. From this map the number of identified potential dwellings was increased to 198 from the previously recorded 68 dwellings (Renouf 2011 a: 132). In addition to increasing the dwelling numbers, distribution trends were identified that challenge the previous concepts of spatial, social and chronological organisation of Phillip’s Garden. Furthermore, the ratio of excavated <b>central</b> <b>depressions</b> to the total area of excavated dwelling structure was identified which could lead to a potential chronology for <b>central</b> <b>depressions...</b>|$|R

40|$|Fifty-four new {{heat flow}} {{measurements}} {{in the central}} troughs of the Guaymas basin {{support the hypothesis that}} they are sites of active intrusion. In the northern trough a distinct pattern of hydrothermal cooling is revealed, with venting along the western boundary fault of the trough. In the southern trough an analogous pattern is apparently superimposed upon a conductive cooling anomaly associated with a recent central intrusion. The discharge of thermal waters occurs along the boundary faults and through other faults associated with a possible horst block located in the north central floor of the southern trough. The heat flow patterns suggest that the intrusions are episodic and do not occur simultaneously along the length (15 – 40 km) of a spreading segment. A review of all available heat flow measurements for the Guaymas basin suggests that most of the recharge for a pervasive regional hydrothermal system is limited to the <b>central</b> <b>depressions,</b> with perhaps some contribution from pore water. The discharge of thermal waters occurs predominantly in the <b>central</b> <b>depressions</b> and possibly along the boundary transform faults and fracture zones. The regions of the basin more than a few kilometers in distance from the spreading axis, although presumably underlain by a hydrothermal system, are probably not the location of numerous vents or recharge zones...|$|R

The Pacific Coast Plains is a strip of land parallel to the ocean. It is composed mostly of sediment from the mountains that border it on the northern side. It is uniformly flat, and stretches from the Bernal Mountain south to Tonalá. It has deep salty soils due to its proximity to the sea.

25|$|The Chilean relief {{consists}} of the <b>central</b> <b>depression,</b> which crosses the country longitudinally, flanked by two mountain ranges that make up about 80% of the territory: the Andes mountains to the east-natural border with Bolivia and Argentina, with its most alton 18 located on the Nevado Ojos del Salado, at 6891.3 m, the highest volcano in the world, {{in the region of}} Atacama and Coastal Range west-minor height from the Andes, with its highest point located on the hill Vicuña Mackenna, at 3114 meters, located in the Sierra Vicuña Mackenna, the south of Antofagasta. Among the coastal mountains and the Pacific is a series of coastal plains, of variable length, which allow the settlement of coastal towns and big ports. Some areas of the plains territories encompass territory east of the Andes, and the Patagonian steppes and Magellan, or are high plateaus surrounded by high mountain ranges, such as the Altiplano or Puna de Atacama.|$|E

25|$|L. glyciosmus is a {{small to}} {{medium-sized}} agaric, which typically has a convex cap measuring between 2 and 5.5 centimetres, with a small <b>central</b> <b>depression</b> developing with age. Sometimes there is a central pimple, and the cap is typically coloured a greyish lilac, sometimes varying to a pale buff. It is thin fleshed, with an incurved margin in younger specimens. The stem measures between 25 and 65 millimetres in height, with a width between 4 and 12 millimetres. The cylindrical stem is typically widest at the bottom becoming narrower towards the top, or sometimes club shaped. The stem is concolorous with the cap, but sometimes is a little paler or with a yellowish hue. The stem is particularly soft and easily broken, and can become hollow. The flesh is buff. The gills are decurrent and crowded, and vary in colour from a pale yellowish to a pale flesh, turning to a greyish lilac with age. The milk is white with an initially mild, later hot and acrid taste. The mushroom has a strong smell of coconuts.|$|E

40|$|Spatial geochemical {{variations}} of Quaternary lavas erupted {{along the northern}} segment of the Kamchatka arc are used to trace changes in magma generation across the subducting Pacific slab edge. The late Pleistocene–Holocene lavas of {{the northern end of}} the <b>Central</b> Kamchatka <b>depression</b> north of the Pacific slab edge show strong enrichment in high field strength elements and light rare earth elements, relatively unradiogenic strontium and lead but radiogenic neodymium isotope ratios, and oxygen isotope compositions similar to those of mid-oceanic-ridge basalts. These geochemical characteristics are distinct from the southern <b>Central</b> Kamchatka <b>depression</b> volcanoes located above the subducting Pacific slab. Extensive fluid-triggered mantle melting dominates magma genesis beneath the largest Kamchatka volcanoes in the south, whereas low-degree decompression melting of the Pacific asthenospheric mantle is the major magma generation process north of the Pacific slab edge. Quaternary detachment of the subducted Pacific plate fragment resulted in the influx of fertile mantle beneath Kamchatka. We propose that upwelling and southward flow of this hotter, more fertile mantle is the main reason for recent magmatism in northern Kamchatka and for the exceptional productivity of the <b>Central</b> Kamchatka <b>depression</b> volcanoes (Klyuchevskoy and Sheveluch), the most active arc volcanoes on Earth...|$|R

30|$|The Gaoyou Depression {{is located}} in the <b>central</b> Dongtai <b>Depression</b> with an area of about 2.7  ×  103 km 2. It is {{characteristic}} of a dustpan-like depression (Chen 2001; Zeng 2007; Zhu et al. 2013; Fig.  1 c, d) resulting from the differential subsidence of fault blocks during the Yizheng Movement in the Late Cretaceous and the Wubao Movement in the Late Paleocene (Chen 2001). The Gaoyou Depression is bounded to the south by the Zhenwu fault belt (separating it from the Tongyang uplift), and links to the Zheduo low uplift through a slope in the north (Fig.  1 c). The western and eastern boundaries are the Lingtangqiao low uplift and the Wubao low uplift, respectively (Fig.  1 c). Due to the influence of Indian and Pacific plate movements, there are three groups of fractures (ENE, NE, and NW orientations) developed in the Gaoyou Depression, with those oriented ENE dominant. These ENE faults (Zhen 1, Zhen 2, and Hanliu faults) separate the Gaoyou Depression into three ENE trending sections from south to north: southern step-fault zone, <b>central</b> deep <b>depression</b> zone, and northern slope zone (Qiu et al. 2006; Chen 2001; Fig.  1 c).
