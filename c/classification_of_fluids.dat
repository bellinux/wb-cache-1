When these gels collect on aircraft flight control surfaces in aerodynamically quiet areas and freeze, they give rise to reduced performance, increased stick force, slowed rotation and have caused jammed flight controls. Laboratory tests have been developed to simulate the gel formation by drying out fluids and rehydrating them. However, by their complex nature, much variation is seen between test results from different laboratories and the results are not yet considered by fluid users. Testing carried out at AMIL on different fluids with different test methods has led to a more reproducible results and a potential <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>fluids</b> based on their gel formation potential (GFP). It was found that complete dryout of the fluid, steady immersion, plate etching, wait times, oven temperature, and number of fluid immersions are important factors to the reproducibility of the test method. While, bubbles in the test sample, fluid dilutions, fluid viscosity and weight of the dryout residues had little effect on the tests results. From this study, a classification of the fluids into three categories is proposed: (1) high GFP, (2) high GFP that rinses off and (3) low GFP. Finally, the effect of Type I rinses and runway deicing fluids on gel residues was also examined...|$|E

ABSTRACT: Fluid classification is {{a critical factor in}} decision of reservoir and production problems. Reservoir fluid can be classified into five types according to laboratory and production data as black oil, volatile oil, gas condensate, wet gas and dry gas. In this work a novel application of Neural Networks (ANN) is presented. Based on production and laboratory data neural networks model is developed for automatic <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> reservoir <b>FLUID.</b> More than 450 samples of five types <b>of</b> reservoir <b>fluids</b> are used to develop the neural network model. About 70 % of data are accepted for neural network training, 15 % for validation and 15 % are used as test set. The importance <b>of</b> different input <b>fluid</b> properties in classification was studied. The different types of architectures for different groups of input data were tested to select the optimal neural network architecture by fitness criteria. The optimized neural network model was capable of classifying the reservoir fluids with high accuracy. The performance of ANNs models was determined by classification quality index and network error. The model has been applied successfully to <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> Yemeni <b>fluids</b> using different range of parameters.

In this study, various spray structures under the effect of hydrodynamic cavitation were recorded using a high speed visualization system.

Manual collection of NAF for cytologic evaluation varies widely in terms of efficacy, ease of use, and patient acceptance. We investigated a new automated device for the non-invasive collection of NAF in the office setting. Methods A multi-center prospective observational clinical trial involving asymptomatic women designed to assess fluid production, adequacy, safety and patient acceptance of the HALO NAF Collection System (NeoMatrix, Irvine, CA). Cytologic evaluation of all NAF samples was performed using previously described classification categories. Results 500 healthy women were successfully enrolled. Thirty-eight percent (190 / 500) produced fluid and 187 were available for cytologic analysis. Cytologic <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>fluid</b> producers showed 50 % (93 / 187) Category 0 (insufficient cellular material), 38 % (71 / 187) Category I (benign non-hyperplastic ductal epithelial cells), 10 % (18 / 187) Category II (benign hyperplastic ductal epithelial cells), 3 % (5 / 187) Category III (atypical ductal epithelial cells) and none were Category IV (unequivocal malignancy).

40|$|Tobacco {{products}} {{are composed of}} {{a great variety of}} constituents. Nicotine, 1 -methyl- 2 (3 -pyridyl) pyrrolidine, is a highly toxic major alkaloid found in tobacco plants and plays an important etiological {{role in the development of}} human carcinogenesis. Nicotine is also accused of the addictive potential of smoking, being classified by the Drug Abuse Advisory Committee as an addictive substance. Carbon dioxide has been extensively used for the removal of nicotine from tobacco leaves in the production of new cigarettes with reduced nicotine content. Although detailed knowledge of phase behaviour is most important for the design of any separation process, solubility of nicotine in sub/supercritical CO 2 seems to have been scarcely studied. Reported measurements are restricted to the temperatures of 313 and 343 K, and covering a range of pressures of 0. 9 – 8 MPa and 0. 9 – 16 MPa, respectively. In this work we present a phase behaviour study of the CO 2 -nicotine binary system at 313. 1 K, in a pressure range of 6 to 9 MPa. The phase equilibrium measurements were performed using an apparatus that employs a high-pressure sapphire cell and allows sampling of both vapour and liquid phases. From the experimental work, it could be concluded that, according to the Scott and Van Konynenburg <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>fluid</b> phase equilibria, the system nicotine + CO 2 most likely shows type-V fluid phase behaviour. The characteristic of this type of phase behaviour is a three-phase (VLL) equilibrium, with a discontinuous critical curve.

These data may help in further studies on sub/supercritical CO 2 extraction of nicotine from nicotine-containing products...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} the thermal stability of three representative hydrocarbons used as working fluids in organic Rankine cycles (ORC) : n-pentane, cyclo-pentane and toluene. The experimental used method is a ‘‘static” one, {{based on the}} recording of the pressure during the permanence <b>of</b> the <b>fluid</b> sample at constant temperature and on {{the measure of the}} differences in the vapour pressure in comparison with the reference values for the virgin pure fluid. The sample container and the circuit are in stainless steel. The decomposition was estimated by a parameter based on the mean value of differences in the sub-atmospheric vapour pressures at selected temperatures. The increase of the vapour pressure resulting from even a small thermal decomposition (more noticeable at sub-atmospheric pressures) is an important indicator as it may anyway have great effects on the engine in which the fluid works. The adopted procedure is relatively simple and may be applied to different fluids and to different families <b>of</b> <b>fluids</b> and the results are significant in the comparison and in the relative <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> working <b>fluids</b> with regards to their thermal stability. As to the three hydrocarbons considered, the cyclo-pentane results thermally very stable: at 350 °C, after eighty hours, the rate of decomposition is about twenty times lower than the corresponding value for n-pentane. The toluene sample remains remarkably stable at higher temperatures, confirming its potential application in the so-called high temperature Rankine cycles: at 400 °C the rate of decomposition is the same of that of n-pentane at 315 °C and of that of cyclo-pentane at 375 °C...|$|R

Objectives: To determine the validity <b>of</b> pleural <b>fluid</b> (high sensitivity-CRP) concentration in etiologic diagnosis of pleural effusion and to obtain a cut-off value <b>of</b> pleural <b>fluid</b> CRP at which we can discriminate between exudative and transudative pleural effusions. Patients and methods: A study was conducted upon a hundred patients with pleural effusion. All patients were subjected to: history, clinical examination, chest radiography and thoracic ultrasound, tuberculin test and aspiration <b>of</b> pleural <b>fluid.</b> The fluid was sent for biochemical examination including: Protein, L. D. H, A. D.

Data were compared by independent sample t-test for 2 groups or by a {{one-way analysis of variance}} (ANOVA) for more than 2 groups of variables. Simple correlations between variables were examined by calculating Pearson’s product correlation coefficient, Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve used to calculate cut off points, area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity, and 2 tailed P <  0. 05 was considered significant. Results: There were significant differences between both groups as regards serum, fluid levels and fluid/serum ratio for LDH, total protein and CRP except for CRP fluid/serum ratio. There was a significant correlation between CRP and LDH and total protein fluid levels. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to calculate the sensitivity and specificity <b>of</b> CRP <b>fluid</b> level and also the cut off value <b>of</b> CRP <b>fluid</b> level. Out <b>of</b> the 44 patients with exudative pleural effusion, two cases were diagnosed as cardiac effusion and one case as liver cirrhosis.

Conclusion: CRP could be a useful diagnostic marker for differentiation between exudative and transudative pleural effusions and also it is more accurate than protein in distinguishing those transudative effusions receiving diuretic therapy which are falsely diagnosed by Light’s criteria to be exudates...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackgroundClassification of {{effusion}} into transudates or exudates {{is considered}} as the corner {{stone in the}} etiological diagnosis of pleural effusion. ObjectivesTo determine the validity <b>of</b> pleural <b>fluid</b> (high sensitivity-CRP) concentration in etiologic diagnosis of pleural effusion and to obtain a cut-off value <b>of</b> pleural <b>fluid</b> CRP at which we can discriminate between exudative and transudative pleural effusions. Patients and methodsA study was conducted upon a hundred patients with pleural effusion. All patients were subjected to: history, clinical examination, chest radiography and thoracic ultrasound, tuberculin test and aspiration <b>of</b> pleural <b>fluid.</b> The fluid was sent for biochemical examination including: Protein, L. D. H, A. D. A and CRP levels, cytological examination and bacteriologic examination. <b>Classification</b> <b>of</b> pleural <b>fluid</b> into transudative or exudative is based upon Light’s criteria. Data were compared by independent sample t-test for 2 groups or by a {{one-way analysis of variance}} (ANOVA) for more than 2 groups of variables. Simple correlations between variables were examined by calculating Pearson’s product correlation coefficient, Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve used to calculate cut off points, area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity, and 2 tailed P< 0. 05 was considered significant. ResultsThere were significant differences between both groups as regards serum, fluid levels and fluid/serum ratio for LDH, total protein and CRP except for CRP fluid/serum ratio. There was a significant correlation between CRP and LDH and total protein fluid levels. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to calculate the sensitivity and specificity <b>of</b> CRP <b>fluid</b> level and also the cut off value <b>of</b> CRP <b>fluid</b> level. Out <b>of</b> the 44 patients with exudative pleural effusion, two cases were diagnosed as cardiac effusion and one case as liver cirrhosis. The three cases were receiving diuretics and the pleural fluid analysis was repeated after withdrawal of the diuretics which turned to be transudative according to Light’s criteria. ConclusionCRP could be a useful diagnostic marker for differentiation between exudative and transudative pleural effusions and also it is more accurate than protein in distinguishing those transudative effusions receiving diuretic therapy which are falsely diagnosed by Light’s criteria to be exudates...|$|R
