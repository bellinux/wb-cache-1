5|$|For finite-dimensional representations, the {{presence}} of semisimplicity means that the Lorentz group {{can be dealt with}} the same way as other semisimple groups using a well-developed theory. In addition, all representations are built from the irreducible ones, since the Lie algebra possesses the complete reducibility property. But, the non-compactness of the Lorentz group, in combination with lack of simple <b>connectedness,</b> cannot be dealt with in all the aspects as in the simple framework that applies to simply connected, compact groups. Non-compactness implies, for a connected simple Lie group, that no nontrivial finite-dimensional unitary representations exist. Lack of simple <b>connectedness</b> gives rise to spin representations of the group. The non-connectedness means that, for representations of the full Lorentz group, time reversal and space inversion has to dealt with separately.|$|E

Consequently, {{the practice of the}} weapons arts gives insight into the origin of techniques and movements, and reinforces the concepts of distance, timing, foot movement, presence and <b>connectedness</b> with one's training partner(s).|$|E
5|$|As {{noted by}} Pavel Alexandrov and Hermann Weyl in their obituaries, Noether's {{contributions}} to topology illustrate her generosity with ideas and how her insights could transform entire fields of mathematics. In topology, mathematicians study {{the properties of}} objects that remain invariant even under deformation, properties such as their <b>connectedness.</b> A common joke is that a topologist cannot distinguish a donut from a coffee mug, since they can be continuously deformed into one another.|$|E
5|$|Limousins in {{different}} countries are bred according to different selection practices or objectives, and are connected by limited international gene flows. Poor genetic <b>connectedness</b> between countries has negative implications for estimation accuracies of international genetic prediction programmes. As a result of genetic drift or different selection, each country's population of Limousins is becoming genetically differentiated, but which is counterbalanced to a limited extent by gene flows from other countries. A study of over 2.4million Limousin pedigree files of five European countries (France, Denmark, Ireland, Sweden, United Kingdom) showed moderate gene flows from France to the United Kingdom and Denmark, but negligible gene flows to Sweden. Except for gene flows originating from France, and some limited gene flows between Denmark and Sweden in the 1990s, bull and semen exchanges between European countries has been scarce, especially since about 2000. Cow and embryo flows {{have been even more}} scarce. Conversely, the genetic contribution of North American Limousins to European countries has increased since the late 1990s, which has occurred because of their use in breeding programmes to introduce the polled gene.|$|E
25|$|Other {{researchers}} {{describe the}} nature <b>connectedness</b> construct in a simpler manner. For instance, nature <b>connectedness</b> {{can be thought}} of as a love of nature (also referred to as emotional affinity toward nature). Similarly, nature <b>connectedness</b> can be defined as how much a person believes they are the same as nature (more specifically, a person's connectivity with nature) or it {{can be thought of}} as simply feeling emotionally connected with nature. Nature <b>connectedness</b> (as a construct) is also known as nature relatedness, connectivity with nature, emotional affinity toward nature, or inclusion of nature in self.|$|E

25|$|A cyberpsychology {{research}} {{study conducted by}} Australian researchers demonstrated {{that a number of}} positive psychological outcomes are related to Facebook use. These researchers established that people can derive a sense of social <b>connectedness</b> and belongingness in the online environment. Importantly, this online social <b>connectedness</b> was associated with lower levels of depression and anxiety, and greater levels of subjective well-being. These findings suggest that the nature of online social networking determines the outcomes of online social network use.|$|E
25|$|Lie {{groups are}} {{classified}} {{according to their}} algebraic properties (simple, semisimple, solvable, nilpotent, abelian), their <b>connectedness</b> (connected or simply connected) and their compactness.|$|E
25|$|Several scales {{have been}} created to measure how {{connected}} an individual feels to nature. The three main scales are: Nature Relatedness, Nature <b>Connectedness,</b> and Inclusion of Nature in Self Scale.|$|E

25|$|Some US states, such as California (see the California Mental Health Services Act), Wisconsin and Ohio, already report {{redesigning}} {{their mental}} health systems to stress recovery model values like hope, healing, empowerment, social <b>connectedness,</b> human rights, and recovery-oriented services.|$|E
25|$|Topology is {{also used}} to refer to a {{structure}} imposed upon a set X, a structure that essentially 'characterizes' the set X as a topological space by taking proper care of properties such as convergence, <b>connectedness</b> and continuity, upon transformation.|$|E
25|$|In {{the latter}} part of the twentieth century, {{research}} trends shifted to more intense study of spaces like manifolds which are locally well understood (being locally homeomorphic to Euclidean space) but have complicated global behavior. By this it is meant that although the basic point-set topology of manifolds is relatively simple (as manifolds are essentially metrizable according to most definitions of the concept), their algebraic topology is far more complex. From this modern perspective, the stronger property of local path <b>connectedness</b> turns out to be more important: for instance, in order for a space to admit a universal cover it must be connected and locally path connected. Local path <b>connectedness</b> will be discussed as well.|$|E
25|$|General topology, {{also called}} point-set topology, {{establishes}} the foundational aspects of topology and investigates properties of topological spaces and concepts inherent to topological spaces. It defines the basic notions used {{in all other}} branches of topology (including concepts like compactness and <b>connectedness).</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{topology}} {{and related}} branches of mathematics, a connected space is a topological space that cannot be represented as {{the union of}} two or more disjoint nonempty open subsets. <b>Connectedness</b> is one of the principal topological properties that are used to distinguish topological spaces.|$|E
25|$|According to the Torah, {{the tribe}} {{consisted}} of descendants of Naphtali, {{a son of}} Jacob and Bilhah, from whom it took its name. However, Biblical scholars view this as a postdiction, an eponymous metaphor providing an aetiology of the <b>connectedness</b> of the tribe {{to others in the}} Israelite confederation.|$|E
25|$|The {{dynamical}} {{formula for}} the uniformisation of the complement of the Mandelbrot set, arising from Douady and Hubbard's {{proof of the}} <b>connectedness</b> of , gives rise to external rays of the Mandelbrot set.

25|$|The {{construct}} of nature <b>connectedness</b> is {{also related to}} a branch of psychology called ecopsychology. This branch seeks to examine how human well-being {{is related to the}} well-being of the natural environment. This theory is {{based on the idea that}} the needs of humans and nature are interdependent so human health will suffer if nature does as well.|$|E
25|$|Research {{has shown}} an inverse link between income {{inequality}} and social cohesion. In more equal societies, people {{are much more}} likely to trust each other, measures of social capital (the benefits of goodwill, fellowship, mutual sympathy and social <b>connectedness</b> among groups who make up a social units) suggest greater community involvement, and homicide rates are consistently lower.|$|E
25|$|If K is a field, {{then the}} ring R = K/(wy,wz,xy,xz) (the {{coordinate}} {{ring of the}} union of two planes meeting in a point) is reduced and equidimensional, but not Cohen–Macaulay. To prove that, one can use Hartshorne's <b>connectedness</b> theorem: if R is a Cohen–Macaulay local ring of dimension at least 2, then Spec R minus its closed point is connected.|$|E
25|$|Youth {{empowerment}} {{programs are}} aimed at creating healthier and higher qualities of life for underprivileged or at-risk youth. The five competencies of a healthy youth are: (1) positive sense of self, (2) self- control, (3) decision-making skills, (4) a moral system of belief, and (5) pro-social <b>connectedness.</b> Developmental interventions and programs have to be anchored on these competencies that define positive outcomes of healthy youth.|$|E
25|$|These three {{components}} make up nature <b>connectedness</b> and {{are required for}} a healthy relationship with nature. If an individual feels connected to nature (possibly by spending time in it), {{they may be more}} inclined to care about nature, and protect the environment. Recent research has found that nature exposure (and feeling connected to nature at a trait level) provides many benefits to humans such as well-being.|$|E
25|$|If clause {{expansion}} is restricted by <b>connectedness</b> (either strong or weak), its application produces a tableau in which substitution can applied {{to one of}} the new leaves, closing its branch. In particular, this is the leaf containing the literal of the clause that unifies with the negation of a literal in the branch (or the negation of the literal in the parent, in case of strong connection).|$|E
25|$|In mathematics, {{topology}} (from the Greek τόπος, place, and λόγος, study) {{is concerned}} with the properties of space that are preserved under continuous deformations, such as stretching, crumpling and bending, but not tearing or gluing. This can be studied by considering a collection of subsets, called open sets, that satisfy certain properties, turning the given set into what is known as a topological space. Important topological properties include <b>connectedness</b> and compactness.|$|E
25|$|Relationships {{are at the}} {{sentiment}} aspect of our lives; with our families at home and friends outside. Relationships interact in schools and universities, with work mates and, with colleagues at the workplace and in our diverse communities. In the article it states, the quality of these relationships determines our individual well-being, how well we learn, develop and function, our sense of <b>connectedness</b> with others and the health so society.|$|E
25|$|Finally, even subtle nature {{manipulations}} {{can increase}} well-being or other indicators of well-being. For instance, simply having plants {{in a lab}} can increase intrinsic aspirations, decrease extrinsic aspirations, and encourage more generous decision making. These effects were also mediated by nature <b>connectedness</b> and autonomy. Also, virtual nature {{has been found to}} provide some psychological benefits (but not as much as real nature). These studies demonstrate the positive relationship between nature exposure, feeling connected to nature, and subjective well-being.|$|E
25|$|Bradley's {{service to}} the country as {{assistant}} postmaster general is regarded as influential. Bradley's postal routes and schedules, enforced rigidly over a thirty-year period, gave the Post Office Department a rapid and reliable engine for delivering information across vast distances, instilling in citizens {{the importance of the}} <b>connectedness</b> they shared with their distant neighbors. The numerous maps Bradley published, while later discarded and redrawn by the new Jackson administration, created in their time a sense of the immensity of American territory.|$|E
25|$|Nature <b>connectedness</b> {{is related}} to {{subjective}} well-being and other indicators of positive functioning such as solving a problem in one's life. Subjective well-being is defined as feeling pleasant emotions or having pleasant experiences. To assess well-being, participants complete measures of how often they feel positive emotions (an affective measure), how often they feel negative emotions (an affective measure), and how satisfied they are with their lives (a cognitive measure). Individuals {{with higher levels of}} well-being typically indicate that they are satisfied with their lives, feel more positive emotions, and less negative emotions.|$|E
25|$|According to the Torah, {{the tribe}} {{consisted}} of descendants of Ephraim {{a son of}} Joseph, from whom it took its name; however some critical Biblical scholars view this also as postdiction, an eponymous metaphor providing an aetiology of the <b>connectedness</b> of the tribe {{to others in the}} Israelite confederation. In the Biblical account, Joseph is one of the two children of Rachel and Jacob, a brother to Benjamin, and father to both Ephraim, and his first son, Manasseh; Ephraim received the blessing of the firstborn, although Manasseh was the eldest, because Jacob foresaw that Ephraim's descendants would be greater than his brother's.|$|E
25|$|The {{fundamental}} {{concepts in}} point-set topology are continuity, compactness, and <b>connectedness.</b> Intuitively, continuous functions take nearby points to nearby points. Compact sets {{are those that}} can be covered by finitely many sets of arbitrarily small size. Connected sets are sets that cannot {{be divided into two}} pieces that are far apart. The words nearby, arbitrarily small, and far apart can all be made precise by using open sets. If we change the definition of open set, we change what continuous functions, compact sets, and connected sets are. Each choice of definition for open set is called a topology. A set with a topology is called a topological space.|$|E
25|$|Porosity (n) is a {{directly}} measurable aquifer property; it is {{a fraction}} between 0 and 1 indicating {{the amount of}} pore space between unconsolidated soil particles or within a fractured rock. Typically, the majority of groundwater (and anything dissolved in it) moves through the porosity available to flow (sometimes called effective porosity). Permeability {{is an expression of}} the <b>connectedness</b> of the pores. For instance, an unfractured rock unit may have a high porosity (it has lots of holes between its constituent grains), but a low permeability (none of the pores are connected). An example of this phenomenon is pumice, which, when in its unfractured state, can make a poor aquifer.|$|E
25|$|Community and {{equality}} are mutually reinforcing... Social capital and economic inequality moved in tandem {{through most of}} the twentieth century. In terms of the distribution of wealth and income, America in the 1950s and 1960s was more egalitarian {{than it had been in}} more than a century... hose same decades were also the high point of social <b>connectedness</b> and civic engagement. Record highs in equality and social capital coincided. Conversely, the last third of the twentieth century was a time of growing inequality and eroding social capital... The timing of the two trends is striking: somewhere around 1965–70 America reversed course and started becoming both less just economically and less well connected socially and politically.|$|E
