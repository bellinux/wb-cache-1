40|$|AbstractSmall {{regulatory}} RNAs {{are central}} {{players in the}} regulation of many cellular processes across all kingdoms of life. Experiments in mouse and human have shown that a typical small RNA may regulate the expression of many different genes, suggesting that small RNAs act as global regulators. It is noted though that most targets respond only weakly {{to the presence of}} the small RNA. At the same time, evidence in bacteria and animals suggest that the phenotypes associated with small RNA mutants are only due to a few of their targets. Here we assume that targets regulated by a small RNA to control function is in fact small, and propose that the role of the many other weak targets is to confer robustness to the regulation of these few principal targets. Through mathematical modeling we show that <b>auxiliary</b> <b>targets</b> may significantly buffer both number and kinetic fluctuations of the principal targets, with only minor slowdown in the kinetics of response. Analysis of genomic data suggests that <b>auxiliary</b> <b>targets</b> experience a nonspecific evolutionary pressure, playing a role at the system level.

As an example, W and Bi doping in reactive sputter deposition of Al 2 O 3 is analyzed. W is shown to be very efficient dopant which can increase the deposition rate for oxide up to 100 % with 1. 6 at. % of W in the resulting coating.

40|$|We {{propose a}} novel {{localized}} {{principal component analysis}} (PCA) based curve evolution approach which evolves the segmenting curve semi-locally within various target regions (divisions) in an image and then combines these locally accurate segmentation curves to obtain a global segmentation. The training data for our approach consists of training shapes and associated <b>auxiliary</b> (<b>target)</b> masks. The masks indicate the various regions of the shape exhibiting highly correlated variations locally which may be rather independent of the variations in the distant parts of the global shape. Thus, in a sense, we are clustering the variations exhibited in the training data set. We then use a parametric model to implicitly represent each localized segmentation curve as {{a combination of the}} local shape priors obtained by representing the training shapes and the masks as a collection of signed distance functions. We also propose a parametric model to combine the locally evolved segmentation curves into a single hybrid (global) segmentation. Finally, we combine the evolution of these semilocal and global parameters to minimize an objective energy function. The resulting algorithm thus provides a globally accurate solution, which retains the local variations in shape. We present some results to illustrate how our approach performs better than the traditional approach with fully global PCA. 1...|$|R

Cognitive science has proposed appraisal theory as a view on human emotion {{with previous research}} showing how human-rated abstract event features can predict fine-grained emotions and capture the similarity space of neural patterns in mentalizing brain regions. At the same time, natural language processing (NLP) has demonstrated how transfer and multitask learning {{can be used to}} cope with scarcity of annotated data for text modeling. The contribution of this work is to show that appraisal theory can be combined with NLP for mutual benefit. First, fine-grained emotion prediction can be improved to human-level performance by using NLP representations in addition to appraisal features. Second, using the appraisal features as <b>auxiliary</b> <b>targets</b> during training can improve predictions even when only text is available as input. Third, we obtain a representation with a similarity matrix that better correlates with the neural activity across regions. Best results are achieved when the model is trained to simultaneously predict appraisals, emotions and emojis using a shared representation.

Previous analyses have identified frequent aberrations occurring at 1 q 21 - 24. However, due to complex rearrangements it has been difficult to identify specific 1 q 21 - 24 target regions and genes. We selected 29 cases with 6 p and 37 cases with 1 q focal genomic amplifications from 261 cases of urothelial carcinoma analyzed by array-CGH for high resolution zoom-in oligonucleotide array analyses. Genomic analyses were combined with gene expression data and genomic sequence analyses to characterize and fine map 6 p 22 and 1 q 21 - 24 amplifications. We show that the most frequently amplified gene at 6 p 22 is SOX 4 and that SOX 4 can be amplified and overexpressed without the E 2 F 3 or CDKAL 1 genes being included in the amplicon. Hence, our data point to SOX 4 as an <b>auxiliary</b> amplification <b>target</b> at 6 p 22. We further show that at least three amplified regions are observed at 1 q 21 - 24.

We highlight enrichment of G 4 quadruplex sequence motifs and a high number of intraregional sequence duplications, both known to contribute to genomic instability, as prominent features of the 1 q 21 - 24 region. Our detailed analyses of the 6 p 22 amplicon suggest SOX 4 as an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>target</b> gene for amplification.

Overall, the optical properties of the 2 MASS red AGN are not dramatically different from those of optically-selected QSOs.

40|$|Tree-level {{scattering}} amplitudes in massless theories {{not only}} exhibit a simplicity entirely unexpected from Feynman diagrams, {{but also an}} underlying structure remarkably reminiscent of worldsheet theory correlators, yet essentially algebraic. These features {{can be explained by}} ambitwistor strings - two-dimensional chiral conformal field theories in an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>target</b> space, the complexified phase space of null geodesics, known as ambitwistor space. The aim of this thesis is to explore the ambitwistor string approach to understand these structures in amplitudes, and thereby provide a new angle on quantum field theories. In {{the first part of this}} thesis, the wide-ranging impact of ambitwistor strings on the study of tree-level amplitudes is highlighted in three developments: an extension of ambitwistor string worldsheet models to an extensive family of massless theories, emphasising the universality of ambitwistor strings for massless theories; a beautiful proof of the duality between asymptotic symmetries and the low energy behaviour of a theory, relying on the contact geometry of the ambitwistor target space; and finally a twistorial representation of ambitwistor strings in four dimensions, leading to remarkably simple formulae for scattering amplitudes in Yang-Mills and gravity with any degree of supersymmetry. The second part of this thesis focusses on proving a conjectured ambitwistor string formula for loop amplitudes, and extending the formalism to more general theories. Remarkably, residue theorems reduce the computationally challenging ambitwistor higher-genus expressions to simple formulae on nodal Riemann spheres. This idea is developed into a widely applicable framework for loop integrands, that is shown to be applicable to both supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric theories. In the case of supergravity, this provides strong evidence for the validity of the ambitwistor string at loop level, and explicit proofs are given for non-supersymmetric theories. Notably, this leads to a proposal for an all-loop integrand for gravity and Yang-Mills. </p...|$|R
40|$|Visual {{attributes}} can {{be considered}} as a middle-level semantic cue that bridges the gap between low-level image features and high-level object classes. Thus, attributes have the advantage of transcending specific semantic categories or describing objects across categories. Since attributes are often human-nameable and domain specific, much work constructs attribute annotations ad hoc or take them from an application-dependent ontology. To facilitate other applications with attributes, it is necessary to develop methods which can adapt a well-defined set of attributes to novel images. In this paper, we propose a framework for image attribute adaptation. The goal is to automatically adapt the knowledge of attributes from a well-defined auxiliary image set to a target image set, thus assisting in predicting appropriate attributes for target images. In the proposed framework, we use a non-linear mapping function corresponding to multiple base kernels to map each training images of both the <b>auxiliary</b> and the <b>target</b> sets to a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS), where we reduce the mismatch of data distributions between <b>auxiliary</b> and <b>target</b> images. In order to make use of un-labeled images, we incorporate a semi-supervised learning process. We also introduce a robust loss function into our framework to remove the shared irrelevance and noise of training images. Experiments on two couples of auxiliary-target image sets demonstrate that the proposed framework has better performance of predicting attributes for target testing images, compared to three baselines and two state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods...|$|R
