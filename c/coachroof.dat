5000|$|British Folkboat (various derivatives, mostly {{based on}} the Folkboat hull but with carvel, rather than clinker, construction, and mostly {{aspiring}} to greater living space below, via, for example, longer and/or wider <b>coachroof</b> designs, or an extra plank atop the basic hull) ...|$|E
50|$|The dinghy is {{generally}} carried inverted amidships on yachts,on {{top of the}} <b>coachroof</b> where there is the most space. It is useful for a dinghy carried this way to have handholds built into the bottom, making launching easier and providing handholds on deck.|$|E
5000|$|The O-38 was GRP-produced, in {{contrast}} to the 36s, which were built from wood. [...] The GRP hulls for the Ohlson 38 were laminated by the Tyler Boat Company Ltd. in Tonbridge, Kent in the United Kingdom and so were decks including the <b>coachroof.</b> The Ohlson Brothers (Bröderna Ohlson AB) in Västra Frolunda near Gothenburg finished boats primarily for the US market. [...] Other yards finished these boats, including Malö in Henån, Matthiessen und Paulsen in Arnis/Germany and Alexander Robertsons & Sons in Sandbank, Argyll, Scotland.|$|E
50|$|The Nordic Folkboat, as {{initially}} designed, {{is constructed}} of {{wood in the}} clinker or lap-strake method of boat building. The boat {{was designed to be}} built with oak framing and fir planking, although different builders used many different species of wood. The boat has an open cockpit and a low <b>coachroof</b> covering a small cabin usually consisting of two bunks and minimal storage furniture. The boat is rigged as a simple fractional sloop, with minimal standing rigging, consisting only of two lower shrouds, two jumper shrouds, a headstay, and a backstay. Despite the simplicity of the rigging, the mast is highly tunable, enabling the Folkboat to sail well in light and heavy air well beyond initial expectations.|$|E
50|$|On {{the small}} motor pinnace Arielle, a 13-metre boat {{propelled}} by a 65HP French made Baudouin diesel engine which sailed from New York to Le Havre in 1936, {{the task of}} steering a motor boat in the Atlantic swells was more daunting. Arielle had two rudders; the main one under the hull, in the propeller race, was for manual steering and the smaller auxiliary rudder was transom mounted. This auxiliary rudder could be mechanically driven by a special wind vane mounted atop of the <b>coachroof</b> consisting of two rectangular airfoils set at an angle on a vertical axle and balanced by a counterweight. It was simple and worked quite well, but could not steer the boat in very light breezes or flat calm.|$|E
50|$|As a Chartered Engineer, {{his first}} job came about when it was {{discovered}} that Denis Doyle's yacht Moonduster was floating above her 'marks', having been built less heavily than had been intended her designer, Germán Frers. Castro advised that lead be attached to the underside of the <b>coachroof</b> and had a hole drilled in the keel to reduce her stability, which gave the vessel an exceptionally good handicap for a boat of her size. Moonduster held the Round Ireland monohull record from Wicklow to Wicklow for nearly 15 years until the record was broken by a Whitbread around the World yacht. Her fastest elapsed time for the race came in 1984, when she took only 88h, 15m and 43s to complete the course.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, {{production}} of the Corribee moved to Newbridge Boats Ltd who built it in fibreglass. Known as the Newbridge [...] "Corribee 21" [...] in the brochure, she was sold as [...] "a fin keel version of the original centreboard clinker boat". The Mk1 was also built as a twin keel boat which has a shallower draft than the fin keel version and {{has the advantage of}} staying upright if run aground or kept on a drying [...] Compared to the later Mk 2 and Mk 3 Corribees, the Mk 1 has a few distinguishing features. The Mk 1 has a circular cover on the lazarette, the <b>coachroof</b> is wider than on later models and consequently has narrower side decks and more room below.|$|E
5000|$|The most {{striking}} {{feature of the}} exterior is the spacious feel of the decks (side, aft and flybridge).The side decks are wide enough to allow two people to pass and {{there is plenty of}} room to sit on the lower deck above the aft cabin as well as the flybridge and on the forward <b>coachroof</b> above the forward cabin, around the fore-deck. A few wide steps lead from the aft deck to the flybridge, providing very easy and quick access. On the lower deck and flybridge, comfortable social seating is typically available for up to 11 as shown in the photograph of a 2008 Corvette 320 with fixed seating. Earlier Corvettes had different seating arrangements, for example, fixed individual bucket seats on the flybridge and/or no fixed seating at all on the lower deck, where owners could choose to use movable deck chairs for maximum flexibility. An added benefit of the later fixed seating was that this created significant outside storage volume.|$|E
50|$|The Baba 30 {{is made of}} a solid GRP (glass {{reinforced}} plastic) hull moulded with plank {{lines to}} give {{the effect of a}} timber hull. Alternating layers of 1.5oz Mat and 24 ounce woven roving were used in the hull's construction, six layers of this were used on most of the hull but 10 - 12 layers were used around the keel. It has a full keel with a cutaway forefoot. The keel contains encapsulated iron ballast. It also has a long rudder with a cutaway for the propeller. The boat has a canoe shaped sternThe deck is cored fibreglass and is usually covered in extensive teak. The <b>coachroof</b> is treated the same.The first Babas were supplied with wooden spars but many of the boats have since been upgraded to aluminium mast and boom. Early Babas had no lower shrouds, but these were soon added after a dismasting.The rig is a traditional cutter style and a characteristic feature of many of Robert Perry's boats from this stable is a 4 ft laminated teak bowsprit which supports the forestay/headsail. A large platform sits on the bowsprit supporting two anchor rollers, a set-up typical on many long distance cruisers where two anchors are desirable in many exposed anchorages.Most Babas are fitted with Edson or similar wheel steering systems, however a few tiller steered versions exist.|$|E
