25|$|In December 1958, the {{original}} <b>class</b> <b>leader</b> N 110 (later renumbered N 419) {{was the first}} N to be scrapped. While most of the class remained into the 1960s, wholesale withdrawals during 1965 and 1966 wiped out their numbers. The end for the N class came on 8 October 1966, when N 468 and N 475 hauled an Australian Railway Historical Society special passenger train, the final run of the class.|$|E
25|$|Construction {{of three}} H class {{locomotives}} at Newport Workshops commenced in 1939 and {{three sets of}} frames were manufactured. However work was halted due to the outbreak of World War II. Due to a shortage of motive power caused by increased wartime traffic, completion of <b>class</b> <b>leader</b> H220 was authorised and the locomotive entered service on 7 February 1941. Streamlining similar to the S class was originally planned, but wartime economies saw this abandoned.|$|E
25|$|Designed by Chief Mechanical Engineer W. M.

When <b>class</b> <b>leader</b> C1 was introduced in 1918, it was the heaviest and most powerful steam locomotive in Australia. It had been necessary for Victorian Railways to strengthen bridges at Dudley Street, North Melbourne and along the lines to Woodend and Seymour on which the new locomotive was expected to run.|$|E

From October 1978 the remaining Mark IVs were disposed of, with the final 12 in the Board's possession last being listed in the fleet register on 31 March 1981.

25|$|In 1927, <b>class</b> <b>leader</b> N 110 was {{equipped}} with a two-cylinder Franklin booster engine which drove the trailing truck axle. Based {{on the success of}} this device, VR built all but two of the much larger X class 2-8-2s with booster engines. VR also modified the design of the Delta trailing truck on the second (1930-31 built) batch of N class locomotives to enable easy retrofitting of booster engines. Despite this, no further boosters were ever fitted, and in 1945, N 110's booster was removed and fitted to one of the two non-booster equipped X class locomotives.|$|E

2500|$|In 1936, <b>class</b> <b>leader</b> N 110 {{was again}} {{selected}} to test new features, {{this time a}} series of design changes for improved drafting and reduced cylinder back pressure referred to as 'Modified Front End' which had already been successfully applied to the C class locomotive. N 110's performance was dramatically improved, and all the original thirty N class locomotives were similarly equipped. The most visible change resulting from these enhancements was that their original cast iron funnels were replaced by a less ornate [...] "flowerpot" [...] funnel. They also saw other improvements during this period, such as the fitting of cross-compound air compressors and smoke deflectors.|$|E

[...] Madden notably owned <b>Class</b> <b>Leader,</b> who set a track record at the Cleveland Grand Circuit Race in 1887, Robert McGregor and Siliko.

2500|$|The Sclass was {{the first}} {{casualty}} of the Victorian Railways dieselisation program, which began in earnest with the delivery of B class mainline diesel electric locomotives in 1952. With their very limited route availability due to their high axle load, and the maintenance costs associated with their age and relatively high mileage, the decision {{was taken by the}} Victorian Railways Commissioners to withdraw from service and scrap the Sclass locomotives as mechanical condition dictated. First to go was S301 in September 1953 with worn cylinders, being recorded as scrapped on the 16 October 1953. Usable parts were stored for use in maintaining the three remaining Sclass locomotives while they remained in service, however the end was drawing near. Following successful trials, Bclass locomotives replaced the Sclass locomotives on the Spirit of Progress from April 1954 onwards. The superseded locomotives were rapidly withdrawn and scrapped, with S302 being recorded as scrapped on 2 July 1954 and S303 being recorded as scrapped on 28 May 1954. In June 1954 the last remaining example, <b>class</b> <b>leader</b> S300 was withdrawn, being recorded as scrapped three months later on 17 [...] September 1954.|$|E
2500|$|The Bloody Sunday {{massacre}} was {{a result}} of the public ignorance of the Tsar's place of residence. It occurred on [...] during a demonstration march by workers toward the Winter Palace. [...] The closest shootings of demonstrators occurred near St. Isaac's Cathedral {{at the entrance to the}} Aleksandr Gardens leading to the Palace Square in front of the Winter Palace. The massacre was sparked when a Russian Orthodox priest and popular working <b>class</b> <b>leader,</b> Father Gapon, announced his intention to lead a peaceful protest of 100,000 unarmed striking workers to present a petition to the Tsar, to call for fundamental reforms and the founding of a constituent parliament. The protesters were unaware that the palace was little more than an uninhabited icon of Imperial power, and that the Tsar no longer resided there. The Tsar was not informed of the planned protest until the evening before, while no suggestion was made that the Tsar should meet a deputation or send representative to accept the petition. Instead, the Minister for the Interior drafted additional troops. As the strikers neared the palace bearing religious icons and singing the Imperial anthem, the Tsar's troops opened fire. While the number of casualties is disputed, moderate estimates average around 1,000 men, women and children killed or injured. The massacre, which came to be known as Bloody Sunday, was a serious blunder on the part of the Okhrana and was to have grave consequences for the Tsarist regime. It was also to be the catalyst for the 1905 Revolution.|$|E
