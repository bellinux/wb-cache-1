40|$|Ouraim was to {{determine}} whether the characteristics of an olfactorycue influenced the experience-dependent approach behavior observed in domestic chicks and to look at the effects of these odors on behavior in the home-cage. <b>Chicks</b> were <b>reared</b> individually with tubes containing an odor suspended in the home-cage. At day 4 post-hatching they were tested in a runway with visually identical test stimuli suspended at either end; one of these contained the familiar odor and the other was unscented. <b>Chicks</b> <b>reared</b> with the odor of nesting-litter approached the familiar stimulus in preference to the unscented stimulus. <b>Chicks</b> <b>reared</b> with a garlic odor did not demonstrate a preference for either stimulus. A specific preference for the odor f nesting-litter was demonstrated by altering the visual, but not olfactory, cues of the stimuli. Thus, exposure to nesting-litter establishes a preference for this odor, but exposure to garlic odor has no such effect. The same chicks were given a  choice test between nesting-litter and garlic on day 9 post-hatching. Only those <b>chicks</b> <b>reared</b> with garlic-scented stimuli demonstrated a preference; they approached the nesting-litter-scented stimulus. The response of chicks to the presentation of olfactory stimuli within the familiar rearing environment was also assessed. When odors were presented, <b>chicks</b> <b>reared</b> with an unscented stimulus demonstrated a decrease in pecking frequency and increased attention to the testing stimulus, indicated by pecks directed at the testing stimulus and circling activity. Thus, young chicks can detect odors (nesting-litter and garlic odor) and form an association with certain odors (nesting-litter and not garlic odor). The odor of nesting-litter may serve to keep the chick in the proximity of the nest during early post-hatching life. ...|$|R
40|$|WOS: 000258325900001 International audienceBehavioural {{development}} is a complex phenomenon involving interactions between genetic constraints and environmental influences. One of the most potent environmental influences during the ontogeny of the behavioural characteristics of young is played by mothers. In particular, mammalian mothers modulate the social competences of their young, influencing all their future social life. Here, we investigated {{the influence of the}} social characteristics of adoptive mother birds (Coturnix coturnix japonica) on the social motivation (origin of every social relationship) of the young they reared. We characterized the social behaviour of standard stock <b>chicks</b> <b>reared</b> by female quail, genetically selected either for low (LSR) or high (HSR) levels of social reinstatement (index of treadmill behaviour which combined the tendency to run towards conspecifics with the tendency to move away from them), to investigate epigenetic transmission of social motivation.

40|$|Variation in rearing conditions, due {{either to}} parental or to {{environmental}} quality, {{can result in}} offspring of different quality (e. g. body condition, immune function). However, evidence is accumulating that egg size and composition can also affect offspring quality. In Oystercatchers Haematopus ostralegus, high-quality rearing conditions result in a higher quantity as well as quality of offspring. This {{is thought to be}} caused by increased parental food provisioning to the chicks in high-quality environments. However, variation in egg quality between rearing conditions could also affect {{the quantity and quality of}} offspring. Determining the mechanism and ontogeny of quality differences is important in unravelling the causes of variation in reproductive success. To disentangle the effects of egg quality, and quality of the rearing conditions, on the future survival of offspring, we cross-fostered complete clutches between nests. When reared under conditions of similar environmental quality, chicks originating from eggs laid in low-quality environments survived as well as chicks originating from eggs laid in a high-quality environment. However, <b>chicks</b> <b>reared</b> in high-quality environments survived twice as long as <b>chicks</b> <b>reared</b> in low-quality environments, independent of the environmental quality in which the eggs were laid.

40|$|AbstractAn earlier report {{describing}} {{a lack of}} compensation to imposed myopic and hyperopic defocus in <b>chicks</b> <b>reared</b> in UV lighting {{has led to the}} belief that the spatial resolving power of the UV cone photoreceptor network in chicks is not capable of decoding optical defocus. However this study used dim light rearing conditions, of less than 10 lx. The purpose of the current study was to determine if emmetropization is possible in young <b>chicks</b> <b>reared</b> under higher luminance, UV lighting conditions. Young, 4 day-old <b>chicks</b> were <b>reared</b> under diurnal near UV (390 nm) illumination set to either 20 or 200 lx while wearing a monocular defocusing lens (+ 20, + 10, − 10 or − 20 D), for 7 days. Similarly treated control groups were reared under diurnal white lighting (WL) of matching illuminance. The WL and UV LED sources were set to equivalent illuminances, measured in “chick lux”, calculated from radiometer readings taken through appropriate narrow band interference filters, and a mathematical model of the spectral sensitivity of the chick visual system. High resolution A-scan ultrasonography was undertaken on days 0 (before lenses were fitted), 2, 4, and 7 to track ocular dimensions and refractive errors were measured by retinoscopy on days 0 and 7. Compensation to negative lenses was unaffected by UV illuminance levels, with near full compensation being achieved under both conditions, as well as under both WL conditions. In contrast, compensation to the positive lenses was markedly impaired in 20 lx UV lighting, with increased instead of decreased axial elongation along with a myopic refractive shift being recorded with the + 10 D lens. Compensation under both WL conditions was again near normal for the + 10 D lens. However, with the + 20 D lens, myopic shifts in refractive error were observed under both dim UV and WL conditions. The spatial resolving power of the UV cone photoreceptor network in the chick is sufficient to detect optical defocus and guide the emmetropization response, provided illumination is sufficiently high. However, compensation to imposed myopic defocus may be compromised, when either the amount of defocus is very high or illumination low, especially when the wavelength is restricted to the UV range...|$|R

Here we report that newly hatched <b>chicks,</b> <b>reared</b> and hatched in darkness, at their first exposure to point-light animation sequences, exhibit a spontaneous preference to approach biological motion patterns. Intriguingly, this predisposition is not specific for the motion of a hen, but extends to the pattern of motion of other vertebrates, even to that of a potential predator such as a cat. The predisposition seems to reflect the existence of a mechanism in the brain aimed at orienting the young animal towards objects that move semirigidly (as vertebrate animals do), thus facilitating learning, i. e., through imprinting, about their more specific features of motion...|$|R
50|$|Little {{penguins}} can breed as isolated pairs, in colonies, or semi-colonially.

50|$|Little {{penguins}} are diurnal {{and like}} many penguin species, spend the largest part of their day swimming and foraging at sea. During the breeding and <b>chick</b> <b>rearing</b> seasons, little penguins will leave their nest at sunrise, forage for food throughout the day and return to their nests just after dusk. Thus, sunlight, moonlight and artificial lights can affect the behaviour of attendance to the colony. Also, increased wind speeds negatively affect the little penguins' efficiency in foraging for chicks, but for reasons not yet understood. Little penguins preen their feathers to keep them waterproof. They do this by rubbing a tiny drop of oil onto every feather from a special gland above the tail.|$|E
50|$|The {{foraging}} {{patterns of}} breeding Snares penguins are well defined.
