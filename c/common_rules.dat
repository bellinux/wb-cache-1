40|$|The <b>Common</b> <b>Rule</b> {{is a set}} {{of ethical}} {{principles}} that provide guidance on the management of human subjects taking part in biomedical and behavioral research in the United States. The elements of the <b>Common</b> <b>Rule</b> were initially developed in 1981 following a revision of the Declaration of Helsinki in 1975. Most academic facilities follow the <b>Common</b> <b>Rule</b> in the regulation of clinical trials research. Recently, the government has suggested a revision of the <b>Common</b> <b>Rule</b> to include more contemporary and streamlined oversight of clinical research. In this commentary, the leadership of the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) provides their opinion on this plan. While the Society recognizes the considerable contribution of clinical research in supporting progress in tumor immunotherapy and supports the need for revisions to the <b>Common</b> <b>Rule,</b> there is also some concern over certain elements which may restrict access to biospecimens and clinical data at a time when high throughput technologies, computational biology and assay standardization is allowing major advances in understanding cancer biology and providing potential predictive biomarkers of immunotherapy response. The Society values its professional commitment to patients for improving clinical outcomes with tumor immunotherapy and supports continued discussion with all stakeholders before implementing changes to the <b>Common</b> <b>Rule</b> in order to ensure maximal patient protections while promoting continued clinical research at this historic time in cancer research...|$|R

25|$|Griffith CJ {{expressed}} stronger {{views in}} relation to the constitutionality of the <b>common</b> <b>rule</b> provisions, stating that the function of an arbitrator was a judicial function that could only be exercised between parties to the dispute and after hearing them.

The State of Victoria had intervened in the case to protect the public of that State from the operation of what it said was an invalid federal law.

2500|$|The {{connection}} to the brazilwood harvest {{is also found in}} the demonym for the country. In the Portuguese language, an inhabitant of Brazil is referred to as a Brasileiro. But the <b>common</b> <b>rules</b> of the language reserves the suffix -eiro to denote occupations, rather than inhabitants (which are usually given the suffix -ano). The English equivalent is the suffix -er for occupations (e.g. baker, shoemaker) and the suffix -an for demonyms (e.g. Indian, American). If this rule was followed, an inhabitant of Brazil should have been known (in Portuguese) as a Brasiliano. But uniquely among Portuguese demonyms, they are instead referred to as a Brasileiro, an occupation. That too stemmed from Loronha's time, when a brasileiro was a reference to a [...] "brazilwood cutter", a job invariably undertaken by the Tupí Indians on the coast. The name of the occupation was simply extended to refer to all the inhabitants of the country.|$|E
