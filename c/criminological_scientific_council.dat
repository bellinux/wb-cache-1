This workshop gathered together some 30 scientists and managers from all Alpine countries and different types of protected areas (PA) and allowed discussing the goals, composition, organization and management of <b>scientific</b> <b>councils.</b> While based on experiences in Alpine countries, these recommendations {{can be applied to}} managed PAs in general. They are addressed to PA managers and scientists involved or interested in participating in <b>scientific</b> <b>councils,</b> {{as well as to the}} PA executive boards and administrations in charge of PA management and policy. They intend to help decide if and when to establish a <b>scientific</b> <b>council</b> and how to compose, organize and manage it if such a decision has been made, is planned or envisaged. Given the diversity of national regulations and practices, they remain rather general: the aim is to identify the questions to bear in mind when establishing or renewing a <b>scientific</b> <b>council</b> rather than to give predefined or definitive answers...|$|R
