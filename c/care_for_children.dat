25|$|Although {{many aspects}} of the {{internment}} camps caused negative changes within the Japanese-Canadian community, some of these changes had limited positive impacts. For example, many women faced lesser domestic responsibilities within the internment camps. Living spaces were small and crowded so cleaning was shared among multiple woman and took less time than at home. Childcare was also less taxing on women because the cramped quarters allowed for multiple women to <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>children</b> at once. In addition, new-found free time allowed younger women to get education and older women to participate in wage-earning jobs, such as workers on beet farms.|$|E
25|$|Structural {{walls were}} lowered {{dramatically}} during the war, especially informal policies against hiring women, minorities, and workers over 45 or under 18.

Tens {{of thousands of}} new factories and shipyards were built, with new bus services and nursery <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>children</b> making them more accessible. Wages soared for workers, making it quite expensive to sit at home. Employers retooled so that unskilled new workers could handle jobs that previously required skills that were now in short supply. The combination of all these factors drove unemployment below 2% in 1943.|$|E

Initially, the majority of the women insurgents were in the less-organized local militias, but later decided to join the actual EZLN. The women who joined as insurgents had to renounce having a family of their own, because it was too difficult to <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>children</b> in the conditions they lived in. There was family planning for women insurgents, but for those who did get pregnant, they either went home or left the child with their parents.

40|$|Children {{between the}} ages of 6 - 17 years {{suffering}} from childhood attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) need constant attention as {{they are more likely to}} be accident proned, hospitalized, disruptive, and educationally challenged. The constant attention required <b>for</b> <b>children</b> with ADHD may impose stress on mothers and primary caregivers, yet this stress has not been sufficiently studied. The objective of this study was to fill a gap in literature by studying the stress experienced by African immigrant mothers living in the United States who are living with and <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> a <b>child</b> with ADHD, and then comparing the level of stress reported by African immigrant mothers and African American mothers <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> <b>children</b> with and without ADHD. The study had a quantitative, case-control design, and used the parental stress index-short form (PSI-SF) and a 9 -item demographic questionnaire as the survey instruments. One hundred twenty-five African immigrant and African American mothers participated in the study. Data collected from the mothers were analyzed for descriptive. ANOVA and Regression analysis were performed using SPSS version 21. The results showed that African immigrant mothers <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> a <b>child</b> with ADHD had significantly higher stress levels than those not <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> a <b>child</b> with ADHD. African American mothers also <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> a <b>child</b> with ADHD had significantly higher stress than African American mothers not <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> a <b>child</b> with ADHD. African immigrant mothers <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> a <b>child</b> with ADHD had significantly lower stress than African American mothers <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> a <b>child</b> with ADHD. These findings may initiate interventions that would help mothers provide quality <b>care</b> of life <b>for</b> themselves and <b>for</b> their <b>children</b> suffering form ADHD...|$|R
