40|$|Abstract Background Platelet-mediated <b>clumping</b> of Plasmodium falciparum -infected {{erythrocytes}} (IE) is {{a parasite}} adhesion phenotype {{that has been}} associated with severe malaria in some, but not all, field isolate studies. A variety of experimental conditions have been used to study <b>clumping</b> in vitro, with substantial differences in parasitaemia (Pt), haematocrit (Ht), and time of reaction between studies. It is unknown whether these experimental variables affect the outcome of parasite <b>clumping</b> assays. Methods The effects of Pt (1, 4 and 12 %), Ht (2, 5 and 10 %) and time (15 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h) on the <b>clumping</b> of P. falciparum clone HB 3 were examined. The effects of platelet freshness and parasite maturity were also studied. Results At low Ht (2 %), the Pt of the culture has a large effect on <b>clumping,</b> with significantly higher <b>clumping</b> occurring at 12 % Pt (mean 47 % of IE in <b>clumps)</b> compared to 4 % Pt (mean 26 % IE in <b>clumps)</b> or 1 % Pt (mean 7 % IE in <b>clumps)</b> (ANOVA, p = 0. 0004). Similarly, at low Pt (1 %), the Ht of the culture has a large effect on <b>clumping,</b> with significantly higher <b>clumping</b> occurring at 10 % Ht (mean 62 % IE in <b>clumps)</b> compared to 5 % Ht (mean 25 % IE in <b>clumps)</b> or 2 % Ht (mean 10 % IE in <b>clumps)</b> (ANOVA, p = 0. 0004). Combinations of high Ht and high Pt were impractical because of the difficulty assessing <b>clumping</b> in densely packed IE and the rapid formation of enormous <b>clumps</b> that could not be counted accurately. There {{was no significant difference in}} <b>clumping</b> when fresh platelets were used compared to platelets stored at 4 °C for 10 days. <b>Clumping</b> was a property of mature pigmented-trophozoites and schizonts but not ring stage parasites. Conclusion The Pt and Ht at which in vitro <b>clumping</b> assays are set up have a profound effect on the outcome. All previous field isolate studies on <b>clumping</b> and malaria severity suffer from potential problems in experimental design and methodology. Future studies of <b>clumping</b> should use standardized conditions and control for Pt, and should take into account the limitations and variability inherent in the assay. </p...|$|R

40|$|Platelet-mediated <b>clumping</b> of Plasmodium falciparum -infected {{erythrocytes}} (IEs) is {{a common}} property of field isolates associated with severe disease (Pain, Ferguson et al. 2001). Platelet receptors CD 36 (Pain, Ferguson et al. 2001), P-Selectin (Wassmer, Taylor et al. 2008) and gC 1 qR (Biswas, Hafiz et al. 2007) mediate <b>clumping.</b> To characterize the molecular specificities of the <b>clumping</b> phenotype, I cloned <b>clumping</b> parasite line IT/C 10 by limiting dilution. I characterized var gene expression in the IT/C 10 clones using generic primers for the DBL tag region (Bull, Berriman et al. 2005). <b>Clumping</b> assays were conducted {{in the presence of}} specific reagents to delineate host factors hypothesized to contribute to development of the <b>clumping</b> phenotype. Finally, I conducted a clinical study with isolates from children with malaria in Kilifi, Kenya. This study shows that in parasite line IT/C 10, platelet-mediated <b>clumping</b> is associated with Itvar 30 suggesting a prominent role for the PfEMP- 1 encoded by this var gene in development of platelet-mediated <b>clumping.</b> For IT/C 10 parasites, platelet activation appears to be involved in platelet-mediated <b>clumping.</b> Platelet P-Selectin appears to mediate <b>clumping</b> using lectin-dependent interactions. To further elucidate the mechanisms that mediate <b>clumping</b> by host platelets, I have used a panel of platelet antagonists to delineate specific platelet activation pathways. Our results show that platelet activation {{plays an important role in}} platelet-mediated <b>clumping.</b> Finally, in this study, platelet-mediated <b>clumping</b> was associated with parasitaemia, but not with disease severity.

40|$|Platelet-mediated <b>clumping</b> of Plasmodium falciparum {{infected}} erythrocytes (IEs) is a frequently observed parasite adhesion phenotype. The {{importance of}} <b>clumping</b> in severe malaria and the molecular mechanisms behind this phenomenon are incompletely understood. Three platelet surface molecules have previously {{been identified as}} <b>clumping</b> receptors: CD 36, globular C 1 q receptor (gC 1 qR/HABP 1 /p 32), and P-selectin (CD 62 P), but the parasite ligands mediating this phenotype are unknown. The aim of this work {{was to develop a}} selection method to facilitate investigations of the molecular mechanisms of <b>clumping</b> in selected P. falciparum lines. Magnetic beads coated with anti-platelet antibodies were used to positively and negatively select <b>clumping</b> IEs from P. falciparum strains IT, HB 3, 3 D 7 and Dd 2. <b>Clumping</b> in all four positively selected parasite lines was abolished by antibodies to CD 36, but was not affected by antibodies to gC 1 qR or P-selectin. <b>Clumping</b> positive lines showed significantly higher binding to CD 36 than <b>clumping</b> negative lines in flow adhesion assays (strains IT, HB 3 and 3 D 7, p, 0. 05 for all strains, paired t test) and static assays (strain Dd 2, p, 0. 0001 paired t test). However, <b>clumping</b> negative lines IT, HB 3 and 3 D 7 did show some binding to CD 36 under flow conditions, indicating that CD 36 -binding is not sufficient for <b>clumping.</b> These data show that CD 36 -dependent <b>clumping</b> positive and negative lines can easily be selected from P. falciparum laboratory strains.

5|$|After the red-giant branch the Sun has {{approximately}} 120 {{million years}} of active life left, but much happens. First, the core, full of degenerate helium ignites violently in the helium flash, {{where it is}} estimated that 6% of the core, itself 40% of the Sun's mass, will be converted into carbon within a matter of minutes through the triple-alpha process. The Sun then shrinks to around 10 times its current size and 50 times the luminosity, with a temperature a little lower than today. It will then have reached the red <b>clump</b> or horizontal branch, but a star of the Sun's mass does not evolve blueward along the horizontal branch.

5|$|As the {{hydrogen}} shell burning produces more helium, the core increases in mass and temperature.

For more massive stars, helium core fusion starts before the core becomes degenerate, and the star spends some time in the red <b>clump,</b> slowly burning helium, before the outer convective envelope collapses and the star then moves to the horizontal branch.|$|E
