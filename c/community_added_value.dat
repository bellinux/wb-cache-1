40|$|Research {{results in}} {{environmental}} and socioeconomic sciences are often under-used by stakeholders {{involved in the}} management of natural resources. To minimise this gap, the FP 6 EU interdisciplinary project AquaTerra (AT) developed an end-users' integration methodology {{in order to ensure that}} the data, knowledge and tools related to the soil-water-sediment system that were generated by the project were delivered in a meaningful way for end-users, thus improving their uptake. The methodology and examples of its application are presented in this paper. From the 408 project deliverables, 96 key findings were identified, 53 related to data and knowledge, and 43 describing advanced tools. River Basin Management (RBM) stakeholders workshops identified 8 main RBM issues and 25 specific stakeholders' questions related to RBM which were classified into seven groups of cross-cutting issues, namely scale, climate change, non-climatic change, the need for systemic approaches, communication and participation, international and inter-basin coordination and collaboration, and the implementation of the Water Framework Directive. The integration methodology enabled an assessment of how AT key findings meet stakeholders' demands, and for each main RBM issue and for each specific question, described the added-value of the AT project in terms of knowledge and tools generated, key parameters to consider, and recommendations that can be made to stakeholders and the wider scientific <b>community.</b> <b>Added</b> <b>value</b> and limitations of the integration methodology and its outcomes are discussed and recommendations are provided to further improve integration methodology and bridge the gaps between scientific research data and their potential uptake by end-users...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Community</b> <b>added</b> <b>value</b> of Centres of Expertise (CoE) and European Reference Networks (ERN) is {{particularly}} high for rare diseases (RD) {{due to the}} rarity of these conditions, which implies both {{a small number of}} patients and scarcity of expertise within a single country. Gathering expertise at the European level is therefore, paramount in order to ensure equal access to accurate information, appropriate and timely diagnosis and high quality clinical care and follow up for patients with rare diseases. This applies particularly to rare anaemias due to the high number of different rare diseases that constitute this group. In this context, the European Network for Rare and Congenital Anaemias (ENERCA), co-financed by the European Commission, was created in 2002 with the aim of prevention and management of rare anaemias (RA) and the development and promotion of policies to improve the well-being of European Union citizens. The ENERCA White Book is a position paper, developed as a deliverable of the ENERCA (phase 3) project that intends to contribute {{to the creation of a}} ERN in RA (ERN-RA) by preparation of the recommendations and, in particular, the definition of the criteria that CoE, local centres (LC) and their interrelations have to fulfil as healthcare providers. It has been nourished by all the activities that have been performed over the past ten years within the ENERCA framework. The White Book is addressed to authorities in charge of the identifying CoE, as an essential requirement for the official recognition of the ERN, to European and national health authorities, Healthcare centres and health professionals, as well as to all other stakeholders interested in RA. It is also addressed to the patients, as a way to empower their community in this process. One particular characteristic of the White Book is the integration of the three main aspects of a CoE: a) ethical and legal frameworks to ensure the non-discrimination and non-stigmatisation of rare disease patients across Europe, within their sphere of competencies; b) clinical and laboratory frameworks for defining technical and quality criteria including scope, general and disease specific elements currently defined as technical and professional standards for the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of patients with RA; and c) the expectations patients have of CoE. Conceived as a working tool directed to a broad range of stakeholders, the White book has been designed and structured to be comprehensible even to non-technical and /or non-professional audiences. The reader will find an up-to-date description and epidemiological information on RA as well as the European Union background policies for defining CoE and ERN-RA. A working group was created with experts of different profiles, known as the European Working Group on Rare Anaemias (EGRA). In order to achieve its objectives, the methodology used by EGRA, was characterised by three main principles: Interdisciplinary, European coverage, and evidence-based principles. Work has been developed into four sequential steps: 1. Analysis of the current situation of RA in Europe by healthcare professionals in order to identify the most relevant issues that have to be addressed by a centre in order for it to be recommended as CoE. 2. Preparation of questionnaires to perform surveys on how the relevant issues identified in step 1 can be translated into practical recommendations. 3. Analysis of the questionnaire results by face to face meetings, feedback and consensus evaluation, and 4. Preparation of a report on ENERCA policy recommendations for CoE. This report is presented in a user-friendly format, easy to understand and available through the ENERCA website (www. enerca. org). Several important conclusions can be drawn from the ENERCA White Book, including the importance of laboratories involved in the diagnosis of RA, patient oriented and multidisciplinary care at the CoE, the need for coordination and cooperation within and outside the centre, the provision of information to patients and health professionals and the involvement of public authorities at the national and European levels. Official recognition of this structure and assurance of its long term sustainability will only be achieved if public authorities work hand by hand with both professionals experts in different disciplines and patients. Finally, the ENERCA White book aims to be a practical tool for health authorities of Member States (MS) that are preparing their national directory of formally designated CoE. For this, it is important that MS authorities recognise RA as an important health component to be included within the National Plans or Actions for Rare Diseases...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} if localised programmes that {{are successful in}} engaging the <b>community</b> can <b>add</b> <b>value</b> to larger fruit and vegetable mass-media campaigns by evaluating {{the results of the}} Eat It To Beat It programme. Design: The Eat It To Beat It programme is a multi-strategy intervention that uses community-based education and ‘below the line’ social marketing to increase fruit and vegetable consumption in parents. This programme was evaluated by a controlled before-and-after study with repeat cross-sectional data collected via computer-assisted telephone interviews with 1403 parents before the intervention (2008) and 1401 following intervention delivery (2011). Setting: The intervention area was the Hunter region and the control area was the New England region of New South Wales, Australia. Subjects: Parents of primary school-aged children (Kindergarten to Year 6). Results: The programme achieved improvements in knowledge of recommended intakes for fruit and vegetables and some positive changes in knowledge of serving size for vegetables. Exposure to the programme resulted in a net increase of 0 · 5 servings of fruit and vegetables daily for those who recalled the programme compared with those who did not (P = 0 · 004). Increased intake of fruit and vegetables was significantly associated with increasing exposure to programme strategies. Conclusions: The Eat It To Beat It programme demonstrates that an increase in consumption of fruit and vegetables can be achieved by programmes that build on the successes of larger mass-media and social-marketing campaigns. This suggests that funding for localised, community-based programmes should be increased...|$|R

The quantitative methodology consisted in surveying to the residents, the leaders of the six communities and the heads of 64 households scattered around five rural parishes. The main results are collected in a strategic agenda that would boost the ecological sustainability. The communities employ a high number of species directly as food, and a fewer for medical, flavoring and cosmetic use. However, a single use of resources as raw materials is observed.

Added value is defined here as the difference in economic value between the physical inputs and outputs of a production process, and is generally analysed at the firm or national economy level. In this study we identify and discuss issues involved in quantifying <b>added</b> <b>value</b> at the industrial process level, and develop a bottom-up method to estimate the <b>value</b> <b>added</b> by forest industry processes. We calculate the <b>value</b> <b>added</b> by 14 traditional and emerging processes within the Swedish forest products industries, and express the results using various indices. We find {{that the type of}} biomass input strongly influences the potential for <b>adding</b> <b>value,</b> with sawlogs allowing more <b>added</b> <b>value</b> and being less sensitive to input price fluctuations than pulpwood and forest residues. Structural wood products such as lumber and glue-laminated beams are found to give the greatest <b>value</b> <b>added.</b> Co-production of multiple products from a single raw material increases total <b>value</b> <b>added.</b> Integrating the <b>value</b> chain of pulp and paper production significantly increases the <b>value</b> <b>added</b> to pulpwood. Multiple conversion processes exist for using forest residues as fuel, with a range of potential <b>added</b> <b>value.</b> Consideration of the climate benefits of forest product use, through the application of a carbon tax, significantly increases the <b>added</b> <b>value.</b> <b>Value</b> <b>added</b> Forest products Bottom-up analysis...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to analyze the <b>added</b> <b>value</b> of the anchovy processing industry. This research was conducted by cencus method in Pasaran Island, District of Teluk Betung Barat of Bandar Lampung City. This location was selected purposively for it is the center of salted anchovy fish producers in Bandar Lampung. All of the 38 active salted fish producers were recruieted as respondents. The data were analyzed qualitatively and by Hayami method. The results showed that the average value obtained from the processing of a kilogram of wet fish being processed to be dried anchovies was the highest in the west wind season that was Rp 7, 253. 02 with the ratio of <b>added</b> <b>value</b> to the value of the product was 29. 73 percent. It meant that of every Rp 100. 00 of the product would be obtained <b>added</b> <b>value</b> of Rp 29. 73. The average of <b>added</b> <b>value</b> in the normal monsoon was Rp 4, 808. 72 with the ratio of <b>added</b> <b>value</b> to the product was 25. 20 percent. In the eastern monsoon, the average <b>added</b> <b>value</b> was Rp 4, 801. 30 with the ratio of the <b>added</b> <b>value</b> to the product was 27. 11 percent. Thus, this dried anchovy processing industry cluster gave <b>added</b> <b>value...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} concept of <b>adding</b> <b>value</b> to {{corporate}} performance by real estate, and how this concept could be applied in decision-making processes for new hospital infrastructure. A literature review forms {{the starting point for}} interviews carried out with hospitals‘ CEOs on how real estate <b>added</b> <b>value</b> is perceived and used in design-related decision-making processes. A ranking of real estate <b>added</b> <b>value</b> as perceived by hospital decision makers is then made. While flexibility is often mentioned as an important <b>added</b> <b>value,</b> it is never given top priority. Confronted with <b>added</b> <b>values</b> from literature, the main objective seems to shift to organizational strategic objectives e. g. stimulating innovation, improving culture and increasing user satisfaction. The architectural designs of a number of hospitals are analyzed in order to investigate tools for assessing organizational objectives by using {{the concept of}} real estate <b>added</b> <b>value.</b> Real Estate and HousingArchitectur...|$|R
40|$|Much {{has been}} written about the {{strategic}} importance of <b>added</b> <b>value</b> as a means for achieving competitive advantage, but little attention has been paid to the meaning of the term “added value”. Numerous messages about <b>added</b> <b>values</b> of food products are communicated by and to different actors, values such as convenience regarding fast-food, luxury regarding meals, products without chemical additives, health, quality, taste, what the package looks like, exclusiveness, tradition/story-telling/, and many others. Food producers, wholesalers, retailers, and end-consumers constitute some of these actors. However, the concept of <b>added</b> <b>value</b> and the relationships between the different aspects are unclear and illusive. There is a need to explore as well as clarify definitions and dimensions. Therefore, the aim of this article is to develop a conceptual framework which explores definitions and discussions associated with <b>added</b> <b>values</b> of food products. Traditionally, the literature has made strict and categorical distinctions between core <b>values</b> and <b>added</b> <b>values.</b> However, we stress that this traditional view needs to be challenged. For food products we argue that core values cannot be clearly distinguished from <b>added</b> <b>values.</b> We argue that not only the end consumer but all actors involved in the supply chain contribute to the overall realization of the <b>added</b> <b>value,</b> i. e. all actors must perceive, appreciate, value and realize the <b>added</b> <b>value.</b> Only then may the <b>added</b> <b>value</b> result in willingness to purchase the products, increased market share or strengthened position at different markets...|$|R
