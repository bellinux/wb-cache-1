5000|$|The cutters {{most often}} used to cut spotfaces are <b>counterbore</b> <b>cutters</b> and endmills. In manual {{machining}} especially, the former is useful because its pilot guides the cutter into the correct location (established by the bolt hole), and its cutting lips are perpendicular to the hole axis with no relief angle, meaning that a plunging cut, moving in only the Z-axis, will leave a flat surface. In contrast, most general-purpose endmills have a relief angle such that a plunging cut (Z-axis-only toolpath) will leave a very slightly convex surface. But in CNC machining this is irrelevant, because the flat spotface is left by circular interpolation of the endmill as it traces a circular toolpath in the XY plane. Zero-angle cutters obviate this, functioning similarly to the traditional <b>counterbore</b> <b>cutters</b> of manual machining but needing no pilot. Spot facing of larger planar surfaces sometimes employs face mills.|$|R
