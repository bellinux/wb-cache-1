For which T and M does the <b>configuration</b> obtained at <b>level</b> n of T typically contain significant information on the root variable? This problem arose independently in biology, information theory and statistical physics. • For all b, we construct a channel for which the variable {{at the root of}} the b-ary tree is independent of the <b>configuration</b> at <b>level</b> 2 of that tree, yet for sufficiently large B> b, the mutual information between the <b>configuration</b> at <b>level</b> n of the B-ary tree and the root variable is bounded away from zero.

A CLT of Kesten and Stigum (1966) implies that if b|λ 2 (M) | 2 > 1, then the census of the variables at any level of the b-ary tree, contains significant information on the root variable. We establish a converse: if b|λ 2 (M) | 2 < 1, then the census of the variables at level n of the b-ary tree is asymptotically independent of the root variable. This contrasts with examples where b|λ 2 (M) | 2 < 1, yet the <b>configuration</b> at <b>level</b> n is not asymptotically independent of the root variable. ...|$|R
