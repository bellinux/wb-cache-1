5000|$|A 2013 {{review of}} deaths <b>in</b> <b>custody</b> by the Australian Institute of Criminology {{found that the}} number of Aboriginal deaths <b>in</b> <b>custody</b> had {{increased}} over the previous five years. The report found that most of the deaths were due to natural causes like cancer and heart conditions, replacing self-harm as the leading cause of deaths <b>in</b> <b>custody.</b> AIC director Dr. Adam Tomison also noted that [...] "especially for the last eight years, Indigenous people <b>in</b> <b>custody</b> have been less likely to die <b>in</b> <b>custody</b> than non-Indigenous people." ...|$|R
5|$|The {{privileges}} of the Hasekura family were abolished {{at this point}} by the Sendai fief, and their property and belongings seized. It is at this time, in 1640, that Hasekura's Christian artifacts were confiscated, and they were kept in <b>custody</b> <b>in</b> Sendai until they were rediscovered {{at the end of}} the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|Bird's nest custody is an {{uncommon}} {{form of joint}} <b>custody</b> <b>in</b> which, rather than having the children go from one parent's house to the other parent's house, the parents {{move in and out}} of the house in which the children constantly reside. The goal of this arrangement is to shift the burden of upheaval and moving between homes onto the parents rather than the children. However, due to the high cost of maintaining three households, one for each parent and one for the children, it's rarely a viable option in a custody case.|$|E
5|$|However, in November Justice Lloyd Hibbert sentenced them {{to life in}} prison, stipulating {{that they}} must serve a minimum of thirty years before {{becoming}} eligible for parole.

5|$|In his post-war memoirs, Kesselring {{claimed he}} envisioned making a {{start on the}} {{rehabilitation}} of Germany {{following the end of}} the war. Instead, he was arrested. On 15 May 1945, Kesselring was taken to Mondorf-les-Bains where his baton and decorations were taken from him and he was incarcerated. He was held in a number of American POW camps before being transferred to British <b>custody</b> <b>in</b> 1946. He testified at the Nuremberg trial of Hermann Göring, but his offers to testify against Soviet, American, and British commanders were declined.|$|E

5|$|Sultan Mehmed II died on 3 May 1481. A {{civil war}} ensued in the Ottoman Empire between his sons Bayezid II and Cem. Defeated, Cem fled to Rhodes, where the Knights Hospitaller {{kept him in}} custody. Matthias claimed Cem's <b>custody</b> <b>in</b> the hope of using him to gain {{concessions}} from Bayezid, but Venice and Pope Innocent VIII strongly opposed this plan. In late 1481, Hungarian auxiliary troops supported Matthias's father-in-law Ferdinand I of Naples to reoccupy Otranto, which had been lost to the Ottomans the year before.|$|E

5|$|We {{first learned}} about the facilitator/courier's nom de guerre from a detainee not in CIA <b>custody</b> <b>in</b> 2002. It is also {{important}} to note that some detainees who were subjected to enhanced interrogation techniques attempted to provide false or misleading information about the facilitator/courier. These attempts to falsify the facilitator/courier's role were alerting. In the end, no detainee in CIA custody revealed the facilitator/courier's full true name or specific whereabouts. This information was discovered through other intelligence means.|$|E
40|$|Deaths <b>in</b> <b>custody</b> warrant scrutiny, {{not only}} because they might be due to torture, abuse and {{inadequate}} medical care, but also because they pose challenges for detaining authorities. It is a widely overlooked problem that in many prisons deaths are frequent {{and most of them are}} considered ‘normal’ or ‘natural’ and not necessarily investigated while some of them were preventable. The lack of guidance to health care workers or international personnel in the field as to how to proceed in cases of deaths <b>in</b> <b>custody</b> is one of the reasons why investigations into deaths <b>in</b> <b>custody</b> are not conducted or are ineffective. In light of this real and persistent problem, a multidisciplinary research project on the legal, medical and forensic aspects of investigating deaths <b>in</b> <b>custody</b> has been carried out between 2008 and 2013 by the University Centre for Legal Medicine of Geneva and Lausanne, the Geneva Academy of International Humanitarian Law and Human Rights, the University of Bern, the International Centre for Prison Studies (King’s College London) and the ICRC. As a result of this collaborative effort, the Guidelines for investigating deaths <b>in</b> <b>custody</b> have been published by the ICRC in 2013. The latter Guidelines fill an important gap by offering practical guidance to detaining authorities, investigating authorities, humanitarian agencies and others on the standards and procedures to be followed when a death occurs <b>in</b> <b>custody.</b> This chapter presents the background, content and usefulness of the Guidelines after having discussed some of the key medical and legal issues related to death <b>in</b> <b>custody</b> such as: how to define deaths <b>in</b> <b>custody?</b> What are the most prevalent causes of deaths <b>in</b> <b>custody?</b> What is the legal framework pertaining to the prevention and investigation of deaths <b>in</b> <b>custody?</b> How to investigate and prevent deaths <b>in</b> <b>custody...</b>|$|R

During his {{interrogation}} he was severely beaten {{by some of the}} policemen questioning him. He suffered severe injuries, including his brain, and died soon after on 12 September 1977. News of his death spread quickly, and became a symbol of the abuses perpetrated under the apartheid government. Biko's position as an individual who had never been convicted of a crime led to the death being reported in the international press; he thus became one of first anti-apartheid activists widely known internationally.|$|E
5|$|Arafat {{was finally}} {{allowed to leave}} his {{compound}} on 2 May 2002 after intense negotiations led to a settlement: six PFLP militants, including the organization's secretary-general Ahmad Sa'adat, wanted by Israel, who had been holed up with Arafat in his compound, would be transferred to international <b>custody</b> <b>in</b> Jericho. After the wanted men were handed over the siege was lifted. With that, and a promise that he would issue {{a call to the}} Palestinians to halt attacks on Israelis, Arafat was released. He issued such a call on 8 May. On 19 September 2002, the IDF largely demolished the compound with armored bulldozers in order to isolate Arafat. In March 2003, Arafat ceded his post as Prime Minister to Mahmoud Abbas amid pressures by the US.|$|E

5|$|For many years, Germany {{simply had}} no battleships. The Armistice with Germany {{required}} {{that most of}} the High Seas Fleet be disarmed and interned in a neutral port; largely because no neutral port could be found, the ships remained in British <b>custody</b> <b>in</b> Scapa Flow, Scotland. The Treaty of Versailles specified that the ships should be handed over to the British. Instead, most of them were scuttled by their German crews on June 21, 1919 just before the signature of the peace treaty. The treaty also limited the German Navy, and prevented Germany from building or possessing any capital ships.|$|E
5|$|In 1999 Patel was reprimanded by the General Medical Council (GMC) {{for having}} {{released}} medical details about Roger Sylvester, {{a man who}} had died in police <b>custody.</b> <b>In</b> 2002 the police dropped a criminal inquiry because Patel said the victim, Sally White, had {{died of a heart attack}} with no signs of violence, although she was reportedly found naked with bruising to her body, an injury to her head and a bite mark on her thigh. Anthony Hardy, a mentally ill alcoholic who lived in the flat in which her body was found locked in a bedroom, later murdered two women and placed their body parts in bin bags. The police investigated Patel in relation to that autopsy, but the investigation was dropped.|$|E
5|$|The {{killings of}} the civilians taken from Hrvatska Dubica, Cerovljani and Baćin were {{included}} in the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) trial of Milan Martić, and the trial of Slobodan Milošević. Martić, who coordinated the combat activities of SAO Krajina forces and the JNA with Colonel Dušan Smiljanić, the security head of the JNA 10th (Zagreb) Corps in the area of Hrvatska Kostajnica, was convicted and sentenced to 35 years in prison for his role in an ethnic cleansing campaign against non-Serbs in Croatia. The judgment identified 83 civilians—the 43 taken from Hrvatska Dubica, 10 from Cerovljani and approximately 30 from Baćin who were killed at Krečani on or about 21 October 1991. Milošević died in <b>custody</b> <b>in</b> March 2006 before a verdict could be reached.|$|E
