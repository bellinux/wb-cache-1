5000|$|... "The Sweethearts; or, The Top and the Ball" [...] {{tells of}} the unrequited love {{suffered}} by a mahogany top for a leather ball. When the top discovers the ball years later lying in the dustbin faded and dirty, he refuses to recognize her. The tale is likely based on Andersen's youthful passion for lovely Riborg Voight, a woman who refused his marriage proposal in 1830. He met her again in 1843 when {{she had become a}} frumpy, middle-aged matron. The tale is sometimes viewed as a <b>counterpiece</b> to [...] "The Nightingale" [...] in its ushering out of an old love (Voight) and the welcoming in of a new one (Lind).|$|E
50|$|In Vogel's Tonnetz this chord {{appears to}} be the dual <b>counterpiece</b> of a major seventh chord. This {{interpretation}} is strengthened by the observation that this G-sharp minor chord with an added lower seventh (E-sharp or F is a seventh below the reference of this G-sharp minor chord, the D-sharp) resolves in a E major chord with an added upper seventh (see also the adjoining animated figure). In addition, Wagner's way to set this chord is compatible with this view, with the third (B) and the seventh (F or E-sharp) set in a low register. In Vogel's notation one would note this chord as 7Ud, as the reference note of the G-sharp minor chord is the D-sharp.|$|E
5000|$|Denner {{began his}} career as a painter of miniatures. In 1709 he painted the nine-year-old Charles Frederick, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp and his sister in miniature; Denner was invited to Gottorp Castle and painted himself in the {{background}} of a group portrait of the ducal family. In 1712 he married and the next year he moved to Hamburg when Altona was destroyed by Magnus Stenbock during the Great Nordic War; in 1714 he made a trip to Amsterdam; in 1715 to London; in 1717 to Copenhagen. In 1720 he visited the court in Wolfenbüttel and Hanover. Denner was invited to England, but first he met with Adriaen van der Werff, and showed him his painting of an old woman. Van der Werff was impressed and could only compare the painting with the Mona Lisa. Also in London the painting caused great excitement and it was sent to Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor. [...] Denner received 5875 guilders and in 1725 he was ordered to paint an old man as a <b>counterpiece</b> for the same amount of money. In 1728 he left London because of the smog and sailed to Hamburg.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In {{contrast}} to the rather network-centric notion of Quality of Service (QoS), the concept of Qual-ity of Experience (QoE) has a strongly user-centric per-spective on service quality in communication networks as well as online services. However, related research on QoE so far has largely neglected {{the question of how}} to operationalize quality differentiation and to provide corresponding solutions tailored to the end users. In this paper, we argue that the introduction of Experience Level Agreements (ELA) as QoE-enabled <b>counterpiece</b> to traditional QoS-based Service Level Agreements (SLA) would provide a key step towards being able to sell service quality to the user. Hence, we investigate various ideas to exploit QoE awareness for improving SLAs (ranging from internal aspects like SLOs by service providers to completely novel definitions of ELAs which are able to characterize QoE explicitly), and discuss important problems and challenges of the proposed transition as well...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} the results of the profilometric analysis of wear tracks from tribological tests of a composite material (polymer matrix reinforced with Cu, Zn, Sn particles, and various allotropic forms of SiO 2). The material is recommended for repairing brass made parts. This composite material was tribologically tested in dry friction reciprocating conditions, in ball-on-flat configuration (with a steel ball <b>counterpiece),</b> using the tribotester CETR-UMT- 2 (Bruker Co.). The tests were conducted at normal loads of 20, 30, 40 and 50 N, over a distance of 100 m, at an average sliding speed of 3, 5 mm/s, at room temperature and relative humidity of 50 - 60 %. The wear tracks were analysed with a laser profilometer and the profilometric module of the tribotester CETR-UMT- 2. The profilometric analysis results for the composite are compared to those obtained for brass. Comparing the wear tracks of both materials, it can be found that the composite material has a better tribological behavior than the brass...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, local {{approaches}} {{for determining the}} fatigue strength of welded joints are commonly used in engineering practices, and regulations describe their field of application and guide designers in {{the execution of the}} calculations with numerical methods that are now extensively used. The aim {{of this paper is to}} verify the application of the structural stress approach to a welded joint used in naval construction and repair of particularly complex geometries. The structural detail is a butt weld between two bulb stiffeners, strengthened by a plate (<b>counterpiece)</b> welded above the bevelled but unwelded bulbs. The study has been conducted by following the guidelines of the method recommended by the International Institute of Welding (IIW), and the alternative method proposed by Xiao and Yamada in 2004 has also been applied. Large scale fatigue testing of the aforementioned joints and collapse testing on models, conducted at the DINAV Naval Structure Laboratory, have allowed subsequent comparison: indeed, the numerical analyses have been conducted with no knowledge of the experimental results. The various calculations, carried out in accordance with the standards but with different interpretations, have shown a significant spread of results, highlighting that, in the case of particularly complex geometries, this type of approach is not simple to apply, and the IIW guidelines do not provide an unambiguous method for determining joint fatigue strength. However, from the methods proposed, using those which best meet the general criteria of good FEM modelling and considering other effects certainly present in heavy structures such as misalignments, estimates of joint fatigue lifespan may be obtained which are in substantial agreement with the experimental results...|$|E
