It has an area of 558 km2 (215 sq mi) and its highest point rises to 730 m (2395 ft). This is the first island in the Galápagos Archipelago Charles Darwin visited during his voyage on the Beagle. This <b>islands</b> hosts <b>frigate</b> <b>birds,</b> sea lions, giant tortoises, blue- and red-footed boobies, tropicbirds, marine iguanas, {{dolphins}} and swallow-tailed gulls. Its vegetation includes Calandrinia galapagos, Lecocarpus darwinii, and trees such as Lignum vitae. The largest freshwater lake in the archipelago, Laguna El Junco, is located in the highlands of San Cristóbal. The capital of the province of Galápagos is Puerto Baquerizo Moreno, which lies at the southern tip of the island, and is close to San Cristóbal Airport.|$|R

The nuclear warhead flew toward <b>Christmas</b> <b>Island</b> and detonated in an air burst at 11000 ft.|$|R
50|$|Breeding {{seems to}} occur between May and December in the Australian region. They nest in trees (on <b>Christmas</b> <b>Island)</b> and both sexes {{contribute}} to nest building and incubation and feeding of the young. One egg is laid which takes 6-7 weeks to hatch. Fledglings are not left alone for another seven {{weeks or so}} for fear {{that they may be}} attacked and eaten by other <b>birds</b> including other <b>frigate</b> <b>birds.</b> They remain in the nest for another 6 months or so until fledged but they are cared for and fed by their parents {{for quite a long time}} after that.|$|R
2500|$|Shot <b>Frigate</b> <b>Bird</b> of Operation Dominic I on 6 May 1962, was {{the only}} U.S. test of an {{operational}} submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) with a live nuclear warhead (yield of 600 kilotons), at <b>Christmas</b> <b>Island.</b> In general, missile systems were tested without live warheads and warheads were tested separately for safety concerns. In the early 1960s, however, there mounted technical questions about how the systems would behave under combat conditions (when they were [...] "mated", in military parlance), and this test was meant to dispel these concerns. However, the warhead had to be somewhat modified before its use, and the missile was a SLBM (and not an ICBM), so by itself it did not satisfy all concerns.|$|R
50|$|Thirty-six {{weapons were}} detonated at {{sites in the}} Pacific Ocean in the {{vicinity}} of <b>Christmas</b> <b>Island</b> and Johnston Atoll as part of Operation Dominic I. Though these tests were not conducted in the Marshall Islands, they are officially considered part of the Pacific Proving Grounds. The portion of the Dominic series of tests that were high altitude nuclear explosions were known as Operation Fishbowl, though not all were successful (one detonated on launchpad and resulted in a substantial plutonium contamination). Two of the tests were of operational weapons systems—the ASROC anti-submarine rocket and the Polaris SLBM (the latter test, <b>Frigate</b> <b>Bird,</b> was the only operational submarine-launched ballistic missile test with a live warhead ever undertaken by the USA).|$|R

50|$|<b>Frigate</b> <b>birds</b> {{are built}} for flying; they rarely swim and cannot walk but can manage to climb around {{the trees and}} bushes in which they nest. They have a very light {{skeleton}} and long narrow wings and are masters of the air. Their name probably derives {{from the fact that}} they harass other sea birds such as boobies and tropicbirds as they return to their nests from feeding, forcing them to disgorge their catch, which is then swooped upon and caught by the <b>frigate</b> <b>birds</b> before it reaches the water below. This practice seems to be more common among female <b>frigate</b> <b>birds,</b> but probably only accounts for a fairly small proportion of the diet, which mainly consists of squid and flying fish scooped up {{from the surface of the}} sea.|$|R
