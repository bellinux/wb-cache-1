50|$|Despite {{emerging}} problems, Suntour {{continued to}} achieve a number of innovations, particularly in components for mountain bikes. In partnership with Sugino, it introduced the 110/74mm BCD five-bolt triple crankset for mountain bikes, which soon became an industry standard. Next was {{the introduction of the}} Micro Drive 94/56mm BCD five-bolt compact mountain bike crankset, which saved weight, increased ground clearance, and permitted lower gearing for hill-climbing. New, short-cage rear derailleurs were provided to go with the Micro Drive <b>cassette-type</b> cogsets. The new system was very popular, and Shimano adopted the compact drive concept two years later. SunTour's new thumb and trigger shifters made shifting more convenient when riding off-pavement.|$|E

The engine was a Swissauto 500 cc two-stroke V4 engine, designed as a compact and powerful unit {{which could be used}} in both sidecar racing outfits and solo bikes. It utilised a single balance shaft and a 6-speed <b>cassette-type</b> gearbox. Its crankshaft design allowed for the engine to fire at different angles, allowing the rider to choose either [...] "big-bang" [...] or [...] "screamer" [...] engine characteristics. The engine was housed in a frame designed by Serge Rosset's small ROC firm, based at Annemasse in France. The bike competed in the 1996 and 1997 500 cc World Championships.|$|E
5000|$|The seventh-generation RR, the Honda CBR1000RR, was the {{successor}} to the 2002-03 CBR954RR. While evolving the CBR954RR design, few parts were carried over to the CBR1000RR.

The chassis was likewise all-new, including an organic-style aluminum frame composed of Gravity Die-Cast main sections and Fine Die-Cast steering head structure, inverted fork, Unit Pro-Link rear suspension, radial-mounted front brakes, and a centrally located fuel tank hidden under a faux cover. Additionally, the Honda Electronic Steering Damper (HESD) debuted as an industry first system which aimed to improve stability and help eliminate head shake while automatically adjusting for high and low speed steering effort.|$|E
50|$|The {{product to}} be {{processed}} is fed to the mill centrally via an inlet box {{at the top and}} is pre-crushed by primary beater tools when reaching the top of the rotor. The beaters also accelerate the product, moving it into the milling zone proper, {{at the side of the}} rotor. There the grinding stock fluidised in the air flow is comminuted by the grinding tools (rotor, stator). The stator is formed by a cover enclosing the rotor. The inside of this cover is provided with toothed grooves running vertical, i.e. crosswise to the sense of rotation of the rotor. The outside of the rotor is covered by numerous U-shaped sections which form a deep <b>cassette-type</b> structure. This geometry creates extreme air whirls in the rotor's grinding zone which induce intense secondary comminution processes due to the particles crashing into each other and due to friction and shearing forces. The final particle size can be adjusted over a wide range by changing the grinding rotor clearance, air flow and rotor speed.|$|E

The cognate genes are located on a 5. 6 -kb plasmid within a gene cluster specifying LmrB, an ATP-binding <b>cassette-type</b> multidrug resist-ance transporter protein. LsbA is a hydrophobic peptide that is initially synthesized with an N-terminal exten-sion.

40|$|Macrophage {{migration}} inhibitory factor (MIF) is {{an important}} cytokine involved in the regulation of innate immunity and present at increased levels during inflammatory responses. Here we demonstrate that mature blood and tissue neutrophils constitutively express MIF as a cytosolic protein not associated with azurophil granules. Functionally active MIF, but not proteases stored in azurophil granules, was released from apoptotic neutrophils following short term tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -alpha stimulation in a caspase-dependent manner and prior to any detectable phagocytosis by monocyte-derived macrophages. Moreover, TNF-alpha-mediated MIF release was blocked by glyburide and propenicide, both inhibitors of ATP-binding <b>cassette-type</b> transporters, suggesting that this transporter system is activated during neutrophil apoptosis. Taken together, apoptotic mature neutrophils release MIF upon short term TNF-alpha stimulation. Therefore, apoptosis may not always occur without the induction of pro-inflammatory mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|Alternative mRNA {{splicing}} {{patterns are}} determined by the combinatorial control of regulator proteins and their target RNA sequences. We have recently characterized human hnRNP L as a global regulator of alternative splicing, binding to diverse C/A-rich elements. To systematically identify hnRNP L target genes on a genome-wide level, we have combined splice-sensitive microarray analysis and an RNAi-knockdown approach. As a result, we describe 11 target genes of hnRNP L that were validated by RT-PCR and that represent several new modes of hnRNP L-dependent splicing regulation, involving both activator and repressor functions: first, intron retention; second, inclusion or skipping of <b>cassette-type</b> exons; third, suppression of multiple exons; and fourth, alternative poly(A) site selection. In sum, this approach revealed a surprising diversity of splicing-regulatory processes as well as poly(A) site selection in which hnRNP L is involved...|$|E
40|$|Legume {{plants have}} a unique ability to fix {{atmospheric}} nitrogen via symbiosis with rhizobia. For the establishment of symbiosis, legume plants secrete signaling molecules such as flavonoids from root tissues, leading to the attraction of rhizobia and the induction of rhizobial nod genes. Genistein and daidzein are found in soybean root exudates and function as signal molecules in soybean-Bradyrhizobium japonicum chemical communication. Although {{it is more than}} 20 years since these signal flavonoids were identified, almost nothing has been characterized concerning the membrane transport process of these molecules from soybean roots. To elucidate the transport mechanism we performed membrane transport assays with plasma membrane-enriched vesicles and various inhibitors. As a result, we concluded that an ATP-binding <b>cassette-type</b> transporter is involved in the secretion of genistein from soybean roots. The possible involvement of a pleiotropic drug resistance-type ABC transporter in this secretion is also discussed...|$|E
30|$|Microbial {{fuel cells}} (MFCs) are devices that exploit living {{microbes}} for {{the conversion of}} organic matter into electricity (Logan et al. 2006). Using naturally occurring microbiomes, MFCs are able to generate electricity from organic wastes and wastewater (Watanabe 2008). In particular, MFCs {{are expected to be}} applied to energy-saving WWT (Li et al. 2014), and extensive work has been performed to develop MFC technologies applicable to WWT (Miyahara et al. 2013; Zhang et al. 2013). It has been demonstrated that ASRs can be converted to MFCs by removing aeration apparatuses from aeration tanks and inserting <b>cassette-type</b> electrodes instead (Yoshizawa et al. 2014). Merits expected in using MFCs for WWT include no need of energy for aeration, power generation from pollutants, and possible reduction in waste-sludge production. Although previous studies have evaluated organics-removal efficiencies and power generation in WWT-MFCs (Miyahara et al. 2013; Yoshizawa et al. 2014), limited experimental data are available for the amounts of waste sludge produced in MFCs (Zhang et al. 2013).|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} purification and {{characterization of}} an oligopeptide permease protein (Hly-OppA) from Vibrio furnissii that has multifaceted functions in solute binding, in in vitro hemolysis, in antibiotic resistance, {{and as a}} virulence factor in bacterial pathogenesis. The solute-binding function was revealed by N-terminal and internal peptide sequences of the purified protein and was confirmed by discernible effects on oligopeptide binding, by accumulation of fluorescent substrates, and by fluorescent substrate-antibiotic competition assay experiments. The purified protein exhibited host-specific in vitro hemolytic activity against various mammalian erythrocytes and apparent cytotoxicity in CHO-K 1 cells. Recombinant Hly-OppA protein and an anti-Hly-OppA monoclonal antibody exhibited and neutralized the in vitro hemolytic activity, respectively, which further confirmed the hemolytic activity of the gene product. In addition, a V. furnissii hly-oppA knockout mutant caused less mortality than the wild-type strain when it was inoculated into BALB/c mice, indicating the virulence function of this protein. Finally, the in vitro hemolytic activity was also confirmed with homologous ATP-binding <b>cassette-type</b> transporter proteins from other Vibrio species...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis review {{describes}} a European-funded {{project in the}} area of Synthetic Biology. The project seeks to demonstrate the application of engineering techniques and methodologies to the design and construction of a biosensor for detecting drug–target interactions at the single-molecule level. Production of the proteins required for the system followed the principle of previously described “bioparts” concepts (a system where a database of biological parts – promoters, genes, terminators, linking tags and cleavage sequences – is used to construct novel gene assemblies) and <b>cassette-type</b> assembly of gene expression systems (the concept of linking different “bioparts” to produce functional “cassettes”), but problems were quickly identified with these approaches. DNA substrates for the device were also constructed using a cassette-system. Finally, micro-engineering was used to build a magnetoresistive Magnetic Tweezer device for detection of single molecule DNA modifying enzymes (motors), while the possibility of constructing a Hall Effect version of this device was explored. The device is currently being used to study helicases from Plasmodium as potential targets for anti-malarial drugs, but we also suggest other potential uses for the device...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{constructed}} double deletion (ΔcydCΔcydD and ΔcydCΔpurD) mutants from virulent Brucella abortus biovar 1 field isolate (BA 15) by deleting {{the genes}} encoding an ATP-binding <b>cassette-type</b> transporter (cydC and cydD genes) and a phosphoribosylamine–glycine ligase (purD). Both BA 15 ΔcydCΔcydD and BA 15 ΔcydCΔpurD double-mutants exhibited significant attenuation of virulence when assayed in murine macrophages or in BALB/c mice. Both double-mutants were readily cleared from spleens by 4 weeks post-inoculation even when inoculated at the dose of 108 CFU per mouse. Moreover, the inoculated mice showed no splenomegaly, {{which indicates that}} the mutants are highly attenuated. Importantly, the attenuation of in vitro and in vivo growth did not impair the ability of these mutants to confer long-term protective immunity in mice against challenge with B. abortus strain 2308. Vaccination of mice with either mutant induced humoral and cell-mediated immune responses, and provided significantly better protection than commercial B. abortus strain RB 51 vaccine. These results suggest that highly attenuated BA 15 ΔcydCΔcydD and BA 15 ΔcydCΔpurD mutants can be used effectively as potential live vaccine candidates against bovine brucellosis...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackground: The surface protein PsaA of the {{pathogenic}} bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae plays {{an essential role}} in its virulence. PsaA is a putative ATP-binding <b>cassette-type</b> (ABC-type) binding protein involved in the uptake of Mn 2 + and possibly Zn 2 + and is considered to be both a potential drug target and and a candidate vaccine component. Results: The structure of PsaA has been determined to 2. 0 å resolution using X-ray crystallography and is the first structure obtained for an ABC-type binding protein from a Gram-positive organism. The protein consists of two (β/α) 4 domains linked together by a single helix. A metal-binding site is formed in the domain interface by the sidechains of His 67, His 139, Glu 205 and Asp 280 and is occupied in the structure. Conclusions: The structural topology of PsaA is fundamentally different from that of other ABC-type binding proteins determined thus far in that PsaA lacks the characteristic ‘hinge peptides’ involved in conformational change upon solute uptake and release. In our structure, the metal-binding site is probably occupied by Zn 2 +. The site seems to be well conserved amongst related receptors from both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria...|$|E
40|$|Leaves show {{considerable}} {{variation in}} shape, {{and may be}} described as simple, when the leaf is entire, or dissected, when the leaf is divided into individual leaflets. Here, we report that the SIMPLE LEAF 3 (SIL 3) gene is a novel determinant of leaf shape in Cardamine hirsuta - a dissected-leaved relative of the simple-leaved model species Arabidopsis thaliana. We show that SIL 3 is required for leaf growth and leaflet formation but leaf initiation is less sensitive to perturbation of SIL 3 activity. SIL 3 is further required for KNOX (knotted 1 -like homeobox) gene expression and localized auxin activity maxima, {{both of which are}} known to promote leaflet formation. We cloned SIL 3 and showed that it encodes RLI 2 (RNase L inhibitor 2), an ATP binding <b>cassette-type</b> ATPase with important roles in ribosome recycling and translation termination that are conserved in eukaryotes and archaea. RLI mutants have not been described in plants to date, and this paper highlights the potential of genetic studies in C.  hirsuta to uncover novel gene functions. Our data indicate that leaflet development is sensitive to perturbation of RLI 2 -dependent aspects of cellular growth, and link ribosome function with dissected-leaf development...|$|E
40|$|The {{fibronectin}} {{primary transcript}} undergoes alternative splicing in three noncoordinated sites: the <b>cassette-type</b> EDA and EDB exons {{and the more}} complex IIICS region. We have shown previously that an 81 -nucleotide region within the EDA exon is necessary for exon recognition and that this region contains at least two splicing-regulatory elements: a polypurinic enhancer (exonic splicing enhancer [ESE]) and a nearby silencer element (exonic splicing silencer [ESS]). Here, we have analyzed the function of both elements in different cell types. We have mapped the ESS to the nucleotide level, showing that a single base change is sufficient to abolish its function. Testing of the ESE and ESS elements in heterologous exons, individually {{or as part of}} the complete EDA regulatory region, showed that only the ESE element is active in different contexts. Functional studies coupled to secondary-structure enzymatic analysis of the EDA exon sequence variants suggest that the role of the ESS element may be exclusively to ensure the proper RNA conformation and raise the possibility that the display of the ESE element in a loop position may represent a significant feature of the exon splicing-regulatory region...|$|E
40|$|ZnuA is the soluble {{component}} of the high-affinity ZnuABC zinc transporter belonging to the ATP-binding <b>cassette-type</b> periplasmic Zn-binding proteins. The zinc transporter ZnuABC is composed by three proteins: ZnuB, the membrane permease, ZnuC, the ATPase component and ZnuA, the soluble periplasmic metal-binding protein which captures Zn and delivers it to ZnuB. The ZnuA protein contains a charged flexible loop, rich in histidines and acidic residues, showing significant species-specific differences. Various studies have established that this loop contributes {{to the formation of}} a secondary zinc binding site, which has been proposed to be important in the acquisition of periplasmic Zn for its delivery to ZnuB or for regulation of zinc uptake. Due to its high mobility the structure of the histidine-rich loop has never been solved by X-ray diffraction studies. In this paper, through a combined use of molecular modeling, mutagenesis and fluorescence spectroscopy, we confirm the presence of two zinc binding sites characterized by different affinities for the metal ion and show that the flexibility of the loop is modulated by the binding of the zinc ions to the protein. The data obtained by fluorescence spectroscopy have then be used to validate a 3 D model including the unsolved histidine-rich loop...|$|E
30|$|Castro-Longoria et al. [117] have {{produced}} platinum nanoparticles and their aggregates using the fungus N. crassa. Both intracellular single platinum nanoparticles of 4 - to 3 -nm diameter and spherical agglomerates of 20 - to 110 -nm diameter were produced. A comparison of platinum nanoparticles synthesized from biomass {{was made with}} those prepared from N. crassa extract. It was noticed that the platinum nanoparticles produced from the extract were only single crystal nano-agglomerates. However, the quantity of nanoparticles synthesized extracellularly differs significantly from those prepared intracellularly. Magnetite, Fe 3 O 4 magnetite nanoparticles have been obtained from F. oxysporum and Verticillium sp. [118]. Extracellular synthesis of fairly smaller selenium nanoparticles {{of the order of}} 47  nm from A. terreus was also done in 60  min [119]. It was found that Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Candida glabrata were capable of intracellular production of CdS nanoparticles from cadmium salt in solution [120]. CdS nanoparticle synthesis using S. pombe has been considered to be dependent on a stress protein response [99]. Phytochelatin gets activated on exposure of S. pombe to cadmium and synthesizes phytochelatins. These phytochelatins chelate the cytoplasmic cadmium to phytochelatin–Cd complex. Thereafter, an ATP-binding <b>cassette-type</b> vacuolar protein transports phytochelatin–Cd complex across the vacuolar membrane. Within the vacuole, sulfide gets added to the complex to form a high-molecular-weight phytochelatin CdS− 2 complex/CdS nanocrystal.|$|E
40|$|Previous work {{demonstrated}} that the rabbit smooth muscle myosin heavy chain gene showed sequence divergence at the 25 kDa/ 50 kDa junction of the S 1 subfragment when compared to chicken gizzard and chicken epithelial nonmuscle myosin. RNase protection analysis with a probe spanning this region detected two partially protected fragments which were not present in RNA from vascular tissue and only found in RNA from visceral tissue. The polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify a 162 bp product from primers spanning the putative region of divergence and DNA sequence analysis revealed a seven amino acid insertion not previously detected in other characterised cDNA clones. RNase protection analysis using the PCR product as probe showed that the inserted sequence was expressed exclusively in RNA from visceral tissue. Similar RNA analysis showed that the visceral isoform was not expressed in 20 day fetal rabbit smooth muscle tissues. These {{results indicated that the}} new visceral isoform was expressed in a tissue-specific and developmentally regulated manner. Genomic DNA sequencing and mapping of the exon-intron boundaries showed that the visceral isoform was the product of <b>cassette-type</b> alternative splicing. The inclusion of a visceral-specific sequence near the Mg-ATPase domain and at the 25 kDa/ 50 kDa junction suggests that the visceral isoform may be important for myosin function in smooth muscle cells...|$|E
40|$|An {{apparatus}} for and {{a method}} of triggering a pulsed light source, in particular a laser light source, for predictable capture of the source by video equipment. A frame synchronization signal {{is derived from the}} video signal of a camera to trigger the laser and position the resulting laser light pulse in the appropriate field of the video frame and during the opening of the electronic shutter, if such shutter is included in the camera. Positioning of the laser pulse in the proper video field allows, after recording, for the viewing of the laser light image with a video monitor using the pause mode on a standard <b>cassette-type</b> VCR. This invention also allows for fine positioning of the laser pulse to fall within the electronic shutter opening. For cameras with externally controllable electronic shutters, the invention provides for background light suppression by increasing shutter speed during the frame in which the laser light image is captured. This results in the laser light appearing in one frame in which the background scene is suppressed with the laser light being uneffected, while in all other frames, the shutter speed is slower, allowing for the normal recording of the background scene. This invention also allows for arbitrary (manual or external) triggering of the laser with full video synchronization and background light suppression...|$|E
40|$|Fluconazole-susceptible Candida albicans strains {{accumulated}} [3 H]fluconazole {{at a rate}} {{of approximately}} 2 pmol/min per 10 (9) cells. Fluconazole accumulation was not affected by the pretreatment of cells with sodium azide or with 2 -deoxyglucose. The rate of fluconazole accumulation became saturated at high fluconazole concentrations and was not affected by the addition of ketoconazole, and there was no fluconazole accumulation in cells incubated at 4 degrees C. A fluconazole-resistant mutant of C. albicans SGY- 243 was isolated following growth enrichment in fluconazole-containing medium. Cells of the mutant strain, designated FR 2, showed a reduced rate of fluconazole accumulation compared with SGY- 243 and were not resistant to other azole antifungal agents. The rates of fluconazole accumulation by C. albicans FR 2 and the other azole-resistant strains, B 59630, AD, and KB, were increased in the presence of sodium azide, suggesting that fluconazole resistance in these strains may be associated with an energy-dependent drug efflux. Fluconazole-resistant C. albicans strains all contained elevated amounts (2 - to 17 -fold) of mRNA encoding Cdr 1, and an ATP-binding <b>cassette-type</b> transporter. In addition, C. albicans FR 2 also contained increased amounts of mRNA encoding Benr, a major facilitator superfamily transporter. These results suggest that fluconazole enters C. albicans cells by facilitated diffusion and that fluconazole resistance may involve energy-dependent drug efflux associated with increased expression of Benr and/or Cdr 1...|$|E
40|$|The factors {{involved}} in regulating alternative splicing {{of the human}} adenylyl cyclase stimulatory G-protein G alpha(s) in different cell types remain undefined. We have designed a G alpha(s) minigene that retains the signals required for G alpha(s) alternative splicing in vivo. Employing transient transfection of human myometrial smooth muscle cells and HeLa cells, {{as well as in}} vitro splicing assays, we have provided evidence that the antagonistic splicing factors SF 2 /ASF and hnRNPA 1 act as potent regulators of G alpha(s) isoform expression in these cells. Both SF 2 /ASF and hnRNPA 1 control the selection of competing 5 '-splice sites and respectively promote inclusion or skipping of the small <b>cassette-type</b> exon 3 of G alpha(s) transcripts, resulting in the generation of G alpha(s) -long and G alpha(s) -short mRNA isoforms. We have also provided evidence that SF 2 /ASF and hnRNPA 1 play a role in 3 '-splice site selection involving the use of a non-canonical TG 3 '-splice site preceding exon 4. Using a score-matrix analysis to identify putative exonic enhancer sequences (ESEs), we found multiple high score ESE motifs for SF 2 /ASF, SC 35, and SRp 40 in exon 3 of G alpha(s). These results suggest that tissue-specific expression of SF 2 /ASF and hnRNPA 1 governs the expression of alternative isoforms of G alpha(s) in these different cells types...|$|E
40|$|ZnuA is the soluble {{component}} of the high-affinity ZnuABC zinc transporter belonging to the cluster 9 group of ATP-binding <b>cassette-type</b> periplasmic Zn- and Mn-binding proteins. In Gram-negative bacteria, the ZnuABC system is essential for zinc uptake and homeostasis and is an important determinant of bacterial resistance to the host defense mechanisms. The cluster 9 members share a two (α/β) (4) domain architecture with a long α-helix connecting the two domains. In the Zn-specific proteins, the so-called α 3 c and the α 4 helices are separated by an insert of variable length, rich in histidine and negatively charged residues. This distinctive His-rich loop is proposed {{to play a role}} in the management of zinc also due to its location at the entrance of the metal binding site located at the domain interface. The known Synechocystis 6803 and Escherichia coli ZnuA structures show the same metal coordination involving three conserved histidines and a glutamic acid or a water molecule as fourth ligand. The structures of Salmonella enterica ZnuA, with a partially or fully occupied zinc binding site, and of a deletion mutant missing a large part of the His-rich loop revealed unexpected differences in the metal-coordinating ligands, as histidine 140 from the mobile (at the C-terminal) part of the loop substitutes the conserved histidine 60. This unforeseen coordination is rendered possible by the "open conformation" of the two domains. The possible structural determinants of these peculiarities and their functional relevance are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The amiloride-sensitive {{epithelial}} {{sodium channel}} (ENaC) {{contributes to the}} regulation of the sodium balance and blood pressure because it mediates a rate-limiting step in sodium transport across the epithelium of the distal nephron. The activity of ENaC is regulated by hormones, such as aldosterone and vasopressin, and by other intracellular or extracellular factors, but the mechanisms of these regulations are not yet well understood. It has been proposed that ENaC may be regulated by an associated ATP-binding cassette protein such as the cystic fibrosis conductance regulator or the K channel-associated sulfonylurea receptor. Glibenclamide, a known inhibitor of sulfonylurea receptor and cystic fibrosis conductance regulator, induced a dose-dependent and reversible stimulation (of the order of 40 - 50 %) of the amiloride-sensitive current in oocytes expressing Xenopus ENaC, with a K 1 / 2 of 45 +/- 5 microM. A similar effect was observed in oocytes expressing human ENaC, but not rat ENaC. Measurements performed with various combinations of rat and Xenopus subunits indicated that several subunits {{are involved in this}} effect. Glibenclamide also increased the transepithelial Na transport by the A 6 Xenopus kidney cell line. Single-channel current recordings showed a doubling of the number of the open channels when glibenclamide was applied locally to the extracellular surface of the cell membrane. These results support the hypothesis of the existence of an associated ATP-binding <b>cassette-type</b> regulatory protein associated with the epithelial sodium channel...|$|E

However, limited information {{is available on the}} ability of this peptidolytic organism to bind or transport soluble peptides present in the subgingival environment. A prominent 70 -kDa protein was isolated from surface extracts of T. denticola ATCC 35405. A clone expressing a portion of the protein was identified in an Escherichia coli expression library of T. denticola DNA. DNA sequence analysis showed that the cloned gene encoded a peptide homologous to OppA, the solute binding protein of an ATP-binding <b>cassette-type</b> peptide transporter involved in peptide uptake and environmental signaling {{in a wide range of}} bacteria. Genes encoding OppB, -C, -D, and -F were identified directly downstream of oppA in T. denticola. OppA was present in representative strains of T. denticola and in Treponema vincentii but was not detected in Treponema pectinovorum or Treponema socranskii. Immunogold electron microscopy suggested that OppA was accessible to proteins at the surface of the spirochete. Native OppA bound soluble plasminogen and fibronectin but did not bind to immobilized substrates or epithelial cells. A T. denticola oppA mutant bound reduced amounts of soluble plasminogen, and plasminogen binding to the parent strain was inhibited by the lysine analog ɛ-aminocaproic acid. Binding of soluble host proteins by OppA may be important both for spirochete-host interactions in the subgingival environment and for uptake of peptide nutrients...|$|E

The sulfonates are cleaved monooxygenolytically to yield the corresponding phenols. miniTn 5 mutants of strain S- 313 which were no longer able to desulfurize arylsulfonates were isolated and were found to carry transposon insertions in the ssuEADCBF operon, which contained genes for an ATP-binding <b>cassette-type</b> transporter (ssuABC), a two-component reduced flavin mononucleotide-dependent monooxygenase (ssuED) closely related to the Escherichia coli alkanesulfonatase, and a protein related to clostridial molybdopterin-binding proteins (ssuF). These mutants were also deficient in growth with a variety of other organosulfur sources, including aromatic and aliphatic sulfate esters, methionine, and aliphatic sulfonates other than the natural sulfonates taurine and cysteate. This pleiotropic phenotype was complemented by the ssu operon, confirming its key role in organosulfur metabolism in this species. Further complementation analysis revealed that the ssuF gene product was required for growth with all of the tested substrates except methionine and that the oxygenase encoded by ssuD was required for growth with sulfonates or methionine. The flavin reductase SsuE was not required for growth with aliphatic sulfonates or methionine but was needed for growth with arylsulfonates, suggesting that an alternative isozyme exists for the former compounds that is not active in transformation of the latter substrates. Aryl sulfate ester utilization was catalyzed by an arylsulfotransferase, and not by an arylsulfatase as in the related species Pseudomonas aeruginosa...|$|E

Alternative splicing is regulated developmentally and physiologically by the combinatorial actions of cis- and trans-acting factors, including RNA binding proteins that regulate splicing through sequence-specific interactions with pre-mRNAs. In T cells, the splicing regulator hnRNP L is an essential factor that regulates alternative splicing of physiologically important mRNAs, however the broader physical and functional impact of hnRNP L remains unknown. In this dissertation, I present analysis of hnRNP L-RNA interactions with CLIP-seq, which identifies transcriptome-wide binding sites and uncovers novel functional targets. I then use functional genomics studies to define pre-mRNA processing alterations induced by hnRNP L depletion, chief among which is <b>cassette-type</b> alternative splicing. Finally, I use integrative genomic analysis to identify a direct role for hnRNP L in repression of exon inclusion and an indirect role for enhancing exon inclusion that supports a novel regulatory interplay between hnRNP L and chromatin. In two appendices, I present CLIP-seq studies of two additional RNA binding proteins: the splicing factor CELF 2 and the RNA helicase DDX 17. In conclusion, I provide comparisons of these three CLIP-seq studies, providing high-level insights into the capabilities and limitations of CLIP-seq. In sum, this dissertation expands our knowledge of hnRNP L splicing control in the context of broader studies of RNA binding proteins in multiple cell types and conditions. ...|$|E
40|$|Extraction of Lactobacillus fermentum BR 11 {{cells with}} 5 M LiCl yielded a {{preparation}} containing a single predominant polypeptide with an apparent molecular mass of 32 kDa. A clone encoding an immunoreactive 32 -kDa polypeptide was isolated from a pUC 18 library of L. fermentum BR 11 DNA by screening with an antiserum raised against whole cells of L. fermentum BR 11. Sequence {{determination of the}} insert in the clone revealed a complete 795 -bp open reading frame (ORF) that defines a 28, 625 -Da polypeptide (BspA). N-terminal sequencing of the LiCl-extracted polypeptide from L. fermentum BR 11 confirmed {{that it is the}} same as the cloned BspA. BspA was found to have a sequence similar to those of family III of the bacterial solute-binding proteins. The sequences of two ORFs upstream of bspA are consistent with bspA being located in an operon encoding an ATP-binding <b>cassette-type</b> uptake system. Unusually, BspA contains no lipoprotein cleavage and attachment motif (LXXC), despite its origin in a gram-positive bacterium. Biotin labelling and trypsin digestion of whole cells indicated that this polypeptide is exposed on the cell surface. The isoelectric point as predicted from the putative mature sequence is 10. 59. It was consequently hypothesized that the positively charged BspA is anchored by electrostatic interaction with acidic groups on the cell surface. It was shown that BspA could be selectively removed from the surface by extraction with an acidic buffer, thus supporting this hypothesis...|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of high pressure (HP) for food preservation requires insight into mechanisms of HP-mediated cell injury and death. The HP inactivation in model beer of Lactobacillus plantarum TMW 1. 460, a beer-spoiling organism, was investigated at pressures ranging from 200 to 600 MPa. Surviving cells {{were characterized by}} determination of (i) cell viability and sublethal injury, (ii) membrane permeability to the fluorescent dyes propidium iodide (PI) and ethidium bromide (EB), (iii) metabolic activity with tetrazolium salts, and (iv) the activity of HorA, an ATP binding <b>cassette-type</b> multidrug resistance transporter conferring resistance to hop compounds. HP inactivation curves exhibited a shoulder, an exponential inactivation phase, and pronounced tailing caused by a barotolerant fraction of the population, about 1 in 106 cells. During exponential inactivation, more than 99. 99 % of cells were sublethally injured; however, no sublethal injury was detected in the barotolerant fraction of the culture. Sublethally injured cells were metabolically active, and loss of metabolic activity corresponded to the decrease of cell viability. Membrane damage measured by PI uptake occurred later than cell death, indicating that dye exclusion {{may be used as}} a fail-safe method for preliminary characterization of HP inactivation. An increase of membrane permeability to EB and a reduction of HorA activity were observed prior to the loss of cell viability, indicating loss of hop resistance of pressurized cells. Even mild HP treatments thus abolished the ability of cells to survive under adverse conditions...|$|E
40|$|The primary {{transcript}} of fibronectin undergoes alternative splicing in the <b>cassette-type</b> EDA and EDB exons {{and in the}} IIICs segment to generate different protein isoforms. Human carotid atherosclerotic plaques with a more stable phenotype are enriched with EDA containing fibronectin (FN-EDA). The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the role of EDA containing fibronectin during atherogenesis. Mice constitutively expressing or lacking the EDA domain of fibronectin (EDA+/+ or EDA-/-) were crossed with ApoE-/- or LDL-R-/- mice and fed with a western type diet for 12 weeks. Lack of FN-EDA resulted in reduced atherosclerosis and in a plaque phenotype characterised by decreased calponin positive VSMC's (- 15 [*]%) and increased macrophages (+ 20 [*]%). This was paralleled by increased MMP 2, MMP 9, and reduced TIMP 2, collagen 1 A 1, 1 A 2 and 3 A 1 gene expression compared to that of wild-type and EDA+/+ mice. In vitro, VSMCs and macrophages isolated from EDA-/- miceshowed increased MMPs expression and activity compared to wild-type or EDA+/+ mice. Albumin-Cre recombinase/EDA+/+/ApoE-/- mice, which produceEDA containing FN only in peripheral tissues, presented an extension, a composition and a gene expression pattern in the atherosclerotic lesions similar to that of controls. The inclusion of EDA in FN results in larger atherosclerotic plaques compared to mice lacking EDA but with a more favourable phenotype in two animals models of atherosclerosis. This effect depends on the EDA-containing fibronectin produced by cells in the vasculature but not in the liver. These observations set the stage for investigating the properties of circulating EDA containing FN in improving plaque stability...|$|E
