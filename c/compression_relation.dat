40|$|Concrete {{confined}} by stirrups {{with greater}} ductility than unconfined concrete {{has been used}} widely in reinforced concrete (RC) structures and its behavior is the classic topic. As the computer power is improving, {{an increasing number of}} modelling studies of the confined concrete using finite element (FE) methods have emerged in recent years. Aiming at developing a FE model to evaluate the behavior of concrete confined by stirrups in square RC columns, a new uniaxial <b>compression</b> stress-strain <b>relation</b> of concrete considering the confinement effect of stirrups was proposed. In the FE model, the behavior of confined concrete was described by combining the concrete damaged plasticity model with the proposed uniaxial <b>compression</b> stress-strain <b>relation</b> of confined concrete. Then, tested square RC columns confined by stirrups under axial load were simulated and the details of the FE model were described. Though the comparison between the predicted and measured curves of axial load N versus axial strain, the proposed uniaxial compressive model of confined concrete was verified. Finally, a parametric study of the effects of strength of stirrup and equal strength replacement of stirrups on the behavior of confined concrete was conducted...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Sandwich {{structures}} {{consisting of}} high-modulus thin skins and a low-modulus thick core {{are sensitive to}} local loading, which causes local indentation. Classical approaches deter-mine the deflection of sandwich structures by a superposition method where the local compres-sion of the core for a panel on a rigid foundation is added to global sandwich bending without core compression. In this article, a sandwich plate is analyzed using a higher-order sandwich panel theory (HOSPT) where the faces are modelled by classical laminate theory and the core by a three-dimensional elasticity solution. The results are obtained from 14 partial differential equa-tions for displacements of the faces and core. HOSPT determines core compression with a second-order distribution of displacement through the core thickness. The force versus core <b>compression</b> <b>relations</b> in the fully backed and clamped states are compared and it is shown that the core compression assumed in the classical approach differs from the core compression in a clamped state. Results are verified by ANSYS FEM software and experimental data. A few sandwich panel specimens were made with glass reinforced plastic (GRP) skins and a polyure-thane foam core. Results from indentation tests on the panels are compared with finite element, HOSPT, and other theories...|$|R

All Zone 2 lesions (36 cases) resulted in paralysis of the intrinsic muscles. Whether or not the hypothenar muscles were affected was dependent upon the location of the lesions within Zone 2.

It is noted that the AE hits increase first at a slow rate before the stress reaches the peak strength. At this interval, only few AE signals are captured by the sensors. However, when the stress reaches the peak stress, {{a large amount of}} AE hits are observed accounted for the unstable crack propagation. The AE signals have a concentrated release, with the cracks in concrete specimen generating, nucleating, intersecting and finally forming into the main cracks. After the peak stress, a sharp increase in AE hits is observed. The damage at this stage has a very quick development, with an obvious decrease in the axial load. After that, the AE hits are few, resulted in a slow increase in the cumulative AE hits. The damage of concrete specimen at this interval is mainly caused by the main cracks and the damage index at this stage is verging to a constant approaching to one. From the above analysis, it is noted that the releasing process of AE signals is closely related to the damage process of concrete. Roughly speaking, the variation process of the cumulative AE hits can be used to represent the damage evolution of concrete.|$|R

Electron ground states were calculated for NiAl in the CsCl structure, using ab initio pseudopotentials and density functional theory (DFT), and were used to predict the cold compression curve and the density of phonon states. It was desirable to interpolate and smooth the cold compression states; the Rose form of compression curve was found to reproduce the ab initio calculations well in compression but exhibited significant deviations in expansion.

The space environment is the physical vacuum, whose properties are currently still in the formative stage. Gravity is the result of the interaction of the physical vacuum with material bodies which are moving. Gravity explains by the properties of space <b>compression</b> in <b>relation</b> to moving material bodies. Differential equations of motion of the major planets, the Moon and the Sun have been obtained. It should be noted that the system of differential equations does not contain the mass of bodies and force interactions, in addition, the Earth is considered as a spheroid. By numerical integration of the equations of motion coordinates of the Moon, the Sun and major planets osculating elements of the orbits of the inner planets during 1602 – 2193 are computed. The results of calculations are compared with the coordinates and orbital elements determined according to the coordinates and velocities DE 405. It is shown that in contrast to Newtonian mechanics and relativistic equations of motion, the coordinates of the major planets of the Moon and the Sun, based on the solution of a new system of differential equations, are in satisfactory agreement with the coordinates of these objects obtained using data bank DE 405. The resulting equations do not contain terms that take into account the non-sphericity of the Earth and the Moon, being a non-relativistic equations.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A new {{cohesive}} micromechanical modeling {{framework is}} presented for the progressive damage analysis of laminated composite materials and structures. The cohesive micromechanics (CM) modeling approach {{is based on}} simplified 3 D unit cell with incremental and damage formulations. The unidirectional CM model formulated in this paper is implemented in a local–global nonlinear damage modeling framework that recognizes the fiber and matrix constituents along with the cohesive interface/interphase subcells at the lower level. The cohesive elements are embedded between the fiber–fiber, fiber–matrix, and matrix–matrix subcells. Separate tension and <b>compression</b> traction-separation constitutive <b>relations</b> are used for the cohesive subcells in order to degrade the traction and internal resisting force across the plane between the two adjacent constituents. As a result, progressive damage modeling in the structural level can be achieved at the micromechanical level while maintaining the full advantage of using concurrent nonlinear micromechanical modeling prior and during damage progression spanning the entire structure. The proposed CM damage framework allows nonlinear anisotropic response, including strain softening, and damaged elastic loading/unloading behavior. Robust and efficient numerical stress correction algorithms have been also developed {{in order to satisfy}} the local traction continuity and strain compatibility of the micromechanical model. The effectiveness of the proposed modeling approach is demonstrated by predicting the response of composite plates with an open hole under tension and compression loading using available test results from the literature...|$|R

Stem straightness was measured on the same 440 trees in 1986 and 1997. The number of stems with straight base sections increased from 60 % in 1986 to 89 % in 1997. Measurements of 72 sample trees in 2001 showed that 96 % of the trees had developed straight stem bases. External geometry data of the logs was obtained with a Rema 3 D log scanner. A sub-sample of 16 trees was randomly selected for analysis of compression wood distribution and eccentric-ity measurements. From each tree, 11 discs were cut at every 60 cm along the stem. All discs, except one, contained compression wood. Compression wood and pith eccentricity was most pronounced near the stem base but not significantly correlated to basal sweep. Severe compression wood content was correlated to pith eccentricity and bow height. In general, correlations were better for the basal sections of the logs. Even though most trees were straight, they contained large amounts of compression wood. It is evident that eccentric growth and compression wood formation play major roles {{in the development of}} stem straightness.

40|$|Objective: To {{summarize}} the currently published scientific {{evidence for the}} venous flow effects of mechanical devices, particularly intermittent pneumatic <b>compression,</b> and the <b>relation</b> to prevention of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Summary Background Data: While intermittent pneumatic compression is an established method of DVT prophylaxis, the variety of systems that are available can use very different compression techniques and sequences. In order for appropriate choices {{to be made to}} provide the optimum protection for patients, the general performance of systems, and physiological effects of particular properties, must be analyzed objectively. Methods: Medline was searched from 1970 to 2002, and all relevant papers were searched for further appropriate references. Papers were selected for inclusion when they addressed specifically the questions posed in this review. Results: All the major types of intermittent compression systems are successful in emptying deep veins of the lower limb and preventing stasis in a variety of subject groups. Compression stockings appear to function more by preventing distension of veins. Rapid inflation, high pressures, and graded sequential intermittent compression systems will have particular augmentation profiles, but {{there is no evidence that}} such features improve the prophylactic ability of the system. Conclusions: The most important factors in selecting a mechanical prophylactic system, particularly during and after surgery, are patient compliance and the appropriateness of the site of compression.

40|$|The {{deformation}} behaviour of chrome tanned {{crust leather}} (with or without fatliquor) and finished leather has been measured in three-point bend, tensile and <b>compression</b> tests. <b>Relations</b> between the experimental {{results and the}} perceived softness of the leather were investigated. The instrumentally assessed softness {{of a set of}} leathers was represented by parameters obtained from these tests and compared with a quantified subjective assessment. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) was used to analyse the water status in crust leathers. The influence of water content prior to staking on its softening effect was investigated. An orthogonal experiment was applied to investigate the influence of various factors (e. g. amplitude and frequency) on the softening effect of mechanical action to obtain an optimum combination of these factors. The bending force, F, increased in a linear way with increasing sample width, w, in accordance with the standard theory of beam bending. However the change in F with increasing sample thickness, t, departed (markedly in some cases) from the standard theory. The theory of laminated materials offered a quantitative description of the dependency provided that the grain and corium layers were regarded as the laminae. F was approximately proportional to the actual bending length raised to a power between - 2 and - 3. An empirical equation {{based on the results of}} the bend testing was developed. A parameter, Se/tn, can be used to rank the softness of leather, where Se is equivalent to the bending stiffness in standard bending theory, and n is the approximate index in the power function describing the relationship of the bending force F to the sample thickness t for a particular type of leather. A model describing the compression behaviour of crust leather is proposed which involves four stages of compression: (i) hair-like fibres being bent flat onto the surface and buckling of vertical fibre bundles, (ii) closing up of voids between fibre bundles, (iii) closing up of voids between fibres, and (iv) compressing of solid fibres. DSC results indicate that water has a stronger interaction with collagen molecules in an unfatliquored leather than in a fatliquored one. Fatliquor appears to function as a shield between water and collagen. The influence of water content prior to staking on the resulting softening effect was clearly reflected in bending and tensile tests, but was not nearly so evident in a compression test. It is shown that a maximum softening effect can be obtained in the staking process when moisture content is about 30 - 40 %...|$|R

The research was aimed at gaining some fundamental insight {{in the operation of}} the Pulsed Compression Reactor (PCR) in general, as well as the specific application for syngas generation from methane. The research can be divided into three parts: an investigation of heat transfer from the hot gas to the reactor walls and piston, an investigation of the chemistry of both partial oxidation of methane as well as steam reforming and the investigation of the stability of the PCR piston reciprocation. To investigate the heat transfer from the hot gas to the reactor walls and piston two approaches were used. This was used to derive an empirical relation between the heat loss from the compressed gas in a single shot reactor and the <b>compression</b> pressure. This <b>relation</b> gives insight into the effect that the reactor walls and piston have on the chemistry occurring in the single shot reactor. In the investigation of syngas generation from methane, the chemistry of both partial oxidation and steam reforming of methane were investigated in a single shot reactor. This was done both experimentally and by simulations of the process using models with detailed chemistry. Lastly, an analysis of the experimental and numerical data obtained yielded a theory that describes the behavior of the PCR in continuous reciprocation with respect to reciprocation stability. It was shown that, if a point exists where the energy release of chemical reactions exactly compensates the energy losses, reciprocation will always converge to this point or cease. This is an important result with respect to the safety issues associated with the PCR operation...|$|R
40|$|This thesis gives {{a summary}} and {{discussion}} of results from five studies concerned with: the distribution of <b>compression</b> wood in <b>relation</b> to external stem and log geometry {{and the impact of}} the compression wood distribution on deformations of sawn timber. Moreover the straightening process of trees is discussed. In order to study the distribution of compression wood in stems and logs, 63 trees of Norway spruce and Scots pine representing different age and curvature categories were sliced into 621 discs. In order to study the impact of compression wood on deformations of sawn timber, 146 logs of Scots pine and Norway spruce were processed into studs and battens. Before crosscutting, the external geometry of stems and logs were assessed. A 3 D-logscanner was used for the assessment of logs. Deformations such as bow, spring and twist were measured on studs and battens at green condition, at 18 % moisture content and at 12 % moisture content. Compression wood content in thin cross sections of discs, studs and battens were analysed using transmitted light and image analysis. The analyses showed that a majority of all discs and cross sections contained compression wood. In all studies, the pith eccentricity was significantly correlated to the discs´ compression wood content. For the 6 -year-old Scots pine trees, the compression wood content was significantly correlated to the size of basal sweep but not to out-of-roundness. For the 22 -year-old Scots pine trees, the compression wood content was not correlated to either bow height or size of basal sweep. For the 60 -year-old Norway spruce trees, the compression wood content was significantly correlated to compression wood content in log ends, pith eccentricity and bow height. For sawn timber, the compression wood content and its position was significantly correlated to bow and spring but not twist. Twist was significantly correlated to grain angle measured on tangential faces of studs and spiral grain angle measured under bark on the surface of logs. Results indicate that eccentric growth and compression wood formation play major roles in the development of stem straightness. Moreover, young trees with basal sweep will be straighter over time. Consequently, the straightness of a log is not a reliable measure of the compression wood content within the stem. By combining data describing external geometry with information regarding compression wood content and pith eccentricity obtained from log ends it is possible to detect logs that are prone to contain compression wood. The results also indicate that the distribution of compression wood in sawn timber influences the direction and size of bow and spring...|$|R

Experiments, conducted under a high temperature and strain rate, show e. g. that blocky and straight strings are recrystallised and that fine extinction bands are often erased after a certain amount of strain. The true relationship between the different intracrystalline deformation features needs, however, to be assessed more elaborately. Moreover, there is still a need for detailed observations in naturally deformed quartz with different deformation histories, in order to properly correlate the experimental conditions with the ambient conditions in the earth’s crust. This study focuses on vein quartz (de) formed in a low-temperature regime, in order to survey the pre-recrystallisation stages {{in the history of the}} intracrystalline microstructures. In this respect, to avoid any genetic connotation, we suggest the use a purely descriptive terminology: fine extinction bands (instead of deformation lamellae), wide extinction bands (instead of e. g. deformation bands), blocky strings and straight strings (instead of e. g. shear bands). In the vein quartz of well-studied veins in subgreenschist metamorphic metapelites of the High-Ardenne slate belt (Belgium, France, Germany), all deformation features summarised above have been recognised. Extensive optical microscopy on the vein quartz showed that the microstructures appear geometrically related and that the appearance of the strings strongly depends on the presence of other deformation microstructures. Additionally, the structures are often hardly distinguishable with optical microscopy. As such, blocky strings appear to continue into wide extinction bands and sometimes into divergent fine extinction bands. Furthermore, in all crystals containing strings, fine extinction bands are present. If there is only one set of fine extinction bands present, they mostly parallel a set of strings. If two sets of extinction bands are present, both sets can either parallel the strings, or parallel the bisectors of the strings. Furthermore, wide extinction bands, blocky and straight strings are very often bounded by healed fractures. The geometrical relationship observed, can suggest (1) a similar formation mechanism for the different microstructures, (2) a weakening effect for successive microstructure formation or (3) a dependency on the crystallography. More results of an integrated approach using optical microscopy, SEM-CL, EBSD-OIM and U-Stage are discussed and compared to the variety of models that have been suggested in literature. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|O Grupo de Estudos e Pesquisas em Concreto, 'GEPECON', desenvolveu um acervo de pesquisas, sobre concreto com adições minerais nos últimos 10 anos. De posse destes trabalhos, tomou-se a iniciativa em reunir dados de alguns projetos e analisá-Ios estatisticamente. O presente trabalho teve por objetivo estudar a influência das variáveis independentes (relação água/aglomerante, resistência à compressão, tipo e teor de adição mineral), nas variáveis dependentes da microestrutura e durabilidade do concreto através de ferramentas estatísticas. Foi utilizada análise de variância, regressão linear simples e múltipla para que se pudesse descobrir qual das variáveis independentes foi de maior significância para essas propriedades do concreto. Os dados foram analisados em cinco projetos e, posteriormente, reunidos por variáveis para realizar a análise estatística. No modelo geral, através da regressão linear múltipla, as variáveis. independentes que mais influenciaram as variáveis dependentes da microestrutura foram o teor de adição e a resistência à compressão e, para a durabilidade, o teor e o tipo de adição. Já nos modelos individuais, com a regressão linear simples, as variáveis independentes que mais se destacaram no teor de água combinada e hidróxido de cálcio remanescente foram o teor e o tipo de adição; na porosimetria, a resistência à compressão e a relação água/aglomerante e para as variáveis dependentes da durabilidade, a relação água/aglomerante e resistência à compressão, foram, nesta ordem, os mais significativos. Para o tipo de adição, as misturas binárias com CCA e CV, as ternárias CCA-CV na microestrutura e CV-E na durabilidade apresentaram maior influência. O teor de adição de maior significância foi 25 % para a microestrutura e 70 % para a durabilidade. Com base nessas análises, evidenciaram-se os resultados da. regressão linear simples que apresentaram uma maior dispersão e significância mais fraca do que os da regressão linear múltipla, o que já era esperado. The GEPECON, Studies and Researches Concrete Group, has {{developed}} a researches collection about the concrete with mineral additions over the last 10 years. Starting from these papers we have decided to gather some projects data to be statistically analyzed. The present paper had the objective of studying {{the influence of the}} independent variables (water/binder <b>relation,</b> <b>compression</b> strength, type and content of mineral addition) on the dependent variables of microstructure and durability of the concrete through the micro-statistic tools. The variance analysis and the sim pie and multiple lineal regression were applied 50 {{that it was possible to}} determine which was the most significant independent variable for these concrete properties. Data were analyzed in five projects and later they were gathered by variables in order to accomplish the statistical analysis. In the general model, through the multiple lineal regression, the independent variables which has been exerted more influence on the dependent variables were the addition content and the compression strength, while for durability they were the content and the addition type. However, in the single models with the simple lineal regression, the most highlighted independent variables on the content of combined water and remainder calcium hydroxide were the content and the addition type; in the poresymmetry they were the compression strength and the water/binder relation, while for the dependent variables of the durability the water/binder <b>relation</b> and the <b>compression</b> strength were, respectively, the most significant ones. For the addition type, the most influent mixtures were the binary mixtures with CCA and CV, the ternary ones CCA-CV on the microstructure and CV-E on the durability. The most significant addition content was 25 % for the microstructure and 70 % for the durability. As it was already expected, starting from these analyzes has been emphasized the results of the sim pie lineal regression that showed a larger dispersion and lower significance in relation to the ones of the multiple lineal regression...|$|R
40|$|By use of four {{compression}} {{vessels of}} triangle, square, circle and large circle, {{the characteristics of}} the maximum compression stress, the compression force, the relaxation modulus, the restoration force and the restorating strength of rice straw sheaf by changing conditions of straw were determined. The results were obtained as follows; （ 1 ） The maximum compression stress σ_ increased exponentially with increase of compression ratio c. The order of each maximum compression stress of these section shapes at high compression ratio was as follow, triangle＞square＞circle, and large circle＞small circle. （ 2 ） At the range of experimental speed （ 15 ～ 60 cm/min）, the maximum compression stress was almost constant without regard to the compression speed. （ 3 ） The maximum compression stress at the next day after harvest was slightly larger than that at harvest day, but that for a period of five days after harvest decreased by about half of that at harvest day. （ 4 ） On the characteristics of <b>compression</b> curves, the <b>relation</b> between <b>compression</b> force F_c and time t was expressed in the form F_c＝α exp βt, and the order of inclination of straightlines on the semilogarithmic coordinate was as follow, triangle＞square＞small circle＞large circle. From the above facts, it was considered that the circular section is desirable than that of triangle or square. （ 5 ） On the characteristics of relaxation curves, the relation between relaxation stress σ and lapse time t_l after compression was expressed as in the equation σ= at^ _l, and all the slopes b of straightlines on the logarithmic coordinates were found to be equal without regard to the section or the compression ratio if the straws were the same. （ 6 ） The b values at the next day were equal to those at harvest day, but those for a period of five days after harvest decreased slightly. From the above facts, {{it became clear that the}} b value indicates the rheological characteristics of straw. （ 7 ） The relaxation moduli E（t） increased with the increase of the compression ratio c, whereas the slope for circular section especially for smaller circle was found to be gradual. （ 8 ） In Fig. 11, three restoration forces （F_ 2, F_ 3, F_ 4 ） and the increase restoration force （F_ 3 -F_ 2 ） were found to increase with the incerase of compression ratio c and with the decrease of restoration ratio if （see Fig. 2 also）. There was almost no difference between the initial value F_ 3 of relaxation curve after restoration and the value F_ 4 after one minute, but F_ 4 value was slightly decreased from F_ 3 value when the compression ratio is large and restoration ratio is small. （g） Generally speaking the restorating strength V_R seemed to have a tendency to increase with the increase of compression ratio, but in reality the influence of restoration ratio on V_R does not seem to have a constant tendency due to variation of compression ratio. From the above results, it was expected that the minimum compression ratio would be obtained, the unavailable power for compression would be reduced and the reduction of restoration force depending upon the excessive compression would also be defended, if the minimum force to pull straw from a binding sheaf and the slack of sheaf （restoration ratio） on the marketed grain binders become known. 既製バインダの結束部の設計と構造の適否,すなわち,稲わらが束から抜けない：最小締付力（復元力）を得るための圧縮率の最小値を見出すことを目的として,稲わら束の圧縮性,復元性につき基礎実験を行なった. 東圧縮断面形状を三角,四角,円の 3 種,圧縮前の面積は 100 cm^ 2 （小）で,円のみ 200 cm^ 2 （大）も加え,加圧容器にわらを並べ,圧縮率を 12. 5 から 50 ％まで 4 段階,圧縮速度を 15 から 60 cm/minまで 4 段階,経日変化を刈取直後（含水率 68. 9 ％）, 1 日後（ 65. 0 ％）, 5 日後（ 14. 4 ％）の 3 段階にわけ,最大圧縮応力,圧縮曲線と緩和曲線の特性,緩和弾性率,復元力,復元強度などを測った結果,次のことがわかった. 1. 最大圧縮応力σ_ は圧縮率cの大なるほど,いずれも指数関数的に増大し,cの大なるときのσ_ の大きさは,三角＞四角＞円となり,また大円＞小円となる. 2. 本実験の圧縮速度vの範囲内では,vが変ってもσ_ はほとんど変らない. 3 ・経日変化ではσ_ は刈取 1 日後が刈取直後よりやや大きく, 5 日後になると約半減する. 4. 庄縮曲線の特性をみるに,経過時間tと圧縮力F_cとの間には片対数グラフで直線となり,F_c ＝ α exp βt なる関係式が得られ,直線の傾斜は三角＞四角＞小円＞大円となる. 以上の各項から束断面形状は従来型に多い三角形より円形に圧縮するのが妥当である. 5. 応力緩和曲線の特性をみるに,圧縮完了後からの停止時間t_lと緩和応力σとは両対数グラフで直線となり, σ = at^ _l なる関係式が得られ,わら材料が同一なら,束断面や圧縮率に関係なく常に勾配b値は同一である. 6. 経日変化の応力緩和曲線に対する影響をみるに,刈取直後と 1 日後では直線勾配b値は同一であるが, 5 日後では傾斜が変化しゆるくなる. これらより,b値はわらのレオロジカルな特性を示す値であることがわかる. 7. 緩和弾性率E（t）は初期歪ε_o（圧縮率c）の増加につれ増加し,円では傾斜がゆるく,小円では特に顕著である. 8. 三つの各復元力値F_ 2,F_ 3,F_ 4 と増加復元力値F_ 3 -F_ 2 は,ともに圧縮率cの大なるほど,また復元率ηの小なるほど大となる. 復元後の緩和曲線の初期値F_ 3 と 1 分後の値F_ 4 にはほとんど差がなく,cが大でηの小なるときにわずかにF_ 4 は減少する程度である. 9. 復元強度V_Rは一般にcの大なるほど大となるが,ηの大小による影響はcの値によって一定せず,明確な傾向は示さない. 以上のことより,わらの最小締付力と束のゆるみ量（復元率）が既製のバインダで明確になれば,最小圧縮率が求められ,不要の圧縮による動力の節減と,過度の圧縮による弾性や復元力の減退を防ぐことができる...|$|R
