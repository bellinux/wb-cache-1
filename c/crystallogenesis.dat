40|$|Gramicidin is an apolar pentadecapeptide {{antibiotic}} {{consisting of}} alternating D-and L-amino acids.

Urolithiasis is widespread disease, could be found in many species, including cats, dogs, rabbits, guinea-pigs, turtles etc. Despite the large scale of this pathology in animal world, there are some challenges with diagnostic process and diagnosis’s verification. The aim of our study is estimation of diagnostic value of advanced urine tesiocrystalloscopy in urolithiasis (by the example of cats). We studied crystallogenic and initiated properties of 24 healthy cats and 32 animals with urolithiasis. Own and initiated <b>crystallogenesis</b> of the urine specimens was studied. For teziographic test we used sodium chloride solution (0. 45 %, 0. 9 %, 3 % consequently), hydrochloric acid solution (0. 1 H) and sodium hydroxide (0. 1 H) as a crystal-forming substances. We used the original criterions to estimate crystalloscopic and tezigraphic facias. As the main parameters structure index (SI), crystallizability (Cr), facia's destruction degree (FDD) and edge belt intensity (EB) were used to describe free <b>crystallogenesis,</b> and main tezigraphic coefficient (Q), belt coefficient (B) and FDD were used for the comparative tezigraphy data. Results showed that Cat’s urine in normal conditions has moderate crystallogenic activity, but in urolithiasis it acquires high level of crystallizing, with intermedium value of structure index, and significant destruction of crystal-forming elements.

40|$|<b>Crystallogenesis</b> is {{a longstanding}} topic that has {{transformed}} into a discipline that is mainly focused on the preparation of crystals for practising crystallographers. Although the idiosyncratic features of proteins {{have to be taken}} into account, the crystallization of proteins is governed by the same physics as the crystallization of inorganic materials. At present, a diversified panel of crystallization methods adapted to proteins has been validated, and although only a few methods are in current practice, the success rate of crystallization has increased constantly, leading to the determination of ∼ 105 X-ray structures. These structures reveal a huge repertoire of protein folds, but they only cover a restricted part of macromolecular diversity across the tree of life. In the future, crystals representative of missing structures or that will better document the structural dynamics and functional steps underlying biological processes need to be grown. For the pertinent choice of biologically relevant targets, computer-guided analysis of structural databases is needed. From another perspective, crystallization is a self-assembly process that can occur in the bulk of crowded fluids, with crystals being supramolecular assemblies. Life also uses self-assembly and supramolecular processes leading to transient, or less often stable, complexes. An integrated view of supramolecularity implies that proteins crystallizing either in vitro or in vivo or participating in cellular processes share common attributes, notably determinants and antideterminants that favour or disfavour their correct or incorrect associations. As a result, under in vivo conditions proteins show a balance between features that favour or disfavour association. If this balance is broken, disorders/diseases occur. Understanding crystallization under in vivo conditions is a challenge for the future. In this quest, the analysis of packing contacts and contacts within oligomers will be crucial in order to decipher the rules governing protein self-assembly and will guide the engineering of novel biomaterials. In a wider perspective, understanding such contacts will open the route towards supramolecular biology and generalized <b>crystallogenesis...</b>|$|E

A 14 carbon monoacylglycerol was chosen as the lipid with which to test the proposal. To be compatible with the in meso method, a cis olefinic bond was placed in its acyl chain at a location arrived at by rational design.

The resulting diffraction provides far more information than classical microscope images.

The research by Prof. Chou is characterized by introducing novel physical concepts as well as powerful and elegant mathematical methods into important biomedical pro blems, a focus throughout his career, even when facing enormous difficulties. His efforts in 50 years have greatly helped us to realize the dream to make “theoretical and experimental biology in one”. Prof. Richard Giege is well known for his multi-disciplinary research combining physics, chemistry, enzymology and molecular biology.

How to set up trials manually and automatically with a robot is introduced with reference to open-access online videos that provide a practical guide to all aspects of the method. These range from protein reconstitution to crystal harvesting from the hosting mesophase, which is noted for its viscosity and stickiness. The sponge phase, as an alternative medium in which to perform crystallization, is described. The compatibility of the method with additive lipids, detergents, precipitant-screen components and materials carried along with the protein such as denaturants and reducing agents is considered. The powerful host and additive lipid-screening strategies are described along with how samples that have low protein concentration and cell-free expressed protein can be used. Assaying the protein reconstituted in the bilayer of the cubic phase for function is an important element of quality control and is detailed. Host lipid design for crystallization at low temperatures and for large proteins and complexes is outlined. Experimental phasing by heavy-atom derivatization, soaking or co-crystallization is routine and the approaches that have been implemented to date are described. An overview and a breakdown by family and function of the close to 200 published structures that have been obtained using in meso -grown crystals are given. Recommendations for conducting the screening process to give a more productive outcome are summarized. The fact that the in meso method also works with soluble proteins should not be overlooked. Recent applications of the method for in situ serial crystallography at X-ray free-electron lasers and synchrotrons are described. The review ends with a view to the future and to the bright prospects for the method, which continues to contribute to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of some of nature?s most valued proteinaceous robots...|$|E
40|$|A fast-rotating titable cuvette {{clinostat}} {{was designed}} and tested {{with respect to the}} idea of possible improvement of crystal quality in functional weightlessness. For the mosaicity of lysozyme crystals, no positive effect was found, while rate of crystal growth was considerably different from the still-standing control, consistent with theory of <b>crystallogenesis.</b> Photochromic bacteriorhodopsin was recrystallized in three modifications (cubic-, needle- and bulk-shaped crystals) and tested for their possible use in photonic information processing. The macroscopic crystal morphology appeared a function of the mixed-micelle radii as monitored by dynamic light scattering. Crystal growth under microgravity conditions (IML- 2, USML- 2, LMS missions) stabilized the weak hydrophilic interactions in crystalline bacteriorhodopsin as well as the consolution boundary in the micelle/buffer/protein system. The cubic crystals of axis up to 200 #mu#m displayed characteristics of liquid crystals, while the bulk-shaped crystals of up to 1. 35 mm in length diffracted up to 3. 8 A resolution. (orig.)
