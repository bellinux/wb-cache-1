40|$|There {{has always}} been an {{increasing}} demand for high density data storage. However, the increased areal storage densities of hard disk drives require a level of miniturisation of the recording heads where the micromagnetic details and switching mechanisms can no longer be ignored. Furthermore, theoretical and numerical studies on thin-film recording heads tend to separate the micromagnetics from the electromagnetic aspects of the head during switching and hence ignore the lossy nature of head materials. This project was aimed to develop a numerical simulation approach that simultaneously incorporates the fundamental micromagnetic and electromagnetic details of magnetic materials to study the fast switching process in soft magnetic materials in general, and in thin-film inductive writers in particular. The project also was aimed at establishing an impedance measurement system to characterise losses in magnetic recording heads, and to allow comparison with the simulations. This project successfully met all its original objectives. A numerical technique to simulate the dynamic behaviour of magnetic materials and devices has been developed, and applied to study the switching process in thin-film recording heads. Two-dimensional simulations of complete commercial head structures including the coils and pole regions were carried out and parameters such as gap field rise times, gap field distributions, and <b>core</b> <b>inductances,</b> which are important for head designers, were predicted. Moreover, the role of eddy currents delaying the magnetisation switching was elucidated. Furthermore, {{it was found that the}} gradient of the recording fields were sharper near the conrner regions of the poles when considering magnetic details. A high precision, high bandwidth impedance measurement system was established to characterise losses in magnetic heads. Fittings of measured <b>core</b> <b>inductances</b> to a proposed equivalent circuit model of the core’s relaxation processes revealed the switching times of heads (of the order 0. 1 to 1. 0 ns).

40|$|Certain {{laboratory}} measurements {{require the}} use of a selective audio frequency amplifier. The limitations of physical size on conventional circuits become important in this frequency range. It is necessary to consider selectivity ease of tuning, economy of components, and stability, in the comparison of various types of amplifiers which operate in the range below 20, 000 cycles per second. At radio frequencies, use of the parallel resonant circuit as a selective load impedance for a vacuum tube is highly satisfactory. (Figure 1) When the frequency of resonance is decreased, the product of the inductance and capacitance must be increased inversely as the square of the frequency. It becomes difficult to produce variable condensers with a large enough capacity to cover the range desired. In order to obtain the required value of <b>inductance,</b> iron <b>cored</b> inductors must be used. These have greater losses than air <b>cored</b> <b>inductances,</b> and require careful design to avoid change of inductance due to variable permeability. It becomes essential at low audio frequencies to employ other circuits.

5000|$|Measured in millihenries (mH), {{this is the}} {{inductance}} of {{the voice}} coil. The coil is a lossy inductor, {{in part due to}} losses in the pole piece, so the apparent inductance changes with frequency. Large Le values limit the high frequency output of the driver and cause response changes near cutoff. Simple modeling software often neglects Le, and so does not include its consequences. Inductance varies with excursion because the voice coil moves relative to the polepiece, which acts as a sliding inductor <b>core,</b> increasing <b>inductance</b> on the inward stroke and decreasing it on the outward stroke in typical overhung coil arrangements. This inductance modulation is an important source of nonlinearity (distortion) in loudspeakers. Including a copper cap on the pole piece, or a copper shorting ring on it, can reduce the increase in impedance seen at higher frequencies in typical drivers, and also reduce the nonlinearity due to inductance modulation.|$|R

5000|$|Nonlinearity: If {{the current}} through a {{ferromagnetic}} core coil is high {{enough that the}} magnetic <b>core</b> saturates, the <b>inductance</b> will not remain constant but will change with the current through the device. This is called nonlinearity and results in distortion of the signal. For example, audio signals can suffer intermodulation distortion in saturated inductors. To prevent this, in linear circuits the current through iron core inductors must be limited below the saturation level. Some laminated cores have a narrow air gap in them for this purpose, and powdered iron cores have a distributed air gap. This allows higher levels of magnetic flux and thus higher currents through the inductor before it saturates.|$|R

40|$|Part 17 : Power ConversionInternational audienceThe {{resonant}} converter {{control is}} usually implemented by electronic circuits that regulate {{the parameters of}} the necessarily produced energy pulses of circulating in the resonant circuit. In the same time the power circuit is characterized by fixed (or uncontrollably varying) parameters. In this article a research is described that shows a long time ago forgotten techniques: the magnetic amplifier that controls the power circuit parameters and as a result, changes the resonant frequency depending on the needs of control. The inductance that is made to vary its value in a controllable, continuous and linear mode would be a perfect (non-dissipative) regulator for the power converter. This can be achieved through a DC magnetization applied as a control command to the magnetic core. By varying this magnetization current and hence the magnetic parameters of the <b>core,</b> the <b>inductance</b> L is possible to be adjusted to a desired value. This operation is similar to the principle of the (long ago) well known “magnetic amplifier” or the “saturable core reactor” as it is often called. The magnetic amplifier usually has an AC source in series with the load and with its primary while in the secondary the DC control signal is applied.

A shellac solution was applied to the insulated powder as a further insulator and binder.

40|$|A {{method and}} a setup are {{presented}} {{that allow the}} investigation of the magneto-inductive phenomenon in the development of position, stress and field sensors, as well as in studying fundamental properties of the used ferromagnetic materials. The phenomenon of resonance in a series RLC circuit is used to study the effect of displacement of the soft ferrite core of the inductor on the peak output voltage across the resistor at resonance. More specifically, the displacement of the <b>core!</b> affects the <b>inductance</b> of the circuit and therefore the resonance frequency and the peak output voltage. Several ferrite samples have been used having undergone treatments such as oxidization, annealing and corrosion. The same RLC circuit has also been used to study the effect of applied tensile stress and magnetic field at various frequencies when the core of the inductor is a 25 cm long ribbon made of an iron alloy. In this case, the resonance frequency is constant and the output voltage across the resistor is recorded as a function of frequency, stress, and magnetic field. In both cases, the results are correlated to the permeability of the core and the way its permeability changes with respect to the applied stress or field, the frequency of excitation, the treatment it has undergone and its magnetic history. Thus, the presented system may also serve as a tool for determination of the electric and magnetic properties of the under test samples...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{density of}} electronics within {{portable electronic devices}} provides the motivation to develop more compact power electronics, such as DC-DC converters. Typically, integrated circuits and each passive component, such as inductors, are discreetly packaged and mounted on printed circuit board (PCB), to implement the converter. Hence for further size reduction there has been growing interest for integration schemes such as Power supply in package (PwrSiP). However, {{the ultimate goal is}} the monolithic integration of the power supply solution, in an integration scheme known as Power Supply on Chip (PwrSoC). The economic effectiveness of the converter will be determined by the device footprint and number of processing steps required to fabricate the inductor. Hence, the motivation behind this thesis is the need for microinductors with large inductance density (inductance per device footprint) while maintaining low losses, which can be integrated with silicon IC. Furthermore, the need for thick layers will result in issues with yield and reliability of the fabricated device. Hence {{there is a need to}} identify, characterise and integrate materials with low residual stress into the microinductor fabrication process. A typical choice of inter-coil dielectric is the photo-definable epoxy SU- 8. However, SU- 8 suffers from intrinsic issues with high residual stress and adhesion. One possible replacement for SU- 8 as a structural and dielectric layer is Parylene-C. The first objective of this thesis proposes a test-bed inductor process, which incorporates Parylene as a structural and dielectric layer and has a short turnaround time of one week. This fabrication process involves the filling of high aspect ratio gaps between copper structures with Parylene and subsequent chemical mechanical planarisation, and a test chip has been designed to characterise these processes. Additionally, Scotch-tape testing has been used to confirm suitable Parylene adhesion to patterned and unpatterned films used in this process. Subsequently, complete microinductors, with magnetic cores, have been fabricated, characterised and benchmarked against other inductor technologies and architectures reported in the literature. Parylene is expected to produce films with low residual stress due to its room temperature deposition process. However, the test-bed inductor process requires thermal treatments up to 140 °C. Hence it was necessary to characterise the stress in Parylene films as a result of processing temperature and compare this to stress levels in SU- 8 5 and 3005 films. This study has determined the spatial variation of residual stress in Parylene-C and SU- 8 films, by combining automated measurements of strain indicator test structures and local nanoindentation measurements of Young’s modulus. These measurements have been used to wafer map strain, Young’s modulus, and subsequently residual stress in these films, as a result of processing parameter variation. It is well known that placing ferromagnetic material in close proximity to current carrying coils can further enhance the measured inductance value. However, the conductive magnetic core is also a source of loss for the microinductor. Hence, magnetic permeability, electrical resistivity and mechanical stress in the magnetic <b>core</b> influence the <b>inductance</b> value, eddy current losses and reliability of the fabricated microinductor, respectively. The ability to characterise these properties on wafer is essential for process control and verification measurements. This thesis details a test chip capable of routine measurements on NiFe films to characterise the spatial variation of these properties. Furthermore, wafer mapping measurements are reported to identify the correlation between high frequency permeability, electrical resistivity, mechanical strain and the chemical composition of two-component Permalloy film (NixFe(100 -x)) electroplated on the surface of 100 mm silicon wafers. Finally, MEMS-based inductor fabrication processes typically require a number of electrodeposition steps, which require conductive seed layers for the deposition of the coils and magnetic core material. A typical choice of seed layer is copper. However, due to copper’s paramagnetic behaviour (μ = 1) and low electrical resistivity (ρ= 6. 69 μΩ. cm) this layer contributes to eddy current losses, while acting as a thin ‘screening layer’. It is very likely that using a magnetic seed layer, within the magnetic core, will noticeably reduce eddy current related losses. However, detailed systematic experimental studies on any such improvement have not been documented in the literature. This study involves compositional, structural, electrical and magnetic characterisation of Ni 80 Fe 20 films electro-deposited on non-magnetic and magnetic seed layers (i. e. copper and nickel respectively). Mechanical strain test structures and X-ray analysis have been used to characterise the stress levels and structural properties of Ni 80 Fe 20 films electro-deposited on both copper and nickel seed layers. In addition, planar spiral micro-inductors, both with and without patterned magnetic cores, have been fabricated to determine the effect of patterning on their performance. This is in addition to quantifying the improvement in the electrical performance resulting from the enhanced magnetic and resistive contribution provided by magnetic seed layers...|$|R
