50|$|<b>Cyprenorphine</b> has mixed agonist-antagonist effects at opioid receptors, {{like those}} of buprenorphine. However the effects of <b>cyprenorphine</b> are {{somewhat}} different, as it produces pronounced dysphoric and hallucinogenic effects which limit its potential use as an analgesic.|$|E

[...] Pretreatment wi h opioid antagonists enhances acquisition of Pavlovian fear conditioning. The present experiments attempted {{to characterize the}} type of opioid receptor esponsible for this effect using a procedure that assessed the fear of rats to a chamber previously associated with electric shock (1 mA, 0. 75 s). Freezing, a species-typical immo-bility, was employed as an index of fear. Two Ix opioid antagonists, CTOP (40 ng) and naloxonazine (10 p. g), enhanced condi-tioning. On the other hand, the K antagonist nor-binaltorphimine reduced conditioning. Two ~ antagonist treatments (16 -methyl <b>cyprenorphine</b> and naltrindole) had no reliable effect on acquisition. Thus the enhancement of conditioning appears to be mediated by i ~ receptors. Previous research as shown that the conditional fear produced by these procedures caused an analgesia that is also mediated by I ~ receptors. It is argued that the enhancement effect occurs because of an antagonism of this analgesia nd that the analgesia normally acts to regulate the level of fear conditioning.
