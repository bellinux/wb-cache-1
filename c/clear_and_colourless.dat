25|$|Ever since glass {{containers}} have existed, specialised glasses {{for each}} type of wine were created. So many glasses, specific to white wine, exist in many wine producing regions. The glass must be perfectly <b>clear</b> <b>and</b> <b>colourless</b> to properly appreciate the colour of the wine. However, designers and manufacturers of tableware have created white wine glasses with green or blue feet. These colours flatter the wine – they give an artificial colour in the shade (a reflection barrier which emphasizes the separation between the glass and the wine) – rejuvenating the perceived impression.|$|E

50|$|The {{water of}} the lake is very <b>clear</b> <b>and</b> {{virtually}} <b>colourless,</b> which reflects the nutrient-poor flat rock pine forest of the surrounding area. Most of nutrient contribution to the lake comes from settlements south of the lake, also responsible for about 80 per cent of the phosphorus input. A hydrogeological examination in 1985 showed the surrounding soil is poorly fit to take up increased levels of waste water. Acidification has been neutralized by liming which has produced excellent pH-levels.|$|R

60|$|Her thin {{face had}} become thinner, {{and was very}} pale; her head had been shaved close, {{and there was nothing}} between the broad white border of her nightcap and her clammy brow and wan cheek. But illness was more {{becoming}} to Anty than health; it gave her a melancholy and beautiful expression of resignation, which, under ordinary circumstances, was wanting to her features, though not to her character. Her eyes were brighter than they usually were, and her complexion was <b>clear,</b> <b>colourless,</b> <b>and</b> transparent. I do not mean to say that Anty in her illness was beautiful, but she was no longer plain; and even to the young Kellys, whose feelings and sympathies cannot be supposed to have been of the highest order, she became an object of the most intense interest, and the warmest affection.|$|R
6000|$|The next {{important}} {{visit to}} the Congo River was paid by Captain Owen's Expedition, when homeward bound in 1826. The [...] "Leven" [...] and [...] "Barracouta" [...] surveyed the stream twenty-five miles from its mouth during a week, beginning with January 1, just after the highest flood. At thirteen miles out at sea the water was fresh and of a dingy red; it fermented and remained in a highly putrescent state for some days, tarnishing silver; kept for four months, it became perfectly <b>clear</b> <b>and</b> <b>colourless,</b> without depositing any sediment. This {{reminds us of the}} changing colours, green, red and milky white, to which the Nile and all great African rivers that flood periodically are subject.[FN#15] ...|$|E
60|$|Away to the north-eastward, in a {{cloudless}} pool {{of gathering}} light {{and with all}} its nocturnal illuminations still blazing, was Berlin. The left finger of the steersman verified roads and open spaces below upon the mica-covered square of map that was fastened by his wheel. There {{in a series of}} lake-like expansions was the Havel away to the right; over by those forests must be Spandau; there the river split about the Potsdam island; and right ahead was Charlottenburg cleft by a great thoroughfare that fell like an indicating beam of light straight to the imperial headquarters. There, plain enough, was the Thiergarten; beyond rose the imperial palace, and to the right those tall buildings, those clustering, beflagged, bemasted roofs, must be the offices in which the Central European staff was housed.

60|$|It {{has been}} {{observed}} by others, that transparent Substances, as Glass, Water, Air, &c. when made very thin by being blown into Bubbles, or otherwise formed into Plates, do exhibit various Colours according to their various thinness, altho' at a greater thickness they appear very <b>clear</b> <b>and</b> <b>colourless.</b> In the former Book I forbore to treat of these Colours, because they seemed of a more difficult Consideration, and were not necessary for establishing the Properties of Light there discoursed of. But because they may conduce to farther Discoveries for compleating the Theory of Light, especially as to {{the constitution of the}} parts of natural Bodies, on which their Colours or Transparency depend; I have here set down an account of them. To render this Discourse short and distinct, I have first described the principal of my Observations, and then consider'd and made use of them. The Observations are these.|$|E

6000|$|The {{riverine}} trough acts as wind-conductor to {{a strong}} and even violent sea-breeze; on the lower section it begins as a ground- current--if the [...] "bull" [...] be allowed--a thin horizontal stratum near the water, it gradually curves and slides upwards as it meets the mountain flanks, forming an inverted arch, and extending some 2,000 to 3,000 feet above the summits. At this season it is a late riser, often appearing about 3 P.M., and sometimes its strength is not exhausted before midnight. The brown water, grass-sheeted at the sides, conceals the bright yellow sand of the bed; when placed in a tumbler it looks <b>clear</b> <b>and</b> <b>colourless,</b> and the taste is perfectly sweet--brackishness does not extend far above Porto da Lenha. Yet at Boma the residents prefer a spring near the factories, and attribute dysentery {{to the use of}} river-water.

The sea anemone with which this shrimp usually associates, Stichodactyla helianthus, is generally green or olive, and the associated shrimp may have a slight greenish tinge; it may appear rather more intense green because of light transmitted through its body.|$|E
5000|$|Lucas' reagent is a {{solution}} of anhydrous zinc chloride in concentrated hydrochloric acid. This solution is used to classify alcohols of low molecular weight. The reaction is a substitution in which the chloride replaces a hydroxyl group. A positive test is indicated by a change from <b>clear</b> <b>and</b> <b>colourless</b> to turbid, signalling formation of a chloroalkane. [...] Also, the best results for this test are observed in tertiary alcohols, as they form the respective alkyl halides fastest due to higher stability of the intermediate tertiary carbocation. The test was reported in 1930 and became a standard method in qualitative organic chemistry. The test has since become somewhat obsolete with the availability of various spectroscopic and chromatographic methods of analysis. It was named after Howard Lucas (1885-1963), an American chemist.|$|E

5000|$|Galicia, {{the northwestern}} region of Spain, is {{renowned for its}} quality and variety of aguardientes. Probably the most famous type is [...] "Augardente de bagazo" [...] (Aguardiente de Orujo), which is {{obtained}} from the distillation of the pomace of grapes, and is <b>clear</b> <b>and</b> <b>colourless.</b> It typically contains over 50% alcohol, sometimes significantly more, and is still made traditionally in many villages across Galicia today. Augardente de herbas, usually yellow in colour, is a sweet liqueur made with Augardente de bagazo and herbs (herbas), with chamomile being a substantial ingredient. Licor café (typical distilled drink {{in the province of}} Ourense), black in colour, is a sweet liqueur made with augardente de bagazo, coffee (café) and sugar. Crema de Augardente" [...] or [...] "Crema de Caña is a cream liqueur based on augardente, coffee, cream, milk and other ingredients. It is similar to Irish cream liqueur. In some places in Galicia, a small glass is traditionally taken at breakfast time as a tonic before a hard day's work on the land. The word orujo is actually Spanish and not Galician, but is used to distinguish Galician and some Spanish augardentes from those of other countries.|$|E
5000|$|I {{might add}} more {{instances}} of this nature, but I shall conclude with this general one, that the colours of all natural bodies {{have no other}} origin than this, that they are variously qualified to reflect one sort of light in greater plenty than another. And this I have experimented {{in a dark room}} by illuminating those bodies with uncompounded light of diverse colours. For by that means any body may be made to appear of any colour. They have there no appropriate colour, but ever appear of the colour of the light cast upon them, but yet with this difference, that they are most brisk and vivid in the light of their own daylight colour. Minium appears there of any colour indifferently, with which 'tis illustrated, but yet most luminous in red, and so Bise appears indifferently of any colour with which 'tis illustrated, but yet most luminous in blue. [...] And there place a <b>clear</b> <b>and</b> <b>colourless</b> prism, to refract the entering light towards the further part of the room, which, as I said, will thereby be diffused into an oblong coloured image. Then place a lens of about three foot radius (suppose a broad object-glass of a three foot telescope), at the distance of about four or five foot from thence, through which all those colours may at once be transmitted, and made by its refraction to convene at a further distance of about ten or twelve feet. If at that distance you intercept this light with a sheet of white paper, you will see the colours converted into whiteness again by being mingled.|$|E
30|$|Further {{examination}} of six acrylic IR spectra revealed two sub-groups: acrylic (4) and acrylic + CN (2). A small peak (~ 1656  cm− 1) was identified {{in addition to}} the strong characteristic acrylic carbonyl peak at ~ 1740  cm− 1. As with the PVAc samples, the peak at ~ 1656  cm− 1 is most likely due to the NO 2 symmetric stretch of CN [35] or alternatively the amide stretch of a protein based adhesive. Visually adhesive samples were <b>clear</b> <b>and</b> <b>colourless.</b> Of five samples spot tested, samples identified to contain acrylic + CN tested positive for CN. The four acrylic samples tested negative for CN. All samples tested negative for protein. PCA analysis was not conducted on acrylic samples due to the small quantity of samples and IR spectra available. Based on these findings from the ME collection it was determined to be worthwhile to re-analyse the PVAc and acrylic spectra obtained from the Cypriot pottery collection.|$|E
