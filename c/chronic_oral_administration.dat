50|$|The HPA axis is {{a feature}} of mammals and other vertebrates. For example, {{biologists}} studying stress in fish showed that social subordination leads to chronic stress, related to reduced aggressive interactions, to lack of control, and to the constant threat imposed by dominant fish. Serotonin (5HT) {{appeared to be the}} active neurotransmitter involved in mediating stress responses, and increases in serotonin are related to increased plasma Î±-MSH levels, which causes skin darkening (a social signal in salmonoid fish), activation of the HPA axis, and inhibition of aggression. Inclusion of the amino acid L-tryptophan, a precursor of 5HT, in the feed of rainbow trout made the trout less aggressive and less responsive to stress. However, the study mentions that plasma cortisol was not affected by dietary L-tryptophan.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{the effects of}} the acute and <b>chronic</b> <b>oral</b> <b>administrations</b> (po) of {{curcumin}} in the absence and presence of morphine and naloxone was investigated on the sensation of acute corneal pain in rats. Acute corneal pain was induced by the local application of hypertonic saline (5 M NaCl) on the corneal surface, and the number of eye wipes was then counted for 30 s. Subcutaneous (sc) injections of morphine (1, 2 and 4 mg/kg) significantly suppressed corneal pain (p< 0. 05). Naloxone (2 mg/kg, sc) did not change the intensity of pain when used alone, but pretreatment of the rates with naloxone (2 mg/kg, sc) significantly prevented the antinociceptive effect induced by morphine (2 mg/kg, sc; p< 0. 05). The short-term and long-term <b>oral</b> <b>administration</b> of curcumin (either a single dose of 200 mg/kg or dosages of 6. 25, 12. 5 of 25 mg/kg for 15 days each, respectively) both significantly decreased the number of eye wipes (p< 0. 05). The antinociceptive effect induced by morphine was significantly (p< 0. 05) enhanced by both the acute (200 mg/kg, once, po) and chronic (25 mg/kg, 15 days, po) curcumin treatments. Naloxone (2 mg/kg, sc) did not change the antinociception that was induced by acute (200 mg/kg, once, po) and chronic (25 mg/kg, 15 days, po) treatments of curcumin. The present findings suggest that morphine produced an analgesic effect through a naloxone-sensitive mechanism in acute corneal pain.

5000|$|Since metabotropic {{glutamate}} receptors {{are involved}} in a variety of functions, abnormalities in their expression can contribute to disease. For example, studies with mutant mice have suggested that mutations in expression of mGluR1 may be involved in the development of certain types of cancer. In addition, manipulating mGluRs can be useful in treating some conditions. For example, clinical trial suggested that an mGlu2/3 agonist, LY354740, was effective in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder. [...] Also, some researchers have suggested that activation of mGluR4 {{could be used as a}} treatment for Parkinson's disease.Most recently, Group I mGluRs, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Fragile X, a type of autism, and a number of studies are currently testing the therapeutic potential of drugs that modify these receptors. There is also growing evidence that group II metabotropic glutamate receptor agonists may play a role in the treatment of schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is associated with deficits in cortical inhibitory interneurons that release GABA and synaptic abnormalities associated with deficits in NMDA receptor function. These inhibitory deficits may impair cortical function via cortical disinhibition and asynchrony. [...] The drug LY354740 (also known as Eglumegad, an mGlu2/3 agonist) was shown to attenuate physiologic and cognitive abnormalities in animal and human studies of NMDA receptor antagonist and serotonergic hallucinogen effects, supporting the subsequent clinical evidence of efficacy for an mGluR2/3 agonist in the treatment of schizophrenia.The same drug has been shown to interfere in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, with <b>chronic</b> <b>oral</b> <b>administration</b> of this drug leading to markedly reduced baseline cortisol levels in bonnet macaques (Macaca radiata); acute infusion of LY354740 resulted in a marked diminution of yohimbine-induced stress response in those animals.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Evaluation of safety, feasibility, and {{efficacy}} of oral administered glycine in prevention of angiographic restenosis six months after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). BACKGROUND: The amino acid glycine modulates immunological response and enhances the production of endothelial derived nitric oxide (EDNO) factor. This factor {{has been shown to}} possess anti-atherosclerotic properties, actions of which are thought to reduce neo-intimal hyperplasia. Furthermore, glycine significantly elevates arginine serum levels. This amino acid has been extensively studied for its effects on the endothelium, nitric oxide (NO) metabolism and effects on several biochemical pathways interfering with the process of restenosis after PCI. METHODS: A prospective double blind placebo controlled randomized study evaluated safety and feasibility of <b>chronic</b> <b>oral</b> <b>administration</b> of glycine. In addition, the efficacy was determined by evaluation of six months angiographic restenosis rates. RESULTS: 214 patients scheduled for elective PCI were randomized to receive glycine or placebo.

40|$|A key to {{advancing}} {{the understanding of}} obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) -like symptoms {{is the development of}} spontaneous animal models. Over 55 generations of bidirectional selection for nest-building behavior in house mice, Mus musculus, resulted in a 40 -fold difference in the amount of cotton used for a nest in high (BIG) and low (SMALL) selected lines. The nesting behavior of BIG mice appears to be compulsive-like and has initial face validity as an animal model for OCD in humans. Compulsive-like digging behavior was assessed: BIG male mice buried about three times as many marbles as SMALL male mice, strengthening face validity. Using the open field and elevated plus maze, SMALL male mice showed higher levels of anxiety/fear-like behavior than BIG male mice, indicating that compulsive-like and not anxiety-like behavior was measured. To establish predictive validity, <b>chronic</b> (4 weeks) <b>oral</b> <b>administration</b> of fluoxetine (30, 50 and 100 mg/kg/day) and clomipramine (80 mg/kg/day), both effective in treating OCD, significantly reduced compulsive-like nest-building behavior in BIG male mice.

In the present study, the effect of <b>chronic</b> <b>oral</b> <b>administration</b> of raw garlic homogenate on oxidative stress induced by ischemic-reperfusion injury in isolated rat heart was investigated. Results Raw garlic homogenate (125, 250 and 500 mg/kg once daily for 30 days) was administered orally in Wistar albino rats. Thereafter, hearts were isolated and subjected to IRI (9 min. of global ischemia, followed by 12 min of reperfusion; perfusion with K-H buffer solution; 37 Â°C, 60 mm Hg.). Significant myocyte injury and rise in myocardial TBARS along with reduction in myocardial SOD, catalase, GSH and GPx were observed following IRI. Depletion of myocardial endogenous antioxidants and rise in TBARS were significantly less in the garlic-treated rat hearts. Oxidative stress induced cellular damage as indicated by ultrastructural changes, like disruption of myofilament, Z-band architecture along with mitochondrial changes were significantly less.

After anesthesia, the ratsâ hearts were isolated quickly, mounted on a Langendorff apparatus and perfused with a modified Krebs-Henseleit solution during stabilization, 30 min regional ischemia followed by 30 min reperfusion. The ECGs were recorded throughout the experiments to analyze cardiac arrhythmias based on the Lambeth conventions. ResultsIn the ischemic phase, honey (1 %) significantly reduced (P< 0. 05) the number and duration of ventricular tachycardia (VT). Honey (1 % and 2 %) also significantly decreased number of ventricular ectopic beats (VEBs). In addition, incidence and duration of reversible ventricular fibrillation (Rev VF) were lowered by honey 2 % (P< 0. 05).

Intraperitoneal injections of Montelukast resulted in concentrations up to 110 mu mol/L in serum and 400 mu mol/L in the liver. Still, serum UCB levels remained unaltered. This first study on biliverdin reductase inhibition as a novel concept for treatment of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia identified putative in vitro BVRA inhibitors. Montelukast, the clinically most suitable inhibitor, did not result in reduction of serum UCB in the Ugt 1 a 1 -deficient rat. The proposed treatment strategy will not result in amelioration of severe unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in humans without the identification or development of more potent BVRA inhibitor...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{present study}} was aimed to {{study the effects of}} {{hyperlipidaemia}} on the histology of various reproductive organs. The <b>chronic</b> <b>oral</b> <b>administration</b> of cholesterol diet (400 mg/kg bodyweight/day for 60 day) induced hyperlipidaemia in male rabbits. It showed severe degeneration in germinal epithelium. Few spermatocytes could be seen, but the number was decreased. The seminiferous tubules were wavy and shrunken. As the tubule had large number of primary spermatocytes, it seems that the meiotic divisions were inhibited. Leydig cells nuclei were shrunken and the distribution of Leydig cells was abnormal. The histoarchitecture of cauda epididymis showed lesser number of spermatozoa in lumen and shrinkage was observed in epithelial cell line.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{elucidate}} {{the mode of}} action of beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists in essential tremor, the efficacy of <b>chronic</b> <b>oral</b> <b>administration</b> of metoprolol, atenolol and sotalol was compared in a randomised, double-blind placebo controlled trial in twenty-four patients. Only sotalol proved superior to placebo on both subjective and "objective" assessments. Metoprolol and sotalol produced comparable degrees of beta-adrenoreceptor antagonism as judged by the blockade of standing tachycardia. Atenolol, in the dose used, produced a trend towards a greater cardiac chronotropic effect. These findings provide no support for the concept that central or peripheral beta 1 -adrenoreceptor mechanisms are important in essential tremor. The beneficial effect of beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists may be mediated predominantly through peripheral beta 2 -adrenoreceptor mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|Mononitrosocaffeidine (MNC) and dinitrosocaffeidine (DNC) are new N-nitroso {{compounds}} {{obtained from}} in vitro nitrosation of caffeidine, a hydrolysis product of caffeine {{present in a}} typically made and widely consumed tea from Kashmir (India), a high incidence area of esophageal and stomach cancer. The chemical synthesis, in vitro metabolic studies and mutagenicity of the compounds has been previously reported. DNC, a nitrosamide is highly muta-genic both with and without metabolic activation whereas MNC, like several other aromatic asymmetric nitrosamines, does not exhibit genotoxic or mutagenic properties. We now report {{the results of the}} first carcinogenicity experiments on <b>chronic</b> <b>oral</b> <b>administration</b> of these compounds in BD-IX rats. The acute LD 50 of MNC and DNC were about 1300 and 230 mg/kg b. w., respectively. Lung oedema an...|$|E
40|$|The {{accumulation}} of verapamil during regular dosing conditions was studied. Plasma concentrations of verapamil (V) and norverapamil (NV) were measured as were urinary concentrations of verapamil, norverapamil, {{and four other}} N- and O-dealkylated metabolites in nine patients after an initial single dose and after <b>chronic</b> <b>oral</b> verapamil <b>administration</b> to steady-state plasma concentrations. Indocyanine green (ICG) clearance was determined immediately prior to the initial verapamil dose and prior to the verapamil washout from regular dosing. An approximately two-fold {{accumulation of}} V had occurred during regular dosing. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC 1) after the first dose was 417. 4 +/- 276. 7 ng ml- 1 h (mean +/- s. d.) and increased to 786. 5 +/- 54 ng ml- 1 h (P less than 0. 01) during one dosage interval at steady-state (AUCss). NV also tended to accumulate from an AUC 1 of 552. 6 +/- 411 to an AUCss 668. 7 +/- 332 ng ml- 1 h (P less than 0. 09). The ratio of AUC-V to AUC-NV was unchanged. The verapamil elimination half-life (t 1 / 2) increased from 8. 4 +/- 4. 2 to 12. 0 +/- 3. 6 h (P less than 0. 01) whereas the norverapamil t 1 / 2 was unchanged. ICG clearance was unchanged. Urinary excretion of NV increased slightly but the ratio of urinary V/NV concentrations was not significantly altered nor was the ratio of four other metabolites to verapamil or {{the ratio of the}} combined o-demethylated to the N-dealkylated metabolites.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} the efÂ®cacy {{and safety of}} phenytoin (PHT) {{in the treatment of}} situation-related seizures and epilepsies in the newborn and infant; the clinical histories of 82 patients were retrospectively reviewed. Sixty patients received for status epilepticus (SE), intravenous PHT followed by long-term <b>oral</b> <b>administration</b> for 27 of them. The other 22 patients had oral treatment only. Intravenous administration made 55 % of these patients seizure-free, whereas <b>oral</b> <b>administration</b> produced lasting seizure control in only 9. 1 %. During <b>chronic</b> <b>oral</b> treatment, it was most difÂ®cult to obtain adequate plasma concentrations in 69. 1 % of the patients, and 43. 6 % had side effects, most of which were related to very high plasma concentrations. In conclusion, in the Â®rst 2 years of life, intravenous administration of PHT is useful for SE, but oral treatment is poorly effective with difÂ®culty to achieve appropriate and stable therapeutic plasma concentrations, and with frequent sid...|$|R
40|$|We studied {{an acute}} and <b>chronic</b> <b>oral</b> {{toxicity}} of the extract from Ziziphus attopensis (ZA) in {{male and female}} SD rats according to the OECD guidelines. After a single <b>oral</b> <b>administration</b> of ZA 5 [*]g/kg body weight, measurement {{of the body and}} organs, necropsy, and health monitoring were performed. The body and organ weights and behavior were not changed relative to the control rats indicating that ZA does not produce acute toxicity. The chronic toxicity was determined by oral feeding both male and female rats daily with ZA at the doses of 1, 2, 4, and 8 [*]g/kg body weight for 180 days. Body weight changes, hematological and biochemical parameters, organ weights, gross finding, and histopathology examination were monitored during the experimental period. The results did not show any differences from the control groups. Analyses of these results with the information of signs, behavior, and health monitoring can lead to a conclusion that the long-term <b>oral</b> <b>administration</b> of ZA for 180 days does not cause chronic toxicity...|$|R
