Since PZT fibres form active elements within a functional device, fibre characterisation and optimisation is essential.

Fibres have been characterised in terms of morphology (shape factor and diameter variability), microstructure (grain size and porosity), and phase composition (XRD). <b>Certain</b> <b>fibres</b> were found to exhibit properties unsuitable for AFC applications, which suggests that commercial production of fine scale PZT fibres may not yet be fully optimised...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the influence of long fibre concentration on loadability and pulp properties during LC refining of mechanical pulp. Long fibre concentration was adjusted to three different levels by screen fractionation of the pulp. The three pulps were refined in a single disc pilot scale LC refiner at similar process conditions. Increased long fibre concentration supported a larger refiner gap and resulted in less fibre cutting at a given specific energy consumption. The higher long fibre concentration probably contributed to a stronger fibre network that maintained a larger refining gap at certain specific energy consumption. Increased long fibre concentration also enabled a higher tensile index increase in the LC refiner at <b>certain</b> <b>fibre</b> length reduction. The study supports a process combining LC refining with screen fractionation, where the long fibre fraction is recycled to the refiner feed. This enables a higher loadability and a more effective utilisation of the LC refiner. By using this technology, overall specific energy consumption can be reduced if a larger share of the refining is performed in LC rather than HC refining...|$|R

40|$|The {{geometric}} Satake correspondence {{gives an}} equivalence of categories between the representations of a semisimple group G and the spherical perverse sheaves on the affine Grassmannian Gr of its Langlands dual group. Bezrukavnikov-Finkelberg developed a derived {{version of this}} equivalence which relates the derived category of G^∨-equivariant constructible sheaves on Gr with the category of G-equivariant O(g) -modules. In this paper, we develop a K-theoretic version of the derived geometric Satake which involves the quantum group U_q g. We define a convolution category KConv(Gr) whose morphism spaces are given by the G^∨× C^× -equivariant algebraic K-theory of <b>certain</b> <b>fibre</b> products. We conjecture that KConv(Gr) is equivalent to a full subcategory of the category of U_q g -equivariant O_q(G) -modules. We prove this conjecture when G = SL_n. A key tool in our proof is the SL_n spider, which is a combinatorial description of the category of U_q sl_n representations. By applying horizontal trace, we show that the annular SL_n spider describes the category of U_q sl_n -equivariant O_q(SL_n) -modules. Then we use quantum loop algebras to relate the annular SL_n spider to KConv(Gr). This gives a combinatorial/diagrammatic description of both categories and proves our conjecture.

Understanding the role of muscle groups during movement and comparing them between insect groups could yield insights into evolutionary patterns and functional constraints. Here, we developed a mathematical inverse dynamic model including distinct muscles for an insect head–mandible–muscle complex based on micro-computed tomography (µCT) data and bite force measurements. With the advent of µCT, it is now possible to obtain precise spatial information about muscle attachment areas and head capsule construction in insects. Our model shows a distinct activation pattern for <b>certain</b> <b>fibre</b> groups potentially related to a geometry-dependent optimization. Muscle activation patterns suggest that intramandibular muscles play a minor role in bite force generation, which is a potential reason for their loss in several lineages of higher insects. Our model is in agreement with previous studies investigating fast and slow muscle fibres and is able to resolve the spatio-temporal activation patterns of these different muscle types in insects. The model used here has a high potential for large-scale comparative analyses on the role of different muscle setups and head capsule designs in the megadiverse insects in order to aid our understanding of insect head capsule and mouthpart evolution under mechanical constraints...|$|R

This amino acid is probably {{being used as a}} signalling substance in a majority of synapses, alone or along with peptides or other neuroactive compounds which colocalize with Glutamate. Notably, the high concentration and relatively even distribution of Glutamate among brain regions was difficult to reconcile with a transmitter role. The excitatory effect of Glutamate was recognized almost fifty years ago but {{it took a long time}} until Glutamate was generally accepted as a neurotransmitter. Notably, the high concentration and relatively even distribution of Glutamate among brain regions was difficult to reconcile with a transmitter role. By the mid 1980 ies, Glutamate largely fulfilled the four main criteria for classification as a neurotransmitter: presynaptic localization, release by physiological stimuli, identical action with naturally occurring transmitter, and mechanism for rapid termination of transmitter action. Glutamate is certainly a prevalent transmitter. But this must not be equated with uniformity at the level of synaptic transmission. As the present review has been focused on Glutamate we have not elaborated on the issue of transmitter colocalization. The fact is that many of the fiber systems that contain Glutamate also contain other neuroactive compounds. These may be colocalized with Glutamate or occur in separate fibers.

We then set up a model of polarized spinoptics, namely an extension of geometrical optics accounting for elliptically polarized light rays in terms of a <b>certain</b> <b>fibre</b> bundle associated with the bundle of Euclidean frames of a given Riemannian three-manifold. The characteristic foliation of a natural presymplectic two-form introduced on this bundle via the Ansatz of minimal coupling is determined, yielding a set of differential equations governing the trajectory of light, as well as the evolution of polarization in this Riemannian manifold. Those equations, when specialized to the Fermat metric (for a slowly varying refractive index), enable us to recover, and justify, a set of differential equations earlier proposed in the literature, in another context, namely in terms of a semi-classical limit of wave optics. They feature a specific anomalous velocity responsible for the recently observed Spin Hall Effect of Light, namely a tiny spatial deflection of polarized light rays, transversally to the gradient of the refractive index. Our model, constructed from the start on purely geometric grounds, turns out to encode automatically the Berry as well as the Pancharatnam connections that usually appear in the framework of wave optics.

Optimizing the fabrication process, especially the compounding process, is effective to achieve the optimal properties of the composites. In this research a natural fibre, noil hemp fibre, was applied to reinforce polypropylene with internal mixing process. The influence of compounding parameters, such as mixing temperature, mixing time and rotor speed, on the mechanical properties (tensile strength, flexural strength and impact strength) of the noil hemp fibre/polypropylene composites was investigated using orthogonal method and the evidence of thermogravimetric analysis test of fibre and the observation of fibre dispersion in resin. The range analysis and variance of analysis demonstrated that the mixing temperature has significant effect on the three mechanical properties, mixing time has minor influence on the tensile and flexural strengths, and rotor speed mainly affects the impact strength.
