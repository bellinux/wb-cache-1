40|$|Anuran {{membrane}} {{studies suggest}} that the calcium-binding protein calmodulin is necessary for arginine vasopressin (AVP) to exert a hydro-osmotic effect. We therefore examined the effect of trifluoperazine and N-(6 -aminohexyl) - 5 -chloro- 1 -naphtholene sulphonamide (W- 7), chemically dissimilar calmodulin inhibitors, on hydraulic conductivity (Lp) response to AVP in rabbit cortical collecting tubules perfused in vitro. Trifluoperazine but not W- 7 increased basal Lp in rabbit cortical collecting tubules. When cortical collecting tubules were pre-treated with either trifluoperazine or W- 7, the effect of AVP to increase Lp was significantly inhibited. To determine the site of this inhibition, Lp responses to exogenous cyclic adenosine 3 ', 5 '-phosphate (AMP) were studied. Both trifluoperazine and W- 7 pretreatment significantly inhibited the effect of a cyclic AMP analogue to increase rabbit cortical collecting tubule Lp. These results suggest that calmodulin may be an important mediator of the hydro-osmotic response to AVP in the mammalian cortical <b>collecting</b> <b>tube</b> by acting at a site or sites distal to cyclic AMP formation...|$|E

We have asked {{whether or not there}} is a circadian rhythm of cortisol and 17 -OHP saliva levels in neonates. Furthermore, we have asked whether salivary hormone levels correlated with auxologic and clinical data and time of sampling. Cortisol and 17 -OHP levels in saliva samples from 119 healthy neonates (55 girls, 64 boys) were measured using in-house time-resolved fluorescent immunoassays. Saliva samples were obtained using a saliva <b>collecting</b> <b>tube</b> three times a day on the first or second day of life. Gender and gestational age did not influence salivary cortisol and 17 -OHP levels. No significant circadian rhythm of salivary hormone levels was detected in this group of newborns.

In conclusion, {{measurement of}} cortisol and 17 -OHP in saliva is feasible in healthy neonates.

In spite of such superior performance, utilization of GSHP has not been extended in Japan, while that has been remarkably increased in Europe and USA. A design tool which is easy to use for builders is required in Japan. Energy balances in an actual renewable energy house, equipped with a GSHP air conditioning system were observed by real-time continuous monitoring systems from 2005 to 2013 and analyzed in Kitami City, Hokkaido, subarctic region, Japan. Real-time continuous monitoring of soil temperature distributions were also carried out from July in 2007.

40|$|Electronic {{pressure}} testing of every LeVeen valve has practically eliminated mechanical malfunction {{as a cause}} of shunt failure. Nonetheless, failures do occur and in a series of 240 cases, early or late shunt failure occurred in 29 patients. Thirty-five additional cases of failures were either referred by other physicians over a period of 6 years or information and x-rays were accumulated by direct contact. Shunt failure becomes manifest by a sudden reaccumulation of ascites in patients with a previously functioning shunt. In immediate failure, the ascites may fail to disappear after surgery or reaccumulate if removed. Ideally, caval clotting should be first excluded by x-ray visualization of the superior vena prior to injection of the shunt with contrast agent. Shuntograms are done with fine-bore needles. The venous pressure is also measured. The entry of contrast into the vena cava without pooling indicates a patent venous limb. The contrast will empty from the venous tubing with forceful inspiration if the entire system is patent. The venous tube will not clear if the valve or peritoneal collecting tubes are blocked. Only the valve and <b>collecting</b> <b>tube</b> need then be replaced if contrast enters the cava but does not leave the venous tubing. Occluded valves must not be flushed to restore patency since inflammatory exudate and cellular debris are erroneously identified as "fibrin flecks. " Histology and culture are mandatory. Immediate and early failure are often caused by malposition of the venous tubing. Malplacements can often be diagnosed simply by chest x-rays. Intraoperative injection of methylene blue into the venous tubing establishes a satisfactory washout prior to wound closure. Fresh clots in the vena cava can be dissolved by the slow injection of streptokinase into the venous tubing. Other patent veins are chosen for access. Patients having repeat surgery after clotting must be heparinized to prevent a similar recurrence. Flushing blood clots from the cava can be fatal...|$|E
40|$|Magister Chirurgiae Dentium (MChD) Wound {{healing is}} a complex process characterised by the repair and {{reconstitution}} of lost or damaged tissue. By the mid 1990 s, several methods were proposed to enhance wound healing of surgical sites by introducing high concentrations of human platelets to these areas. In the early 21 st century, Choukroun et al (2006 b) introduced {{a new type of}} platelet concentrate that was devoid of any additives, and required no specialised equipment for its production. This concentrate was termed Platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) and although various aspects of this biomaterial had been studied, very little is currently known about its storage properties. Aim: To determine whether storage time had a significant effect on the platelet concentration of Choukroun’s PRF Method: A total of 30 patients were enrolled into the study. Three blood samples of 10 ml each were drawn from each patient. Two of the blood samples (Group A and Group B) were centrifuged to form PRF. The third sample was used to measure the baseline blood platelet concentration and was therefore not centrifuged. After PRF had formed in both test groups, it was removed from the test tubes at 2 different times i. e. immediately after centrifuge (Group A) or after 60 min of storage in the blood <b>collecting</b> <b>tube</b> (Group B). The remaining blood was then tested for platelet concentration and compared to each other and the baseline reading. Results: 14 males and 16 females participated in the study (average age 41. 7 years). A mean blood platelet concentration of 282. 8 ± 58. 3 × 109 /L was recorded for the baseline reading. Group A had a mean blood platelet concentration 7. 9 ± 3. 03 × 109 /L. Group B had a mean blood platelet concentration of 4. 0 ± 1. 93 × 109 /L. A statistically significant difference was seen between Groups A and B (p < 0. 0001). Conclusions: Storage time has a significant effect of the platelet concentration of PRF. If stored over a period of 60 min, the platelet concentration of PRF increases. Further research is required to determine whether this finding is clinically significant...|$|E
