5|$|The music {{industry}} {{was in a}} period of transition at the time the song was published as new technologies allowed music to be recorded. U.S. <b>copyright</b> <b>laws</b> at the time did not allow music composers to control the distribution of phonograph cylinders or music rolls for player pianos. Edison Records paid popular singers like Harry Macdonough to sing the songs and then sold the recordings without paying any royalties to the composer or publisher of the music. Dresser joined with other prominent composers to seek a change in U.S. <b>copyright</b> <b>laws.</b> In 1902 Dresser met with U.S. senators and the Secretary of State in Washington, D.C. He also submitted papers with the U.S. State Department asking for an extension of copyright protection outside the United States, especially in Canada and England.|$|E

25|$|Australian <b>copyright</b> <b>law</b> has {{historically}} been influenced by British <b>copyright</b> <b>law</b> and International <b>copyright</b> agreements.

Australian <b>copyright</b> <b>law</b> originates in British <b>copyright</b> <b>law</b> which was established by the British parliament through the Australian Courts Act 1828. The British Statute of Anne 1709, which awarded copyright protection to books, acted as a blueprint for the extension of copyright to new types of subject matter in the 18th and 19th Century. When <b>copyright</b> <b>law</b> was introduced into Australia in 1928 British <b>copyright</b> <b>law</b> had been extended beyond literary property to include engravings and sculptures.

The description of the project was also taken word-for-word from a description by Clowes of his comic. Clowes' attorney, Michael Kump, has since sent a cease-and-desist letter to LaBeouf's attorney, which LaBeouf posted on Twitter.|$|E
5|$|The {{tightening}} {{of laws and}} increased enforcement by police {{on behalf of the}} British Phonographic Industry (BPI), Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and other industry groups—often for peripheral issues such as tax evasion—gradually drove the distributors of for-profit vinyl and CD bootlegs further underground.

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} a cultural history of Australian <b>copyright</b> <b>law</b> and related artistic controversies. It examines {{a number of}} disputes over authorship, collaboration, and appropriation {{across a variety of}} cultural fields. It considers legal controversies over the plagiarism of texts, the defacing of paintings, the sampling of musical works, the ownership of plays, the co-operation between film-makers, the sharing of MP 3 files on the Internet, and the appropriation of Indigenous culture. Such narratives and stories relate to a broad range of works and subject matter that are protected by <b>copyright</b> <b>law.</b> This study offers an archive of oral histories and narratives of artistic creators about <b>copyright</b> <b>law.</b> It is founded upon interviews with creative artists and activists who have been involved in copyright litigation and policy disputes. This dialogical research {{provides a}}n insight into the material and social effects of <b>copyright</b> <b>law.</b> This thesis concludes that <b>copyright</b> <b>law</b> is not just a ‘creature of statute’, {{but it is also a}} social and imaginative construct. In the lived experience of the law, questions of aesthetics and ethics are extremely important. Industry agreements are quite influential. Contracts play an important part in the operation of <b>copyright</b> <b>law.</b> The media profile of personalities involved in litigation and policy debates is pertinent. This thesis claims that <b>copyright</b> <b>law</b> can be explained by a mix of social factors such as ethical standards, legal regulations, market forces, and computer code. It can also be understood in terms of the personal stories and narratives that people tell about litigation and <b>copyright</b> <b>law</b> reform.

5|$|Apple's {{litigation}} over {{object code}} {{contributed to the}} development of contemporary copyright law because the company's object code cases brought different results in different courts, creating a conflict of laws that resulted in international litigation. In the 1980s, Apple litigated two copyright cases with central issues that included the question of whether object code (as contrasted with source code) of a computer program is subject to <b>copyright</b> <b>laws.</b> A third case in which Apple was not a party but that involved the Apple decisions followed in New Zealand. The specific cases were Computer Edge Pty. Ltd. v Apple Computer Inc. (1986, Australia) ("Computer Edge"), Apple Computer Inc. v Mackintosh Computers Ltd., (Canada, 1987) ("Apple v. Mackintosh"), and IBM v. Computer Imports Ltd. ("IBM v. Computer Imports"), (New Zealand, 1989).|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} assumed to have been lost for many years until a paper copy was {{identified}} in 1968 in the Library of Congress Paper Print archive by Michael Pointer, a historian of Sherlock Holmes films. Because motion pictures were not covered by <b>copyright</b> <b>laws</b> until 1912, paper prints were submitted by studios wishing to register their works. These were made using light-sensitive paper of the same width and length as the film itself, and developed as though a still photograph. Both the Edison Company and the Biograph Company submitted entire motion pictures as paper prints, {{and it is in}} this form that most of them survive. The film has subsequently been transferred to 16 mm film in the Library of Congress collection.|$|E
5|$|In these {{conflict}} of laws cases, Apple met with conflicting international judicial opinions: an Australian court decision conflicted with a Canadian court decision on the copyrightability of object code. In IBM v. Computer Imports, the High Court of New Zealand then considered these prior decisions and sided with the Canadian decision in ruling that, although object code is not an original literary work in its own right, it is a reproduction of source code in material form and therefore an infringement of copyright takes place if it is copied without the authorization of the copyright owner. Such legal conflicts affected not only Apple, but all other software companies as well, and the conflicts remained unresolved until {{the creation of an}} international legal regime embodied in further changes to national <b>copyright</b> <b>laws,</b> which ultimately made object code subject to copyright law. These revisions of law in favor of making object code subject to copyright law are still controversial. The revisions also form the technical underpinnings (via the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and the Electronic Communications Privacy Act) for the legal notions of electronic privacy violation and computer trespass, as well as the further development of anti-hacking law-making such as the Patriot Act and the Convention on Cybercrime.|$|E
40|$|In this book, Benjamin Farrand employs an {{interdisciplinary}} approach that combines legal analysis with political theory {{to explore the}} development of <b>copyright</b> <b>law</b> in the EU.

5|$|When Salten {{originally}} published Bambi in 1923, {{he did so}} under Germany's <b>copyright</b> <b>laws,</b> which required no statement that the novel was copyrighted. In the 1926 republication, he did include a United States copyright notice, so the work is considered to have been copyrighted in the United States in 1926. In 1936, Salten sold some rights to the novel to MGM producer Sidney Franklin who passed them on to Walt Disney {{for the creation of}} a film adaptation. After Salten's death in 1945, his daughter Anna Wyler inherited the copyright and renewed the novel's copyrighted status in 1954 (U.S. copyright law in effect at the time provided for an initial term of 28 years from the date of first publication in the U.S., which could be extended for an additional 28 years provided the copyright holder filed for renewal before the expiration of the initial copyright). In 1958, she formulated three agreements with Disney regarding the novel's rights. Upon her death in 1977, the rights passed to her husband, Veit Wyler, and her children, who held on to them until 1993 when he sold the rights to the publishing house Twin Books. Twin Books and Disney disagreed on the terms and validity of Disney's original contract with Anna Wyler and Disney's continued use of the Bambi name.|$|E

40|$|This essay {{examines}} and criticizes <b>copyright</b> <b>law</b> {{as it now}} {{functions in}} Western society. I argue that <b>copyright</b> <b>law</b> only serves corporate interests and functions to limit the development of and use of cultural symbols and texts. In effect, this eliminates the use of cultural texts by marginalized groups. Furthermore, I bring to light several case studies that suggest <b>copyright</b> <b>law</b> does not only hinder the production of cultural material, but {{is not necessary to}} facilitate a healthy environment for the production and distribution of cultural material within a given society. Conversely, I suggest that by way of eliminating <b>copyright</b> <b>law</b> altogether, we may expedite a process I call the "democratization of cultural production and exchange". By allowing citizen consumers of cultural products, using new digital technologies, to assign cultural value to cultural texts without the politics and economic injustices that arise from the use and abuse of <b>copyright</b> <b>law,</b> we may have a richer and ultimately more economically sound system by which cultural texts can be generated and shared. In order to defend against those who have similar notions about <b>copyright</b> <b>law</b> as I, but call for the implementation of a limited <b>copyright</b> <b>law,</b> I explain how communities and individual artists can and indeed do thrive while entirely disregarding <b>copyright</b> <b>law.</b> This paper should motivate future scholars to examine in particular the compatibility of outdated <b>copyright</b> <b>law</b> with digital technologies and web-based services. It is suggested through my initial research that these services can and will replace the function of rigid <b>copyright</b> <b>law</b> to help facilitate and incentivize a democratized and streamlined system of cultural production and exchange...|$|R
