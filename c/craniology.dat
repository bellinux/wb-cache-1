Patrick Brantlinger says that ... the spell of <b>craniology,</b> phrenology, physiognomy, and other attempts to quantify racial inequalities by physical measurement hovers over ...the ethnological and anthropological debates of the mid- and late-Victorian eras. These attempts expressed a materialist determinism, strongly associated with scientific explanation, that underscored the inevitability of the extinction or extermination of the [...] "lower races" [...] by the [...] "higher" [...] ones in [...] "the struggle for existence".|$|E
50|$|In medicine, he {{specialised}} {{in what is}} now psychiatry. In 1822 {{he published}} A Treatise on Diseases of the Nervous System (pt.

Prichard's work was also the first definition of senile dementia in the English language. Augstein has suggested that these works were aimed at the prevalent materialist theories of mind, phrenology and <b>craniology.</b> She has also suggested that Prichard was influenced by the somatic school of German Romantic psychiatric thought, in particular Christian Friedrich Nasse, and (eclectically) Johann Christian August Heinroth; this in addition to an acknowledged debt to Jean-Étienne Dominique Esquirol.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the mid-nineteenth}} century, anthropologists found it crucial to {{distinguish}} {{between male and female}} skulls. An anthropologist of the time, James McGrigor Allan, argued that the female brain was similar to that of an animal. This allowed anthropologists to declare that women were in fact more emotional and less rational than men. McGrigor then concluded that women’s brains were more analogous to infants, thus deeming them inferior at the time. [...] To further these claims of female inferiority and silence the feminists of the time, other anthropologists joined in on the studies of the female skull. These cranial measurements are the basis of what is known as <b>craniology.</b> These cranial measurements were also used to draw a connection between women and black people.|$|E
50|$|Popular {{political}} {{practices of}} the time reinforced colonial rule by legitimizing European (and/ or Japanese) male authority, and also legitimizing female and non-mother-country race inferiority through studies of <b>Craniology,</b> Comparative Anatomy, and Phrenology. Biologists, naturalists, anthropologists, and ethnologists of the 19th century were focused {{on the study of}} colonized indigenous women, {{as in the case of}} Georges Cuvier's study of Sarah Baartman. Such cases embraced a natural superiority and inferiority relationship between the races based on the observations of naturalists' from the mother-countries. European studies along these lines gave rise to the perception that African women's anatomy, and especially genitalia, resembled those of mandrills, baboons, and monkeys, thus differentiating colonized Africans from what were viewed as the features of the evolutionarily superior, and thus rightfully authoritarian, European woman.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} {{to what would}} now be viewed as pseudo-scientific studies of race, which tended to reinforce a belief in an inherent mother-country racial superiority, a new supposedly [...] "science-based" [...] ideology concerning gender roles also then emerged {{as an adjunct to}} the general body of beliefs of inherent superiority of the colonial era. Female inferiority across all cultures was emerging as an idea supposedly supported by <b>craniology</b> that led scientists to argue that the typical brain size of the female human was, on the average, slightly smaller than that of the male, thus inferring that therefore female humans must be less developed and less evolutionarily advanced than males. [...] This finding of relative cranial size difference was later simply attributed to the general typical size difference of the human male body versus that of the typical human female body.|$|E

He won a scholarship of the Medical Faculty and between 1892 and 1893 he worked at the Charcot's clinic for neurological diseases in Paris, where he met with leading figures of the French neurology. At the clinic, he started his major works on the thyroid gland, and also worked with Emanuel Formánek, publishing several papers together.|$|E
5000|$|All of Oken's {{writings}} are deductive {{illustrations of}} an assumed principle, which, with other philosophers of the transcendental school, he deemed {{equal to the}} explanation of all the mysteries of nature. According to him, the head was a repetition of the trunk—a kind of second trunk, with its limbs and other appendages; this sum of his observations and comparisons—few of which he ever gave in detail—ought always to be borne in mind in comparing the share taken by Oken in homological anatomy with the progress made by other cultivators of that philosophical branch of the science. The idea of the analogy between the skull, or parts of the skull, and the vertebral column had been previously propounded and ventilated in their lectures by Johann von Autenrieth (1772-1835) and Carl Kielmeyer (1765-1844), and {{in the writings of}} Johann Frank (1745-1821). By Oken it was applied chiefly in illustration of the mystical system of Schelling—the [...] "all-in-all" [...] and [...] "all-in-every-part." [...] From the earliest to the latest of Oken's writings on the subject, [...] "the head is a repetition of the whole trunk with all its systems: the brain is the spinal cord; the cranium is the vertebral column; the mouth is intestine and abdomen; the nose is the lungs and thorax; the jaws are the limbs; and the teeth the claws or nails." [...] Johann von Spix (1781-1826) in his folio Cephalogenesis (1818), richly illustrated comparative <b>craniology,</b> but presented the facts under the same transcendental guise; and Georges Cuvier (1769-1832) availed himself of the extravagances of these disciples of Schelling to cast ridicule on the whole inquiry into those higher relations of parts to the archetype which Sir Richard Owen (1804-1892) called [...] "general homologies." ...|$|E

40|$|Midsagittal {{cerebral}} morphology {{provides a}} homologous geometrical reference for brain shape and cortical vs. subcortical spatial relationships.

The only evident pattern of covariation was associated with fronto-parietal cortical bulging. The allometric component was weak for the cortical profile, but more robust for the posterior subcortical areas. Apparent sex differences were evidenced in size but not in brain shape. Cortical and subcortical elements displayed scarcely integrated changes, suggesting a modular separation between these two areas. However, a certain correlation was found between posterior subcortical and parietal cortical variations.

40|$|Abstract. The {{interpretation}} {{and analysis of}} anomalies is itself theory-dependent, as illustrated {{in the case of}} the ox phos debate in biochemistry in the 1960 s. Here, the perceived threat of six anomalies to an existing research lineage depended on perspective, or Kuhnian paradigm. The ambiguous status of anomalies sharpens the problem of Kuhnian incommensurability. But the details of the historical case also indicate a possible solution. The asymmetric organization of multiple anomalies strongly indicated interparadigm disagreement, and thus how to orient discourse and frame evidence. I briefly extend the results of this historical case analysis to Darwin's synthesis and to gendered bias in <b>craniology,</b> to profile their prospective generality. In developing the workshop's theme, I want to focus on how history can offer empiricial data on philosophical questions. Philosophical may offer epistemological, or normative, aims [...] the “whys”. History, however, answers the epistemic, or descriptive, questions [...] the “hows ” of sceintific practice.

40|$|What {{should we}} study? The {{eighteenth-century}} 				luminary and poet Alexander Pope {{had this to}} say on the subject: 2 ̆ 2 Know then thyself, 				presume not God to scan; The proper study of mankind is man 2 ̆ 2 (An Essay on Man, 				 1733). He was not alone in this opinion. The philosophers of the Enlightenment [...] of 				which we may count Pope [...] all believed that humans would benefit most from a proper 				comprehension of temporal things, and most particularly humanity itself. For them, 				understanding humanity meant, first and foremost, understanding the human body. 				Naturally, then, the philosophes and their successors paid close attention to the 				body. They cut it up, took it apart, measured it and attempted to see how it worked. 				They were most interested in one part in particular [...] the human head. It was the seat 				of the human characteristic the Enlightenment scientists admired most: intelligence. 				If one could get a handle on the human cranium, then one would understand what it 				meant to be human. Or at least so they thought. In her fascinating new book The 				Skull Collectors: Race, Science and America 2 ̆ 7 s Unburied Dead, Ann Fabian introduces 				us to a group of American philosophes who began to collect and study human crania in 				the first half of the nineteenth century. Not surprisingly, they took most of their 				cues from their European counterparts. They did, however, adapt <b>craniology</b> to a 				peculiar American context. Living in a social order in part built on supposed racial 				difference, the American skull collectors knew that what they said about Africans 				mattered. Their work could support the suppositions of slavery, or not. Moreover, 				living in a social order that was at the very time they were working involved in a 				quasi-genocidal campaign against indigenous peoples, the American skull collectors 				knew that what they said about Native Americans mattered as well. Their work might 				buttress the movement for Indian removal, or it might not. And being people of the 				 2 ̆ 2 New World, 2 ̆ 2 the American skull collectors knew that they were looked down upon by 				many of their European colleagues. They needed to collect skulls aggressively in 				order to establish <b>craniology</b> as an American science. As one might expect, the 				American skull collectors were, by our lights, a strange bunch. Racists, 				imperialists, and nationalists to be sure. But also scientists, curators, and 				founders of physical anthropology. Thanks to Ann for bringing them to us in all 				their contradictory richness...|$|E

Orthodox medicine emerged from a number of healing systems in the 19 th century by claiming the superiority and consequent authority of the biomedical model and its special relationship to laboratory science. This process has been seen by some to resemble the growth of religious orthodoxy and the emergence of alternative beliefs with the dissenting medical systems, based on different paradigms, becoming analogous to religious sects. An increasing body of opinion rejects the notion of "objective" knowledge and sees medical knowledge and practice as "socially constructed". An examination of HIV/AIDS measurement and 19 th century <b>craniology</b> and contagion and anti-contagion theories indicates processes which are "contextual" rather than "objective". Heresy and schism are natural concomitants of socially constructed knowledge, functioning as providers of impetus and change and, as such, are to be welcomed as non-orthodox challenges.

40|$|Objective: to {{determine}} the morphometrical variability of dental alveoli bilaterally, depending on {{their position in the}} alveolar part of the mandible. Material and Methods. The object of the study is to certify 70 cranions with mandibles of middle-aged adults (21 - 60 years) and 30 isolated mandibles without gender-and age-related characteristics. The objects of the study were taken from scientific cranial fundamental museum collection of the Department of Human Anatomy. For the scientific research Craniometry method was used according to generally accepted <b>craniology</b> process parameters. Dental alveoli {{on both sides of the}} mandible were studied. Results. It was established that longitudinal diameter prevails at tooth alveoli of a canine, the first and second premolars, cross diameter on the same side of a jaw at the left — at alveoli of a medial incisor and the first premolar in comparison with its right side. At dental alveoli the left-sided depth is larger of the first molar, of the second molar — the right-sided is larger. Longitudinally cross diameter in the direction from alveoli of front teeth to back ones increases at each subsequent alveolus, since the minimum size at incisors and reaching the maximum size at alveoli of the first and second molars. The largest depth of tooth alveoli is determined at a canine, the first and second premolars. Conclusion. Results of the research of bilateral and individual variability of parameters of tooth cells may be used in practical stomatology...|$|E
40|$|One {{of the key}} burdens in {{contemporary}} work on the body and new technologies is that the bio-materiality {{of the body is}} being inexorably superseded by technological innovations that render the limitations and constraints of the bio-body redundant. For instance, in his discussion of 'the effects of technological acceleration arising from digital processing and computer-mediated communications', the cultural theorist Paul Gilroy argues that these effects 'mean that the individual is even less constrained by the immediate forms of physical presence established by the body'. In this essay, I challenge this claim by focusing on the virulent redeployment of the most reductive empirico-positivist conceptualisations of the body by such organisations as law enforcement authorities and military institutions. In the context of the so-called 'war on terror' and the increasing use of biometric technologies in order to secure 'identity dominance' in the fighting of this war, I examine the manner in which essentialised biotypologies are mobilised and reproduced within the discursive practices of such organisations in order, pre-emptively, to identify and capture targeted subjects. Biotypologies, I argue, function to constitute targeted subjects in terms of biometric 'signatures' of essentialised corporeal features, behaviours and practices; these essentialised biometric 'signatures' are constrained precisely by 'the immediate forms of physical presence established by the body'. Genealogically tied to such seemingly outdated disciplines as anthropometry, <b>craniology,</b> phrenology and criminal anthropology, the use of biotypologies by both military and law enforcement authorities reproduces a disciplinary biopolitical regime premised on normative conceptualisations of race, gender, (dis) ability and bodily behaviour. Situated within the domain of policy documents and new technologies, I proceed to examine how these biotypologies of targeted subjects are instrumental in fomenting cultural panics concerning the Arab and/or Muslim and/or figure 'of Middle Eastern appearance'. I conclude by drawing on the work of Reza Aramesh, a contemporary British Iranian artist, in order to address what is at stake for targeted subjects who are compelled to embody these biotypologies in the lived reality of their everyday lives. 18 page(s...|$|E
