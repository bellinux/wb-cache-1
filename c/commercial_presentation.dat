5000|$|One {{anthropologist}} {{has studied}} how in one Maya village of Yucatán, Mexico, involvement in tourism {{is seen as}} dangerous and urban Maya are seen as outsiders to the traditional Maya society. Maya villages that supply much of the migrant labor that goes to Cancun and other tourist destinations also reflect on {{what it means to}} be Maya, and migrants who go to Cancun are seen as [...] "less Maya" [...] than those who stay behind. The migrant workers follow the promise of jobs and socioeconomic advancement to the tourist destinations of Cancun, and in the process they are considered to be [...] "de-Mayanized" [...] by traditional Maya. Traditional Maya [...] "de-ethnicize" [...] urban Maya people as a strategy to keep their traditional ways of life intact. This one anthropologist believes that the traditional Maya fear the urbanization of Maya people because of the cultural commodification that often accompanies the tourism industry. This potential commodification is seen as detrimental to traditional Maya ways of life, mostly by anthropologists who carry a negative ideological perspective on tourism. This idea however cannot be generalized to other Maya communities in Yucatán or even to other indigenous communities in Mexico or any where else in Latin America. [...] In contrast, there are examples throughout Yucatán and Quintana Roo where Maya people are heavily involved in tourism service sector in positive and willing ways. In contrast to the one community mentioned above, Maya communities such as Tulum, Rio Lagartos, Holbox, Isla Mujeres, Dzitnup, Ebtun, Piste, Santa Elena, and Xcalacoop, to mention a few have local economies fully integrated into the tourism network and also maintain traditional culture. Because tourism is an economic service industry that is created out of capitalism there is therefore always unequal benefits; this happens regardless of the racial or cultural identities of those who benefit and those who do not benefits as much. While the Maya people are not required to engage in the tourism industry, tourism often incorporates entire Maya towns and marketplaces. Although most of the people involved in the informal sector are aware of their subordinate economic roles in a larger global system, handicraft vendors continue to 'perform' for Western tourists in order to make their cultural commodities and 'goods' appear to be more 'authentic' and receive tourist capital. This disjunction between public performance and daily life is a perpetual reality for many Maya people living and working in Central America.Heritage tourism excursions tend to be associated with one ethnic group in a given locality. In this context, topic and place becomes the defining characteristic of a people to the exclusion of other perspectives. This creates a dynamic where tourists use the [...] "questioning gaze", in which travelers' questions and skepticism penetrate the <b>commercial</b> <b>presentation</b> of the site, and undermine the producer's dominant narrative. If a tourist feels that a heritage site is producing a dubious interpretation of a cultural expression or experience, the site loses its [...] "authenticity" [...] and it becomes less marketable, and harder to commodify. Three sites in Kenya trace the commodification of particular aspects of the Maasai tribal culture, and how these sites are marketed with varying degrees of commodification and authenticity in order to satisfy tourist expectations.|$|E

40|$|Multimedia presentations are {{applicable}} in various domains such as advertising, <b>commercial</b> <b>presentations</b> or education. Multimedia presentations are described by multimedia documents. The presentation of multimedia documents require vast system resources {{due to the}} huge amount of data {{that has to be}} transferred and processed by the computer system. If multimedia documents can be accessed on-line via different types of networks and be presented on various types of terminals, such as PCs or Set-Top-Units, different amounts of resources may be available at presentation time. Hence, it can happen that there are not enough resources to render a multimedia document according to the specification. For usual multimedia documents resource scarcity implies an arbitrarily reduced quality of the presentation or it can even be impossible to start or continue the presentation. To handle resource scarcity in a better way, multimedia documents can be specified flexible {{so that they can be}} adapted to di [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Multimedia standards, {{frameworks}} {{and models}} are already well established for generalized presentations. However, {{the situation is}} much less advanced for systems, which require the combination of advanced sound-oriented features and capabilities {{similar to those used}} to interact with highly demanding visual content. In this respect, current <b>commercial</b> <b>presentation</b> applications have been found lacking, often revealing multifaceted presentation limitations, including lack of sound control and delivery. They rarely offer cross-platform compatibility, provide limited programmability, are restrictive on data-interaction, and only support static WWW-based delivery. To overcome the above-stated deficiencies, a number of innovations are proposed, including the presentation of a combined multimedia framework, supported by a model that describes content-connectivity and stream-synchronization, enabling interaction for all audiovisual data-types included in the system.
