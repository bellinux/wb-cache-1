50|$|The {{history of}} fair trade {{started in the}} late 1940s in America, with the {{emergence}} of a number of organizations whose goal was to target corporations that symbolize the abuse of capitalism.In 1946 the organization Ten Thousand Villages was created, and was the first official organization to support the idea of fair trade, and equal distribution of trade benefits.The first formal World Fair Trade shops can also be traced back to America, where in 1958 outlets for needlework and small jewelry from Puerto Rico were sold at shop fronts.The movement also saw growth in Europe, headed by Oxfam UK who sold <b>craft</b> <b>good</b> made by Chinese refugees in Oxfam shop front. Oxfam UK protested against the inequality existent within global capitalism, and established the first Fair Trade Organization in 1964.The movement was gained further support after the 1968 United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), which was held in Delhi. The conference addressed the issues faced by developing countries on the international political floor, putting emphasis on the creation of equitable trade agreements.In 1973 Fair Trade Original was responsible for expanding the field of fair trade goods, importing the first fairly traded coffee from Guatemala. After the success of the Guatemalan coffee in the UK, the fair trade range expanded to include tea, cocoa, sugar, wine, spices and rice.By 2008, coffee accounted for 64% of Fair Trade certified products in the United States. In 2009, the market share of Fair Trade products in the UK was valued at £300 million.|$|E

40|$|Highlights • In its Digital Single Market strategy, the European Commission has rightly {{noted the}} {{importance}} of reducing the price paid for basic cross-border parcel delivery by consumers and by small and medium size retail senders. • The payment flows for cross-border parcel delivery are strikingly similar to those for telecommunications. Comparisons with roaming can be instructive. As with roaming, {{it is clear that}} the links between wholesale payments between the national postal operators and retail prices need to be properly understood in order to <b>craft</b> <b>good</b> policy. Another useful lesson is that national postal regulatory authorities are unlikely to address cross-border problems because of limitations in their respective mandates and because they have no incentive to take measures to benefit residents of other countries. • There are also significant differences between roaming and parcel delivery. While high wholesale charges were a major driver of high retail prices for international mobile roaming, the wholesale payments for cross-border parcel delivery appear to be below cost. This implies that it is the ‘spread’ between retail price and thewholesale payment that is inflated, at least for small retail senders and for consumers. • Comprehensive statistics gathering, coordinated at European level, is indispensable...|$|E
40|$|Educators {{in higher}} {{education}} are constantly rethinking about how they can better prepare their graduates for their professional career. The medical faculty at McMaster University pioneered Problem-based Learning (PBL) in the 1960 s as an innovative approach to make learning more relevant and effective. Since then, PBL approach in education has had proven success in many fields of studies, most notably {{in the areas of}} medicine, architecture, nursing and construction management. According to Prof Howard S Barrows, 'An authentic PBL education would require the student to go through the same activities during learning that are valued in the real world. The intent is to challenge the student with patient problems that he will be faced in practice both as a stimulus for learning and a focus for organizing what has been learned for later recall and application to future work. ' The focus of learning is the problem. Students acquire new knowledge and learn by solving problems. Hence, the quality of problem is important for the full benefits of PBL to be realized. Due to educators' own learning in the traditional education curriculum, most educators tend to craft problem based on their subject expertise. This violates the multi-disciplinary richness that PBL advocates. Being able to <b>craft</b> <b>good</b> problem becomes a critical skill for educators in PBL. This paper aims to describe the role of effective problem for reaping the full benefits of Authentic PBL and to posit the principles of designing effective problem...|$|E

40|$|A lot {{of people}} do not have the time to <b>craft</b> <b>good,</b> new playlists, they just want to find them online. Similarly, the search for new music is often hard. Many music {{aggregation}} sites exist, but only link songs by artist, title, or genre. We created a search engine to create playlists of similar music to the query for users. Our system recommends music based on a series of algorithms which compare songs actual musical qualities. Our results show a great deal of promise, all songs returned are quite similar. However speed is quite an issue. Our extraction takes almost five minutes, which is an eternity for a web application. Our comparisons can be returned at a decent rate, with about ten songs being compared every three seconds. From this, we have found that identifying a song is quicker than performing analysis, and thus we implemented an audio fingerprinting module to compensate for the speed. From our systems results, we concluded that computing similarities across these music features provides a good way to explore music, but that in order to compete with other systems such as Pandora or Spotify, we would need to have a much deeper music database as well as a player system implemented. To make our system useful, we would want to take popular songs and then find lesser known songs to give smaller artists more exposure. Serendipity is less of a playlist creator, and more of a search engine for finding new music. To realize these goals, we would need to partner with someone who can get us the music files of these lesser known artists and also address our speed issues through either a distributed system or increased optimization of our core algorithms...|$|E
40|$|Why do some autocracies {{actively}} {{participate in}} {{international human rights}} institutions while their autocratic peers prefer to keep their engagement at a minimum? I argue that autocrats are motivated to participate {{by a desire to}} <b>craft</b> <b>good</b> reputations before domestic and international audiences. Hampered by commitment and information problems in their power-sharing relationship with ruling coalitions, autocrats with different support bases from their predecessors seek popular support to deter potential challenges from their new allies. Such autocrats find multiple ratifications of human rights agreements (HRAs) an expedient policy tool either to signal a break from their repressive autocratic predecessors or to reassure citizens by demonstrating continuity with their democratic predecessors in human rights protections. Among many other liberalization policies under autocrats, HRA memberships help governments appear to care for “broad interests” while still granting concentrated benefits to a small circle of regime insiders. Such autocrats make their promises more credible by accepting extra monitoring/enforcement procedures in addition to ratifying the main treaty, as long as the treaties concern general rights protections and allow them some control over those procedures. Likewise, autocracies actively engage in the Universal Periodic Review when seeking an enhanced reputation on human rights, either on their own or in relation to a particular state under review, {{in the eyes of the}} international audience. In particular, autocratic states with high profile positions in other international human rights institutions issue more meaningful recommendations to peer states. Autocracies also issue more serious recommendations to their foreign policy adversaries. Last, the meaningful recommendations issued by autocratic states mostly refer to international HRAs, but stop short of encouraging specific domestic reforms, as the recommending autocracy commits to a higher number of HRAs. I find strong supporting evidence in a series of empirical analyses based on a newly created dataset of individual autocrats’ records of ratification and acceptance of optional monitoring/enforcement of core UN HRAs from 1966 to 2008 and on a newly created directed dyadic dataset on UPR recommendations from 2008 to 2011. Qualitative data from elite interviews and site observation further corroborate the main findings...|$|E
40|$|In its Digital Single Market (DSM) strategy, the European Commission has rightly {{noted the}} {{importance}} of lowering the price paid for basic cross-border delivery by consumers and by small and medium size retail shippers. Consumers and SMEs may have few alternatives to the National Postal Operators (NPOs), or may be unaware of the options that they have. These concerns led to the Commission to put forward a legislative proposal in May 2016. 3 With its legislative proposal, the Commission has sought (1) to strengthen the data gathering powers of Member State postal regulatory authorities, and to oblige them to collect data at both retail and wholesale levels; (2) to increase transparency into pricing for those who use cross-border parcel delivery services; (3) to oblige Member State postal regulatory authorities to assess annually the affordability of these services; and (4) to open cross-border Terminal Dues (TD) and Inward Land Rates (ILR) arrangements to competitors There are parallels that can be drawn between the payment flows for cross-border parcel delivery and those of telecommunications, especially those of international mobile roaming. As with roaming, {{it is clear that}} the linkages between wholesale payments between and corresponding retail prices need to be properly understood in order to <b>craft</b> <b>good</b> policy. Another useful lesson is that Member State postal regulatory authorities are unlikely to address cross-border problems not only because of limitations in their respective mandates, but also because they have no incentive to take challenging measures to benefit residents of other countries. There are, however, also important differences between roaming versus parcel delivery. Where high wholesale charges were a major driver of high retail prices for international mobile roaming, the wholesale payments for cross-border parcel delivery appear instead to be below cost. This implies that it is the 2 ̆ 01 cspread 2 ̆ 01 d between retail price and the wholesale payment that is inflated, at least for small retail shippers and for consumers. Reviewing the Commission's proposed Regulation with all of this in mind, it appears to be on target. The main question that remains open is whether NPOs will be able to adjust TD and ILR rates upward to reflect true costs, as they will be strongly motivated to do; here as well, however, there are grounds for cautious optimism...|$|E

First, it analyses the various ways “ethnic branding” is an important marketing feature of a craft item and second, it aims to deconstruct the images and texts in terms of notions of “traditional”, “natural” and “authentic”.
