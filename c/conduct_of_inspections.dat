40|$|Aircraft {{structural}} integrity management programs {{are aimed at}} ensuring that aircraft can operate safety and economically throughout its life. As typified by MIL-STD- 1530, this is achieved by: a. Establishing and validating the {{structural integrity}} of aircraft structures; b. Using operational data to update {{the status of the}} structural integrity; c. Providing quantitative data to support decisions related to <b>conduct</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspections</b> and priority for modification; and d. Providing lesson-learnt to be applied to the next generation of aircraft design/modifications. The current aircraft structural integrity management programs are primarily related to metallic structures. Four aircraft incidents are considered milestones in aircraft structure integrity, all of which involve metallic structures. The incidents and the associated impact on aircraft structural integrity were: a. 1954 - De Havilland Comet, loss of two aircraft due to fuselage failure. Impact: awareness that finite fatigue life is important. b. 1969 - General Dynamics F- 111 wing failure due to undetected material flaw, which initiated the development of the damage tolerance concept c. 1977 - Dan Air Boeing 707 loss of tailplane due to fatigue failure of spar, resulting in the realisation that old aircraft become more fatigue critical. d. 1988 - Aloha Airlines Boeing 737 loss of large part of fuselage due to multiple fatigue cracks, which highlighted the issue of Multiple Site fatigue Damage (MSD) in aging aircraft. The use of composites in aircraft construction has increased steadily since being introduced in the 1960 s and 70 s. Modern combat aircraft, such as the F- 22 and F- 35 have approximately thirty percent by weight of aircraft A method of simulating Structural Integrity, the Structural Integrity Failure Causation Model (SIFCM) was developed. Using the SIFCM, it was identified that a combination of fail-safe and damage tolerant structures should be used for composite structures anticipated to experience a severe impact environment. This should be combined with: a. High probability of detection for impact damage; b. ASI standards such as MIL-STD- 1530 C, should be modified to include more specific guidance regarding composite unique degradation modes, specifically impact, and c. Development of impact damage criteria and definition of impact environment to support design and certification activities...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Hygiene {{inspections}} on passenger {{ships are}} important {{for the prevention of}} communicable diseases. The European Union (EU) countries conduct hygiene inspections on passenger ships {{in order to ensure that}} appropriate measures have been taken to eliminate potential sources of contamination which could lead to the spread of communicable diseases. This study was implemented within the framework of the EU SHIPSAN project and it investigates the legislation applied and practices of hygiene inspections of passenger ships in the EU Member States (MS) and European Free Trade Association countries. Methods Two questionnaires were composed and disseminated to 28 countries. A total of 92 questionnaires were completed by competent authorities responsible for hygiene inspections (n = 48) and the creation of legislation (n = 44); response rates were 96 %, and 75. 9 %, respectively. Results Out of the 48 responding authorities responsible for hygiene inspections, a routine programme was used by 19 (39. 6 %) of these to conduct inspections of ships on national voyages and by 26 (54. 2 %) for ships on international voyages. Standardised inspection forms are used by 59. 1 % of the authorities. A scoring inspection system is applied by five (11. 6 %) of the 43 responding authorities. Environmental sampling is conducted by 84. 1 % of the authorities (37 out of 44). The inspection results are collected and analysed by 54. 5 % (24 out of 44) of the authorities, while 9 authorities (20. 5 %) declared that they publish the results. Inspections are conducted during outbreak investigations by 75 % and 70. 8 % of the authorities, on ships on national and international voyages, respectively. A total of 31 (64. 6 %) and 39 (81. 3 %) authorities conducted inspections during complaint investigations on ships on international and on national voyages, respectively. Port-to-port communication between the national port authorities was reported by 35. 4 % (17 out of 48) of the responding authorities and 20. 8 % (10 out of 48) of the port authorities of other countries. Conclusion This study revealed a diversity of approaches and practices in the <b>conduct</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspections,</b> differences in the qualifications/knowledge/experience of inspectors, the legislation applied during inspections, and the lack of communication and training among many EU countries. An integrated European inspection programme involving competent expert inspectors in each EU Member States and special training for ship hygiene delivered to crew members and inspectors would help to minimize the risk of communicable diseases. Common inspection tools at a European level for hygiene inspection practices and port-to-port communication are needed. </p...|$|E
40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper, {{presented}} at the British Educational Research Association Annual Conference, Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, 3 - 6 September 2008. Also available at [URL] Since 1995, the Office for Standards in Education (Ofsted) has inspected the quality of all Initial Teacher Training (ITT) provision in England {{on behalf of the}} Training and Development Agency for Schools (TDA). According to the current Ofsted framework, the main purposes of the inspection of ITT are "to ensure public accountability for the quality of ITT; stimulate improvement in the quality of provision; provide objective judgements on providers for public information; inform policy; enable the statutory link to be made between funding and quality; and check compliance with statutory requirements" (Ofsted, 2005, p. 1). Other proposed purposes of ITT inspection include for comparison or compliance (Blake et al., 1995). Since the introduction of ITT inspection however, generally the response from teacher educators has been negative (Graham, 1997; Sutherland, 1997) and a number of concerns and issues have been raised over the inspection process and/or the frameworks adopted (see for example, Cale & Harris, 2003; Campbell & Husbands 2000; Hardy & Evans, 2000; Sinkinson & Jones, 2001). Focus of Enquiry: The focus of this enquiry is on the Ofsted experiences of a higher education institution-based ITT secondary provider in the East Midlands. The provider trains approximately 130 teachers a year via a one year Post Graduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) course. Based primarily on the experiences and reflections of ITT staff following their most recent "short" inspection of their PGCE course in 2005 / 06, this paper provides a further critical account of ITT inspection as a follow up to earlier papers published by the researchers and colleagues and aims to highlight some of the concerns with inspection and the current inspection framework and process. Whilst most of the concerns identified relate to inspection generally and are issues faced by all providers, others are specific to the provider’s and researchers’ own Ofsted experiences and stem from issues and/or situations which primarily arose during their recent inspection. Although the paper is a critique, {{it is important to note}} that the provider and staff in question are not anti-inspection, nor wish to appear merely ‘grumpy old teacher educators’ intent on bemoaning a system for no good reason. To the contrary, the importance of accountability and continual improvement is recognized. Rather, it is hoped that fellow professionals will be able to relate to and/or sympathise with the concerns and concur that any "grumpiness" is justified. Research Methods: The account is informed by data from various sources. ITT staff who were involved in the inspection kept journals for a period of seven months leading up to, during, and following the inspection in which they detailed their Ofsted activities, experiences and reflections. Staff periodically completed their journals recording the preparation, work and meetings they were involved in, and noting and reflecting on any problems, issues, concerns, anxieties, frustrations and/or other emotions they experienced. Documentary evidence in the form of Ofsted Handbooks, Guidance plus other paperwork the inspection generated was also collected for analysis. Finally, to augment and support the findings from the journals and documentary evidence, a review of related literature was undertaken. Analysis of the data involved identification of the key issues. Findings: From the above, a number of concerns and issues and some fundamental flaws with ITT inspection and the current inspection framework and process were identified. Some of the major and general concerns related to, or associated with inspection included the high stakes involved, in that Ofsted inspection results are published and the TDA is required to take the outcomes into account when funding ITT provision and allocating ITT places; the validity, reliability and credibility of the inspection process and framework; and the tensions and contradictions between inspection, the base and resulting report for which is the university, and the notion of ITT as a model of partnership. More specific issues relating to the provider’s experiences in question related to the general <b>conduct</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspections,</b> for example, in terms of the frequency, timing and notice given and the unreasonable expectations and requests often made by the inspectors; the "stage management" required for such "events"; and the impact of inspection on providers, schools, and trainees. The latter included the increased pressure and workload on all involved as well as the cost and financial implications of inspection. In summary though, the paper concludes that the current inspection framework is fundamentally flawed and if the issue is not soon rectified, the future provision of ITT could seriously be jeopardized. Further, it is noted how the situation this provider currently faces as a consequence of the inspection framework is posing a serious threat to the future of their secondary ITT course. ITT staff therefore not only feel deeply worried by this, but exceptionally and justifiably "grumpy"...|$|E
