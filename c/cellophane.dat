5|$|British <b>Cellophane</b> Ltd, a {{joint venture}} between La <b>Cellophane</b> SA and Courtaulds opened a major factory {{producing}} <b>cellophane</b> in Bridgwater 1937. The factory produced Bailey Bridges during World War II for the invasion of Europe. Bought by UCB Films in 1996, the town suffered a blow in 2005 when Innovia Films closed the <b>cellophane</b> factory. At one time the factory employed around 3,000 people, although at the time of closure this had been reduced to just 250. However recovery has begun with the establishment of new businesses on the Express Park business park including the relocation of Gerber Juice and new enterprises Toolstation and Interpet as well as the Exel centre for the NHS Logistics Authority.|$|E
5|$|Space Invaders {{was first}} {{released}} in a cocktail-table format {{with black and}} white graphics, while the Western release by Midway was in an upright cabinet format. The upright cabinet uses strips of orange and green <b>cellophane</b> over the screen to simulate color graphics. The graphics are reflected onto a painted backdrop of a moon against a starry background. Later Japanese releases used rainbow-colored <b>cellophane,</b> such as T.T. Space Invaders in 1978, followed by a version with a full-color display. The cabinet artwork features large humanoid monsters not present in the game. Nishikado attributes this to the artist basing the designs on the original title, Space Monsters, rather than referring to the in-game graphics.|$|E
5|$|Max Eckhardt's Shiny Brite company {{manufactured}} colorful glass ornaments in {{a variety}} of sizes and shapes through the era. Packed in boxes by the dozen or half dozen, glimpses of the ornaments could be caught through the <b>cellophane</b> windows of the boxes' covers. The reds and greens of the past were supplemented with turquoise, chartreuse, orange, purple, and other vibrant colors.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Pierre Messiaen enlisted and Cécile took their two boys {{to live with her}} brother in Grenoble. There Messiaen became fascinated with drama, reciting Shakespeare to his brother {{with the help of a}} home-made toy theatre with translucent backdrops made from old <b>cellophane</b> wrappers. At this time he also adopted the Roman Catholic faith. Later, Messiaen felt most at home in the Alps of the Dauphiné, where he had a house built south of Grenoble where he composed most of his music.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of World War II, both Parker Brothers and Waddington stockpiled {{materials}} they could use for further game production. During the war, Monopoly was produced with wooden tokens in the U.S., and the game's <b>cellophane</b> cover was eliminated. In the UK, metal tokens were also eliminated, and a special spinner was introduced {{to take the place}} of dice. The game remained in print for a time even in the Netherlands, as the printer there was able to maintain a supply of paper. Elizabeth Magie's second patent on The Landlord's Game expired in September, 1941, and it is believed that after the expiration, she was no longer promoted as an inventor of Monopoly. The game itself remained popular during the war, particularly in camps, and soldiers playing the game became part of the product's advertising in 1944.|$|E
5|$|Bridgwater was {{developed}} during the Industrial Revolution as the area's leading port. The River Parrett was navigable by large ships as far as Bridgwater. Cargoes were then loaded onto smaller boats at Langport Quay, next to the Bridgwater Bridge, to be carried further up river to Langport; or they could turn off at Burrowbridge and then travel via the River Tone to Taunton. The Parrett is now only navigable as far as Dunball Wharf. Bridgwater, in the 19th and 20th centuries, was a centre for the manufacture of bricks and clay roof tiles, and later <b>cellophane,</b> but those industries have now stopped. With its good links to the motorway system, Bridgwater has developed as a distribution hub for companies such as Argos, Toolstation, Morrisons and Gerber Juice. AgustaWestland manufactures helicopters in Yeovil, and Normalair Garratt, builder of aircraft oxygen systems, is also based in the town. Many towns have encouraged small-scale light industries, such as Crewkerne's Ariel Motor Company, one of the UK's smallest car manufacturers.|$|E
5|$|As trade {{expanded}} {{during the}} Industrial Revolution, Bridgwater {{was linked to}} Taunton by the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal (1827), although initially it ran from a basin south of Bridgwater at Huntworth. As trade grew docks {{were built in the}} town, linked to an extension of the canal, with both opening in 1841. The docks were dredged by a scraper-dredger Bertha similar to the one Brunel had designed for the Bristol Floating Harbour. 14 June 1841 saw the opening of the Bristol and Exeter Railway from Bristol to Bridgwater. The railway also opened a coach and wagon works in the town; the last of the buildings is currently in 2005 scheduled for demolition. Bridgwater railway station, designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel is now a Grade II listed building. An end to the unequal competition between rail and canal came in 1867 when the Bristol and Exeter Railway purchased the canal. A number of local branches were also built, for example to serve the Northgate Brewery (now replaced by a car park north of Angel Crescent) and the former British <b>Cellophane</b> factory. The Somerset and Dorset branch line to Edington was opened in 1890. Its former Bridgwater station is now occupied by J Sainsbury.|$|E

25|$|The {{principal}} {{industrial uses}} of carbon disulfide, consuming 75% {{of the annual}} production are the manufacture of viscose rayon, <b>cellophane</b> film.|$|E
25|$|For example, {{ordinary}} <b>cellophane</b> is birefringent. Polarizers {{are routinely}} {{used to detect}} stress in plastics such as polystyrene and polycarbonate.|$|E
25|$|Wood {{has been}} used for {{thousands}} of years for fuel, as a construction material, for making tools and weapons, furniture and paper, and as a feedstock for the production of purified cellulose and its derivatives, such as <b>cellophane</b> and cellulose acetate.|$|E
25|$|This {{reaction}} {{is the basis}} of the manufacture of regenerated cellulose, the main ingredient of viscose, rayon and <b>cellophane.</b> Both xanthates and the related thioxanthates (derived from treatment of CS2 with sodium thiolates) are used as flotation agents in mineral processing.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the newspapers, Cox used his building for his printing business. Both enterprises were part of his company, Edward E. Cox Printer, Incorporated. The modern printing equipment enabled Cox to print color labels and wrappers made of glassine and <b>cellophane.</b> Printing products were shipped all over the United States.|$|E
25|$|In Korean cuisine, {{sweet potato}} starch {{is used to}} produce dangmyeon (<b>cellophane</b> noodles). Sweet {{potatoes}} are also boiled, steamed, or roasted, and young stems are eaten as namul. Pizza restaurants such as Pizza Hut and Domino's in Korea are using sweet potatoes as a popular topping. Sweet potatoes are also used in the distillation {{of a variety of}} Soju.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two main}} {{packaging}} systems for dried pasta: <b>cellophane</b> bags which are moisture-proof, easy to use in automatic machines, but difficult to stack, and boxes which are easy to stack and print advertising, and protect the fragile pastas. In packaging line the product is first scaled, then sealed in the package, detected for open flap and metals, double-checked the weight and last packed in large cases.|$|E
25|$|In December 2007, The Washington Post {{reported}} {{that there were some}} discrepancies regarding reports about the number of times Zubaydah was waterboarded. According to a previous account by former CIA officer John Kiriakou, Abu Zubaydah broke after just 35seconds of waterboarding, which involved stretching <b>cellophane</b> over his mouth and nose and pouring water on his face to create the sensation of drowning. Kiriakou later admitted that he had no first hand knowledge of the interrogation and accused the CIA of using him to spread disinformation.|$|E
25|$|In the U.S., the {{traditional}} entrée {{is a choice}} of hamburger, cheeseburger, or a four-piece order of Chicken McNuggets (or a double cheeseburger or six-piece order of Chicken McNuggets for the Mighty Kids Meals); the sides are fries and sliced apples. Milk, chocolate milk, boxed apple juice, and {{the traditional}} soda are choices for drinks. Some U.S. franchises also include a small <b>cellophane</b> package of McDonaldland cookies. In 2009, McDonald's offered a Happy Meal Wrap, but it was discontinued later that year due to low sales.|$|E
25|$|Wood {{is used in}} {{thousands}} of ways, e.g. buildings, furniture, boats, airplanes, wagons, car parts, musical instruments, sports equipment, railroad ties, utility poles, fence posts, pilings, toothpicks, matches, plywood, coffins, shingles, barrel staves, toys, tool handles, picture frames, veneer, charcoal and firewood. Wood pulp is widely used to make paper, paperboard, cellulose sponges, <b>cellophane</b> and some important plastics and textiles, such as cellulose acetate and rayon. Bamboo stems also have hundreds of uses, including paper, buildings, furniture, boats, musical instruments, fishing poles, water pipes, plant stakes, and scaffolding. Trunks of palm trees and tree ferns are often used for building. Stems of Reed are an important building material for use in thatching in some areas.|$|E
25|$|Sulfuric acid {{is a very}} {{important}} commodity chemical, and indeed, a nation's sulfuric acid production is a good indicator of its industrial strength. World production in 2004 was about 180 million tonnes, with the following geographic distribution: Asia 35%, North America (including Mexico) 24%, Africa 11%, Western Europe 10%, Eastern Europe and Russia 10%, Australia and Oceania 7%, South America 7%. Most of this amount (≈60%) is consumed for fertilizers, particularly superphosphates, ammonium phosphate and ammonium sulfates. About 20% is used in chemical industry for production of detergents, synthetic resins, dyestuffs, pharmaceuticals, petroleum catalysts, insecticides and antifreeze, as well as in various processes such as oil well acidicizing, aluminium reduction, paper sizing, water treatment. About 6% of uses are related to pigments and include paints, enamels, printing inks, coated fabrics and paper, and the rest is dispersed into a multitude of applications such as production of explosives, <b>cellophane,</b> acetate and viscose textiles, lubricants, non-ferrous metals and batteries.|$|E
500|$|After {{retiring}} from the NFL, Luckman {{went to work for}} Cel-U-Craft, a Chicago-based manufacturer of <b>cellophane</b> products, eventually becoming its president. The company was a part of [...] the Rapid American Corporation of which he also obtained shares. [...] In 1969, RAC was the subject of an IRS investigation over the payment of these shares and dividends, a case that Luckman and his wife appealed.|$|E
500|$|On the {{original}} version of the album, [...] "Train in Vain" [...] was not listed on the sleeve, nor the label on the record itself, but an extraneous sticker indicating the track was affixed to the outer <b>cellophane</b> wrapper. It was also scratched into the vinyl in the run-off area on the fourth side of the album. Later editions included the song in the track listing.|$|E
500|$|Sydenham House was {{previously}} a manor estate {{built in the}} early 16th century, which was refronted and rebuilt after 1613. Its owners were on the losing side in the Civil War {{and again in the}} Monmouth Rebellion. [...] It now stands in the grounds of the former British <b>Cellophane</b> plant. In 2012 EDF purchased the site, including the Grade II listed 16th century building. In 2015 the industrial site was razed to the ground. It is intended for construction of temporary accommodation for 1,000 workers involved in the construction of Hinkley Point C nuclear power station.|$|E
500|$|Brown {{stated that}} he wanted to [...] "redefine" [...] the group and conceptualise a new image that would {{represent}} his perception of their personas. He described the band as [...] "extremely style-savvy" [...] and motivated them to be bold, uninhibited and experimental. The video takes influences from styles of fashion editorial and features the Sugababes in various costumes and guises. Their outfits were created with many fabrics, in addition to newspapers, plastic bin bags and florist's <b>cellophane.</b> Overall, there were 13 costume changes. Scenes for the video were shot {{in a wide range of}} environments and locations, including a fire escape, loading bay, and storage cupboard.|$|E
500|$|Empire {{stated that}} the film was {{targeted}} at children but agreed with other reviewers that the [...] "extremely game cast" [...] was the film's best asset. It gave the film three out of five. TIME gave the film a C-, stating that the film [...] "cannibalizes Walt's vault for jokes" [...] and [...] "fails to find a happy ending that doesn't feel two-dimensional". Similarly, Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian commented that the film [...] "assumes a beady-eyed and deeply humourless sentimentality" [...] and that Adams' performance was the [...] "only decent thing in this overhyped family movie covered in a <b>cellophane</b> shrink-wrap of corporate Disney plastic-ness". Bradshaw gave the film two out of five.|$|E
500|$|Between 1910 and 1930, Simonovich-Efimova was {{a member}} of the Moscow Association of Artists [...] (MTX) where she also {{exhibited}} her works. She became one of the main participants in the revival of the silhouette art at the start of the twentieth century, [...] and also gained a reputation for etching. She presented silhouettes with restrained detail in theatrical performances similar to shadow plays, using blue <b>cellophane</b> to filter the light, unifying various shapes and adding luster to the overall effect. Some of her silhouettes were portraits, like her depiction of Pavel Florensky in 1926, which aptly captured his image, as well as his personality and dress. Her cousin Serov was a constant mentor to both of the Efimovs. They shared him as a teacher and followed his exacting standards to gain his somewhat rare approval.|$|E
500|$|L.A. Woman was {{released}} on April 19, 1971. It reached number nine on the Billboard 200, remaining on the charts for 36 weeks, and reached number 28 in the UK, spending four weeks on the UK Albums Charts. The first cover pressing had a burgundy-colored, curved-corner cardboard cutout sleeve, framing a clear embossed <b>cellophane</b> insert, glued in from behind. Photography was credited to Wendell Hamick. According to Jac Holzman, {{chief executive officer of}} Elektra Records: [...] "I wasn't sure there would be another album ever, so I had Bill Harvey create a collector's cover. The Doors' faces were printed on clear film. The backing color of the inner sleeve could be changed and would affect the mood of the package. This is the first album in which Jim is bearded [...] His photo is on the right, no bigger, no smaller than the others, just another guy in the band." ...|$|E
500|$|Brownlee himself toured {{southern}} Alberta attacking Aberhart's {{policies as}} vague and unconstitutional. [...] In April 1935, {{he gave a}} series of radio speeches designed to counter Aberhart's popular radio program, Back to the Bible Hour. [...] When his customary appeals to logic did not work, Brownlee resorted to attacking Aberhart personally, comparing him to the Pied Piper of Hamelin. [...] Aberhart did not resist the comparison, retorting that the pied piper had [...] "rid the capitol of all the rats"; Brownlee responded that, after doing that, he had led its children to their destruction. [...] In May 1935, after Aberhart announced that his social credit movement would contest the next provincial election, Brownlee ridiculed its candidate-selection process—in which Aberhart personally interviewed and selected more candidates for each riding than could ultimately run—as {{one in which the}} candidates would be [...] "wrapped in <b>cellophane</b> and carefully hidden away so they will not dry out on , until the day he calls out the fittest and discards the rest".|$|E
500|$|Sugar, starch, cotton, linen, hemp, {{some types}} of rope, wood and {{particle}} boards, papyrus and paper, vegetable oils, wax, and natural rubber are examples of commercially important materials made from plant tissues or their secondary products. Charcoal, a pure form of carbon made by pyrolysis of wood, {{has a long history}} as a metal-smelting fuel, as a filter material and adsorbent and as an artist's material {{and is one of the}} three ingredients of gunpowder. Cellulose, the world's most abundant organic polymer, can be converted into energy, fuels, materials and chemical feedstock. Products made from cellulose include rayon and <b>cellophane,</b> wallpaper paste, biobutanol and gun cotton. Sugarcane, rapeseed and soy are some of the plants with a highly fermentable sugar or oil content that are used as sources of biofuels, important alternatives to fossil fuels, such as biodiesel. [...] Sweetgrass was used by NativeAmericanse to ward of bugs like mosquitoes. These bug repelling properties of sweetgrass were later found by the American Chemical Society in the molecules phytol and coumarin.|$|E
500|$|... "Red Dress" [...] {{was also}} {{included}} on the set list for the Sugababes' Change Tour in 2008. During the performance, the song was mashed with Frankie Goes to Hollywood's 1984 single [...] "Two Tribes". Corresponding with {{the title of the}} song, the trio wore red, <b>cellophane</b> dresses for the performance. Berrabah named the outfit one of her favourites to wear during the tour. [...] "Red Dress" [...] was performed at the 2008 Oxygen Festival as part of a set list which included numerous of the group's previous singles. In June 2009, the band performed [...] "Red Dress" [...] at the Cannock Chase Forrest as part of a 75-minute show, and at Canterbury, Kent as the thirteenth song on the set list. [...] "Red Dress" [...] was one of many songs that the group performed on 10 July 2009 at the Riverside Ground in County Durham, England. The fourth line-up of the Sugababes, consisting of Range, Berrabah and Jade Ewen, performed the single in November 2010 at the Yas Hotel in Abu Dhabi, as part of a set list. The trio played the song in September 2011 during their gig at London's nightclub, G-A-Y, in which they wore coordinating, pastel rubber outfits.|$|E
500|$|This {{theme of}} absence was {{reflected}} in the ideas produced by his long hours spent brainstorming with the band. [...] Thorgerson had noted that Roxy Music's Country Life was sold in an opaque green <b>cellophane</b> sleeve – censoring the cover image – and he copied the idea, concealing the artwork for Wish You Were Here in a black-coloured shrink-wrap (therefore making the album art [...] "absent"). [...] The concept behind [...] "Welcome to the Machine" [...] and [...] "Have a Cigar" [...] suggested the use of a handshake (an often empty gesture), and George Hardie designed a sticker containing the album's logo of two mechanical hands engaged in a handshake, to be placed on the opaque sleeve (the mechanical handshake logo would also appear on the labels of the vinyl album this time in a black and blue background). [...] The album's cover images were photographed by Aubrey 'Po' Powell, Storm's partner at the Pink Floyd design studio Hipgnosis and was inspired by the idea that people tend to conceal their true feelings, for fear of [...] "getting burned", and thus two businessmen were pictured shaking hands, one man on fire. [...] "Getting burned" [...] was also a common phrase in the music industry, used often by artists denied royalty payments. [...] Two stuntmen were used (Ronnie Rondell and Danny Rogers), one dressed in a fire-retardant suit covered by a business suit. [...] His head was protected by a hood, underneath a wig. [...] The photograph was taken at the Warner Bros. studios in Los Angeles. [...] Initially the wind was blowing in the wrong direction, and the flames were forced into Rondell's face, burning his moustache. [...] The two stuntmen changed positions, and the image was later reversed.|$|E

2500|$|Surgical {{treatment}} is best, {{when it can}} be performed. [...] Pressure within the portal vein is measured as the shunt is closed, {{and it must be}} kept below 20cm H2O or else portal hypertension will ensue. [...] Methods of shunt attenuation should aim to slowly occlude the vessel over several weeks to months in order to avoid complications associated with portal hypertension. These methods include ameroid ring constrictors, <b>cellophane</b> banding, intravascular or percutaneous silicone hydraulic occluders. The most common methods of attenuation used by veterinarians are ameroid ring constrictors and <b>cellophane</b> banding. Both methods have reportedly good outcomes in both cats and dogs, although the true composition of readily sourced <b>cellophane</b> {{has been found to be}} made from plastics (inert) and not cellulose (stimulates a fibrous reaction). Recently, a commercial supplier of regenerated cellulose based <b>cellophane</b> for veterinarians has been established for use of [...] Complete closure of extrahepatic shunts results in a very low recurrence rate, while incomplete closure results in a recurrence rate of about 50 percent. [...] However, not all dogs with extrahepatic shunts tolerate complete closure (16 to 68 percent). [...] Intrahepatic shunts are much more difficult to surgically correct than extrahepatic shunts due to their hidden nature, large vessel size, and greater tendency toward portal hypertension when completely closed. [...] When surgery is not an option, PSS is treated as are other forms of liver failure. [...] Dietary protein restriction is helpful to lessen signs of hepatic encephalopathy, and antibiotics such as neomycin or metronidazole and other medicines such as lactulose can reduce ammonia production and absorption in the intestines. [...] The prognosis is guarded for any form of PSS.|$|E
