5|$|The AV-8B Harrier II is a subsonic attack {{aircraft}} {{of metal}} and <b>composite</b> <b>construction</b> that retains the basic layout of the Hawker Siddeley Harrier, with horizontal stabilizers and shoulder-mounted wings featuring prominent anhedral (downward slope). The aircraft {{is powered by a}} single Rolls-Royce Pegasus turbofan engine, which has two intakes and four synchronized vectorable nozzles close to its turbine. Two of these nozzles are located near the forward, cold end of the engine and two are near the rear, hot end of the engine. This arrangement contrasts with most fixed-wing aircraft, which have engine nozzles only at the rear. The Harrier II also has smaller valve-controlled nozzles in the nose, tail, and wingtips to provide control at low airspeeds.|$|E
5|$|The current Causeway bridges were {{designed}} by E W C Godfrey, and built between 1947 and 1952. They were the first in Western Australia to use steel <b>composite</b> <b>construction.</b> Large roundabouts were also constructed {{at each end of}} the structure, to improve the flow of traffic. The opening of the Graham Farmer Freeway in 2000 reduced the traffic volume on the Causeway, allowing the two central lanes to be turned into bus lanes. By the early 2000s, the concrete structures had suffered significant damage. Cracks were repaired using carbon fibre reinforcement and localised patching, extending the bridge's life by decades. The Causeway bridges have been recognised for their heritage value by their entry on the Western Australian Register of Heritage Places.|$|E
5|$|Tensions between Japan and China {{heightened}} {{after the}} former launched its punitive expedition against Taiwan in May 1874 in retaliation {{of the murder}} of a number of shipwrecked sailors by the Paiwan aborigines. China inquired into the possibility of buying ironclad warships from Great Britain and Japan was already negotiating with the Brazilian government about the purchase of the ironclad Independencia then under construction in Britain. The Japanese terminated the negotiations with the Brazilians in October after the ship was badly damaged upon launching and the expeditionary force was about to withdraw from Taiwan. The crisis illustrated the need to reinforce the IJN and a budget request was submitted that same month by Acting Navy Minister Kawamura Sumiyoshi for ¥3.9–4.2 million to purchase three warships from abroad. No Japanese shipyard was able to build ships of this size so they were ordered from Great Britain. This was rejected as too expensive and a revised request of ¥2.3 million was approved later that month. Nothing was done until March 1875 when Kawamura proposed to buy one ironclad for half of the money authorized and use the rest for shipbuilding and gun production at the Yokosuka Shipyard. No response was made by the Prime Minister's office before the proposal was revised to use all of the allocated money to buy three ships, one armored frigate and two armored corvettes of <b>composite</b> <b>construction</b> to be designed by the prominent British naval architect Sir Edward Reed, formerly the Chief Constructor of the Royal Navy. Reed would also supervise the construction of the ships for an honorarium of five percent of the construction cost. The Prime Minister's office approved the revised proposal on 2 May and notified the Japanese consul, Ueno Kagenori, that navy officers would be visiting to negotiate the contract with Reed.|$|E
40|$|This article {{shows the}} {{methodology}} of building finite element models of <b>composite</b> <b>constructions</b> made of laminate composites reinforced with carbon fibre fabric (carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer). The models use a repeatable microstructure of a composite – a repeated unit cell – which is a three-dimensional truss built with one-dimensional beam finite elements. Thanks to this fact, the models reflect the internal structure of the composite. The model constants have been experimentally determined. Therefore, the influence of production technology of the composite on its mechanical properties has been considered. The modelling methodology {{has been used to}} calculate deflections of exemplary <b>composite</b> <b>constructions.</b> The results have been experimentally verified...|$|R
