40|$|In {{this paper}} we develop an {{analytical}} framework devoted to compare family size related tax <b>credits</b> and <b>allowances.</b> As a main result, we obtain that, {{in a social}} welfare context à la Atkinson and Bourguignon (1987), if tax <b>credits</b> and <b>allowances</b> are compared in an individual context, it could be assured that a progressive income tax with family size related tax allowances is never welfare superior to an equal-yield income tax involving tax credits. Theoretical results are checked on empirical grounds for the Spanish personal income tax (IRPF) in force in 1999. We develop a micro-simulation exercise, using the Panel of IRPF Returns, which belongs to the Institute of Fiscal Studies. Two results {{can be derived from}} this exercise. Firstly, that, both adopting an individual or household approach, <b>allowances</b> and tax <b>credits</b> are welfare superior to an equal-yield proportional tax. And secondly, that, although a tax credit system reduces global income inequality more than what allowances does, also from an individual or household approach, {{it is not possible to}} determine superiority in welfare terms of a system over the other.

40|$|Despite much recent {{interest}} in a consumption tax, the Treasury Department's November 1984 tax plan proposes to adopt carefully coordinated features of a more comprehensive income tax, including the indexation of interest, depreciation, and capital gains. The May 1985 White House proposal would retain some of these indexing provisions. This paper looks at the incentives under alternative tax regimes to make marginal investments in the corporate sector, noncorporate sector, and in owner-occupied housing. It finds that the current system is characterized by effective tax rates that increase with inflation for some assets and decrease with inflation for other assets. Overall rates fall with inflation, and the corporate tax is completely offset by <b>credits,</b> <b>allowances,</b> and deductions. Under the Treasury or White House plans, the corporate tax re-emerges, effective tax rates are considerably more uniform, and the interference of inflation is virtually eliminated. ...|$|R

By the end of 2010, $2,512,000,000 of property value had been donated as easements in Virginia for which tax credit was claimed. The qualifying easements cover over 516,000 acre of Virginia landscape. [...] The Virginia program now (2011) grants about $110 million of new tax credit each year. The <b>credit</b> <b>allowance</b> is 40% of the appraised value of the easement donation, so this equates to $275 million of property value donated per year for protection of wildlife habitat, farmland and woodland, and scenic open space—in perpetuity. The other state tax credit programs are smaller in dollar measurement, but are very significant {{in the area and}} the conservation values that they cause to be protected.

40|$|Through {{the use of}} a multiserver capability-based ar-chitecture, the GNU Hurd has {{attempted}} to increase security and flexibility relative to traditional Unix-like operating systems. This shift away from a monolithic design requires a reevaluation of conventional operat-ing system praxis to determine its degree of continued applicability. Resource scheduling appears particularly defunct in this regard: to make smarter scheduling deci-sions, monolithic systems cross component boundaries to gain insight into application behavior. This introspec-tion is incompatible with a multiserver architecture and its elimination, as observed in Mach, the current micro-kernel used by the GNU Hurd, results in noticeable per-formance degradation. To this end, I propose that rather than have the operating system provide virtualized re-sources, i. e. schedule the contents of resources on be-half of applications, it offer near raw access to the prin-cipals which they must multiplex as required thereby relieving e. g. the memory manager of paging decisions. The resource managers must still partition the physi-cal resources among the competing principals. For this, I suggest a market based solution in which principals have a periodically renewed <b>credit</b> <b>allowance</b> and lease the required resources.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} data on {{the forest}} resource development in Bulgaria during the 20 th century, as well as contemporary challenges. It is summarized that during the last 14 years, forestry in Bulgaria has passed through numeral structural and economic changes, directed to its adaptation to market economy. The forest industry in the transition to market economy after 1989 overcame the state monopolism but went to the opposite extreme. The weak sides of the forest industry in this period are summarized as: decreasing of the production; insufficiency of quantity and quality raw material for the existing processing capacities; lost markets {{for the production of}} the wood processing industry; problematic <b>credit</b> <b>allowance.</b> The strong sides of the Bulgarian forest industry are the high qualified specialists and the low labor price. The main challenge for sustainable development of economically viable forest sector is implementation of multifunctional forest management. Among the identified new priorities are: restoration of the economic activities in the state-owned forests; comasation of the small forest plots of land; interruption of experiments in the management of the forestry sector. The quantitative criteria for meeting the new challenges by the Bulgarian forest industry is achievement of annual growth of production and export by 10 %. ...|$|E

The study has revealed that time is the economic link between marginal productivity of capital asset and human competence.

The results of the empirical analysis conducted to estimate the competence value and the goodwill for a sample made of more than 3, 000 Italian Companies in the highly competitive Treviso’s District. Empirical evidence has shown that the proposed Intato-T-Ratio is a good proxy of competence value estimation, stronger than the widely diffused Tobin-Q-Ratio. Aborting competence value in <b>credit</b> <b>allowances</b> procedures might have a dramatic impact particularly on SMEs after the adoption of the next Basel- 3 agreement.

40|$|In {{this paper}} reforms of both present Italian {{personal}} income taxation and family allowances are evaluated {{with the aim}} to make the tax benefit system able to better support family burden. Two kind of reforms are considered: family quotient, based on the change of the tax unit from persons to families, and a new generalized family allowance, based on equivalent income and absorbing current family tax <b>credits</b> and <b>allowances.</b> After an evaluation of some limits of family quotient (higher effective marginal tax rate for spouse with lower income and a reduced support for low income families) and the current mix of tax <b>credits</b> and <b>allowances</b> (families with higher equivalent income can receive higher support for family burden), the comparison among two specific reforms is performed using a microsimulation model built on Bank of Italy survey about the Italian household and personal incomes. Results shows {{that it is possible}} to shape quotient family based reforms with redistributive effects, but also that the new generalized family allowance here presented is able to better support bottom quintiles of population, with or without dependent children.

40|$|Any {{attempt to}} model {{monetary}} policy in China {{has to take}} into account two ‘specifics’ of the Chinese monetary policy: the reliance on several operational instruments, both quantitative (open market operations, discount rate, reserve requirement) and qualitative (selective <b>credit</b> <b>allowances,</b> window guidance etc.), as well as the combined strategy pursued by the People’s Bank of China, i. e. the two intermediate targets - the exchange rate and the money growth. In this paper we analyze monetary policy in China using a small, three-equation New Keynesian model, considering these issues as follows: first, the qualitative instruments are estimated by using the Kalman filter, as no data on them exist. Then, a monetary-policy index is created as a weighted average of the quantitative and the qualitative instruments, which is in turn included in the model instead of the interest rate. Finally, the two intermediate targets (monetary growth and exchange rate) are included in the monetary-policy rule. Our results suggest that monetary authorities in China consider stabilizing inflation and output gap when making their decisions. Intermediate targets, in particular the growth of the monetary aggregates, appear to be important determinants of the monetary-policy behaviour, implying that their omission might be a serious drawback of any analysis. We also find that omitting the qualitative instruments can lead to wrong conclusions about monetary-policy conduct. ...|$|R

40|$|As Southeast European {{countries}} have {{become much more}} attractive for foreign investors since 2000, this paper analyses factors that have influenced FDI inflows in these economies. There is a broad consensus that, regardless {{of the type of}} FDI, the most important FDI determinants include market size, prospects for market growth, the degree of development of host countries and the progress made in the process of transition, especially progress in institutional development. Still, the specific FDI determinant in SEECs has been the privatization process, especially that of large-scale state assets. The assessment of the impact of tax incentives on FDI is evolving - showing increasing evidence that tax incentives in their broadest sense could {{have a significant impact on}} the pattern of regional FDI. The effects of incentives are likely to be particularly strong in the competition for FDI within regions, when the initial investment decision has been taken and the investor is choosing between alternative locations in a given region. In such circumstances, taxes will start to play an important role, especially corporate income tax. Its tax rate is of crucial importance and will play a major role in attracting investment. Accelerated depreciation and tax <b>credits</b> (<b>allowances)</b> for investment are even more cost efficient and could be seen as a good supplement to the former major factor.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the impact and {{the appropriateness of}} tax incentives for {{small and medium-sized enterprises}} (SMEs) in the European Union. First, we provide a survey of implemented tax incentives specifically targeted at SMEs in the 28 EU Member States. Building hereon, we measure the impact of these regimes on the effective tax burdens of targeted companies. We find that SME tax incentives are a commonly used measure among European policy makers. The vast majority of regimes, however, only marginally reduce the tax liability of SMEs. If major reliefs are available, they mostly stem from special tax rates whereas tax <b>credits</b> and special <b>allowance</b> play a minor role. In the second main part of the analysis, we examine the arguments potentially justifying the usage of SME tax incentives. As a main result, small firms per se do not create more jobs and innovations nor do they face insurmountable financing constraints. The existence of market failures commonly associated with SMEs – and possibly warranting the use of SME tax incentives – can therefore not be confirmed. Instead, disproportionate tax compliance costs for small entities constitute the most compelling argument for a special tax treatment. These compliance costs can most appropriately be addressed by administrative reliefs. Special tax rates, tax <b>credits</b> and <b>allowances,</b> in contrast, are not only inefficient but also ineffective in this regard. Instead of improving the neutrality of the overall tax system, the latter are likely to add further distortions and unnecessary complexity. Altogether, the focus of policy - makers should thus shift from providing discriminatory incentives to the design of a generally neutral and simple tax system, which would benefit small as well as large enterprises...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The New Basel Capital Accord (Basel II) was {{published}} in June 2004. This modification of the regulatory framework for banking institutions raises the question to what extent real estate financing will be impacted and how market participants can be adequately prepared. Aims to {{examine the impact of}} Basel II on the future pricing and availability of debt capital and on the cost of capital in real estate financing and to present possible reactions for real estate developers. Design/methodology/approach – This research paper follows a deductive approach. First, the New Basel Capital Accord and the main features of commercial real estate financing are presented. On a normative level, the implications for developers are explained. Since no information regarding the behaviour of market participants in commercial real estate financing was available, the authors have ascertained the relevant questions within the framework of an empirical analysis. A total of 205 banking institutions were asked to fill out a survey pertaining to commercial real estate financing. The results of this survey are partly presented and interpreted. Findings – The availability and the pricing of debt capital will be risk-adjusted and will depend on the amount of regulatory equity banks will have to hold in reserve for a credit engagement. The cost of debt capital in real estate financing will rise due to systemic reasons of the New Basel Capital Accord. Banks are/will be very restrictive with regard to <b>credit</b> <b>allowances.</b> The use of the positive leverage effect will become more difficult. Structured financing, particularly the use of private equity, {{is the best way to}} fill a potential financing gap. Originality/value – The paper is a timely investigation of a significant regulatory framework that is of world-wide significance. The New Basel Capital Accord is introduced in its fundamental structure and the two relevant rating approaches are described and put into context. The paper reduces the complexity of the comprehensive and sophisticated Basel Capital Accord. Based on the facts that have been analysed, recommendations of how real estate developers can react to the changes in financing that lie ahead are given...|$|R
