40|$|Optimizing the {{operating}} parameters to minimize polychlorodibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorodibenzofurans (PCDD/F) emission {{is the common}} interest of the municipal solid waste (MSW) incineration industry. In this study, we investigated the distribution of tetra- to octa-CDD/F along the flue gas line in a full-scale reciprocating grate incinerator and evaluated the effects of temperature control and O- 2 level on PCDD/F formation. Six runs were laid out and all performed under sufficient burning conditions, in which the combustion efficiency of MSW was more than 99. 9 %. The total concentration of tetra- to octa-CDD/F measured at the boiler outlet showed an increasing tendency {{with the increase of}} boiler outlet temperature (TB) from 214 degrees C to 264 degrees C. When flue gas ran across the semi-dry scrubber and <b>cyclone</b> <b>precipitator,</b> in which the temperature varied from 264 degrees C to 162 degrees C, the concentrations of the lower chlorinated dioxins and furans were significantly raised, especially for the TCDF. Increasing 02 supply from 6. 0 % to 10. 5 % essentially led to a higher yield of tetra- to octa-PCDD/F, suggested that under sufficient burning conditions the lower O- 2 level was favorable for reducing PCDD/F formation and emission. The variation of O- 2 level did not give rise to a systematical change of PCDD/F homologue pattern. For all measurements, the isomer distributions of tetra- to hepta-PCDD/F were more or less the same, nearly independent of variations in {{the operating}} conditions and sampling positions. Only the significant increase of the sum of 1, 3, 7, 8 -TCDF and 1, 3, 7, 9 -TCDF was found in the zone after the boiler section. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT:The {{removal of}} fine {{particles}} less than 2. 5 µm in diameter generated from industrial plants represents {{a serious challenge}} in air pollution abatement. These particles can penetrate deeply into the lungs and are difficult to remove by <b>cyclones,</b> electrostatic <b>precipitators,</b> and other conventional separation devices. In this paper, the influence of acoustic waves on removing aerosol particles from gas flue is studied. The mechanism of this effect includes the coagulation of nanometer particles {{to each other and}} forms larger particles. Moreover,these particles adhere to the wall of the test-rig pipe by the acoustic precipitation mechanism. Therefore, the particles are separated from the gas flue. Experiments are carried out on particle sized in the range of 260 - 3000 nm. Micro-sphere particles immersed in the air are subjected to homogeneous plane standing-waves at frequencies ranging from 100 Hz up to 2 kHz and a pressure level of 120 to 150 dB. At high pressure levels,the results indicate that the system has high efficiency for removing fine particles...|$|R
40|$|International audienceDue to the {{incomplete}} mineralisation of some {{organic compounds}} during the incineration of municipal solid waste, gaseous emissions {{are loaded with}} {{a large amount of}} particulate matter, undesirable elements and toxic molecules. Typically, an incinerator of urban solid waste produces large flows of hot gaseous emissions to be purified before being released into the atmosphere. In this paper, treatments of flue gas from a typical municipal waste incinerator are described. The first step is an energy recovery system through heat exchangers to make steam or hot water. Steam is used to produce electricity via a turbine. The economic balance of the total system is very often dependent on the heat recovery. The second step involves particle removal technologies. Different systems are available such as <b>cyclones,</b> scrubbers, electrostatic <b>precipitators</b> or baghouse filters. The third step is the removal of numerous molecule families such as acid compounds (SOx, HCl, HF), nitrogen oxides (NOx), metal species and many organic compounds. The latter include dioxins, furans and volatile organic compounds. Some treatment processes are described according to the pollutant family...|$|R
40|$|This master thesis in Industrial Ecology {{has been}} carried out at Royal Institute of Technology, KTH, in {{cooperation}} with Swedish Environmental Research Institute, IVL andShandong University. It discusses the air pollution control techniques in calcium carbidemanufacturing by studying Inner Mongolia Haiji Chlor-Alkali Chemical Co. Ltd’s plants inWuhai, Inner Mongolia, China. China’s environmental situation is discussed and its severe state is found to be similar to the western world in the last century. One of the main reasons for the air pollution problems arethe coal based industries in cities like Wuhai. Calcium carbide is a chemical based on coaland limestone which in China is mainly used for PVC plastics production. The emission from the carbide production is mainly particulate matter. This is suggested to be controlled by adding <b>cyclone</b> and electrostatic <b>precipitator</b> as treatment for the waste gas. Investments in particulate matter control will be at least a few million SEK (similar in RMB),but the waste, both the solid and the gas, can be used in other processes, namely cementproduction, heat exchanging and as fuel. By investing in equipment to use this waste and sell the energy, it is expected that close to ten million RMB 1 can be earned annually, meaning that the particulate matter control investment will pay off quickly. The Fischer-Tropschmethod for producing synthetic diesel from carbon monoxide and hydrogen gas provides another opportunity to use the waste gas. www. ima. kth. s...|$|R
