5|$|Maintenance problems. The {{chain-driven}} {{valve gear}} {{proved to be}} expensive to maintain and subject to rapid wear. Leaks from the oil bath onto the wheels caused oil to splash onto the boiler lagging. Once saturated with oil, the lagging attracted coal dust and ash, which provided <b>combustible</b> <b>material,</b> and sparks from heavy braking would set the lagging on fire underneath the air-smoothed casing. The fires were also attributed to oil overflowing from axlebox lubricators onto the wheels when stationary, to be flung upwards into the boiler lagging in service. In either case, the local fire brigade would be called to put the fire out, with cold water coming {{into contact with the}} hot boiler causing stress to the casings. Many photographs show an un-rebuilt locomotive with warped casings, the result of a lagging fire.|$|E

25|$|A steam {{locomotive}} {{is a type}} of railway locomotive that produces its pulling power through a steam engine. These locomotives are fueled by burning <b>combustible</b> <b>material</b> – usually coal, wood, or oil – to produce steam in a boiler. The steam moves reciprocating pistons which are mechanically connected to the locomotive's main wheels (drivers). Both fuel and water supplies are carried with the locomotive, either on the locomotive itself or in wagons (tenders) pulled behind.|$|E
25|$|In {{a report}} from 1967, {{techniques}} included various methods of applying liquid nitrogen, dry ice, and water to nuclear-caused fires. The report considered attempting {{to stop the spread}} of fires by creating firebreaks by blasting <b>combustible</b> <b>material</b> out of an area, possibly even using nuclear weapons, along with the use of preventative Hazard Reduction Burns. According to the report, one of the most promising techniques investigated was initiation of rain from seeding of mass-fire thunderheads and other clouds passing over the developing, and then stable, firestorm.|$|E

25|$|While {{there was}} much {{criticism}} {{of the lack of}} fire sprinkler systems, Geoff Wilkinson, the building regulations columnist for the Architects' Journal, wrote on 14 June 2017 that if a gas riser was leaking or the cladding was at fault, sprinklers would have had little effect. He also said that reports of <b>combustible</b> <b>material</b> stored in the common walkways suggested poor overall management. David Siber, an advisor to the Fire Brigades Union, said sprinklers would have prevented the fire, if it started in a kitchen, from ever spreading beyond that room.|$|E
25|$|On {{the second}} day of the siege, early at dawn, Muttawmp had his men fill a village wagon with <b>combustible</b> <b>material</b> and direct it at the {{fortified}} house, hoping to set it on fire and in that way force the defenders out. However, the plan did not work because of heavy rains which began to pour while the wagon was in preparation. During the confusion that accompanied the execution of the plan, Ephraim Curtis managed to sneak out of the house and made a successful run for the woods. He eventually made it to Marlborough although by that time colonial soldiers had already been alerted by some travelers who had heard gunfire near Brookfield. As a result, a group of men under Major Simon Willard were already on their way to relieve the besieged.|$|E
25|$|Fires {{start when}} a {{inflammable}} or a <b>combustible</b> <b>material,</b> {{in combination with}} a sufficient quantity of an oxidizer such as oxygen gas or another oxygen-rich compound (though non-oxygen oxidizers exist), is exposed to a source of heat or ambient temperature above the flash point for the fuel/oxidizer mix, {{and is able to}} sustain a rate of rapid oxidation that produces a chain reaction. This is commonly called the fire tetrahedron. Fire cannot exist without all of these elements in place and in the right proportions. For example, an inflammable liquid will start burning only if the fuel and oxygen are in the right proportions. Some fuel-oxygen mixes may require a catalyst, a substance that is not consumed, when added, in any chemical reaction during combustion, but which enables the reactants to combust more readily.|$|E

50|$|Building {{regulations}} {{are to be}} reviewed {{in the light of}} Grenfell Tower fire due to a number of concerns. There is concern over fire safety issues with many other buildings. <b>Combustible</b> <b>materials</b> have been found on a range of tall local authority and housing association buildings. <b>Combustible</b> <b>materials</b> on the outside of tall buildings must comply with standards but this has sometimes been interpreted as applying only to the insulation and not the cladding. Fire tests may not accurately reflect real life when a building, cladding and insulation are subject to wear and tear.|$|R
25|$|Over {{the course}} of a season {{creosote}} deposits can become several inches thick. This creates a compounding problem, because the creosote deposits reduce the draft (airflow through the chimney) which increases the probability that the wood fire is not getting enough air for complete combustion. Since creosote is highly combustible, a thick accumulation creates a fire hazard. If a hot fire is built in the stove or fireplace, and the air control left wide open, this may allow hot oxygen into the chimney where it comes in contact with the creosote which then ignites—causing a chimney fire. Chimney fires often spread to the main building because the chimney gets so hot that it ignites any <b>combustible</b> <b>material</b> in direct contact with it, such as wood. The fire can also spread to the main building from sparks emitting from the chimney and landing on combustible roof surfaces. In order to properly maintain chimneys and heaters that burn wood or carbon-based fuels, the creosote buildup must be removed. Chimney sweeps perform this service for a fee.|$|E
25|$|Johnstone's forces {{arrived at}} the Cape, where he sent HMS Active ahead to reconnoitre. Active found a Dutch merchant, the Held Woltemande, which had {{recently}} departed the Cape, and after fooling her into thinking Active was a French frigate, captured her. From her Johnstone learnt that Suffren's forces had already reinforced the Cape, and that an attack would be futile. However he also learnt that a small convoy of richly laden Dutch merchants had been moved {{to the safety of}} Saldanha Bay. Johnstone decided to capture them, and on the morning of 21 July, arrived off the entrance to the bay. The Dutch squadron consisted of the Dankbaarheid, Perel, Schoonkop, Hoogscarspel and Middleburg, under the command of Captain Gerrit Harmeyer of the Hoogscarspel. Their stores and equipment had been stored on the packets Zon and Snelheid, which were sent further into the bay, near to Schapen Island. They had been given orders to burn their ships if attacked, while even if they were captured, the loss of their equipment on the Zon and Snelheid would make them useless. However the Dutch were largely unprepared, and only on the Middleburg had stores of <b>combustible</b> <b>material</b> been prepared. They cut their anchor cables and ran onshore, where their crews set fire to them, but the British were able to board them in their boats and extinguished the fires on all but the Middleburg, to which Johnstone personally attached a line to, repeating the success of his youth, and had towed away from the remaining Dutch ships. The five ships fell into British hands, as did the two packets, which were captured without any attempt being made to destroy them. After equipping his ships, Johnstone left the bay with his prizes, leaving only the Zon and Snelheid, which were considered too old to be of any use.|$|E

500|$|Specific {{weapons from}} the ancient and medieval periods {{continued}} to develop, and many have [...] modern equivalents. [...] Rocket technology, originally trialled by the Mongols, Indians and the Chinese, amongst others, was improved by the 19th century; one example was the incendiary Congreve rocket, which had a tail, a fuse, and a powder charge (saltpetre, sulfur and carbon) inside a hollow shell. Grenades continued to develop, although still retaining some aspects of their medieval equivalents. [...] The grenades carried on board British Royal Navy ships in the late 18th century and early 19th century were constructed from hollow cast iron, filled with gunpowder; the fuse was a hollow wooden tube filled with <b>combustible</b> <b>material.</b> [...] During World War I, grenades were still occasionally launched by ballistae.|$|E
2500|$|The drill {{offers an}} ancient method of {{starting}} fire without matches or a lighter, {{a method that}} applies friction to generate heat.

2500|$|Combustion {{consists}} of various radical chain reactions that the singlet radical can initiate. The flammability {{of a given}} material strongly depends on the concentration of free radicals that must be obtained before initiation and propagation reactions dominate leading to combustion of the material. Once the <b>combustible</b> <b>material</b> has been consumed, termination reactions again dominate and the flame dies out. [...] As indicated, [...] promotion of propagation or termination reactions alters flammability. [...] For example, because lead itself deactivates free radicals in the gasoline-air mixture, tetraethyl lead was once commonly added to gasoline. This prevents the combustion from initiating in an uncontrolled manner or in unburnt residues (engine knocking) or premature ignition (preignition).|$|E
2500|$|Most {{municipalities}} {{that operate}} incineration facilities have higher recycling rates than neighboring {{cities and counties}} that do not send their waste to incinerators.. In a country overview from 2016 [...] by the European Environmental Agency the top recycling performing countries are also the ones having the highest penetration of incineration, even though all material recovery from waste sent to incineration (e.g. metals and construction aggregate) is per definition not counted as recycling in European targets. [...] The recovery of glass, stone and ceramic materials reused in construction, as well as ferrous {{and in some cases}} non-ferrous metals recovered from combustion residue thus adds further to the actual recycled amounts. Metals recovered from ash would typically be difficult or impossible to recycle through conventional means, as the removal of attached <b>combustible</b> <b>material</b> through incineration provides an alternative to labor- or energy-intensive mechanical separation methods.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} of this work is to quantitatively study the combustion characteristics and dynamic smoke properties by using cone calorimeter at different external heat flux. The relationship between heat release rate (HRR) and smoke production rate (SPR) of four decorative materials is investigated. The {{results show that the}} external heat flux levels and material compositions significant influence the HRR and SPR, indicating noncombustible materials of flame retarded chipboard (FRCB) and gypsum board (GPB) own the lower HRR and SPR compared to <b>combustible</b> <b>materials</b> of medium density fiberboard (MDFB) and melamine faced chipboard (MFCB). It is suggested that the peak SPR is linearly related to peak HRR for four decorative materials which the correlation coefficients are all above 0. 94. When the decorative material is noncombustible, a negative linear relationship exists between peak SPR and peak HRR for GPB and FRCB. However, a positive linear relationship appears to <b>combustible</b> <b>materials</b> for FRCB and MDFB. This correlation demonstrates two different tendencies between SPR and HRR for noncombustible and <b>combustible</b> <b>materials,</b> contributing to understand the fire risk of decorative materials...|$|R
