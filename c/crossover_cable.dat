500|$|The first missile was radar-controlled and {{proximity}} fuzed, and detonated [...] {{behind the}} aircraft. Sending fragments forward, it either severed or unraveled the <b>crossover</b> <b>cable</b> {{from the left}} inboard elevator to the right elevator. This, with damage {{to one of the}} four hydraulic systems, caused KAL007 to ascend from , at which point the autopilot was disengaged.|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of the attack, the plane had been {{cruising}} at an altitude of about [...] Tapes recovered from the airliner's cockpit voice recorder indicate that the crew were unaware that they were off course and violating Soviet airspace. Immediately after missile detonation, the airliner began a 113-second arc upward because of a damaged <b>crossover</b> <b>cable</b> between the left inboard and right outboard elevators.|$|E
50|$|A {{well-known}} <b>crossover</b> <b>cable</b> is the Ethernet <b>crossover</b> <b>cable,</b> which converts between T568A and T568B termination.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{connection}} standards {{use different}} balanced pairs to transmit data, so <b>crossover</b> <b>cables</b> for them have different configurations to swap the transmit and receive pairs: ...|$|R
5000|$|... {{shielded}} or unshielded Cat5, Cat5e, Cat6 or Cat6A cables using 8P8C (RJ-45) modular connectors with straight-through T568A or T568B wiring (modular cables {{wired to}} T568A {{at one end}} and T568B on the other are more commonly referred to as <b>crossover</b> <b>cables)</b> ...|$|R
50|$|Introduced in 1998, {{this made}} the {{distinction}} between uplink and normal ports and manual selector switches on older hubs and switches obsolete. If {{one or both of}} two connected devices has the automatic MDI/MDI-X configuration feature, {{there is no need for}} <b>crossover</b> <b>cables.</b>|$|R
50|$|When two devices, {{that are}} both DTE or both DCE, must be {{connected}} together without a modem or a similar media translator between them, a <b>crossover</b> <b>cable</b> must be used, e.g. a null modem for RS-232 or an Ethernet <b>crossover</b> <b>cable.</b>|$|E

50|$|Automatic MDI/MDI-X Configuration is {{specified}} as {{an optional}} {{feature in the}} 1000BASE-T standard, meaning that straight-through cables will often work between gigabit-capable interfaces. This feature {{eliminates the need for}} <b>crossover</b> <b>cables,</b> making obsolete the uplink/normal ports and manual selector switches found on many older hubs and switches and greatly reduces installation errors.|$|R
50|$|Two {{different}} types of devices are assumed on {{each end of the}} interconnecting cable for a case of simply adding DTE to the topology (e.g. to a hub, DCE), which also brings a less trivial case of interconnection of devices of the same type: DTE-DTE or DCE-DCE. Such cases need <b>crossover</b> <b>cables,</b> such as for the Ethernet or null modem for RS-232.|$|R
50|$|Gigabit {{and faster}} Ethernet links over twisted pair cable use all four cable pairs for {{simultaneous}} transmission in both directions. For this reason, {{there are no}} dedicated transmit and receive pairs, and consequently, <b>crossover</b> <b>cables</b> are never required for 1000BASE-T communication. The {{physical medium attachment sublayer}} (PMA) provides identification of each pair and usually continues to work even over cables where the pairs are unusually swapped or crossed.|$|R
50|$|Ethernet {{may also}} be used as a direct computer-to-computer {{communications}} method using an Ethernet <b>crossover</b> <b>cable.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... {{or between}} two devices {{of the same}} type (two DTEs, or two DCEs), {{interconnected}} by a <b>crossover</b> <b>cable.</b>|$|E
50|$|One {{terminal}} may {{be connected}} directly to another {{without the use}} of a switch or hub, but in that case the crossover must be done in the cabling. Since 10BASE-T and 100BASE-TX use pairs 2 and 3, these two pairs must be swapped in the cable. This is a <b>crossover</b> <b>cable.</b> A <b>crossover</b> <b>cable</b> may also be used to connect two hubs or two switches on their upstream ports.|$|E
50|$|Installing a Sercos {{network is}} easy {{and does not}} require {{infrastructure}} components such as switches or hubs. All devices are interconnected by patch or <b>crossover</b> <b>cables</b> up to 100 m in length. The Ethernet ports on the devices are interchangeable {{and can be used}} to connect standard Ethernet devices such as notebook computers to the network. Every Ethernet and IP protocol on Sercos devices can be accessed without interfering with the real-time protocol and without requiring the real-time operation to be activated.|$|R
50|$|In a {{departure}} from both 10BASE-T and 100BASE-TX, 1000BASE-T and faster use all four cable pairs for simultaneous transmission in both directions {{through the use of}} adaptive equalization and a five-level pulse amplitude modulation (PAM-5) technique. For this reason, there are no dedicated transmit and receive pairs, and consequently, <b>crossover</b> <b>cables</b> are never required for 1000BASE-T, 2.5GBASE-T, 5GBASE-T, 10GBASE-T, and 40GBASE-T communication. From 1000BASE-T onwards the physical medium attachment sublayer (PMA) provides identification of each pair and usually continues to work even over cable where the pairs are unusually swapped or crossed.|$|R
50|$|Mode A has two {{alternate}} configurations (MDI and MDI-X), {{using the}} same pairs but with different polarities. In mode A, pins 1 and 2 (pair #2 in T568B wiring) form {{one side of the}} 48 V DC, and pins 3 and 6 (pair #3 in T568B) form the other side. These are the same two pairs used for data transmission in 10BASE-T and 100BASE-TX, allowing the provision of both power and data over only two pairs in such networks. The free polarity allows PoE to accommodate for <b>crossover</b> <b>cables,</b> patch cables and Auto MDI-X.|$|R
50|$|When {{connecting}} two DTE {{devices such}} as a computer and a printer, the Digital BC16E <b>crossover</b> <b>cable</b> is used.|$|E
5000|$|Many modern Ethernet host {{adapters}} can automatically detect another computer {{connected with}} a straight-through cable and then automatically introduce the required crossover, if needed; if neither of the adapters has this capability, then a <b>crossover</b> <b>cable</b> is required. Most newer switches have automatic crossover ("auto MDI-X" [...] or [...] "auto-uplink") on all ports, eliminating the uplink port and the MDI/MDI-X switch, and allowing all connections to be made with straight-through cables. If both devices being connected support 1000BASE-T according to the standards, they will connect regardless of whether a straight-through or <b>crossover</b> <b>cable</b> is used.|$|E
5000|$|Using {{different}} wiring (a given color wire {{connects to}} one number pin at one end, {{and a different}} number pin at the other) at each end yields a <b>crossover</b> <b>cable.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Auto MDI-X {{automatically}} detects {{the required}} cable connection type and configures the connection appropriately, removing {{the need for}} <b>crossover</b> <b>cables</b> to interconnect switches or connecting PCs peer-to-peer. As {{long as it is}} enabled on either end of a link, either type of cable can be used. For auto MDI-X to operate correctly, the data rate on the interface and duplex setting must be set to [...] "auto". Auto MDI-X was developed by Hewlett-Packard engineers Daniel Joseph Dove and Bruce W. Melvin.A pseudo-random number generator decides whether or not a network port will attach its transmitter, or its receiver to each of the twisted pairs used to auto-negotiate the link.|$|R
5000|$|... "Messiah War", a seven-issue <b>crossover</b> between <b>Cable</b> (vol. 2) and X-Force (vol. 3) which writer Craig Kyle {{describes}} {{as being the}} follow-up to Messiah Complex and [...] "the middle chapter of what I think {{will be a major}} three-part saga, which will continue to define and redefine the X-Universe moving forward".|$|R
5000|$|Ultimately Stryfe {{would be}} brought back to life as a time anomaly, having shown {{up out of the}} blue {{alongside}} the Dark Riders during a <b>crossover</b> between <b>Cable</b> and X-Man and would go on to bedevil the X-Men until his most death during the Gambit/Bishop mini-series. Stryfe would yet again return after the [...] "Decimation" [...] storyline and appeared to perish again, although it is unknown if it is a Stryfe from another reality.|$|R
5000|$|A 56K DDS cable uses T568B pairs 02 and 04, so a <b>crossover</b> <b>cable</b> {{for these}} devices swaps those pairs (pins 01, 02, 07, and 08 are {{connected}} to 07, 08, 01, and 02 respectively).|$|E
5000|$|A <b>crossover</b> <b>cable</b> connects {{two devices}} {{of the same}} type, for example DTE-DTE or DCE-DCE, usually {{connected}} asymmetrically (DTE-DCE), by a modified cable called a crosslink. [...] Such distinction of devices was introduced by IBM.|$|E
50|$|Many devices today support Auto MDI-X capability, wherein a {{patch cable}} {{can be used}} in place of a <b>crossover</b> <b>cable,</b> or vice versa, and the receive and {{transmit}} signals are reconfigured automatically to yield the expected result.|$|E
50|$|X-Force {{continued}} with Nicieza writing and Greg Capullo illustrating. Nicieza, who also wrote X-Men, vol. 2, helped plot the X-Cutioner's Song storyline that overlapped into most X-Men related {{books in the}} fall of 1992. In that story, Stryfe frames Cable for an assassination attempt on the X-Men’s founder Professor X, leading to a clash between the X-Men and X-Force. The <b>crossover</b> boosted <b>Cable's</b> popularity, despite the character's apparent death in X-Force #18, leading to his own solo series being launched in 1993.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to use {{electromyography}} to determine which chest exercise(s) elicited the most muscle activation of the pectoralis major muscle. Subjects for this study were 14 males, 19 - 30 years of age. The first day of testing a 1 RM was determined for the exercises: barbell bench press, bent-forward <b>cable</b> <b>crossovers,</b> seated chest press, incline dumbbell flys, and peck deck machine. Parallel dips, push-ups, suspended push-ups, and Swiss ball push-ups were omitted, because body weight was used for resistance. On the second day of testing, subjects performed five repetitions of each exercise, using 80 % of their 1 RM. After each exercise, the subjects were asked their RPE. When analyzing the EMG data, each exercise was compared to the barbell bench press. The analysis showed no significant difference between the peck deck machine, bent-forward <b>cable</b> <b>crossovers,</b> and the barbell bench press. This correlated with the results of the subjects? RPE, except for the inclined dumbbell flys. The remaining exercises elicited significantly lower muscle activation and RPE values. Therefore, it was concluded that the barbell bench press, the peck deck, and bent-forward <b>cable</b> <b>crossovers</b> could be used interchangeably to elicit the greatest muscle activation of the pectoralis major muscle...|$|R
40|$|The {{behavior}} Of Rutherford-type cables under a time-dependent {{magnetic field}} is studied. Existing models are extended describing the currents {{flowing through the}} resistive contacts at the <b>crossovers</b> between the <b>cable</b> strands by considering crossover current distributions which are not uniform along the cable axis. The generalized system of equations are applied to a few cases of practical interest and show that, if not uniform, the crossover current distribution is periodic, with a period equal to the cable pitch length...|$|R
5000|$|A T1 cable uses T568B pairs 1 and 2, so {{to connect}} two T1 CSU/DSU devices {{back-to-back}} requires a <b>crossover</b> <b>cable</b> that swaps these pairs. Specifically, pins 1, 2, 4, and 5 {{are connected to}} 4, 5, 1, and 2 respectively.|$|E
50|$|With 10BASE-T and 100BASE-TX, {{separate}} {{twisted pairs}} {{are used for}} the two directions of communication. Since twisted pair cables are conventionally wired pin to pin {{there are two different}} pinouts used for the medium dependent interface. These are referred to as MDI and MDI-X (medium dependent interface crossover). When connecting an MDI port to an MDI-X port, a straight through cable is used while to connect two MDI ports or two MDI-X ports, a <b>crossover</b> <b>cable</b> must be used. Conventionally, MDI is used on end devices while MDI-X is used on hubs and switches. Some hubs and switches have an MDI port (often switchable) to connect to other hubs or switches without a <b>crossover</b> <b>cable.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Ethernet {{supports}} a direct cable connection between two network interface cards {{by the use}} of a <b>crossover</b> <b>cable</b> or through auto-sensing if supported. Token ring does not inherently support this feature and requires additional software and hardware to operate on a direct cable connection setup.|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Embedded Ethernet {{is nothing}} but a {{microcontroller}} which is able to communicate with the network. This paper implements scheme for Ethernet connectivity between an embedded board (STR 912 FW 44 X) and PC for development of embedded web server. The board has an Ethernet controller (STE 100 P) which is 10 / 100 fast Ethernet 3. 3 V Transceiver. ARM 9 core IC STR 912 FW 44 has Media Access Controller (MAC) / Direct Memory Access (DMA) layer which are used for interfacing with the Ethernet controller IC. Proposed work aims at establishment of connectivity between embedded board and PC using RJ- 45 <b>crossover</b> Ethernet <b>cable.</b> A web page has been displayed successfully on PC. The changes in ADC values have been observed on webpage. Total development is carried out through Keil µVision IDE 4. 23. Development is done using Embedded C language...|$|R
50|$|For most {{optical fiber}} {{variants}} of Ethernet, fibers {{are used in}} pairs with one fiber for each direction. Obviously, the one transmitter needs {{to be connected to}} the other receiver and vice versa. For this, fiber patch cables with duplex connectors are normally configured as crossover as well as the on-premises wiring. Thus, a simple connection with two patch cables at each end and a section of fixed cable in the middle has got three crossovers in total, resulting in a working connection. Patch <b>cable</b> <b>crossovers</b> can usually be reconfigured very easily by swapping the connectors within a duplex bracket if required.|$|R
50|$|The above {{variation}} is most difficult when the muscle is maximally contracted, and allows both arms {{to be worked}} out at once. To emphasize the contraction in a stretched position using a weight, the arms must be worked unilaterally. The exerciser rotates the side he is working toward the ceiling and lies on the opposite side. The resistance meets its peak when the humerus is parallel with the ground. To attain a similar effect, it is common to use a <b>cable</b> <b>crossover</b> variation to the rear lateral raise, which allows the angle to be done on both sides simultaneously and without lying on one's side, which can be uncomfortable for some people.|$|R
