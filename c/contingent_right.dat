Despite the last codicil, Mrs Morrell's son gave Adams the Rolls-Royce which was 19 years old, and the chest of silver cutlery. After Mrs Morrell's death, he also took away an infrared lamp she had bought herself, worth £60. Adams billed Morrell's estate for 1,100 visits, costing £1,674 in total. The police estimated that Adams had visited Morrell a total of 321 times during her treatment. On her cremation form, Adams stated that [...] "as far as I am aware" [...] he had no pecuniary interest in the death, thereby avoiding the necessity of a post-mortem.|$|E

The fact that the right may in time turn out to be worth little, or less than the parties anticipated, does not detract from this proposition; the requirement that the object of a cession be certain did not mean that the money value of the ceded right had to be precisely calculable when the transfer of that right occurred.

50|$|The {{most common}} form of {{condition}} found in wills is “if A survives B” (B being some specified or determinable person). The effect of an interest being left conditionally is that it vests, dies cedit, only when the condition has been fulfilled. Prior to the fulfilment of the condition, there has been no dies cedit (or dies venit), and the beneficiary acquires merely a <b>contingent</b> <b>right</b> to the benefit. Suppose, then, that the testator leaves “R1,000 to my son if and when he attains the age of 21.” Upon the death of the testator, and if the son is alive but under twenty-one, he acquires no vested interest. Consequently, if he dies before reaching that age, nothing is transmissible to his heirs. If, however, he attains the age of 21 dies cedit, and the legacy thereupon vests in him. The same principles are applicable where an interest is left “to Armand and upon his death after the testator to Lara.” Lara acquires a vested interest only if she survives both the testator and Armand.|$|E

Until the condition is fulfilled, however, the obligation is neither enforceable nor capable of being performed. The better view is that the nature of the contract is unaffected by the condition.

50|$|With the {{establishment}} of the Salic law in France, the male-line descendants of the third race of the Kings of France were recognized as princes of the blood, who had the <b>contingent</b> <b>right</b> of succession to the French crown. Though the House of Courtenay multiplied, they did so in obscurity and poverty. From princes they became barons, and from barons they became rural lords. Compared to the mighty princes of the blood — the dukes of Burgundy, Brittany, Orléans, Anjou, Bourbon, and Alençon — the royal blood seemed like a drop in the lords of Champignelles and Tanlay. Their name had largely disappeared {{in the history of the}} kingdom, but might still be found by the patience and diligence of heralds and genealogists. In the 16th century, the accession of the House of Bourbon, itself distantly related to the preceding House of Valois, awoke the princely spirit of the Courtenays. They appealed to the justice and compassion of Henry IV of France; they obtained a favorable opinion of 20 lawyers from Italy and Germany, and compared themselves to the descendants of King David, whose rights were not impaired by the lapse of ages or the trade of a carpenter. But every ear was deaf, and every circumstance was adverse, to their lawful claims. The princes of the blood, more recent and lofty, disdained the alliance of this humble kindred. The parliament, without denying their proofs, eluded them by arbitrarily selecting St. Louis as the progenitor of the royal line. A repetition of complaints and protests was repeatedly disregarded; and the hopeless pursuit was terminated in the 18th century by the death of the last male of the family.|$|E

Terms such as ‘protection space’ and ‘humanitarian space’ are critiqued, so as to shift focus away from static notions of place and territoriality, and onto the dynamics of disenfranchisement and processes of exercising human rights. I conclude that barriers to accessing rights are exacerbated by the policies and institutional structures of international human rights actors, but that solutions are ultimately political and inter-personal, and hinge upon Myanmar’s navigation of its potential new role as an opening democracy, conditioned as it is by the exclusionary inclusion of the nation-state paradigm...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} design of the control rights and the {{maturity}} of securities when management has the ability to divert or manipulate the cash flows, and when it is prohibitively costly for a third party, such as court, to verify or prove any managerial wrongdoing. By endogenizing claim structures, control rights and maturity, I derive a diverse set of optimal contracts. Debt with a maturity shorter than the life of the assets is sustainable when investors have the <b>contingent</b> <b>right</b> to liquidate the firm's assets. Long-term debt can be sustained by investors' right to dismiss management and take over the firm as a going-concern {{in the event of a}} default. Investors are willing to hold indefinite life equity if they are granted either the unconditional right to liquidate firm's assets or the unconditional right to dismiss management. Finally, convertible debt can be sustained by investors' right to dismiss management and take over the firm in the event of default by the holder's option to convert their debt contract to an equity contract prior to its expiration date. Consistent with empirical evidence, this model predicts that small entrepreneurial firms use short term bank loans, convertible debt, or outside equity at their initial financing stage; as they show evidence of higher profitability, they can secure longer-term financing. ...|$|E
40|$|Gisbertus Voetius was {{the first}} rector and 'primarius theologiae professor' of Utrecht University in its {{beginning}} years. Although he is {{regarded as one of}} the most important and influential Reformed theologians of the 17 th century, his extensive oeuvre, which predominantly resulted from active disputations practiced at young Utrecht University, remains largely unexplored. This first monograph on Voetius' dogmatic disputations analyses his concept of theology and his doctrine of God. The volume is composed of three parts. The first part describes Voetius' life and work within the context of the early modern period in Europe, thereby giving special attention to the conflict with Cartesianism and to Voetius as an important central figure of the major Dutch religious movement of his age (the 'Nadere Reformatie'). The concept of theology of Voetius is worked out in the second part. For him natural theology is in an objective sense based on divine revelation and does not form the 'artium' of supernatural theology, nor is it 'praeambula fidei' in an epistemic sense. Instead Voetius follows the medieval tradition of 'fides quaerens intellectum'. Moreover, according to its genus theology is a practical science (cf. Duns Scotus). His concept of theology is certainly neither intellectualistic nor rationalistic. Analysis of the doctrine of God of Voetius forms the core of this study in the third part. It is argued that Voetius embraces the doctrine of divine simplicity while at the same time recognizing that the divine attributes are distinct and can be grouped into two classes: regulative attributes (unity; perfection; infinity; immutability) and operative attributes (knowledge; will; right and righteousness; power). Moreover, like Duns Scotus, Voetius discerns both a contingent and a necessary dimension within the divine attributes. In this way, the role of the free and contingent divine will is pivotal: God's necessary knowledge of possible states of affairs precedes his contingent will, whereas his free and contingent knowledge of contingent states of affairs follows his will. In a similar vein, the divine will forms the axis of the distinctions between God's necessary and <b>contingent</b> <b>right</b> and his absolute and ordinate power. Thus God's necessary being can have a contingent relationship to his contingent creation while the extremes of necessitarianism and voluntarism (in the strong sense) are avoided. Moreover, Voetius rejects the Jesuit concept of 'middle knowledge' as being superfluous, dangerous and, surprisingly, as imposing necessity on God and thus on man. He argues instead that God's contingent will and decree do not necessitate human will but rather allow for its inalienable formal freedom. These findings not only confirm but also advance results of recent research on Reformed Orthodoxy (Richard A. Muller, Willem van Asselt, Antonie Vos). At the same time they falsify, with regard to one of the most outstanding figures of Reformed Scholasticism, Alexander Schweizer's thesis that the doctrine of God of these theologians has to be interpreted in terms of necessitarian determinism...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (LL. M. (Estate Law)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2004. Estate Planning is {{influenced}} by various factors, such as: * The preferences {{and needs of the}} estate owner and his relatives. * Economic realities that may force the estate owner to adopt certain measures. * Government and the legal system are influential on the estate owner's options. * Family members and friends are often involved in an estate owner's estate planning. It is against this background that the following hypothesis is considered: S marries out of community of property to G whilst she is an unrehabilitated insolvent. G drafts a will with the following clause in order to protect his property and S from her creditors: I bequeath my entire estate to my spouse on the condition that should she be an unrehabilitated insolvent at my demise, I bequeath my entire estate to my administrators in trust until such time that she is rehabilitated. G passes away while S is still an unrehabilitated insolvent. The question arises if an insolvent heir {{is in a position to}} repudiate an inheritance, as the repudiation will result therein that the inheritance will not form part of the assets in the insolvent's estate. The aim of this study is twofold. The legal position of the testator, the heir and creditors will firstly be analysed critically. Thereafter the possible measures available to a testator, which will ensure that he will be able to satisfy the needs of his heirs, will be highlighted. In order to attain the aims of the study, focus is placed on the following aspects: * Freedom of testation: Although a testator has freedom of testation, this right is not absolute. Care should therefore be taken that due consideration be given to the limitations on his freedom of testation, be it statutory or by common law. * Vesting of rights: The nature of the right acquired by an heir on the death of the testator has been the object of much debate in South African case law. The conflicting views revolve around the question whether any right is acquired and if so whether such right can only be qualified as a <b>contingent</b> <b>right.</b> It is suggested that the correct position is that an heir does require a right to an inheritance, but that the nature of the right is contingent. * Conditions and terms: The testator is able to postpone dies cedit andlor dies venit. He achieves this by imposing conditions on his bequests or by fixing terms. Conditions and terms may be suspensive or resolusive. The resolusive condition and term result therein that rights which have been acquired fall away with retrospective effect. The nudum praeceprum, as a veiled resolusive condition, has no legal force and should be avoided at all costs by the testator. * Adiation and repudiation: Although no person can be forced to accept an inheritance, it is trite law that adiation is automatic unless the bequest is subject to a modus. Furthermore it is also accepted that adiation is not a prerequisite for the vesting of rights. * Legislation and case law: The relevant provisions of the Insolvency Act 24 of 1936 are sections 2, 20 and 26. Section 2 defines property as, inter alia, contingent interests in property, with the exclusion of the contingent interests of fideicommissary heir or legatee. Furthermore disposition is defined inter alia as an abandonment of rights to property. The effect of section 20 is that an insolvent is divested of his estate on the granting of a sequestration order, whereafter the estate will vest in the trustee. Disposition without value may be set aside on application in terms of section 26. It is submitted that the provisions of the Insolvency Act 24 of 1936 are wide enough to cover the repudiation of an inheritance by an insolvent heir. Accordingly such repudiation should therefore be a disposition without value which may be set aside. South African courts had the opportunity on numerous occasions to decide whether an inheritance falls in an insolvent's estate or not. Conflicting judgments were put to a rest by the judgment of the Supreme Court of Appeal in Wessels v De Jager 2000 4 SA 924. The court decided that an heir does not have a right to adiate or repudiate an inheritance. The heir merely exercises an ability to dispose of the inheritance and as such the provisions of the Insolvency Act 24 of 1936 have no application. The decision of the court is unsatisfactory for a number of reasons, but will stand as the law of the land until similar facts are decided but the Supreme Court of Appeal or until the legislator intervenes. The South African Law Commission in consultation with various parties have proposed a draft Insolvency Act. The proposed amendments of value for this study are that contingent interest of fideicommissary heirs and legatees will no longer be excluded from the definition of property and that the court will be endowed with a discretion to decide if an insolvent acted to the detriment of creditors. When the position of S in the hypothesis is analysed it may be concluded that the bequest is subject to a nudum praeceptum and the resolusive condition should be disregarded. In line with the decision in Wessels v De Jager 2000 SA 934 (SCA), S will be able to repudiate the inheritance. This course of action is unsatisfactory in that the aims of the testator are frustrated, S derives no benefit from her action and similarly creditors are denied the benefit of an additional asset in the insolvent estate. Alternative estate planning measures are available to the testator. The trust, be it a testamentary discretionary trust or a trust inter vivos, is preferable to a fideicommissum. The matrimonial property regime adopted by spouses before marriage can also have a positive influence on estate planning. In conclusion it is submitted that intervention by the legislator is required to attain a balance between the rights of the testator, insolvent heirs and creditors. Through estate planning-methods it will be within the power of the testator to avoid conflicting interests of the testator, the insolvent heir and creditors. Master...|$|E
