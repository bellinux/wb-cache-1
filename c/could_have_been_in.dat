5|$|In {{contrast}} to Matheson's {{opinion about the}} name Ljótr, the 20th-century historian A. Morrison was {{of the opinion that}} the name may not be as rare as some people have thought. Morrison noted that the 19th century antiquary F.W.L. Thomas considered another saga character to be an eponymous ancestor of the MacLeods—this character was Ljótólfr, who would have lived on Lewis about a century before Leod's time. Morrison considered it possible that Leod's name could have ultimately originated from that of Ljótólfr's; however, while he considered it possible that Ljótólfr could have been an ancestor of Leod, he did not think it <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> the male-line.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} Burnham-on-Sea {{is the history}} of the {{reclamation}} of the Somerset Levels from the River Severn and the Bristol Channel. The Romans were the first peoples to try to reclaim the Somerset levels, and it was their people who were probably the first settlers in the high sand dunes behind the River Parrett. This <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> part to maintain navigational systems, to aid ships entering the River Parrett and what is now Highbridge. When the Romans left, the system of drainage they installed was not maintained, and the areas reverted to become a tidal salt flat during the Anglo Saxon period.|$|E
5|$|Adolf Hitler was {{concerned}} about a Balkan invasion, as the area had {{been the source of}} raw materials for the German war industry, including copper, bauxite, chrome and oil. The Allies knew of Hitler's fears, and they launched Operation Barclay, a deception operation to play upon his concerns and to mislead the Germans into thinking the Balkans were the objective, thereby keeping Sicily less defended than it <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been.</b> <b>In</b> doing so, the deception operation reinforced German strategic thinking about the likely British target. To suggest the eastern Mediterranean was the target, the Allies set up a headquarters in Cairo, Egypt, for a fictional formation, the Twelfth Army, consisting of twelve divisions. Military manoeuvres were conducted in Syria, with numbers inflated by dummy tanks and armoured vehicles to deceive observers. Greek interpreters were recruited and the Allies stockpiled Greek maps and currency. Falsified communications about troop movements were generated from the Twelfth Army headquarters, while the Allied command post in Tunis – which was to be the headquarters of the Sicily invasion – reduced radio traffic by using land-lines wherever possible.|$|E

5|$|The Test started amid {{controversy}} {{following the}} omission of leading England batsman Len Hutton for performing poorly in the previous match. Having largely failedapart from brief periodsto challenge Australia {{in the first two}} Tests, the hosts had made four changes to their team in an attempt to find a combination that could threaten the visitors' supremacy. Australia made their first change for the series, ending the Test career of veteran batsman Bill Brown after two poor matches. England captain Norman Yardley won the toss and elected to bat, but his team were quickly in trouble, with Denis Compton forced from the field after being bloodied in the head by a Ray Lindwall bouncer. At this stage, the hosts were at 33/2 with an injured player, and they batted defensively for a period to try and regroup. Having received treatment, Compton returned with England in difficulty at 119/5 midway through the day and proceeded to score 145 not out, aided by several dropped catches, helping England to recover to 363 all out on the second afternoon. England <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> an even stronger position, but Compton and seamer Alec Bedser were involved in a mix-up, resulting in the latter being run out and ending a 121-run partnership. Lindwall was the most successful bowler, taking 4/99. During the England innings, Australian opener Sid Barnes, who had gained much attention throughout the season for fielding at point-blank range in front of the batsman on strike, was hit in the ribs by a Dick Pollard pull shot and had to be carried from the ground and hospitalised. In reply, Australia batted steadily to be 126/3 {{by the end of the}} second day, but then fell to be 172/6—effectively seven wickets down with Barnes unable to bat after collapsing again—before evading the follow on by reaching 221. Australia scored slowly through the innings, finding the hosts' bowlers difficult to negotiate; Bedser took 4/81 and Pollard 3/53.|$|E

The Surrey bowlers all got wickets - except for Ian Salisbury - but also conceded more than seven runs an over. A Surrey Lions side including three debutants - Stewart Walters, Rory Hamilton-Brown and Jake Dernbach - crumbled {{despite the efforts of}} Mark Ramprakash who made 63, as they were all out for 171.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of that}} investigation, Transit {{considered}} {{whether it}} would have been worthwhile to toll new capacity to assist in funding its construction. This <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> the form of tolling the new lanes along this route, which would have ensured an untolled alternative was available (as legally required), while the tolled new lanes would be far less congested. In mid 2007, Transit indicated that it would not seek a decision on funding the bridge via road tolls before starting work on construction. Auckland Airport had accused Transit of threatening to defer the project if it could not gain backing from the public and local Councils. As the bridge was to be finished for the 2011 Rugby World Cup, further delays would possibly have resulted in the bridge not being completed in time.|$|E
25|$|In the Battle of Liège the Liège fortifications {{fulfilled}} their role, {{stopping the}} German army {{long enough to}} allow the Belgian and French armies to mobilize. The battle revealed shortcomings {{in the performance of}} the forts and in the Belgian strategy. The forts themselves suffered from inherent weakness of construction through poor understanding of concrete technology, as well as overall inadequate protection for the garrison and ammunition stores from heavy-caliber artillery bombardment. Unbreathable air from bombardment, the fort's own gun gases and from human waste compelled the surrender of most of the positions. However, the days-long delay caused by the fortress ring allowed the Belgian, and more importantly, the French armies to complete their mobilizations. Had the Germans captured Liège as they had hoped, by a bold stroke, the German army <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> Paris before France could organize its defence at the First Battle of the Marne.|$|E

25|$|Qi knives: These large knives are {{attributed}} to the State of Qi, and {{are found in the}} Shandong area. They do not appear to have circulated much outside of this area. Although there has been considerable controversy concerning the date of their issue, archaeology shows them to be products of the Warring States period. They are known as Three Character Knives, Four Character Knives and so on, according to the number of characters in their inscriptions. Some consider the three horizontal lines and the mark below on some reverses are part of the inscription. The inscription refers to the establishment of the State of Qi. This <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> 1122 BC, 894 BC, 685 BC, or 386 BC, depending on how one interprets the early histories. The two later dates are the most likely for the introduction of these coins. The alloy of the Three Character Knives contains around 54% copper, 38% lead, and 8% tin. The Four and Five Character Knives contain about 70% copper.|$|E

25|$|Following Triplemanía XX, Silver King, {{who also}} had a past working for CMLL, {{announced}} that he had been behind El Consejo from the beginning, revealing himself as the rudo group's leader. Meanwhile, El Hijo del Perro Aguayo claimed that AAA did not want him as the promotion's top champion and suggested that Héctor Garza <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> cahoots with the promotion, but promised his stable would investigate what happened at the event, before making their decision about Garza. On August 10 at the first television tapings after Triplemanía XX, Los Perros del Mal turned on Garza and kicked him out of the stable following a beatdown, which required him to be stretchered out of the arena. Meanwhile, in the main event of the evening, Máscara Año 2000 Jr. avenged his Triplemanía XX loss by defeating Dr. Wagner Jr. in a rematch, following interference from Silver King. On August 18, Cibernético continued his rivalry with El Hijo del Perro Aguayo and Los Perros del Mal by combining his two previous stables, Los Bizarros and La Secta, to form the new stable La Secta Bizarra Cibernetica. The year-long rivalry eventually culminated in a Hair vs. Hair Lucha de Apuestas between Cibernético and Aguayo at Triplemanía XXI.|$|E

25|$|The {{generally}} accepted {{year for the}} original Northwich Victoria Football Club's founding is 1874 by Charles James Hughes and James Heyworth. However, according to club historian Ken Edwards' book A Team for All Seasons, the organisation itself <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> existence earlier in the 1870s. Northwich played their first challenge matches in the 1874 season and originally accepted both association football and rugby rules. This was shown in 1876 when they contested an away match under Rugby rules at Farnworth and Appleton F.C. (now known as Widnes Vikings) and then at home under association rules, winning both games. The first time the club entered an organised competition was the 1877 Welsh Cup, {{which at the time}} was open to Welsh teams as well as English teams situated close to the border. Its best achievement in the competition was in the 1881–82 and 1888–89 seasons, when the club reached the final, losing to Druids and Bangor respectively. When they reached the final in 1882, they were the first English club to do so. In 1880, the club entered the inaugural competition for the new Cheshire Football Association Challenge Cup (Cheshire Senior Cup) and became the first winners of the cup with a victory over Hartford St. John's. They {{went on to win the}} cup for the next five seasons, defeating in the finals: Birkenhead (1881), Northwich Novelty (1882), Crewe Alexandra (1883 and 1884), and Davenham (1885).|$|E
25|$|The power-sharing between Sigurd Munn and Inge Crouchback functioned well {{as long as}} {{they were}} both minors. In 1142, once again, a king's son arrived in Norway from west of the North Sea. This time it was Øystein Haraldsson, a son of Harald Gille. Øystein claimed part of his father's {{inheritance}} and was given the title of king, with a third of the kingdom. The three brothers ruled together, apparently in peace, until 1155. According to the sagas, Øystein and Sigurd Munn laid plans to depose their brother Inge and divide his share of the kingdom between them. At the urging of his mother Ingrid Ragnvaldsdotter and the influential lendmann Gregorius Dagsson, Inge decided to strike first, at a meeting among the three kings in Bergen. Sigurd Munn was attacked and killed by Inge's men before Øystein had had time to arrive in the city. Inge and Øystein then reached a tenuous settlement, but conditions between them soon deteriorated into open warfare, ending with Øystein's capture and murder in Bohuslän in 1157. Whether or not Inge himself ordered the killing of his brother seems to have been disputed at the time. The followers of Inge's dead brothers, Øystein and Sigurd Munn, were not inclined to submit to Inge and instead chose a new pretender (kongsemne), Sigurd Munn's son, Håkon the Broadshouldered. This development has been seen as the first sign of a new stage in the civil wars: The warring parties no longer simply sprung up around a king or pretender but stayed together after the fall of their leader and elected a new figurehead, heralding the formation of more firmly organized warring factions. A figurehead is all that Håkon <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> 1157, as he was only ten years old. However, his followers had him named king and continued the fight against Inge. In 1161 they succeeded in killing Inge in battle in Oslo.|$|E

500|$|The small navy that Henry VIII {{inherited}} {{from his father}} had only two sizeable ships, the carracks Regent and Sovereign.
