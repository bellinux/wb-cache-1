Temperatures are around 35°C (95°F) but humidity is very high; nights are around 27°C (81°F). Most of the rainfall occurs in this season, and the rain can cause severe floods. The sun is often occluded during the monsoon season.|$|E

The alternative choices are plant trees, develop city forest, and public transportation improvement. Sample is defined by Watson formula, which is about 300 respondents in three cities, randomly. In terms of supports, the research's findings are on spatial analysis and mitigation choices. Spatial analysis shows the <b>climate</b> <b>condition</b> in the Surakarta, Semarang and Magelang.

5|$|Researchers {{have noted}} that fires appear in cycles {{associated}} {{with those of the}} hydroperiods. The first cycle is the annual wet-season fires that occur with rapid frequency during the summer, but are quickly extinguished. Dry-season fires are rarer {{due to the lack of}} lightning, but their damage may be more pervasive. A longer fire cycle spanning ten to fourteen years coincides with similar water cycles affected by global <b>climate</b> <b>conditions.</b> Fires in this cycle may be numerous and have little effect, or rare and have catastrophic consequences. The third cycle appears in a 550-year frequency associated with severe drought. Layers of charcoal have been detected inside peat in parts of the Everglades, indicating the region endured severe fires for years at a time, although this trend seems to have abated since the last occurrence around 940 BCE.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Additional {{of fiber}} in {{concrete}} creates fiber reinforced concrete (FRC) with an {{improvement of the}} mechanical properties of the concrete. However, fiber incorporation in FRC is limited to 2 % to allow normal mixing procedure. To address this issue, high performance fiber reinforced concrete (HPFRC) is introduced and it is relatively new in construction industry. Since very limited information on its capacity in tropical <b>climate</b> <b>condition</b> exposure, this research focuses on investigation of compressive strength and microstructure properties of the produced concrete in tropical <b>climate</b> <b>condition.</b> In order to complete this research, grade 80 cement slurry is used with 3 %, 4 % and 5 % hooked-end steel fiber. Total numbers of 56 samples which are divided into 4 sets and exposed to two different curing methods namely water curing method and steam curing method at 80 oC. Out of the 4 sets, 2 sets are exposed to tropical <b>climate</b> <b>condition</b> using climatic chamber at 80 % relative humidity (RH) and constant temperature of 35 oC for 30 days. Compression and ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV) tests are carried out at 28 days to identify its strength as well as integrity of the concrete produced. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis is done to ascertain the microstructure properties of HPFRC. The highest compressive strength of 152. 2 MPa was recorded for steam curing samples after exposed to tropical <b>climate</b> <b>condition</b> for 30 days with 5 % steel fiber volume...|$|R

40|$|Thornthwaite Moisture Index (TMI) was {{introduced}} in 1948 as an index to classify the <b>climate</b> <b>condition</b> of different areas. Since then it has been widely used in many fields such as agricultural and environmental geotechnics. The Australian residential footing design procedure is associated with TMI in order to relate the effect of <b>climate</b> <b>condition</b> on the variation of soil moisture profile. This paper illustrates the different methods commonly used to calculate TMI and compares their different outcomes. The different calculation methods result in different TMI values for the same <b>climate</b> <b>condition</b> which consequently affects the subsequent correlations. The sensitivity of the primary climate data used to calculate TMI is also discussed in this paper. TMI is an index highly dependent on the rainfall variation and is less sensitive to temperature variations and so the annual TMI can be reliably related to annual rainfall. The change in TMI with change of number of years which the average rainfall is based on has also been presented in this paper. The higher the numbers of years used to obtain the average TMI, the less reliable it is to describe the effects of extreme climate events...|$|R
