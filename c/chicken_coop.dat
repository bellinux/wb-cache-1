5|$|Applewood Farm is a {{farmstead}} in Ledyard, Connecticut, United States. Constructed in 1826 by Russel Gallup, {{the farmhouse}} was built with a colonial center chimney design with Federal style details {{that has been}} modernized to the early 20th century without significantly changing the floor plan. Named after the apple orchards planted by Russel Gallup, Applewood Farm developed significantly under the ownership of Everett Gallup, the last {{member of the family}} to own the property. The property was later owned by Arlene Meyer Cohen and a 40-acre parcel was sold off in November 1984. After the Betz family became the owners it was added to the National Register of Historic Places and operated as a bed and breakfast through the 1990s. In 1987, the property included five contributory structures, the farmhouse, corn crib, barn, silo and <b>chicken</b> <b>coop.</b> The property also has one non-contributing structure, a machinery shed from the 1960s.|$|E

The windows are still the original double-hung, two-over-two or six-over-six panes, with dentil molding in each lintel.

25|$|Despite this, Queensland and Northern Territory Aerial Services (QANTAS) {{bought the}} first {{prototype}} in November 1920 for GBP 2,798 {{with the intention}} of using it on a route between Charleville and Katherine.

50|$|Other tasks {{included}} collecting from buildings, building inns, wagons, general stores, log cabin, schools, <b>chicken</b> <b>coops,</b> barns, trading posts, barber shops, churches, and sawmills {{as well as}} seeding, {{growing and}} harvesting crops. Completing goals yielded rewards for the player. One early source of game points, which was changed by Zynga, was for the player to build as many <b>chicken</b> <b>coops</b> as possible. One noted player managed to build 28 upgraded <b>chicken</b> <b>coops.</b> The <b>chickens</b> became ready to feed every 30 minutes, but the <b>chicken</b> <b>coops</b> could only allow the stored chickens to be feed only once in a 24-hour period. Having more than 24 allowed the player to feed all of their chickens for free every 30 minutes, which gave the player added coins, collection items and game points. Feeding coops {{as often as possible}} did elevate the player's game level in a shorter time. Sometimes, players could set their own goals, such as surpassing a billion coins, or saving over a million food points, or growing over 1300 horses on their land. One player of note, had passed over 1.2 billion coins, 13 million food points and over 1300 grown horses on his land, when the game was removed by Zynga. Horses were fed for free and gave between zero points to four points of energy. The upgraded barn could hold 1000 cows of various types, 1000 horses, and 1000 mules.|$|R
