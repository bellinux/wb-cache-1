25|$|From 1978–1982, Micelli {{attended}} the University of the Arts in Philadelphia where the vibraphone <b>caught</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> and ear. He {{spent so much}} time on vibraphone that he neglected his study of timpani, snare drum, and marimba. His teacher fought for him, and he passed.|$|E
25|$|Hundertwasser {{developed}} artistic skills early on. After the war, {{he spent}} three {{months at the}} Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna. At this time he began to sign his art as Hundertwasser instead of Stowasser. He left to travel using a small set of paints he carried at all times to sketch anything that <b>caught</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye.</b> In Florence he met the young French painter René Brô {{for the first time}} and they became lifelong friends. Hundertwasser's first commercial painting success was in 1952–53 with an exhibition in Vienna.|$|E
500|$|Andersen {{retained}} story {{ideas in}} his mind sometimes for years before coalescing with an event or mood in his life, and telling stories such as “The Snowman” was a compulsion with him. The tale {{has been described as}} poignant and lyrical, and as a self-mocking autobiographical revelation in which Andersen expressed his conviction that love is a burning, unreciprocated pain, and that he would end his life partnerless and alone. The light-hearted Snowman is a complement to Andersen’s tragic Fir Tree and, in telling the tale, Andersen returns “to his earlier, tragicomic mode of sketching the fleeting autobiography of an everyday object which seems to have <b>caught</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> at random and yet whose life story has an uncanny appropriateness to its physical form.” ...|$|E
60|$|As Giant drew {{in sight}} of the trap {{something}} <b>caught</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> that brought him stock still in wonder.|$|R
60|$|On his {{sleeping}} porch, glancing at his barometers and thermometers, her laughing {{face in the}} round frame <b>caught</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> and, standing before it, even bending closer to it, he studied her long.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I couldn't {{stand it}} any longer,' he said. 'You can't imagine how awful {{it was to}} see that wretched man in the dock. He looked like a hunted beast, his face was all grey with fright, and once I <b>caught</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> I shall never forget the look that was in them.' ...|$|R
500|$|Oai {{first met}} Tokugawa Ieyasu {{at about the}} age of 17 or 18, when he visited the Saigō family and Oai served him tea. [...] It is {{believed}} she <b>caught</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> on that occasion, but as she was still married, nothing came of it at the time. [...] Later, during the 1570s, it is believed that friendship and genuine affection developed between the two. [...] This view contradicts a common impression which maintains that Ieyasu was a ruthless leader who treated all the women in his life, and all of his offspring, as commodities to be used as needed to serve the clan or his own ambitions. [...] However, it is also known that he valued personal merit over bloodlines. [...] During this time, Ieyasu had a house built in eastern Mikawa, far from the residence of his wife, the Lady Tsukiyama, in Okazaki. [...] The marriage between Ieyasu and Lady Tsukiyama had been arranged by her uncle, Imagawa Yoshimoto, ostensibly to help cement ties between the two clans, though Ieyasu found it difficult to live with his wife's jealousy, tempestuous moods, and eccentric habits.|$|E
2500|$|Outside school, {{the young}} man was still introverted, and, Sandqvist notes, [...] "extremely shy, {{especially}} with girls." [...] Ciprian recalls Ciriviș's engrossing pick-up lines: he acted familiar to any young woman who <b>caught</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye,</b> assuring her that they had met once before, and, having stirred her curiosity, falsely recounting how they both used to kill flesh-flies for sport.|$|E
2500|$|The women kept a {{diary and}} in April 1903 {{showed it to}} Stephen Coleridge, {{secretary}} of the British National Anti-Vivisection Society. The 200-page manuscript contained one allegation, in a chapter called [...] "Fun," [...] that <b>caught</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye,</b> namely that a brown terrier dog had been operated on multiple times over a two-month period by several researchers, then dissected – without anaesthesia, according to the diary – {{in front of an}} audience of laughing medical students: ...|$|E
60|$|Presently {{there was}} a sound of footsteps, and Dane guessed that the {{approaching}} shape was Chatterton by the red glow of his cigar. The iron-master stopped beside the alder, {{and it seemed that}} something which caused a ripple near its roots <b>caught</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> Dane suspected that some poacher had set a night line.|$|R
6000|$|The {{first thing}} which <b>caught</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> {{as he entered}} the drawing-room before dinner was Argemone {{listening}} in absorbed reverence to her favourite vicar,--a stern, prim, close-shaven, dyspeptic man, with a meek, cold smile, which might have become a cruel one. He watched and watched in vain, hoping to catch her eye; but no--there she stood, and talked and listened-- ...|$|R
60|$|He <b>caught</b> <b>his</b> father's <b>eye,</b> {{and with}} a jerk of his thumb telegraphed for {{instructions}} as to the disposal of Mr. Carter.|$|R
2500|$|Datsyuk {{was first}} noticed by Detroit Red Wings Director of European Scouting Håkan Andersson {{in the summer}} of 1997–98. Andersson was in Moscow to scout defenceman Dmitri Kalinin, but the one who <b>caught</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> was Datsyuk, {{described}} as [...] "this little guy on the other team." [...] Andersson made another trip to see Datsyuk and would have gone a third time, though his flight was canceled due to a storm. A scout from the St. Louis Blues was scheduled to fly on the plane as well, {{and as a result of}} the storm, Andersson believes he was the only NHL scout to have seen Datsyuk play prior to the 1998 NHL Entry Draft, when the Red Wings drafted him 171st overall.|$|E
2500|$|The Maiden Queen {{featured}} breeches roles, {{where the}} actress appeared in men's clothes under one pretense or another, and as Bax supposes [...] "was {{one of the}} first occasions upon which a woman appeared in the disguise of a man"; if nothing else this could draw an audience eager to see the women show off their figures in the more form-fitting male attire. The attraction had another dynamic: the theatres sometimes had a hard time holding onto their actresses, as they were swept up to become the kept mistresses of the aristocracy. In 1667, Nell Gwyn made such a match with Charles Sackville, titled Lord Buckhurst at that time. She supposedly <b>caught</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> during an April performance of All Mistaken, or The Mad Couple, especially in one scene in which, to escape a hugely fat suitor able to move only by rolling, she rolls across the stage herself, her feet toward the audience and her petticoats flying about. A satire of the time describes this and also Hart's position now, in the face of competition from the upper echelons of society: ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{must stop}} {{and see what}} that is," [...] said Happy Jack. So down the tree he ran, {{and in a few}} minutes he had found the queer thing, which had <b>caught</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> It was smooth and black and white, and at one end it was very sharp with a tiny little barb. Happy Jack found it out by {{pricking}} himself with it.|$|R
50|$|The Guru had the {{inspiration}} {{to rebuild the}} temple in glass {{during one of his}} trips to Bangkok. He was in a tuk-tuk (auto-rickshaw) in Bangkok when he saw a light shining like a diamond, some 2 km away. The driver told him that it was a wat (temple). When he went there, he found that it was the glass artwork at the temple entrance that had <b>caught</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|R
6000|$|At last {{there came}} {{a time when it}} was evident that the patient was sinking fast. He might die at any moment. I looked up at the Professor and <b>caught</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> fixed on mine. His face was sternly set as he spoke, [...] "There is no time to lose. His words may be worth many lives. I have been {{thinking}} so, as I stood here. It may be there is a soul at stake! We shall operate just above the ear." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{rose and}} lit the gas, {{and a letter}} on the mantelpiece <b>caught</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye.</b>|$|E

60|$|Fenn <b>caught</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye,</b> {{and smiled}} painfully. Then {{he turned and}} went into the house.|$|E
60|$|Thornton did not reply. He did {{not know}} what to say. He glanced from face to face in the absent way of a man who has lost the power of thought and is seeking somewhere to find the thing that will start it going again. The face of Jim O'Brien, a Mastodon King and old-time comrade, <b>caught</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> It was as a cue to him, seeming to rouse him to do what he would never have dreamed of doing.|$|R
60|$|He {{pulled up}} sharply {{to avoid a}} {{collision}} with the gaunt man, who had stopped at fault upon the trail. Just at that guilty moment he <b>caught</b> <b>his</b> master's <b>eye</b> looking towards him.|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope he won't be an ass," [...] {{returned}} Clement. [...] "Such patient goodness {{ought not}} to be snubbed by-—" [...] He <b>caught</b> <b>his</b> sister's <b>eye,</b> and made <b>his</b> last words [...] "youthful theorists." ...|$|R
60|$|Spike {{was looking}} at him over his glass with respectful admiration. Jimmy <b>caught</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye,</b> and spoke.|$|E
60|$|Harry, unobserved by Mr. Webster, {{grinned at}} Frank, looking solemn again {{as his father}} <b>caught</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye.</b>|$|E
60|$|A map on the wall, {{lined with}} red, <b>caught</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye,</b> and he seized upon it for diversion.|$|E
60|$|Eugene lounged slowly {{towards the}} Temple, smoking his cigar, but saw {{no more of}} the dolls' dressmaker, through the {{accident}} of their taking {{opposite sides of the}} street. He lounged along moodily, and stopped at Charing Cross to look about him, with as little interest in the crowd as any man might take, and was lounging on again, when a most unexpected object <b>caught</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> No less an object than Jenny Wren's bad boy trying to make up his mind to cross the road.|$|R
6000|$|... 'It's {{very good}} of you, but there won't be any {{negotiations}} with Mr Ford. I am taking the boy back to Sanstead, as I told you.' I <b>caught</b> <b>his</b> pained <b>eye.</b> 'I'm afraid you don't believe me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Leibnitz, {{the founder}} of optimism, tells somewhere how there was in the Temple of Memphis a high pyramid of globes placed one above the others; how a priest, being asked by a {{traveller}} about this pyramid and its globes, made answer that these were all the possible worlds, and that the most perfect of them all was at the summit; how the traveller, curious to see this most perfect of all possible worlds, mounted {{to the top of}} the pyramid, and the first thing that <b>caught</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> as they turned towards the globe at the summit, was Tarquin outraging Lucretia."[221] ...|$|R

60|$|During {{the whole}} time which had elapsed between Jack's {{revealing}} her true character, and the moment {{of which we are}} now writing, Spike had not once spoken to his wife. Often had she <b>caught</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> intently riveted on her, when he would turn them away, as she feared, in distaste; and once or twice he groaned deeply, more like a man who suffered mental than bodily pain. Still the patient did not speak once in all the time mentioned. We should be representing poor Jack as possessing more philosophy, or less feeling, than the truth would warrant, were we to say that she was not hurt at this conduct in her husband.|$|R
60|$|Blake {{received}} the message, {{but he did}} not act promptly. Pan <b>caught</b> <b>his</b> suspicious <b>eye,</b> baleful, gleaming. Possibly the man was worse than weak. Presently he left the poker game which he had been watching and shuffled up to Pan. He appeared to be enough under the influence of liquor to be leeringly bold.|$|R
60|$|The barmaid {{attending}} to this compartment was invisible to Jude's direct glance, though {{a reflection of}} her back in the glass behind her was occasionally <b>caught</b> by <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> He had only observed this listlessly, when she turned her face {{for a moment to}} the glass to set her hair tidy. Then he was amazed to discover that the face was Arabella's.|$|R
