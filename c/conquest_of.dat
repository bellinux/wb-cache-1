5|$|In 1523, Hernán Cortés {{organised}} two expeditions towards Central America from Mexico, one by {{land and}} the other by sea. He commissioned the first to Pedro de Alvarado and the second to Cristóbal de Olid. Alvarado initiated the <b>conquest</b> <b>of</b> Guatemala, and then set out on an expedition into Honduras. Olid began the <b>conquest</b> <b>of</b> Honduras' interior, arriving in 1524, but soon set himself up independently of Cortés.|$|E

5|$|Indigenous {{resistance}} was stubborn, and Montejo {{did not complete}} the <b>conquest</b> <b>of</b> western and central Honduras until 1539. Once he had established Spanish control there, he headed east to pacify the Olancho valley. Although the <b>conquest</b> <b>of</b> the west and centre of the territory was difficult, and the natives were well organised, resistance in the east took much longer to put down, and rebellions there lasted throughout the colonial period.|$|E

5|$|The K'iche' Kingdom of Q'umarkaj conquered Zaculeu in the Postclassic. Traditionally {{that has}} been {{calculated}} as during the 15th century AD based on ethnohistoric accounts. Radiocarbon dating has pushed back the calculations of the K'iche' conquests by three centuries, and researchers now say their <b>conquest</b> <b>of</b> the Mam kingdoms may have taken place {{as early as the}} 12th century.

5|$|The Spanish <b>conquest</b> <b>of</b> Petén was {{the last}} stage of the <b>conquest</b> <b>of</b> Guatemala, a {{prolonged}} conflict during the Spanish colonisation of the Americas. A wide lowland plain covered with dense rainforest, Petén contains a central drainage basin {{with a series of}} lakes and areas of savannah. It is crossed by several ranges of low karstic hills and rises to the south as it nears the Guatemalan Highlands. The <b>conquest</b> <b>of</b> Petén, a region now incorporated into the modern republic of Guatemala, climaxed in 1697 with the capture of Nojpetén, the island capital of the Itza kingdom, by Martín de Ursúa y Arizmendi. With the defeat of the Itza, the last independent and unconquered native kingdom in the Americas fell to European colonisers.|$|E
5|$|The sources {{describing}} the Spanish <b>conquest</b> <b>of</b> Guatemala include those {{written by the}} Spanish themselves, among them two letters written by conquistador Pedro de Alvarado in 1524, {{describing the}} initial campaign to subjugate the Guatemalan Highlands. Gonzalo de Alvarado y Chávez wrote an account that mostly supports that of Pedro de Alvarado. Pedro de Alvarado's brother Jorge wrote another account to the king of Spain that explained {{it was his own}} campaign of 1527–1529 that established the Spanish colony. Bernal Díaz del Castillo wrote a lengthy account of the <b>conquest</b> <b>of</b> Mexico and neighbouring regions, the Historia verdadera de la conquista de la Nueva España ("True History of the <b>Conquest</b> <b>of</b> New Spain"); his account of the <b>conquest</b> <b>of</b> Guatemala generally agrees with that of the Alvarados. He also included his own description of Cortes' expedition, and an account of the <b>conquest</b> <b>of</b> the Chiapas highlands. Conquistador Diego Godoy accompanied Luis Marín on his reconnaissance of Chiapas, and wrote an account of the battle against the inhabitants of Chamula. Hernán Cortés described his expedition to Honduras in the fifth letter of his Cartas de Relación. Dominican friar Bartolomé de las Casas wrote a highly critical account of the Spanish <b>conquest</b> <b>of</b> the Americas and included accounts of some incidents in Guatemala.|$|E

They marched independently and captured Edessa, Amida (Diyarbakır), Malatya and raided Byzantine Armenia up to Ararat region and also reportedly raided central Anatolia. Heraclius had already abandoned all the forts between Antioch and Tartus to create a buffer zone or no man's land between Muslim controlled areas and main land Anatolia.|$|E
