40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we present {{lessons learned from}} {{building}} a Semantic Desktop system, the gnowsis beta. On desktop computers, semantic software has to provide stable services and has to reflect the personal view of the user. Our approach to ontologies, the Personal Information Model PIMO allows to create tagging services like del. icio. us on the desktop. A semantic wiki allows further annotations. <b>Continuous</b> <b>evaluations</b> of the system helped to improve it. These results were created in the EPOS research project and {{are available in the}} open source projects Aperture, kaukoluwiki, and gnowsis and will be continued in the Nepomuk project.

40|$|When {{it comes}} to non-trivial {{networked}} computer systems, bulletproof security {{is very hard to}} achieve. Over a system's lifetime new security risks are likely to emerge from e. g. newly discovered classes of vulnerabilities or the arrival of new threat agents. Given the dynamic environment in which computer systems are deployed, <b>continuous</b> <b>evaluations</b> and adjustments are wiser than one-shot e orts for perfection. Security risk management focuses on assessing and treating security risks against computer systems. In this thesis, elements from risk management are applied to two real-world systems to identify, evaluate, and mitigate risks. One of the pinpointed weaknesses is studied in-depth to produce an exploit against the a ected system. In addition, approaches to handle common software security problems are described...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim is to}} help {{students}} achieving academic green fingers, by introducing Greenhouse pedagogy. One purpose is to offer direct feedback from plants on the students presumptions. This enhances their capacity to predict and understand crop production science. The students framed the questions and different cultivation systems worked in parallel. The feedback from <b>continuous</b> <b>evaluations</b> resulted in revised maintenance plans and predictions of results that anew were evaluated. The lecturers involved in the courses related their information to the problems the students faced. The greenhouse pedagogy was evaluated by students both orally and written. Also teachers evaluated it and discussed improvements. The work with greenhouse pedagogy will continue at the department, since we find it successful in relation to accomplishment...|$|R

The resulting data could be used to rate the overall interest of video programs or index specific scenes for educational or entertainment contexts...|$|R
40|$|These authors contributed equally. Abstractâ€”Many {{approaches}} {{have been developed}} to tackle the design complexity of modern robotic systems by using evolutionary processes. Starting with an initial solution, the evolutionary process tries to adapt to a given scenario and in the end produces an improved solution. Previous work showed that incremental evolution, a stepwise increase in the scenario difficulty, can increase the success of evolutionary adaptation. In this work, we clearly confirm this effect in the context of online evolution of neural networks. The goal of our online evolutionary approach is to produce on average good, intermediate solutions while the system is adapting. We show that also the average performance of the <b>continuous</b> <b>evaluations</b> is increased by evolving first in a simple scenario and then transitioning to a more difficult scenario...|$|R
40|$|Whereas {{ambiguity}} {{in everyday life}} is often negatively evaluated, it is considered key in art appreciation. In a facial EMG study, we tested whether the positive role of visual {{ambiguity in}} paintings is reflected in a <b>continuous</b> affective <b>evaluation</b> on a subtle level. We presented ambiguous (disfluent) and non-ambiguous (fluent) versions of Magritte paintings and found that M. Zygomaticus major activation was higher and M. corrugator supercilii activation was lower for ambiguous than for non-ambiguous versions. Our findings reflect a positive <b>continuous</b> affective <b>evaluation</b> to visual ambiguity in paintings over the 5 s presentation time. We claim that this finding is indirect evidence for the hypothesis that visual stimuli classified as art, evoke a safe state for indulging into experiencing ambiguity, challenging the notion that processing fluency is generally related to positive affect...|$|R
