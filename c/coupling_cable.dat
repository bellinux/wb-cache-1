40|$|Tree-like {{structures}} are ubiquitous in nature. In particular, neuronal axons and dendrites have tree-like geometries that mediate electrical signaling {{within and between}} cells. Electrical activity in neuronal trees is typically modeled using <b>coupled</b> <b>cable</b> equations on multi-compartment representations, where each compartment represents a small segment of the neuronal membrane. The geometry of each compartment is usually defined as a cylinder or, at best, a surface of revolution based on a linear approximation of the radial change in the neurite. The resulting geometry of the model neuron is coarse, with non-smooth or even discontinuous jumps at the boundaries between compartments. We propose a hyperbolic approximation to model the geometry of neurite compartments, a branched, multi-compartment extension, and a simple graphical approach to calculate steady-state solutions of an associated system of <b>coupled</b> <b>cable</b> equations. A simple case of transient solutions is also briefly discussed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This work {{presents}} {{the use of}} unscented transforms (UT) for the description of statistical uncertainty in electromagnetic <b>coupling</b> between <b>cables.</b> UT greatly reduce the computational burden for the statistical analysis of nonlinear problems compared with more traditional approaches such as the Monte Carlo technique. <b>Coupling</b> between <b>cables</b> has a nonlinear parameter dependence and has a high variability due to the variability in the cable braid manufacture and the highly variable nature of cable layout. Therefore, <b>cable</b> <b>coupling</b> can only be defined within statistical limits. First, it is shown that by analyzing the resonances the important features of maximum coupling and the point of maximum coupling can be characterized. It is then demonstrated how UT {{can be used to}} efficiently identify the parameters which contribute significantly to the uncertainty in <b>cable</b> <b>coupling</b> and then to provide a measure of the probability distribution for the multivariate problem...|$|R

40|$|Simulated {{lightning}} strike testing of instrumentation cabling on the redesigned solid rocket motor was performed. Testing consisted of subjecting the lightning evaluation test article to simulated {{lightning strike}}s and evaluating {{the effects of}} instrumentation cable transients on cables within the system tunnel. The maximum short-circuit current induced onto a United Space Boosters, Inc., operational flight cable within the systems tunnel was 92 A, and the maximum induced open-circuit voltage was 316 V. These levels were extrapolated to the worst-case (200 kA) condition of NASA specification NSTS 07636 and were also scaled to full-scale redesigned solid rocket motor dimensions. Testing showed that voltage <b>coupling</b> to <b>cables</b> within the systems tunnel can be reduced 40 to 90 dB and that current <b>coupling</b> to <b>cables</b> within the systems tunnel can be reduced 30 to 70 dB {{with the use of}} braided metallic sock shields around cables that are external to the systems tunnel. Testing also showed that current and voltage levels induced onto cables within the systems tunnel are partially dependant on the cables' relative locations within the systems tunnel. Results of current injections to the systems tunnel indicate that the dominant <b>coupling</b> mode on <b>cables</b> within the systems tunnel is not from instrumentation <b>cables</b> but from <b>coupling</b> through the systems tunnel cover seam apertures. It is recommended that methods of improving the electrical bonding between individual sections of the systems tunnel covers be evaluated.

40|$|Switched-mode power {{supplies}} in variable-frequency drives often combine good electrical efficiency with generous production of conducted emission. The common-mode (CM) current through the output-to-motor cable may perturb nearby systems via cable-to-cable crosstalk. Parameters relevant for the coupling are the rise-fall times and amplitude of the output current and voltage, and types and lengths of the cables. Of the many techniques {{to reduce the}} crosstalk, we investigated a particular one: Reduction of the CM current by the armor of the motor cable. The armor is intended for mechanical protection, but may also substantially reduce the crosstalk. In an actual installation, we measured the transient current through the three phase leads of a motor cable. The cable length was 85 m, and it was buried in wet soil {{for most of its}} length. We also measured the transfer impedance of the armor up to 10 MHz, and used this to calculate the overall CM current in a <b>coupled</b> <b>cable</b> model using assumed reasonable values for the cable and soil parameters. Measurements and model results agreed well on the amplitude of the dominant resonance at about 300 kHz. The ratio of the inside transients to CM current was a factor of 20. © 2008 IEEE...|$|R

40|$|Communication cables {{are used}} to {{transfer}} data between components of a system. As {{a part of the}} EMC analysis of complex systems, it is necessary to determine which level of interference can be expected at the input of connected devices due to the coupling into the irradiated cable. For electrically large systems consisting of several rooms with cables connecting components located in different rooms, an estimation of the <b>coupled</b> disturbances inside <b>cables</b> using commercial field computation software is often not feasible without several restrictions. In many cases, this is related to the non-availability of computing memory and processing power needed for the computation. In this paper, we are going to show that, starting from a topological analysis of the entire system, weak coupling paths within the system can be can be identified. By neglecting these coupling paths and using the transmission line approach, the original system will be simplified so that a simpler estimation is possible. Using the example of a system which is composed of two rooms, multiple apertures, and a network cable located in both chambers, it is shown that an estimation of the coupled disturbances due to external electromagnetic sources is feasible with this approach. Starting from an incident electromagnetic field, we determine transfer functions describing the <b>coupling</b> means (apertures, <b>cables).</b> Using these transfer functions and the knowledge of the weak coupling paths above, a decision is taken regarding the means for paths that can be neglected during the estimation.
