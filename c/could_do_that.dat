Hideki asks why, and Freya explains that Chi discovered there were certain things that humans <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> she could not, leading her to believe that while Hideki would love her, it would make her existence unbearable. Hideki protests that it would not, but Freya tells him that Chi thought otherwise. She then tells Chitose {{that the time has}} come to destroy both of them, and she reluctantly agrees. Against Hideki's protestations, she deactivates Freya. Chi, however, has survived the deactivation and comes to the conclusion that while life with Hideki may seem painful because of her limitations, it is even more painful without him. She regains control of her body and completes her program, giving every persocom the ability to love then embraces Hideki.|$|E

25|$|Construction {{went well}} {{enough that the}} {{designers}} raised their LEED certification target level to gold. The only significant aspect of the building to fall short of original expectations was the photovoltaics in the curtain wall. They had to be manufactured by the French company Saint-Gobain S.A. and shipped to Yellowknife preassembled since there were no workers there who <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> One of the planned bands of cells had to be abandoned when the euro appreciated enough against the Canadian dollar during construction as to make its cost prohibitive.|$|E
25|$|Kitagawa {{was born}} on August 22, 1986 in Hyōgo Prefecture, Japan, and has a younger brother. She grew up in Kobe, and lost many friends in the Great Hanshin {{earthquake}} in 1995. As a child, {{she wanted to be}} a doctor, but by the time she reached high school she was uncertain as to whether she <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> and not sure what to do in the future. At around this time, she was scouted by a talent agency, and she decided to try the entertainment world. Her parents were initially opposed, but they gave their permission, on two conditions: that she give up if she was making no progress within a year, and that she put her studies first and graduate from university. She has kept the second half of the promise, graduating in commercial science from Meiji University in Tokyo in March 2009.|$|E
25|$|Soon after, Danío began a {{trial of}} {{residence}} that seized the properties of Pozo, who had since gathered a considerable fortune. The former treasurer was also jailed and permanently vanished from the New World. Furthermore, Danío also managed to acquire ecclesiastic censorship from Valvidia, who threatened his allies with eternal damnation. Twelve residents soon revealed the places were Pozo has hidden part of his wealth. The governor used the law as his weapon, who sentenced the other involved to pay a fine of 1,601 pieces of eight and banned them from serving in a public office {{for a period of}} ten years. Some where even banished from San Juan. Those affected quickly countered by sending letters to the Crown, which responded by ordering the excarteration of Pozo, allowing him to present his case in Spain. However, before the former treasurer <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> he found himself involved in the secret investigation that was being done against Enríquez. Due to the large quantity of accusations offered by each side, the Council of the Indies suspected both. Judge Tomás Férnandez Pérez was placed in charge and arrived to San Juan in 1721. Danío was also involved due to his friendship with the privateer and he was ordered to cooperate with the investigation by leaving San Juan while it was underway. Fernández began by interrogating 21 of Enríquez's enemies, who offered the same arguments. Once the judge heard all of their versions, he determined that they were merely motivated by their desire to punish the privateer. The blame fell on Pozo and Francisco de Allende, with the entire group being jailed.|$|E

500|$|The band is not musically polished. Paul has joked that, if {{they had}} known of the band’s popularity, they might have made [...] "an effort to sing in tune.

While musicianship is not the strength of the band, Paul says that the fans [...] "know we're not the best singers and keyboard players, but we're okay. And they think, well, I <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> too. I think that’s really encouraging to people..." [...] Paul sees the brothers as a [...] "bridge between this mainstream phenomena of Harry Potter and the indie rock underground. Plus, we’re also pretty strong adherents to the DIY ideal."

500|$|Vince Gilligan, {{the writer}} of the episode, wanted Bryan Cranston to play the {{antagonist}} because he felt he would humanize the role. “We needed a guy who could be scary and kind of loathsome {{but at the same}} time had a deep, resounding humanity," [...] he later said. [...] In an interview with The New York Times, Gilligan stated, [...] "We had this villain, and we needed the audience to feel bad for him when he died. Bryan alone was the only actor who <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> who could pull off that trick. And it is a trick. I have no idea how he does it.” Rick Millikan, the casting director for The X-Files noted that Cranston was nearly not chosen for this episode. Initially, the part of Crump had been assigned to a different actor, but Cranston came prepared to audition for the part. Although the character had already been cast, Millikan allowed him to audition and was very pleased with his performance and chose him for the part instead.|$|E
500|$|In a July 2009 {{interview}} with Rolling Stone, Cornell shot down {{rumors of a}} reunion, saying that conversations between the band members had been limited to discussion about {{the release of a}} box set or B-sides album of Soundgarden rarities, and that there had been no discussion of a reunion at all. The band's interest in new releases emerged from a 2008 meeting about their shared properties, both financial and legal, where they realized Soundgarden lacked online presence such as a website or a Facebook page. As Thayil summed up, [...] "we kind of had neglected our merchandise over the last decade". Eventually the musicians decided to create an official site handled by Pearl Jam's Ten Club, relaunch their catalog, and according to Cameron, seek [...] "a bunch of unreleased stuff we wanted to try to put out". On March 2009, Thayil, Shepherd and Cameron got onstage during a concert by Tad Doyle in Seattle and played some Soundgarden songs. Cornell stated that the moment [...] "sort of sparked the idea: If Matt, Kim, and Ben can get in a room, rehearse a couple songs, and play, maybe we all <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> as Soundgarden." ...|$|E
500|$|When 20th Century Fox {{acquired}} the film rights to Watchmen, the comic's writer Alan Moore was initially {{excited about the}} film adaptation. In a 1987 edition of Comics Interview, he revealed Sam Hamm, who was attached to write, visited him in Northampton for lunch and that he felt Hamm would provide an adaptation faithful to the comic's spirit. Ultimately, Hamm's script altered the ending, having Adrian Veidt die and Dr. Manhattan alter time so that Jon Osterman is not affected by the radiation. As a result, the remaining characters are teleported {{to the real world}} created as a result of time travel. In an interview with Varietys Danny Graydon, during Warner Bros.'s first possession of feature film rights for Watchmen, Moore changed his mind, adamantly opposing a film adaptation of his comic book. Moore felt that, contrary to others’ opinion, the comic book was not cinematic. When he was approached by Terry Gilliam on how to film the comic book, Moore stated that he [...] "didn't think it was filmable". Moore clarified for Graydon, [...] "I didn't design it to show off the similarities between cinema and comics, which are there, but in my opinion are fairly unremarkable. It was designed to show off the things that comics <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> cinema and literature couldn't." ...|$|E

500|$|... "The Broken Man" [...] {{was written}} by Bryan Cogman. his second of two episodes for the season, the first being the {{previous}} episode, [...] "Blood of My Blood". It also adapts the chapter [...] "Jaime VI" [...] from A Feast for Crows. The title of the episode is in reference to a speech given by Septon Meribald, a character in the A Song of Ice and Fire series, who was also used to create the character of Ray. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Cogman stated, [...] "The speech itself didn't {{make it into the}} episode, but it inspired the character and some of his dialogue. So the title of the episode is a nod to that speech." [...] He compared it to the second season episode [...] "The Ghost of Harrenhal", whose title was also a reference to the books, but was not specifically stated in the episode. Ian McShane, who portrayed Ray, spoke about the writing in the episode in regards to his participation in the series, noting, [...] "they wrote a two-page speech – so that's why they invited me. It’s a big soliloquy, like in Deadwood, and they needed to get somebody who <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> It was really well written." ...|$|E
500|$|Slay Tracks found {{unexpected}} attention {{after the}} Leeds, England-based band The Wedding Present covered [...] "Box Elder" [...] {{on their own}} 1990 EP, Brassneck. The Wedding Present's bassist, Keith Gregory, had been introduced to Slay Tracks by future Pavement bassist Mark Ibold while visiting New York City. The Wedding Present cover {{is different from the}} original in that the line [...] "that I had to {{get the fuck out of}} this town" [...] was changed to [...] "that I had to get right out of this town". The [...] "Box Elder" [...] cover received radio airplay from influential English disc jockey John Peel, which generated publicity for both The Wedding Present and Pavement. Neither member of Pavement was aware of the cover until Kannberg was informed of it. Kannberg remembered [...] "I was kind of mad. I had no idea that people <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> so I was all offended." [...] However, his opinion of the cover and its significance later changed: [...] "It was so cool that some band from the UK wanted to cover this obscure, horribly recorded song. At the time I probably never appreciated the full extent of how them covering the song helped Pavement, especially in the UK, but it really did, and I'll always be grateful to them for that." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} to his success on the football field, Taylor's personal life has been marred by drug usage and controversy. When Taylor was once asked what he <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> no outside linebacker could, his answer was, [...] "Drink". However, alcohol abuse was not the largest of his substance abuse problems. After admitting to and testing positive for cocaine in 1987, he was suspended from football for 30 days in 1988 after failing a second drug test. After his second positive test he gave up drugs for five years as a third positive test would have ended his career. As he approached retirement, however, {{he looked forward to}} picking up the habit again, saying in his second autobiography, [...] "I saw blow as the only bright spot in my future." [...] After his retirement, he began abusing drugs on a regular basis. He went through drug rehab twice in 1995, only to later be arrested twice over a three-year span for attempting to buy cocaine from undercover police officers. During this period, he lived almost exclusively in his home with white sheets covering his windows and only associated with other drug users. Taylor later said, [...] "I had gotten really bad. I mean my place was almost like a crack house." [...] In his second autobiography, Taylor admitted that he had begun using drugs as early as his rookie season in the NFL. He has also stated that his first wife, Linda, mother to his three children, once had to come pick him up from a crack house during his playing career.|$|E
