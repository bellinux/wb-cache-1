40|$|The city is {{space of}} the thesis and {{synthesis}} of capital. Economic organization and the spatial confi guration are founding for functionality, expansion, maintenance and capitalist innovation. Thus, the city is meant just as objectifi ed space of world of work. However, <b>capital</b> <b>formats</b> your own antithesis, which {{is presented in the}} lived space through of deviate practices. Practices and deviant spatialities relate to behaviors, attitudes, gestures, languages and thoughts that deviate from logics planned for commercialization of space. Write in the relationship between city and deviant practices in three punctuns. We start from the cultural approach to think the city in the interstitial levels of social production of space. Then, we realize a hermeneutic exercise in favor and against the city to characterize it as a place for excellence in different spatiality. Finally, we exemplify the deviant practices as antithetical element of the capital. We believe that the deviant practices cause discomfort of civilization to realize the existence of spatialities possible out of the logic of space confi guration dictated by hegemonic actors and groups...|$|R

Denmark had the station from 2003 to 2005, the largest air {{coverage}} of all Danish commercial radio stations. Although the station was very popular in the beginning, the listening figures dropped rapidly and fell against the revenue, partly because of strong competition from state broadcaster Danmarks Radio and Radio 100FM (part of Talpa <b>Capital).</b> A <b>format</b> change which makes henceforth presented programs were told not to avail.

40|$|Under current law, {{domestic}} {{deposits of}} federally insured banks {{are subject to}} a 1 / 12 th of one percent per annum insurance assessment, while foreign deposits are not. This paper examines the arguments for and against extending this assessment to foreign branch deposits of insured banks, which in the aggregate amount to more than $ 200 billion. These arguments are based on real or imagined effects on FDIC revenues, the competitive position of various types of U. S. banks, international lending, bank <b>capital</b> <b>format</b> ion, {{the functioning of the}} international interbank markets, the general efficiency of resource allocation, and the "fairness" of assessment allocations. These arguments depend critically on assumptions about the incidence of an extension of the FDIC assessment.; The arguments are individually evaluated under assumptions about likely incidence effects on loan and deposit customers in a three sector [...] money center banks, foreign banks, and regional and smaller banks [...] collar banking system. In general, assuming all loan and deposit schedules are somewhat but not perfectly elastic in the neighborhood of equilibrium, the likely effects of an extension of the FDIC assessment can be summarized as follows: (1) slight increase in domestic deposit rates and volumes of U. S. and foreign-chartered banks; (2) slight decline in foreign branch deposit rates and volumes of U. S. -chartered and insured banks; (3) slight increase in deposit rates and volumes at foreign offices of foreign-chartered banks; (4) slight increase in interbank rates; and (5) slight increases in loan rates and a slight decline in the aggregate loan volume of the dollar banking system. The distribution of the decline in aggregate volume would depend on the elasticities of various Loan demand functions. It is also likely that the total deposits of the dollar banking system would decline slightly. The sectoral distribution of this effect would again depend on the elasticities of demand schedules.

5000|$|In June 1982, Billboard Magazine {{reported}} that WJR-FM's owner, Capital Cities Communications, had hired consultant Mike Joseph to implement his widely successful [...] "Hot Hits" [...] format on WJR-FM {{by the fall}} of that year, taking note of the success the format was having in Philadelphia (WCAU-FM) and in Chicago (WBBM-FM). In July 1982, WJR-FM applied to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for a call letter change to WHYT. The call letter change was approved on August 16, 1982, and, oddly, the new calls coexisted with the station's beautiful music <b>format.</b> (<b>Capital</b> Cities/ABC tried to assure fans of the beautiful music format that the easy listening was not going away and that the “HYT” calls stood for “height” (as in “the height of beautiful music”)- which obviously was a lie, as even Billboard had confirmed the format change by then.) ...|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates a {{comprehensive}} assessment of firm strategic behav-ior under financial market uncertainty. A general theoretical model of market value maximization (MVM) is constructed using a traditional <b>capital</b> asset pric-ing <b>format.</b> The model {{built on the}} nonlinear Almost Ideal Demand Systems (AIDS) and structural first-order conditions is developed. By full information maximum likelihood (FIML) estimation, the model evaluates pricing strategies in the U. S. margarine and butter retail markets using 4 -week interval scanner data from 1998 to 2002. The model of profit maximization is rejected {{in favor of the}} MVM structure, and it indicates that financial market uncertainty {{plays an important role in}} the pricing behavior in this industry. The Vuong and Wald tests suggest the best fitted market structure is the conjectural variations model in which each brand operates non-collusively in price. We estimate the price elasticities of demand for leading brands and investigate the degree of market power in this industry...|$|R
40|$|This paper compares Canadian central {{government}} budget forecasting with forecasting by other industrial countries. While fiscal forecasting in Canada {{is governed by}} one of the strongest institutional frameworks, quantitative analysis suggests that budget projections of macroeconomic and fiscal aggregates have been more cautious than in other countries since the mid- 1990 s. The relatively volatile macroeconomic environment as well as institutional factors, such as Canada''s asymmetric deficit target, have likely contributed to this outcome.
