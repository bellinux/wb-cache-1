In addition, there was a no-respirator ensemble (PROTECTIVE COVERALLS-noR), and WORK CLOTHES as a reference ensemble.

Type classification is offered for garments, gloves, footwear, and eye/face protection devices. On the basis of multiple, but simply designed flowcharts, the type of BCPC appropriate for specific biological and chemical hazards can be selected.

40|$|Objective Explosive {{ordnance}} disposal (EOD) {{often requires}} technicians to wear multiple protective garments in challenging environmental conditions.

40|$|The {{permeation}} {{resistance of}} chlorinated polyethylene (CPE) used in <b>chemical</b> <b>protective</b> clothing against the aerospace fuels hydrazine, monomethylhydrazine (MMH), and uns-dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) {{was determined by}} measuring breakthrough times and time-averaged vapor transmission rates using an ASTM F 739 permeation cell. Two exposure scenarios were simulated: a 2 hour (h) fuel vapor exposure, and a liquid fuel "splash" followed by a 2 h vapor exposure. To simulate internal suit pressure during operation, a positive differential pressure of 0. 3 in. water (75 Pa) on the collection side of the permeation apparatus was used. Breakthrough was observed after exposure to liquid MMH, and to vapor and liquid UDMH. No breakthrough was observed after exposure to vapor and liquid hydrazine, or vapor MMH. A model was then used to calculate propellant concentrations inside a totally encapsulating <b>chemical</b> <b>protective</b> suit based on the ASTM permeation data obtained in the present study. Concentrations were calculated under conditions of fixed vapor transmission rate, variable breathing air flow rate, and variable splash exposure area. Calculations showed that the maximum allowable permeation rates of hydrazine fuels through CPE were {{of the order of}} 0. 05 to 0. 08 ng sq cm/min for encapsulating suits with low breathing air flow rates (of the order of 5 scfm or 140 L/min).

Eight males underwent twelve experimental conditions: two activities (rest and exercise) ?? three clothing levels [Control, HDPE (high-density polyethylene coverall) and PVC (polyvinyl chloride coverall) condition] ?? two air temperatures (25 and 32 ??? with 50 %RH). The results showed that 1) in the conditions with most heat strain (HDPE or PVC condition at 32 ???), IR Tty was equal to or even higher than Tre; 2) during exercise, physiological strain index (PSI) using IR Tty did not underestimate PSI-values using Tre- 16, and overestimated those PSI-values from Tre- 16 in HDPE and PVC conditions at 32 ???; 3) during exercise, the relationships between IR Tty and heart and total sweat rate were stronger than those between Tre- 16 and heart and total sweat rate.
