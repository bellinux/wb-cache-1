40|$|AbstractWe have phenotypically and molecularly {{analyzed}} the <b>cutlet</b> locus in Drosophila. Homozygous <b>cutlet</b> flies exhibit abnormal {{development of a}} subset of adult tissues, including the eye, wing, and ovary. We show that abnormal development of these tissues {{is due to a}} defect in normal cell growth. Surprisingly, cell growth is affected in all developing precursor tissues in <b>cutlet</b> mutant animals, including those that give rise to phenotypically wild-type adult structures. The <b>cutlet</b> gene encodes a Drosophila homologue of yeast CHL 12 and has similarity to mammalian replication factor C. In addition, <b>cutlet</b> genetically interacts with multiple subunits of Drosophila replication factor C. Our results suggest that the <b>cutlet</b> gene product acts as an accessory factor for DNA replication and has different requirements for the formation of various adult structures during Drosophila development...|$|R
25|$|The main {{difference}} between the old time côtelette de volaille and the modern chicken cutlet Kiev-style is that the elaborate stuffings of the former are replaced by butter. The use of butter for chicken <b>cutlets</b> has been known in Russian cuisine {{at least since the}} invention of the Pozharsky cutlet {{in the first half of}} the 19th century. The Pozharsky <b>cutlets</b> are breaded ground chicken patties for which butter is added to minced meat. This results in an especially juicy and tender consistency. The dish was a widely appraised invention of the 19th-century Russian cuisine which was also adopted by French haute cuisine and subsequently by the international cuisine.|$|E
25|$|Kotlet Mielony Wieprzowy - Is a {{variation}} of meatballs. They are thick, juicy <b>cutlets</b> made with freshly ground pork, bread crumbs, and spices. Often topped with mushrooms, gravy, cooked onions, or fried egg. Served with a fresh salad or Surówka and potatoes.|$|E
25|$|Russian food {{historian}} William Pokhlyobkin {{claimed that}} chicken Kiev {{was invented in}} 1912 as Novo-Mikhailovskaya kotleta in а St. Petersburg Merchants' Club located near the Mikhailovsky palace, and was renamed kotleta po-kiyevski in 1947 by a Soviet restaurant. However, these claims collide with primary sources. The cookbook by Alexandrova-Ignatieva (including editions before and after 1912) describes indeed Novo-Mikhailovsky <b>cutlets</b> and mentions that they were invented in the club near the Mikhailovsky palace. However, in the provided recipe these <b>cutlets</b> are made from minced meat similarly to the Pozharsky cutlet, with the only difference being the meat pounded by a tenderizer until it gets minced. This allows one to remove tendons from the meat and results in a more tender consistency of the ground meat than after {{the use of a}} grinder. The author also remarks that not only breasts but also other parts of chicken can be prepared this way and added to the mixture of meat and butter.|$|E

50|$|Breaded <b>cutlet</b> is a dish {{made from}} coating a <b>cutlet</b> of meat with {{breading}} or batter and either frying or baking it. Breaded <b>cutlet</b> {{is known as}} schnitzel in German-speaking countries, cotoletta or scaloppine in Italy, escalope in France, filete empanado in Spain, milanesa in Latin America, katsu in Japan and Korea, and kotlet in Poland.|$|R
25|$|Kotlety (minced <b>cutlets,</b> meatballs), {{are small}} pan-fried meat balls, not {{dissimilar}} from Salisbury steak {{and other such}} dishes. Made primarily from pork and beef (sometimes also from chicken or fish), they are easily made and require little time. Ground beef, pork, onions and bread are put {{in a bowl and}} mixed thoroughly until it becomes relatively consistent. Once this effect is achieved, balls are formed and then put into a hot frying pan to cook.|$|E
25|$|Popular Ashkenazi {{dishes are}} matzo brei (crumbled matzo with grated onion, fried with {{scrambled}} egg), matzo latkes (pancakes) and chremslach (also called crimsel or gresjelies; matzo meal fritters). Wined matzo kugels (pudding) {{have been introduced}} into modern Jewish cooking. For thickening soups and sauces at Passover fine matzo meal or potato flour is used instead of flour: for frying fish or <b>cutlets,</b> a coating of matzo meal and egg, and for stuffing, potatoes instead of soaked bread.|$|E
25|$|Since the 18th century Russian chefs {{have adopted}} many {{techniques}} of French haute cuisine and combined {{them with the}} local culinary tradition. The adoption was furthered by the French chefs, such as Marie-Antoine Carême and Urbain Dubois, who were hired by Russian gentry. In particular the use of quality meat cuts, such as various <b>cutlets,</b> steaks, escalopes and suprêmes became widespread in the 19th century, {{and a number of}} original dishes involving such cuts were developed in Russia at that time.|$|E
50|$|The {{use of the}} <b>cutlet</b> (cotoletta) {{is quite}} {{widespread}} in Italian cuisine in many different variations. The most famous variant is the Milanese <b>cutlet</b> (cotoletta alla milanese), a veal <b>cutlet</b> covered in bread crumbs and fried in butter. It should not be mistaken for the Wiener schnitzel (which should be referred as a scaloppina alla viennese, or as fettina impanata in Italian), because it's a different cut of meat; the Milanese <b>cutlet</b> cut includes the bone, whereas the Wienerschnitzel doesn't. It is disputed whether the cotoletta alla milanese originated the Wienerschnitzel, or vice versa.|$|R

5000|$|Kotlet schabowy [...] is a Polish {{variety of}} pork breaded <b>cutlet</b> coated with {{breadcrumbs}} similar to Viennese schnitzel, but made of pork tenderloin (with the bone or without), or with pork chop.

25|$|In the {{classical}} preparation of French côtelettes de volaille, the humerus bone {{of the wing}} is left attached. This also holds for their Russian versions and in particular for chicken Kiev. For serving, the bone is usually covered with a frilled paper napkin. However, industrially produced pure fillets are often used nowadays, and the <b>cutlets</b> are served without the bone. This is the usual way of serving chicken Kiev in the US. A spherically shaped version was developed by English chef Jesse Dunford Wood.|$|E
25|$|Margaret, Rita and Bona battled {{it out in}} an Asian themed heat. Mags' {{signature}} dish {{was called}} Chicken a'la Mags, a chicken and vegetable feast with coconut cream and Asian flavours. Rita's dish was marinated lamb <b>cutlets</b> with Italian influences. Bona pulled out the big guns with his tender loin steak and tropical BBQ sauce. It was a concern of Mark's that Bona might frighten young children if he was to host a show. Even though Mags struggled with the screen test and has no formal cooking training, she was declared the winner of heat 2 and Rita was granted a wild card.|$|E

During {{the third week}} of September, the Tri-State Fair & Rodeo brings {{participants}} mostly from Oklahoma, New Mexico and Texas to Amarillo since 1921. On the Tri-State Exposition grounds, the Amarillo National Center is a special events center for events ranging from national equestrian competitions to motor sports and rodeos. The World Championship Ranch Rodeo sponsored by the Working Ranch Cowboys Association is held every November in the Amarillo Civic Center. Amarillo hosts the annual World Championship Chuckwagon Roundup the first weekend in June. Teams in competition prepare a feast of breaded beef <b>cutlets,</b> mashed potatoes, baked beans, and sourdough biscuits and attempt to duplicate the food served on western cattle trails of the 1860s and 1870s. The [...] on Bull Road holds a free-to-the-public cattle auction on Tuesdays.

5000|$|Traditional recipes {{call for}} a <b>cutlet</b> of veal with [...] "bone-in" [...] that is breaded and fried in butter. The butter is then poured over the <b>cutlet</b> before being served.

500|$|Many {{supposedly}} traditional English {{dishes are}} relatively new {{and can be}} dated to the century, and sometimes to the year, of their introduction. Thus piccalilli was introduced from India in the 18th century, as recorded by Hannah Glasse who gave a recipe for it in 1758. Conversely, dishes and sauces still considered foreign, such as fish in sweet and sour sauce, have been in English recipe books since the Middle Ages. Other dishes took their present form only gradually, as with the so-called [...] "Full English breakfast". Breakfasts of this kind are indeed described in later editions of [...] "Mrs Beeton", but as one of many variations. Thus her list of [...] "Family Breakfasts for a Week in Winter" [...] has for Wednesday something that looks fairly modern: [...] "bread, muffins, butter, brawn, grilled bacon, boiled eggs"; but on other days less modern-looking breakfasts include mince, mutton <b>cutlets,</b> grilled kidneys, baked fresh herrings, and hash of cold game or poultry, while suggestions for [...] "Family Breakfasts for a Week in Summer" [...] included sardine toast, cold tongue, kedgeree and rissoles, and [...] "Guests' Breakfast (Autumn)" [...] included cold pheasant, game pie, and pressed beef.|$|E
500|$|The English {{common name}} of L.canarium is [...] "dog conch"; in the Malay Peninsula, {{the species is}} known by the Malay common names siput gonggong and gong-gong; siput means [...] "snail", and gonggong is an onomatopoetic word for a dog's bark or howl. The flesh of the dog conch is edible. It is a staple food for locals living along the seashore, and is fished {{in many parts of}} {{southeast}} Asia. In India {{it has been reported that}} the meat of this species works well in a variety of common Indian seafood dishes: dog conch soups, <b>cutlets,</b> noodles, curry and chili. Despite their ornamental value, L.canarium shells are traditionally used by local fishermen as sinkers for fishing nets. Studies from 2008 to 2009 indicate that L.canarium has been overexploited and overfished in many areas; malacologists and ecologists have recommended reducing exploitation rates to maintain its availability as a natural resource. Finding large dog-conch individuals has become an increasingly difficult task in several regions where this species occurs. Initiatives in the Southern Thailand province of Phuket intend to increase depleted natural stocks of L.canarium by reintroducing cultured animals in local seagrass beds. Fishermen are encouraged not to collect younger, smaller individuals that have not yet reproduced.|$|E
500|$|Borscht's westward {{expansion}} {{was less}} successful; Germans used to scoff at the soup {{along with other}} East European fare. What helped familiarize Western Europe with borscht was the practice of Russian emperors, as well as Russian and Polish aristocrats, to employ celebrated French chefs, who later presented their own versions of the dish as a foreign curiosity back in France. One of the first French chefs to do so was , who worked briefly for Emperor Alexander I in 1819. In his take on borscht, the original Russian soup served only as inspiration for an extravagant [...] dish {{with an air of}} eastern exoticism. Apart from vegetables and beet sour, his recipe calls for a roast chicken, a fried chicken, a duck, a piece of veal, an oxtail, a marrow bone, one pound of bacon, and six large sausages, and suggests serving with beef quenelles, deviled eggs and croûtons. , 's apprentice, who was mostly fascinated by the soup's vivid ruby-red color, simplified his master's recipe, while also securing the place of [...] ("borscht soup") in French cuisine.

In 1867, beetroot borscht was served, along with herrings, sturgeon, coulibiac, Pozharsky <b>cutlets</b> and vinaigrette salad, at a Russian-themed dinner at the International Exposition in Paris, strengthening its international association with Russian culture.|$|E
