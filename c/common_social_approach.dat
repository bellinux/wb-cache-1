40|$|In recent years, social {{networks}} have {{become one of}} the best ways to access information. The ease with which users connect to each other and the opportunity provided by Twitter and other social tools in order to follow person activities are increasing the use of such platforms for gathering information. The amount of available digital data is the core of the new challenges we now face. Social recommender systems can suggest both relevant content and users with <b>common</b> <b>social</b> interests. Our <b>approach</b> relies on a signal-based model, which explicitly includes a time dimension in the representation of the user interests. Specifically, this model takes advantage of a signal processing technique, namely, the wavelet transform, for defining an efficient pattern-based similarity function among users. Experimental comparisons with other approaches show the benefits of the proposed approach...|$|R
40|$|Introduction of {{a health}} {{insurance}} scheme {{is one of the}} ways to enhance access to health care services and to protect individuals from catastrophic health expenditures. Little is known on the influence of socio-demographic and social marketing strategies on enrollment and re-enrollment in the Community Health Fund/Tiba Kwa Kadi (CHF/TIKA) in Tanzania.; This cross-sectional study employed quantitative methods for data collection between November 2014 and March 2015 in Singida and Shinyanga regions. Relationship between variables was obtained through Chi-square test and multivariate logistic regression.; We recruited 496 participants in the study. Majority (92. 7 %) of participants consented to participate, with 229 (49. 8 %) and 231 (50. 2 %) members and non members of CHF/TIKA respectively. Majority (90. 9 %) were aware of CHF/TIKA. Majority of CHF/TIKA members and non-members (90 % and 68. 3 % respectively) reported health facility-based sensitization as the most <b>common</b> <b>social</b> marketing <b>approach</b> employed to market the CHF/TIKA. The most popular marketing strategies in the country including traditional dances, football games, radio, television, news papers, and mosques/church were reported by few CHF and non CHF members. Multivariate Logistic regression models revealed no significant association between social marketing strategies and enrollment, but only socio-demographics; including marital status (AOR[*]=[*] 2. 0, 95 % CI 1. 1 - 3. 8) and family size (household with[*]≥[*] 6 members) (AOR[*]=[*] 1. 5, 95 % CI 1. 0 - 2. 5), were significant factors associated with enrollment/re-enrollment rate.; This study indicated that low level of utilization of available social marketing strategies and socio-demographic factors are the barriers for attracting members to join the schemes. There is a need for applying various social marketing strategies and considering different facilitating and impending socio-demographic factors for the growth and sustainability of the scheme as we move towards universal health coverage...|$|R

During baseline, confederate peers made few <b>social</b> <b>approaches</b> {{to the target}} subjects. Confederates greatly increased their rate of <b>social</b> <b>approaches</b> during the first intervention, decreased <b>social</b> <b>approaches</b> during a second baseline, and increased <b>social</b> <b>approaches</b> again in a second intervention phase.

Additionally, five of six subjects showed an increase in their own positive social initiations during intervention periods. The results suggest that: (a) peers may be programmed to increase the positive social behaviors of their isolate classmates, and (b) remediating social deficits requires assessment and intervention specifically tailored to the individual child...|$|R

Unfortunately, 70 million Americans suffer from chronic sleep loss or sleep disorders. Secondary causes of sleep disorders are often overlooked and can occur from the consumption of social or medicinal drugs. <b>Common</b> <b>social</b> drugs that can disrupt sleep include alcohol, caffeine, and nicotine.

40|$|Children {{diagnosed}} with autism show marked impairments {{in social and}} communicative behaviors. According to social motivation and social orienting models of autism, decreased social interest leads to less social input and fewer social learning opportunities (Chevallier et al., 2012; Mundy 2 ̆ 6 Neal, 2001). These models suggest {{that the ability to}} initiate and participate in social interactions are important factors in language development. Research in this area has focused on the role of joint attention in language development however; the current study takes a broad view of social interest and posits that not only joint attention, but all socially mediated behaviors are important in language development. The aim of the current study was (1) to evaluate a novel behavioral-coding scheme of <b>social</b> <b>approach</b> behaviors and (2) evaluate the relationship between <b>social</b> <b>approach</b> behaviors and language development. The <b>social</b> <b>approach</b> coding scheme used frequency counts of seven social behaviors emitted during an administration of the ADOS. These behaviors were coded as being either initiated by the child or occurring in response to the parent or examiner, however, no distinction was {{made on the basis of}} on the function of the behavior. <b>Social</b> <b>approach</b> rates gleaned using this novel coding scheme were correlated with existing measures of social motivation suggesting that <b>social</b> <b>approach</b> coding is capturing a similar construct as those of existing measures. <b>Social</b> <b>approach</b> rates were also used to evaluate the relationship between social behaviors and language development. The results indicated that both social initiations and social responses are important in language development. Overall, children with higher rates of both social initiations and social responses showed increased scores on language measures. The coding scheme presented provides an alternative way to quantify behaviors on the ADOS that may be used in treatment development and assessment. Given the relationship between <b>social</b> <b>approach</b> rates and language development, using this coding scheme may provide a way to determine those behaviors that are most challenging for a child so that they can be targeted in intervention to facilitate not only their social development but also language acquisition...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{presentation}} is to demonstrate an application of Living with Aphasia: Framework for Outcome Measurement (A-FROM) {{to the analysis of}} evidence for <b>social</b> <b>approaches</b> to the management of aphasia. There has been a concerted effort within aphasiology to promote evidenced based practice (EBP) as reflected in the Evidence Based Practice Guidelines being developed by the Academy of Neurologic Communication Disorders and Sciences (ANCDS) in collaboration with ASHA Special Interest Division 2 (SID 2) and the Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA) (Golper et al., 2001). In line with this move towards evidence based practice, a meeting involving aphasia researchers was conducted in 2007 to discuss the evidence available for what has variously been called the <b>social</b> <b>approach,</b> consequences approach or functional approach to aphasia (as defined in Martin, Thompson & Worrall, 2007). Prior to the meeting, group members conducted a search of the literature to identify evidence associated with <b>social</b> <b>approaches</b> to aphasia. Attempts were made to organize the data consistent with the existing Aphasia EBP Guidelines (Beeson et al. in progress), but difficulty was encountered. Studies associated with a <b>social</b> <b>approach</b> could not be easily classified based on the categories of treatment currently targeted by the Aphasia EBP Guideline...|$|R
40|$|Two diary studies {{investigated}} {{the role of}} <b>social</b> <b>approach</b> and avoidance motivation in important developmental transitions in young and old adulthood. Study 1 comprised a sample of young adults (N = 93, M = 21. 5 years) who moved out of their parental homes. The sample of Study 2 consisted of older adults (N = 69, M = 76. 95 years) who moved into senior housing. In both studies, participants reported their habitual <b>social</b> <b>approach</b> and avoidance motives {{as well as their}} daily social experience and subjective well-being over the course of two weeks. In line with the literature, <b>social</b> <b>approach</b> motives and age were related to higher subjective well-being, whereas social avoidance motives were negatively associated with subjective well-being. Time since the transition was an important moderator of the association between social avoidance motives and negative outcomes. With increasing time from the transition, the negative effects of social avoidance motives decreased. The positive effects of <b>social</b> <b>approach</b> motives remained fairly stable over time. Importantly, age did not moderate any of the associations between social motivation and outcomes. Results are discussed in terms of transition-related instability and age-related stability...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{behavioral}} {{research suggests}} that there is a sex-specific effect for <b>social</b> <b>approach</b> behaviors in mice. Females will approach familiar female cagemates who are expressing pain-related behaviors. In contrast, females do not approach unfamiliar mice expressing similar behaviors. This approach pattern indicates that familiarity {{is an important factor in}} predicting <b>social</b> <b>approach</b> behaviors in female mice. Males do not exhibit this type of social behavior. Furthermore, female mice are known to engage in a variety of social and maternal behaviors towards their genetic offspring, and unrelated mice pups. Therefore, varying degrees of familiarity, such as biological relatedness and maternal relationships may elicit different <b>social</b> <b>approach</b> patterns in females. This study investigated the ways in which maternalrelatedness and familiarity with mice pups expressing pain-related behaviors affected <b>social</b> <b>approach</b> behaviors in adult female mice. We grouped mothers and their offspring into five different categories based on familiarity and relatedness. We tested each female in a double approach paradigm, with two pups that she reared, gave birth to, or a pup she had no prior contact or relationship with. In each trial, mesh wire confined a pup not in pain and a pup in pain at opposite ends of the testing apparatus. We then placed the female in the middle of the apparatus and recorded her proximity to each pup for a set time. After recording and analyzing multiple tests and conditions, we found that familiarity, relatedness, and the genders of the pups tested with, affected <b>social</b> <b>approach</b> behaviors towards pups in female mice...|$|R
