5|$|The 2005 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season {{was the most}} active Atlantic {{hurricane season}} in recorded history, shattering numerous records. The impact of the season was widespread and ruinous with an estimated 3,913deaths and damage of about $158.9billion, the second-costliest on record. Of the storms that made landfall, five of the season's seven major hurricanes—Dennis, Emily, Katrina, Rita, and Wilma—were {{responsible for most of}} the destruction. Stan was the most destructive storm that was not a major hurricane. The Mexican states of Quintana Roo and Yucatán and the US states of Florida and Louisiana were each struck twice by major hurricanes; Cuba, the Bahamas, Haiti, Mississippi, Texas, Alabama, and Tamaulipas were each struck once and in each case brushed by at least one more. The most <b>catastrophic</b> <b>effects</b> of the season were felt on the United States' Gulf Coast, where a 30ft (10m) storm surge from Hurricane Katrina caused devastating flooding that destroyed most structures on the Mississippi coastline; subsequent levee failures in New Orleans, Louisiana caused by the storm crippled the city. Furthermore, Hurricane Stan combined with an extratropical system to cause deadly mudslides across Central America, with Guatemala being hardest-hit.|$|E
25|$|Added to this, {{the crises}} of the Catholic church (especially the {{controversy}} over the French Avignon Papacy and the Great Schism) along with the <b>catastrophic</b> <b>effects</b> of the Black Death were to lead to a re-evaluation of medieval values, resultant {{in the development of a}} humanist culture, stimulated by the works of Petrarch and Boccaccio. This prompted a revisitation and study of the classical antiquity, leading to the Renaissance.|$|E
25|$|The {{withdrawal}} had <b>catastrophic</b> <b>effects</b> on the South Vietnamese Army (ARVN). Shortly {{after the}} Paris Peace Accords, the United States Congress made major budget cuts in {{military aid to}} the South Vietnamese. The ARVN, which had been trained by American troops to use American tactics, quickly fell into disarray. Although it remained an effective fighting force throughout 1973 and 1974, by January 1975 it had disintegrated. The North Vietnamese hurriedly attacked the much weakened South, and met with little resistance.|$|E

25|$|Müller’s SPD {{government}} eventually fell as {{a result}} of the <b>catastrophic</b> <b>effects</b> of the Great Depression. Müller’s government, an ideologically diverse “Grand Coalition” representing five parties ranging from the left to the right, was unable to develop effective counter-measures to tackle the <b>catastrophic</b> <b>effects</b> of the economic crisis, as characterised by the massive rise in the numbers of registered unemployed. In 1928–29, 2.5million were estimated to be unemployed, a figure that reached over 3million by the following winter. A major problem facing Müller’s government was a deficit in the Reich budget, which the government spending more than it was receiving. This situation was made worse by the inadequacy of the unemployment scheme which was unable to pay out enough benefits to the rising numbers of unemployed, forcing the government to make contributions to the scheme (which in turn worsened the budget deficit). The coalition was badly divided on this issue, with the SPD wishing to raise the level of contributions to the scheme while safeguarding both those in work and those out of work as much as possible. The right-wing parties, by contrast, wished to reduce unemployment benefits while lightening the tax burden. Unable to garner enough support in the Reichstag to pass laws, Müller turned to Hindenburg for support, wishing him to grant him the use of the emergency powers under Article 48 of the Weimar Constitution so that he did not have to rely on support from the Reichstag.|$|E
25|$|Land use {{change is}} {{fundamental}} to {{the operations of the}} biosphere because alterations in the relative proportions of land dedicated to urbanisation, agriculture, forest, woodland, grassland and pasture have a marked effect on the global water, carbon and nitrogen biogeochemical cycles. Management of the Earth's atmosphere involves assessment of all aspects of the carbon cycle to identify opportunities to address human-induced climate change and this has become a major focus of scientific research because of the potential <b>catastrophic</b> <b>effects</b> on biodiversity and human communities. Ocean circulation patterns have a strong influence on climate and weather and, in turn, the food supply of both humans and other organisms.|$|E
25|$|Finally, the {{mismatch}} repair (MMR) machinery offers inherent protection {{to the cell}} against nucleotide base mismatch. Therefore, any mutations introduced in the oligonucleotides can be targeted by the MMR. There {{are several ways to}} avoid this. First, the use of an E. coli strain that is MMR deficient will eradicate this issue. However, this also results in a higher rate of other random mutations throughout the genome. Another method to reduce mismatch repair is to bury the mutations of interest within other silent mutations. Since silent mutations do not often cause <b>catastrophic</b> <b>effects,</b> they are poorly detected by the MMR machinery. The presence of modified bases will also help to evade the MMR machinery because they are not recognized. Finally, long segments of mutations will be less affected by short segments of mutations.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} of the Leicester-Rugby railway in 1840 had a <b>catastrophic</b> <b>effect</b> on the coaching traffic through the town. A railway did not serve the town until 1850 with a link to Rugby but this was quickly followed by links to Leicester and London in 1857 and to Northampton in 1859.|$|R

50|$|Angola's {{protracted}} war {{has had a}} <b>catastrophic</b> <b>effect</b> on the country's wildlife. Forty years ago, {{thousands of}} animals roamed the fertile bushland of Quiçama. But over the years, the animals fell prey to landmines, ivory-stalking poachers and hungry locals. Many animals were slaughtered by the country's military, which used low-flying helicopters to take pot shots at big game.|$|R
25|$|Following the Treaty of Schönbrunn Tyrol {{was again}} ceded to Bavaria by the Austrian Emperor. On October 21 Bavarian, French and Italian troops {{under the command}} of the Duke Drouet d’Erlon poured into Tyrol, forcing the Tyroleans to retreat to the Bergisel again. As Winter approached, {{supplies}} began to dwindle, and many men left to return to their homes. On 28/29 October, news of the peace treaty that had been signed by Austria reached Tyrol. This had <b>catastrophic</b> <b>effects</b> on the morale of the Tyroleans, and Andreas Hofer, betrayed by his emperor, resorted to drinking. The Tyrolean morale had been broken. On November 1 Drouet d'Erlon had recaptured Innsbruck and the Bergisel, and by 11 November 1809, Tyrol was entirely occupied. Hofer fled into the mountains, and on 5 January 1810 he was betrayed and denounced to the authorities. On 28 January, he, his wife and his son were taken to Bolzano. Napoleon learnt of the capture at the start of February and ordered Hofer to be tried and executed. This order was acted upon soon and Hofer died at the dungeon of the fortress of Mantua on February 20, 1810.|$|E
500|$|At a March 2009 {{meeting of}} the Copenhagen Climate Council, 2,500 climate experts from 80 {{countries}} issued a keynote statement that there is now [...] "no excuse" [...] for failing to act on global warming and that without strong carbon reduction [...] "abrupt or irreversible" [...] shifts in climate may occur that [...] "will {{be very difficult for}} contemporary societies to cope with". Management of the global atmosphere now involves assessment of all aspects of the carbon cycle to identify opportunities to address human-induced climate change and this has become a major focus of scientific research because of the potential <b>catastrophic</b> <b>effects</b> on biodiversity and human communities (see Energy below).|$|E
500|$|As {{originally}} {{proposed in}} 1980 {{by a team}} of scientists led by Luis Alvarez and Walter Alvarez, it is now generally thought that the K–Pg extinction was caused by a massive comet or asteroid impact, estimated to be [...] to [...] wide, 66 million years ago and its <b>catastrophic</b> <b>effects</b> on the global environment, including a lingering impact winter that made it impossible for plants and plankton to carry out photosynthesis. The impact hypothesis, also known as the Alvarez hypothesis, was bolstered by the discovery of the [...] Chicxulub crater in the Gulf of Mexico in the early 1990s, which provided conclusive evidence that the K–Pg boundary clay represented debris from an asteroid impact. The fact that the extinctions occurred {{at the same time as}} the impact provides strong situational evidence that the K–Pg extinction was caused by the asteroid.|$|E

500|$|Romm's 2006 book Hell and High Water {{projects}} that humans have {{a window of}} opportunity of only about a decade to head off the most <b>catastrophic</b> <b>effects</b> of global warming. [...] It calls upon Americans to demand government action to encourage and require the use of current emission-cutting technologies. [...] Tyler Hamilton, in his review of the book for The Toronto Star, wrote: [...] "Whereas the first third of Romm's book presents overwhelming and disturbing evidence that human-caused greenhouse gases are the primary ingredients behind global warming, the pages that follow offer alarming detail on how the U.S. public is being misled by a federal government (backed by conservative political forces) that is intent on inaction, and that's also on a mission to derail international efforts to curb emissions." [...] Technology Review wrote that Hell and High Water [...] "provides an accurate summary of what is known about global warming and climate change, a sensible agenda for technology and policy, and a primer on how political disinformation has undermined climate science." ...|$|E
500|$|Lekson and McKenna {{note that}} {{following}} the rediscovery of Chetro Ketl {{in the early}} 19th century, the building's [...] "pace of dissolution increased alarmingly... has deteriorated {{at a faster rate}} over the last century and a half than in the previous six." [...] Chetro Ketl's wooden elements have proven especially vulnerable in a region that lacks timber, with soldiers, cattlemen, and transients scavenging them from the structure. The rear balcony was present in 1901, but by 1921 the beams had been removed by people scouring the canyon for wood. The process of uncovering beams during excavation has further hastened their deterioration. Chaco Wash, which deepens and widens during summer rain showers, also threatens the canyon's ruins. The once prominent refuse mound has been all but destroyed by repeated trenching and by diverting arroyos near Chetro Ketl. Treasure hunting, livestock grazing, and early National Park Service stabilization efforts also contributed to the degradation of the structure, as have deep excavations that left Chaco Wash prone to flooding. Archeology was responsible for the <b>catastrophic</b> <b>effects</b> of a 1947 flood that destroyed the walls of twenty rooms and collapsed [...] of the north wall. It also toppled Chetro Ketl's tallest remnants.|$|E
