40|$|The {{majority}} of farmers in Sindh province of Pakistan store wheat seed in traditional storage structures. These structures usually increase seed moisture and temperature of storage {{up to the}} levels that favor the proliferation of insects and fungi and results in seed deterioration. Considering the seed storage problem, {{the present study was}} performed. Straw-clay bins retain low moisture conditions for extended storage duration better than conventional bulk <b>covered</b> <b>store.</b> Seed <b>stored</b> in bulk <b>covered</b> <b>store</b> suffered severe deterioration caused by fungi, while straw-clay bins protected seed from these losses. Wheat seed stored for 12 months in straw-clay bins maintained better seed germination percentage, test weight, protein content and ash/mineral content than seed <b>stored</b> in bulk <b>covered</b> <b>store.</b> There was a minimum loss of quality of wheat in straw-clay bin as compare to bulk <b>covered</b> <b>store.</b> Hence, the adoption of the straw-clay bin must be encouraged in the developing countries to save their seeds and goods to reduce the losses as well as raise the food security, poverty alleviation and national economy...|$|R

The <b>store</b> <b>area</b> location 0 - 1 integer-programming model is established with the shortest total picking time as target function, store capacity and picking points as constraint conditions and a heuristic method is provided for calculating. The practical example shows that the proposed method to adjust <b>store</b> <b>area</b> location is reasonable so as to prove the validity of the location adjustment model...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} current issues of spatial data {{modelling}} and management used by spatial management applications. As {{a case study}} for explaining the problem, we use comparison of two main groups of software tools covering this area GIS and CAD systems - and the posibilities of their integration. Studying its functionality, we have found two main problematic issues. The first {{of them is the}} density distribution characteristics of stored data according to described area. CAD systems are oriented towards modeling individual man-made objects and structures with relatively high level of detail, so the data <b>stored</b> <b>covers</b> small <b>areas</b> with huge amount of information. On the other side GIS applications maintain large-scale models of real world with significantly lower amount of detail. Here the density distribution of data coverage is better balanced. So the combination of described different densities is the first problem. The second watched issue is the way of storing spatial data. While CAD data are usually stored in individual files (like DXF, IGES), GIS data tend to be stored in files or realtional databases. The question we see is, if it is possible to store CAD data along with GIS data in the same database in spite of different distribution densities and different data models. Our paper describes ways of solving this problem...|$|R
