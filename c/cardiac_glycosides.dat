5|$|Detzel and Wink (1993) {{published}} an extensive review of 63 types of plant allelochemicals (alkaloids, terpenes, glycosides, etc.) {{and their effects}} on bees when consumed. It was found that 39 chemical compounds repelled bees (primarily alkaloids, coumarins, and saponins) and three terpene compounds attracted bees. They report that 17 out of 29 allelochemicals are toxic at some levels (especially alkaloids, saponins, <b>cardiac</b> <b>glycosides</b> and cyanogenic glycosides).|$|E

25|$|Larvae feed {{exclusively}} on milkweed and consume protective <b>cardiac</b> <b>glycosides.</b> Toxin levels in Asclepias species vary. Not all monarchs are unpalatable, but exhibit Batesian or automimics. <b>Cardiac</b> <b>glycosides</b> levels are {{higher in the}} abdomen and wings. Some predators can differentiate between these parts and consume the most palatable ones. Bird predators include brown thrashers, grackles, robins, cardinals, sparrows, scrub jays, pinyon jays, black-headed grosbeak, and orioles.|$|E
25|$|After the {{caterpillar}} {{becomes a}} butterfly, the toxins shift to {{different parts of}} the body. Since many birds attack the wings of the butterfly, having three times the <b>cardiac</b> <b>glycosides</b> in the wings leaves predators with a very foul taste and may prevent them from ever ingesting the body of the butterfly. In order to combat predators that remove the wings only to ingest the abdomen, monarchs keep the most potent <b>cardiac</b> <b>glycosides</b> in their abdomens.|$|E

25|$|Monarchs are foul tasting and {{poisonous}} due to {{the presence}} of cardenolide aglycones in their bodies, which the caterpillars ingest as they feed on milkweed. By ingesting a large amount of plants in the genus Asclepias, primarily milkweed, monarch caterpillars are able to sequester <b>cardiac</b> <b>glycosides,</b> or more specifically cardenolides, which are steroids that act in heart-arresting ways similar to digitalis. It has been found that monarchs are able to sequester cardenolides most effectively from plants of intermediate cardenolide content rather than those of high or low content.|$|E
50|$|Most Asclepias are toxic if {{consumed}} {{in large quantities}} due to <b>cardiac</b> <b>glycoside</b> content.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{describe}} the cardiac arrhythmias, electrolyte disturbances, and serum <b>cardiac</b> <b>glycoside</b> levels seen in patients presenting to hospital with acute yellow oleander (Thevetia peruviana) poisoning and to compare these with published reports of digitalis poisoning.  DESIGN—Case series.  SETTING—Medical wards of Anuradhapura District General Hospital, Sri Lanka, and {{coronary care unit}} of the Institute of Cardiology, National Hospital of Sri Lanka, Colombo, the national tertiary referral centre for cardiology.  PATIENTS— 351 patients {{with a history of}} oleander ingestion.  MEASUREMENTS—ECG and blood sample analysis on admission.  RESULTS—Most symptomatic patients had conduction defects affecting the sinus node, the atrioventricular (AV) node, or both. Patients showing cardiac arrhythmias that required transfer for specialised management had significantly higher mean serum <b>cardiac</b> <b>glycoside</b> and potassium but not magnesium concentrations. Although there was considerable overlap between groups, those with conduction defects affecting both sinus and AV nodes had significantly higher mean serum <b>cardiac</b> <b>glycoside</b> levels.  CONCLUSIONS—Most of these young previously healthy patients had conduction defects affecting the sinus or AV nodes. Relatively few had the atrial or ventricular tachyarrhythmias or ventricular ectopic beats that are typical of digoxin poisoning. Serious yellow oleander induced arrhythmias were associated with higher serum <b>cardiac</b> <b>glycoside</b> concentrations and hyperkalaemia but not with disturbances of magnesium.    Keywords: oleander poisoning; arrhythmias; <b>cardiac</b> <b>glycoside...</b>|$|R

25|$|Several {{species of}} birds have {{acquired}} methods {{that allow them to}} ingest monarchs without experiencing the ill effects associated with the <b>cardiac</b> <b>glycosides.</b> The oriole is able to eat the monarch through an exaptation of its feeding behavior that gives it the ability to identify cardenolides by taste and reject them. The grosbeak, on the other hand, has developed an insensitivity to secondary plant poisons that allows it to ingest monarchs without vomiting. As a result, orioles and grosbeaks will periodically have high levels of cardenolides in their bodies, and they will be forced to go on periods of reduced monarch consumption. This cycle effectively reduces potential predation of monarchs by 50 percent and indicates that monarch aposematism has a legitimate purpose.|$|E

2500|$|Many species retain distasteful or {{poisonous}} chemicals {{acquired from}} their host plants. Some species {{also have the}} ability to make their own defenses (Nishida, 2002). Common defenses include: <b>cardiac</b> <b>glycosides</b> (or cardenolides), pyrrolizidine alkaloids, pyrazines and histamines. Larvae usually acquire these chemicals, and may retain them in the adult stage. But adults can acquire them, too, by regurgitating decomposing plants containing the compounds and sucking up the fluid. Adults can transfer the defenses to their eggs, and males sometimes transfer them to females to help with defense of the eggs. Larval [...] "hairs" [...] may be stinging in some species, due to histamines their caterpillar makes.|$|E

2500|$|Plant {{chemical}} defenses {{can be used}} by herbivores, by storing eaten plant chemicals, {{and using}} them in defense against predators. To be effective defensive agents, the sequestered chemicals cannot be metabolized into inactive products. [...] Using plant chemicals can be costly to herbivores because it often requires specialized handling, storage, and modification. This cost can be seen when plants that use chemical defenses are compared to those plants that do not, in situations when herbivores are excluded. [...] Several species of insects sequester and deploy plant chemicals for their own defense. Caterpillar and adult monarch butterflies store <b>cardiac</b> <b>glycosides</b> from milkweed, making these organisms distasteful. [...] After eating a monarch caterpillar or butterfly, the bird predator will usually vomit, leading the bird to avoid eating similar looking butterflies in the future. Two different species of milkweed bug in the family Hemiptera, Lygaeus kalmii and large milkweed bug (Oncopeltus fasciatus), are colored with bright orange and black, and are said to be aposematically colored, in that they [...] "advertise" [...] their distastefulness by being brightly colored.|$|E
2500|$|Cedric Stanton Hicks, Professor of {{physiology}} and pharmacology at the University of Adelaide, testified {{that of a}} group of drugs, variants of a drug in that group he called [...] "number 1" [...] and in particular [...] "number 2" [...] were extremely toxic in a relatively small oral dose that would be extremely difficult if not impossible to identify even if it had been suspected in the first instance. He gave the coroner a piece of paper with the names of the two drugs which was entered as Exhibit C.18. The names were not released to the public until the 1980s as at the time they were [...] "quite easily procurable by the ordinary individual" [...] from a chemist without the need to give a reason for the purchase. (The drugs were later publicly identified as digitalis and ouabain, both of which are cardenolide-type <b>cardiac</b> <b>glycosides).</b> He noted the only [...] "fact" [...] not found in relation to the body was evidence of vomiting. He then stated its absence was not unknown but that he could not make a [...] "frank conclusion" [...] without it. Hicks stated that if death had occurred seven hours after the man was last seen to move, it would imply a massive dose that could still have been undetectable. It was noted that the movement seen by witnesses at 7 p.m. could have been the last convulsion preceding death.|$|E
