5|$|On October 23 Biden {{revealed}} his health <b>care</b> <b>plan.</b> It called for expanded coverage {{for children and}} adults but stops short of mandates for complete universal coverage. It aimed to encourage wellness and modernization of treatment. Biden stated it would cost between $80billion and $110billion per year. He said it could have been paid with a rollback of tax cuts of the richest 1% bracket, capital gains and dividends and the elimination of tax loopholes for hedge fund managers and private equity partners. The plan would also had increased the SCHIP program to include children 300% above the poverty level.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, Pittston {{still felt}} {{the strain of}} {{providing}} benefits, with the cost per miner increasing by $3,746 from the 1979 amount. The company was still going into debt and having a difficult time paying for the miners' benefits. To avoid losing more money, Pittston doubled health deductibles, lowered the coverage from 100% to 80%, and discontinued benefits to miners who retired before 1974. This change in the health <b>care</b> <b>plan</b> was still not enough {{for the company to}} gain a profit, so they decided to keep the mines running 24hours a day and seven days a week, with no overtime for the workers. Pittston also did away with successorship clauses, which meant that the miners of Pittston would not have job security or transfer of job rights in mines that were leased or sold. Miners were now working longer hours with more expensive health care plans, while the mine was losing no production time because it was never closed.|$|E
5|$|On September 22, 1993, Clinton {{made a major}} {{speech to}} Congress {{regarding}} a health care reform plan; the program aimed at achieving universal coverage through a national health <b>care</b> <b>plan.</b> This {{was one of the}} most prominent items on Clinton's legislative agenda and resulted from a task force headed by Hillary Clinton. The plan was well received in political circles, but it was eventually doomed by well-organized lobby opposition from conservatives, the American Medical Association, and the health insurance industry. However, Clinton biographer John F. Harris stated that the program failed because of a lack of coordination within the White House. Despite the Democratic majority in Congress, the effort to create a national health care system ultimately died when compromise legislation by George J. Mitchell failed to gain a majority of support in August 1994. The failure of the bill was the first major legislative defeat of the Clinton administration.|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the success of}} a programme of Advance <b>Care</b> <b>Planning</b> education for nursing homes by examining the effect on staff knowledge, Advance <b>Care</b> <b>Planning</b> practice within the home and end-of-life hospital admission rates. METHOD: Three longitudinal questionnaires assessing staff knowledge, Advance <b>Care</b> <b>Planning</b> Practice and hospital deaths completed before and after the initiation of the Advance <b>Care</b> <b>Planning</b> education programme by homes that had completed the training and those yet to undergo the training. RESULTS: Superior Advance <b>Care</b> <b>Planning</b> knowledge was evident in those staff that had completed the training. There was an increase of 85 % in the number of Advance <b>Care</b> <b>Plans</b> completed in the training homes and an overall reduction in hospital deaths of 25 % for residents from training homes. CONCLUSION: A programme of Advance <b>Care</b> <b>Planning</b> education for nursing homes is successful in improving nursing home staff knowledge, increasing Advance <b>Care</b> <b>Planning</b> practice and reducing hospital deaths...|$|R
40|$|Background In the UK, {{the use of}} <b>care</b> <b>planning</b> {{and written}} <b>care</b> <b>plans</b> has been {{proposed}} to improve the management of long-term conditions, yet there is limited evidence concerning their uptake and benefits. Aim To explore the implementation of <b>care</b> <b>plans</b> and <b>care</b> <b>planning</b> in the UK and associations with the process and outcome of care. Design and setting A controlled prospective cohort study among two groups of patients with long-term conditions who were similar in demographic and clinical characteristics, but who were registered with general practices varying in their implementation of <b>care</b> <b>plans</b> and <b>care</b> <b>planning.</b> Method Implementation of <b>care</b> <b>plans</b> and <b>care</b> <b>planning</b> in general practice was assessed using the 2009 – 2010 GP Patient Survey, and relationships with patient outcomes (self-management and vitality) were examined using multilevel, mixed effects linear regression modelling. Results The study recruited 38 practices and 2439 patients. Practices {{in the two groups}} (high and low users of written documents) were similar in structural and population characteristics. Patients in the two groups of practices were similar in demographics and baseline health. Patients did demonstrate significant differences in reported experiences of <b>care</b> <b>planning,</b> although the differences were modest. Very few patients in the cohort reported a written plan that could be confirmed. Analysis of outcomes suggested that most patients show limited change over time in vitality and self-management. Variation in the use of <b>care</b> <b>plans</b> at the practice level was very limited and not related to patient outcomes over time. Conclusion The use of written <b>care</b> <b>plans</b> in patients with long-term conditions is uncommon and unlikely to explain a substantive amount of variation in the process and outcome of care. More proactive efforts at implementation may be required to provide a rigorous test of the potential of <b>care</b> <b>plans</b> and <b>care</b> <b>planning...</b>|$|R

5|$|With no presidential ambitions left, Kennedy {{formed a}} good {{relationship}} with Democratic President Bill Clinton upon the latter taking office in 1993, despite his having initially backed former fellow Massachusetts Senator Paul Tsongas in the 1992 Democratic presidential primaries. Kennedy floor-managed successful passage of Clinton's National and Community Service Trust Act of 1993 that created the AmeriCorps program, and despite reservations supported the president on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). On the issue Kennedy cared most about, national health insurance, he supported but was not much involved in formation of the Clinton health <b>care</b> <b>plan,</b> which was run by First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and others. It failed badly and damaged the prospects for such legislation for years to come. In 1994, Kennedy's strong recommendation of his former Judiciary Committee staffer Stephen Breyer played a role in Clinton appointing Breyer to the U.S. Supreme Court. During 1994 Kennedy became the first senator with a home page on the World Wide Web; the product of an effort with the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, it helped counter the image of Kennedy as old and out of touch.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{understand}} how multidisciplinary <b>care</b> <b>plans</b> {{are being used}} in the management of patients with diabetes, and to explore the role of collaboration in <b>care</b> <b>planning.</b> Design: Grounded theory interview study. Setting: Primary care, June 2005 to October 2006. Participants: Thirty-eight people from three New South Wales Divisions of General Practice: 19 general practitioners, eight diabetes-related allied health providers, two endocrinologists, and nine adults with type 2 diabetes. Sampling was purposeful then theoretical. Results: GPs use <b>care</b> <b>plans</b> to organise clinical care and help patients access allied health providers. Written plans are used to educate patients about their care and to motivate change. GPs rarely discuss <b>care</b> <b>plans</b> with other providers, and providers are unlikely to change their approach to patients on the basis of <b>care</b> <b>plans.</b> Patients do not expect to participate in <b>care</b> <b>planning.</b> Conclusions: <b>Care</b> <b>planning</b> may increase evidence-based multidisciplinary care for patients with diabetes, but it rarely results in genuine collaboration between providers and patients. This suggests a difference may exist between Australian policymakers’ and providers’ definitions of patients with complex needs. <b>Care</b> <b>plans</b> could facilitate patient self-management by including more personalised information.

40|$|Background: Advance <b>care</b> <b>planning</b> {{comprises}} {{discussions about}} an individual’s wishes for future care {{while they have}} capacity. Aim: To explore professionals’ experiences on the implementation of advance <b>care</b> <b>planning</b> in two areas of clinical care, dementia and palliative care. Design: Qualitative study, focus groups and individual interviews. Setting: North East of England. Sample: Ninety-five participants from one Primary Care Trust, two acute National Health Service Hospital Trusts, one Ambulance Trust, one Local Authority and voluntary organisations and the legal sector. Results: Fourteen focus groups and 18 interviews were held with 95 participants. While professionals agreed that advance <b>care</b> <b>planning</b> {{was a good idea}} in theory, implementation in practice presented them with significant challenges. The majority expressed uncertainty over the general value of advance <b>care</b> <b>planning,</b> whether current service provision could meet patient wishes, their individual roles and responsibilities and which aspects of advance <b>care</b> <b>planning</b> were legally binding; the array of different advance <b>care</b> <b>planning</b> forms and documentation available added to the confusion. In dementia care, the timing of when to initiate advance <b>care</b> <b>planning</b> discussions was an added challenge. Conclusions: This study has identified the professional, organisational and legal factors that influence advance <b>care</b> <b>planning</b> implementation; professional training should target these specific areas. There is an urgent need for standardisation of advance <b>care</b> <b>planning</b> documentation. Greater clarity is also required on the roles and responsibilities of different professional groups.

40|$|BACKGROUND: It {{has been}} {{established}} that mental health-care planning does not adequately respond {{to the needs of}} those accessing services. Understanding the reasons for this and identifying whose needs <b>care</b> <b>plans</b> serve requires an exploration of the perspectives of service users, carers and professionals within the wider organizational context. OBJECTIVE: To explore the current operationalization of <b>care</b> <b>planning</b> and perceptions of its function within mental health services from the perspectives of multiple stakeholders. SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS: Participants included 21 mental health professionals, 29 service users and 4 carers from seven Mental Health Trusts in England. All participants had experience of <b>care</b> <b>planning</b> processes within secondary mental health-care services. METHODS: Fifty-four semi-structured interviews were conducted with participants and analysed utilizing a qualitative framework approach. FINDINGS: <b>Care</b> <b>plans</b> and <b>care</b> <b>planning</b> were characterized by a failure to meet the complexity of mental health needs, and <b>care</b> <b>planning</b> processes were seen to prioritize organizational agendas and risk prevention which distanced <b>care</b> <b>planning</b> from the everyday lives of service users. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: <b>Care</b> <b>planning</b> is recognized, embedded and well established in the practices of mental health professionals and service users. However, it is considered too superficial and mainly irrelevant to users for managing mental health in their everyday lives. Those responsible for the planning and delivery of mental health services should consider ways to increase the relevance of <b>care</b> <b>planning</b> to the everyday lives of service users including separating risk from holistic needs assessment, using support aids and utilizing a peer workforce in this regard...|$|R

40|$|Background: Advance <b>Care</b> <b>Planning</b> is an {{iterative}} process of discussion, decision-making and documentation about end-of-life <b>care.</b> Advance <b>Care</b> <b>Planning</b> is highly relevant in palliative care due to intersecting clinical needs. To enhance {{the implementation of}} Advance <b>Care</b> <b>Planning,</b> the contextual factors influencing its uptake need to be better understood. Aim: To identify the contextual factors influencing the uptake of Advance <b>Care</b> <b>Planning</b> in palliative <b>care</b> as published between January 2008 and December 2012. Methods: Databases were systematically searched for studies about Advance <b>Care</b> <b>Planning</b> in palliative <b>care</b> published between January 2008 and December 2012. This yielded 27 eligible studies, which were appraised using National Institute of Health and Care Excellence Quality Appraisal Checklists. Iterative thematic synthesis was used to group results. Results: Factors associated with greater uptake included older age, a college degree, a diagnosis of cancer, greater functional impairment, being white, greater understanding of poor prognosis and receiving or working in specialist palliative care. Barriers included having non-malignant diagnoses, having dependent children, being African American, and uncertainty about Advance <b>Care</b> <b>Planning</b> and its legal status. Individuals’ previous illness experiences, preferences and attitudes also influenced their participation. Conclusion: Factors influencing the uptake of Advance <b>Care</b> <b>Planning</b> in palliative <b>care</b> are complex and multifaceted reflecting the diverse and often competing needs of patients, health professionals, legislature and health systems. Large population-based studies of palliative care patients are required to develop the sound theoretical and empirical foundation needed to improve uptake of Advance <b>Care</b> <b>Planning</b> in this setting...|$|R

40|$|Aims and objectives: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the phenomenon of Advance <b>Care</b> <b>Planning</b> and the use of Advance Care Directives in residential aged care facilities in Australia. The objectives were to: i) investigate the implementation process of Advance <b>Care</b> <b>Planning</b> and the use of Advance Care Directives; ii) investigate the outcomes of Advance <b>Care</b> <b>Planning</b> and experiences of people involved in Advance <b>Care</b> <b>Planning</b> and Advance <b>Care</b> Directives, including residents, families and nursing staff. Background. Benefits of Advance <b>Care</b> <b>Planning</b> for older residents are considerable given their degenerative health-breakdown and minimal chance of recovery. To date, the use of Advance <b>Care</b> <b>Planning</b> and Advance <b>Care</b> Directives is limited and models of service delivery and processes are needed to enhance best practice with Advance <b>Care</b> <b>Planning</b> and positive outcomes for older Australians. Design: Case study. Methods: The study conducted using multiple sources of evidence to enrich understanding of the phenomenon of Advance <b>Care</b> <b>Planning.</b> The researcher engaged in data collection over six months involving participant observation, field notes, semi-structured interviews and document analysis. The findings contribute to the limited knowledge of options currently available to older adults and their families in their decision-making about end-of-life care options. Permission to conduct the study: Prior to commencement of the data collection, ethics clearances from the University of Newcastle and the regional Area Health Service were achieved. Permission to access the residential aged care facilities to undertake the study was obtained from the relevant residential aged care facility ethics committees or designated authorities. The researcher undertook several strategies to ensure all the ethical principles were considered and adhered to while conducting the project. Results: The research identified the components and factors involved in the Advance <b>Care</b> <b>Planning</b> process and in attaining desired outcomes. The conceptual framework developed elaborates how Advance <b>Care</b> <b>Planning</b> should be implemented and what may constitute successful implementation of Advance <b>Care</b> <b>Planning</b> in residential aged care facilities. The four main elements (input, throughput, output, feedback), and 20 sub-elements were requisites for nurses to initiate and implement the Advance <b>Care</b> <b>Planning.</b> Conclusion: The essential components for end-of-life care are identified in the implementation processes of Advance <b>Care</b> <b>Planning</b> in residential aged care facilities. The study contributes to greater awareness of the processes needed for ‘dying well’ and highlights the need to explore experiences of ‘successful dying’ and the way nurses contribute to these events. Relevance to clinical practice: The case study identified four determinative requisites for successful implementation of Advance <b>Care</b> <b>Planning</b> in aged <b>care</b> facilities: the expert nurse, discussion, education and involvement of a multidisciplinary team.
