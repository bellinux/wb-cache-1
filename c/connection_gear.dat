ARBOR stands for Accelerating Renewable Energies through valorisation of Biogenic Organic Raw Material. Various of the projects consider multi-stakeholder collaborations, with or without a financial share of ARBOR in the project realisation. This project runs from 2011 till 2015. The framework for ARBOR are the EU 202020 targets in order to reduce climate change and the fact that biomass accounts for 50 % of the renewables in Europe. Although a lot of expertise concerning biomass is available, it is noted that this information is not disseminated in a coordinated way, nor is it related to commercial exploitations. That is why the ARBOR-mission is to accelerate the sustainable development and use of biomass in North West Europe, to facilitate the achievement of the EU 202020 objectives. The increasing competition and environmental pressure and growing demand for food and resource efficiency requires cooperation and collaboration between agriculture and other business (Smeets, 2009) especially in the highly populated NWE. When companies systematically cooperate to achieve more sustainable biomass utilization through creating production synergies, we call this a synergy park. Ideally, synergy parks can be called a system innovation, that bring new technical, commercial, institutional, and social <b>connections</b> <b>geared</b> towards sustainable development. Ongoing collaboration and advice on stakeholder management should improve the synergy park composition, to the benefit of optimal biomass valorisation and energy efficiency.

40|$|Hybrid {{electric}} vehicles (HEV) represent {{one of the}} most promising fuel-saving technologies in the short-term for improving fuel economy of ground vehicles. Their viability has been amply demonstrated in a few successful commercial models. Among the common configurations, the power-split (i. e., combined parallel/series) configuration offers superior design and control flexibility and achieves highest overall efficiency. Therefore, most of the full-hybrid vehicles planned for the near future from Toyota, Lexus, GM, Chrysler, and Ford are all split hybrids. In this dissertation, a model-based configuration and control optimization analysis of power-split HEV is presented. An integrated dynamic model was first developed for power-split HEV powertrain systems. From this simulation model, a math-based universal model format is generalized. It presents different designs of power-split powertrains regardless of the various <b>connections</b> between <b>gear</b> nodes and power sources. Based on this universal format, a methodology that automatically generates dynamic models is developed. It not only enables rapid generation of powertrain models, but also allows the process of automatically exploring possible configuration designs. We next introduce a design screening process and a combined configuration and control optimization strategy. In the design screening process, various design requirements including transmission efficiency, drivability, power source component sizing are utilized to evaluate possible configurations and select valid design candidates. In the combined configuration and control optimization strategy, a control design procedure based on deterministic dynamic programming (DDP) was employed to find the optimal operation of the vehicle system and achieve the performance benchmarks for different configuration candidates. The optimal design solution is then achieved by comparing these benchmarks. This methodology allows design engineers to study powertrain configurations more scientifically and efficiently. Finally, with the DDP suggesting the potential performance benchmark of the selected powertrain configuration, two alternative control strategies, stochastic dynamic programming and equivalent consumption minimization strategy, are developed to approach this performance benchmark. Both of these two control designs can be implemented in real-time and show close agreement with the DDP results in the simulation...|$|R

Aurizon’s coal wagons are operated in tandem pairs, each pair having a drawbar connection between the wagons and auto-coupler connections at the outermost ends.

40|$|Abstract — The {{purpose of}} this study is to find the optimum power {{contribution}} ratio defined as the ratio of traction force applied onto rack rail by front pinion gear and rear pinion gear of monorail used in this study. At first, relation between loading weight and applied stress was investigated when loading weight Mb on the bogie was changed. Power contribution ratio was estimated using this relationship. The effect of the condition of power contribution ratio on the normal stress applied onto the rack tooth was simulated using obtained relations. The optimum power contribution ratio of front pinion gear was defined as an effective designing parameter to reduce the stress applied onto the rack tooth. A reduction ratio determined with the ratio of maximum compression stress on the tooth considering power contribution ratio to that of conventional case was estimated when the optimum power contribution ratio was considered. It was found that most of traction force was sheared by the front pinion gear not depending on magnitude of traction force, because the revolutions of the front and rear pinion gears was directly constraint due to the link system of the <b>connection</b> in the <b>gear</b> box of current monorail. The optimum power contribution ratio was α= 0. 53 when the representative location of the contacting forces on front pinion gear was h 1 = 5. 6 mm measured from the root of tooth, and that on rear pinion gear was h 2 = 7. 0 mm, respectively.

25|$|The chariots of Yan Su and Wu Deren {{appear to}} have used this type of mechanism. (See {{descriptions}} quoted from the Song Shi, above.) Apart from the presence of components in Wu Deren's vehicle to make it function as an odometer, there were only minor differences between them. In each chariot, the two main road wheels were attached to vertical gear wheels. A large horizontal gear wheel was linked (possibly via intermediate gearing) to the pointing doll, and was positioned so a diameter almost spanned {{the space between the}} uppermost points of the vertical gear wheels. When the chariot was moving straight ahead, there was no <b>connection</b> between these <b>gears,</b> but when the chariot turned, a small gear wheel was lowered into contact with the horizontal gear and one of the vertical gears, thus linking the doll to one of the road wheels. Two small gear wheels were available, one to connect the horizontal gear to each of the vertical ones. Of course, they were not used simultaneously. The small gear wheels were raised and lowered by an arrangement of weights, pulleys and cords which were attached to the pole to which the horses that pulled the chariot were harnessed. When the horses moved to one side or the other, in order to turn the chariot, the pole moved and the cords lowered the appropriate small gear wheel into its working position. When the horses returned to walking straight ahead, the small gear wheel was raised out of contact with the main horizontal and vertical gears. Thus the system functioned automatically. The mirror-symmetry of the vertical gears being linked by the small gears to the horizontal gear at diametrically opposite points caused the horizontal gear to rotate in opposite directions depending on which road wheel was linked to it, thus rotating the pointing doll in opposite directions when the chariot turned left and right.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{automatic}} transmission using hydraulic fluid {{was developed in}} 1932 by two Brazilian engineers, José Braz Araripe and Fernando Lehly Lemos; Later, the prototype and the project were sold to General Motors, who introduced the technology in the 1940 Oldsmobile model as a [...] "Hydra-Matic" [...] transmission. However, an article published by the Wall Street Journal credits the German auto parts company ZF Friedrichshafen for the invention, which would have occurred shortly after World War I. In 1934, both REO and General Motors developed semi-{{automatic transmission}}s that were less difficult to operate than a fully manual unit. These designs, however, continued to use a clutch to engage the engine with the transmission. The General Motors unit, dubbed the [...] "Automatic Safety Transmission," [...] was notable in that it employed a power-shifting planetary gearbox that was hydraulically controlled and was sensitive to road speed, anticipating future development. Parallel to the development in the 1930s of an automatically shifting gearbox was Chrysler's work on adapting the fluid coupling to automotive use. Invented early in the 20th century, the fluid coupling was {{the answer to the}} question of how to avoid stalling the engine when the vehicle was stopped with the transmission in gear. Chrysler itself never used the fluid coupling with any of its automatic transmissions, but did use it in conjunction with a hybrid manual transmission called [...] "Fluid Drive" [...] (the similar Hy-Drive used a torque converter). These developments in automatic gearbox and fluid coupling technology eventually culminated in the introduction in 1939 of the General Motors Hydra-Matic, the world's first mass-produced automatic transmission. Available as an option on 1940 Oldsmobiles and later Cadillacs, the Hydra-Matic combined a fluid coupling with three hydraulically controlled planetary gearsets to produce four forward speeds plus reverse. The transmission was sensitive to engine throttle position and road speed, producing fully automatic up- and down-shifting that varied according to operating conditions. The Hydra-Matic was subsequently adopted by Cadillac and Pontiac, and was sold to various other automakers, including Bentley, Hudson, Kaiser, Nash, and Rolls-Royce. It also found use during World War II in some military vehicles. From 1950 to 1954, Lincoln cars were also available with the Hydra-Matic. Mercedes-Benz subsequently devised a four-speed fluid coupling transmission that was similar in principle to the Hydra-Matic, but of a different design. Interestingly, the original Hydra-Matic incorporated two features which are widely emulated in today's transmissions. The Hydra-Matic's ratio spread through the four gears produced excellent [...] "step-off" [...] and acceleration in first, good spacing of intermediate gears, and the effect of an overdrive in fourth, by virtue of the low numerical rear axle ratio used in the vehicles of the time. In addition, in third and fourth gear, the fluid coupling only handled a portion of the engine's torque, resulting in a high degree of efficiency. In this respect, the transmission's behavior was similar to modern units incorporating a lock-up torque converter. In 1956, GM introduced the [...] "Jetaway" [...] Hydra-Matic, which was different in design than the older model. Addressing the issue of shift quality, which was an ongoing problem with the original Hydra-Matic, the new transmission utilized two fluid couplings, the primary one that linked the transmission to the engine, and a secondary one that replaced the clutch assembly that controlled the forward gearset in the original. The result was much smoother shifting, especially from first to second gear, but with a loss in efficiency and an increase in complexity. Another innovation for this new style Hydra-Matic was the appearance of a Park position on the selector. The original Hydra-Matic, which continued in production until the mid-1960s, still used the reverse position for parking pawl engagement. The first torque converter automatic, Buick's Dynaflow, was introduced for the 1948 model year. It was followed by Packard's Ultramatic in mid-1949 and Chevrolet's Powerglide for the 1950 model year. Each of these transmissions had only two forward speeds, relying on the converter for additional torque multiplication. In the early 1950s, BorgWarner developed a series of three-speed torque converter automatics for American Motors, Ford Motor Company, Studebaker, and several other manufacturers in the US and other countries. Chrysler was late in developing its own true automatic, introducing the two-speed torque converter PowerFlite in 1953, and the three-speed TorqueFlite in 1956. The latter was the first to utilize the Simpson compound planetary gearset. General Motors produced multiple-turbine torque converters from 1954 to 1961. These included the Twin-Turbine Dynaflow and the triple-turbine Turboglide transmissions. The shifting took place in the torque converter, rather than through pressure valves and changes in planetary <b>gear</b> <b>connections.</b> Each turbine was connected to the drive shaft through a different gear train. These phased from one ratio to another according to demand, rather than shifting. The Turboglide actually had two speed ratios in reverse, with one of the turbines rotating backwards. By the late 1960s, most of the fluid-coupling four-speed and two-speed transmissions had disappeared in favor of three-speed units with torque converters. Also around this time, whale oil was removed from automatic transmission fluid. By the early 1980s, these were being supplemented and eventually replaced by overdrive-equipped transmissions providing four or more forward speeds. Many transmissions also adopted the lock-up torque converter (a mechanical clutch locking the torque converter pump and turbine together to eliminate slip at cruising speed) to improve fuel economy. As computerized engine control units (ECUs) became more capable, much of the logic built into the transmission's valve body was offloaded to the ECU. Some manufacturers use a separate computer dedicated to the transmission called a transmission control unit (TCU), also known as the transmission control module (TCM), which shares information with the engine management computer. In this case, solenoids turned on and off by the computer control shift patterns and gear ratios, rather than the spring-loaded valves in the valve body. This allows for more precise control of shift points, shift quality, lower shift times, and (on some newer cars) semi-automatic control, where the driver tells the computer when to shift. The result is an impressive combination of efficiency and smoothness. Some computers even identify the driver's style and adapt to best suit it.|$|R
