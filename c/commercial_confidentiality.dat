2500|$|The {{campaign}} {{included mass}} protests and a prolonged non-payment campaign, and continued {{as long as}} did the tolls. [...] A toll-collector interviewed by the BBC said that abuse of collectors by motorists had been commonplace. Numerous toll opponents were cited for refusing to pay the toll, with around 500 being arrested and 130 subsequently convicted of non-payment. Among those charged was Clodagh Mackenzie, an elderly lady from whom the land necessary for the bridge's arrival in Skye had been compulsorily purchased; the charges against her were subsequently dropped without explanation. [...] Of those convicted, only the first, the SKAT Secretary Andy Anderson, received a (brief) prison term. [...] Those charged with non-payment {{had to make the}} 140 mile round trip to Dingwall sheriff court, again crossing the bridge and where again many refused to pay, incurring a further criminal charge. [...] Robbie the Pict argued that the legal paperwork for the tolls was incomplete, and that consequently the tolls themselves were illegal. [...] In particular he said that the [...] "assignation statement", a licence to charge a toll, had never been given. [...] Interviewed later by the BBC Fiscal Davind Hingston in Dingwall denied this claim, but admitted that he himself had been denied access to many government documents on the case, on the grounds of <b>commercial</b> <b>confidentiality.</b> Hingston told the BBC [...] "As a fiscal I was stuck with that evidence but as a private individual I found it stunning", leading to renewed calls that the convictions of the toll protesters should be quashed - to this the Crown Office reiterated that appeals on these grounds had already been rejected by the courts.|$|E

40|$|To survive global {{competition}} in a knowledge economy, respective {{fields of the}} enterprise knowledge must be upgraded constantly. There are two means to achieve this goal: inducing new knowledge from outside of the enterprise, or by creating new knowledge from within. The advantages of creating new knowledge from within are to create the core knowledge of the enterprise directly, easily protect <b>commercial</b> <b>confidentialities,</b> especially when the knowledge cannot be acquired from the outside, and since the knowledge is tailor made within enterprise, advantages such as higher applicability and higher compatibility can be achieved. When an enterprise has decided to create new knowledge from within, the following attributes must be contemplated: selecting suitable members, determining the kind of knowledge needed, knowledge complexity, knowledge level, the pressure of time, and the like. This study develops a mathematical model, which utilizes team collaboration {{in the creation of}} new knowledge, and helps select a suitable team under limited resources, while achieving the best benefit for knowledge creation. In light of the target knowledge, three knowledge dimensions must be considered concurrently, namely, knowledge complexity, the knowledge level of each employee, and the knowledge correlation between existing knowledge and target knowledge. Furthermore, the model can quantify the contribution of team collaboration on the creation of new knowledge, growth of the new knowledge of members, the time required to increase knowledge, and the total time required to create the target knowledge...|$|R

50|$|Exceptions to {{disclosure}} {{should be}} grounded on clearly and narrowly-defined exceptions.

However, even if can be demonstrated that disclosure would cause substantial harm to a legitimate interest, the information should be released when the benefits of disclosure prevail over the harm. In other words, the harm to the legitimate interest must be weighed against the public interest in having a given information publicly available.|$|R
40|$|Package {{management}} systems play {{an essential role}} in pursuing systems dependability by ensuring that software is correctly installed and kept up-to-date according to vendor-defined installation policies. Circumventing such policies could make the system unhealthy and insecure and can constitute a serious security threat. In many application scenarios, e. g., distribution of <b>commercial</b> software, the <b>confidentiality</b> of the software must be guaranteed against non-authorized players. In some cases, the installation policy itself is considered a sensitive information, e. g., when it reveals required hardware in military contexts. In this paper we address the problem of strongly enforcing software dependencies in package {{management systems}}, to prevent that a malicious user forces the system to install any package despite its requirements are not completely fulfilled. The enforcement is strong {{in the sense that the}} encrypted software package cannot be even decrypted if the dependencies are not satisfied. Once a new package is decrypted and installed, our protocol non-interactively updates the key material on the target device. This key update will allow the decryption of further packages that depend on the newly installed one. We further present “policy-hiding” variants of our protocol. Finally we provide an experimental evaluation of the system performance...|$|R

40|$|Purpose The aim of {{the paper}} is to assesses the role and {{effectiveness}} of a proposed novel strategy for Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) data collection in the food sector and associated supply chains. The study {{represents one of the}} first of its type and provides answers to some of the key questions regarding the data collection process developed, managed and implemented by a multinational food company across the supply chain. Methods An integrated LCI data collection process for confectionery products was developed and implemented by Nestlé, a multinational food company. Some of the key features includes: (1) management and implementation by a multinational food company, (2) types of roles to manage, provide and facilitate data exchange, (3) procedures to identify key products, suppliers and customers, (4) LCI questionnaire and cover letter, and (5) data quality management based on the pedigree matrix. Overall, the combined features in an integrated framework provides a new way of thinking about the collection of LCI data {{from the perspective of a}} multinational food company. Results The integrated LCI collection framework spanned across five months and resulted in 87 new LCI datasets for confectionery products from raw material, primary resource use, emission and waste release data collected from suppliers across 19 countries. The data collected was found to be of medium-to-high quality compared with secondary data. However, for retailers and waste service companies only partially completed questionnaires were returned. Some of the key challenges encountered during the collection and creation of data included: lack of experience, identifying key actors, communication and technical language, <b>commercial</b> compromise, <b>confidentiality</b> protection, and complexity of multi-tiered supplier systems. A range of recommendations are proposed to reconcile these challenges which include: standardisation of environmental data from suppliers, concise and targeted LCI questionnaires, and visualising complexity through drawings. Conclusions The integrated LCI data collection process and strategy has demonstrated the potential role of a multinational company to quickly engage and act as a strong enabler to unlock latent data for various aspects of the confectionery supply chain. Overall, it is recommended that the research findings serve as the foundations to transition towards a standardised procedure which can practically guide other multinational companies to considerably increase the availability of LCI data...|$|R
40|$|Building Information Modeling (BIM) has {{received}} widespread {{attention in the}} management of built environment with the potential to change the traditional construction practices. BIM promotes an integrated project delivery approach that encourages collaboration amongst the various stakeholders to the project over its lifecycle. The perceived benefits from collaboration such as improved profitability, reduced costs, better time management and improved customer/contractor relationships have been amongst the factors driving the paradigm shift towards BIM. However, there are various barriers affecting the implementation of BIM in construction projects. Legal pitfalls, besides the technological issues, have been amongst the barriers to efficient implementation of BIM. The legal risks assume a bigger hurdle in BIM adoption for construction projects procured through public private partnership (PPP) route such as build-operate-transfer (BOT) on account of the highly complex contractual relationships amongst the various stakeholders to the project. PPP projects have additional <b>confidentiality,</b> <b>commercial,</b> financial, and legal complexities besides the technical and managerial issues of traditional design-build projects. The paper discusses the hurdles in the implementation of BIM to manage the construction projects procured through PPP route, which {{has become one of the}} preferred routes for procurement of projects in developed and developing countries in view of the budgetary constraints faced by the governments. The paper concludes with additional legal and contractual measures that should be included in contractual package of PPP projects in order to facilitate BIM for management of the projects...|$|R

50|$|The {{types of}} crime {{committed}} are {{a function of}} what is available to the potential offender. Thus, those employed in relatively unskilled environments and living in inner-city areas have fewer opportunities to exploit than those who work in situations where large financial transactions occur and live in areas where there is relative prosperity. Blue-collar crime {{tends to be more}} obvious and thus attracts more active police attention such as vandalism or shoplifting. In contrast, white-collar employees can incorporate legitimate and criminal behavior, thus making themselves less obvious when committing the crime. Therefore, blue-collar crime will more often use physical force, whereas in the corporate world, the identification of a victim is less obvious and the issue of reporting is complicated by a culture of <b>commercial</b> <b>confidentiality</b> to protect shareholder value. It is estimated that a great deal of white-collar crime is undetected or, if detected, it is not reported.|$|E
