For his actions in volunteering to stay behind with the wounded, Herman G. Felhoelter was posthumously awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, the second highest decoration for valor awarded by the U.S. military. He was the first chaplain of the war to receive an award for valor. He received a brief obituary in Time Magazine in December 1952. Felhoelter was the first of twelve chaplains killed or missing at that point in the war, including Emil J. Kapaun, the second chaplain of the war to be awarded a Distinguished Service Cross.|$|E

5|$|During the 12th century major landowners {{tended to}} rent out their demesne lands for money, {{motivated}} by static prices for produce and the <b>chaos</b> <b>of</b> the Anarchy between 1135 and 1153. This practice began to alter in the 1180s and 1190s, {{spurred by the}} greater political stability. In {{the first years of}} John's reign, agricultural prices almost doubled, at once increasing the potential profits on the demesne estates and also increasing the cost of living for the landowners themselves. Landowners now attempted wherever possible to bring their demesne lands back into direct management, creating a system of administrators and officials to run their new system of estates.|$|E
5|$|During the <b>chaos</b> <b>of</b> the battle, Major General Yu Jai Hung of the ROK II Corps did {{not receive}} news from the front line until midnight of November 25 — five hours after the Chinese had entered the Korean rear.

As the 2nd Infantry Regiment marched towards the front {{on the morning of}} November 26, the PVA 113th Division intercepted the regiment and destroyed its command post, scattering the ROK II Corps' entire reserve in the process. With most the ROK II Corps' units destroyed by November 27, the UN right flank had fallen to the Chinese.|$|E

5|$|On 18July 1936, {{war broke}} out on the Iberian {{peninsula}} as Spain dissolved {{into a state of}} civil war. After the <b>chaos</b> <b>of</b> the initial uprising, two opposing sides coalesced and began to consolidate their position—the Popular front (the Republicans) and the Spanish Nationalist front. In an early example of a proxy war, both sides quickly received support from other countries, most notably the Soviet Union and Germany as both wanted to test their tactics and equipment. The first shipment of foreign tanks, 50 Soviet T-26s, arrived on the 15 of October. The shipment was under the surveillance of Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine and Germany immediately responded by sending 41 PanzerI's to Spain a few days later. This first shipment was followed by four more shipments of PanzerI Ausf.B's, with 122 vehicles shipped in total.|$|E

5|$|Starting {{with the}} album Blood Fire Death, {{one of the}} first {{definitive}} Viking metal releases, Bathory incorporated a diverse range of musical elements. While retaining the noise and <b>chaos</b> <b>of</b> previous recordings, the band took a more sorrowful and melodic approach, working in ballads based on Germanic and Norse folklore, shanty-like melodies and folk music elements such as bourdon sounds, Jew's harps, and fifes. Bathory added natural found sounds, such as ocean waves, thunder, and wild animal noises, in a style similar to that of musique concrète. Instruments were sometimes used to create onomatopoeic effects such as drum sounds imitating thunder or a sledgehammer. The songs typically featured multi-sectional formal structures, following a pattern of three instrumental sections– introduction, bridge, and finale– and two vocal sections– stanza and refrain.|$|E
5|$|The Army's {{training}} program attracted criticism, {{both at the}} time and subsequently. In 1937, Brigadier General George C. Marshall felt that in merging instruction on command and staff duties, the Command and General Staff School had neglected the former in favor of the latter, with officers being prepared for staff duties in peacetime rather than the <b>chaos</b> <b>of</b> command in wartime. Brigadier General Lesley J. McNair conducted a survey of graduates in 1939 that found that most felt that there was too much emphasis on obsolete skills like equitation. For this reason, the staff rides were disliked. While most considered the map exercises the most valuable part of the curriculum, some noted that students spent time discovering for themselves things that they could have been told.|$|E
5|$|There {{were some}} reversals. The {{attempts}} of English merchants {{to break through}} the Hanseatic league directly into the Baltic markets failed in the domestic political <b>chaos</b> <b>of</b> the Wars of the Roses in the 1460s and 1470s. The wine trade with Gascony fell by half during the war with France, and the eventual loss of the province brought an end to the English domination of the business and temporary disruption to Bristol's prosperity until wines began to be imported through the city a few years later. Indeed, the disruption to both the Baltic and the Gascon trade contributed to a sharp reduction in the consumption of furs and wine by the English gentry and nobility during the 15th century.|$|E

5|$|Through the {{intervention}} of a friend, Khrushchev was assigned in 1921 as assistant director for political affairs for the Rutchenkovo mine in the Donbas region, where he had previously worked. There were as yet few Bolsheviks in the area. At that time, the movement was split by Lenin's New Economic Policy, which allowed for some measure of private enterprise and {{was seen as an}} ideological retreat by some Bolsheviks. While Khrushchev's responsibility lay in political affairs, he involved himself in the practicalities of resuming full production at the mine after the <b>chaos</b> <b>of</b> the war years. He helped restart the machines (key parts and papers had been removed by the pre-Soviet mineowners) and he wore his old mine outfit for inspection tours.|$|E
5|$|While {{during the}} late 1920s and early 1930s {{relations}} with the Soviet Union became normalized to a degree, from 1938 on, the Soviets, anxious that Finland {{could be used as}} a springboard for an invasion, started negotiations to conclude a military agreement. At the same time, Soviet leader Joseph Stalin's desire to recover the territories of Tsarist Russia lost during the <b>chaos</b> <b>of</b> the October Revolution and the Russian Civil War made Finland an obvious target. Due to the nature of Soviet demands, which included the installation of Soviet military facilities on Finnish soil, these negotiations went nowhere.|$|E
5|$|A {{native of}} Belgrade, he began writing poetry {{at an early}} age and {{published}} a number of literary reviews under a pseudonym while he was still a teenager. He rose to prominence during the Balkan Wars, writing about his experiences in territories newly retaken from the Ottoman Empire. The outbreak of World War I interrupted Bojić's studies at the University of Belgrade and forced him to postpone marrying his girlfriend, Radmila Todorović. The couple were separated in the <b>chaos</b> <b>of</b> war, and Bojić left Belgrade with his family and relocated to Niš, where he worked as a military censor and wrote articles for a local newspaper to pay his family's bills. In October 1915, the Serbian Army was overwhelmed by a combined Austro-Hungarian, Bulgarian and German invasion and forced to retreat to neutral Greece via Albania. Bojić and his younger brother joined the exodus, marching for several weeks through Kosovo, Montenegro and northern Albania, where they were finally reunited with Bojić's fiancée. Bojić was not allowed to accompany his brother and fiancée on a ship destined for Italy because he was of fighting age, and had to continue marching to Greece without them.|$|E
40|$|Statistical {{measures}} <b>of</b> <b>chaos</b> {{have long}} {{been used in the}} study of chaotic dynamics in the framework of the interacting boson model. The use of large number of bosons renders additional studies <b>of</b> <b>chaos</b> possible, that can provide a direct comparison with similar classical studies <b>of</b> <b>chaos.</b> We intend to provide complete quantum chaotic dynamics at zero angular momentum {{in the vicinity of the}} arc of regularity and link the results of the study <b>of</b> <b>chaos</b> using statistical measures with those of the study <b>of</b> <b>chaos</b> using classical measures. Statistical measures <b>of</b> <b>chaos</b> are applied on the spectrum and the transition intensities of 0 + states in the framework of the interacting boson model. The energy dependence <b>of</b> <b>chaos</b> is provided for the first time using statistical measures <b>of</b> <b>chaos.</b> The position <b>of</b> the arc of regularity was also found to be stable in the limit of large boson numbers. The results of the study <b>of</b> <b>chaos</b> using statistical measures are consistent with previous studies using classical measures <b>of</b> <b>chaos,</b> as well as with studies using statistical measures <b>of</b> <b>chaos,</b> but for small number of bosons and states with angular momentum greater than 2.

5|$|Dean's {{plan was}} to airlift one {{battalion}} of the 24th Infantry Division into South Korea via C-54 Skymaster transport aircraft and to block advancing North Korean forces while {{the remainder of the}} division was transported on ships. The 21st Infantry Regiment was identified as the most combat-ready of the 24th Infantry Division's three regiments, and the 21st Infantry's 1st Battalion was selected because its commander, Lieutenant Colonel Charles B. Smith, was the most experienced, having commanded a battalion at the Battle of Guadalcanal during World War II. On July 5, Task Force Smith engaged North Korean forces at the Battle of Osan, delaying 5,000 North Korean infantry for seven hours before being defeated. The 540-man force suffered 60 killed, 21 wounded and 82 captured, a very heavy casualty rate. In the <b>chaos</b> <b>of</b> the retreat, most of the bodies were left behind, and the fates of many of the missing were unknown for several weeks.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1930s, Stalin's Soviet Union {{was no longer}} {{satisfied}} {{with the status quo}} in its relations with Finland. This came {{as a result of a}} change in Soviet foreign policy, which now pursued the aim of recovering the provinces of Tsarist Russia lost during the <b>chaos</b> <b>of</b> the October Revolution and the Russian Civil War. The Soviets considered the old Empire to have had an optimal balance of security and territory, and their thoughts were shaped by a historical precedent: as the Treaty of Nystad of 1721 was intended to protect Tsarist Saint Petersburg from the Swedes, the re-acquisition of Finland would protect the now Bolshevik Leningrad from the rising power of Nazi Germany. While in 1938 Sweden was no longer a major threat against Russia, the Soviets had not forgotten the role that the Finnish-controlled Åland islands had played as a base of operations for the German Expeditionary Force in the Finnish Civil War.|$|E
5|$|Rome's {{control over}} the city ended {{following}} the <b>chaos</b> <b>of</b> the Crisis of the Third Century, when the empire nearly disintegrated {{as a series of}} generals seized and lost power through civil wars, palace coups and assassinations. Around 280, Roman rule collapsed in much of Mauretania and was never re-established.In 285, the emperor Diocletian reorganised {{what was left of the}} province to retain only the coastal strip between Lixus, Tingis and Septa (modern Ceuta). Although a Roman army was based in Tingis, it was decided that it would simply be too expensive to mount a reconquest of a vulnerable border region. Occupation of the city continued, however, as fine mosaics such as that of a chariot race conducted by animals in the House of Venus can not have been created earlier than the fourth century. The end of the Roman city probably came in the form of an earthquake towards the end of the century, which buried numerous bronze statues in the wreckage of the houses.|$|E
