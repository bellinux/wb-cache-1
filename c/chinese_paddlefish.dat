50|$|The <b>Chinese</b> <b>paddlefish</b> is a first-level {{protected}} animal of the People's Republic of China. Due to overfishing, the <b>Chinese</b> <b>paddlefish</b> {{is critically}} endangered, and officially {{recognized by the}} People's Republic in 1983 to prevent fishing of paddlefish young or adults. Paddlefish are also threatened by dams (such as the Three Gorges Dam) which divide the population into isolated groups. The fish are rarely seen, recently raising concerns that the species might already be extinct. During a three-year search conducted from 2006-2008 a research team from the Chinese Academy of Fisheries Science in Jingzhou failed to catch any paddlefish, but two probable specimens were recorded with hydroacoustic signals. In recent years there have only been two confirmed sightings of the fish alive: One occurred on January 24, 2003, on the Yangtze. The second and most recent was a 3.6 m, 250 kg specimen captured by illegal fishing on January 8, 2007, in Jiayu County. Local villagers contacted officials who rushed to the site. Zeb Hogan of the TV-series Monster Fish on National Geographic Channel and other conservationists transferred the fish to a holding pen in hope that it would survive, but it died shortly afterwards due to unrecoverable injuries sustained while thrashing in the net. Many scientists now consider the <b>Chinese</b> <b>paddlefish</b> to be extinct.|$|E

5000|$|During {{the initial}} stages of {{development}} from embryo to fry, paddlefish have no rostrum (snout). It begins to form shortly after hatching. The rostrum of a <b>Chinese</b> <b>paddlefish</b> is narrow and sword-like while the rostrum of the American paddlefish is broad and paddle-like. Some common morphological characteristics of paddlefish include a spindle-shaped, smooth skinned scaleless body, heterocercal tail, and small poorly developed eyes. Unlike the filter-feeding American paddlefish, <b>Chinese</b> <b>paddlefish</b> are piscivores, and highly predaceous. Their jaws are more forward pointing which suggest they forage primarily on small fishes in the water column, and occasionally on shrimp, benthic fishes, and crabs. The jaws of the American paddlefish are distinctly adapted for filter feeding only. [...] They are ram suspension filter feeders with a diet that consists primarily of zooplankton, and occasionally small insects, insect larvae, and small fish.|$|E
5000|$|The {{name comes}} from Ancient Greek words [...] "protos" [...] (first) and [...] "psepharos" [...] (cloudy/gloomy one).

50|$|Paddlefish {{populations have}} {{declined}} dramatically throughout their historic range {{as a result}} of overfishing, pollution, and the encroachment of human development, including the construction of dams that have blocked their seasonal upward migration to ancestral spawning grounds.

The largest American paddlefish on record weighed 144 lb, and was caught by Clinton Boldridge in the Atchison Watershed in Kansas. Scientists once believed paddlefish used their rostrums to excavate bottom substrate, but have since determined with the aid of electron microscopy that paddlefish have electroreceptors on their rostrum's ampulla (hair cells) which are similar in structure to other Lorenzini. [...] The electroreceptors can detect weak electrical fields which not only signal the presence of prey items in the water column, such as zooplankton which is the primary diet of the American paddlefish, but they can also detect the individual feeding and swimming movements of zooplankton's appendages. [...] Paddlefish have poorly developed eyes, and rely on their electroreceptors for foraging. However, the rostrum is not the paddlefish's sole means of food detection. Some reports incorrectly suggest that a damaged rostrum would render paddlefish less capable of foraging efficiently to maintain good health. Laboratory experiments, and field research indicate otherwise. In addition to electroreceptors on the rostrum, paddlefish also have sensory pores covering nearly half of the skin surface extending from the rostrum to the top of the head down to the tips of the operculum (gill flaps). Therefore, paddlefish with damaged or abbreviated rostrums are still able to forage and maintain good health.|$|E

40|$|Purpose. Sturgeon is {{the common}} name for the 27 species of fish {{belonging}} to the family Acipenseridae. The family is grouped into four genera: Acipenser, Huso, Scaphirhynchus and Pseudoscaphirhynchus. Four species may now be extinct.

The aim of our paper is to develop and carry out a new DNA identification methodology for the sturgeons species {{with the use of}} real time polymerase chain reaction. Methodology. A PCR with the detection of results in real time was used for DNA-identification of sturgeon species. Findings. The new real-time PCR was developed and tested for rapid and accurate identification of DNA extracted from eggs and meat of four sturgeon species such as beluga (Huso huso, Linnaeus), Russian sturgeon (Acipenser gueldenstaedtii, Brandt), sterlet (Acipenser ruthenus, Linnaeus) and stellate sturgeon (Acipenser stellatus, Pallas). Based on the results of analytical specificity and comparison of the amplification parameters, we detected specific amplification and absence of cross reactions for fin fragments and eggs of the studied fish species. The proposed DNA-identification method can be used for the identification of sturgeon species that will allow controlling the production of competitive aquaculture products, which will meet CITES requirements. Originality. For the first time, the development and approbation of the methodology for species identification of sturgeon fish by using real-time PCR was carried out. Practical value. Species identification of sturgeon fish will allow controlling the production of competitive and legalized aquaculture products that meet CITES requirements as well as will ensure the implementation of the country strategic plan for food security in Ukraine...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Fish {{passage in}} an era of broken rivers: new {{approaches}} a reason for hope? In an era of decline of large-bodied, migratory fishes, river connectivity {{has been shown to be}} increasingly important for the conservation of native biodiversity. From North America to Asia, Europe to South America, issues with river connectivity influence – for better or worse - the life cycle, and population status, of migratory fishes. In the Mekong River Basin, the world’s largest fishes, including the Critically Endangered Mekong giant catfish Pangasianodon gigas and giant pangasius Pangasius sanitwongsei, face extinction because of mainstream dams on the lower Mekong. In China, populations of the Chinese sturgeon, Acipenser sinensis, and <b>Chinese</b> <b>paddlefish,</b> Psephurus gladius, have declined significantly since the construction of the Gezhouba and Three Gorges Dams. In North America, connectivity is increasingly recognized as a determining factor in the health of sturgeon and salmon populations in the Columbia and Fraser Rivers; similarly, American paddlefish, Polyodon spathula, and pallid sturgeon, Scaphirhynchus albus, are impacted by dams and habitat fragmentation. The situation is similar in New Zealand, where a combination of factors – from dams to habitat degradation to overfishing – is resulting in unprecedented population decline of species like the longfin eel Anguilla dieffenbachii. Identifying novel fish passage solutions that maximize environmental benefit and minimize cost is the only way to provide for needs of a rapidly growing human population while also protecting imperiled aquatic fauna. Fish passage broadly interpreted includes a wide range of solutions to increase connectivity and restore fish migrations and populations. New methods of study, technologies, decisions about dam placement and dam removal all offer potential for restoring threatened fish. On a policy level, the Convention on Migratory Species provides a framework for management of transboundary migratory freshwater fish – a neglected biota in urgent need of study and protection...|$|E
