According {{to the case}} of Fazenda Baía Bonita in the Nhecolândia of south Pantanal, this study examines the problems of traditional cattle grazing and appropriate measures for the future management by focusing on the relationships between natural environment and social surroundings. The wise use of wetlands fostered for centuries still remains in the ranch, e. g., management of cattle herds corresponding with seasonal water level, methods for preventing grassland from plant succession to semi-deciduous forest by means of intentional burn, tree girdling and cleaning, and mutual aid customs between neighboring ranches. However, the management of extensive <b>calf</b> <b>production</b> confronts difficulties at present because of the scarcity of labor, small-scale grassland of the ranch, low conception rate of heifers and cows, and low productivity and quality of calves. In order to resolve current situation and to achieve stable management of <b>calf</b> <b>production,</b> it needs to create a calendar of breeding and shipping that especially specifies the season of breeding to promote the efficiency of administrative work. It is also necessary to introduce stud bull and cows of high quality, and to practice appropriate controls on their numbers and breeding under strict regulations of grazing areas. ブラジル南パンタナールのバイアボニータ農場では，天然草地の放牧地に依存した，肥育用の仔ウシ生産を目的とする仔取り繁殖経営が中心に営まれている。ここでは，季節的な河川の水位変化に起因して発現する多様な天然草地の状況に合わせて牛群を管理したり，火入れや伐採・巻き枯らしにより草地の森林化を抑制したりするなど，農場間の相互扶助システムとともに，パンタナールで培われてきた牧畜経営のワイズユース（wise use）が現在も継承されている。しかし，農場規模が小さいうえに，労働力不足，ウシの受胎率の低さ，生産性や品質の低さといった諸課題に直面して，伝統的な牧畜経営の維持・発展は困難な状況にある。こうした現状を打開して経営の安定化を実現するためには，繁殖・出荷カレンダーを作成してウシの繁殖時期を特定化し管理作業の効率化を図ることや，質の高い種牡ウシや牝ウシを導入して，より厳格な牧区規制の下で両者の頭数管理や繁殖を効果的に実施することなどが必要である...|$|E

Since reintroduction, herd growth and {{population}} dynamics have been monitored closely. At this time, {{there has been no}} significant dispersal from the herds' core range. The Nushagak Peninsula Caribou Herd (NPCH) grew rapidly from 146 reintroduced individuals to over 1000 in 13 years. Dramatic mean annual growth during the first 6 years (1988 - 1994) of 38 % (r = 0. 32) {{can be attributed to the}} high percentage of females in the initial reintroduction, high <b>calf</b> <b>production</b> and survival, exceptional range conditions, few predators, and no hunting. However, the populations' exceptional growth (peak counts of 1400) slowed and stabilized between 1996 &not; 1998 and then decreased between 1998 and 2000. Size, body condition and weights of calves captured in 2000 were significantly lower than those captured in 1995 and 1997. Although <b>calf</b> <b>production</b> also decreased from close to 100 % (1990 - 1995) to about 91 % (1996 - 2000), overall calf survival continued to be high. Legal harvest began in 1995, and harvest reports have accounted for approximately 3 % of population mortality annually. Although brown bears (Ursus arctos) and wolves (Canis lupus) are present, the extent of predation is unknown. Mean home range of the NPCH was 674 km 2 and group sizes were greatest during post-calving aggregation in July (mean = 127). Caribou population density on the Nushagak Peninsula reached approximately 1. 2 caribou/km 2 in 1997 before declining to about 1. 0 caribou/km 2. A range survey in 1994 noted only trace utilization of lichens on the Nushagak Peninsula by caribou. A subsequent survey in 1999 found moderate to severe utilization in 46 % of plots, suggesting the reintroduced herd was beginning to alter range condition.

40|$|The {{nutritional}} state of animals is tightly {{linked to the}} ambient environment, and for northern ungulates the state strongly influences vital population demographics, such as pregnancy rates. Continuously growing tissues, such as hair, {{can be viewed as}} dietary records of animals over longer temporal scales. Using sequential data on nitrogen stable isotopes (δ 15 N) in muskox guard hairs from ten individuals in high arctic Northeast Greenland, we were able to reconstruct the dietary history of muskoxen over approximately 2. 5 years with a high temporal resolution of app. 9 days. The dietary chronology included almost three full summer and winter periods. The diet showed strong intra- and inter-annual seasonality, and was significantly linked to changes in local environmental conditions (temperature and snow depth). The summer diets were highly similar across years, reflecting a graminoid-dominated diet. In contrast, winter diets were markedly different between years, a pattern apparently linked to snow conditions. Snow-rich winters had markedly higher δ 15 N values than snow-poor winters, indicating that muskoxen had limited access to forage, and relied more heavily on their body stores. Due to the close link between body stores and <b>calf</b> <b>production</b> in northern ungulates, the dietary winter signals could eventually serve as an indicator of <b>calf</b> <b>production</b> the following spring.

We also compared progesterone during pregnancy between the 2 nutritional planes and lactating and non-lacta-ting cows. The timing of {{the rise and fall}} of the mid-pregnant progesterone peak was consistent with stage of gestation and apparently independent of time of breeding, diet or lactational status...|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{conducted in}} El Reno, Oklahoma during the fly season (May - September/October) evaluated {{the effects of}} horn flies on milk <b>production,</b> <b>calf</b> performance, and pasture behavior and temperament measurements of beef cow calf pairs. Cows (n = 53) sired by Bonsmara (BONS; n = 7), Brangus (BRAN; n = 13), Charolais (CHAR; n = 8), Gelbvieh (GELV; n = 5), Hereford (HERF; n = 12), and Romosinuano (ROMO; n = 8) from Brangus dams and their Angus sired calves (n = 51) {{were used in the}} study. Horn fly counts (HFC) and milk yield and quality estimates were collected every 28 d from May to October. Pasture behavior (grazing, standing or lying) was recorded monthly twice a day (AM and PM). Exit velocity (EV) and chute score (CS) were obtained from cows and calves monthly. Monthly HFC differed (P 3 ̆c 0. 0001), with populations lesser in May (94 ± 42 flies) and greater in August (503 ± 41 flies). The regression coefficients for milk yield on log HFC were not consistent across sire breed (P 3 ̆c 0. 05), with milk yield reduced 0. 99 and 0. 64 kg/d per unit increase in log HFC in GELV and BONS. The regression coefficients of preweaning ADG on log HFC depended on sire breed (P 3 ̆c 0. 10), with results indicating preweaning ADG reduced by 0. 19 kg/d per one unit increase in HFC in BONS calves (P 3 ̆c 0. 05), but not other breeds. A one unit increase in log HFC resulted in 0. 07 kg/d (P 3 ̆c 0. 10) increase in postweaning average daily gain (ADG), 19. 52 kg increase (P 3 ̆c 0. 10) in 365 -d adjusted yearling weight (YWT), and 0. 05 kg/d (P 3 ̆c 0. 02) increase in birth to yearling ADG. Pasture PM behavior was associated with HFC (P 3 ̆c 0. 05), with standing cows having fewer flies than those grazing and lying (319 ± 27 vs. 468 ± 52 and 419 ± 38 flies). Exit velocity of cows (P 3 ̆c 0. 0001) and calves (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) differed monthly. Results from study clearly demonstrated HFC affected milk <b>production,</b> <b>calf</b> performance, and pasture behavior and temperament measurements...|$|R
40|$|Human {{melanoma}} {{cells were}} examined in an indirect membrane immunofluorescence assay for surface nerve growth factor (NGF) and NGF receptors. This assay revealed that human melanoma cells have various levels of NGF and NGF receptors on the plasma membrane, whereas a variety of human sarcoma and carcinoma tumor cells and normal human fibroblasts are negative. Surface NGF could be detected on melanoma cells with a rabbit antiserum directed to NGF at titers as high as 1 : 64; prior adsorption of this antibody with mouse 2. 5 S NGF resulted {{in a loss of}} fluorescence. The melanoma cells were positive {{whether or not they were}} grown in the presence of fetal <b>calf</b> serum. NGF <b>production</b> by human melanomas is a previously unrecognized property of this differentiated cell type. Although other cells in culture have been shown to produce NGF, the association of NGF production with the presence of NGF receptors on the cell surface is rare among tumor cells, and may represent an opportunity for "autostimulation" of melanoma cells by this growth factor...|$|R
40|$|A dynamic age-structured {{model was}} used to {{simulate}} the consequences on herd production if an extra animal from a particular age class and season was lost. Herd size was adjusted to 1000 animals and a sex ratio of. 75 /. 25 via slaughter in late autumn. Three harvest strategies were applied, ranging from extreme calf to adult harvest. Equilibrium herd structure was disturbed {{with the loss of}} an extra animal and the consequences {{in terms of the number}} of animals slaughtered and kilogram of carcasses produced were followed over a simulation period of 15 years. The loss of a male corresponded largely to 0. 70 to 0. 90 times its own carcass weight. Loss of a female decreased herd production by 1. 2 to 1. 7 times the carcass weight of the lost animal. The highest losses were observed for 4 - 6 year old females. Loss of a <b>calf</b> reduced herd <b>production</b> by 0. 3 to 1. 6 times the calf's carcass weight, depending on season of loss and harvest strategy. In general, a loss during winter decreased herd production 10 to 20 percent more than a loss during autumn...|$|R
