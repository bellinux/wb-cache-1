40|$|In {{contrast}} to yeast RAD 51, mammalian mRAD 51 {{is an essential}} gene. Its role in double strand break (DSB) repair and its consequences on cell viability remain to be characterized precisely. Here, we used a hamster cell line carrying tandem repeat sequences with an I-SceI cleavage site. We characterized <b>conservative</b> <b>recombination</b> after I-SceI cleavage as gene conversion or intrachromatid crossing over associated with random reintegration of the excised reciprocal product. We identified two dominant-negative RAD 51 forms that specifically inhibit conservative recombination: the yeast ScRAD 51 or the yeast–mouse chimera SMRAD 51. In contrast, the mouse MmRAD 51 stimulates <b>conservative</b> <b>recombination.</b> None of these RAD 51 forms affects non-conservative recombination or global DSB healing. Consistently, although resistance to γ-rays remains unaffected, MmRAD 51 stimulates whereas ScRAD 51 or SMRAD 51 prevents radiation-induced recombination. This suggests that mRAD 51 does not significantly affect the global DSB repair efficiency but controls the classes of recombination events. Finally, both ScRAD 51 and SMRAD 51 drastically inhibit spontaneous recombination but not cell proliferation, showing that RAD 51 -dependent spontaneous and DSB-induced <b>conservative</b> <b>recombination</b> can be impaired significantly without affecting cell viability...|$|E
40|$|Intermolecular {{recombination}} in mammalian cells was {{studied by}} coinfecting African green monkey cells in culture with two shuttle vector plasmids, each carrying an incomplete but overlapping {{portion of the}} gene for neomycin resistance. The region of homology between the two plasmids was about 0. 6 kilobases. Recombination between the homology regions could reconstruct the neomycin resistance gene, which was monitored by analysis of progeny plasmids in bacteria. The individual plasmids carried additional markers which, in combination with restriction analysis, allowed {{the determination of the}} frequency of formation of the heterodimeric plasmid which would be formed in a <b>conservative</b> <b>recombination</b> reaction between the homologous sequences. Reconstruction of the neomycin resistance gene was readily observed, but only 1 to 2 % of the neomycin resistance plasmids had the structure of the conservative heterodimer. Treatment of the plasmids which enhanced the frequency of the neomycin resistance gene reconstruction reaction did not significantly increase the relative frequency of conservative product plasmids. The results support nonconservative models for recombination of these sequences...|$|E
40|$|Double-strand break repair {{models of}} genetic {{recombination}} propose that a double-strand break is introduced into an otherwise intact DNA {{and that the}} break is then repaired by copying a homologous DNA segment. Evidence for these models has been found among lambdoid phages and during yeast meiosis. In an earlier report, we demonstrated such repair of a preformed double-strand break by the Escherichia coli RecE pathway. Here, our experiments with plasmids demonstrate that such reciprocal or <b>conservative</b> <b>recombination</b> (two parental DNAs resulting in two progeny DNAs) is frequent at a double-strand break even when there exists the alternative route of nonreciprocal or nonconservative recombination (two parental DNAs resulting in only one progeny DNA). The presence of a long heterologous DNA at the double-strand break, however, resulted in a shift from the conservative (two-progeny) mode to the nonconservative (one-progeny) mode. The product is a DNA free from the heterologous insert containing recombinant flanking sequences. The potential ability of the homology-dependent double-strand break repair reaction to detect and eliminate heterologous inserts {{may have contributed to}} the evolution of homologous recombination, meiosis and sexual reproduction...|$|E
40|$|The FLP protein of the 2 microns plasmid of Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{promotes}} <b>conservative</b> site-specific <b>recombination</b> between DNA sequences {{that contain}} the FLP recognition target (FRT). FLP binds {{to each of}} the three 13 base pair symmetry elements in the FRT site in a site-specific manner. We have probed both major and minor groove contacts of FLP using dimethyl sulphate, monoacetyl- 4 -hydroxyaminoquinoline 1 -oxide and potassium permanganate and find that the protein displays extensive interactions with residues of both the major and minor grooves of 10 base pairs of each symmetry element. We find no evidence that the FRT site assumes a single-stranded conformation upon FLP binding...|$|R
40|$|We have {{established}} the integrase of the Streptomyces phage ϕBT 1 {{as a tool}} for eukaryotic genome manipulation. We show that the ϕBT 1 integrase promotes efficient reciprocal and <b>conservative</b> site-specific <b>recombination</b> in vertebrate cells and in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, thus establishing the utility of this protein for genome manipulation {{in a wide range of}} eukaryotes. We show that the ϕBT 1 integrase can be used in conjunction with Cre recombinase to promote the iterative integration of transgenic DNA. We describe five cycles of iterative integration of a candidate mouse centromeric sequence 80 kb in length into a human mini-chromosome within a human-Chinese hamster hybrid cell line. These results establish the generality of the iterative site-specific integration technique...|$|R
50|$|Site-specific recombination, {{also known}} as <b>conservative</b> {{site-specific}} <b>recombination,</b> {{is a type of}} genetic recombination in which DNA strand exchange takes place between segments possessing at least a certain degree of sequence homology. Site-specific recombinases (SSRs) perform rearrangements of DNA segments by recognizing and binding to short DNA sequences (sites), at which they cleave the DNA backbone, exchange the two DNA helices involved and rejoin the DNA strands. While in some site-specific recombination systems just a recombinase enzyme and the recombination sites is enough to perform all these reactions, in other systems a number of accessory proteins and/or accessory sites are also needed. Multiple genome modification strategies, among these recombinase-mediated cassette exchange (RMCE), an advanced approach for the targeted introduction of transcription units into predetermined genomic loci, rely on the capacities of SSRs.|$|R
40|$|Parathyroid adenomas {{are common}} benign {{neoplasms}} {{for which no}} chromosomal defects have been described. We recently found two parathyroid adenomas bearing clonal restriction fragment abnormalities involving the PTH locus, and now show that {{in one of these}} tumors: (a) a DNA rearrangement occurred at the PTH locus; (b) the rearrangement separated the PTH gene's 5 ' flanking region from its coding exons, conceivably placing a newly adjacent gene under the influence of PTH regulatory elements; (c) the DNA that recombined with PTH normally maps to 11 q 13, the known chromosomal location of several oncogenes and the gene for multiple endocrine neoplasia type I; and (d) the rearrangement was a reciprocal, <b>conservative</b> <b>recombination</b> of the locus on 11 q 13 (Human Gene Mapping Library assignment D 11 S 287) with PTH (on 11 p 15). These data provide molecular cytogenetic evidence for the clonal occurrence of a major chromosome 11 aberrancy in this benign parathyroid tumor. The D 11 S 287 clone could prove useful in genetic linkage analyses, in determining precise 11 q 13 breakpoints in other neoplasms, and in identifying a gene on chromosome 11 that may participate in parathyroid tumor development...|$|E
40|$|The double-strand break repair {{models for}} {{homologous}} recombination propose that a double-strand break in a duplex DNA segment is repaired by gene conversion copying a homologous DNA segment. This {{is a type}} of <b>conservative</b> <b>recombination,</b> or two-progeny recombination, which generates two duplex DNA segments from two duplex DNA segments. Transformation with a plasmid carrying a double-strand gap and an intact homologous DNA segment resulted in products expected from such conservative (two-progeny) repair in Escherichia coli cells with active E. coli RecE pathway (recBC sbcA) or with active bacteriophage λ Red pathway. Apparently conservative double-strand break repair, however, might result from successive events of nonconservative recombination, or one-progeny recombination, which generates only one recombinant duplex DNA segment from two segments, involving multiple plasmid molecules. Contribution of such intermolecular recombination was evaluated by transformation with a mixture of two isogenic parental plasmids marked with a restriction site polymorphism. Most of the gap repair products were from intramolecular and, therefore, conservative (two-progeny) reaction under the conditions chosen. Most were conservative {{even in the absence of}} RecA protein. The double-strand gap repair reaction was not affected by inversion of the unidirectional replication origin on the plasmid. These results demonstrate the presence of the conservative (two-progeny) double-strand break repair mechanism. These experiments do not rule out the occurrence of nonconservative (one-progeny) recombination since we set up experimental conditions that should favor detection of conservative (two-progeny) recombination...|$|E
40|$|DNA interstrand cross-links (ICLs) {{block the}} strand {{separation}} necessary for essential DNA {{functions such as}} transcription and replication and, hence, represent an important class of DNA lesion. Since both strands of the double helix are affected in cross-linked DNA, {{it is likely that}} <b>conservative</b> <b>recombination</b> using undamaged homologous regions as a donor may be required to repair ICLs in an error-free manner. However, in Escherichia coli and yeast, recombination-independent mechanisms of ICL repair have been identified in addition to recombinational repair pathways. To study the repair mechanisms of interstrand cross-links in mammalian cells, we developed an in vivo reactivation assay to examine the removal of interstrand cross-links in cultured cells. A site-specific psoralen cross-link was placed between the promoter and the coding region to inactivate the expression of green fluorescent protein or luciferase genes from reporter plasmids. By monitoring the reactivation of the reporter gene, we showed that a single defined psoralen cross-link was removed in repair-proficient cells in the absence of undamaged homologous sequences, suggesting the existence of an ICL repair pathway that is independent of homologous recombination. Mutant cell lines deficient in the nucleotide excision repair pathway were examined and found to be highly defective in the recombination-independent repair of ICLs, while mutants deficient in homologous recombination were found to be proficient. Mutation analysis of plasmids recovered from transfected cells showed frequent base substitutions at or near positions opposing a cross-linked thymidine residue. Based on these results, we suggest a distinct pathway for DNA interstrand cross-link repair involving nucleotide excision repair and a putative lesion bypass mechanism...|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} use of the {{bacteriophage}} P 1 Cre-lox system for generating <b>conservative</b> site-specific <b>recombination</b> between tobacco chromosomes. Two constructs, one containing a promoterless hygromycin-resistance gene preceded by a lox site (lox-hpt) and the other containing a cauliflower mosaic virus 35 S promoter linked to a lox sequence and the cre coding region (35 S-lox-cre), were introduced separately into tobacco plants. Crosses between plants harboring either construct produced plants with the two constructs situated on different chromosomes. Plants with recombination events were identified by selecting for hygromycin resistance, a phenotype expressed upon recombination. Molecular analysis showed that these recombination events occurred specifically at the lox sites and resulted in the reciprocal exchange of flanking host DNA. Progenies of these plants showed 67 - 100 % cotransmission of the new transgenes, 35 S-lox-hpt and lox-cre, consistent with the preferential cosegregation of translocated chromosomes. These results illustrate that site-specific recombination systems can be useful tools for the large-scale manipulation of eukaryotic chromosomes in vivo...|$|R
5000|$|The diverse {{genome-wide}} repeats {{are derived}} from transposable elements, which are now understood to [...] "jump" [...] about different genomic locations, without transferring their original copies. Subsequent shuttling of the same sequences over numerous generations ensures their multiplicity throughout the genome. The limited recombination of the sequences between two distinct sequence elements known as <b>conservative</b> site-specific <b>recombination</b> (CSSR) results in inversions of the DNA segment, based on {{the arrangement of the}} recombination recognition sequences on the donor DNA and recipient DNA. Again, the orientation of two of the recombining sites within the donor DNA molecule relative to the asymmetry of the intervening DNA cleavage sequences, known as the crossover region, is pivotal to the formation of either inverted repeats or direct repeats. Thus, recombination occurring at a pair of inverted sites will invert the DNA sequence between the two sites. Very stable chromosomes have been observed with comparatively fewer numbers of inverted repeats than direct repeats, suggesting a relationship between chromosome stability and the number of repeats.|$|R
40|$|During {{secondary}} immunoglobulin (Ig) diversification in vertebrates, {{the sequence}} of the variable region of Ig genes may be altered by templated or non-templated mechanisms. In both cases, cytidine deamination by activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) in the transcribed Ig loci leads to DNA lesions, which are repaired by <b>conservative</b> homologous <b>recombination</b> (HR) during Ig gene conversion, or by non-templated mutagenesis during somatic hypermutation. The molecular basis for the differential use of these two pathways in different species is unclear. While experimental ablation of HR in avian cells performing Ig gene conversion may promote a switch to somatic hypermutation, the activity of HR processes in intrinsically hypermutating mammalian cells has not been measured to date. Employing a functional HR assay in human germinal centre like B cell lines, we detect elevated HR activity that can be enhanced by transcription and AID. Products of such recombination events mostly arise through non-conservative HR pathways, while the activity of conservative HR is low to absent. Our results identify non-conservative HR as a novel DNA transaction pathway promoted by AID and suggest that somatic hypermutation in germinal centre B cells may {{be based on a}} physiological suppression of conservative HR...|$|R
40|$|We have {{investigated}} {{the ability of the}} integrase from the Streptomyces φC 31 ‘phage to either delete or invert 1 Mb of DNA around the centromere of the human Y chromosome in chicken DT 40 hybrid somatic cells. Reciprocal and <b>conservative</b> site-specific <b>recombination</b> was observed in 54 % of cells expressing the integrase. The sites failed to recombine in the remaining cells because the sites had been damaged. The sequences of the damaged sites indicated that the damage arose as a result of repair of recombination intermediates by host cell pathways. The liability of recombination intermediates to damage is consistent with what is known about the mechanism of serine recombinase reactions. The structures of the products of the chromosome rearrangements were consistent with the published sequence of the Y chromosome indicating that the assembly of the highly repeated region between the sites is accurate to a resolution of about 50 kb. Mini-chromosomes lacking a centromere were not recovered which also suggested that neo-centromere formation occurs infrequently in vertebrate somatic cells. No ectopic recombination was observed between a φC 31 integrase attB site and the chicken genome...|$|R
40|$|The integrases are {{a diverse}} family of {{tyrosine}} recombinases which rearrange DNA duplexes {{by means of}} <b>conservative</b> site-specific <b>recombination</b> reactions. Members of this family, of which the well-studied lambda Int protein is the prototype, were previously found to share four strongly conserved residues, including an active site tyrosine directly involved in transesterification. However, few additional sequence similarities {{were found in the}} original group of 27 proteins. We have now identified a total of 81 members of the integrase family deposited in the databases. Alignment and comparisons of these sequences combined with an evolutionary analysis aided in identifying broader sequence similarities and clarifying the possible functions of these conserved residues. This analysis showed that members of the family aggregate into subfamilies which are consistent with their biological roles; these subfamilies have significant levels of sequence similarity beyond the four residues previously identified. It was also possible to map the location of conserved residues onto the available crystal structures; most of the conserved residues cluster in the predicted active site cleft. In addition, these results offer clues into an apparent discrepancy between the mechanisms of different subfamilies of integrases...|$|R
40|$|We {{designed}} DNA substrates {{to study}} intrachromosomal recombination in mammalian chromosomes. Each substrate contains a thymidine kinase (tk) gene fused to a neomycin resistance (neo) gene. The fusion gene is disrupted by an oligonucleotide containing the 18 -bp recognition site for endonuclease I-SceI. Substrates also contain a “donor” tk sequence that displays 1 % or 19 % sequence divergence {{relative to the}} tk portion of the fusion gene. Each donor serves as a potential recombination partner for the fusion gene. After stably transfecting substrates into mammalian cell lines, we investigated spontaneous recombination and double-strand break (DSB) -induced recombination following I-SceI expression. No recombination events between sequences with 19 % divergence were recovered. Strikingly, even though no selection for accurate repair was imposed, accurate <b>conservative</b> homologous <b>recombination</b> was the predominant DSB repair event recovered from rodent and human cell lines transfected with the substrate containing sequences displaying 1 % divergence. Our work is the first unequivocal demonstration that homologous recombination {{can serve as a}} major DSB repair pathway in mammalian chromosomes. We also found that Msh 2 can modulate homologous recombination in that Msh 2 deficiency promoted discontinuity and increased length of gene conversion tracts and brought about a severalfold increase in the overall frequency of DSB-induced recombination...|$|R
40|$|Using a model system, we {{have studied}} {{deletion}} formation in Bacillus subtilis. When the staphylococcal plasmids pSA 2100 (7. 1 kilobases) and pUB 110 (4. 5 kilobases) were ligated {{to one another}} at their unique XbaI sites and transformed into either rec+ or recE 4 strains of B. subtilis, an intramolecular recombination event usually occurred. Two plasmids, one of 2. 6 kilobases and the other of 9. 0 kilobases, were consistently isolated and shown by restriction enzyme analysis to be derived by recombination occurring in the pSA 2100 -pUB 110 cointegrate. Analysis of the sequence of the junctions of the recombinant plasmids and of the crossover regions of the parental plasmids suggested that a reciprocal, <b>conservative,</b> intramolecular <b>recombination</b> event had occurred between short 18 -base-pair homologous sequences that were oriented as direct repeats and bounded by regions of dyad symmetry. Evidence is presented that the above illegitimate recombination event is biased to occur intramolecularly and that randomly chosen direct repeats of either 22 or 29 base pairs are not sufficient to support recombination. The recombination event occurs in recA 1, recB 2, recD 3, recE 5, recL 16, recM 13, polA 59, polA 13, uvr- 22, uvr- 13, and stb mutants of B. subtilis and does not require that the competent state be established...|$|R
40|$|Thousands of DNA {{deletion}} events {{occur during}} macronuclear {{development in the}} ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila. In two deleted genomic regions, designated M and R, the eliminated sequences form circles that can be detected by PCR. However, the circles are not normal products of the reaction pathway. The circular forms occur at very low levels in conjugating cells, but are stable. Sequencing analysis showed {{that many of the}} circles (as many as 50 % of those examined) reflected a precise deletion in the M and R regions. The remaining circles were either smaller or larger and contained varying lengths of sequences derived from the chromosomal DNA surrounding the eliminated region. The chromosomal junctions left behind after deletion were more precise, although deletions in either the M or R regions can generate any of several alternative junctions (1). Some new chromosomal junctions were detected in the present study. The results suggest that the deleted segment is released as a linear DNA species that is degraded rapidly. The species is only rarely converted to the stable circles we detect. The deletion mechanism is different from those proposed for deletion events in hypotrichous ciliates (2 - 4), and does not reflect a <b>conservative</b> site-specific <b>recombination</b> process such as that promoted by the bacteriophage lambda integrase (5) ...|$|R
40|$|Whereas oncogenic retroviruses {{are common}} in animals, human T-lymphotropic virus 1 (HTLV- 1) is the only {{transmissible}} retrovirus associated with cancer in humans and is etiologically linked to adult T-cell leukemia. The leukemogenesis process is still largely unknown, but relies on extended survival and clonal expansion of infected cells, which in turn accumulate genetic defects. A common feature of human tumor viruses is their ability to stimulate proliferation and survival of infected pretumoral cells and then hide by establishing latency in cells that have acquired a transformed phenotype. Whereas disruption of the DNA repair {{is one of the}} major processes responsible for the accumulation of genomic abnormalities and carcinogenesis, the absence of DNA repair also poses the threat of cell-cycle arrest or apoptosis of virus-infected cells. This study describes how the HTLV- 1 p 30 viral protein inhibits <b>conservative</b> homologous <b>recombination</b> (HR) DNA repair by targeting the MRE 11 /RAD 50 /NBS 1 complex and favors the error-prone nonhomologous-end–joining (NHEJ) DNA-repair pathway instead. As a result, HTLV- 1 p 30 may facilitate the accumulation of mutations in the host genome and the cumulative risk of transformation. Our results provide new insights into how human tumor viruses may manipulate cellular DNA-damage responses to promote cancer...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Phage-encoded serine integrases, such as φC 31 integrase, {{are widely}} used for genome engineering. Fifteen such integrases have been {{described}} but their utility for genome engineering has not been compared in uniform assays. RESULTS: We have compared fifteen serine integrases for their utility for DNA manipulations in mammalian cells after first demonstrating that all were functional in E. coli. Chromosomal recombination reporters were used to show that seven integrases were active on chromosomally integrated DNA in human fibroblasts and mouse embryonic stem cells. Five of the remaining eight enzymes were active on extra-chromosomal substrates thereby demonstrating {{that the ability to}} mediate extra-chromosomal recombination is no guide to ability to mediate site-specific recombination on integrated DNA. All the integrases that were active on integrated DNA also promoted DNA integration reactions that were not mediated through <b>conservative</b> site-specific <b>recombination</b> or damaged the recombination sites but the extent of these aberrant reactions varied over at least an order of magnitude. Bxb 1 integrase yielded approximately two-fold more recombinants and displayed about two fold less damage to the recombination sites than the next best recombinase; φC 31 integrase. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the Bxb 1 and φC 31 integrases are the reagents of choice for genome engineering in vertebrate cells and that DNA damage repair is a major limitation upon the utility of this class of site-specific recombinase...|$|R
40|$|The role of {{mismatch}} repair proteins {{has been well}} studied {{in the context of}} DNA repair following DNA polymerase errors. Particularly in yeast, MSH 2 and MSH 6 have also been implicated in the regulation of genetic recombination, whereas MutL homologs appeared to be less important. So far, {{little is known about the}} role of the human MutL homolog hMLH 1 in recombination, but recently described molecular interactions suggest an involvement. To identify activities of hMLH 1 in this process, we applied an EGFP-based assay for the analysis of different mechanisms of DNA repair, initiated by a targeted double-stranded DNA break. We analysed 12 human cellular systems, differing in the hMLH 1 and concomitantly in the hPMS 1 and hPMS 2 status via inducible protein expression, genetic reconstitution, or RNA interference. We demonstrate that hMLH 1 and its complex partners hPMS 1 and hPMS 2 downregulate <b>conservative</b> homologous <b>recombination</b> (HR), particularly when involving DNA sequences with only short stretches of uninterrupted homology. Unexpectedly, hMSH 2 is dispensable for this effect. Moreover, the damage-signaling kinase ATM and its substrates BLM and BACH 1 are not strictly required, but the combined effect of ATM/ATR-signaling components may mediate the anti-recombinogenic effect. Our data indicate a protective role of hMutL-complexes in a process which may lead to detrimental genome rearrangements, in a manner which does not depend on {{mismatch repair}}...|$|R
40|$|The oncogenic role of Bcl- 2 is {{generally}} attributed to its protective effect against apoptosis. Here, we show a novel role for Bcl- 2 : the specific inhibition of the <b>conservative</b> RAD 51 <b>recombination</b> pathway. Bcl- 2 or Bcl-xL overexpression inhibits UV-C-, γ-ray- or mutant p 53 -induced homologous recombination (HR). Moreover, Bcl- 2 recombination inhibition {{is independent of}} the role of p 53 in G 1 arrest. At an acute double-strand break in the recombination substrate, Bcl- 2 specifically inhibits RAD 51 -dependent gene conversion without affecting non-conservative recombination. Bcl- 2 consistently thwarts recombination stimulated by RAD 51 overexpression and alters Rad 51 protein by post-translation modification. Moreover, a mutant G 145 ABcl- 2, which is defective in Bax interaction and in apoptosis repression, also inhibits recombination, showing that the death and recombination repression functions of Bcl- 2 are separable. Inhibition of error-free repair pathways by Bcl- 2 results in elevated frequencies of mutagenesis. The Bcl- 2 gene therefore combines two separable cancer-prone phenotypes: apoptosis repression and a genetic instability/mutator phenotype. This dual phenotype could represent a mammalian version of the bacterial SOS repair system...|$|R
40|$|Modern light microscopical {{techniques}} {{were employed to}} follow dynamical nuclear processes during the cell cycle and during DNA-repair. Laser-UVA-microirradiation The protein Rad 51 {{is essential for the}} repair of double-strand breaks (DSBs) via the <b>conservative</b> homologous <b>recombination</b> repair pathway. To test the hypothesis that Rad 51 localizes to damaged sites during DSB repair, a laser-UVA-microirradiation system was established. With this system spots with sizes around 1 µm in nuclei of living cells can be irradiated with UVA-light. After sensitization of cells by incorporation of BrdU into nuclear DNA and staining with the live cell dye Hoechst 33258, the system can be used to introduce double-strand breaks and single-strand breaks in the irradiated spots. The response of Rad 51 to microirradiation By use of laser-UVA microirradiation the localization of Rad 51 at damaged sites containing DNA double-strand breaks could be demonstrated. The accumulation of Rad 51 at microirradiated sites was followed in cells fixed at increasing times after microirradiation. First Rad 51 accumulations were visible 5 - 10 minutes after irradiation, and the number of cells with Rad 51 accumulations increased until a plateau was reached 20 - 30 minutes after irradiation. In contrast, the majority of irradiated cells had accumulations of Mre 11 protein already 5 - 10 minutes after irradiation. This is consistent with reports that nuclear Mre 11 foci appeared early in the response to ionizing radiation, but absolute response times were faster after microirradiation than after ionizing radiation. Large-scale nuclear patterns were microirradiated, and Rad 51 accumulations that reflected the shape of the irradiated patterns were found up to eight hours after irradiation. This conservation of the pattern of Rad 51 accumulations, which reflect sites containing the damaged DNA, indicated that the chromatin in the irradiated cells performs no large scale reordering in response to DNA damage. The dynamics of chromosomes and chromosome territories In 1909 Theodor Boveri forwarded the hypothesis that arrangements of chromosome territories (CTs) are stably maintained during interphase, but subject to changes during mitosis. In the last decade several groups reported evidence for the stability of CT arrangements, but considerable movements of chromosomal subregions were also observed. The data concerning the maintenance or reordering of CTs during mitosis have been contradictory. Live cell imaging To follow the movements of chromosomes and CTs, a novel experimental approach was taken. Cells expressing a fusion protein of the core histone H 2 B with GFP (H 2 B-GFP) stably incorporate H 2 B-GFP into nucleosomes. In these cells chromatin regions were selectively marked by laser-photobleaching and followed by live cell microscopy. To this end, a live cell imaging system was established at a confocal laser-scanning microscope, which allows the observation of living cells for several days. Chromatin movements visualized by photobleached H 2 B-GFP To track possible movements in interphase cell nuclei, stripe patterns were bleached into nuclei at several stages of interphase. These patterns were retained for up to two hours, until they became invisible due to the replacement of bleached H 2 B-GFP by unbleached H 2 B-GFP, supporting the hypothesis that CT order is stably maintained during interphase. Nuclei, in which all chromatin except for a contiguous zone at one nuclear pole was bleached, were followed through mitosis. At prophase a number of unbleached chromosomal segments became visible. The segments showed a variable degree of clustering in metaphase. When daughter nuclei were formed, the segments locally decondensed into patches of unbleached chromatin. In all daughter cells the patches were separated by bleached chromatin, and clustered to a variable extent. These observations support the hypothesis that changes of chromosome neighborhoods occur during mitosis and that CT neighborhoods can profoundly vary from one cell cycle to the next...|$|R
