Rischbeith, the WSG and the Women's Christian Temperance Union argued that this would unfairly impact women and destroy their reputations. Rischbieth's WSG challenged the Bill while Edith Cowan, Roberta Jull and the National Council of Women supported it. This difference of opinion caused a bitter rift between various members of the women's movements in WA and was translated to the international scene when Rischbieth led a delegation to the 1923 International Woman Suffrage Alliance assembly in Rome. There, the differences saw telegrams of protest from the WA and Victorian women's groups against Rischbieth's claims to represent all Australian women.|$|E

40|$|Outright bank {{failures}} without prior indication of financial instability are very rare. Supervisory authorities monitor banks constantly. Thus, they usually obtain early warning signals that precede ultimate failure and, in fact, banks {{can be regarded}} as troubled to varying degrees before outright closure. But to our knowledge virtually all studies that predict {{bank failures}} neglect the ordinal nature of bank distress. Exploiting the distress database of the Deutsche Bundesbank we distinguish four different distress events that banks experience. Only the worst entails a bank to exit the market. Weaker orders of distress are, first, <b>compulsory</b> <b>notifications</b> of the authorities about potential problems, second, corrective actions such as warnings and hearings and, third, actions by banking pillar's insurance schemes. Since the four categories of hazard functions are not proportional, we specify a generalized ordered logit model to estimate the respective probabilities of distress simultaneously.

DESIGN [...] The study design was descriptive. SUBJECTS [...] The population resident in the city of Madrid. MAIN RESULTS [...] There was a high correlation between the cases notified to the <b>compulsory</b> disease <b>notification</b> system and those listed by the sentinel network (r = 0. 91, p < 0. 001, r 2 = 0. 82). The epidemic activity during the period 1991 - 92 was centred approximately on week 48 in 1991 and week 6 in 1992 (24 November 1991 - 8 February 1992). Altogether 913 cases of influenza were notified through the sentinel network. The greatest number of cases occurred in people aged between 20 and 39 years. CONCLUSION [...] For the epidemiological surveillance of influenza it is necessary to develop systems that can quickly detect epidemic periods and provide information about populations at risk, in addition to systems that isolate and identify seasonal epidemic viruses. Both types of data will help the development of adequate public health policies. Sentinel networks provide these data and offer additional advantages such as lower cost...|$|R

Thanks to the signaling opportunity that arises when notification is voluntary, voluntary notification leads to lower enforcement costs for the regulator and lower notification costs for the merging parties.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the proportion of}} health services that fill out the <b>compulsory</b> <b>notification</b> and what the main difficulties to fill it out are. Methods: A study was carried out with two different approaches. For the quantitative approach, a cross sectional study was performed, with telephone data collection. In the state of São Paulo, 291 health services that had reported providing care to women who suffer from sexual violence were identified. The sample was composed of 172 services that reported providing emergency care to women. In the qualitative approach, case studies were conducted. Six cities were chosen by intention and convenience. For each of them, professionals from two health services were invited to participate. Forty-five semi-structured interviews were conducted. For quantitative data, a descriptive analysis was carried out. For qualitative data, a thematic analysis of content was performed. Results: The proportion of health services which reported always filling out the notification in cases of sexual violence was 79. 1 %.

40|$|My {{daily work}} as a {{clinical}} nurse in a regional sexual health clinic regularly incorporated consultations with clients being tested and diagnosed with Chlamydia trachomatis (chlamydia) infection. Chlamydia infections are predominately diagnosed in the younger, sexually active {{segments of the population}} and are mostly asymptomatic, with the potential to progress to severe sequelae such as pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) (Westrom 1995). The current recommended treatment is azithromycin 1 gram orally as a single dose (British Association for Sexual Health and HIV (BASHH) 2002; Workowski and Levine 2002; The Royal Australasian College of Physicians, Australasian Chapter of Sexual Health Medicine et al. 2004). The challenge for health service providers/public health agencies is, therefore, the identification of those asymptomatic cases by testing, and the provision of timely and effective treatment. Reliable information on chlamydia testing rates or even numbers of tests performed is sparse, thus not allowing the calculation of prevalences or incidences. However, most health systems in developed countries have notification systems and population data that allow the calculation of notification rates. Notification rates in developed countries have been steadily increasing over recent years; for example, in the United States of America (US) notification rates per 100, 000 population increased from 304 in 1999 to 392 in 2004, in the United Kingdom (UK) from 101 to 180, and in Sweden from 188 to 355, respectively. The situation seems especially dramatic in Australia, where notification rates between 1999 and 2004 more than doubled from 73 to 177 (Low 2004; Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing 2005; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2005). A more detailed analysis of the Australian notification rates reveals distinct differences between states. Notification rates are highest in the Northern Territory (437 in 1999 and 782 in 2004), followed by Queensland (125 in 1999 and 222 in 2004), where they are still well above the national average. A further breakdown of the Queensland data by Health Service District shows higher notification rates still for the northern districts, with the Townsville Health Service District notification rates also doubling over this five-year period – 213 in 1999 and 456 in 2004 – albeit on a considerably higher level than the overall Queensland rates. While the increase in notification rates may be due to many factors, including more sensitive tests, improvements in notification processes and more testing, and repeat testing it is very likely that they also reflect an increase in real infection rates in the community (Gotz, Lindback et al. 2002; Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing 2005; Chen and Donovan 2005). Attempts to manage the evident chlamydia epidemic in developed countries differ by jurisdiction. They include recommendations to opportunistically screen high-risk populations, systems to follow up positive cases, changes of legislation to make partner <b>notification</b> <b>compulsory</b> and plans for a systematic screening program. However, all these attempts seem to have had very limited success, as evidenced by the everincreasing notification rates. In Australia, attempts to curb this epidemic by means of more or less well-organised health promotion campaigns, relying on testing or screening by the general primary healthcare sector or the 'Well Persons' Health Check' in Indigenous communities between 1998 and 2000, were apparently without measurable success. None of the implemented measures have resulted in a sustained reduction in notification rates (Miller, McDermott et al. 2002; Miller, McDermott et al. 2003; Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing 2005). Some reasons for the failure of the measures undertaken in Australia relate to a lack of clear government commitment, with low resource allocation and the lack of a well-coordinated approach. The situation is further hampered by the mainly 'passive' methods undertaken; that is, relying on the initiative of the people at risk to get tested as opposed to actively approaching them. A further major general impediment, especially when only 'passive' approaches are employed, is the widespread nature of the population in Australia. The availability of health services decreases substantially in regional centres and even more so in remote areas...|$|R

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Clinical and epidemiologic data were gathered by a <b>compulsory</b> <b>notification</b> system during the period 2003 - 2011. Bacterial identification, antibiotic resistance profile, emm-typing, pulsed field gel electrophoresis typing and virulence profile were analyzed by a central reference laboratory. A review of published pediatric cases of GAS meningitis from the last 45 years was undertaken and compared with the Brazilian series. RESULTS: The incidence of GAS meningitis among the pediatric population was 0. 06 cases per 100, 000 children per year and was associated with a case fatality rate of 43 %. Neonatal age and the presence of an associated toxic shock syndrome were identified as risk factors for death. A distant focus of infection was present in {{more than half of the}} patients in the literature and in 36 % in the Brazilian case series.

The disease is considered endemic in northern Paran&# 225;. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the clinical, laboratory and epidemiological aspects {{of patients with}} American {{cutaneous leishmaniasis}} treated at Clinics Hospital, State University of Londrina, Brazil (Paran&# 225;). METHODS: This was an observational, cross-sectional, retrospective and descriptive study. The medical records of patients with American cutaneous leishmaniasis treated at the University Hospital of Londrina - Paran&# 225;, from 1998 to 2009 were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 470 patients, with prevalence of 8. 72 cases / 100, 000 inhabitants, participated in the study. Most patients were male, aged 21 - 40 years, with a single ulcerated lesion as the most common clinical presentation, located mainly in an exposed area of the body. With regard to immunological tests, the Montenegro intradermal reaction was positive in 84. 4 % of cases. Treatment with pentavalent antimony was well tolerated, and patient follow-up for a year occurred in 59 % of cases. CONCLUSION: American cutaneous leishmaniasis is still an endemic disease in the region, with a high potential for morbidity, but with a cure rate of around 95 % after treatment.

However, the incidence and prevalence of paracoccidiodomycosis is underestimated {{because of the lack of}} <b>compulsory</b> <b>notification.</b> If paracoccidiodomycosis is not diagnosed and treated early and adequately, the endemic fungal infection could result in serious sequelae. While the Paracoccidioides brasiliensis (P. brasiliensis) complex has been known to be the causal agent of paracoccidiodomycosis, a new species, Paracoccidioides lutzii (P. lutzii), has been reported in Rondônia, where the disease has reached epidemic levels, and in the Central West and Pará. Accurate diagnoses and availability of antigens that are reactive with the patients’ sera remain significant challenges. Therefore, the present guidelines aims to update the first Brazilian consensus on paracoccidioidomycosis by providing evidence-based recommendations for bedside patient management. This consensus summarizes etiological, ecoepidemiological, molecular epidemiological, and immunopathological data, with emphasis on clinical, microbiological, and serological diagnosis and management of clinical forms and sequelae, as well as in patients with comorbidities and immunosuppression. The consensus also includes discussion of outpatient treatments, severe disease forms, disease prevalence among special populations and resource-poor settings, a brief review of prevention and control measures, current challenges and recommendations...|$|E

It is a public health problem in our country. In the Americas, Brazil is the most responsible for the endemic and ranks first in the absolute number of cases worldwide. It is a reportable disease, the cases should be entered in the Information System for Notifiable Diseases (SINAN). As the Ministry of Health operational classification of leprosy cases considered paucibacillary (PB) and multibacillary (MB). It {{is important to note that}} this research will contribute for the strategic planning and actions regarding the prevention of leprosy. The aim of this study was to identify the incidence of reported cases of leprosy as a clinical form at Sinop - MT and the cure rate between the years 2006 to 2010. This is a quantitative research conducted by documentary SINAN with verification survey data in Sinop through <b>compulsory</b> <b>notification</b> and investigation in the period 2006 - 2010. The results show that, the city has a higher incidence and cure rates as Borderline leprosy. In the future, it is expected that cases even decrease gradually due to the interruption in the transmission chain with the diagnostics performed during said period. </p...|$|E
40|$|Human cystic {{echinococcosis}} (CE) is {{a widespread}} zoonosis. Cases occurring in Germany are considered to result from imported infection and it is unclear if Echinococcus granulosus (sensu lato) is still transmitted in Germany. Therefore, exposure was investigated in 15 patients with cystic echinococcosis (7 female, 8 male; age-range 16 - 68, with a median of 48 years) {{who grew up in}} Germany. Fourteen patients had most likely acquired their infection in rural Germany, 11 from local dogs, one from an imported dog, two without obvious dog contacts. Taking into account multiple conceivable confounding factors might also account for some of infections: contacts with imported dogs or contact with dogs during travel in highly endemic regions, and ingestion of food contaminated by worm ova, whether in Germany or abroad. However, in at least two cases autochthonous transmission is beyond doubt, because these patients had never left Germany. The long pre-symptomatic development of cystic echinococcosis does not allow for a precise evaluation of the actual epidemiological situation. <b>Compulsory</b> <b>notification</b> of human cystic echinococcosis is an important instrument in the surveillance of the disease in humans. Regular inquiries at laboratories carrying out work in the field of veterinary medicine and at slaughterhouses, supervision of dogs at risk as well as genetic investigations on the strain or species of the causal agent of cystic echinococcosis are needed...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To assess {{maternal}} mortality in Rio Grande do Norte, {{in the series}} 2003 - 2008, data from the Mortality Information System (SIM) and the Committee on Maternal Mortality (MMR) of the state. Methods: A descriptive study of population-based data on {{maternal mortality}} secondary collected by the SIM state through the program Tabwin, version 3. 2, and CMM-RN, through the records and file reports. Results: We found {{that the percentage of}} maternal deaths investigated and confirmed by the Committee in relation to the registered on SIM ranged from 3 % in 2003, decreasing to 1 % in 2007, which is very small compared to total deaths of women in childbearing age in the period studied. Conclusions: It is possible to perceive weaknesses of the epidemiological surveillance of maternal deaths in the screening and a performance of the Committee in investigating these deaths far below those recorded in the on SIM, showing underreporting, data incompleteness and lack of consistency in the flow of information between these banks, making it impossible to compare the existing information. It is suggested that the Ordinances No. 1172 / 2004 and No 1119 / 2008 of the Ministry of Healthcare have to be complied, that surveillance supervises the registration of maternal death as an event of <b>compulsory</b> <b>notification</b> and that a punitive effect for municipalities that fail to comply with this protocol is established. These measures will help to reduce maternal mortalit...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The study {{aimed to}} discuss the {{violence}} against children and adolescents and the responsibility of health professionals in the identification and notification of these events. Data source: A bibliographic survey was carried out on the portal of the Virtual Health Library, {{in order to identify}} the publications on the theme of violence against children and adolescents, including terms related to notification of cases of ill-treatment. The research was carried out from August to November 2012 and was selected publications in the period of 2001 to 2012, in addition to institutional material from the Ministry of Health and relevant legislation about the issue researched. Data synthesis: The study demonstrated that the National Policy for the Reduction of Morbidity and Mortality from Accidents and Violence has become a <b>compulsory</b> <b>notification</b> of all cases, suspected or confirmed abuse, in order to trigger a process that aims to stop attitudes and violent behavior on the part of any aggressor, in addition to promoting care socio-health focused on the protection of the victims. However, unprepared to deal with such situations, many professionals will no longer perform the notification by believing that the violence is a fact that belongs to legal and public safety, not characterizing a health problem. Conclusions: It is concluded that there is a gap in the notifications and identifications of these cases by health professionals and, therefore, the implementation of programs of continuing education services is essential...|$|E
40|$|Background: Envenomation {{remains a}} {{neglected}} public health issue in most tropical countries. A {{better understanding of}} the epidemiology of bites and stings by venomous animals should facilitate their prevention and management. This study aimed to explore the benefits that could be derived from the <b>compulsory</b> <b>notification</b> of cases as it is now routinely practiced in Brazil. Methods: The Brazilian Notifiable Diseases Information System (SINAN) was consulted online for the 2001 - 2012 period on all envenomations by venomous terrestrial animals. We studied the incidence, severity, number of deaths, gender, season of accident and time between the accident and hospital consultation. Results: In total, 1, 192, 667 accidents and 2, 664 deaths from terrestrial venomous animals (snakes, scorpions, spiders, bees and caterpillars) were reported in Brazil during these 12 years, the circumstances of which are detailed in this study. Most envenomations and deaths were caused by snakebites and scorpion stings. However, incidence and mortality showed high regional variations. During this period, the steady and parallel increase of the cases from all the species resulted from several factors including the human population increase, gradual improvement of data collection system and, probably, environmental and socioeconomic factors affecting in a different way the incidence of envenomation by each zoological group and by region. Conclusion: Mandatory reporting of cases appears to be a useful tool to improve the management of envenomations. However, local studies should be continued to account for the variability of accident circumstances and refine measures necessary for their management...|$|E
40|$|Background and Objectives: Tuberculosis (TB), a {{communicable}} infectious disease, is a {{major public}} health problem in Brazil and worldwide, integrating the National List of <b>Compulsory</b> <b>Notification</b> Diseases. Due to the high incidence observed, the city of Santa Cruz do Sul {{is one of the}} priority municipalities for disease notification control in the state of Rio Grande do Sul. In this context, the Family Health Strategies (FHS) are important contributors to the notification process, as they are being increasingly used as points of access into the health system and disease control units. This study aims to establish the prevalence of notification of TB cases in FHS units in Santa Cruz do Sul. Methods: The present was an observational, cross-sectional study. Data from families registered in 11 FHS units in the city of Santa Cruz do Sul, related to the year 2013, were used. Results: The total number of reported cases was 17, all of which were aged 15 years or older. The files did not specify the gender of the reported individuals. The prevalence of tuberculosis in the total FHS units analyzed was 0. 51 / 1, 000 registered individuals. Conclusion: The high rate of TB cases in the municipality may be related to an increase in the quality of active search of patients, leading to a higher number of notifications by the FHS units. This high rate of notifications is relevant, as it discloses the importance of the FHS in the creation and adoption of preventive measures...|$|E
