25|$|In 2006 {{stood for}} Election for the Swedish Moderate Party, on an agenda of {{promoting}} entrepreneurship and strengthening schools and universities. Maria Borelius was elected a Member of Parliament from the Stockholm County, and became Minister for Foreign Trade in the centre-right government that was formed after the election. Within {{a few weeks}} two ministers had resigned, and Borelius was one of them. She admitted that she during the 1990s, when her four children were small, had used child-care without reporting to the tax authorities and paying the full 32% social fees, and in the media frenzy that followed, resigned. The Swedish Government has since then changed the system by which private <b>child</b> <b>care</b> <b>is</b> partly paid through the so-called “RUT” reforms.|$|E

Data {{on the use of}} <b>child</b> curative <b>care</b> <b>were</b> collected in two rural areas of Bangladesh—Abhoynagar Thana of Jessore District and Mirsarai Thana of Chittagong District—in March 1997. In estimating the use of <b>child</b> curative <b>care,</b> the nested multinomial logit specification was used. The results of the analysis indicate that a woman's involvement in a credit union or income generation affected the likelihood that curative <b>child</b> <b>care</b> <b>was</b> used. Household wealth decreased the likelihood that the child had an illness episode and affected the likelihood that curative <b>child</b> <b>care</b> <b>was</b> sought.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the association between early <b>child</b> <b>care</b> {{on the development of}} behavior problems. At the age of 5 years, <b>child</b> <b>care</b> information <b>was</b> collected from parents on a large group of twins who were born between 1985 and 1997. Mothers and fathers rated the behavior of the child at ages 3, 7, and 10 years using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and teachers reported on the same children’s behaviors using the Teacher’s Report Form (TRF) at ages 7 and 10. At the age of 3 years, children with nonparental <b>child</b> <b>care</b> experiences had more externalizing problems than children with only parental <b>child</b> <b>care.</b> The long-term effects of quantity of <b>child</b> <b>care</b> <b>were</b> mixed and were only significant for mother ratings and for children from families with a low socioeconomic status. Overall, the effect sizes of <b>child</b> <b>care</b> <b>were</b> very small (effect sizes were between. 12 and. 23). Children with a larger amount of <b>child</b> <b>care</b> did not show more behavior problems, therefore it was questioned whether the increased levels of behavior problems could be attributed to quantity of <b>child</b> <b>care...</b>|$|R

50|$|Child care or childcare, child minding, daycare, or {{preschool}} is {{the caring}} for and supervision {{of a child}} or children, usually from age six weeks to age thirteen. <b>Child</b> <b>care</b> <b>is</b> the action or skill of looking after children by a day-care center, babysitter, or other providers. Child care can also include advanced learning environments that include early childhood education. <b>Child</b> <b>care</b> <b>is</b> a broad topic covering {{a wide spectrum of}} contexts, activities, social and cultural conventions, and institutions. The majority of child care institutions that are available require that child care providers have extensive training in first aid and are CPR certified. In addition, background checks, drug testing at all centers, and reference verification are normally a requirement. Child care can cost up to $15,000 for one year in the United States.

30|$|In Mexico, in 2007 a supply-side {{grant program}} to expand <b>child</b> <b>care</b> {{services}} <b>was</b> created {{with the goal}} of increasing labor force participation of poor mothers (Mateo Díaz and Rodriguez Chamussy 2013). <b>Child</b> <b>care</b> centers <b>were</b> provided with one-time initial investment subsidies to open up new centers or to improve their existing facilities. Additionally, monthly grants were provided to day care centers on a per-capita (per child) basis (Calderon 2014). The operational costs of these centers are covered by the public subsidy plus a fee collected from the parents (Staab and Gerhard 2010). Similarly, in the Republic of Korea, in 2009, the municipal government of Seoul started providing financial support to private <b>child</b> <b>care</b> centers in meeting their labor costs. In return, regulations of public <b>child</b> <b>care</b> centers <b>are</b> applied in these centers, making them semi-public.
