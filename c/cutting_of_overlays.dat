40|$|Abstract- Overlay {{network is}} a network built {{on top of}} one or more {{existing}} networks. It adds an additional layer of virtualization to the network. Overlays enhance the performance of the network. They provide various services to the underlying network for efficient resource utilization. Overlay nodes present in the network can overcome path outages in a short duration and can also bypass congestion if necessary. However theoretically if overlay nodes are substituted for every node in the network, it complicates the performance of the network. Hence optimized number <b>of</b> <b>overlay</b> nodes must be deployed. This paper reviews various available techniques for deploying overlay nodes and the impact <b>of</b> deployment <b>of</b> <b>overlay</b> nodes in the network by various methods followed by different researchers.

40|$|The mapping <b>of</b> <b>overlay</b> {{links to}} paths in the {{underlying}} network causes the phenomenon <b>of</b> multiple <b>overlay</b> links sharing bottleneck physical links, {{which leads to}} correlation <b>of</b> <b>overlay</b> link capacities. We integrate these link capacity correlations by modeling the overlay using linear capacity constraints — which accurately and succinctly capture the link correlation information. It is demonstrated through analysis and simulations that this model is more accurate in representing the true network topology and hence permits higher-bandwidth multicast. We identify the problem <b>of</b> <b>overlay</b> multicast {{in the context of}} our model <b>of</b> <b>overlays</b> with linear capacity constraints (LCC). We show that finding a multicast tree in an overlay network with LCC is NP-complete. We design an efficient heuristics algorithm to solve the problem.

METHODS: Bond strength between overlay and existing pavement are measured and analyzed for various conditions such as the type <b>of</b> <b>overlay</b> materials, compressive and flexure strength <b>of</b> <b>overlay</b> and existing pavement, and deterioration status of existing pavement. RESULTS: The strength <b>of</b> <b>overlay</b> material does not significantly influence the bond strength.

The benefits of our approach are that: (i) it extracts and encapsulates best practice in repair for overlays; (ii) it simplifies the design and implementation <b>of</b> new <b>overlays</b> (because repair issues can be treated orthogonally to basic functionality); and (iii) it supports tailorable levels <b>of</b> dependability for <b>overlays,</b> including pluggable repair strategies...|$|R
40|$|When {{failures}} {{occur in}} Internet overlay connections today, {{it is difficult}} for users to determine the root cause <b>of</b> failure.

To address this problem, we develop a passive diagnosis approach that infers the most likely cause of failure using a Bayesian network modeling the conditional probability of TCP failures given the IP addresses of the hosts along the overlay path. We collect TCP failure data for 28. 3 million TCP connections using data from the new Planetseer overlay monitoring system and train a Bayesian network for the diagnosis <b>of</b> <b>overlay</b> connection failures.

40|$|Abstract—Various overlay {{networks}} {{have been proposed}} and developed to increase flexibility on networks to address issues of the IP network. However, the existing overlay {{networks have}} two problems: 1) the topology <b>of</b> existing <b>overlays</b> is essentially full-mesh tunneling topology, 2) dependence of control plane and data plane. The full-mesh tunneling topology cannot enable the overlay routing for performance improvement of networks. The dependence of them causes complication of operations due to the isolation <b>of</b> <b>overlay</b> networks, and increases development costs. To improve the problems, we propose a new abstraction layer provides a common architecture for data planes <b>of</b> <b>overlay</b> net-works that can deploy overlay routing. Based on the architecture, we design and implement a protocol stack, called ovstack. In this paper, we describe the architecture, design and implementation, then evaluate the performance <b>of</b> <b>overlays</b> including ovstack.

40|$|Abstract—In double {{patterning}} lithography (DPL), overlay errors between two patterning {{steps of the}} same layer translate into CD variability. Since CD uniformity budget is very tight, meeting requirement <b>of</b> <b>overlay</b> control {{is one of the}} biggest challenges for deploying DPL. In this paper, we electrically evaluate overlay errors for back-end-of-line DPL with the goal of studying relative effects <b>of</b> different <b>overlay</b> sources and interactions <b>of</b> <b>overlay</b> control with design parameters. Exper-imental results show the following: 1) the expected electrical impact <b>of</b> <b>overlay</b> in a path is not significant (< 6 % worst-case RC variation) and should be the basis for determining overlay budget requirement; 2) the worst-case electrical impact <b>of</b> <b>overlay</b> in a single line remains a serious concern (up to 16. 6 % RC and up to 50 mV increase of peak crosstalk noise); 3) translational overlay error has the largest electrical impact compared to other overlay sources; and 4) overlay in y direction (x for horizontal metallization) has negligible electrical impact and, therefore, preferred routing direction should be taken into account for overlay sampling and alignment strategies. Design methods for reducing overlay electrical impact in wires are then identified. Finally, we explore positive/negative process options from an electrical perspective and conclude that positive process is preferred.

Our work is motivated {{in part by the}} work of Qiu et al [1], in which {{the interaction between}} overlay selfish routing and TE is brought up. However, our work is different in that [1] assumes each overlay user controls an infinitesimal amount of traffic demand and makes routing decisions independently. We study a single large scale and centrally controlled overlay network that controls a non-negligible portion of traffic demand and does optimal routing on application level. Akamai exemplifies this type <b>of</b> <b>overlay.</b> We further assume that the proportion <b>of</b> <b>overlay</b> traffic is significant enough to influence the routing decisions of TE. We formulate this interaction as a two-player non-cooperative non-zero sum game, where TE’s objective is to minimize the network cost as a whole, and an overlay optimizer is to minimize the overall delay for its own traffic on top of the routings set by TE. Strategies <b>of</b> <b>overlay</b> are the flow allocations <b>of</b> <b>overlay</b> traffic on logical (application) level, whereas, strategies of TE are the flow allocations of all traffic demand on physical level.

The self-organization and scalability properties that peer-to-peer-based overlay networks provide have created real-world large-scale systems like Kad, or Amazon’s Dynamo. Due to their distributed behavior, developing and evaluating large-scale overlay networks has a much higher complexity in contrast to centralized systems. To cope with this complexity, simulation has proven indispensable for design and evaluation <b>of</b> <b>overlay</b> networks. Building upon the OMNeT++ simulation environment, the OverSim framework provides widely used simulation of a large and growing set <b>of</b> <b>overlay</b> networks. Realistic environments for evaluation of such networks are crucial to obtain meaningful results, yet complex to develop and validate. The ReaSE topology and traffic generator allows to create Internet-like network topologies, background traffic, and attack traffic. In this work we integrate ReaSE with OverSim, therewith allowing for evaluation <b>of</b> <b>overlay</b> protocols upon realistic underlays and realistic background traffic. This integration provides an important step for design and evaluation of overlay-based systems and allows for meaningful results. We provide insights into runtime and memory consumptions <b>of</b> <b>overlay</b> simulations on the new ReaSE-based underlay on the one hand, and show effects on overlay protocols caused by the realistic underlay on the other hand.
