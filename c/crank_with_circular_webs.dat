40|$|In {{the current}} design method for steel I beams <b>with</b> <b>circular</b> <b>web</b> openings, the load {{carrying}} capacities {{of the beams}} {{is assumed to be}} limited by the formation of plastic hinges at the top tee-sections at the low moment side of the web opening. Moreover, a linear interaction formula is used to assess the moment capacity of the tee-sections above and below the web openings under co-existing axial and shear forces. The method is regarded as conservative since the formation of plastic hinges in the top tee-sections at the low moment side of the web openings does not always cause failure. The beams are capable of carrying additional load until four plastic hinges at critical locations of the perforated sections are developed to form a Vierendeel mechanism. Moreover, the reduction in the moment capacities of the tee-sections under coexisting axial and shear forces is less severe than that anticipated by the linear interaction formula.

40|$|The {{intermittently}} rivet fastened Rectangular Hollow Flange Channel Beam (RHFCB) {{is a new}} cold-formed {{hollow section}} proposed {{as an alternative to}} welded hollow flange channel beams. It is a monosymmetric channel section made by intermittently rivet fastening two torsionally rigid rectangular hollow flanges to a web plate. This process enables the end us-ers to choose an effective combination of different web and flange plate sizes to achieve op-timum design capacities. Recent research studies focused mainly on the shear behaviour of the most commonly used lipped channel beam and welded hollow flange beam sections with and without web openings. However, no research has been undertaken on the shear behav-iour and strength of rivet fastened RHFCBs with web openings. Hence a detailed experi-mental study involving 30 shear tests was undertaken to investigate the shear behaviour and strength of rivet fastened RHFCBs <b>with</b> <b>circular</b> <b>web</b> openings. Simply supported test spec-imens of RHFCB with aspect ratios of 1. 0 and 1. 5 were loaded at mid-span until failure. Comparison of experimental shear capacities with corresponding predictions from the cur-rent Australian cold-formed steel design rules showed that the current design rules are inad-equate for the shear design of rivet fastened RHFCBs <b>with</b> <b>circular</b> <b>web</b> openings. Signifi-cant improvements to web shear buckling occurred due to the presence of rectangular hollow flanges while considerable post-buckling strength is also observed. Such enhancements to the shear behaviour and capacity were achieved with a rivet spacing of 100 mm. Improved design rules are proposed for rivet fastened RHFCBs <b>with</b> <b>circular</b> <b>web</b> openings based on the test results.

40|$|When used as floor joists, the new mono-symmetric LiteSteel beam (LSB) {{sections}} require web openings {{to provide}} access for inspections and various services. The LSBs consist of two rectangular hollow flanges connected by a slender web, and are subjected to lateral distortional buckling effects in the intermediate span range.

30|$|Researchers such as Bower (1968), Lawson (1987), Darwin (1990) {{have stated}} the {{presence}} of web openings may have big drawback on load-carrying capacity of structural members. However, the present design guides and specifications for such beams are either inadequate or difficult to use (SCI P 355 2011). This {{may be due to}} the fact that the behaviour of I-Beams with web openings is complex to understand, analyse and difficult to simplify the design procedures. Therefore, it is imperative that more elaborate investigations are carried out to provide sufficient information to understand the behaviour so that a simple design method could be developed. A few experimental and analytical studies have been reported in the past regarding SBWOs. For steel beams <b>with</b> <b>circular</b> <b>web</b> openings, most of the design rules are applicable using an equivalent rectangular opening of modified dimensions, as suggested by Redwood (1969). However, due to the simplistic approach, the load-carrying capacities of steel beams are always underestimated significantly. Elastic stress distribution in beams <b>with</b> large <b>circular</b> <b>web</b> openings has been examined by Chan and Redwood (1974) using the theory of elasticity and the curved beam analysis. To assess the load-carrying capacities of steel beams <b>with</b> several <b>circular</b> <b>web</b> openings in an explicit manner, a design method (1990) based on the research works of Olander (1953) and Sahmel (1969) was developed at the Steel Construction Institute in 1990.

There is another approach which considers explicitly the tee sections with webs of varying depths {{above and below the}} web openings according to classical curve beam analysis. While this approach is less conservative, the calculation effort is considerable. In order to study the structural behaviour of steel beams <b>with</b> <b>circular</b> <b>web</b> openings, a finite element model with both material and geometrical non-linearity was established by Chung, Lui and Ko (2000) and a set of shear moment interaction curves for steel beams <b>with</b> large <b>circular</b> <b>web</b> openings were also established.

The adoption of equivalent octagonal openings allows simple and easy incorporation of other opening shapes together with instability of web posts in steel beams with multiple web openings.

A nonlinear finite element model was developed and verified against the test results in terms of failure buckling modes.

T- beam designs come in many sizes, lengths and widths depending on what the structure is and its compression tension needs. However, the simplicity of the T-beam is in question by some who would rightly test more than one complex structure; for example, a group of researchers tested pretension inverted T-beams <b>with</b> <b>circular</b> <b>web</b> openings, <b>with</b> mixed but generally favorable results. Thus, in some cases, the extra time and effort invested in creating a more complex structure proves worthwhile.

Seven specimens including two typical cellular beams (i. e. <b>circular</b> <b>web</b> openings) and five perforated beams with novel web opening shapes were tested to investigate the failure mode and load strength of the web-post between two adjacent web openings. Fourteen numerical test specimens were developed and analysed by the finite {{element method and the}} results were compared with the full scale experiments. The effect of web opening spacing/web opening depth of web-posts was studied to investigate the effective ‘strut’ action of the web-post buckling. The effect of the web opening depth/web thickness was also studied to investigate the stability (slenderness) of the web-post subjected to vertical shear load.

There are various shapes of opening available with different dimensions of the openings. The presence of opening in the web can bring advantages in terms of minimizing the cost of the construction, however it may result into many problems which will cause cracking and deflection in the beam. Very limited studies have been done on deep beams <b>with</b> <b>circular</b> <b>web</b> opening. Therefore, this study was conducted in order to study the effects of circular opening due to the different sizes of opening located near the point load.

All beams of identical cross section of 100 mm x 500 mm and 1200 mm in length <b>with</b> <b>circular</b> opening of different sizes were provided. The beams were tested under four-point bending until failure. The results concern in this study were load deflection behavior, crack pattern and also failure mode.

40|$|This {{research}} {{addresses the}} use of thin steel C sections <b>with</b> large <b>circular,</b> hexagonal and diamond web openings in applications where service integration in beams is required or where thermal bridging of members crossing the building envelope has to be minimised. The effect of these openings in terms of combined bending and shear effects on stainless steel and thin steel C sections is evaluated. The behaviour of thin steel C sections with large web openings in shear is a new subject and the knowledge gap is mainly concerned with the local buckling around and between openings which affect {{the ability of the}} perforated section to resist shear. Simply supported beams were considered in this research. The main part of the research was divided into various parts as follows: Simple theories were developed for the design of thin steel <b>with</b> <b>circular</b> <b>web</b> openings (Tangential Stress Method) and with hexagonal web openings. The Tangential Stress Method is a method in which the tangential stresses around the web openings are determined {{as a function of the}} applied shear force. A total of 16 tests on pairs of C sections with web openings was carried out. Three groups of beams were tested as follows: 1 -	Stainless steel C sections of 210 mm depth and 70 mm width with 150 mm diameter openings at 50, 100 and 250 mm edge distances were tested. Two groups of stainless steel were tested; Austenitic and Lean Duplex (LDX) grades of 2 and 3 mm thickness. For beams with isolated and widely spaced web openings, Vierendeel bending associated with local buckling was the mode of failure. Beams with closely spaced web openings failed by web-post buckling. 2 -	Galvanized steel sections of 250 mm depth and 63 mm flange width with 150 and 180 mm diameter web openings at 60 and 90 mm edge distances were tested in 1. 5 and 1. 8 mm steel thicknesses. The failure of the C sections with isolated web openings was due to Vierendeel bending associated with local buckling. For closely spaced web openings, the failure was due to web-post buckling and twisting of the top flange. 3 -	Galvanized C sections with diamond and hexagonal web openings were tested to investigate the shape of the web openings effect on the behaviour of the beams subject to shear. The diamond-shaped openings were 180 mm deep and hexagonal openings were 167 mm deep. The failure of beams with isolated diamond-shaped web openings was due to buckling of the un-supported web next to the openings. For the C sections with pairs of openings, it was due to web-post buckling and twisting of the top flange. The bending resistances of the two C sections were then predicted from the parametric study and were compared with the design resistance calculated using section properties to BS EN 1993 - 1 - 3 and BS EN 1993 - 1 - 4.

40|$|Abstract: LiteSteel beam (LSB) {{is a new}} cold-formed steel hollow flange {{channel section}} {{produced}} using a simultaneous cold-forming and dual electric resistance welding process. It is commonly used as floor joists and bearers with web openings in residential, industrial and commercial buildings. Their shear strengths are considerably reduced when web openings are included {{for the purpose of}} locating building services. A cost effective method of eliminating the detrimental effects of a large web opening is to attach suitable stiffeners around the web openings of LSBs. Experimental and numerical studies were undertaken to investigate the shear behaviour and strength of LSBs <b>with</b> <b>circular</b> <b>web</b> openings reinforced using plate, stud, transverse and sleeve stiffeners with varying sizes and thicknesses. Both welding and varying screw-fastening arrangements were used to attach these stiffeners to the web of LSBs. Finite element models of LSBs with stiffened web openings in shear were developed to simulate their shear behaviour and strength of LSBs. They were then validated by comparing the results with experimental test results and used in a detailed parametric study. These studies have shown that plate stiffeners were the most suitable, however, their use based on the current American standards was found to be inadequate. Suitable screw-fastened plate stiffener arrangements with optimum thicknesses have been proposed for LSBs with web openings to restore their original shear capacity.

Even though this rule was shown to be quite accuate for most cases, it could sometimes give unsafe results for certain short length geometries. In reality, however, the steel will display elastic-plastic behaviour, causing these geometries to fail by plasticity of the cross-section rather than elastic instability. In this work, the design rule will be further examined by performing numerical simulations, taking into account these effects of plasiticity, as well as imperfections and geometric nonlinearity. It will be shown that the existing design rule always gives safe results for the examined geometries...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{trends of}} {{structural}} mechanics applications in {{finite element analysis}} demonstrate an increasing demand for efficient analysis tools. This paper presents a probabilistic analysis approach applied in finite element analysis for modeling prestressed inverted T-beams with web openings structure used in building service system (mechanical, electrical, communications, and plumbing). The experimental program reported in this paper tested four prestressed inverted T-beams <b>with</b> <b>circular</b> <b>web</b> openings to failure to evaluate the openings' effect on various beam behaviors. Using ANSYS, finite element models were developed to simulate beam deflection behavior. Comparison of analytical results with the available experimental results for load deflection relationships showed good agreement between both results. Probabilistic analysis methodology could predict the response (i. e., deflection, stress, strain etc) due to various combination of input variables (i. e.,Poisson`s ratio, modulus of elasticity, etc). In reality, uncertainties exist in a system and environment that may make the application of deterministic design unreliable which causes {{the values of the}} variables that are acting on the system cannot be predicted with certainty. As such, probabilistic approach was applied to the model after deterministic analysis. In this study, the probabilistic analysis approach was applied to account for the variability in fabrication. Probabilistic methodology applied in finite element modeling provides another alternative ways of structural analysis of prest stressed inverted T-beams with web openings to achieve a robust and reliable design in a more efficient way. In this study, Monte Carlo simulation was used to analyze the effect of parameter uncertainty for the prestressed inverted T-beams with web openings. From the analysis results, it was observed that the changes in prestressing force, elastic modulus of prestressing steel, ultimate tensile strength of prestressing steel and beam width tend to be the most influencing parameters, which need to be tightly controlled. As a result, from deterministic analysis and probabilistic analysis, it was found that probabilistic analysis tends to be closer to reality than deterministic methods and gives a way of designing for quality...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: LiteSteel beam (LSB) {{is a new}} cold-formed steel hollow flange {{channel section}} {{produced}} using a patented manufacturing process. It is commonly used as flexural members in residential, industrial and commercial buildings. Current practice in flooring systems is to include openings in the web element of floor joists or bearers so that building services can be located within them. Test results {{have shown that the}} shear capacity of LSBs can be reduced considerably by the inclusion of web openings. A cost effective method of eliminating the detrimental effects of a large web opening is to attach suitable stiffeners around the web openings of LSBs. A detailed experimental study consisting of 17 shear tests was therefore undertaken to investigate the shear behaviour and strength of LSBs <b>with</b> stiffened <b>circular</b> <b>web</b> openings. Both plate and stud stiffeners with varying sizes and thicknesses were attached to the web elements of LSBs using a number of screw-fastening arrangements in order to develop a suitable stiffening arrangement for LSBs. Simply supported test specimens of LSBs with an aspect ratio of 1. 5 were loaded at mid-span until failure. This paper presents the details of this experimental study of LSBs with stiffened web openings, and the results of their shear capacities and associated behavioural characteristics. Suitable screw-fastened plate stiffener arrangements have been recommended in order to restore the original shear capacity of LSBs...|$|R

Thus, there is a need to have a proper design so that it have enough strength to be sustain loading acting on it. Here the study was conducted a beam <b>with</b> two <b>circular</b> <b>web</b> opening at constant moment area with the beam dimension 200 x 400 x 3000 mm. In order to analyse these beam, ANSYS software was been used in these study although there are still many existing commercial engineering software such as STAAD PRO, LUSAS, MATLAB and etc. This is because ANSYS is an engineering stimulation software which offer stimulation solution set that a design process requires. Besides, it is widely used in industry to stimulate the response of a physical system to structural loading. By using ANSYS software, it can help to analyse complex structure without simplify the structure and also help to analyse the reaction force, deformation, deflection and axial stress as well as obtain the maximum deflection. With this study, the finding seem has been fulfil to the objectives where the results of simulation of Reinforce concrete beams with two web opening such as maximum deflection, stresses and strains has been analysed with respect to six random inputs suchas force, reinforcement diameter, link diameter, stirrups diameter and spacin...|$|R

40|$|International audienceGraphs <b>with</b> <b>circular</b> symmetry, called <b>webs,</b> {{are crucial}} for {{describing}} the stable set polytopes of two larger graph classes, quasi-line graphs[8, 12] and claw-free graphs [7, 8]. Providing a complete linear {{description of the}} stable set polytopes of claw-free graphs is a long-standing problem [9]. Ben Rebea conjectured a description for quasi-line graphs, see [12]; Chudnovsky and Seymour [2] verified this conjecture recently for quasi-line graphs not belonging to the subclass of fuzzy circular interval graphs and showed that rank facets are required in this case only. Fuzzy circular interval graphs contain all webs and even the problem of finding all facets of their stable set polytopes is open. So far, it is only known that stable set polytopes of webs with clique number = 4 having non-rank facets [10 _ 12, 15]. In this paper we prove, building on a construction for non-rank facets from [16], that the stable set polytopes of almost all webs with clique number >= 5 admit non-rank facets. This adds support {{to the belief that}} these graphs are indeed the core of Ben Rebea's conjecture. Finally, we present a conjecture how to construct all facets of the stable set polytopes of web...|$|R
