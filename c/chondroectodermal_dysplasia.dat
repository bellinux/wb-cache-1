'Six-fingered dwarfism' ('digital integer deficiency') was an {{alternative}} designation {{used for this}} condition when it was being studied in the Amish and may have served a useful function in defining this then little known condition for the medical profession, {{as well as the}} lay public. The term, however, has been found offensive by some, apparently not because of 'dwarfism,' but because of the reference to the polydactyly, which is seen as a 'freakish' labeling. For this reason, 6-fingered dwarfism has been removed as {{an alternative}} name for this entry. This leaves Ellis-van Creveld syndrome with its initialism, EVC, as the only satisfactory designation. <b>Chondroectodermal</b> <b>dysplasia</b> and mesoectodermal dysplasia do not well define the entity and are not satisfactory for general usage, either medical or otherwise.|$|E

40|$|Ellis-van Creveld {{syndrome}} {{also known}} as <b>chondroectodermal</b> <b>dysplasia</b> is a rare genetic disorder of the skeletal dysplasia type, first described by Richard WS Ellis and Simon van Creveld in 1940.

The EVC phenotype is variable and affects multiple organs.

It is a rare condition, with very few cases reported in the medical literature.

The present case report describes the EVC syndrome in a 14 -year-old girl, who presented with a tetrad of all the cardinal features and other associated features. Additional unusual dental findings such as single-rooted funnel-shaped molars, reduced crown size, enamel hypoplasia, supernumerary teeth, dental fusion, taurodontism, abnormal occlusal anatomy with wide grooves, and atypical cusps have been reported in most previous cases of this syndrome. However, in our patient, surprisingly, the teeth present were relatively non-anomalous, both clinically and radiographically (i. e., with none of the usually found abnormalities mentioned above).

40|$|Ellis-van Creveld {{syndrome}} is an autosomal recessive disorder mainly {{characterized by a}} disproportionate limb dwarfism, <b>chondroectodermal</b> <b>dysplasia,</b> congenital heart disease, postaxial polydactyly, and dysplastic fingernails and teeth.

Gross photographs, radiologic studies and pathological study were performed leading to the clinico-pathological suspicion of EvC. DNA from fresh fetal tissue was extracted for sequencing the EVC and EVC 2 genes. p. W 215 X and p. R 677 X mutations were identified in the EVC 2 gene in the fetal sample.

40|$|Simon van Creveld {{received}} {{both the}} MD and PhD degrees {{and had a}} multifaceted medical and scientific education at many hospitals and research institutes in the Netherlands, Germany, and the UK. He {{and his wife were}} the first to develop insulin for the Netherlands. His major interests were in hemophilia and hemorrhagic disorders, which accounted for 87 of his publications. In 1934, van Creveld demonstrated that a dispersed protein fraction obtained from serum could reduce the clotting time of hemophilic blood. His interest in glycogen storage disease resulted in van Creveld-von Gierke disease for which van Creveld contributed four published articles. The Ellis-van Creveld syndrome, also known as <b>chondroectodermal</b> <b>dysplasia,</b> was published in 1940 and became well known to medical geneticists.

40|$|Madelung’s {{deformity}} due to Leri-Weill Syndrome (Dyschondrosteosis) {{is a rare}} condition. Six {{cases of}} this entity involving two generations in one family are reported in this communication. The differential diagnosis of the various causes of Madelung’s deformity are briefly discussed. Leri-Weill syndrome, commonly known as dyschond-rosteosis, is a rare and interesting form of short-limbed dwarfism of the mesomelic type, characterised by Madelung’s deformity of both wrists, short forearms, and occasionally short legs. The condition was described in 1929 by Leri and Weill and differs from achondro-plasia and <b>chondroectodermal</b> <b>dysplasia</b> in that the major shortening is mesomelic and affects the companion bones of the middle segments of the limbs (Dawe et al. 1982). The disease is transmitted as an autosomal dominant with female preponderance. Though the clinical and radiological features of this rare dysplasia are almost pathognomic, yet many orthopaedic surgeons and even radiologists {{are not familiar with}} this entity. It may be because of the facts that (i) the con-dition seems to be quite uncommon and (ii) many of the cases may be confused and labelled as isolated cases of Madelung’s deformity without going into the detailed family history of the proband. Recently, we had the opportunity to diagnose this syndrome in a family of six members and considering this to be a worthwhile addition to the existing literature on this entity, we are reporting this family...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} types {{and numbers of}} cases, gestational age at {{specific}} prenatal diagnosis and diagnostic accuracy of the diagnosis of skeletal dysplasias in a prenatal population from a single tertiary center. METHODS: This was a retrospective database review of type, prenatal and definitive postnatal diagnoses and gestational age at specific prenatal diagnosis of all cases of skeletal dysplasias from a mixed referral and screening population between 1985 and 2007. Prenatal diagnoses were grouped into 'correct ultrasound diagnosis' (complete concordance with postnatal pediatric or pathological findings) or 'partially correct ultrasound diagnosis' (skeletal dysplasias found postnatally {{to be a different}} one from that diagnosed prenatally). RESULTS: We included 178 fetuses in this study, of which 176 had a prenatal ultrasound diagnosis of 'skeletal dysplasia'. In 160 cases the prenatal diagnosis of a skeletal dysplasia was confirmed; two cases with skeletal dysplasias identified postnatally had not been diagnosed prenatally, giving 162 fetuses with skeletal dysplasias in total. There were 23 different classifiable types of skeletal dysplasia. The specific diagnoses based on prenatal ultrasound examination alone were correct in 110 / 162 (67. 9 %) cases and partially correct in 50 / 162 (30. 9 %) cases, (160 / 162 overall, 98. 8 %). In 16 cases, skeletal dysplasia was diagnosed prenatally, but was not confirmed postnatally (n = 12 false positives) or the case was lost to follow-up (n = 4). The following skeletal dysplasias were recorded: thanatophoric dysplasia (35 diagnosed correctly prenatally of 40 overall), osteogenesis imperfecta (lethal and non-lethal, 31 / 35), short-rib dysplasias (5 / 10), <b>chondroectodermal</b> <b>dysplasia</b> Ellis-van Creveld (4 / 9), achondroplasia (7 / 9), achondrogenesis (7 / 8), campomelic dysplasia (6 / 8), asphyxiating thoracic dysplasia Jeune (3 / 7), hypochondrogenesis (1 / 6), diastrophic dysplasia (2 / 5), chondrodysplasia punctata (2 / 2), hypophosphatasia (0 / 2) as well as a further 7 / 21 cases with rare or unclassifiable skeletal dysplasias. CONCLUSION: Prenatal diagnosis of skeletal dysplasias can present a considerable diagnostic challenge. However, a meticulous sonographic examination yields high overall detection. In the two most common disorders, thanatophoric dysplasia and osteogenesis imperfecta (25 % and 22 % of all cases, respectively), typical sonomorphology accounts for the high rates of completely correct prenatal diagnosis (88 % and 89 %, respectively) at the first diagnostic examination...|$|E
