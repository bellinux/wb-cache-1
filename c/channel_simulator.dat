30|$|Computer {{simulators}} {{have become}} fundamental tools for the design, test, and optimization of modern mobile communication systems [1]. They provide a powerful, affordable, and reproducible means {{to assess the}} system performance. An important component of any computer simulator employed for system analysis is the model chosen to simulate the channel. This is indeed a critical component {{as most of the}} problems affecting the performance of wireless communication systems, e.g., inter-symbol interference and cross modulation, are caused by the channel [2]. There exist several different approaches to the design of fading <b>channel</b> <b>simulators,</b> such as those described in [3 – 6]. While the underlying methodology may differ, the principal objective of all stochastic <b>channel</b> <b>simulators</b> is the same: synthesizing a random process that can efficiently be realized on a software or hardware simulation platform under the constraint that its statistical properties resemble those of a nonrealizable reference channel model. A typical nonrealizable reference channel model is, for example, the Rayleigh fading channel model under isotropic scattering conditions ([7], Sec. 2.1. 2). A realizable random process constitutes the so-called channel simulation model ([8], Sec. 4.1).|$|R
40|$|<b>Channel</b> <b>simulators</b> are {{powerful}} tools that permit performance {{tests of the}} individual parts of a wireless communication system. This is relevant when new communication algorithms are tested, because {{it allows us to}} determine if they fulfill the communications standard requirements. One of these tests consists of evaluating the system performance when a communication channel is considered. In this sense, it is possible to model the channel as an FIR filter with time-varying random coefficients. If the number of coefficients is increased, then a better approach to real scenarios can be achieved; however, in that case, the computational complexity is increased. In order to address this issue, a design methodology for computing the time-varying coefficients of the fading <b>channel</b> <b>simulators</b> using consumer-designed graphic processing units (GPUs) is proposed. With the use of GPUs and the proposed methodology, it is possible for nonspecialized users in parallel computing to accelerate their simulation developments when compared to conventional software.

30|$|Two often {{desirable}} {{properties of}} any stochastic simulation model for small-scale multipath radio channels are stationarity and ergodicity. These properties enable the <b>channel</b> <b>simulator</b> to accurately emulate the channel’s statistical properties {{on the basis}} of a single simulation run (ergodicity) without requiring information on the time origin (stationarity). In the strict sense, a <b>channel</b> <b>simulator</b> is stationary if all marginal and joint probability density functions (PDFs) of the underlying random process characterizing the simulation model are independent of a time-shift ([9], pp. 297 – 303). On the other hand, a <b>channel</b> <b>simulator</b> is ergodic if the time averages of the simulation model are equal to the ensemble averages ([9], Sec. 13.1). These conditions are too stringent and can hardly be met in practice. However, the information about the channel’s statistics of order higher than 2 is rarely required to assess the performance of wireless communication systems. Hence, for most practical purposes, it suffices if the <b>channel</b> <b>simulator</b> is wide-sense stationary (WSS) and ergodic with respect to (w.r.t.) the mean value and the autocorrelation function (ACF). In [10, 11], the advantages of ergodic channel simulators versus nonergodic simulation models for the performance analysis w.r.t. the bit error probability have been demonstrated. More specifically, in [10], this observation has been done for noncoherent differential phase shift keying since the bit error probability depends on the ACF of the underlying complex Gaussian process. If the <b>channel</b> <b>simulator</b> is nonergodic, time ACF of the simulation model does not fit well with ensemble ACF of the reference model. In this case, one needs to average over different realizations of the underlying stochastic process to increase the performance, which also drastically increases the complexity of the <b>channel</b> <b>simulator.</b> Indeed, an important aspect of the statistical characterization of a <b>channel</b> <b>simulator</b> consists in determining whether the simulation model is a WSS, a mean-ergodic (ME), or an autocorrelation-ergodic (AE) random process. For some applications, such as the evaluation of diversity systems ([7], Ch. 6), it is also very important to know whether the envelope of the simulation model is a first-order stationary (FOS) process. An interesting study of the relation between the coherence interval and the spectral spread of a zero-mean WSS process and its application to mobile fading channels can be found in [12]. In addition, an investigation of the time interval within which the fading process is expected to fulfill the stationarity assumption in real-world channels can be found in [13, 14].|$|E
