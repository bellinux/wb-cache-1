40|$|The {{case study}} of <b>chimney</b> <b>liner</b> {{corrosion}} addresses three specific cases of damage of chimney systems from of stainless steels. These systems were used for flue of gas arising from the combustion of brown coal in small automatic boilers, which are used for heating. Detailed analyzes implied {{that the cause of}} devastating corrosion of the steel AISI 316 and 304 steel (CSN 17349, 17241) was particularly high content of halides (chlorides and fluorides), which caused a severe pitting corrosion, which led up to the perforation of the liner material. Simultaneous reduction of the thickness of the used sheets was due to by the general corrosion, which was caused by the sulfur in the solid fuel. The condensation then led to acid environment and therefore the corrosion below the dew point of the sulfuric acid has occurred. All is documented by metallographic analysis and microanalysis of the corrosion products...|$|E

The efficiency of the boiler would still be 90 - 95 %. ...|$|R

However, since a pot boiler needs to be manipulated {{into and out of}} the fire (typically in anthropological observations, using sticks of green wood) at arm's length, they start off weighing up to several kilogrammes, and shrink by fragmentation hearth stones and <b>chimney</b> <b>liners</b> are typically larger.|$|R

Followed by a description {{and analysis of the}} product in the entire production cycle, material and product spectrum. Based on the results of current production is created proposal to streamline the machining technology with a view to increase productivity and reduce defective products, which means determine the material of a tool and the method of machining. The work is finished by technical-economic assessment, where the summary and recommendation of the proposed solution are...|$|R

40|$|The {{brick and}} {{structural}} clay products industry {{is made up}} primarily of facilities that manufacture structural brick from clay, shale, {{or a combination of}} the two. These facilities are classified under standard industrial classification (SIC) code 3251, brick and structural clay tile. Facilities that manufacture structural clay products, such as clay pipe, adobe brick, <b>chimney</b> pipe, flue <b>liners,</b> drain tiles, roofing tiles, and sewer tiles are classified under SIC code 3259, structural clay products, not elsewhere classified. 11. 3. 2 Process Description 3 - 6 The manufacture of brick and structural clay products involves mining, grinding, screening and blending of the raw materials followed by forming, cutting or shaping, drying, firing, cooling, storage, and shipping of the final product. A typical brick manufacturing process is shown in Figure 11. 3 - 1. The raw materials used in the manufacture of brick and structural clay products include surface clays and shales, which are mined in open pits. The moisture content of the raw materials ranges from a low of about 3 percent at some plants to a high of about 15 percent at other plants. Some facilities have onsite mining operations, while others bring in raw material by truck or rail. The raw material is typically loaded by truck or front-end loader into a primary crusher for initial size reduction. The material is then conveyed to a grinding room, which houses several grinding mills and banks of screens that produce a fine material that i...|$|R
