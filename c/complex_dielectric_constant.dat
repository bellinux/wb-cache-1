50|$|When an {{electromagnetic}} wave strikes a plane surface {{such as the}} ground, part of the wave is transmitted {{into the ground and}} part of it is reflected, according to the Fresnel coefficients. If the ground is a very good conductor then almost all of the wave is reflected (180° out of phase), whereas a ground modeled as a (lossy) dielectric can absorb a large amount of the wave's power. The power remaining in the reflected wave, and the phase shift upon reflection, strongly depend on the wave's angle of incidence and polarization.

5000|$|The <b>complex</b> <b>{{dielectric}}</b> <b>constant</b> is , where [...] is {{the dielectric}} constant, [...] is the electrical conductivity, [...] is the field frequency, and [...] is the imaginary unit. [...] This expression has been useful for approximating the dielectrophoretic behavior of particles such as {{red blood cells}} (as oblate spheroids) or long thin tubes (as prolate ellipsoids) allowing the approximation of the dielectrophoretic response of carbon nanotubes or tobacco mosaic viruses in suspension.These equations are accurate for particles when the electric field gradients are not very large (e.g., close to electrode edges) or when the particle is not moving along an axis in which the field gradient is zero (such as {{at the center of}} an axisymmetric electrode array), as the equations only take into account the dipole formed and not higher order polarization. When the electric field gradients are large, or when there is a field null running {{through the center of the}} particle, higher order terms become relevant, and result in higher forces.To be precise, the time-dependent equation only applies to lossless particles, because loss creates a lag between the field and the induced dipole. When averaged, the effect cancels out and the equation holds true for lossy particles as well. An equivalent time-averaged equation can be easily obtained by replacing E with Erms, or, for sinusoidal voltages by dividing the right hand side by 2.These models ignores the fact that cells have a complex internal structure and are heterogeneous. A multi-shell model in a low conducting medium can be used to obtain information of the membrane conductivity and the permittivity of the cytoplasm. For a cell with a shell surrounding a homogeneous core with its surrounding medium considered as a layer, as seen in Figure 2, the overall dielectric response is obtained from a combination of the properties of the shell and core.|$|E

40|$|The {{magneto-optic}} Kerr angle {{spectrum of}} a single crystal of MnBi was measured at room temperature and also calculated with the TB-LMTO methods including the spin-orbit interaction. Previously measured Kerr spectra with thin films had two negative peaks, except for one film grown in ultra high vacuum. The later had a first peak and a shoulder at the second peak position, indicating the second originated from oxygen in the other films. Comparing first-principles calculations and previous thin-film results with our single crystal data indicated that the second peak originated from {{the combination of a}} weak intrinsic MnBi peak and oxygen in the sample. The <b>complex</b> <b>dielectric</b> <b>constants</b> and magneto-optic Kerr spectra of electro-polished (100), (110), and (111) planes Ni 2 MnGa were measured.

Measured Kerr and optical spectra with three surfaces at room temperature had the same peak positions, but different amplitudes. The difference between (100) and (110) surfaces are probably due to the polishing process, not intrinsic bulk properties.

Dielectric property of MoS 2 is desired for the optoelectronic application.

40|$|Recent {{studies of}} saccharides' {{peculiar}} anti-freezing and anti-dehydration properties {{point to a}} close association with their strong hydration capability and destructuring effect on the hydrogen bond (HB) network of bulk water. The underlying mechanisms are, however, not well understood. In this respect, examination of the <b>complex</b> <b>dielectric</b> <b>constants</b> of saccharide aqueous solutions, especially over a broadband frequency region, should provide interesting insights into these properties, since the dielectric responses reflect corresponding dynamics over the time scales measured. In order to do this, the <b>complex</b> <b>dielectric</b> <b>constants</b> of glucose solutions between 0. 5 GHz and 12 THz (from the microwave to the far-infrared region) were measured. We then performed analysis procedures on this broadband spectrum by decomposing it into four Debye and two Lorentz functions, with particular attention being paid to the β relaxation (glucose tumbling), δ relaxation (rotational polarization of the hydrated water), slow relaxation (reorientation of the HB network water), fast relaxation (rotation of the non-HB water), and intermolecular stretching vibration (hindered translation of water). On {{the basis of this}} analysis, we revealed that the hydrated water surrounding the glucose molecules exhibits a mono-modal relaxational dispersion with 2 - 3 times slower relaxation times than unperturbed bulk water and with a hydration number of around 20. Furthermore, other species of water with distorted tetrahedral HB water structures, as well as increases in the relative proportion of non-HB water molecules which have a faster relaxation time and are {{not a part of the}} surrounding bulk water HB network, was found in the vicinity of the glucose molecules. These clearly point to the HB destructuring effect of saccharide solutes in aqueous solution.
