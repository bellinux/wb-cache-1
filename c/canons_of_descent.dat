500|$|FreeSpace was Volition's first project {{after the}} split from Parallax Software, which also spawned Outrage Entertainment. It {{is not part}} <b>of</b> the <b>canon</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Descent</b> {{computer}} game series, and contained none of its ideas and only small portions of its code. It was only prefixed with Descent to avoid trademark issues with Mijenix Corporation's [...] "FreeSpace", a disk compression utility. Volition also used the term [...] "FreeSpace" [...] in the game to initially describe what became later known as subspace. The game was conceived by Adam Pletcher, with all the features of space simulator games his team had found to be fun. The games [...] and Wing Commander were their primary inspirations, and those influences {{made their way into}} the game's flight model, along with the influence of historical WWII dogfights. Themes from the fiction of Star Wars, , and Ender's Game form a part in shaping the background and story of the FreeSpace world. The chaotic battles between masses of ships commonly found in science-fiction anime became one of the features of FreeSpace.|$|R
50|$|The controversies {{associated}} with the doctrine of kafa'ah were exemplified in {{a chain of events}} which occurred in Hadhramaut, Yemen, in 1905. People of the Ba 'Alawi sada, especially <b>of</b> Hadhrami <b>descent,</b> adhered to a stricter and more rigid system of social stratification based on the kafa'ah <b>of</b> <b>descent.</b> In particular, a Sayyid woman is prohibited from marrying a non-Sayyid man. It must be noted, however, that this extreme position is absent in the <b>canon</b> <b>of</b> orthodox Shāfi'i scholarship, the school to which the Hadramis otherwise adhered. Controversy erupted when a number of marriages between Sayyid women and non-Sayyid men were publicly discovered, which thus became a subject of public condemnation and clamour because of their perceived unsuitability.|$|R

2500|$|From the Eastern Church Northern Africa {{received}} only the decrees of Nicæa (325), which it owed to Cæcilianus of Carthage, {{one of the}} Nicene Fathers.

Their moral authority, however, was great, and from the Latin collections they eventually {{made their way into}} the Greek collections. The best-known are: (a) the <b>Canons</b> <b>of</b> the Council of Carthage (August, 397) which confirmed the [...] "Breviarium" [...] <b>of</b> the <b>canons</b> <b>of</b> Hippo (393), one of the chief sources of African ecclesiastical discipline; (b) the <b>Canons</b> <b>of</b> the Council of Carthage (419), at which were present 217 bishops and among whose decrees were inserted 105 <b>canons</b> <b>of</b> previous councils.|$|R
