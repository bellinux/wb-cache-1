The distension eventually reduces, often under extended (up to six months) refrigeration, leaving a fairly normal appearance. There is no separate <b>cavity</b> <b>treatment</b> of the internal organs. Anatomically embalmed cadavers have a typically uniform grey colouration, due both to the high formaldehyde concentration mixed with the blood and {{to the lack of}} red colouration agents commonly added to standard, non-medical, embalming fluids.

50|$|A {{perforated}} ulcer, is {{a condition}} in which untreated ulcer can burn through the wall of the stomach (or other areas of the gastrointestinal tract), allowing digestive juices and food to leach into the abdominal <b>cavity.</b> <b>Treatment</b> generally requires immediate surgery. The ulcer is known initially as a peptic ulcer before the ulcer burns through the full thickness of the stomach or duodenal wall. A diagnosis is made by taking an erect abdominal/chest X-ray (seeking air under the diaphragm). This is in fact {{one of the very few}} occasions in modern times where surgery is undertaken to treat an ulcer. Many perforated ulcers have been attributed to the bacterium Helicobacter pylori. The incidence of perforated ulcer is steadily declining, though there are still incidents where it occurs. Causes include smoking and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). A perforated ulcer can be grouped into a stercoral perforation which involves a number of different things that causes perforation of the intestine wall.|$|E

Hamster experimental groups included control animals, animals treated with beta-carotene, animals treated with DMBA, and animals treated with DMBA plus beta-carotene. Oral <b>cavity</b> <b>treatment</b> with DMBA induced carcinogenesis in the buccal mucosa, but not in the major salivary glands, where nevertheless, the morphology and expression of both parameters examined changed.

After administration of DMBA plus beta-carotene, sulfatide concentration decreased, as did ASA activity, slightly in the submandibular gland and remarkably so in the sublingual one of female hamsters. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) analysis of lipid patterns, after DMBA treatment, revealed considerable differences, not only in sulfatides, but also in other lipid fractions, as well as between the two glands and two sexes.

40|$|In {{the last}} few years superconducting {{radio-frequency}} (rf) cavities made of high-purity (residual resistivity ratio> 200) niobium achieved accelerating gradients close to the theoretical limits. An obstacle towards achieving reproducibly higher fields is represented by “anomalous” losses causing a sharp degradation of the cavity quality factor when the peak surface magnetic field (B_{p}) is above about 90  mT, in the absence of field emission. This effect, called “Q drop” has been measured in many laboratories with single- and multicell cavities mainly in the gigahertz range. In addition, a low-temperature (100 – 140 [*]°C) “in situ” baking of the cavity was found to be beneficial in reducing the Q drop.
