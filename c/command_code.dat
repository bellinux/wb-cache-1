50|$|Legacy Control System (Legacy) is Lionel's current {{electronic}} control system. It was introduced {{as a successor}} to Lionel's Trainmaster Command Control (TMCC) in December, 2007. Legacy is backward compatible with all TMCC decoder equipped engines. Models with Legacy sound decoders and/or Odyssey II speed control can be operated with earlier TMCC control systems but also have addition features only accessible with Legacy. The <b>command</b> <b>codes</b> for these additional features differ from the DCC <b>command</b> <b>codes.</b> Lionel has not published or licensed access to the Legacy specific <b>command</b> <b>codes.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Any PCI device may {{initiate}} a transaction. [...] First, it must request permission from a PCI bus arbiter on the motherboard. [...] The arbiter grants permission {{to one of}} the requesting devices. [...] The initiator begins the address phase by broadcasting a 32-bit address plus a 4-bit <b>command</b> <b>code,</b> then waits for a target to respond. [...] All other devices examine this address and one of them responds a few cycles later.|$|E
2500|$|If REQ64# is {{asserted}} {{during the}} address phase, the initiator also drives the high 32 {{bits of the}} address {{and a copy of}} the bus command on the high half of the bus. [...] If the address requires 64 bits, a dual address cycle is still required, but the high half of the bus carries the upper half of the address and the final <b>command</b> <b>code</b> during both address phase cycles; this allows a 64-bit target to see the entire address and begin responding earlier.|$|E

50|$|TMCC {{utilizes}} {{the same}} <b>command</b> <b>codes</b> as Digital <b>Command</b> Control (DCC). However, unlike DCC, {{it uses a}} 455 kHz radio transmission to carry the <b>command</b> <b>codes</b> separate from track power. The locomotive decoders are dependent on AC track power (50 or 60 Hz) to synchronize the command receiver. Thus, TMCC can only operate on AC track power. Because TMCC utilizes the DCC <b>command</b> <b>codes,</b> {{it is possible to}} control TMCC with DCC compatible software. MTH Electric Trains included support to interface and control TMCC with its DCS system. Unlike DCC, TMCC-equipped locomotives can run simultaneously with non-TMCC locomotives. Lionel ceased the sale of TMCC command systems in 2010, but continues to introduce models equipped with TMCC decoders. TMCC has been superseded by Lionel's Legacy command system.|$|R

50|$|While {{assisting}} LaForge, Data {{observes that}} LaForge's handedness is incorrect, {{just as they}} had experienced earlier. Data determines that he himself, Picard, and Barclay never left the holodeck, and everyone and everything that appears to be the Enterprise is part of a holodeck program Moriarty created.

50|$|En {{route to}} the nebula, the ship {{suddenly}} changes course away from it, though Lieutenant Tom Paris, at the helm, denies making the change. When it happens a second time, apparently at Paris's instigation, he is relieved of duty until {{the cause of the}} course changes can be determined. As the crew follows a complicated route through the nebula, the ship's engines are suddenly deactivated, apparently by Torres, who like Paris also has no recollection of doing so. The Doctor discovers a common memory pattern between Paris and Torres at the times they acted, indicating that they were possessed by another entity. Kes states that she has felt the presence of such an entity, and Tuvok offers to perform a mind meld to try to help her identify it. However, the two are soon found unconscious, with Kes in a coma. Unsure of the intentions of the entity, Janeway orders the <b>command</b> <b>codes</b> transferred to the Doctor, who cannot be possessed; however, shortly afterwards, they find the Doctor's program deactivated. At the suggestion of Tuvok, Janeway decides to divide all <b>command</b> <b>codes</b> between herself and him, believing the entity can only possess one of them at a time.|$|R
