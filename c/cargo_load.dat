40|$|At a cargo {{company the}} problem is how the process of loading can be made {{efficiently}} in order to include as many items as possible. To make the <b>cargo</b> <b>loading</b> process more swiftly, our research {{is to create an}} application to simulate the process of <b>cargo</b> <b>loading.</b> This simulation is performed on one of the cargo company, namely PT SLI as a case study. This company need a <b>cargo</b> <b>loading</b> simulation application which is at the end can help the company in the day to day <b>cargo</b> <b>loading</b> process. The Process from this application starts from entering the data of container and goods. The next step is the process of simulating <b>cargo</b> <b>loading</b> using Randomized Heuristics algorithm, which will produce a picture layout of goods clearly. This application is made by using 3 kinds of software, there are Microsoft Visual C# 2010, Microsoft Visual C++ and Microsoft SQL Server 2008 as data storage. From the test results of the application, can be concluded that the application can determine the number and the type of container needed in the <b>cargo</b> <b>loading</b> process. The number of container used can be minimized so that it can reduce the shipping cost and also be able to solve the multi-drop destination...|$|R

25|$|The 6-ton 6×6 truck (G512, 514, 547, 569) was {{a family}} of heavy {{tactical}} trucks built for the United States Army during World War II. The basic cargo version was designed to transport a 6-ton (5,400kg) <b>cargo</b> <b>load</b> over all terrain in all weather. The chassis was built by Brockway Motor Company, The Corbitt Company, The Four Wheel Drive Auto Company (FWD), Ward LaFrance Truck Corporation, and White Motor Company.

25|$|Operations on the Hamar Line {{initially}} {{consisted of}} a single daily round trip, increasing to two on weekdays from 1867. The <b>cargo</b> <b>load</b> was asymmetrical, with {{five times as much}} being freighted westwards as eastwards. The railway initially had three locomotives. Also between Trondheim and Støren there was initially only a single daily round trip, increasing to two from 1870. Traffic was above prognosis, soon resulting in the ordering of additional rolling stock. There was {{more than twice as much}} cargo heading southwards as northwards.|$|E
25|$|Internationalized ECE Regulation 48, {{in force}} {{in most of}} the world outside North America, {{currently}} specifies a limited range within which the vertical aim of the headlamps must be maintained under various vehicle load conditions; if the vehicle isn't equipped with an adaptive suspension sufficient to keep the headlamps aimed correctly regardless of load, a headlamp leveling system is required. The regulation stipulates a more stringent version of this anti-glare measure if the vehicle has headlamps with low beam light source(s) that produce more than 2,000 lumens – xenon bulbs and certain high-power halogens, for example. Such vehicles must be equipped with headlamp self-leveling systems that sense the vehicle's degree of squat due to <b>cargo</b> <b>load</b> and road inclination, and automatically adjust the headlamps' vertical aim to keep the beam correctly oriented without any action required by the driver.|$|E

500|$|In November 1939, Roosevelt {{signed the}} Fourth Neutrality Act forbidding American ships from {{entering}} the [...] "war zone", which {{was defined as a}} line drawn from Spain to Iceland. Cargoes intended for Ireland were shipped to Portugal. It was up to the Irish to fetch them from there. This route, known as the Iberian Trade or the Lisbon run. Setting sail from Ireland, the ships would carry agricultural products to the United Kingdom. There they would discharge their <b>cargo,</b> <b>load</b> up on fuel, pick up a British export (often coal), and carry it to Portugal. In Portugal, usually Lisbon, Irish ships loaded the waiting American cargo, such as fertilizer or agricultural machinery.|$|E

40|$|The {{airfreight}} forwarding business {{requires the}} application of stochastic search techniques to support {{the development of the}} industry. In the workflow of airfreight forwarding, the <b>cargo</b> <b>loading</b> process {{is believed to be the}} most probable step to find room for further improvement. How to carry cargoes efficiently needs to be taken into consideration to maximise the profit without any violation of the volume and weight constraints. Among those search techniques, Genetic Algorithms (GA), Tabu Search (TS) and Simulated Annealing (SA) are prevalently used to deal with the optimisation problems. As an illustration of {{the application of}} the three search techniques to the <b>cargo</b> <b>loading</b> problem, it is suggested that GA is the most appropriate method to apply in the optimisation of freight forwarding application. This paper begins with a glance at the <b>cargo</b> <b>loading</b> problem and the airfreight forwarding profit model. Then the working procedures of stochastic search techniques, including GA, TS and SA, are described as they are applied to the <b>cargo</b> <b>loading</b> problem. Subsequently, a qualitative comparison among these three approaches is made to suggest a search technique that is found to be suitable for optimising <b>cargo</b> <b>loading</b> plans in the airfreight forwarding business.

2500|$|In October 1944, after Gen. Tunner took {{command of}} the India-China Division of Air Transport Command, {{increased}} numbers of C-54s, sometimes escorted by Allied fighters based at Myitkyina, greatly increased tonnage levels flown to China from India. [...] The C-54, which could at ten tons carry five times the <b>cargo</b> <b>load</b> of the C-47 and twice that of the C-46, replaced both twin-engined transports as the primary lifter of the operation. The expansion of bases resulted {{in the formation of}} eastbound Routes Easy, Fox, Love, Nan, and Oboe, and of westbound Route King.|$|E
2500|$|The 1948 Citroen 2CV was {{launched}} in France with a manual headlamp leveling system, controlled by the driver with a knob through a mechanical rod linkage. This allowed the driver to adjust the vertical aim of the headlamps {{to compensate for the}} passenger and <b>cargo</b> <b>load</b> in the vehicle. In 1954, Cibié introduced an automatic headlamp leveling system linked to the vehicle's suspension system to keep the headlamps correctly aimed regardless of vehicle load, without driver intervention. The first vehicle to be so equipped was the Panhard Dyna Z. Beginning in the 1970s, Germany and some other European countries began requiring remote-control headlamp leveling systems that permit the driver to lower the lamps' aim by means of a dashboard control lever or knob if the rear of the vehicle is weighted down with passengers or cargo, which would tend to raise the lamps' aim angle and create glare. Such systems typically use stepper motors at the headlamp and a rotary switch on the dash marked [...] "0", [...] "1", [...] "2", [...] "3" [...] for different beam heights, [...] "0" [...] being the [...] "normal" [...] (and highest) position for when the car is lightly loaded.|$|E
