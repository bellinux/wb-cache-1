40|$|Abstract. Fabric non-iron pleat {{plasticity}} is a shaping {{element of}} garment. In {{order to better}} grasp the performance, its quantitative evaluation method was designed in the paper. It was believed that fabric non-iron pleat plasticity was actually the <b>crease</b> <b>retention</b> of fabric, therefore, <b>crease</b> <b>retention</b> ratio was used for characterizing the fabric non-iron pleat plasticity. The results showed that, all of "PTT shape memory fabrics", PET imitation memory fabrics and cotton fabrics had higher <b>crease</b> <b>retention</b> ratios; followed by Nylon fabrics, next was silk fabrics; wool fabrics had the smallest <b>crease</b> <b>retention</b> ratios. The results proved that <b>crease</b> <b>retention</b> ratios {{of different kinds of}} fabrics differ substantially, and the index could basically reflect the non-iron pleat plasticity of different kinds of fabrics...|$|E
40|$|It is a {{novel and}} {{potential}} field that shape memory polymers (SMPs) were used for finishing woven wool fabrics to develop the shape memory textiles due to their shape memory effects (SMEs). In this paper, a novel evaluation system is initially presented to measure the SMEs on the woven wool fabrics. In this system, the conventional properties such as the smoothness appearance, <b>crease</b> <b>retention</b> and wrinkle recovery of different recovery time were measured. Other than, Taking into account of woven wool garments for easy-care, conditions like the hot air and steaming were introduced to characterize the temperature and steaming sensitivities of the SMPs on the woven wool fabrics. The results show that parameters mentioned above can characterize the effect of SMPs on the woven wool fabric.

40|$|With the {{increasing}} awareness of environmental pollution and the extensive 	consideration of mankind health, {{there has been}} an increased demand for natural fibers 	in textile materials recently. As a typical natural fiber, ramie is an increasingly popular 	because of its excellent properties including a high tensile strength, excellent thermal 	conductivity, coolness, ventilation function, moisture absorption, and antibacterial 	function. However, ramie fiber and ramie fabric have some disadvantages such as poor 	elasticity, low wrinkle recovery, low resilience, itchiness, harsh handle, which decreases 	the competitiveness of ramie fabric in the high-grade garment-fabric market. It is 	necessary to use the advanced technologies in the dyeing and finishing for enhancing 	the competitiveness of ramie fabric. This study is aimed to study the natural dyeing and 	functional finishing of ramie fabric. At present, ramie fabrics are mostly dyed with synthetic colorants which can give rise 	to serious environmental pollution and potential harm to mankind health. Thus the 	natural and healthy features of ramie fabric are greatly weakened. In this study, ramie 	fabrics were dyed with the several natural extracts. But heavy metal ions, which lead to 	environmental pollution, are usually used as mordant in natural dyeing. In this study, the 	eco-friendly rare earth was used as mordant in natural dyeing of ramie fabrics. The 	influences of dyeing conditions were studied. The ramie fabrics dyed using rare earth as 	mordant exhibited higher color shade stability against pH variation. Using rare earth as 	mordant in natural dyeing apparently enhanced the color fastness to washing, rubbing 	and light of the ramie fabrics. As compared with Fe 2 + and Cr 6 +, rare earth was more 	efficient, resulting in decrease of mordant concentration in natural dyeing. Thus rare 	earth was effective mordant in the natural dyeing of ramie fabrics. One of the shortcomings of ramie fabric is its lower wrinkle recovery. The typical 	wrinkle resistant finishing via cross-linking usually decreases strength of cellulose 	fabrics. In this study, ramie fabrics were pretreated with liquid ammonia (NH 3) prior to 	wrinkle resistant finishing. Meanwhile, a kind of thermally reactive polyurethane (PU) 	emulsion was used as strength protector. The liquid NH 3 pretreatment was proved todecrease crystallinity of ramie fiber and bring about apparent swelling effect. As a result, 	the accessibility of the ramie fabrics treated by liquid NH 3 was elevated. The liquid NH 3 	pretreatment prior to resin finishing gave rise to better wrinkle resistant effect and less 	strength loss. The thermally reactive PU emulsion was proved to decrease strength loss 	of ramie fabric without influencing wrinkle resistant effect. Using liquid NH 3 	pretreatment and employing reactive PU as protector in the wrinkle resistant finishing 	of ramie fabric can raise strength retention up to 80 %. After 10 laundry cycles, the flat 	appearance and the <b>crease</b> <b>retention</b> of these ramie fabrics were over grade 3. 0. Developing electromagnetic shielding textiles has drawn increasing attention recently 	since electromagnetic pollution is harmful to mankind health. In this study, super critical 	carbon dioxide (scCO 2) fluid technology was used to develop electromagnetic shielding 	ramie fabric. The scCO 2 treatment could remove the impurities of the ramie fibers 	prominently. The scCO 2 fluid could result in the swelling of ramie fiber and thus 	increase the absorbency of ramie fiber to additives. Using scCO 2 fluid, the Palladium 	(II) -hexafluoroacetylacetonate could be impregnated into the ramie fiber under 	appropriate conditions. After thermal decomposition at high temperature, the Palladium 	film formed on ramie fibers. The ramie fabrics bearing Palladium catalyst were plated 	with a cooper film via electroless cooper plating. The cooper coated ramie fabrics 	exhibited good shielding effect. This study presented a new way for developing 	electromagnetic shielding fabric. Nanoparticles have been extensively used for the functional finishing of textiles. But 	the nano finishing of ramie fabrics has less been studied. In this study, the 	multifunctional ramie fabrics coated by TiO 2 nanoparticle were developed. The optimal 	dispersion conditions of TiO 2 nanoparticles in aqueous suspension were studied in 	details. A kind of hydrophilic silica aerogel product was proved to be suitable for 	serving as dispersant for dispersion of TiO 2. Using the TiO 2 suspension prepared in 	optimal conditions, ramie fabrics were coated with TiO 2 via a dip-pad-dry process. In 	order to enhance the finishing durability the ramie fabric were pretreated by citric acid 	prior to nano finishing. The ramie fabric finished with working bath containing 0. 8 g/L 	TiO 2 was proved exhibited excellent UV protection and antibacterial property, and high capability for decomposing formaldehyde. Treating fabric with citric acid before coating 	could improve the washing durability of the resultant TiO 2 loaded ramie fabrics. This study explored several ways for developing healthy and highly functional ramie 	fabrics with high added value. The resultant ramie fabrics exhibited high quality. The 	newly developed dyeing and finishing processes are supposed to be helpful for raising 	the competitiveness of ramie and expanding its application...|$|E

40|$|The {{critical}} zone {{is defined as}} the thin outer veneer of Earth’s terrestrial surface, extending {{from the top of the}} vegetation canopy to the base of weathered bedrock. Very little is known about how the {{critical zone}} is structured and how its structure controls the storage, transport, and chemical evolution of the biosphere’s most important resource- water. In hilly or mountainous landscapes, the critical zone often includes tens of meters of weathered rock beneath the surface and this weathered rock hosts a dynamic hydrologic system that is virtually unexplored. Below weathered bedrock, lies an unmapped three dimensional fresh bedrock surface, Zb, that defines the bottom boundary of the critical zone. This dissertation develops novel theory to predict how this fresh bedrock surface is structured across ridge and valley topography and illustrates, through a field study, how that structure influences the routing of water within the landscape. I report, for the first time, how the structure and hydrologic dynamics of the critical zone vary across an entire hillslope, from channel to topographic divide. Current models for development of the critical zone emphasize top-down processes associated with infiltrating waters and gases, as well as fracturing due to the differential stresses generated by topography. I propose a distinctly different theory, which enables a prediction of the thickness of weathered bedrock across a landscape. I hypothesize that as fresh bedrock, saturated with nearly stagnant fluid, is advected upward into the near-surface through uplift and erosion, channel incision produces a lateral head gradient within the fresh bedrock inducing drainage towards the channel. Drainage of the fresh bedrock causes weathering through drying (i. e. repeated cycles of wetting and drying) and permits the introduction of atmospheric and biotically controlled acids and oxidants such that the boundary between weathered and unweathered bedrock is set by the uppermost elevation of undrained fresh bedrock, Zb. At steady-state the rate at which fresh bedrock crosses the Zb boundary is equal to the channel incision rate (which commonly is less than 1 mm/yr). Hence, this slow drainage of fresh bedrock, progressively allowing weathering to proceed, exerts a “bottom up” control on the advance of the weathering front. The thickness of the weathered zone is calculated as the difference between the predicted topographic surface profile (driven by erosion) and the predicted groundwater profile (driven by drainage of fresh bedrock). For the steady state, soil-mantled case, a coupled analytical solution arises in which both profiles are driven by channel incision. Lithology of the fresh bedrock influences the thickness of the weathered zone through the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the bedrock. Measurements of rate processes and topography, as well as depth to fresh bedrock at the divide can be used to estimate the saturated hydraulic conductivity and porosity of the fresh bedrock. Two non-dimensional numbers corresponding to the mean hillslope gradient and mean groundwater table gradient emerge and their ratio defines the proportion of the hillslope relief that is unweathered. The model predicts a thickening of the weathered zone upslope and consequently, a progressive upslope increase in the residence time of bedrock in the weathered zone. Despite its simplicity, the model makes testable predictions and is consistent with field data from three sites. To investigate how the critical zone is structured across a hillslope and how water is routed throughout the critical zone, I conducted an intensive field investigation on a steep (average 30 degree), actively eroding (0. 2 - 0. 4 mm/yr), 135 m long soil-mantled hillslope within the Northern California Coast Ranges (referred to as Rivendell). The 4000 m 2 hillslope is located within the 17 km 2 Elder Creek watershed, in the Angelo Coast Range Reserve. The hillslope is forested with up to 60 m tall Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and mixed evergreen hardwoods including live oak (Quercus wislizeni), madrone (Arbutus menziesii), and California bay (Umbellularia californica), and is underlain by vertically dipping argillite with sandstone interbeds. The climate is seasonally dry, and characterized by warm, dry summers (May- Sept) and cool, wet winters within which all of the precipitation (1800 mm mean annual precipitation) falls. A network of 12 wells, as deep as 30 m, were drilled across the hillslope into fresh bedrock and an extensive sensor network of over 750 sensors records soil moisture and rock moisture, and meteorological and groundwater conditions across the site. Streamflow at the base of the hillslope is recorded at a United States Geologic Survey station a short distance upstream. To document the spatial and temporal dynamics of rock moisture, I performed periodic neutron probe surveys within deep wells. Drilling revealed a 4 - 25 m thick zone of variably weathered, fractured bedrock underlying, thin (120 days) dry season. The 30 - 130 mm of seasonal soil moisture storage is rapidly depleted within the first sev- eral weeks following the final storm. Approximately 12 weeks into a typically 18 -week dry season, less than 15 mm of soil moisture remains, while up to 120 mm (53 mm average across the hillslope) is stored in the upper 10 m as rock moisture. An annual cycle is repeated each year: drying to a characteristic value and then wetting to a similar rock moisture storage capacity. Because the precipitation exceeds the rock moisture storage capacity even in dry years, the spatial pattern and magnitude of dry season rock moisture are insensitive to the precipitation magnitude and temporal pattern of the immediately preceding wet season, even in a significant drought year (approximately half mean an- nual precipitation). The drop in groundwater level over the last 2 months of the dry season (equivalent to approximately 5 - 50 mm) is also similar in different years. Runoff of just 5 mm per month is sufficient to sustain flow in Elder Creek and support salmonid populations. Rock moisture, a direct consequence of the alteration of bedrock in the near surface, is a virtually unknown and unmapped component of the hydrologic balance. Here, I show that year after year, 30 - 60 % of the incoming precipitation is stored seasonally as rock moisture. Nearly all of that water must be used in transpiration. Hence, rock moisture is a major source of water for vegetation. Because incoming rainfall first restores this moisture content before generating runoff, even in strong drought years, the rock moisture is available, and provides drought resilience. The ecohydrologic function of the critical zone at this site must therefore be divided between 1) near surface rock moisture storage that controls the exchange of gases and solutes and supports dry season transpiration and 2) the fracture dominated seasonally perched groundwater system that routes most precipitation as runoff and controls both peak and low streamflow and aquatic habitat. The dual function of seasonal storage and rapid transmission of water is the defining feature of the rock moisture system. The rock moisture dynamics documented here explain several previously observed processes at Rivendell. The seasonal build up of rock moisture leads to mixing of waters and damping of the stable isotope signature of storm events. Within the dynamic rock moisture zone, seasonal stimulation of subsurface microbial communities (as expressed in gas composition) occurs and cation exchange processes likely drive the solute chemistry of water recharged to the groundwater and drained as runoff. Rock moisture is likely important in a wide range of settings. I propose here the possibility that there may be a co-evolution of vegetation and critical zone structure wherein the water extraction by trees accelerates weathering of the bedrock, which in- <b>creases</b> rock moisture <b>retention.</b> Further field characterization is needed in a range of climates lithologies, and tectonic settings to document the critical zone structure, its rock moisture characteristics, and ecosystem dynamics. Modeling has begun to account for rock moisture dynamics and runoff through fractured bedrock, however, further field investigation will help guide models that predict critical zone development over sufficiently large areas to inform regional hydrologic, climate, and ecologic models...|$|R
