5|$|Landing the {{aircraft}} required {{the extension of}} the retractable landing skid and the deployment of a braking drogue parachute. As pilots could access the plane only from a hatch above the cockpit, the pilot would have to enter the E.381 before it could be attached to the carrier Ar 234C and had no way to escape in <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>emergency,</b> while attached to the carrier.|$|E
5|$|An alert {{was issued}} for the Mexican states of Sonora and Sinaloa and Baja California Sur; army and navy units were on standby in <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>emergency.</b> Roughly 50,000 people {{evacuated}} to storm shelters {{and thousands of}} others sought refuge in public buildings, such as schools and churches. Across La Paz, officials evacuated 3,000 families from hurricane-prone areas. In the towns of Altata and Guamúchil alone, army officials evacuated 5,000 coastal residents.|$|E

5|$|On {{the same}} day Shaw died, 26 other {{participants}} had to be airlifted from the moor. The British Army, which organises Ten Tors, initially stated that the 2007 event would proceed as planned. However, {{in the light of}} severe weather and Shaw's death, it was abandoned halfway through. The rules for the event were modified before the 2007 event to allow teams to carry a mobile telephone for use in <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>emergency.</b>|$|E
5|$|To enable spacewalks, Salyut 6 was {{equipped}} with an inward-opening EVA hatch {{on the side of}} the forward transfer compartment, which could be used as an airlock in a similar way to the system used on Salyut 4. This compartment contained two new semi-rigid spacesuits which allowed much greater flexibility than earlier suits, and could be donned within five minutes in <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>emergency.</b> Finally, the station offered considerable improvements in living conditions over previous outposts, with machinery being soundproofed, the crews being provided with designated 'cots' for sleeping and the equipping of the station with a shower and extensive gymnasium.|$|E
25|$|The diver's bailout {{cylinder}} {{should contain}} adequate gas in <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>emergency</b> at the planned depth. Critical pressure should be calculated {{based on the}} planned profile and must allow change-over, ascent and all planned decompression.|$|E

25|$|To check {{whether the}} bail-out {{cylinder}} has adequate gas (for one diver) in <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>emergency</b> at the planned depth, critical pressure should be calculated {{based on the}} planned profile and should allow change-over, ascent and all planned decompression.|$|E
25|$|Buddy diving is {{the more}} {{generally}} advocated procedural alternative, {{on the principle that}} in <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>emergency,</b> a dive buddy can assist the diver in difficulty, but this is only valid if the buddy is close enough to help, notices the problem, and is competent and willing to assist.|$|E
25|$|The heavy-capacity trains have steel {{wheels and}} are {{operated}} by an on-board train operator. The trains are computer-controlled.

2500|$|This lending {{program would}} be {{advantageous}} to both the administration and parents. It gives the administration more tools to control demand for babysitting. If the administration observes that demand for babysitting is up, it can increase the interest members must pay when they borrow scrip, which will most likely result in less member borrowing. Thus the demand for babysitting will be reduced. Similarly, the administration can decrease the amount of interest paid when demand for babysitting is low. [...] And the system would help parents, because they {{would no longer have}} to save as much scrip because they could simply borrow more in the <b>cases</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>emergency.</b>|$|R
25|$|While other {{emergency}} services {{are provided by}} volunteers and a health aide, the fire and rescue service is provided by Diomede Volunteer Fire Department and First Responders. In such a small community practically anybody will help in <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>emergency.</b> In case of a major health emergency, patients are airlifted to the mainland hospital in Nome, weather permitting. The closest law enforcement are dispatched from the Alaska State Troopers barracks on the mainland in Nome.|$|E
25|$|In <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>emergency</b> in the {{condition}} of a particular road, men of influence and liberality were appointed, or voluntarily acted, as curatores or temporary commissioners to superintend the work of repair. The dignity attached to such a curatorship is attested by a passage of Cicero. Among those who performed this duty in connection with particular roads was Julius Caesar, who became curator (67 BC) of the Via Appia, and spent his own money liberally upon it. Certain persons appear also to have acted alone and taken responsibility for certain roads.|$|E
25|$|Since 1948, the Dutch {{police forces}} have had {{different}} forms of voluntary police officers. In 1948, shortly after WWII, the Reserve Police was established. First, their job was to 'come into service' in <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>emergency.</b> With World War II {{only a few years}} behind the country, this seemed a very logical choice. The Reserve Police, as it was called from 1948 until 1994, consisted of men (and later women) who worked as fully armed and equipped police officers. Similar to their full-time colleagues they were equipped with a pistol, short baton, and handcuffs.|$|E
50|$|An {{opposing}} {{consideration is}} {{of safety and}} calls for visible unnatural colors, such as bright yellow-orange or red. Bright-colored tents can be easily spotted from the air in <b>cases</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>emergency.</b> They are important in places where vehicles may not notice a low-visibility tent and run over its unsuspecting occupiers. Campers wandering away from camp will find their way back more easily if their tent is highly visible. Additionally, lost hikers may find rescue by spotting a visible camp site from afar. Some people have a personal preference for various colors and some manufacturers see the colors {{as part of their}} product branding.|$|R

25|$|The Klapmeier brothers, Alan Lee Klapmeier (born October 6, 1958) and Dale Edward Klapmeier (born July 2, 1961), are American {{aircraft}} designers, aviation businessmen, {{and entrepreneurs}} who together founded the Cirrus Aircraft Corporation in 1984. Under {{the leadership of}} the Klapmeiers, Cirrus was the first aircraft manufacturer to install a whole-plane parachute recovery system as a standard on all its models—designed to lower the airplane (and occupants) safely to the ground in <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>emergency.</b> The device is attributed with saving over 140 lives to date. Cirrus was also the first to use all-composite airframe construction and glass panel cockpits on production aircraft, which many say revolutionized general aviation for light aircraft pilots.|$|E
25|$|Trita Parsi, in {{the book}} Treacherous Alliance: The Secret Dealings of Israel, Iran, and the United States, writes that a senior Israeli {{official}} met with {{a representative of the}} Ayatollah Khomeini in France one month prior to the Israeli attack. The source of the assertion is Ari Ben-Menashe, a former Israeli government employee. At the alleged meeting, the Iranians explained details of their 1980 attack on the site, and agreed to let Israeli planes land at an Iranian airfield in Tabriz in the <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>emergency.</b> While the new Iranian government was officially hostile to Israel, due to both nations having a common enemy (Iraq), and Iranian fears that the Iraqis would create an atomic bomb to use on them, they clandestinely worked with Israel to forestall such a development.|$|E
25|$|The {{fundamental}} {{decision in}} choice of cylinders {{is whether the}} entire gas supply for the dive is to be carried in one set, or is to be divided into more than one set for {{different parts of the}} dive. Diving with a single cylinder is logistically simple, and makes all the gas available for breathing throughout the dive, but can not take advantage of optimising the breathing gas for decompression, or having an independent emergency supply that does not rely on the presence of a dive buddy where and when needed. A single cylinder puts the diver in a position of dependence on the buddy for alternative breathing gas in <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>emergency</b> cutting off the main air supply, unless the option of a free ascent is acceptable.|$|E

25|$|The {{threat of}} a {{sustained}} high altitude campaign by the Luftwaffe did not materialise and only 100 of the Mk VIs were built by Supermarine. Only two units, 124 Squadron and 616 Squadron, were fully equipped with this version, although several other units used them in small numbers as a stop-gap. More often than not, the Spitfire VIs were used at lower altitudes where it was outperformed by conventional Spitfires. At high altitudes {{it was discovered that}} modified Spitfire Vs could perform almost as well as the Mk VI. At low levels, especially, pilots were often forced to fly with the canopy removed because the cockpit would get uncomfortably hot and they were not confident {{it would be possible to}} jettison the canopy in <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>emergency.</b>|$|E
25|$|A further unique {{feature of}} heavy-water {{moderation}} is the greater {{stability of the}} chain reaction. This {{is due to the}} relatively low binding energy of the deuterium nucleus (2.2 MeV), leading to some energetic neutrons and especially gamma rays breaking the deuterium nuclei apart to produce extra neutrons. Both gammas produced directly by fission and by the decay of fission fragments have enough energy, and the half-lives of the fission fragments range from seconds to hours or even years. The slow response of these gamma-generated neutrons delays the response of the reactor and gives the operators extra time in <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>emergency.</b> Since gamma rays travel for meters through water, an increased rate of chain reaction {{in one part of the}} reactor will produce a response from the rest of the reactor, allowing various negative feedbacks to stabilize the reaction.|$|E
25|$|Henry Clay Frick led a {{group of}} speculators, {{including}} Benjamin Ruff, from Pittsburgh to purchase the abandoned reservoir, modify it, and convert it into a private resort lake for their wealthy associates. Many were connected through business and social links to Carnegie Steel. Development included lowering the dam to make its top wide {{enough to hold a}} road, and putting a fish screen in the spillway (the screen also trapped debris). These alterations are thought to have increased the vulnerability of the dam. Moreover, a system of relief pipes and valves, a feature of the original dam, previously sold off for scrap, was not replaced, so the club had no way of lowering the water level in the lake in <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>emergency.</b> The members built cottages and a clubhouse to create the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club, an exclusive and private mountain retreat. Membership grew to include more than 50 wealthy Pittsburgh steel, coal, and railroad industrialists.|$|E
