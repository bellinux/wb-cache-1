Acquired disorders include space occupying lesions due to one of several potential causes ranging from brain tumors to hematomas.Head trauma may cause cerebellar tonsillar ectopia, possibly because of dural strain.

40|$|Mutations in the {{progressive}} ankylosis gene (Ank/ANKH) cause surprisingly different skeletal phenotypes in mice and humans. In mice, recessive loss-of-function mutations cause arthritis, ectopic crystal formation, and joint fusion throughout the body. In humans, some dominant mutations cause chondrocalcinosis, an adult-onset disease {{characterized by the}} deposition of ectopic joint crystals. Other dominant mutations cause <b>craniometaphyseal</b> <b>dysplasia,</b> a childhood disease characterized by sclerosis of the skull and abnormal modeling of the long bones, {{with little or no}} joint pathology. Ank encodes a multiple-pass transmembrane protein that regulates pyrophosphate levels inside and outside tissue culture cells in vitro, but its mechanism of action is not yet clear, and conflicting models have been proposed to explain the effects of the human mutations. Here, we test wild-type and mutant forms of ANK for radiolabeled pyrophosphate-transport activity in frog oocytes. We also reconstruct two human mutations in a bacterial artificial chromosome and test them in transgenic mice for rescue of the Ank null phenotype and for induction of new skeletal phenotypes. Wild-type ANK stimulates saturable transport of pyrophosphate ions across the plasma membrane, with half maximal rates attained at physiological levels of pyrophosphate. Chondrocalcinosis mutations retain apparently wild-type transport activity and can rescue the joint-fusion phenotype of Ank null mice. <b>Craniometaphyseal</b> <b>dysplasia</b> mutations do not transport pyrophosphate and cannot rescue the defects of Ank null mice.

40|$|<b>Craniometaphyseal</b> <b>dysplasia</b> is an {{extremely}} rare, genetic bone-remodeling disorder. Comparable to osteopetrosis, fibrous dysplasia, and other infrequent conditions, <b>craniometaphyseal</b> <b>dysplasia</b> is characterized by progressive diffuse hyperostosis of the neuro- and viscerocranium. Affected patients present with a pathognomonic dysmorphia: macrocephalus, hypertelorism, bulky facial skeleton, and a prominent mandible. Progressive thickening and petrification of the craniofacial bones can continue throughout life, often resulting in neurological symptoms due to obstruction of the cranial nerves in the foramina and therefore immediately requiring neurosurgical interventions to avoid persistent symptoms with severe impairment of function. Treatment is largely infeasible {{given the lack of}} suitable tools to perform a craniotomy through the gross calvarial bone. In this paper, the authors present a complete process chain from the CT-based generation of an individual patient's model displaying his pathology to optimized preoperative planning of the skull's shape with a thickness of about 6 - 7 mm. For concise verification of the surgical plan in an operating room environment, a 3 D real-time navigation prototype system was utilized. To guarantee realization of the surgery in a reasonable time frame, the mechanical tools were preoperatively selected for optimizing the ablation rate in porcine and bovine bone, which were comparable to that in the patient. This process chain was developed in a modular way, so that it could be easily adopted completely or partially for other surgical indications. A 21 -year-old man was treated according to this sophisticated concept. Skull bone more than 50 mm thick in some regions was reduced to physiological thickness.

To exclude differentiation effects due to genetic variability, we generated isogenic hiPSCs, which have identical genetic background except for the ANKH mutation. Isogenic hiPSCs with ANKH mutations formed fewer osteoclasts, resorbed less bone, expressed lower levels of osteoclast marker genes, and showed decreased protein levels of ANKH and vacuolar proton pump v-ATP 6 v 0 d 2.

ANK functionally interacts with clathrin and clathrin associated adaptor protein (AP) complexes as loss of either protein causes ANK dispersion from the TGN to cytoplasmic endosome-like puncta. Consistent with its subcellular localization, loss of ANK results in reduced formation of tubular membrane carriers from the TGN, perinuclear accumulation of early endosomes and impaired transferrin endocytosis. Our data indicate that clathrin/AP-mediated cycling of ANK between the TGN, endosomes, and the cell surface regulates membrane traffic at the TGN/endosomal interface.

40|$|<b>Craniometaphyseal</b> <b>dysplasia</b> (CMD) is a {{monogenic}} human disorder {{characterized by}} thickening of craniofacial bones and flaring metaphyses of long bones. Mutations for autosomal dominant CMD {{have been identified}} in the progressive ankylosis gene ANKH. Previous studies of Ank loss-of-function models, Anknull/null and Ankank/ank mice, suggest that Ank plays a role in the regulation of bone mineralization. However, the mechanism for Ank mutations leading to CMD remains unknown. We generated the first knockin (KI) mouse model for CMD expressing a human mutation (Phe 377 deletion) in ANK. Homozygous Ank knockin mice (AnkKI/KI) replicate many typical features of human CMD including hyperostosis of craniofacial bones, massive jawbones, decreased diameters of cranial foramina, obliteration of nasal sinuses, fusion of middle ear bones, and club-shaped femurs. In addition, AnkKI/KI mice have increased serum alkaline phosphatase and TRACP 5 b, as reported in CMD patients. Biochemical markers of bone formation and bone resorption, N-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen and type I collagen cross-linked C-terminal telopeptide, are significantly increased in AnkKI/KI mice, suggesting increased bone turnover. Interestingly, AnkKI/KI bone marrow–derived macrophage cultures show decreased osteoclastogenesis. Despite the hyperostotic phenotype, bone matrix in AnkKI/KI mice is hypomineralized and less mature, indicating that biomechanical properties of bones may be compromised by the Ank mutation.

40|$|<b>Craniometaphyseal</b> <b>dysplasia</b> (CMD) {{is a rare}} sclerosing {{skeletal}} disorder with progressive hyperostosis of craniofacial bones. CMD can be inherited in an {{autosomal dominant}} (AD) trait or occur after de novo mutations in the pyrophosphate transporter ANKH. Although the autosomal recessive (AR) form of CMD had been mapped to 6 q 21 - 22 the mutation has been elusive. In this study, we performed whole-exome sequencing for one subject with AR CMD and identified a novel missense mutation (c. 716 G>A, p. Arg 239 Gln) in the C-terminus of the gap junction protein alpha- 1 (GJA 1) coding for connexin 43 (Cx 43). We confirmed this mutation in 6 individuals from 3 additional families. The homozygous mutation cosegregated only with affected family members. Connexin 43 is {{a major component of}} gap junctions in osteoblasts, osteocytes, osteoclasts and chondrocytes. Gap junctions are responsible for the diffusion of low molecular weight molecules between cells. Mutations in Cx 43 cause several dominant and recessive disorders involving developmental abnormalities of bone such as dominant and recessive oculodentodigital dysplasia (ODDD; MIM # 164200, 257850) and isolated syndactyly type III (MIM # 186100), the characteristic digital anomaly in ODDD.

40|$|The {{progressive}} ankylosis gene (ank) is a {{transmembrane protein}} that transports intracellular pyrophosphate to the extracellular milieu. Human mutations of ank lead to <b>craniometaphyseal</b> <b>dysplasia,</b> a disease which {{is characterized by}} the overgrowth of craniofacial bones and osteopenia in long bones, suggesting that ANK plays a regulatory role in osteoblast differentiation. To determine the role of ANK in osteoblast differentiation, we suppressed ANK expression in the osteoblastic MC 3 T 3 -E 1 cell line using siRNA and determined the expression of osteoblastic marker genes and the transcription factors osterix and runx 2. In addition, we determined the osteoblastic differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells isolated from the bone marrow of ank/ank mice, which express a truncated, nonfunctional ANK protein, or wild-type littermates. Suppression of ANK expression in MC 3 T 3 -E 1 cells led to a decrease in bone marker gene expression, including alkaline phosphatase, bone sialoprotein, osteocalcin and type I collagen. In addition, osterix gene expression was decreased in ANK expression-suppressed MC 3 T 3 cells, whereas runx 2 expression was increased. Bone marrow stromal cells isolated from ank/ank mice cultured in the presence of ascorbate- 2 -phosphate for up to 35 days showed markedly reduced mineralization compared to the mineralization of bone marrow stromal cells isolated from wild-type littermates. In conclusion, these findings suggest that ANK is a positive regulator of differentiation events towards a mature osteoblastic phenotype...|$|E
40|$|<b>Craniometaphyseal</b> <b>{{dysplasia}}</b> (CMD) {{is a rare}} craniotubular bone dysplasia transmitted in {{autosomal dominant}} or recessive form. This disease is characterized by cranial bone hyperostosis and deformity of the metaphyses of the long bones. Using osteoclast-like cells formed from patient bone marrow cells, we investigated the pathophysiology of CMD in a 3 -yr-old patient. Untreated bone marrow cells from the patient differentiated into osteoclast-like cells in vitro. These cells were shown to have vitronectin beta-receptors using a specific monoclonal antibody, i. e., 23 C 6 (CD 51), which reacts with osteoclasts in human bone biopsy samples. However, the number of these osteoclast-like cells formed from the patient's bone marrow was only 40 % of the normal controls. 1, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin-D 3, bovine 1 - 34 parathyroid hormone, recombinant human interleukin- 1 beta, recombinant human interleukin- 6, or recombinant human macrophage colony-stimulating factor significantly increased, while salmon calcitonin significantly inhibited, the number of osteoclast-like cells. However, these cells could not resorb sperm whale dentin slices and lacked the osteoclast-reactive vacuolar proton pump as evidenced by a monoclonal antibody (E 11). Western blot analysis using a monoclonal antibody to pp 60 c-src (327) revealed that protooncogene c-src expression by the platelets of the CMD patient was comparable to the normal control. These data suggest that: (a) the hyperostosis and the metaphyseal long bone deformity in the present CMD patient might be explained by osteoclast dysfunction due to impaired expression of the osteoclast-reactive vacuolar proton pump; and (b) a protooncogene c-src {{was not associated with}} the pathogenesis of the present CMD patient...|$|E
40|$|<b>Craniometaphyseal</b> <b>dysplasia</b> (CMD) {{is a rare}} genetic {{disorder}} with hyperostosis of craniofacial bones and widened metaphyses in long bones. Patients often suffer from neurological symptoms due to obstruction of cranial foramina. No proven treatment is available and the pathophysiology is largely unknown. A Phe 377 (TTC 1130 – 1132) deletion in exon 9 of the pyrophosphate (PPi) transporter ANK leads to CMD-like features in an AnkKI/KI mouse model. Here, we investigated the effects of CMD-mutant ANK on mineralization and bone mass at a cellular level. AnkKI/KI osteoblast cultures showed decreased mineral deposition. Expression of bone mineralization regulating genes Mmp 13, Ocn, Osx and Phex was reduced in AnkKI/KI osteoblasts, while the Fgf 23 mRNA level was highly elevated in AnkKI/KI calvarial and femoral bones. Since ANK is a known PPi transporter, we examined other regulators of Pi/PPi homeostasis Enpp 1 and Tnap. Significantly increased ENPP 1 activity may compensate for dysfunctional mutant ANK leading to comparable extracellular PPi levels in Ank+/+ osteoblasts. Similar to AnkKI/KI bone marrow-derived macrophage cultures, peripheral blood cultures from CMD patients exhibited reduced osteoclastogenesis. Cell-autonomous effects in AnkKI/KI osteoclasts resulted in disrupted actin ring formation and cell fusion. In addition, AnkKI/KI osteoblasts failed to adequately support osteoclastogenesis. Increased bone mass could partially be rescued by bone marrow transplants supporting our hypothesis that reduced osteoclastogenesis contributes {{at least in part}} to hyperostosis. We conclude that the Phe 377 del mutation in ANK causes impaired osteoblastogenesis and osteoclastogenesis resulting in hypomineralization and a high bone mass phenotype...|$|E

OBJECTIVE: We evaluated several family members of a large consanguineous family with mental retardation, deafness, and ankylosis. We compared their skeletal, metabolic, and serological parameters {{to that of the}} autosomal recessive progressive ankylosis (ank) mouse mutant, caused by a loss-of-function mutation in the murine ortholog Ank. PARTICIPANTS: The studied patients had painful small joint soft-tissue calcifications, progressive spondylarthropathy, osteopenia, mild hypophosphatemia, mixed hearing loss, and mental retardation. RESULTS: After mapping the disease gene to 5 p 15, we identified the novel homozygous ANK missense mutation L 244 S in all patients. Although L 244 is a highly conserved amino acid, the mutated ANK protein was detected at normal levels at the plasma membrane in primary patient fibroblasts. The phenotype was highly congruent with the autosomal recessive progressive ankylosis (ank) mouse mutant. This indicates a loss-of-function effect of the L 244 S mutation despite normal ANK protein expression. Interestingly, our analyses revealed that the primary step of joint degeneration is fibrosis and mineralization of articular soft tissues. Moreover, heterozygous carriers of the L 244 S mutation showed mild osteoarthritis without metabolic alterations, pathological calcifications, or central nervous system involvement. CONCLUSION: Beyond the description of the first human progressive ankylosis phenotype, our results indicate that ANK influences articular soft tissues commonly involved in degenerative joint disorders. Furthermore, this human disorder provides the first direct evidence for a role of ANK in the central nervous system...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The {{type and}} {{severity}} of mandibulofacial abnormalities affects {{the size and shape}} of the pharynx as patients affected by these conditions often have complaints of snoring and respiratory difficulties during sleep. Purpose: The objectives of this study were to evaluate the volume and morphology of nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal, hypopharyngeal and the total airway of patients affected by mandibulofacial abnormalities (unilateral cleft lip and palate [UCLP], and <b>craniometaphyseal</b> <b>dysplasia</b> [CMD]) and to compare them with a matched control group without any mandibulofacial abnormalities. Methods: Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) records of 80 patients (30 UCLP and 10 CMD along with 40 age and gender-matched controls) were collected. Volumetric analysis was performed using image segmentation features in MIMICS 15. 0 (Materialise, Levuen, Belgium) to evaluate the nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal, hypopharyngeal and total airway volumes, as well as the airway morphology. Minimum cross-sectional area was determined using InVivo Dental 5. 3 (Anatomage, San Jose, California). Statistical analysis with SPSS 22. 0 (IBM, Armonk, NY) was done to evaluate inter- and intra-operator reliability by using Cronbach 2 ̆ 7 s alpha and paired t-test. Results: Patients affected by UCLP had statistically significant smaller naso-, hypopharyngeal and total airway volumes, smaller minimum cross-section area, and a more circularly shaped oropharynx when compared with the controls. The CMD group presented the same airway shape as UCLP patients and statistically significant smaller volumes of all pharyngeal regions as well as total airway and minimum cross-section area when compared with the controls. Conclusion: Individuals with UCLP and CMD had a different pharyngeal airway shape and smaller pharyngeal volumes compared to the controls. These individuals have more susceptibility of developing sleep related breathing disorders. This information is pivotal for the clinician in defining the best possible treatment choice for each patient, thus avoiding procedures that could further compromise the airway...|$|E
40|$|<b>Craniometaphyseal</b> <b>dysplasia</b> (CMD) is {{a genetic}} {{disorder}} characterized by hyperostosis of craniofacial bones and flaring metaphyses of long bones. Mice carrying a knock-in mutation (Phe 377 del) in the Ank gene replicate many skeletal characteristics of human CMD including hyperostotic mandibles. A known {{function of the}} transmembrane protein ANK is to transport intracellular pyrophosphate (PPi) into the extracellular environment. PPi inhibits mineralization, while Pi promotes hydroxyapatite formation. A regulated Pi/PPi ratio is the key of physiological mineralization. Although the morphologies of erupted molars and incisors appear to be normal, AnkKI/KI mice have abnormal cervical loop positioning of the lower incisors and excessive cementum deposition of molars and incisors. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the mechanisms leading to abnormal tooth development in AnkKI/KI mice. AnkKI/KI mice and Ank loss-of-function mouse models share similar cementum phenotype suggesting that altered Pi/PPi levels may increase cementum thickness. AnkKI/KI incisors erupt but show decreased eruption rate, decreased proliferation of odontoblast precursors and increased cell apoptosis in the stellate reticulum. However, their capability of continuous elongation is not compromised. Quantification of TRAP-positive cells in the apical end of AnkKI/KI incisors revealed decreased osteoclast numbers and osteoclast surface. Bisphosphonate injections in Ank+/+ mice replicate the AnkKI/KI incisor phenotype, suggesting that abnormal incisor elongation is secondary to reduced bone resorption. In order to understand the contribution of Pi metabolism in the mandible and tooth development of the AnkKI/KI mice, mice were fed with a high or low Pi diet. High Pi diet exacerbated the mandibular hyperostosis whereas a low Pi diet decreased bone mass in AnkKI/KI mice. Both high and low Pi diets increased AnkKI/KI incisor dentin volume but did not change incisor length or cementum deposition. We conclude that increased cementum thickness may be caused by an altered local Pi/PPi ratio and that the incisor phenotype is likely due to hyperostosis of mandibles. Furthermore, altered systemic Pi homeostasis appears to contribute to the mandibular hyperostosis but does not seem to affect incisor length or cementogenesis in the AnkKI/KI mice...|$|E
40|$|<b>Craniometaphyseal</b> <b>dysplasia</b> (CMD) {{is a rare}} {{skeletal}} disorder {{characterized by}} progressive thickening and increased mineral density of craniofacial bones and abnormally developed metaphyses in long bones. Linkage studies mapped the locus for the autosomal dominant form of CMD to an similar to 5 -cM interval on chromosome 5 p, which is defined by recombinations between loci D 5 S 810 and D 5 S 1954. Mutational analysis of positional candidate genes was performed, and we describe herein three different mutations, in five different families and in isolated cases, in ANK, a multipass transmembrane protein involved in the transport of intracellular pyrophosphate into extracellular matrix. the mutations are two in-frame deletions and one in-frame insertion caused by a splicing defect. All mutations cluster within seven amino acids {{in one of the}} six possible cytosolic domains of ANK. These results suggest that the mutated protein has a dominant negative effect on the function of ANK, since reduced levels of pyrophosphate in bone matrix are known to increase mineralization.
