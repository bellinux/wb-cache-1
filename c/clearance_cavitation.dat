40|$|The {{variation}} of tip <b>clearance</b> <b>cavitation</b> number with both tip clearance and flow coefficient {{in a single}} stage axial flow pump has been studied experimentally. It is shown that there exists a critical tip clearance below which surface cavitation at the blade tip occurs first and above which vortex cavitation due to the clearance flow occurs first. In general, the tip <b>clearance</b> <b>cavitation</b> number is a minimum at this critical tip clearance so &at in a properly designed pump, i. e., one with maximum cavitation- free performance, tip clearance and blade surface cavitation number are synonymous...|$|E
40|$|Numerical {{simulation}} {{based on}} the Reynolds Averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) method had been carried out with the commercial code ANSYS CFX. The structured grid and SST k–ω turbulence model had been adopted. The impact of non-condensable gas (NCG) on cavitation performance had been introduced into the Schnerr and Sauer cavitation model. The numerical investigation of cavitating flow of marine propeller E 779 A was carried out with different advance ratios and cavitation numbers to verify the numerical simulation method. Tip clearance effects {{on the performance of}} pumpjet propulsor had been investigated. Results showed that the structure and characteristics of the tip leakage vortex and the efficiency of the propulsor dropped more sharply with the increase of the tip clearance size. Furthermore, the numerical simulation of tip <b>clearance</b> <b>cavitation</b> of pumpjet propulsor had been presented with different rotational speed and tip clearance size. The mechanism of tip <b>clearance</b> <b>cavitation</b> causing a further loss of the efficiency had been studied. The influence of rotational speed and tip clearance size on tip <b>clearance</b> <b>cavitation</b> had been investigated...|$|E
40|$|A {{qualitative}} {{study of the}} effects of cavitation on the performance of an axial flow pump was n 1 ade. Photographic evidence shows that cavitation need not occur first on the blade surface but could occur in the free stream. This phenomenon is ascribed to a flow through the tip <b>clearance</b> space. <b>Cavitation</b> similarity was found to be determined by the cavitation number K, Thoma's σ, or the suction specific speed S for the conditions of these tests...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- The {{occurrence}} of cavitation erosion damage is prevalent in high speed engines and bearing systems operating under high <b>clearance</b> conditions. The <b>cavitation</b> erosion prediction for the hydraulic machines components {{is very important}} in the engineering research. The present paper studies this process in the terms of the volume loss curve of erosion cavitations progress. An analytical model for the prediction of cavitation erosion of ductile materials is proposed. Key-Words:- erosion, cavitation, volume loss curve, Bessel function, ductile material...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} {{cavitation}} experiments in an {{axial flow pump}} are described. It is found that cavitation first occurs in a tip vortex formed by the flow through the tip clearance space of the rotor blade. The effect of tip <b>clearance</b> and several <b>cavitation</b> suppression devices are shown. The schemes tested were rigid end plates attached to the blade ends, strings, and a continuous rotor shroud. Of these, the shroud appears to delay the inception of tip cavitation best for axial flow pumps...|$|R
30|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to investigate the validity of the Reynolds equation in spool valve analysis under cavitation. This study is carried out for a laminar and isothermal flow between a sleeve and spool with grooves. The pressure and lateral force obtained from the Reynolds equation and the Navier-Stokes equation are compared with variations of aspect ratio, cross sectional area, and number of grooves. The cavitation phenomenon is considered by using a cavitation model in the Navier-Stokes equation and the Reynolds cavitation boundary condition in the Reynolds equation. A large difference of more than 20 % is found between the equations for a lateral force of spool valve with many grooves. It was found that the Reynolds equation is not suitable for calculation of a lateral force of the spool valve with multiple-grooves of which the width and depth are even larger than the <b>clearance</b> under <b>cavitation.</b>|$|R
40|$|The wall {{shear stress}} {{induced by the}} leaflet motion during the valve-closing phase has been implicated with {{thrombus}} initiation with prosthetic valves. Detailed flow dynamic analysis {{in the vicinity of}} the leaflets and the housing during the valve-closure phase is of interest in understanding this relationship. A three-dimensional unsteady flow analysis past bileaflet valve prosthesis in the mitral position is presented incorporating a fluid-structure interaction algorithm for leaflet motion during the valve-closing phase. Arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian method is employed for incorporating the leaflet motion. The forces exerted by the fluid on the leaflets are computed and applied to the leaflet equation of motion to predict the leaflet position. Relatively large velocities are computed in the valve clearance region between the valve housing and the leaflet edge with the resulting relatively large wall shear stresses at the leaflet edge during the impact-rebound duration. Negative pressure transients are computed on the surface of the leaflets on the atrial side of the valve, with larger magnitudes at the leaflet edge during the closing and rebound as well. Vortical flow development is observed on the inflow (atrial) side during the valve impact-rebound phase in a location central to the leaflet and away from the <b>clearance</b> region where <b>cavitation</b> bubbles have been visualized in previously reported experimental studies...|$|R
40|$|Marshall Space Flight Center has {{developed}} and demonstrated a measurement device for sensing and resolving the hydrodynamic loads on fluid machinery. The device - a derivative of the six-component {{wind tunnel balance}} - senses the forces and moments on the rotating device through a weakened shaft section instrumented {{with a series of}} strain gauges. This rotating balance was designed to directly measure the steady and unsteady hydrodynamic loads on an inducer, thereby defining the amplitude and frequency content associated with operating in various cavitation modes. The rotating balance was calibrated statically using a dead-weight load system in order to generate the 6 x 12 calibration matrix later used to convert measured voltages to engineering units. Structural modeling suggested that the rotating assembly first bending mode would be significantly reduced with the balance s inclusion. This reduction in structural stiffness was later confirmed experimentally with a hammer-impact test. This effect, coupled with the relatively large damping associated with the rotating balance waterproofing material, limited the device s bandwidth to approximately 50 Hertz Other pre-test validations included sensing the test article rotating assembly built-in imbalance for two configurations and directly measuring the assembly mass and buoyancy while submerged under water. Both tests matched predictions and confirmed the device s sensitivity while stationary and rotating. The rotating balance was then demonstrated in a water test of a full-scale Space Shuttle Main Engine high-pressure liquid oxygen pump inducer. Experimental data was collected a scaled operating conditions at three flow coefficients across a range of cavitation numbers for the single inducer geometry and radial <b>clearance.</b> Two distinct <b>cavitation</b> modes were observed symmetric tip vortex cavitation and alternate-blade cavitation. Although previous experimental tests on the same inducer demonstrated two additional cavitation modes at lower inlet pressures, these conditions proved unreachable with the rotating balance installed due to the intense dynamic environment. The sensed radial load was less influenced by flow coefficient than by cavitation number or cavitation mode although the flow coefficient range was relatively narrow. Transition from symmetric tip vortex to alternate-blade cavitation corresponded to changes in both radial load magnitude and radial load orientation relative to the inducer. Sensed moments indicated that the effective load center moved downstream during this change in cavitation mode. An occurrence of "higher+rdex cavitation" was also detected in both the stationary pressures and the rotating balance data although the frequency of the phenomena was well above the reliable bandwidth of the rotating balance. In summary the experimental tests proved both the concept and device s capability despite the limitations and confirmed that hydrodynamically-induced forces and moments develop in response to the unbalanced pressure field, which is, in turn, a product of the cavitation environment...|$|R
