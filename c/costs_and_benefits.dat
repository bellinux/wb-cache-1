5|$|For the {{purposes}} of analysis, {{it is possible to}} separate efficiency (achieving a given objective at lowest cost) and equity (fairness). Economists generally agree that to regulate emissions efficiently, all polluters need to face the full costs of their actions (that is, the full marginal social costs of their actions). Regulation of emissions that is applied only to one economic sector or region drastically reduces the efficiency of efforts to reduce global emissions. There is, however, no scientific consensus over how to share the <b>costs</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefits</b> of reducing future climate change (mitigation of climate change), or the <b>costs</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefits</b> of adapting to any future climate change (see also economics of global warming).|$|E

5|$|The idea {{of group}} living has been {{discussed}} by many evolutionists for its <b>costs</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefits.</b> Alexander predicted that the cost to large groups {{is that they are}} more likely to suffer from parasitism, but at the same time, they benefit by defense against predation. This theory is not supported in the case of P.exclamans because the parasitism does not always increase with nest size and the predation rate was independent of size.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} be effective, costly signals must fulfill {{specific}} criteria. Firstly, signallers must incur different levels of cost and benefit for signalling behaviour. Secondly, <b>costs</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefits</b> must reflect the signallers’ phenotypic quality. Thirdly, the information provided by a signal should be directed at and accessible to an audience. A receiver can be anyone who stands to benefit from information the signaller is sending, such as potential mates, allies, or competitors. Honesty is guaranteed when only individuals of high quality can pay the (high) costs of signalling. Hence, costly signals {{make it impossible for}} low-quality individuals to fake a signal and fool a receiver.|$|E
5|$|The {{question}} of whether selection of signals works {{at the level of}} the individual organism or gene, or {{at the level of the}} group, has been debated by biologists such as Richard Dawkins, arguing that individuals evolve to signal and to receive signals better, including resisting manipulation. Amotz Zahavi suggested that cheating could be controlled by the handicap principle, where the best horse in a handicap race is the one carrying the largest handicap weight. According to Zahavi's theory, signallers such as male peacocks have 'tails' that are genuinely handicaps, being costly to produce. The system is evolutionarily stable as the large showy tails are honest signals. Biologists have attempted to verify the handicap principle, but with inconsistent results. The mathematical biologist Ronald Fisher analysed the contribution that having two copies of each gene (diploidy) would make to honest signalling, demonstrating that a runaway effect could occur in sexual selection. The evolutionary equilibrium depends sensitively on the balance of <b>costs</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefits.</b>|$|E

5|$|The RAF {{activated}} 20 squadrons between September 1958 and December 1959 {{to operate}} the 120 Thor missiles. They were located at 20 old wartime airfields so that {{the government did not}} have to purchase the land. Each missile was supplied with its own Mark 49 warhead, a variant of the Mark 28 with a thinner and lighter casing. While the Thor missile bases were manned by the RAF, the warheads were supplied under Project E. Each one had a USAF authorisation officer. The missiles used a dual key system, one of which was held by the authorisation officer. Occasionally a missile would be chosen for test firing, for which the missile and its RAF crew would be flown to Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. Twelve test firings were conducted between 6 October 1959 and 12 June 1962. Under the original agreement, the USAF paid the cost of maintenance for the missiles for five years. After a debate over <b>costs</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefits,</b> the Air Council decided on 31 May 1962 that Project Emily should be terminated by the end of 1963. The last Thor squadrons were inactivated on 23 August 1963. The missiles were returned to the United States.|$|E

40|$|Failure to {{consider}} costs {{as well as}} benefits is common in many policy initiatives and analyses, particularly in the environmental arena.

40|$|In {{distributed}} query processing, the semijoin {{is used as}} {{an effective}} operator in reducing relations referenced in the query and thus reducing {{the total amount of}} data transmission. A semijoin is associated with two quantities: <b>cost</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefit.</b> These two quantities of semijoins are the useful ingredients in many heuristic algorithms proposed to generate a semijoin program which is a sequence of semijoins and is executed as a query pre- processing strategy. In this paper, in addition to the <b>cost</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefit,</b> we associate a semijoin with the third quantity: reduction propagation. It measures the propagation of reduction effects of a semijoin to other semijoins. We define this propagation in the context of distributed query processing and by precisely quantifying it, we present a heuristic algorithm to generate a semijoin program. The simulation reaults show that the new algorithm provides a considerable improvement over those based only on the <b>cost</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefit...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In the IR field it {{is clear}} that the value of a system depends on the <b>cost</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefit</b> {{profiles}} of its users. It would seem obvious that different users would prefer different systems. In the TREC- 9 filtering track, systems are evaluated by a utility measure specifying a given <b>cost</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefit.</b> However, in the study of decision systems it is known that, in some cases, one system may be unconditionally better than another. In this paper we employ a decision theoretic approach to find conditions under which an Information Filtering (IF) system is unconditionally superior to another for all users regardless of their <b>cost</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefit</b> profiles. It is well known that if two IF systems have equal precision the system with better recall will be preferred by all users. Similarly, with equal recall, better precision is universally preferred. We confirm these known results and discover an unexpected dominance relation in which a system with lower recall will be universally preferred provided its precision is sufficiently higher.
