50|$|In 1995, the Convention was {{supplemented}} by an Additional Protocolhttp://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/159.htm, ruling that cross-border co-operative arrangements {{can be set}} up as independent bodies {{which may or may not}} have legal personality. If the <b>co-operation</b> <b>body</b> does have legal personality, the latter is defined in the law of the country in which its headquarters are located. As stated in art. 4, the <b>co-operation</b> <b>body</b> cannot be empowered to take measures which apply generally or which might affect the rights and freedoms of individuals. It must be specified whether the body is to be considered a public or private law entity within the respective national legal systems.However, the protocol gives the signatory states the option to extend the powers of such co-operation bodies (art. 5). They can be established as public law entities whose decisions have the same legal force as if they had been taken by the participating authorities themselves. Such bodies can therefore make decisions which are legally binding not only for the participating authorities but also for any individuals affected. In view of the far-reaching implications of such a transnational public authority, Germany, France and Sweden chose to sign the protocol without art. 5. The Additional Protocol significantly extends the provisions made by the Madrid Convention. However, the Convention still does not contain any regulations that override national law. This is why all initiatives have to conform to the national legal systems of the respective countries. Thus, no public law CBC initiative can be based on the CoE Convention and its additional protocols, but must be grounded either in inter-state treaties or at least unilaterally in national law.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the differences {{created by the}} enactment of the new juvenile justice law (Law on the Responsibility of Youth for Criminal Acts and on Justice in Juvenile Matters) as opposed to the general legislation contained in the Penal Law no. 140 / 1961 Coll. and in the Criminal Procedure Act no. 141 / 1961 Coll. Relationship between the new law and the general legislation is that the new piece of legislation prevails over provisions of the general legislation as it is expressly stated in section 1 paragraph 3 of the new. The new juvenile justice law is based on the principle not to punish young delinquents in a repressive way, but to protect them from harmful influences and to create better conditions for their intellectual and moral development and thus {{at the same time to}} prevent their future criminal activity. The new legislative system stands on the principles of the restorative justice theory that focuses more on future reparation of losses suffered. Therefore the attitude of judges, prosecutors and other officials active in criminal cases of juveniles differs from the traditional ways when dealing with criminal offences committed by adults. Everyone involved with proceedings in juvenile cases should undergo special preparation on how to treat juveniles, and a close <b>co-operation</b> of <b>bodies</b> [...] ...|$|R

40|$|The {{point of}} {{departure}} for this congress is the lack of opportunities for <b>co-operation</b> between policy-making <b>bodies</b> and industry. The administrative authorities are not fully informed of new developments and possibilities in technology.

This congress will attempt to provide a first contribution to filling this vacuum. Policy preparing bodies, research institutes, advisory organisations and industry will then have the task of following this up. Present day traffic provides great freedom of movement, 'but at the same time produces: accident victims, environmental damage, and a large energy consumption. We have long been aware of these negative aspects of the traffic system and in particular of the degree of traffic hazards. For decades the administrative authorities and private bodies have been taking measures to combat these hazards. There is at the moment a growing demand for radical action. Perhaps it stems from a feeling of powerlessness, that nothing has any effect, that the correct policy is not being pursued. That is why it is important to see whether any of these feelings are justified...|$|R

40|$|The {{importance}} {{of the role of}} information and education in the control and eradication of vector-borne diseases is well recognized. What is not so well recognized is the need for the fullest exploitation of this role on a national and global scale in the construction of control and eradication programmes.

The author stresses the need for a properly staffed and well-serviced health education division within the framework of the national health organization, as well as the establishment of an epidemiological and statistical branch. Specific attention should be given to the integration within the school syllabus not only of basic health rules, but also of simple preventive medicine, with special relation to control or eradication programmes already in the course of execution...|$|R
40|$|The main {{consideration}} of John McDowell´s „Mind and World“ is {{to dissolve the}} sceptical dualism between thinking and experience. For McDowell, this dualism is also manifested in the dualism of a causal interpretation of nature and rational thinking. The philosophical methodology he uses is „therapeutic“, meaning {{that he is not}} interested in constructive philosophy but in dissolving the underlying beliefs which support dualisms. Whereas this thesis sets out to support McDowells anti-sceptical project, it however offers a critique of his conception because of it´s minimalistic understanding of receptivity. McDowells view on receptivity is focused on pointing towards the presence of something in the surrounding of a thinker. Although this view is necessary to see experience as a force that is able to intervene in a line of argumentative and to understand human receptivity as conceptional embedded into a discursive tradition, it does impliyes a lack of understanding for the bodily experience of the world. By incorporating insights from phenomenologist positions, such as Hermann Schmitz and Martin Seel, the picture of the sensuous world is apprehended so as to make it more realistic, {{in the sense that the}} given cannot be conceived as a „bare presence“. It has it‘s own sensuous structure that is not in any case useful for argumentations by pointing to it. Along this expansion of McDowell´s understanding of experience, it is required to apprehend receptivity not strictly as a fallible force. It must be recognized as a sensitivity for the structures of the given. This raises the question of how experiences as something that is not pointable, can have an effect on thinking. To answer this question, a more concrete understanding of conceptual capacities must be developed, for which I use Adorno´s idea of „identification“. Following this more precise appreciation of conceptional capacities in relation to a comprehensive notion of perception, it is possible to reformulate McDowell´s anti-sceptical insights. Here, I provide an argument for how a relationship between mind and world can be seen as direct while simultaneously positing this directness as an unsurmountable tension. This tension ensues from the observation that the structure of the world is perceived through a passive, non-intentional bodily awareness, yet has to identified as well as something partially demonstrable. Only through this potential reductive identification it is possible to connect experiences with the „space of reason“ (Sellars). McDowells picture of mind and world must therefore be seen as a dynamic <b>co-operation</b> between the <b>body,</b> articulation, and reasoning. Finally, the thesis puts forward a modified way of approaching the dualisms between mind and nature and mind and world. The understanding of receptivity as a sensitivity for the given leads to an understanding of human as a meta-animal sensitivity and to a view on tradition and „Bildung“ that has to inherently take in account the body. From this wider picture of receptivity follows the necessity to develop an understanding of the openness to the world which sees immediacy as a fragile relevance. World-directedness is always threatened by traditions that lack a certain ability of sensibility and by a potential unbalanced <b>co-operation</b> between the <b>body,</b> articulation, and reasoning in every act of cognition...|$|R

60|$|This {{severity}} must be singular, therefore, in {{the case}} of that art, above all others, whose productions are the most vast and the most common; which requires for its practice the <b>co-operation</b> of <b>bodies</b> of men, and for its perfection the perseverance of successive generations. And taking into account also what we have before so often observed of Architecture, her continual influence over the emotions of daily life, and her realism, as opposed to the two sister arts which are in comparison but the picturing of stories and of dreams, we might beforehand expect that we should find her healthy state and action dependent on far more severe laws than theirs; that the license which they extend to the workings of individual mind would be withdrawn by her; and that, in assertion of the relations which she holds with all that is universally important to man, she would set forth, by her own majestic subjection, some likeness of that on which man's social happiness and power depend. We might, therefore, without the light of experience, conclude, that Architecture never could flourish except when it was subjected to a national law as strict and as minutely authoritative as the laws which regulate religion, policy, and social relations; nay, even more authoritative than these, because both capable of more enforcement, as over more passive matter; and needing more enforcement, as the purest type not of one law nor of another, but of the common authority of all. But in this matter experience speaks more loudly than reason. If there be any one condition which, in watching the progress of architecture, we see distinct and general; if, amidst the counter evidence of success attending opposite accidents of character and circumstance, any one conclusion may be constantly and indisputably drawn, it is this; that the architecture of a nation is great only when it is as universal and as established as its language; and when provincial differences of style are nothing more than so many dialects. Other necessities are matters of doubt: nations have been alike successful in their architecture in times of poverty and of wealth; in times of war and of peace; in times of barbarism and of refinement; under governments the most liberal or the most arbitrary; but this one condition has been constant, this one requirement clear in all places and at all times, that the work shall be that of a school, that no individual caprice shall dispense with, or materially vary, accepted types and customary decorations; and that from the cottage to the palace, and from the chapel to the basilica, and from the garden fence to the fortress wall, every member and feature of the architecture of the nation shall be as commonly current, as frankly accepted, as its language or its coin.|$|R
40|$|I {{chose the}} topic of my diploma thesis ?Role and Compass and Potential of Non-government Non-profit Organisations when Solving Crisis Situations and System of Co-operation between them and Bodies of Crisis Management? because I believe that {{non-profit}} organisations {{play a key role}} at providing help to people in distress. I pay high attention to the non-profit organisations which, within their compass, try to help people in distress. They attempt to mitigate the consequences of emergencies or crisis situations, which can affect any human being at any time. It was only when I started studying at the University of South Bohemia and when working for the police that I found out that the non-profit organisations which operate in the Czech Republic depend mainly on the grant policy, sponsorship and human approach {{of the people who are}} employed in these organisations or support them in whatever way. Having chosen {{the topic of}} my diploma thesis, I have tried to summarize and submit as much information for the readers of this paper to absorb as many data as possible on the non-profit organisations which work within the South-Bohemian region and are available when preparing and solving emergencies and crisis situations. I have made an attempt to describe their role, compass and employment at emergencies. The other objective of my thesis is to describe their communication within the Emergency Services and with the bodies of Crisis Management. The objective of my diploma thesis is to analyse the activities of non-government non-profit organisations when dealing with crisis situations and emergencies. Based on qualitative research, this goal was met. Nowadays, in the time of economic crises both in the Czech Republic and in the world, I must state that to secure funding, material and human resources, which would enable their workers to perform the activities given by their mission, represents for the non-profit organisations a superhuman task.

40|$|The {{present study}} is an attempt in applied {{research}} to examine {{the growth of the}} public sector in a developing economy. All the analysis, from the collection of the original data and its treatment, has been directed towards the determination of the factors which contributed more significantly to that growth, and to establishing its relations with the historical (economic, political and social) events in a particular country: Portugal. In the end, an interpretative scheme had to be evolved to explain the phenomenon observed. However, apart from the relations which emerged, and the value of the explanations advanced, there is a service for which we believe we can lay claim; that of having taken the pains of collecting; and grouping the thousands of items of the Portuguese government accounts {{since the beginning of the}} century in categories suitable for the analysis of the economist; and this did not represent the minor effort in our task. Such a work had not been undertaken before, and no similar study, even of a smaller coverage, or for a shorter period of time, existed. We hope it will contribute to throw some light into the process of the transformation of the Portuguese economy during the last six decades. In presenting the data for the period aftex- 1930, it has "been possible to find in an almost adequate form, a breakdown of the expenditures of the central government into economic aim functional categories, in "Estatisticas Financeiras" - a publication of the National Institute of Statistics.

In addition to that, many data on expenditures which, by every meaningful criterion or definition of the public sector belonged to that sector, but due to administrative or some other reason had been excluded from the formal structure of the "unitary" budget and remained scattered through a series of publications and reports (or not published at all), had to be collected separately or obtained from the archives and through kind <b>co-operation</b> of the <b>bodies</b> concerned.
