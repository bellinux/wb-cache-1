50|$|Numerous {{studies have}} been {{dedicated}} towards the development of effective methods to enable cardiac tissue regeneration in patients after ischemic heart disease. An emerging approach to answer the problems related to ischemic tissue repair is {{through the use of}} stem cell-based therapy. However, the actual mechanism due to which this stem cell-based therapy has generative effects on cardiac function is still under investigation. Even though numerous methods have been studied for <b>cell</b> <b>administration,</b> the efficiency of the number of cells retained in the beating heart after implantation is still very low. A promising approach to overcome this problem is through the use of cell microencapsulation therapy which has shown to enable a higher cell retention as compared to the injection of free stem cells into the heart.|$|E

In the present study, absorption of polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) congeners was measured following air <b>cell</b> <b>administration</b> of a penta-BDE mixture (11. 1 lg DE- 71 g- 1 egg) or an octa-brominated diphenyl ether mixture (octa BDE; DE- 79; 15. 4 lg DE- 79 g- 1 egg). Uptake of PBDE congeners was measured at 24 h post-injection, midway through incubation, and at pipping in chicken, mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), and American kestrel egg contents, {{and at the end}} of incubation in black-crowned night-heron (Nycticorax nycticorax) egg contents. Absorption of penta-BDE and octa-BDE from the air cell into egg contents occurred throughout incubation; at pipping, up to 29. 6 % of penta-BDE was absorbed, but only 1. 40 – 6. 48 % of octa-BDE was absorbed. Higher brominated congeners appeared to be absorbed more slowly than lower brominated congeners, and uptake rate was inversely proportional to the log Kow of predominant BDE congeners. Six congeners or co-eluting pairs of congeners were detected in penta-BDE-treated eggs that were not found in the dosing solution suggesting debromination in the developing embryo, extraembryonic membranes, and possibly even in the air cell membrane.

30|$|The {{findings}} of the [18 F]DPA- 714 PET imaging showing that the inflammatory level in or around the brain damage was reduced in the BMSC group have two possible interpretations. Firstly, the PET findings could be {{the effect of the}} reduction in infarct size. Secondly, the decreased inflammatory level brought about the reduction in infarct size. We can consider both of these to be correct. Thus, we suggest that the immunomodulatory effect seen after <b>cell</b> <b>administration</b> could break a vicious cycle between ischemic damage and the inflammatory response. Evidence of this is the correlation between infarction volume and lymphoid organ size (Fig.  3 d, e). If any therapeutic effect apart from immunomodulation, for example, an antioxidant effect, could affect the brain damage, the regression line would be identical to the one in the vehicle/sham groups. However, the line was shifted upward here. We, therefore, believe that the regression line in the vehicle/sham group is an expression of the previously mentioned vicious cycle, with the shift of the line evidence of its disruption or immunomodulation. Thus, our present results suggest that a strong systemic immunomodulatory effect arises following <b>cell</b> <b>administration,</b> possibly resulting in a local immunomodulatory effect in the brain and concomitant rescue of secondary ischemic damage.|$|E

Although systemic MSC administration has proven efficacious and has a large advantage as our above previous studies [11, 12], possible risks, including pulmonary embolism, pose a serious issue [13, 14]. It is therefore important to provide an alternative low-risk method that avoids MSCs becoming trapped within healthy organs. Despite this, cell regulation following local <b>cell</b> <b>administration</b> is not well-documented with respect to peri-implant tissue regeneration.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Previous {{data suggest}} that bone marrow-derived stem cells (BM-SCs) {{decrease}} the infarct size and beneficially affect the postinfarction remodeling. METHODS: The Myocardial Stem <b>Cell</b> <b>Administration</b> After Acute Myocardial Infarction Study is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, single-blind clinical trial designed to compare the early and late intracoronary or combined (percutaneous intramyocardial and intracoronary) administration of BM-SCs to patients after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with reopened infarct-related artery. The primary end points are the changes in resting myocardial perfusion defect size and left ventricular ejection fraction (gated single photon emission computed tomography [SPECT] scintigraphy) 3 months after BM-SCs therapy. The secondary end points relate to evaluation of (1) the safety and feasibility of the application modes, (2) the changes in left ventricular wall motion score index (transthoracic echocardiography), (3) myocardial voltage and segmental wall motion (NOGA mapping), (4) left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes (contrast ventriculography), and (5) the clinical symptoms (Canadian Cardiovascular Society [CCS] anina score and New York Heart Association [NYHA] functional class) at follow-up. Three hundred sixty patients are randomly assigned into 1 of 4 groups: group A, early treatment (21 - 42 days after AMI) with intracoronary injection; group B, early treatment with combined application; group C, late treatment (3 months after AMI) with intracoronary delivery; and group D, late treatment with combined administration of BM-SCs. Besides the BM-SCs therapy, the standardized treatment of AMI is applied in all patients. CONCLUSIONS: The Myocardial Stem <b>Cell</b> <b>Administration</b> After Acute Myocardial Infarction Trial is the first randomized trial to investigate {{the effects of the}} combined (intramyocardial and intracoronary) and the intracoronary mode of delivery of BM-SCs therapy in the early and late periods after AMI...|$|E
