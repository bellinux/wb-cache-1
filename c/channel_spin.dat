40|$|We {{study the}} Fermi liquid {{properties}} of the cold atomic dipolar Fermi gases with the explicit dipolar anisotropy using perturbative approaches. Due to the explicit dipolar anisotropy, Fermi surfaces exhibit distortions of the $d_{r^ 2 - 3 z^ 2 }$-type in three dimensions and of the $d_{x^ 2 -y^ 2 }$-type in two dimensions. The fermion self-energy, effective mass, and Fermi velocity develop the same anisotropy at the Hartree-Fock level proportional to the interaction strength. The Landau interaction parameters in the isotropic Fermi liquids become the tri-diagonal Landau interaction matrices in the dipolar Fermi liquids which renormalize thermodynamic susceptibilities. With large dipolar interaction strength, the Fermi surface collapses along directions perpendicular to the dipole orientation.
