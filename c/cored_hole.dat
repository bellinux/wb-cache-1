The shear strength of Del Rio Clay and Eagle Ford Shale is not affected by drying-duration, but is related to water content; the shear strength of Taylor Marl and Navarro Shale decreases considerably as drying-duration increases. The elastic modulus of all four clay shales drops significantly when clay shales are dried and then wetted.

40|$|A {{theory is}} {{presented}} for <b>core</b> <b>hole</b> polarization probed by spin polarization and magnetic dichroism in resonant photoemission. The resonant photoemission is {{considered as a}} two-step process, starting with an excitation from a core level to the valence shell, after which the <b>core</b> <b>hole</b> decays into two shallower <b>core</b> <b>holes</b> while an electron is emitted. The two <b>core</b> <b>holes</b> form well defined states which can be selected by {{the energy of the}} emitted electron. The non-spherical <b>core</b> <b>hole</b> and the selected final state cause a specific angle and spin distribution of the emitted electron. The experiment is characterized by the magnetic and nonmagnetic moments being measured, the polarization and direction of the light and the spin and angular distribution of the emitted electron. The intensity is a sum over ground state expectation values of tensor operators multiplied by the probability of creating a polarized <b>core</b> <b>hole</b> using polarized light, multiplied by the probability for decay of such a <b>core</b> <b>hole</b> into the final state. Using diagrammatic methods we derive general expressions for the angle and spin dependent intensity in various regimes of Coulomb and spin-orbit interaction, LS, LSJ and jjJ coupling. This core polarization analysis generalizes the use of sum rules in x-ray absorption spectroscopy where the integrated peak intensities give ground state expectation values of operators such as the spin and orbital moments. The photoemission decay makes it possible to measure new linear combinations of operators. The general formula for second-order processes shows that in the presence of core-valence interactions the two-step model may break down due to interference terms between intermediate states separated by more than their lifetime width. We present tables for the resonant p <b>core</b> <b>hole</b> decays in 3 d transition metals. The 2 p 3 / 23 p 3 p decay in ferromagnetic nickel is calculated using Hartree-Fock values for the radial matrix elements and phase factors.

In KLV Auger spectra a <b>core</b> <b>hole</b> is present in both initial and final states. Thus, there will be almost no dynamical effect, but the static effect must be accounted for in any quantitative calculation. They present a full effective one-particle calculation for the KL 1 V and KL 2, 3 V spectra of sodium, {{that for the first time}} explain the `mystery' structure seen in experiment, by attributing this effect to the presence of a <b>core</b> <b>hole.</b> The agreement experiment is gratifying although some discrepancy remains. For the main band of soft X-ray emission spectra the <b>core</b> <b>hole</b> is present in the initial state but not in the final state, yet the experimental spectra do not show the strong effect found in KLV. This is explained in terms of the Final State Rule, according to which rather accurate spectra can be obtained from a one-particle calculation provided final-state wave functions are used in the transition matrix elements. The dynamical switching of the <b>core</b> <b>hole</b> potential causes a singular behavior of the X-ray edge, which according to the Final State Rule can be accounted for by multiplicative power-law factors.

It had been thought that a relatively simple geological model explained the underlying Cenozoic sequence with salt-rich clays of the Narrabri Formation overlying sands and gravel aquifers comprising the Gunnedah Formation. Extensive groundwater modelling based upon this simple conceptualisation has been used in management plans proposed by the mining and agricultural industries. A 31. 5 m core has been recovered using minimally disturbed triple-tube coring methods at Cattle Lane (Latitude – 31. 52 ° S, Longitude 150. 47 ° E) to resolve uncertainty concerning the aquitard status of the upper layer. Recovered core has been examined and tested to determine grainsize, cation-exchange capacity, X-ray diffraction, X-ray fluorescence and microscopic examination of granular components. These measurements complement surface and borehole geophysical techniques, hydrogeological data and hydrochemical analysis of water samples recovered from a series of specially constructed piezometers adjacent to the <b>cored</b> <b>hole.</b> The sequence overlies a Late Cretaceous channel cut into Permian bedrock at 91 m depth with sands and clays below 31. 5 m considered to represent various alluvial fill events mostly occurring since the Early Pliocene. Erosion of Late Eocene alkali basalts on the Liverpool Ranges, with the formation of smectite clays, pedogenic carbonates and with the addition of quartz from both eolian sources and locally derived from adjacent Triassic sandstone hills, provides the great majority of the sediment recovered from the cores. Late Pleistocene (114 ka) to Holocene ages were determined for the core from three optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) measurements on fine sands (13, 23 and 29 m BG). Detailed examination has failed to detect any evidence of a boundary between Narrabri and Gunnedah formations revealing rather a gradual change in dominance of clays and silts over sands and gravels embedded in a clay-rich matrix.
