40|$|Of all the {{strategies}} to reduce carbon emissions, carbon dioxide (CO₂) geological sequestration is an immediately available option for removing {{large amounts of}} the gas from the atmosphere. However, {{our understanding of the}} transition behavior between Forchheimer and Darcy flow through porous media during CO₂ injection is currently very limited. In addition, the kinetic mass transfer of SO₂ and CO₂ from <b>CO₂</b> <b>stream</b> to the saline and the fully coupling between the changes of porosity and permeability and multiphase flow are two significant dimensions to investigate the brine acidification and the induced porosity and permeability changes due to SO₂ co-injection with CO₂. Therefore, this dissertation develops a multiphase flow, contaminant transport and geochemical model which includes the kinetic mass transfer of SO₂ into deep saline aquifers and obtains the critical Forchheimer number for both water and CO₂ by using the experimental data in the literature. The critical Forchheimer numbers and the multiphase flow model are first applied to analyze the application problem involving the injection of CO₂ into deep saline aquifers. The results show that the Forchheimer effect would result in higher displacement efficiency with a magnitude of more than 50 % in the Forchheimer regime than that for Darcy flow, which could increase the storage capacity for the same injection rate and volume of a site. Another merit for the incorporation of Forchheimer effect is that more CO₂ would be accumulated in {{the lower half of the}} domain and lower pressure would be imposed on the lower boundary of the cap-rock. However, as a price for the advantages mentioned above, the injection pressure required in Forchheimer flow would be higher than that for Darcy flow. The fluid flow and contaminant transport and geochemical model is then applied to analyze the brine acidification and induced porosity and permeability changes due to SO₂ co-injection. The results show that the co-injection of SO₂ with CO₂ would lead to a substantially acid zone near the injecting well and it is important to include the kinetic dissolution of SO₂ from the <b>CO₂</b> <b>stream</b> to the water phase into the simulation models, otherwise considerable errors would be introduced for the equilibrium assumption. This study provides a useful tool for future analysis and comprehension of multiphase Darcy-Forchheimer flow and brine acidification of CO₂ injection into deep saline aquifers. Results from this dissertation have practical use for scientists and engineers concerned with the description of flow behavior, and transport and fate of SO₂ during SO₂ co-injection with CO₂ in deep saline aquifers.

40|$|In {{the wake}} of {{concerns}} about the long-term integrity and containment of sub-surface CO₂ sequestration reservoirs, many efforts {{have been made to}} improve the monitoring, verification, and accounting methods for geo-sequestered CO₂. This Ph. D. project has been part of a larger U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) sponsored research project to demonstrate the feasibility of a system designed to tag CO₂ with radiocarbon at a concentration of one part per trillion, which is the ambient concentration of ¹⁴C in the modern atmosphere. Because carbon found at depth is naturally free of ¹⁴C, this tag would easily differentiate pre-existing carbon in the underground from anthropogenic, injected carbon and provide an excellent handle for monitoring its whereabouts in the subsurface. It also creates an excellent handle for adding up anthropogenic carbon inventories. Future inventories in effect count ¹⁴C atoms. Accordingly, we developed a ¹⁴C tagging system suitable for use at the part-per-trillion level. This tagging system uses small containers of tracer fluid of ¹⁴C enriched CO₂. The content of these containers is transferred into a <b>CO₂</b> <b>stream</b> readied for underground injection in a controlled manner so as to tag it at the part-per-trillion level. These containers because of their shape are referred to in this document as tracer loops. The demonstration of the tracer injection involved three steps. First, a tracer loop filling station was designed and constructed featuring a novel membrane based gas exchanger, which degassed the fluid in the first step and then equilibrated the fluid with CO₂ at fixed pressure and fixed temperature. It was demonstrated that this approach could achieve uniform solutions and prevent the formation of bubbles and degassing downstream. The difference between measured and expected results of the CO₂ content in the tracer loop was below 1 %. Second, a high-pressure flow loop was built for injecting, mixing, and sampling of the fast flowing stream of pressurized CO₂ tagged with our tracer. The laboratory scale evaluation demonstrated the accuracy and effectiveness of our tracer loops and injection system. The ¹⁴C/¹²C ratio we achieved in the high pressure flow loop was at the part per trillion level, and deviation between the experimental result and theoretical expectation was 6. 1 %. Third, a field test in Iceland successfully demonstrated a similar performance whereby ¹⁴CO₂ tracer could be injected in a controlled manner into a <b>CO₂</b> <b>stream</b> at the part per trillion level over extended periods of time. The deviation between the experimental result and theoretical expectation was 7. 1 %. In addition the project considered a laser-based ¹⁴C detection system. However, the laser-based ¹⁴C detection system was shown to possess inadequate sensitivity for detecting ambient levels of ¹⁴CO₂. Alternative methods for detecting ¹⁴C, such as saturated cavity absorption ring down spectroscopy and scintillation counting may still be suitable. In summary, the project has defined the foundation of carbon- 14 tagging for the monitoring, verification, and accounting of geological carbon sequestration...|$|E

While the flue gas in oxy-fuel combustion is concentrated in CO₂, it contains impurities such as SO₂. The elimination of SO₂ can provide a clean <b>CO₂</b> <b>stream</b> ready for storage. This paper is to understand the absorption of SO₂ in scrubbing relevant to those used in oxy-fuel technology. Steady state experiments were conducted in a continuous well stirred reactor to understand the absorption rate of SO₂/CO₂ into a total concentration of 0. 28 M of mixtures of NaHSO₃ and NaHCO₃ simulating liquids formed by scrubbers using NaOH as the reagent at solution pH values from 4 to 7 with the exiting gas concentrations of SO₂ from 19 ppm to 1500 ppm and a constant CO₂ concentration of 70 %. Online measurement included gas phase SO₂ and liquid pH, and offline measurement included CO₂ (aq), HCO₃⁻, S (IV), SO₃²⁻ and S (VI) after each experiment. Three aspects investigated were the impacts of pH on the solution chemistry, the significance of solution pH and the concentration of gas phase SO₂ on the absorption rate of SO₂. The total sulphur concentration in liquid {{was found to be}} related to the effectiveness of Na⁺. The effective ratio of Na⁺ can be defined as the total sulphur to Na⁺ ratio and this effectiveness ratio of Na⁺ is pH dependent. At pH 5. 5. The concentration of HCO₃⁻ increases dramatically above pH 6 and below this pH, the concentration of HCO₃⁻ is negligible. The absorption rate of SO₂ was found to increase with pH with some increase with the concentration of SO₂. The operational pH window for scrubbing may be defined by an upper limit pH where the absorption rate of SO₂ starts to decreases from the maximum absorption rate of SO₂ and the lower limit pH where the absorption rate of SO₂ reduces to half of the maximum absorption rate of SO₂. Both the upper limit and the lower limit decrease initially and stay stable with the concentration of SO₂. This decrease is caused by the reversible reaction of the hydrolysis of SO₂ and confirmed by equilibrium experiments of SO₂ and sodium solutions. Operation within region 2 (pH 5 - 6) is recommended, depending on the scrubber design. The operation exit pH of the produced liquid can be varied within the region. The absorption rates of SO₂ obtained in the steady state experiments were predicted by a model based on the instantaneous reaction assumption. This model generally overestimates the absorption rates of SO₂ at pH values below 6 indicating a kinetic limitation of SO₂ and water reaction at low pH values. The analysis on the controlling regions indicates that the gas side mass transfer resistance decreases with the concentration of SO₂. Liquid side resistance becomes more important at a lower pH and a higher concentration of SO₂...|$|E
40|$|Oxy-fuel {{combustion}} is {{a promising}} CCS technology {{which is being}} demonstrated prior to commercialization. While the flue gas in oxy-fuel combustion is concentrated in CO₂, it contains impurities such as SO₂. The elimination of SO₂ can provide a clean <b>CO₂</b> <b>stream</b> ready for storage. SO₂ is commonly washed by sodium based spray towers with high efficiency but CO₂ impacts are significant. A theoretical model was developed based on the two-film mass transfer model, and considering both the SO₂ and CO₂ reactions with sodium solutions. This model was firstly used to simulate the dynamic experimental results reported in our previous paper to confirm its applicability. With this model, simulations then were carried out on the absorption rate of SO₂ into droplets with three droplet sizes: 100 µm, 500 µm and 1000 µm, one sodium concentration of 0. 08 M (back calculated from liquid analysis), a range of pH from 4 to 12. 5 {{and a range of}} SO₂ concentrations from 19 ppm to 1500 ppm. Simulations focus on the impacts of droplet position, gas phase CO₂ and droplet size on the absorption rate of SO₂. These impacts are closely related with pH values. Taking a typical pH of 7 for example, the absorption rates of SO₂ for droplets close to nozzles which move relative to the gas are significantly higher than these below nozzles which are at the terminal velocities, and the differences between two positions are larger for higher concentrations of SO₂ with the concentrations range from 200 ppm to 1500 ppm. CO₂ has a negative impact on the absorption rate of SO₂ through reducing the gas phase mass transfer coefficient of SO₂ in the gas phase controlled region and also through generating more acidic conditions at the liquid phase interface. Reducing the droplet size from 500 µm to 100 µm has a more significant improvement on the absorption rate of SO₂ than from 1000 µm to 500 µm. Result: have implications in the controlling region and the operational liquid pH region. The controlling region is related to the droplet position. The droplets close to nozzles are located in the mixed controlled region or the gas film controlled region; and the droplets below nozzles can be located in three regions depending on the concentration of SO₂ and pH. A lower concentration of SO₂ and a higher pH are favourable for the absorption rates of SO₂ to be located in the gas phase controlled region. The operational pH of the exit liquid may be established based on two criteria: a reasonable absorption rate of SO₂ and a sodium reagent loss as NaHCO₃. The optimal operational region is then in the region 2 where the absorption rate of SO₂ is still high and reagent use is minimized. The region 2 can be further divided into four sub regions. In the region 2 - 1 and the region 2 - 2, the absorption rate is moderate, but there is too much Na⁺ wasted for CO₂ capture. In the region 2 - 3, there is a moderate amount of Na⁺ wasted for CO₂ capture. In the region 2 - 4, Na⁺ wasted for CO₂ capture is minimized, but the effective ratio of Na⁺ is still not the maximum. The necessary operational pH region graph can be used to guide the operation of a spray tower...|$|E

To examine temporal variation and drivers, we measured stream and hyporheic pCO₂ at high temporal resolution over 11 months in a 95. 9 -ha forested headwater catchment in the Western Cascades of Central Oregon, USA. Stream and hyporheic pCO₂ showed high seasonal and event-scale variability with distinct stream and hyporheic dynamics during storm discharge events. Hyporheic exchange flow exported 37. 5 kg-C yr⁻¹ per watershed hectare (confidence interval 4. 0 - 122. 3 kg-C ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹) from the riparian zone to the <b>stream.</b> Summing <b>CO₂</b> evasion and downstream advection suggests that one third of inorganic carbon export originated in the hyporheic zone. Hyporheic exchange flow had greatest influence over stream pCO₂ during low and high baseflow, while CO₂ evasion had greatest influence during storm discharge events. These {{findings suggest that the}} hyporheic zone actively participates in carbon cycling in this headwater stream and continuously replenishes <b>stream</b> <b>CO₂.</b> To examine spatial variation and drivers, we measured <b>stream</b> <b>CO₂</b> at monthly intervals from July 2013 through July 2014 at 38 locations across the 6400 -ha HJ Andrews Experimental Forest. Stream pCO₂ was consistently supersaturated with respect to atmospheric concentrations. Stream pCO₂ ranged from atmospheric (400 μatm) to 20 times atmospheric concentrations (8150 μatm) and exhibited strong spatial and temporal variability. The distribution of pCO₂ over the study period was different in small and large streams within the drainage network. At the watershed scale, pCO₂ decreased with distance downstream. At the reach scale, we did not detect clear patterns in the downstream direction. However, individual transects displayed persistent profile shape, with consistent high and low pCO₂ locations. We found negative relationships between stream pCO₂ and stream discharge, mean velocity and the carbon dioxide gas transfer velocity. Stream pCO₂ exhibited changes over short distances, with large changes in pCO₂ over less than 50 m. Longitudinal variability indicates spatial variability of in-stream controls on pCO₂ at this scale. Stream pCO₂ shows generally higher concentrations during the summer and lower concentrations in the winter, with considerable intrannual variability...|$|R
40|$|Lateral {{export of}} carbon (C) from soils to running waters is a {{persistent}} pathway for C with terrestrial origin. This "aquatic conduit" might be {{especially important in}} boreal regions where {{a significant part of}} the global C stock is stored in the soil. Even though the awareness of the fate of terrestrially derived C is increasing in regional and global C budgets, the scarcity of data on the contribution of streams is widely acknowledged. In particular, the evasion (degassing) of gaseous C (i. e. CO₂ and CH₄) from the water surface of streams requires better characterization. This thesis aims to quantify the evasion of <b>CO₂</b> from boreal <b>streams</b> within the 67 km 2 Krycklan catchment, and explore the factors controlling this diffuse flux. All streams in the Krycklan catchment were consistently supersaturated in CO₂ and were hence a source for atmospheric CO₂ all year around. The source for this supersaturation of CO₂ was to a great extent explained by the export of respired C from the catchment soils. This was shown by exploring the export of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) across the soil/stream/atmosphere interfaces in a headwater catchment. The study also found that CO₂ evasion from the stream surface is a rapid process, and that much of the DIC leaving the soils is returned to the atmosphere as CO 2 before leaving the headwaters. Evasion of CO₂ is dependent on the water-atmosphere concentration gradient, but also the gas exchange ability across the water-atmosphere interface (the gas transfer coefficient). The spatiotemporal variability of the gas transfer coefficient for carbon dioxide (KCO 2) was found to be large, but the slope of the stream can be used to predict the spatial component of this variability. The positive relationship between KCO 2 and stream section steepness was used to determine the spatial distribution of gas exchange ability for the entire stream network of forested Sweden. By combining concentration measurements and field-determined relationships with a high resolution digital elevation model (DEM) we were able to model the CO₂ evasion for each grid-cell of stream in the Krycklan catchment. Evasion of CO₂ from the entire stream network constituted a major component (< 69 %) of the entire aquatic C flux. This study highlights the importance of including <b>CO₂</b> evasion from <b>streams</b> in estimates of the aquatic conduit for carbon in boreal regions...|$|R
40|$|A {{commercial}} phosphine (PH₃) generator {{manufactured by}} Beijing Liangmao Technology Development Company Limited, China {{was used in}} a fumigation trial on 5000 tonne bunker storage. The generator’s production of PH₃ {{is controlled by the}} rate of dosing conventional aluminum phosphide (AlP) tablets into 100 kg water in the reaction chamber. Because PH₃ is flammable and explosive if certain a concentration is reached in air, it is usually mixed with carbon dioxide (CO₂) in the weight ratio of 50 : 1. This trial’s objective was to minimise the amount of CO₂ and dilute the generated PH₃ with air. The PH₃ generated is purged from the reaction chamber by a continuous low flow of regulated CO₂ gas. The PH₃-rich <b>CO₂</b> purge <b>stream</b> was fed into the suction inlet of an external venturi. A high pressure fan was used to produce the air flow through the venturi to create the vacuum to suck in and dilute the PH₃ rich stream from the generator. The PH₃ was diluted in the air-flow to ensure a non-flammable concentration of less than 1 % (10. 000 ppm) and thence fed directly into the bunker storage. The trial successfully demonstrated the viability of generating phosphine in this manner, and excellent results in PH₃ concentration and distribution was achieved in very short time periods. The capacity of the generator was limited to 8 kg of AlP tablets, equivalent to 2. 667 kg of PH₃, or sufficient to fumigate 2667 m³ of grain at a dosage rate of 1 g/m³.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) The present {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with geothermal energy and specifically focuses on engineered geothermal systems (EGS), which are among a portfolio of technology options for power generation from geothermal resources. In this cyclic approach (also known as hot-dry-rocks or enhanced geothermal systems), high pressure water (i. e. "geofluid") is first pumped down a borehole (known as injection well) into a bed of hot fractured rock and forced to travel through the bed, capturing the heat content of the rocks. The hot water is then extracted from a second borehole (known as production well) and sent into a binary power plant, where its thermal energy is converted to electricity. The cooled water exiting the power plant is then injected back into the ground to resume the cycle. The aim of this thesis is to advance the understanding of CO₂ based EGS power generation process and verify the merits of using CO₂ rather than water for heat extraction from fractured hot dry rocks. The work has been largely driven by the suitable thermodynamic and transport properties of supercritical CO₂ (scCO₂), {{which makes it a}} desirable candidate for harnessing geothermal energy from hot dry rocks, particularly in regions where water resources are scarce. However, {{only a limited number of}} studies were carried out in the past to assess the viability of the CO₂ based EGS concept. Most of these studies were theoretical examinations of the heat extraction and exergy analysis under a limited range of operational parameters. In addition, research work on the fluid-rock interactions relevant to CO₂ based EGS is also limited and needs further investigation. The present thesis addresses the above knowledge gaps through a combined experimental and theoretical study, resulting to an accurate description of the entire CO₂ based EGS power generation process encompassing the reservoir, wellbore and power plant cycle as well as the fluid-rock geochemical interaction. The specific objectives of the project underlying this thesis were: (1) model development and simulation of the entire CO₂ and H₂O based EGS and the associated power plant cycles, (2) optimisation studies and sensitivity analysis of operating and design parameters affecting CO₂ and H₂O based EGS performance, (3) performance comparison of CO₂ based EGS and H₂O based EGS under the same operating and reservoir conditions, (4) examination of the effect of reservoir parameters on both CO₂ and H₂O based EGS concepts through detailed 3 D reservoir simulations, (5) design and fabrication of a fluid-rock interaction apparatus capable of simulating EGS conditions, and (6) experimental investigation of the fluid-rock interactions at reservoir conditions and its likely impact on the performance characteristics of CO₂ and H₂O based EGS. One dimensional (1 D), 2 D, and 3 D models of integrated reservoir-wellbore-power plant cycle were developed to provide an overall description of fluid flow in fractured reservoir (channel flow) and in radial fluid flow in homogeneous porous media. It was also created to investigate " 3 D effects" as well as transient changes during the power generation process. The thermosiphon power generation process was used in CO₂ based EGS model simulations while the Organic Rankine Cycle binary plant with isopentane as the working fluid was employed in the H₂O based EGS simulations. Mass and energy balance equations associated with the integrated 1 D and 2 D reservoir-wellbore-power plant cycle model simulations were solved using the Engineering Equation Solver (EES). In the integrated 3 D reservoir-wellbore-power plant cycle modelling, the transient geofluid mass and heat flow rates in the reservoir were simulated using TOUGH 2 /ECO 2 N software packages while the wellbore flow and power plant cycle calculations were carried out using EES. The use of TOUGH 2 /ECO 2 N was validated and calibrated by replicating the results of prior studies done by Pruess (2008) where TOUGH 2 /EOSM simulator was used. A fluid-rock interaction apparatus with titanium made wetted components was designed and fabricated to conduct batch and flow-through experimental studies of rock samples with CO₂ and H₂O at pressures up to 50 MPa and temperatures up to 400 °C. Surface granite from Moonbi near New England Highway, NSW and drill core samples from Mossgiel 1 and Nambucurra 1 boreholes at Murray-Darling Basin, NSW were collected and used as representatives of hot-dry-rock (HDR) EGS reservoir rock formations. The granite samples were pulverised and analysed for particle size distribution as well aselement (fused-bead XRF) and mineral (Rietveld quantitative XRD) compositions prior to any experiments. Fluid-rock interaction experiments were conducted for up to 15 days at different simulated reservoir pressures (20 and 35 MPa) and temperatures(200 and 250 °C). Fluid effluents were analysed using ICP-OES, and the reacted pulverised granite samples were subjected to further XRF, XRD, and SEM (scanning electron microscopy) analysis. The following are the key findings of the integrated 1 D/ 2 D reservoir-wellbore-power simulations: • The mass flow rate of CO₂ has an inverse relation with the injection temperature in a CO₂ based EGS while there is a direct relationship between the mass flow rate of water and injection temperature in CO₂ based EGS. These contrasting behaviours can be assigned to the fact that an increase in the injection temperature lowers the CO₂ density and hence increases its dynamic viscosity whereas in the case of water, an increase in the injection temperature lowers H₂O kinematic viscosity and thereby decreases the dynamic viscosity. • Reservoir pressure loss is generally higher for H₂O than for CO₂ because of the higher H₂O kinematic viscosity. • CO₂ overall mass flow rate is higher than that of H₂O due to lower average CO₂ kinematic viscosity at reservoir conditions. • Wellbore frictional loss of CO₂ is greater than that of H₂O due to the lower average CO₂ density along the length of the wellbore. • Heat extraction rates of H₂O based EGS is generally higher than those of CO₂ based EGS due to higher specific heat capacity of water. • The thermal siphoning is not practical for H₂O based EGS because the production pressure is usually lower than the injection pressure. • Power generation output of H₂O based EGS are higher than that of CO₂ based EGS and increases almost linearly as injection pressure increases while CO₂ based EGS power output shows a parabolic trend. These were found to be due to the dependency of CO₂ thermodynamic properties on pressure while H₂O thermodynamic properties are almost independent of pressure. • Reservoir temperature does not influence the overall CO₂ mass flow rate, but CO₂ heat extraction rate increases as reservoir temperature increases due to increase in the specific enthalpy change. • The maximum power generation of CO₂ based EGS decreases as reservoir pressure decreases due to lower CO₂ production pressure in the wellhead. • For both CO₂ and H₂O based EGS, shorter injection to production well distance gives higher fluid mass flow rate due to the increase in pressure gradient (pressure drop/distance) between the injection and production wells. • As the ratio of production to injection well increases, the CO₂ based EGS power generation output increases due to diminishing CO₂ frictional loss in individual production well as the number of production well increases. • CO₂ based EGS generally performs better in low permeability reservoirs (typically one order of magnitude decrease in reservoir permeability decreases CO₂ mass flow rates by 27 % while H₂O mass flow rates decreases by 67 %). • The overall thermal efficiency at any specified injection and reservoir conditions is constant regardless of CO₂ mass flow rate. Batch and flow-through CO₂-rock interaction experiments show that Ca, Fe, Mg, Al, and Si dissolve in scCO₂, which was found to be partly due to the presence of H₂O in the <b>CO₂</b> <b>stream</b> leaked from the piston accumulator. Geochemical model simulations show that aqueous Si concentration is in equilibrium with the rock minerals after 1 day exposure in the batch experiment. The log of (Na/K) ratios shows the preferential dissolution of albite over k-feldspar. The SEM image analysis of the treated granites shows signs of erosion (i. e. rounded edges and pebble-like surfaces), which is considered to be due to the formation of carbonates in the surface and its subsequent erosion and dissolution (particularly Na₂CO₃ and K₂CO₃) to the fluid. The XFR analysis of the untreated and treated pulverised granites shows very small changes to SiO₂, Al₂O₃, CaO, MgO, Fe₂O₃, Na₂O, and K₂O major oxide compositions consistent with the ICP-OES analytical results. The Na-K-Mg ternary diagram of the data collected from the fluid-rock experiments shows that the aqueous fluid is far from the equilibrium. The presence and/or absence of minerals (hornblende or chlorite) in the starting material influences the log of (Na/K) ratios. Hornblende alters or converts to chlorite in the CO₂-H₂O mixture. Moreover, the concentrations of Ca, Mg, and Fe decreases with time, which is considered to be due to the formation of a passive layer of insoluble carbonate minerals in the surface, thus preventing further fluid-rock interaction. The pressure loss data collected during the flow-through fluid-rock interaction experiments validate the theory that CO₂ has lower reservoir loss than H₂O. The data also validate the correlation between particle size and intrinsic permeability, which predicts that at the same fluid mass flow rate, a medium with a larger particle size has a lower pressure loss...|$|E

The operational parameters are temperature, humidity of the inlet gas <b>stream,</b> and <b>CO(2)</b> concentration in the feed stream. The data show that this system effectively captures CO(2) over the range 400 ppm to at least 100, 000 ppm, at or around ambient temperature and pressure. In a single pass across this homogeneous catalyst design, given a feed of 0. 1 % CO(2), the selectivity of CO(2) versus N(2) is 1, 090 : 1 and CO(2) versus O(2) is 790 : 1.

We {{have been}} {{measuring}} concentrations of the trace gases nitrous oxide (N₂O), methane (CH₄), {{and carbon dioxide}} (CO₂) and other parameters in 17 headwater streams within the South Fork Broad River (SFBR) watershed {{on a monthly basis}} since January 2001. Land use within each watershed was calculated from the National Land Cover Data (NLCD) database. The concentrations of all three gases have varied widely {{over the course of the}} study, and have frequently (N₂O) or always (CH₄ and CO₂) exceeded levels expected if the streams were in equilibrium with atmospheric concentrations of these gases. Streams draining highly developed watersheds have the highest N₂O and <b>CO₂</b> concentrations and <b>streams</b> draining pasture-dominated watersheds have the highest CH₄ concentrations. Streams draining forested watersheds have the lowest N₂ 2 O, CO₂, and CH₄ concentrations. The concentrations of all three of these trace gases exhibit significant positive correlations with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) concentrations suggesting that they may be useful indicators of organic waste and/or nutrient inputs to streams. In some cases, elevated stream trace gas concentrations may serve as early warning indicators of watershed disturbance...|$|R

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) The {{increasing}} {{emissions of}} such greenhouse gases as carbon dioxide (CO₂) foster {{the need for}} the removal of <b>CO₂</b> from gas <b>streams,</b> especially from coal-fired power stations. One of the common technologies of CO₂ Post Combustion Capture (PCC) is reversible chemical absorption using amine-based solvents. For PCC to be efficient, the rate of the absorption of CO₂ in aqueous solution has to be fast in order to minimise the spatial requirements of the absorber column. Therefore, the catalysis of CO₂ hydration/dehydration is of utmost interest. In this project, series of inorganic oxoanions and carbonic anhydrases were studied by stopped-flow spectrophotometry with the aim of elucidating their chemistry in the interaction with CO₂ and finding a good catalyst for PCC. Additionally, it is crucial to closely monitor the PCC process by developing on-line analyses. Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy is a promising spectroscopic tool for this purpose thanks to its robustness and ease of data interpretation. The second focus of this project is to investigate the feasibility of using FT-IR spectroscopy for on-line analysis for PCC application by monitoring the kinetics of the reaction of bicarbonate with MEA by this spectroscopy. The outcomes of this project would benefit the development of effective CO₂ capture facilities, contributing to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The limitations in terms of time consumption and complexity of the traditional method to study an enzymatic system inspired the development of a novel kinetic procedure to analyse the efficiency of enzymatic catalysis, i. e. the Michaelis-Menten parameters. The principle of this method is that the kinetics of an enzymatically catalysed reaction is observed from the initial high substrate concentration until the substrate is entirely consumed. The course of the reaction process is followed via the solution pH changes. This approach is different from the integration method in which the determination of the substrate or product concentration is required, which is difficult. The new procedure has been applied to the study of urea hydrolysis by jack bean urease. Not only have the Michaelis constant and catalytic constant been determined with ease, the catalytic mechanism of urease was further clarified. This novel method is applicable to the study of many other enzymatic systems...|$|R

The final revised paper is available at: [URL] amount of organic carbon is stored in high latitude soils. A substantial proportion of this carbon stock is vulnerable and may decompose rapidly due to temperature increases that are already greater than the global average. It is therefore crucial to quantify and understand carbon exchange between the atmosphere and subarctic/arctic ecosystems. In this paper, we combine an arctic-enabled version of the process-based dynamic ecosystem model, LPJ-GUESS (version LPJG-WHyMe-TFM) with comprehensive observations of terrestrial and aquatic carbon fluxes to simulate long-term carbon exchange in a subarctic catchment comprising both mineral and peatland soils. The model is applied at 50 m resolution and is shown to be able to capture the seasonality and magnitudes of observed fluxes at this fine scale. The modelled magnitudes of CO₂ uptake generally follow the descending sequence: birch forest, non-permafrost Eriophorum, Sphagnum and then tundra heath during the observation periods. The catchment-level carbon fluxes from aquatic systems are dominated by <b>CO₂</b> emissions from <b>streams.</b> Integrated across the whole catchment, we estimate that the area is a carbon sink at present, and will become an even stronger carbon sink by 2080, which is mainly a result of a projected densification of birch forest and its encroachment into tundra heath. However, the magnitudes of the modelled sinks are very dependent on future atmospheric CO₂ concentrations. Furthermore, comparisons of global warming potentials between two simulations with and without CO₂ increase since 1960 reveal that the increased methane emission from the peatland could double the warming effects of the whole catchment by 2080 in the absence of CO₂ fertilization of the vegetation. This is the first process-based model study of the temporal evolution of a catchment-level carbon budget at high spatial resolution, integrating comprehensive and diverse fluxes including both terrestrial and aquatic carbon. Though this study also highlights some limitations in modelling subarctic ecosystem responses to climate change including aquatic system flux dynamics, nutrient limitation, herbivory and other disturbances and peatland expansion, our application provides a mechanism to resolve the complexity of carbon cycling in subarctic ecosystems while simultaneously pointing out the key model developments for capturing complex subarctic processes...|$|R
40|$|This Ph. D. {{research}} project targets Cooper Basin oil reservoirs of very low permeability (approximately 1 mD) where injectivities required for water flooding are not achievable. However, {{the use of}} injection gases such as CO₂ would not have injectivity problems. CO₂ is abundant {{in the region and}} available for EOR use. CO₂ was compared to other CO₂-rich injection gases with a hydrocarbon content including pentane plus components. While the effect of hydrocarbon components up to butane have been investigated in the past, the effect of n-pentane has on impure <b>CO₂</b> gas <b>streams</b> has not. One particular field of the Cooper Basin was investigated in detail (Field A). However, since similar reservoir and fluid characteristics of Field A are common to the region it is expected that the data measured and developed has applications to many other oil reservoirs of the region and similar reservoirs elsewhere. The aim of this Ph. D. project is to determine the applicability of CO₂ as an injection gas for Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) in the Cooper Basin oil reservoirs and to compare CO₂ with other possible CO₂-rich injection gases. The summarised goals of this research are to: • Determine the compatibility of Field A reservoir fluid with CO₂ as an injection gas. • Compare CO₂ to other injection gas options for Field A. • Development of a correlation to predict the effect of nC₅ on MMP for a CO₂- rich injection gas stream. These goals were achieved through the following work: • Extensive experimental studies of the reservoir properties and the effects of interaction between CO₂-rich injection gas streams and Field A reservoir fluid measuring properties related to: •	Miscibility of the injection gas with Field A reservoir fluid •	Solubility and swelling properties of the injection gas with Field A reservoir fluid •	Change in viscosity-pressure relationship of Field A reservoir fluid due to addition of injection gas • A reservoir condition core flood experiment • Compositional simulation of the reservoir condition core flood to compare expected recoveries from different injection gases • Development of a set of Minimum Miscibility Pressure (MMP) measurements targeted at correlating the effect of nC₅ on CO₂ MMP. The key findings of this research are as follows: • Miscibility is achievable at practical pressures for Field A and similar reservoir fluids with pure CO₂ or CO₂-rich injection gases. • For Field A reservoir fluid, viscosity of the remaining flashed liquid will increase at pressures below ~ 2500 psi due to mixing the reservoir fluid with a CO₂-rich injection gas stream. • Comparison of injection gases showed that methane rich gases are miscible with Field A so long as a significant quantity of C₃+ components is also present in the gas stream. • There is a defined trend for effect of nC₅ on MMP of impure CO₂. This trend was correlated with an error of less than 4 %. • Even though oil composition is taken into account with the base gas MMP, it still affects the trend for effect of nC₅ on MMP of a CO₂-rich gas stream. • An oil characterisation factor was developed to account for this effect, significantly improving the results, reducing the error of the correlation to only 1. 6 %. The significance of these findings is as follows: • An injection pressure above ~ 3000 psi should be targeted. At these pressures miscibility is achieved and the viscosity of the reservoir fluid injection gas mix is reduced. • CO₂ should be compared to gases such as Tim Gas should after considering the cost of compression, pipeline costs and distance from source to destination will need to be considered. • The addition of nC₅ will reduce the MMP and increase the recovery factor, however the cost of the nC₅ used would be more than the value of increased oil recovered. • The developed correlation for the effect of nC₅ on impure CO₂ MMP can be used broadly within the limits of the correlation. • Further research using more oils is necessary to validate the developed oil characterisation factor and if successful, using the same or similar method used to improve other correlations.

We measured C losses as soil respiration and methane (CH(4)) flux, direct CO(2) and CH(4) fluxes from the stream surface and fluvial export of dissolved inorganic C (DIC), dissolved organic C (DOC), and particulate C over an annual hydrologic cycle from a 1, 319 -ha forested Amazon perennial first-order headwater watershed at Tanguro Ranch in the southern Amazon state of Mato Grosso. Stream pCO(2) concentrations ranged from 6, 491 to 14, 976 mu atm and directly-measured <b>stream</b> <b>CO(2)</b> outgassing flux was 5, 994 +/- A 677 g C m(- 2) y(- 1) of stream surface. Stream pCH(4) concentrations ranged from 291 to 438 mu atm and measured stream CH(4) outgassing flux was 987 +/- A 221 g C m(- 2) y(- 1). Despite high flux rates from the stream surface, the small area of stream itself (970 m(2), or 0. 007 % of watershed area) led to small directly-measured annual fluxes of CO(2) (0. 44 +/- A 0. 05 g C m(2) y(- 1)) and CH(4) (0. 07 +/- A 0. 02 g C m(2) y(- 1)) per unit watershed land area. Measured fluvial export of DIC (0. 78 +/- A 0. 04 g C m(- 2) y(- 1)), DOC (0. 16 +/- A 0. 03 g C m(- 2) y(- 1)) and coarse plus fine particulate C (0. 001 +/- A 0. 001 g C m(- 2) y(- 1)) per unit watershed land area were also small. However, stream discharge accounted for only 12 % of the modeled annual watershed water output because deep groundwater flows dominated total runoff from the watershed. When C in this bypassing groundwater was included, total watershed export was 10. 83 g C m(- 2) y(- 1) as CO(2) outgassing, 11. 29 g C m(- 2) y(- 1) as fluvial DIC and 0. 64 g C m(- 2) y(- 1) as fluvial DOC. Outgassing fluxes were somewhat lower than the 40 - 50 g C m(- 2) y(- 1) reported from other Amazon watersheds and may result in part from lower annual rainfall at Tanguro. Total stream-associated gaseous C losses were two orders of magnitude less than soil respiration (696 +/- A 147 g C m(- 2) y(- 1)), but total losses of C transported by water comprised up to about 20 % of the +/- A 150 g C m(- 2) (+/- 1. 5 Mg C ha(- 1)) that is exchanged annually across Amazon tropical forest canopies.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) The main {{aim of this}} {{contribution}} is in demonstrating the process of decarbonation of aqueous solutions, or the controlled removal of carbon dioxide (CO₂) from aqueous solutions, as a process for aqueous mineral carbonation, specifically the production of magnesium (Mg) carbonates. Unlike more conventional mineral carbonation processes, which require the addition of alkaline agents, the engendering of supersaturation sufficient for precipitation is achieved through the inducement of a pH swing directly {{as a result of}} decarbonation. This pH change, dependent on the amount of CO₂ removed from solution, is calculable and measurable, and can thus be engineered both in terms of the degree of pH shift and the amount of Mg carbonate formed. Additionally, this thesis examines the sequestration of CO₂ using solutions augmented with heat activated serpentinite. The resultant Mg bicarbonate solutions can in turn be exploited for decarbonation and resultant mineral carbonation. The overall process, comprised of the sequestration of CO₂ using prepared solutions and the degassing of these solutions, can be operated under mild conditions. Experiments were conducted to examine the parameters affecting decarbonation processes. Mg sulfate (MgSO₄) and sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO₃) solutions were used in experimentation. Scenedesmus microalgae, a single celled green alga, was used for biological decarbonation experiments. Batch experiments using the Scenedesmus alga confirmed its role in accelerating decarbonation and consequently reducing the time needed to precipitate Mg carbonate. Research concentrated on decarbonation via degassing, using a variety of nitrogen (N₂) sparging devices, because of the rapidity, simplicity and controllability of the process. Batch experiments involved N₂ discharging into a solution-charged reactor and similar trends were observed for all experiments with CO₂ degassing rapidly producing Mg carbonates, with significantly accelerated rates of CO₂ degassing being achieved using smaller bubbles and higher temperatures. Nesquehonite (MgCO₃· 3 H₂O) was the precipitated mineral phase for both the 30 °C and 50 °C experiments. Degassing and precipitation experiments were also conducted with carbonic anhydrase (CA) as a supplement to reagents and these experiments showed greater rates of degassing and resultant precipitation. A mathematical model describing the kinetic response of the bulk solution to CO₂ degassing through N₂ sparging, and the resulting precipitation of Mg carbonate, was formulated and was found to closely follow that calculated through thermodynamic simulation. The model allowed the performance of batch, semibatch and continuous degassing reactors or crystallisers to be assessed. Extension of the kinetic model to semibatch and continuous mode of operation showed that rate of degassing was controlling to steady-state rate of precipitation. Experiments were also conducted on the dissolution of heat activated serpentinite in CO₂-saturated water in order to prepare solutions suitable for degassing. These dissolution experiments were conducted under mild conditions and it was found that extraction of the Mg (typically around 10 % of total Mg in the activated mineral) and increase of the pH of the leachate occurred very quickly. A series of small scale isothermal dissolution experiments was also undertaken to understand the kinetics of the mineral dissolution process. Short-term system response was found to be consistent with rapid dissolution of the shallow external surface of the particle and an Avrami-Erofe’ev type model fitted data well. Mineral dissolution showed strong temperature dependency, and there was also clear evidence of both particle condition and pH limiting rate controls on continuing dissolution. The rate of CO₂ mass transfer to the solution was shown to be of prime importance in mineral dissolution response. The observed variation in pH was accounted for by coupling the apparent solid-state model with the Mg carbonate system kinetic model incorporating simplified representation of CO₂ mass transfer. The kinetic model of the system, particular to the experimental reacting system, was used to assess the performance of continuous mineral dissolution or leaching. The solutions derived from batch mineral dissolution experiments were used in subsequent small batch degassing and precipitation experiments. The trends exhibited in these experiments mirrored those of batch degassing and precipitation experiments using prepared reagent based solutions and also produced nesquehonite, although a small amount of an amorphous Mg silicate phase was precipitated. A process for aqueous mineral carbonation involving the dissolution of the thermally conditioned serpentinite and the degassing of the leachate derived from dissolution operated as separate but integrated process units on a continuous basis was presented. The process being operated at relatively low temperatures and pressures with recovery and recycling of both the solution and vented <b>CO₂</b> gas <b>streams</b> being possible.

40|$|The {{discovery}} of novel light responsive adsorbents for carbon capture and release is reported {{here for the}} first time. These materials were found to exhibit dynamic or static photoswitchable properties in the broadband or visible light range during CO 2 adsorption measurements. Prior to the publication of my work, no dynamic photoswitchable adsorbent or full utilisation of visible light to trigger carbon capture and release was known. Thus the pioneering work presented in this thesis provides a significant breakthrough for the carbon capture technologies that could potentially allow the process to be operated at a significantly lower cost and energy than conventional methods. Commonly, the separation of <b>CO₂</b> from a <b>stream</b> of gases involves the chemisorption of CO₂ by amines, the release from which is triggered by pressure and temperature. Although it is an effective process, amine degradation and regeneration are the main problems in post-combustion capture technologies. The regeneration of amines requires a large energy input which can result in ~ 30 % reduction in power plant capacity. Such limitations prompted research on different sorbent materials that display reversible adsorption using low cost triggers. While temperature, pressure, pH and microwave stimuli responsive materials have potential applications in gas adsorption technologies, light, particularly in the visible light range is the least disruptive stimulus for triggering carbon capture and release efficiently and it is highly abundant in nature, in the form of sunlight. New classes of porous materials: Metal-organic Frameworks (MOFs) and porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs) were explored as potential CO₂ sorbent materials due to their excellent performance in CO₂ apture and tunable properties. To achieve highly efficient utilisation of sunlight in carbon capture processes, porous materials with light responsive properties were developed according to the energy levels in the solar spectrum. The solar spectrum consists of 7 % ultraviolet, 47 % visible and 46 % infrared light. The concept of using non-filtered light as a practical approach was ideal. However, the use of filtered light to eliminate UV light and obtain visible light irradiation was also attractive as it constitutes the major fraction of solar radiation intensity. Furthermore, it is more environmentally friendly and greater exposure due to deeper light penetration could be achieved. Thus porous adsorbents that could respond to light in the broadband range or specifically in the visible light range were developed. In the course of the research project, four novel light responsive materials were successfully developed; two of which respond in the broadband light range and the other respond in the visible light range. The first dynamically photoswitchable MOF (Zn(AzDC) (4, 4 ’-BPE) 0. 5) for reversible carbon capture and release was reported. The MOF contained azobenzene and stilbene derivative linker molecules, in which photoirradiation resulted in the fast-bending motion of these molecules. Thus, up to 42 % and 64 % static and dynamic photoresponse were achieved respectively. This was the highest dynamic photoresponse obtained at the time of publication. The development of more broadband light responsive adsorbents was conducted further in the research. The work led to the {{discovery of}} photoresponsive PAF containing diarylethene (DArE) guest molecules (DArE@PAF- 1). The dynamic carbon capture and release was triggered by the interaction between photoactive DArE molecules with the PAF. At high guest loading concentration, photoresponse can reach up to 24 %. As earlier work showed great promise for light triggered carbon capture applications, improvements were focused on using more penetrating light trigger, such as visible light. As a result, an adsorbent that could respond exclusively to visible light was developed. Furthermore, unique adsorption behaviour was obtained for a reversible carbon capture and release process. The introduction of visible light guest molecules (methyl red, MR) into the host (Mg-MOF- 74) displayed a pressure-gate system, in which light could be used to tune the gate-opening pressure. Photoirradiation of the sample resulted in the photoswitching of the guest molecules, whereby lesser contact with the host allowed more adsorption sites to be accessible. Thus upon irradiation, a significant increase in CO₂ uptake adsorption of up to 84 % was obtained. This is the highest photoresponse ever reported to date under static condition using visible light trigger. Further development led to the discovery of a water stable adsorbent that is visible light responsive. Again, methyl red (MR) was used as the visible light responsive molecule. The incorporation of the guest molecule into water stable MIL- 53 (Al) resulted in a similar photoresponse trend, in which prolonged irradiation resulted in the increase in CO₂ uptake adsorption of up to 9 % at lower guest loading (15 wt %) and 46 % at higher guest loading (50 wt %). The light responsive nature and recyclability of these adsorbents represents a new strategy for lowering the cost and energy for sorbent regeneration, a main problem associated with conventional carbon capture technologies...|$|R
