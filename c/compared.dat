5|$|A.coccinea {{closely resembles}} A.arachnoidea, {{but may be}} {{distinguished}} from the latter by its bright red arms, and its larger spores (4–5 by 2.5–3μm in A.coccinea <b>compared</b> with 2.5–3.5 by 1.5μm in A.arachnoidea). A.arachnoidea is known from Asia and West Africa. A.rubra is a relatively common pantropical species, and differs from A.coccinea in its reddish receptacle (<b>compared</b> with pink to cream-colored in A.coccinea) and bifurcating arms that are typically multichambered.|$|E

5|$|Dazzle's {{effectiveness}} {{was highly}} uncertain {{at the time}} of the First World War, but it was nonetheless adopted both in the UK and North America. In 1918, the Admiralty analysed shipping losses, but was unable to draw clear conclusions. Dazzle ships were attacked in 1.47% of sailings, <b>compared</b> to 1.12% for uncamouflaged ships, suggesting increased visibility, but as Wilkinson had argued, dazzle was not attempting to make ships hard to see. Suggestively, of the ships that were struck by torpedoes, 43% of the dazzle ships sank, <b>compared</b> to 54% of the uncamouflaged; and similarly, 41% of the dazzle ships were struck amidships, <b>compared</b> to 52% of the uncamouflaged. These comparisons could be taken to imply that submarine commanders did have more difficulty in deciding where a ship was heading and where to aim. However, the ships painted in dazzle were larger than the uncamouflaged ships, 38% of them being over 5000 tons <b>compared</b> to only 13% of uncamouflaged ships, making comparisons unreliable.|$|E
