50|$|Off-road <b>cycle</b> <b>tires,</b> colloquially called knobbies, may {{be found}} on motocross and enduro motorcycles, ATVs, and {{mountain}} bikes. Tires for single-track vehicles and ATVs have a curved profile such that some tread only contacts the ground during turning.|$|R
50|$|Tread lugs {{provide the}} contact surface {{necessary}} to provide traction. As the tread lug enters the road contact area, or footprint, it is compressed. As it rotates through the footprint it is deformed circumferentially. As it exits the footprint, it recovers to its original shape. During the deformation and recovery <b>cycle</b> the <b>tire</b> exerts variable forces into the vehicle. These forces are described as Force Variation.|$|R
50|$|The {{changes to}} Sprint All-Star Race XXIV from XXIII {{was not only}} the name change with Roman numerials akin to the Super Bowl, and the first All-Star Race {{utilizing}} the Car of Tomorrow template, but also an expansion of the race by 25%. Each quarter now had five more laps to race, which changes the complexion of each segment, as tire wear will become a greater factor as well as fuel milage would become more of an issue throughout the race. The 2007 race with its 20-lap segments was treated more of a sprint race; the 2008 race with 25-lap segments means a car will use nearly one-half tank of fuel and <b>cycle</b> the <b>tires</b> through one half of a tire run.|$|R
5000|$|Inner {{tubes are}} not {{completely}} impermeable to air and slowly lose pressure over time. Butyl inner tubes hold pressure better than latex. [...] Tires inflated from carbon dioxide canisters (often used for roadside repairs) or helium (occasionally used for elite track racing) lose pressure more quickly, because the first gas, despite being a large molecule, is slightly soluble in rubber, {{and the second is}} a very small atom which passes quickly through any porous material. At least one public bicycle sharing system, London's Santander <b>Cycles,</b> is inflating <b>tires</b> with nitrogen, instead of simple air, which is already 78% nitrogen, in an attempt to keep the tires at the proper inflation pressure longer, though the effectiveness of this is debatable.|$|R

40|$|Steel fibre {{reinforced}} concrete (SFRC) is a construction material investigated {{for more than}} 40 years including for pavement applications. A {{number of studies have}} demonstrated the technical merits of SFRC pavements over conventional concrete pavements; however little work has been carried out on the environmental and economical impact of SFRC during the pavement’s life cycle. Therefore, extended research was undertaken {{within the framework of the}} EU funded project “EcoLanes” to estimate the environmental and economical loadings of SFRC pavements. The innovative concept of the project is the use of recycled steel tyre-cord wire as concrete fibre reinforcement, which provides additional environmental benefits for tyre recycling over landfilling. Within the project framework a demonstration of a steel-fibre-reinforced roller-compacted concrete (SFR-RCC) pavement was constructed in a rural area in Cyprus. In order to assess the economical and environmental picture of the demonstration pavement, life cycle cost analysis (LCCA) and life cycle assessment (LCA) studies were undertaken, which also compared the under study pavement design with four conventional alternatives. The main output of the studies is that SFR-RCC is more environmentally and economically sustainable than others. In addition, various concrete mix designs were investigated by considering parameters such as fibre type and dosage, cement type, and transportation distances to the construction site. Fibre dosage has been highlighted as a crucial factor compared with economical and environmental loadings in SFR-RCC pavement construction. steel fibre {{reinforced concrete}}; life <b>cycle</b> assessment; <b>tire</b> recycling...|$|R
50|$|A fatbike is {{a bicycle}} with wide, {{oversized}} tires, typically 3.8 in or larger and rims 2.6 in or wider, designed for low inflation to allow riding on soft unstable terrain such as snow. The {{name is a}} reference to the fatness of the tires used on the <b>cycles.</b> The wide <b>tires</b> can be used with inflation pressures as low as 5 psi (340 hPa) to allow for a smooth ride.Surly Bikes released the Pugsley frame, in 2005, and began producing Large Marge 65 mm rims and Endomorph 3.8-inch tires in 2006. The Pugsley frame, rim and tire offerings made fatbikes commercially available in local bike shops worldwide. Other early versions of the fatbike were normal mountain bikes equipped with SnowCat rims, created by Simon Rakower of All-Weather Sports in Fairbanks, Alaska in the early 1990s; or with multiple tires seated on two or three standard rims that had been welded or pinned together.|$|R
40|$|The {{antilock}} {{braking system}} (ABS) is an active control system, which prevents the wheels from locking-up during severe braking. The ABS control cycle rapidly modulates braking pressure at each wheel mainly based on tire peripheral acceleration. Significant wheel speed oscillations and consequent fast variations of tire longitudinal slip are a consequence, which, in turn, produce a corresponding variation of tire longitudinal force according to the ABS control <b>cycle.</b> Clearly, <b>tire</b> characteristics, namely, tire peak friction (regulating maximum vehicle deceleration), longitudinal stiffness, optimal slip ratio, curvature factor (regulating {{the position of the}} peak of µ-slip curve and the subsequent drop), and relaxation length (accounting for tire dynamic response) may significantly influence ABS performance. The aim of the present paper is to evaluate the effect of the main tire parameters on ABS performance. This task is, however, very challenging, since tire characteristics are intrinsically related, and the analysis involves interaction between tires, vehicle, and ABS control logic. A methodology based on the hardware-in-the-loop (HiL) technique is used. This approach was selected to overcome limitations of numerical simulations or difficulties related to the execution of onroad experimental tests (repeatability, costs, etc.). The developed HiL test bench includes all the physical elements of the braking system of a vehicle (comprising the ABS control unit) and a 14 degrees of freedom (dofs) vehicle model, which are synchronized by a real-time board. With the developed HiL test bench, a sensitivity analysis was carried out to assess the influence of tire peak friction, longitudinal stiffness, and relaxation length on ABS performance, evaluated in terms of braking distance, mean longitudinal acceleration, and energy distribution...|$|R
40|$|UHF passive RFID tags {{embedded}} in tires {{have a deep}} impact on <b>tire</b> life <b>cycle</b> management and <b>tire</b> monitoring. In this work, we present the power transmission of UHF passive embedded RFID in tires. In UHF passive embedded RFID systems in tires, the bidirectional radio link between reader and tags goes through air and tires. The total path loss contains reflection loss at tire-air boundaries and attenuation loss in the tires. The power transmission {{is based on the}} permittivity of tires and tire-air boundary conditions. We give an OCP method for measuring the permittivity of tires. By analyzing the radio link for UHF passive RFID, we establish a model of wave propagation of UHF embedded RFID in tires and make numerical analyses. Numerical analyses show that the error of the OCP methods for measuring the permittivity of tires is small, the parallel polarization and normal incidence of wave are chosen for improving the performance of the UHF embedded RFID in tires, and distance is chosen to keep power transmission function from locating valley...|$|R
40|$|This study {{describes}} two Northwestern Argentina Low (NAL) episodes {{for summer}} and winter with emphasis on the characterization of their three-dimensional structure and their temporal variability. With {{the aid of a}} high resolution regional model (ETA/CPTEC), the main mechanisms involved in the NAL <b>tire</b> <b>cycle</b> were studied. The summer NAL surface pressure changes are clearly dominated by the 600 / 1000 hPa thickness variability. lu winter, this efIect is added to the 600 hPa geopotential height falI associated with an upper leveI troUgh approach. The rnodulation ofNAL pressure oscillations by thickness variability, strongly suggest its therrnal feature. Based on this result, the temperature tendency equation has been used to quantify alI the contributions to thermal changes. The summer event has been dorninated by surface warming. This unique mechanisrn can explain the low pressure system forrnation by itself. In winter, the surface+radiative heat balance in the 600 / 1000 hPa layer is weakly negative. lu the analyzed case the Zonda efIect has been the main responsible for the NAL developrnentPages: 3682 - 368...|$|R
40|$|Lighter-weight bridge decks are {{becoming}} more widely used, particularly for rehabilitation of aging bridges, as they can increase the live load capacity and {{eliminate the need for}} costly superstructure and substructure strengthening. Many popular prefabricated deck systems have been developed including concrete-filled steel grid decks. Due to the proprietary nature of these deck systems, manufacturers often claim superior durability while no adequate testing procedure has been developed for the qualification and acceptance of prefabricated bridge deck systems. ^ The behavior of a large-scale composite partially-filled steel grid deck under rolling live load was established and used to aid {{in the development of a}} cyclic load test. Roll testing was performed to determine the locations of the maximum response of critical deck details. The cyclic tests represent millions of <b>cycles</b> of truck <b>tire</b> loading and were used to evaluate the durability of critical details in the deck. Load was applied to longitudinal and transverse field splices. These cyclic tests were later applied to subassembly deck specimens as part of a larger research project to develop a bridge deck testing specification. The results confirmed that the partially-filled grid deck behaved compositely with the supporting beams and that the durability of the critical details in the large-scale grid deck could be represented by subassembly specimens. ...|$|R
40|$|By {{evaluating}} tires from {{a perspective}} of industrial metabolism, potential novel and practical {{ways to reduce}} their environmental impact can be found. This may be achieved by focusing on technological issues such as choosing materials, designing products, and recovering materials, or by looking at institutional and social barriers and incentives such as opening waste markets or changing consumer behavior. A model is presented for the life <b>cycle</b> of truck <b>tires</b> in Western Europe that is dynamic in nature and values both environmental and economic consequences. Various scenarios are simulated including longer tire lifetimes, better maintenance of tire pressure, increased use of less-expensive Asian tires, and increased use of fuel efficiency-enhancing tires ("eco-tires"). Tentative results indicate that, among other things, more than 95 % of the overall environmental impact during {{the life of a}} tire occurs during the use of the tire, due to the impact of tires on automotive fuel efficiency. Better maintenance of tire pressure and use of eco-tires produce greater environmental and economics benefits than more-durable and/or less-expensive (Asian) tires. These results imply that the emphasis in environmental policies related to tires should shift from the production and the waste stages to the consumption stage. It also suggests that the focus on materials throughput and associated improvements through factor 4 or factor 10 advances in reduction in mass are less important than the quality of the tires and their management...|$|R
