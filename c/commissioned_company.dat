40|$|Histories {{are used}} and {{produced}} {{for several reasons}} and purposes. History culture consists of the entirety of generations, modifications, transformations and utilisations of {{the images of the}} past. This article is concerned with corporate history culture that is manifested in <b>commissioned</b> <b>company</b> histories and other representations of company history. History culture is always oriented to the future. Corporate history culture developed out of the demand in companies, not within universities. I clarify, in the light of a microhistorical case of Porin Puuvilla Oy, how and why different actors select one past to be historicised and leave another to be obsolete. I open my contribution with an introduction to the concepts and practices of corporate history culture and history management. Then I move on to the case study and analyse the way that practice and representations of corporate history culture changed between 1948 and 1973. As my methodological contribution, I introduce the analytical four-field of the internal and external dimensions of history management. I conclude the article with a discussion of the corporate history culture {{in the context of the}} concepts of retro and nostalgia...|$|E

50|$|Carl A. Swanson (1879 - 1949) was a Swedish {{immigrant}} {{who worked on}} a farm in Blair, Nebraska, until he moved to Omaha. There, he worked in a grocery store where he came into contact with John O. Jerpe, who owned a small <b>commission</b> <b>company,</b> in which Swanson would become a partner in 1899. Initially, the Jerpe <b>Commission</b> <b>Company</b> purchased eggs and cream from local farmers. In turn, they processed the eggs, made butter from the cream, and sold these products to distributors and charged a commission to the farmers. With Swanson as a partner in the company, it began to expand. The Jerpe <b>Commission</b> <b>Company</b> began to sell chicken, turkey, and other meat. Swanson would eventually buy the company from Jerpe and rename it to C.A. Swanson and Sons, as his sons Gilbert and Clarke had joined the business.|$|R

40|$|The {{world today}} faces many {{challenges}} {{in terms of}} sustainability and how {{the world will be}} able to continue to meet demands of future generations. Sustainability aspects are considered by customers and organizations to a greater extent today than ever before. Businesses need to find new ways forward to encourage sustainable consumption to be able to exist in the future. The increasing amount of food waste represents one of many sustainability challenges and is a stated problem in developed countries. In Sweden, the households stand for the biggest amount of food waste along the entire supply chain. Producing something that is later wasted is an inefficient use of resources. This study aims to identify barriers for consumers to act pro-environmentally when consuming products of low involvement and find ways for the industry to overcome them. The thesis is commissioned for a large bread company in Sweden, who is in the starting blocks of start selling frozen bread, something that is not done to a great extent today. Frozen bread is a more environmentally sustainable alternative than substitute products and it will serve as the low-involvement product in focus of this study. The theoretical framework is built on theories regarding consumer decision-making, consumer behavior, sustainability and sustainable consumption. Through in-store observations of customers accompanied by follow-up interviews, a solid amount of data was gathered which allowed the authors to address the gap between intentions and behavior. Semi-structured interviews with the manager of the grocery store and the <b>commissioned</b> <b>company</b> give insights to the industry perspective of sustainability and consumer behavior. The empirical findings are presented from each data collection instance and are later analyzed and discussed with regard to four sub-purposes and the theoretical framework. The results have shown that existing barriers relate to customers’ habits, inertia, attitudes and lack of knowledge. The industry has the opportunity to bring forward sustainable products without tradeoffs, to create a win-win situation. By appealing to the customers’ hedonic needs and informing them about environmental benefits it is possible to influence customer norms to achieve a pro-environmental behavioral change. ...|$|E
40|$|Social {{media has}} {{become a part of}} our daily lives. Consumers and {{companies}} both use social media as a means of communication, way to stay connected and a channel to report on important topics. There is plenty of research investigating how B 2 C companies use social media to their advantage, but very little information is available on how B 2 B companies utilize it. Keeping in mind digital future developments, B 2 B studies {{are becoming more and more}} important. This research acknowledges previous research on social media marketing, analytics and social CRM. Based on theoretical findings a proposed model for a B 2 B social CRM strategy is presented. Relevant social media channels are explained, highlighting how they differ from each other. Twitter, LinkedIn and Facebook are the three social media channels that are further examined and used in the case study analysis. The aim of this thesis is to explore and analyze the characteristics of social media usage in a B 2 B company. This is achieved by exploring the most successful and unsuccessful social media posts a B 2 B company has posted on their social media channels. The empirical study is conducted by analyzing social media posts in three different social media channels, during the course of one year. The empirical research identifies different content and post types a B 2 B company posts on their social media channels. The study explains the characteristics of a successful and an unsuccessful post on different channels and results are finalized into a B 2 B social CRM strategy. A cross tabulation and chi-square analysis are also conducted. Concrete recommendations are made to the <b>commissioned</b> <b>company,</b> UPM Raflatac. The discoveries of this study show nine different content types, based on the focus point of each social media post. Results conclude it is recommended for the company to continue posting on Twitter and Facebook. Posts on LinkedIn should not be about sustainability and the updates should not be posted on Mondays, as they have low engagements. Technical jargon should be avoided, as well as long and difficult products names. Special attention should be put on the tone of voice of each post, as it should not be too formal but relaxed and conversational. The results of this thesis give guidance to social media managers and encourage them to analyze available data and act according to the results...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study, which {{pertains}} to the public stockyards market located at Omaha and the marketing of hogs produced in Nebraska is: first, to determine the supply area of this market {{in relationship to the}} production of hogs in this state; second, to determine the cost of transportation and marketing; third, to show the relationship of transportation and marketing costs to the price of hogs; fourth, to show the trend in transportation and terminal market costs and the volume of shipments by rail, commercial truck, and “other” or farmer owned truck. The data used in this study were obtained from the John Clay Livestock <b>Commission</b> <b>Company</b> and the Farmers Union Livestock <b>Commission</b> <b>Company</b> of South Omaha, Nebraska. The Information obtained from the John Clay Livestock <b>Commission</b> <b>Company</b> pertained to transactions occurring on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday of each week for the years 1930 to 1935 inclusive. The Farmers Union Livestock <b>Commission</b> <b>Company</b> handles a larger volume of livestock and {{in order to reduce the}} size of the sample transactions occurring on Tuesday and Wednesday were recorded. Uniform charges are made for the services of the Union Stock Yards Company and the various livestock <b>commission</b> <b>companies</b> so there was no need to obtain a representative sample for each <b>commission</b> <b>company</b> for the purpose of making a comparison of services or costs. It was of greater importance to secure a sample representative of all sections of the supply area of this market. Records were obtained on 235, 547 head of hogs consigned from various counties in Nebraska to the Omaha Market. The number of sales was not determined but each record represented on consignment and included the following information: date, point of origin, number of head, total weight, total amount received, each item of expense, and the total expenses. In some instances supplementary information has been obtained from the U. S. Census, Nebraska Agricultural Statistics, and other publications. Although this study covers sales of livestock for every week for a six year period there are definite limitations to the uses that can be made of some of the data. No more than 3 per cent of the total movement of hogs from Nebraska to Omaha was included in the sample for any one year. A larger sample would provide better information on average weights and prices for counties contributing relatively few hogs to this market. Also, weights and prices vary over a wide range and a large number of records is required if reliable results are to be obtained. Advisor: L. F. Gare...|$|R
