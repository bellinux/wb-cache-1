5|$|Oligonucleotides find {{a variety}} of {{applications}} in molecular biology and medicine. They are most commonly used as antisense oligonucleotides, small interfering RNA, primers for DNA sequencing and amplification, probes for detecting <b>complementary</b> <b>DNA</b> or RNA via molecular hybridization, tools for the targeted introduction of mutations and restriction sites, and for the synthesis of artificial genes.|$|E
5|$|Because {{molecular}} diagnostics {{methods can}} detect sensitive markers, these tests are less intrusive than a traditional biopsy. For example, because cell-free nucleic acids exist in human plasma, a simple blood sample can {{be enough to}} sample genetic information from tumours, transplants or an unborn fetus. Many, but not all, molecular diagnostics methods based on nucleic acids detection use polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to vastly {{increase the number of}} nucleic acid molecules, thereby amplifying the target sequence(s) in the patient sample. The detection of the marker might use real time PCR, direct sequencing, or microarray chipsprefabricated chips that test many markers at once. The same principle applies to the proteome and the genome. High-throughput protein arrays can use <b>complementary</b> <b>DNA</b> or antibodies to bind and hence can detect many different proteins in parallel.|$|E

40|$|Establishing a {{reliable}} genotyping protocol {{is a critical}} matter in postsequence genetics. In this article, we describe a highly sensitive electrochemical detection of <b>complementary</b> <b>DNAs</b> (up to 43 -mer) based on hole transport with molecular-scale, “wire-like” DNA probes. The presence of a single-base mismatch in the DNA duplexes caused a dramatic decrease in the electrochemical response. We applied this method to detect all of the possible transition and transversion SNPs and achieved “on–off”-type discrimination of fully <b>complementary</b> <b>DNAs</b> from their SNPs. Furthermore, naturally occurring polymorphisms, “hot spots” from the p 53 gene, could clearly be distinguished from wild type by using our methodology...|$|R
5|$|Cell {{division}} {{is essential for}} an organism to grow, but, when a cell divides, it must replicate the DNA in its genome so that the two daughter cells have the same genetic information as their parent. The double-stranded structure of DNA provides a simple mechanism for DNA replication. Here, the two strands are separated and then each strand's <b>complementary</b> <b>DNA</b> sequence is recreated by an enzyme called DNA polymerase. This enzyme makes the complementary strand by finding the correct base through complementary base pairing and bonding it onto the original strand. As DNA polymerases can only extend a DNA strand in a 5′ to 3′ direction, different mechanisms are used to copy the antiparallel strands of the double helix. In this way, the base on the old strand dictates which base appears on the new strand, and the cell ends up with a perfect copy of its DNA.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} viral capsid enters the cell, an enzyme called reverse {{transcriptase}} liberates the single-stranded (+)RNA genome from the attached viral proteins and copies {{it into a}} <b>complementary</b> <b>DNA</b> (cDNA) molecule. The process of reverse transcription is extremely error-prone, and the resulting mutations may cause drug resistance or allow the virus to evade the body's immune system. The reverse transcriptase also has ribonuclease activity that degrades the viral RNA during the synthesis of cDNA, as well as DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity that creates a sense DNA from the antisense cDNA. Together, the cDNA and its complement form a double-stranded viral DNA that is then transported into the cell nucleus. The integration of the viral DNA into the host cell's genome is carried out by another viral enzyme called integrase.|$|E

40|$|The {{nucleic acid}} {{sequence}} relationship between mouse intracisternal type A-particles and type C and B viruses was examined by reciprocal complementary DNA-RNA hybridization; <b>complementary</b> <b>DNAs</b> prepared from the RNAs of intracisternal A-particles were hybridized with high-molecular-weight RNAs {{from a variety of}} murine tumor viruses, and <b>complementary</b> <b>DNAs</b> representing a variety of RNA tumor virus genomes were hybridized with the high-molecular-weight RNAs from A-particles. The criterion for homology between two types of virus was that the heterologous hybridization reaction occurs over the same RNA concentration range as the homologous reacton. The results of these hybridizations indicate that there are no major sequence homologies between the RNA of intracisternal A-particles and the RNA of representative members of type B and C viruses of Mus musculus...|$|R

25|$|Most {{efficient}} {{methods of}} gene transfer to cartilage have involved ex vivo strategies using chondrocytes or chondroprogenitor cells. Chondrocytes are genetically enhanced by transferring <b>complementary</b> <b>DNA</b> encoding IL-1RA, IGF-1, or matrix break down inhibitors mentioned in Table 1.

25|$|Historically, short protein {{sequences}} (10 to 15 residues) {{determined by}} Edman degradation were back-translated into DNA sequences {{that could be}} used as probes or primers to isolate molecular clones of the corresponding gene or <b>complementary</b> <b>DNA.</b> The sequence of the cloned DNA was then determined and used to deduce the full amino-acid sequence of the protein.|$|E

Sequence {{analyses of the}} <b>complementary</b> <b>DNAs</b> showed a single Val 390 Ala and double Pro 398 Ser/Glu 350 Lys mutations in mutants H and L, respectively. We characterized their hormone-binding, DNA-binding, and dominant negative activities. Mutants H and L did not bind the hormone T 3. Their DNA-binding activities were analyzed using three types of thyroid hormone response elements (TREs) in which the half-site binding motifs are arranged in an everted repeat (Lys), an inverted repeat (Pal), or a direct repeat separated by four nucleotides (DR 4). Compared with wild-type TR� 1 (w-TR� 1), which bound these TREs with different homodimer/monomer ratios, binding of mutant L to the three TREs as homodimers was reduced by � 90 %. However, binding of mutant H to these TREs was more complex...|$|R

25|$|A reverse {{transcriptase}} (RT) is an enzyme {{used to generate}} <b>complementary</b> <b>DNA</b> (cDNA) from an RNA template, a process termed reverse transcription. It is mainly associated with retroviruses. However, non-retroviruses also use RT (for example, the hepatitis B virus, {{a member of the}} Hepadnaviridae, which are dsDNA-RT viruses, while retroviruses are ssRNA viruses). RT inhibitors are widely used as antiretroviral drugs. RT activities are also associated with the replication of chromosome ends (telomerase) and some mobile genetic elements (retrotransposons).|$|E
40|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} (CNTs) {{can be used}} {{to create}} unique fluidic systems for studying ion transport in nanochannels due to their well-defined geometry, atomically smooth and chemically inert surface, and similarity to transmembrane protein pores. Here, we report the reversible molecular gating of ion transport across DNA-functionalized CNT membranes. The diffusive transport rates of ferricyanide ions through membranes, each with an array of aligned transmembrane CNT channels, were monitored. Single-stranded DNA (T 15) gate molecules were covalently linked to CNT channel entrances, and reversible opening and closing of CNT channels were achieved by the addition and removal of <b>complementary</b> <b>DNAs</b> (A 15) with a remarkable open/close flux ratio of > 1000, which is substantially higher than the protein-gated CNT systems reported previously. Furthermore, at least two-orders of magnitude difference in ion fluxes was observed when single base-pair mismatched DNAs were used in place of the <b>complementary</b> <b>DNAs.</b> Comprehensive theoretical analysis is also presented. The experimental results can be explained by steric hindrance, ion partitioning, and electrostatic repulsion at the CNT entrances, as well as the thermodynamics of DNA binding.

40|$|In {{a general}} {{approach}} to identify genes {{important in the}} control of genetic expression during development of Xenopus Iaevis, two <b>complementary</b> <b>DNAs</b> corresponding to two different c-ets- 2 genes were cloned and sequenced. One of these <b>complementary</b> <b>DNAs</b> appears to be almost full length. The two variant genes differ in their overlapping sequences by 87 nucleotide substitutions, leading to 1 7 amino acid modifications in the proteins, 8 of them being conservative. All but one of these changes map outside of the 142 COOH-terminal residues, a region critical for nuclear localization and DNA binding in the ets proteins. Features potentially important for the biological adivity of the gene produds are conserved. Two transcripts (3. 2 and 1. 7 kilobases) with maternal charaderistics are deteded at a constant level from stages Il/Ill of oogenesis to stage 10 of embryogenesis. They later decline to hardly detedable levels at stages 30 - 40. Variable amounts of the same transcripts are observed in many adult tissues. All of these characteristics {{support the idea that}} the ets- 2 gene produds play an important role during embryogenesis, as well as in adult life. Indeed, they ad as ubiquitous transcriptional adivators, as recently demonstrated b...|$|R
40|$|The genomes {{of three}} {{independent}} isolates of feline sarcoma virus (FeSV) were compared by molecular hybridization techniques. Using <b>complementary</b> <b>DNAs</b> prepared from two strains, SM- and ST-FeSV, common complementary DNA'S were selected by sequential hybridization to FeSV and {{feline leukemia virus}} RNAs. These DNAs were shown to be highly related among the three independent sarcoma virus isolates. FeSV-specific <b>complementary</b> <b>DNAs</b> were prepared by selection for hybridization by the homologous FeSV RNA and against hybridization by fline leukemia virus RNA. Sarcoma virus-specific sequences of SM-FeSV were shown to {{differ from those of}} either ST- or GA-FeSV strains, whereas ST-FeSV-specific DNA shared extensive sequence homology with GA-FeSV. By molecular hybridization, each set of FeSV-specific sequences was demonstrated to be present in normal cat cellular DNA in approximately one copy per haploid genome and was conserved throughout Felidae. In contrast, FeSV-common sequences were present in multiple DNA copies and were found only in Mediterranean cats. The present results are consistent with the concept that each FeSV strain has arisen by a mechanism involving recombination between feline leukemia virus and cat cellular DNA sequences, the latter represented within the cat genome in a manner analogous to that of a cellular gene...|$|R
25|$|There {{are three}} {{different}} replication systems {{during the life}} cycle of a retrovirus. First of all, the reverse transcriptase synthesizes viral DNA from viral RNA, and then from newly made <b>complementary</b> <b>DNA</b> strand. The second replication process occurs when host cellular DNA polymerase replicates the integrated viral DNA. Lastly, RNA polymerase II transcribes the proviral DNA into RNA, which will be packed into virions. Therefore, mutation can occur during one or all of these replication steps.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally DNA microarrays use <b>complementary</b> <b>DNA</b> or {{oligonucleotide}} probes {{to analyze}} messenger RNA (mRNA) from genes of interest. Extracted total RNA {{serves as a}} template for <b>complementary</b> <b>DNA</b> (cDNA) that is tagged with fluorescent probes before being allowed to hybridize to the microarray for visualization. For proteases, specific probes for protease genes and their inhibitors {{have been developed to}} view expression patterns on the mRNA transcript level. The two platforms currently available for this purpose come from corporate and academic sources. Affymetrix’s Hu/Mu ProtIn Microarray uses 516 and 456 probe sets to evaluate human and murine proteases, inhibitors, and interactors respectively. CLIP-CHIP™, developed by the Overall Lab, is a complete protease and inhibitor DNA microarray for all 1561 human and murine proteases, non-proteolytic homologues, and their inhibitors. Both of these tools allow comparison of expression patterns between normal and diseased samples and tissues. Unfortunately, as transcript levels often fail to reflect protein expression levels, gene microarrays are limited in representing protein in samples. In addition, proteases recruited from remote sources like nearby tissues are ignored by these DNA based arrays, reiterating the need for protein based methods to confirm the presence and activity of functional enzymes when transcriptome analysis is performed.|$|E
25|$|DNA {{vaccines}} elicit {{the best}} immune response when highly active expression vectors are used. These are plasmids that usually {{consist of a}} strong viral promoter to drive the in vivo transcription and translation of the gene (or <b>complementary</b> <b>DNA)</b> of interest. Intron A may sometimes be included to improve mRNA stability and hence increase protein expression. Plasmids also include a strong polyadenylation/transcriptional termination signal, such as bovine growth hormone or rabbit beta-globulin polyadenylation sequences. Multicistronic vectors are sometimes constructed to express more than one immunogen, or to express an immunogen and an immunostimulatory protein.|$|E

SYBR Green qPCR Mix (D 01010, GeneCopoeia, Rockville, MD, USA) was used for quantitative real-time PCR amplification in a StepOne real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, USA).

25|$|An {{expressed}} sequence tag (EST) is a short {{nucleotide sequence}} generated from a single RNA transcript. RNA is first copied as <b>complementary</b> <b>DNA</b> (cDNA) by a reverse transcriptase enzyme before the resultant cDNA is sequenced. The Sanger method of sequencing was predominant until the advent of high-throughput methods such as sequencing by synthesis (Solexa/Illumina). Because ESTs don't require prior knowledge of the organism from which they come, {{they can also be}} made from mixtures of organisms or environmental samples. Although higher-throughput methods are now used, EST libraries commonly provided sequence information for early microarray designs, for example, a barley GeneChip was designed from 350,000 previously sequenced ESTs.|$|E
25|$|Taq {{polymerase}} lacks a 3' to 5' exonuclease activity. Thus, Taq has no error-proof-reading activity, {{which consists}} of excision of any newly misincorporated nucleotide base from the nascent (i.e., extending) DNA strand that does not match with its opposite base in the <b>complementary</b> <b>DNA</b> strand. The lack in 3' to 5' proofreading of the Taq enzyme results in a high error rate (mutations per nucleotide per cycle) of approximately 1 in 10,000 bases, which affects the fidelity of the PCR, especially if errors occur early in the PCR with low amounts of starting material, causing accumulation of {{a large proportion of}} amplified DNA with incorrect sequence in the final product.|$|E
25|$|Studies of {{individual}} transcripts were being performed several decades before any transcriptomics approaches were available. Libraries of silkmoth mRNAs were collected and converted to <b>complementary</b> <b>DNA</b> (cDNA) for storage using reverse transcriptase {{in the late}} 1970s. In the 1980s, low-throughput Sanger sequencing began {{to be used to}} sequence random individual transcripts from these libraries, called Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs). The Sanger method of sequencing was predominant until the advent of high-throughput methods such as sequencing by synthesis (Solexa/Illumina). ESTs came to prominence during the 1990s as an efficient method to determine the gene content of an organism without sequencing the entire genome. Quantification {{of individual}} transcripts by Northern blotting, nylon membrane arrays, and later Reverse Transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) were also popular, but these methods are laborious and can only capture a tiny subsection of a transcriptome. Consequently, the manner in which a transcriptome as a whole is expressed and regulated remained unknown until higher-throughput techniques were developed.|$|E
