I am to step in, I suppose, as the <b>confidential</b> <b>counsellor</b> on all {{subjects}} of sweet May. I am to preserve her from a youth whose passions are so impetuous and whose principles are so unformed.' ...|$|E
60|$|Lord and Lady Bardolf {{were not}} alone; they were {{accompanied}} by a gentleman who had been staying on a visit at Firebrace, and who, being acquainted with Lord de Mowbray, had paid his respects to the castle in his way to London. This gentleman was the individual who had elevated them to the peerage--Mr Hatton. A considerable intimacy had sprung up {{between him and his}} successful clients. Firebrace was an old place rebuilt in the times of the Tudors, but with something of its more ancient portions remaining, and with a storehouse of muniments that had escaped the civil wars. Hatton revelled in them, and in pursuing his researches, had already made discoveries which might perhaps place the coronet of the earldom of Lovel on the brow of the former champion of the baronetage, who now however never mentioned the Order. Lord de Mowbray was well content to see Mr Hatton, a gentleman in whom he did not repose the less confidence, because his advice given him three years ago, respecting the writ of right and the claim upon his estate had proved so discreet and correct. Acting on that advice Lord de Mowbray had instructed his lawyers to appear to the action without entering into any unnecessary explanation of the merits of his case. He counted on the accuracy of Mr Hatton's judgment, that the claim would not be pursued; and he was right; after some fencing and preliminary manoeuvring, the claim had not been pursued. Lord de Mowbray therefore, always gracious, was disposed to accord a very distinguished reception to his <b>confidential</b> <b>counsellor.</b> He pressed very much his guests to remain with him some days, and though that was not practicable, Mr Hatton promised that he would not leave the neighbourhood without paying another visit to the castle.|$|E
50|$|He {{afterwards}} {{became the}} <b>confidential</b> <b>counsellor</b> of Maurice, Prince of Orange, and afterwards of Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange, in their {{conduct of the}} foreign affairs of the republic. He was sent on special embassies to Venice, Germany and England, and displayed so much diplomatic skill and finesse that Cardinal Richelieu ranked him among the three greatest politicians of his time. He died, aged 69, in The Hague.|$|E
60|$|Upon entrance, Tressilian found himself, {{not without}} a strong {{palpitation}} of heart, {{in the presence of}} Elizabeth, who was walking to and fro in a violent agitation, which she seemed to scorn to conceal, while two or three of her most sage and <b>confidential</b> <b>counsellors</b> exchanged anxious looks with each other, but delayed speaking till her wrath abated. Before the empty chair of state in which she had been seated, and which was half pushed aside by the violence with which she had started from it, knelt Leicester, his arms crossed, and his brows bent on the ground, still and motionless as the effigies upon a sepulchre. Beside him stood the Lord Shrewsbury, then Earl Marshal of England, holding his baton of office. The Earl's sword was unbuckled, and lay before him on the floor.|$|R
50|$|Childline's {{intention}} is to always keep calls <b>confidential.</b> Childline <b>counsellors</b> take action, however the situation, big or small, if they can help. Counsellors do not record calls but write down case notes of calls and sometimes counselling supervisors may also listen in to calls {{to make sure that}} they can help the best they can.|$|R
60|$|In {{this state}} of general rottenness among subjects, and of {{delusion}} and false politics in princes, comes a new experiment. The king of France {{is in the hands}} of the chiefs of the regicide faction,--the Barnaves, Lameths, Fayettes, PÃ©rigords, Duports, Robespierres, Camuses, &c., &c., &c. They who had imprisoned, suspended, and conditionally deposed him are his <b>confidential</b> <b>counsellors.</b> The next desperate of the desperate rebels call themselves the moderate party. They are the chiefs of the first Assembly, who are confederated to support their power during their suspension from the present, and to govern the existent body with as sovereign a sway as they had done the last. They have, for the greater part, succeeded; and they have many advantages towards procuring their success in future. Just before the close of their regular power, they bestowed some appearance of prerogatives on the king, which in their first plans they had refused to him,--particularly the mischievous, and, in his situation, dreadful prerogative of a veto. This prerogative, (which they hold as their bit in the mouth of the National Assembly for the time being,) without the direct assistance of their club, it was impossible for the king to show even the desire of exerting with the smallest effect, or even with safety to his person. However, by playing, through this veto, the Assembly against the king, and the king against the Assembly, they have made themselves masters of both. In this situation, having destroyed the old government by their sedition, they would preserve as much of order as is necessary for the support of their own usurpation.|$|R
5000|$|In 1868, Massaia was at Shewa, {{where he}} worked until 1879, and enjoyed the {{confidence}} of Menelik II of Ethiopia, who made him his <b>confidential</b> <b>counsellor.</b> In the interval the missions of Kaffa and Guera were administered by his coadjutor Bishop Felicissimo Coccino, who died 26 February 1878. In 1879 Negus John of Abyssinia compelled his vassal Menelik to order Bishop Massaia to return to Europe. The bishop had already been banished seven times, and handed over {{the government of the}} vicariate to his coadjutor Bishop Taurin Cahagne, from 14 February 1875 titular Bishop of Adramittium.|$|E

All new students are assigned a Student Leader who assists them over {{the first few weeks}} of their arrival. A Student Counsellor is available to assist with welfare and pastoral care and all discussions are kept <b>confidential.</b> The Student <b>Counsellor</b> is available to meet with students.|$|R
60|$|Having now chosen his {{principal}} instrument and his <b>confidential</b> and sole <b>counsellor,</b> having the country entirely in his hand, and every obstacle that could impede his course swept {{out of the}} arena, {{what does he do}} under these auspicious circumstances? You would imagine, that, in the first place, he would have sent down to the Council at Calcutta a general view of his proceedings, and of their consequences, together with a complete statement of the revenue; that he would have recommended the fittest persons for public trusts, with such other measures as he might judge to be most essential to the interest and honor of his employers. One would have imagined he would have done this, in order that the Council and the Court of Directors might have {{a clear view of the}} whole existing system, before he attempted to make a permanent arrangement for the administration of the country. But, on the contrary, the whole of his proceedings is clandestinely conducted; there is not the slightest communication with the Council upon the business, till he had determined and settled the whole. Thus the Council was placed in a complete dilemma,--either to confirm all his wicked and arbitrary acts, (for such we have proved them to be,) or to derange the whole administration of the country again, and to make another revolution as complete and dreadful as that which he had made.|$|R
60|$|The only {{positive}} evidence on record against Philip is the accusation of one Sausaman, a renegado Indian, whose natural cunning had been quickened by a partial education {{which he had}} received among the settlers. He changed his faith and his allegiance {{two or three times}} with a facility that evinced the looseness of his principles. He had acted for some time as Philip's <b>confidential</b> secretary and <b>counsellor,</b> and had enjoyed his bounty and protection. Finding, however, that the clouds of adversity were gathering round his patron, he abandoned his service and went over to the whites, and in order to gain their favor charged his former benefactor with plotting against their safety. A rigorous investigation took place. Philip and several of his subjects submitted to be examined, but nothing was proved against them. The settlers, however, had now gone too far to retract; they had previously determined that Philip was a dangerous neighbor; they had publicly evinced their distrust, and had done enough to insure his hostility; according, therefore, to the usual mode of reasoning in these cases, his destruction had become necessary to their security. Sausaman, the treacherous informer, was shortly afterwards found dead in a pond, having fallen a victim to the vengeance of his tribe. Three Indians, one of whom was a friend and counsellor of Philip, were apprehended and tried, and on the testimony of one very questionable witness were condemned and executed as murderers.|$|R
