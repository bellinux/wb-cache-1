40|$|<b>Car</b> <b>clubs</b> have {{operated}} {{on a large}} scale only since 1987, when the first scheme began in Switzerland, although prior to that there were several smaller-scale projects. Schemes then spread to Germany, Austria and the Netherlands. More recently, <b>car</b> <b>clubs</b> have been set up in the UK, Denmark, Italy, and Sweden, and in Canada and the USA. These clubs have developed (and are still developing) in a number of ways. Some schemes are community-level schemes with only one or two vehicles, while others are national organisations with many thousands of members. And some schemes are run by volunteers and are non-profit making, while others are commercial ventures run by international companies. Despite such diverse beginnings, {{it is clear that the}} vast majority of schemes face similar problems in becoming established. One major barrier has been the lack of involvement or support from local and national Government. Given the potential benefits of <b>car</b> <b>clubs</b> to deliver environmental and social improvements to communities, this is somewhat surprising. As experience of <b>car</b> <b>clubs</b> spreads, this situation has begun to change and there are signs that Government attitudes across the world are becoming more enthusiastic to the idea of encouraging <b>car</b> <b>clubs.</b> This paper draws on the results of a state-of-the-art review, based on several face-to-face and telephone interviews, email communications, internet sites and existing literature to identify cases where such a change in attitude has occurred, how various levels of Government have translated this into action, and what lessons could be learnt from each example. ...|$|R
