40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{categorical}} framework for bisimulations and unfoldings that unifies the classical approach from Joyal and al. via open maps and unfoldings.

Also, accessibility is preserved by coreflexions. We then design a notion of unfolding, which has good properties in the accessible case: its is a right adjoint and is a universal covering, i. e., initial among the morphisms that have the unique lifting property with respect to path shapes.
