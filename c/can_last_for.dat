5|$|Episodic {{memory is}} the ability to {{remember}} the details of specific events. This sort of memory <b>can</b> <b>last</b> <b>for</b> a lifetime. Much evidence implicates the hippocampus in playing a crucial role: people with severe damage to the hippocampus sometimes show amnesia, that is, inability to form new long-lasting episodic memories.|$|E
5|$|Remnants of many supernovae {{consist of}} a compact object and a rapidly {{expanding}} shock wave of material. This cloud of material sweeps up the surrounding interstellar medium during a free expansion phase, which <b>can</b> <b>last</b> <b>for</b> up to two centuries.

5|$|There are two {{distinct}} local weather phenomena, marked downslope lee winds {{caused by the}} proximity of the Pennines, leading to super geostrophic winds which can reach in excess of 60KT (70mph), most commonly in winter and spring. In the winter the presence of a subsidence inversion between the Pennines and the North York Moors can allow dense, persistent fog to form which <b>can</b> <b>last</b> <b>for</b> several days.|$|E
50|$|The {{design life}} of the bulb is {{approximately}} 60,000 hours. The design {{life of the}} magnetron has been improved by the Germany/England based Plasma International so it <b>can</b> also <b>last</b> <b>for</b> that same period.|$|R

5|$|A cold usually {{begins with}} fatigue, {{a feeling of}} being chilled, sneezing, and a headache, {{followed}} {{in a couple of days}} by a runny nose and cough. Symptoms may begin within sixteen hours of exposure and typically peak two to four days after onset. They usually resolve in seven to ten days, but some <b>can</b> <b>last</b> <b>for</b> up to three weeks. The average duration of cough is eighteen days and in some cases people develop a post-viral cough which can linger after the infection is gone. In children, the cough lasts for more than ten days in 35–40% of cases and continues for more than 25 days in 10%.|$|E
5|$|All {{octopuses}} are venomous, {{but only}} a few species pose a significant threat to humans. Blue-ringed octopuses in the genus Hapalochlaena, which live around Australia and New Guinea, bite humans only if severely provoked, but their venom kills 25% of human victims. Another tropical species, Octopus apollyon, causes severe inflammation that <b>can</b> <b>last</b> <b>for</b> over a month even if treated correctly, and the bite of Octopus rubescens can cause necrosis that lasts longer than one month if untreated, and headaches and weakness persisting for up to a week even if treated.|$|E
5|$|Mollusc {{species can}} also {{represent}} hazards or pests for human activities. The {{bite of the}} blue-ringed octopus is often fatal, and that of Octopus apollyon causes inflammation that <b>can</b> <b>last</b> <b>for</b> over a month. Stings from a few species of large tropical cone shells can also kill, but their sophisticated, though easily produced, venoms have become important tools in neurological research. Schistosomiasis (also known as bilharzia, bilharziosis or snail fever) is transmitted to humans via water snail hosts, and affects about 200million people. Snails and slugs can also be serious agricultural pests, and accidental or deliberate introduction of some snail species into new environments has seriously damaged some ecosystems.|$|E
50|$|The common bronzewing's diet {{primarily}} {{consists of}} seeds and all varieties of vegetables. It searches for food in small groups.

5|$|Much of the {{research}} into the properties of neptunium since then {{has been focused on}} understanding how to confine it as a portion of nuclear waste. Because it has isotopes with very long half-lives, it is of particular concern in the context of designing confinement facilities that <b>can</b> <b>last</b> <b>for</b> thousands of years. It has found some limited uses as a radioactive tracer and a precursor for various nuclear reactions to produce useful plutonium isotopes. However, most of the neptunium that is produced as a reaction byproduct in nuclear power stations {{is considered to be a}} waste product.|$|E
5|$|Warfarin {{decreases}} {{blood clotting}} by blocking an enzyme called vitamin K epoxide reductase that reactivates vitamin K1. Without sufficient active vitamin K1, clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X have decreased clotting ability. The anticlotting protein C and protein S are also inhibited {{but to a}} lesser degree. A few days are required for full effect to occur and these effects <b>can</b> <b>last</b> <b>for</b> up to five days.|$|E
5|$|All of the Links are cleaned twice weekly, with LinkNYC staff {{removing}} vandalism {{and dirt}} from the Links. Each Link has cameras and over 30 vibration sensors to sense if the kiosk {{has been hit}} by an object. A separate set of sensors also detects if the USB ports are tampered with. If either the vibration sensors or the USB port sensors detect tampering, an alert is displayed at LinkNYC headquarters that the specific part of the Link has been affected. All of the Links have a backup battery power supply that <b>can</b> <b>last</b> <b>for</b> up to 24 hours if a long-term power outage were to occur. This is {{because of what happened}} in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy in 2012, which caused power outages citywide, especially to the city's payphones (which were connected to the municipal power supply of New York City).|$|E

50|$|Laser plate {{making is}} a process that {{requires}} the use of a very soft, low quality polymer coated plate. Thus, the standard cycle life that can be expected out of a laser etched plate is quite low (10,000 impressions on the high end). By comparison, a hardened steel plate <b>can</b> easily <b>last</b> <b>for</b> over 1 million impressions.|$|R
5|$|Flow-dominated eruptions are {{long-lived}} {{events that}} build up extensive, compound lava flows. The extent of these flows makes them a major terrain type on Io. In {{this style of}} eruption, magma emerges onto the surface from vents {{on the floor of}} paterae, vents surrounding paterae, or from fissures on the plains, producing inflated, compound lava flows similar to those seen at Kīlauea in Hawaii. Images from the Galileo spacecraft revealed that many of Io's major flows, like those at Prometheus and Amirani, are produced by the build-up of small breakouts of lava on top of older flows. Flow-dominated eruptions differ from explosion-dominated eruptions by their longevity and their lower energy output per unit of time. Lava erupts at a generally steady rate, and flow-dominated eruptions <b>can</b> <b>last</b> <b>for</b> years or decades.|$|E
5|$|In {{cases of}} serious {{poisoning}} the mushroom causes delirium, somewhat similar in effect to anticholinergic poisoning (such as that caused by Datura stramonium), characterised by bouts of marked agitation with confusion, hallucinations, and irritability followed by periods of {{central nervous system}} depression. Seizures and coma may also occur in severe poisonings. Symptoms typically appear after around 30 to 90 minutes and peak within three hours, but certain effects <b>can</b> <b>last</b> <b>for</b> several days. In {{the majority of cases}} recovery is complete within 12 to 24hours. The effect is highly variable between individuals, with similar doses potentially causing quite different reactions. Some people suffering intoxication have exhibited headaches up to ten hours afterwards. Retrograde amnesia and somnolence can result following recovery.|$|E
5|$|Kojima {{designed}} boss {{battles of}} Snake Eater {{to be totally}} different from those in previous Metal Gear games, or any other games. He said that the boss battle with sniper The End best represented free, open gameplay in the game. The battle takes place over a large area of dense jungle, and the player must search extensively for The End, who attacks over long range from an unknown position. This battle of attrition <b>can</b> <b>last</b> <b>for</b> hours, and contrasts with other boss fights in which the enemy is {{right in front of}} the player and in view the whole time. In addition, the player has the ability to both avoid this boss battle altogether by killing The End earlier in the game; or save and quit during the fight, wait a week, and reload the game to find The End having died of old age. Kojima commented that features like this do not appear in other games.|$|E

50|$|While CSWS usually appears {{within the}} first week after brain injury and spontaneously {{resolves}} in 2-4 weeks, it <b>can</b> sometimes <b>last</b> <b>for</b> months or years. In contrast {{to the use of}} fluid restriction to treat SIADH, CSWS is treated by replacing the urinary losses of water and sodium with hydration and sodium replacement. The mineralocorticoid medication fludrocortisone can also improve the low sodium level.|$|R
5|$|The fruit bodies <b>can</b> <b>last</b> <b>for</b> some {{considerable}} time, growing slowly over a month. Mushrooms in subalpine and alpine areas are typically heavy-set {{with a short}} stipe, their growth slower in the cold climate. This latter form is seen at lower altitudes in colder seasons. Smith gave this the name forma rainierensis. Conversely, mushrooms at low altitudes, {{such as in the}} redwood forests, can grow and expand rapidly with large caps that have prominent scales. Smith described a paler form with a solid stipe from the Sierra Nevada as forma wilsonii. American mycologist R. H. Petersen described an olive-capped form that is otherwise identical to the typical form. These forms are not recognised as distinct.|$|E
5|$|Titanium has the {{inherent}} ability to osseointegrate, enabling use in dental implants that <b>can</b> <b>last</b> <b>for</b> over 30 years. This property is also useful for orthopedic implant applications. These benefit from titanium's lower {{modulus of elasticity}} (Young's modulus) to more closely match that of the bone that such devices are intended to repair. As a result, skeletal loads are more evenly shared between bone and implant, leading to a lower incidence of bone degradation due to stress shielding and periprosthetic bone fractures, which occur at the boundaries of orthopedic implants. However, titanium alloys' stiffness is still {{more than twice that}} of bone, so adjacent bone bears a greatly reduced load and may deteriorate.|$|E
5|$|Argentina's geomorphic {{characteristics}} {{make the}} country highly vulnerable to floods. These floods can damage infrastructure, cause loss of life, {{increase the risk of}} diseases, and negatively impact agricultural productivity, {{which is one of the}} main economic activities of the country. Many of the large Argentinean cities and agriculturally productive areas lie near rivers. The plains are at highest risk for flooding, particularly in the northeastern and central parts of the country, including Greater Buenos Aires. This is because these plains, which cover 35% of the land area in the country (including the Chaco and Pampean areas), are characterized by a flat landscape, which can impede proper water drainage. Both the Parana and Paraguay basins have a flat landscape and are thus highly susceptible to flooding due to river overflows following high rainfall. These floods <b>can</b> <b>last</b> <b>for</b> months, particularly in the Parana River, owing to its large basin. In the most extreme case, during the year 1982–1983, the floods in the Parana River persisted for more than a year, negatively impacting the area both socially and economically. Major flooding events in the Parana River include those of 1992 and 1997 and have been more frequent since the 1980s due to higher precipitation trends. Similarly, in Buenos Aires Province, flooding occurs due to river overflows and poor water drainage; major flooding events in the province occurred in 1987, 2002/2003, 2012 and in 2014, causing damage to agriculture production. Most of the flooding events occur in El Niño years owing to higher rainfall. Flooding can also affect Patagonia and urban centers in the northwest, but the number of people affected and economic losses are lower than those in the Pampas owing to lower population densities. Flooding can jeopardize access to safe water. A leptospirosis outbreak occurred following a flood in 1998.|$|E
50|$|A common urban legend {{claims that}} Twinkies have an {{infinite}} shelf life, and <b>can</b> <b>last</b> unspoiled <b>for</b> a relatively long time of ten, fifty, or {{one hundred years}} due to the chemicals used in their production.

5|$|Banksia speciosa is serotinous, that is, it has {{an aerial}} seed bank in its canopy {{in the form of}} the follicles of the old flower spikes. These are opened by fire and release seed in large numbers, which {{germinate}} and grow after rain. Seed <b>can</b> <b>last</b> <b>for</b> many years; old spikes 11 to 12 years old have been found to have 50% viable seed. Flower spikes appear to have similar numbers of follicles regardless of the age of the parent plant. Young plants begin flowering three years after regenerating from bushfire and store progressively larger numbers of old flowerheads (and hence seed) in the canopy. In one study, decade-old plants averaged around 3.5 old cones, whereas 21-year-old plants had 105, and were calculated as having over 900 viable seeds per plant. Plants appear to have a life span of at least 40 years, as healthy and vigorous individuals of this age are known. An experimental burn and monitoring of resultant seedling germination and growth showed B.speciosa seeds, though numerous, had poor rates of establishment but that seedlings were able to access water more easily and had higher rates of survival after two years than co-occurring Banksia species. Though this suggested B.speciosa might outcompete its conspecifics, the authors of the study noted that there could be other factors not accounted for in its natural environment.|$|E
5|$|Both {{independent}} and dependent colony foundation can occur after mating. Isolation by distance (IBD) patterns {{have been recorded}} with M. pilosula queens, where nests that tend to be closer together were more genetically {{related to each other}} in comparison to other nests further away. Independent colony foundation is closely associated with queens which engage in nuptial flight in areas far from their home colony, showing that dependent colony foundation mostly occurs if they mate near their nest. In some cases, queens could seek adoption into alien colonies if there are no suitable areas to find a nest or independent colony foundation cannot be carried out. Other queens could try and return to their home nest after nuptial flight, but they may end up in another nest near the nest they originally came from. In multiple-queen societies, the egg-laying queens are generally unrelated to one another, but one study showed that it is possible for multiple queens in the same colony to be genetically related to each other. Depending on the species, the number of individuals present in a colony can range from 50 to over 2,200 individuals. A colony with less than 100 workers is not considered a mature colony. M. dispar colonies have around 15 to 329 ants, M. nigrocincta have over 1,000, M. pyriformis have from 200 to over 1,400 and M. gulosa have nearly 1,600. A colony <b>can</b> <b>last</b> <b>for</b> a number of years. Foraging behaviour among smaller workers which never usually leave the nest can be a sign of a colony's impending demise.|$|E
