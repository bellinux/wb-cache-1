40|$|The {{placement}} of base station transceivers at {{close proximity to}} one another is a major challenge for RF engineers. In a <b>colocated</b> setting, the base station receivers have to receive weak desired signals {{in the presence of}} high-power transmit/jamming signals from <b>colocated</b> base station transmitters; resulting in major interference issues. The thesis identifies two major mechanism of interference for the <b>colocated</b> victim receiver. First, the strong jamming signals mix within the victim receiver front-end to produce intermodulation products that may fall on its desired receive channel and cause interference. The strong signals may also saturate the receiver circuits and cause desensitization. Second, large jamming signals from one <b>colocated</b> transmitter can radiate into the antenna system of a second <b>colocated</b> transmitter. The signals enter the second transmitter in the reverse direction and mix in the output stage of its power amplifier to produce intermodulation products. These ‘reverse’ intermodulation products get radiated from the antenna system and may fall on the victim receiver’s desired channel...|$|R

30|$|Recently, multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) radar {{has caused}} {{extensive}} concern {{because of its}} better parameter estimation performance compared with phased array radar [1]. Overall, {{there are two types}} of MIMO radar according to the radar configurations: statistical MIMO radar and <b>colocated</b> MIMO radar. The first type, whose antennas are widely separated in both the transmitting and receiving arrays, can achieve high resolution via the spatial diversity gain in multiple channels [2, 3]. The second type, whose antennas are closely located in the transmitting and receiving arrays, can achieve a coherent processing gain [4, 5]. Furthermore, the transmitters and receivers of the monostatic <b>colocated</b> MIMO radar are closely located, which causes the result that the direction of departure (DOD) of a target is the same as the direction of arrival (DOA) of the target. For the bistatic <b>colocated</b> MIMO radar, the transmitters are far from the receivers, which brings about different DOD and DOA. In this paper, we consider the bistatic <b>colocated</b> MIMO radar to study.|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of UTRA-FDD was assessed under multi-operator deployments in an indoor office environment. A {{modified version of}} the proposed 3 GPP picocell scenario was used, with two deployed operators, each having 5 base stations (BS). Two different deployments were investigated: one where the BSs of the different operators were <b>colocated</b> and another where they were not <b>colocated.</b> User terminals (UEs) were uniformly distributed within the office environment. Most terminals generated 12. 2 kbps traffic, but a considerable proportion generated 64 kbps, 144 kbps and 384 kbps traffic. Monte-Carlo type simulations were run to collect performance related data. Results from a single operator (Operator A) deployment were used as baseline for comparison purposes. Analysis of the simulation results showed that, on the uplink, there was virtually {{no significant difference between the}} two alternative deployments as regards the {{performance of}} Operator A. On the downlink, <b>colocated</b> deployment had no significant impact on Operator A, while non <b>colocated</b> deployment compromised the downlink capacity and the coverage of Operator A in the vicinity of Operator B base stations. In addition, Operator B suffered from reduced performance on both uplink and downlink when not <b>colocated</b> with Operator A, due to non ideal positions of its own base stations...|$|R
40|$|Hadoop {{has become}} an {{attractive}} platform for large-scale data analytics. In this paper, we identify a major performance bottleneck of Hadoop: its lack of ability to <b>colocate</b> related data on {{the same set of}} nodes. To overcome this bottleneck, we introduce CoHadoop, a lightweight extension of Hadoop that allows applications to control where data are stored. In contrast to previous approaches, Co-Hadoop retains the flexibility of Hadoop in that it does not require users to convert their data to a certain format (e. g., a relational database or a specific file format). Instead, applications give hints to CoHadoop that some set of files are related and may be processed jointly; CoHadoop then tries to <b>colocate</b> these files for improved efficiency. Our approach is designed such that the strong fault tolerance properties of Hadoop are retained. Colocation can be used to improve the efficiency of many operations, including indexing, grouping, aggregation, columnar storage, joins, and sessionization. We conducted a detailed study of joins and sessionization in the context of log processing—a common use case for Hadoop—, and propose efficient map-only algorithms that exploit colocated data partitions. In our experiments, we observed that CoHadoop outperforms both plain Hadoop and previous work. In particular, our approach not only performs better than repartition-based algorithms, but also outperforms map-only algorithms that do exploit data partitioning but not colocation. 1...|$|E

In this pa-per, we demonstrate that information from low-cost hard-ware performance counters commonly available on mod-ern processors {{is sufficient to}} identify and separate the causes of communication traffic and performance degra-dation. We have developed SAM, a Sharing-Aware Map-per that uses the aggregated coherence and bandwidth event counts to separate traffic caused by data sharing from that due to memory accesses.

40|$|We use the wavelet {{transform}} modulus maxima method {{to investigate the}} multifractal properties of strand-asymmetry DNA walk profiles in the human genome. This study reveals the bifractal nature of these profiles, which involve two competing scale-invariant (up to repeat-masked distances less than or similar to 40 kbp) components characterized by Holder exponents h(1) = 0. 78 and h(2) = 1, respectively. The former corresponds to the long-range-correlated homogeneous fluctuations previously observed in DNA walks generated with structural codings. The latter {{is associated with the}} presence of jumps in the original strand-asymmetry noisy signal S. We show that a majority of upward (downward) jumps <b>colocate</b> with gene transcription start (end) sites. Here 7228 human gene transcription start sites from the refGene database are found within 2 kbp from an upward jump of amplitude Delta S >= 0. 1 which suggests that about 36 % of annotated human genes present significant transcription-induced strand asymmetry and very likely high expression rate.

40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen a {{meteoric}} rise in microprocessor performance. Overall computer system performance, however, has not kept pace with that of its most glamorous component. One key bottleneck in system performance is file system I/O [17]. This paper investigates methods for improving file system performance by reducing or hiding disk latency. These methods monitor file accesses and infer relationships about the accessed files. Based on this continuously updated information, the system makes decisions about how to improve file system performance. Two optimization techniques are examined: reorganizing the disk to <b>colocate</b> related files and prefetching files in anticipation of future requests. An algorithm for selecting files to prefetch based on second-order correlations {{despite the presence of}} noise is presented. Cluster-based disk reorganization was unable to achieve any benefit over traditional block and cylinder shuffling [21, 24, 23, 1]. Our prefetching systems were able to predict files to prefetch with over 50 % accuracy. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractoriLyt,thecis-acting {{element of}} the lytic origin of DNA {{replication}} of Epstein–Barr virus, is activated by the viral transactivator BZLF 1 which belongs to the extended bZIP class of transcription factors. Seven binding sites for BZLF 1, so-called ZRE sites, are located withinoriLyt. By mutational analysis of individual ZRE sites, we found that lytic DNA replication is dependent on only four of these sites which <b>colocate</b> with the promoter of the BHLF 1 gene. The remaining three ZRE sites distal to the BHLF 1 promoter were dispensable for DNA replication and did not contribute to long-range transcriptional activation of this promoter by BZLF 1. This finding indicated that a similar set of ZRE sites is involved in DNA replication and transcriptional activation. To determine the function of BZLF 1 in DNA replication, BZLF 1 mutants with successive deletions in the transactivation domain were analyzed in replication assays. Unexpectedly, most BZLF 1 mutants which failed to support DNA replication {{were found to be}} equally defective in transcriptional activation. Therefore, similartrans-acting domains of BZLF 1 are involved both in replication and in transcription...|$|E
