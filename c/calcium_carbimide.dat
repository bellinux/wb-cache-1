50|$|<b>Calcium</b> <b>carbimide,</b> sold as the citrate salt {{under the}} trade name Temposil, is an alcohol {{sensitizing}} agent. Its effects {{are similar to}} the drug disulfiram (Antabuse) in that it interferes with the normal metabolism of alcohol by preventing the breakdown of the metabolic byproduct acetaldehyde. The result is that when alcohol is consumed by users of <b>calcium</b> <b>carbimide,</b> they experience severe reactions which include symptoms such as sweating, difficulty breathing, rapid heartbeat, rash, nausea and vomiting, and headache.|$|E
40|$|Daidzin is a potent, selective, and {{reversible}} inhibitor {{of human}} mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) that suppresses free-choice ethanol intake by Syrian golden hamsters. Other ALDH inhibitors, such as disulfiram (Antabuse) and <b>calcium</b> citrate <b>carbimide</b> (Temposil), {{have also been}} shown to suppress ethanol intake of laboratory animals and are thought to act by inhibiting the metabolism of acetaldehyde produced from ingested ethanol. To determine whether or not daidzin inhibits acetaldehyde metabolism in vivo, plasma acetaldehyde in daidzin-treated hamsters was measured after the administration of a test dose of ethanol. Daidzin treatment (150 mg/kg per day i. p. for 6 days) significantly suppresses (> 70 %) hamster ethanol intake but does not affect overall acetaldehyde metabolism. In contrast, after administration of the same ethanol dose, plasma acetaldehyde concentration in disulfiram-treated hamsters reaches 0. 9 mM, 70 times higher than that of the control. In vitro, daidzin suppresses hamster liver mitochondria-catalyzed acetaldehyde oxidation very potently with an IC 50 value of 0. 4 microM, which is substantially lower than the daidzin concentration (70 microM) found in the liver mitochondria of daidzin-treated hamsters. These results indicate that (i) the action of daidzin differs from that proposed for the classic, broad-acting ALDH inhibitors (e. g., disulfiram), and (ii) the daidzin-sensitive mitochondrial ALDH is not the one and only enzyme that is essential for acetaldehyde metabolism in golden hamsters...|$|R

The benzodiazepines are the drugs of choice for treating alcohol withdrawal, especially initially, in a high-dose loading technique. The alcohol-sensitizing drugs disulfiram and <b>calcium</b> <b>carbimide</b> may help your patients to maintain abstinence, but full medical assessment of the patient and knowledge of the adverse effects of these drugs is required prior to their use.

40|$|Problem {{drinking}} {{is a serious}} health issue, but often patients whose alcohol consumption places them at risk are not diagnosed by physicians. Case finding is {{an essential component of}} "best practice. " In many cases if given the appropriate advice, counselling and behavioural interventions, problem drinkers can be helped to reduce their use of alcohol and improve functioning in other areas of their lives. Some patients may benefit from more comprehensive therapy including the prescription of disulfiram, <b>calcium</b> <b>carbimide</b> or naltrexone.

40|$|Review of {{the various}} drugs in current {{clinical}} use showed that over 50 of them may cause a purely sensory or mixed sensorimotor neuropathy. These include antimicrobials, such as isoniazid, ethambutol, ethionamide, nitrofurantoin, and metronidazole; antineoplastic agents, particularly vinca alkaloids; cardiovascular drugs, such as perhexiline and hydrallazine; hypnotics and psychotropics, notable methaqualone; antirheumatics, such as gold, indomethacin, and chloroquine; anticonvulsants, particularly phenytoin; and other drugs, including disulfiram, <b>calcium</b> <b>carbimide,</b> and dapsone. Patients receiving drug treatment who complain of paraesthesie, pain, muscle cramps, or other abnormal sensations and those without symptoms who are receiving drugs that are known or suspected to be neurotoxic should undergo neurological examination and studies of motor and sensory nerve conduction. This will allow the incidence of drug-induced peripheral neuropathy to be determined more precisely...|$|E

40|$|The urinary {{excretion}} {{of seven}} aldehydes, acetone, coproporphyrin III and 8 -hydroxy- 2 '-deoxyguanosine (8 -OH-dG) as non-invasive biomarkers of oxidative damage {{was measured in}} rats treated with diquat or N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), two compounds causing hepatic damage by different mechanisms. Furthermore, the effect of co-administration of the aldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitor, <b>calcium</b> <b>carbimide</b> (CC) on the urinary excretion of the aldehydes was determined. Slight hepatotoxicity was found {{at the end of}} the experiment after treatment with NDMA (0. 5, 4 and 8 mg/kg at t = 0, 48 and 96 h, respectively) or diquat (6. 8 and 13. 6 mg/kg at t = 0 and 48 h, respectively). In diquat treated rats slight nephrotoxicity was also found. Urinary excretion of aldehydes, acetone and coproporphyrin III remained largely unchanged in rats treated with NDMA. In the rats treated with diquat, the urinary excretion of several aldehydes was several-fold increased. An increase was also found in the urinary excretion of 8 -OH-dG after the second dose of diquat. Treatment of rats with CC did not significantly influence the urinary excretion of aldehydes in control and NDMA rats. However, in rats treated with diquat, CC caused a potentiating effect on the excretion of acetaldehyde, hexanal and malondialdehyde (MDA), indicating that oxidation of aldehydes to carbonylic acids by aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs) might be an important route of metabolism of aldehydes. In conclusion, increased urinary excretion of various aldehydes, acetone, coproporphyrin III and 8 -OH-dG was observed after administration of diquat, probably reflecting oxidative damage induced by this compound. No such increases were found after NDMA administration, which is consistent with a different toxicity mechanism for NDMA. Therefore, excretion of aldehydes, acetone, coproporphyrin III and 8 -OH-dG might be used as easily accessible urinary biomarkers of free radical damage...|$|E
