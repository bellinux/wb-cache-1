Material and methods. The blood serums from 45 patients with SCCHN (T 1 – 4 N 0 – 3 M 0), 12 patients  with chronic inflammatory laryngeal and hypopharyngeal diseases and 15 heath subjects were examined. The blood analysis was performed using the CAP 1 ELISA kit (Cusabio) on the Biochrom Anthos 2020 Microplate IEA Reader. Results. The serum level of САР 1 was higher by 75 % in patients with SCCHN (Т 1 N 0 M 0) than in patients with <b>chronic</b> hyperplastic <b>laryngitis.</b> Moreover, differences in the serum level of САР 1 were observed between healthy subjects and patients with chronic laryngeal hyperplasia.

40|$|Abstract: Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) {{is widely}} {{associated}} with asthma, <b>chronic</b> cough, and <b>laryngitis.</b> Many {{studies have focused}} on acidic reflux; however, acid {{is just one of many}} factors that can cause pulmonary injury. The discrepancy between the high frequency of GERD in asthmatic patients and the ineffective reflux therapy outcomes in these patients suggests that GERD may cause injury through other mechanisms, such as pepsinogen, pepsin, bile salts, or other components of reflux materials, instead of the acid. Research using appropriate and innovative methodologies to investigate these potential inflammatory agents in patients with GERD is required to determine the underlying factors associated with pulmonary disorders in these patients...|$|R
40|$|Background. Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is {{a chronic}} {{condition}} affecting up to {{one-quarter of the}} Western population. GORD is characterized by heartburn and acid regurgitation, but {{is reported to be}} associated with a spectrum of extra-oesophageal symptoms. Objective. The aim of this systematic review was to critically evaluate postulated extra-oesophageal symptoms of GORD. Methods. Extra-oesophageal symptoms were identified from population-based studies evaluating their association with GORD (either defined as heartburn and/or acid regurgitation, or diagnosed in general practice). The response of these symptoms to acid-suppressive therapy was investigated using randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. Pathogenic mechanisms were evaluated using clinical and preclinical studies. Results. An association between GORD and symptoms or a diagnosis of chest pain/angina, cough, sinusitis and gall-bladder disease was evident from three eligible population-based studies of GORD. Randomized placebo-controlled studies (n = 20) showed that acid-suppressive therapy provides symptomatic relief of chest pain, asthma and, potentially, <b>chronic</b> cough and <b>laryngitis.</b> Mechanistic models, based on direct physical damage by refluxate or vagally mediated reflexes, support a causal role for GORD in chest pain and respiratory symptoms, but not in gall-bladder disease. Conclusion. GORD is likely to play a causal role in chest pain and possibly asthma, <b>chronic</b> cough and <b>laryngitis.</b> Further investigation is desirable, particularly for other potential extra-oesophageal manifestations of GORD such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, sinusitis, bronchitis and otitis. Acid-suppressive therapy is likely to benefit patients with non-cardiac chest pain, but further placebo-controlled studies are needed for other symptoms comprising the extra-oesophageal spectrum of GORD...|$|R
40|$|Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) {{is one of}} the commonest {{diseases}} of Western populations, affecting 20 to 30 % of adults. GERD is multifaceted and the classical oesophageal symptoms such as heartburn and regurgitation often overlap with atypical symptoms that impact upon the respiratory system and airways. This is referred to as extra-oesophageal reflux disease (EERD), or laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR), which manifests as <b>chronic</b> cough, <b>laryngitis,</b> hoarseness, voice disorders and asthma. The 'Reflux and its consequences' conference was held in Hull in 2010 and brought together a multidisciplinary group of experts all with a common interest in the many manifestations of reflux disease to present recent research and clinical progress in GERD and EERD. In particular new techniques for diagnosing reflux were showcased at the conference.

Subsequently, many buildings were swallowed by a landslide which brought with it a large part of the area, reducing the current strip of land we see today. Conseguenzialmente these events there was a need for the development of a new country: its subsequent expansion, in fact, led him to develop the hill to the west, up the slopes of the mountain. Its elongated shape today is crossed by a long straight axis, which some believe is one of the longer courses available throughout the province, bordered by rows of houses almost uninterrupted.

40|$|CONTEXT: Laryngeal {{sensitivity}} {{is important}} in the coordination of swallowing coordination and avoidance of aspiration. OBJECTIVE: To briefly review the physiology of swallowing and report on our experience with laryngeal sensitivity evaluation among patients presenting dysphagia. TYPE OF STUDY: Prospective. SETTING: Endoscopy Department, Hospital Sírio-Libanês. METHODS: Clinical data, endoscopic findings from the larynx and the laryngeal sensitivity, as assessed via the Flexible Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing with Sensory Testing (FEESST) protocol (using the Pentax AP 4000 system), were prospectively studied. The chi-squared and Student t tests were used to compare differences, which were considered significant if p < or = 0. 05. RESULTS: The study included 111 patients. A direct association was observed for hyperplasia and hyperemia of the posterior commissure region in relation to globus (p = 0. 01) and regurgitation (p = 0. 04). Hyperemia of the posterior commissure region had a direct association with sialorrhea (p = 0. 03) and an inverse association with xerostomia (p = 0. 03). There was a direct association between severe laryngeal sensitivity deficit and previous radiotherapy {{of the head and neck}} (p = 0. 001).

40|$|Gastro-oesophageal reflux {{disease is}} a {{condition}} in which the reflux of gastric contents into the oesophagus provokes symptoms or complications and impairs quality of life. Typical symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease are heartburn and regurgitation but gastro-oesophageal reflux disease has also been related to extra-oesophageal manifestations, such as asthma, <b>chronic</b> cough and <b>laryngitis.</b> The pathogenesis of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease is multifactorial, involving transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxations and other lower oesophageal sphincter pressure abnormalities. As a result, reflux of acid, bile, pepsin and pancreatic enzymes occurs, leading to oesophageal mucosal injury. Other factors contributing to the pathophysiology of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease include hiatal hernia, impaired oesophageal clearance, delayed gastric emptying and impaired mucosal defensive factors. Hiatal hernia contributes to gastro-oesophageal reflux disease by promoting lower oesophageal sphincter dysfunction. Impaired oesophageal clearance is responsible for prolonged acid exposure of the mucosa. Delayed gastric emptying, resulting in gastric distension, can significantly increase the rate of transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxations, contributing to postprandial gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. The mucosal defensive factors play an important role against development of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, by neutralizing the backdiffusion of hydrogen ion into the oesophageal tissue. While the pathogenesis of oesophageal symptoms is now well known, the mechanisms underlying extra-oesophageal airway manifestations are still poorly understood. Two hypotheses have been proposed: direct contact of gastric acid with the upper airway and a vago-vagal reflex elicited by acidification of the distal oesophagus, leading to bronchospasm. In conclusion, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease can be considered {{as the result of a}} complex interplay of factors, all promoting the contact of gastric acidic contents with the oesophageal mucosa, leading to different degrees of oesophageal damage...|$|R
40|$|Plants {{and their}} exudates are used {{worldwide}} {{for the treatment}} of several diseases and novel drugs continue to be developed through phytochemical research. There are more than 20, 000 species of high vegetables, used in traditional medicines that are sources of potential new drugs. Following the modern medicine and drug research advancing, chemically synthesized drugs have replaced plants as the source of most medicinal agents in industrialized countries. However, in developing countries, the majority of the world’s population cannot afford pharmaceutical drugs and use their own plant based indigenous medicines. Several exudates from plants are well-known in folk medicine since ancient time, and they are today employed also for practical uses. Dragon’s blood is a deep red resin, which {{has been used as a}} famous traditional medicine since ancient times by many cultures. Dragon's blood is a non-specific name for red resinous exudations from quite different plant species endemic to various regions around the globe that belong to the genera Dracaena (Africa) and Daemonorops (South-East Asia), more rarely also to the genera Pterocarpus and Croton (both South America). Dracaena draco L. is known as the dragon’s blood tree, and it’s endemic to the Canary Islands and Morocco. Phytochemical studies of resins obtained from incisions of the trunk of D. draco, have led to the isolation of flavans, along with homoisoflavans, homoisoflavones, chalcones and dihydrochalcones. Dragon’s blood has been used for diverse medical applications in folk medicine and artistic uses. It has astringent effect and has been used as a hemostatic and antidiarrhetic drug. Frankincense, also known as Olibanum, is an old-known oleogum resin obtained from the bark of trees belonging to the genera Boswellia. There are 43 different reported species in India, Arabian Peninsula and North Africa. The importance of these plants is related to the use of extracts and essential oils of resin in traditional medicine like Ayurvedic and Chinese. Extracts from B. serrata resin are currently used in India {{for the treatment of}} rheumatic diseases and ulcerative colitis. Furthermore, extracts and essential oils of frankincense have been used as antiseptic agents in mouthwash, in the treatment of cough and asthma and as a fixative in perfumes, soaps, creams, lotions and detergents. In ancient Egypt the resin was used in mummification balms and unguents. Today frankincense is one of the most commonly used resins in aromatherapy. The biological activity of frankincense resins is due to the pentacyclic triterpenic acids, α- and β- boswellic acids and their derivatives, which showed a well documented anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities. Manna is an exudate from the bark of Fraxinus trees (Oleaceae). Originally it was only collected from trees with damaged bark, but later in southern Italy and northern Sicily plantations were established for manna production, in which the bark is intentionally damaged for exudation and collection of manna. In July-August a vertical series of oblique incisions are made in the bark on alternate sides of the trunk. A glutinous liquid exudes from this cut, hardens as it oxidises in the air into a yellowish crystalline mass with a bittersweet taste, and is then harvested. Manna is still produced in Sicily, mainly in the Castelbuono and Pollina areas, from Fraxinus ornus and Fraxinus angustifolia trees. The main component of manna is mannitol; it also contains glucose, fructose, maltotriose, mannotetrose, minerals and some unknown constituents. Manna is a mild laxative and an excellent purgative, it is suitable in cases of digestive problems, in atonic or spastic constipation. It’s useful as expectorant, fluidifier, emollient and sedative in coughs; as a decongestant in <b>chronic</b> bronchitis, <b>laryngitis</b> and tonsillitis; in hypertonic solutions it acts as a dehydrating agent in the treatment of wounds and ulcers. It can be used as a sweetener in cases of diabetes as it does not affect glycemia levels or cause glycosuria; in addition it is also a cholagogue as it promotes the flow of the contents of the gall bladder and bile ducts and so stimulates bile production...|$|R
40|$|Different {{grades of}} {{epithelial}} hyperplastic lesions {{can be found}} in various pathological entities, e. g. <b>chronic</b> <b>laryngitis,</b> polyps, nodules, Renike’s edema, papillomas, and cysts. Among all these entities, atypical hypeplasia or risky epithelium occurs most frequently in chronic hyperplastic laryngitis. Malignant transformation develops almost exclusively in this type of aberration. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the main ethiologic agents and to evaluate the frequency of histomorphlogic epithelial changes, the male – female ratio, age and sex distribution of patients with a diagnosis of <b>chronic</b> <b>laryngitis</b> from the Ljubljana region treated in the period from 1994 to 1998 at the Department Otorhinolaryngology and Cervicofacial Surgery, Clinical Centre, Ljubljana. A retrospective clinical pathological analysis was performed on a series of 178 patients with 239 biopsies. The laryngeal biopsies were classified according to the Ljubljana classification. According to the degree of epithelial lesions, a histologic diagnosis of atypical hyperplasia (risky epithelium) was established in 8. 1 % of cases. The patients’ ages ranged from 21 to 89 years. The highest frequency of <b>chronic</b> <b>laryngitis</b> was in females between 40 and 49, and in male patients between 50 and 59 years. The male – female ratio was 8 : 1. We found that 79 % of patients diagnosed with <b>chronic</b> <b>laryngitis</b> were smokers and 31 % alcoholics. Nearly half (48 %) of patients were employed in industry. There is a need for long term follow-up observation to obtain a reliable percentage of malignant transformations in atypical hyperplasia in our series. Cognition that atypical hyperplasia may transform into cancer requires that increasing attention is paid to early detection and adequate treatment. </p...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{uncontrolled}} studies {{suggested a}} therapeutic benefit for treating gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) among patients with laryngitis. The {{present study is}} the first randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study of gastric acid suppression among patients with laryngitis in the United States. Methods : Patients diagnosed with idiopathic <b>chronic</b> <b>laryngitis</b> were randomized to receive either lansoprazole 30 mg p. o. b. i. d. or a matching placebo for 3 months. Before randomization, all patients underwent upper endoscopy, dual probe ambulatory 24 -h esophageal pH-metry, and laryngoscopy, as well as completing a symptom questionnaire for GERD and laryngitis. The primary outcome of treatment was the complete resolution of laryngeal symptoms. Results : A total of 22 patients with symptoms and signs of <b>chronic</b> <b>laryngitis</b> were enrolled, 20 of whom completed the study. At baseline, {{there were no significant}} differences between the two groups with regards to GERD symptoms, erosive esophagitis, proximal and distal esophageal pH-metry, or laryngeal signs and symptoms. In an intention-to-treat analysis, six patients in the lansoprazole group (50 %) and only one patient (10 %) in the placebo group achieved a complete symptomatic response, p =; 0. 04. Apart from receiving lansoprazole, {{there were no significant differences}} between responders and nonresponders in any of baseline esophageal or laryngeal signs and symptoms. Conclusions : Empirical treatment with lansoprazole is efficacious in relieving symptoms of laryngitis compared to placebo. Such treatment can be considered as a first-line option in managing patients with idiopathic <b>chronic</b> <b>laryngitis...</b>|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} ten years or so {{radiology}} has shown dramatic technological developments especially in cross sectional imaging and the investigation and management of the complex ENT patient has benefitted enormously. Plain radiographs are being utilised less and less as their limitations are becoming more apparent and various studies have shown for example a 75 % discrepancy between plain sinus radiographs and coronal sinus CT in children 1, 2. The incorporation of small and flexible ultrasound transducers with high-resolution imaging into the tips of endoluminal catheters has allowed good quality endoluminal ultrasound. Recently endolaryngeal ultrasound has been clinically evaluated in 38 patients with a variety of laryngeal pathology including vocal fold polyps, laryngeal cysts, <b>chronic</b> <b>laryngitis,</b> epithelial dysplasia and cancer 5. Using this technique tumour size and infiltration could be measured and involvement of the thyroid cartilage or anterior commissure could be visualised. Not surprisingly it was not able to detect any specific changes in the sonographic picture of patients suffering from <b>chronic</b> <b>laryngitis,</b> epithelial dysplasia or microinvasive cancer. Although these results are encouraging, its relative lack of availability will result in it only having a limited role in evaluating laryngeal pathology...|$|E
40|$|The {{laryngeal}} mucosa of 195 {{workers in}} an asbestos cement factory (Salonit Anhovo, Yugoslavia) {{and in a}} control group was examined. The factory manufactures asbestos cement products containing about 13 % of asbestos (8 % amosite, 12 % crocidolite, and 80 % chrysotile) of different provenance. Alterations in the laryngeal mucosa were more frequent in the factory workers than in the control group. The changes, mostly consistent with <b>chronic</b> <b>laryngitis,</b> were {{closely related to the}} degree of workplace pollution and less so to the duration of employment Ten workers exhibiting the most severe clinical changes underwent biopsy, the results of which showed histomorphological changes characteristic of hyperplastic <b>chronic</b> <b>laryngitis.</b> Four tissue specimens were examined also by scanning electron microscopy and in three of them asbestos fibres were found on the epithelial surface.
