40|$|To enable {{load-carrying}} in {{two directions}} in lattice girder systems, transverse reinforcement in the precast concrete panels needs to be complemented with lapped reinforcement across the joints at the construction site. To ease production, it would be beneficial {{not to have any}} reinforcement across the <b>cast</b> <b>joint</b> between the precast concrete and the in situ cast concrete within the splice region. However, this raises questions whether the <b>cast</b> <b>joint</b> will manage to transfer the needed forces. This was studied in the present project. Two different surface treatments of the precast elements were studied: one was brushed and the other had single grooves. In the studied detailing of the joint, a reinforcement mesh was placed in the in situ concrete across the joint, directly {{on the surface of the}} precast elements between the lattice girder trusses. Two types of detail tests of the <b>cast</b> <b>joint</b> were carried out: one type where the <b>cast</b> <b>joint</b> was loaded in shear and one in tension. Furthermore, the detailing of the joint between two precast concrete panels was tested in bending in full-scale tests. The detail tests were used to calibrate a model of the <b>cast</b> <b>joint,</b> which was then used in non-linear finite element analyses of the full-scale tests. The test specimens with surfaces with single grooves showed a large scatter in the detail tests loaded in shear; in all other tests the scatter was relatively low. Furthermore, the capacity of the <b>cast</b> <b>joint</b> was markedly higher for the brushed surface than for the surface with single grooves. In the full-scale tests, the joints were strong enough to carry the applied load. In all full-scale tests the failure mode was rupture of the reinforcement, and only one crack occurred: in the in situ cast concrete above the joint between the precast elements. However, the finite element analyses of the full-scale tests revealed that the detailing was sensitive for secondary cracking; when restraints from the cross-bars of the reinforcement mesh initiated bending cracks, the failure mode changed to fracture of the <b>cast</b> <b>joint</b> in the analyses. This happened in the analyses where the precast surface was modelled with single grooves. In the analysis where the surface was modelled as brushed, no secondary cracking occurred even when the restraints from the crossbars were included in the analyses. It is worth to note that in the full-scale tests, the cross-bars were placed directly on the surface of the precast concrete; accordingly they were most likely not so well encased and did not cause any larger restraints. Measurements of the strains in the reinforcement support this. Analyses of whole slabs were carried out to investigate the demands of the deformation capacity of the lattice girder joint. They showed that the load-carrying capacity of a slab depends on the rotation capacity of the lattice girder joints. Therefore, it is recommended that the rotation capacity is not limited by the horizontal <b>cast</b> <b>joint.</b> From the results in this study, it was concluded that the studied detailing of load-carrying joints between lattice girder slabs without any reinforcement across the <b>cast</b> <b>joint</b> is very sensitive to the roughness of the surface of the prefabricated elements. There is a risk of brittle failures; thus it raises questions whether reinforcement across the <b>cast</b> <b>joint</b> is needed to guarantee the structural integrity of a structure. It is further concluded that not all surfaces of the prefabricated elements used in Sweden today can be used. Considering this, it might however still be possible to use the studied detailing for load-carrying purposes. Very important demands are then that both the production of the surface of the prefabricated elements and the conditions at the work site must be controlled and checked on regular basis. Long-term effects such as shrinkage and creep were not included in the present study. This needs to be investigated. Furthermore, it is recommended that detailings with reinforcement across the <b>cast</b> <b>joint</b> are investigated, as the structure would become a lot more robust if that is included...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} provide {{scientific}} basis for design and application of <b>cast</b> steel <b>joint,</b> this paper researches on mechanical properties of tubular-plate combined <b>cast</b> steel <b>joint</b> and tubular <b>cast</b> steel <b>joint,</b> which work in International Expo Center in the most unfavorable load condition. Finite Element Method (FEM) is employed to analysis the mechanical properties of the complex <b>cast</b> steel <b>joint</b> and an optimize solution is given.

The results show that, force transmission path of combined <b>cast</b> steel <b>joint</b> is complex for its cross-section shape of branch changes much; stress concentration is very obvious on the branch. In contrast, the force transmission path of tubular <b>cast</b> steel <b>joint</b> is clear and concise; the phenomenon of stress concentration alleviated effectively, the efficiency of material improved greatly; in {{the same amount of}} material, the ultimate bearing capacity of tubular <b>cast</b> steel <b>joint</b> increased by 9. 5 %.

This paper presents an equilibrium element representing in-situ <b>cast</b> <b>joints</b> and an advanced submodel yield criterion is developed.

40|$|To enable {{load-carrying}} in {{two directions}} in lattice girder systems, transverse reinforcement is needed. In the present study, the possibility to put transverse reinforcement in the precast concrete panels and complement with lapped reinforcement across the joints at the construction site was studied. The behaviour of such a joint, when subjected to bending, was investigated in two-dimensional finite element analyses. The analyses show that the <b>cast</b> <b>joint</b> between the precast concrete and the in-situ cast concrete is the weak link in this detailing, as could be expected. In the analyses where a rather large amount of transverse reinforcement was used, ø 8 s 150 NPs 700, the joint could be loaded close to yielding of the reinforcement; then opening of the <b>cast</b> <b>joint</b> occurred {{in all of the}} analyses. When no bent reinforcement, crossing the <b>cast</b> <b>joint,</b> is present, the failure mode will most likely become brittle. It is therefore recommended to have bent reinforcement crossing the <b>cast</b> <b>joint.</b> Two analyses were carried out with two different placement of bent reinforcement, ø 8 s 150 B 500 B in both cases. When the bent reinforcement was placed close to the joint, it obtained large stresses rather early in the analysis, and the analysis became unstable for rather low rotations. When the bent reinforcement was placed further away from the joint, the transverse reinforcement reached yielding, and the deformation capacity was approximately doubled compared to the other analyses. For small amounts of transverse reinforcement, or reinforcement with a lower yield strength, {{it might be possible to}} use the studied detailing even without bent reinforcement crossing the joint. In one analysis where the transverse reinforcement had a reduced yield strength, 500 MPa instead of 700 MPa, the reinforcement reached yielding, and it was possible to keep the yielding moment some additional rotation before the joint opened up. The modelling of the <b>cast</b> <b>joint</b> is of very large importance for the results of the analyses. The modelling of that was checked through analyses of joints between precast and in-situ concrete tested by Nissen et al. (1986), who made a large experimental investigation on the interaction between precast and in-situ concrete. Still some uncertainty about the input parameters remain. Furthermore, long term effects such as shrinkage and creep were not included in these analyses. It is recommended to do further studies, including full-scale testing of lap splices before this detailing is used in practice...|$|E
40|$|An {{effective}} application of Very High Strength Steel (VHSS) in civil engineering structures {{is expected in}} stiff, truss like structures, typically made of Circular Hollow Sections (CHS). Use of castings in combination with CHS could be promising {{for the design of}} highly fatigue resistant joints. Cast steel and CHS are more and more applied in fatigue loaded bridge and offshore structures. Choosing optimal shapes of the cast steel parts could result in joints with low stress concentration, while shifting welds out of the most severe stress location. The welded connection in between the cast steel part and the CHS are of great importance for the fatigue strength of the joint. The fatigue strength of the welded connections and the cast joints are to be investigated. Two truss girders, made of welded CHS and K-joint cast members with yield strength of 690 MPa and 890 MPa, are tested under static and fatigue loading conditions at the Stevin Laboratory of the Delft University of Technology. The test frame consists of a 10, 000 kN cylinder, pull bars and H-girders. Strain gauges are used to monitor the strain distribution and the cycles until crack initiation.

40|$|Through {{the use of}} {{a general}} {{empirical}} model for the density of states functions, one that considers valence band band, valence band tail, conduction band band, and conduction band tail electronic states, the sensitivity of the joint density of states function to variations in the conduction band tail breadth, all other parameters being held fixed at nominal hydrogenated amorphous silicon values, is examined. It is found that when the conduction band tail is narrower than the valence band tail, its role in shaping the corresponding spectral dependence of the joint density of states function is relatively minor. This justifies {{the use of a}} simplified empirical model for the density of states functions that neglects the presence of the conduction band tail states inthe characterization of the optical response. A simplification of such an empirical model for the density of state functions associated with hydrogenated amorphous silicon is then suggested, reducing the number of independent modeling parameters from six to five as a result. As a consequence of this simplification, it is found that one is able to <b>cast</b> <b>joint</b> density of states evaluations into a dimensionless formalism, this formalism providing an elementary and effective platform for the determination of the underlying modeling parameters from experiment. This simplification is justified by showing, for reasonable hydrogenated amorphous silicon modeling parameter selections, that the joint density of states results are very similar to those determined using a more general approach. Using our dimensionless joint density of states formalism for the quantitative characterization of the optical response associated with hydrogenated amorphous silicon, a critical comparative analysis {{of a large number of}} different optical absorption data sets is then considered. When these data sets are cast into this dimensionless framework, a trend is observed that is almost completely coincident for all of the data sets considered. This suggests that there is a universal character associated with the optical absorption spectrum of hydrogenated amorphous silicon. Finally, the role that defect states play in shaping the optical response of this material are probed...|$|E
40|$|Although Very High Strength Steels (VHSS) with nominal {{strengths}} up to 1100 MPa {{have been}} available {{on the market for}} many years, the use of these steels in the civil engineering industry is still uncommon. The main objective of the research is the determination of the fatigue strength of welded connections made of VHSS. The research comprised of a literature study, an experimental study and an analysis of the results. An effective application of VHSS is expected in truss-like structures, typically made of hollow sections. Truss structures enable full exploitation of the high material strength of VHSS, because in such stiff structures the deflection is not the governing the design criterion. Improved design of VHSS truss structures should incorporate the application of very high strength <b>cast</b> <b>joints,</b> as an appropriate design of <b>cast</b> <b>joints</b> limits the stress concentrations in the joint. The fatigue strength of <b>cast</b> <b>joints</b> will therefore be relatively high compared to that of regular steel welded joints, as the stress concentration of the connection is limited and welds are shifted out of critical zones. Three types of specimens were fatigue tested in the study: specimens of base material, of welded plates and of trusses made of circular hollow sections (CHS) and <b>cast</b> <b>joints.</b> Plate test specimens were derived from base material of rolled steel and welded cast and rolled plates. The main conclusion of the research is that higher yield strength increases crack initiation life of base material and welded connections in case of low notch stress concentration and small initial imperfections.

The findings of numerical studies are provided with the account for the variable value of the linear expansion coefficient of the concrete exposed to negative temperatures. Specialized contact methods in finite elements simulations were employed to simulate the <b>casting</b> <b>joints,</b> with the monolith height being equal to 1. 5 m, {{to take account of}} the non-linear shear strain of joints and their opening.

However no effect was produced by the change in the α value onto the strain state of the dam face. Besides, the rock-to-concrete contact depth and width increased. Although, given the small value of the aforementioned increase (decimal points of a millimeter), it will produce no effect on the filtration underway within the bedrock base of the dam.

40|$|The {{scope of}} this paper is the shear {{capacity}} of in-situ <b>cast</b> <b>joints</b> between precast concrete panels. Current practice with vertical lowering of the wall panels experiences difficulties in the assembly phase, since the traditional U-bar connection requires an overlap in a horizontal plane to allow for the mounting of a vertical locking bar. Where limited space is available bending and subsequent straightening of the U-bars are required to assemble the adjacent panels, a procedure which imposes substantial ductility requirements on the reinforcement as well as some manual workload. This paper introduces a construction-friendly design with U-bars overlapping in the same plane as the panel itself. The design allows for a trouble-free vertical lowering of the panels without pre or post processing of the preinstalled reinforcement loops. Furthermore, an overall more ductile behavior of the joint is obtained. The solution is tested in a push-off experimental setup and the influence of important geometric parameters of the keyed shear joint is investigated.
