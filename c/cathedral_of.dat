5|$|In 1093 a Benedictine abbey was {{established}} {{on the site}} by Hugh Lupus, Earl of Chester, {{with the assistance of}} StAnselm and other monks from Bec in Normandy. The earliest surviving parts of the structure date from that time. The abbey church was not at that time the <b>cathedral</b> <b>of</b> Chester; from 1075 to 1082 the <b>cathedral</b> <b>of</b> the diocese was the nearby church of StJohn the Baptist, after which the see was transferred to Coventry. In 1538, during the dissolution of the monasteries, the monastery was disbanded and the shrine of SaintWerburgh was desecrated. In 1541 StWerburgh's abbey became a <b>cathedral</b> <b>of</b> the Church of England, by order of HenryVIII. At the same time, the dedication was changed to Christ and the Blessed Virgin. The last abbot of StWerburgh’s Abbey, Thomas Clarke, became the first dean of the new cathedral, {{at the head of a}} secular chapter.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to recruiting in battle, new demons are acquired through fusion {{at a location}} called the <b>Cathedral</b> <b>of</b> Shadows. Normally only two demons can be fused at once, but under certain conditions more demons can be fused together. Fusions can produce a variety of results based on various circumstances, such as the current phase of Kagutsuchi {{and the addition of}} items called Deathstones. When in the <b>Cathedral</b> <b>of</b> Shadows, the Protagonist can select two demons, viewing a preview of the resultant demon, then initiate a fusion. The resultant demon will both possess its own skills and inherit skills from its two parents: skill inheritance is randomized. Higher-level demons produce more powerful fusions. Demons gained through negotiation or fusion are automatically stored in the Demon Compendium, a record kept within the <b>Cathedral</b> <b>of</b> Shadows. The Protagonist can also pay to summon a demon from the Compendium, returning it to his ranks.|$|E

5|$|Portsmouth has two cathedrals: the Anglican <b>Cathedral</b> <b>of</b> St Thomas in Old Portsmouth, and the Roman Catholic <b>Cathedral</b> <b>of</b> St John the Evangelist (the city {{is one of}} 34 British {{settlements}} with a Roman Catholic cathedral). The city's first chapel, {{dedicated to}} Thomas Becket, was built by Jean deGisors {{in the second half}} of the 12th century. The chapel was rebuilt and developed into the parish church and then Anglican cathedral. It was damaged during the Siege of Portsmouth in 1642, but after the restoration of the monarchy the tower and nave were rebuilt. Significant changes were made when the Diocese of Portsmouth was established in 1927. It became a cathedral in 1932, and was enlarged, although construction was halted during the Second World War. The cathedral was re-consecrated in the presence of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother in 1991.|$|E
