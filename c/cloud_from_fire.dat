50|$|On June 26, 2012, Colorado Springs {{experienced}} {{a record high}} temperature of , which aided the fire's rapid expansion through Queen's Canyon and creating significant smoke. The fire crested Queen's Canyon and winds from the west nearing 65 mph gusts (the cyclonic winds of the collapsing pyrocumulus <b>cloud</b> <b>from</b> the <b>fire</b> storm) pushed the fire down the slope and into the Mountain Shadows, Oak Valley Ranch, and Peregrine neighborhoods. The fire moved about 2 miles per hour towards the city. Embers were carried by the wind to a distance of up to a quarter mile away and caused multiple small spot fires of brush and low vegetation. Once the fire crossed into neighborhoods, the fuel for the fire was houses, and the fire spread house-to-house.|$|R

50|$|Prolonging Michael {{with the}} drive west delayed and {{weakened}} {{the attack in}} Flanders. Again they broke through, smashing the Portuguese defenders and forcing the British {{from all of the}} ground they had paid so dearly for in 1917. However French support enabled the British to save Hazebrouck, the rail junction that was the German goal. To draw the French reserves away from Flanders, the next attack was along the Aisne River where Nivelle had attacked the year before. Their success was dazzling. The defender's front was immersed in a gas <b>cloud</b> <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> simple mortars, within hours they had reoccupied all the ground the French had taken by weeks of grinding, and they continued to sweep south through Champagne until they halted for resupply at the Marne River.|$|R
30|$|The {{number of}} strokes per {{positive}} strike did not vary {{much over the}} months of the year. Negative strikes showed more variation with the highest number in July (1.94) and the lowest in January (1.31). Similar results were reported by Orville and Huffines (1999), although they recorded mean values exceeding three strokes per strike for areas of Georgia. In California, {{there was an increase}} in negative return strokes from the coast to the mountains. Orville and Huffines (1999) found continental increases from the Southeast to the Northwest and from Maine to Florida. They speculated that the variation in the number of negative return strokes was related to cumulus <b>cloud</b> size. <b>From</b> a <b>fire</b> ignition standpoint, a higher number of return strokes for negative strikes is important because {{it has been shown that}} negative strikes with more than one return stroke are more likely to have long continuing currents (Rakov and Uman 1990).|$|R
50|$|Meteorological {{satellites}} {{see more}} than clouds and cloud systems. City lights, fires, effects of pollution, auroras, sand and dust storms, snow cover, ice mapping, boundaries of ocean currents, energy flows, etc. Other types of environmental information are collected using weather satellites. Weather satellite images helped in monitoring the volcanic ash <b>cloud</b> <b>from</b> Mount St. Helens and activity from other volcanoes such as Mount Etna. Smoke <b>from</b> <b>fires</b> in the western United States such as Colorado and Utah have also been monitored.|$|R
40|$|In four {{different}} cases of extensive forest fire smoke the surface temperature ffects were determined under the smoke cloud. In all cases, daytime cooling and no nighttime effects were found. The locations of smoke <b>clouds</b> <b>from</b> extensive forest <b>fires</b> in western Canada in 1981 and 1982, in northern China and Siberia in 1987, and in Yellowstone National Park in northwestern Wyoming in 1988 were determined from satellite imagery. As these smoke clouds {{passed over the}} midwestern United States for the Canadian and Yellow-stone fires and over Alaska for the Chinese/Siberian fires, surface air temperature ffects were determined by comparing actual surface air temperatures with those forecast by model output statistics (MOS) of the United States National Weather Service. MOS error fields corresponding to the smoke cloud locations showed day-time cooling of 1. 5 ø to 7 ø(2 under the smoke but no nighttime ffects. These results correspond to theoretical estimates {{of the effects of}} smoke, and they serve as observational confirmation of a portion of the nuclear winter theory. This also implies that smoke from biomass burning can have a daytime cooling effect of a few degrees over seasonal time scales. In order to properly simulate the present climate with a numerical cli-mate model in regions of regular burning {{it may be necessary to}} include this smoke effect. 1...|$|R
50|$|The largest protest {{thus far}} was on 3 December 2012 when about 20,000 people {{reportedly}} gathered in Maribor squares. Again starting at 16:30 CET the protest started peacefully and continued this way until the demonstrators moved from Liberty square {{to the nearby}} Rudolf Maister square {{and in front of}} the Municipal building. There the protesters where throwing rocks and pyrotechnics into the building. At about 19:00 CET the violence escalated after the use of force by the police officers who clashed with the protesters and arrested some of them. The police then secured the entrance to the building, however, they were soon pushed back after the protesters charged into them and returned to their previous position. Shortly thereafter, a police helicopter began overflying the area and soon found itself under fire by some of the protesters, who targeted it with rockets. Similar to the protest on 26 November, the fighting between the police and the protesters then spread across the city centre and continued for several hours, with tear gas circulating through the air after another extensive use. The gas was mixed with <b>clouds</b> of smoke <b>from</b> <b>fires,</b> alight by some of the protesters. A day after the protest Aleksander Ogrizek, President of the Union of Professional Firefighetrs, stated that the Maribor fire department had 25 interventions during four hours, some of which were life-threatening for the firefighters involved in putting out the fires. He has also stated that the scenes reminded him of Beirut.|$|R
