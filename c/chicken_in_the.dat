40|$|The {{objectives}} were {{to identify the}} species of chewing lice (Mallophaga) at different body sites <b>in</b> <b>chickens</b> (Gallus gallus), <b>in</b> isolated and mixed rearing systems, and to determine the dynamics {{and structure of the}} louse populations collected. The prevalences were 100 and 35 % for <b>chickens</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> isolated and mixed systems, respectively. The species recorded were: Menopon gallinae, Menacanthus stramineus, Goniodes gigas, Goniocotes gallinae and Lipeurus caponis. <b>The</b> <b>chickens</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> isolated system presented more lice than did <b>the</b> ones <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mixed system. The most prevalent species were M. gallinae (30. 58 and 62. 31 %) and L. caponis (29. 12 and 14. 49 %), <b>in</b> <b>the</b> isolated and mixed systems, respectively. The preferential sites of parasitism were the dorsum, venter and wings among <b>the</b> <b>chickens</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> isolated system, while among <b>the</b> ones <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mixed system, the preferential sites were the dorsum and venter. The mean intensity of infestation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> isolated system was 111. 4 for males and 19. 1 for females, while <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mixed system it was 80 for males and 6. 75 for females.

40|$|<b>The</b> study {{conducted}} <b>in</b> this thesis examines the genetic population history of <b>chickens</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Indo-Pacific region <b>in</b> order to infer the prehistoric human-mediated translocation of chickens and investigate whether the dispersal history of <b>chickens</b> <b>in</b> this region parallels the Austronesian expansion. The {{research focuses on}} <b>chicken</b> populations found <b>in</b> Island Southeast Asia, Pacific Ocean, and Indian Ocean – regions where Austronesian languages are spoken. The islands and archipelagos found in this region are separated by vast distances of ocean, thus the dispersal of chickens within this region is mediated only through human agency. The geographic distribution of genetic variation <b>in</b> <b>chickens</b> of this region is due only to humans translocating chickens during their voyages, thus this genetic information can be utilised to examine {{the expansion of the}} Austronesian-speaking people. A genetic survey that spans two oceans is challenging, thus the study relied mostly on modern chicken DNA and available ancient DNA to reconstruct events that transpired several millennia ago. The use of modern DNA allowed comparison with reference sequences from across the globe, whereas ancient DNA allowed population continuity to be tested – i. e., whether the modern specimen still represents past populations. The phylogeographic and population genetic analyses on these chickens provided unparalleled insights into the prehistoric translocation history of <b>chickens</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Indo-Pacific region. These have allowed us to confirm the Philippine homeland of the Polynesian chickens and find the east African proximate population source for <b>chickens</b> <b>in</b> Madagascar. Furthermore, <b>the</b> study supports that chickens were dispersed into the Pacific along with the Austronesian expansion, but not <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Indian Ocean. The study also revealed original insights and highlights the complex picture about the population history and human-mediated dispersals of <b>chickens</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Indo-Pacific. This complexity is brought {{by the fact that the}} prehistoric translocation of chickens cannot be solely attributed to one dominant human group or expansion event that occurred <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region. Therefore, it is paramount to use archaeological and linguistic narratives to explain the genetics of chickens and reach the best inference possible about their history. This research demonstrates the usefulness of using genetic studies on <b>chickens</b> <b>in</b> elucidating <b>the</b> origins and routes of prehistoric translocations and Austronesian expansion <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Indo-Pacific. This study advances our knowledge about prehistoric dispersal of <b>chickens</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Indo-Pacific region and will precipitate exciting new avenues of research. Thesis (Ph. D.)
