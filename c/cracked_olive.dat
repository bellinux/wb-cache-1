50|$|The Salonenque, {{carrying}} {{the name of}} Salon-de-Provence, is a cultivar of olives grown primarily in Provence. Though it is used for producing oil, and gives a good yield, it is valued primarily as a table olive. It is produced as a so-called <b>cracked</b> <b>olive,</b> {{which means that the}} fruit is cracked to speed up the curing process.|$|E
5000|$|The {{primary use}} of the Salonenque is as a table olive, more {{specifically}} as <b>cracked</b> <b>olives</b> (olives that are slit during the curing for the process to go faster). They cured olives are [...] "fresh with a firm, meaty texture and a whiff of aromatic fennel". It is also used for production of oil, and gives a high yield (22 - 25%). The taste of the oil is sweet and delicate, and quite strong. The olive is freestonethe stone does not cling to the flesh. The Salonenque is used in several officially approved appellations: such as [...] "AOC Vallée des Baux" [...] and [...] "AOC Pays d'Aix".|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis article {{refers to}} the paper “Assessment of table olive {{fermentation}} by functional data analysis” (Ruiz-Bellido et al., 2016) [1]. The dataset include pH, titratable acidity, yeast count and area values obtained during fermentation process (380 days) of Aloreña de Málaga olives subjected to five different fermentation systems: i) control of acidified cured olives, ii) highly acidified cured olives, iii) intermediate acidified cured olives, iv) control of traditional <b>cracked</b> <b>olives,</b> and v) traditional <b>olives</b> <b>cracked</b> after 72 h of exposure to air. Many of the Tables and Figures shown in this paper were deduced after application of Functional Data Analysis to raw data using a routine executed under R software for comparison among treatments by the transformation of raw data into smooth curves {{and the application of}} a new battery of statistical tools (functional pointwise estimation of the averages and standard deviations, maximum, minimum, first and second derivatives, functional regression, and functional F and t-tests) ...|$|R
40|$|Proceedings of the International Conference “Environmentally {{friendly}} and safe technologies for quality {{of fruit and}} vegetables”, held in Universidade do Algarve, Faro, Portugal, on January 14 - 16, 2009. This Conference was a join activity with COST Action 924. In the south of Portugal, <b>cracked</b> green <b>olives</b> represent a traditional way of processing table olives. After harvesting and sorting, the olives are washed, broken and immediately brined (Process A) or submitted to various washing steps with water prior to brining (Process B). The objective of this work was to study the effect of different processing treatments {{on the evolution of}} microbiological and physicochemical parameters during the fermentation of <b>cracked</b> green <b>olives</b> at a homemade scale and at different temperatures (25 ºC, room temperature and 18 ºC). Yeasts were found to be the dominant group in fermented <b>cracked</b> green table <b>olives.</b> Process A originated brines without countable Enterobacteria, with higher free acidity and higher phenolic content, when compared to brines resulting from Process B, suggesting that cracking and brining them straight away, represent a preferable way of processing olives which may guarantee the safety of the final product...|$|R
40|$|The {{microbiological}} {{and safety}} conditions of green table olives {{sold on the}} Italian market were evaluated on 40 samples, 20 loose and 20 packed in containers, purchased at street markets and supermarkets. The olives were analyzed for microflora and food safety indices, and for aflatoxin B 1 and ochratoxin A occurrence, and the results showed acceptable security. There was wide heterogeneity in the microflora, the numerical values being {{in relation to the}} olive type. The microbial population was dominated by the yeasts and lactic bacteria responsible for the fermentation process, and their numbers, together with the metabolic activity, led to conditions unfavorable for the development of pathogenic microflora; hence, such microflora were always absent. However, fecal coliforms were occasionally found in <b>cracked</b> <b>olives.</b> Lactic Acid Bacteria and yeast classification was performed at the species level by molecular techniques. The mycotoxin aflatoxin B 1 was detectable in 25 % of the olive samples, in the range of 0. 40 – 0. 55 μg/kg, while ochratoxin A, present in 58 % of the samples, was in the range of 0. 20 – 3. 90 μg/kg...|$|R
40|$|<b>Cracked</b> {{green table}} <b>olives,</b> from the Manzanilla variety, are a {{fermented}} food produced and consumed in Portugal. The {{objective of the}} present work was to study the microbiological characteristics and yeast population evolution during the fermentation of <b>cracked</b> green <b>olives.</b> The predominant microorganisms were yeasts while lactic acid bacteria were not detected and a clear decrease of the mould population was observed. At {{the end of the}} fermentations, no viable counts of Enterobacteriaceae were found. Yeast isolates were identified by the 5. 8 S rRNA-ITS region restriction analysis and by sequencing the D 1 /D 2 region of the 26 S rRNA gene. During the initial phases of the fermentations a great diversity of yeasts was observed. However, as the processes evolved the biodiversity decreased with the fermentative yeasts Citeromyces matritensis, Zygotorulaspora mrakii and Saccharomyces cerevisiae becoming the dominant species. The presence of these fermentative yeasts {{at the end of the}} production process is associated to a risk of spoilage. The results obtained represent a first attempt towards the comprehension of the microbiota of this type of “Natural olives” that constitute an important component of the Mediterranean diet...|$|R
40|$|The {{shelf life}} of cracked “seasoned” Manzanilla-Aloreña table olives is short; {{containers}} may swell and the fruits become progressively brownish. Respiration of cracked fruits continued {{for a period}} longer than 48 h after picking and the carbon dioxide produced may be an initial cause of spoilage. As processing progressed, the microbial loads in the olives increased due to successive washings and, together with the microbial load from the added ingredients, led to relatively high viable counts of yeasts and LAB at packing. During shelf life, this microflora showed an increase in viable counts which could also eventually lead to swelling spoilage. This behaviour was favoured {{by the presence of}} residual fermentable substrates and a decrease in potassium sorbate over time in both brine and flesh. At the same time, colour darkened, titratable acidity increased and pH decreased. The application of two additional washings to the <b>cracked</b> <b>olives</b> before packing was favourable because fermentable material and polyphenols were removed; however, fruits with as low as possible respiration rates, stronger washing treatments, ingredients with low or no microbial viable counts and higher preservative concentrations would be necessary to achieve complete stabilization of the product.

40|$|In this work, ferric {{coagulation}} {{and acid}} <b>cracking</b> as <b>olive</b> mill wastewater (OMW) pretreatments during photocatalysis process were compared in batch recirculation reactor. Because of ferric ions influence, ferric coagulation has preference over acid cracking. Ferric ions influence on intensification of penolic components absorption on TiO 2 surface in initial and oxidize organic pollutant during photocatalysis treatment. In this investigation, COD and total phenolic (TPh) reduction were studied with altering TiO 2 concentration and pH as main effects. The {{results revealed that}} the percentage removals of COD and TPh in ferric coagulation were 69. 24 % and 88. 16 % respectively, whereas these percentage removals in acid cracking were 62. 66 % and 57. 87 % respectively.
