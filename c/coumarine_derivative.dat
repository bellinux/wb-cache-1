40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the effects of cloricromene, a <b>coumarine</b> <b>derivative,</b> in rats subjected to collagen-induced arthritis. Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) was induced in Lewis rats by an intradermal injection of 100 [*]μl of the emulsion (containing 100 [*]μg of bovine type II collagen) (CII) and complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) at the base of the tail. On day 21, a second injection of CII in CFA was administered. Lewis rats developed an erosive hind paw arthritis when immunized with CII in CFA. Macroscopic clinical evidence of CIA first appeared as peri-articular erythema and oedema in the hind paws. The incidence of CIA was 100 % by day 27 in the CII challenged rats and the severity of CIA progressed over a 35 -day period with radiographic evaluation revealing focal resorption of bone together with osteophyte formation in the tibiotarsal joint and soft tissue swelling. The histopathology of CIA included erosion of the cartilage at the joint margins. Treatment of rats with cloricromene (10 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 i. p. daily) starting at the onset of arthritis (day 23), delayed the development of the clinical signs at days 24 – 35 and improved histological status in the knee and paw. Immunohistochemical analysis for iNOS, COX- 2, nitrotyrosine and for poly (ADP-ribose) synthetase (PARS) revealed a positive staining in inflamed joints from collagen-treated rats. The degree of staining for iNOS, COX- 2, nitrotyrosine and PARS were markedly reduced in tissue sections obtained from collagen-treated rats, which had received cloricromene. Radiographic signs of protection against bone resorption and osteophyte formation were present in the joints of cloricromene-treated rat. This study provides the first evidence that cloricromene, a <b>coumarine</b> <b>derivative,</b> attenuates the degree of chronic inflammation and tissue damage associated with collagen-induced arthritis in the rat...|$|E
40|$|On {{example of}} special {{type of a}} <b>coumarine</b> <b>derivatives</b> and also {{compounds}} with character of esters and diesters, which have an –CHR- group between two carbonyl groups or between carbonyl and imino group, the possibility of detection of C-radicals resulting from the homolytic splitting of the C-H bond of a methylene group was studied. PbO 2 {{was used as an}} appropriate compound, on which surface the <b>coumarine</b> <b>derivatives</b> and the other compounds are decomposed. C-radicals were investigated by means of technique of spin-trapping and by comparison of experimental and simulated EPR spectra...|$|R
40|$|Four {{lipophilicity}} descriptors (RM 0, b, C 0, PC 1) {{for twelve}} <b>coumarine</b> <b>derivatives</b> {{were determined by}} reversed-phase thin-layer chromatography in order to analyze which descriptor best describes the lipophilicity of coumarines investigated. Moreover, possible chemical toxicity of coumarins, expressed as {{the probability of a}} compound to cause organ-specific health effects, was calculated using ACD/Tox Suite program. The quantitative relationships between toxicity and molecular descriptors, including experimentally determined lipophilicity descriptors obtained in current study, were investigated using partial least square regression. The best models were obtained for kidney and liver health effects. Quantitative structure-toxicity relationship models revealed the importance of electric polarization descriptors, size descriptors and lipophilicity descriptors. Obtained models were used for the selection of the structural features of the compounds that are significantly affecting their absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity.
