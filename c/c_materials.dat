40|$|The {{major cause}} of {{anisotropic}} plastic response in polycrystalline metals is crystallographic texturing resulting from the reorientation of the crystal lattices of grains during deformation.

It is demonstrated that as the dielectric constant switches from negative to positive, the plasma frequency (ωp) depends strongly on the ultrasound-assisted fabrication method, {{as well as on}} the melt flow index of the iPP. NCs were fabricated using ultrasound-assisted extrusion methods with 10 wt % loadings of MWCNTs in iPPs with different melt flow indices (MFI).

40|$|The Mount Waldo granite (MWG), dated at 371 ± 2 Ma, {{is typical}} of the younger Devonian {{intrusions}} of the coastal Maine magmatic province. It is a coarse-grained, seriate to porphyritic, biotite ± hornblende, titanite-bearing granite with abundant intermediate to felsic magmatic enclaves and less abundant mafi c schlieren. The MWG contains feldspars of various textures and composition, including abundant plagioclase-mantled K-feld-spar (rapakivi texture), boxy and spongy cellular plagioclase, and plagioclase that show An spikes and/or central cores of higher Ca content. In addition, the magmatic enclaves also preserve textural evidence for mixing and hybridization. Specifi cally, abundant mafi c clots, acicular apatite, inherited megacrysts of all the feldspar varieties common in the host granite, and titanite-plagioclase intergrowths are all observed.
