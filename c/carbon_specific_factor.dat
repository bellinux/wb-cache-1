Several studies assumed 25  % of above ground biomass as the root biomass for hardwood species (IPCC 2006). Although there are limitations of using a constant factor for calculation of root biomass (Brown et al. 1989; Cairns et al. 1997), IPCC has proposed this method of estimating root biomass for reporting <b>carbon</b> stocks. Tree <b>specific</b> <b>factors</b> are available, but such factors vary with {{the age of the}} tree {{as well as with the}} soil characteristics (Brown et al. 1989). The use of constant factor may over/under estimate the total C stock (Cairns et al. 1997). Most of the research work revealed that AGB is strongly correlated with tree diameter (Brown et al. 1989). Also, it is accepted that simple model with only diameter as input is a good estimator of aboveground biomass.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} psychosocial factors related to the onset of bipolar I disorder (BD). To do so, the Bipolar Disorder Etiology Scale (BDES), based on psychological behaviorism, was developed and validated. Using the BDES, common factors related to both major depressive disorder (MDD) and BD and <b>specific</b> <b>factors</b> related only to BD were investigated. METHOD: The BDES, which measures 17 factors based on psychological behaviorism hypotheses, was developed and validated. This scale was administered to 113 non-clinical control subjects, 30 subjects with MDD, and 32 people with BD. ANOVA and post hoc analyses were conducted. Subscales on which MDD and BD groups scored higher than controls were classified as common factors, while those on which the BD group scored higher than MDD and control groups were classified as <b>specific</b> <b>factors.</b> RESULTS: The BDES has acceptable reliability and validity. Twelve common factors influence both MDD and BD and one <b>specific</b> <b>factor</b> influences only BD. Common factors include the following: learning grandiose self-labeling, learning dangerous behavior, reinforcing impulsive behavior, exposure to irritability, punishment of negative emotional expression, lack of support, sleep problems, antidepressant problems, positive arousal to threat, lack of social skills, and pursuit of short-term pleasure. The <b>specific</b> <b>factor</b> is manic emotional response. CONCLUSIONS: Manic emotional response was identified as a <b>specific</b> <b>factor</b> related to the onset of BD, while parents' grandiose labeling is a candidate for a <b>specific</b> <b>factor.</b> Many factors are related to the onset of both MDD and BD...|$|R

40|$|Background: Recent {{investigations}} {{of the structure of}} psychiatric symptoms and disorders provide empirical support for a trans-diagnostic distress component to mental illness in addition to <b>specific</b> <b>factors</b> potentially differentiating individual diagnoses. The well documented developmental trends of psychopathology symptoms across adolescence may need re-evaluation within the context of general distress and disorder specific components. Methods: Within the Neuroscience in Psychiatry Network, large scale factor analysis was implemented across 116 items measuring mental well-being and specific domains of psychopathology (depression, anxiety, antisocial behaviour, OCD, and psychotic symptoms). The sample was 2228 individuals between the ages of 14 and 24. Developmental age trends of a general distress <b>factor</b> and five <b>specific</b> <b>factors</b> (measuring confidence, antisocial behaviour, worry, OCD/Psychotic symptom, and mood) were evaluated for boys and girls. Findings: The confidence and OCD/Psychotic <b>specific</b> <b>factor</b> did not show gender differences and declined across the age range. The antisocial <b>specific</b> <b>factor</b> also showed decline across the age range with higher levels for boys, while the worry <b>specific</b> <b>factor</b> showed increasing levels with higher levels for girls. Girls showed increasing followed by decreasing levels in the general distress and mood factors. Boys showed an increase then a levelling off in general distress and a developmental increase in mood throughout the age range. Discussion: While the general distress factor replicates established developmental trends, the <b>specific</b> <b>factors</b> show unexpected developmental trends indicating potential differences in developmental trends dependent on how we conceptualise mental well and ill health...|$|R

In the <b>specific</b> <b>factors</b> continuum model of this paper, globalization widens inequality, amplifying the positive (negative) premia for export (import- competing) sectors.

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{the impact of}} trade on wages {{in the context of}} the <b>specific</b> <b>factor</b> model by focusing on the link between trade and the average real wage. A recent paper by Jones & Ruffin (2008) shows how one can use the <b>specific</b> <b>factor</b> model to predict how labor should fare from an improvement in the terms of trade, an increase in the price of exportables relative to importables. For this purpose, I use annual firm-level data on the manufacturing sector in Tanzania during the period 1992 to 1998. I find that a ceteris paribus increase in the price of exportables may benefit labor in the food-beverage industry but hurt labor in the textile-garment, wood-furniture and metal-machinery industries. There are industries where the <b>specific</b> <b>factor</b> model predicts that exporting would help workers, but where the Stolper-Samuelson theorem of the Hecksher-Ohlin model predicts the reverse. <b>Specific</b> <b>factor</b> model, wages, terms of trade, elasticity of substitution,...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we use a}} Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model to examine the Double Dividend (DD) hypothesis. Using the general {{equilibrium}} GTAP model data for Australia and the UK, we incorporate endogenous production taxes to achieve targeted abatement policies {{in the production of}} energy goods (coal, oil, gas, petroleum, electricity). Following Bento and Jacobsen (2007), we examine the role played <b>specific</b> <b>factors</b> in the production of energy goods. In particular, we employ a novel approach to model the impact of <b>specific</b> <b>factors</b> on the existence and magnitude of the DD. We also incorporate endogenous labour supply, which allows us to illustrate the size of the labour market effect of targeted abatement policies. Our results indicate that with abatement tax revenue offset by reductions in other government distortions, we can identify which specific forms of revenue recycling yield a DD. For Australia we find that the magnitude of the DD is significantly larger when we employ the <b>specific</b> <b>factor</b> characterisation of an economy and we recycle the revenue through reductions in consumption taxes. However, we find no evidence of a DD for Australia when we employ income tax as the recycling instrument.
