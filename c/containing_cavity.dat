40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} the micro-tensile bond strength (µTBS) {{of a conventional}} glass- ionomer to dentin ‘immediately’ and ‘after ageing’ with or without pre-treatment using a polyalkenoic-acid conditioner. Methods: Occlusal dentin surfaces of 10 teeth were ground flat using a 100 -µm diamond bur. Glass-ionomer (Fuji IX GP Extra, GC) was bonded to the surfaces with and without beforehand conditioning using the polyalkenoic-acid <b>containing</b> <b>Cavity</b> Conditioner (GC). After 1 -week water-storage at 37 °C, specimens were serially cut into 1 -mm 2 stick-shaped micro-specimens, of which per tooth equal parts of specimens were further subjected to 1 -month and 3 -month water-storage, respectively. The µTBS was determined ‘immediately’ (1 -week water storage) and after ‘ 1 -month ageing’ and ‘ 3 -month ageing’ at a crosshead speed of 1. 0 mm/min. Failure analysis was performed using stereo-microscopy and SEM. Data were statistically analyzed by ANOVA and Tukey’s HSD. Results: No significant difference in µTBS was recorded when the conventional glass-ionomer was bonded to conditioned and non-conditioned dentin (p< 0. 05). Most specimens failed predominantly cohesively within the cement. Conclusions: Ageing did not reduce the bond strength of the conventional glass-ionomer to dentin, this irrespective if the surface was beforehand treated with a polyalkenoic-acid conditioner or not. µTBS to dentin (MPa) 				 	 1 -week storage	 1 -month ageing	 3 -month ageing Non-conditioned	 10. 8 ± 4. 6 A	 9. 0 ± 3. 6 A	 9. 3 ± 2. 6 A	 Conditioned	 11. 3 ± 3. 5 a	 8. 7 ± 3. 3 a	 8. 8 ± 3. 4 a	 Same letter indicates absence of statistical significance (Tukey’s HSD, p< 0. 05) status: submitte...|$|E
40|$|Alzheimers Disease (AD) is {{the most}} common form of {{dementia}} in elderly people and is characterized by the deposition of extracellular amyloid plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles in the brains. The amyloid plaques are mainly composed of Abeta (Ab) peptides, resulting from proteolytic processing of the Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP). According to the amyloid cascade hypothesis the abnormal production and aggregation of these peptides is the trigger for the cascade of events ultimately resulting in AD. The final step in the production of Ab is catalyzed by gamma-secretase, a large membrane-bound aspartic acid protease, which is composed of four subunits: Presenilin (PS), Nicastrin (NCT), Aph- 1 and Pen- 2. Gamma-secretase is an attractive drug target to tackle AD. However, since the enzyme has, besides APP, many other substrates, one of which is Notch, a very important signal transduction molecule, caution is necessary upon designing gamma-secretase inhibitor/modulators PS harbors the catalytic aspartates of the enzyme complex, which are present in a water <b>containing</b> <b>cavity.</b> The role of the three other subunits is less clear. In this thesis, we focused on Pen- 2, the smallest subunit of gamma-secretase. It is generally accepted that Pen- 2 is involved in the endoproteolytic cleavage of PS, which is necessary to obtain active gamma-secretase complexes. However, neither the mode of action in the endoproteolysis nor possible other roles for Pen- 2 in gamma-secretase are clear. We addressed the role of Pen- 2 role in vivo by characterizing Pen- 2 -/- embryos. We observed an embryonic lethal phenotype that was very similar to the Notch-deficiency phenotype observed in mouse embryos knockout for the other gamma-secretase subunits. Because Pen- 2 protein levels are strongly depending on the expression levels of the other gamma-secretase subunits, we concluded that the main function of Pen- 2 is its role in the gamma-secretase complex. Next, we moved to the in vitro study of the function of Pen- 2. For this study, we took advantage of the Pen- 2 -/- embryos from which we generated Pen- 2 -/- fibroblasts, allowing us to investigate the function of Pen- 2 without interference of endogenous Pen- 2 levels. We characterized the Pen- 2 -/- fibroblasts and observed a deficiency in gamma-secretase maturation and activity. Furthermore, we detected a trimeric gamma-secretase subcomplex composed of full length PS, NCT and Aph- 1, which was devoid of gamma-secretase activity, even if we expressed a PS mutant that is active without endoproteolytical cleavage. These results suggest that the role of Pen- 2 in the gamma-secretase complex extends beyond PS endoproteolysis. To further study this role, we applied a systematic cysteine scanning mutagenesis approach, replacing amino acids in Pen- 2 one by one for a cysteine in a cysteine-less Pen- 2 background. We showed that in most cases, single pointmutations in Pen- 2 do not interfere with complex assembly, maturationandactivity, except for two residues in hydrophobic domain 1 of Pen- 2, Glycine 22 and Proline 27. We demonstrated that Glycine 22 is probably involved in the interaction of Pen- 2 with other subunits, while Proline 27 is important for the secondary structure of Pen- 2. In a next step, we used the single cysteine mutants to analyze the exposure of the cysteines to water. To our surprise, we found that the N-terminal half of what is predicted to be hydrophobic domain 1, is in fact present in a constricted, hydrophilic environment. Furthermore, the loop of Pen- 2 was accessible from the extracellular side, while the existing model for Pen- 2 places this loop in the cytosol. Taking everything together, we propose a new model for Pen- 2 in which the N-terminal part of hydrophobic domain 1 and the loop of Pen- 2 are present in a water-accessible cavity in the membrane. Cryo-electron microscopy studies have demonstrated the presence of two low density areas in the gamma-secretase complex, which were predicted to be water cavities. One of them is proposed to be the catalytic cavity. To learn more about the putative cavity to which Pen- 2 belongs, we performed cross-linking assays with a cysteine in the loop of Pen- 2. We were able to cross-link the loop of Pen- 2 to PS 1 CTF indicating its close proximity to this part of gamma-secretase, which has been shown to be critical for the function of the protease. Finally, we verified whether the loop of Pen- 2 was involved in the catalytic mechanism by changing its length or sequence. Modifying the loop indeed decreased overall gamma-secretase activity levels, but not drastic enough to attribute a direct key role in gamma-secretase activity to the loop of Pen- 2. Interestingly, we observed a certain degree of substrate specificity in the loop mutants. Taking everything together, our data reveal a more dynamic conformation for Pen- 2 that suggests participation in the function (and not only in the structure) of the enzyme complex. status: publishe...|$|E

This connection {{has been used to}} develop the so-called ``inside-outside duality`` method, which can be used to detect the interior eigenvalues from far field data. In this method a particular focus lies on the behavior of certain eigenvalues of the far field operator, which characterizes the interior eigenvalues. This thesis is separated into two parts. In the first part, we consider acoustic, time-harmonic scattering from impenetrable and penetrable scattering objects. We start by considering acoustic scattering from impenetrable objects and subsequently outline the principle arguments for the derivation of the inside-outside duality. In this context we also show how to work with near field data instead of far field data. In the remainder of the first part, the arguments are then adapted to scattering from penetrable scattering objects that may <b>contain</b> <b>cavities.</b> For all scattering scenarios under investigation, numerical examples for the verification of the theoretical results are provided. In the second part of this thesis we consider elastic and electromagnetic scattering problems. In the case of elastic scattering, we assume an isotropic background medium in which either a rigid or a penetrable scattering object is embedded. For electromagnetic scattering, we consider penetrable objects that may <b>contain</b> <b>cavities.</b> The main challenge in this part lies in adapting the preceding arguments for the different scattering equations. Therefore we focus on theoretical results, which can potentially be used to detect interior eigenvalues from corresponding far field data...|$|R

To expand our knowledge of snag use by cavity-nesting birds in this region, we documented characteristics of snags with and without excavated cavities in mixed-conifer and ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex Laws) forest in north-central Arizona. Snags were sampled in 113 square plots (1 ha each) randomly located within a study area covering approximately 73, 000 ha across two National Forests. Density of snags was three times greater in mixed-conifer forest (n 53 plots) than in ponderosa pine forest (n 60 plots), but density of snags <b>containing</b> <b>cavities</b> and overall cavity density did not differ between forest types. In both forest types, snags <b>containing</b> <b>cavities</b> were larger in diameter and retained less bark cover than snags without cavities. Most cavities were in ponderosa pine and Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii Nutt.) snags, and most were in snags in advanced decay classes with broken tops. Our results are largely consistent with previous results from ponderosa pine forest, but differ from previous studies that documented heavy use of quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides Michaux) by cavity nesters in mixed-conifer forest. These results support management to protect and recruit large snags well distributed across the landscape. The relatively high use of ponderosa pine and Gambel oak snags in both forest types suggests that recruitment of large pine and oak snags should be emphasized, and previous studies suggest emphasizing aspen recruitment as well. This may require special management efforts in mixed-conifer forest. These species are relatively shade-intolerant seral species in this forest type, and are apparently declining in this forest type due to fire-suppression efforts and resultant patterns of ecological succession...|$|R
