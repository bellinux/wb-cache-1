40|$|An event {{scheduling}} {{policy for}} Time Warp parallel simulations based on combined rollback cost considerations is proposed. This policy takes into consideration {{a multitude of}} factors which affect {{the selection of the}} next event to be processed by any processor. These factors are: the event timestamp, the expected event execution time (granularity), the expected number of children events to be produced as a result of processing the candidate parent event and the particular event cancellation scheme used. Our scheduling policy is suitable for simulation models with event types having significantly different event granularity values and different numbers of children events. On any processor, it selects for scheduling from a set of candidate events the one having the smallest sum of granularity value and the expected <b>cancellation</b> <b>cost</b> for children events to be sent to other logical processes. This helps delay the execution of those candidate events which have high combined rollback costs as measured by the sum of granularity values and the expected <b>cancellation</b> <b>cost</b> of children events.

The aircraft schedule recovery is a challenging problem in both industrial and academic fields, especially when aircraft restoration time is uncertain, which is often ignored in previous research. This paper established a two-stage stochastic recovery model to deal with the problem. The first stage model was a resource assignment model on aircraft schedule recovery, with the objective function of minimizing delay and <b>cancellation</b> <b>cost.</b> The second stage model used simple retiming strategy to adjust the aircraft routings obtained in the first stage, with the objective function of minimizing the expected cost on recourse decision. Based on different scenarios of restoration time, the second stage model can be degenerated as several linear models.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{consider}} risk management in the airline industry using an economic model. An increase in the number of airlines can reduce the probability of passengers being unable to find substitutable flights, while it increases total entry costs. Thus, there is an optimal number of entries to the market, and we can evaluate whether the actual number of entries exceeds or falls short of the optimal level. On that basis, this article investigates the following two questions: (1) "Do excess or insufficient entries occur in the airline industry?" and (2) "If this is ambiguous, in what situations do excess or insufficient entries occur?" The conclusions of our analysis are as follows. First, it is ambiguous whether excess or insufficient entries occur. Second, the higher (lower) the cost of airfares, the probability of engine trouble, the number of flights and the number of passengers, the more likely is a situation of excess (insufficient) entries, while the higher (lower) the entry cost and flight <b>cancellation</b> <b>cost,</b> the more likely is a situation of insufficient (excess) entry. risk management, airline industry, entry...|$|E

30|$|Some of {{the related}} {{literature}} on the unit cost estimation is reviewed as follows. Estimating the unit cost of a product {{is not an easy}} task in many industries. Cohen et al. [15] analyzed the data of <b>cancellation</b> <b>costs,</b> holding costs, and delay costs of suppliers in a semiconductor equipment supply chain. The collected data indicated that a supplier perceived the <b>cancellation</b> <b>costs</b> to be about two times higher than the delay costs, and the holding costs to be about three times higher than the delay costs. Such perceptions may be misleading and undermine the effectiveness of a unit cost estimation mechanism. The unit cost is determined by yield that is subject to significant uncertainty caused by human intervention. To address this, several studies estimated the unit cost of a product with a fuzzy value. The maximum (minimum) of the fuzzy value indicates the highest (lowest) possible value of the unit cost, which happens when the yield is at the lowest (highest) level [7]. For example, in Wu et al. [30], the quality of raw materials from suppliers was unstable and was modeled with a trapezoidal fuzzy number (TrFN). As a result, the unit cost became a TrFN as well. Based on that, a fuzzy multi-objective programming model was established for supplier selection and risk modeling. Chen [10] modeled the unit cost of a DRAM product with a triangular fuzzy number (TFN). Lee et al. [20] observed that the cost per bit of DRAM has been decreasing at a rapid rate with advances in DRAM processing technologies that scale more DRAM cells into the same die area. Many studies on production planning considered this fact by incorporating in fuzzy unit cost estimates. For example, Vijayan and Kumaran [29] minimized the total inventory costs when the unit costs were estimated with fuzzy numbers. In Zhao et al. [31], the unit cost of each product was modeled as a fuzzy number, based on which the pricing decisions for substitutable products could be made. In addition to modeling uncertain learning processes, fuzzy logic has been extensively applied to designing controllers in a noisy environment [3, 4, 6, 23, 26].|$|R
40|$|As the United States {{is poised}} to enter {{a new era of}} nuclear power plant construction, it behooves us to revisit some of the controversies of the past and {{consider}} how best to deal with some of the major problems that arose once before and may confront us once again as we go down this path. A flurry of costly, protected, and complex disputes concerning the allocation of plant <b>cancellation</b> <b>cost</b> followed upon the collapse of the first boom in nuclear power plant construction during the 1970 s and 1980 s.

It can introduce problematic jurisdictional concerns into utility decisions that should be guided more by basic considerations of appropriately meeting energy demand. This article aims to take a step toward harmonizing the used and useful test with the prudent investment test by proposing that the latter can be updated through pursing an analogy to products liability law. By reconfiguring the concept of “prudence” away from its analogy to the business judgment rule toward products liability standards, this approach promises to provide a means both to respect precedent in those jurisdictions applying the prudent investment test and provide a more rational, consistent and equitable basis for allocating the costs of future nuclear plant cancellations...|$|E
40|$|A vehicle-based {{service system}} might be {{susceptible}} to unexpected costs and delays due to unforeseen events, {{such as a}} vehicle breakdown, a traffic accident, a medical emergency, etc. In such situations, a priori algorithmic solution may be deteriorated and fleet plans {{may need to be}} adjusted in real-time {{as a function of the}} dynamic system state. I consider real-time logistics management problems where a vehicle breaks down in the midst of operations. First, a backup vehicle needs to be determined to pick up the passengers/cargo from the breakdown vehicle, and from the breakdown point completing the remaining portion of the planned trip. This backup vehicle can be dispatched from the depot or from the vehicles currently in service. In the former case, it may impose a significant delay if the depot is far away from the breakdown location. In the latter case, the vehicle used as backup may have to change its own schedule. Trips uncompleted by this backup vehicle may have to be further covered by other vehicles. Thus, a good solution should be acquired in conjunction with the status of all other vehicles in the entire network. Yet, the new schedule may be considerably different from the original one after rescheduling is done. These changes may make the crew-rescheduling problem challenging, since it is essential to ensure that all crews know the itinerary of their new trips. Furthermore, the vehicle breakdown may not only delay the current trip that is directly affected by the disruption but also other trips that the breakdown vehicle has to cover in the network. Some of the delayed trips may have to be cancelled. A good approach should consider operating cost, fixed vehicle cost, delay cost, schedule disruption cost as well as trip <b>cancellation</b> <b>cost</b> simultaneously. This real-time logistics management problem has not been properly addressed in the literature. The major contributions of this study are the modeling and formulation of this vehicle rescheduling problem, and the development of some fast algorithms to solve it quickly.

5|$|When the Secretary of State for Defence {{announced}} the {{contract for the}} vessels, the cost was initially estimated at £3.9billion. The contracts were officially signed one year later on 3 July 2008, after the creation of BVT Surface Fleet through the merger of BAE Systems Surface Fleet Solutions and VT Group's VT Shipbuilding which was a requirement of the UK Government. At the time of approval the first carrier was expected to enter service in July 2015 and the budget was £4,085m for two ships. The financial crisis led to a decision in December 2008 to slow production, delaying the first ship until May 2016 and the second by two years. This decision alone added £1,560m to the cost. By March 2010 the budget was estimated at £5,900m; taking off the cost of capital led to a MPR10 Capital DEL baseline cost of £5,254m at this time. If the carriers had been abandoned in the 2010 SDSR then the MoD could have cancelled £1.5bn of planned spending on Queen Elizabeth and £1.3bn of planned spending on Prince of Wales, but the loss of VAT exemption meant that cancelling one or two carriers would have overall saved £989m and £2,098m respectively.

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we present an {{innovative}} dynamic modeling framework to the aircraft schedule recovery problem (ASRP). The ASRP {{can be defined}} as the problem of modifying the flight and aircraft schedules to compensate the presence of irregular operations that result in the temporary or permanent unavailability of aircraft. Previous works on this topic often make use of static disruption test scenarios, simulating a set of disrupted events in a single time evaluation. The modeling framework here presented, named Disruption Set Solver (DSS), is innovative because it tackles aircraft schedule disruptions in a dynamic way (i. e., the recovery problem is solved as disruptions happen, involving the solutions of new disruption but also considering decision the incumbent solution) and because {{it is the first time}} that parallel time-space networks are used to track individual aircraft in the fleet. The framework relies on the combined usage of an efficient aircraft selection algorithm and a linear-programming model based on parallel aircraft specific time-space networks. The goal of the optimization model used to solve the ASRP is to minimize costs, including operational, passengers delay and <b>cancellation</b> <b>costs.</b> The decision variables involve the cancellation of flights, the delay of flights and the swap of aircraft between flights. The validation of the framework is done applying it to a set of real disruptive days in the operation of a major African airline. The results suggest two conclusions: (1) that the traditional static approach can lead to unreliable solutions, neglecting practical challenge and underestimating the disruption costs; and (2) that the proposed dynamic DSS framework can solve real aircraft schedule disruption problems within a time-window suitable for real-time operations...|$|R
