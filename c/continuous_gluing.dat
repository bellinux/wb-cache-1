The uniqueness of solution is proved by the method of integral energy and the existence is proved by the method of integral equations.

40|$|The {{efficient}} {{solution of}} operator equations using wavelets requires that they generate a Riesz {{basis for the}} underlying Sobolev space {{and that they have}} cancellation properties of a sufficiently high order.

40|$|The {{application}} mechanism {{of a commercial}} cold water soluble starch glue on stepped and folded sack papers has been studied on a pilot machine of bottom gluing. The machine was equipped with a conventional gluing station. The influence of the relevant process parameters e. g. paper velocity, speed and speed ratio of rolls, roll gaps, material and surface characteristics of the stereos, glue viscosity etc. on the time- and position-related glue thickness uniformity has been evaluated. The relations between the parameters have been quantified and from the date the glue thickness uniformity during the application has been optimized. The results make possible the determination of suitable parameter ranges for the thickness control systems. In part 1 (issue 4 / 1988) {{the results of the}} investigations of a <b>continuous</b> <b>glue</b> application with smooth, not interrupted application rolls on not stepped papers are discussed. In this part 2 the intermittent glue stereotype application on folded and stepped sack papers are treated...|$|R

The logarithm {{can be made}} <b>continuous</b> by <b>gluing</b> together countably many copies, called sheets, of the complex plane along the branch cut. On each sheet, {{the value of the}} log differs from its principal value by a multiple of 2πi.

40|$|The {{mathematical}} {{description of}} geometry is {{of paramount importance}} in the modeling of systems of all kinds. Standard geometric modeling describes curved objects through parametric functions as the image of compact domains. Alternatively, as in algebraic geometry, one may describe curved geometry as the zero-set of polynomials. Geometric modeling of biological systems highlight certain persistent and open problems more effectively addressed using algebraic geometry. In this thesis a framework for computer-based geometric representation based on algebraic geometry is introduced. Several algebraic representation schemes known as A-splines and A-patches are detailed as a description of geometry, by using a piecewise <b>continuous</b> <b>gluing</b> of algebraic curves and surfaces. The application of Asplines and A-patches to biological modeling is discussed in the context of protein molecular interface modeling. The rationale is to present an algebraic representation of bio-modeling under an unified point of view. This framework provides a suitable background for the main contribution of this thesis: the formulation and implementation of algorithms for Boolean operations (union, intersection, difference, etc.) on the algebra of curved polyhedra whose boundary is triangulated with A-patches. Boolean operations on curved geometry are yet an open obstinate research problem and its exact solution is only definable within the domain of algebraic geometry. The exact formulation is here used as basis for a geometrically approximate yet topologically accurate solution, closed in the geometric domain of A-patches. The prototype implementation has been applied to pairs of molecular models of ligand proteins in docking configuration. To date, the computational use of algebraic geometry is still experimental and is far from being a major component of current systems. This thesis shows an evidence that representation techniques derived from algebraic geometry have strong potential in bio-medical modeling, still needing much further research and engineering...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} an explicitly solvable model (formulated in the Riemannian geometry terms) for a stationary wave {{process in a}} specific thin domain with the Dirichlet boundary conditions on the boundary of the domain. The transition from the solutions of the scattering problem to the solutions of a problem on the limiting quantum graph is studied. We calculate the Lagrangian gluing conditions at vertices for the problem on the limiting graph. If {{the frequency of the}} incident wave is above the bottom of the absolutely <b>continuous</b> spectrum, the <b>gluing</b> conditions are formulated in terms of the scattering data of a problem in a neighborhood of each vertex. Near the bottom of the absolutely continuous spectrum the wave propagation is generically suppressed, and the gluing condition is degenerate (any solution of the limiting problem is zero at each vertex) ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} AEINS, Adaptive Educational Interactive Narrative System, {{that supports}} teaching ethics for 8 - 12 year old children. AEINS is designed based on Keller's and Gagné's learning theories. The idea is centered around involving students in moral dilemmas (called teaching moments) {{within which the}} Socratic Method is used as the teaching pedagogy. The important unique aspect of AEINS is that it exhibits the presence of four features shown to individually increase effectiveness of edugames environments, yet not integrated together in past research: a student model, a dynamic generated narrative, scripted branched narrative and evolving non-player characters. The student model aims to provide adaptation. The dynamic generated narrative forms a <b>continuous</b> story that <b>glues</b> the scripted teaching moments together. The evolving agents increase the realism and believability {{of the environment and}} perform a recognized pedagogical role by helping in supplying the educational process. AEINS has been evaluated intrinsically and empirically according to the following themes: architecture and implementation, social aspects, and educational achievements. The intrinsic evaluation checked the implicit goals embodied by the design aspects and made a value judgment about these goals. In the empirical evaluation, twenty participants were assigned to use AEINS over a number of games. The evaluation showed positive results as the participants appreciated the social characteristics of the system as they were able to recognize the genuine social aspects and the realism represented in the game. Finally, the evaluation showed indications for developing new lines of thinking for some participants to the extent that some of them were ready to carry the experience forward to the real world. However, the evaluation also suggested possible improvements, {{such as the use of}} 3 D interface and free text natural language. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background In aortic {{replacement}} procedures the aortic {{wall and}} Teflon strips form a double layer, {{with the use}} of <b>continuous</b> sutures. Surgical <b>glues</b> {{may or may not be}} used to enhance the durability of the anastomoses. In this technical report a modification of the aortic stumps preparation is devised. The technique reduces substantially the preparation time of the aortic stumps by the use of ligation clips and a surgical sealant. Technique Suturing is the standard method for the aortic-teflon double-layer formation prior to Dacron anastomosis. In this study, instead of suturing, 5 - 6 ligation clips are primarily applied on the exterior of the double layer to facilitate proper cooptation. Secondarily, in order to fuse the two layers together, a sealant is injected in between the Teflon and aortic wall. Thus each stump is delivered quickly sutureless for the Dacron anastomosis. Between January 2003 and March 2009 this modified operative technique was performed in 14 cases (group A) with a mean age of 50 ± 16 years. This was contrasted against 24 controls (group B), with a mean age of 40 ± 28 years, treated with the conventional method, where only continuous sutures were used during the anastomosis. All patients were cases of ascending aorta replacement and/or aortic hemi-arch replacement, for acute aortic dissection or aortic dilatation. Results The pure anastomosis time (stump preparation and Dacron connection) was shortened by approximately 25 minutes depending on surgeon's experience. The anastomosis blood-loss was also significantly reduced in the sutureless group A, as evident by the dry operative field and the limited use of blood products, post-prosthetic graft anastomosis. This reflected to a faster post-operative recovery, faster extubation and fewer complications. At a mean follow-up of 21 ± 7 days, there were no post-operative deaths being related to acute aortic dissection or rupture of the anastomotic site. Conclusion Aortic replacement with the combination of ligation clips and a surgical sealant vs. sutures alone allows easy manipulations of the aorta and adaptation of the diameters, thus optimizing aortic operational timings and hemostasis. Moreover, it prevents blood loss and aortic wall trauma from multiple sutures. </p...|$|R
