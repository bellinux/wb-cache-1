50|$|The {{count for}} {{diaspora}} is approximate because of incomplete statistical records and naturalization. Overseas, the United States contains the largest Croatian emigrant group (544,270 in the 1990 census; 374,271 in the 2000 census), mostly in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Illinois and California, with a sizable community in Alaska, followed by Australia (105,747 according to 2001 census, with concentrations in Sydney, Melbourne and Perth) and Canada (Southern Ontario, British Columbia and Alberta). The {{total number of}} Croatian descendants in the United States and Canada has been estimated to 2 millions. Croats have also emigrated in several waves to Latin America, mostly to South America: chiefly Chile, Argentina, and Brazil; estimates of their number vary wildly, from 150,000 up to 500,000. There are also smaller groups of Croatian descendants in the Brazil, Ecuador, Peru, South Africa, New Zealand, Mexico, and South Korea. The most important organisations of the Croatian diaspora are the Croatian Fraternal Union, Croatian Heritage Foundation and the <b>Croatian</b> <b>World</b> <b>Congress.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Under the {{patronage}} of Croatian Peasant Party {{there was also}} a trade union organization named [...] "Croatian Worker's Union" [...] ("Hrvatski radnički savez") with headquarters in Charleroi. There were also few sport and cultural societies, of which some are still active today. Among others, there were also few Yugoslav clubs under patronage of Yugoslav embassy, those clubs served for espionage of Croats in Belgium.The real political life of Belgian Croats started with founding of Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) and arrival of Franjo Tuđman on the Croatian political scene. First Croats of Belgium registered as HDZ members even before first democratic elections. With sequence of events, Croats of Belgium have founded branches of Croatian Democratic Union (in 1990 and 1991) in Antwerp, Brussels and Liège. The founders were later immigrants who came after the World War II, and in less numbers, heirs of immigrants from the first wave of immigration. Croats in Belgium mostly helped financially by sending money to hospitals, charities and military budget. The money came, mainly through HDZ branches.Croatian political organizations that are still active are branches of Croatian Democratic Union, Croatian Peasant Party and Croatian Liberation Movement. Other active Croatian organizations are Sport and Cultural Society [...] "Croatia" [...] from Antwerp, [...] "SOS-Croatia" [...] from Merchtem near Brussels, [...] "HNK Croatia" [...] (Croatian National Theater [...] "Croatia") in Liège, association of Croatian students [...] "AMAC" [...] in Brussels, charity organization [...] "Edmond Jardas" [...] (they are mostly helping to children of killed Croatian defenders), Cultural society [...] "Vatroslav Lisinski" [...] from Liège, [...] "Hrvatski radio sat" [...] ("Croatian Radio Hour") from Liège (founded by members of HSK and Belgian-born Croats, promoting Croatian culture, tourism and return of Croats back to homeland). The head organization is <b>Croatian</b> <b>World</b> <b>Congress</b> of Belgium led by Dr. Miroslav Klarić. At the start of Croatian Homeland War, Belgian Croats founded Croatian Supplementary School, that school is under patronage of Croatian Ministry of Education. One of the most important factors in saving of Croatian identity in Belgium is Catholic Church. Because of misunderstanding of Croatian emigration and Government in Croatia those organizations and societies are being reduced.The contribution of Croats to development of Belgium mostly is reduced on hard-working Croats who worked in Belgian factories and mines. After the World War II, Croats of Belgium had three university professors: Dr. Zvonimir Pintarović, geneticist Dr. Miroslav Radman, sociologist Danilo Klarić and other few doctors, professors, lawyers, economists, academic painters and architects.Besides, Croats also contributed to the Belgian sports. The most famous sportsmen are Tomislav Ivić, Mario Stanić, Robert Špehar, Josip Weber and others. Few Croats also successfully imported canned fish, medicinal plants and vines (Fabris, Divić, Vunić). Croats also work in catering, radios and various Belgian ministries.|$|E
