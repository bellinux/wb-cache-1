40|$|AbstractThe {{orientation}} {{evolution of}} Mg alloy grains was in-situ tracked during compression at 100 °C by {{the method of}} electron backscatter diffraction, and meanwhile, quantitative analysis was also conducted on activations of slips and twinning. Effects of extension twinning activation on slips activations were analyzed during deformation based on <b>calculation</b> <b>of</b> <b>variations</b> of Schmid factor for different slips before and after twinning. It is predicted {{that there are not}} distinct changes for Schmid factor of basal slips before and after twinning for Mg alloy grains with basal textured orientation, while the Schmid factor of prismatic slips decreases distinctly after twinning and accordingly they are hard to be activated during the subsequent deformation. Simultaneously, the Schmid factor of pyramidal slips increases distinctly after twinning and it is relatively easy for them to be activated during the subsequent deformation...|$|E

40|$|It is {{important}} to compute exact value of the gradient in the inverse problem. In case {{that the problem is}} given, the minimization of function is usually used to obtain the gradient. Thus, the analytical <b>calculation</b> <b>of</b> <b>variation</b> <b>of</b> functional should be introduced. But the variation is difficult to formulate and programming. Therefore, there is a method of computation to pursue the <b>variation</b> <b>of</b> functional, Automatic Differentiation (AD). The AD is implemented with C++ programs using operator overloading technique. The partial derivatives are computed according to the differentiation rule of a composite function whenever basic operations are performed. In this study, AD is applied to the parameter identification problems. AD is used in order to calculate the partial derivatives of the performance function. The algorithm of computing the gradient using AD is much simpler than any other method, for example, the adjoint equation method of the Language multiplier, etc. AD is proposed as a new approach to the sensitivity analysis of the inverse problems.

Studies have suggested that respiratory variations in the EKG R wave amplitude (EKGv) {{can be used as}} an indicator of fluid responsiveness in mechanically ventilated patients under general anesthesia, but to date all <b>calculations</b> <b>of</b> <b>variation</b> have been done by hand. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess if a computer-automated algorithm could compute and monitor EKGv with the same precision as manual measurement. Batches of 30  s each of EKG lead II waveforms were recorded during surgical procedures with mechanical ventilation. R wave amplitude variability was assessed both manually and by automated algorithm. For both calculations, wave height was defined as R wave peak minus preceding Q wave trough, and the minimum and maximum amplitudes determined for each respiratory cycle. EKGv was calculated as 100 [*]×[*][(RDIImax[*]−[*]RDIImin)/(RDIImax[*]+[*]RDIImin)/ 2]. Fifty-seven batches of waveforms were calculated. We found that our computer-automated algorithm <b>calculation</b> <b>of</b> EKGv was significantly correlated to manual measurements (r[*]=[*] 0.968, P[*]<[*] 0.001). Bland-Altman analysis also showed a strong agreement between automated and manual EKGv measurements (bias 0.13 %[*]±[*] 3.06 %). The observed correlations between the manually and automatically calculated EKGv suggest that our current computer-automated algorithm is a reliable method for calculating EKGv. Validation in prospective volume expansion studies will be needed to assess the true clinical utility of this automated measurement.|$|R
