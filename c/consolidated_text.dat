40|$|CEPS Director Daniel Gros {{argues in}} this Commentary that the {{solution}} to the 'Irish crisis' could be simple if the other countries are really determined to go ahead. At the forthcoming European Council meeting in Brussels, he suggests that member countries could simply sign the <b>consolidated</b> <b>text</b> of the Treaties which results from the incorporation of the amendments of the Lisbon Treaty into the old Treaty. While the Irish government could not put its signature to such a Treaty at this time, it could be invited by the European Council to submit a set of protocols, or opt-outs, which would allow it to sign the treaty and have a reasonable certainty that the next referendum would have a different outcome. In the meantime, the <b>consolidated</b> <b>text</b> would thus be signed by 26 member states (perhaps 25 if the Czech government judges that ratification is difficult).

40|$|The Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA), between Canada and the European Union (EU), {{was leaked}} to the public opinion in August 2014 {{after five years of}} negotiations. The <b>consolidated</b> CETA <b>text</b> was not {{released}} until the end of last September, raising deeper issues about the secrecy and democratic deficit surrounding the agreement. As some have already noted (notably civil society organizations), this treaty is about much more than trade. Even though the preamble states that it aims to streghthen though the preamble states that it though the preamble states though that the preamble states that it aims to strengthen economic relationships, the text includes an explicit reference to the commitments of both Parties to the UNESCO Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions andunderlies their right to preserve, develop and implement their cultural policies, and to support their cultural industries for the purpose of strengthening the diversity of cultural expressions and preserving their cultural identity (including the use of regulatory measures and financial support). Beyond these intentions enunciated in the preamble, there are only five chapters containing articles exempting culture (Subsidies, Investment, Cross [...] ‐ Border Trade in Services, Domestic Regulation and Government Procurement). Therefore, the text lacks a general exception clause protecting culture. The question about the capacity of this free trade agreement to actually protect and promote the diversity of culture is therefore valid because, for example, whereas for the EU the exception applies only to audiovisual services, for Canada it covers all Cultural industries (as usually defined in its trade agreements). Is this a missed opportunity for both Canada and the EU to safeguard culture from trade, to reconcile rules of free trade and cultural policies? Can the inclusion of the UNESCO Convention in the CETA text help counterbalance and resist those of free trade that undermine necessary and legitimate cultural policies and regulations aiming to protect and promote the diversity of cultural expressions? This contribution will aim to explore answers to these questions taking the <b>consolidated</b> CETA <b>text</b> as a point of departure.
