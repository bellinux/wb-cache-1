40|$|This {{research}} examines theoretically and empirically {{the origins}} of agriculture. The theory highlights the role of <b>climatic</b> <b>sequences</b> as a fundamental determinant of both technological sophistication and population density in a hunter-gatherer regime. It argues that foragers facing volatile environments were forced {{to take advantage of}} their geographic endowments at a faster pace. Consequently, as long as climatic shocks preserved the possibility for agriculture, di¤erences in the rate at which foragers were climatically propelled to exploit their habitat determined the comparative evolution of hunter-gatherer societies towards farming. The theory is tested using both cross-country and cross-archaeological site data on the emergence of farming. Consistent with the theory, the empirical analysis demonstrates that, conditional on biogeographic endowments, climatic volatility has a non-monotonic e¤ect on the timing of the transition to agriculture. Farming was undertaken earlier in regions characterized by intermediate levels of climatic volatility, with regions subjected to either too high or too low intertemporal variability transiting later...|$|R

These sediments show <b>climatic</b> <b>sequences</b> composed of two lithologic terms that differ in their siliciclastic and carbonate contents. Several turbiditic and contouritic sequences are interbedded in these deposits. Turbidite sequences are fine grained and thin bedded with a very low frequency (about 12 sequences during the Neogene). They {{are composed of}} quartz-rich siliciclastic or volcaniclastic sediments. Quartz-rich turbidites originated from the Senegalese margin. Their slightly higher frequency during the early Pliocene indicates that the stronger turbidity currents, and probably the most abundant continental inputs, occur at that period.

40|$|The loess-palaeosol {{succession}} of Kurtak, {{along the western}} slope of the Yenisei Valley, {{is one of the}} best documented Late Pleistocene sequences in southern Central Siberia. The present paper deals with the Kurtak Pedocomplex and with the Chani Bay Complex preserved on the plateau and in a lateral depression respectively, which correspond to the Karga Stage (MIS 3). For this sequence we obtained a detailed palaeoclimatic succession based on pedological and palynological data recording 14 short interstadial periods. The chronology of this record is well established by ca 100 radiocarbon dates on charcoal and wood remains, ranging from 42, 520 to 25, 710 BP. Botanical analysis shows a steppe-like vegetation with small tree populations (spruce, pine, birch) in lateral valleys during the colder periods. During the interstadial episodes spruce populations grew denser in the valleys, while scattered spruce, larch and pine trees expanded on the plateau. Therefore, the Kurtak Pedocomplex and Chani Bay Complex provide a unique climatic record for MIS 3, similar to the middle pleniglacial {{succession of}} the Dinkel Valley in the Netherlands and to loess-palaeosol records of Eastern and Central Europe.

40|$|The Siberian loess {{represents}} {{the most significant}} terrestrial proxy record of Quaternary climatic history in northern Asia. Loess is extensive in southern Siberia, between the Irtysh Basin {{in the west and}} the Angara Basin in the east. Palaeoenvironmental multi-proxy data (magnetic susceptibility (MS), grain size, % CaCO 3, % TOC, pollen, etc.) from high-resolution loess-palaeosol sections provide evidence for a strongly fluctuating <b>climatic</b> <b>sequence</b> in north-central Asia during the Late Quaternary, displaying the globally diagnostic sequences found in the deep-sea oxygen isotope records. MS provides the most continuous and detailed record (encompassing the last two interglacial-glacial cycles) in loess sections in the Minusinsk Basin (Yenisei area) and on the northern Altai Plains. Evidence for periodic atmospheric shifts is provided by gradual changes in the main vegetation zones, with parkland-steppe and mixed taiga during warm interglacial/interstadial stages being replaced by boreal tundra-forest and arid periglacial tundra-steppe during stadials. Climatic pulses from warm intervals to cold are recorded by incipient (forest/steppe) -tundra gleysols. The occurrence of the highest sediment accumulation rates in glacial stages (OIS 4 and OIS 2) in the southern plains and depressions indicates that the most intensive aeolian dust deposition followed the glacial maxima, with the most recent interval dated to ca. 19 - 15 ka BP. Because of its zonal distribution and pronounced climatic continentality, the Siberian loess region represents an important data source for reconstructing past climates in the Northern Hemisphere. It provides a key to the correlation of other loess regions within the West-East Eurasian continental zone. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe Last Interglacial (LIG) {{represents}} an invaluable case study {{to investigate the}} response of components of the Earth system to global warming. However, the scarcity of absolute age constraints in most archives leads to extensive use of various stratigraphic alignments to different reference chronologies. This feature sets limitations {{to the accuracy of}} the stratigraphic assignment of the <b>climatic</b> <b>sequence</b> of events across the globe during the LIG. Here, we review the strengths and limitations of the methods that are commonly used to date or develop chronologies in various climatic archives for the time span (∼ 140 – 100 ka) encompassing the penultimate deglaciation, the LIG and the glacial inception. Climatic hypotheses underlying record alignment strategies and the interpretation of tracers are explicitly described. Quantitative estimates of the associated absolute and relative age uncertainties are provided. Recommendations are subsequently formulated on how best to define absolute and relative chronologies. Future climato-stratigraphic alignments should provide (1) a clear statement of climate hypotheses involved, (2) a detailed understanding of environmental parameters controlling selected tracers and (3) a careful evaluation of the synchronicity of aligned paleoclimatic records. We underscore the need to (1) systematically report quantitative estimates of relative and absolute age uncertainties, (2) assess the coherence of chronologies when comparing different records, and (3) integrate these uncertainties in paleoclimatic interpretations and comparisons with climate simulations. Finally, we provide a sequence of major climatic events with associated age uncertainties for the period 140 – 105 ka, which should serve as a new benchmark to disentangle mechanisms of the Earth system's response to orbital forcing and evaluate transient climate simulations...|$|E
40|$|Because of {{the high}} income {{resulting}} from apple production, apple orchards have widely spread since the 1980 's in the gully region of Loess Plateau of China. Compared to winter wheat, a major crop in this region, apple trees deplete most of the available water in the 010 in soil profile after 30 years, resulting in a decline of apple yield and profitability. Apple trees older than 30 years are often cut, and orchards reconverted to winter wheat, but wheat planted after apple trees suffers from low yield, and groundwater from low recharge rate due to reduced soil water content. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine, with the one-dimensional simulation model Simultaneous Heat and Water Transfer (SHAW), the time required for soil water to recover after apple tree cutting. Recovery time is defined as the amount of time required for a field just cut of its apple trees to recover to the same soil water content of a field that has always been cropped to wheat. SHAW soil and crop parameters were calibrated (1984 - 1989) and validated (1989 - 1994) using measured soil water contents in bare soil and winter wheat plots. Using calibrated soil and crop parameters, soil water content variations in the 0 - 10 in soil profile was simulated under winter wheat conditions for forty randomly generated <b>climatic</b> <b>sequences</b> based on observed 48 -year historical data (1957 - 2004). Results show that the recovery time varies from 6. S to 19. S years, with an average of 13. 7 years, for the 0 - 10 in soil profile, and from 4. 4 to 8. 4 years, with an average of 7. 3 years, for upper 0 - 3 in soil profile. Due to lower soil water content, the mean groundwater recharge rate would be 9. 3 mm year(- 1) in orchard cut plots during the recovery period, compared to 18. 3 mm year(- 1) for land that had always been in winter wheat. Considering the long-term effects of apple orchards on land productivity and groundwater recharge, areas in apple orchards should be restricted to maintain sustainable agriculture in this region.
