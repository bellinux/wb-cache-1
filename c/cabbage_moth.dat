5|$|Cucurbita {{species are}} used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, {{including}} the <b>Cabbage</b> <b>Moth</b> (Mamestra brassicae), Hypercompe indecisa, and the Turnip Moth (Agrotis segetum). Cucurbita can be susceptible to the pest Bemisia argentifolii (silverleaf whitefly) as well as aphids (Aphididae), cucumber beetles (Acalymma vittatum and Diabrotica undecimpunctata howardi), squash bug (Anasa tristis), the squash vine borer (Melittia cucurbitae), and the twospotted spidermite (Tetranychus urticae). The squash bug causes major damage to plants because of its very toxic saliva.|$|E
500|$|Pests include root-knot {{nematodes}} {{and cabbage}} maggots, which produce stunted and wilted plants with yellow leaves; aphids, which induce stunted plants with curled and yellow leaves; harlequin bugs, which cause white and yellow leaves; thrips, {{which lead to}} leaves with white-bronze spots; striped flea beetles, which riddle leaves with small holes; and caterpillars, which leave behind large, ragged holes in leaves. The caterpillar stage of the [...] "small cabbage white butterfly" [...] (Pieris rapae), commonly known in the United States as the [...] "imported cabbage worm", is a major cabbage pest in most countries. The large white butterfly (Pieris brassicae) is prevalent in eastern European countries. The diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella) and the <b>cabbage</b> <b>moth</b> (Mamestra brassicae) thrive in the higher summer temperatures of continental Europe, where they cause considerable damage to cabbage crops. In India, the diamondback moth has caused losses up to 90 percent in crops that were not treated with insecticide. Destructive soil insects include the cabbage root fly (Delia radicum) and the cabbage maggot (Hylemya brassicae), whose larvae can burrow into the part of plant consumed by humans.|$|E

5|$|There {{are nine}} species of insect only found on C.australis, {{of which the}} best known is Epiphryne verriculata, the <b>cabbage</b> tree <b>moth,</b> which is {{perfectly}} adapted to hide on a dead leaf. Its caterpillars eat large holes and wedges in the leaves. The moth lays its eggs {{at the base of}} the central spike of unopened leaves. The caterpillars eat holes in the surface of the leaves and leave characteristic notches in the leaf margins. They can infest young trees but seldom damage older trees, which lack the skirt of dead leaves where the parent moths like to hide.|$|R

40|$|The TTAA-specific {{transposon}} piggyBac (PB), originally {{isolated from}} the <b>cabbage</b> looper <b>moth,</b> Trichoplusia ni, has been utilized as an insertional mutagenesis tool in various eukaryotic organisms. Here, we show that PB transposes in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe and leaves almost no footprints. We developed a PB-based mutagenesis system for S. pombe by constructing a strain with a selectable transposon excision marker and an integrated transposase gene. PB transposition in this strain has low chromosomal distribution bias as shown by deep sequencing-based insertion site mapping. Using this system, we obtained loss-of-function alleles of klp 5 and klp 6, and a gain-of-function allele of dam 1 from a screen for mutants resistant to the microtubule-destabilizing drug thiabendazole. From another screen for cdc 25 - 22 suppressors, we obtained multiple alleles of wee 1 as expected. The success of these two screens demonstrated the usefulness of this PB-mediated mutagenesis tool for fission yeast...|$|R
40|$|SummaryTransposable {{elements}} {{have been}} routinely used for genetic manipulation in lower organisms, including generating transgenic animals and insertional mutagenesis. In contrast, {{the usage of}} transposons in mice and other vertebrate systems is still limited {{due to the lack}} of an efficient transposition system. We have tested the ability of piggyBac (PB), a DNA transposon from the <b>cabbage</b> looper <b>moth</b> Trichoplusia ni, to transpose in mammalian systems. We show that PB elements carrying multiple genes can efficiently transpose in human and mouse cell lines and also in mice. PB permits the expression of the marker genes it carried. During germline transposition, PB could excise precisely from original insertion sites and transpose into the mouse genome at diverse locations, preferably transcription units. These data provide a first and critical step toward a highly efficient transposon system for a variety of genetic manipulations including transgenesis and insertional mutagenesis in mice and other vertebrates...|$|R
