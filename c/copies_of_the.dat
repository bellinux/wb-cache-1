5|$|Bloomsbury {{invested}} £10million in {{an attempt}} to keep the book's contents secure until 21 July, the release date. Arthur Levine, U.S. editor of the Harry Potter series, denied distributing any copies of Deathly Hallows in advance for press review, but two U.S. papers published early reviews anyway. There was speculation that some shops would break the embargo and distribute <b>copies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> book early, as the penalty imposed for previous instalments—that the distributor would not be supplied with any further <b>copies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> series—would no longer be a deterrent.|$|E

5|$|During viral replication, the {{integrated}} DNA provirus is transcribed into RNA, {{some of which}} then undergo RNA splicing to produce mature mRNAs. These mRNAs are exported from the nucleus into the cytoplasm, where they are translated into the regulatory proteins Tat (which encourages new virus production) and Rev. As the newly produced Rev protein accumulates in the nucleus, it binds to full-length, unspliced copies of virus RNAs and allows them to leave the nucleus. Some of these full-length RNAs function as new <b>copies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> virus genome, while others function as mRNAs that are translated to produce the structural proteins Gag and Env. Gag proteins bind to <b>copies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> virus RNA genome to package them into new virus particles.|$|E
