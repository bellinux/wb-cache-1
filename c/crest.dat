5|$|<b>Crest</b> badges are {{specifically}} used {{for people to}} wear, and are made out of silver or white metal. When illustrated, <b>crest</b> badges should only be printed in monochrome, and should not coloured. Women are entitled to wear the <b>crest</b> badge as a brooch, generally worn on the left side, and as such the <b>crest</b> badge may be of gold.|$|E
5|$|<b>Crest</b> badges {{consist of}} a <b>crest</b> and a motto/slogan. These {{elements}} are heraldic property and protected by law in Scotland. <b>Crest</b> badges may be worn by anyone; however, {{those who are not}} entitled to the heraldic elements within, wear a <b>crest</b> badge surrounded by a strap and buckle. Those who own the heraldic elements within, may wear a <b>crest</b> badge surrounded by a plain circlet. The strap and buckle represents that the wearer is a follower of the individual who owns the <b>crest</b> and motto.|$|E
5|$|A Scottish <b>crest</b> badge is a heraldic badge worn to show {{allegiance}} {{to an individual}} or membership in a specific Scottish clan. <b>Crest</b> badges are commonly called clan crests, {{but this is a}} misnomer; {{there is no such thing}} as a collective clan <b>crest,</b> just as there is no such thing as a clan coat of arms.|$|E
5|$|As of 2016, {{the genus}} {{contains}} nine accepted species. There are seven species of <b>crested</b> newts: Anatolian <b>crested</b> newt (Triturus anatolicus), Balkan <b>crested</b> newt (T. ivanbureschi), Danube <b>crested</b> newt (T. dobrogicus), Italian <b>crested</b> newt (T. carnifex), Macedonian <b>crested</b> newt (T. macedonicus), northern <b>crested</b> newt (T. cristatus), and southern <b>crested</b> newt (T. karelinii). Marbled newts have two species, the marbled newt (T. marmoratus) {{and the southern}} marbled newt (T. pygmaeus).|$|R

5|$|Although not {{represented}} {{in the form of}} a flag, the No. 602 (City of Glasgow) Squadron of the Royal Auxiliary Air Force uses the Saltire surmounted by a lion rampant as the device shown on the squadron <b>crest.</b> The station <b>crest</b> of the former RAF Leuchars, Fife, also showed the Saltire, in this case surmounted by a sword. The <b>crest</b> of the former RAF East Fortune, East Lothian, also showed a sword surmounting the Saltire, however unlike Leuchars this sword was shown inverted, and the station <b>crest</b> of the former RAF Turnhouse, Edinburgh, showed a Saltire surmounted by an eagle's head. The East of Scotland Universities Air Squadron <b>crest</b> features a Saltire surmounted by an open book; the book itself being supported by red lions rampant.|$|E
5|$|As {{for other}} lambeosaurines, it is {{believed}} that the cranial <b>crest</b> of Parasaurolophus changed with age and was a sexually dimorphic characteristic in adults. James Hopson, one of the first researchers to describe lambeosaurine crests in terms of such distinctions, suggested that P. cyrtocristatus, with its small <b>crest,</b> was the female form of P. tubicen. Thomas Williamson suggested it was the juvenile form. Neither hypothesis became widely accepted. As only six good skulls, one juvenile braincase, and one recently discovered juvenile skull are known, additional material will help clear up these potential relationships. Williamson noted that in any case, juvenile Parasaurolophus probably had small, rounded crests like P. cyrtocristatus, that probably grew faster as individuals approached sexual maturity. Recent restudy of a juvenile braincase previously assigned to Lambeosaurus, now assigned to Parasaurolophus, provides evidence that a small tubular <b>crest</b> was present in juveniles. This specimen preserves a small upward flaring of the frontal bones that was similar to but smaller than what is seen in adult specimens; in adults, the frontals formed a platform that supported the base of the <b>crest.</b> This specimen also indicates that the growth of the <b>crest</b> in Parasaurolophus and the facial profile of juvenile individuals differed from the Corythosaurus-Hypacrosaurus-Lambeosaurus model, in part because the <b>crest</b> of Parasaurolophus lacks the thin bony 'coxcomb' that makes up the upper portion of the <b>crest</b> of the other three lambeosaurines.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the third week of development, the embryonic ectoderm forms a thickened strip called the neural plate. By the fourth week of development the neural plate has widened to give a broad cephalic end, a less broad middle part and a narrow caudal end. These swellings represent {{the beginning}}s of the forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain. Neural <b>crest</b> cells (derived from the ectoderm) populate the lateral edges of the plate at the neural folds. In the fourth week in the neurulation stage the neural plate folds and closes to form the neural tube, bringing together the neural <b>crest</b> cells at the neural <b>crest.</b> The neural <b>crest</b> runs the length of the tube with cranial neural <b>crest</b> cells at the cephalic end and caudal neural <b>crest</b> cells at the tail. Cells detach from the <b>crest</b> and migrate in a craniocaudal (head to tail) wave inside the tube. Cells at the cephalic end give rise to the brain, and cells at the caudal end give rise to the spinal cord.|$|E

5|$|Clan chiefs may {{wear their}} <b>crest</b> simpliciter, that is without being encircled by the motto {{and without any}} feathers. It is more common, however, for a clan chiefs to wear their own {{personal}} <b>crest</b> within a plain circlet inscribed with their motto or slogan (pictured left). The chief's <b>crest</b> badge does not contain the strap and buckle that other clan members are permitted to wear. Clan chiefs are also entitled to wear three eagle feathers behind the circlet of their <b>crest</b> badge. On certain occasions, such as clan gatherings, it may be appropriate to use real eagle feathers. Clan chiefs that {{are members of the}} British Peerage or a feudal baron are entitled to wear the appropriate coronet or baronial chapeau above the circlet on their <b>crest</b> badge, though {{this is a matter of}} personal preference.|$|E

5000|$|The Balkan <b>crested</b> newt hybridises {{with the}} Anatolian <b>crested</b> newt at its eastern range end. At {{the western and}} {{northern}} borders, it hybridises with the Macedonian <b>crested</b> newt, the Danube <b>crested</b> newt (T. dobrogicus), and the northern <b>crested</b> newt (T. cristatus).

50|$|The eastern black <b>crested</b> gibbon is {{classified}} as separate from other <b>crested</b> gibbons based on molecular data, fur coloration, and differences in vocal communication. Previously it had been considered conspecific with the Hainan black <b>crested</b> gibbon or as a subspecies of the black <b>crested</b> gibbon. Until the sequencing of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene the Hainan black <b>crested</b> gibbon {{was thought to be}} Nomascus nasutus hainanus, a subspecies of eastern black <b>crested</b> gibbon. The researchers proposed that the genetic separation showed it was a distinct species.|$|R

5|$|In 1943, Dominik von Kripp {{suggested}} that the <b>crest</b> may {{have served as a}} rudder, an idea embraced by several later researchers. One researcher, Ross S. Stein, even {{suggested that}} the <b>crest</b> may have supported a membrane of skin connecting the backward-pointing <b>crest</b> to the neck and back, increasing its surface area and effectiveness as a rudder. The rudder hypothesis again, {{does not take into account}} females nor P. sternbergi, which had an upward-pointing, not backward-pointing <b>crest.</b> Bennett also found that even in its capacity as a rudder, the <b>crest</b> would not provide nearly so much directional force as simply maneuvering the wings. The suggestion that the <b>crest</b> was an air brake, and that the animals would turn their heads to the side in order to slow down, suffers from a similar problem. Additionally, the rudder and air brake hypotheses do not explain why such large variation exists in <b>crest</b> size even among adults.|$|E
5|$|In the skull, the rostrum (front part) is rounded. The central groove in {{the nasal}} {{depression}} (the lowered {{area at the}} nose) is relatively broad in comparison to M.manavi. The frontal bones (part of the skull roof) bear a well-developed sagittal <b>crest</b> (a <b>crest</b> that provides support for muscles of the head). Further back on the braincase, the lambdoid <b>crest</b> (another such <b>crest)</b> is also prominent. The middle part of the palate is concave, as in M.brachytragos and M.mahafaliensis, but unlike in M.aelleni and M.manavi, which have a flat palate. At the palate's back margin is a long, robust posterior palatal spine.|$|E
50|$|Several {{closely related}} species were {{formerly}} considered to be subspecies of the northern <b>crested</b> newt: the Italian <b>crested</b> newt (Triturus carnifex), the Danube <b>crested</b> newt (Triturus dobrogicus) and the southern <b>crested</b> newt (Triturus karelinii). These are now recognized as separate species of the Triturus cristatus species complex.|$|R

5|$|On the Continent, {{particularly}} Germany, crests have a {{far greater}} significance than in Britain, and {{it is common for}} one person to display multiple crests with his arms; certain high-ranking noblemen are entitled to as many as seventeen. This practice did not exist in Britain until the modern era, and arms with more than one <b>crest</b> are still rare. In contrast to Continental practice, where a <b>crest</b> is never detached from its helm, a Briton with more than one <b>crest</b> may choose to display only one crested helm, and have the other crests simply floating in space. Though usually adopted through marriage to an heiress, examples exist of secondary crests being granted as augmentations: after defeating the Americans at the Battle of Bladensburg, Robert Ross was granted, in addition to his original <b>crest,</b> the <b>crest</b> of an arm holding the US flag with a broken flagstaff.|$|E
5|$|Prieto and Böhme {{describe}} M2 as less rounded than M1 and De Bruijn {{notes that}} the crests are more parallel. In addition to the five main crests, small crests are present in front of and behind the centroloph that do not cover the full width of the tooth. In one S.bolligeri M2, {{there is a small}} <b>crest</b> on the lingual side in front of the centroloph, but such a <b>crest</b> does not occur in any S.alpinus. Another M2 of S.bolligeri has this <b>crest</b> on the labial side. On the other hand, all five M2 of S.alpinus have a minor <b>crest</b> on the labial side behind the centroloph. In two M2 of S.alpinus, the centroloph and the metaloph are connected by a longitudinal <b>crest,</b> which is never present in S.bolligeri. There are three roots.|$|E

5|$|Pteranodon was {{notable for}} its skull <b>crest,</b> though the {{function}} of this <b>crest</b> has been a subject of debate. Most explanations {{have focused on the}} blade-like, backward pointed <b>crest</b> of male P. longiceps, however, and ignored the wide range of variation across age and sex. The fact that the crests vary so much rules out most practical functions other than for use in mating displays. Therefore, display was probably the main function of the <b>crest,</b> and any other functions were secondary.|$|E

5|$|The club <b>crest</b> depicts an ox above a {{representation}} of a ford to symbolise the location. It reflects the name {{and history of the}} city, as Oxford was originally a market town situated near to a ford on the River Isis, which was used by cattle. In 2008, a bronze statue of an ox was unveiled outside of what would have been the west stand. It was subsequently vandalised in January 2011, being covered in pink paint and the club used the opportunity to raise money for a breast cancer charity. The shape and design of the <b>crest</b> has changed numerous times since it was first produced. When playing as Headington and {{during the early years of}} Oxford United, the <b>crest</b> included a full ox crossing the ford, as well as the initials H.U.F.C. (pre-1962) or the name Oxford United (post name-change). Between 1972 and 1980, the <b>crest</b> became circular, showing just the ox's head on a yellow and black background. The words 'Oxford United Football Club' were placed around the ox. For the next 17 years, the <b>crest</b> was simply the ox's head coloured blue, with various combinations of wording surrounding it. For example, in the 1987–88 season, the wording 25th Anniversary was placed under the <b>crest.</b> In 1996, the <b>crest</b> had a shield shape and contained the ox's head over the ford, on a yellow background. This version was retained until the move to the Kassam Stadium in 2001, when club steward Rob Alderman designed the current version. It has a similar design to the preceding <b>crest,</b> but the ox and ford are contained in a circle with a yellow background, with the remainder of the <b>crest</b> being coloured blue.|$|E
