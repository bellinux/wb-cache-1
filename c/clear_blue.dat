5|$|There are {{two main}} types of monsoons in the state. The {{southwest}} monsoon season is usually established in the later half of May or early June and ends in September. The prevailing wind flow is generally southwesterly and light, below 15 knots. The northeast monsoon season usually starts in early November and ends in March. During this season, steady easterly or northeasterly winds of 10 to 20 knots prevail. The winds over the east coast states of Peninsular Malaysia may reach 30 knots or more during periods of strong surges of cold air from the north (cold surges). The annual rainfall of this area is 2,911 millimetres. During the northeast monsoon season, Kuala Terengganu, being exposed to the coast, receives heavy rainfall. It is not advised to visit any of the offshore islands or participating in sea activities as the sea can be very rough. However, in some clear sunny days during the monsoon season, surprisingly east coast is always presented with <b>clear</b> <b>blue</b> sky and cooling wind.|$|E

According to classical rabbinical literature, the specific agate was of a sky-blue colour, and though Jacinth now refers to a red-tinted clear gem – the Jacinth – this wasn't the case at the time the Book of Revelation was written, and at that time Jacinth appears to have referred to a bluish gem; Pliny describes Jacinth as a dull and blueish amethyst, while Solinus describes it as a <b>clear</b> <b>blue</b> tinted gem – the modern Sapphire.|$|E
25|$|Weather turns quite {{warm with}} {{the start of}} March, with {{increasing}} humidity and intensity of sunshine. Highest temperature was recorded at 42'C in 2004 and then again in 2010. March is considered spring time in the city, when the skies are usually <b>clear</b> <b>blue</b> and W/SW breeze dominates, making the outdoors much pleasant. Western depressions can bring moderate to at times even heavy rainfall. In the recent years, Karachi has received quite heavy rainfall {{in the month of}} March, for instance on 18 March 1997, the city received 25mm rainfall from an overnight thunderstorm. On 11 March 2007, a strong western depression gave up to 35mm rainfall in the city, during which intermittent moderate to heavy rain continued in the metropolis from morning till midnight. On 19 March 2007, once again isolated heavy downpour lashed the city, in which the northern parts (North Karachi) received 53mm rainfall in less than an hour, while other areas received lesser precipitation. Most recently, on 13 March 2015, an overnight dose of heavy rain lashed mainly the southern and SE areas of the city. Between 10 and 15mm rainfall was recorded in these areas within 15 minutes. However, Gulshan-e-Hadeed observatory (located ESE of the metropolis in the outskirts), received 40mm downpour on the same night. The all-time high for the month was a mighty , recorded in 1967, which is March's highest rainfall for the city.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the keys}} to bowfishing is having a good visual of the target. In order to see the fish in the water on a sunny day, {{polarized}} sun glasses are helpful. They cut the glare on top of the water so it makes it easier to see what is below the surface. Different tints and lens colors {{make a difference in the}} color of water the hunter is fishing in, from darker brown to <b>clearer</b> <b>blue</b> and green. At night glasses are unnecessary, as lights are used to see through the water.|$|R
500|$|In 1970, {{while still}} a flight director, Lunney was {{selected}} {{as one of the}} members of a NASA delegation to the Soviet Union, which was to discuss the possibility of cooperation between the two countries in the field of manned spaceflight. [...] "For me it was out of the <b>clear</b> <b>blue</b> sky", said Lunney, who was told of the plans while at a conference in early October. [...] "I did not know anything about [...] until that time." [...] The trip took place in late October. While in Moscow, Lunney gave a presentation to Soviet engineers on the techniques that NASA used for orbital rendezvous, and on the compromises that would have to be made in order to achieve a rendezvous between American and Soviet spacecraft. The technical agreement that he helped to draft laid the groundwork for the mission which was to become the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (ASTP). It was intended to be a joint mission, whose highlight was to be a docking between an American Apollo spacecraft and a Soviet Soyuz.|$|E
500|$|Later in {{the same}} month, music website Popjustice {{announced}} that Stefani was going to release a single called [...] "Baby Don't Lie" [...] and it was set to premiere on October 6, 2014.

On October 18, 2014, the song leaked online, ahead of its premiere date, October 19, 2014. The same day, Stefani premiered the single's cover art through her social media. As stated by Jocelyn Vena, [...] "the coverart is a colorful piece of pop art," [...] with Stefani appear on it, in front of a <b>clear</b> <b>blue</b> sky, with bright yellow hair and neon pink lipstick, while holding a big gemstone up to her face.

500|$|Regarded {{as one of}} the RAAF's most skilful {{cross-country}} {{pilots and}} navigators, Eaton came to public attention as leader of three military expeditions to find lost aircraft in Central Australia between 1929 and 1931. In April 1929, he coordinated the Air Force's part in the search for aviators Keith Anderson and Bob Hitchcock, missing in their aircraft the Kookaburra while themselves looking for Charles Kingsford Smith and Charles Ulm, who had force landed the Southern Cross in north Western Australia during a flight from Sydney. Three of the RAAF's five [...] "ancient" [...] DH.9 biplanes went down in the search—though all crews escaped injury—including Eaton's, which experienced what he labelled [...] "a good crash" [...] on 21April near Tennant Creek after the engine's pistons melted. The same day, Captain Lester Brain, flying a Qantas aircraft, located the wreck of the Kookaburra in the Tanami Desert, approximately [...] east-south-east of Wave Hill. Setting out from Wave Hill on 23April, Eaton led a ground party across rough terrain that reached the crash site four days later and buried the crew, who had perished of thirst and exposure. Not a particularly religious man, he recalled that after the burial he saw a perfect cross formed by cirrus cloud in an otherwise <b>clear</b> <b>blue</b> sky above the Kookaburra. The Air Board described the RAAF's search as taking 240 hours flying time [...] "under the most trying conditions...where a forced landing meant certain crash". In November 1930, Eaton was selected to lead another expedition for a missing aircraft near Ayers Rock, but it was called off soon afterwards when the pilot showed up in Alice Springs. The next month, he was ordered to search for W.L. Pittendrigh and S.J. Hamre, who had disappeared in the biplane Golden Quest2 while attempting to discover Lasseter's Reef. Employing a total of four DH.60 Moths, the RAAF team located the missing men near Dashwood Creek on 7January 1931, and they were rescued four days later by a ground party accompanied by Eaton. Staying in nearby Alice Springs, he recommended a site for the town's new airfield, which was approved and has remained in use since its construction.|$|E

40|$|Photographic and {{photoelectric}} {{data obtained}} in 1969 have been combined {{to provide a}} relatively accurate and complete description of the so-called <b>blue</b> <b>clearing</b> phenomenon on Mars. The dark feature Syrtis Major and its surroundings {{are the subject of}} the present study. A series of comparison images of Mars in blue light was assembled to form a scale of <b>blue</b> <b>clearing.</b> The scale steps represent about the smallest readily recognizable difference in apparent contrast. The relationship between the scale number and the brightness of Syrtis Major as compared to its surroundings has been established microphotometrically. International Planetary Patrol Program photographs in blue light having Syrtis Major {{near the center of the}} disk were compared to the scale and assigned a value. The results indicate that the <b>blue</b> <b>clearing</b> of Syrtis Major was strongly dependent upon phase angle in 1969, reaching a maximum at opposition. Syrtis Major displayed a diurnal variation of <b>blue</b> <b>clearing</b> near opposition. This variation disappeared away from opposition...|$|R
