5|$|Butterfly larvae, or <b>caterpillars,</b> consume plant {{leaves and}} spend {{practically}} {{all of their}} time searching for and eating food. Although most <b>caterpillars</b> are herbivorous, a few species are predators: Spalgis epius eats scale insects, while lycaenids such as Liphyra brassolis are myrmecophilous, eating ant larvae.|$|E
5|$|<b>Caterpillars</b> of the Australian cup moth species Xylorycta strigata eat {{the leaves}} and make burrows in the wood. The plant also hosts <b>caterpillars</b> of the cup moth species Mecytha fasciata.|$|E
5|$|Myrmecophilous (ant-loving) <b>caterpillars</b> of the {{butterfly}} family Lycaenidae (e.g., blues, coppers, or hairstreaks) are herded by the ants, led to feeding {{areas in the}} daytime, and brought inside the ants' nest at night. The <b>caterpillars</b> have a gland which secretes honeydew when the ants massage them. Some <b>caterpillars</b> produce vibrations and sounds that are perceived by the ants. A similar adaptation {{can be seen in}} Grizzled skipper butterflies that emit vibrations by expanding their wings in order to communicate with ants, which are natural predators of these butterflies. Other <b>caterpillars</b> have evolved from ant-loving to ant-eating: these myrmecophagous <b>caterpillars</b> secrete a pheromone that makes the ants act as if the caterpillar is one of their own larvae. The caterpillar is then taken into the ant nest where it feeds on the ant larvae.|$|E

5|$|Omphalea, {{like many}} {{other members of the}} Euphorbiaceae, {{possesses}} leaf nectaries that attract polistine wasps, which are predators of early instar <b>caterpillars.</b> The leaf nectaries also attract ants. The ants usually protect their host plant, eating both the nectar and plant-eating insects on it. However, they generally completely ignore Chrysiridia <b>caterpillars,</b> making it likely that the <b>caterpillars</b> possess a chemical deterrent as a primary defence. This chemical deterrent comes from the host plants. Omphalea species contain polyhydroxy alkaloids potentially sequestered or excreted by the caterpillar, the pupa and the adult moth.|$|E
5|$|Some insects {{display a}} {{rudimentary}} sense of numbers, {{such as the}} solitary wasps that prey upon a single species. The mother wasp lays her eggs in individual cells and provides each egg {{with a number of}} live <b>caterpillars</b> on which the young feed when hatched. Some species of wasp always provide five, others twelve, and others as high as twenty-four <b>caterpillars</b> per cell. The number of <b>caterpillars</b> is different among species, but always the same for each sex of larva. The male solitary wasp in the genus Eumenes is smaller than the female, so the mother of one species supplies him with only five caterpillars; the larger female receives ten <b>caterpillars</b> in her cell.|$|E
5|$|A {{large number}} of species of {{families}} Saturniidae, Limacodidae and Megalopygidae have stinging <b>caterpillars</b> which have poisonous setae, also called urticating hairs, {{and in the case}} of Lonomia – a Brazilian saturniid genus – can kill a human due to its potent anticoagulant poison. <b>Caterpillars</b> of many taxa that have sequestered toxic chemicals from host plants or have sharp urticating hair or spines, display aposematic colouration and markings.|$|E

5|$|At {{first the}} moth {{was thought to}} be from China or Bengal, but was later found to be endemic to Madagascar. It is found {{throughout}} the year {{in most parts of the}} island, with peak populations between March and August, and smallest numbers between October and December. Females lay about 80 eggs under the leaves of Omphalea spp. The <b>caterpillars</b> are whitish-yellow with black spots and red feet and are covered in club-ended black setae. Silk spun from the mouth helps the <b>caterpillars</b> hold on to smooth leaves and climb back to the plant when they fall. After completing four instars, the <b>caterpillars</b> spin an open network cocoon. The pupal stage lasts from 17 to 23 days.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage {{is found}} in many butterflies. Some like the oakleaf {{butterfly}} and autumn leaf are remarkable imitations of leaves. As <b>caterpillars,</b> many defend themselves by freezing and appearing like sticks or branches. Others have deimatic behaviours, such as rearing up and waving their front ends which are marked with eyespots {{as if they were}} snakes. Some papilionid <b>caterpillars</b> such as the giant swallowtail (Papilio cresphontes) resemble bird droppings. Some <b>caterpillars</b> have hairs and bristly structures that provide protection while others are gregarious and form dense aggregations. Some species are myrmecophiles, forming mutualistic associations with ants and gaining their protection. Behavioural defences include perching and angling the wings to reduce shadow and avoid being conspicuous. Some female Nymphalid butterflies guard their eggs from parasitoidal wasps.|$|E
5|$|<b>Caterpillars</b> {{are also}} {{affected}} by a range of bacterial, viral and fungal diseases, and {{only a small percentage}} of the butterfly eggs laid ever reach adulthood. The bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis has been used in sprays to reduce damage to crops by the <b>caterpillars</b> of the large white butterfly, and the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana has proved effective for the same purpose.|$|E

5|$|Parasitoids {{lay their}} eggs on or {{in the body of}} an insect host, which is then used as a food for {{developing}} larvae. The host is ultimately killed. Most insect parasitoids are wasps or flies, and many have a very narrow host range. The most important groups are the ichneumonid wasps, which mainly use <b>caterpillars</b> as hosts; braconid wasps, which attack <b>caterpillars</b> and a wide range of other insects including aphids; chalcid wasps, which parasitize eggs and larvae of many insect species; and tachinid flies, which parasitize a wide range of insects including <b>caterpillars,</b> beetle adults and larvae, and true bugs.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{have shown}} that the P. rebeli <b>caterpillars</b> benefit most when they parasitize off of the Myrmica schencki ant colony than any other ant colony. When Myrmica ant colonies {{encounter}} a period of food shortage, more P. rebeli <b>caterpillars</b> survive than if this food shortage were to occur in any other species of ant colony. This is because the P. rebeli <b>caterpillars</b> have a lower social rank in other ant species compared to their social rank in the M. schencki ant colony. This phenomenon is seen during times of stress, when some of the hungry P. rebeli <b>caterpillars</b> secrete compounds to attract attention from the ant colony it has parasitized. While the M. schencki ants are still fooled into believing that the P. rebeli are of their own brood, these compounds do not mimic those of non-host species' societies in other ant species, and thus, results in the P. rebeli being identified as intruders and killed.|$|E
5|$|There is {{also much}} {{information}} about how the universe was thought to work stored in the mythology of the constellations. The Barasana of the Amazon plan part of their annual cycle based on observation of the stars. When their constellation of the Caterpillar-Jaguar (roughly equivalent to the modern Scorpius) falls they prepare to catch the pupating <b>caterpillars</b> of the forest as they fall from the trees. The <b>caterpillars</b> provide food at a season when other foods are scarce.|$|E

5|$|After {{locating}} the M. schnecki nest, the wasp enters only the nests that contain P. rebeli <b>caterpillars.</b> It {{is able to}} enter the nest without being swarmed because it releases a chemical that causes the worker ants to attack one another instead of concentrating all their efforts on the wasp. Once the wasp reaches the <b>caterpillars,</b> it marks the individuals most likely to survive by ovipositing in them. Once the wasp's eggs hatch from the caterpillar's body, the newborn offspring feast on the caterpillar's carcass.|$|E
5|$|Another {{analogous}} case {{within a}} single species has been termed Browerian mimicry (after Lincoln P. Brower and Jane Van Zandt Brower). This {{is a case of}} bipolar (only two species involved) automimicry; the model is the same species as its mimic. Equivalent to Batesian mimicry {{within a single}} species, it occurs when there is a palatability spectrum within a population of harmful prey. For example, monarch (Danaus plexippus) <b>caterpillars</b> feed on milkweed species of varying toxicity. Some feed on more toxic plants, and store these toxins within themselves. The more palatable <b>caterpillars</b> thus profit from the more toxic members of the same species.|$|E
5|$|Butterflies {{have the}} typical four-stage insect life cycle. Winged adults lay eggs {{on the food}} plant on which their larvae, known as <b>caterpillars,</b> will feed. The <b>caterpillars</b> grow, {{sometimes}} very rapidly, and when fully developed, pupate in a chrysalis. When metamorphosis is complete, the pupal skin splits, the adult insect climbs out, and after its wings have expanded and dried, it flies off. Some butterflies, especially in the tropics, have several generations in a year, while others have a single generation, and a few in cold locations may take several years to pass through their whole life cycle.|$|E

40|$|Harvesting of Chinese <b>caterpillar</b> fungus, one of {{the most}} {{expensive}} biological commodities in the world, has become an important livelihood strategy for mountain communities of Nepal. However, very little is known about the role of Chinese <b>caterpillar</b> fungus in household economy. We estimated the economic contribution of Chinese <b>caterpillar</b> fungus to the household income, quantified the extent of "Chinese <b>caterpillar</b> fungus dependence" among households with different economic and social characteristics, and assessed the role of cash income from the Chinese <b>caterpillar</b> fungus harvest in meeting various household needs including education, debt payments, and food security. Results show that Chinese <b>caterpillar</b> fungus income is the second largest contributor to the total household income after farm income with 21. 1 % contribution to the total household income and 53. 3 % to the total cash income. The contribution of Chinese <b>caterpillar</b> fungus income to total household income decreases as the household income increases making its contribution highest for the poorest households. There is significant correlation between Chinese <b>caterpillar</b> fungus dependency and percentage of family members involved in harvesting, number of food-sufficient months, and total income without Chinese <b>caterpillar</b> fungus income. Income from Chinese <b>caterpillar</b> fungus is helping the poorest to educate children, purchase food, and pay debts. However, reported decline of Chinese <b>caterpillar</b> fungus from its natural habitat might threaten local livelihoods that depend on the Chinese <b>caterpillar</b> fungus in future. Therefore, sustainable management of Chinese <b>caterpillar</b> fungus through partnership among local institutions and the state is critical in conserving the species and the sustained flow of benefits to local communities...|$|R
