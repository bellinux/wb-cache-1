When leftist singer Paul Robeson was denied a passport in 1950, {{even though he}} was not accused of any illegal acts, the ACLU chose to not defend him. The ACLU later reversed their stance, and supported William Worthy and Rockwell Kent in their passport confiscation cases, which resulted in legal victories in the late 1950s.|$|E
5|$|From Rosendale, NY32 {{climbs up}} out of the Rondout valley and veers east into the hamlet of Maple Hill, where it crosses over the Thruway once again. It resumes a northerly <b>course</b> <b>through</b> Bloomington, and several miles further on crosses the Kingston city line.

5|$|M-21 is an east–west state {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the US state of Michigan connecting {{the cities of}} Grand Rapids and Flint. The highway passes through rural farming country and several small towns along its <b>course</b> <b>through</b> the Lower Peninsula. Following {{the course of a}} handful of rivers, M-21 also connects some of the state's freeways like Interstate 96 (I-96), US Highway 127 (US127) and I-75. The highway is used by between1,700 and 36,000vehicles daily.|$|E

5|$|NY22 {{continues}} past Sciota in {{a fairly}} straight north-northwesterly <b>course</b> <b>through</b> more woods with small home and farm clearings.

No deaths in Yap or Palau were reported due to Ewiniar.|$|E
5|$|After {{crossing}} into Greene County, {{the road}} intersects NY23A at an undeveloped junction. NY32 remains in its straight <b>course</b> <b>through</b> the lowlands below the escarpment, passing through mostly woodlands and the hamlet of Kiskatom, then winding around {{the north side}} of Cairo Roundtop before it joins with NY23 at Cairo. After , NY32 leaves the divided highway to once again strike north as a two-lane route. It trends west to its westernmost point until turning to the north-northeast just south of Freehold.|$|E

In July 1793 Rennie suggested further alterations to the route, including the construction of the Bruce Tunnel in the Savernake Forest.

5|$|In 1930, a {{group was}} created whose {{objective}} was to channel the Senne into subterranean tunnels for nearly its entire <b>course</b> <b>through</b> the Brussels metropolitan area. This was done in order to expand the benefits that the covering achieved in the old city. In the centre, {{the course of the}} river was to be changed from the central boulevards to the peripheral boulevards of the small ring. The project, delayed by war and the work being done on the North–South connection, was only finished in 1955.|$|E
5|$|In {{both the}} Poetic Edda and the Prose Edda she is {{described}} as the sister of the personified moon, Máni, {{is the daughter of}} Mundilfari, is at times referred to as Álfröðull, and is foretold to be killed by a monstrous wolf during the events of Ragnarök, though beforehand she will have given birth to a daughter who continues her mother's <b>course</b> <b>through</b> the heavens. In the Prose Edda, she is additionally described as the wife of Glenr. As a proper noun, Sól appears throughout Old Norse literature. Scholars have produced theories about the development of the goddess from potential Nordic Bronze Age and Proto-Indo-European roots.|$|E

The crew of an alternative Enterprise realise what is happening and seek to return him to his own reality, but, after an attack by a Bajoran ship, a space-time fissure explodes, causing hundreds of thousands of alternative versions of the Enterprise to enter the same universe. After Worf reverses the <b>course</b> <b>through</b> the fissure, he and all the versions of the Enterprise are returned to their respective universes.|$|E
5|$|The path {{crosses the}} harbour on the St Mawes Ferry and then passes St Anthony Head and Zone Point and northwards past {{the village of}} Portscatho and around Gerrans Bay. Beyond Nare Head is Portloe in Veryan Bay. The next big {{headland}} is Dodman Point after which the coast path resumes its northwards <b>course</b> <b>through</b> Gorran Haven and the fishing harbour at Mevagissey to Pentewan where the once busy dock has silted up with sand. The path then climbs up around Black Head to reach Porthpean and then Charlestown. This was the first harbour to serve the china clay industry around St Austell and has featured in several films as {{it is home to}} a heritage fleet of sailing ships.|$|E
5|$|The property's {{original}} {{area was}} 2acres (8,000 m²), {{but this was}} reduced by about half around 1830 when the Pennsylvania Canal (North Branch Division) was dug through the house's front yard, {{between the house and}} river. On May 31, 1860, the Lackawanna and Bloomsburg Railroad opened with a train from Danville. This was the second railroad track in Northumberland, and ran behind the house. The canal closed in 1902 and was later filled in. The modern railroad line approximates the canal's <b>course</b> <b>through</b> the front yard; the track behind the house no longer exists.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm Bret was {{the deadliest}} natural {{disaster}} in Venezuela since the 1967 Caracas earthquake. The third tropical cyclone of 1993 Atlantic hurricane season, Bret formed on August4 from a westward-moving, African tropical wave. Bret would later peak as a 60mph (95km/h) tropical storm as it neared Trinidad. It took an extremely southerly <b>course</b> <b>through</b> the Caribbean, passing over {{the coasts of}} Venezuela and Colombia. High terrain in the northern parts of those countries severely disrupted the circulation of the storm, and Bret had weakened to a tropical depression before emerging over the extreme southwestern Caribbean Sea. There, it restrengthened to a tropical storm and made landfall in Nicaragua on August 10, dissipating soon after. Bret's remnants reached the Pacific Ocean, where they ultimately became Hurricane Greg.|$|E
5|$|Between {{the bridge}} and exit18, I-87 passes two rest areas, one for each direction. The road's northward <b>course</b> <b>through</b> Queensbury quickly brings it to the {{outskirts}} of Glens Falls, and as such the highway heads across another swath of residential neighborhoods. Exits18 and19 are the main exits for the city, with the latter connecting to NY254 near the commercial center of Queensbury. Just east of the exit is Aviation Mall, located on NY254 just west of the route's junction with US9. A northwestern turn in the freeway takes I-87 past the Great Escape amusement park and lodge, both of which are accessed from exit20 and NY149. Past exit20, I-87 runs across increasingly remote areas of Queensbury as the road enters Adirondack Park and heads toward Lake George. The freeway closely follows US9 northwest to the village of Lake George, where I-87 meets NY9N via exits21 and22.|$|E
5|$|In 1793 {{a further}} survey was {{conducted}} by John Rennie, and {{the route of the}} canal was altered to take a more southerly <b>course</b> <b>through</b> Great Bedwyn, Devizes, Trowbridge and Newbury. The proposed route was accepted by the Kennet and Avon Canal Company, chaired by Charles Dundas, and the company started to take subscriptions from prospective shareholders. In July 1793 Rennie suggested further alterations to the route, including the construction of a tunnel in the Savernake Forest. On 17 April 1794 the Kennet and Avon Canal Act received the Royal Assent and construction began. The Newbury to Hungerford section was completed in 1798, and was extended to Great Bedwyn in 1799. The section from Bath to Foxhangers was finished in 1804, and Devizes Locks were completed in 1810.|$|E
