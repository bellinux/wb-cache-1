40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to explain the apparent discrepancies often reported in the literature between E and L values, two parameters obtained from isotopic exchange experiments and commonly used to quantify available soil phosphate. The E and L values of the surface horizons of 10 soils from tropical, mediterranean, and temperate regions were determined. The L value was measured from a 13 -wk pot experiment with <b>common</b> <b>bentgrass</b> (#Agrostis capillaris$ L.) where the available soil P was labeled with 32 PO 4 ions {{in the presence of a}} carrier (25 - 50 mg 31 P/kg soil). To determine the E value, the isotopic exchange kinetic experiment was carried out on each soil. Carrier-free 32 PO 4 was added to the soil-solution system at a steady state and the quantity of isotopically exchangeable soil phosphate at time t, E(t), was calculated from the kinetic equation describing the decrease of radioactivity in solution with time. Results showed that L values determined after 13 wk were not significantly different from E(t) values extrapolated to the same period (t = 131 040 min). It was concluded that the L value is a particular point of the kinetic equation and isotopically exchangeable phosphate is the available P for <b>common</b> <b>bentgrass.</b> A strict equality between E(13 wk) and L values was not, however, reached for all samples. Possible causes for the differences were : an overestimation of the water-soluble phosphate due to the presence of silica and disturbance of the steady state following a too large uptake of phosphate by the crop or the application of too large quantities of carrier compared with the initial quantity of exchangeable soil phosphate.

In areas where fire has been suppressed, coastal scrub plants invade. <b>Common</b> grasses include <b>bentgrass</b> (Agrostis spp.), California brome (Bromus carinatus), Nootka reedgrass (Calamagrostis nutkaensis), California oatgrass (Danthonia californica), red fescue (Festuca rubra), Idaho fescue (Festuca idahoensis), tufted hair-grass (Deschampsia caespitosa), prairie Junegrass (Koeleria macrantha), tall trisetuem (Trisetum canescens). Common forbs include Douglas iris (Iris douglasiana), western blue-eyed grass (Sisyrinchium bellum), hairy gumplant (Grindelia hirsutula), and footsteps of spring (Sanicula arctopoides).|$|R
