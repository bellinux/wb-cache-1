Like tensile strength, this is highly relevant in polymer applications involving the physical properties of polymers, such as rubber bands. The modulus {{is strongly dependent on}} temperature. Viscoelasticity describes a complex time-dependent elastic response, which will exhibit hysteresis in the stress-strain curve when the load is removed.

Image formation is given by the <b>complex</b> <b>modulus</b> of the incoming electron beams. As such, the image is not only dependent on the number of electrons hitting the screen, making direct interpretation of phase contrast images more complex.

A torsional transducer attached to an aluminum rod was immersed in a Kaolin sediment and driven in either a pulse-echo mode or a standing wave mode. Both techniques were found to be satisfactory and in good agreement over the limited frequency range (38 to 39 kHz) imposed by the characteristics of the transducer-rod combination.
