25|$|Another {{major concern}} {{is the lack of}} {{implementation}} of the Leahy Law in U.S. and the <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> in worsening the human rights situation in Mexico. Under this U.S. law, no member or unit of a foreign security force that is credibly alleged to have committed a human rights violation may receive U.S. security training. It is alleged that the U.S., by training the military and police force in Mexico, is in violation of the Leahy Law. In this case, the U.S. embassy officials in Mexico in charge of human rights and drug control programs are blamed with aiding and abetting these violations. In December 1997, a group of heavily armed Mexican special forces soldiers kidnapped twenty young men in Ocotlan, Jalisco, brutally torturing them and killing one. Six of the implicated officers had received U.S. training as part of the Grupo Aeromóvil de Fuerzas Especiales (GAFE) training program.|$|E

25|$|Poincaré's attempt of a four-dimensional {{reformulation}} {{of the new}} mechanics was not continued by himself, so it was Hermann Minkowski (1907), {{who worked}} out the <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> notion (other contributions were made by Roberto Marcolongo (1906) and Richard Hargreaves (1908)). This {{was based on the}} work of many mathematicians of the 19th century like Arthur Cayley, Felix Klein, or William Kingdon Clifford, who contributed to group theory, invariant theory and projective geometry. Using similar methods, Minkowski succeeded in formulating a geometrical interpretation of the Lorentz transformation. He completed, for example, the concept of four vectors; he created the Minkowski diagram for the depiction of space-time; he was the first to use expressions like world line, proper time, Lorentz invariance/covariance, etc.; and most notably he presented a four-dimensional formulation of electrodynamics. Similar to Poincaré he tried to formulate a Lorentz-invariant law of gravity, but that work was subsequently superseded by Einstein's elaborations on gravitation.|$|E

In 1865, James Clerk Maxwell proposed that light was an electromagnetic wave, and therefore travelled at the speed [...] appearing in his theory of electromagnetism. [...] In 1905, Albert Einstein postulated that {{the speed of light}} [...] with respect to any inertial frame is a constant and is independent of the motion of the light source. He explored the <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> postulate by deriving the theory of relativity and in doing so showed that the parameter [...] had relevance outside of the context of light and electromagnetism.|$|E

He also disputed reports of his drinking, saying that he [...] " [...] it a practice to drink but very little". Bessels was questioned about Hall's cause of death. Bessels stated that [...] "My idea of the cause of the first attack is that he had been exposed to very low temperature during the time that he was on the sledge journey. He came back and entered a warm cabin without taking off his heavy fur clothing, and then took a warm cup of coffee. And anyone knows what the <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> might be."

2500|$|Euphorion, Negoiţescu's {{failed project}} for a {{literary}} magazine, was also his stated attempt at producing a modernist literary manifesto. Placing his references in German Romanticism and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's Faust, the critic found the tragic figure of Euphorion (in [...] ) {{as an ideal}} image of [...] "all things new on a spiritual level". The core idea, occasionally paraphrased as Euphorionism, was defined by Negoiţescu himself {{in terms of an}} Apollonian and Dionysian opposition, with a preference for the former term, and in combination with [...] "modern Faustianism, that is to say dynamism, imprudent haste." [...] Seeing in Euphorion a victim of preference for the chaotically modern elements of his own dual nature, and indicating that Goethe had initially intended to give his character a happier and more balanced existence, the theorist stated: [...] "I shall propose as a goal that initial Euphorion [...] All contemporary Romantic decadence, the signs of crisis and disaster, such as Naturalism and Surrealism etc., are <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> tear within Euphorion's being.
