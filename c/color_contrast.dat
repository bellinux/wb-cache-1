25|$|There {{is a close}} {{association}} between Metzinger's Baigneuses (Bathers) and Picasso's 1908 Paysage aux deux figures (Landscape with Two Figures). Both stances are verbalized with the same abstract vocabulary. In both cases, the figures are camouflaged or blended with the background, their bodies forming part of the landscape. These works were completed {{at a time when}} Metzinger frequented the Bateau Lavoir in Montmartre, where he may have seen Picasso's painting. There are differences, too, worth noting between the two works (aside from the size and colors which are unknown in the Metzinger case). While the dominant feature of Picasso's painting is the landscape, Metzinger chose to highlight the figures; the landscape playing only a secondary role in the overall composition. Metzinger's figures are much larger relative to the canvas. They are prominently and symmetrically displayed, and of lighter <b>color</b> <b>contrast</b> relative to Picasso's asymmetrical juxtaposition and subdued contrasting. Two of Metzinger's nudes—to the right and left of the dominant central figures—are quite inconspicuous, as in Picasso's piece. In both paintings the nudes and landscape have become unified, not presuming a representation of reality.|$|E

25|$|Light debris {{outside of}} Iapetus's orbit, either knocked {{free from the}} surface of a moon by micrometeoroid impacts or created in a collision, would spiral in as its orbit decays. It would have been darkened by {{exposure}} to sunlight. A portion of any such material that crossed Iapetus's orbit would have been swept up by its leading hemisphere, coating it; once this process created a modest contrast in albedo, and so a contrast in temperature, the thermal feedback described above would have come into play and exaggerated the contrast. In support of the hypothesis, simple numerical models of the exogenic deposition and thermal water redistribution processes can closely predict the two-toned appearance of Iapetus. A subtle color dichotomy between Iapetus's leading and trailing hemispheres, with the former being more reddish, can in fact be observed in comparisons between both bright and dark areas of the two hemispheres. In contrast to the elliptical shape of Cassini Regio, the <b>color</b> <b>contrast</b> closely follows the hemisphere boundaries; the gradation between the differently colored regions is gradual, on a scale of hundreds of km. The next moon inward from Iapetus, chaotically rotating Hyperion, also has an unusual reddish color.|$|E

500|$|While {{discussing}} the game's visual elements and art direction, developers revealed {{that they used}} several locations on Earth, such as the Yemeni islands of Socotra, lagoon archipelagos of Polynesia, and central Sahara as sources of inspiration. The team also worked with science fiction novelist Laurent Genefort to create the game's world. Bruno Gentile, Art Director of From Dust, stated that the world possessed strong visual contrasts, with [...] "rich and swarming life full of weird shapes and colors". Inhabitants of From Dust wear masks, which serve as a motif representing mystery and uniqueness. Gentile commented that after the developers researched African and New Guinean tribes, one of Ubisoft Montpellier's concept artists developed {{the idea of a}} large mask, constructed from nacre. Chahi remarked that the team had drawn inspiration from various musical instruments, especially slit drums used on the Vanuatu islands, and indicated that music was [...] "a key part in the gameplay and design". While tribes do not develop technologically, the team decided that their culture would evolve as they discovered [...] "their world and their past". The game utilizes a rich color palette, which allowed the team to create strong <b>color</b> <b>contrast</b> and to [...] "express the beauty of nature".|$|E

Blanc's book was directed at artists and art connoisseurs. Because of color's emotional significance to him, he made explicit recommendations that were close to the theories later adopted by the Neoimpressionists. He said that color should not be based on the [...] "judgment of taste", but rather it should be close to what we experience in reality. Blanc did not want artists to use equal intensities of color, but to consciously plan and understand the role of each hue in creating a whole.|$|E
2500|$|In V1 {{the simple}} three-color {{segregation}} begins to break down. Many cells in V1 respond to {{some parts of}} the spectrum better than others, but this [...] "color tuning" [...] is often different depending on the adaptation state of the visual system. A given cell that might respond best to long wavelength light if the light is relatively bright might then become responsive to all wavelengths if the stimulus is relatively dim. Because the color tuning of these cells is not stable, some believe that a different, relatively small, population of neurons in V1 is responsible for color vision. These specialized [...] "color cells" [...] often have receptive fields that can compute local cone ratios. Such [...] "double-opponent" [...] cells were initially described in the goldfish retina by Nigel Daw; their existence in primates was suggested by David H. Hubel and Torsten Wiesel and subsequently proven by Bevil Conway. As Margaret Livingstone and David Hubel showed, double opponent cells are clustered within localized regions of V1 called blobs, and are thought to come in two flavors, red–green and blue–yellow. Red–green cells compare the relative amounts of red–green in one part of a scene with the amount of red–green in an adjacent part of the scene, responding best to local <b>color</b> <b>contrast</b> (red next to green). Modeling studies have shown that double-opponent cells are ideal candidates for the neural machinery of color constancy explained by Edwin H. Land in his retinex theory.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a use case of contextually guided Bayesian feature integration {{implemented in the}} attention modeling framework JAMF. Modeling efforts were inspired by an eye-tracking study which was conducted {{within the scope of}} the author’s Bachelor’s thesis project. This study examined the correlation of <b>color</b> <b>contrasts</b> and human fixation behavior in a paradigm showing jungle images in different conditions of color-rotation. Originally, found effects were to be modeled {{in the context of the}} present thesis. Unfortunately, fixation data analysis yielded no constant effects of <b>color</b> <b>contrasts</b> across conditions. However, when fruits were depicted in the presented stimuli, high effects sizes were found. Thus, the contribution of <b>color</b> <b>contrasts</b> on fixations was guided by the context. The present study modeled such context-sensitive contribution of features to fixation selection in JAMF. However, due to the adherent high developmental work load, only a use case could be implemented as a proof that such modeling was possible. The employed model graph was a saliency map model which extracted feature maps and integrated them in a point-wise linear combination into a saliency map.
