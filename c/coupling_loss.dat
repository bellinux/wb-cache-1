50|$|To solve a {{noise and}} {{vibration}} problem with SEA, the system is partitioned {{into a number of}} components (such as plates, shells, beams and acoustic cavities) that are coupled together at various junctions. Each component can support a number of different propagating wavetypes (for example,the bending, longitudinal and shear wavefields in a thin isotropic plate). From an SEA point of view, the reverberant field of each wavefield represents an orthogonal store of energy and so is represented as a separate energy degree of freedom in the SEA equations. The energy storage capacity of each reverberant field is described by a parameter termed the 'modal density', which depends on the average speed with which waves propagate energy through the subsystem (the average group velocity), and the overall dimension of the subsystem. The transmission of energy between different wavefields at a given type of junction is described by parameters termed 'coupling loss factors'. Each <b>coupling</b> <b>loss</b> factor describes the input power to the direct field of a given receiving subsystem per unit energy in the reverberant field of a particular source subsystem. The <b>coupling</b> <b>loss</b> factors are typically calculated by considering the way in which waves are scattered at different types of junctions (for example, point, line and area junctions). Strictly, SEA predicts the average response of a population or ensemble of systems and so the <b>coupling</b> <b>loss</b> factors and modal densities represent ensemble average quantities. To simplify the calculation of the <b>coupling</b> <b>loss</b> factors it is often assumed that there is significant scattering within each subsystem (when viewed across an ensemble) so that direct field transmission between multiple connections to the same subsystem is negligible and reverberant transmission dominates. In practical terms, this means that SEA is often best suited for problems in which each subsystem is large compared with a wavelength (or from a modal point of view, each subsystem contains several modes in a given frequency band of interest). The SEA equations contain {{a relatively small number of}} degrees of freedom and so can be easily inverted to find the reverberant energy in each subsystem due to a given set of external input powers. The (ensemble average) sound pressure levels and vibration velocities within each subsystem can then be obtained by superimposing the direct and reverberant fields within each subsystem.|$|E

Their Janus laser started operation in 1974, and validated the approach of using Nd:glass lasers to generate very high power devices. Focusing problems were explored in the Long path laser and Cyclops laser, {{which led to the}} larger Argus laser. None of these were intended to be practical ICF devices, but each one advanced {{the state of the art}} to the point where there was some confidence the basic approach was valid. At the time it was believed that making a much larger device of the Cyclops type could both compress and heat the ICF targets, leading to ignition in the [...] "short term". This was a misconception based on extrapolation of the fusion yields seen from experiments utilizing the so-called [...] "exploding pusher" [...] type of fuel capsules. During the period spanning the years of the late '70s and early '80s the estimates for laser energy on target needed to achieve ignition doubled almost yearly as the various plasma instabilities and laser-plasma energy <b>coupling</b> <b>loss</b> modes were gradually understood. The realization that the simple exploding pusher target designs and mere few kilojoule (kJ) laser irradiation intensities would never scale to high gain fusion yields led to the effort to increase laser energies to the 100 kJ level in the UV and to the production of advanced ablator and cryogenic DT ice target designs.|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} of energy among the subsystems of a system {{can be found in}} terms of the modes of the system. If there are enough modes in the frequency band of interest then the system can be described by an SEA model. However, in general this is a "quasi-SEA" model, which involves both direct and indirect <b>coupling</b> <b>loss</b> factors, whose values depend on the modal overlap. This paper explores the conditions under which the indirect <b>coupling</b> <b>loss</b> factors are zero, so that the system is described by a "proper-SEA" model. It also investigates the dependence of the direct and indirect <b>coupling</b> <b>loss</b> factors on the modal properties of the system and on the modal overlap. In summary, the indirect <b>coupling</b> <b>loss</b> factors are zero, so that a proper-SEA model can be formed, either if all the system modes are local or in the weak coupling regime as the modal overlap becomes large. It is seen that in the low modal overlap limit the <b>coupling</b> <b>loss</b> factors are proportional to the damping loss factor and equipartition of energy only occurs if all modes are global. For higher modal overlap the SEA parameters depend on the detailed statistics of the modes and the situation is complicated. However, if all the modes are local the indirect <b>coupling</b> <b>loss</b> factors are all zero. In the high modal overlap limit the <b>coupling</b> <b>loss</b> factors asymptote to constants, with indirect <b>coupling</b> <b>loss</b> factors becoming zero. This behaviour occurs because of mode shape correlation at the boundary between two directly connected subsystems...|$|E
