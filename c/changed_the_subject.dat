5|$|Smith {{replied that}} in his {{interpretation}} Rhodesia was required to keep Whitehall informed, but prior British concurrence was not necessary; if Britain contested this, the Prime Minister said, then surely the 1957 entrustment had never meant anything. Dupont then spoke again, rejecting {{the idea that the}} Rhodesian mission should be a mere subsidiary consulate of the British Embassy. Hughes replied firmly that the 1957 despatch did not give the Rhodesians free rein over external matters, and warned them to be more flexible if they intended to find common ground. Eager to avoid open confrontation, Smith told Dupont to reconsider his tone, and <b>changed</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject.</b>|$|E
5|$|When Marseille {{returned}} to his unit he asked his friends Franzisket, Clade and Schr√∂er, whether they had heard {{what was happening to}} Jews and if perhaps something was underway {{that they did not know}} about. Franszisket recalled that he had heard Jews were being relocated to territory gained in the East but no more. Marseille recounted how he had attempted to ask questions about Jews who had vanished from his neighbourhood, including the family doctor that had delivered him at birth. Regardless of his hero status, when he attempted to bring the subject into any conversation with people who approached him, his enquiries were either met with awkward silences, or people <b>changed</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> or even turned away. Franzisket noticed a change in Marseille's attitude toward his nation's cause. He never spoke of this with his comrades again.|$|E
500|$|Aaliyah {{was known}} to avoid {{answering}} questions regarding R. Kelly following the professional split. During an interview with Christopher John Farley, she was asked if {{she was still in}} contact with him and if she would ever work with him again. Farley said Aaliyah responded with a [...] "firm, frosty" [...] 'No' to both of the questions. Vibe magazine said Aaliyah <b>changed</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> anytime [...] "you bring up the marriage with her". A spokeswoman for Aaliyah told the Chicago Sun-Times in 2000 that when [...] "R. Kelly comes up, she doesn't even speak his name, and nobody's allowed to ask about it at all". Kelly later commented that Aaliyah had opportunities to address the pair's relationship after they separated professionally but chose not to.|$|E

500|$|Gilmore {{participated in}} his second debate on May 15 in South Carolina {{broadcast}} by Fox News. His first question concerned the perceived growing threat of a nuclear armed Iran. Gilmore thanked the questioner {{on the basis that}} he believed the [...] "Middle East issue" [...] should be looked at beyond Iraq. He stated that as president he would join with American allies to put [...] "serious mandatory sanctions" [...] on the regime to let them know [...] "that it is better for them to give up this sort of plan (Nuclear proliferation)." [...] After receiving a question about Social Security, Gilmore <b>changed</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> to address his record of cutting taxes as Governor of Virginia. He would later attack fellow candidates: Rudy Giuliani for his pro-choice positions, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee for his record on taxes, and Mitt Romney for his position on health care. When asked about potential terrorist attacks, Gilmore reminded the audience that he was governor when The Pentagon was attacked on 9/11 and that he has [...] "the experience to deal with these issues." [...] At the end of the debate, Gilmore addressed the issue of race when asked why no minorities where present on the stage running for the presidency, he reacted to this question by declaring that the Republican Party has [...] "people that are prepared to [...] in the immediate future". He also cited his own credentials on race stating that as attorney general of Virginia he faced the issue when he {{had to deal with the}} burning of African-American churches, which gave him a good standing with the African-American community in his own judgment.|$|E
