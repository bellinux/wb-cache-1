In this thesis, we survey the field of Ramsey theory highlighting three of its main theorems (Ramsey 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>theorem</b> in Chapter 2, Schur 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>theorem</b> in Chapter 4, and Van DerWaerden 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>theorem</b> in Chapter 7), paying particular attention to Schur 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>theorem.</b> We discuss the origin (Chapter 5), proofs (Chapters 4 and 5), consequences (Chapter 6), and some generalizations (Chapter 8) of Schur 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>theorem.</b> Among generalizations we mention Rado and Szemerédi 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>theorems.</b> Special attention is also paid to upper and lower bounds for Schur numbers.
