5000|$|H T Christsen Pty Ltd {{operated}} {{their own}} Bundaberg Rum bottling plant in Bourbong Street, Bundaberg {{at the rear}} of their large grocery and hardware business in the centre of town. The spirit was sold at UP and OP strength from their business. Spokesperson for the original family, Mr Rod Patch, recalls the origins of the shape of the current [...] "Bundy Bottle". It originated from the Bushells <b>Coffee</b> <b>Chicory</b> bottle that Bundaberg folks sold to his grandfather at the firm for one penny a bottle, after which they were washed and filled with the famous spirit. The shape remains the same but the capacity has been increased to the current 700ml. Patch's great grandfather, Hans Truval Christsen, a Danish immigrant from Copenhagen and his son Frederick Christsen had an employment policy of employing staff from the Salvation Army faith in the rum bottling process as they {{were less likely to be}} tempted to sample the spirit. The Christsen family supported settlement farming families through hard times and these good deeds were acknowledged with the naming of Christsen Park at Bargara Beach.In 1961, the company introduced the polar bear as its unusual choice of mascot, to imply that the rum could ward off the coldest chill.|$|E

The plant was introduced to more than 52 countries, from this ‘centre of origin’. ” Instant coffee is a beverage prepared by various processes in which again it is dehydrated into the form of powder or granules. These can be rehydrated with hot water to provide a drink similar (though not identical) to conventional <b>coffee.</b> <b>Chicory,</b> used as a coffee substitute and additive with other adulterants like sugar beet and mustard seeds used as an ingredient of the mixed coffee, introduced during the coffee crisis happened in 1976 - 79. According to traditional folklore, long-term use of chicory as a coffee substitute may damage human retinal tissue, with dimming of vision over time and other long term effects. Similarly, copper salts are being used commonly as an eradicant and protectant against a fungus. Therefore there is an urgent need of detecting the copper bioconcentration in the samples, hence present problem has been sorted out and {{it was found that}} no absorption or the uptake of the salt by the plant and ultimate crop or its allied product is safe for human consumption...|$|E

40|$|International audienceProtective {{effects of}} plant {{polyphenol}} intake on cardiovascular {{morbidity and mortality}} are widely acknowledged. Caffeine-free <b>chicory</b> <b>coffee</b> is {{a rich source of}} plant phenolics, including caffeic acid, which inhibits in vitro platelet aggregation, and also phenylpyruvate tautomerase enzymatic activity of the proinflammatory cytokine, macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF). To assess whether <b>chicory</b> <b>coffee</b> consumption might confer cardiovascular benefits we performed a clinical intervention study with 27 healthy volunteers, who consumed 300 mL <b>chicory</b> <b>coffee</b> every day for one week. The dietary intervention produced variable effects on platelet aggregation, depending on the inducer used for the aggregation test. Whole blood and plasma viscosity were both significantly decreased, along with serum MIF levels, after one week of <b>chicory</b> <b>coffee</b> consumption. Moreover, significant improvements were seen in red blood cell deformability. No changes in hematocrit, fibrinogen level or red blood cell counts were detected. The full spectrum of these effects is unlikely to be attributable to a single compound present in <b>chicory</b> <b>coffee,</b> nevertheless, the phenolics, including caffeic acid, are expected to play a substantial role. In conclusion, our study offers an encouraging starting-point to delineate the antithrombotic and antiinflammatory effects of phenolic compounds found in <b>chicory</b> <b>coffee...</b>|$|R

5000|$|The chicory {{plant is}} one of the {{earliest}} cited in recorded literature. Horace mentions it in reference to his own diet, which he describes as very simple: [...] "Me pascunt olivae, me cichorea, me malvae" [...] ("As for me, olives, endives, and mallows provide sustenance"). In 1766, Frederick the Great banned the importation of coffee into Prussia leading {{to the development of a}} coffee-substitute by Brunswick innkeeper Christian Gottlieb Förster (died 1801), who gained a concession in 1769/70 to manufacture it in Brunswick and Berlin. By 1795 there were 22 to 24 factories of this type in Brunswick. Lord Monboddo describes the plant in 1779 as the [...] "chicoree", which the French cultivated as a pot herb. In Napoleonic Era France, chicory frequently appeared as either an adulterant in coffee, or as a <b>coffee</b> substitute. <b>Chicory</b> was also adopted as a coffee substitute by Confederate soldiers during the American Civil War, and has become common in the United States. It was also used in the United Kingdom during the Second World War, where Camp Coffee, a <b>coffee</b> and <b>chicory</b> essence, has been on sale since 1885.|$|R
50|$|During {{the nineteenth}} century, {{the poor people}} drank little else but water (of poor quality), {{sometimes}} watery <b>coffee</b> (or <b>chicory)</b> or tea. In some areas hot chocolate was consumed, but the most popular drinks (beside water) were beer and jenever. For most of the century beer was drunk in the southern part, where Catholicism dominated, and in Catholic enclaves in the other areas. Jenever consumption early {{in the nineteenth century}} was twice that of the equivalent consumption of distilled in neighboring countries.|$|R

50|$|In the USA, Vietnamese-style {{coffee is}} {{sometimes}} confused with that brewed in Louisiana with French roast <b>coffee</b> with <b>chicory.</b> Vietnamese immigrants {{who came to}} the state in the late 20th century adopted New Orleans-style coffee because they were unable to get Vietnamese-grown coffee. The French roast style popular in Louisiana was similar to Vietnamese coffee in its relatively coarse grind; therefore it made an excellent substitute for traditional brewing in the single-serving filter/brewer. In Vietnam, however, locally produced coffees are characterized by medium roast and don't contain chicory.|$|R

50|$|Iced {{coffee can}} be made from cold brew coffee, where coffee grounds are soaked {{overnight}} and then strained. Prior to the commercialization of cold brewers, consumers took the matter into their own hands, cold-brewing an iced coffee concentrate by soaking ground <b>coffee</b> and <b>chicory</b> with water in a mayonnaise jar. The next day, the grounds would be filtered out. The result was a very strong coffee concentrate that was mixed with milk and sweetened. This sweeter, creamier form of iced coffee is the type commonly found in New Orleans, Louisiana, at local coffee chains such as CC's Coffee House.|$|R

60|$|RECIPE FOR GERMAN COFFEE Take {{a barrel}} of water {{and bring it to}} a boil; rub a chicory berry against a coffee berry, then convey the former into the water.

Now unharness the remains of a once cow from the plow, insert them in a hydraulic press, and when you shall have acquired a teaspoon of that pale-blue juice which a German superstition regards as milk, modify the malignity of its strength in a bucket of tepid water and ring up the breakfast.
