5|$|Look, I'm sorry you're dead OK? I do care. But to be {{perfectly}} honest with you, I don't <b>care</b> <b>a</b> lot. You had a choice, you took the drugs, you died.

So sticking your head in a crocodile you were told about is not calculated to get my sympathy.|$|E
5|$|In September 1998, Baker left state {{government}} and became CEO of Harvard Vanguard Medical Associates, a New England–based physicians' group. In May 1999, {{he was named}} president and CEO of Harvard Vanguard's parent company, Harvard Pilgrim Health <b>Care,</b> <b>a</b> non-profit health benefits organization. The company had lost $58 million in 1998 and was predicted to lose over $90 million in 1999. Baker responded by cutting the workforce by 90 people, increasing premiums, establishing new contracts with Massachusetts physicians, reassessing the company's financial structure, and outsourcing its information technology. During his tenure as CEO, the company had 24 profitable quarters {{in a row and}} earned recognition from the National Committee for Quality Assurance as its choice for America's Best Health Plan for five straight years.|$|E

5|$|The ballad Master McGrath {{concerns}} a greyhound {{of that name}} from Lurgan which became an Irish sporting hero. The dog was bought in Lurgan by the Brownlow family, and the song also mentions his owner Charles Brownlow, {{referred to in the}} lyrics as Lord Lurgan. Master McGrath won the Waterloo Cup hare coursing competition three times in 1868, 1870 and 1871 at a time when this was a high-profile sport. A post mortem found that he had a heart twice the size of what is normal for a dog of his size. He is remembered all over the town, including in its coat of arms. The dog was named McGrath after the kennel boy responsible for its <b>care.</b> <b>A</b> statue of him was unveiled at Craigavon Civic Centre in 1993, over 120 years after his last glory in 1871. The statue was relocated to Lurgan town centre in 2013. A festival is also held yearly in his honour. A Lurgan pub was also named after Master McGrath, although it has been renamed in recent years.|$|E

5|$|The cost of {{hospice care}} may {{be met by}} health {{insurance}} providers, including Medicare or Medicaid for eligible Americans. Hospice is covered 100% with no co-pay or deductible by Medicare Part A except that patients are responsible for a copay for outpatient drugs and respite care, if needed. (Respite care may be necessary, for instance, if a family member who is providing home hospice care is briefly unable to perform his or her duties and an alternative care provider becomes necessary.) As of 2008, Medicare was responsible for around 80% of hospice payments, reimbursing providers differently from county to county with a higher rate for inpatient hospice <b>care.</b> <b>A</b> lower rate is paid for home care, with a higher rate paid for round-the-clock nursing care {{in order to get}} a patient's symptoms under control.|$|E
5|$|Tierney first ran for Congress in 1994 against one-term Republican {{incumbent}} Peter G. Torkildsen, {{having won}} a competitive Democratic primary with {{a plurality of}} 33.8 percent. He ran on a platform promoting a stronger federal focus on drug abuse, federal aid to promote after-school programs, consideration of means testing for Social Security, and single-payer health <b>care.</b> <b>A</b> primary issue in the campaign was crime: Tierney criticized Torkildsen for his vote against a 1994 crime bill, and advocated stronger gun control, while Torkildsen criticized Tierney's positions on gun control and drug legalization. Tierney was defeated {{in the general election}} by 4%. Tierney successfully ran for Congress in 1996, defeating Torkildsen by a narrow margin and increasing his margin in a 1998 rematch. Over the next five elections, Tierney won with over 68% of the vote. In 2010, he faced a stronger challenge from Republican candidate Bill Hudak, after his wife Patrice was convicted of felony tax fraud; he won with 57% of the vote.|$|E
