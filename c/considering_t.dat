INTRODUCTION The use of multi-spectral data is rapidly gaining importance in many biomedical areas.

The acceleration of the expansion of the universe is due to the spatial expansion caused by the non-trivial force and which in turn might account for the presence of the dark energy.

Muscle and liver biopsies were considered for respiratory chain studies, {{but because of}} hypocitrullinemia, molecular analysis for maternally inherited Leigh syndrome was first performed, revealing in both siblings the mitochondrial DNA T 8993 G mutation (95 % heteroplasmy), allowing to avoid tissue biopsies. Hypocitrullinemia, an occasional finding in mitochondrial diseases, has been specifically associated with T 8993 G mutation. However, only few patients have been reported, and the prevalence of hypocitrullinemia in 8993 mitochondrial DNA mutations is unknown. In a small series of 16 Leigh syndrome patients, sensitivity and specificity of hypocitrullinemia (< or = 12 micromol/L) for 8993 mitochondrial DNA mutations were 66 % and 85 %, respectively. Although studies in larger cohorts are necessary, we suggest <b>considering</b> <b>T</b> 8993 G mutation early in the diagnostic evaluation of infantile mitochondrial diseases with hypocitrullinemia, which minimizes the need for invasive procedures associated with a small but nonnegligible risk of complications and incorrect diagnosis.

Then the algorithm will then add frequencies along the path until the capacity on every link is greater than the demand.

The case (i) shows how previous symptoms can contribute to the diagnosis of this illness, and (ii) elucidates current recommended diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to Whipple's disease. CASE PRESENTATION: A 71 -year-old Swiss man with a past history of 2 years of diffuse arthralgia was admitted for a possible endocarditis with severe aortic and mitral regurgitation. Serial blood cultures were negative. Our patient underwent replacement of his aortic and mitral valve by biological prostheses. T. whipplei was documented by polymerase chain reactions on both removed valves and on stools, as well as by valve histology. A combination of hydroxychloroquine and doxycycline was initiated as lifetime treatment followed by the complete disappearance of his arthralgia. CONCLUSIONS: This case report underlines the importance of <b>considering</b> <b>T.</b> whipplei as a possible causal etiology of blood culture-negative endocarditis.

40|$|Abstract. Recently, {{progress}} has been made in the analysis of the expand-ing direction of Gowdy spacetimes. The purpose of the present paper is to point out that some of the techniques used in the analysis can be applied to other problems. The essential equations in the case of the Gowdy spacetimes can be considered as a special case of a wider class of variational problems. Here we are interested in the asymptotic behaviour of solutions to this class of equations. Two particular members arise when considering the T 3 -Gowdy symmetric Einstein-Maxwell equations and when <b>considering</b> <b>T</b> 3 -Gowdy sym-metric IIB superstring cosmology. The main result concerns the rate of decay of a naturally defined energy. A subclass of the variational problems can be interpreted as wave map equations, and in that case one gets the following picture. The non-linear wave equations one ends up with have as a domain the positive real line in cartesian product with the circle. For each point in time, the wave map can thus be seen as a loop in some Riemannian manifold. As a consequence of the decay of the energy mentioned above, the length of the loop converges to zero at a specific rate. 1...|$|E
40|$|Critical {{readings}} of The Go-Between often relate its depiction of sexuality, class and gender to the symbolism {{with which the}} author is frequently identified. Such connections can be further illuminated by <b>considering</b> <b>T.</b> S. Eliot’s notion of the “mythical method”. Hartley’s narrator seems to make extensive use of a personalised version of the “method” advocated by the poet. Mapping his world onto the Zodiac, Leo’s use of the “mythical method” enables him – {{at least for a}} short while – to order and control his experience. Initially offering him the mastery he craves, this method eventually renders Leo more vulnerable to the dramas that unfold around him. Once the integrity of his mythic structure is threatened, Leo’s own disintegration is assured. Given his absolute faith in the Zodiac, Leo comes only belatedly to recognise a different mythic parallel at work in his life. This other doubling sees Leo’s fate twinned with that of Icarus. Eventually acknowledged by Leo himself, this figure demonstrates Hartley’s on going concern with both method and myth and therefore suggests that his narrative – like its central protagonist, can offer the reader a critical perspective on the workings of each.

This article offers a critical review of research on the T/V (tu/vous) choice in French, and an analysis of this alternation in terms of markedness, variation and change. While there is unique public interest in T/V as a sociolinguistic phenomenon, it is a subject that has paradoxically been under-represented in linguistics and sociolinguistics publications produced in France. Much of the research conducted on the topic has been carried out by scholars based in other countries, and this is characterised by a rich variety of disciplinary approaches. T/V in contemporary French is a non-probabilistic phenomenon and is therefore not a sociolinguistic variable, in the Labovian sense.
