5|$|After the referendum, {{the ballot}} for Quebec {{elections}} was redesigned {{to reduce the}} size of the space where voters <b>could</b> <b>indicate</b> their choice and the rules on allowable markings were relaxed, so that Deputy Returning Officers would have fewer grounds for rejecting ballots. The Quebec government also changed the Electoral Act so that voters would need to show a Canadian passport, Quebec drivers' licence or Quebec provincial health care card at the polling station for identification purposes in future elections.|$|E
5|$|At {{the eastern}} side of the pyramid, the {{remnants}} of brick walls <b>could</b> <b>indicate</b> the presence of a mortuary temple, but the archaeological traces are so tenuous that any closer examination and more precise reconstruction is impossible today. The same goes for the ruins of a building several hundred metres away from the pyramid, and which might have been the valley temple. If this was indeed a valley temple, its east-west orientation would be unique in all pyramid complexes.|$|E

5|$|Based on {{spectral}} evidence, Hygiea's {{surface is}} thought to consist of primitive carbonaceous materials {{similar to those found}} in carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. Aqueous alteration products have been detected on its surface, which <b>could</b> <b>indicate</b> the presence of water ice in the past which was heated sufficiently to melt. The primitive present surface composition would indicate that Hygiea had not been melted during the early period of Solar System formation, in contrast to other large planetesimals like 4 Vesta.|$|E
5|$|Callisto's leading {{hemisphere}} is less reflective {{than its}} trailing hemisphere, which <b>could</b> <b>indicate</b> {{that one of}} its sides has a higher surface temperature. On this darker, warmer side, sublimation rates of its icy surface would also be higher, causing more water vapor to be released into the atmosphere. This process would ultimately produce more hydrogen, which might explain the aforementioned variance in Callisto's atmospheric hydrogen levels.|$|E
5|$|Ganymede's {{surface is}} a mix of two types of terrain: very old, highly cratered, dark regions and {{somewhat}} younger (but still ancient), lighter regions marked with an extensive array of grooves and ridges. The dark terrain, which comprises about one-third of the surface, contains clays and organic materials that <b>could</b> <b>indicate</b> the composition of the impactors from which Jovian satellites accreted.|$|E

5|$|The {{presence}} of seals of Shepseskare in the oldest part of Neferefre's mortuary temple <b>could</b> <b>indicate</b> {{that the former}} also undertook construction works there. The evidence for such works is uncertain: these seals could have been placed on boxes which were later moved into the magazine rooms of the temple. For example, seals of Userkaf, Sahure and Neferirkare Kakai were {{also found in the}} temple, while these three pharaohs died before Neferefre's reign.|$|E
5|$|Cædwalla's {{departure}} in 688 {{appears to}} have led to instability {{in the south of}} England. Ine, Cædwalla's successor, abdicated in 726, and the West Saxon Genealogical Regnal List says that he reigned for thirty-seven years, implying his reign began in 689 instead of 688. This <b>could</b> <b>indicate</b> an unsettled period between Cædwalla's abdication and Ine's accession. The kingship also changed in Kent in 688, with Oswine, who was apparently a Mercian client, taking the throne; and there is evidence of East Saxon influence in Kent in the years immediately following Cædwalla's abdication.|$|E
5|$|In 1111, {{according}} to the eleventhfourteenth-century Annals of Inisfallen, Domnall mac Taidc seized the kingship of the Isles by force. This annal-entry is the only notice of Domnall's lordship in the Isles preserved by Irish sources. This <b>could</b> <b>indicate</b> that the chronicle's aforesaid account of the petitioning of Muirchertach is incorrectly dated, and actually refers to about 1111. However, {{the fact that the}} chronicle places the petitioning during a period of new-found Uí Briain dominance in the region, before Magnús' arrival in the Isles, and {{at about the same time}} as Amlaíb's death, suggests that the chronicle's chronology concerning these events is sound, and that Domnall's seizure of the kingship in 1111 was indeed a return to the Isles.|$|E

5|$|Ine's {{predecessor}} on {{the throne}} of Wessex was Cædwalla, {{but there is some}} uncertainty about the transition from Cædwalla to Ine. Cædwalla abdicated in 688 and departed for Rome to be baptized. According to the West Saxon Genealogical Regnal List, Ine reigned for 37 years, abdicating in 726. These dates imply that he did not gain the throne until 689, which <b>could</b> <b>indicate</b> an unsettled period between Cædwalla's abdication and Ine's accession. Ine may have ruled alongside his father, Cenred, for a period: there is weak evidence for joint kingships, and stronger evidence of subkings reigning under a dominant ruler in Wessex, not long before this time. Ine acknowledges his father's help in his code of laws, and there is also a surviving land-grant that indicates Cenred was still reigning in Wessex after Ine's accession.|$|E
5|$|It is {{conceivable}} that Ímar received some form of support from Knútr's son and successor in Britain, Haraldr Knútsson, King of England (died 1040). The latter was certainly in power when Ímar replaced Echmarcach, and an association between Ímar and Haraldr could explain why the Annals of Ulster reports the latter's death two years later. Ímar's reign lasted about eight years, {{and one of his}} first royal acts appears to have been the invasion of Rathlin Island within the year. The fact that he proceeded to campaign in the North Channel <b>could</b> <b>indicate</b> that Echmarcach had held power in this region before his acquisition of Mann and Dublin.|$|E
5|$|On September17, a {{hurricane}} {{was observed in}} the mid-Atlantic by the bark Phantom. Later that day, the Phantom sank, though all of the crew survived. They described {{the system as a}} 'perfect hurricane' with a lull around midnight on September17 before the wind changed direction and blew with even greater force than before. The hurricane continued travelling on a northwest track and between September22 and the night of September23 it was encountered by the Hudson, the City of Washington and the bark Lanark. The system weakened to a tropical storm early on September24 and dissipated later that day about 610mi (980km) east of Cape Race, Newfoundland. Until reanalysis, this storm was considered two separate systems, including in the 1995 study by Partagas and Diaz. However, they stated that further information <b>could</b> <b>indicate</b> a single storm.|$|E

30|$|The {{possible}} reason for participants’ good knowledge regarding {{the location of}} the prostate is that the Sesotho translation used in the questionnaire to refer to prostate and prostate cancer <b>could</b> have <b>indicated</b> to participants that the prostate is located in the pelvic area.|$|R

5|$|Teeth of Brachytarsomys mahajambaensis {{have been}} found at the sites of Antsingiavo, Belobaka, and Ambatomainty in northwestern Madagascar, which are late Pleistocene (126,000 to 10,000 years ago) and Holocene (less than 10,000 years ago) in age. Brachytarsomys is a rare element of the rodent fauna, which is {{dominated}} by multiple species of Eliurus and Macrotarsomys. Modern Brachytarsomys are large rats that live in trees and eat fruits at middle to high altitudes. The modern, dry environment in northwestern Madagascar is decidedly inhospitable to these animals, and they no longer occur there; the former presence of B.mahajambaensis <b>could</b> <b>indicate</b> that the region was more humid in the past.|$|E
5|$|The {{extent of}} Guðrøðr's {{authority}} in the Hebrides is unknown due to his apparent coexistence with Gilli, and to the uncertainty of Orcadian encroachment. Guðrøðr's successor is likewise uncertain. On one hand, {{he may have been}} succeeded by his son, Rǫgnvaldr (died 1004/1005). Although it is conceivable that either Gilli or Sigurðr capitalised on Guðrøðr's death, and extended their overlordship as far south as Mann, possible after-effects such as these are uncorroborated. Although it is possible that Gilli controlled the Hebrides whilst Guðrøðr ruled Mann, the title accorded to the latter on his death <b>could</b> <b>indicate</b> otherwise. If so, the chronology of Gilli's subordination to Sigurðr may actually date to the period after Rǫgnvaldr's death in 1004/1005.|$|E
5|$|The kingdom {{might never}} have been ruled jointly by Alberht and Beonna. It is {{generally}} accepted that Alberht and the later Æthelberht II, who ruled East Anglia {{until his death in}} 794, are different kings, but the historian D. P. Kirby has identified them as being one person. According to Kirby, Beonna might have ascended the throne in around 758 and the issuing of his coins <b>could</b> <b>indicate</b> that East Anglia broke free of Mercian domination for a time, so linking Beonna's reign with the eventual disintegration of Mercian hegemony that occurred after Æthelbald's death.|$|E

40|$|To allow rapid {{identification}} of toxic shock syndrome toxin- 1 (TSST- 1) -producing Staphylococcus aureus strains, a real-time PCR assay {{for the detection}} of the tst gene, which encodes TSST- 1, was developed. The assay was applied to S. aureus isolates from patients with Wegener's Granulomatosis (WG), as well as isolates that were classified as either community- (CA) or hospital-acquired (HA). No significant difference in the percentage of tst-positive strains was observed between isolates from WG patients and CA isolates (24 % and 25 %, respectively). In contrast, only 14 % of the HA isolates were tst-positive (p< 0. 05). Investigation of the clonal relationship between tst-positive CA and HA strains <b>could</b> <b>indicated</b> the recent emergence of a virulent S. aureus clone in the community...|$|R
