40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the response of}} self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) halos {{to the growth of}} galaxy potentials using idealized simulations, each run in tandem with standard collisionless Cold Dark Matter (CDM). We find a greater diversity in the SIDM halo profiles compared to the CDM halo profiles. If the stellar gravitational potential strongly dominates in the central parts of a galaxy, then SIDM halos can be as dense as CDM halos on observable scales. For extreme cases with highly compact disks core collapse can occur, leading to SIDM halos that are denser and <b>cuspier</b> than their CDM counterparts. If the stellar potential is not dominant, then SIDM halos retain constant density cores with densities far below CDM predictions. When a disk potential is present, the inner SIDM halo becomes more flattened in the disk plane than the CDM halo. These results are in excellent quantitative agreement with the predictions of Kaplinghat et al. (2014). We also simulated a galaxy cluster halo with a central stellar distribution similar to the brightest central galaxy of the cluster A 2667. A SIDM halo simulated with cross section over mass σ/m = 0. 1 cm^ 2 g^- 1 provides a good match to the measured dark matter density profile of A 2667, while an adiabatically-contracted CDM halo is denser and <b>cuspier.</b> The cored profile of the same halo simulated with σ/m = 0. 5 cm^ 2 g^- 1 is not dense enough to match A 2667. Our findings are in agreement with previous results that σ/m ≳ 0. 1 cm^ 2 g^- 1 is disfavored for dark matter collision velocities in excess of about 1500 km/s. More generally, the predictive cross-talk between baryonic potentials and SIDM density distributions offers new directions for constraining SIDM cross sections in massive galaxies where baryons are dynamically important.

Secular growth may explain not only the most distinct nuclear disks such as those in NGC 4486 A but also some of the disky distortions that are commonly seen in elliptical galaxies.

40|$|An {{estimate}} of the convergence radius of a simulated CDM halo is obtained {{under the assumption that}} the peak phase-space density in the system is set by discreteness effects that operate prior to relaxation. The predicted convergence radii are approximately a factor 2 larger than those estimated for numerical convergence studies. A toy model is used to study the formation of sheets of the cosmic web, from which DM haloes form later. This model demonstrates the interplay between phase mixing and violent relaxation that must also be characteristic of spherical collapse. In the limit that sheets contain arbitrarily many particles, it seems that power-law profiles are established in both distance and energy. When only a finite number of particles is employed, relaxation is prematurely terminated and the power laws are broken. In a given simulation, the sheets with the highest peak phase-space densities are those that form from the longest waves. Hence simulations with little small-scale power are expected to form the <b>cuspiest</b> haloes. Comment: 10 pages submitted to MNRA...|$|R

Assuming a gNFW profile for the dark matter halo and a spatially constant stellar-mass-to-light ratio Υ_ for the baryonic mass, we infer distributions for Υ_ consistent with IMFs that are heavier than the Milky Way's (with a global mean mismatch parameter relative to a Chabrier IMF μ_α c = 1. 80 ± 0. 14) and halo inner density slopes which span a large range but are generally <b>cuspier</b> than the dark-matter-only prediction (μ_γ' = 2. 01 _- 0. 22 ^+ 0. 19). We investigate possible reasons for overestimating the halo slope, including the neglect of spatially varying stellar-mas-to-light ratios and/or stellar orbital anisotropy, and find that {{a quarter of the}} systems prefer radially declining stellar-mass-to-light ratio gradients, but that the overall effect on our inference on the halo slope is small.

40|$|Cosmic voids are {{promising}} tools for cosmological tests {{due to their}} sensitivity to dark energy, modified gravity and alternative cosmological scenarios. Most previous studies {{in the literature of}} void properties use cosmological N-body simulations of dark matter (DM) particles that ignore the potential effect of baryonic physics. Using a spherical underdensity finder, we analyse voids using the mass field and subhalo tracers in the EAGLE simulations, which follow the evolution of galaxies in a Λ cold dark matter Universe with state-of-the-art subgrid models for baryonic processes in a (100 cMpc) ^ 3 volume. We study the effect of baryons on void statistics by comparing results with DM-only simulations that use the same initial conditions as EAGLE. When identifying voids in the mass field, we find that a DM-only simulation produces 24 per cent more voids than a hydrodynamical one due to the action of galaxy feedback polluting void regions with hot gas, specially for small voids with r_void< 10 Mpc. We find that the way in which galaxy tracers are selected has a strong impact on the inferred void properties. Voids identified using galaxies selected by their stellar mass are larger and have <b>cuspier</b> density profiles than those identified by galaxies selected by their total mass. Overall, baryons have minimal effects on void statistics, as void properties are well captured by DM-only simulations, {{but it is important to}} account for how galaxies populate DM haloes to estimate the observational effect of different cosmological models on the statistics of voids.

40|$|This thesis {{attempts}} to test several frameworks of non-Newtonian gravity {{in the context}} of galaxies and galaxy clusters. The theory most extensively discussed was that of Modiﬁed Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) with Galileon gravity, Emergent Gravity (EG) and Modiﬁed Gravity (MOG) mentioned to a lesser extent. Speciﬁcally, the main focus of this thesis was to determine whether MOND and MOND-like theories were compatible with galaxy cluster data, without the need to include cold dark matter. To do this, the paradigms of Extended MOND (EMOND), Generalised MOND (GMOND) and superﬂuid dark matter were investigated. The theories were outlined and applied to galaxy cluster data. The main ﬁndings of this were that EMOND and GMOND had some success with explaining galaxy cluster mass proﬁles, without requiring an additional dark matter component. The superﬂuid paradigm also enjoyed some success in galaxy clusters, which was expected as it behaves in a similar manner to the standard cold dark matter paradigm in cluster environments. However, the superﬂuid paradigm may have issues in the very centre of galaxy clusters due to the theory predicting constant density cores, whereas the cold dark matter paradigm predicts density cores which are <b>cuspier.</b> The EMOND paradigm was also tested against ultra-diffuse galaxy (UDGs) data as they appear in cluster environments, where EMOND becomes important. It was found that EMOND can reproduce the inferred mass of the UDGs, assuming they lie on the fundamental manifold (FM). The validity of the assumptions used to model the UDGs are discussed in the text. A two-body problem was also conducted in the Galileon gravity framework.

40|$|Recently {{a series}} of {{indications}} have been put forward suggesting the presence of two gamma-ray lines at 110 - 130 GeV (centered at 111 and 129 GeV). Signals of these lines have been observed toward the Galactic center, at some galaxy clusters and {{among some of the}} unassociated point sources of the 2 years Fermi catalogue. Such a combination of signals could be generated by dark matter annihilations in the main dark matter halo, its substructures and nearby galaxy clusters. We discuss in this work the consistency between the number of events observed at the line energies in the sky and the predictions using results from the Via Lactea II numerical simulation and extrapolations below its mass resolution, taking into account that the annihilation cross-section to the lines can be estimated from the Galactic center signal. We find that some extrapolations to small substructures can naturally account for the point sources signal, although the hypothesis of background only cannot be rejected. We also study the morphology of the gamma-ray sky at the 2 lines energies, testing different Galactic diffuse background models to account for interstellar medium uncertainties, and different assumptions on the DM diffuse component profile. We find from template fits that within reasonable diffuse background uncertainties the presence of a spherical halo component is preferred with <b>cuspier</b> dark matter halo profiles being preferable even from the full sky fit. We finally check the impact of a dark disk component, suggested by cosmological simulations that include baryons and find that thin dark disks can not be disfavored, thus possibly accounting for the preferentially closer to the Galactic disk distribution of the point sources lines signal.
