The conversion was dependent on the initial concentration of <b>cyclohexanone,</b> <b>and</b> was about 90 % after 48 h at concentrations of up to 0. 25 M but was decreased at higher concentrations.

Among the cyclic ketones tested, the highest degree of conversion was achieved for cyclopentanone (88 %) and the lowest for cyclooctanone (about 2 %). The effect of methyl substitution and position of substitution on the cycloketone was studied using <b>methylcyclohexanone</b> <b>and</b> it has shown to influence the conversion efficiency.

The effect of synthesis conditions including the Si/Al ratio, crystallization temperature and time, and the amount of HTAB added to the synthesis system on the final products was examined. The catalytic properties of the hierarchical zeolite were investigated in reactions of Claisen-Schmidt condensation of benzaldehyde and acetophenone, self-condensation of <b>cyclohexanone</b> <b>and</b> methanol conversion. The hierarchical zeolite exhibits superior catalytic performance in Claisen-Schmidt condensation of benzaldehyde and acetophenone <b>and</b> self-condensation of <b>cyclohexanone</b> <b>and</b> has a remarkably high selectivity for dimethyl ether in the methanol conversion reaction at relatively low temperatures, which was attributed to the fast mass transport in the three-dimensional hierarchical pore network.

40|$|IR spectroscopic measurements, with {{adsorption}} of <b>cyclohexanone</b> <b>and</b> cyclohexylamine, in {{the presence}} {{and in the absence}} of ammonia and oxygen, over amorphous silica calcined at different temperatures, were used in this study directed towards obtaining a. better understanding of the gas-phase ammoximation of cyclohexanone with molecular oxygen, amorphous silica being the catalyst. The results obtained substantially confirm the reaction network previously suggested on the basis of flow-reactor experiments. The catalyst was found to have unusual Bronsted acidity due to free and H-bonded silanols with a distribution of different acid strengths. The surface silanols were found to react with <b>cyclohexanone</b> <b>and</b> ammonia to produce the tautomeric forms of the cor-responding imine, these forms being thought to be bonded to the surface by Si-N bonds and to be intermediates for the production of the oxime and the tars.

40|$|The {{selective}} oxidation of cyclohexane to <b>cyclohexanone</b> <b>and</b> cyclohexanol {{with air}} over Au/Al 2 O 3, Au/TiO 2, and Au/SBA- 15 catalysts was investigated and {{compared with the}} industrial autoxidation process. In contradiction with the literature results, the Au-based catalysts did not exhibit excellent catalytic performance and the combined selectivity toward <b>cyclohexanone</b> <b>and</b> cyclohexanol decreased to 70 % with the increasing conversion above 5 %. In addition, the observed product evolution and by-product evolution were typical for the autoxidation process, although {{a significant increase in}} adipic acid and CO 2 formation was observed. Additional oxidation experiments containing a radical scavenger completely inhibited the reaction and provided proof that the oxidation follows a radical-chain mechanism instead of a catalytic mechanism. This explains the low selectivity at increasing conversion. This important deviation from the literature results can be clarified by the complicated but necessary product analysis of both the gas and the liquid phases...|$|R

40|$|Carbon {{nanotube}} (CNTs) and {{activated carbon}} (AC) supported Pd and Ni catalysts {{were prepared for}} the (in situ) hydrogenation of phenol to <b>cyclohexanone</b> <b>and</b> cyclohexanol. The hydrophobic/hydrophilic properties of the catalysts were tailored by pretreating the carbonaceous support with HNO 3 at various conditions and characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The catalytic results suggested that Pd and Ni supported on CNTs show significantly higher activity than that supported on ACs. Pretreating the CNTs with HNO 3 increases the local hydrophilicity of the active phase (by introducing oxygenated groups), which result {{in an increase in}} the <b>cyclohexanone</b> selectivity <b>and</b> strongly decrease the phenol conversion. The first-principles density functional theory calculation suggested that the adsorption/desorption behaviors of phenol, methanol, H 2 O, <b>and</b> <b>cyclohexanone</b> on the catalysts might be influenced highly by the hydrophobic/hydrophilic properties.
