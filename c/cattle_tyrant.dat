50|$|The <b>cattle</b> <b>tyrant</b> (Machetornis rixosa) is {{a species}} of bird in the tyrant-flycatcher family Tyrannidae. It is {{the only member of}} the genus Machetornis. The {{relationships}} of this species and genus to other genera in the tyrant flycatchers are uncertain. It resembles Tyrannus flycatchers, but this may be the result of convergence. Three subspecies are recognised, the nominate race, M. r. flavigularis and M. r. obscurodorsalis, although the latter two many not be distinct from M. r. flavigularis. The genus name was given to the species by George Robert Gray and is derived from the Ancient Greek makhētēs for fighter and ornis for bird, a reference to its pugnacious behaviour and habit of dispossessing other species of their nests. The specific name comes from the Latin rixosus meaning quarrelsome, again referring to the species/ behaviour and temperament.|$|E
50|$|The {{species has}} a disjunct distribution, with the {{nominate}} race breeding from northern Argentina and Bolivia to the north-eastern tip of Brazil, {{and the two}} other subspecies ranging from Panama to Venezuela and eastern Ecuador. The species inhabits drier open and semi-open habitats, and avoided forested and wooded areas. It {{can be found in}} savannah, pastureland, parkland, agricultural land and even gardens. Due to deforestation, the species has recently colonized areas where it was previously absent, such as northeast Ecuador.The <b>cattle</b> <b>tyrant</b> is a highly terrestrial tyrant-flycatcher, 20 cm long and weighing 29 - 40 g. The plumage of the nominate subspecies is mostly olive-brown above and yellow below. The head is grey with a thin eyestripe and a white throat. The thin bill and legs are black. The two other subspecies vary from the nominate in having a yellow throat.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cattle</b> <b>tyrants</b> build bulky nests or {{steal the}} nests of plain-fronted thornbirds. 3 to 4 eggs are laid and {{incubated}} for 14 days. The chicks fledge after 15 days.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Cattle</b> <b>tyrants</b> feed on insects, {{mostly from}} the ground. It may follow cattle or other large animals for some distance, {{catching}} flushed prey, or even hitch rides on these animals, and then snatching flushed prey with a quick sally-flight. It may sometimes hawk for insects from a high perch. The species is sometimes reported to have a cleaning symbiosis with the large mammals it lives with, however {{studies have found that}} it takes ticks off mammals only occasionally, but it will sometimes hunt biting horseflies attempting to land on capybaras.|$|R
50|$|Broadcast 4 November 1998, {{the next}} {{installment}} focuses on dietary needs and how different species have evolved beaks {{to suit their}} individual requirements. The latter come in a multitude of forms. Blue tits and goldfinches have beaks akin to tweezers, with which to extract seeds, while the hawfinch's razor-like bill can deal with a cherry-stone. However, the crossbill is the only finch that can twist its mandibles in opposite directions. Jays store acorns for winter by burying them in the ground, whereas woodpeckers can keep up to 60,000 of them in one tree trunk. Sap is also desirable, {{and there are a}} variety of methods used to obtain it. The hoatzin is the only specialised leaf-eater, and accordingly has a digestive system more akin to that of cattle. Plants recruit birds to aid pollination, and offer nectar as a reward. hummingbirds eat little else, and the sword-bill's beak is the longest of any bird in relation to its body. Insects are also highly prized, and Galápagos finches are shown to possess some ingenuity as they not only strip bark, but also use 'tools' to reach their prey. Crows are hailed as being among the most intelligent birds, and one is shown using a twig to spear a grub within a fallen log. The robin is an opportunist, and Attenborough observes one seizing morsels as he digs a patch of earth. In South America, a <b>cattle</b> <b>tyrant</b> sits atop an obliging capybara and uses its vantage point to spot passing food that may be dislodged by its grazing partner.|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 81 Tyraniidae birds were examined, 80 Pitangus sulphuratus (Linnaeus, 1766) (Great kiscadee), and one Machetornis rixosa (Vieilot, 1819) (<b>Cattle</b> <b>tyrant),</b> for {{collection}} of nasal mites, which {{were identified as}} Ptilonyssus spinosus (Brooks & Strandtmann, 1960) and Sternostoma longisetosae (Hyland, 1961) (Rhinonyssidae). This finding characterises the first report of P. spinosus and S. longisetosae in P. sulphuratus, and the first record of P. spinosus in M. rixosa, and expands the geographic distribution of these species. It is the first occurrence of S. longisetosae in the Neotropics, and the first citation of P. spinosus {{in the state of}} Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil...|$|E
40|$|Some {{bird species}} feed on {{external}} parasites, such as ticks and flies, {{on the body}} of mammals (hosts or clients). So called cleaner birds that occur in Brazil were reviewed recently, but gathering of significant new data indicates the need for an update and a brief reappraisal of such association. New records raise the number of known clients for some cleaning birds. The Southern Caracara (Caracara plancus) picks ticks on cattle, and the Black Caracara (Daptrius ater) picks ticks on capybaras. The Wattled Jacana (Jacana jacana) picks ticks, horseflies, arthropods and organic debris on capybaras, and tick-picking on capybaras by the Shiny Cowbird (Molothrus bonariensis) is substantiated by photographs. The <b>Cattle</b> <b>Tyrant</b> (Machetornis rixosa) deftly catches horseflies on capybaras, and these latter clients are recorded posing for the Giant Cowbird (Molothrus oryzivorus), which also pick parasites from the marsh deer. The Cattle Egret (Bubulcus ibis) definitely picks ticks directly on cattle. With the new records, some poorly documented or controversial issues in the literature are here confirmed, a hypothesis is validated, and a suggestion is invalidated...|$|E
