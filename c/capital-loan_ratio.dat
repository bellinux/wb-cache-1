40|$|The {{business}} cycle effects of bank capital regulatory regimes are examined in a New Keynesian model with credit market imperfections and a cost channel of monetary policy. Key {{features of the}} model are that bank capital increases incentives for banks to monitor borrowers, thereby reducing the probability of default, and excess capital generates benefits in terms of reduced regulatory scrutiny. Basel I and Basel II-type regulatory regimes are defined, and the model is calibrated for a middle-income country. Simulations {{of supply and demand}} shocks show that, depending on the elasticity that relates the repayment probability to the <b>capital-loan</b> <b>ratio,</b> a Basel II-type regime may be less procyclical than a Basel I-type regime.
