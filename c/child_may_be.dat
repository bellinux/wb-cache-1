5|$|There {{are three}} methods of burial: the coffin may be laid {{in a cave}} or in a carved stone grave, or hung on a cliff. It {{contains}} any possessions that the deceased will need in the afterlife. The wealthy are often buried in a stone grave carved out of a rocky cliff. The grave is usually expensive and takes {{a few months to}} complete. In some areas, a stone cave may be found that is large enough to accommodate a whole family. A wood-carved effigy, called Tau tau, is usually placed in the cave looking out over the land. The coffin of a baby or <b>child</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> hung from ropes on a cliff face or from a tree. This hanging grave usually lasts for years, until the ropes rot and the coffin falls to the ground.|$|E

25|$|For example, {{educational}} {{psychologists have}} conducted {{research on the}} instructional applicability of Jean Piaget's theory of development, according to which children mature through four stages of cognitive capability. Piaget hypothesized that children are not capable of abstract logical thought until they are older than about 11 years, and therefore younger children {{need to be taught}} using concrete objects and examples. Researchers have found that transitions, such as from concrete to abstract logical thought, do not occur {{at the same time in}} all domains. A <b>child</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> able to think abstractly about mathematics, but remain limited to concrete thought when reasoning about human relationships. Perhaps Piaget's most enduring contribution is his insight that people actively construct their understanding through a self-regulatory process.|$|E
25|$|Masturbation among {{adolescents}} contributes to them developing {{a sense of}} mastery over sexual impulses, {{and it has a}} role in the physical and emotional development of prepubescents and pubescents. Babies and toddlers will play with their genitals {{in much the same way}} as they play with their ears or toes. If such play becomes all-consuming, it may be necessary to look for an underlying cause of this, such as the child being tense and in need of comfort, or that others may be overreacting and thus reinforcing the habit. It could be caused by a low-grade urinary tract or yeast infection, or the <b>child</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> overstimulated and in need of soothing, or indeed understimulated and bored. Alongside many other factors, such as medical evidence, age-inappropriate sexual knowledge, sexualized play or aggression, and precocious or seductive behavior, excessive masturbation may alternatively be an indicator of sexual abuse.|$|E
25|$|Though the {{simultaneous}} bilingual child learns two languages at once, {{this does not}} mean that he or she speaks them with identical competence. It is common for young simultaneous bilinguals to be more proficient in one language than the other, and this is probably related to each child's relative exposure to each language; for example, many bilingual children are more proficient in the mother's than the father's language, arguably because their mothers assume most of the childcare responsibilities and/or simply spend more time with their children. The dominant language is almost always the language spoken by the greatest number of the people the child interacts with (generally the language the child is educated in). The child sees this language as most effective and begins to favor it. However, their dominant language need not be their L1. In addition, it is possible to show language dominance in one language for one domain and dominance in the other language for another domain. For example, a <b>child</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> dominant in his or her L1 at home, but in the school context, his or her L2 becomes the dominant language being used.|$|E

2500|$|In Conservative Judaism, the Milah l'Shem giur {{procedure}} is also performed {{for a boy}} whose mother has not converted, but with the intention that the child be raised Jewish. [...] This conversion of a child to Judaism without {{the conversion of the}} mother is allowed by Conservative interpretations of halakha. Conservative Rabbis will authorize it only under the condition that the child be raised as a Jew in a single-faith household. Should the mother convert, and if the boy has not yet reached his third birthday, the <b>child</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> immersed in the mikveh with the mother, after the mother has already immersed, to become Jewish. [...] If the mother does not convert, the <b>child</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> immersed in a mikveh, or body of natural waters, to complete the child's conversion to Judaism. This can be done before the child is even one year old. If the child did not immerse in the mikveh, or the boy was too old, then the child may choose of their own accord to become Jewish at age 13 as a Bar Mitzvah, and complete the conversion then.|$|E

2500|$|Rav Chisda {{was also}} an {{authority}} in aggadah, and employed special assistants to lecture in that department. Many ethical sentences by him have been preserved for students, such as: [...] "Forbearance {{on the part of}} a father toward his <b>child</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> permitted, but not forbearance {{on the part of a}} master toward his disciple" [...] and [...] "He who opposes his master is as though he opposed the Shekinah".

Terrified by the noise, Rav Chisda interrupted his studies, whereupon the angel took his soul.|$|E
2500|$|PCE is very {{difficult}} to study because of a variety of factors that may confound the results: pre- and postnatal care may be poor; the pregnant mother and <b>child</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> malnourished; the amount of cocaine a mother takes can vary; she may take a variety of drugs during pregnancy in addition to cocaine; measurements for detecting deficits may not be sensitive enough; and results that are found may only last a short time. Studies differ in how they define heavy or light cocaine use during pregnancy, and the time period of exposure during pregnancy on which they focus (e.g. first, second, or third trimester. Drug use by mothers puts children at high risk for exposure to toxic or otherwise dangerous environments, and PCE does not present much risk beyond these risk factors. PCE is clustered with other risk factors to the child, such as physical abuse and neglect, domestic violence, and prenatal exposure to other substances. Such environmental factors are known to adversely affect children in the same areas being studied with respect to PCE.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the case}} of gender {{non-conforming}} children and adolescents, the GID criteria are significantly broader in scope in the DSM-IV (APA, 1994, p. 537) than in earlier revisions, to the concern of many civil libertarians. A <b>child</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> diagnosed with Gender Identity Disorder without ever having stated any desire to be, or insistence of being, the other sex. Boys are inexplicably held to a much stricter standard of conformity than girls. Most psychologists who specialize in gender identity disorder in children note {{a higher level of}} male patients brought to them, rather than female patients. A possible explanation would be that cross-sex behavior is less acceptable and therefore more noticeable and more likely to be viewed by problematic by the child’s parents (Bradley, Zucker, 1997). [...] preference for cross-dressing or simulating female attire meets the diagnostic criterion for boys but not for girls, who must insist on wearing only male clothing to merit diagnosis. References to [...] "stereotypical" [...] clothing, toys and activities of the other sex are imprecise in an American culture where much children's' clothing is unisex and appropriate sex role is the subject of political debate. Equally puzzling is a criterion which lists a [...] "strong preference for playmates of the other sex" [...] as symptomatic, and seems to equate mental health with sexual discrimination and segregation.|$|E

2500|$|One 1999 case, Re [...] "J" [...] (child's {{religious}} upbringing and circumcision) {{said that}} circumcision in Britain required {{the consent of}} all those with parental responsibility, or {{the permission of the}} court, acting for {{the best interests of the}} child, and issued an order prohibiting the circumcision of a male child of a non-practicing Muslim father and non-practicing Christian mother with custody. The reasoning included evidence that circumcision carried some medical risk; that the operation would be likely to weaken the relationship of the child with his mother, who strongly objected to circumcision without medical necessity; that the <b>child</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> subject to ridicule by his peers as the odd one out and that the operation might irreversibly reduce sexual pleasure, by permanently removing some sensory nerves, even though cosmetic foreskin restoration might be possible. The court did not rule out circumcision against the consent of one parent. It cited a hypothetical case of a Jewish mother and an agnostic father with a number of sons, all of whom, by agreement, had been circumcised as infants in accordance with Jewish laws; the parents then have another son who is born after they have separated; the mother wishes him to be circumcised like his brothers; the father for no good reason, refuses his agreement. In such a case, a decision in favor of circumcision was said to be likely.|$|E
2500|$|The {{disease is}} theorized {{to include the}} artery of the ligmentum teres femoris being {{constricted}} or even blocked too early, not allowing for time when the medial circumflex femoral artery takes over. [...] The medial circumflex femoral artery is the principal source of blood supply to the femoral head. [...] LCP disease is a vascular restrictive condition of idiopathic nature. [...] Symptoms like femoral head disfigurement, flattening, and collapse occur typically between ages four and ten, mostly male children of Caucasian descent. [...] Children affected by LCP disease often display uneven gait and limited range of motion, and they experience mild to severe pain in the groin area. [...] For example, a <b>child</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> six years old chronologically but may have grown only four years old in terms of bone maturity. The child may then engage in activities appropriate for a six-year- old child, but lacking the bone strength of an older child, these activities may lead to flattening or fracture of the hip joint. Genetics {{do not appear to}} be a determining factor, but a deficiency of blood factors with anticoagulant property used to disperse blood clots may lead to blockages in the vessels supplying the joint. A deficiency of protein C and protein S, which also act as blood anticoagulants, may also exist; if that were the case, their deficiency could cause clot formation in ligamentum teres femoris artery and hinder blood supply to the femoral head. However, no evidence of this has been found; over the years, many theories have been published, but none has stood up to professional research.|$|E
