Beer was just an acceptable alternative and was assigned various negative qualities. In 1256, the Sienese physician Aldobrandino described beer in the following way:But from whichever it is made, whether from oats, barley or wheat, it harms the head and the stomach, it causes bad breath and ruins the teeth, it fills the stomach with bad fumes, and as a result anyone who drinks it along with wine becomes drunk quickly; but it does have the property of facilitating urination and makes one's flesh white and smooth.The intoxicating effect of beer was believed to last longer than that of wine, but it was also admitted that it did not create the [...] "false thirst" [...] associated with wine. Though less prominent than in the north, beer was consumed in northern France and the Italian mainland. Perhaps as a consequence of the Norman conquest and the travelling of nobles between France and England, one French variant described in the 14th century cookbook Le Menagier de Paris was called godale (most likely a direct borrowing from the English [...] "good ale") and was made from barley and spelt, but without hops. In England there were also the variants poset ale, made from hot milk and cold ale, and brakot or braggot, a spiced ale prepared much like hypocras.|$|E
40|$|Tef [Eragrostis tef (Zucc.) Trotter] is a cereal crop {{resilient}} to adverse climatic {{and soil}} conditions, and possessing desirable storage properties. Although tef provides high quality food and grows under marginal conditions unsuitable for other cereals, {{it is considered}} to be an orphan crop because it has benefited little from genetic improvement. Hence, unlike other cereals such as maize and wheat, the productivity of tef is extremely low. In spite of the low productivity, tef is widely cultivated by over six million small-scale farmers in Ethiopia where it is annually grown on more than three million hectares of land, accounting for over 30 % of the total <b>cereal</b> <b>acreage.</b> Tef, a tetraploid with 40 chromosomes (2 n= 4 x= 40), belongs to the Family Poaceae and, together with finger millet (Eleusine coracana Gaertn), to the Subfamily Chloridoideae. It was believed to have originated in Ethiopia. There are about 350 Eragrostis species of which E. tef is the only species cultivated for human consumption. At the present time, the gene bank in Ethiopia holds over five thousand tef accessions collected from geographical regions diverse in terms of climate and elevation. These germplasm accessions appear to have huge variability with regard to key agronomic and nutritional traits. In order to properly utilize the variability in developing new tef cultivars, various techniques have been implemented to catalog the extent and unravel the patterns of genetic diversity. In this review, we show some recent initiatives investigating the diversity of tef using genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics and discuss the prospect of these efforts in providing molecular resources that can aid modern tef breeding...|$|E

This article {{tries to}} {{determine}} the effect of changes in the production of <b>cereal's</b> <b>acreage</b> decisions of farmers. An acreage supply response model is developed for durum wheat, soft wheat and barley for the North of Tunisia. The risk variable is incorporated in the model a long differents specifications. The relative unexpected variability in yields in the preceding year, is shown to be a good approximation for the variable risk. The empirical results indicate that risk {{play an important role in}} wheat-barley acreage decisions and that soft wheat and barley are more responsive to change in risk than durum wheat. The analysis show also that risk reduction constitues a priority for government to stimulate production and to reduce consequently imports of cereals production...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the responsiveness of Tunisian cereals producers to price and weather variables. The price elasticities of supply thus developed could be useful in the evaluation of alternative pricing policies. Acreage, yield and marketed output responses were estimated using aggregate time series data for the period covering Tunisia 2 ̆ 7 s independence 1955 - 1980;The acreage response functions were formulated along the lines of Nerlove 2 ̆ 7 s lagged adjustment model. Price expectations were first formulated as in Nerlove 2 ̆ 7 s model. In view of the price fixing tradition of the Tunisian government, the simple Cobweb type of expectations formation, i. e., P(,t) (2 ̆ 7 e) = P(,t- 1), was used in most of the equations. The two model types had in general comparable results;For the northern region, acreages show a significantly positive responsiveness to own prices. Total <b>cereal</b> <b>acreages</b> in the North have response elasticities of. 29 to. 65 in the short run and of. 61 to 1. 04 in the long run. Lamb show as a competitive activity while beef seems to be rather a complementary one. Rainfall in the planting season affects somewhat planted acreages;For the combined central and southern regions only barley 2 ̆ 7 s acreage show a significantly positive price responsiveness to barley price. Lagged acreages and rainfall during the planting season explain most of the variation in acreage;Yields for all three cereals respond negatively, with high significance levels to the current ratio of nitrogen to own price. The phosphate to own price ratio seems to affect durum wheat alone. Rainfall in the three major growth seasons shows more of an impact on yields in the combined central and southern regions while price ratios are not as much of a factor;Marketed output responses for durum wheat, soft wheat and for all cereals have a very strong reaction to both the level of total output and to own price, with significance levels generally in the one per ten thousand range. The derived marginal propensities for autoconsumption out of total output were. 59,. 51,. 71 and. 64 respectively for durum wheat, soft wheat, barley and all cereals;The magnitudes and significance levels of the price elasticities of supply, developed here, appear to indicate a good potential for the use of real prices as incentives for increased cereals production and marketings in Tunisia...|$|R
40|$|Under Mediterranean environments {{water and}} {{nitrogen}} (N) {{are considered the}} two factors most strongly limiting crop productivity. Wheat (bread and durum) and barley are the main crops grown in dryland Mediterranean environments. Within the Mediterranean basin, wheat is usually cultivated in rotations with other crops under relatively humid zones while barley is sown as a monoculture in the driest zones. Reasons behind barley monoculture are based on an hypothetical barley yield advantage over wheat under stressed environments. However, information about direct comparison between wheat (bread or durum) and barley is not abundant for the Mediterranean basin (nor for other Mediterranean regions). Neither grain yield nor biomass production, water use, nitrogen use or their use efficiency have been compared for the three species to justify the preference {{of one of them}} in monoculture in the more scarce resource availability environments. The main objective of the present thesis was to assess the response of wheat (bread and durum) and barley in terms of productivity to different water and nitrogen availabilities within the Mediterranean conditions of dryland cereal regions of Catalonia. Within the main objective two specific objectives were formulated (i) to provide empirical support to the generalized hypothesis of a better performance of barley than wheat under stress conditions, and (ii) to analyze if N fertilization could be a management tool to increase grain yield under stressful Mediterranean conditions for small grain cereals (in cases in which soil N were low). To fulfil the objectives data taken from a literature revision, and historical and regional data were analysed combined with those from five field experiments that were carried-out using different combinations of water and N availabilities for a typical well-adapted and representative cultivar of bread wheat, durum wheat and barley during 2003 / 04 to 2006 / 07 growing seasons in a typical dryland region of Catalonia where barley represent c. 80 % of the total <b>cereal</b> <b>acreage.</b> Across all the experimental conditions grain yield of the three species varied widely from c. 1 to 10 Mg ha- 1. Under the driest and poorest yielding conditions barley presented similar yields to wheat (bread and durum) using the experimental data, but also using the bibliographic, historical and regional data, indicating an unjustified barley monoculture in terms of productivity. Despite similar yield between durum wheat and barley a lower stability in grain weight was observed for the case of durum wheat. Neither water use or N use or their use efficiencies supported the hypothesised advantage of barley over wheat across the driest experimental conditions. Water availability and N fertilization modified grain yield, biomass and resource use efficiency. In the present thesis, it was evidenced with realistic field data {{for the first time that}} of the degree of co-limitation between factors (N and water in this case) may affect yields as well as water use efficiency of small grain cereals, which had been previously proposed but using simulation models for wheat production in Australia...|$|E
