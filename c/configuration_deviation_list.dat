40|$|Graduation date: 1968 The model-reference, {{adaptive}} control concept {{is based on}} the precept that desired control system performance is a known design requirement and can be obtained from a representative model. Control system parameters are adjusted by the {{adaptive control}}ler through a minimizing operation on a function of the error (i. e., performance index) between control system and model response characteristics. By minimizing the performance index, the control system response characteristics will track those of the model.

The design and analysis techniques presented encompass design approach variations (i. e., <b>configuration</b> <b>deviations)</b> and solutions to commonly encountered application problems.

40|$|Background and purpose: Conformal {{radiotherapy}} requires accurate dose calculation at {{the dose}} specification point, at other {{points in the}} planning target volume (PTV) and in organs at risk. To assess the limitations of treatment planning of lung tumours, errors in dose values, calculated by some simple tissue inhomogeneity correction algorithms available {{in a number of}} currently applied treatment planning systems, have been quantified. Materials and methods: Single multileaf collimator-shaped photon beams of 6, 8, 15 and 18 MV nominal energy were used to irradiate a 50 mm diameter spherical solid tumour, simulated by polystyrene, which was located centrally inside lung tissue, simulated by cork. The planned dose distribution was made conformal to the PTV, which was a 15 mm three-dimensional expansion of the tumour. Values of both the absolute dose at the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurement (ICRU) reference point and relative dose distributions inside the PTV and in the lung were calculated using three inhomogeneity correction algorithms. The algorithms investigated in this study are the pencil beam algorithm with one-dimensional corrections, the modified Batho algorithm and the equivalent path length algorithm. The calculated data were compared with measurements for a simple beam set-up using radiographic film and ionization chambers. Results: For this specific <b>configuration,</b> <b>deviations</b> of up to 3. 5 % between calculated and measured values of the dose at the ICRU reference point were found. Discrepancies between measured and calculated beam fringe values (distance between the 50 and 90 % isodose lines) of up to 14 mm have been observed. The differences in beam fringe and penumbra width (20 - 80 %) increase with increasing beam energy. Our results demonstrate that an underdosage of the PTV up to 20 % may occur if calculated dose values are used for treatment planning. The three algorithms predict a considerably higher dose in the lung, both along the central beam axis and in the lateral direction, compared-with the actual delivered dose values. Conclusions: The dose at the ICRU reference point of such a tumour in lung geometry is calculated with acceptable accuracy. Differences between calculated and measured dose distributions are primarily due to changes in electron transport in the lung, which are not adequately taken into account by the simple tissue inhomogeneity correction algorithms investigated in this study. Particularly for high photon beam energies, clinically unacceptable errors will be introduced in the choice of field sizes employed for conformal treatments, leading to underdosage of the PTV. In addition, the dose to the lung will be wrongly predicted which may influence the choice of the prescribed dose level in dose-escalation studies. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

40|$|Accelerator {{facilities}} require {{access to}} many beam parameters during operation. The field of beam instrumentation serves this {{crucial role in}} commissioning, setup and optimisation of the facility. An important information is contained in the phase-space distribution of the accelerated particles. In case of GSI (Helmholtzzentrum für Schwerionenforschung) those are ions from protons to uranium. If established methods to access certain beam parameters do not exist, new approaches have to emerge. This {{is the case for}} the presented measurement setup which has been designed and realised by Forck et al. to support commissioning of the GSI high-current injector. It is aiming at an experimental method to access the longitudinal phase-space distribution at low energies of 1. 4 AMeV. Established methods for higher energies and based on the measurement of the electric field distribution are not feasible at non-relativistic velocities. The presented method is based on a time-of-flight (TOF) measurement between two particle detectors. A modification allows, alternatively, the direct measurement of the kinetic energy using a mono-crystalline (MC) diamond detector. Currently, besides others, the focus of the optimisation of the injector is put on the longitudinal phase-space distribution. It allows for a systematic optimisation of the matching into the accelerator cavities and, thus, an improved transmission as well as lower emittance values. The new accelerator facility FAIR (Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research), a large-scale upgrade at GSI, requires an improved beam quality at the existing injector. In this work the experimental setup is investigated for its feasibility to measure the longitudinal phase-space distribution. To this end, the phase and momentum of the single ions along the beam axis have to be determined with high precision. Finally, the longitudinal phase-space distribution is identified with the measured ensemble. The setup is presented in detail, introducing necessary concepts such as the phase space and emittance and is followed by a discussion of the data acquisition and data analysis. An important part of the latter is the introduction of a robust estimator for the covariance matrix of the measured distribution which is directly connected to the RMS emittance. However, the classical estimator is very sensitive to outliers in the measured data. The usual approach of subjective selection of cut regions is thereby avoided. The TOF setup has been tested with low and high current beams where a general sensitivity to the longitudinal phase-space distribution was confirmed. Furthermore, the gas pressure at the stripper section and the setup of the high-current slits, required for beam attenuation, {{have an impact on the}} measured distributions. Scattering of ions at the slits leads to a larger energy spread, larger bunch length and, consequently, emittance.

In this study, the well-known split window technique is used to retrieve the optical thickness and the effective particle size, and to estimate the mass concentration of volcanic particles from brightness temperatures measured in the infrared atmospheric window (8 – 12 μm). Retrievals are obtained for several mineral compositions whose optical properties are computed using Mie theory accounting for spectral variations of the refractive index. The impacts of errors in atmospheric parameters on the a posteriori uncertainties have been analysed. This analysis confirmed that major sources of errors are the layer altitude, the particle composition and, most of all, the size distribution for which uncertainties in retrievals can reach 50 % in mass loading estimates. This retrieval algorithm is then applied to measurements acquired near-simultaneously from MODIS, SEVIRI and IASI space-borne instruments, using two channels around 11 μm and 12 μm. The retrievals are in close agreement when taking into account the different spatial and spectral <b>configurations,</b> and <b>deviations</b> between retrievals remain less than the uncertainties due to errors in atmospheric parameters.

40|$|Evanescent-wave {{microscopy}} achieves sub-diffraction axial sectioning by confining fluorescence excitation to a {{thin layer}} close to the cell/substrate interface. How thin this light sheet exactly is, however, is often unknown. Particularly in the popular objective-type total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) <b>configuration</b> large <b>deviations</b> from the expected exponential intensity decay of the evanescent wave have been reported. Propagating, i. e., non-evanescent, excitation light diminishes the optical sectioning effect, reduces contrast and renders the quantification of TIRFM images uncertain. Here, we {{use a combination of}} azimuthal- and polar-angle beam scanning, dark-field scatter imaging, and atomic force microscopy to identify the sources of this unwanted background fluorescence excitation. We identify stray light originating from the microscope optics and the objective lens itself as the major sources of background, with minor contributions due to evanescent-wave scattering at the reflecting interface and at refractive-index boundaries in the sample. Apart from evanescence in excitation light, light emitted from a fluorophore can also show observable effects of evanescence. Only fluorophores located close to the coverslip can couple their near-field radiation into propagating waves detectable at supercritical angles. We show that selectively detecting this supercritical-angle fluorescence (SAF) through a high-numerical aperture objective effectively rejects fluorescence from deeper sample regions and improves optical sectioning. The microscopy scheme presented here merges the benefits of TIRF excitation and SAF detection and provides the conditions for quantitative wide-field imaging of fluorophore dynamics at or near the plasma membrane.

Several beams are analyzed under various boundary conditions and loadings to illustrate the merits of the method as well as its applicability, efficiency and accuracy...|$|R
