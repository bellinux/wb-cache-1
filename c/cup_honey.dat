40|$|Increasing {{demands for}} stingless bee honey in Malaysia have {{prompted}} alternative method using plastic <b>cups</b> as artificial <b>honey</b> pots within beehives to enhance yield. However, honey’s acidity {{may lead to}} migration of plastic additives, affecting body’s physiological responses on prolonged consumption. This study was performed to determine the presence of dibutyl phthalate (DBP) and oleamide in stingless bee honey collected from plastic cups. A method for simultaneous extraction and detection of both analytes by solvent terminated dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (ST-DLLME) coupled with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was developed. Good linearity was observed with coefficient of determination R 2 ≥ 0. 97 in the concentration range of 0. 5 - 50 and 10 - 250 μg/g for DBP and oleamide, respectively. The limit of detection for DBP was 0. 15 μg/g; while oleamide was 4 μg/g. The limit of quantitation for DBP and oleamide was 0. 5 and 11 μg/g, respectively. DBP and oleamide were not detected in all the honey samples collected...|$|R
5000|$|Canon 19 is a {{long one}} dealing with catechumens, {{preparation}} for baptism, administration of that sacrament, and of the Eucharist for the newly baptized. The candidate is twice anointed: first, with the oil of exorcism, after he has said, with his face westward, [...] "I renounce you, O devil, and all your following"; and, again, immediately after the baptism. As {{he stands in the}} water, he declares his faith in response to an interrogatory creed; and after each of the three clauses he is immersed. After the second anointing the bishop gives thanks [...] "for that You hast made them worthy that they should be born again, and hast poured out your Holy Spirit upon them, so that they may belong, each one of them, to the body of the Church": he signs them with the cross on their foreheads, and kisses them. The Eucharist then proceeds: [...] "the bishop gives them of the Body of Christ and says, This is the body of Christ, and they answer Amen"; and similarly for the <b>cup.</b> Milk and <b>honey</b> are then given to them as being [...] " [...] born a second time as little children." [...] A warning is added against eating anything before communicating.|$|R
50|$|Items {{are placed}} on this spread: a Mirror (of fate), two Candelabras (representing {{the bride and groom}} and their bright future), a tray of seven multi-colored herbs and spices (including poppy seeds, wild rice, angelica, salt, nigella seeds, black tea, and frankincense). These herbs and spices play {{specific}} roles ranging from breaking spells and witchcraft, to blinding the evil eye, to burning evil spirits. In addition to these herbs/spices, a special baked and decorated flatbread, a basket of decorated eggs, decorated almonds, walnuts and hazelnuts (in their shell to represent fertility), a basket of pomegranates/apples (for a joyous future as these fruits are considered divine), a cup of rose water (from special Persian roses)—which helps perfume the air, a bowl made out of sugar (apparently to sweeten life for the newlywed couple), and a brazier holding burning coals and sprinkled with wild rue (as a way to keep the evil eye away and to purify the wedding ritual) {{are placed on}} the spread as well. Finally, there are additional items that must be placed on the spread, including a bowl of gold coins (to represent wealth and prosperity), a scarf/shawl made of silk/fine fabric (to be held over the bride and groom’s head at certain points in the ceremony), two sugar cones—which are ground above the bride and groom's head, thus symbolizing sweetness/happiness, a <b>cup</b> of <b>honey</b> (to sweeten life), a needle and seven strands of colored thread (the shawl that is held above the bride and groom’s head is sewn together with the string throughout the ceremony), and a copy of the couple’s Holy Book (other religions require different texts); but all of these books symbolize God's blessing for the couple.An early age in marriage—especially for brides—is a long documented feature of marriage in Iran. While the people of Iran have been trying to legally change this practice by implementing a higher minimum in marriage, there have been countless blocks to such an attempt. Although the average age of women being married has increased by about five years in the past couple decades, young girls being married is still common feature of marriage in Iran—even though there is an article in the Iranian Civil Code that forbid the marriage of women younger than 15 years of age and males younger than 18 years of age.|$|R
6000|$|L. More than that, Lucilla. They {{often go}} mad. That {{abandonment}} of the mind to religious theory, or contemplation, is the very thing I have been pleading with you against. I never said you should set yourself to discover the meanings; but you should take careful pains to understand them, so far as they are clear; and you should always accurately ascertain the state of your mind about them. I want you never to read merely {{for the pleasure of}} fancy; still less as a formal religious duty (else you might as well take to repeating Paters at once; for it is surely wiser to repeat one thing we understand, than read a thousand which we cannot). Either, therefore, acknowledge the passages to be, for the present, unintelligible to you; or else determine the sense in which you at present receive them; or, at all events, the different senses between which you clearly see that you must choose. Make either your belief, or your difficulty, definite; but do not go on, all through your life, believing nothing intelligently, and yet supposing that your having read the words of a divine book must give you the right to despise every religion but your own. I assure you, strange as it may seem, our scorn of Greek tradition depends, not on our belief, but our disbelief, of our own traditions. We have, as yet, no sufficient clue to the meaning of either; but you will always find that, in proportion to the earnestness of our own faith, its tendency to accept a spiritual personality increases: and that the most vital and beautiful Christian temper rests joyfully in its conviction of the multitudinous ministry of living angels, infinitely varied in rank and power. You all know one expression of the purest and happiest form of such faith, as it exists in modern times, in Richter's lovely illustrations of the Lord's Prayer. The real and living death-angel, girt as a pilgrim for journey, and softly crowned with flowers, beckons at the dying mother's door; child-angels sit talking face to face with mortal children, among the flowers;--hold them by their little coats, lest they fall on the stairs;--whisper dreams of heaven to them, leaning over their pillows; carry the sound of the church bells for them far through the air; and even descending lower in service, fill little <b>cups</b> with <b>honey,</b> to hold out to the weary bee. By the way, Lily, did you tell the other children that story about your little sister, and Alice, and the sea? ...|$|R

50|$|Like most bumblebees, B. frigidus has a eusocial {{seasonal}} {{colony in}} which the queen lives for a year. During the winter, the queen will stay in a small chamber in the ground, which she had previously found or dug for herself, called a hibernaculum. As soon as the snow meltsaround mid May, the queen will begin {{to search for a}} nest site. B. frigidus queens tend to leave their hibernacula earlier than other arctic bees. Also, arctic bees have ovaries which develop faster than those of temperate bees. This allows arctic bees to start their colonies faster, which is necessary due to the shorter time between winters in arctic regions. The queens fly close to theground, often stopping to examine a potential nesting site. While the queen is searching, she will not carry any pollen. Once a suitable site is found, she will begin to collect pollen to make a brood clump and feed the brood. She will also start to build a wax <b>cup,</b> called a <b>honey</b> pot, to store the pollen and nectar. When the nest is ready, she will lay eggs on the brood clump and incubate them with her abdomen. The queen will remain in the nest until she needs more food or until the eggs hatch. The eggs will hatch about four days after being laid, but it takes about four weeks for the first workers to become adults. The colony will continue to grow during the summer, and the queen will continue to produce eggs, rarely leaving the nest. The workers will supply her with nectar, maintain the colony, and help her produce a group of male offspring. New queens are produced shortly thereafter. The reproductive bees will leave the colony to mate around early September. After mating, the males will die and the new queens will obtain nectar for a short time before finding a new hibernaculumfor the winter.|$|R
