5|$|Like all livestock, Brumbies {{can carry}} the {{parasite}} <b>Cryptosporidium</b> parvum, which {{can result in}} serious gastroenteritis in people drinking contaminated drinking water.|$|E
5|$|Mitochondrial genomes {{have far}} fewer genes than the {{bacteria}} {{from which they}} {{are thought to be}} descended. Although some have been lost altogether, many have been transferred to the nucleus, such as the respiratory complex II protein subunits. This is thought to be relatively common over evolutionary time. A few organisms, such as the <b>Cryptosporidium,</b> actually have mitochondria that lack any DNA, presumably because all their genes have been lost or transferred. In <b>Cryptosporidium,</b> the mitochondria have an altered ATP generation system that renders the parasite resistant to many classical mitochondrial inhibitors such as cyanide, azide, and atovaquone.|$|E
5|$|Gastroenteritis {{is defined}} as {{vomiting}} or diarrhea due to infection of the small or large bowel. The changes in the small bowel are typically noninflammatory, while {{the ones in the}} large bowel are inflammatory. The number of pathogens required to cause an infection varies from as few as one (for <b>Cryptosporidium)</b> to as many as 108 (for Vibrio cholerae).|$|E
5|$|It is {{susceptible}} {{to a range of}} parasites including <b>Cryptosporidium,</b> Giardia, tapeworms, blood parasites and external feather lice, and is also affected by other avian diseases. It is often the dominant species in major mortality events from avian botulism and avian cholera, and can also contract avian influenza, the H5N1 strain of which is highly pathogenic and occasionally infects humans.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{protozoa}} can cause gastroenteritis – most commonly Giardia lamblia – but Entamoeba histolytica, <b>Cryptosporidium</b> spp., {{and other species}} have also been implicated. As a group, these agents comprise about 10% of cases in children. Giardia occurs more commonly in the developing world, but this etiologic agent causes this type of illness to some degree nearly everywhere. It occurs more commonly in persons who have traveled to areas with high prevalence, children who attend day care, {{men who have sex}} with men, and following disasters.|$|E
5|$|Many small {{communities}} obtain their drinking water from diverse sources (lakes, streams, springs and groundwater wells). Levels of treatment vary widely, from rudimentary systems with coarse screening or settling followed by disinfection (usually chlorination), to more sophisticated systems using a filtration step. It {{should be noted}} that unless a high quality source is used, such as secure groundwater, disinfection alone is unlikely to guarantee that drinking water is safe from protozoa such as Giardia and <b>Cryptosporidium,</b> which are relatively resistant to standard disinfectants and which require additional removal steps such as filtration.|$|E
25|$|While <b>Cryptosporidium</b> {{is highly}} {{resistant}} to chlorine disinfection, with high enough concentrations and contact time, <b>Cryptosporidium</b> will be inactivated by chlorine dioxide and ozone treatment. The required levels of chlorine generally preclude {{the use of}} chlorine disinfection as a reliable method to control <b>Cryptosporidium</b> in drinking water. Ultraviolet light treatment at relatively low doses will inactivate <b>Cryptosporidium.</b> Water Research Foundation-funded research originally discovered UV's efficacy in inactivating <b>Cryptosporidium.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{pattern of}} <b>Cryptosporidium</b> life cycle fits well {{with that of}} other {{intestinal}} homogeneous coccidian genera of the suborder Eimeriina: macro- and microgamonts develop independently; a microgamont gives rise to numerous male gametes; and oocysts serving for parasites' spreading in the environment. Electron microscopic studies made from the 1970s have shown the intracellular, although extracytoplasmic localization of <b>Cryptosporidium</b> species.|$|E
25|$|Eradicate water borne parasites such as Giardia lamblia and <b>Cryptosporidium</b> in {{surface water}} {{treatment}} plants.|$|E
25|$|The most {{reliable}} way to decontaminate drinking water {{that may be}} contaminated by <b>Cryptosporidium</b> is to boil it.|$|E
25|$|The {{degree of}} {{inactivation}} by ultraviolet radiation {{is directly related}} to the UV dose applied to the water. The dosage, a product of UV light intensity and exposure time, is usually measured in microjoules per square centimeter, or equivalently as microwatt seconds per square centimeter (µW·s/cm2). Dosages for a 90% kill of most bacteria and viruses range from 2,000 to 8,000µW·s/cm2. Larger parasites such as <b>cryptosporidium</b> require a lower dose for inactivation. As a result, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has accepted UV disinfection as a method for drinking water plants to obtain <b>cryptosporidium,</b> giardia or virus inactivation credits. For example, for one-decimal-logarithm reduction of <b>cryptosporidium,</b> a minimum dose of 2,500µW·s/cm2 is required based on the U.S. EPA UV Guidance Manual published in 2006.|$|E
25|$|In May 2010, the Behana creek {{water supply}} south of Cairns, Australia, {{was found to}} be {{contaminated}} by <b>cryptosporidium.</b>|$|E
25|$|They are Giardia, Cyclospora and <b>Cryptosporidium,</b> {{and none}} of them were known to be {{significant}} pathogens in the 1970s.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cryptosporidium</b> was {{the basis}} of the 1998 {{television}} film, Thirst, in which it mutates and passes through a town's water filters.|$|E
25|$|In July 2010, a local {{sports center}} in Cumbernauld (Glasgow, UK) {{detected}} traces of <b>cryptosporidium</b> in its swimming pools, causing a temporary {{closure of the}} swimming pools.|$|E
25|$|Glyphosate {{can control}} the growth of apicomplexan parasites, such as Toxoplasma gondii, Plasmodium falciparum (malaria), and <b>Cryptosporidium</b> parvum, and has been {{considered}} an antimicrobial agent in mammals.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1996, <b>Cryptosporidium</b> {{affected}} approximately 2,000 people in Cranbrook, British Columbia, Canada. Weeks later, a separate incident occurred in Kelowna, British Columbia, where 10,000 to 15,000 people got sick.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, {{a highly}} publicised Giardia and <b>Cryptosporidium</b> {{outbreak}} {{was reported in}} Sydney, Australia, but it {{was found to be}} due to mismeasurement of the concentrations of microbes in the water supply.|$|E
25|$|It is more {{effective}} as a disinfectant than chlorine in most circumstances against waterborne pathogenic agents such as viruses, bacteria and protozoa – including the cysts of Giardia and the oocysts of <b>Cryptosporidium.</b>|$|E
25|$|Nitazoxanide is a {{synthetic}} nitrothiazolyl-salicylamide derivative indicated as an antiprotozoal agent (FDA-approved {{for the treatment}} of infectious diarrhea caused by <b>Cryptosporidium</b> parvum and Giardia lamblia) and also is currently being studied in C. difficile infections vs. vancomycin.|$|E
25|$|Parasites, {{particularly}} protozoa (e.g., <b>Cryptosporidium</b> spp., Giardia spp., Entamoeba histolytica, Blastocystis spp., Cyclospora cayetanensis), {{are frequently}} {{the cause of}} diarrhea that involves chronic infection. The broad-spectrum antiparasitic agent nitazoxanide has shown efficacy against many diarrhea-causing parasites.|$|E
25|$|On 21 September 2007, a <b>Cryptosporidium</b> {{outbreak}} {{attacked the}} Western United States: 230 Idaho residents, with hundreds across the Rocky Mountain area; in the Boise and Meridian areas; Utah, 1,600 illnesses; Colorado and other Western states — Montana, decrease.|$|E
25|$|The US CDC {{notes the}} {{recommendation}} of many public health departments to soak contaminated surfaces for 20 minutes with a 3% hydrogen peroxide (99% kill rate) and then rinse them thoroughly, with the caveat that no disinfectant is guaranteed to be completely effective against <b>Cryptosporidium.</b> However, hydrogen peroxide {{is more effective than}} standard bleach solutions.|$|E
25|$|Cryptosporidiosis {{is found}} worldwide. It causes 50.8% of {{water-borne}} diseases that {{are attributed to}} parasites. In developing countries, 8–19% of diarrheal diseases {{can be attributed to}} <b>Cryptosporidium.</b> Ten percent of the population in developing countries excretes oocysts. In developed countries, the number is lower at 1–3%. The age group most affected are children from 1 to 9 years old.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{the summer}} of 2008; many public {{swimming}} areas, water parks, and public pools in the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex of Texas suffered an outbreak of cryptosporidiosis. Burger's Lake in Fort Worth {{was the first to}} report such an outbreak. This prompted some, if not all, city-owned and private pools to close and hyperchlorinate. To the 13 August 2008 there were 400 reported cases of <b>Cryptosporidium.</b>|$|E
25|$|Originally, fecal {{contamination}} {{was determined}} {{with the presence}} of coliform bacteria, a convenient marker for a class of harmful fecal pathogens. The presence of fecal coliforms (like E. Coli) serves as an indication of contamination by sewage. Additional contaminants include protozoan oocysts such as <b>Cryptosporidium</b> sp., Giardia lamblia, Legionella, and viruses (enteric). Microbial pathogenic parameters are typically of greatest concern because of their immediate health risk.|$|E
25|$|The risk {{of disease}} {{transmission}} {{is not limited}} to those of a human origin; pathogens from domestic animals and livestock through contaminated water are also a concern. Studies have found that water borne, gastrointestinal parasites such as <b>Cryptosporidium</b> sp., Microsporidia sp.,and Giardia sp. are genetically identical when found in livestock, humans, and gorillas; particularly along theborder of the Bwindi Impenetrable Forest, Uganda. Another example of human induced disease is Tuberculosis; Kabagambe et al. found that as high as 11% of cattle in Rwanda suffered from this affliction.|$|E
25|$|Floods also {{frequently}} damage power transmission and sometimes power generation, which then has knock-on effects {{caused by the}} loss of power. This includes loss of drinking water treatment and water supply, which may result in loss of drinking water or severe water contamination. It may also cause the loss of sewage disposal facilities. Lack of clean water combined with human sewage in the flood waters raises the risk of waterborne diseases, which can include typhoid, giardia, <b>cryptosporidium,</b> cholera and many other diseases depending upon the location of the flood.|$|E
25|$|Bovine {{colostrum}} from pasture-fed cows contains immunoglobulins {{specific to}} many human pathogens, including Escherichia coli, <b>Cryptosporidium</b> parvum, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella species, Staphylococcus species, and rotavirus (which causes diarrhea in infants). Before {{the development of}} antibiotics, colostrum was {{the main source of}} immunoglobulins used to fight bacteria. In fact, when Albert Sabin made his first oral vaccine against polio, the immunoglobulin he used came from bovine colostrum. When antibiotics began to appear, interest in colostrum waned, but, now that antibiotic-resistant strains of pathogens have developed, interest is once again returning to natural alternatives to antibiotics, namely, colostrum.|$|E
25|$|Cryptosporidiosis, {{also known}} as crypto, is a {{parasitic}} disease caused by <b>Cryptosporidium,</b> a genus of protozoan parasites in the phylum Apicomplexa. It affects the distal small intestine and can affect the respiratory tract in both immunocompetent (i.e., individuals with a normal functioning immune system) and immunocompromised (e.g., persons with HIV/AIDS or autoimmune disorders) individuals, resulting in watery diarrhea with or without an unexplained cough. In immunocompromised individuals, the symptoms are particularly severe and can be fatal. It is primarily spread through the fecal-oral route, often through contaminated water; recent evidence suggests that {{it can also be}} transmitted via fomites in respiratory secretions.|$|E
25|$|Apicomplexans are a {{group of}} alveolates. Like the helicosproidia, they're parasitic, and have a nonphotosynthetic {{chloroplast}}. They were {{once thought to be}} related to the helicosproidia, but it is now known that the helicosproida are green algae rather than part of the CASH lineage. The apicomplexans include Plasmodium, the malaria parasite. Many apicomplexans keep a vestigial red algal derived chloroplast called an apicoplast, which they inherited from their ancestors. Other apicomplexans like <b>Cryptosporidium</b> have lost the chloroplast completely. Apicomplexans store their energy in amylopectin granules that are located in their cytoplasm, even though they are nonphotosynthetic.|$|E
25|$|Membrane {{filters are}} widely used for {{filtering}} both drinking water and sewage. For drinking water, membrane filters can remove virtually all particles larger than 0.2μm—including giardia and <b>cryptosporidium.</b> Membrane filters are an effective form of tertiary treatment when it is desired to reuse the water for industry, for limited domestic purposes, or before discharging the water into a river {{that is used by}} towns further downstream. They {{are widely used}} in industry, particularly for beverage preparation (including bottled water). However no filtration can remove substances that are actually dissolved in the water such as phosphorus, nitrates and heavy metal ions.|$|E
25|$|Cryptosporidiosis is a {{parasitic}} disease that is transmitted through contaminated {{food or water}} from an infected person or animal. Cryptosporidiosis in cats is rare, but they can carry the protozoan without showing any signs of illness. Cryptosporidiosis can cause profuse, watery diarrhea with cramping, abdominal pain, and nausea in people. Illness in people is usually self-limiting and lasts only 2–4 days, but can become severe in people with weakened immune systems. Cryptosporidiosis (<b>Cryptosporidium</b> spp.) Cats transmit the protozoan through their feces. The symptoms in people weight loss and chronic diarrhea in high-risk patients. More than one species of this genus can be acquired by people. Dogs can also transmit this parasite.|$|E
25|$|In March 2007, a {{suspected}} outbreak occurred in Galway, Ireland, after {{the source of}} water {{for much of the}} county, Lough Corrib, was suspected to be contaminated with the parasite. A large population (90,000 people), including areas of both Galway City and County, were advised to boil water for drinking, food preparation and for brushing teeth. On 21 March 2007, it was confirmed that the city and county's water supply was contaminated with the parasite. The area's water supply was finally given approval on 20 August 2007, five months after <b>Cryptosporidium</b> was first detected. Around 240 people are known to have contracted the disease; experts say the true figure could be up to 5,000.|$|E
25|$|All {{forms of}} {{chlorine}} are widely used, despite their respective drawbacks. One drawback is that chlorine from any source reacts with natural organic compounds {{in the water}} to form potentially harmful chemical by-products. These by-products, trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAs), are both carcinogenic in large quantities and are regulated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Drinking Water Inspectorate in the UK. The formation of THMs and haloacetic acids may be minimized by effective removal of as many organics from the water as possible prior to chlorine addition. Although chlorine is effective in killing bacteria, it has limited effectiveness against protozoa that form cysts in water (Giardia lamblia and <b>Cryptosporidium,</b> {{both of which are}} pathogenic).|$|E
25|$|It used to {{be thought}} that UV {{disinfection}} was more effective for bacteria and viruses, which have more-exposed genetic material, than for larger pathogens that have outer coatings or that form cyst states (e.g., Giardia) that shield their DNA from UV light. However, it was recently discovered that ultraviolet radiation can be somewhat effective for treating the microorganism <b>Cryptosporidium.</b> The findings resulted {{in the use of}} UV radiation as a viable method to treat drinking water. Giardia in turn {{has been shown to be}} very susceptible to UV-C when the tests were based on infectivity rather than excystation. It has been found that protists are able to survive high UV-C doses but are sterilized at low doses.|$|E
