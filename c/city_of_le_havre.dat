500|$|On {{the fifth}} stage, a bunch sprint {{occurred}} and Greipel {{got the better}} of it by beating Peter Sagan and Mark Cavendish, respectively. In the sixth stage, Zdeněk Štybar of won after escaping on the concluding small ascent in the port <b>city</b> <b>of</b> <b>Le</b> <b>Havre.</b> A crash in the final kilometer forced Martin to abandon the Tour with a broken collarbone, the second yellow jersey wearer to surrender after Cancellara. A record was set after the stage, with Daniel Teklehaimanot becoming the first black African to lead the mountains classification. Although Froome now led the race, no rider wore the yellow jersey on stage seven as Martin had finished the stage and earned the right to wear it. Cavendish won the seventh from a bunch sprint in Fougères, Brittany. Froome was awarded the yellow jersey after the stage. Stage eight, finishing atop the Mûr-de-Bretagne, saw the first French victory of the Tour, with [...] rider Alexis Vuillermoz launching an attack inside the final kilometer to take the victory. The general classification favourites finished together except Vincenzo Nibali who lost ten seconds. Sagan moved into the green jersey.

2500|$|On 6 September 1944, Montgomery told Crerar that [...] "I want Boulogne badly" [...] {{and that}} city {{should be taken}} {{no matter what the}} cost. By this point, ports like Cherbourg were too far away from the front line, causing the Allies great {{logistical}} problems. The importance of ports closer to Germany was highlighted with the liberation of the <b>city</b> <b>of</b> <b>Le</b> <b>Havre,</b> which was assigned to John Crocker's I Corps. To take Le Havre, two infantry divisions, two tank brigades, most of the artillery of the Second British Army, the specialized armoured [...] "gadgets" [...] of Percy Hobart's 79th Armoured Division, the battleship HMS Warspite and the monitor HMS Erebus were all committed. On 10 September 1944, Bomber Command dropped 4,719 tons of bombs on Le Havre, which was the prelude to Operation Astonia, the assault on Le Havre by Crocker's men, which was taken two days later. The Canadian historian Terry Copp wrote that the commitment of this much firepower and men to take only one French city might [...] "seem excessive", but by this point, the Allies desperately needed ports closer to the front line to sustain their advance.|$|E

40|$|International audienceBackgroundExamining whether disease {{cases are}} {{clustered}} in space {{is an important}} part of epidemiological research. Another important part of spatial epidemiology is testing whether patients suffering from a disease are more, or less, exposed to environmental factors of interest than adequately defined controls. Both approaches involve determining the number of cases and controls (or population at risk) in specific zones. For cluster searches, this often must be done for millions of different zones. Doing this by calculating distances can lead to very lengthy computations. In this work we discuss the computational advantages of geographical grid-based methods, and introduce an open source software (FGBASE) which we have created for this purpose. MethodsGeographical grids based on the Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area projection are well suited for spatial epidemiology because they preserve area: each cell of the grid has the same area. We describe how data is projected onto such a grid, as well as grid-based algorithms for spatial epidemiological data-mining. The software program (FGBASE), that we have developed, implements these grid-based methods. ResultsThe grid based algorithms perform extremely fast. This is particularly the case for cluster searches. When applied to a cohort of French Type 1 Diabetes (T 1 D) patients, as an example, the grid based algorithms detected potential clusters in a few seconds on a modern laptop. This compares very favorably to an equivalent cluster search using distance calculations instead of a grid, which took over 4 hours on the same computer. In the case study we discovered 4 potential clusters of T 1 D cases near the <b>cities</b> <b>of</b> <b>Le</b> <b>Havre,</b> Dunkerque, Toulouse and Nantes. One example of environmental analysis with our software was to study whether a significant association could be found between distance to vineyards with heavy pesticide. None was found. In both examples, the software facilitates the rapid testing of hypotheses. ConclusionsGrid-based algorithms for mining spatial epidemiological data provide advantages in terms of computational complexity thus improving the speed of computations. We believe that these methods and this software tool (FGBASE) will lower the computational barriers to entry for those performing epidemiological research...|$|R
