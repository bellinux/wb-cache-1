40|$|Abstract — The Internet {{traditionally}} provides {{best effort}} service to all applications. While elastic applications are satisfied by this service, inelastic {{applications such as}} interactive audio and video suffer from end-to-end delay guarantees. Although Guaranteed Rate schedulers were developed to provide such guarantees, their scalability has been a concern because they maintain per-flow state. In {{an effort to reduce}} per-flow state, two methods have been proposed: stateless <b>core</b> <b>networks</b> and flow aggregation. Stateless <b>core</b> <b>networks</b> require no per-flow state at the routers, while flow aggregation maintains state for a small number of aggregate flows. Although flow aggregation maintains more state, it provides a lower end-to-end delay bound than stateless <b>core</b> <b>networks.</b> The original proposals of these two techniques did not provide guaranteed throughput, that is, flows could be temporarily denied service if they exceeded their reserved rates at earlier times. Recently, guaranteed throughput has been incorporated into the stateless core model through the reuse of deadlines. This is similar to the deadline reuse found in earlier stateful protocols that provide guaranteed throughput. In this paper, we propose adding deadline reuse to flow aggregation networks. In this way, guaranteed throughput can be achieved while maintaining a lower end-to-end delay bound. In addition, we revise the deadline reuse method for stateless <b>core</b> <b>networks.</b> I...|$|R

SoftCell enables operators to realize high-level service policies that direct traffic through sequences of middleboxes based on subscriber attributes and applications. To minimize the size of the forwarding tables, SoftCell aggregates traffic along multiple dimensions—the service policy, the base station, and the mobile device—at different switches in the network. Since most traffic originates from mobile devices, SoftCell performs fine-grained packet classification at the access switches, next to the base stations, where software switches can easily handle the state and bandwidth requirements. SoftCell guarantees that packets belonging to the same connection traverse the same sequence of middleboxes in both directions, even in the presence of mobility. We demonstrate that SoftCell improves the scalability and flexibility of cellular <b>core</b> <b>networks</b> by analyzing real LTE workloads, performing micro-benchmarks on our prototype controller as well as large-scale simulations...|$|R
