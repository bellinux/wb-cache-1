25|$|Rotations {{of plants}} with nematode-resistant species or {{varieties}} is one means of managing parasitic nematode infestations. For example, marigolds, grown over {{one or more}} seasons (the effect is cumulative), {{can be used to}} control nematodes. Another is treatment with natural antagonists such as the fungus Gliocladium roseum. Chitosan, a natural biocontrol, elicits plant defense responses to destroy parasitic cyst nematodes on roots of soybean, <b>corn,</b> <b>sugar</b> beet, potato, and tomato crops without harming beneficial nematodes in the soil. Soil steaming is an efficient method to kill nematodes before planting a crop, but indiscriminately eliminates both harmful and beneficial soil fauna.|$|E

Fish products from these towns are received by Sipocot. Other towns not mentioned have a fishing industry as the main base of their economy.|$|E
25|$|Ethanol fuel is {{the most}} common biofuel worldwide, {{particularly}} in Brazil. Alcohol fuels are produced by fermentation of sugars derived from wheat, <b>corn,</b> <b>sugar</b> beets, sugar cane, molasses and any sugar or starch from which alcoholic beverages such as whiskey, can be made (such as potato and fruit waste, etc.). The ethanol production methods used are enzyme digestion (to release sugars from stored starches), fermentation of the sugars, distillation and drying. The distillation process requires significant energy input for heat (sometimes unsustainable natural gas fossil fuel, but cellulosic biomass such as bagasse, the waste left after sugar cane is pressed to extract its juice, {{is the most}} common fuel in Brazil, while pellets, wood chips and also waste heat are more common in Europe) Waste steam fuels ethanol factory – where waste heat from the factories also is used in the district heating grid.|$|E

500|$|Nevertheless, Smith {{returned}} {{a report to}} the Secretary of the Treasury asking for $500,000 to do the job. The report is the first published study on the topic of the Everglades, and concluded with the statement: The Ever Glades are now suitable only for the haunt of noxious vermin or the resort of pestilent reptiles. The statesman whose exertions shall cause the millions of acres they contain, now worse than worthless, to teem with the products of agricultural industry; that man who thus adds to the resources of his country... will merit a high place in public favor, not only with his own generation, but with posterity. He will have created a State! Smith suggested cutting through the rim of the Everglades (known today as the Atlantic Coastal Ridge), connecting the heads of rivers to the coastline so that [...] of water would be drained from the area. The result, Smith hoped, would yield farmland suitable for <b>corn,</b> <b>sugar,</b> rice, cotton, and tobacco.|$|E

Across the region, Francelia caused widespread power outages. Along the Ulúa River, several residents were stranded when their cars stalled in flooded roadways. The floods wrecked four bridges on a road between La Lima and Tela. Flooding also ruined over 50% of the United Fruit Company's banana crop, forcing over [...] to be replaced.

United Nations Development Programme received $30,000 from the Government of Norway to give immediate relief to the country of Belize.

Around that time, the Belize Red Cross Society (BRCS) distributed relief items to 4,622 victims in Belize City. The BRCS also shipped [...] two containers with kitchen sets and water buckets for 1,600 families, donated by the German Red Cross. A donation account to help the relief effort, titled Hurricane Keith Relief Fund, was set up by the town of Placencia, in the local Atlantic Bank.

2500|$|Biofuel {{production}} {{has increased in}} recent years. Some commodities like maize (<b>corn),</b> <b>sugar</b> cane or vegetable oil can be used either as food, feed, or to make biofuels. [...] For example, since 2006, a portion of land that was also formerly used to grow other crops in the United States is now used to grow corn for biofuels, and {{a larger share of}} corn is destined to ethanol production, reaching 25% in 2007. [...] Second generation biofuels could potentially combine farming for food and fuel and moreover, electricity could be generated simultaneously, which could be beneficial for developing countries and rural areas in developed countries.|$|E
