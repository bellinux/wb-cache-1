50|$|Island Escape: The players met up {{with the}} host on the beach, who {{revealed}} that their assignment was to build a raft out of a pile of junk {{on the beach and}} take it out to a rescue boat out in the water, where $5,000 awaited them. They had one hour to reach the boat, and they needed to use everything present on the beach and to get all of them to the rescue boat for the money to be won. Midway through the challenge, the host asked them who among them they thought was least helpful in building the raft. The players chose Kris, and she was given the opportunity to search for coins buried in the beach with a metal detector, and if she could accumulate 2,000 <b>CFP</b> <b>Francs,</b> she could rent a kayak and row out to the rescue boat and win the $5,000 that way. However, as she normally required reading glasses that she didnt have with her, she was unable to discern the values of what coins she was able to find and was unable to get enough money to rent the kayak. The raft eventually made it out to the rescue boat, but they finished 1 minute, 38 seconds outside the time limit and won nothing.|$|R
25|$|The <b>CFP</b> <b>franc</b> {{was created}} in December 1945, {{together}} with the CFA franc, used in Africa. The reason {{for the creation of}} these francs was the weakness of the French franc immediately after the Second World War. When France ratified the Bretton Woods Agreement in December 1945, the French franc was devalued in order to set a fixed exchange rate with the US dollar. New currencies were created in the French colonies to spare them the strong devaluation of December 1945. René Pleven, the French minister of finance, was quoted saying: “In a show of her generosity and selflessness, metropolitan France, wishing not to impose on her far-away daughters the consequences of her own poverty, is setting different exchange rates for their currency.” The CFA franc and the other colonial currencies were set at a fixed exchange rate with the French franc. However, the <b>CFP</b> <b>franc</b> was set at a fixed exchange rate with the US dollar, which {{played a major role in}} the economy of the French Pacific territories on account of World War II. That situation ended in September 1949 when the <b>CFP</b> <b>franc</b> was given a fixed exchange rate with the French franc.|$|E
25|$|The new highest {{denomination}} 10,000 <b>CFP</b> <b>franc</b> banknote (83.8 euro) {{issued on}} 1 October 1986, {{was the first}} one that was not overprinted with a city name. The 500 franc banknote, issued in 1992, and the 1000 and 5000 franc banknotes, issued in 1995, are also without the overprint. The designs of the 500, 1000, 5000 franc banknotes did not change till 2014, when new designs and sizes were introduced.|$|E
25|$|The <b>CFP</b> <b>franc</b> is {{currently}} {{used as a}} euro pegged currency by three French overseas collectivities: French Polynesia, Wallis and Futuna and New Caledonia. The French government has recommended that all three territories decide in favour of adopting the euro. French Polynesia has declared themselves in favour of joining the eurozone. Wallis and Futuna announced a neutral standpoint, that they would support a currency choice similar to what New Caledonia chooses. However, New Caledonia has not yet made any decision, because they first await the fallout of an independence referendum, scheduled {{to be held at}} the latest in November 2018, as this might influence their opinion whether or not to adopt the euro. If the three collectivities decide to adopt the euro, the French government would make an application on their behalf to the European Council, and the switch to the euro could be made after a couple of years. If the collectivities fail to reach a unanimous decision {{about the future of the}} <b>CFP</b> <b>franc,</b> it would be technically possible to implement an individual currency decision for each territory.|$|E
25|$|Overseas collectivities and territories {{form part}} of the French Republic, but do not {{form part of}} the European Union or its fiscal area (with the {{exception}} of St. Bartelemy, which seceded from Guadeloupe in 2007). The Pacific Collectivities (COMs) of French Polynesia, Wallis and Futuna, and New Caledonia continue to use the <b>CFP</b> <b>franc</b> whose value is strictly linked {{to that of the}} euro. In contrast, the five overseas regions used the French franc and now use the euro.|$|E
25|$|New Caledonia {{has one of}} {{the largest}} economies in the South Pacific, with a GDP of US$9.89 billion in 2011. The nominal GDP per capita was US$38,921 (at market {{exchange}} rates) in 2011. It is higher than New Zealand's, though there is significant inequality in income distribution, and long-standing structural imbalances between the economically dominant South Province and the less developed North Province and Loyalty Islands. The currency in use in New Caledonia is the <b>CFP</b> <b>franc,</b> pegged to the euro at a rate of 1,000 CFP to 8.38 euros. It is issued by the Institut d'Emission d'Outre-Mer.|$|E
25|$|The {{legal tender}} of French Polynesia is the <b>CFP</b> <b>Franc</b> {{which has a}} fixed {{exchange}} rate with the Euro. The nominal gross domestic product (or GDP) of French Polynesia in 2014 was 5.623billion US dollars at market local prices, the sixth-largest economy in Oceania after Australia, New Zealand, Hawaii, New Caledonia, and Papua New Guinea. The GDP per capita was $20,098 in 2014 (at market exchange rates, not at PPP), lower than in Hawaii, Australia, New Zealand, and New Caledonia, but higher than all the independent insular states of Oceania. Both per capita and total figures were significantly lower than those recorded before the financial crisis of 2007–08.|$|E
500|$|Outside the eurozone, a {{total of}} 22 {{countries}} and territories that {{do not belong to}} the EU have currencies that are directly pegged to the euro including 13 countries in mainland Africa (CFA franc), two African island countries (Comorian franc and Cape Verdean escudo), three French Pacific territories (<b>CFP</b> <b>franc)</b> and three Balkan countries, Bosnia and Herzegovina (Bosnia and Herzegovina convertible mark), Bulgaria (Bulgarian lev) and Macedonia (Macedonian denar). [...] On 28 July 2009, São Tomé and Príncipe signed an agreement with Portugal which will eventually tie its currency to the euro. Additionally, the Moroccan dirham is tied to a basket of currencies, including the euro and the US dollar, with the euro given the highest weighting.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>CFP</b> <b>franc</b> (called the franc in {{everyday}} use) is {{the currency used}} in the French overseas collectivities (collectivités d’outre-mer, or COM) of French Polynesia, New Caledonia and Wallis and Futuna. The initials CFP originally stood for [...] (“French colonies of the Pacific”). This was later changed to [...] (“Pacific Financial Community”) {{and then to the}} present term, [...] (“Pacific Franc Exchange”). The ISO 4217 currency code is XPF.|$|E
2500|$|Saint-Pierre and Miquelon, Saint Barthélemy, French Polynesia, and Wallis and Futuna are {{overseas}} collectivities (formerly {{referred to}} as overseas territories) of France, while New Caledonia is a [...] "sui generis collectivity". Saint Barthélemy and Saint-Pierre and Miquelon use the euro, while New Caledonia, French Polynesia and Wallis and Futuna use the <b>CFP</b> <b>Franc,</b> a currency which {{is tied to the}} euro and guaranteed by France. Natives of the collectivities are European citizens owing to their French citizenship and elections to the European Parliament are held in the collectivities.|$|E
2500|$|The CFA franc {{was created}} on 26 December 1945, {{along with the}} <b>CFP</b> <b>franc.</b> The reason for their {{creation}} was {{the weakness of the}} French franc immediately after World War II. [...] When France ratified the Bretton Woods Agreement in December 1945, the French franc was devalued in order to set a fixed exchange rate with the US dollar. New currencies were created in the French colonies to spare them the strong devaluation, thereby facilitating exports to France. French officials presented the decision as an act of generosity.

50|$|Until 1873, the French franc {{circulated}} on New Caledonia. That year banknotes {{were issued}} specifically {{for use on}} the island which circulated along with French coins. In 1945, the <b>CFP</b> <b>franc</b> was introduced, with coins issued for New Caledonia from 1949. The <b>CFP</b> <b>franc</b> is also issued in French Polynesia and {{was used in the}} New Hebrides until 1983. Since 1985, banknotes have been issued common to both New Caledonia and French Polynesia, although separate coinages continue.|$|E

50|$|Until 1914, the French franc {{circulated}} in French Polynesia. That year, banknotes were issued specifically {{for use on}} in the colony which circulated along with French coins. In 1945, the <b>CFP</b> <b>franc</b> was introduced, with coins issued for French Oceania (Etablisements Français de l'Océanie as the colony was then known) from 1949. From 1965, the name French Polynesia (Polynésie Française) has been used. The <b>CFP</b> <b>franc</b> is also issued in New Caledonia and {{was used in the}} New Hebrides until 1983.

50|$|In February 1976, stamps {{identical}} to those used in Metropolitan France arrived. Like in the Réunion in January 1975, the French franc replaced the CFA franc through the Institut d'émission d'Outre-Mer, the <b>CFP</b> <b>franc</b> issuing bank.|$|E

50|$|When France {{adopted the}} euro, {{so did the}} French {{overseas}} departments and territories that used the French franc. The <b>CFP</b> <b>franc,</b> the CFA franc and the Comorian franc, {{that are used in}} overseas territories and some African countries, had fixed exchange rates with the French franc, but not at par - for various historical reasons they were worth considerably less, at 1 French franc = 18.2 CFP francs, 75 Comorian francs or 100 CFA francs. The CFA franc and the Comorian franc are linked to the euro at fixed rates with free convertibility maintained {{at the expense of the}} French Treasury. The <b>CFP</b> <b>franc</b> is linked to the euro at a fixed rate.|$|E

50|$|The {{economy of}} the island is {{dependent}} on its chief produce of copra, cassava, yams, tarro roots, and bananas. Livestock consists of 25,000 pigs and 7,000 goats. The unit of currency is the <b>CFP</b> <b>franc.</b> The balance of imports is not favorable to the islands as imports exceed exports.|$|E
50|$|The {{island is}} part of the commune (municipality) of Lifou, in the Loyalty Islands Province of New Caledonia. The {{administrative}} center of the commune is located at Wé, {{on the east side of}} Lifou Island at Chateaubriand Bay. The local currency is the <b>CFP</b> <b>Franc</b> (French Pacific Franc).|$|E
50|$|Opponents {{of these}} changes argued that {{the real reason for}} them was Britain's {{impending}} entry to the EEC, and that France was concerned about Britain's close economic ties with the Commonwealth and the sterling area, even though France continued to have special economic relations with its less successful former colonies in the CFA and <b>CFP</b> <b>franc</b> zones.|$|E
50|$|The Franc was the {{currency}} of the Anglo-French Condominium of the Pacific island group of the New Hebrides (which became Vanuatu in 1980). It circulated alongside British and later Australian currency. The New Hebrides franc was nominally divided into 100 Centimes, although the smallest denomination was the 1 franc. Between 1945 and 1969, {{it was part of}} the <b>CFP</b> <b>franc.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1949, the CFP franc's {{relationship}} to the French franc stabilized at 5.5 French francs = 1 <b>CFP</b> <b>franc.</b> From 1959, the exchange rate to the Australian pound was almost exactly 200 francs = 1 pound. This rate became 100 francs = 1 Australian dollar in 1966 when the dollar was introduced. The Australian dollar circulated alongside the local currency.|$|E
50|$|From 1966, coins were {{produced}} {{in the name of}} the New Hebrides. In 1969, the New Hebrides franc broke away from the <b>CFP</b> <b>franc</b> and maintained the relationship with the Australian dollar of 100 francs = 1 dollar until 1973. In 1981, the franc was replaced at par by the vatu following independence as Vanuatu. At the same time, the Australian dollar ceased to officially circulate.|$|E
50|$|The legal {{currency}} in those overseas territories is the Euro since 1999 (before {{it was the}} French franc), including in OCTs (by special agreement with the European Union) except those in the Pacific section which still use the <b>CFP</b> <b>franc</b> (bound to the Euro by a special agreement between France and the European Union, but with a revokable rate of 8.38 EUR for 1,000 XPF).|$|E
50|$|Until World War II, the New Hebrides {{used the}} French franc and the British and Australian pounds. In 1941, the Free French forces {{introduced}} paper money for circulation on the New Hebrides. In 1945, the <b>CFP</b> <b>franc</b> {{was introduced to}} insulate France's Pacific colonies from the devaluation of the French franc and the New Hebrides used a combination of New Caledonian franc coins and locally issued notes.|$|E
