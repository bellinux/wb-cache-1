5|$|According to the Miami Herald the {{financing}} {{structure of the}} plan is notable {{for the amount of}} financial risk taken by the builders in return for the long term concession on the tunnel. Opposition to the project states that it is a waste of taxpayer money, and may become Miami's Big Dig, the nickname of a tunnel megaproject in Boston, which was a $4 billion project that ended up costing $22 billion in cost overruns. Many believe that the Port of Miami Tunnel Project will be likely to have similar cost overruns, even though the Secretary of the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) promised that the project would finish on time and without overruns.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{potential}} benefits from separating <b>cars</b> <b>and</b> <b>trucks</b> onto different lanes or roads while treating road infrastructure as given. U. S. studies of mixed traffic operations, lane restrictions and differential speed limits do not provide consistent evidence whether separating <b>cars</b> <b>and</b> <b>trucks</b> either facilitates traffic flows or reduces accident rates. Analysis with an economic model reveals that {{the potential benefits}} depend on the relative volumes of <b>cars</b> <b>and</b> <b>trucks,</b> capacity indivisibilities <b>and</b> the impedance and safety hazard that each vehicle type imposes. Differentiated tolls can support efficient allocations of <b>cars</b> <b>and</b> <b>trucks</b> between lanes. Lane access restrictions are much more limited in effectiveness. Toll lanes that are dedicated to either cars or trucks are a potentially attractive hybrid policy. Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) technology can help to improve safety and travel time reliability, and help drivers select between tolled and untolled routes. ...|$|R

Clearances for spring travel were also improved for a smoother ride over all types of surfaces; the coil springs at each wheel were computer-selected to match the individual car's weight. Front disc brakes were now standard on all '73 Chevelles. John Z. DeLorean, Chevrolet's dynamic general manager during the design phase of the new Chevelles, left just as they were being announced. He departed in late September 1972 to start a brief stint as vice president of General Motors's <b>Car</b> <b>and</b> <b>Truck</b> Group. DeLorean left the new Chevelle an important legacy, though. He and Alex Mair, then Chevrolet's chief engineer, championed great handling. Critics compared the GM Colonnade line favorably to Ford and Chrysler intermediates which had unattractive styling and less interior room.|$|E

Many aspects went into filming the crash scene in the season finale [...] "Devil's Trap". For the interior scenes used in the first moments of the Impala being hit, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Padalecki, and Ackles were required to sit in the car, which was in front of a blue screen. A sheet of Lexan placed very close to the passenger-side window protected the actors as the window was shattered, and at the same time, cannons beneath the frame blew out pieces of rubber glass to give the appearance that the window exploded onto them.

This paper explores one aspect of truck lanes by considering whether there are advantages in separating <b>cars</b> <b>and</b> <b>trucks.</b> The benefits of vehicle separation are found to depend on several factors: the relative volumes of <b>cars</b> <b>and</b> <b>trucks,</b> the congestion delay and safety hazards that each type of vehicle imposes, values of travel time for <b>cars</b> <b>and</b> <b>trucks,</b> <b>and</b> lane capacity indivisibilities. The optimal assignment of vehicles to lanes can be supported using tolls that are differentiated by vehicle type and route. By contrast, lane access restrictions generally cannot support the optimum and may provide no benefit at all. truck-only facilities, segregation, congestion, accidents, marginal-cost pricing...|$|R

At Chevrolet, Cole pushed for many of the major engineering and design advancements introduced in the Chevrolet <b>car</b> <b>and</b> <b>truck</b> lines between 1955 and 1962. He was the moving force behind the development and production of the rear-engined, air-cooled Corvair. Despite its infamous history, the Corvair was a ground-breaking car in its day.

Ford received US$2.3 billion on the sale, considerably below what they paid for it under Nasser and Donald Petersen. However, analysts said that Ford would have gotten much less or might not have found a buyer if they had tried to sell it later in 2008, as Jaguar Land Rover sales subsequently plummeted due to high oil prices in the summer, causing Tata to request a bailout from the British government.

I have to do them, and unfortunately the nature of our business just didn't permit me to do as much as I wanted." [...] although it was rumored that he had been fired. GM gave him a Florida Cadillac franchise as a retirement gift, and DeLorean did in fact take over the presidency of The National Alliance of Businessmen, a charitable organization with the mission of employing Americans in need, founded by Lyndon Johnson and Henry Ford. GM was a major contributor to the group, and agreed to continue his salary while he remained president of NAB. DeLorean was sharply critical of the direction GM had taken by the start of the 1970s, saying [...] "There's no forward response at General Motors to what the public wants today." [...] He also objected to the idea of using rebates to sell cars on the grounds that [...] "A car should make people's eyes light up when they step into the showroom.
