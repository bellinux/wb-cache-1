5|$|About {{three-quarters of}} dietary calcium is from dairy {{products}} and grains, the rest being {{accounted for by}} vegetables, protein-rich foods, fruits, sugar, fats, and oil. Calcium supplementation is controversial, as the bioavailability of calcium {{is strongly dependent on}} the solubility of the salt involved: <b>calcium</b> <b>citrate,</b> malate, and lactate are highly bioavailable while the oxalate is much less so. The intestine absorbs about one-third of calcium eaten as the free ion, and plasma calcium level is then regulated by the kidneys. Parathyroid hormone and vitamin D promote the formation of bone by allowing and enhancing the deposition of calcium ions there, allowing rapid bone turnover without affecting bone mass or mineral content. When plasma calcium levels fall, cell surface receptors are activated and the secretion of parathyroid hormone occurs; it then proceeds to stimulate the entry of calcium into the plasma pool by taking it from targeted kidney, gut, and bone cells, with the bone-forming action of parathyroid hormone being antagonised by calcitonin, whose secretion increases with increasing plasma calcium levels.|$|E

25|$|Industrial-scale {{citric acid}} {{production}} first began in 1890 {{based on the}} Italian citrus fruit industry, where the juice was treated with hydrated lime (calcium hydroxide) to precipitate <b>calcium</b> <b>citrate,</b> which was isolated and converted back to the acid using diluted sulfuric acid. In 1893, C. Wehmer discovered Penicillium mold could produce citric acid from sugar. However, microbial production of citric acid did not become industrially important until World War I disrupted Italian citrus exports.|$|E
40|$|The changes which {{occur in}} both <b>calcium</b> and <b>citrate</b> {{excretion}} in normal persons, in idiopathic calcium stone formers and in persons with hyperparathyroidism have been measured at {{high and low}} levels of dietary calcium intake. The findings suggested a difference in the renal handling of calcium between normal subjects and stone formers. There was a greater increase in the urinary excretion of calcium with increased intake of calcium in individuals with renal calculi than in normals. Increasing the calcium intake shifted the mole ratio of <b>calcium</b> to <b>citrate</b> unfavourably for the chelation of <b>calcium</b> by <b>citrate,</b> and this unfavourable shift was more marked in the stone formers than in normal individuals. These findings support the concept that urinary citrate may be of importance in the prevention of calcium precipitation and hence in the pathogenesis of kidney stones...|$|R
40|$|A urinary calcium–citrate {{index for}} the {{evaluation}} of nephrolithiasis. We have performed a multivariate analysis of urine abnormalities in patients with calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis, in which effects of gender were also considered. The characteristic of patients that most clearly sets them apart from normal people is a high level of urine calcium for any given level of urine citrate. Other urine measurements cannot improve upon the separation between patients and normals provided by urine <b>calcium</b> and <b>citrate,</b> and their abnormal relationship to each other. Normal women have higher urine citrate and lower urine calcium than normal men or patients of either sex; normal men differ from stone forming men only moderately. Direct measurements of supersaturation are not helpful in distinguishing between patients and normals, once <b>calcium</b> and <b>citrate</b> have been considered. From our analysis, we have derived a new index for evaluating the significance of urine <b>calcium</b> and <b>citrate</b> levels that seems to offer a better basis for clinical diagnosis than criteria presently in use...|$|R

After the mold is filtered out of the resulting solution, citric acid is isolated by precipitating it with calcium hydroxide to yield <b>calcium</b> <b>citrate</b> salt, from which citric acid is regenerated by treatment with sulfuric acid, as in the direct extraction from citrus fruit juice.|$|E
25|$|World War I {{caused a}} {{shortage}} of <b>calcium</b> <b>citrate</b> that Pfizer imported from Italy for the manufacture of citric acid, and the company began a search for an alternative supply. Pfizer chemists learned of a fungus that ferments sugar to citric acid {{and were able to}} commercialize production of citric acid from this source in 1919. As a result, Pfizer developed expertise in fermentation technology. These skills were applied to the mass production of the antibiotic penicillin during World War II in response to the need of the U.S. government to treat injured Allied soldiers; most of the penicillin that went ashore with the troops on D-Day was made by Pfizer.|$|E

40|$|Background: When usual calcium {{consumption}} patterns were analysed {{most people in}} the U. S. and Europe consume less than the recommended daily allowance. Supplements and fortified foods offer alternative and additional sources of calcium to traditional food. Calcium carbonate is the most common supplement but it is less soluble in water and, therefore, not suitable for enrichment of beverages. New organic calcium salts have a better solubility but less is known about their bioavailability. In the present study, we assessed the solubility and bioavailability of the new organic calcium salts, <b>calcium</b> lactate <b>citrate</b> and <b>calcium</b> lactate malate, in comparison to the traditional supplements, calcium carbonate and calcium gluconate. Design: Randomized, single-blind, four way cross-over study comparing single doses of 500 mg calcium in the form of four different calcium-salts. Subjects were advised to consume 25 µg vitamin D 3 daily two weeks {{prior to the start of}} the study and during the whole study period. Subjects: 20 healthy young men, Methods: Blood samples were drawn immediately before and 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24 h after ingestion of the calcium preparation. Concentration of total calcium and intact parathyroid hormone were measured in the serum. Urine was collected at baseline and during the intervals 0 - 3, 3 - 6, 9 - 15 and 15 - 24 h and excretion of calcium, sodium and creatinine was examined. Results: The tested new salts were easily water soluble, significantly better than calcium gluconate. Calcium carbonate is almost insoluble. The bioavailability of the four different calcium salts was found to be almost identical. The maximum total serum calcium increased by 7. 6 % two hours after ingestion <b>calcium</b> lactate <b>citrate,</b> by 7. 4 % after calcium lactate malate, by 5. 5 % after calcium carbonate, and by 5. 8 % after calcium gluconate. Intact parathyroid hormone concentration showed the expected depression for <b>calcium</b> lactate <b>citrate,</b> <b>calcium</b> lactate malate and calcium carbonate, whereas the serum level was significantly higher after ingestion of calcium gluconate. Conclusion: Given an almost equivalent bioavailability of the four tested calcium salts, we conclude that the new salts <b>calcium</b> lactate <b>citrate</b> and <b>calcium</b> lactate malate are well suited for fortification of beverages and thus to increase the average daily calcium intake...|$|R

40|$|Urinary citrate is an {{important}} inhibitor of calcium nephrolithiasis and is primarily determined by proximal tubule reabsorption. The major transporter to reabsorb citrate is Na+-dicarboxylate cotransporter (NaDC 1), which transports dicarboxylates, including the divalent form of citrate. We previously found that opossum kidney (OK) proximal tubule cells variably express either divalent or trivalent citrate transport, depending on extracellular calcium. The present studies were performed to delineate the mechanism {{of the effect of}} <b>calcium</b> on <b>citrate</b> and succinate transport in these cells. Transport was measured using isotope uptake assays. In some studies, NaDC 1 transport was studied in Xenopus oocytes, expressing either the rabbit or opossum ortholog. In the OK cell culture model, lowering extracellular <b>calcium</b> increased both <b>citrate</b> and succinate transport by more than twofold; the effect was specific in that glucose transport was not altered. Citrate and succinate were found to reciprocally inhibit transport at low extracellular calcium (< 60 μM), but not at normal calcium (1. 2 mM); this mutual inhibition is consistent with dicarboxylate transport. The inhibition varied progressively at intermediate levels of extracellular calcium. In addition to changing the relative magnitude and interaction of citrate and succinate transport, decreasing calcium also increased the affinity of the transport process for various other dicarboxylates. Also, the affinity for succinate, at low concentrations of substrate, was increased by calcium removal. In contrast, in oocytes expressing NaDC 1, calcium did not have a similar effect on transport, indicating that NaDC 1 could not likely account for the findings in OK cells. In summary, extracellular <b>calcium</b> regulates constitutive <b>citrate</b> and succinate transport in OK proximal tubule cells, probably via a novel transport process that is not NaDC 1. The <b>calcium</b> effect on <b>citrate</b> transport parallels in vivo studies that demonstrate the regulation of urinary citrate excretion with urinary calcium excretion, a process that may be important in decreasing urinary calcium stone formation...|$|R
50|$|<b>Calcium</b> <b>citrate</b> is {{the calcium}} salt of citric acid. It is {{commonly}} used as a food additive (E333), usually as a preservative, but sometimes for flavor. In this sense, it is similar to sodium citrate. <b>Calcium</b> <b>citrate</b> {{is also found in}} some dietary calcium supplements (e.g. Citracal).

50|$|<b>Calcium</b> <b>citrate</b> is an {{intermediate}} in {{the isolation of}} citric acid from the fermentation process by which citric acid is produced industrially.

5000|$|In many individuals, {{bioavailability}} of <b>calcium</b> <b>citrate</b> {{is found}} to be equal to that of the cheaper calcium carbonate. However, alterations to the digestive tract may change how calcium is digested and absorbed.

Calcium carbonate is harder to digest than <b>calcium</b> <b>citrate,</b> and calcium carbonate carries a risk of [...] "acid rebound" [...] (the stomach overcompensates by producing more acid), so individuals who are sensitive to antacids or who have difficulty producing adequate stomach acid may choose <b>calcium</b> <b>citrate</b> over calcium carbonate for supplementation. According to recent research into calcium absorption after gastric bypass surgery, <b>calcium</b> <b>citrate</b> may have improved bioavailability over calcium carbonate in Roux-en-Y gastric bypass patients who are taking <b>calcium</b> <b>citrate</b> as a dietary supplement after surgery.

40|$|Metabolic {{evaluation}} of stone-forming (SF) patients {{is based on}} the determination of <b>calcium,</b> oxalate, <b>citrate,</b> uric acid and other parameters in 24 -h urine samples under a random diet. A reliable measurement of urinary oxalate requires the collection of urine in a receptacle containing acid preservative. However, urinary uric acid cannot be determined in the same sample under this condition. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that the addition of preservatives (acid or alkali) after urine collection would not modify the results of those lithogenic parameters. Thirty-four healthy subjects (HS) were submitted to two non-consecutive collections of 24 -h urine. the first sample was collected in a receptacle containing hydrochloric acid (HCl 6 N) and the second in a dry plastic container, with HCl being added as soon as the urine sample was received at the laboratory. Additionally, 34 HS and 34 SF patients collected a spot urine sample that was divided into four aliquots, one containing HCl, another containing sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO 3 5 g/l), and two others in which these two preservative agents were added 24 h later. Urinary oxalate, <b>calcium,</b> magnesium, <b>citrate,</b> creatinine and uric acid were determined. Urinary parameters were also evaluated in the presence of calcium oxalate or uric acid crystals. Mean values of all urinary parameters obtained from previously acidified 24 -h urine samples did not differ from those where acid was added after urine collection. the same was true for spot urine samples, with the exception of urinary citrate that presented a slight albeit significant change of 5. 9 % between samples in HS and 3. 1 % in SE Uric acid was also not different between pre- and post-alkalinized spot urine samples. the presence of crystals did not alter these results. We concluded that post-delivery acidification or alkalinization of urine samples does not modify the measured levels of urinary oxalate, calcium, magnesium, creatinine and uric acid, and that the change on citrate was not relevant, hence allowing all parameters to be determined in a single urine sample, thus avoiding the inconvenience and cost of multiple 24 -h urine sample collections.
