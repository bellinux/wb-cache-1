The acts willing to audition were required to upload videos of their performances to Shakira's official website. Fans were allowed to vote for their favourite acts and the ones with the most would proceed to the finals; Shakira and her team would then pick the winner out of them. Sean Wolfington, Shakira's digital-business partner, talked about the decision and told the New York Post that [...] "The artists will open for Shakira live in big cities and virtually through a video performance in smaller markets. There are a lot of talented artists, and Shakira wants to help them by giving them part of her stage". The visuals and conceptual video scenes for the tour were managed and designed by entertainment branding agency Loyalkaspar, who had previously designed tour visuals for artists like U2 and Jay-Z. Elliott <b>Chaffer,</b> the creative director of the agency, talked about the project, saying that [...] "Shakira was a much bigger undertaking then anything we've attempted previously. They were looking for original content that had to work over two LED screens and on a huge projector mapping surreal models of an ever-changing animated face, all in just three weeks. This is for her global world tour, so modifications to the setlist and track durations continued through nine rounds of revisions". The visuals were projected onto the large screen set behind the stage. The stage was shaped {{in the form of the}} letter [...] "T" [...] to enable a maximum number of viewers to see Shakira.|$|E

5000|$|Alexander <b>Chaffers,</b> a {{solicitor}} whose actions led to {{the first}} British law against vexatious litigation, the Vexatious Actions Act, 1896. <b>Chaffers</b> became notorious after accusing the wife of Travers Twiss of being a prostitute, and subsequently issued 48 proceedings against leading members of Victorian society in the 1890s. Costs awarded against <b>Chaffers</b> were never paid. After the act was passed, {{he became the first}} person to be declared a habitually vexatious litigant and barred from future litigation without judicial permission.|$|R
5000|$|In 1871, Twiss became {{involved}} in an unpleasant scandal, which brought his career to an end. In 1862 he had married the 22-year-old Marie van Lynnseele, who he presented {{as the daughter of}} a Polish aristocrat. A solicitor named Alexander <b>Chaffers</b> claimed that Marie was in reality a French former prostitute who went by the name [...] "Marie Gelas", and had been Twiss's mistress before their marriage. <b>Chaffers,</b> who also claimed to have been one of her lovers, was allegedly blackmailing her, sending her bills for imaginary [...] "services rendered", which she initially paid. When she refused to pay any more, <b>Chaffers</b> made a statutory declaration about her, which he sent to various bishops and to the Lord Chamberlain. Charges of libel were brought against <b>Chaffers,</b> but were dropped when Marie Twiss broke down under ruthless cross-examination by <b>Chaffers</b> and then fled the country. Twiss was humiliated. He resigned from all his appointments and lived in retirement in London until his death. He never again saw his wife. Chaffers' subsequent vexatious litigation led to the passing of the Vexatious Actions Act in 1896. He died in a workhouse.|$|R
