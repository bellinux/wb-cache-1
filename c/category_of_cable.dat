50|$|The {{intent of}} these {{standards}} {{is to provide}} recommended practices for the design and installation <b>of</b> <b>cabling</b> systems that will support {{a wide variety of}} existing and future services. Developers hope the standards will provide a lifespan for commercial cabling systems in excess of ten years. This effort has been largely successful, as evidenced by the definition <b>of</b> <b>category</b> 5 <b>cabling</b> in 1991, a cabling standard that (mostly) satisfied cabling requirements for 1000BASE-T, released in 1999. Thus, the standardization process can reasonably be said to have provided at least a nine-year lifespan for premises cabling, and arguably a longer one.|$|R

40|$|Coaxial user's {{radio-frequency}} cables {{belong to}} a <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>cable</b> television network elements parameters of which essentially specify the system capabilities as a whole. The cable working frequency spectrum spreading to 1000 MHz along with digital television and soundtrack signals transmission and high-definition television introduction causes more rigid requirements for wave impedance and, consequently, for the cable design. The established norms on user's cable impedance deviations fail to answer the state-of-the-art requirements for granting a complex of interactive services. On the basis of calculations performed, values of internal and external conductor diameters deviations as well as dielectric permeability of the insulation material are validated. For up-to-date user's radio-frequency cables, the impedance deviation from the normalized average value of 75 Ohm should not exceed ± 2 Ohm...|$|E
50|$|To {{convert a}} signal from {{balanced}} to unbalanced requires a balun. For example, baluns {{can be used to}} send line level audio or E-carrier level 1 signals over coaxial cable (which is unbalanced) through 300 ft <b>of</b> <b>category</b> 5 <b>cable</b> by using a pair of baluns {{at each end of the}} CAT5 run. The balun takes the unbalanced signal, and creates an inverted copy of that signal. It then sends these 2 signals across the CAT5 cable as a balanced, differential signal. Upon reception at the other end, the balun takes the difference of the two signals, thus removing any noise picked up along the way and recreating the unbalanced signal.|$|R

5000|$|Instead of {{following}} the Fast Ethernet standard for twisted pair cabling {{by using only}} 2 pairs of wires, 100VG-AnyLAN used all four pairs in either Category 3 or Category 5 twisted pair cable. The design goals were to avoid the radio frequency radiation emitted at the higher frequencies required by Fast Ethernet and to leverage existing wiring installations <b>of</b> <b>Category</b> 3 <b>cabling</b> that most organizations had recently installed to support 10 megabit twisted-pair Ethernet. This had the additional advantage of being less susceptible to external sources of RF interference such as other network cables, fluorescent lights, and high power lines. They multiplexed the signal across all 8 wires thereby lowering the frequency and making it more robust. This presented a problem with early installations that borrowed one unused twisted pair for telephone traffic but those installations were uncommon.|$|R

40|$|The {{internal}} defects <b>of</b> <b>cable</b> joints always {{accelerate the}} deterioration of insulation, until finally accidents can arise due to {{the explosion of the}} joints. The formation process of this damage often involves changes in the electromagnetic, temperature and stress distribution <b>of</b> the <b>cable</b> joint, therefore, it is necessary to analyze the electromagnetic-thermal-mechanical distribution <b>of</b> <b>cable</b> joints. Aiming at solving this problem, the paper sets up a 3 -D electromagnetic-thermal-mechanical coupling model <b>of</b> <b>cable</b> joints under crimping process defects. Based on the model, the electromagnetic losses distribution, temperature distribution and stress distribution <b>of</b> a <b>cable</b> joint and body are calculated. Then, the coupling fields characteristics in different contact coefficient k, ambient temperature Tamb and load current I were analyzed, and according to the thermal-mechanical characteristics <b>of</b> a <b>cable</b> joint under internal defects, the temperature difference ΔTf and stress difference Δσf <b>of</b> <b>cable</b> surface are applied to evaluate the internal cable joint defects. Finally, a simplified model <b>of</b> the <b>cable</b> joint is set up to verify the accuracy of the coupling field model proposed in this paper, which indicates that the model can be used to analyze the coupling fields characteristics <b>of</b> <b>cable</b> joints and the method can be applied to evaluate crimping process defects <b>of</b> <b>cable</b> joints...|$|R

40|$|The {{assessment}} of the suitability <b>of</b> <b>cables</b> <b>of</b> 6 – 110 kV with XLPE insulation in comparison with <b>cables</b> <b>of</b> the same voltage but possessing paper-oil insulation has been fulfilled {{on the basis of}} the criterion of reduced costs. Thus, the comparison was undertaken between <b>cables</b> <b>of</b> various design and material of insulation: three-core paper insulated ones vs. three-core XLPE insulated ones; three-core paper-insulated ones vs. solid wires with XLPE insulation; single-core oil-filled <b>cables</b> <b>of</b> 110 kV with paper insulation vs. solid wires of 110 kV with XLPE insulation. The increase in long-term permissible current loads for cables with XLPE insulation because of the larger permissible temperature of heating in comparison with cables with paper-oil insulation complies with as would increase in the cross-sectional area <b>of</b> <b>cable</b> cores (equal to 0. 61 from the original) and therefore reduces the cost <b>of</b> the <b>cable</b> by reducing the cost of manufacture of conductors. The reduced costs of the construction and operation <b>of</b> <b>cable</b> lines with XLPE insulation (accounting the increase in the cost <b>of</b> a <b>cable</b> 1. 2 and 2 times as compared with the cost <b>of</b> a <b>cable</b> with three-core insulation), despite the decline in the cost of manufacture of conductors and the reduced annual operating costs (9 % and 17 % respectively <b>of</b> <b>cable</b> lines <b>of</b> voltage of up to 35 kV and 110 kV), occurred to be more than the reduced costs of the construction and operation <b>of</b> <b>cable</b> lines with paper insulation.
