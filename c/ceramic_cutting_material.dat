40|$|A {{silicon nitride}} (Si 3 N 4) based <b>ceramic</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>material</b> and a {{structural}} alloy steel (SAE 4340) were surface-treated using a 800 mJ KrF excimer laser with an aim {{to improve the}} ceramic-to-metal bond strength. For these two materials, the effects of laser energy density {{and the number of}} pulses upon the surface morphologies of the laser-treated surfaces to be joined were examined. Conical surface microstructures were generally observed on the laser-treated surfaces of the Si 3 N 4 material, and the number of conical features was found to be significantly influenced by the laser energy density. Moreover, the results of XPS have shown that the surface chemistry of the ceramic was altered after being laser treated. On the other hand, excimer laser treatment had caused the alloy steel surfaces be melted and resulted in some "beach-mark" features. However, the laser energy density has little effect on the overall surface morphology and the roughness of the treated surfaces. Shear tests were performed on adhesive bonded samples of the laser-treated ceramic and alloy steel. Significant improvement in adhesion shear strength was obtained for the laser-treated samples as compared with those tested in the as-received and mechanically abraded conditions. The required laser operation condition for achieving good shear joint strength was discussed. Department of Industrial and Systems Engineerin...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} get a better {{understanding}} of wear mechanisms in <b>cutting</b> tool <b>materials,</b> the internal stress states caused by complex external thermo-mechanical loads during cutting processes should be investigated. This can be done using in situ X-ray diffraction with high energy synchrotron radiation. For this reason, in first model tests, the strain state in <b>ceramic</b> <b>cutting</b> tool <b>materials</b> (Al 2 O 3 –Ti(O,C)) for hard turning applications is determined during friction testing. An experimental set-up is presented which allows the measurement of lattice strain tensor components in the major phases of the mixed ceramic material under a two-dimensional loading condition during friction. Results show that during friction almost no lattice strains in lateral direction can be measured due to strain compensation. In contrast, in normal direction, lattice strains increase due to the addition of strains. Stress tensor components are calculated from lattice strains and show higher internal stress states for Ti(O,C) than for Al 2 O 3 due to a higher Young’s modulus of Ti(O,C). The set-up represents a major step forward towards future in situ characterization of internal stress states in <b>cutting</b> tool <b>materials</b> exposed to complex thermo-mechanical loading conditions during cutting processes...|$|R

In part one, the performance of commercial Kyon 2000 sialon ceramic inserts is studied when machining a hardened alloy steel under a wide range of cutting conditions. The aim is to formulate a pattern of machining behaviour in which tool wear is related to a theoretical interpretation of the temperatures and stresses generated by the chip-tool interaction. The work involves a correlation of wear measurement and metallographic examination of the wear area with the measurable cutting data. Four main tool failure modes are recognised: (a) flank and crater wear (b) grooving wear (c) deformation wear and (d) brittle failure Results indicate catastrophic edge breakdown under certain conditions. Accordingly in part two, the edge geometry is modified to give a double rake tool; a negative/positive combination. The results are reported for a range of workpiece <b>materials</b> under orthogonal <b>cutting</b> conditions. Significant improvements in the cutting performance are achieved. The improvements are explained by a study of process parameters; cutting forces, chip thickness ratio, chip contact length, temperature distribution, stress distribution and chip formation.

40|$|<b>Ceramic</b> <b>cutting</b> {{tools are}} showing a growing market {{perspective}} {{in terms of}} application on machining operations due to their high hardness, wear resistance, and machining without a cutting fluid, therefore are good candidates for cast iron and Nickel superalloys machining. The objective of the present paper was the development of Si 3 N 4 based <b>ceramic</b> <b>cutting</b> insert, characterization of its physical and mechanical properties, and subsequent coating with AlCrN using a PVD method. The characterization of the coating was made using an optical profiler, XRD, AFM and microhardness tester. The {{results showed that the}} tool presented a fracture toughness of 6. 43 MPa. m½ and hardness of 16 GPa. The hardness reached 31 GPa after coating. The machining tests showed a decrease on workpiece roughness when machining with coated insert, in comparison with the uncoated cutting tool. Probably this fact is related to hardness, roughness and topography of AlCrN...|$|R
