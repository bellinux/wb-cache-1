5|$|A {{keystone}} species is {{a species that}} is connected to a disproportionately large number of other species in the food-web. Keystone species have lower levels of biomass in the trophic pyramid relative {{to the importance of}} their role. The many <b>connections</b> <b>that</b> a {{keystone species}} holds means that it maintains the organization and structure of entire communities. The loss of a keystone species results in a range of dramatic cascading effects that alters trophic dynamics, other food web connections, and can cause the extinction of other species.|$|E
5|$|After {{finishing}} his schooling Kagame made two visits to Rwanda, in 1977 and 1978. He was initially hosted {{by family members}} of his former classmates, but upon arrival in Kigali he made contact with {{members of his own}} family. He kept a low profile on these visits, believing that his status as a well-connected Tutsi exile could lead to arrest; on his second visit he entered the country through Zaire rather than Uganda to avoid suspicion. Kagame used his time in Rwanda to explore the country, familiarise himself with the political and social situation, and make <b>connections</b> <b>that</b> would prove useful to him in his later activities.|$|E

5|$|Considering the {{lopsided}} {{score of}} the series, historians such as Paul Kitchen question why Dawson City was even granted a chance at the Cup. Dawson City had won no championships and {{did not belong to}} any recognized senior league. While team official Weldy Young knew Stanley Cup trustee P. D.

The vulture's glyph is often shown attacking humans. This species lacks the religious <b>connections</b> <b>that</b> the king vulture has. While some of the glyphs clearly show the black vulture's open nostril and hooked beak, some are assumed to be this species because they are vulture-like but lack the king vulture's knob and are painted black. This vulture has appeared on two stamps: those of Guyana in 1990 and Nicaragua in 1994.|$|E
5|$|Through <b>connections</b> <b>that</b> Cohen {{had with}} record {{producer}} Samuel Charters, the group signed a recording contract with Vanguard Records in December 1966, {{just as the}} label, which had primarily released folk music, was attempting to branch out into the growing psychedelic rock scene. While the band waited to record their debut album, they were present at the Human Be-In, along with other influential San Francisco musical acts, including Jefferson Airplane, Big Brother and the Holding Company, and Quicksilver Messenger Service. The event was a prelude to the Summer of Love and helped publicize counterculture ideals such as ecology, free-love {{and the use of}} illicit drugs.|$|E

5|$|The freeway travels due north {{along this}} stretch, flanked {{on both sides}} by {{residential}} neighborhoods separated from I-590 only by sound barriers. Not far {{to the north of}} the intersection with NY31 is exit3, a partial diamond interchange for Elmwood Avenue permitting access from I-590 south and to I-590 north. Prior to 1980, NY47 entered the freeway at this point and followed both I-590 and NY590 north to Sea Breeze. Another partial interchange with Highland Avenue follows at exit4—making the two <b>connections</b> <b>that</b> exit3 omits—before I-590 enters the Can of Worms, a complex interchange connecting I-590 to I-490. North of the ramps leading to I-490, I-590 descends northeastward into a cut and passes below both I-490 and NY96 as it becomes NY590, which continues onward toward Sea Breeze.|$|E
5|$|The most manifestly {{cyclical}} work of {{the three}} sonatas is the Sonata in A major. In the sonata's scherzo, a joyous passage in C major is suddenly interrupted by a fierce downward rushing scale in C-sharp minor, which closely recalls a parallel passage at {{the climax of the}} preceding movement; this is followed in the scherzo by a dance theme whose melody is derived from the Andantino's opening melody. This unique moment {{is one of the most}} explicit, audible cyclic references in the sonata trilogy. Another important cyclic element in the A major Sonata is the subtle similarities and <b>connections</b> <b>that</b> exist between each movement's ending and the following movement's opening; the connection between the opening and ending of the sonata as a whole, is even bolder: the sonata ends in a cancrizans of its opening, a framing device which is probably unprecedented in the sonata literature.|$|E
5|$|Regarding {{the primary}} {{function}} of conscious processing, a recurring idea in recent theories is that phenomenal states somehow integrate neural activities and information-processing {{that would otherwise}} be independent. This has been called the integration consensus. Another example has been proposed by Gerald Edelman called dynamic core hypothesis which puts emphasis on reentrant <b>connections</b> <b>that</b> reciprocally link areas of the brain in a massively parallel manner. Edelman also stresses the importance of the evolutionary emergence of higher-order consciousness in humans from the historically older trait of primary consciousness which humans share with non-human animals (see Neural correlates section above). These theories of integrative function present solutions to two classic problems associated with consciousness: differentiation and unity. They show how our conscious experience can discriminate between a virtually unlimited number of different possible scenes and details (differentiation) because it integrates those details from our sensory systems, while the integrative nature of consciousness in this view easily explains how our experience can seem unified as one whole despite all of these individual parts. However, it remains unspecified which kinds of information are integrated in a conscious manner and which kinds can be integrated without consciousness. Nor is it explained what specific causal role conscious integration plays, nor why the same functionality cannot be achieved without consciousness. Obviously not all kinds of information are capable of being disseminated consciously (e.g., neural activity related to vegetative functions, reflexes, unconscious motor programs, low-level perceptual analyses, etc.) and many kinds of information can be disseminated and combined with other kinds without consciousness, as in intersensory interactions such as the ventriloquism effect. Hence it remains unclear why any of it is conscious. For a review of the differences between conscious and unconscious integrations, see the article of E. Morsella.|$|E

Also, these two connections must be a relayed pair. In other words, if the two connections are relayed, then the machine must be used as a stepping-stone.|$|R
5000|$|In {{differential}} geometry, {{the local}} twistor bundle {{is a specific}} vector bundle with <b>connection</b> <b>that</b> can be associated to any conformal manifold, at least locally.
