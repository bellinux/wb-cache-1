40|$|The rubber boom {{across much}} of Southeast Asia has led to {{environmental}} destruction, and the resultant crash {{in the price of}} rubber has destabilised livelihoods. We investigated the necessary factors required to enable a transition towards a more sustainable model for rubber cultivation in Southwest China (i. e. the ‘greening’ of rubber cultivation), using a framework for the integrative study of multiple aspects in complex land use issues. We present findings from stakeholder interviews and a stakeholder workshop, and discuss their relevance within and beyond Southwest China. The current focus of researchers and development practitioners tends to be on finding technical solutions to address unsustainable rubber cultivation practices. However, stakeholder consultations revealed that the key barriers were more social: low levels of trust and knowledge exchange between stakeholder groups and fragmented visions {{about the future of the}} landscape. It is very important to continue the economic prosperity initially brought by rubber, but, without improved communication between government and researchers and smallholder farmers, this will be very difficult to achieve. A wider landscape perspective is needed to address issues in rubber cultivation to avoid repeating the same problems of cash <b>crop</b> <b>boom</b> and bust experienced with other crops, most notably bananas. We conclude that more effort should be put into developing mechanisms that integrate technical knowledge, enhance social relationships, and present a forum for reconciling – or at least acknowledging – the differing needs, knowledge, and objectives of different groups, and transcending the power dynamics between smallholder farmers and government and researchers...|$|E

40|$|Background: The global {{palm oil}} market {{experienced}} a remarkable boom since the year 2000. Since palm oil {{can be used}} for biodiesel production, the global expansion of oil palm cultivation has been associated with the global biofuel boom. Biofuel policies—especially those adopted in the European Union (EU) —have been blamed for the socio-environmental impacts of oil palm expansion. We explore how the global biofuel boom interacts with national geographies and social-economic and political processes to produce country-specific trajectories of biofuel crops expansion. We analyse the expansion of oil palm cultivation in Colombia between 2000 and 2010 from a political ecology perspective. Methods: The analysis is based on a framework that positions expansion of commodity frontiers within the ‘space-of-flows’ and the ‘space-of-place’. Through this approach, we identify the markets and geographies that define the country-specific trajectories of expansion of oil palm in Colombia, and their connections with general patterns of land control. The empirical analysis is based on primary data collected during fieldwork, and on an extensive review of secondary data about the palm oil sector and the socio-environmental effects of oil palm expansion in the country. Results: The contemporary oil palm expansion in Colombia was not specifically influenced by the international biofuel market. Expansion was characterized by an increasing production of palm oil for biodiesel, to supply a policy-driven national biofuel market controlled by national palm oil producers. The evidence shows that this oil palm expansion proceeded through a variety of land control practices that constitute forms of ‘accumulation by dispossession’ and ‘assimilation’. These are embedded in contextual factors that include the agrarian history of Colombia, the armed conflict, and government policies. Conclusions: Our study shows that the ways in which expansion of biofuel crops unfold in each producing country depend not only on the global biofuel market. They are also shaped by the country-specific geographies and political economies. Therefore, research and policies on the global expansion of energy crops should account for the complex and interrelated factors that mediate the specific ways in which the global demand for biofuels creates biofuel <b>crop</b> <b>booms</b> at country level...|$|R

50|$|Although cotton was a <b>boom</b> <b>crop</b> in {{the early}} 1970s, {{production}} had waned since 1975. Grown mostly in the Santa Cruz Department, cotton covered 54,000 hectares in 1975 but only 9,000 hectares in 1988. Production declined from 22,000 tons to 3,700 tons over the same period. Price was {{the primary reason for}} the decline, but insect problems, disease, and the lack of credit also contributed. Because Santa Cruz cotton farmers represented an important constituency, they had traditionally received highly favorable terms of credit. When cotton growing was no longer profitable, however, many cotton farmers defaulted on their loans, leaving the government's Agricultural Bank of Bolivia (Banco Agrícola de Bolivia—BAB) in a poor financial position in the late 1980s. Because of the precipitous decline in the industry, the country's ten cotton mills were operating at under one-half of their capacity by the late 1980s.|$|R

Yet, the phenomenal growth of shrimp farming has often given rise to considerable environmental and social damage. This article examines the impacts of commercial, export-oriented shrimp aquaculture on local livelihood vulnerability by comparing the exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity of shrimp farm employees with non-farm employees in rural Mozambique. Exposure to stressors was similar between the two groups. Shrimp farm employees had higher assets and higher adaptive capacity than non-farm employees. However, because their income is heavily dependent on a single commodity, shrimp farm employees were highly susceptible to the <b>boom</b> <b>crop</b> nature of intensive shrimp farming. The implications for aquaculture policy and vulnerability research are discussed.

40|$|In 2007 and 2008 {{world food}} markets {{observed}} a significant price <b>boom.</b> <b>Crop</b> failures simultaneously occurring {{in some of}} the world’s major production regions have been quoted as one factor among others for the price boom. Against this background, we analyse the stochasticity of crop yields in major production areas. The analysis is exemplified for wheat, {{which is one of the}} most important crops worldwide. Particular attention is given to the stochastic dependence of yields in different regions. Thereby we address the question of whether local fluctuations of yields can be smoothed by international agricultural trade, i. e. by global diversification. The analysis is based on the copula approach, which requires less restrictive assumptions compared with linear correlations. The use of copulas allows for a more reliable estimation of extreme yield shortfalls, which are of particular interest in this application. Our calculations reveal that a production shortfall, such as in 2007, is not a once in a lifetime event. Instead, from a statistical point of view, similar production conditions will occur every 15 years. crop yield risk, fully nested hierarchical Archimedean copulas (FNAC), price boom...|$|R

40|$|We {{performed}} a multi-date composite change detection technique using a dense-time stack of Landsat data to map land-use and land-cover change (LCLUC) in Mainland Southeast Asia (MSEA) {{with a focus}} on the expansion of <b>boom</b> <b>crops,</b> primarily tree crops. The supervised classification was performed using Support Vector Machines (SVM), which are supervised non-parametric statistical learning techniques.

We distinguished a total of 41 LCLUCs (13 to 31 classes per footprint) in very dynamic and heterogeneous landscapes. The approach proved useful for distinguishing subtle changes over time and to map a variety of land covers, tree crops, and transformations as long as sufficient training points could be collected for each class. While to date, this approach has only been applied to mapping urban extent and expansion, this study shows that it is also useful for mapping change in rural settings, especially when images from phenologically relevant acquisition dates are included...|$|R
40|$|Data is {{presented}} comparing infiltration of irrigation and rain water to potato crops planted in ridges and beds in East Anglia, UK. An automatic soil water station (ASWS) {{was used to}} monitor soil water content and potential in the two cultivation systems. The ASWS data indicated {{that most of the}} water bypassed the potatoes planted in ridges as irrigation water applied to the <b>crop</b> from a <b>boom</b> irrigator was shed off the ridges infiltrating in the furrows. This was due to the water repellent nature of the sandy soil and meant that the irrigation water bypassed the potatoes. A soil water deficit built up in the core of the ridge as the crop grew and was not replenished by irrigations. A second early potato crop planted in beds was more successful at capturing water as the flat bed increased water infiltration around the crop. This has major implications for cultivation practice, scab control and crop water management. Instruments measuring soil water potential, content, temperature and rainfall were connected to a data logger powered by a solar panel and proved a successful way of monitoring infiltration. Hourly data was collected so that a high temporal resolution data set could be constructed in order to increase conceptual understanding of hydrological processes at a scale appropriate to the crop. ...|$|R
40|$|Plastic {{mulching}} is {{an important}} technology in agricultural production both in China {{and the rest of}} the world. In spite of its benefit of increasing <b>crop</b> yields, the <b>booming</b> expansion of the plastic mulching area has been changing the landscape patterns and affecting the environment. Accurate and effective mapping of Plastic-Mulched Farmland (PMF) can provide useful information for leveraging its advantages and disadvantages. However, mapping the PMF with remote sensing is still challenging owing to its varying spectral characteristics with the crop growth and geographic spatial division. In this paper, we investigated the potential of Radarsat- 2 data for mapping PMF. We obtained the backscattering intensity of different polarizations and multiple polarimetric decomposition descriptors. These remotely-sensed information was used as input features for Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers. The results indicated that the features from Radarsat- 2 data have great potential for mapping PMF. The overall accuracies of PMF mapping with Radarsat- 2 data were close to 75 %. Although the classification accuracy with the back-scattering intensity information alone was relatively lower owing to the inherent speckle noise in SAR data, it has been improved significantly by introducing the polarimetric decomposition descriptors. The accuracy was nearly 75 %. In addition, the features derived from the Entropy/Anisotropy/Alpha (H/A/Alpha) polarimetric decomposition, such as Alpha, entropy, and so on, made a greater contribution to PMF mapping than the Freeman decomposition, Krogager decomposition and the Yamaguchi 4 decomposition. The performances of different classifiers were also compared. In this study, the RF classifier performed better than the SVM classifier. However, it is expected that the classification accuracy of PMF with SAR remote sensing data can be improved by combining SAR remote sensing data with optical remote sensing data...|$|R
40|$|Soybean (Glycine max) is a <b>booming</b> <b>crop</b> in Brazil. In 2004, {{the export}} value was {{equivalent}} to 10 billion US $, covering over 10 % of total Brazilian exports. Three-quarters of total production leaves the country, mainly to China and the European Union (EU). Soybean cultivation in Brazil {{is expected to}} expand further in the coming decades, mainly responding to growing demand in Asia. This will, amongst others, entail transport of vast amounts of nutrients, triggering the need to better study the entire soybean chain. The objective {{of this study was}} to estimate and calculate the soybean chain, including five phases: conversion, cultivation, transport and processing, consumption and waste disposal, starting in Brazil, and ending in Brazil, China and EU, using nitrogen (N) as a marker, and looking at three time periods (1993 ¿ 1995; 1998 ¿ 2000; 2003 ¿ 2005). The study revealed that conversion of forest and savanna to pasture and agricultural land entails N losses of 2000 ¿ 6000 million kg year¿ 1. Removal of N in soybean harvests went up from 1400 million to almost 3000 million kg year¿ 1 between 1993 ¿ 1995 and 2003 ¿ 2005. These high values were offset by biological N fixation by soybean and increased adoption of conservation agriculture. N balances in soybean-based agricultural systems became positive after about one decade in the period 2003 ¿ 2005, thus reducing the soybean-associated global N cascade. Upon crushing, three-quarters of soybeans end up as high-protein soy meal, which is mainly fed to pigs and chickens. Nitrogen in meat, milk and eggs from soy meal-fed animals was estimated at around 20 % of N in freshly crushed soy meal. More than half of the lost N can potentially be recycled, although mostly far away from the site of soybean production...|$|R

40|$|As {{a result}} of the {{decreasing}} availability of authorized plant protection products, adequate pest control becomes more difficult in many ornamental crops and almost no information is available about the optimization of spray application techniques in ornamental <b>crops.</b> Yet, spray <b>boom</b> systems-instead of the still predominantly used spray guns-might improve crop protection management in greenhouses considerably. Application rate, nozzle type, and configuration will influence the spray deposition and, as such, its efficiency. In this study, spray deposition in ivy pot plants [Hedera algeriensis cv. Montgomery, Hibb. ], grown on hanging shelves in greenhouses, was compared with a traditional spray gun with a disc-core nozzle and a manually pulled trolley equipped with two vertical spray booms. The sprayings with the spray gun were performed at an application rate of 8500 L. ha(- 1). For the vertical spray boom system, two different reduced application rates (2500 and 5000 L. ha(- 1)) with five different combinations of nozzle type, size, and pressure for each application rate were investigated. This research underlined that, besides the application rate, also the spray application equipment used has an important effect on the spray depositions. Nozzle type, size, and pressure on the vertical spray boom system only had a minor effect on the spray deposition. Although the spray gun performed well on the easily accessible crop zone with the runners, its performance in the more dense main crop zone was inferior. With 240 % more sprayed liquid (8500 L. ha(- 1)) and chemicals, the realized depositions in this crop zone were not significantly different from the ones obtained with the vertical spray boom system applying only 2500 L. ha(- 1). Spraying at 5000 L. ha(- 1), the vertical spray boom system achieved a 82. 9 % higher overall spray deposition in the main crop canopy zone compared with the spray gun at an application rate of 8500 L. ha(- 1).

40|$|Conventional {{high volume}} {{pesticide}} spraying in citrus <b>crops</b> with oscillating <b>boom</b> sprayers results in {{low levels of}} pesticide retention on trees {{and high levels of}} off- target losses. This study was conducted to establish whether lower volume pesticide spraying with an air-assisted low-profile sprayer and air-assisted sprayers fitted with tower air conveyors (air-towers) could replace conventional high volume pesticide spraying. The spraying efficacy of an oscillating boom sprayer applying 10 000 l ha (- 1) was compared with three different air-assisted sprayers applying volumes of between 500 and 6000 l ha (- 1). Spray efficacy was determined by measuring spray deposits on citrus leaves and fruit and off-target losses (canopy run-off) by using a fluorescent dye tracer technique. Biological efficacy was determined by assessing the control of two insect pests of citrus being California red scale (Aonidiella aurantii Maskell) and Citrus mealybug (Planococcus citri Risso) using Supracide 400 (methidathion). The Barlow tower sprayer operating at 6000 l ha (- 1) produced equal spray deposits on leaves and higher spray deposits on fruit compared to the oscillating boom operating at 10 000 l ha (- 1). The Hardi low-profile air-blast sprayer produced significantly lower spray deposits on both leaves and fruit as the height zone increased in the trees. The Silvan air-shear tower sprayer produced better distribution of spray than the low-profile air-blast sprayer through the height zones in the tree on both leaves and fruit. The percentage of leaf retention of spray volume increased with decreasing application volume from 14 % for the oscillating boom at 10 000 1 ha (- 1) to 59 % for the Silvan tower at 500 l ha (- 1). Canopy spray run-off increased with increasing volume from 2 % for the Silvan tower at 500 and 1000 l ha (- 1) and the Barlow tower at 1500 1 ha (- 1) to 28 % for the oscillating boom at 10 000 1 ha (- 1). The biological efficacy of the oscillating boom sprayer on red scale was matched by the Barlow tower at 6000 l ha (- 1) and the Silvan tower at 500 l ha (- 1). The Barlow tower at 6000 l ha (- 1) produced a greater reduction in fruit infected with mealybug in the calyx than the oscillating boom sprayer at 10000 l ha (- 1) and all other sprayer treatments. The reduction in dose rate of insecticide produced by using lower spray volumes with registered rates based on volume of spray volume resulted in pests not being controlled in some of the lower volume treatments. This clearly illustrates that changes to certain pesticide registrations will be necessary in the adoption of lower spray volumes in crops such as citrus. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|This manual {{summarizes}} the roadside tree and brush control methods used {{by all of}} Iowa's 99 counties. It is based on interviews conducted in Spring 2002 with county engineers, roadside managers and others. The target audience of this manual is the novice county engineer or roadside manager. Iowa law is nearly silent on roadside tree and brush control, so individual counties have been left {{to decide on the}} level of control they want to achieve and maintain. Different solutions have been developed but the goal of every county remains the same: to provide safe roads for the traveling public. Counties in eastern and southern Iowa appear to face the greatest brush control challenge. Most control efforts can be divided into two categories: mechanical and chemical. Mechanical control includes cutting tools and supporting equipment. A chain saw is the most widely used cutting tool. Tractor mounted boom mowers and brush cutters are used to prune miles of brush but have significant safety and aesthetic limitations and boom mowers are easily broken by inexperienced operators. The advent of tree shears and hydraulic thumbs offer unprecedented versatility. Bulldozers are often considered a method of last resort since they reduce large areas to bare ground. Any chipper that violently grabs brush should not be used. Chemical control is the application of herbicide to different parts of a plant: foliar spray is applied to leaves; basal bark spray is applied to the tree trunk; a cut stump treatment is applied to the cambium ring of a cut surface. There is reluctance by many to apply herbicide into the air due to drift concerns. One-third of Iowa counties do not use foliar spray. By contrast, several accepted control methods are directed toward the ground. Freshly cut stumps should be treated to prevent resprouting. Basal bark spray is highly effective in sensitive areas such as near houses. Interest in chemical control is slowly increasing as herbicides and application methods are refined. Fall burning, a third, distinctly separate technique is underused as a brush control method and can be effective if timed correctly. In all, control methods tend to reflect agricultural patterns in a county. The use of chain saws and foliar sprays tends to increase in counties where row <b>crops</b> predominate, and <b>boom</b> mowing tends to increase in counties where grassland predominates. For counties with light to moderate roadside brush, rotational maintenance is the key to effective control. The most comprehensive approach to control is to implement an integrated roadside vegetation management (IRVM) program. An IRVM program is usually directed by a Roadside Manager whose duties may be shared with another position. Funding for control programs comes from the Rural Services Basic portion of a county's budget. The average annual county brush control budget is about 76, 000. That figure is thought not to include shared expenses such as fuel and buildings. Start up costs for an IRVM program are less if an existing control program is converted. In addition, IRVM budgets from three different northeastern Iowa counties are offered for comparison in this manual. The manual also includes a chapter on temporary traffic control in rural work zones, a summary of the Iowa Code as it relates to brush control, and rules on avoiding seasonal disturbance of the endangered Indiana bat. Appendices summarize survey and forest cover data, an equipment inventory, sample forms for record keeping, a sample brush control policy, a few legal opinions, a literature search, and a glossary...|$|R
