I am told by astronomers and physicists that all he tells is in absolute accordance with what was already known of the moon's condition. Had earthly astronomers had the courage and imagination to push home a bold induction, says Mr. Wendigee, they might have foretold almost everything that Cavor has to say of the general structure of the moon. They know now pretty certainly that moon and earth are not so much satellite and primary as smaller and greater sisters, made out of one mass, and consequently made of the same material. And since the density of the moon is only three-fifths that of the earth, there can be nothing for it but that she is hollowed out by a great system of caverns. There was no necessity, said Sir Jabez Flap, F.R.S., that most entertaining exponent of the facetious side of the stars, that we should ever have gone to the moon to find out such easy inferences, and points the pun with an allusion to Gruyere, but he certainly might have announced his knowledge of the hollowness of the moon before. And if the moon is hollow, then the apparent absence of air and water is, of course, quite easily explained. The sea lies within {{at the bottom of the}} caverns, and the air travels through the great sponge of galleries, in accordance with simple physical laws. The caverns of the moon, on the whole, are very windy places. As the sunlight comes round the moon the air in the outer galleries on that side is heated, its pressure increases, some flows out on the exterior and mingles with the evaporating air of the craters (where the plants remove its carbonic acid), while the greater portion flows round through the galleries to replace the shrinking air of the <b>cooling</b> <b>side</b> that the sunlight has left. There is, therefore, a constant eastward breeze in the air of the outer galleries, and an upflow during the lunar day up the shafts, complicated, of course, very greatly by the varying shape of the galleries, and the ingenious contrivances of the Selenite mind....|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{condensation}} over horizontal tubes {{where the}} wall temperature is not measured directly, the Wilson plot {{is used to}} determine the <b>cooling</b> <b>side</b> heat transfer coefficient. Conventionally, the variation in Nusselt number, Nu, with condensate side temperature drop, ΔTs, which accompanies change of <b>cooling</b> <b>side</b> flowrate, is assumed to be Nu ∝ 1 /ΔTs n with n = 0. 25. This is the free convention condensation value. In this paper a technique is devised, not only to check the accuracy of this assumption in the usual vapor side cross flow situation, but also to determine the effect on this accuracy of allowing the index n to vary. In a case study the best agreement between ΔTs assumed and the value obtained using the <b>cooling</b> <b>side</b> heat transfer coefficient which resulted from the Wilson plot, occurred at n = 0. 21.

40|$|In {{the present}} work, an open-type {{thermoelectric}} heating system with multiple channels was developed. A mathematical model of heat transfer, based on one-dimensional treatment of thermal and electric power, is conducted. The heating coefficient and production are both correlated {{in terms of}} temperature difference, thermal conductivity, electric resistance and electric current. The looped air circulation was designed to simultaneously recycle heat and enhance heater system performance. Experimental investigations were conducted to identify thermal performance of the thermoelectric heater. Effects of airflow rates through the heating side and <b>cooling</b> <b>side,</b> temperatures of heating side and <b>cooling</b> <b>side</b> on the performance were investigated. The heating coefficient was calculated upon that surface temperatures of hot and cold sides were recorded. The {{results show that the}} average heating coefficient of the thermoelectric heating system could reach to 1. 3, which is greater than that of a typical electric heater with heating coefficient of less than one. The optimal isolation thickness for this thermoelectric heater, i. e., 14. mm, is confirmed by the experimental rig system. Generally, heating coefficient was found to increase first and decrease afterwards when the current was continuously increasing. Analytical and experimental results demonstrate that the optimum performance of the thermoelectric heat recovery heater strongly depends on the intensities of these operating parameters.

40|$|Membrane {{distillation}} {{was considered}} {{as an alternative}} to traditional desalination processes because this technique produces ultra-pure water without requiring high temperatures nor high pressures. The driving force of membrane distillation is a temperature difference across a microporous membrane leading to a vapour pressure gradient.

40|$|This article {{deals with}} the {{experimental}} determination of heat transfer coefficients. The calculation of heat transfer coefficients constitutes a crucial issue in design and sizing of heat exchangers. The Wilson plot method and its modifications based on measured experimental data utilization provide an appropriate tool {{for the analysis of}} convection heat transfer processes and the determination of convection coefficients in complex cases. A modification of the Wilson plot method for shell-and-tube condensers is proposed. The original Wilson plot method considers a constant value of thermal resistance on the condensation side. The heat transfer coefficient on the <b>cooling</b> <b>side</b> is determined based on the change in thermal resistance for different conditions (fluid velocity and temperature). The modification is based on the validation of the Nusselt theory for calculating the heat transfer coefficient on the condensation side. A change of thermal resistance on the condensation side is expected and the value is part of the calculation. It is possible to improve the determination accuracy of the criterion equation for calculation of the heat transfer coefficient using the proposed modification. The criterion equation proposed by this modification for the tested shell-and-tube condenser achieves good agreement with the experimental results and also with commonly used theoretical methods...|$|E
40|$|Sponsoring {{organization}} Title and subtitle Temperature Control of a Scientific Instrument (Temperaturreglering av ett vetenskapligt instrument) The aim of {{the present}} Master’s Thesis was to improve the temperature control of a calorimetric instrument called STIC (Several Temperatures Isothermal Calorimeter). Calorimetry is the science of measuring heat, heat production rate or heat capacity; the present instrument is an isothermal calorimeter used for the measurement of thermal power from different types of processes. In the instrument, four calorimeters are placed in a temperature gradient between a warm and a cold side, {{both of which are}} temperature controlled. In order to have an open and transparent control system, new PID controllers were implemented using Simulink and dSPACE. Experiments were carried out to see the effect of external temperature changes on the STIC measurement signals. A simulation model of the STIC was also developed in MATLAB. To decrease the effect of external temperature changes, a new feed forward control was added to the <b>cooling</b> <b>side.</b> To test and tune this controller, both simulations and experiments were done. The simulation result gave an improvement of about 55 % compared to the situation without feed forward-, while the experiments gave a lower improvement of about 25 %.

40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} {{investigations}} {{on a novel}} open sorption process for air dehumidification and cooling. Studies focus on {{the main component of}} the process - the Evaporatively COoled Sorptive coated air-to-air heat exchanger (ECOS). In this heat exchanger, the primary channels are coated with a solid desiccant. While the humid air stream to be conditioned flows through these sorption channels water vapour is adsorbed from the air onto the surface of the desiccant. This leads to the desired air dehumidification. The heat of adsorption is released at the site of adsorption in the desiccant. To counteract the resulting temperature increase of the desiccant, water is sprayed into the adjacent secondary cooling channels where it evaporates into the cooling air stream. Heat is now transferred from the desiccant to the cooling channels. Due to the resulting lower temperature the desiccant is able to realize a higher water uptake than in the adiabatic adsorption process which is applied in market available desiccant rotors. The objective of the novel process is to increase the dehumidification performance while attaining a simultaneous temperature reduction of the process air. As the desiccant is regenerated by a hot air stream, the process is classified as a thermally-driven air-conditioning process. The coupled heat and mass transfer phenomena of adsorption and evaporation are investigated by the experimental characterization of two heat exchangers coated with silica gel and on the basis of dynamic modelling. In the measurements, the cyclic operation of the sorptive coated heat exchanger switching between the adsorption, desorption and precooling phases is implemented. For the exemplary case of long cycles, in which the sorption material approximately attains equilibrium, the advantage of the evaporatively cooled adsorption process is demonstrated. For the second prototype an increase in the adsorbed water mass by 47 % is realized in comparison to the air cooled cycles without evaporation. At the same time the cooling capacity increases by a factor of 4. 2 and the thermal COP by a factor of 4. 1. The model of the heat exchanger includes a sorption model in which sorption kinetics are represented by a pseudo-gas side controlled approach, a wall model and a model of film evaporation on the <b>cooling</b> <b>side.</b> The cross-flow configuration of the prototypes is embodied by appropriately linking the air flows in the discretized heat exchanger model. Measurements under different boundary conditions are used for model validation. The influence of the cycle time, the desorption temperature, the inlet humidity ratio and the mass flow rates on the measured dehumidification and cooling performance is discussed. For the given variation of boundary conditions the simulation is able to qualitatively and quantitatively correctly reproduce the experimentally determined dependencies. The validated model is applied to identify opportunities for process improvement. Results of simulation analysis are: (1) A flow reversal from adsorption to desorption does not lead to a process improvement. (2) The ideal film evaporation shows a distinct advantage over an ideal evaporation of droplets. (3) A reduction in the thermal mass of the influx air ducts leads to a further increase in the key performance indicators and to a shift to shorter cycle times to be favourably implemented...|$|E
