5|$|Deception {{and problem}} solving are central themes in this novel as both the thief and the central adult players {{use a variety of}} ways to hide the truth while the {{children}} employ a series of mathematical and problem-solving <b>concepts</b> <b>to</b> piece together the clues to the puzzle. In addition, Calder and Petra develop a special friendship and certain respect for the value of art.|$|E
5|$|The philosopher Kenneth Craik {{had noted}} {{the ability of}} thought to predict events. He {{stressed}} the survival value of natural selection for this ability. This internal working model allows a person to try out alternatives mentally, using knowledge of the past while responding to the present and future. Bowlby applied Craik's ideas to attachment, when other psychologists were applying these <b>concepts</b> <b>to</b> adult perception and cognition.|$|E
5|$|Demo {{recording}} {{sessions for}} Night Fishing began {{several days before}} {{the release of the}} band's debut album Go to the Future in May 2007. The band members formally proposed the album <b>concepts</b> <b>to</b> Victor Entertainment staff in June 2007. The album's official studio recording sessions began in September 2007 and concluded in October, and were entirely undertaken at Discovery Studio in the Maruyama Nishi-machi area of Chūō-ku, Sapporo. After the album sessions had finished, however, the band immediately kept on recording for their future projects. The album's track order was not considered until the very final mastering stages of the album. Yamaguchi did much of the album's final mixing himself personally.|$|E

5|$|Marx's {{ideas have}} had a {{profound}} impact on world politics and intellectual thought. Followers of Marx have frequently debated amongst themselves over how to interpret Marx's writings and apply his <b>concepts</b> <b>to</b> the modern world. The legacy of Marx's thought has become contested between numerous tendencies, each of which sees itself as Marx's most accurate interpreter. In the political realm, these tendencies include Leninism, Marxism–Leninism, Trotskyism, Maoism, Luxemburgism and libertarian Marxism. Various currents have also developed in academic Marxism, often under influence of other views, resulting in structuralist Marxism, historical Marxism, phenomenological Marxism, analytical Marxism and Hegelian Marxism.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} {{staff from}} previous Metroid games – including Yoshio Sakamoto, Makoto Kano and Gunpei Yokoi – returned to develop Super Metroid {{over the course}} of two years, with half a year earlier to gain approval for the initial idea. The developers wanted to make a true action game, and to set the stage for Samus's reappearance. The gameplay focuses on exploration, with the player searching for power-ups that are used to reach previously inaccessible areas. It features new <b>concepts</b> <b>to</b> the series, such as the inventory screen, an automap, and the ability to fire in all directions.|$|E
5|$|The discoveries Cassini {{has made}} at Enceladus have {{prompted}} studies into follow-up mission concepts, including a flyby plume sample-return mission by NASA, a probe flyby (Journey to Enceladus and Titan or JET) to analyze plume contents in-situ, a lander by the German Aerospace Center {{to study the}} habitability potential of its subsurface ocean (Enceladus Explorer), and two astrobiology-oriented mission concepts (the Enceladus Life Finder and Life Investigation For Enceladus). The European Space Agency (ESA) is also assessing <b>concepts</b> <b>to</b> send a probe to Enceladus in a mission to be combined with studies of Titan: TandEM (Titan and Enceladus Mission).|$|E

5|$|Three Final Fantasy {{installments}} {{were released}} on the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). Final Fantasy {{was released in}} Japan in 1987 and in North America in 1990. It introduced many <b>concepts</b> <b>to</b> the console RPG genre, and has since been remade on several platforms. Final FantasyII, released in 1988 in Japan, has been bundled with Final Fantasy in several re-releases. The last of the NES installments, Final FantasyIII, was released in Japan in 1990; however, it was not released elsewhere until a Nintendo DS remake in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Tome of the Unknown is a {{short film}} {{directed}} by Patrick McHale, who also wrote and storyboarded it. Not long after he graduated college, McHale pitched {{the idea for the}} film, among other <b>concepts,</b> <b>to</b> Cartoon Network. At the time, the network was considering the creation of a department for feature films, though this never came to fruition. McHale was asked if it was possible to adapt the idea for Tome of the Unknown to feature length. This proved unsuccessful as he felt it needed to be episodic, laying out plans for a full television series consisting of three seasons.|$|E
5|$|Half-Life 2 is {{a science}} fiction first-person shooter game and the sequel to Half-Life. While {{remaining}} similar in style to the original, Half-Life 2 introduces new <b>concepts</b> <b>to</b> the series such as physics-based puzzles and vehicle sections. The game {{takes place in the}} fictional City 17 and surrounding areas as the player takes on the role of scientist Gordon Freeman. Freeman is thrust into a dystopian environment in which the aftermath of the events of Half-Life have come to bear fully upon human society, and he is forced to fight against increasingly unfavorable odds in order to survive. In his struggle, he is joined by various acquaintances, including former Black Mesa colleagues, oppressed citizens of City 17, and the Vortigaunts, all of whom later prove to be valuable allies. Half-Life 2 received critical acclaim, including 35 Game of the Year awards, when it was originally released for Windows in 2004. As of December 3, 2008, over 6.5 million copies of Half-Life 2 have been sold at retail. Although Steam sales figures are unknown, their rate surpassed retail's in mid-2008 and they are significantly more profitable per-unit.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after its}} debut, {{most of the}} {{development}} staff were laid off; the remaining staff tried to patch Bloodlines and develop game <b>concepts</b> <b>to</b> secure funding to keep Troika in business. Troika, unable to obtain further funding from Activision or other publishers, released its employees in two waves: the first in November 2004, followed by the remaining staff in December, except for its three founders Anderson, Boyarsky, and Tim Cain. Some employees worked without pay to fix the game. When the company closed in February 2005, it had secured no other game development deals. That month, Boyarsky confirmed that Troika had not {{been working on a}} patch for the game since most of its staff were gone since December 2004. In a November 2004 interview Boyarsky said that although the team would like to pursue a Bloodlines sequel, the decision was Activision's. In a 2006 interview, Anderson said that although Troika Games' library had been critically well received, consistent technical issues had marred the perception of the company's games, contributing to Troika's difficulty in obtaining new projects.|$|E
5|$|Stratton saw humans not as {{machines}} {{to be analyzed}} mechanistically, but also as seating will, emotion and drives, all of which had to analyzed as scientifically as the traditional psychological concepts of sensation, perception and memory. He also believed in a supreme actuality behind the world registered by our senses. This was the theme of his last published book, Man-Creator or Destroyer, completed in 1952 when he was eighty-seven years old. His book Developing Mental Power was a foray into educational psychology, addressing the question of general versus specific training in terms teachers could understand and use. Stratton aimed at this goal via a simple and generally applicable look at the basic workings of mental life. John F. Dashiell, writing in the Journal of Abnormal Psychology, found this a failure. Dashiell saw the path from the psychological concepts—emotion, intelligence, and will—to teaching methodology, not clearly described in the book. Stratton also applied psychological <b>concepts</b> <b>to</b> {{figure out how to}} avert war. He was optimistic it was possible to harness the creative and destructive facets of individuals to get nations to coexist peacefully. He saw nations as consisting of ethnicities and races which had to coexist in harmony. In line with the prevailing view in his field, he did not see the races as inherently equally intelligent.|$|E
5|$|To {{deal with}} this {{shortage}} of educational opportunities, Scott Weiner et al. suggest that countries with developed emergency medical systems should focus on training the trainers. This, he believes, is a sustainable approach to promote the development of emergency medicine worldwide. It works by sending developed country health care workers to equip {{a small group of}} trainees with the necessary skills to then go on and teach the <b>concepts</b> <b>to</b> others. As such, it may be able to leverage the insights of developed emergency medical systems while remaining sustainable, as the newly trained trainers continue to spread the knowledge. The Tuscan Emergency Medicine Initiative is an example, with physicians from other specialties currently working in emergency departments being taught how to teach a new group of emergency medical specialists.|$|E

5|$|In {{the field}} of {{statistics}} and applied probability, John Graunt published Natural and Political Observations Made upon the Bills of Mortality also in 1662, initiating the discipline of demography. This work, among other things, gave a statistical estimate {{of the population of}} London, produced the first life table, gave probabilities of survival of different age groups, examined the different causes of death, noting that the annual rate of suicide and accident is constant, and commented on the level and stability of sex ratio. The usefulness and interpretation of Graunt's tables were discussed in a series of correspondences by brothers Ludwig and Christiaan Huygens in 1667, where they realized the difference between mean and median estimates and Christian even interpolated Graunt's life table by a smooth curve, creating the first continuous probability distribution; but their correspondences were not published. Later, Johan de Witt, the then prime minister of the Dutch Republic, published similar material in his 1671 work Waerdye van Lyf-Renten (A Treatise on Life Annuities), which used statistical <b>concepts</b> <b>to</b> determine life expectancy for practical political purposes; a demonstration of the fact that this sapling branch of mathematics had significant pragmatic applications. De Witt's work was not widely distributed beyond the Dutch Republic, perhaps due to his fall from power and execution by mob in 1672. Apart from the practical contributions of these two work, they also exposed a fundamental idea that probability can be assigned to events that do not have inherent physical symmetry, such as the chances of dying at certain age, unlike say the rolling of a dice or flipping of a coin, simply by counting the frequency of occurrence. Thus probability could be more than mere combinatorics.|$|E
