40|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20 th century, commentators referred to patent <b>working</b> <b>requirements</b> as the most contentious contemporary concept in patent law, and <b>working</b> <b>requirements</b> were at the center of discussions about revisions to the Paris Convention. By the end of the 20 th century it seemed that <b>working</b> <b>requirements</b> attracted less attention; the TRIPS Agreement did not expressly mention <b>working</b> <b>requirements</b> at all. However, some TRIPS provisions do arguably relate to such requirements; in fact, some commentators believe that the TRIPS Agreement prevents countries from maintaining such requirements, at least in some forms. Although the lack of interest in <b>working</b> <b>requirements</b> might suggest that the requirements are no longer important, national patent systems continue to struggle with the question reflected in the requirements: whether the rights of a patent owner should be limited (and if so, under what conditions) when the patent owner does not practice his invention at all, or does not practice it sufficiently. This article discusses the origins and development of patent <b>working</b> <b>requirements</b> and examines the rationales for and purposes of the requirements. The article points out the links and interactions between <b>working</b> <b>requirements</b> and the other components of patent systems and shows that all of the components, including <b>working</b> <b>requirements,</b> serve to calibrate the systems to the particular needs of individual countries, including the needs of their complex legal systems. To the extent that international patent law harmonization continues to allow some leeway for countries to calibrate their national patent systems according to their differing national needs, {{and to the extent that}} international law has not foreclosed countries’ rights to introduce and maintain <b>working</b> <b>requirements,</b> countries should use <b>working</b> <b>requirements</b> to best serve the purposes of their own patent systems...|$|R

The paper argues that if the existence of intellectual property rights is justified based on utilitarianism or bargain theory, then it necessarily follows that TRIPS should provide developing countries with flexibility to legislate local <b>working</b> <b>requirements</b> that demand more than just importing...|$|R

[Purpose] {{in order}} to solve design {{problems}} of the hole-punching system for the pot-seedling hole-punching machine, a system featuring reliable operation, simple structure and stable performance has been designed in accordance with <b>working</b> <b>requirements.</b> [Method] MATLAB is used for accurate calculation of the cam profile, with the calculated results imported to SolidWorks to produce cam profile curves. Such curves are then modified according to <b>working</b> <b>requirements,</b> thereby to build a 3 D model for the cam mechanism. Finally, a 3 D model for the complete hole-punching system is built with SolidWorks. [Results] The hole-punching system designed herein {{is applied to the}} pot-seedling hole-punching machine and after performance test has proven to be able to meet <b>working</b> <b>requirements</b> and work reliably. [Conclusions] The design of this system can provide theoretical basis and reference for related research...|$|R

5000|$|In computing, {{the working}} {{directory}} {{of a process}} is a directory of a hierarchical file system, if any, dynamically associated with each process. It is sometimes called the <b>current</b> <b>working</b> directory or CWD, e.g. the BSD [...] function. When the process refers to a file using a simple file name or relative path (as opposed to a file designated by a full path from a root directory), the reference is interpreted relative to the <b>current</b> <b>working</b> directory of the process. So for example a process with working directory /rabbit-shoes that asks to create the file foo.txt will end up creating the file /rabbit-shoes/foo.txt.|$|R
