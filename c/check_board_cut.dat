50|$|The game is {{typically}} played on either a ping pong table or a folding banquet table. In general, {{this will be}} a plywood <b>board</b> <b>cut</b> to proper size, sometimes painted with sports, school, or fraternity symbols and given a liquid-proof coating.|$|R
50|$|Like many American {{films of}} the time, The Clodhopper was subject to cuts by city and state film {{censorship}} boards. The Chicago Board of Censors required one cut of a stamped postcard (the <b>board</b> <b>cut</b> closeups of all envelopes and postcards from films).|$|R
50|$|The yellow, {{resinous}} wood {{is used for}} lumber and pulp. <b>Boards</b> <b>cut</b> years ago from virgin timber were very wide, up to 1 m, and a thriving salvage business obtains these boards from demolition projects to be reused as flooring in upscale homes.|$|R
50|$|In 2013, Hunter {{accused the}} nation's {{military}} leaders of theatrics in the cuts {{that resulted from}} the failure of Congress {{to come to a}} deal to avert sequestration. He listed targeted spending reductions that he would prefer to make instead of the across the <b>board</b> <b>cuts.</b>|$|R
50|$|Ahead of its release, Jan Dara was {{controversial}} {{because its}} sexual subject matter, involving incest, rape and abortion, tested {{the bounds of}} Thailand's 1930 Censorship Code. The film was released with the <b>board's</b> <b>cuts</b> for the film's commercial run in Thailand, but it was available uncut for film festivals.|$|R
5000|$|Heckendorn {{has created}} a line of {{portable}} Atari systems, almost always using some form of Atari 2600 <b>board</b> <b>cut</b> up into a smaller PCB. The only exception is the Atari Jaguar [...] "64-Bit" [...] Portable and the Atari 800 laptop. He has also turned two Atari 800 computers into laptops.|$|R
5000|$|Hickey {{was first}} elected to serve a six year term on the OFPD in 2009 as a trustee, and was elected as the board's {{president}} in 2010. As {{the new president of}} the board, Hickey and the <b>board</b> <b>cut</b> the District's budget by more than $2 million during the first year ...|$|R
5000|$|Description: The {{description}} of the file. The first two lines should be the short summary, as older <b>boards</b> <b>cut</b> off the rest. Anything beyond that should be extended description, for up to eight lines, the official cutoff size. Additional text could be included beyond that, but might not be included by the board.|$|R

5000|$|Teak {{lumber and}} decking make up another {{prominent}} portion of Proteak's commercial offerings through it subsidiary Teakyard. <b>Boards</b> <b>cut</b> from teak logs exhibit an attractive golden or brown complexion {{with a tight}} grain pattern. Often used {{in the construction of}} boats, patios, and outdoor furniture, teak lumber is known for its ability to resist rot, warping and cracking.|$|R
60|$|There {{remained}} {{yet another}} danger. Although the palace itself was stone-built, its gilded domes and ornamental turrets were of timber, and therefore {{liable to be}} fired, as indeed had already happened. The roof also was of ancient cedar beams, thinly covered with concrete, while the interior containing an enormous quantity of panels, or rather <b>boarding,</b> <b>cut</b> from some resinous wood.|$|R
50|$|For 2012, McGinn {{proposed}} deferring some maintenance {{on roads}} and buildings {{and across the}} <b>board</b> <b>cuts</b> into the 2012 fiscal year, alerting police, fire and human-services departments to prepare for three to six percent cuts and all other departments for four to eight percent cuts, in order to close a $17 million funding gap. In other areas McGinn proposed funding increases.|$|R
50|$|They {{ride with}} the engine crews in the cab {{and are able to}} {{practice}} firing techniques, often on the Whistle <b>Board</b> <b>Cutting</b> - Waikari section. Qualified Locomotive Assistants and Drivers supervise these members and give tips and advice to assist the trainee. The trainees are also trained to prepare appliances such as the Detroit Lubricator and the Westinghouse Brake Pumps.|$|R
5000|$|Quarter sawing is {{sometimes}} {{confused with the}} much less common [...] "rift sawing." [...] In quartersawn wood, only the center board of the quarter-log is cut with the growth rings truly perpendicular {{to the surface of}} the board. The smaller <b>boards</b> <b>cut</b> from either side have grain increasingly skewed. Riftsawn wood has every <b>board</b> <b>cut</b> along a radius of the original log, so each board has a perpendicular grain, with the growth rings oriented at right angles {{to the surface of the}} board. However, since this produces a great deal of waste (in the form of wedge-shaped scraps from between the boards) rift-sawing is very seldom used. Quartersawn wood is thus seen as an acceptable compromise between economical but less-stable flatsawn wood (which, especially in oak, will often display the distinct [...] "cathedral window" [...] grain) and the expensively-wasteful rift sawn wood, which has the straightest grain and thus the greatest stability.|$|R

5000|$|The {{camp was}} {{designed}} to accommodate 150 people, organized into units of 30. As a matter of policy, a swimming pool was provided, as no natural alternative existed. The cabins with siding exteriors used [...] "waney board" [...] siding, with <b>boards</b> <b>cut</b> from untrimmed logs, resulting in irregular, wavy or [...] "waney" [...] edges. The design modifications at Greentop to accommodate handicapped children reduced capacity to 98.|$|R

As soon as you are on <b>board</b> <b>cut</b> or slip, and make sail for your lives. Adieu.--R.S." ...|$|R
50|$|Changes {{to public}} housing {{programs}} were minor during the 1980s. Under the Reagan administration, household contribution towards Section 8 rents was increased to 30% of household income and fair market rents were lowered. Public assistance for housing efforts was reduced {{as part of}} a package of across the <b>board</b> <b>cuts.</b> Additionally, emergency shelters for the homeless were expanded, and home ownership by low-income families was promoted to a greater degree.|$|R
50|$|Governor of Oklahoma Mary Fallin's {{proposed}} budget relies upon {{a combination}} of agency budget reductions, increased tax enforcement, agency consolidations, and government modernization to overcome the budget shortfall. Most agencies are budgeted to receive a 5% across the <b>board</b> <b>cuts,</b> but public safety, healthcare, and education will see smaller cuts of only 3%. If the governor's budget plan is realized, the $400 million deficit {{will result in a}} $100 million surplus.|$|R
5000|$|The GNR <b>Board</b> <b>cut</b> {{back the}} Cookstown branch to Coalisland in 1956 and the Ulster Transport Authority (UTA) closed the branch {{altogether}} in 1959. In {{accordance with the}} Benson Report submitted to the Government of Northern Ireland 1963 the UTA closed the [...] "Derry Road" [...] through Dungannon in 1965. The site of Dungannon station is now a public park and the former trackbed through the station is now a greenway.|$|R

25|$|Although {{the game}} is {{typically}} played on either a ping pong table or a folding banquet table, enthusiasts may create a personalized table for use by friends and visitors. In general, {{this will be a}} plywood <b>board</b> <b>cut</b> to proper size, sometimes painted with sports, school, or fraternity symbols and given a liquid-proof coating. Some companies sell tables, including portable and inflatable tables. However, the game can be played on any flat surface.|$|R
50|$|In 1863, Foyn {{contracted}} {{the building of}} his first whaling ship—a steam powered ship (also with sails) that had seven whaling cannons—the Spes et Fides (Hope and Faith). The ship was also fitted with <b>check</b> <b>boards</b> to increase the drag on harpooned whales. He also incorporated a 'compensator' or 'accumulator' from the Roys system—a series of rollers and springs installed below deck—to help the thick whale line, attached to the harpoon, to take {{up some of the}} shock without breaking.|$|R
50|$|The patrol {{cabin is}} a one story log cabin {{on a log}} sill {{foundation}} using 14 in logs. The cabin is square in plan with asphalt roll roofing on the gabled roof. The door retains its original wrought iron hardware. The interior is floored with 8 in <b>boards,</b> <b>cut</b> to a length of 3 ft to fit a pack saddle. The interior logs are trimmed with split-pole chinking. The ceiling is open, with exposed log framing.|$|R

50|$|Like many American {{films of}} the time, Little Miss Optimist was subject to cuts by city and state film {{censorship}} boards. The Chicago <b>Board</b> of Censors <b>cut</b> two views of a stamp (the <b>board</b> always <b>cut</b> close-ups of envelopes), and scenes of the murder striking man on {{his head with a}} bronze, man striking Carden with the bronze, and two theft scenes.|$|R
50|$|Miller's {{first major}} {{political}} defeat came in early 1973. For {{the first time}} in UMWA history, a budget was not only proposed but was also debated by the executive board. Miller budgeted $14 million for organizing, additional safety staff, and government relations. But he lost control of the council meeting. He could not obtain a motion to cut off debate or hold a vote, and the meeting ran for 14 days. In the end, the <b>board</b> <b>cut</b> $2 million from Miller's budget.|$|R
5000|$|Glass {{became the}} interim CEO and {{chairman}} of the Royals on September 23, 1993, following the death of the founding owner, Ewing Kauffman. Under Glass' leadership, the <b>board</b> <b>cut</b> the payroll from $41 million to $19 million. During the Major League Baseball strike of 1994-1995, Glass opposed any settlement with the players' union without a salary cap, and supported the use of strike-breaking [...] "replacement" [...] players, despite a court ruling that the use of replacement players violated federal labor law.|$|R
5000|$|Checkers or Chequers: often {{derived from}} the coat of arms of a local {{landowner}} (see Chequy), this name and sign originated in ancient Rome when a chequer board indicated that a bar also provided banking services. The <b>checked</b> <b>board</b> {{was used as an}} aid to counting and is the origin of the word exchequer. The last pub to use the older, now American spelling of checker was in Baldock, Hertfordshire, but this closed circa 1990; all pubs now use the modern [...] "q" [...] spelling (but see also Chequers, in Plants and horticulture below).|$|R
50|$|In use, the <b>board</b> to be <b>cut</b> {{is placed}} in the box and {{the point at which the}} board is to be cut is lined up with the {{appropriate}} slot in the mitre box wall. A backsaw is the most common kind of saw used for this operation. The cut is started by placing the saw blade in the slot and drawing the saw back and forth. The slot guides the cut all the way through so that the result is a cut that is perpendicular to the face or edge of the board (depending upon the desired orientation of the cut) and at the appropriate angle. For precise work, a <b>board</b> <b>cut</b> in a mitre box might then be further adjusted on a shooting board.|$|R
