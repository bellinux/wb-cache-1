50|$|What {{this means}} is that a partial {{beneficiary}} interest, of one to ninety-nine percent, can be given (assigned) to a <b>co-beneficiary</b> without triggering a lender's alienation recourse (i.e., the due-on-sale penalty requiring immediate satisfaction in-full of the mortgage loan.|$|E
50|$|Where the {{jus accrescendi}} {{operates}} the <b>co-beneficiaries</b> {{to whom the}} vacant portion accrues take the same shares thereof as they do of their own portion. Where it does not operate the share vacated by a co-heir devolves upon the intestate heirs of the testator, while the share vacated by a co-legatee falls into the residue of the estate and devolves upon the heirs, testate or intestate, of the testator.|$|R
40|$|The {{remaining}} cost {{of serial}} publication, once expenses are scaled {{down to the}} electronic-only level, is low enough to render the interests of everyone [...] the author, the reader, the funder of the author's research, the university supporting the author, and, yes, the electronic learned serial publishers [...] better served by recovering those costs and a fair profit at the author's end, {{in the form of}} page charges (paid for by the funders of the author's research and/or the university employing him to do the research, both <b>co-beneficiaries,</b> with the author, of the widest possible unimpeded distribution of the research reported), rather than by any version of reader-end payment, the latter depending as it does, on restricting access to what the author and his supporters would all prefer to see as free for all...|$|R
40|$|The Arab Spring, {{a revolutionary}} wave of protests and rebellions, and {{a process of}} regime change and democratization is {{sweeping}} the Arab world, but marginally touching women’s issues in Kuwait. While Arab women in Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Morocco, Yemen, Jordan, and Syria are active participants and <b>co-beneficiaries</b> {{of the process of}} change, Kuwaiti women have lost their electoral gains made in 2009 in the latest elections held in February of 2012. The objective {{of this paper is to}} examine the impact of Arab Spring on women in Kuwait, and their continued struggle for political participation in the country. It will also highlight the accomplishments of the women’s movement and its inability to utilize the general atmosphere supportive of women’s rights in Kuwait to maintain its parliamentary representation in the Kuwaiti National Assembly...|$|R
50|$|In {{so much as}} {{the land}} trust is beneficiary-{{directed}} rather than being directed and managed by its trustee, a remainder agent (i.e., a party appointed to assume responsibility for the trust and its corpus in the event of the death or incapacity of the original director-manager beneficiary) can be a remainder beneficiary (<b>co-beneficiary),</b> rather than needing to be remainder trustee, as would be the case with the standard, and far more common, trustee-directed inter vivos trust (i.e., the fully funded inter vivos family trust).|$|E
5000|$|The main character, Benny Rice, {{struggles to}} {{maintain}} a low profile, even {{going so far as}} to quit and change jobs when offered a promotion; his personal history mysteriously dates back to a series of dead ends. No matter what job he's had, he always quits before getting promoted. An amicable, friendly sort, he is in for quite a surprise when an unlikely friend, a multi-billionairess, is so taken with his gentleness and kindness that she decides to write him into her will as the principal <b>co-beneficiary</b> to her vast estate of billions. The [...] "Trust" [...] is a foundation that encourages the successful, the accomplished, and the intelligent - basically the cream of the crop - to undergo the rejuvenation process. However, her will requires the Rejuvenation Foundation give Benny exactly the same treatment reserved to the successful and rich. Public notoriety is exactly what Benny Rice does not want. He only wants to be left alone and allowed to go on with his quiet and peaceful life in a position in life that is least subject to public scrutiny.|$|E

But it sure is spick and span now. There’s a Major General that’s coming tomorrow to visit the camp. Thus we have to shine the place up. Wednsday [sic] afternoon I’m in a parade in his honor and we pass in review. He’ll be the highest officer I’ve ever seen. He’s the C. O. of this command area. Wyant is his name. Our training is progressing as usual. Today we had the nomenclature of the colt. 45 automatic. That was quite interesting. It’s getting pretty cold down here. In the morning I have P. T. first period and it’s rather cold {{when we have to}} strip to the waist. It seems stupid to me as most of us have colds + another fellow just went to the hospital with pneumonia. Another is going tomorrow for tonsillitis. This morning was all P. T. because that’s about {{all they have to do}} with us now that we’re through basic. We ran cross-country 3 miles. Then ran the obstacle course, climbed ropes, did chin-ups, and ran the obstacle course again. It’s tough, kid, no foolin’. But it makes me feel damn good to realize that I can do it. I’m getting in terrific shape here. And I must be gaining weight. I’d like to meet some hairy Jap now! I have a good duty Wednsday [sic] and probably all day Thanksgiving. Some of the Non-coms are working on it though, and maybe I won’t have it Thursday. I’m enclosing my insurance duplicate which you are to keep for me. I am putting $ 12. 50 a month aside for bonds. You are my beneficiary and as the <b>co-beneficiary,</b> I put Bobby. But I want it understood that if anything happens to me, and also to you, angel, god forbid; Bobby and Nanny are to split the Bonds. As I could only put one name down I put Bobby’s. Say hello to Judy for me and tell her I’ll write her as soon as I can, I’m still pretty busy. She’s a good kid. I’m right tire so it off to bed for me, beautiful. So goodnight sweetheart, I love you. Your devoted Son Judd [Translation ends...|$|E
40|$|This book {{analyses}} {{laws and}} practices {{for the management}} and disposal of confiscated assets in the European Union. The analysis explores the challenges and best practices of the Member States in this hitherto neglected area and strives to contribute to improvement of the overall effectiveness of the existing confiscation systems. It was prepared {{in the context of}} the Study RECAST – REuse of Confiscated Assets for social purposes: towards common EU Standards. The Study was awarded to the University of Palermo – Department of European Studies and International Integration by the European Commission, DG Home Affairs, under the 2010 ISEC Programme. It was carried out in cooperation with the Center for the Study of Democracy and the FLARE Network (<b>co-beneficiaries)</b> and with the support of the Italian Agenzia nazionale per l’amministrazione e la destinazione dei beni sequestrati e confiscati alla criminalità organizzata and UNICRI (associate partners) ...|$|R
5000|$|Wasserstein had a sixth child, Sky Wendy Esme Wasserstein, with Erin McCarthy after {{separating}} from Becker; {{they did}} not marry. McCarthy, a Columbia MBA graduate, was formerly a Director of Development at Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism and is a 17-year veteran {{in the field of}} non-profit fundraising. Sky was born at a New York hospital in 2008. Wasserstein gave Sky her middle name, Wendy, in memory of his sister who had died in 2006. He also named Sky an equal beneficiary in trusts he had established for all his children that held his legacy assets, including several real estate properties and businesses, such as New York Magazine. Wasserstein and McCarthy shared joint custody of their daughter. [...] Upon Wasserstein's death, trustees for the various family trusts reportedly barred only Sky from benefiting from the jointly owned trust assets while allowing her five half-siblings and <b>co-beneficiaries</b> exclusive and unrestricted access to all trust properties, and in 2011, they filed an accounting in a New York Surrogate Court.|$|R
5000|$|So David framed Danny {{for cocaine}} {{possession}} {{to get them}} off his tail, but all charges where eventually dropped. Soon after, Danny and Cricket married. Feeling betrayed and infuriated, a crazed Nina welcomed David home by shooting him five times. David survived, but pretended to be paralyzed, and Nina was arrested for attempted murder. While on the witness stand, Nina testified that she shot David out of self-defense because she was convinced that he wanted to kill her and Phillip. Her emotional testimony moved the jury and she was found not guilty. Meanwhile, David stole a body from the morgue, planted it in his hospital bed, and set it on fire to fake his own death. David coerced a plastic surgeon to make him look like David Hasselhoff. Instead, the surgeon carved the word [...] "killer" [...] on his forehead and fled while David was under anesthetic. David returned to Genoa City as [...] "Jim Adams" [...] with makeup on his forehead, hair dyed gray, a mustache and a southern accent. He romanced and married Nina's mother, Flo Webster, and manipulated Nina into changing her will so that he and Flo would be <b>co-beneficiaries</b> in the event of Nina's death. In 1991, Nina, Danny and Cricket attended a masquerade ball charity event, and David showed up dressed in the same costume as Danny (a wolf) intending to kill them all. But David's former mistress, Diane, learned of his plan and replaced the bullets in his gun with wax ones. When David cornered the trio in a maze outdoors, they were in on it and convinced David that he had shot and killed all three. While David was being pursued by the police and private detective Paul Williams, he ducked into a garbage chute at one point and was then fatally mutilated by a garbage compactor.|$|R
