In the south west area of the Boreal Shield ecozone lays the Churchill River Upland which has the second highest population of bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus). [...] This Upland area is home to waterfowl, such as the common loon (Gavia immer), red-breasted merganser (Mergus serrator), {{as well as other}} ducks, and geese on the many lakes of the region. The raven (Corvus corax), spruce grouse, gray jay (Perisoreus canadensis), <b>Connecticut</b> <b>warbler</b> (Oporornis agilis), northern three-toed woodpecker (Picoides dorsalis), osprey (Pandion haliaetus) and hawk owl (Surnia ulula) can be sighted in the boreal forests. The Mid-Boreal Upland ecoregion features these characteristic birds: white-throated sparrow (Zonotrichia albicollis), red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis), American redstart (Setophaga ruticilla), bufflehead (Bucephala albeola), ovenbird, (Seiurus aurocapillus) and hermit thrush (Catharus guttatus). The ruffed grouse (Bonasa umbellus), Canada warbler (Wilsonia canadensis), ruby-crowned kinglet (Regulus calendula) and white-breasted nuthatch (Sitta carolinensis), American white pelican (Pelecanus erythrorhynchos) are common sightings in the Mid-Boreal Lowland ecoregion.|$|E

Pierce reported that a large tract of timber 1 mile (2 km) [...] "southeast of the village of Monti, in the southeastern corner of the county" [...] was a particularly good area for birdwatching. In a 1930 paper, Pierce noted the unusual (for the area) birds he had spotted between 1923 and 1928. Among these were one specimen each of the ruffed grouse (1923), cerulean warbler (1927), and in 1928 a yellow-bellied flycatcher and a <b>Connecticut</b> <b>warbler.</b> As late as 1945, the Monti woods were home to at least 62 species of bird; the area was used as one of fourteen birding stations in the state. The woods contained the largest confirmed populations of gray-cheeked thrushes, bobolinks, eastern vesper sparrows, eastern field sparrows, and ruby-crowned kinglets in the state during the Spring of 1945.

The <b>Connecticut</b> <b>warbler</b> (Oporornis agilis) is an uncommon Neotropical migrant that breeds in the north-central United States and south-central Canada. Breeding populations {{of this species}} are reported to be declining. I analyzed habitat and landscape at three spatial scales (buffer radii of 100 m, 500 m, and 1, 000 m) for 86 sites within 28 forest stands in northern Minnesota for Connecticut Warblers sampled over an 18 -year period. I regressed combinations of habitat variables with two response variables, <b>Connecticut</b> <b>Warbler</b> abundance (the total number ever recorded at a site or stand) and <b>Connecticut</b> <b>Warbler</b> frequency (the number of years recorded out of 18 years) using a zero-inflated negative binomial distribution and logistic regression, respectively. A subset of models with # 1;AICc ≤ 4. 0 was retained and model-averaged predictions were calculated for each combination of buffer size and response variable. When comparing model-averaged predictions to observed data, the best models were those using <b>Connecticut</b> <b>Warbler</b> frequency at the 1, 000 m buffer (r 2 = 0. 52). These models were {{used to create a}} map of predicted <b>Connecticut</b> <b>Warbler</b> breeding habitat in the two national forests sampled.

40|$|GLAUCOUS GULL IN CEDAR COUNTY, NEBRASKA. On 4 December 1988, Ed M. Brogie {{observed}} and photographed a first-winter plumaged Glaucous Gull (Larus hyperboreus) at the tailwaters of Gavin 2 ̆ 7 s Point Dam, Cedar Co., Nebraska. It {{was seen in}} the company of several Herring (Larus argentatus) and Ring-billed (Larus delawarensis) Gulls, and was noticeably larger than both these species. Its large, bicolored bill, dark eye, flesh-colored feet, and large flattened head were noted. Its body feathers were whitish in color, intermixed with brown fleckings. The wings appeared long and had the translucent primaries characteristic of the species. In subsequent days as many as four or five Glaucous Gulls were observed in the area by several observers. Ellen Brogie and I last recorded the species for the area on 18 December. Photographs of this gull species are in possession of the author and others have been sent to the Nebraska Records Committee. SPRING 1988 SOUTHEAST NEBRASKA RECORDS. Glen and Wanda Hoge found a male Kentucky Warbler 26 May at Indian Cave State Park (Richardson Co.) campground, and on 28 May they saw two Black-billed Magpies in Jefferson Co., between Fairbury and Powell. A YANK, NOT A REB. The color original of the <b>Connecticut</b> <b>Warbler</b> picture (NBR 56 : 99) shows only a slight lightening of the head color as it goes under the throat; why the black-and-white picture shows such a sharp division and change of color is not apparent.

40|$|INTRODUCTION The {{amount of}} work reporters put into their reports is tremendous. Putting the {{information}} into a readable format which preserves it for future use is a challenge, but always interesting. Reporters can report on their own forms if preferred; some do now, often because of computerized record-keeping systems. I [Ross Silcock] enter the data into my computer, and so almost anything is fine, as long as I can read it. It {{is not necessary to}} list every species, although {{it is difficult to know}} whether your dates of arrival, high counts, etc. are significant until compared with the others submitted. Perhaps the best way to save time and work reporting is to plan your system so that it is simple to report when the time comes. NOTABLE EVENTS There are several highlights among the data presented below. A long list of rarities included Eurasian Wigeon, Oldsquaw, Gyrfalcon, King Rail, Snowy Plover, Red Knot, Ruff (first Nebraska record), Thayer 2 ̆ 7 s Gull, Iceland Gull, Lesser Black-backed Gull, Great Black-backed Gull, Scissor-tailed Flycatcher, Clark 2 ̆ 7 s Nutcracker, Cape May Warbler, Worm-eating Warbler, <b>Connecticut</b> <b>Warbler,</b> MacGillivray 2 ̆ 7 s Warbler (specimen in Lancaster County), Hooded Warbler, and Henslow 2 ̆ 7 s Sparrow. American Bittern is doing well in the Sandhills, as is Black-crowned Night-Heron, and especially Black-necked stilt. White-faced Ibis was also numerous, although it is not resident. Trumpeter Swan is present in the Sandhills in good numbers also, with several breeding pairs noted. This year, Cinnamon Teal was also present in good numbers. That these species are doing well speaks for the good condition of Sandhills waterbird habitats...|$|E
40|$|As {{is often}} the case, the spring season had {{something}} for everyone: potential range expansions, an incredible shorebird migration through the eastern Rainwater Basin, a scarcity of migrant warblers, and some genuinely rare birds. Timely spring rainfall transformed the Rainwater Basin, leaving large areas of sheetwater for migrant shorebirds and improving the attractiveness of wetlands, particularly renovated wetlands, to certain breeding species. Perhaps the most important bits of information we can record here are changes in breeding ranges or behavior. Of significance here is the second nesting record for Hooded Merganser, the increasing occurrence of Greater Prairie-Chickens at Rainwater Basin grasslands, the return of Mississippi Kites to Red Cloud, nesting Black-necked Stilts and American Avocets in the Rainwater Basin, discovery of Barn Owls in northeast Nebraska, expansion into the state of Scissor-tailed Flycatchers, possible breeding of Clark 2 ̆ 7 s Nutcrackers on the Pine Ridge, the continued feeding of grackle and robin chicks by the Sioux Co Curve-billed Thrasher (now {{considered to be a}} Husker), increasing evidence of Spotted Towhee introgression at Schramm State Park, and extra-limital nestings of Pine Siskin. The shorebird migration through the Rainwater Basin was one for the ages, with record numbers of Hudsonian Godwits, Ruddy Turnstones, Dunlin, and Buff-breasted Sandpipers found. Numbers of other species were also high, and L Mcconaughy contributed with a record count of Whimbrels. On the other hand, migrant warblers were drastically lower in numbers, notably Nashville Warbler (8), Chestnut-sided Warbler (3), Magnolia Warbler (1), Black-throated Green Warbler (1), and Blackburnian Warbler (0). What this means will have to wait for a regional or national perspective. Rarities were in evidence also, with some real 2 ̆ 2 zooties 2 ̆ 2 : Black-bellied Whistling-Duck, Anhinga, Glossy Ibis, White-tailed Kite, Red Knot, Ruff, Little Gull, White-eyed Vireo (in Sioux Co, no less), and <b>Connecticut</b> <b>Warbler...</b>|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION Extremes {{of weather}} {{conditions}} and resulting variation in water conditions were noteworthy this spring. The west was very dry, but the Rainwater Basin had ample rains resulting in excellent breeding conditions for various waterbirds, notably Eared Grebe and American Coot. Shorebird numbers were unremarkable, {{although there was}} plenty of variation between species. Indeed, Dunlin, with record numbers, and Ruddy Turnstones were numerous. Arrival dates were pushing early but not record early. Species earlier than average were American Golden-Plover, Mountain Plover, Black-necked Stilt, White-rumped Sandpiper, and Stilt Sandpiper. Increasingly associated with wetlands, albeit unrelated to water levels, Greater Prairie-Chicken continued to use grassy margins of wetlands in the Rainwater Basin for lek sites. Leks were also noted in agricultural fields. Use of these habitats suggests ability to adapt and bodes well for the future of this species in southeast Nebraska, where it is also doing very well in its traditional native grassland habitats. Red-shouldered Hawks are being reported away from the traditional breeding site at Fontenelle Forest, the only site known in the state. Other species continuing range expansions and increasing in numbers are Scissor-tailed Flycatcher, Carolina Wren, Blue-gray Gnatcatcher, and Summer Tanager. It was a fun spring for rarity-seekers, with a putative first state record Zone-tailed Hawk, one of fewer than 5 records on the Great Plains north of the breeding range, a state 7 th record Curve-billed Thrasher, found, appropriately, by the state 2 ̆ 7 s Non-game Bird Program Manager, and a 9 th state record Golden-crowned Sparrow. Lesser highlights, but still major zootics, were Common Crane, Prairie Warbler, <b>Connecticut</b> <b>Warbler,</b> and Cape May Warbler....

40|$|Human-induced {{effects on}} lowland conifer forests in hemiboreal regions are {{increasing}} because of expanded {{use of these}} northern ecosystems for raw materials, energy, and minerals {{as well as the}} potential effects of climatic changes. These forests support many breeding bird species across the Holarctic and allow the persistence of several boreal bird species in hemiboreal and even temperate regions. These bird species are of particular conservation concern as shifting patterns northward in forest composition caused by climate change will likely affect their populations. However, effective management and conservation options are limited because the specifics of these species' breeding habitats are not well understood. We modeled and mapped habitat suitability for 11 species of boreal birds that breed in the lowland conifer forests of the Agassiz Lowlands Ecological Subsection in northern Minnesota and are likely to have reduced breeding habitat in the future: Spruce Grouse (Falcipennis canadensis), Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides arcticus), Olive-sided Flycatcher (Contopus cooperi), Yellow-bellied Flycatcher (Empidonax flaviventris), Boreal Chickadee (Poecile hudsonicus), Golden-crowned Kinglet (Regulus satrapa), Ruby-crowned Kinglet (Regulus calendula), Swainson's Thrush (Catharus ustulatus), <b>Connecticut</b> <b>Warbler</b> (Oporornis agilis), Palm Warbler (Setophaga palmarum), and Dark-eyed Junco (Junco hyemalis). Sets of 7 to 16 potential environmental covariates, including both stand-level and landscape attributes, were used to develop individual species models. Within this lowland conifer-dominated ecosystem, we found significant selection for specific forest and landscape characteristics by all but one of these species, with the best models including between one and nine variables. Habitat suitability maps were developed from these models and predictions tested with an independent dataset. Model performance depended on species, correctly predicting 56 - 96 % of test data. We present a map combining suitability scores for five species of conservation concern that has been used for conservation planning and management opportunities across a broad, lowland forest landscape. We recommend managers utilize the detailed model development and validation framework to address local and regional conservation issues...|$|E
