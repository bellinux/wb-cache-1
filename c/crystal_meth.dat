5|$|The use of <b>crystal</b> <b>meth</b> is {{also known}} to lead to riskier sexual behaviour, but since gay <b>crystal</b> <b>meth</b> users tend to seek out other users to engage in sexual activity, they often prefer to make such {{arrangements}} via the internet.|$|E
5|$|In some {{countries}} bathhouses {{are prohibited from}} selling alcohol. (In Canada, where some bathhouses serve alcohol, a bathhouse holding a liquor license {{may be required to}} submit to liquor inspections, which activists claim are often a pretext for regulating gay sexual activity.) Many bathhouses deny entry to those who are visibly intoxicated but do notor cannotregulate the consumption of drugs (typically marijuana, poppers, ecstasy, cocaine, and <b>crystal</b> <b>meth)</b> by their patrons. The use of drugs and alcohol may make people {{more likely to engage in}} unsafe sex. Sex clubs with no private areas potentially find it easier to regulate consumption of drugs on their premises.|$|E

25|$|<b>Crystal</b> <b>Meth</b> {{is to be}} Method Man's {{upcoming}} {{fifth and}} final studio album. The album has no confirmed release date. The <b>Crystal</b> <b>Meth</b> album was first announced before Method Man began working on his and Redman's sophomore collaboration album, Blackout! 2, during which time it was tentatively titled The Crystal Method. In the liner notes of that album, it was given a scheduled release date for 2009. The album, however, was further postponed until it was later mentioned in an MTV interview it would be released in early 2010. At a concert on December 23, 2010, Method Man told the crowd to look for his album in March 2011. However, the album was postponed again.|$|E

25|$|On Walt's 50th birthday, {{during his}} {{surprise}} party, he watches a news report about Hank's arrest of some methamphetamine drug dealers. Walt is {{impressed by the}} monetary returns from the meth operation, and Hank offers to take him as a ride-along to a DEA bust. The next day, Walt faints at the car wash and is taken to a hospital; there, he is told he has inoperable lung cancer and will likely die in two years. During the ride-along, Hank busts a <b>crystal</b> <b>meth</b> ring; Walt sees {{one of his former}} students, Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), fleeing the scene, and deduces that Jesse is part of the operation. Looking to secure his family's well-being by producing and selling meth, Walt tracks Jesse down and blackmails him into setting up an operation. Walt gives Jesse his life savings to buy an RV that they can use as a rolling meth lab.|$|E
25|$|Following his {{appointment}} as leader, Wall undertook {{a review of}} party policies. He soon unveiled a more moderate policy platform that included plans for more treatment beds for <b>crystal</b> <b>meth</b> addicts, democratic workplaces, and a new model for economic development in Saskatchewan. With significantly revised core policies and increased emphasis on social issues, the party began to soften its image and attract voters in the cities. The party came short of victory in 1999 and 2003 {{because it had been}} almost nonexistent outside its rural stronghold. In 1999, it was completely shut out in Regina and won only one seat in Saskatoon. The 2003 election was better; while it picked up two seats in Saskatoon, it was again shut out of Regina. Had 500 votes in Regina Wascana Plains gone to the Saskatchewan Party, it would have resulted in a hung parliament; both the NDP and Saskatchewan Party would have had 29 seats apiece. In response to the results of the 2003 election, the Saskatchewan Party caucus voted in favour of the NDP's Crown Corporations Public Ownership Act, which provided legislative entrenchment for the ownership of the major crown utilities and services.|$|E
500|$|Although {{themes of}} sex and love are {{dominant}} in the album, the song [...] "Losing My Way" [...] diverges to a more serious topic, which {{was inspired by a}} documentary of <b>crystal</b> <b>meth</b> addiction that Timberlake watched.

500|$|The drug {{addiction}} of Towelie, {{a living and}} talking towel, is growing so overwhelming that the South Park boys make attempts to help him. Towelie's history is shown, using head interviews and on-screen captions (in a parody of Intervention), starting with years of {{drug addiction}} to cannabis, <b>crystal</b> <b>meth,</b> heroin and crack. He previously had a girlfriend named Rebecca and conceived a child with her (a washcloth), but he {{was kicked out of}} their home due to his persistently getting high. Having run out of money for hard drugs, Towelie starts getting high off of cans of computer duster. His life continued in a downward spiral, leaving him in heavy debt and offering oral sex to strangers for money in the alleys. The boys help him get a job at Lake Tardicaca, a summer camp for kids with physical and mental disabilities, as a towel to dry off the campers. However, Towelie persists in drug use and fellating strangers in the supply closet, and is fired by the camp. The boys confront Towelie and make emotional speeches to him as a plea to help him from killing himself (except for Cartman, who uses this opportunity to read what appears to be several tens of thousands of pages of anti-Semitic remarks on television, which the psychiatrist allows to continue in respect of the [...] "no interruptions" [...] rule). Towelie refuses their pleas until Butters reveals he has brought Towelie's child, [...] "Washcloth", which finally prompts him to accept the offer to go to a rehabilitation clinic in Southern California. Later, Towelie reveals he has completed rehab and is now living with his girlfriend and son.|$|E

2500|$|One of the {{important}} plot points in the series is that the <b>crystal</b> <b>meth</b> Walter [...] "cooks" [...] has very long crystals, is very pure, and (despite its purity) has a strong cyan blue color. [...] Truly ultra-pure <b>crystal</b> <b>meth</b> would tend to be clear or white. Nonetheless, it is noted during the show that some competing meth producers were dyeing their product blue to trick their customers into thinking they were buying Walt's highly potent product.|$|E
2500|$|On October 5, 2011, a new single from Method Man, {{entitled}} [...] "World Gone Sour (The Lost Kids)", {{was released}} on iTunes. In July 2012, he confirmed that the album will come out in 2013 & will be produced by RZA, although he has also stated that RZA would not entirely produce the album, but instead be {{just one of a}} few producers which includes RZA, Erick Sermon, Rockwilder, and some new younger producers such as Diggilo. He also expressed a desire to work with Odd Future frontman Tyler, The Creator. Throughout 2013, Method Man worked on material for <b>Crystal</b> <b>Meth</b> and significantly worked on the Wu-Tang Clan's sixth studio album, A Better Tomorrow.

According to a Brookings report, [...] "Jilin Province is not only the most {{important}} transshipment point for drugs from North Korea into China, but has itself become one of the largest markets in China for amphetamine-type stimulants." [...] Yanji had registered nearly 2100 drug addicts in 2010 compared to just 44 in 1990; local officials admitted that the actual number was possibly five or six times higher.|$|E

[...] The lab was making <b>crystal</b> <b>meth</b> among other drugs and was the largest ever found {{in the state of}} Querétaro. This military has also been involved in the break up of a kidnapping ring as well.

2500|$|Wainwright became {{addicted}} to <b>crystal</b> <b>meth</b> {{in the early}} 2000s and temporarily lost his vision.

[...] During that week, he played a cameo role in the UK comedy television program Absolutely Fabulous, spent several nights partying with George W.

2500|$|Port met {{his victims}} via online gay social networks. He used gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid (GHB), a date rape drug, adding it to drinks given to his victims, raped them, and murdered {{four of them}} in his flat in Barking. The {{prosecution}} said [...] "postmortem examinations on the four young men who died revealed that each had died from a drug overdose featuring high levels of GHB", but Port surreptitiously used other drugs on his victims: amyl nitrite (poppers), Viagra, mephedrone (meow meow) and methamphetamine (<b>crystal</b> <b>meth).</b> At his trial, the Judge accepted that Port's intention was only to cause really serious harm and not death, but {{made the point that}} Port must have foreseen that there was a high risk of death, especially {{after the death of his}} first victim. This was sufficient for him to be convicted of murder in English law.|$|E
2500|$|Another artist, Brian Welch, whose solo debut was {{released}} to Christian markets, found their album pulled from some Christian bookstores after the music video for [...] "Flush" [...] {{was released}}. The video is {{an interpretation of}} the authors personal experience with methamphetamine, before his religious conversion. At the time the album was pulled, Brian Welsh released a statement about the visual content of the video, relating its symbolism to his personal experiences of addiction and redemption. He also issued the following statement: [...] "The video for 'Flush' is about <b>crystal</b> <b>meth</b> addiction and the crazy things anyone addicted to meth will do while they're high or to get their fix. Everything the models were doing in the video is what I was wrapped up in while I was addicted to meth... I believe I would be dead right now if I continued using meth, but instead, I chose to surrender my life to Christ and die to myself so He could share His resurrection with me... There is a huge message of hope on my CD and I believe those retailers that are pulling the CD from their shelves are robbing someone spiritually by taking it off of the shelves." ...|$|E
2500|$|The show explores most of {{the main}} characters' {{connections}} to their families in great detail. Walt justifies his decision to cook <b>crystal</b> <b>meth</b> and become a criminal because of his desire to provide for his family. In the third season he tries to exit the business because it has driven Skyler to leave him. Gus convinces him to stay, telling him it is a man's job to provide for his family, {{even if he is}} unloved. In the final episode of the series, however, Walt finally admits to Skyler that the main motivation for his endeavors in the meth business was his own interest, in spite of secretly securing the 9.72 million dollars (which is all that he had managed to salvage) for her and the children. Jesse's loneliness in the early seasons of the show can be partly explained by his parents' decision to kick him out of their home due to his drug-related activities. This parental disconnect brings him closer to Jane, whose father berates her for her drug use. When Walt crosses paths with Jane's father, he refers to Jesse as his nephew and laments the fact that he can't get through to him. Jane's father responds by telling him to keep trying, saying [...] "Family. You can't give up on them, ever. What else is there?" [...] Jane's subsequent death, which Walt purposefully did not prevent, is a major factor in her father causing the airline crash {{at the end of the}} second season.|$|E
