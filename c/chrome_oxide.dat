5|$|The mineral {{crocoite}} (lead chromate PbCrO4) {{was used}} as a yellow pigment shortly after its discovery. After a synthesis method became available starting from the more abundant chromite, chrome yellow was, together with cadmium yellow, one of the most used yellow pigments. The pigment does not photodegrade, but it tends to darken due to the formation of chromium(III) oxide. It has a strong color, and was used for school buses in the US and for Postal Service (for example Deutsche Post) in Europe. The use of chrome yellow declined due to environmental and safety concerns and was replaced by organic pigments or alternatives free from lead and chromium. Other pigments based on chromium are, for example, the bright red pigment chrome red, which is a basic lead chromate (PbCrO4·Pb(OH)2). A very important chromate pigment, which was used widely in metal primer formulations, was zinc chromate, now replaced by zinc phosphate. A wash primer was formulated to replace the dangerous practice of pretreating aluminium aircraft bodies with a phosphoric acid solution. This used zinc tetroxychromate dispersed in a solution of polyvinyl butyral. An 8% solution of phosphoric acid in solvent was added just before application. It was found that an easily oxidized alcohol was an essential ingredient. A thin layer of about 10–15µm was applied, which turned from yellow to dark green when it was cured. There is still a question as to the correct mechanism. Chrome green is a mixture of Prussian blue and chrome yellow, while the <b>chrome</b> <b>oxide</b> green is chromium(III) oxide.|$|E

50|$|A key {{advance in}} audio {{fidelity}} {{came with the}} Dolby A noise reduction system, invented by Ray Dolby and introduced into professional recording studios in 1966. It suppressed the light but sometimes quite noticeable steady background of hiss, which was the only easily audible downside of mastering on tape instead of recording directly to disc. A competing system, dbx, invented by David Blackmer, also found success in professional audio. A simpler variant of Dolby's noise reduction system, known as Dolby B, greatly improved the sound of cassette tape recordings by reducing the especially high level of hiss that resulted from the cassette's miniaturized tape format. It, and variants, also eventually found wide application in the recording and film industries. Dolby B was crucial to the popularization and commercial success of the cassette as a domestic recording and playback medium, {{and it became a}} standard feature in the booming home and car stereo market of the 1970s and beyond. The compact cassette format also benefited enormously from improvements to the tape itself as coatings with wider frequency responses and lower inherent noise were developed, often based on cobalt and <b>chrome</b> <b>oxides</b> as the magnetic material instead of the more usual iron oxide.|$|R

The chlorine ion is extremely electronegative, therefore very reactive with certain compounds and elements. This reactivity is part of its usefulness in certain situations, but becomes a double-edged sword where stainless steel is concerned. Experimental corrosion studies on commercial SS- 304 have been carried out. The experiments were carried in brackish environment with a concentration variation, pH variation and contact time variation. The experiments were carried out by weight loss method, gasometry study and open circuit polarization studies. The post corrosion sample’s micro structures were analyzed with the aid of EDS (Energy dispersive spectroscopy) equipped SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope) EDS (Energy dispersive spectroscopy) instrument to detect the morphology of corrosion by-products. For further verification x-ray diffraction method was also used to detect any possible emerging corrosion by products on the sample’s surface. Experimental results confirmed that SS- 304 immersed in brackish environment with a variation of concentration, experience very little corrosion.

50|$|Philippines: Its mining {{industry}} had spectacularly {{developed during the}} U.S. administration. It produced more gold than Alaska, or any other American state apart from California. Gold extraction in 1941 represented 1,109,000 troy oz (34,500 kg), five times more than in 1931, and silver associated with gold ore at the same level. These extractions proceeded mostly from the Benget district in Baguio Province, Luzon. Iron deposits were rapidly developed and during 1941 1,191,641 tonnes was exported to Japan. Iron sources were located in North Camarines (Luzon), Samar Island and Surigao in Mindanao island. In the last of these, the iron reserves were estimated as 500 million tonnes; Laterithic minerals with content of silicon, sulphur, phosphorus, and an iron content of 48% were of easy extraction from coastal areas. Chromium was not discovered until 1935, but the Philippines in 1939 produced 164,000 tonnes and had fifth place, or 11%, of world production. Sources were in Zambales (Luzon) with its extraction of 10 million tonnes, <b>chrome</b> <b>oxide</b> with a high 50% of chrome content.

40|$|Bibliography: pages 92 - 101. The {{generation}} of electricity by the combustion of pulverised coal produces large quantities of coal ash (PF A). The disposal of this ash lias {{become a matter of}} concern due to the unsightly and hazardous nature of the PF A, and it {{has been the subject of}} intense investigations into its suitability as a raw material. Many uses have been proposed for the PF A. When used as landfill or mining backfill, the attraction is the low cost of the material. Other uses, as in the concrete industry, use PF A because of the improvements in quality of the resultant product. PF A has been suggested as a raw material for the production of wear resistant materials. The PF A is composed in the main of SiO₂ and AI₂O₃, and is a suitable material for the production of alumino-silicate ceramic materials, which are known to be tough and wear resistant. To establish the suitability of PF A from the Lethabo Power Station as a raw material, a project to prepare glass ceramic materials from the PF A was started. The conversion of the PF A to a glass ceramic material is a complex process involving many stages, and the processing at each stage will affects the final properties of the material. It is not possible in a short project such as this to examine all the factors which exert some control on the process, and so a small subset of these parameters was selected for study, namely the effect of added oxides on the crystallisation behaviour. Glass items which crystallise on holding at high temperatures commonly do so by growth of crystals from the surface of the item. This results in a material that is mechanically weak, due to the highly oriented microstructure that results. Nucleating agents can be used to obviate this. By providing sites for crystal growth in the bulk of the sample, they induce the crystallisation of fine grained ceramics with good mechanical properties. This study examines the effect of TiO₂, P₂O₅, and a mixture of iron and <b>chrome</b> <b>oxides</b> on the crystallisation of the glass prepared using PF A. The effect of these oxides was evaluated by examination of the microstructure of the crystalline specimens, and the kinetics of crystallisation were analysed by fitting data obtained by isothermal crystallisation of the specimens to the Avrami equation.

40|$|In {{advanced}} {{nuclear energy}} systems, lead alloys emerge as strong candidates for transmutation and advanced reactor systems as nuclear coolants and spallation neutron targets. However, {{it is widely}} recognized that corrosion of materials caused by lead alloys presents a critical barrier to their industrial use. A few experimental research and development projects {{have been set up}} by different groups such as at Los Alamos National Laboratory to study the corrosion phenomena in their test facilities and to develop mitigation techniques and materials. One of the central or main techniques under development is to use active control of oxygen thermodynamic activity (OTA) to provide protective oxide layers. Setting OTA in flowing lead alloys makes corrosion highly dependent upon the oxygen concentration and the oxidation processes at materials surfaces. The active oxygen control technique exploits the fact that lead and bismuth are chemically less active than the major components of steels, such as Fe, Ni, and Cr. By carefully controlling the oxygen concentration in lead-bismuth eutectic (LBE), it is possible to maintain an iron- and <b>chrome</b> based <b>oxide</b> film on the surfaces of structural steels, while keeping lead and bismuth from excessive oxidization that can lead to precipitation contamination. Thermal analysis has given an ideal oxygen level range in a non-isothermal lead alloy coolant system. However, in a practical coolant loop, the proper oxygen level depends not only on thermal factors but also on hydraulic factors (system operating temperature, temperature profile, flow velocity, etc.). In addition, the oxygen distribution in a non-isothermal lead alloy coolant system is still unclear. The optimal oxygen levels still need to be investigated...|$|R

40|$|Dolomite brick is {{the most}} {{important}} stable refractory under the working conditions of Argon Oxygen De-carbonization (AOD). For AOD applications, the Dolomite bricks should have positive Permanent Linear Change (PLC) on re-heating. A positive PLC dolomite brick has higher life and most suitable for joint less refractory lining with no cobble stoning defect. So the development of dolomite bricks having positive PLC during applications is a challenge for refractory manufacturing industry. In the present investigation, dolomite refractory bricks were prepared by varying different additive with an intention to get the positive PLC of the brick. It is well known that Iron Oxide is a good additive for dolomite brick sintering. It has also been reported that monoclinic zirconia (m-ZrO 2) additive improves the BD, CCS and PLC of dolomite brick. In this background, first trial composition was containing a fixed amount of 1 % m-ZrO 2 and different concentration and types of iron oxide. Mill scale containing Fe 2 O 3 was added in two different concentrations 0. 5 %, 1 % and in another trial 0. 25 % of nano Fe 2 O 3 was added. Fe 2 O 3 containing bricks showed a good improvement in BD and CCS due to the better sintering of dolomite grains in presence of liquid formation during sintering by the presence of Fe 2 O 3.

40|$|Most gasifiers are {{operated}} for refining, chemical production, {{and power}} generation. They are also considered a possible future source of H 2 for future power systems under consideration. A gasifier fulfills these roles by {{acting as a}} containment vessel to react carbon-containing raw materials with oxygen and water using fluidized-bed, moving-bed, or entrained-flow systems to produce CO and H 2, along with other gaseous by-products including CO 2, CH 4, SOx, HS, and/or NOx. The gasification process provides the opportunity to produce energy more efficiently and with less environmental impact than more conventional combustion processes. Because of these advantages, gasification is viewed {{as one of the}} key processes in the U. S. Department of Energy?s vision of an advanced power system for the 21 st Century. However, issues with both the reliability and the economics of gasifier operation will have to be resolved before gasification will be widely adopted by the power industry. Central to both enhanced reliability and economics is the development of materials with longer service lives in gasifier systems that can provide extended periods of continuous, trouble-free gasifier operation. The focus of the Advanced Refractories for Gasification project at the Albany Research Center (ARC) is to develop improved refractory liner materials capable of withstanding the harsh, high-temperature environment created by the gasification reaction. Current generation refractory liners in slagging gasifiers are typically replaced every 3 to 18 months at costs ranging up to $ 1, 000, 000 or more, depending upon the size of the gasification vessel. Compounding materials and installation costs are the lost-opportunity costs for the time that the gasifier is off-line for refractory repair/exchange. The goal of this project is to develop new refractory materials or to extend the service life of refractory liner materials currently used to at least 3 years. Post-mortem analyses of refractory brick removed from slagging commercial gasifiers and of laboratory produced refractory materials has indicated that slag corrosion and structural spalling are the primary causes of refractory failure. Historically, refractory materials with <b>chrome</b> <b>oxide</b> content as high as 90 pct have been found necessary to achieve the best refractory service life. To meet project goals, an improved high <b>chrome</b> <b>oxide</b> refractory material containing phosphate additions was developed at ARC, produced commercially, and is undergoing gasifier plant trials. Early laboratory tests on the high <b>chrome</b> <b>oxide</b> material suggested that phosphate additions could double the service life of currently available high chromium oxide refractories, translating into a potential savings {{of millions of dollars in}} annual gasifier operating costs, as well a significant increase in gasifier on-line availability. The ARC is also researching the potential of no-chrome/low-chrome oxide refractory materials for use in gasifiers. Some of the driving forces for no-chrome/low-chrome oxide refractories include the high cost and manufacturing difficulties of <b>chrome</b> <b>oxide</b> refractories and the fact that they have not met the performance requirements of commercial gasifiers. Development of no/low <b>chrome</b> <b>oxide</b> refractories is taking place through an examination of historical research, through the evaluation of thermodynamics, and through the evaluation of phase diagram information.

This study presents high temperature friction and wear characteristics of cobalt/nickel superal- loys, Haynes 25 (51 Co– 10 Ni– 20 Cr– 15 W), Haynes 188 (39 Co– 22 Ni– 22 Cr– 14 W), and Haynes 214 (75 Ni– 16 Cr– 3 Fe– 0. 5 Mn) sheets when rubbed against Hastelloy X (47 Ni– 22 Cr– 18 Fe– 9 Mo) pins. Tests are conducted at 25, 200, 400, and 540 °C with a validated custom design linear reciprocating tribometer. Sliding speed and sliding distance are 1 Hz and 1. 2 km, respectively. Friction coefficients are calculated with friction force data acquired from a load cell. Wear coefficients are calculated through weight loss measurements. Results indicate that Haynes 25 (H 25) has the lowest friction coefficients at all test temperatures. Above 400 °C, H 25 and Haynes 188 (H 188) exhibit the best wear resistance. Protective cobalt oxide layers are formed on the H 25 and H 188 at 540 °C in addition to nickel, <b>chrome,</b> and tungsten <b>oxides.</b> Although, it has better oxidation resistance, Haynes 214 has relatively higher wear rates than other tested materials especially at low temper- atures. However, its wear performance improves beyond 200 °C...|$|R
40|$|Slag {{attack of}} {{refractory}} materials used to line the hot face of slagging gasifiers limits their service life to between 3 and 24 months. These gasifiers use coal, petroleum coke, or combinations {{of them as}} raw materials to produce chemicals, liquid fuel, and/or electricity; with future consideration being given {{to the use of}} other abundant, low cost feedstock such as biomass. The ash from these materials generate liquid slags during gasification at temperature between 1300 - 1575 C and pressures up to 1000 psi, leading to severe slag attack of a vessel lining and causing unacceptable gasifier reliability and on-line availability. To maximize refractory life and provide protection of the gasifier metal shell, the best liners have contained a minimum of 60 - 70 pct chromia in combination with alumina, alumina/zirconia, or magnesia. The Albany Research Center of DOE has developed a phosphate containing high <b>chrome</b> <b>oxide</b> refractory liner that indicates potential for increased service life over currently used materials. This new liner has been produced commercially by a refractory company and installed in a gasifier for performance evaluation. Refractory issues in slagging gasifiers, the development and properties of the phosphate containing high <b>chrome</b> <b>oxide</b> material, and the preliminary results from the plant trial of this material will be presented...|$|E

The Red Lodge deposit is 25 miles southwest of Red Lodge {{which is also the}} nearest railroad point. Several workings are scattered throughout the area, exposing lense-like ore bodies averaging 33 % <b>chrome</b> <b>oxide.</b> Silver Star is a much smaller deposit 5 miles west of Silver Star, Montana, which is its nearest rail­road point. Lenses of chromite are exposed by pits and trench­es, which average approximately 36 % chromic oxide...|$|E
