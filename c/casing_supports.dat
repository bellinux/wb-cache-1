50|$|The {{most common}} type of pencil casing is of thin wood, usually {{hexagonal}} in section but sometimes cylindrical, permanently bonded to the core. Similar permanent casings may be constructed of other materials such as plastic or paper. To use the pencil, the casing must be carved or peeled off to expose the working end of the core as a sharp point. Mechanical pencils have more elaborate casings which are not permanently bonded to the core. Instead, the <b>casing</b> <b>supports</b> a separate, mobile piece of pigment core that can be extended or retracted through the casing tip as needed; these pencil casings can be re-loaded with a new core (usually graphite) when necessary.|$|E

The interaction of secondary flow with the main passage flow results in entropy generation; this accounts for considerable losses in turbomachines. Low aspect ratio blades in an axial turbine lead to a high degree of secondary flow losses. A particular interest is the reduction in secondary flow strength at the turbine casing, which adversely affects the turbine performance. This paper presents a selective review of effective techniques for improving the performance of axial turbines by turbine end wall modifications. This encompasses the use of axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric end wall contouring and the use of fences. Specific attention is given to non-axisymmetric end walls and to their effect on secondary flow losses. A baseline three-dimensional steady RANS k-ω SST model, with axisymmetric walls, is validated against experimental measurements from the Institute of Jet Propulsion and Turbomachinery at the Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule (RWTH) Aachen, Germany, with comparative solutions generated by ANSYS Fluent and OpenFOAM. The predicted performance of the stator passage with an axisymmetric casing is compared with that from using a contoured casing with a groove designed using the Beta distribution function for guiding the groove shape. The prediction of a reduced total pressure loss coefficient with the application of the contoured <b>casing</b> <b>supports</b> the groove design approach based on the natural path of the secondary flow features. This work also provided an automated workflow process, linking surface definition in MATLAB, meshing in ICEM CFD, and flow solving and post-processing OpenFOAM. This has generated a casing contouring design tool with a good portability to industry, to design and optimize new turbine blade passages.

40|$|The primary {{function}} of well cement {{is to provide}} <b>casing</b> <b>support</b> and zonal isolation {{for the life of}} a well (Thiercelin et al., 1998; Singamshetty, 2004; Iverson et al., 2008). Failure to achieve one or both of these conditions can lead to a migration of fluids up the wellbore and result in both economic and ecological disasters, as exemplified by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill on April 20, 2010. To avoid these kinds of failures, the cement must have sufficient strength to secure the casing in the hole and withstand the stresses of drilling, perforating, enhanced oil recovery, and hydraulic fracturing and also be able to keep the annulus sealed against the formation. This thesis analyzes and presents in detail some of the mechanical and physical properties of atmospherically generated foamed cements typically used in deep offshore wells in the Gulf of Mexico. Both static and dynamic measurements were taken across a range of foam qualities and include permeability, porosity, compressive strength, Young’s modulus (E), and Poisson’s ratio (ν). Investigating the properties of a range of foam qualities and cement recipes provides better understanding of the effect that different amounts of entrained air can have on cement performance and reliability. To better represent the behavior of cements in the wellbore, we subjected cements to pressure cycling and the measurements were analyzed over the range of these pressures. Our results show how these foamed cements behave and will prove to be a good baseline for future testing on cements generated under in-situ conditions. ...|$|R

30|$|The casing {{program is}} the most crucial feature that {{influences}} successful drilling operations and the longevity of the future geothermal fluid production. It implies assessing casing setting depths, a number of casing strings, nominal casing weight, casing material, type of connections and well completion. The main functions of casing programs are preventing <b>casing</b> deformation, <b>supporting</b> blow-out preventers and permanent wellhead, containing drilling and production fluids, preventing groundwater contamination, mitigating drilling fluid losses, protecting wells from corrosion, fracturing and erosion, preventing inter-zonal cross-contamination of geothermal fluids, defining a production zone and providing access to the reservoir (New Zealand Standard 2015). Conventional high-temperature (also called high-enthalpy) geothermal wells consist usually of three–four cemented casing strings. The typical casing program for most geothermal wells incorporates a conductor pipe, a surface casing, an intermediate casing which may serve as an anchor casing (i.e., casing string to which wellhead is attached), a production casing and an optional perforated liner (holed or slotted). All of these casing strings mentioned are cemented from casing shoe to top of casing string to prevent corrosion resulting from migration of reservoir fluids and to control thermal expansion during fluid production. A liner pipe, which is either suspended from a liner hanger or set at the well bottom, is usually left uncemented in the production section of the well. The completion is finalized by assembling a permanent wellhead {{at the top of}} the well. In most cases, it includes an expansion spool placed directly below the first master valve, which allows for expansion of the uppermost parts of the production casing string with respect to the anchor casing to which the permanent wellhead is attached.|$|R

40|$|A {{representative}} {{model of}} aero-engine test rig has been built, comprising the following basic components: rotor, shaft, <b>casing,</b> flexible <b>support</b> structure and bearing housings. One of the bearing housings is designed {{in such a}} way that the stiffness along one radial direction is adjustable, and can be set between linear and strongly nonlinear. In the latter case, it has the characteristic of snap-through springs, which is somewhat analogous to some magnetic bearing configurations. The adjustability of the bearing support stiffness makes it possible to study the dynamic properties of an engine rig with different boundary conditions. A notable aspect of this test rig is that all the major flexibilities in an operating aero-engine have been included, e. g. flexible <b>support</b> structure, <b>casing</b> etc. In the field of structural dynamics, mathematical models are widely used, especially at the design stage of a product when the effect of physical modifications on the total dynamic response of the structure is required before the real fabrication is carried out. In addition, highly accurate and efficient structural mathematical models are required for the emerging SMART machine concept, in which real-time machine diagnosis and prognosis methods demand fast and accurate decision-making based on the results of data processed using those models. The problem we are facing now is that, as the structure becomes more complicated, and consists of more segments and joints, many of which can be strongly nonlinear, the accuracy and efficiency of the mathematical model deteriorates rapidly due to the difficulties in modelling the joints and the nonlinearities existing in those joints. In this paper, a Frequency Response Function (FRF) coupling scheme, together with the Multi-Harmonic Balance Method (MHBM), is used to model the assembled test rig. The basic FRF coupling method has been well documented and its accuracy and efficiency in linear structure assemblies has been recognised in many papers and books.

40|$|The annular casing cement is an {{important}} part of the well barrier throughout the life cycle of a well. With the increasing number of plug and abandonment (P&A) operations, increased attention is now given to annular cement evaluation and the ability to prove adequate zonal isolation. If an existing annular barrier can be verified, heavy and time-consuming operations to restore the annular seal can be avoided. One of the concerns when it comes to cement integrity is the frequently occurring microannulus at the casing-cement interface. How such a microannulus forms and how it affects the integrity of the well, has been presented in this thesis. The acoustic logging tools used for cement evaluation today have also been presented. Their individual strengths and deficiencies have been discussed, and their response to a microannulus has been highlighted. A novel logging tool for cement evaluation the Annulus Verification Tool (AVT) has been developed at the Department of Geoscience and Petroleum at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). The tool is meant to complement the acoustic tools used today, to improve evaluation of the cement sheath's sealing capability, especially in cases where a microannulus is detected or suspected. The AVT applies a radial force on the inner casing wall while recording the displacement of the casing. This gives a measurement of the stiffness of the casing and any surrounding material, explaining how the tool can detect the presence of an annular cement. By measuring the casing displacement with high resolution, a microannulus can be both detected and its size can be quantified. This enables an evaluation of the microannulus's effect on the integrity of the annular cement. A prototype of the AVT has been constructed and an experimental set-up has been designed to allow for initial testing of the tool. This includes construction of full-scale diameter samples representing a typical production casing cement job, with the possibility to generate a uniform microannulus of a known size at the casing-cement interface. The experimental testing performed, has shown that the AVT is able to differentiate a <b>casing</b> <b>supported</b> by an annular cement sheath from a free pipe, due to the stiffness contrast. This makes the tool able to detect the presence of an annular cement even in cases where a microannulus exists. Results also showed that a microannulus gives a characteristic logging response, and that the microannulus size can be quantified with good accuracy. Inferring the quality of the cement sheath itself proved to be challenging, as the logging response seemed to depend on other factors than solely the mechanical properties of the casing, cement, and formation. Experimental tests performed with tool eccentricity and tilting has shown that the AVT is prone to improper centralization within the casing. Numerical simulations (finite element analysis) have been performed to further increase the understanding of the AVT's logging response in specific cases. This was done using the geometry of the experimental set-up, to be able to directly compare with the experimental results and aid for an increased understanding of these. The simulated free pipe stiffness was found to match decently with the experimental results, while the simulated well-cemented stiffness was found to be significantly higher than for the experimental results. Further, the simulation results showed that a casing without annular cement support is deformed almost exclusively by ovalization, rather than compression of the steel. This confirmed the underlying principles behind determining the microannulus size from the AVT logging response. Experimental testing of the AVT should be continued, to further evaluate the uncertainty related to the microannulus size calculations. Testing on more complex casing-cement-formation samples should also be performed. The work on the numerical simulations should be continued, to resolve the discrepancy in the well-cemented stiffness. Simulations should also be used further to evaluate potential damage to the casing and cement, imposed by logging. In a longer perspective, the AVT should be made ready for downhole application. Suggested modifications (compared to the prototype) have been presented, as well as the AVT's possible role in future cement evaluation...|$|R

The software used for structural design usually focuses on either of the following: Estimating the structure’s response to loading via some numerical method and then comparing the internal loading to load limits provided by standards. Determining the loading conditions present based on location data and standards. Applications capable of both estimating the loading and then evaluating the structure’s response are rare and usually very product-specific. The loading acting on the ESP casing structure was analyzed via the approaches provided in the Eurocodes. These approaches were addressed on such level, that their intricacy meets the requirements of preliminary design phase. A mathematical model of the structure was formulated to suit the selected platform with its complexness and this model was further developed to a finite element model to evaluate the structure’s response to loading via stiffness matrix approach. The mathematical tools for solving the linear systems, such as Cholesky and LU -decompositions, were addressed to provide an overview of the configurator tool’s solving algorithm and it was found, both theoretically and in practice, that Cholesky factorization is drastically more efficient than direct inverse when solving sets of linear equations. The project resulted in a configurator tool for the ESP <b>casing</b> primary <b>support</b> structures, capable of evaluating casing’s loading conditions without excessive knowledge requirements from the user. The tool analyzes the structure’s response to loading and either selects required profiles based on maximum allowed utility ratio or checks the structure’s durability with user-provided profile selections. The tool utilizes finite element method based on beam elements, solves the set of linear equations efficiently and analyzes the utility of the structure based on the requirements set by Eurocodes. The dimensioning results were extensively benchmarked against commercial software with only minute deviation. Additionally, the selections made by the configurator were compared to those made by a structural engineer by looking at old projects. The selections proved to be very similar even when the tool was used with limited knowledge of the design rationale behind the existing products and thus the approach and execution was proven effective...|$|R
40|$|The exoskeletal engine {{concept is}} one in which the shafts and disks are {{eliminated}} and are replaced by rotating <b>casings</b> that <b>support</b> the blades in spanwise compression. Omission of the shafts and disks leads to an open channel at the engine centerline. This has immense potential for reduced jet noise and for the accommodation of an alternative form of thruster for use in a combined cycle. The use of ceramic composite materials has the potential for significantly reduced weight as well as higher working temperatures without cooling air. The exoskeletal configuration is also a natural stepping-stone to complete counter-rotating turbomachinery. Ultimately this will lead to reductions in weight, length, parts count and improved efficiency. The feasibility studies are in three parts. Part 1 : Systems and Component Requirements addressed the mechanical aspects of components from a functionality perspective. This effort laid the groundwork for preliminary design studies. Although important, it is not felt to be particularly original, and has therefore not been included in the current overview. Part 2 : Preliminary Design Studies turned to some of the cycle and performance issues inherent in an exoskeletal configuration and some initial attempts at preliminary design of turbomachinery were described. Twin-spoon and single-spool 25, 800 -lbf-thrust turbofans were used as reference vehicles in a mid-size commercial subsonic category in addition to a single-spool 5, 000 -lbf-thrust turbofan that represented a general aviation application. The exoskeletal engine, with its open centerline, has tremendous potential for noise suppression and some preliminary analysis was done which began to quantify the benefits. Part 3 : Additional Preliminary Design Studies revisited the design of single-spool 25, 800 -lbf-thrust turbofan configurations, but in addition to the original FPR = 1. 6 and BPR = 5. 1 reference engine. two additional configurations used FPR = 2. 4 and BPR = 3. 0 and FPR = 3. 2 and BPR = 2. 0 were investigated. The single-spool 5. 000 -lbf-thrust turbofan was refined and the small engine study was extended to include a 2, 000 -lbf-thrust turbojet. More attention was paid to optimizing the turbomachinery. Turbine cooling flows were eliminated, in keeping with the use of uncooled CMC materials in exoskeletal engines. The turbine performance parameters moved much closer to the nominal target values, demonstrating the great benefits to the cycle of uncooled turbines...|$|R
40|$|This report {{includes}} {{development of}} an already designed solar water heater. The product shall be constructed {{in a way that}} it will suit a manufacturing line in Kampala, Uganda. To find the most suitable design for each area a research was carried out which included study visits, interviews and background reading. It provided the following results: Regarding the attachment of in- and outgoing pipes from the water tank many methods were taken into consideration and it was found that the best and most suitable way for this case is to weld the fittings using a weld robot. Regarding the fitting of the acrylic, a suitable solution is to make a flange when vacuum forming the plastic <b>casing</b> to further <b>support</b> the design. This could also be used to waterproof the case by using a sealing material. A suggestion of using pre-molded PU-foam is also presented. Regarding the ability to open the case for maintenance, two solutions were recommended. Either the use of spire clips or having the clips integrated into the casing. Regarding the calculation of material usage when deep drawing the tank and collector, it is possible to do a reasonably accurate assumption. The complicated design in this product makes the estimation less accurate. It is recommended that test draws are done and often the machine producer has more precise numbers. Regarding the coloring of the collector; chemical coloration is not possible on a galvanized surface. The method used is painting, either with powder coating or with wet paint. ...|$|R
