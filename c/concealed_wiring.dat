In existing buildings, installation of a new system, such as a security system or home theatre, may require additional effort to install <b>concealed</b> <b>wiring.</b> Multiple unit dwellings such as condominiums and apartment houses may have additional installation complexity in distributing services within a house.|$|E
50|$|A six-storeyed {{building}} of “New Europe” hotel, {{built by the}} order of Agha Musa Naghiyev on Qoncharovskaya Street (now Taghiyev Street), was the last work of Józef Plośko before the World War I. The hotel was equipped at the most modern level of that time - four elevators, sanitary appliances, central heating and <b>concealed</b> <b>wiring.</b> Reinforced concrete was broadly used as a load-bearing structure. As in all previous projects of Plośko, the façade of the building was faced with local limestone aglay.|$|E
50|$|Through these projects, Caldwell {{became a}} friend of Stanford White (1853-1906). Stanford White was a young {{architect}} who saw the importance that electric illumination would have in designing interiors and buildings. He understood that the new technological advances of slender tubing, small electric bulbs, <b>concealed</b> <b>wiring,</b> modern switch units, and low voltage current linked to small sockets would allow fixtures to take new and diverse forms, sharing decorative as well as utilitarian function. White encouraged Caldwell to become a designer solely of electric light fixtures. He died in 1914.|$|E

In the book, Wiles revealed that although Hill had split the end off of several arrows, he {{had been unable to}} split the arrow exactly as scripted (from end to end), and finally a specially constructed arrow with a large bladed head had been used, shot along a <b>concealed</b> <b>wire.</b> Nevertheless, Hill's accuracy was so great, he regularly hit tiny targets in live performances and on film.|$|R
40|$|By {{controlling}} {{a robotic}} arm, autistic children can learn the movements associated with social interactions. The goals of my invention are that autistic children would safely {{interact with the}} robotic arm and mimic the robotic arm to replicate movements associated with social interactions. The results from my Peter J. Eloranta Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship suggest that all autistic children successfully learned social movements by mimicking a robotic arm. A more effective robotic arm would better replicate human motion than currently available commercial products. Additionally, a protective sleeve that <b>conceals</b> <b>wiring</b> and joints would make this product safer for young children, the main client of the invention. by Devanie DuFour. Thesis (S. B.)

5000|$|... 10BASE2 {{systems do}} {{have a number of}} {{advantages}} over 10BASE-T. No hub is required as with 10BASE-T, so the hardware cost is minimal, and wiring can be particularly easy since only a single wire run is needed, which can be sourced from the nearest computer. These characteristics mean that 10BASE2 is ideal for a small network of two or three machines, perhaps in a home where easily <b>concealed</b> <b>wiring</b> may be an advantage. For a larger complex office network, the difficulties of tracing poor connections make it impractical. Unfortunately for 10BASE2, by the time multiple home computer networks became common, the format had already been practically superseded. It is very difficult to find 10BASE2-compatible network cards as distinct pieces of equipment, and integrated LAN controllers on motherboards don't have the connector.|$|E
40|$|In a modernising world, {{building}} and construction trends in recent urban centres such as Bangalore, set precedence for developments in other urban centres of the country. Under such conditions, evaluating {{the current state of}} building practices could prove useful for identifying the likely nature of nationwide building trends. This paper comprises a study to evaluate the current state of domestic <b>concealed</b> <b>wiring</b> practices {{in the context of a}} modern urban centre area in India. Presently, <b>concealed</b> <b>wiring</b> is the predominant wiring method adopted for residences, both bungalows and apartments. A modern residential block in the city of Bangalore (India) was chosen as the study area. The study included extensive interaction and surveys amongst residents, professionals (architects and engineers) and site personnel (contractors and electricians). In addition, the study also included site verification on the state of wiring practices in the residential block. The study indicates that while aesthetics was the prime reason that dictated the choice of <b>concealed</b> <b>wiring,</b> its effectiveness as an appropriate and safe wiring method is severely compromised. Details of the study, results and recommendations are presented in this paper...|$|E

50|$|The Germans also {{produced}} the Abwehrflammenwerfer 42, a flame-mine or flame fougasse, {{based on a}} Soviet version of the weapon. This was essentially a disposable, single use flamethrower that was buried alongside conventional land mines at key defensive points and triggered by either a trip-wire or a command wire. The weapon contained around 8 gal of fuel, that was discharged within a second, to a second and a half, producing a flame with a 15 yd range. One defensive installation found in Italy included seven of the weapons, carefully <b>concealed</b> and <b>wired</b> to a central control point.|$|R

However, the WSPU activists anticipated their action and increased security coverage for their leader, including enforcing strict secrecy surrounding her movements and erecting a <b>concealed</b> barbed <b>wire</b> barrier across the front of the stage. A short time into Pankhurst's speech, around 160 police officers stormed the hall and began to move toward the stage. They were met by a barrage of thrown chairs and plant pots, and soon fights broke out between the police and members of the audience. During the commotion one of the women present drew a revolver and fired several blank cartridges toward the ceiling. The police attempted to apprehend her, but she managed to slip their grasp and escape. Although not positively identified at the time, many since have stated that Janie Allan was the woman with the revolver.|$|R
40|$|This {{invention}} {{is comprised}} of an apparatus and method that combines a signal generator and a passive signal receiver to detect and record the path of partially or completely <b>concealed</b> electrical <b>wiring</b> without disturbing the concealing surface. The signal generator applies a series of electrical pulses to the selected wiring of interest. The applied pulses create a magnetic field about the wiring that can be detected by a coil contained within the signal receiver. An audible output connected to the receiver and driven by the coil reflects the receiver`s position {{with respect to the}} wiring. The receiver`s audible signal is strongest when the receiver is directly above the wiring and the long axis of the receiver`s coil is parallel to the wiring. A marking means is mounted on the receiver to mark the location of the wiring as the receiver is directed over the wiring`s concealing surface. Numerous marks made on various locations of the concealing surface will trace the path of the wiring of interest...|$|R
5000|$|At {{a meeting}} of the Keely Motor Company's board on 25 January 1899, President B. L. Ackerman issued a {{statement}} denying the Philadelphia Press report. The statement claimed that the tubes mentioned in the report had been discarded by Keely years before, and that in all his experiments since 1887 only solid wires had been used. Up to that time, it was stated, Keely had been working on a theory of etheric or vaporic force, and used the tubes to convey this force, but after 1887 he was convinced that he had discovered what he called [...] "vibratory sympathy". A <b>concealed</b> electric <b>wire</b> discovered in Keely's workshop was described by Ackerman as the remains of the wires of a burglar alarm, and in no way connected with the force used by Keely's motor. The statement denied all assertions that Keely was an imposter, and declared that there was no trickery in any of the results that Keely had claimed to have obtained.|$|R
50|$|In {{the spring}} of 1908, Ross decided to sail the City of Medicine Hat from Medicine Hat, AB to Winnipeg, MB, {{with a number of}} friends and crew on board. Having reached the small {{community}} of Saskatoon on June 7, Ross attempted to navigate the ship safely through the rail bridges that spanned a South Saskatchewan River in full spring flood. He let the passengers off just before reaching the Grand Trunk Bridge and lowered the ship's smokestack. Unfortunately, the high water <b>concealed</b> telegraph <b>wires</b> just beneath the surface, which became entangled in the ship's rudder, rendering the steering of the vessel impossible. The ship foundered and struck the south-most pier of the newly constructed Traffic Bridge. The crew were able to escape the sinking ship and no casualties were reported. However, the City of Medicine Hat was ruled a total loss. A sandbar eventually developed around the wreck and engulfed it. It was further buried when Rotary Park was created with landfill built up along the east bank near the Traffic Bridge.|$|R

5000|$|The {{protagonist of}} the series. Her {{appearance}} {{is that of}} someone in her mid-twenties but her real age is unknown, but she has stated to be born {{some time in the}} 11th century. In episode six, she says she has been looking for Tajimamori for a thousand years, making her at least a millennium old. She usually wears a black suit and glasses. Her whimsical personality serves as a front for a cunning, ruthless mind and extraordinary martial art skills. She always keeps a number of throwing blades and a garrote <b>wire</b> <b>concealed</b> on her body. At some point in the past, a [...] "Fruit of Time" [...] (also known as a [...] "time fruit") entered Rin's body, effectively making her immortal, unable to age, and capable of surviving and regenerating from a phenomenal amount of bodily damage. In episode four, she is sucked inside a running jet engine and regenerates her entire body over 25 years, albeit at the cost of all her memories (they return when she is briefly killed by Laura). In episode five, Apos removes Rin's time fruit, seemingly killing her just like Sayara and Maeno before, but it is revealed in episode six that an immortal's death is not permanent as long as her time fruit remains intact. Rin's time fruit is then brought to Apos' castle, where its proximity to Yggdrasil, the fabled source of all time fruits, speeds up her revival, which would have normally taken many decades. She and Mimi run the detective business Asogi Consulting together in West Shinjuku until their office is demolished in episode four.|$|R
40|$|Adams and Aizawa, in {{a series}} of recent and {{forthcoming}} papers ((2001), (In Press), (This Volume)) seek to refute, or perhaps merely to terminally embarrass, the friends of the extended mind. One such paper begins with the following illustration: "Question: Why did the pencil think that 2 + 2 = 4 ? Clark's Answer: Because it was coupled to the mathematician" Adams and Aizawa (this volume) ms p. 1 "That" the authors continue "about sums up what is wrong with Clark's extended mind hypothesis". The example of the pencil, they suggest, is just an especially egregious version of a fallacy said to pervade the literature on the extended mind. This fallacy, which they usefully dub the "coupling-constitution fallacy", is attributed, in varying degrees and manners, to Van Gelder and Port (1995), Clark and Chalmers (1998), Haugeland (1998), Dennett (2000), Clark (2001), Gibbs (2001), and Wilson (2004). The fallacy, of course, is to move from the causal coupling of some object or process to some cognitive agent, {{to the conclusion that the}} object or process is part of the cognitive agent, or part of the agent's cognitive processing (see e. g. Adams and Aizawa (This volume) ms p. 2). Proponents of the extended mind and related theses, Adams and Aizawa repeatedly assert, are prone to this fallacy in part because they either ignore or fail to properly appreciate the importance of " the mark of the cognitive" viz the importance of an account of "what makes something a cognitive agent" (op cit ms p. 3). The positive part of Adams and Aizawa's critique then emerges as a combination of the assertion that this "mark of the cognitive" involves the idea that "cognition is constituted by certain sorts of causal process that involve non-derived contents" (e. g. op cit ms p. 3) and that these processes look to be characterized by psychological laws that turn out to apply to many internal goings-on but not currently (as a matter of contingent empirical fact) to any processes that take place in non-biological tools and artifacts. In what follows, I shall try to show why these arguments display nothing so much as mutual failures of communication: crossed <b>wires</b> <b>concealing</b> a couple of real, important, but much more subterranean, disagreements. In particular, I try to show why the negative considerations advanced by Adams and Aizawa fail to successfully undermine the argument for the extended mind, and why their more radical positive story, unless supplemented by implausible additional claims, fails to cast doubt on the claim that minds like ours can (without the need for any radically new techniques, technologies or interventions) extend into the world...|$|R
