In this study, we have assessed the role of MDT in implementing the TA 121 appraisal {{of the use of}} <b>carmustine</b> wafers in high grade gliomas. METHODS: 296 patients with high-grade glioma suitable for maximal resection were recruited from 17 Neurosurgical Centres. The number of patients treated with <b>carmustine</b> wafers and reasons for not using this were recorded. Complications at 48 hours post-operatively and at 6 weeks post-radiotherapy were recorded. RESULTS: 94 / 296 (32 %) of suitable patients received <b>carmustine</b> wafers. In 55 % of cases <b>carmustine</b> was not used due to either surgeon preference or a lack of an MDT decision. There was no increased complication rate with <b>carmustine</b> use at either 48 hours post-surgery or at 6 weeks post radiotherapy. Use of <b>carmustine</b> wafers did not decrease access to and use of chemoradiotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: One third of patients suitable for <b>carmustine</b> wafers received them.

40|$|GliadelÂ® wafers {{have been}} {{developed}} to circumvent traditional obstacles in brain cancer treatment. Chemotherapeutic drugs administered intravenously are rendered largely ineffective by the blood-brain barrier. Gliadel wafers can be implanted at the tumor removal site during surgery.

However, treatment using <b>carmustine</b> can also cause a variety of serious side effects. Thus, we developed a model to examine the efficacy of Gliadel wafers and improve administration of <b>carmustine</b> to the tumor while minimizing damage to healthy tissue and the occurrence of harmful side effects. The transient diffusion of <b>carmustine</b> from wafers in a realistic, three-dimensional brain geometry was examined using COMSOLÂ®.

40|$|The {{nitrosourea}} alkylating agent, <b>carmustine,</b> {{is used as}} chemotherapeutic drug {{in several}} malignancies. The substance triggers tumor cell apoptosis.

40|$|MastersCarmustine (BCNU) is the {{mainstay}} of single agent chemotherapy for brain tumors against which other chemotherapeutic regimens have been judged. It has been reported that, hepatotoxicity is one of serious medical problems that limit the usefulness of <b>carmustine</b> during treatment of brain tumors. Vulnerability of liver to <b>carmustine</b> toxicity {{is due to the}} fact that liver is the main site for metabolism of <b>carmustine</b> to produce its cytotoxic metabolites which are implicated in hepatotoxicity. Hepatotoxicity that produced mainly due to increased oxidative stress and apoptosis. Metallothionein (MT) protein documented to play a decisive role in protection against oxidative stress insults. Zinc (Zn) can regulate MT gene expression by interacting with metal- sensitive transcription factors such as MTF- 1, and free zinc induces the accumulation of large amount of Zn-containing MTs. The present work aimed to test whether peripheral induction of MT by systemic administration of zinc sulphate (ZnSO 4) can improve the therapeutic outcome of <b>carmustine</b> during treatment of cerebellar glioma in rats by protection against hepatotoxicity and to what extent this may affect the antitumor activity of <b>carmustine.</b> For the fulfillment of the study aims, a total of 120 male Wister albino rats were used in the following experiments: Experiment (I) : Two groups of male Wister albino rats (20 /each) were injected intracerebellary by using stereotaxic technique where the control animals were injected with normal saline (10 Cl) and the glioma rats were injected with rat C 6 glioma cells (1 x 105 cells/ 10 Cl). The induction of cerebellar glioma was achieved depending on significant retardation in body weight gain and histopathological examination of cerebellar sections. 2 - Experiment (II) : 40 glioma-bearing rats were classified into 4 groups (10 /each). The first group is tumor-bearing control group. The second group injected with ZnSO 4 (15 mg/kg, i. p.). The third group administered <b>carmustine</b> (20 mg/kg, i. p.). The fourth group injected with ZnSO 4 (15 mg/kg, i. p.) then 24 h later with <b>carmustine</b> (20 mg/ kg, i. p.). After 48 h from <b>carmustine</b> administration, the following parameters were assessed: Liver and cerebellar MT contents in tissue homogenates by western blotting analysis, glutathione reductase (GR) activity, level of reduced glutathione (GSH), malondialdehye (MDA) level in liver homogenate, level of tumor necrosis factor âF (TNF-F) in serum, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content in liver homogenate, liver caspase- 3 activity, liver function parameters in serum samples including the activities of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and gamma-glutamyl transferase (G-GT) serum total billirubin and histopathological changes in liver sections. Experiment (III) : 4 groups (10 /each) of glioma-bearing animals were classified and treated in the same way of experiment (II), where the mean survival time was assessed for each group. Our data revealed that cerebellar implantation of rats with C 6 glioma cells lead to formation of cerebellar glioma as confirmed by reduction body weight and histopathology examination within 12 days. Also, ZnSO 4 administration induced liver but not brain MT. In addition, we found that <b>carmustine</b> administration significantly increased the extent of liver lipid peroxidation, serum content of TNF-F, liver caspase- 3 activity, serum bilirubin and the activities of serum G-GT and ALP along with marked histological deterioration but marked decreased of liver GR activity and depletion of liver GSH as well as decreased in hepatic ATP content. ZnSO 4 administration 24 h before <b>carmustine</b> resulted in marked decreases in hepatic lipid peroxidation, serum content of TNF-F, liver caspase- 3 activity, serum bilirubin and the activities of serum G-GT and ALP along with improved in liver histopathological features. Furthermore, preadministration of ZnSO 4 before <b>carmustine</b> showed significant increased liver GR activity, liver GSH content and hepatica ATP content. By testing the antitumor activity of <b>carmustine</b> by evaluation of the survival time of glioma-bearing rats, it was found that <b>carmustine</b> significantly increased the time of survival in the tumor-bearing animals compared with the corresponding glioma-bearing control animals. Also, the antitumor activity of <b>carmustine</b> was not affected by ZnSO 4 administration, but in contrast we found that preadministration of ZnSO 4 24 h before <b>carmustine</b> showed slightly significant increased in MST. We can concluded that induction of MT in the liver but not in the brain by peripheral administration of ZnSO 4 may introduce a new concept by which zinc can be used as an adjuvant therapy with <b>carmustine</b> for brain tumor patients to improve the therapeutic outcome via protection against hepatotoxicity...|$|E

Resistance to chemotherapy poses a significant problem for the effective treatment of androgen-independent (hormone-refractory) prostate cancer. Although high concentrations of sodium selenite exert strong anticarcinogenic effects in several cell culture systems and animal models, the therapeutic potential of selenite in patients with advanced or metastatic prostate cancer is extremely limited by the genotoxicity of high-dose selenite. We examined the ability of nontoxic concentrations of selenite to promote apoptosis and inhibit proliferation in carmustine-sensitized androgen-independent human prostate cancer cells. Androgen-dependent LNCaP cells exhibited a significant decrease in cell viability when exposed to nontoxic concentrations of selenite, whereas androgen-independent PC- 3 and DU 145 cells showed a significant decrease in cell viability only at higher concentrations. Treatment of PC- 3 cells with a combination of nontoxic selenite and <b>carmustine</b> resulted in greater increases in cytotoxicity, reactive oxygen species generation, growth inhibition, apoptosis, and DNA double-strand breaks, with concomitant decreases in DNA synthesis, glutathione, glutathione reductase, and antiapoptotic proteins. Combination treatment with <b>carmustine</b> and selenite triggered caspase-dependent apoptosis in PC- 3 cells, which was not apparent when these cells were treated with selenite or <b>carmustine</b> alone. Genotoxicity in normal prostate epithelial cells was completely absent in the combination treatment of <b>carmustine</b> and selenite. In addition, <b>carmustine</b> decreased the induction of DNA double strand breaks by high-dose selenite in normal prostate epithelial cells.

The <b>carmustine</b> implant wafer was demonstrated to improve survival in blinded placebo-controlled trials in selected patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent malignant glioma, with little increased risk of adverse events. Based on these trials and other supporting data, US and European regulatory authorities granted approval for its use in recurrent and newly diagnosed malignant glioma, and it remains the only approved local treatment. The preclinical and clinical data {{suggest that it is}} optimally utilized primarily in the proportion of patients who may have total or near total removal of gross tumor. The aim of this work was to review the evidence for the use of <b>carmustine</b> implants in the management of malignant astrocytoma (World Health Organization grades III and IV), including newly diagnosed and recurrent disease, especially in the setting of a standard of care that has changed since the randomized trials were completed. Therapy has evolved such that patients now generally receive temozolomide chemotherapy during and after radiotherapy treatment. For patients undergoing repeat resection for malignant glioma, a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled trial demonstrated a median survival for 110 patients who received <b>carmustine</b> polymers of 31 weeks compared with 23 weeks for 122 patients who only received placebo polymers. The benefit achieved statistical significance only on analysis adjusting for prognostic factors rather than for the randomized groups as a whole (hazard ratio = 0. 67, P = 0. 006). A blinded, placebo-controlled trial has also been performed for <b>carmustine</b> implant placement in newly diagnosed patients prior to standard radiotherapy. Median survival was improved from 11. 6 to 13. 9 months (P = 0. 03), with a 29 % reduction in the risk of death. When patients with glioblastoma multiforme alone were analyzed, the median survival improved from 11. 4 to 13. 5 months, but this improvement was not statistically significant. When a Cox&# 39;s proportional hazard model was utilized to account for other potential prognostic factors, there was a significant 31 % reduction in the risk of death (P = 0. 04) in this subgroup. Data from other small reports support these results and confirm that the incidence of adverse events {{does not appear to be}} increased meaningfully. Given the poor prognosis without possibility of cure, these benefits from a treatment with a favorable safety profile were considered meaningful. There is randomized evidence to support the use of <b>carmustine</b> wafers placed during resection of recurrent disease. Therefore, although there is limited specific evidence, this treatment is likely to be efficacious in an environment when nearly all patients receive temozolomide as part of initial management. Given that half of the patients in the randomized trial assessing the value of <b>carmustine</b> implants in recurrent disease had received prior chemotherapy, it is likely that this remains a valuable treatment at the time of repeat resection, even after temozolomide. There are data from multiple reports to support safety. Although there is randomized evidence to support the use of this therapy in newly diagnosed patients who will receive radiotherapy alone, it is now standard to administer both adjuvant temozolomide and radiotherapy. There are survival outcome reports for small cohorts of patients receiving temozolomide with radiotherapy, but this information is not sufficient to support firm recommendations. Based on the rationale and evidence of safety, this approach appears to be a reasonable option as more information is acquired. Available data support the safety of using <b>carmustine</b> wafers in this circumstance, although special attention to surgical guidelines for implanting the wafers is warranted.

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: The {{standard}} of care for newly diagnosed glioblastoma is maximal safe surgical resection, followed by chemoradiation therapy. We assessed <b>carmustine</b> wafer implantation efficacy and safety when used in combination with standard care. METHODS: Included were adult patients with (n = 354, implantation group) and without (n = 433, standard group) <b>carmustine</b> wafer implantation during first surgical resection followed by chemoradiation standard protocol. Multivariate and case-matched analyses (controlled propensity-matched cohort, 262 pairs of patients) were conducted. RESULTS: The median progression-free survival was 12. 0 months (95...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{assess the}} safety, tolerability, and hema-topoietic {{efficacy}} of sequential and concomitant adminis-tration of recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimu-lating factor (rhG-CSF) and recombinant human interleukin- 3 (rhlL- 3), to accelerate reconstitution of he-matopoiesis following myeloablative chemotherapy and autologous {{bone marrow transplantation}} (ABMT) for heavily pretreated lymphoma patients. Patients and Methods: Fifty-four consecutive patients with refractory or relapsed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL; n = 30) and Hodgkin's disease (HD; n = 24) were studied. Two different conditioning regimens were used for ABMT: <b>carmustine,</b> cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and cytarabine (BAVC) and <b>carmustine,</b> melphalan, eto-poside, and cytarabine (BEAM) for NHL and HD, respec...|$|E
40|$|Sustained {{release of}} <b>carmustine</b> (1, 3 -bis[2 -chloroethyl]- 1 -nitrosourea, or BCNU) via an episcleral {{implanted}} silicone device {{was used to}} treat Greene hamster melanoma implanted in the anterior chamber of rabbit eyes. Group 1 animals received <b>carmustine</b> intravenously; group 2 received the drug by local sustained release via an episcleral implanted silicone device; group 3 received the drug by both local sustained release and intravenous injection (a total dosage {{more than twice that}} in group 1); and group 4 was not treated. The effectiveness of the various administration routes was compared by clinical observation of tumour size and systemic and local toxic reactions, and by histopathological examination. <b>Carmustine</b> delayed the growth of Greene melanoma in all 3 treated groups, but was most effective when a lower dose of the drug administered intravenously was combined with an additional higher dose administered by local sustained release. Local side effects included corneal clouding and conjunctival oedema and congestion at the early stage of local drug delivery via the episcleral implanted device...|$|E
