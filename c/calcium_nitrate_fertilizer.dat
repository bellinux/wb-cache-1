The 3 alkali-nitrate based powders studied are: a blend with industrial sodium nitrate, one with potassium nitrate fertilizer and one with <b>calcium</b> <b>nitrate</b> <b>fertilizer.</b> The behaviour of these 3 samples has been compared with classic black powder made with potassium nitrate. More precisely, the deflagration capability of these 4 powders has been studied. For that, several experimental tests have been performed, such as the Differential Thermal and Thermogravimetry Analysis (DTA/TG) test, the Audibert-Koenen test and the open air trough deflagration test. The results obtained allowed a ranking of these powders according to their reactivity, sensitiveness to confinement and deflagration velocity.

Pot experiment was conducted in the greenhouse of the "Micronutrient Project", Fertilization Technology Department, National Research Centre, Dokki, Cairo, Egypt with Wheat (Triticum aestivum L. var. Gemieza 9). Plants were grown on sandy soil under salinity stress to study their response to soil application of different nitrogen sources compared to those irrigated with tap water. Nitrogen fertilization {{was added to the}} pots in the rate of 168 kg N ha - 1 as urea, ammonium nitrate, calcium nitrate or ammonium sulfate. Fifteen days after sowing, half of the pots of every treatment were irrigated regularly with tap water (S 1) and the other half was irrigated with saline water (S 2). Results showed that salinity stress of irrigation water significantly inhibited growth parameters in terms of plant height, fresh weight and dry weight accumulation. Nitrogen form significantly interacted with salinity stress of irrigation water. The highest reduction in all determined parameters was recorded with urea, while very slight or none with calcium nitrate. Macro- and micro-nutrient concentration and uptake by wheat shoots were significantly affected by salinity stress of irrigation water.

We determined the production of relay-cropped maize and sesbania at three landscape positions under researcher-designed and farmer-managed conditions in southern Malawi. Three landscape positions (dambo valley or bottomland, dambo margin with 12 % slope) were examined in factorial combination with N sources for maize (no added N, relay-cropped sesbania, and <b>calcium</b> ammonium <b>nitrate</b> <b>fertilizer).</b> Relay cropping of sesbania with maize increased maize grain yield, as compared to unfertilized sole maize in two of three years. Split application of 96 kg N ha− 1 as N fertilizer, however, was more effective than sesbania in increasing maize yields. Survival of sesbania seedlings and biomass production of sesbania were greater in the dambo valley and dambo margin than on steep slopes.

We assessed the NFRVs of the liquid fraction originating from separated pig slurry (MC), untreated pig slurry (PS), untreated cattle slurry (CS), the solid fraction from separated pig slurry (SF) and solid farmyard manure from cattle (FYM) in two consecutive years in silage maize grown on a sandy soil. Maize yields responded positively {{to each of these}} N sources applied at rates up to 150 kg of mineral fertilizer equivalents per ha per year (i. e. NFRV × total N rate). The observed NFRVs, relative to <b>calcium</b> ammonium <b>nitrate</b> <b>fertilizer,</b> amounted to 78 % for MC, 82 % for PS, 79 % for CS, 56 % for SF and 34 % for FYM when averaged over both years.

Rye cover crop establishment after the harvest of maize reduced nitrate concentrations of the upper groundwater by, on average, 7. 5 mg nitrate-N/L in the first year and 10. 9 mg/L in the second year, relative to a bare soil.

40|$|Nitrogen is {{normally}} the nutrient most limiting production of maize (Zea mays) — the main staple food crop — in southern Africa. We conducted a field {{study to determine}} the effect of N sources on soil nitrate dynamics at three landscape positions in farmers' fields in southern Malawi. The landscape positions were dambo valley or bottomland, dambo margin, and steep slopes. The N sources were <b>calcium</b> ammonium <b>nitrate</b> <b>fertilizer</b> applied at 120 kg N ha− 1, biomass from Sesbania sesban, and no added N. Sesbania biomass was produced in situ in the previous season from sesbania relay cropped with maize. Nitrate in the topsoil (0 to 15 cm depth) increased to 85 days after maize planting (mean = 48 kg N ha− 1) and then decreased markedly. Application of N fertilizer and sesbania biomass increased soil nitrate, and nitrate-N in topsoil correlated positively with amount of incorporated sesbania biomass. The strongest correlation between sesbania biomass added before maize planting and topsoil nitrate was observed at 85 days after maize planting. This suggests that the sesbania biomass (mean N content = 2. 3 %) mineralized slowly. Inorganic N accumulated in the subsoil {{at the end of the}} maize cropping season when N fertilizer and sesbania were applied. This study demonstrated the challenges associated with moderate quality organic N sources produced in smallholder farmer's fields. Soil nitrate levels indicated that N was released by sesbania residues in the first year of incorporation, but relay cropping of sesbania with maize may need to be supplemented with appropriately timed application of N fertilize...|$|R

Three tillage practices, no till (NT), reduced tillage (RT), and conventional tillage (CT), with residue (R) and without residue (NR), were studied. In Experiment I, 30 min, 23. 6 mm simulated rainfalls were applied at 0, 4, 60, 140 and 180 h.

NO⁻₃-N leaching and moisture content were measured at 0. 1, 0. 2, 0. 4, and 0. 6 m depths. Drainage water flow only occurred in Experiment II.

In the end, more NO⁻₃-N leached to 0. 6 m depth in the NT treatment. In Experiment II, NO⁻₃-N leached to deeper layers (below 0. 4 m) in RD and CT treatments. Conventional tillage exhibited the lowest drainage rates. Tillage and residue effects were statistically significant at the early stages of Experiment I (at 4 h and earlier), and at the later stages in Experiment II, at the 0. 1 m depth (P < 0. 05).

The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of the use of organic and/or mineral fertilizers on the nutrition and growth of orchid (Laelia purpurata 'werkhanserii' x L. lobata 'Jeni') seedlings in greenhouse. The following fertilizers were tested: an NPK fertilizer + micronutrients; a Ca source in the form of calcium nitrate; two organic fertilizers, one prepared with a mixture of bone meal, castor meal and ash, and a similar commercial fertilizer. The organic fertilizers were distributed on the surface of the pots every two months and the minerals were applied weekly to the substrate in 25 mL aliquots of a solution containing 1 g L- 1 of the respective fertilizer. The plant response to the application of mineral together with organic fertilizer was better, with higher dry matter production than by the isolated application of each fertilizer (organic or mineral). The treatments with <b>calcium</b> <b>nitrate</b> + NPK <b>fertilizer</b> did not differ significantly from the use of NPK fertilizer, probably due to the S deficiency detected in a mineral analysis of the tissues.

The effect of calcium nutrients on the severity of late blight disease and potato tuber yield differed among the two potato varieties. The maximum severity reduction (60 %) was noticed in the Gera potato variety with the application of calcium chloride mixed with <b>calcium</b> <b>nitrate</b> (1 : 1), supplied at 15 g per plant.
