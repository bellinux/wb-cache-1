5|$|In games {{subject to}} time control, a chess <b>clock</b> <b>is</b> used, {{consisting}} of two adjacent clocks and buttons to stop one clock while starting the other, such that the two component clocks never run simultaneously. The clock can be analog or digital though a digital <b>clock</b> <b>is</b> highly preferred under both USCF and FIDE rulesets. This is since most tournaments now include either a time delay (a countdown to when a clock starts again) or add (extra time being added prior or after the move) to their time controls. Before {{the start of the}} game, either the arbiter decides, or whomever is playing Black, where the chess <b>clock</b> <b>is</b> placed.|$|E
5|$|The <b>clock</b> <b>is</b> {{featured}} in the 2006 documentary Maxed Out, which is about national debt. Several members of the Durst family appear in the film.|$|E
5|$|A major concept used in {{the series}} {{was the idea of}} a running clock. This {{initially}} came from Joel Surnow, who wanted the audience to always know what time it was in the show's fictional timeline. This was done by an on-screen digital clock that appears before and after commercial breaks, and a smaller clock also appears at other points in the narrative. The time shown is the in-universe time of the story. When the running <b>clock</b> <b>is</b> shown full screen, an alternating pulsating beeping noise (like the kind seen on a time bomb) for each second can usually be heard. On rare occasions, a silent <b>clock</b> <b>is</b> used. This usually follows the death of a major character or an otherwise dramatic event.|$|E
50|$|Bornholm <b>clocks</b> <b>are</b> Danish longcase <b>clocks</b> and <b>were</b> made on Bornholm from 1745 to 1900. In Sweden {{a special}} variety of longcase <b>clocks</b> <b>was</b> made in Mora, called Mora clocks.|$|R

5|$|Games {{last longer}} than their defined length due to play {{stoppages}} – the average NFL game lasts slightly over three hours. Time in a football game {{is measured by the}} game clock. An operator is responsible for starting, stopping and operating the game clock based on the direction of the appropriate official. A separate clock, the play <b>clock,</b> <b>is</b> used to determine if a delay of game infraction has been committed. If the play clock expires before the ball has been snapped or free-kicked, a delay of game foul is called on the offense. The play <b>clock</b> <b>is</b> set to 40 seconds in professional and college football and to 25 seconds in high school play or following certain administrative stoppages in the former levels of play.|$|E
50|$|The <b>clock</b> in Thailand <b>was</b> not in colour until 1974. Originally the <b>clock</b> <b>was</b> {{based on}} the clock tower in Bangkok in black and white. In 1974 the <b>clock</b> <b>was</b> yellow on blue.|$|R
50|$|In 1790, the old {{bell tower}} 'on the ditch {{of the close}} of the canons of the said church' {{mentioned}} in the deed of 1386 which had housed the <b>clock</b> <b>was</b> demolished, so the <b>clock</b> <b>was</b> moved to the Cathedral's central tower. In 1884, a new <b>clock</b> <b>was</b> installed and the old one was left to the side.|$|R

5|$|A <b>clock</b> <b>is</b> {{documented}} in this tower since 1405, {{when a new}} bell was installed. The city accounts of 1438 mention the repair of the clockworks. The first mention of a dial is in 1443, and the first known image of the, much smaller first astrolabium dial (in the diary a cobbler journeyman from Ulm) is dated 1534. The jacquemart (bellstriker) is also {{documented in}} the same 1534 source.|$|E
5|$|Bughouse {{is usually}} played using clock move, which allows {{touching}} of pieces. A move is completed {{only when the}} <b>clock</b> <b>is</b> pressed. Touch move is practiced to a lesser extent. When used, it applies to pieces in reserve as well; they are considered dropped after contact has been made with an empty square.|$|E
5|$|The dial of the Zytglogge's astronomical <b>clock</b> <b>is</b> {{built in}} the form of an astrolabe. It is backed by a stereographically {{projected}} planisphere divided into three zones: the black night sky, the deep blue zone of dawn and the light blue day sky. The skies are crisscrossed with the golden lines of the horizon, dawn, the tropics and the temporal hours, which divide the time of daylight into twelve hours whose length varies with the time of year.|$|E

50|$|As the {{construction}} dates of the Salisbury and the Wells Cathedral <b>clocks</b> <b>are</b> disputed (they {{are most likely}} early 16th century clocks), the Cotehele <b>Clock</b> may well <b>be</b> the oldest working turret clock in the world. Even though large numbers of turret <b>clocks</b> <b>were</b> installed in the 14th century, none of them survived. The unique circumstances at Cotehele house assured that the <b>clock</b> <b>was</b> not replaced and scrapped.|$|R
50|$|The {{city hall}} {{building}} that the <b>clock</b> <b>was</b> built for {{came to an}} end in 1961. In the 1980s parts of the <b>clock</b> <b>were</b> moved to the Edmonton Court of Portage Place mall. The faces and hands of the current <b>clock</b> <b>are</b> replicas of the originals. The bells are not from the 1903 clock, and the chimes are now electronic. At the Portage Place location the <b>clock</b> <b>was</b> inoperable {{for a number of years}} due to damage from a contractor and later due to damage from a member of the public.|$|R
5|$|The term 'clock' {{encompasses}} {{a wide spectrum}} of devices, ranging from wristwatches to the Clock of the Long Now. The English word <b>clock</b> <b>is</b> said to derive from the Middle English clokke, Old North French cloque, or Middle Dutch clocke, all of which mean bell, and are derived from the Medieval Latin clocca, also meaning bell. Indeed, bells were used to mark the passage of time; they marked the passage of the hours at sea and in abbeys.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, the {{original}} clock was moved from its location near 42nd Street, {{and the building}} where the sign had been mounted was demolished so One Bryant Park could be built. An updated model was installed one block away {{on the side of}} a Durst building at 1133 Avenue of the Americas, facing Sixth Avenue near the southeast corner of the intersection with West 44th Street. The new <b>clock</b> <b>is</b> located next to an Internal Revenue Service office. The new clock, which can run backward, is outfitted with a brighter seven-segment display with multiple LEDs per segment, allowing the numbers to be read more easily.|$|E
5|$|After time expires, the chaser {{is given}} {{two minutes to}} catch the team by {{correctly}} answering {{a new series of}} questions, with each correct answer moving him one space along the board. If the chaser answers incorrectly or passes, the <b>clock</b> <b>is</b> stopped briefly and the team is given a chance to answer the question, which they may confirm among themselves before answering. A correct answer pushes the chaser back one space, or moves the team ahead by one if he has not moved on to the gameboard. An incorrect answer provides no movement for the chaser at all. Regardless of the outcome, the clock begins running again and the chaser continues to answer questions. If the chaser runs out of time before catching the team, the team splits the banked money equally, but if he catches them before time expires, the team leaves with no money. During celebrity episodes, if the chaser catches the team before time runs out, the team leaves with $15,000 divided equally.|$|E
50|$|In May 2014, the {{historic}} Water Tower <b>Clock</b> <b>was</b> {{installed in the}} concourse of the station. The <b>clock</b> had originally <b>been</b> erected in 1882 at Flinders Street station, opposite the end of Elizabeth Street, atop a lattice tower about 60 ft high. In 1902 the <b>clock</b> <b>was</b> moved to Princes Bridge station, and in 1910 it was relocated again, to Spencer Street station, where it remained until it was removed {{as part of the}} station's redevelopment in the mid-1960s. The <b>clock</b> mechanism <b>was</b> given to Museum Victoria, but the characteristic turret that housed the <b>clock</b> <b>was</b> sold to a scrap metal merchant. It was later rescued by private collectors, and the <b>clock</b> <b>was</b> returned to public ownership, being put on display in 1999 at the Scienceworks Museum, Spotswood. The <b>clock</b> <b>was</b> extensively restored before its return to Southern Cross, but the original mechanism remains in the collection of Museum Victoria.|$|R

50|$|The {{calculations}} for the <b>clock</b> <b>were</b> made {{up until}} 1928, {{after which they}} were supervised by the astronomer Professor Elis Strömgren. The drawings for the <b>clock</b> <b>were</b> made between 1934 and 1936, and the actual production of the clock took place from 1943 until 1955. The <b>clock</b> <b>was</b> started on 15 December 1955 by King Frederick IX and Jens Olsen's youngest grandchild Birgit.|$|R
5|$|Although accurate, shadow clocks {{relied on}} the sun, and so were useless at night and in cloudy weather. The Egyptians {{therefore}} developed a number of alternative timekeeping instruments, including water clocks, and a system for tracking star movements. The oldest description of a water <b>clock</b> <b>is</b> from the tomb inscription of the 16th-century Egyptian court official Amenemhet, identifying him as its inventor. There were several types of water clocks, some more elaborate than others. One type consisted of a bowl with small holes in its bottom, which was floated on water and allowed to fill at a near-constant rate; markings {{on the side of}} the bowl indicated elapsed time, as the surface of the water reached them. The oldest-known waterclock was found in the tomb of pharaoh Amenhotep I (1525–1504), suggesting that they were first used in ancient Egypt. Another Egyptian method of determining the time during the night was using plumb-lines called merkhets. In use since at least 600, two of these instruments were aligned with Polaris, the north pole star, to create a north–south meridian. The time was accurately measured by observing certain stars as they crossed the line created with the merkhets.|$|E
5|$|Quests are {{directly}} linked to Lightning's growth: as she completes quests, her stats are boosted, with the main story quests yielding the biggest boosts. Many side quests can only be obtained at certain times, since the real-time build of the world means NPCs are in constant movement, and only appear in certain places at a given time. Lightning can also accept quests from the Canvas of Prayers, a post board found in all the main locations. Upon completing NPC quests, Lightning is rewarded with a portion of Eradia, spiritual energy retrieved when a person's burden is lifted. Every day at 6 AM game-time, Lightning is drawn back into the Ark, a location where the in-game clock does not progress. Once there, Lightning gives her gathered Eradia to a tree called Yggdrasil: if she has gathered enough, the in-game <b>clock</b> <b>is</b> extended by a day. She can also restock on supplies and collect new equipment. Another feature in the game was Outerworld Services, a feature where players could take photos and share them, along with their personal stats and battle scores, on Facebook and Twitter. The Facebook features were disabled in April 2015. All Outerworld services were terminated in April the following year.|$|E
5|$|The cathedral is {{the seat}} of the Church of England Diocese of Bath and Wells. Wells has been an ecclesiastical city of {{importance}} since at least the early 8th century. Parts of the building date back to the tenth century, and it is a grade I listed building. It is known for its fine fan vaulted ceilings, Lady Chapel and windows, and the scissor arches which support the central tower. The west front {{is said to be the}} finest collection of statuary in Europe, retaining almost 300 of its original medieval statues, carved from the cathedral's warm, yellow Doulting stone. The Chapter House, at the top of a flight of stone stairs, leading out from the north transept is an octagonal building with a fan-vaulted ceiling. It is here that the business of running the cathedral is still conducted by the members of the Chapter, the cathedral's ruling body. Wells Cathedral <b>clock</b> <b>is</b> famous for its 24-hour astronomical dial and set of jousting knights that perform every quarter-hour. The cathedral has the heaviest ring of ten bells in the world. The tenor bell weighs just over 56CWT (6,272lb, 2,844kg).|$|E
50|$|<b>Clocks</b> <b>were</b> some of {{the most}} complex early {{mechanical}} devices. <b>Clock</b> makers <b>were</b> important developers of machine tools including gear and screw cutting machines, and were also involved in the mathematical development of gear designs. <b>Clocks</b> <b>were</b> {{some of the}} earliest mass-produced items, beginning around 1830.|$|R

50|$|An early <b>clock</b> <b>was</b> {{installed}} in 1699 by Richard Roe. This was replaced in 1830 by a clock by James Woolley which {{had previously been}} in the Nottingham Exchange. The diagonal <b>clock</b> face <b>is</b> {{thought to have been}} installed at the same time, and also been from the Exchange. This 1830 <b>clock</b> mechanism <b>was</b> replaced by an electric action clock in the 1970s but the <b>clock</b> face <b>was</b> retained. The James Woolley <b>clock</b> <b>was</b> given to the Nottingham Industrial Museum.|$|R
5|$|A {{standard}} adult football match {{consists of}} two periods of 45 minutes each, known as halves. Each half runs continuously, meaning that the <b>clock</b> <b>is</b> not stopped when the ball is out of play. There is usually a 15-minute half-time break between halves. The end of the match is known as full-time. The referee is the official timekeeper for the match, and may make an allowance for time lost through substitutions, injured players requiring attention, or other stoppages. This added time is called additional time in FIFA documents, but is most {{commonly referred to as}} stoppage time or injury time, while loss time can also be used as a synonym. The duration of stoppage time is at the sole discretion of the referee. The referee alone signals the end of the match. In matches where a fourth official is appointed, {{towards the end of the}} half the referee signals how many minutes of stoppage time he intends to add. The fourth official then informs the players and spectators by holding up a board showing this number. The signalled stoppage time may be further extended by the referee. Added time was introduced because of an incident which happened in 1891 during a match between Stoke and Aston Villa. Trailing 1–0 and with just two minutes remaining, Stoke were awarded a penalty. Villa's goalkeeper kicked the ball out of the ground, and by the time the ball had been recovered, the 90minutes had elapsed and the game was over. The same law also states that the duration of either half is extended until the penalty kick to be taken or retaken is completed, thus no game shall end with a penalty to be taken.|$|E
