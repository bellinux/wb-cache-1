500|$|The {{economic}} conditions facing {{the new government}} were dismal. Tens of thousands of Nova Scotians were impoverished and unemployed. The government expected that 75,000 Nova Scotians would need assistance during the coming winter. Biographer Stephen Henderson writes that Macdonald sympathized with the poor, but he worried that direct government relief payments would undermine their pride and self-respect. Even though direct relief might be cheaper, the Macdonald government preferred to hire the unemployed for public works projects such as paving roads. Henderson reports that in 1933, there were only [...] of paved roads in the province. By 1937, that figure had risen to 605. The government financed such public works by selling low-interest bonds and raising gasoline taxes from six to eight <b>cents</b> <b>a</b> <b>gallon.</b>|$|E
500|$|In his 1959 autobiography, Groucho and Me, Groucho comments, [...] "We {{thought we}} were doing pretty well as comic lawyers, but one day a few Middle East {{countries}} decided they wanted a bigger cut of the oil profits, or else. When this news broke, {{the price of gasoline}} nervously dropped two <b>cents</b> <b>a</b> <b>gallon,</b> and Chico and I, along with the other shows, were dropped from the network." [...] In his 1976 book, The Secret Word Is Groucho, he writes, [...] "Company sales, {{as a result of our}} show, had risen precipitously. Profits doubled in that brief time, and Esso felt guilty taking the money. So Esso dropped us after twenty-six weeks. Those were the days of guilt-edged securities, which don't exist today." ...|$|E

25|$|The company grew by {{increasing}} sales and through acquisitions. After purchasing competing firms, Rockefeller shut down those he {{believed to be}} inefficient and kept the others. In a seminal deal, in 1868, the Lake Shore Railroad, {{a part of the}} New York Central, gave Rockefeller's firm a going rate of one <b>cent</b> <b>a</b> <b>gallon</b> or forty-two <b>cents</b> <b>a</b> barrel, an effective 71% discount from its listed rates in return for a promise to ship at least 60 carloads of oil daily and to handle load and unload on its own.

From Pennsylvania to Georgia, the western counties engaged in a campaign of harassment of the federal tax collectors. [...] "Whiskey Boys" [...] also conducted violent protests in Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina, and Georgia. This civil disobedience eventually culminated in armed conflict in the Whiskey Rebellion. President George Washington marched at the head of 13,000 soldiers to suppress the insurrection.|$|E
60|$|The Secretary of the Treasury in {{his report}} favors {{legislation}} looking to an early return to specie payments, thus supporting views previously expressed in this message.

In these recommendations I cordially join.|$|E

And she got twenty-two <b>cents</b> <b>a</b> <b>gallon.</b> That was the game. She was one of the stupid lowly, she and her people before her--the ones that did the work, drove their oxen across the Plains, cleared and broke the virgin land, toiled all days and all hours, paid their taxes, and sent their sons and grandsons out to fight and die for the flag that gave them such ample {{protection}} {{that they were able to}} sell their wine for twenty-two cents.

50|$|In {{order to}} be {{certified}} as Top Tier, a gasoline must pass a series of performance tests that demonstrate specified levels of: 1) deposit control on intake valves; 2) deposit control on fuel injectors; 3) deposit control on combustion chambers; 4) prevention of intake-valve sticking. Gasoline marketers agree when they sign on to Top Tier program that all their grades of gasoline meet these standards. However, premium grade gasoline may have yet higher levels of detergent additives.Typically, Top Tier gasolines will contain {{two to three times}} the amount of detergent additives currently required by the EPA. The extra additives are estimated to cost less than <b>a</b> <b>cent</b> per <b>gallon.</b> In addition to the detergent additive requirement, Top Tier gasoline cannot contain metallic additives, because they can be harmful to a car's emissions-control systems.|$|R
5000|$|One dollar, or one euro, {{is divided}} into 100 cents; one can only pay in {{increments}} of <b>a</b> <b>cent.</b> It is quite commonplace for prices of some commodities such as gasoline to be in increments of a tenth of <b>a</b> <b>cent</b> per <b>gallon</b> or per litre. If gasoline costs $3.979 per gallon and one buys 10 gallons, then the [...] "extra" [...] 9/10 of <b>a</b> <b>cent</b> comes to ten times that: an [...] "extra" [...] 9 cents, so the cent in that case gets paid. Money is infinitely divisible {{in the sense that}} it is based upon the real number system. However, modern day coins are not divisible (in the past some coins were weighed with each transaction, and were considered divisible with no particular limit in mind). There is a point of precision in each transaction that is useless because such small amounts of money are insignificant to humans. The more the price is multiplied the more the precision could matter. For example, when buying a million shares of stock, the buyer and seller might be interested in a tenth of <b>a</b> <b>cent</b> price difference, but it's only a choice. Everything else in business measurement and choice is similarly divisible to the degree that the parties are interested. For example, financial reports may be reported annually, quarterly, or monthly. Some business managers run cash-flow reports more than once per day.|$|R

5000|$|In United States politics, the gas {{tax holiday}} or {{the gas tax}} {{loophole}} was a proposal made by presidential contenders Arizona Senator John McCain and New York Senator Hillary Clinton to suspend the federal excise tax on gasoline from Memorial Day to Labor Day in the year 2008. Proponents argued that this could potentially reduce {{the price of gas}} at the pump by about 18.4 <b>cents</b> <b>a</b> <b>gallon</b> for regular unleaded gasoline and 24.4 <b>cents</b> <b>a</b> <b>gallon</b> for diesel. If it were done, it was estimated the gas tax holiday would save consumers roughly $30 over the three-month period it would be instated. [...] However, Barack Obama and others argued that the oil companies would not significantly lower prices and would instead pocket most of the tax cut, effectively turning the cut into a tax loophole.|$|E

5000|$|The primary {{difficulty}} in completing the {{challenge lies in}} the limited capacity of the stomach. Generally, the stomach can hold only half <b>a</b> <b>gallon</b> (...) [...] Stretch receptors in the organ sense when its limit is reached, triggering a vomit reflex that swiftly empties the stomach. Moreover, drinking <b>a</b> <b>gallon</b> of milk is more difficult than drinking <b>a</b> <b>gallon</b> of water. The fat and protein in milk each inhibit the stomach from releasing its contents into the small intestine, forcing more of the liquid {{to remain in the}} stomach.|$|R
50|$|Many {{measures}} of capacity were understood as fractions or multiples of <b>a</b> <b>gallon.</b> For example, <b>a</b> quart is {{a quarter of}} <b>a</b> <b>gallon,</b> and <b>a</b> pint is half of a quart, or an eighth of <b>a</b> <b>gallon.</b> These ratios applied regardless of the specific size of the gallon. Not only did {{the definition of the}} gallon change over time, but there were several different kinds of gallon, which existed at the same time. For example, <b>a</b> wine <b>gallon</b> with <b>a</b> volume of 231 cubic inches (the basis of the U.S. <b>gallon),</b> and <b>an</b> ale <b>gallon</b> of 282 cubic inches, were commonly used for many decades prior to the establishment of the imperial gallon. In other words, a pint of ale and a pint of wine were not the same size. On the other hand, some measures such as the fluid ounce were not defined as a fraction of <b>a</b> <b>gallon.</b> For that reason, it is not always possible to give accurate definitions of units such as pints or quarts, in terms of ounces, prior to the establishment of the imperial gallon.|$|R
