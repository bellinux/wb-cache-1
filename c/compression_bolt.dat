50|$|Although the {{flatland}} bicycle {{is similar}} to most other BMX bicycles, flatland is often performed with specially designed frames with geometry (head tube angle, top tube length, etc.) suited {{to the needs of}} flatlanders. Front and rear bolt-on pegs, a hollow <b>compression</b> <b>bolt</b> on the forks for the front brake cable, and a rear brake cable detangler or Gyro to allow the bars to rotate endlessly without tangling the brake cables. Also invented specifically for flatland riding is the rear hub mechanism known as a freecoaster, which allows the rear wheel to roll backwards without engaging the hub and making the cranks rotate backwards as they would on a normal freewheel or cassette style hub. Other technical bicycle setup specifics can include zero offset forks, narrow handlebars, very high pressure tires (100psi and higher), and a very small front sprocket (18-28 teeth).|$|E
40|$|This {{innovation}} {{replaces the}} linear alternator presently used in Stirling engines with a continuous-gradient, impedance-matched, oscillating magnetostrictive transducer that eliminates all moving parts via compression, maintains high efficiency, costs less to manufacture, reduces mass, and {{eliminates the need}} for a bearing system. The key components of this new technology are the use of stacked magnetostrictive materials, such as Terfenol-D, under a biased magnetic and stress-induced compression, continuous-gradient impedance-matching material, coils, force-focusing metallic structure, and supports. The acoustic energy from the engine travels through an impedancematching layer that is physically connected to the magnetostrictive mass. <b>Compression</b> <b>bolts</b> keep the structure under compressive strain, allowing for the micron-scale compression of the magnetostrictive material and eliminating the need for bearings. The relatively large millimeter displacement of the pressure side of the impedance-matching material is reduced to micron motion, and undergoes stress amplification at the magnetostrictive interface. The alternating compression and expansion of the magnetostrictive material creates an alternating magnetic field that then induces an electric current in a coil that is wound around the stack. This produces electrical power from the acoustic pressure wave and, if the resonant frequency is tuned to match the engine, can replace the linear alternator that is commonly used...|$|R
5000|$|A {{subset of}} the {{standard}} DTIs described above, is the [...] "squirter" [...] type DTI that contains {{a small amount of}} material in the cavity of each protrusion. [...] "Squirter" [...] type DTIs are mechanically and metallurgically identical to the standard DTIs described above, except that as the protrusions of squirter type DTIs collapse upon tightening, the cavity material is expelled to the outer diameter of the device, giving a visual indication of protrusion <b>compression,</b> i.e. <b>bolt</b> tension. [...] While not approved by the ASTM or specifically mentioned within the RCSC specification, Squirter type DTIs are allowable because the RCSC specification requires all structural DTIs to conform the ASTM F959 standard whose reference documentation includes the ASME B18.2.6 standard. Since ASME B18.2.6 section 5.1 permits the inclusion of features to facilitate silicone emitting DTIs, squirter type DTIs are permissible and can be installed and inspected per the RCSC specification.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{reviews the}} results of {{laboratory}} testing of <b>compression</b> and <b>bolted</b> splices installed on stranded aluminum power conductors. The tests on compression splices involved connectors of 10 different designs using 240 mm 2 stranded aluminum cable. Testing on the bolted splices was performed on connectors of 16 different designs installed on stranded aluminum cable with dimensions of 50 and 240 mm 2. Splice performance was assessed {{on the basis of}} resistance measure-ments during short-circuit tests and thermal cycling as specified by the IEC 61238 - 1 standard, and from inspections of cross-sectioned connections. Differences in splice performance are related to such factors as physical properties of the materials in contact, splice assembly procedures, number of compression indentations or number of bolts, and other rele-vant parameters. The influence of conductor deformation on the ability to disrupt of aluminum oxide films on the conductor surface during connector installation is addressed. The laboratory data indicate that large mechanical deformations in a splice significantly improve connector performance. For com-pression splices, relatively soft (annealed) conductors lead to inferior performance than hard-drawn conductors, unless the soft conductor hardens significantly when it is deformed during installation. The sequence in which the compression indenta-tions are made, may influence connector performance. Key words...|$|R
40|$|This U. S. Bureau of Mines report {{describes}} a rock mechanics instrumentation program {{conducted in a}} shallow underground coal mine in central Illinois. This research program was {{designed to provide a}} basic understanding of the structural behavior of entry intersections. A wide variety of instruments and measurement techniques including hydraulic borehole pressure cells, multiple-point borehole extensometers, roof <b>bolt</b> <b>compression</b> pads, and overcoring were employed to monitor roof stresses, pillar loading, strata movement, floor heave, and bolt loading before, during, and after intersection development. A summary of intersection design theories, failure modes, and support techniques is included and instrumentation installation procedures and analysis methods are presented. The study identified two critical parameters that affect intersection stability: in situ horizontal stresses and geological discontinuities. Important design parameters for improving intersection stability are roof span and intersection geometry...|$|R
40|$|Actuators {{are used}} to drive all active {{mechanisms}} including machines, robots, and manipulators to name a few. The actuators are responsible for moving, manipulating, displacing, pushing and executing any action that is needed by the mechanism. There are many types and principles of actuation {{that are responsible for}} these movements ranging from electromagnetic, electroactive, thermo-mechanic, piezoelectric, electrostrictive etc. Actuators are readily available from commercial producers but there is a great need for reducing their size, increasing their efficiency and reducing their weight. Studies at JPLs Non Destructive Evaluation and Advanced Actuators (NDEAA) Laboratory have been focused on the use of piezoelectric stacks and novel designs taking advantage of piezoelectrics potential to provide high torque/force density actuation and high electromechanical conversion efficiency. The actuators/motors that have been developed and reviewed in this paper are operated by various horn configurations as well as the use of pre-stress flexures that make them thermally stable and increases their coupling efficiency. The use of monolithic designs that pre-stress the piezoelectric stack eliminates the use of <b>compression</b> stress <b>bolt.</b> These designs enable the embedding of developed solid-state motors/actuators in any structure with the only macroscopically moving parts are the rotor or the linear translator. Finite element modeling and design tools were used to determine the requirements and operation parameters and the results were used to simulate, design and fabricate novel actuators/motors. The developed actuators and performance will be described and discussed in this paper...|$|R
30|$|This note {{examines}} {{the feasibility of}} an improved slotted bolted connection for timber moment frames. In the improved connection, steel tubes are inserted into drill holes in glulam and fixed to the glulam with resin injection. Aluminum splice plates with curved slots, or curved elongated holes, are fastened mechanically by using high-strength bolts that go through the steel tubes. Since the <b>compression</b> due to <b>bolt</b> tension is fully supported by the steel tubes, the reduction of bolt tension due to shrinkage of the glulam can be avoided. The use of slotted aluminum splice plates allows stable energy dissipation due to smooth sliding between the aluminum splice plates and the end surfaces of the steel tubes within the specified range of rotation angle. Through quasistatic cyclic loading tests of two connection specimens, it was demonstrated that stable and nearly rigid-plastic hysteresis loops were obtained whose equivalent viscous damping ratio was more than 30 % {{in the range of}} rotation angle close to or greater than 1 / 50 radian. Although further improvement is necessary, the experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and potential of the present connection.|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} we {{analyzed}} {{the response of}} joints, which were designed as a full strength. Different configurations of joints have been designed. All joints were reinforced with added ribs. We analyzed the overall response of joints, which means {{the position of the}} center of <b>compression,</b> forces in <b>bolts,</b> bending the end-plate and the emergence of contact pressure between end-plate and column flange. We also analyzed the influence of the level of bolt preload on the response of joints. Based on the changes in the thickness of the end plate, we studied the development of contact pressure and, consequently, changes in bolt forces. In real situation, these compressive axial forces in columns are present, so we analyzed their impact on the response of the joint. In the joint, designed with haunch we analyzed the response of the joint in which we changed the haunch’s stiffness. We have also performed the analysis, where we changed the column profile. Column flanges were additionally reinforced by adding backing plates. In calculating the design value of yield stress of dissipative elements, factor 1, 1 is used. It captures the effects of steel hardening. We performed the analysis, where we presented a numerical model where steel hardening was consider. We determined if factor 1, 1 is appropriate. Based on the findings, we made recommendations for designing full- strength bolted column-beam joints in seismic resistant buildings...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{experimental and}} FE results of {{investigations into the}} structural behaviour of a connection between steel frames and precast concrete infill panels, forming a recently developed lateral load resisting system. The discrete connections, being structural bolts on the column and beam {{in every corner of}} the steel frame and confining the precast concrete infill panel within the steel frame, have a large influence on the global structural behaviour. They are loaded in compressive force and designed for ‘bolt failure’ by shearing of the bolt through the nut. Mechanisms that influence the connection behaviour include indentation of steel plates under <b>compression</b> produced by <b>bolts,</b> bolt deformation and flange bending. These mechanisms act in series. Experimental tests were performed on components of the steel-concrete connection to establish the stiffness and failure load of the several mechanisms. A FE model was developed for the component ‘flange bending’ of the connection, taking non-linear material properties and geometrical non-linearity into account. A comparison between the experiments and FE model shows that the FE model enables to simulate the connection component behaviour. The validated FE model was used to carry out a parametrical study. The experimental and FE results of this research will be used to develop FE models for full-size laterally loaded steel frames with discretely connected precast concrete infill panels with window openings...|$|R
40|$|Defective {{electrical}} connections in power distribution systems will result many circuit and equipment failures. Power distribution loss reduction and power system reliability improvement are becoming very important vicinities to be investigated. There are several methods available for power distribution loss reduction. Energy losses by connectors installed in power distribution network {{is one of}} the highly concerned. Quality of power line connections directly affects the power system reliability. Compression connectors or compression joints are a popular type of connectors used for joining or terminating conductors in power distribution network. Identification of good workman practices for power distribution line connections is important to make the power system more reliable. Standardization of process of power line connector installation and proper die selection technique for compression connectors is essential for power system reliability improvements. This study is an attempt to identify good workman practices required for making perfect power distribution line connections. This will be a guide in the assembly and preventive maintenance of efficient {{electrical connections}} for power distribution circuits. An efficient connection shows minimum resistance, both at initial assembly and in the long run. Data and experience gained through usage on power line connectors by Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) is the basis of this study. The results of tests carried out on power distribution line connections are incorporated in the recommendations. Properties of conductor metals and metal oxides are discussed. These illustrate requirements of recommended methods of making connections. Requirement for the proper selection of connectors, the proper preparation of conductors, and the proper application of fusion, <b>compression,</b> and <b>bolted</b> connectors are identified. Standards available on power line connectors are discussed to illustrate effective workman practices. Photographs of bad workman practices are included with explanations. Mathematical formula is developed for calculating correct die size for compression connectors. Amount of material available in connector and conductor are compared with area inside the suggested die for determining the correct die size. Performance identification of any type of connector installed in a power line is carried out by thermal imaging. Thermal images taken from few installed connectors are included and a procedure for assessing connector performance is suggested...|$|R
40|$|Ultrasonic/sonic {{impacting}} penetrators (USIPs) are recent {{additions to}} the series of apparatuses based on ultrasonic/sonic drill corers (USDCs). A USIP enables a rod probe to penetrate packed soil or another substance of similar consistency, without need to apply a large axial force {{that could result in}} buckling of the probe or in damage to some buried objects. USIPs were conceived for use in probing and analyzing soil to depths of tens of centimeters in the vicinity of buried barrels containing toxic waste, without causing rupture of the barrels. USIPs could also be used for other purposes, including, for example, searching for pipes, barrels, or other hard objects buried in soil; and detecting land mines. USDCs and other apparatuses based on USDCs have been described in numerous previous NASA Tech Briefs articles. The ones reported previously were designed, variously, for boring into, and/or acquiring samples of, rock or other hard, brittle materials of geological interest. To recapitulate: A USDC can be characterized as a lightweight, low-power, piezoelectrically driven jackhammer in which ultrasonic and sonic vibrations are generated and coupled to a tool bit. As shown in the figure, a basic USDC includes a piezoelectric stack, a backing and a horn connected to the stack, a free mass (free {{in the sense that it}} can slide axially a short distance between the horn and the shoulder of tool bit), and a tool bit, i. e., probe for USIP. The piezoelectric stack is driven at the resonance frequency of the stack/horn/backing assembly to create ultrasonic vibrations that are mechanically amplified by the horn. To prevent fracture during operation, the piezoelectric stack is held in <b>compression</b> by a <b>bolt.</b> The bouncing of the free mass between the horn and the tool bit at sonic frequencies generates hammering actions to the bit that are more effective for drilling than is the microhammering action of ultrasonic vibrations in ordinary ultrasonic drills. The hammering actions are so effective that the axial force needed to make the tool bit advance into the material of interest is much smaller than in ordinary twist drilling, ultrasonic drilling, or ordinary steady pushing...|$|R
40|$|Laminated {{composites}} {{are increasingly}} employed {{in a variety}} of industries ranging from Aerospace to Wind Power. The high specific stiffness and strength of these materials renders their wider application advantageous in many fields. However, the broader implementation of such composites is frequently restrained by their poor impact resistance and damage tolerance. Even events as innocuous as a dropped tool can impart significant damage to such materials. Such damage can lead to drops in the strength and stiffness that are unacceptable for many applications, particularly those in Aerospace. 3 D woven composites present a possible means of improving the impact resistance and damage tolerance of composite materials. The incorporation of out-of-plane fibres, transversely passing through layers of in-plane fibres, is the means by which this improvement in performance is obtained. This body of work presents an investigation into the behaviour of three dimensionally woven carbon fibre composites. Specifically, the subject composite fabric had an orthogonally woven three dimensional structure. The novelty of these materials is such that knowledge and understanding of their mechanical behaviour is very limited. The purpose of this work was to remedy this through experimental and analytical analysis of these composites. The 3 D woven materials were characterized experimentally using a variety of techniques. In addition to evaluating the material experimentally, analytical methods were also used. Current analytical methods were found to be deficient in their incapacity to account for in-plane crimp on a micro scale. As a result a new micro scale approach for predicting the stiffness and strength of these 3 D woven materials was developed. The composites used for this thesis were tested using a variety of means. The range of test methodologies used subjected the materials to in-plane, out-of-plane, dynamic and quasi- static loadings. Techniques used included; tension, shear, impact, <b>compression</b> after impact, <b>bolt</b> shear out and bearing pull through. Other means implemented included microscopy, C-scanning and Digital Image Correlation. In addition, conventional composites made from unidirectional pre-pregs or Non-Crimp Fabrics (NCFs) were tested to provide a basis for comparison. Analysis and prediction of the behaviour of conventional laminated composites can be performed using a variety of methods. While the range of methods available is broad, they commonly use individual plies of composite as their fundamental building blocks. This is both convenient analytically and experimentally as the properties of such individual lamina may be found with reasonable ease. However, 3 D woven composites are integrated laminates due to the out‐of‐plane fibres they possess. As a result, the accuracy of conventional experimental or analytical methods for evaluating these materials is likely to be poor. In order {{to gain a better understanding}} of the behaviour of these 3 D woven materials a new micromechanics model was developed. In contrast to other available methods, this micromechanics approach examines the effect of crimp at the fibre level. The method proposed is also distinct in its capability of simultaneously accounting for varying crimp across and along a section of composite.
