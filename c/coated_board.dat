50|$|The {{paperboard}} {{sector is}} mainly {{looked at in}} conjunction with the paper industry. The Paper & Paperboard market size (2007) had a value of 630.9 billion USD and a volume of 320.3 million metric tons. Of that market 40.1% is European. About 50% of all produced paper is used for packaging, followed by printing and writing. According to ProCarton, the consumption of paper and paperboard seem to correlate with economic trends (GDP). Sales of carton in Europe sum up to around 8 billion Euros worth. Over 1,100 printers produce 5.4 million tonnes of cartonboard yearly. Cartons make up one third of paper and board packaging and 15% of all packaging. A bit more than half (54%) of the European carton is produced using recovered fibre or waste paper.The paper and paperboard industry is quite energy and capital intensive. Just a <b>coated</b> <b>board</b> machine itself can cost around 90 - 120 million Euros(about 125 - 166 million USD in 11/2011). Economies of scale apply, because of which a few large players often dominate the market place. E.g. in North America the top 5 producers have a market share of 85%.|$|E

40|$|The Paper {{industry}} {{is vital for}} social, cultural, economic and educational development of a country. As such, it needs to survive and compete with global giants in the world. Therefore, it has to produce standard products at minimum cost. Against this background and for maximisation of contribution, two paper mills i. e. private and joint sectors are brought into the sample. The optimal product mix for private sector paper mill is writing and printing paper and <b>coated</b> <b>board</b> while writing and printing, colour printing / process paper and newsprint for joint sector paper mill. The duality analysis shows that one hour of working in pulp mill and paper making departments increase profit contribution by Rs. 95, 149 {{in the private sector}} paper mill whereas Rs. 82, 621 in paper making department of joint sector paper mill. The sensitivity analysis reveals that within the range, a change either positive or negative in profit contribution per unit of optimal product mix would not cause for change in the optimal solution.

Because the tensile strength of the fibre-plaster boards is approximately 10 -times lower than the compressive one, it is convenient to strengthen the boards in their tensile diagonal direction with carbon fibre-reinforced polymer (CFRP) strips, which are glued to the boards. Based on analysis of experimental research results [7] special approximate mathematical models have been developed.

40|$|Paper and {{paperboard}} based product {{are significantly}} {{used in our}} daily life. The most effective and efficient way to produce paperboard packages is by converting. This study analyses the key aspects of converting mechanism {{and the effect of}} various barrier properties of dispersion coated commercial paperboard material to enhance the end user quality of paperboard and paper-based products. The preliminary focus {{of this study is to}} determine the creasability of barrier properties of dispersion coated paperboards, and the results are complemented and validated with experimental techniques such as calendering, creasing, Cobb 60 and OGR test. The coating materials used in this study are hydroxypropylated starch, kaolin clay, and styrene-butadiene latex and also their effects on creased and uncreased paperboard are compared with the aid of light microscopy. Furthermore, the effect of creasing and calendaring on barrier properties of dispersion <b>coated</b> <b>board</b> is investigated. The results revealed from these two approaches that light microscopy is not capable to thoroughly analyze the coating cracks. High-resolution microscopes such as SEM is required entirely to understand the individual fibre damage. Moreover, dispersion coated paperboard, and commercial material showed positive results on oil and grease resistance (OGR) test. The calendaring process can be used to improve the OGR of barrier properties of dispersion coated paperboard.

40|$|The extrusion-coated {{paperboard}} tray packaging {{which contains}} a tray container {{and a piece}} of lidding film is widely used along with MAP technology in fresh food packaging industry. Much research has been done on perforation onto lidding film. This research is based on the attempt of perforating on the tray materials : uncoated paperboard and paperboard coated with PE polymer or PET polymer. The study was an approach to the perforations on the paperboard and how to design its patterns. The study focused on to which degree does the perforation influences the strength of the paperboard materials. The diameter and the shape of perforations were observed. The GTR and WVTR of the materials were tested. From the comparison of 25 patterns, it is inferred that the better tensile strength could be achieved when the micro-holes placed with more distance and more uniformly. The less perforation done on horizontal direction of the sample, the better tensile properties it gains. The less destructing rows made on the samples, the better tensile strength the sample gets. More even and straight fraction surfaces appeared in MD samples, while CD samples also have slant and more layered fraction surfaces. Tensile strength in MD is close to two times higher than CD samples. These results are caused by the orientation of the fibers. The appearance differences between micro-holes of the three materials are quite obvious. For manual made perforated hole, the surface is not smooth enough. For laser made perforation, the paperboard got discoloration due to laser, perforation on uncoated board is more flat, outstanding ring circles appeared on PET and PE boards, and a few bubbles could be seen around the ring circle of PET <b>coated</b> <b>board.</b> The perforation could increase the WVTR of three kinds of boards effectively. The design of patterns and the observation of perforations could give the theoretical reference for manufactures or engineers who wants to apply the laser perforation on composite paperboard...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1997 Zirconium press plates {{have been}} {{developed}} for the production of melamine <b>coated</b> particle <b>board,</b> using shot-peening to achieve the desired plate (and therefore <b>coated</b> particle <b>board)</b> surface texture. Service temperatures of the press plates approach 200 °C. This study examined the microstructural effects of extended exposure of shot-peened zirconium to temperatures of 200 °C and 300 °C. Softening of the surface may reduce wear resistance and possibly the surface morphology of the plate, affecting the usability of the plates. It was discovered that the shot-peened surface of the plates experienced a loss in hardness from approximately 230 VHN (DPH) to about 220 VHN after 560 hrs at 200 °C. The same drop in hardness was experienced after only 5. 5 hrs at 300 °C. This decrease in hardness was determined from hardness profiles before and after heat treating the zirconium to various times from 0. 5 hours to 4458 hrs and 2790 hrs at 200 °C and 300 °C respectively. The decrease in hardness is believed to be a result of static recovery, the annihilation of point and/or line defects and/or alignment of dislocations into relatively low misorientation substantially relatively close to the shot-peened surface (about 35 μm), and decreased more modestly over the next 100 μm until virtually no drop was experienced further than approximately 150 μm from the surface. The shot-peening hardens the surface region which extends about 150 μm from the surface. Thus, the level of recovery appears to depend on the stored energy associated with cold work, or ambient temperature deformation. This increases from about 2 - 3...|$|R

40|$|Smoke {{has long}} been {{recognized}} as the most common source of fire damage to electrical equipment; however, most failures have been analyzed after the fire was out and the smoke vented. The effects caused while the smoke {{is still in the}} air have not been explored. Such effects have implications for new digital equipment being installed in nuclear reactors. The U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission is sponsoring work to determine the impact of smoke on digital instrumentation and control. As part of this program, Sandia National Laboratories has tested simple active circuits to determine how smoke affects them. These tests included the study of three possible failure modes on a functional board: (1) circuit bridging, (2) corrosion (metal loss), and (3) induction of stray capacitance. The performance of nine different circuits was measured continuously on bare and conformably <b>coated</b> <b>boards</b> during smoke exposures lasting 1 hour each and continued for 24 hours after the exposure started. The circuit that was most affected by smoke (100 % change in measured values) was the one most sensitive to circuit bridging. Its high impedance (50 M{Omega}) was shorted during the exposure, but in some cases recovered after the smoke was vented. The other two failure modes, corrosion and induced stray capacitance, caused little change in the function of the circuits. The smoke permanently increased resistance of the circuit tested for corrosion, implying that the cent acts were corroded. However, the change was very small (< 2 %). The stray-capacitance test circuit showed very little change after a smoke exposure in either the short or long term. The results of the tests suggest that conformal coatings and type of circuit are major considerations when designing digital circuitry to be used in critical control systems...|$|R
