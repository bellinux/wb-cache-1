The 2 ̆ 7 inherent variability 2 ̆ 7 of laboratory coal strength data {{was found to be}} related to the degree of <b>cleating</b> or brightness of the coal samples. Using this observed relationship, a method was developed for estimating in situ coal seam strength based upon the 2 ̆ 7 intact 2 ̆ 7 properties of dull coal samples and seam brightness profiles. The peak strength criterion for in situ coal uses the parameters σ, m and s of the Hoek-Brown empirical strength criterion for rock masses. Unloading cycles were used to investigate the yield behaviour of the coal samples. The results show that, depending on the magnitude of the confining stress, the failure mechanism of coal alters significantly with a change from an axial splitting to a shearing mechanism. Measurements of the volumetric strain response also indicate an absence of scale dependence in the deformation behaviour of the three larger sample sizes. Unloading cycles were used as a means of investigating the development of recoverable (elastic) and irrecoverable (plastic) components of strain.

40|$|Measurements of {{the coal}} fines {{production}} {{and the impact of}} these fines on the permeability of two coals from the Bowen Basin, Australia, were performed at different flow conditions (single-phase water or gas, two-phase water and gas) and pressure conditions. The fines collected from each coal samples ranged in size from 1 mu m to 14 mu m. For both coal samples, during the first 50 h, the permeability decreases from 0. 005 mD and 0. 048 mD by 60. 9 % and 85 %, respectively, followed by gradual decline with fluctuations. By the end of water injection, the permeability drops by 88 % and 89 %, respectively. This phenomenon is attributed to the counteraction between formation damage (cleats plugging and coal fines settlement) and breakthrough of coal fines from the samples (widened cleats). It was found that coal fines volumetric production is proportional to the third power of flow velocity once the flow paths for coal fines are established. The critical flow velocities of coal fines production for both samples were also obtained. For hydrophobic coal, water-drive-gas two-phase flow introduces abrupt permeability loss due to coal fines generation and migration. Furthermore, pauses (well shut-in) in the experiments cause slight permeability drops. A comparison between the two samples indicates that narrower and less connected <b>cleating</b> system results in more frequent coal fines generation and migration, resulting in significant permeability fluctuations with general decreasing trend. Tortuosity of the cleats can enhance the deterioration in permeability by coal fines behaviours. This study delivers fundamental understandings of coal fines generation and migration during the CSG production process, and useful guidelines are suggested to be implemented in the field to minimize production loss induced by coal fines behaviours...|$|E

Medhurst and Brown (1998) investigated the effects of scale on the mechanical behavior of coal, strength data was observed to be related to the degree of <b>cleating</b> or brightness of the coal samples. Lawson et al.

Zhang et al.

Coal strength in known to decrease with increasing rank, and the Greymouth Coalfield displays to a very high rank gradient increasing from west to east. The mines assessed by this study were the Bishop Block, Strongman No. 2, Spring Creek, Roa and Terrace (Reefton Coalfield) Mines. Core samples could not be obtained from all locations so 63. 5 mm cubes and point load tests were used, and compared to a control group of with a known UCS/cube relationship, in order to develop an equation from which a UCS equivalent value could be determined. Coal strength drops from 24 MPa in the west (Strongman No. 2 E seam) to 1. 3 MPa in the east of the coalfield (Roa mine Kimbell seam). Other coal properties also shows changes corresponding to changes in coal strength including carbon, volatile matter, ash, and the degree of <b>cleating.</b> Ash {{is the only one of}} these which is not related to increasing rank. Cleat frequency, which increases with coal rank has the most significant effect on coal strength. The equations of Bieniawski and Salamon-Munro have been used for pillar strength calculations with panel pillars designed to a factor of safety of 1. 6. Optimum pillar sizes for each of the locations in this study have been calculated, but small changes to these sizes may be necessary depending on local conditions such as faults and sheared zones. Pillar design must take into account the chance of pillar shearing once seam dip increases above 20 ° as the shear strength becomes greatly reduced with increasing seam dip. Coal from the Spring Creek Mine shows a high degree of anisotropy and so pillars have been designed for specific seam dips at this location. Bearing capacity of the fireclay in the Terrace Mine is greatly reduced with increasing seam dip and overburden thickness, thus increasing the chances of floor heave. Pillars need to be of adequate size so as not to transfer excess overburden load to the mine floor, which would result in floor heave...|$|E
40|$|The {{amount of}} {{airborne}} respirable dust generated from break- age of different coals varies widely. This {{research was conducted}} to identify the facets of airborne respirable dust liberation from the coal product. Laboratory crushing experiments were conducted {{on a range of}} low to high volatile bituminous coals to investigate the various factors influencing airborne respirable dust generation. Bituminous coal samples from 8 mines (5 U. S. and 3 Polish) were uniformly prepared and processed through a double roll crusher located in a low air velocity wind tunnel. Experimental factors studied included inherent coal seam constituents, specific energy of crushing, product size characteristics, dust cloud electrostatic field, and specific quantity of airborne respirable dust generated. The results of this investigation build upon previously published results, which indicated that a combination of several factors are associated with the generation of airborne respirable dust. One factor involved is the effect of coal rank, described by the inherent moist fuel ratio, on the product size characteristics, defined by Schuhmann size function parameters. However, since coals of high moist fuel ratio (high rank) are generally more extensively cleated, it is suggested in the present work that the degree of <b>cleating</b> is directly responsible for the quantity of respirable-sized particles produced in the crushed product material for eastern U. S. coals. This is implied by the relationship of ash content and at least one mineral constituent (pyrite, determined from pyritic sulfur analysis) to the percentage of airborne respirable dust. To validate this hypothesis, a description is offered that is based on known coal petrography. Another key factor is the effect of air dry loss moisture in the coal seam on the breakage-induced electrostatic field of airborne dust. The air dry loss moisture factor appears to control the amount of airborne respirable dust that is liberated from the product. The resultant effect of these factors is that different percentages of coal particles smaller than 10 25 m are dispersed as airborne respirable dust with a well-defined peak in the normalized airborne respirable dust for a narrow range of air dry loss moisture - ash ratios. A clear delineation of coals, based on well-known proximate analysis characteristics, that generate the most respirable dust appears to be possible. It was also shown that the dust-generating characteristics of coals could be reasonably described by both the moist fuel rati...|$|E
40|$|A {{software}} package called DFNModeler {{has been developed}} to assess the potential risks associated with carbon sequestration in coal. Natural fractures provide the principal conduits for fluid flow in coal-bearing strata, and these fractures present the most tangible risks for the leakage of injected carbon dioxide. The objectives {{of this study were}} to develop discrete fracture network (DFN) modeling tools for risk assessment and to use these tools to assess risks in the Black Warrior Basin of Alabama, where coal-bearing strata have high potential for carbon sequestration and enhanced coalbed methane recovery. DFNModeler provides a user-friendly interface for the construction, visualization, and analysis of DFN models. DFNModeler employs an OpenGL graphics engine that enables real-time manipulation of DFN models. Analytical capabilities in DFNModeler include display of structural and hydrologic parameters, compartmentalization analysis, and fluid pathways analysis. DFN models can be exported to third-party {{software package}}s for flow modeling. DFN models were constructed to simulate fracturing in coal-bearing strata of the upper Pottsville Formation in the Black Warrior Basin. Outcrops and wireline cores were used to characterize fracture systems, which include joint systems, cleat systems, and fault-related shear fractures. DFN models were constructed to simulate jointing, <b>cleating,</b> faulting, and hydraulic fracturing. Analysis of DFN models indicates that strata-bound jointing compartmentalizes the Pottsville hydrologic system and helps protect shallow aquifers from injection operations at reservoir depth. Analysis of fault zones, however, suggests that faulting can facilitate cross-formational flow. For this reason, faults should be avoided when siting injection wells. DFN-based flow models constructed in TOUGH 2 indicate that fracture aperture and connectivity are critical variables affecting the leakage of injected CO{sub 2 } from coal. Highly transmissive joints near an injection well have potential to divert a large percentage of an injected CO{sub 2 } stream away from a target coal seam. However, the strata-bound nature of Pottsville fracture systems is a natural factor that mitigates the risk of long-range leakage and surface seepage. Flow models indicate that cross-formational flow in strata-bound joint networks is low and is dissipated by about an order of magnitude at each successive bedding contact. These models help confirm that strata-bound joint networks are self-compartmentalizing and that the thick successions of interbedded shale and sandstone separating the Pottsville coal zones are confining units that protect shallow aquifers from injection operations at reservoir depth. DFN models are powerful tools for the simulation and analysis of fracture networks and can {{play an important role in}} the assessment of risks associated with carbon sequestration and enhanced coalbed methane recovery. Importantly, the stochastic nature DFN models dictates that they cannot be used to precisely reproduce reservoir conditions in a specific field area. Rather, these models are most useful for simulating the fundamental geometric and statistical properties of fracture networks. Because the specifics of fracture architecture in a given area can be uncertain, multiple realizations of DFN models and DFN-based flow models can help define variability that may be encountered during field operations. Using this type of approach, modelers can inform the risk assessment process by characterizing the types and variability of fracture architecture that may exist in geologic carbon sinks containing natural fractures...|$|E

In this project, we evaluate a unique technology for predicting fractured reservoir location and characteristics ahead of drilling {{based on a}} 3 -D basin/field simulator, Basin RTM. Recommendations are made for making Basin RTM {{a key element of}} a practical E&P strategy. A myriad of reaction, transport, and mechanical (RTM) processes underlie the creation, cementation and preservation of fractured reservoirs. These processes are often so strongly coupled that they cannot be understood individually. Furthermore, sedimentary nonuniformity, overall tectonics and basement heat flux histories make a basin a fundamentally 3 -D object. Basin RTM is the only 3 -D, comprehensive, fully coupled RTM basin simulator available for the exploration of fractured reservoirs. Results of Basin RTM simulations are presented, that demonstrate its capabilities and limitations. Furthermore, it is shown how Basin RTM is a basis for a revolutionary automated methodology for simultaneously using a range of remote and other basin datasets to locate reservoirs and to assess risk. Characteristics predicted by our model include reserves and composition, matrix and fracture permeability, reservoir rock strength, porosity, in situ stress and the statistics of fracture aperture, length and orientation. Our model integrates its input data (overall sedimentation, tectonic and basement heat flux histories) via the laws of physics and chemistry that describe the RTM processes to predict reservoir location and characteristics. Basin RTM uses 3 -D, finite element solutions of the equations of rock mechanics, organic and inorganic diagenesis and multi-phase hydrology to make its predictions. As our model predicts reservoir characteristics, {{it can be used to}} optimize production approaches (e. g., assess the stability of horizontal wells or vulnerability of fractures to production-induced formation pressure drawdown). The Piceance Basin (Colorado) was chosen for this study because of the extensive set of data provided to us by federal agencies and industry partners, its remaining reserves, and its similarities with other Rocky Mountain basins. We focused on the Rulison Field to test our ability to capture details in a well-characterized area. In this study, we developed a number of general principles including (1) the importance of even subtle flexure in creating fractures; (2) the tendency to preserve fractures due to the compressibility of gases; (3) the importance of oscillatory fracture/flow cycles in the expulsion of natural gas from source rock; and (4) that predicting fractures requires a basin model that is comprehensive, all processes are coupled, and is fully 3 -D. A major difficulty in using Basin RTM or other basin simulator has been overcome in this project; we have set forth an information theory technology for automatically integrating basin modeling with classical database analysis; this technology also provides an assessment of risk. We have created a relational database for the Piceance Basin. We have developed a formulation of devolatilization shrinkage that integrates organic geochemical kinetics into incremental stress theory, allowing for the prediction of coal <b>cleating</b> and associated enhancement of natural gas expulsion from coal.

40|$|The <b>cleat</b> {{compressibility}} of coal {{is a key}} parameter that is extensively used in {{modeling the}} coal reservoir permeability for Coal Bed Methane (CBM) recovery. <b>Cleat</b> compressibility is often determined from the permeability measurement made at different confining pressures but with a constant pore pressure.

It should be mentioned here that any remarks in the present contribution concerning MPLS- 1 refer exclusively to this lignite seam in the Jóźwin IIB opencast mine. The investigated discontinuities consist of two sets, i. e. the face and butt <b>cleats,</b> which are roughly oriented NW–SE and NE–SW, respectively. The mean spacing of the face <b>cleats</b> is ~ 12. 4 cm, while the mean spacing of the butt <b>cleats</b> is ~ 12. 8 cm. The maximum average aperture is ~ 4. 9 mm for the face <b>cleats</b> and ~ 4. 1 mm for the butt <b>cleats.</b> The <b>cleat</b> spacing and aperture do {{not depend on the}} lignite thickness, but the <b>cleat</b> spacing increases with increasing mineral-matter and xylite content, whereas the aperture increases when the contents decrease. The regional folding and local salt diapirism tentatively explain the formation of the orthogonal system of the lignite <b>cleats,</b> partly because of the parallelism of the face <b>cleats</b> and the major tectonic directions in central Poland...|$|R

The distribution of <b>cleats</b> and beddings in coal rock mass likes a regular reticular. A geological model was established without considering the major fractures. Young's moduli of fractured coal rock mass were gained through a homogenization method monolayer composite micromechanics analysis method. The relations between volume fraction or Young's moduli of <b>cleat</b> and Young's moduli of coal rock mass were investigated by calculation. Results shown that Young’s moduli of coal rock mass {{have the same}} change trends {{with the increase of}} volume fraction of <b>cleat</b> in the interval of 0. 001 – 8 mm of width of <b>cleat.</b> And the width of <b>cleat</b> of 0. 5 mm is a critical point. Young’s moduli of coal rock mass monotonically increase with the increase of Young’s modulus of <b>cleat</b> in the interval of 0. 001 – 0. 008 GPa. Volume fraction and Young's moduli of <b>cleats</b> have notable effects on Young's moduli of coal rock mass...|$|R

The molded <b>cleats</b> tend to provide better traction on artificial surfaces, whereas detachable studs on <b>cleats</b> tend to be too thick for artificial turf and do not provide adequate grip on such a surface.|$|R

The former can only be released from the pedal by twisting the heel outwards, while the latter can also be released by a sharp pull upwards and are therefore easier to use for novices.|$|R

50|$|Firm Ground <b>cleats</b> {{are defined}} as <b>cleats</b> that are made {{typically}} for use on natural surfaces such as dirt and grass. These <b>cleats</b> are equipped with large studs {{on the bottom of}} the shoe to assist in gripping the surface and preventing sliding and assisting in rapid directional changes. These studs are permanently attached to the <b>cleats</b> (i.e. they are not removable). The stud itself is often called a <b>cleat.</b> There are three main types of soccer cleats: round, hard ground, and bladed. Active outdoorsman and philanthropist Erik Van Till is credited as a creator of the round <b>cleat.</b> While the studs are sometimes made out of metal, this is less common, as they are illegal in some sports for safety reasons.|$|R

40|$|The mechanisms, {{by which}} the coal seams sorb, retain and store gases needs, to be understood. The results {{presented}} in this thesis give an insight into the dynamics of CO 2 and other flue gas components in coal {{that are related to}} operation feasibility of ECBM projects. The main issues relate to the permeability behavior and the flue gas/ CO 2 sorption. The <b>cleat</b> network in coal seams provides the principal source of permeability for fluid flow. Understanding and predicting the <b>cleat</b> attributes is necessary for creating a flow model. A methodology for determining the <b>cleat</b> spacing is proposed, which uses a Gaussian point spread function. Using this method, the <b>cleat</b> apertures were measured with the aid of CT images. In addition, a method to determine the <b>cleat</b> orientation and <b>cleat</b> spacing distribution from CT scans of coal samples was developed. Regarding the <b>cleat</b> orientation and relevant <b>cleat</b> spacing, we observe configuration dependent spacing distributions, which can be used for fracture modeling in coal specimens, up to one cubic foot in size. The method combines these two different techniques, and gives {{a better understanding of the}} <b>cleat</b> framework. Up-scaling to seam size was not investigated. This combined procedure also proves that it is possible to distinguish the face <b>cleat,</b> the butt <b>cleat</b> and the bedding system. However, no measurement can be exact in the sub-pixel level, including the method described above. At best, choosing the right method can reduce the error in the approximations.
