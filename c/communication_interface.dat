25|$|The Malaysian Army {{currently}} has a soldier modernisation programme called the Future Soldier System. Under the FSS, The Malaysian Army plans to equip all soldiers with Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) such as Kevlar helmets, Kevlar vests, Oakley goggles and ear protection equipment. The programme also includes arming all the standard issue M4 carbines with SOPMOD kits, {{as well as}} equipping soldiers with a Glock series pistol. Sapura, a Malaysian electronics company, is offering their SAKTI soldier system concept via work in three areas: Head Sub-System (HSS), Body Sub-System (BSS) and Weapon Sub-System (WSS). The HSS consists of a Helmet–Mounted Micro Camera and night vision capability with a data output, helmet-mounted display and earpiece and microphone; the WSS consists of a Rifle Control Unit consisting of a five-button wireless controller for one handed use with key features including push to talk for the radio, switching the HMD on and off, turning the HMD brightness {{up and down as}} well as video transmission to friendly forces. The BSS consists of a controller system, energy unit with a power pack for the <b>communication</b> <b>interface,</b> micro-camera and HMD with a single polymer lithium ion battery for up to ten hours of operation; a communications interface for secure IP based radio which from the image is a Thales St@rmille radio and finally a navigation unit with a display for blue force tracking and situational awareness, colour digital mapping and terrain and urban profile analysis. The system displayed is visually similar to the Kord Defence SmartGrip RIC developed in partnership with Thales Australia.|$|E

It is possible to establish ad-hoc chat rooms separate from the public-access ones. Guilds are permanent, exclusive chat rooms for members.

40|$|Abstract—Intelligence on mobile threats is a {{valuable}} asset. Honeypots showed to provide a good resource to gain threat intelligence in other areas. Unfortunately, current malware largely relies on social engineering to infect smartphones. Recently, attacks against smartphones have shifted towards local <b>communication</b> <b>interfaces.</b> These trends make traditional honeypot concepts unsuitable. We propose a novel concept called nomadic honeypot that provides an infrastructure to enable mobile network operators to collect threat intelligence directly on smartphones. We present a practical design that confines the mobile operating system in a virtual machine. Through virtualization all <b>communication</b> <b>interfaces</b> can be monitored. The actual monitoring is carried out by a second virtual machine running on the same device. This machine hosts sensors and provides a secure backchannel for the operator...|$|R
