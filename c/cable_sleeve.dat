50|$|For {{power cables}} the term cable {{termination}} station is not strictly determined. It is either {{the point where}} the underwater cable ends and where the overhead powerline starts or if the whole line is implemented as cable, the first <b>cable</b> <b>sleeve</b> on the land. However one can also say that the substation or HVDC static inverter plant, where the connection to the grid is made describe as cable termination station. However, this station can be far away from the coast.|$|E
50|$|Bowden cables can {{cease to}} {{function}} smoothly, particularly if water or contaminants {{get into the}} housing. (Modern lined and stainless steel cables are less prone to these problems; unlined housings should be lubricated with a light machine oil.) In cold climates Bowden cable mechanisms are prone to malfunction due to water freezing. Cables also wear through use over a long time, and can be damaged through kinking or raveling. A common failure occurs on bicycles {{at the point where}} the housing enters a barrel adjuster; loose housing ends tend to fray the housing, making adjustments uncertain. Fraying due to fatigue is most likely if the cable passes over a pulley, which on bicycles is often below the recommended diameter, or where the cable is bent repeatedly where it attaches to the brake lever or caliper. A cable passing around a sharp bend tend to furrow the inner <b>cable</b> <b>sleeve,</b> leading to contact with the outer housing and rub fraying. A frayed cable can suddenly break when force is applied strongly, e.g. during emergency braking.|$|E

50|$|A cable harness, {{also known}} as a wire harness, cable {{assembly}}, wiring assembly or wiring loom, is an assembly of electrical cables or wires which transmit signals or electrical power. The cables are bound together by straps, cable ties, <b>cable</b> lacing, <b>sleeves,</b> electrical tape, conduit, a weave of extruded string, or a combination thereof.|$|R

40|$|Nicopress <b>cable</b> <b>sleeves</b> {{are one of}} the {{fundamental}} tools of our trade and a critical element of almost every system we install. It is important that installers know how to use these tools and gauges properly, and equally important that we understand the swaging process and how to use the gauges required to inspect their work. The following is a brief description of how to use the Nicopress documentation and gauges to inspect newly installed swages in the field. Important Note: This is designed to be a summary and guide for use of the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. For specific information regarding this topic {{it is important that the}} reader review the Nicopress documents. The references for this paper are listed on the last page. To be installed correctly, a Nicopress swage must include the following: 1. The correct <b>sleeve</b> for the <b>cable</b> and application. 2. The correct tool for the sleeve. 3. The correct groove in the tool. 4. The correct number of presses for the tool/groove combination. 5. The correct gauge for the tool 6. The correct arrangement of the fittings and proper inspection after crimping...|$|R
40|$|This {{project is}} geared towards the {{redesign}} {{and implementation of}} a crimping tool {{for use in the}} manufacturing of catheters produced by Medtronic Inc. Catheters require two steering cables to maneuver the end of the catheter through the body. The steering <b>cables</b> have a <b>sleeve</b> that is crimped onto their end in order to hold the cable in place inside the catheter steering handle. The current crimping tool, designed by Astro Tool Corp, has a few problems associated with its design. Additionally we are {{trying to get rid of}} a step in the manufacturing process that involves the adhesive, cyanoacrylate, being placed inside the sleeve to be crimped. The cyanoacrylate is added to increase the strength of the crimp from three to four pounds of force in shear to around eighteen pounds. However to simplify the manufacturing process we will need to come up with a crimp style for our device that will increase the allowable axial force to eighteen pounds with a metal to metal crimp alone and eliminate the need for an adhesive. The redesigned crimping tool will need high tolerance fit for each crimp as well as a repeatability of crimps for each cycle...|$|R
40|$|A tool {{makes it}} {{possible}} to couple a torque wrench to an externally knurled, internally threaded, round cable connector. The purpose served by the tool is to facilitate the tightening of multiple such connectors (or the repeated tightening of the same connector) to repeatable torques. The design of a prior cable-connector/ torque-wrench coupling tool provided for application of the torque-wrench jaws to a location laterally offset from the axis of rotation of the cable connector, making it necessary to correct the torque reading for the offset. Unlike the design of the prior tool, the design of the present tool provides for application of the torque-wrench jaws to a location on the axis of rotation, obviating correction of the torque reading for offset. The present tool (see figure) consists of a split collet containing a slot that provides clearance for inserting and bending the <b>cable,</b> a collet-locking <b>sleeve,</b> a collet-locking nut, and a torque-wrench adaptor that is press-fit onto the collet. Once the collet is positioned on the cable connector, the collet-locking nut is turned to force the collet-locking sleeve over the collet, compressing the collet through engagement of tapered surfaces {{on the outside of the}} collet and the inside of the locking sleeve. Because the collet is split and therefore somewhat flexible, this compression forces the collet inward to grip the connector securely. The torque wrench is then applied to the torque-wrench adaptor in the usual manner for torquing a nut or a bolt...|$|R
