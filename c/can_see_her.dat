5|$|Numerous works, {{from the}} ancient to the baroque, have been cited as sources of {{inspiration}} for Velázquez. The nude Venuses of the Italian painters, such as Giorgione's Sleeping Venus (c. 1510) and Titian's Venus of Urbino (1538), were the main precedents. In this work, Velázquez combined two established poses for Venus: recumbent on a couch or a bed, and gazing at a mirror. She {{is often described as}} looking at herself on the mirror, although this is physically impossible since viewers <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> face reflected in their direction. This phenomenon is known as the Venus effect. In a number of ways the painting represents a pictorial departure, through its central use of a mirror, and because it shows the body of Venus turned away from the observer of the painting.|$|E
5|$|Teenager Billy Duncan {{wakes up}} in his bed, {{seemingly}} disturbed, and learns his mother is leaving for vacation. He goes to visit his girlfriend Kathy, but her deranged grandfather Colonel Farley makes him leave before he <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>her.</b> As Billy drives around town, he is harassed by bullies Chuck Boran and Froggy, and by two police deputies who give him a speeding ticket. Billy wanders into the desert and discovers the laser cannon and pendant. He starts playing with the cannon, pretending to shoot things, then realizes he can fire the weapon while wearing the pendant. Meanwhile, on the alien spacecraft, the two aliens converse with their leader who shows them footage of Billy using the cannon, prompting the aliens to turn their ship around {{to head back to}} Earth. Context implies that the two aliens, upon departing Earth, left the cannon and pendant behind under the presumption that no other human would be able to use them as the green-skinned man had, but they have now learned that they were in error.|$|E
25|$|On December 23, 2005, it {{is shown}} (to the audience) that Dixie did indeed survive the {{automobile}} accident that {{was thought to}} have claimed her life {{while she was in}} Europe. Di, the only one who knows that Dixie is alive, goes to visit her, and urges her to return to Pine Valley and let her family know that she is alive. Dixie seems adamant on not taking Di's advice at first, but soon returns to Pine Valley in February 2006. She attends the Mardi Gras ball thrown by Erica Kane. Because her face is hidden by a mask, no one from her family recognizes her. She does, however, witness a tender moment between Tad and Di, as well as JR and Babe. Janet Dillon rigs the hot water heater at the mansion where the ball is being held so that it will explode. When it does, many people die and are injured and Dixie is trapped by some rubble. She manages to escape without being discovered by anyone. She goes to Wildwind, where Di is staying. In the middle of confronting her sister, Tad arrives and Dixie runs off before he <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>her.</b> Later, she runs into Zach Slater, and he promises not to reveal {{the fact that she is}} still alive. Later, she secretly watches in horror as her son holds a gun to Krystal Carey at a cabin, demanding to know where his ex-wife, Babe, has taken their son. Dixie hides as Tad arrives and tries to wrestle the gun away from JR, but the gun goes off and hits Dixie (who is outside) in the arm. It is soon revealed that Tad and Dixie's baby, Kate, is in fact alive, but was taken by Dr. Greg Madden, a famous surgeon who is hated by virtually everyone in Pine Valley. A few months earlier, Tad had informed Erica that Greg stole her baby, the one she aborted twenty-something years ago, and Erica's son is also alive, going by the name Josh Madden.|$|E

Lois attempts to overlook the evidence, and instead tries to persuade Peter not to encourage people to be fat.

The beautiful Musidora strips naked to cool down by bathing in the stream, not knowing that Damon <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>her.</b> Damon is torn between his desire to watch her and the [...] "delicate refinement" [...] of knowing he should avert his gaze. Damon decides to respect her modesty and leaves {{a note on the}} riverbank reading [...] "Bathe on, my fair,/ Yet unbeheld save by the sacred eye/ Of faithful love: I go to guard thy haunt;/ To keep from thy recess each vagrant foot/ And each licentious eye". Musidora sees the paper and panics, but on reading it and realising that it has been written by Damon, feels admiration for his behaviour as well as a surge of pride that her own beauty can provoke such a reaction. She leaves him a note in turn, reading [...] "Dear youth! sole judge of what these verses mean,/ By fortune too much favoured, but by love,/ Alas! not favoured less, be still as now/ Discreet: the time may come you need not fly." ...|$|E

The poem describes a visit to a brothel by a man called [...] "Tomalin"; he is searching for his sweetheart, Francis, who has become a prostitute.

2500|$|In 2010, Keaton starred {{alongside}} Rachel McAdams and Harrison Ford in Roger Michell's comedy Morning Glory, {{playing the}} veteran TV {{host of a}} fictional morning talk show that desperately needs to boost its lagging ratings.

[...] Inspired by Neil Simon's 1972 Broadway play The Sunshine Boys, the film became a moderate success at the box office for a worldwide total of almost US$59million. Though some critics found that Keaton was underused in the film, the actress was generally praised for her performance, with James Berardinelli of ReelViews noting that [...] "Diane Keaton is so good at her part that one <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> sliding effortlessly into an anchor's chair on a real morning show." ...|$|E

2500|$|While Cassie and Thelma strategize, new {{characters}} are introduced {{at the school}} while old ones depart.

2500|$|This is {{represented}} by the show's promotional tagline, [...] "Small town Canada with a little Muslim twist": the religious angle, while always present, is largely tied to and sometimes even secondary to standard and universal sitcom themes such as family, friends and the humour in everyday life. For example, while the show sometimes tackles storylines with a political edge, such as a character claiming to be unable to attend a conference in the United States because he says he was wrongly placed on a no-fly list (when in fact he is simply afraid of flying) or the mosque being raided by the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, even these situations are explored as much for their humour as their politics. The show much more commonly explores purely comedic issues such as whether a Muslim woman still has to cover her hair if the only man who <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> is gay, whether Muslims can curl, whether to haggle with the carpet salesman when buying a prayer rug, or whether a Muslim woman's head scarf is enough to mitigate a bad hair day. Television critics have also credited this very combination of an attention-grabbing premise with conventional and familiar sitcom themes as one of the primary reasons that the show successfully retained an audience after its debut.|$|E

There she sees a beautiful oval mirror, which she is given as a gift by the elderly owner of the shop [...] who comments that the mirror is meant for her. Jo is delighted, and the mirror is placed in her bedroom. That night, Jo is stunned to see the image of another girl in the mirror, instead of her own reflection, and {{it is obvious that}} the other girl, Louisa Iredale (also fourteen years old), <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> just as clearly. Louisa is able to 'introduce' herself to Jo by writing her name on a book for Jo to read. However, when Jo tries to write her name on the mirror to introduce herself to Louisa, she is startled when the pen begins to disappear into the mirror. After Louisa is called away to dinner, Jo investigates the mystery and is accidentally pulled through the mirror into Louisa's bedroom in 1919. This leads to the discovery, by Jo and Louisa, that they can visit each other's times, through the mirror, any time they want to do so [...] provided that the mirror is situated in exactly the same place and that the mirror's alignment and orientation are identical within the mirror's frame, at corresponding moments in 1919 and 1995.|$|E

Although she is mentioned frequently in the early episodes of Season 7 and then mocked by Joan in Season 8, Toni does not appear in Seasons 7 or 8 (due to Jones' departure).|$|E
