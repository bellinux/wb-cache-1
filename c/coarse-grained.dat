5|$|The predominate rock type is a white, <b>coarse-grained,</b> foliated {{hornblende}} tonalite. Minerals in the tonalite are quartz, plagioclase, alkali feldspar and hornblende.|$|E
5|$|Rock {{samples from}} Pedra Branca, Middle Rocks and South Ledge show {{they are all}} {{composed}} of a light, <b>coarse-grained</b> biotite granite. Therefore, from a geomorphological standpoint, the three maritime features {{belong to the same}} rock body.|$|E
5|$|All {{specimens}} discovered until 1967 were in <b>coarse-grained</b> sandstone {{that prevented}} preservation of fine details, making interpretation difficult. S.B. Misra's discovery of fossiliferous ash-beds at the Mistaken Point assemblage in Newfoundland changed all {{this as the}} delicate detail preserved by the fine ash allowed the description of features that were previously undiscernible.|$|E
5|$|Applications {{are often}} {{classified}} {{according to how}} often their subtasks need to synchronize or communicate with each other. An application exhibits fine-grained parallelism if its subtasks must communicate many times per second; it exhibits <b>coarse-grained</b> parallelism {{if they do not}} communicate many times per second, and it exhibits embarrassing parallelism if they rarely or never have to communicate. Embarrassingly parallel applications are considered the easiest to parallelize.|$|E
5|$|Nankoweap Formation {{is around}} 1050million {{years old and}} {{is not part of}} a group. This rock unit is made of <b>coarse-grained</b> sandstone, and was {{deposited}} in a shallow sea on top of the eroded surface of the Cardenas Basalt. The Nankoweap is only exposed {{in the eastern part of}} the canyon. A gap in the geologic record, an unconformity, follows the Nankoweap.|$|E
5|$|Rocks sampled in the {{immediate}} vicinity of the Lunar Module are mostly vesicular <b>coarse-grained</b> subfloor basalt, with some appearance of fine-grained basalt as well. Much of the valley floor, as displayed in observations of {{the immediate}} landing area, is predominately regolith and fragments varying in sizes excavated by several impacts in the Moon's history.|$|E
5|$|The red-hued {{heartwood}} is <b>coarse-grained</b> and soft. It {{is sometimes}} used for turning, but requires careful drying before use to avoid warping. A sample was prepared in Victoria in 1885 {{as part of}} a collection of local timber species under the direction of Government botanist Ferdinand von Mueller. The collection was displayed in various exhibitions, including the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1889, and is housed at the Melbourne Museum.|$|E
5|$|Troctolite 76535, a <b>coarse-grained</b> troctolite {{composed}} {{primarily of}} olivine and plagioclase was recovered {{in the valley}} {{as part of a}} rake sample. The sample has been called the most interesting to be returned from the Moon. This sample {{has been the subject of}} thermochronological calculations in order to determine whether the Moon ever generated a core dynamo or formed a metallic core.|$|E
5|$|Peat {{is found}} in thick, {{plentiful}} layers across the Pennines and Scottish Borders, {{and there are many}} large coalfields, including the Great Northern, Lancashire and South Yorkshire Coalfields. Millstone grit, a distinctive <b>coarse-grained</b> rock used to make millstones, is widespread in the Pennines, and the variety of other rock types is reflected in the architecture of the region, such as the bright red sandstone seen in buildings in Chester, the cream-buff Yorkstone and the distinctive purple Doddington sandstone. These sandstones also mean that apart from the east coast, most of Northern England has very soft water, and this has influenced not just industry, but even the blends of tea enjoyed in the region.|$|E
5|$|Cores {{are often}} drilled {{in areas such}} as Antarctica and central Greenland where the {{temperature}} is almost never warm enough to cause melting, but the summer sun can still alter the snow. In polar areas, the sun is visible day and night during the local summer and invisible all winter. It can make some snow sublimate, leaving the top inch or so less dense. When the sun approaches its lowest point in the sky, the temperature drops and hoar frost forms on the top layer. Buried under the snow of following years, the <b>coarse-grained</b> hoar frost compresses into lighter layers than the winter snow. As a result, alternating bands of lighter and darker ice can be seen in an ice core.|$|E
5|$|Protein folding {{does not}} occur in one step. Instead, {{proteins}} {{spend most of their}} folding time, nearly 96% in some cases, waiting in various intermediate conformational states, each a local thermodynamic free energy minimum in the protein's energy landscape. Through a process known as adaptive sampling, these conformations are used by Folding@home as starting points for a set of simulation trajectories. As the simulations discover more conformations, the trajectories are restarted from them, and a Markov state model (MSM) is gradually created from this cyclic process. MSMs are discrete-time master equation models which describe a biomolecule's conformational and energy landscape as a set of distinct structures and the short transitions between them. The adaptive sampling Markov state model method significantly increases the efficiency of simulation as it avoids computation inside the local energy minimum itself, and is amenable to distributed computing (including on GPUGRID) as it allows for the statistical aggregation of short, independent simulation trajectories. The amount of time it takes to construct a Markov state model is inversely proportional to the number of parallel simulations run, i.e., the number of processors available. In other words, it achieves linear parallelization, leading to an approximately four orders of magnitude reduction in overall serial calculation time. A completed MSM may contain tens of thousands of sample states from the protein's phase space (all the conformations a protein can take on) and the transitions between them. The model illustrates folding events and pathways (i.e., routes) and researchers can later use kinetic clustering to view a <b>coarse-grained</b> representation of the otherwise highly detailed model. They can use these MSMs to reveal how proteins misfold and to quantitatively compare simulations with experiments.|$|E
25|$|<b>Coarse-grained</b> models. One- and two-site {{models of}} water {{have also been}} developed. In coarse-grain models, each site can {{represent}} several water molecules.|$|E
25|$|The {{parameterization}} {{of these}} very <b>coarse-grained</b> models must be done empirically, by matching {{the behavior of the}} model to appropriate experimental data or all-atom simulations. Ideally, these parameters should account for both enthalpic and entropic contributions to free energy in an implicit way. When coarse-graining is done at higher levels, the accuracy of the dynamic description may be less reliable. But very <b>coarse-grained</b> models have been used successfully to examine a wide range of questions in structural biology, liquid crystal organization, and polymer glasses.|$|E
25|$|Early Archean rocks {{generally}} form elongate, domal or circular {{bodies that}} are several kilometers thick. Late-stage dikes and sills of diabase, quartz-feldspar fine-grained instrusive rocks (aplite) and quartz-feldspar-mica <b>coarse-grained</b> intrusive rocks (pegmatite) are common.|$|E
25|$|The sort {{operation}} transforms an {{unordered set}} of elements into an ordered set of elements. The most common implementation on GPUs is using radix sort for integer and floating point data and <b>coarse-grained</b> merge sort and fine-grained sorting networks for general comparable data.|$|E
25|$|Because lava usually cools and {{crystallizes}} rapidly, it {{is usually}} fine-grained. If the cooling has been so rapid as to prevent the formation of even small crystals after extrusion, the resulting rock may be mostly glass (such as the rock obsidian). If the cooling of the lava happened more slowly, the rock would be <b>coarse-grained.</b>|$|E
25|$|Another common {{sport in}} Malta {{is a local}} variety of the game of bocce or boules (Maltese: boċċi). In Malta, {{the game is played}} on a smooth surface covered with <b>coarse-grained</b> sand, with teams of three players. Boċċi clubs are common {{throughout}} Malta, but also among the Maltese emigrant communities in Australia, Canada and the United States.|$|E
25|$|Intrusive {{igneous rocks}} that form at depth within the crust are termed {{plutonic}} (or abyssal) rocks {{and are usually}} <b>coarse-grained.</b> Intrusive igneous rocks that form near the surface are termed subvolcanic or hypabyssal rocks and they are usually medium-grained. Hypabyssal rocks are less common than plutonic or volcanic rocks and often form dikes, sills, laccoliths, lopoliths, or phacoliths.|$|E
25|$|El Capitan is {{composed}} {{almost entirely of}} granite, a pale, <b>coarse-grained</b> granite emplaced approximately 100 mya (million years ago). In addition to El Capitan, this granite forms most of the rock features of the western portions of Yosemite Valley. A separate intrusion of igneous rock, the Taft Granite, forms the uppermost portions of the cliff face.|$|E
25|$|The {{zones of}} the Rila {{mountain}} range that {{fall within the}} park are formed mainly by metamorphic rocks— gneiss, biotite gneiss, amphibolite, mica, schist and marble, bordering {{to the north and}} to the east with <b>coarse-grained</b> granite, granite-gneiss, smooth-grained granite and pegmatite veins. The metamorphic mantle has a general inclination to the south-west by the magnitude of 35 to 60°.|$|E
25|$|The wood is soft, <b>coarse-grained,</b> {{and light}} buff in color. Air-dried, a cubic foot weighs 28lbs. The lumber {{is used for}} general {{construction}} and crates. Because of its unusual power of holding spikes, it is also used for railroad ties. Untreated, the wood is not durable if exposed to the elements. As a fuel, it is low in value. The wood is also a source of pulp for paper manufacturing.|$|E
25|$|Wilmslow, Bulkeley Hill and Helsby Sandstone {{formations}} of the Sherwood Sandstone Group {{are present}} within the site, {{dating from the}} Early Triassic period around 250 million years ago. The fine-grained red sandstones which predominate in the lower rock levels represent sedimentation from sandy braided rivers, while the conglomerate beds of Delamere Pebbly Sandstone (a type of Helsby Sandstone formation) which occur in the upper levels represent the deposition of larger particles from <b>coarse-grained</b> braided rivers.|$|E
25|$|Peridotite is a dense, <b>coarse-grained</b> {{igneous rock}} {{consisting}} mostly of the minerals olivine and pyroxene. Peridotite is ultramafic, as the rock contains less than 45% silica. It {{is high in}} magnesium, reflecting the high proportions of magnesium-rich olivine, with appreciable iron. Peridotite {{is derived from the}} Earth's mantle, either as solid blocks and fragments, or as crystals accumulated from magmas that formed in the mantle. The compositions of peridotites from these layered igneous complexes vary widely, reflecting the relative proportions of pyroxenes, chromite, plagioclase, and amphibole.|$|E
25|$|The {{importance}} of the flint assemblage of Happisburgh {{is not just to}} the understanding the prehistory of Norfolk, but to the understanding of prehistoric Europe. This is due to the first mentioned hand axe in the assemblage. The hand axe is an ovate handaxe made from black flint with pale grey <b>coarse-grained</b> inclusions, one face carries two small areas of pebble cortex, and is in near perfect condition. This handaxe {{is believed to be the}} earliest tool yet found in Europe; it was probably used as a knife for cutting up carcasses.|$|E
25|$|Intrusive {{igneous rocks}} are formed from magma that cools and solidifies within the crust of a planet, {{surrounded}} by pre-existing rock (called country rock); the magma cools slowly and, as a result, these rocks are <b>coarse-grained.</b> The mineral grains in such rocks can generally {{be identified with}} the naked eye. Intrusive rocks can also be classified according to the shape {{and size of the}} intrusive body and its relation to the other formations into which it intrudes. Typical intrusive formations are batholiths, stocks, laccoliths, sills and dikes. When the magma solidifies within the earth's crust, it cools slowly forming coarse textured rocks, such as granite, gabbro, or diorite.|$|E
25|$|The {{contact between}} the Tapeats Sandstone and Bass Formation {{and the rest of}} the folded and faulted Unkar Group is a {{prominent}} angular unconformity, which is part of the Great Unconformity. The differential erosion of the Unkar Group left resistant beds of the Cardenas Basalt and Shinumo Quartzite as topographic highs, ancient monadnocks, that are now buried by sandstones, shales, and conglomerates of the Tapeats Sandstone. These monadnocks served locally as sources of <b>coarse-grained</b> sediments during the marine transgression that deposited the Tapeats Sandstone and other members of the Tonto Group. The {{contact between the}} Bass Formation and the Tapeats Sandstone forms part of a relative flat surface that lies between the monadnocks.|$|E
25|$|Now the Wilmslow Formation, (part of the Sherwood Sandstone Group), {{the lower}} Triassic was {{previously}} a threefold division, the Lower Mottled Sandstone, The Pebble Beds and the Upper Mottled Sandstone, (only the later is seen at Alderley) which merged into the Conglomerates {{of the upper}} Triassic. The Upper Mottled Sandstone now the lower Wilmslow Member is a medium to <b>coarse-grained</b> friable false-bedded sandstone with abrupt colour changes from bright red to white. It is composed mainly of rounded grains but sub-angular grains also occur. Normally the rock lacks coherence and weathers into sand down to 6m and even unweathered rock can be crushed to sand easily. However near faults, ghost crystals of barites make the sandstone harder and resistant.|$|E
25|$|From the {{expression}} above, {{it is seen}} that the van der Waals force decreases with decreasing size of bodies (R). Nevertheless, the strength of inertial forces, such as gravity and drag/lift, decrease to a greater extent. Consequently, the van der Waals forces become dominant for collections of very small particles such as very fine-grained dry powders (where there are no capillary forces present) even though the force of attraction is smaller in magnitude {{than it is for}} larger particles of the same substance. Such powders are said to be cohesive, meaning they are not as easily fluidized or pneumatically conveyed as their more <b>coarse-grained</b> counterparts. Generally, free-flow occurs with particles greater than about 250 μm.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Cornell {{deployed}} the first IBM 3090-400VF and coupled two IBM 3090-600E systems to investigate <b>coarse-grained</b> parallel computing. In 1984, the National Science Foundation {{began work on}} establishing five new supercomputer centers, including the Cornell Center for Advanced Computing, to provide high-speed computing resources for research within the United States. As an NSF center, Cornell deployed the first IBM Scalable Parallel supercomputer. In the 1990s, Cornell developed scheduling software and deployed the first supercomputer built by Dell. Most recently, Cornell deployed Red Cloud, {{one of the first}} cloud computing services designed specifically for research. Today, the center is a partner on the National Science Foundation XSEDE supercomputing program, providing coordination for XSEDE architecture and design, systems reliability testing, and online training using the Cornell Virtual Workshop learning platform.|$|E
25|$|The geology of Duluth {{demonstrates}} the Midcontinent Rift, formed as the North American continent (Laurentia) began to split apart about 1.1 billion years ago. Continental rifting is a recurring {{process in the}} history of the earth that leads to break-up of continents and the formation of ocean basins. In the Lake Superior region, the upwelling of molten rock may have been the result of a hot spot that produced a dome over the Lake Superior area. As the earth's crust thinned, magma rose toward the surface. When insulated by overlying roof rock, the upwelling magma cooled slowly, and is therefore <b>coarse-grained.</b> These intrusions formed a sill some 16km thick, primarily of gabbro, which is known as the Duluth Complex. In the areas where the rising magma erupted to the surface and cooled rapidly, basalt, the extrusive equivalent of gabbro, was formed.|$|E
25|$|Giant {{elongate}} drifts form {{very large}} mounded elongated geometries {{parallel to the}} deepwater bottom-current flow. They are characterized by a near complete lack of parallel bedding. Mounded drifts are often bounded on one or both sides by non-depositional or erosional channels, sometimes known as moats. These drifts can be “tens to hundreds of kilometers long, tens of kilometers wide, and range from 0.1 to more than 1 km in relief above the surrounding seafloor”. Their length to width ratio ranges from 2:1 to 10:1. They can accumulate to thicknesses greater than 2km and can form anywhere from the upper slope to the deepest parts of the basin depending on the specific location of the bottom-current. Sedimentation rates range from 20 – 100 m/Ma. They tend to be finer-grained {{with a lot of}} mud, silt and biogenic material. <b>Coarse-grained</b> contourites are very rare. They may also form detached or separated versions due to seafloor topography and flow conditions. Detached drifts are isolated and migrate downslope while separated drifts typically are asymmetric in shape, tend to form {{at the base of a}} slope and migrate up-slope. Large sediment waves have been observed partially covering some giant elongate drifts.|$|E
500|$|In 1924, Satyendra Nath Bose derived Planck's law of black-body {{radiation}} {{without using}} any electromagnetism, {{but rather by}} using a modification of <b>coarse-grained</b> counting of phase space. Einstein showed that this modification is equivalent to assuming that photons are rigorously identical and that it implied a [...] "mysterious non-local interaction", now understood as the requirement for a symmetric quantum mechanical state. This work led {{to the concept of}} coherent states and the development of the laser. In the same papers, Einstein extended Bose's formalism to material particles (bosons) and predicted that they would condense into their lowest quantum state at low enough temperatures; this Bose–Einstein condensation was observed experimentally in 1995. It was later used by Lene Hau to slow, and then completely stop, light in 1999 and 2001.|$|E
500|$|The Pont du Gard was {{constructed}} largely {{without the use}} of mortar or clamps. It contains an estimated 50,400 tons of limestone with a volume of some some of the individual blocks weigh up to 6 tons. Most of the stone was extracted from the local quarry of Estel located approximately [...] downstream, {{on the banks of the}} Gardon River. The <b>coarse-grained</b> soft reddish [...] shelly limestone, [...] known locally as [...] "Pierre de Vers", [...] lends itself very well to dimension stone production. The blocks were precisely cut to fit perfectly together by friction alone, eliminating the need for mortar. The builders also left inscriptions on the stonework conveying various messages and instructions. Many blocks were numbered and inscribed with the required locations, such as fronte dextra or fronte sinistra (front right or front left), to guide the builders.|$|E
500|$|Marble {{has a more}} <b>coarse-grained</b> texture than limestone, {{but both}} are made of calcite (CaCO3). Caves often develop when {{slightly}} acidic groundwater dissolves calcite along natural fractures in the rock. A reversal of the dissolving process can create flowstone and dripstone such as stalactites, which hang from cave ceilings like icicles, and stalagmites, cone-shaped masses that form on cave floors, usually directly below stalactites. These structures form when acidic groundwater with {{a high concentration of}} dissolved calcite drips slowly from the ceiling of an air-filled cave, becomes less acidic, and leaves some of its calcite behind as a solid precipitate. Oregon Caves includes a variety of cave formations created through precipitation of calcite. Although many of the speleothems in the public sections of the cave have been broken, discolored by human skin oils, or otherwise damaged, the narrow twisting passages of the [...] "show cave" [...] have been largely preserved.|$|E
500|$|Singapore {{took the}} {{position}} that Pedra Branca, Middle Rocks and South Ledge {{should be considered a}} single group of maritime features as Middle Rocks and South Ledge were dependencies of Pedra Branca. It relied, among others, on the Island of Palmas Case (1932): [...] "As regards a group of islands, it is possible that a group may under certain circumstances be regarded as in law a unit, and that the fate of the principal part may involve the rest." [...] It argued that the three maritime features were geomorphologically the same, as rock samples showed that they were all composed of a light, <b>coarse-grained</b> biotite granite. Additionally, Malaysia had not shown any exercise of sovereignty over the uninhabited reefs of Middle Rocks and South Ledge while Singapore had consistently exercised sovereign authority in the surrounding waters. Since sovereignty over Pedra Branca belonged to Singapore, so did sovereignty over Middle Rocks and South Ledge as they were within Pedra Branca's territorial waters.|$|E
500|$|Tapeats Sandstone averages 525million {{years old}} and is made of medium- to <b>coarse-grained</b> sand and {{conglomerate}} that was deposited on an ancient shore (see 3a in [...] ). Ripple marks are common in the upper members of this dark brown thin-bedded layer. Fossils and imprint trails of trilobites and brachiopods have also {{been found in the}} Tapeats. Today it is a cliff-former that is [...] thick. Bright Angel Shale averages 515million {{years old and}} is made of mudstone-derived shale that is interbedded with small sections of sandstone and shaly limestone with a few thin beds of dolomite. It was mostly deposited as mud just offshore and contains brachiopod, trilobite, and worm fossils (see 3b in figure 1). The color of this formation is mostly various shades of green with some brownish-tan to gray parts. It is a slope-former and is [...] thick. Glauconite is responsible for the green coloration of the Bright Angel. Muav Limestone averages 505million years old and is made of gray, thin-bedded limestone that was deposited farther offshore from calcium carbonate precipitates (see 3c in figure 1). The western part of the canyon has a much thicker sequence of Muav than the eastern part. The Muav is a cliff-former, [...] thick.|$|E
