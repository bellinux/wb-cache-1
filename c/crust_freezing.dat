40|$|Restructured steaks {{offer the}} {{potential}} advantage of upgrading lower valued cuts and carcasses while providing a completely edible, boneless product with both texture and price intermediate between that of ground meat and intact high quality muscle steaks. ^ The primary {{objective of this}} research was to identify factors which affect color stability of restructured beef steaks while optimizing texture. This problem was approached by alterations in processing techniques. Two studies were conducted. ^ The objective of the first {{study was to determine the}} effect of meat processing temperature on the color of restructured beef steaks. Restructured beef steaks were made at processing temperatures of 4. 4, 1. 7, - 1. 1 or - 3. 9 (DEGREES) C using carbon dioxide snow to obtain the desired temperatures. The relative percentages of, deoxymyoglobin and metmyoglobin were not affected by processing temperature (P 3 ̆e 0. 05), as measured by reflectance spectrophotometry. Percent oxymyoglobin was higher in steaks processed at 3. 9 (DEGREES) (P 3 ̆e 0. 05). Product lightness, as measured by a Hunterlab colorimeter, increased as processing temperature decreased (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) while product redness was unaffected. There was a decrease in oxymyoglobin (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) and an increase in deoxymyoglobin (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) and metmyoglobin (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) with time. Product lightness showed an overall increase (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) with time while product redness decreased (P 3 ̆c 0. 01). Product bind increased linearly (P 3 ̆e 0. 01) as processing temperature decreased. Product color was slightly improved as processing temperature decreased and product bind was also improved. ^ The second study evaluated the effect of method of <b>crust</b> <b>freezing</b> (immediate blast freezing, delayed blast freezing and rapid carbon dioxide snow <b>crust</b> <b>freezing)</b> as well as processing temperature (4, 0, - 4 (DEGREES) C) on the color and texture of restructured beef steaks. Steaks manufactured at - 4 (DEGREES) C were higher in cooking losses (P 3 ̆c 0. 05), less tender (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) and had a poorer bind than steaks manufactured at 0 or 4 (DEGREES) C. Steaks that were blast frozen immediately had a significantly higher bind (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) than steaks that were delayed blast frozen or rapidly crust frozen. The color of steaks processed at - 4 (DEGREES) C and immediately blast frozen was improved (higher Hunter color values) and had more oxymyoglobin and less metmyoglobin and deoxymyoglobin than steaks from other treatments. It is recommended that restructured steaks be processed at or near 0 (DEGREES) C followed by immediate blast freezing to optimize product color and bind. ...|$|E
40|$|Campylobacter infections pose {{a serious}} {{public health problem}} in Belgium. Poultry meat is most likely {{responsible}} for 40 % of human campylobacteriosis cases in Belgium. On a yearly basis, consumption of poultry meat causes at least 22, 000 campylobacteriosis cases, with a cost of illness of (sic) 10. 9 million. Several intervention measures have been proposed in literature, aiming to reduce the contamination of poultry meat and thus lead to significant reductions of human campylobacteriosis cases. This study aimed to evaluate the cost-benefit ratio, i. e., the ratio of reduced costs of illness on intervention costs of various intervention measures. These measures were selected by representatives from the poultry meat sector and {{experts in the field}} of poultry science. The selection comprised measures at the farm level (phage therapy), at the processing plant (spraying of carcasses with lactic acid or electrolyzed oxidizing water, <b>crust</b> <b>freezing,</b> or irradiation), and at the consumer level (improving kitchen hygiene and application of home freezing). Among these measures, the decontamination of carcasses with electrolyzed oxidizing water applied in the processing plant was the most efficient (17. 66), followed by the use of lactic acid (4. 06). In addition, phage therapy generated a positive cost-benefit ratio (2. 54). Irradiation indicated the highest efficacy, but its cost-benefit ratio was rather low (0. 31). There seems to be less gain by trying to improve food handling in the kitchen. The cost to reach consumers is large, while only a very limited fraction of the consumers is willing to change its behavior. The outcome of this study poses valuable information for future risk-management decisions in Belgium...|$|E
40|$|The Melt Attack and Coolability Experiments (MACE) {{program at}} Argonne National Laboratory {{addressed}} the issue of the ability of water to cool and thermally stabilize a molten core/concrete interaction (MCCI) when the reactants are flooded from above. These tests provided data regarding the nature of corium interactions with concrete, the heat transfer rates from the melt to the overlying water pool, and the role of noncondensable gases in the mixing processes that contribute to melt quenching. However, due to the integral nature of these tests, several questions regarding the <b>crust</b> <b>freezing</b> behavior could not be adequately resolved. These questions include: (1) To what extent does water ingression into the crust increase the melt quench rate above the conduction-limited rate and how is this affected by melt composition and system pressure and (2) What is the fracture strength of the corium crust when subjected to a thermal-mechanical load and how does it depend upon the melt composition? A series of separate-effects experiments are being conducted to address these issues. The first employs an apparatus designed to measure the quench rate of a pool of corium ({approx}{phi} 30 cm; up to 20 cm deep). The main parameter to be varied in these quench tests is the melt composition since it is thought to have a critical influence on the crust cracking behavior which, in turn, alters quench rate. The issue of crust strength will be addressed with a second apparatus designed to mechanically load the crust produced by the quench tests. This apparatus will measure the fracture strength of the crust while under a thermal load created by a heating element beneath the crust. The two apparatuses used to measure the melt quench rate and crust strength are jointly referred to as SSWICS (Small-Scale Water Ingression and Crust Strength). This report describes results of the first water ingression test, designated SSWICS- 1. The report includes a description of the test apparatus, the instrumentation used, plots of the recorded data, and some rudimentary data reduction to obtain an estimate of the heat flux from the corium to the overlying water pool...|$|E
60|$|In {{the higher}} valley {{in which they}} now found themselves, the crust did not break till three in the afternoon, at which time they managed to gain {{the shadow of a}} {{mountain}} where the <b>crust</b> was already <b>freezing</b> again. Once only they paused to get out McCan's confiscated suet, which they ate as they walked. The meat was frozen solid, and could be eaten only after thawing over a fire. But the suet crumbled in their mouths and eased the palpitating faintness in their stomachs.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Melt <b>freeze</b> <b>crusts</b> are a {{frequent}} occurrence in the mid-latitudes, often forming in the snowcover due to rain or wet {{snow in the}} fall and insolation in the spring. Such crusts are frequently found at the bed surface of deep slab avalanches. Although faceting and weakening at the boundaries and in the interior of crusts under low temperature gradients has been documented, few long term systematic observations exist. This omission is potentially important, as an understanding of these processes may improve forecasting the strength of deep crusts. For the past two winter seasons, the University of Calgary Applied Snow and Avalanche Research group (ASARC) has monitored naturally occurring crusts in the Columbia Mountains of Western Canada. Properties such as grain form and size, density, temperature and hardness were observed on a weekly basis. Starting in the 2008 - 09 field season, the specific surface area (SSA) of three crusts was measured weekly using near infrared digital photography, resulting in 23 observations over two months including the transition to near-isothermal snow, where substantial structural changes were observed. This paper details these and other results...|$|R
40|$|The freeze-crusting of a {{foodstuff}} is a cryogenic or mechanical crusting of {{the product}} which is realized either by spray-freezing, immersion freezing, air blast freezing or contact freezing. Thanks to the early formation of a peripheral frozen layer during the freeze-crusting, the mechanical resistance increases so that the product doesn't glue and doesn't get deformed through the treatment that follows (i. e. freezing or slicing). When this freeze-crusting treatment is used before a freezing process, other advantages of such a treatment are the mass loss and the freezing time reduction. These benefits have been characterized together by experiment and modeling. From a mathematical modeling viewpoint, the heat and mass transfers have been calculated using the enthalpy formulation. The surface convective boundary conditions take into account a time-variable heat transfer coefficient because of the different stages of the process (for example <b>crusting</b> and mechanical <b>freezing).</b> From an experimental viewpoint, we have conducted number of experiments with a cryomechanical freezing pilot. We have measured {{the reduction of the}} freezing time, the reduction of the mass loss and the increase of the mechanical resistance. / Le croûtage d'une denrée par le froid peut être réalisé par voie cryogénique ou mécanique au moyen d'une technique d'aspersion, d'immersion, de convection forcée ou encore par contact. Grâce à la formation précoce d'une couche périphérique congelée durant le croûtage, la résistance mécanique augmente de sorte que le produit ne colle pas et ne se déforme pas durant le traitement qui suit (ce traitement peut être la congélation et le tranchage). Quand ce croûtage par le froid est utilisé avant un procédé de congélation, les avantages complémentaires du croûtage sont la réduction de la perte en eau et du temps de congélation. Ces avantages ont été caractérisés à la fois expérimentalement et par la simulation...|$|R
