5|$|The {{demand for}} iridium surged from 2.5 tonnes in 2009 to 10.4 tonnes in 2010, {{mostly because of}} electronics-related {{applications}} that saw a rise from 0.2 to 6 tonnes – iridium <b>crucibles</b> are commonly used for growing large high-quality single crystals, demand for which has increased sharply. This increase in iridium consumption is predicted to saturate due to accumulating stocks of <b>crucibles,</b> as happened earlier in the 2000s. Other major applications include spark plugs that consumed 0.78 tonnes of iridium in 2007, electrodes for the chloralkali process (1.1 t in 2007) and chemical catalysts (0.75 t in 2007).|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The present {{research}} was focused to extensively investigate {{the effect of}} TaC-coated <b>crucible</b> on the SiC crystal growth and then compare the difference of various properties between SiC crystals grown in conventional graphite <b>crucible</b> and TaC-coated <b>crucible.</b> The bulk growth was conducted around 2200 oC of the growth temperature and 40 mbar of an argon atmosphere for the growth pressure. The better crystalline quality {{was obtained from the}} crystal grown in TaC-coated <b>crucible.</b> The SiC crystal grown in the TaC-coated <b>crucible</b> exhibited superior characteristics than SiC crystal grown in the conventional <b>crucible</b> in terms of the crystal quality and defect density.

They found the monks slaughtered and also find the armored <b>Crucible.</b> <b>Crucible</b> forced Aguirre and Clay {{on a plane and}} they are flown to Europe while <b>Crucible</b> states that he was the <b>crucible</b> from which would a new world would be formed. <b>Crucible</b> transformed them into stone gargoyles to smuggle them through immigration. In Stockholm, Sweden, <b>Crucible</b> restored them to life, and coerced them into serving him be turned back into stone gargoyles. <b>Crucible</b> then attacked a science symposium to draw out Mister Fantastic.

5|$|<b>Crucibles</b> used {{to contain}} {{plutonium}} {{need to be}} able to withstand its strongly reducing properties. Refractory metals such as tantalum and tungsten along with the more stable oxides, borides, carbides, nitrides and silicides can tolerate this. Melting in an electric arc furnace can be used to produce small ingots of the metal without the need for a crucible.|$|E
5|$|Devices {{that must}} {{withstand}} extremely high temperatures are often made from iridium. For example, high-temperature <b>crucibles</b> made of iridium {{are used in}} the Czochralski process to produce oxide single-crystals (such as sapphires) for use in computer memory devices and in solid state lasers. The crystals, such as gadolinium gallium garnet and yttrium gallium garnet, are grown by melting pre-sintered charges of mixed oxides under oxidizing conditions at temperatures up to 2100°C.|$|E
5|$|Free {{hydrochloric}} acid was first formally {{described in the}} 16th century by Libavius, who prepared it by heating salt in clay <b>crucibles.</b> Other authors claim that pure {{hydrochloric acid}} was first discovered by the German Benedictine monk Basil Valentine in the 15th century, when he heated common salt and green vitriol, whereas others {{argue that there is}} no clear reference to the preparation of pure hydrochloric acid {{until the end of the}} 16th century.|$|E
30|$|In general {{activated}} carbon is prepared in an inert media (nitrogen or argon). However {{the preparation of}} inner environment for {{activated carbon}} is little bit inaccessible in general at local condition. Then an alternative method was applied in this study called double <b>crucible</b> method. In this method the char {{was placed in a}} smaller silicon <b>crucible</b> covered with ground silicon lid (Tatlok brand). The small <b>crucible</b> containing rice husk char is put in a bigger porcelain <b>crucible.</b> The gap inside the bigger <b>crucible</b> is filled up by raw husk to make reduce oxygen environment inside the <b>crucible</b> and finally the bigger <b>crucible</b> was covered with lid. In this method, the bulk volume of air inside the bigger <b>crucible</b> is replaced by raw char, again when the <b>crucible</b> is heated up; firstly the volume of air inside the <b>crucible</b> is expanded and a portion of the air comes out from both the small and bigger crucible; secondly the volatile part of rice husk is reacted with oxygen and it is assumed that the entire amount of oxygen is exhausted from the <b>crucible</b> during the heating process. Since there is no inert media is used in this study it will be cost effective process.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} steel {{companies}} have operated in Syracuse, maintaining <b>Crucible's</b> intellectual property and patents. In 1870, William A. Sweet founded the Sweet Iron Works. Sanderson Brothers of Sheffield, England, bought the Sweet Iron Works for U.S. production in 1876, renaming the steelworks Sanderson. In 1900, Sanderson's Syracuse steelworks merged into the <b>Crucible</b> Steel Company of America. In 1946 the Sanderson and Halcomb steelworks were renamed the Sanderson-Halcomb Works, later becoming the Syracuse Works of <b>Crucible</b> Steel. In 1968, <b>Crucible</b> became Colt's <b>Crucible</b> Specialty Metals Division. Colt consolidated its basic-materials group into the <b>Crucible</b> Materials Corporation in 1983.|$|R

5|$|The {{reputation}} of Seric iron of South India (wootz steel) amongst {{the rest of}} the world grew considerably. Metal production sites in Sri Lanka employed wind furnaces driven by the monsoon winds, capable of producing high-carbon steel. Large-scale Wootz steel production in Tamilakam using <b>crucibles</b> and carbon sources such as the plant Avāram occurred by the sixth century BC, the pioneering precursor to modern steel production and metallurgy.|$|E
5|$|Thorium dioxide is a {{material}} for heat-resistant ceramics, {{as used in}} high-temperature laboratory <b>crucibles,</b> as a main material or as an addition to zirconium dioxide. An alloy of 90% platinum and 10% thorium is an effective catalyst for oxidising ammonia to nitrogen oxides, but this {{has been replaced by}} an alloy of 95% platinum and 5% rhodium because of its better mechanical properties and greater durability.|$|E
5|$|As well as copper, a new {{substance}} was found, extracted and exploited: this was variously called wad, black lead, plumbago or black cauke, {{and is now}} known as graphite. Many uses were quickly discovered for the mineral: it reduced friction in machinery, made a heat-resistant glaze for <b>crucibles,</b> and when used to line moulds for cannonballs, resulted in rounder, smoother balls that could be fired further by English naval cannon. Later, from {{the second half of the}} 18th century, it was used to make pencils, for which Keswick became famous.|$|E

50|$|As a <b>crucible</b> will be {{very hot}} when heating it in a furnace or a Bunsen burner, one cannot hold the <b>crucible</b> directly. Therefore, <b>crucible</b> tongs come to {{play a key role}} when burning, or doing {{anything}} with hot objects. The major types of metals used to produce the tongs are stainless steel, brass, and nickel. Moreover, some of them also have a special characteristic. For instance, a locking version of <b>crucible</b> tongs can be locked with the edge of a <b>crucible,</b> allow users to be more comfortable and more confidence while moving a very hot <b>crucible</b> from place to place. Hence, they provide more safety for the users.|$|R
5|$|Silver {{is useful}} in the {{manufacture}} of chemical equipment on account of its low chemical reactivity, high thermal conductivity, and being easily workable. Silver <b>crucibles</b> (alloyed with 0.15% nickel to avoid recrystallisation of the metal at red heat) are used for carrying out alkaline fusion. Copper and silver are also used when doing chemistry with fluorine. Equipment made to work at high temperatures is often silver-plated. Silver and its alloys with gold are used as wire or ring seals for oxygen compressors and vacuum equipment.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} iridium compounds in use are the salts and acids it forms with chlorine, though iridium also forms {{a number of}} organometallic compounds used in industrial catalysis, and in research. Iridium metal is employed when high corrosion resistance at high temperatures is needed, as in high-performance spark plugs, <b>crucibles</b> for recrystallization of semiconductors at high temperatures, and electrodes {{for the production of}} chlorine in the chloralkali process. Iridium radioisotopes are used in some radioisotope thermoelectric generators.|$|E
5|$|Thorium was {{discovered}} in 1828; its first application came in 1885, when Austrian chemist Carl Auer von Welsbach invented the gas mantle, a portable source of light which produces light from the incandescence of thorium oxide when heated by burning gaseous fuels. After that, many applications were found for thorium and its compounds, including ceramics, carbon arc lamps, heat-resistant <b>crucibles,</b> and as catalysts for industrial chemical reactions such as the oxidation of ammonia to nitric acid.|$|E

5|$|A {{research}} survey at Kodumanal has unearthed {{the remains}} of an ancient blast furnace, its circular base distinguishable by its white colour, probably the result of high temperature. Around the base, many iron slags, some with embedded burnt clay, vitrified brick-bats, many terracotta pipes with vitrified mouths and a granite slab, {{which may have been}} the anvil, have been recovered. Absence of potsherds and other antiquities has suggested that the smelting place was located outside the boundary of habitation. More furnaces were discovered at the same site with burnt clay pieces with rectangular holes. The pieces were part of the furnace wall, the holes designed to allow a natural draught of air to pass through evenly into the furnace. Many vitrified <b>crucibles</b> were also recovered from this site; one of them notable because it was found in an in situ position. Evidence of steel making is also found in the <b>crucibles</b> excavated at this site. In addition to iron and steel, the metallurgy seems to have possibly extended to copper, bronze, lead, silver and gold objects. At Arikamedu, there were indications of small-scale workshops containing {{the remains of}} working in metal, glass, semiprecious stones, ivory and shell. Kodumanal has yielded evidence for the practice of weaving, {{in the form of a}} number of intact terracotta spindle whorls pierced at the centre by means of an iron rod, indicating the knowledge of cotton spinning and weaving. To further strengthen this theory, a well preserved piece of woven cotton cloth was also recovered from this site. Dyeing vats were spotted at Arikamedu.|$|E

From 1948 to 1952, the Carborundum Company, Niagara Falls, New York, applied for several patents on the manufacture and application of silicon nitride. By 1958 Haynes (Union Carbide) silicon nitride was in commercial production for thermocouple tubes, rocket nozzles, and boats and <b>crucibles</b> for melting metals. British work on silicon nitride, started in 1953, was aimed at high-temperature parts of gas turbines and resulted {{in the development of}} reaction-bonded silicon nitride and hot-pressed silicon nitride.

5|$|Spedding and Wilhelm {{began looking}} for ways to create the uranium metal. At the time, it was {{produced}} {{in the form of a}} powder, and was highly pyrophoric. It could be pressed and sintered and stored in cans, but to be useful, it needed to be melted and cast. Casting presented difficulty because uranium corroded <b>crucibles</b> of beryllium, magnesia and graphite. To produce uranium metal, they tried reducing uranium oxide with hydrogen, but this did not work. While most of the neighboring elements on the periodic table can be reduced to form pure metal and slag, uranium did not behave this way. In June 1942 they then tried reducing the uranium with carbon in a hydrogen atmosphere, with only moderate success. They then tried aluminum, magnesium and calcium, all of which were unsuccessful. The following month the Ames team found that molten uranium could be cast in a graphite container. Although graphite was known to react with uranium, this could be managed because the carbide formed only where the two touched.|$|E
40|$|Central Asian <b>crucible</b> steel {{has been}} {{neglected}} in the scholarly literature {{in favour of}} Indian/Sri Lankan <b>crucible</b> steel (commonly called wootz). This is primarily because {{during the last few}} centuries Europeans frequently traded by sea, rather than via the overland route through Central Asia, with India and Sri Lanka where <b>crucible</b> steel was still being produced. The consequence of this was the assumption that the majority of <b>crucible</b> steel in Central Asia and the Middle East was imported from India and Sri Lanka. Moreover, the Central Asian <b>crucible</b> steel process is thought by many to be merely a variation of the Indian/Sri Lankan process. On the contrary, recently excavated archaeological evidence indicates that <b>crucible</b> steel was produced for centuries by a distinct process in various locations in Central Asia. This dissertation presents the first detailed investigation of <b>crucible</b> steel in Central Asia. The characteristics of Central Asian <b>crucible</b> steel production were primarily determined by laboratory analyses of archaeometallurgical remains excavated from an early Islamic (9 th- 10 th century AD) <b>crucible</b> steel workshop from Merv, Turkmenistan. A selection of <b>crucible</b> steel production remains from Medieval Uzbekistan was also examined. Furthermore, fifty-seven blades from three locations in Central Asia: Kislovodsk Basin, Upper Kuban River Region, and around the Aral Sea, were examined using metallographic analyses. The analyses identified four <b>crucible</b> steel blades, one of which may be the earliest known example of Damascus steel. The laboratory analyses supports early textual accounts of the use of <b>crucible</b> steel in Persia/Central Asia in addition to India, and the presence of blades with a Damascus pattern. The results were compared to ethnographic reports, historical accounts, archaeological evidence, and replication experiments related to the production of <b>crucible</b> steel and Damascus steel blades. The results of the investigation clearly demonstrate the use of <b>crucible</b> steel in Central Asia for at least the past 1, 500 years, and that it was being produced there for at least {{as long as it was}} produced in India and Sri Lanka...|$|R
