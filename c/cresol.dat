25|$|Wood-tar {{creosote}} is a colourless to yellowish greasy liquid with a smoky odor, {{produces a}} sooty flame when burned, {{and has a}} burned taste. It is non-buoyant in water, with a specific gravity of 1.037 to 1.087, retains fluidity at a very low temperature, and boils at 205-225°C. When transparent, it is in its purest form. Dissolution in water requires up to 200 {{times the amount of}} water as the base creosote. The creosote is a combination of natural phenols: primarily guaiacol and creosol (4-methylguaiacol), which will typically constitute 50% of the oil; second in prevalence, <b>cresol</b> and xylenol; the rest being a combination of monophenols and polyphenols.|$|E
2500|$|Train 192 was {{transporting}} chlorine gas, {{sodium hydroxide}} and <b>cresol.</b> One of 192's tank cars (loaded with 90 tons of chlorine) ruptured, releasing about 60 tons of the gas. About 30% {{of the load}} was recovered by industrial responders. [...] Nine people died (eight {{at the time of}} the accident, one later as a result of chlorine inhalation), and at least 250 people were treated for chlorine exposure. In total, 5,400 residents within one mile (1.6km) of the crash site were forced to evacuate for nearly two weeks while HAZMAT teams and cleanup crews decontaminated the area.|$|E
2500|$|In aquatic sediments, {{a number}} of {{reactions}} can transform the chemicals released by the creosote preservatives into more dangerous chemicals. Most creosote preservative compounds have hazards associated with them before they are transformed. <b>Cresol</b> (m-, p-, and o-), phenol, guaiacol, and xylenol (1,3,4- and 1,3,5-) all are acute aquatic hazards prior to going through chemical reactions with the sediments. Alkylation reactions allows for the compounds to transition into more toxic compounds {{with the addition of}} R-groups to the major compounds found in creosote preservatives. Compounds formed through alkylation include: 3,4-dimethylphenol, 2,3-dimethylphenol, and 2,5-dimethylphenol, which are all listed as acute environmental hazards. [...] Biodegradation controls {{the rate at which the}} sediment holds the chemicals, and the amount of reactions that are able to take place. The biodegradation process can take place under many different conditions, and vary depending on the compounds that are released. Oxidation-reduction reactions allow for the compounds to be broken down into new forms of more toxic molecules. Studies have shown oxidation-reduction reactions of creosote preservative compounds included compounds that are listed as environmental hazards, such as p-benzoquinone in the oxidation of phenol. Not only are the initial compounds in creosote hazardous to the environment, but the byproducts of the chemical reactions are environmental hazardous as well.|$|E
50|$|Most {{exposures}} to <b>cresols</b> are {{at very low}} levels that are not harmful although, like phenols, <b>cresols</b> are skin irritants. When <b>cresols</b> are breathed, ingested, or applied to the skin at very high levels, they can be harmful. Breathing high levels of <b>cresols</b> {{for a short time}} results in irritation of the nose and throat.

40|$|Radiation {{chemical}} oxidation of hydroxybenzaldehydes, <b>cresols</b> and chlorotoluenes {{have been}} studied using both pulse and steady-state radiolysis techniques. The rates of the reaction of •OH {{were found to be}} high. Dehydration leading to the formation of the phenoxyl radical was observed from the OH adducts of m-hydroxybenzaldehyde. The rates of oxygen addition to the OH adducts of o-, m- and p-chlorotoluenes and <b>cresols</b> are high. The relatively high stability constants of peroxyl radicals formed with <b>cresols</b> than with chlorotoluenes suggest that the product forming reaction competes effectively with the reverse reaction in <b>cresols...</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{fact sheet}} answers the most {{frequently}} asked health questions (FAQs) about <b>cresols.</b> For more information, call the ATSDR Information Center at 1 - 800 - 232 - 4636. This fact sheet is {{one in a series}} of summaries about hazardous substances and their health effects. It is important you understand this information because these substances may harm you. The effects of exposure to any hazardous substance depend on the dose, the duration, how you are exposed, personal traits and habits, and whether other chemicals are present. HIGHLIGHTS: Exposure to <b>cresols</b> occurs mainly from breathing air containing car exhaust, air from homes heated with coal or wood, and smoking cigarettes. <b>Cresols</b> are corrosive and high levels can cause skin burns and internal burns if ingested, in addition to liver and kidney damage, and possibly death. Low levels may cause eye, nose, and throat irritation. o-Cresol, m-cresol, p-cresol, and mixed <b>cresols</b> have been found in at least 210, 22, 310, and 70 of the 1, 678 current or former National Priority List sites, respectively, identified by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
