40|$|AbstractEpoxy/glass {{composite}} containing {{two different}} micro-fillers {{was developed by}} vacuum bagging technique. The effect of <b>ceramic</b> <b>whisker</b> (7. 5 wt%) and solid lubricant filler (2. 5 wt%) on mechanical and dry sliding wear behavior of epoxy/glass composites was studied. The mechanical property characterization included evaluations of tensile, flexural and impact properties as per ASTM standards. The dry sliding wear tests were conducted on pin-on-disc arrangement with steel disc as counterface. Experimental results indicated that single incorporation of <b>ceramic</b> <b>whisker</b> can improve stiffness, friction coefficient and anti- wear abilities of epoxy/glass composites significantly. The strength properties of composites were slightly reduced after whisker addition. However, incorporation of solid lubricant as secondary filler resulted in improvement of both mechanical and tribological properties of composites. It was also found that tribological properties of filled epoxy/glass composites were closely related with sliding conditions such as applied load and sliding velocity. The deformation and failure mechanisms under tensile loading and dry sliding were investigated using SEM photographs...|$|E

40|$|Materials {{reinforcement}} by <b>ceramic</b> <b>whiskers</b> {{has been}} employed {{for a long}} time in a variety of industrial applications.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{mechanical}} {{behavior of}} several filler-modified epoxy resins was inves-tigated. Modifications of matrix resin with thermoplastic particulates or <b>ceramic</b> <b>whiskers</b> were proposed {{as an alternative}} to rubber-toughening for improving the impact resistance of epoxy resins. Addition of 10 % by weight of untreated thermoplastic powders in an epoxy resin only slightly increased the impact energy of the epoxy resin. A reduction in flexural strength of this thermoplastic particulate-filled resin was observed. This is most likely due to poor particulate-matrix bonding. Dispersion of 10 % of <b>ceramic</b> <b>whiskers</b> in an epoxy resin improved appreciably the impact energy, flexural strength and modulus of the epoxy. The impact energy absorbed by a resin was enhanced by the approach of partic-ulate / whisker hybridization. A uniform dispersion of either particulates or whiskers in the epoxy matrix is essential to the achievement of balanced mechanical properties. Deforma-tion and failure mechanisms in these composites were also examined using both SEM and instrumented impact testing...|$|R
40|$|Scaffolds for tissue {{engineering}} {{can be either}} natural or synthetic materials. The latter allow control of chemical, physical and mechanical properties and also provide support and shape, however they are not of biological origin, and therefore could not promote cell adhesion. This problem does not occur in natural materials however, they have the drawback of having non-suitable mechanical properties and tend to deteriorate too fast. In this work we study the influence of different substrate on the metabolic as well as proliferative cells activity. In particular 4 substrates have been considered: (i) medical grade StageFlexer (silicone elastomer), (ii) Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), (iii) PDMS {{with a layer of}} carbon nanotubes (CNT’s) and (iv) PDMS with a layer of <b>ceramic</b> <b>whiskers.</b> The results of both tests (metabolic and proliferative capacity) showed that the PDMS without any surface treatment, is the worst of the tested substrates. The reason {{is to be found in}} the fact that the PDMS is highly hydrophobic and therefore cells have low adhesion to the substrate. This represents a major limitation of PDMS and its functionalization is necessary to improve cell adhesion. Cells placed on PDMS samples with CNT’s show higher metabolic activity and proliferative capacity, compared to the PDMS and PDMS treated with fibronectin. However, the best outcomes have occurred with the PDMS substrate coated with <b>ceramic</b> <b>whiskers...</b>|$|R
40|$|Ceramic-matrix-composites (CMCs) {{are fast}} {{replacing}} other materials in many applications where the higher production costs can {{be offset by}} significant improvement in performance. However, due to their lack of toughness they are prone to catastrophic failures. Hence, the important consideration {{in the design of}} CMCs is to achieve satisfactory toughening. Recent experimental studies of whisker-reinforced ceramics have shown that substantial improvements in fracture toughness can be achieved via the mechanisms of whisker bridging, whisker pull-out and crack deflection. This paper demonstrates the use of finite element method to model the whisker/matrix interface through isoparametric interface elements. A micro mechanical finite element model which uses isoparametricformulation has been presented. The micro mechanical finite element model is then validated by characterising the non-linear force-displacement response of alpha-SiC <b>ceramic</b> <b>whisker</b> embedded in Al 2 O 3 ceramic matrix and comparing it with the simplified analytical solutions.

40|$|A {{broad range}} of {{commercial}} and experimental grades of ceramics and ceramic composites was tested in various model tests and simplified component tests. The tests were done to establish important microstructural features, friction and wear mechanisms. Important tribological systems used in the tests included face seals, abrasive-waterjet nozzles and hybrid bearings. The importance of mechanical and physical properties at the micro-level has been highlighted in the work, as they play vital roles in the tribology of ceramics and are less commonly investigated than the bulk properties. Novel <b>ceramic</b> <b>whisker</b> composites were produced by hot-isostatic-pressing. The composites {{were based on a}} silicon nitride matrix reinforced with silicon carbide whiskers. The matrix of silicon nitride showed high strength and fracture toughness. But the composites showed no improvements in the bulk mechanical properties when compared with the matrix. This was mainly due to impurities in the whisker batch, causing defects and lower fracture toughness. A new type of silicon carbide material was made dense using liquid-phase sintering, and its wear behaviour was established and compared with conventionally solid-state sintered silicon carbides. The presence of grain boundary phases was both an advantage and a disadvantage regarding wear rates. At high wear rates the grain boundary phase limits the severity, probably due to crack deflection of the micro-fractures that occur. However, in mild wear the limited high-temperature properties of the grain boundary phases can be a disadvantage. Monolithic ceramics and composites with similar mechanical and physical properties to the bulk showed dramatically different wear behaviour in the tests. A newly developed, more homogeneous grade of whisker reinforced alumina showed superior wear resistance to the other monolithic ceramics and composites that were considered. A high-speed abrasive-waterjet test was developed in the work for wear testing, and was used to investigate the resistance of ceramics to thermal wear. The wear was caused by thermal spalling, oxidation, creep and plastic deformation. Abrasive-waterjet tests were done at low inclination angles, and newly commercialized machines were used. The tests highlighted the influence of thermal wear in the mixing nozzle for the abrasive and the waterjet, and the thermal mechanisms present while machining engineering ceramics. It was previously not known that an abrasive waterjet creates a thermal zone when machining ceramics at the wear front and in the mixing nozzles. The temperatures reached in the wear zone of the test specimens were at least 1280 ° C for the garnet abrasive, and 2050 ° C for the alumina abrasive. In scratch testing with diamond tips the presence of four different wear regimes was established for ceramics. On the tested materials a transition was seen from entirely ductile deformation at low loads, towards catastrophic brittle fractures at high loads. In scratch testing some materials, such as a hot-isostatic-pressed silicon nitride composite, showed much higher resistance to the initiation of brittle fracture. Ceramic composites reinforced with long fibres were studied to rank their sensitivity to particle impact. The test showed that composites with silicon carbide spheres on the surface were more resistant to the impact of abrasive particles. The spheres were present from the manufacturing process (chemical vapour infiltration). A study of thrust bearings was performed to compare all-steel bearings with hybrid ones. The hybrid bearing was of the same type as the all-steel one except the balls were of silicon nitride. The influence of contaminants in the bearings was investigated for fairly soft micron-sized (0. 1 - 5. my. m titania) and macro-sized (75 100. my. m quartz) ceramic contaminants. The hybrid bearing showed greatly superior performance when contaminants were present compared to the traditional all-steel type of bearing. It was shown that it is even possible to reduce friction and wear in a hybrid bearing system by the introduction of micron-sized titania particles...|$|E

A statistically significant correlation was found between the forsterite content and flexural strength. The proposed mechanism for strengthening is the precipitation of fine forsterite crystals in the glass matrix surrounding unreacted magnesia.

But this property, however, makes {{it one of the most}} difficult materials to machine, necessitating frequent tool replacement due to wear and hence reduced productivity. Also, as the tool wears, the quality of the machined surface deteriorates correspondingly or may even become damaged. This thesis presents a study of how nickel-based superalloys respond to machining during a milling operation. Special consideration in this study has been given to experimental testing, accuracy and precision. Tool wear and surface roughness were investigated for Titanium Aluminum Nitride (TiAlN) coated and uncoated carbide tools under wet (coolant) and dry cutting conditions. Cutting tests were performed on a CNC milling machine to obtain tool wear and surface roughness. Average flank wear and maximum flank wear were determined by using a tool-wear measuring microscope. Surface roughness parameters were measured using a portable stylus type surface roughness tester (Mitutoyo). Based on tool wear, coated carbide tools performed better than uncoated tools and coolant further reduced tool wear and surface roughness during the cutting operation. Tool life equations were established from experimental results in order to determine tool life under wet (coolant) and dry cutting conditions. On the other hand, wear and surface roughness were also investigated for ceramic tools under different cutting conditions. Tests using <b>ceramic</b> tools (<b>Whisker</b> reinforced and Kyon 2100) were carried out under dry conditions and they performed well at high cutting speeds though the machined surface was found to deteriorate when the feed rate was high.

40|$|Metal matrix {{composites}} (MMCs) {{are emerging}} as advanced engineering materials for application in aerospace, defence, automotive and consumer industries (sports goods etc.). In MMCs, a metallic base material is reinforced with <b>ceramic</b> fiber, <b>whisker</b> or particulate {{in order to}} achieve a combination of properties not attainable by either constituent individually. Aluminium or its alloy is favoured as metallic matrix material because of its low density, easy fabricability and good engineering properties. In general, the benefits of aluminium metal matrix composites (AMCs) over unreinforced aluminium alloy are increased specific stiffness, improved wear resistance and decreased coefficient of thermal expansion. The conventional reinforcement materials for AMCs are SiC and AI 2 O 3. In the present work, boron carbide (B 4 C) particles of average size 40 μm were chosen as reinforcement because of its higher hardness (very close to diamond) than the conventional reinforcement like SiC, AI 2 O 3 etc. and of its density (2. 52 g cm" 3) very close to Al alloy matrix. In addition, due to high neutron capture cross-section of 10 B isotope, composites containing B 4 C particle reinforcement have the potential for use in nuclear reactors as neutron shielding and control rod material. Al- 5 %Mg alloy was chosen as matrix alloy to utilize the beneficial role of Mg in improving wettability between B 4 C particles and the alloy melt. (Al- 5 %Mg) -B 4 C composites containing 10 and 20 vol% B 4 C particles were fabricated. For the purpose of inter-comparison, unreinforced Al- 5 %Mg alloy was also prepared and characterized. The Stir Cast technique, commonly utilized for preparation of Al-SiC, was adapted in this investigation. The Composites thus prepared was subsequently hot extruded with the objective of homogenization and healing minor casting defects. Finally the unreinforced alloy and its composites were characterized in terms of their microstructure, mechanical and thermo-physical properties, sliding wear behaviour and neutron absorption characteristics. The microstructures of the composites were evaluated by both optical microscope and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The micrographs revealed a relatively uniform distribution of B 4 C particles and good interfacial integrity between matrix and B 4 C particles. The hot hardness in the range of 25 °C to 500 °C and indentation creep data in the range of 300 °C to 400 °C show that hot hardness and creep resistance of Al-Mg alloy is enhanced by the presence of B 4 C particles. Measurement of coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of composites and unreinforced alloy upto 450 °C showed that CTE values decrease with increase in volume fraction of reinforcement. Compression tests at strain rates, 0. 1, 10 and 100 s- 1 in the temperature range 25 - 450 °C showed that the flow stress values of composites were, in general, greater than those of unreinforced alloy at all strain rates. These tests also depicted that the compressive strength increases with increase in volume fraction of reinforcements. True stress values of composites and unreinforced alloy {{has been found to be}} a strong function of temperature and strain rate. The kinetic analysis of elevated temperature plasticity of composites revealed higher stress exponent values compared to unreinforced alloy. Similarly, apparent activation energy values for hot deformation of composites were found to be higher than that of self-diffusion in Al-Mg alloy. Tensile test data revealed that the modulus and 0. 2 % proof stress of composites increase with increase in volume fraction of the reinforcements. Composites containing 10 %BUC showed higher ultimate tensile strength values (UTS) compared to unreinforced alloy. However, composites with 20 %B 4 C showed lower UTS compared to that of the unreinforced alloy. This could be attributed to increased level of stress concentration and high level of plastic constraint imposed by the reinforcing jparticles or due to the presence solidification-induced defects (pores and B 4 C agglomerates). Sliding wear characteristics were evaluated at a speed of 1 m/s and at loads ranging from 0. 5 to 3. 5 kg using a pin-on-disc set up. Results show that wear resistance of Al- 5 %Mg increases with the addition of B 4 C particles. Significant improvement in wear resistance of Al- 5 %Mg is achieved with the addition of 20 % B 4 C particles. SEM examination of worn surfaces showed no pull-out of reinforcing particles even at the highest load of 3. 5 kg, thus confirming good interfacial bonding between dispersed B 4 C particles and Al alloy matrix. The neutron radiography data proved that (Al- 5 %Mg) -B 4 C composites possess good neutron absorbing characteristics. From the experimental data evaluated in the "study, it may be concluded that (Al- 5 %Mg) -B 4 C composites could be a candidate material for neutron shielding and control rod application. The enhanced elevated temperature-strength and favourable neutron absorption characteristics of these composites are strong points in favour of this material...|$|R
