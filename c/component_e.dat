40|$|A {{fundamental}} question has arisen {{as to why}} robust coherences have been observed in so many driven chemical and biophysical systems containing large numbers of <b>components</b> (<b>e.</b> g. dimers), and whether these coherences can be truly quantum mechanical. Because of these systems' inherent many-body complexity, theoretical treatments to date have made approximations such as limiting the number N of system <b>components</b> (<b>e.</b> g. one dimer N= 1), truncating non-Markovian effects, and treating aspects of the system as stochastic or averaged. Here we avoid these assumptions by analyzing the exact real-time evolution of a driven, generic out-of-equilibrium vibrational-electronic system that comprises an arbitrary number of <b>components</b> (<b>e.</b> g. dimers) N. Our results predict that {{a new form of}} dynamically-driven quantum coherence can arise surprisingly easily for general N and without having to access the empirically challenging strong-coupling regime. The resulting electronic-vibrational entanglement is driven by the speed of changes in the internal dynamics, and is accompanied by distinct yet complementary non-classicalities within each subsystem that have eluded previous analyses. Our findings show robustness to losses and noise, and have functional implications at the systems level {{for a wide range of}} chemical, biophysical and also physical systems.

40|$|Consider a firm {{selling a}} {{configurable}} product (e. g., a computer), {{which is a}} combination of a required <b>component</b> (<b>e.</b> g., processor) and an optional <b>component</b> (<b>e.</b> g., a speaker). Each component's assortment allows the consumer to choose from several variants (e. g., processors with different speeds, speakers in different styles). The demands for the two components are complementary: broadening the assortment of one component, or decreasing the price of one of its variants, would increase the demand for the other component. We find that, at optimality, all variants of a <b>component</b> (<b>e.</b> g., all processors offered by the firm) share the same "effective profit margin," which is a function of not only the selling price and the unit cost, but also the unit underage and overage costs, service level, and demand variability. As for assortment selection, we show the importance of a variant's "surplus," which is the difference between the customers utility from a variant and the costs incurred by the firm for the variant (including inventory-related costs). When choosing from two variants that belong to the same <b>component</b> (<b>e.</b> g., two processors with different speeds), the firm should pick the one with the higher surplus. However, when choosing from two variants that belong to different components (e. g., a new processor versus a new speaker), the firm must rely on a measure that we call the "attraction" of a product configuration, which increases in the surpluses of variants that make up the configuration. When choosing from two variants that belong to different components, the firm must compare the total attraction of new product configurations enabled by the addition of each variant. In addition, we show that if the optional component's assortment and margin influence the customer's decision to purchase from the firm, then the optional component must bear zero effective margin.
