Italy cited a clause in the Triple Alliance treaty which only bound it to enter in case of aggression against one of the treaty members, and so remained neutral - for the time being.|$|E

5000|$|On 19 June, Mussolini {{ordered his}} generals to seek {{contact with the}} enemy, and at 2050 hours Roatta sent a {{directive}} to [...] "undertake small offensive operations immediately {{to make contact with}} the enemy everywhere, to decisively harass enemy forces as harshly as possible." [...] The main offensive was to begin [...] "as soon as possible and no later than 23 June" [...] (al più presto possibile ... non oltre il 23 corrente). On the morning of 20 June, Mussolini told Badoglio to start the offensive immediately by the next morning, stating [...] "I do not want to suffer the shame of the Germans occupying Nice and remitting it to us." [...] Badoglio ordered Graziani: [...] "Tomorrow, the 21st, at the <b>commencement</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> at 0300 hours, the First and Fourth Armies will whole-heartedly attack along the entire front. Goal: penetrate as deeply as possible into French territory." [...] At 1745 hours that day, Graziani ordered Army Group West:The Germans have occupied Lyon, it must be categorically avoided that they arrive first at the sea. By three-o'-clock tonight 3:00 a.m., you must attack along the whole front from the Little Saint Bernard to the sea (per questa notte alle 3 dovete attaccare su tutta la fronte dal San Bernardo al mare). The air force will contribute by mass bombardment of the fortifications and cities. The Germans, during the day tomorrow and the day after, will send armoured columns originating from Lyon in the direction of Chambéry, Saint-Pierre de Chartreuse and Grenoble.Graziani then modified his directive of 16 June: now, the main goal of the offensive was Marseille. This final edition of the offensive plan had only two main actions, Operation M through the Little Saint Bernard and Operation R along the Riviera, the action in the Maddalena Pass being reduced to a diversionary advance. The immediate objective of Operation M was Albertville, while that of R was the town of Menton. At 2000 hours on 20 June, Mussolini countermanded the attack order, but before it could go out to the troops, he received confirmation that Germany was continuing its push down the Rhône valley despite the impending armistice. He then revoked his countermand, only shifting the emphasis to the northern sector of the front, as his generals had urged all along.On 20 June, the guns of Fort Chaberton—nicknamed a [...] "battleship in the clouds" [...] (cuirassé des nuages) by the French—switched targets to Ouvrage Janus. This French position was unable to train its battery of six guns on the Italian position and return fire. Due to the supporting fire of the fort, the Italian troops were able to advance and capture the village of Montgenèvre. However, no further gains were made in the Briançon sector as the French were able to hold the line. On 21 June, the French had been able to maneuver a battery of 280-mm mortars of the 154th Artillery Regiment into a position {{at the foot of the}} Fort de l'Infernet to fire on Fort Chaberton. Over a three-day period, with firing delayed and interrupted by adverse weather, the French were able to silence six of the eight armoured turrets of the Italian fort in only 57 shots. Obscured by fog, the remaining two turrets continued to fire until the armistice.|$|E
