Section ‘Cloud monitoring requirements’ presents a set of requirements for <b>cloud</b> <b>monitoring</b> tools derived from literature, which are used to judge the effectiveness of current monitoring tools and their appropriateness to <b>cloud</b> <b>monitoring.</b> Section ‘Survey of general monitoring systems’ surveys monitoring systems which predate cloud computing but are frequently referred to as tools used in <b>cloud</b> <b>monitoring.</b> Section ‘Cloud monitoring systems’ surveys monitoring tools which were designed, from the outset for cloud computing. Section ‘Monitoring as a service tools’ surveys a monitoring as a service tools, a recent development which abstracts much of the complexity of monitoring away from the user. Section ‘Taxonomy’ extrapolates a taxonomy from the surveyed tools and categorises them accordingly. We then use this taxonomy to identity how well current tools address the issues of <b>cloud</b> <b>monitoring</b> and analyse the future potential of <b>cloud</b> <b>monitoring</b> tools. Section ‘Monitoring as an engineering practice’ considers monitoring from a practical standpoint, discussing the socio-technical and organisational concerns that underpin the implementation of any monitoring strategy.

40|$|According to {{a report}} of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2007) one of the largest {{uncertainties}} in predicting climate change is the coupling between clouds and the Earth's climate system. Cirrus clouds (or ice crystal clouds) are one of the specific type of clouds that are the main responsible of such uncertainty in predicting climate change. At any time in the midlatitudes, cirrus can cover about 30 % of the Earth's surface, and in the Tropics this coverage can increase to about 60 - 70 %. With such a spatial and temporal coverage it is not hardly surprising that cirrus is {{an important component of the}} Earth-atmosphere radiation balance and hydrological cycle. Our knowledge on radar meteorology and on 77 GHz automotive radars, used also for rain monitoring, will allow us to electromagnetically characterize the cirrus and develop a preliminary study to use a 75 GHz radar (IEEE V-band) for <b>clouds</b> <b>monitoring.</b> The idea of the work is to formulate the scattering mechanism occurring at 75 GHz in the cirrus (potentially using and extend already existent ice-crystal model) in order to accomplish the following feasibility analysis of a small radar operating at such frequency. This radar could be carried on-board on a HAPS, in order to extend the HAPS and satellite Earth observation activities and available technologies. Therefore, the presented activity is divided into 2 sections: 1) The cirrus scattering model at 75 GHz. The scientific literature present different scattering models for lower frequency bands, with respect to IEEE V-band, and for the 94 GHz Cloud Sat vertical cloud-profiling radar. The study will fill the gap and present the advantages of using this frequency band, potentially also in cooperations with the others. 2) The feasibility analysis of a radar operating at such frequency for cirrus <b>clouds</b> <b>monitoring...</b>|$|R
30|$|Cloud {{computing}} owes many of {{its features}} to previous paradigms of computing. Many of the properties inherent to cloud computing originate from cluster, grid, service orientated, enterprise, peer to peer and distributed computing. However, as an intersection of these areas, cloud computing is unique. The differences between <b>cloud</b> <b>monitoring</b> and previous monitoring challenges has been explored in literature [22],[23]. A previous survey of <b>cloud</b> <b>monitoring</b> [24] has addressed the challenges inherent to cloud computing. Examination of the challenges presented in the literature {{in combination with the}} well established NIST definition allow us to derive a set of requirements for a <b>cloud</b> <b>monitoring</b> framework. These requirements provide a benchmark against which to judge current systems. An ideal system will focus on and fulfil each of these requirements; realistically monitoring tools will focus predominantly upon one of these requirements with lesser or no support for the others. Importantly, we differentiate our survey from [24] by focusing upon the design and internals of current tools and taxonomies these tools accordingly, as opposed to focusing upon the requirements and open issues of <b>cloud</b> <b>monitoring.</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract — <b>Cloud</b> <b>Monitoring</b> plays {{a crucial}} role in {{providing}} application guarantees like performance, availability, and security. We can understand cloud computing as technologies that rely on the Internet to satisfy the computing needs of users, who do not generally own the physical infrastructure.

Users can choose the services they want and access them from a web browser, while the software and data are stored on third party's company. <b>Cloud</b> <b>Monitoring</b> is an Integral part of maintenance. Requirement for a monitoring solution for cloud are totally different from legacy and virtualized Monitoring Environment. There are many third party solutions are available for <b>cloud</b> <b>monitoring.</b> But there is lack of standard model which covers all required parameter needed to be covered in solution so that an exhaustive report can be produced for service provider.
