40|$|M. Tech. (Biotechnology) Abstract: Due to the {{depletion}} of rich ore bodies, the fact that conventional extractions become obsolete and uneconomical and additional stringency on environment related regulations, there is a call for cheaper and greener metal extraction methods. Through research and innovation, new developments and improvements of processes and products are required in both metallurgical and biological areas. As a result, research interests {{in the use of}} microbes in the optimization of metal recovery from low grade sulphide ores have grown increasingly popular. The involvement of microbes in the recovery process is thus dependent on the growth of the microbes, which is influenced by their physicochemical parameters. The availability of nutrient salts is thus essential for maintaining optimal growth, furthermore is the dependence of metal dissolution with nutrient quantities on substrate accessibility. Considering the “green chemistry” of some ionic liquids the important “technological”, “toxicological ” and “eco-toxicological” assessment of the risks related with ionic liquid design; choline based ionic liquids were selected by virtue of their low toxicity, low environmental persistence and readily biodegradable nature. As a result of the selective solubility strength of metal oxides in ionic liquids, choline based ionic liquids were considered novel media for obtaining target metals and improving bioleaching kinetics. The study thus sought to develop an economic and eco-friendly alternative technology, employing choline based ionic liquids as biocompatible substrates for the optimal recovery of base metals, improving bioleaching kinetics. Biological and molecular characterization of ultra-deep mine isolates (Gold 1 Mine East Rand, Springs Johannesburg, South Africa) revealed a halophilic community of gram positive and negative bacteria namely Raoultella ornithinolytica, Bacillus sp., Bacillus thuringiensis and Pseudomonas moraviensis. The halophilic bacterial strains indicated high biocompatibility in choline lactate, choline chlorite, choline dihydrogen phosphate, <b>choline</b> <b>citrate</b> and choline levulinate with poor biocompatibility noted in <b>choline</b> <b>citrate</b> and choline tartarate. According to literature, the biocompatibility of the leading choline based ionic liquids (ILs) was accredited to the quaternary- ammonium cation integrating a polar hydroxyl and the limited branching of the side chain. Prominent logarithmic growth in choline lactate was indicative of the metabolic advantage of choline lactate over conventional glucose sources. Furthermore, the bioleaching of BCL slag by Bacillus species and Bacillus [...] ...|$|E

We have carried out metabolite profiling analyses of transgenic tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) fruit engineered to accumulate the higher polyamines spermidine (Spd) and spermine (Spm) to bring an insight into the metabolic processes that Spd/Spm regulate in plants. NMR spectroscopic analysis revealed distinct metabolite trends in the transgenic and wild-type/azygous fruits ripened off the vine. Distinct metabolites (glutamine, asparagine, <b>choline,</b> <b>citrate,</b> fumarate, malate, and an unidentified compound A) accumulated in the red transgenic fruit, while the levels of valine, aspartic acid, sucrose, and glucose were significantly lower {{as compared to the}} control (wild-type and azygous) red fruit. The levels of isoleucine, glucose, gamma-aminobutyrate, phenylalanine, and fructose remained similar in the nontransgenic and transgenic fruits. Statistical treatment of the metabolite variables distinguished the control fruits from the transgenic fruit and provided credence to the pronounced, differential metabolite profiles seen during ripening of the transgenic fruits. The pathways involved in the nitrogen sensing/signaling and carbon metabolism seem preferentially activated in the high Spd/Spm transgenics. The metabolite profiling analysis suggests that Spd and Spm are perceived as nitrogenous metabolites by the fruit cells, which in turn results in the stimulation of carbon sequestration. This is seen manifested in higher respiratory activity and up-regulation of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase and NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase transcripts in the transgenic fruit compared to controls, indicating high metabolic status of the transgenics even late in fruit ripening...|$|E
40|$|Prostate {{cancer is}} the most common cancer {{diagnosed}} in men. Prostate cancer shows an insidious onset and screening programs are used worldwide for the early diagnosis of prostate cancer. Checking serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) is most commonly used for this purpose. In the case of PSA elevation, the patients are routinely referred for transrectal ultrasonography-guided biopsy of the prostate. In some occasions despite several biopsy attempts, prostate cancer is not diagnosed. "nMultivoxel H 1 magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) of the prostate with the use of endorectal coils is a valuable method that aids in the diagnosis of prostate cancer. The peripheral zone of the prostate normally contains high concentrations of citrate and low amounts of choline. When the tumoral cells of prostate cancer grow within the peripheral zone, they substitute the normal cells and decrease the amount of citrate. On the other hand because of the high turnover of tumoral cells and their rapid growth, choline increases in the tumoral region. The result of these changes is elevation of the <b>choline</b> to <b>citrate</b> ratio in prostate cancer. "nIn the multivoxel H 1 magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we divide the prostate to multiple small voxels and measure the amount of <b>choline</b> and <b>citrate</b> in each volume and evaluate the <b>choline</b> to <b>citrate</b> ratio.

It is {{involved}} in the osmotic adaptation of eukaryotic and bacterial cells, and accumulates up to 1 M inside cells subjected to an osmotic upshock. Since, like other osmolytes, it can act as a protein stabilizer, its thermoprotectant properties were investigated.

In vivo, the internal concentration of glycine betaine is neither increased nor decreased after heat shock (this contrasts with a massive increase after osmotic upshock). However, even in exponential-phase bacteria grown in usual minimal salts media, the internal glycine betaine concentration attains levels (around 50 mM) which can protect proteins against thermodenaturation in vitro.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Inclusion of 3 -dimensional H {{magnetic}} resonance spectroscopic imaging (3 D-H-MRSI) in routine multiparametric MRI {{of the prostate}} requires good quality spectra and easy interpretable metabolite maps of the whole organ obtained without endorectal coil in clinically feasible acquisition times. We evaluated if a semi-LASER pulse sequence with gradient offset independent adiabaticity refocusing pulses (GOIA-sLASER) for volume selection can meet these requirements. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirteen patients with suspicion of prostate cancer and 1 patient known to have prostate cancer were examined at 3 T with a multichannel body-receive coil. A 3 D-H-MRSI sequence with GOIA-sLASER volume selection (echo time, 88 milliseconds) was added to a routine clinical multiparametric MRI examination of these patients. Repetition times from 630 to 1000 milliseconds and effective voxel sizes of approximately 0. 9 and 0. 6 cm were tested. Spectral components were quantified by LCModel software for quality assessment and to construct <b>choline</b> and <b>citrate</b> maps. RESULTS: Three-dimensional MRSI of the prostate was successfully performed in all patients in measurement times of 5 to 10 minutes. Analysis of the multiparametric MRI examination or of biopsies did not reveal malignant tissue in the prostate of the 13 patients. In 1404 evaluated voxels acquired from 13 patients, the citrate resonance could be fitted with a high reliability (Cramer-Rao lower bound < 30 %), 100 % for 7 x 7 x 7 -mm voxels and 96 +/- 7 in 6 x 6 x 6 -mm voxels. The percentage of 7 x 7 x 7 -mm voxels in which the choline signal was fitted with Cramer-Rao lower bound of less than 30 % was approximately 50 % at a TR of 630 milliseconds and increased to more than 80 % for TRs of 800 milliseconds and above. In the patient with prostate cancer, choline was detectable throughout the prostate in spectra recorded at a TR of 700 milliseconds. The homogeneous B 1 field over the prostate of the receive coil enabled the generation of whole organ metabolite maps, revealing <b>choline</b> and <b>citrate</b> variations between areas with normal prostate tissue, seminal vesicles, proliferative benign prostatic hyperplasia, and tumor. CONCLUSIONS: The good signal-to-noise ratio and low chemical shift artifacts of GOIA-sLASER at an echo time of 88 milliseconds enable acquisition of high-quality 3 D-H-MRSI of the prostate without endorectal coil in less than 10 minutes.

The necessity of a non-invasive technique for the diagnosis of PCa in early stage has grown through years. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1 H-MRS) and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging (1 H-MRSI) are advanced magnetic resonance techniques that can mark the presence of metabolites such as <b>citrate,</b> <b>choline,</b> creatine and polyamines in a selected voxel, or in an array of voxels (in MRSI) inside prostatic tissue. Abundance or lack of these metabolites can discriminate between pathological and healthy tissue. Although the use of magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is well established in brain and liver with dedicated software for spectral analysis, quantification of metabolites in prostate can be very difficult to achieve, due to poor signal to noise ratio and strong J-coupling of the citrate. The aim of this work is to develop a software prototype for automatic quantification of <b>citrate,</b> <b>choline</b> and creatine in prostate. Its core is an original fitting routine that makes use of a fixed step gradient descent minimization algorithm (FSGD) and MRS simulations developed with the GAMMA libraries in C++. The accurate simulation of the citrate spin systems allows to predict the correct J-modulation under different NMR sequences and under different coupling parameters.

This {{study was designed}} to assess the diagnostic value of magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in prostatic carcinoma and its compatibility with prostatic specific antigen (PSA) as the conventional method. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, we recruited 139 patients with previous radical prostatectomy referring to Radiology department of Hazrate-e-Rasul Hospital {{during the first half of}} 2011 for the evaluation of local recurrence. Traditionally, local recurrence is defined as serum PSA concentration > 0. 2 ng/dl. We used 1. 5 -tesla Siemens Avanto MRI unit with endorectal coil and measured creatine, <b>choline</b> and <b>citrate</b> levels before calculating choline-creatine/citrate ratio. Correlation between MRS findings with PSA concentration was evaluated in regards to the multiple levels of the previously mentioned ratio. Results: Local recurrence was found in 107 (77 %) patients based on PSA levels. The mean values for serum PSA levels and creatine-choline/citrate ratio were significantly different in patients with and without local recurrence. Creatine-choline/citrate ratios greater than 50, 100 and 150 (as different cut-off points of recurrence) were respectively seen in 104, 102 and 97 patients and agreement ratio between MRS and PSA in these levels were 94. 1 %, 94. 4 % and 85. 1 %, respectively.

Materials and methods. MRI, MRSI and DCE-MRI with a 3 -Tesla whole-body scanner were. performed in 30 patients with biopsy-proven prostate cancer before radical prostatectoray. High-resolution T 2 -weighted turbo spin echo (TSE) images were evaluated for visualisation of the peripheral zone, central gland, visibility of the cancer lesion, prostatic capsule delineation and overall image quality according to a five-point scale. Relative levels of the prostate metabolites <b>citrate,</b> <b>choline</b> and creatine were determined in cancer and in the normal peripheral zone (PZ) and central gland (CG). Spectra were also evaluated for the separation of the signal of <b>citrate,</b> <b>choline</b> and creatine and suppression of lipid and water signals. Time-intensity curves were obtained for prostatic cancer and healthy PZ and CG from DCE-MRI. Finally, time of arrival, time to peak, maximum enhancement and wash-in rate in cancer, normal PZ and CG were calculated. Results. The high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at 3 Tesla provided T 2 -weighted TSE images with excellent anatomical detail (in-plane voxel size of 0. 22 x 0. 22 mm) and good T 2 contrast. The increased spectral resolution was sufficient to separate the choline and creatine resonances and allow delineation of the four peaks of <b>citrate</b> resonance. The (<b>choline</b> + creatine) /citrate ratio was elevated in cancer in comparison with PZ and CG (p< 0. 001). Dynamic contrast-enhanced images showed good temporal resolution. All parameters obtained from DCE-MRI showed a statistically significant (P< 0. 05) difference between cancer tissue and normal PZ and CG. Wash-in rate and (choline+creatine) /citrate ratio were significantly correlated (r= 0. 713, P= 0. 001) in PZ cancer, whereas the correlation was not significant (r= 0. 617, P= 0. 06) in CG and in PZ (r= 0. 530, P= 0. 08).

Methods and Materials: Between January 2008 and April 2010, 24 patients with localized prostate cancer were prospectively enrolled in the Evaluation of the Response to Irradiation with MR Spectroscopy (ERIS) trial. All the patients had been treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy with or without long-term adjuvant hormonal therapy (LTHT) and underwent 3 -T MRS and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) assays at baseline and every 3 months thereafter up to 12 months. Results: After radiation, the mean normalized citrate level (citrate/water) decreased significantly over time, both in the peripheral zone (PZ) (p = 0. 0034) and in the entire prostate (p = 0. 0008), whereas no significant change was observed in mean normalized choline levels (choline/water) in the PZ (p = 0. 84) and in the entire prostate (p = 0. 95). At 6 months after radiation, the mean choline level was significantly lower in the PZ for patients with a PSAvalue of <= 0. 5 ng/mL at 12 months (4. 9 +/- 1. 7 vs. 7. 1 +/- 1. 5, p = 0. 0378). Similar results were observed at 12 months in the PZ (6. 2 +/- 2. 3 vs. 11. 4 +/- 4. 1, p = 0. 0117 for choline level and 3. 4 +/- 0. 7 vs. 16. 1 +/- 6. 1, p = 0. 0054 for citrate level) and also in the entire prostate (6. 2 +/- 1. 9 vs. 10. 4 +/- 3. 2, p = 0. 014 for choline level and 3. 0 +/- 0. 8 vs. 13. 3 +/- 4. 7, p = 0. 0054 for citrate level).

40|$|AbstractObjectiveOne of {{the most}} common forms of bladder {{dysfunction}} is related to the development of unstable bladder contractions (bladder overactivity). Solifenacin is a relatively new, selective, antimuscarinic agent that {{has been shown to be}} particularly useful in the treatment of overactive bladder (OAB) dysfunctions in both men and women. Experimentally, we have demonstrated that OAB and obstructive bladder dysfunction are associated with the generation of free radicals and oxidative damage to the bladder. The hypothesis tested was that solifenacin + coenzyme Q 10  + α-lipoic acid (CoQ + LA) would be more effective in the treatment of OAB than either would be individually. Materials and methodsForty-eight male White New Zealand rabbits were separated into 8 groups of 6 rabbits each. The following oral treatments were given to each group: Groups 1 and 5, vehicle (saline); Groups 2 and 6, solifenacin; Groups 3 and 7, CoQ + LA; Groups 4 and 8, solifenacin + CoQ + LA. After three weeks of treatment (by oral gavage), the rabbits in Groups 1 – 4 received partial outlet obstruction as detailed above. The rabbits continued their treatments for four weeks following surgery. At the end of this four-week period, immediately following urodynamic and physiological studies, the bladder was excised and the muscle and mucosa were separated and frozen for biochemical research. ResultsThe following marker enzymes were quantitated: <b>choline</b> acetyltransferase, <b>citrate</b> synthase, catalase, superoxide dismutase, and malondialdehyde (MDA, marker for lipid peroxidation). Solifenacin had no effect on citrate synthase activity of the bladder smooth muscle. However, pretreatment with both the antioxidants or the combination of solifenacin + antioxidants protected the citrate synthase activity such that it remained at control values. Partial outlet obstruction (PBOO) resulted in a 60 % decrease in choline acetyltransferase activity (ChAT) activity, while solifenacin had no effect on reduced ChAT activity. Both the antioxidant and combination therapy resulted in maintaining ChAT activity at control values. PBOO resulted in a significant increase in MDA of both the muscle and mucosa. For both tissues, all treatments resulted in a significantly lower MDA content. In general, the results demonstrate the combination of solifenacin + antioxidants was more effective than either solifenacin or antioxidants alone. ConclusionThe addition of the antioxidants CoQ + LA works synergistically with solifenacin in the treatment of obstructive bladder dysfunction and OAB...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{differentiate}} prostate carcinoma from healthy peripheral {{zone and}} central gland using quantitative dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and two-dimensional (1) H MR spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) combined into one clinical protocol. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-three prostate cancer patients were studied {{with a combined}} DCE-MRI and MRSI protocol. Cancer regions were localized by histopathology of whole mount sections after radical prostatectomy. Pharmacokinetic modeling parameters, K(trans) and k(ep), {{as well as the}} relative levels of the prostate metabolites <b>citrate,</b> <b>choline,</b> and creatine, were determined in cancer, healthy peripheral zone (PZ), and in central gland (CG). RESULTS: K(trans) and k(ep) were higher (P < 0. 05) in cancer and in CG than in normal PZ. The (choline + creatine) /citrate ratio was elevated in cancer compared to the PZ and CG (P < 0. 05). While a (choline + creatine) /citrate ratio above 0. 68 was found to be a reliable indicator of cancer, elevated K(trans) was only a reliable cancer indicator in the diagnosis of individual patients. K(trans) and (choline + creatine) /citrate ratios in cancer were poorly correlated (Pearson r(2) = 0. 07), and thus microvascular and metabolic abnormalities may have complementary value in cancer diagnosis. CONCLUSION: The combination of high-resolution spatio-vascular information from dynamic MRI and metabolic information from MRSI has excellent potential for improved localization and characterization of prostate cancer in a clinical setting.

An LCModel basis set was developed for fitting <b>choline,</b> creatine, spermine, <b>citrate,</b> and lactate and was used to fit all spectra in tumor-containing voxels. For patients without detectable lactate, the minimal detectable lactate concentration was determined by adding in all spectra of tumor tissue a simulated lactate signal. The amplitude of the simulated lactate signal was iteratively decreased until its fit reached a Cramér Rao lower bound > 20 %, which was then set as the patient-specific detection limit. RESULTS: In none of the patients a convincing lactate signal was found. We estimated that on average the lactate levels in high grade prostate cancer are below 1. 5 mM (range 0. 9 - 3. 5 mM), Interestingly, in one patient with extensive necrosis in the tumor biopsy samples (Gleason score 5 + 5), large lipid resonances were observed, which originated from the tumor. CONCLUSION: The minimal detectable lactate concentration of 1. 5 mM in high grade prostate cancer indicates that if lactate is increased it remains at low concentrations.

40|$|Clinical {{applications}} of magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) {{for the study}} of brain and prostate cancer have expanded significantly over the past 10 years. Proton MRSI studies of the brain and prostate have demonstrated the feasibility of noninvasively assessing human cancers based on metabolite levels before and after therapy in a clinically reasonable amount of time. MRSI provides a unique biochemical “window” to study cellular metabolism noninvasively. MRSI studies have demonstrated dramatic spectral differences between normal brain tissue (low choline and high N-acetyl aspartate, NAA) and prostate (low <b>choline</b> and high <b>citrate)</b> compared to brain (low NAA, high choline) and prostate (low <b>citrate,</b> high <b>choline)</b> tumors. The presence of edema and necrosis in both the prostate and brain was reflected by a reduction of the intensity of all resonances due to reduced cell density. MRSI was able to discriminate necrosis (absence of all metabolites, except lipids and lactate) from viable normal tissue and cancer following therapy. The results of current MRSI studies also provide evidence that the magnitude of metabolic changes in regions of cancer before therapy as well as the magnitude and time course of metabolic changes after therapy can improve our understanding of cancer aggressiveness and mechanisms of therapeutic response. Clinically, combined MRI/MRSI has already demonstrated the potential for improved diagnosis, staging and treatment planning of brain and prostate cancer. Additionally, studies are under way to determine the accuracy of anatomic and metabolic parameters in providing an objective quantitative basis for assessing disease progression and response to therapy...|$|R
40|$|Proton {{magnetic}} resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) {{of the prostate}} has been used with only a combination of external surface coils. The quality of spectral fitting of the (choline[*]+[*]creatine) /citrate ([Cho[*]+[*]Cr]/Cit) ratio at different field strengths and different coils is important for quantitative/semi-quantitative diagnosis of prostate cancer. To evaluate the quality of spectral fitting of the (Cho[*]+[*]Cr) /Cit ratio of a prostate phantom using MRSI at different field strengths and various coils. Experiments were using 1. 5 -T and 3. 0 -T MR systems. Measurements were taken on a homemade prostate phantom with different coils: spinal array; abdominal array; and endorectal. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of <b>choline,</b> creatine, and <b>citrate</b> peaks {{as well as the}} (Cho[*]+[*]Cr) /Cit ratio in each voxel were compared among groups using multi-way analysis of variance. Magnetic field strength, coils, and plane position had a significant effect on the SNR or (Cho[*]+[*]Cr) /Cit ratio, and there were interactions among groups (all P[*]=[*] 0. 000). The 1. 5 -T (0. 228 [*]±[*] 0. 044) exhibited a higher (Cho[*]+[*]Cr) /Cit ratio than the 3. 0 -T (0. 125 [*]±[*] 0. 041) magnetic field strength (F[*]=[*] 3238, P[*]=[*] 0. 000). The (Cho[*]+[*]Cr) /Cit ratio of both surface coils (0. 183 [*]±[*] 0. 065) and all coils (0. 181 [*]±[*] 0. 057) was significantly lower than that of the endorectal coil (0. 195 [*]±[*] 0. 077) (both P[*] [*] 0. 05). No significant differences were found among the (Cho[*]+[*]Cr) /Cit ratios of all voxels in the middle planes by the post-hoc analyses (all P[*]>[*] 0. 05). Three-dimensional proton MRSI of prostate metabolites in a phantom using surface coils is feasible and reliable, but (Cho[*]+[*]Cr) /Cit ratios acquired at different magnetic fields and coils were different. This difference should be taken into account when calculating this ratio in a field strength-independent way...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this {{experiment}} is {{to determine whether there}} is a difference in metabolic response to Cycling 2 ̆ 6 Vinyasa Yoga. METHODS: Six male and six female participants aged 19 - 35 participated in two exercise sessions spaced 1 week apart. The participants fasted 12 hours prior to a one hour Vinyasa yoga session, and again prior to a 1 -hour session of stationary cycling the following week. Heart rate was collected at predetermined time points during the Vinyasa yoga session. In order to normalize the level of intensity in both exercise bouts, participants pedaled at a pace that matched their individual heart rate during the yoga session. Urine samples were collected from participants before and immediately after the yoga and cycling exercise bouts. Urine samples were frozen at - 80 Fahrenheit, and later analyzed using a Bruker 600 1 H-NMR running TopSpin 2. 0 software. We were able to determine the identity of 13 metabolites with certainty. These metabolites are as follows: phelylalanine, creatinine, creatine, creatine/creatinine, glycine, <b>choline,</b> taurine, dimethylamine, <b>citrate,</b> pyruvate, alanine, lactate, and beta hydroxybutyrate. The data was analyzed using a combination of analytical techniques, including paired t-test, a bucketing strategy, and MetaboAnalyst 2. 0. RESULTS: We found {{no significant difference in the}} metabolites excreted in the urine between different exercise regimens. CONCLUSION: Exercise intensity and/or lack of adequate sampling may have influenced the lack of significant differences with regard to urine metabolite levels in this study. Although our study did not find any significant change in metabolites, the application of this methodological approach has merit. For example, this methodology could be used to study changes in metabolic pathways in many different environments that include logistical and/or cultural considerations, where urine samples could be collected and then transported for analysis via 1 H-NMR.

40|$|Deoxynivalenol (DON) has various {{toxicological}} effects in humans and pigs {{that result from}} the ingestion of contaminated cereal products. This {{study was conducted to}} investigate the protective effects of dietary supplementation with glutamic acid on piglets challenged with DON. A total of 20 piglets weaned at 28 d of age were randomly assigned to receive 1 of 4 treatments (5 piglets/treatment) : 1) basal diet, negative control (NC); 2) basal diet + 4 mg/kg DON (DON); 3) basal diet + 2 % (g/g) glutamic acid (GLU); 4) basal diet + 4 mg/kg DON + 2 % glutamic acid (DG). A 7 -d adaptation period was followed by 30 days of treatment. A metabolite analysis using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1 H-NMR) -based metabolomic technology and the determination of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities for plasma, as well as the activity of Caspase- 3 and the proliferation of epithelial cells were conducted. The results showed that contents of low-density lipoprotein, alanine, arginine, acetate, glycoprotein, trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), glycine, lactate, and urea, as well as the glutamate/creatinine ratio were higher but high-density lipoprotein, proline, <b>citrate,</b> <b>choline,</b> unsaturated lipids and fumarate were lower in piglets of DON treatment than that of NC treatment (P< 0. 05). Compared with DON treatment, dietary supplementation with glutamic acid increased the plasma concentrations of proline, citrate, creatinine, unsaturated lipids, and fumarate, and decreased the concentrations of alanine, glycoprotein, TMAO, glycine, and lactate, as well as the glutamate/creatinine ratio (P< 0. 05). Addition glutamic acid to DON treatment increased the plasma activities of SOD and GSH-Px and the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) labeling indexes for the jejunum and ileum (P< 0. 05). These novel findings indicate that glutamic acid has the potential to repair the injuries associated with oxidative stress as well as the disturbances of energy and amino acid metabolism induced by DON...|$|R
40|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} spectroscopy (MRS) {{has been}} shown to have great clinical potential as a supplement to magnetic resonance imaging in the detection of prostate cancer (CaP). MRS provides functional information in the form of changes in the relative concentration of specific metabolites including <b>choline,</b> creatine, and <b>citrate</b> which can be used to identify potential areas of CaP. With a view to assisting radiologists in interpretation and analysis of MRS data, some researchers have begun to develop computer-aided detection (CAD) schemes for CaP identification from spectroscopy. Most of these schemes have been centered on identifying and integrating the area under metabolite peaks which is then used to compute relative metabolite ratios. However, manual identification of metabolite peaks on the MR spectra, and especially via CAD, is a challenging problem due to low signal-to-noise ratio, baseline irregularity, peak overlap, and peak distortion. In this article the authors present a novel CAD scheme that integrates nonlinear dimensionality reduction (NLDR) with an unsupervised hierarchical clustering algorithm to automatically identify suspicious regions on the prostate using MRS and hence avoids the need to explicitly identify metabolite peaks. The methodology comprises two stages. In stage 1, a hierarchical spectral clustering algorithm is used to distinguish between extracapsular and prostatic spectra in order to localize the region of interest (ROI) corresponding to the prostate. Once the prostate ROI is localized, in stage 2, a NLDR scheme, in conjunction with a replicated clustering algorithm, is used to automatically discriminate between three classes of spectra (normal appearing, suspicious appearing, and indeterminate). The methodology was quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated on a total of 18 1. 5 T in vivo prostate T 2 -weighted (w) and MRS studies obtained from the multisite, multi-institutional American College of Radiology (ACRIN) trial. In the absence of the precise ground truth for CaP extent on the MR imaging for most of the ACRIN studies, probabilistic quantitative metrics were defined based on partial knowledge on the quadrant location and size of the tumor. The scheme, when evaluated against this partial ground truth, was found to have a CaP detection sensitivity of 89. 33 % and specificity of 79. 79 %. The results obtained from randomized threefold and fivefold cross validation suggest that the NLDR based clustering scheme has a higher CaP detection accuracy compared to such commonly used MRS analysis schemes as z score and PCA. In addition, the scheme was found to be robust to changes in system parameters. For 6 of the 18 studies an expert radiologist laboriously labeled each of the individual spectra according to a five point scale, with 1 ∕ 2 representing spectra that the expert considered normal and 3 ∕ 4 ∕ 5 being spectra the expert deemed suspicious. When evaluated on these expert annotated datasets, the CAD system yielded an average sensitivity (cluster corresponding to suspicious spectra being identified as the CaP class) and specificity of 81. 39 % and 64. 71 %, respectively...|$|R
40|$|A few {{abnormal}} cells {{found in}} {{a small piece of}} prostate tissue are most consequential for a man’s future. The prevalence of prostate cancer (PCa) is increasing globally. The main instigating factor for this cancer is not yet known, but it appears to be the consequence of many variables such as an increasingly older population, more frequent PSA-testing, and factors involving lifestyle. Prostate cancer screening, as an equivalent for breast cancer screening, has been suggested but unfortunately there are no accurate diagnostic tools available for this type of screening. The reason for this is simply that the prostate {{is one of the most}} difficult organs to diagnose and, consequently, PCa screening would generate far too many false-positive and false-negative results.  The prostate is not easily accessible as it is deeply-seated in the male pelvic area, wrapped around the urethra and surrounded by sensitive vital organs.  Furthermore, PCa is frequently multi-focal, and the cancer cells have a tendency of assimilating among normal cells and, thus, do not always form solid lumps.  Therefore, prostate tumors are often not felt by digital rectal examination (DRE) or identified by imaging.   The PSA-test is not reliable as it is more prostate-specific than cancer-specific.  Due to increasing prostate awareness, more early-stage and locally confined PCa are being detected. This is saving lives, although there is a high risk of over treatment and unnecessary side-effects.  The increased detection of PCa requires sophisticated diagnostic methods and highly skilled clinicians who can discern between indolent and aggressive cancers.  The current “gold-standard” for PCa diagnosis is biopsy grading by pathologists using the Gleason score system, which is a difficult task.  Therefore, innovative methods to improve the precision of prostate diagnosis, by increased biopsy sensitivity and tumor localization, are of essence. In light of these difficulties, the metabolomic approach using 1 D and 2 D high-resolution magic angle spinning (HRMAS) NMR spectroscopy combined with histopathology on intact prostatectomy specimens was evaluated in this research project.  The non-destructive nature of HRMAS NMR enables spectroscopic analysis of intact tissue samples with consecutive histological examinations under light microscope. Metabolomics aids in the unraveling and the discovery of organ-specific endogenous metabolites that have the potential to be reliable indicators of organ function and viability, extrinsic and intrinsic perturbations, as well as valuable markers for treatment response. The results may, therefore, be applied clinically to characterize an organ by utilizing biomarkers that have the capacity to distinguish between disease and health. The aim was to characterize the human and the rat prostate in terms of its intermediary metabolism, which I show here to differ between species and anatomical regions.  Furthermore, the aim is to seek the verification of HRMAS NMR derived metabolites which are known to be a part of the prostate metabolome such as, <b>citrate,</b> <b>choline,</b> and the polyamines which were performed, but also the identification of metabolites not previously identified as part of the local prostate metabolism, such as Omega- 6, which was detected in tumors.  The extended aim was to elucidate novel bio-markers with clinical potential. In this study, the common phyto-nutrient, inositol, which appears to possess protective properties, was identified as being a potentially important PCa bio-marker for the distinction between the more indolent Gleason score 6 and the more aggressive Gleason score 7 in non-malignant prostate tissues with tumors elsewhere in the organ. Further studies in this area of PCa research are therefore warranted...|$|R
