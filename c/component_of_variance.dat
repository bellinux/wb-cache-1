The present study discusses how to use such prior information on the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) to obtain inferences about differences among treatments in the face of no replication. Several strategies that use the ICC are recommended for different situations and various designs. Their properties are investigated. Work is extended to under-replicated experiments. The work has a Bayesian flavor but avoids the full Bayesian analysis, which has computational complexities and the potential for lack of acceptance among many applied researchers.

40|$|Summary: Statistical {{analysis}} of variance was applied to data from determinations of 14 plasma constituents in 25 rats in order to evaluate the analytical * experimental and biological (inter-and intraindividual) <b>component</b> <b>of</b> <b>variance.</b> Blood was taken seven times in intervals of 8 — 10 days, the last one by catheter technique and the other by heart puncture. The analytical portion of variance was determined by the concurrent {{analysis of}} a pool plasma Standard. The experimental <b>component</b> <b>of</b> <b>variance</b> was evaluated by the comparison of the Variation of the catheter values with that of the pooled data froin heart puncture. The coefficient of Variation for the latter may be grouped into three categories: less than 10 % for protein, Na+, K+, Ca 2 +; 10 — 20 % for urea, phosphate and the enzymes äs alanine aminotransferase, choline esterase, alkaline phosphatase and leucine arylamidase and 20 ^- 65 % for the other enzymes lactate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase, as-partate aminotransferase and creatine kinase.

For example, a meta-analysis of prophylactic antibiotics (intervention) in elective arterial reconstruction (disease) for rates of wound infection (outcome). However, because systematic reviews and meta-analyses are so widespread, {{a body of}} evidence often exists around specific intervention effects on particular outcomes over a range of diseases. So for example, a multitude of independent meta-analyses have evaluated rates of wound infection with and {{without the use of}} prophylactic antibiotics over multiple surgery types. A systematic review of systematic reviews is a means of synthesising evidence for the same intervention over multiple disease types. We propose a panoramic meta-analysis as a means of pooling effect estimates over systematic reviews of systematic reviews. We explore several methods ranging from a simple two-step approach, to a meta-regression or mixed effects approach, where variation between diseases are modelled as fixed covariate effects and between-study variation by random effects, and to a three-level hierarchical model in which exchangeability is assumed, which allows both a between-disease <b>component</b> <b>of</b> <b>variance</b> and a between-study (within disease) <b>component</b> <b>of</b> <b>variance.</b> In the surgery example, we pool 18 meta-analyses (each including between 4 and 26 studies) of prophylactic antibiotics reporting rates of wound infection from 18 different surgery sites to obtain a single pooled estimate of effect and estimates of between-disease, within-disease and within-study variability.

The results showed that there were highly significant correlations between body weights from 4 to 16 wk of age. There were no correlations between hatch weight and weights at the other ages.
