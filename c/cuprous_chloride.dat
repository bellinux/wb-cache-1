Certain process technology selectively removes carbon monoxide by complexation/decomplexation of carbon monoxide with <b>cuprous</b> aluminum <b>chloride</b> (...) dissolved in an organic liquid such as toluene. The purified carbon monoxide can have a purity greater than 99%, which makes it a good feedstock for the chemical industry. The reject gas from the system can contain carbon dioxide, nitrogen, methane, ethane, and hydrogen. The reject gas can be further processed on a pressure swing adsorption system to remove hydrogen, and the hydrogen and carbon monoxide can be recombined in the proper ratio for catalytic methanol production, Fischer-Tropsch diesel, etc. Cryogenic purification, being very energy-intensive, is not well suited to simply making fuel, because of the greatly reduced net energy gain.|$|R

Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) measurements revealed that the average surface area of the films covered by the CuCl nanocrystals was ≈ 4060 % of its total surface area. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) revealed that the average roughness of the film increases with the annealing time. Room temperature UVVis absorption revealed both Z 1, 2 and Z 3 excitonic absorption features at ≈ 368 nm (≈ 3. 37 eV) and ≈ 377 nm (≈ 3. 29 eV), respectively. Room temperature photoluminescence (PL) and cathodoluminescence (CL) measurements exhibit strong emission in the UV region. Electronic transitions of the CuCl hybrid films were studied using temperature and power dependent PL spectroscopy measurements. Thermal quenching of the Z 3 free exciton PL emission in hybrid films has been observed. The biexciton emission peak intensity follows a quadratic dependency on power in the excitation power range < 10 kWcm 2. The results obtained for the CuCl hybrid films are comparable to those of vacuum evaporated and sputtered CuCl films reported in the literature. Room temperature electrical characterization and electroluminescence (EL) emission were investigated using Au/CuCl hybrid film/ITO structures. Field dependent DC conduction studies exhibit ohmic conduction in the lower field region and electrode limited Schottky emission type conduction for higher field regions. The device showed bright electroluminescent emission at ~ 384 nm when subjected to an AC voltage of about 100 volts peak to peak. One challenge linked with the use of CuCl is that it is sensitive to moist air, i. e. CuCl is not stable in ambient conditions; it forms oxyhalides of Cu(II) within a few days of exposure to air. The ageing effects on CuCl hybrid films were extensively investigated and this research indicates that the blend of CuCl with an organic material in particular PSSQ may be a useful interim solution to the degradation of CuCl films. Proofofconcept pCuCl/nZnO heterojunction diodes were fabricated and their structural, optical and electrical properties were investigated. XRD measurements confirm that no intermediate compound forms at the heterojunction. Room temperature IV characteristics show diodelike behaviour with the values of barrier height and ideality factor equal to 0. 72 eV and 4. 6, respectively. This structure could be useful for photovoltaic cell fabrication, particularly for the blue/UV spectral regions...|$|R

Thus, reaction of the intermediate with pyrrolidine gives dienamine (5). This transformation emphasizes the clear difference in reactivity between ketones at C7 and C17.

40|$|A {{benign and}} {{effective}} process for <b>cuprous</b> <b>chloride</b> synthesis and simultaneously recovery of Ag and Pd from waste {{printed circuit boards}} (PCBs) {{was developed in the}} present study. The main merit of the process is that neither corrosive acid nor strong oxidant was used. The PCBs were firstly pretreated by thermal shock process to obtain metallic particles (MPs), then <b>cuprous</b> <b>chloride</b> was synthesized by reacting MPs with cupric sulfate in the presence of sodium chloride. The optimum V-NaCl/m(CuSO 4) (mL/g) ratio, [Cu][Cu 2 +] mole ratio, treatment time and operation temperature were 6, 0. 95, 30 min and 60 degrees C, respectively. Approximately 98. 5 % of Cu could be recovered from the PCBs through two synthesis circles. During the synthesis process, Ag and Pd could be simultaneously recovered by forming a stable chloride complex since Cu 2 + played the role of oxidant in the system. The recovery percentages of Ag and Pd were 93. 9 % and 95. 3 %, respectively. Accordingly, it is believed that the process developed in the current study is benign and practical for copper and precious metal (Ag, Pd) recovery from waste PCBs. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.
