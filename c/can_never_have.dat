5|$|In this series, the Clan’s {{survival}} is {{put at risk}} as humans begin to destroy the forest with machinery. To combat this, one cat from all four Clan’s is chosen to journey and find a new home for the cats to live. These cats are Tawnypelt of ShadowClan, Crowpaw of WindClan, Feathertail of RiverClan, and Brambleclaw of ThunderClan, the latter of whom also struggles with his heritage as the late Tigerstar’s son. Feathertail’s brother Stormfur and the ThunderClan apprentice Squirrelpaw also accompany them. After a long journey, the group discover a lake {{that they can use}} as their new territory, which they name ‘sun-drown-place.’ Whilst journeying back to report their finding to the Clans, the travelling cats meet a new community called The Tribe of Rushing Water, who are being terrorized by a mountain lion. Feathertail sacrifices her life to kill the mountain lion and save the Tribe. The remaining cats return to their Clans and relay the message. Together, the four Clans travel to their new territory, although many cats perish along the way. During this journey, the boundaries between the Clans begin to blur. Crowfeather (formerly Crowpaw) falls in love with the ThunderClan medicine cat Leafpool; however, as they are from different Clans, they are forbidden from being together. Additionally, Leafpool’s status as a medicine cat dictates she <b>can</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> a mate or give birth to kits. They decide to secretly run away together, but return when the ThunderClan camp is attacked by badgers. Leafpool’s mentor, Cinderpelt, dies in the battle, and Leafpool decides that she must remain with her Clan. Meanwhile, Brambleclaw is torn between his loyalty to his Clan and his loyalty to his dead father. He dreams of one day becoming Clan deputy, an ambition that is heightened when he discovers that his father, Tigerstar, can visit him in his dreams. Furthermore, Brambleclaw learns that he has a RiverClan half-brother named Hawkfrost. The two grow close, much to the disdain of Squirrelflight (formerly Squirrelpaw). However, Hawkfrost’s bloodthirsty nature is revealed when he traps the ThunderClan leader Firestar, and orders Brambleclaw to murder him. Brambleclaw instead kills Hawkfrost. In return, Firestar accepts the young warrior for who he is, and Brambleclaw is appointed the new deputy of ThunderClan. He later begins a relationship with Squirrelflight.|$|E
5|$|The Sermons of Swift {{have none}} of that thunder which appals, or that resistless and winning {{softness}} which melts, the hearts of an audience. He <b>can</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> enjoyed the triumph of uniting hundreds in one ardent sentiment of love, of terror, or of devotion. His reasoning, however powerful, and indeed unanswerable, convinces the understanding, but is never addressed to the heart; and, indeed, from his instructions to a young clergyman, he seems hardly to have considered pathos as a legitimate ingredient in an English sermon. Occasionally, too, Swift's misanthropic habits break out even from the pulpit; nor is he altogether able to suppress his disdain of those fellow mortals, on whose behalf was accomplished the great work of redemption. With such unamiable feelings towards his hearers, the preacher might indeed command their respect, but could never excite their sympathy. It may be feared that his Sermons were less popular from another cause, imputable more to the congregation than to the pastor. Swift spared not the vice of rich or poor; and, disdaining to amuse the imaginations of his audience with discussion of dark points of divinity, or warm them by a flow of sentimental devotion, he rushes at once {{to the point of}} moral depravity, and upbraids them with their favourite and predominant vices in a tone of stern reproof, bordering upon reproach. In short, he tears the bandages from their wounds, like the hasty surgeon of a crowded hospital, and applies the incision knife and caustic with salutary, but rough and untamed severity. But, alas! the mind must be already victorious over the worst of its evil propensities, that can profit by this harsh medicine. There is a principle of opposition in our nature, which mans itself with obstinacy even against avowed truth, when it approaches our feelings in a harsh and insulting manner. And Swift was probably sensible, that his discourses, owing to these various causes, did not produce the powerful effects most grateful to the feelings of the preacher, because they reflect back to him those of the audience.|$|E

Interestingly is not marked as a ruin on the 1775 Armstrong map, but as a small mansion house, implying that a Chapel House existed somewhere in the vicinity, in addition to the 1775 Laigh (possibly later named Chapelton). It has been stated that this site was just called 'chapel' at this time and this is the name given on Armstrong's map.|$|E

25|$|Parts of {{the story}} also take place in London, the capital of Britain. In this timeline, the British people are impoverished due to the German occupation; William Shakespeare and his works are more widely known and {{published}} in Germany than in Shakespeare's homeland, partly due to Britain's economic collapse. During the Second World War, much of London was destroyed by dive bombers and panzers as well as during the last-ditch resistance by Churchill and his supporters. Key British buildings including the Parliament building, Big Ben and St Paul's Cathedral have been completely destroyed, with their only remaining legacy being photographs. Some {{areas of the city}} have been in ruins for over seventy years, due to harsh reparations imposed on the British by the Germans and partisan uprisings that would only be completely crushed by 1970. German city planners often visit Britain to see how their colleagues deal with building from the clean slate that they themselves <b>can</b> <b>never</b> <b>have.</b>|$|E
500|$|In 1851 {{several of}} the island's {{children}} were described as [...] "scholars at home" [...] and later some youngsters attended the school on Mingulay.

500|$|Scalia {{generally}} {{voted to}} strike down laws that make distinctions by race, gender, or sexual orientation. In 1989, he concurred with the Court's judgment in City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., in which the Court applied strict scrutiny to a city program requiring {{a certain percentage of}} contracts to go to minorities, and struck down the program. Scalia did not join the majority opinion, however. He disagreed with O'Connor's opinion, for the Court, that states and localities could institute race-based programs if they identified past discrimination and if the programs were designed to remedy the past racism. Five years later, in Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Peña, he concurred in the Court's judgment and in part with the opinion that extended strict scrutiny to federal programs. Scalia noted in that matter his view that government <b>can</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> a compelling interest in making up for past discrimination by racial preferences, ...|$|E
2500|$|Ephron was Jewish by birth. Ephron's friend Richard Cohen said of her, [...] "She {{was very}} Jewish, {{culturally}} and emotionally. She identified fully as a Jewish woman."

2500|$|Since public {{organizations}} {{operate on}} tax revenue, {{they are expected}} to act responsibly for that stewardship of resources. Public institutions also operate in nonmarket conditions and are subject to unique rules and expectations. [...] This makes budgeting for incentives very difficult because unlike private sector businesses, public organizations cannot arrange their incentives around the company profit. [...] By their very nature of receiving funds instead of generating them, public organizations <b>can</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> the same freedom that private organizations have in providing incentives in the work force.|$|E

2500|$|Dumbledore, {{one of the}} {{few other}} {{characters}} to face the Mirror in the novel, claims to see himself holding a pair of socks he always wanted, telling Harry that [...] "one <b>can</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> enough socks," [...] and lamenting that he did not receive any for Christmas, since people will insist on giving him books. However, Harry suspects that this is not true, and it is suggested in Deathly Hallows that what he really sees is his entire family alive, well and happy together again, much like Harry.|$|E
2500|$|Positive {{definite}} matrices {{have the}} property {{that they have}} a triangular matrix square root P=S·ST. [...] This can be computed efficiently using the Cholesky factorization algorithm, but more importantly, if the covariance is kept in this form, it <b>can</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> a negative diagonal or become asymmetric. An equivalent form, which avoids many of the square root operations required by the matrix square root yet preserves the desirable numerical properties, is the U-D decomposition form, P=U·D·UT, where U is a unit triangular matrix (with unit diagonal), and D is a diagonal matrix.|$|E
2500|$|The Arctic {{consists}} of ocean {{that is largely}} surrounded by land. As such, the climate {{of much of the}} Arctic is moderated by the ocean water, which <b>can</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> a temperature below −2°C (28°F). [...] In winter, this relatively warm water, even though covered by the polar ice pack, keeps the North Pole from being the coldest place in the Northern Hemisphere, and it is also {{part of the reason that}} Antarctica is so much colder than the Arctic. In summer, the presence of the nearby water keeps coastal areas from warming as much as they might otherwise.|$|E

2500|$|By contrast, Justice Robert Jackson's dissent {{argued that}} [...] "defense {{measures}} will not, and often should not, be held {{within the limits}} that bind civil authority in peace," [...] {{and that it would}} perhaps be unreasonable to hold the military, who issued the exclusion order, to the same standards of constitutionality that apply {{to the rest of the}} government. [...] "In the very nature of things," [...] he wrote, [...] "military decisions are not susceptible of intelligent judicial appraisal." [...] He acknowledged the Court's powerlessness in that regard, writing that [...] "courts <b>can</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> any real alternative to accepting the mere declaration of the authority that issued the order that it was reasonably necessary from a military viewpoint." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the 1860s, German third-gender Karl Heinrich Ulrichs coined a {{new term}} for third-genders {{that he called}} [...] "urnings", which was {{supposed}} to mean [...] "men who like men". These [...] "urnings" [...] were [...] "females inside male bodies", who were emotionally or sexually attracted to men. Ulrichs and most self-declared members of the third sex thought that masculine men <b>can</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> sexual desires for other men. Hence, to be attracted to men, a male necessarily had to be feminine-gendered – had to have a female inside him. This was supported by Ulrichs' own experience, {{as well as by the}} fact that men only had sex with men secretively, due to the cultural climate. Ulrichs termed ordinary men (as opposed to third-genders) as [...] "diones", meaning [...] "men who like women." ...|$|E
2500|$|Fremantle went on {{to write}} in his book [...] "Three Months in the Southern States" [...] that he had [...] "not {{attempted}} to conceal any of the peculiarities or defects of the Southern people. Many persons will doubtless highly disapprove {{of some of their}} customs and habits in the wilder portion of the country; but I think no generous man, whatever may be his political opinions, can do otherwise than admire the courage, energy, and patriotism of the whole population, and the skill of its leaders, in this struggle against great odds. And I am also of opinion that many will agree with me in thinking that a people in which all ranks and both sexes display a unanimity and a heroism which <b>can</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> been surpassed {{in the history of the}} world, is destined, sooner or later, to become a great and independent nation." ...|$|E

2500|$|During January 1998 Robert Hanks of The Independent {{compared}} the series' ethos {{to that of}} Star Trek. [...] He wrote [...] "If you wanted to sum up the relative position of Britain and America in this century – the ebbing away of the pink areas of the map, the fading of national self-confidence as Uncle Sam proceeded to colonise the globe with fizzy drinks and Hollywood – {{you could do it}} like this: they had Star Trek, we had Blake's 7...No 'boldly going' here: instead, we got the boot stamping on a human face which George Orwell offered as a vision of humanity's future in Nineteen Eighty-Four." [...] Hanks concluded that [...] "Blake's 7 has acquired a credibility and popularity Terry Nation <b>can</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> expected...I think it's to do with the sheer crappiness of the series and the crappiness it attributes to the universe: it is science-fiction for the disillusioned and ironic – and that is what makes it so very British." ...|$|E
2500|$|In quantum mechanics, the {{particle}} {{in a box}} model (also known as the infinite potential well or the infinite square well) describes a particle free to move in a small space surrounded by impenetrable barriers. [...] The model is mainly used as a hypothetical example to illustrate the differences between classical and quantum systems. [...] In classical systems, for example, a ball trapped inside a large box, {{the particle}} can move at any speed within the box {{and it is no}} more likely to be found at one position than another. However, when the well becomes very narrow (on the scale of a few nanometers), quantum effects become important. [...] The particle may only occupy certain positive energy levels. [...] Likewise, it <b>can</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> zero energy, meaning that the particle can never [...] "sit still". [...] Additionally, it {{is more likely to be}} found at certain positions than at others, depending on its energy level. [...] The particle may never be detected at certain positions, known as spatial nodes.|$|E
2500|$|Justice Pigeon {{acknowledged}} that it is unusual to qualify [...] "the operation of a rule of construction." [...] However, he argued that it is merely a reiteration of an already well-established common law principle, since a rule of construction <b>can</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> an [...] "effect against the clearly expressed will of Parliament in whatever form it is put." [...] As a matter of fact, Justice Pigeon contended that this qualification in section 2 of the Bill of Rights actually affirms that s. 1 [...] "means what it says and recognizes and declares existing rights and freedoms only." [...] In other words, existing legislation, which embodies and delimits {{the content of the}} rights and freedoms enumerated in the Canadian Bill of Rights, cannot be held inoperative by virtue of the Bill of Rights. If the reverse were true, Justice Pigeon wrote, section 2 of the Bill of Rights would be in conflict with its purpose to recognize and declare only the rights that have existed and that shall continue to exist. Moreover, Pigeon argued that the contrasting point of view would violate the well-settled common law presumption against implicit departure from the existing law.|$|E
