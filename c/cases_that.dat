5|$|According to Article 142 of the Turkish Constitution, the organisation, {{duties and}} {{jurisdiction}} of the courts, their functions and the trial procedures are regulated by law. In line with the aforementioned article of the Turkish Constitution and related laws, the court system in Turkey can be classified under three main categories; which are the Judicial Courts, Administrative Courts and Military Courts. Each category includes first instance courts and high courts. In addition, the Court of Jurisdictional Disputes rules on <b>cases</b> <b>that</b> cannot be classified readily as falling within the purview of one court system.|$|E

Even <b>cases</b> <b>that</b> do get seen by a family doctor or a hospital are often misdiagnosed {{as one of the}} many common infectious diseases with overlapping symptoms. Thus, it is recommended that HIV be considered in people presenting an unexplained fever who may have risk factors for the infection.|$|E

50|$|Like the {{character}} of Mrs. Malaprop in Sheridan's play The Rivals, the name Simon Pure soon became a noun for a quality in a person. In Mrs. Malaprop's <b>case,</b> <b>that</b> quality was incorrect usage of a word by substituting a similar-sounding word with different meaning, usually with comic effect. In Simon's <b>case,</b> <b>that</b> quality was authenticity and in Simon's impersonator's <b>case,</b> <b>that</b> quality was hypocrisy.|$|R

New EGFR inhibitors include afatinib and dacomitinib. An alternative signaling pathway, c-Met, can be inhibited by tivantinib and onartuzumab. New ALK inhibitors include crizotinib and ceritinib.|$|E
5|$|Generally, in {{cabinets}} or display <b>cases</b> <b>that</b> {{are entirely}} or partially made of wood, the hydrolysis of acetyl {{groups in the}} wood hemicelluloses creates acetic acid. The {{rate at which the}} acetic acid is produced is proportional to the concentration of esters in the wood, the humidity, the temperature, and the overall acidity of the environment. Acidic fumes can also be released from formaldehyde which can occur in wood as a degradation product of lignin. Acidic fumes can also be given off from ubiquitous formaldehyde resins (commonly urea-formaldehyde resins).|$|E

About 1.1% of adults have schizophrenia in the United States.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the course}} of its history the Oregon Supreme Court has made a number {{decisions}} as the highest court in Oregon. These cases cover {{a wide range of}} topics from the constitutionality of various ballot measures to contract law to torts and even to the location of the capital when Oregon was still a territory. Although small in comparison to the total number of cases the court has decided, some cases have been appealed to the United States Supreme Court. Below are some of the <b>cases</b> <b>that</b> have had scholarly discussion, some of which were later decided by the U.S. Supreme Court.|$|E

In 2007 the Law School started the Cold Case Justice Initiative, investigating cold cases from {{the civil rights era}} in the South. Its professors and students have identified 196 cases, of which more than 100 are in Georgia, and will give information to the US Department of Justice in order to have cases prosecuted. The FBI has identified 122 cold <b>cases</b> <b>that</b> it is trying to resolve.|$|E
5|$|The NAACP was {{responsible}} for managing most sit-in related <b>cases</b> <b>that</b> {{made it to the}} Supreme Court, winning nearly every decision. But it fell to the ACLU and other legal volunteer efforts to provide legal representation to hundreds of protestorswhite and blackwho were arrested while protesting in the South. The ACLU joined with other civil liberties groups to form the Lawyers Constitutional Defense Committee (LCDC) which subsequently provided legal representation to many of the protesters. The ACLU provided the majority of the funding for the LCDC.|$|E
