500|$|In June 1999, United {{accepted}} {{an offer from}} the FA {{to withdraw from the}} FA Cup in order to participate in the 2000 FIFA Club World Championship, staged in Brazil. It was criticised by the new Sports minister Kate Hoey, who suggested the club were treating its supporters in a [...] "shabby way". Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson however replied that United had been pressurised to make the decision, which aimed to solidify England's 2006 FIFA World Cup bid: [...] "The Government are saying that we should be in the FA Cup, but they are the very people that were saying originally that {{we have to go to}} Brazil. They <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> quite clearly: 'Do not bother about the World Cup bid, leave that to us. It should not be Manchester United's responsibility.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|She maintains, however, {{that she}} still refuses to sing [...] "Leave Me Alone (Ruby Red Dress)" [...] because she dislikes the monotony of the {{repeated}} chorus. [...] "They {{used to have a}} contest on the radio that you could get two free tickets to Helen Reddy’s show if you <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> how many times she sang 'leave me alone.' I think it was like 42 times," [...] she said.|$|E
2500|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{important}} stela has the opposite condition and <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> much more {{if it was not}} so badly damaged. In 1891, a private stela was found which is now in the , sometimes called the Coregency Stela. [...] On this stela, most of the scene is missing but the inscriptions can be read. [...] It depicts the double cartouche of Akhenaten alongside that of Ankhkheperure mery-Waenre Neferneferuaten Akhet-en-hyes ('effective for her husband'). [...] The inscription originally bore the single cartouche of Nefertiti, which was erased along with a reference to Meritaten {{to make room for the}} double cartouche of King Neferneferuaten.|$|E
6000|$|... "If he <b>could</b> only <b>TELL</b> <b>us</b> {{where he}} feels the worst!" [...] said Cecily piteously. [...] "It's so dreadful to see him {{suffering}} {{and not be able}} to do a single thing to help him!" ...|$|R
60|$|The renegado {{had lived}} so {{long on the}} island that its customs were quite familiar; and I much lamented that, from the {{shortness}} of our stay, he <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> more than he did.|$|R
5000|$|... this [...] "code" [...] {{computer}} software? If so, <b>could</b> {{the article}} <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> that? This {{article is a}} mess! ...|$|R
2500|$|Despite Claire’s open {{disdain for}} her sister, {{she has never}} told Agnes about Tobias’s affair. It is not clear if she does this out of love or out of spite. She keeps the affair a secret, {{almost as if she}} has a hidden weapon that she protects in case she may have to use it one day. When Agnes comes right out and asks Claire to confirm her suspicions about Tobias, Claire’s answer is, “Ya got me, Sis.” Shortly after this exchange, Agnes {{describes}} Claire in this way: “Claire <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> so much if she cared to [...] [...] [...] Claire, who watches from the sidelines, has seen so very much, has seen us all so clearly [...] [...] [...] You were not named for nothing.” Claire is said to closely resemble Albee’s aunt Jane, an alcoholic and frequent visitor to the Albee home.|$|E
2500|$|I {{first met}} Temple {{in the mid-1980s}} [...] annual [...] conference. Standing on the {{periphery}} of the group was a tall young woman who was obviously interested in the discussions. She seemed shy and pleasant, but mostly she just listened. I learned her name was Temple Grandin. It wasn't until later in the week that I realized she was someone with autism. I approached her and asked if she'd be willing to speak at the next year's [...] conference. She agreed. The next year Temple first addressed an [...] audience. People were standing at least three deep. The audience couldn't get enough of her. Here, for the first time, was someone who <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> from her own experience, what it was like to be extremely sound sensitive ("like being tied to the rail and the train's coming"). She was asked many questions: [...] "Why does my son do so much spinning?" [...] "Why does he hold his hands to his ears?" [...] "Why doesn't he look at me?" [...] She spoke from her own experience, and her insight was impressive. There were tears in more than one set of eyes that day. Temple quickly became a much sought-after speaker in the autism community.|$|E
60|$|This {{we called}} Cannon House, but {{who lived in}} these two houses none <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us.</b>|$|E
3000|$|Let’s {{start with}} the first question. In your work, you present {{a world that is}} very {{challenging}} for human agents. It’s a world quite distinct from the one presented in classical economics. <b>Could</b> you <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> a bit more about the key differences? [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... “You are too retiring,” she rebuked him smilingly. “But I {{shall not}} begin by finding fault. I {{want you to}} tell me some of your {{exciting}} adventures. Aynsley Clay was here, but he <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> much about you—and he was, of course, in trouble.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That I cannot say, sahib, for the spies <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>us.</b> Doubtless he and {{his army}} are much dispirited, at their failure to take the city. But the general opinion of the townspeople {{was that he would}} give battle, be victorious, and would return and {{continue}} the siege." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Cousin Eustace," [...] said Cowslip, [...] "that was a {{very nice}} story of the Gorgon's Head. Do you think you <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> another as good?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Miss. They're drownded sailors a {{long time}} drownded. All {{you have to do}} is look at 'm. An' the {{carpenter}} <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> a few if he was minded." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Called myself Anna," [...] {{the girl}} {{repeated}} coolly. [...] "It can't {{make any difference}} to you, and there are not half a dozen people in Paris who <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> apart." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> {{much of the}} place, for he cannot endure Master Priggins, and Master Sylvester {{laughs at}} his Puritanical manner; but he says--O Edmund--that the fish-ponds are filled up--those dear old fish-ponds where the water-lilies used to blow, and you once pulled {{me out of the}} water." ...|$|R
60|$|After we {{had left}} the {{sanctuary}} I asked Harût when this figure was brought to their land. He replied that it came when they came, at what date he <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> as it was so long ago, and that with it came the worship and the ceremonies of their religion.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] said Mrs. Wilson with a laugh, [...] "Emily {{knew that}} ten days ago. <b>Could</b> your friend <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> {{anything}} of Bonaparte? We are {{much interested in}} his movements just now." ...|$|R
60|$|Old Samivel {{asked us}} what hotel we {{was going to}} stop at, and when we told him the one we had picked out he said he <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> a better one.|$|E
6000|$|I {{nodded and}} said, [...] "I dare say friend Hassan <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> {{something}} about the matter. Meanwhile as supper isn't ready yet, let us {{have a look at}} that church while it is light." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For my part," [...] said Mrs. Cliff, [...] "I {{think we}} all {{know who we are}} now. I don't think anybody <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us.</b> And I {{think it would have been}} a great deal better--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She is ower far past {{reasonable}} folks' motives, sir," [...] said Ratcliffe, [...] "to mind siller, or John Dalgleish, or the cat-and-nine-tails either; but I think I <b>could</b> gar her <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> something." ...|$|R
5000|$|... 4Music gave {{particular}} {{praise to}} the vocalist of the song, saying [...] "If Duke Dumont is watching, <b>could</b> you please <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> who the amazing vocalist {{is on this}} track? She deserves a credit!." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{seems to}} me," [...] said the Wizard {{after a brief}} silence had {{followed}} Glinda's speech, [...] "that there are three fishes in this lake {{that used to be}} Adepts at Magic and from whom Coo-ee-oh stole much of her knowledge. If we could find those fishes and return them to their former shapes, they <b>could</b> doubtless <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> what to do to bring the sunken island to the surface." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Stay, Tom. Thank you, most warmly, {{but you see}} {{yourself}} the best advice in the world <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> no more than we know already. Are you really master of old Centry Underwood? I congratulate you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Alas!--for {{three of}} them at least," [...] ejaculated Mrs. Aleshine; [...] "they have left us, but they are all right. And now, sir, if you <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> what {{relation}} you are to Emily, and what Lucille--" ...|$|E
60|$|So in {{our hearts}} it was winter,--a winter of patient {{suffering}} and expectancy,--a winter of suppressed sobs, of inward bleedings,--a cold, choked, compressed anguish of endurance, for how long and how much God only <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{information}} about the mythohistory {{of the people and}} village of Chipaya was told to Dedenbach (interviewer) and Hannss (assistant) one evening in September 2002 in Santa Ana de Chipaya in the team's kitchen. The narrator was an elderly man from Chipaya who had come to <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> about his life and was then asekd by the interviewer if he <b>could</b> also <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> something about the history of Chipaya. He agreed spontaneously and told his story first in Spanish, then he gave us this version in Spanish. This session contains the Chipaya narrative...|$|R
60|$|He {{proposed}} a theater, and we accordingly {{made our way}} toward the Strand. Our friend, in {{closing the door behind}} him, said he <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> what a relief it was to get away from those children. He said he loved children very much indeed, but that {{it was a mistake to}} have too much of anything, however much you liked it, and that he had come to the conclusion that twenty-two hours a day of them was enough for any one.|$|R
6000|$|Bar, {{handling}} his persuasive double eye-glass, was by {{no means}} clear but that it might be four. It was one of those happy strokes of calculation and combination, the result of which it was difficult to estimate. It was one of those instances of a comprehensive grasp, associated with habitual luck and characteristic boldness, of which an age presented us but few. But here was Brother Bellows, {{who had been in the}} great Bank case, and who <b>could</b> probably <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> more. What did Brother Bellows put this new success at? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{want to get}} a room. We {{have been}} lodging {{together}} in London, and don't know anyone down here. I thought perhaps you <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> of some quiet, respectable people who have a room to let?" ...|$|E
60|$|We {{dropped in}} at the Cromarty Arms, and asked good Mrs. M'Lachlan if she <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> {{anything}} about the gentlemanly stranger. Mrs. M'Lachlan replied that he was from London, she believed, a pleasant gentleman enough; {{and he had his}} wife with him.|$|E
6000|$|Carshalton nodded. [...] "Glad to meet you. Won't you sit down?" [...] he said. [...] "As it happens, I {{had just}} pointed {{you out to}} Miss Hamilton. We {{were talking about the}} wilderness--or, to be more precise, the great primeval stillness. I ventured to suggest that you <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> {{something}} about it." ...|$|E
60|$|But {{says the}} Feather, {{why do you}} call me Fool too? why Sir, says he, because no Body <b>could</b> ever <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> what it was you drove at, and we ha' been told you never knew your selves; now if one of you Tacking Feathers would but tell the World what your real Design was, they would be satisfy'd, but to be leaders in the Consolidator, and to Act without Meaning, without Thought or Design, must argue your' Fools, or worse, {{and you will find}} all the Moon of my Mind.|$|R
6000|$|But did {{the thought}} occur to none of us, how morally ghastly, {{in spite of}} all its {{physical}} beauty, was that grand sight, unless we were sure that behind it all, there was a living God? Unless we believed that not one of those bolts fell, or did not fall to the ground without our Father? That He had appointed the path, and the time, and the destiny, and the use of every atom of that matter, of which science <b>could</b> only <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> that it was rushing without a purpose, for ever through the homeless void? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'As {{a matter}} of fact,' said Merevale, 'I know that Thomson started {{to run in the}} long race this afternoon. I met him going to the starting-place, and advised him to go and change again. He was not looking at all fit for such a long run. It seems to me that Welch might know where he is. Thomson and he got well ahead of the others after the start, so that if, as I expect, Thomson dropped out early in the race, Welch <b>could</b> {{probably}} <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> where it happened. That would give us some clue to his whereabouts, at any rate.' ...|$|R
