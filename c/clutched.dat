5|$|During a {{train ride}} to New York, the {{conductor}} {{told her to}} move into the smoking car. She refused, explaining her government service. He cursed at her and grabbed her, but she resisted and he summoned two other passengers for help. While she <b>clutched</b> at the railing, they muscled her away, breaking her arm in the process. They threw her into the smoking car, causing more injuries. As these events transpired, other white passengers cursed Tubman and shouted for the conductor to kick her off the train.|$|E

5|$|For {{the first}} few hours after the mudflow hit, she was covered by {{concrete}} but got her hand {{through a crack in}} the debris. After a rescuer noticed her hand protruding from a pile of debris, he and others cleared tiles and wood {{over the course of a}} day. Once the girl was freed from the waist up, her rescuers attempted to pull her out, but found the task impossible without breaking her legs in the process. Each time a person pulled her, the water pooled around her, rising so that it seemed she would drown if they let her go, so rescue workers placed a tire around her body to keep her afloat. Divers discovered that Sánchez's legs were caught under a door made of bricks, with her aunt's arms <b>clutched</b> tightly around her legs and feet.|$|E
5|$|Two {{bishops and}} a hermit came to Vladimir, {{gave him a}} wooden cross, and {{confirmed}} that the tsar had made a pledge of faith on it. Vladimir kissed the cross and <b>clutched</b> it to his chest, collected a few followers, and set off for Prespa. As he arrived, on 22May 1016, he went into a church to pray. When he exited the church, he was struck down by Vladislav's soldiers and beheaded. According to Skylitzes, Vladimir believed Vladislav's pledge, told {{to him by the}} Bulgarian archbishop David. He then allowed himself to fall into Vladislav's hands, and was executed. The motivation behind the murder is unclear. Since Samuel's defeat in 1014, the Bulgarians had been losing battle after battle, and Vladislav probably suspected or was informed that Vladimir planned to restore Duklja's alliance with Byzantium. This alliance would be particularly disturbing for Tsar Vladislav because of the proximity of Duklja to Dyrrhachium, which was a target of the tsar's war efforts.|$|E

25|$|Two {{months after}} Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated, Louisville's West End rioted. On May 27, 1968, {{a protest against}} police {{brutality}} was happening at Twenty-eighth and Greenwood Streets that eventually turned violent when the Louisville police jumped {{out of their cars}} with their guns already drawn. Louie B. Nunn called out the National Guard. 472 arrests were made, $200,000 in damages happened, and James Groves Jr, 14, and Washington Browder, 19, were murdered. Washington Browder had a fish sandwich still <b>clutched</b> in his hand when found on the sidewalk, shot dead, by a business owner. James Groves Jr. was shot in the back, after supposedly looting during the riots.|$|E

40|$|The present {{invention}} {{is directed}} to a mechanical <b>clutch</b> which limits transmission of torque to a desired, predetermined maximum torque from a first <b>clutch</b> plate to a second <b>clutch</b> plate. More specifically, the mechanical <b>clutch</b> includes at least one stepper member, preferably three or more evenly spaced stepper members, which transmit the torque from a first <b>clutch</b> plate to a second <b>clutch</b> plate providing a desired maximum torque is not exceeded. However, if the desired maximum torque is exceeded, the stepper member will rotate and move between the <b>clutch</b> plates so that the torque to the second <b>clutch</b> plate does not exceed the desired maximum torque. The desired maximum torque is set by the axial force compressing the stepper member between the <b>clutch</b> plates and when the applied torque to the first <b>clutch</b> plate exceeds the desired torque, the stepper member will rotate between the <b>clutch</b> plates rather than transmit that torque to the second <b>clutch</b> plate...|$|R
25|$|The main disadvantage, {{like the}} clutch braking system, is that {{steering}} dissipates heat through the brakes. Unlike the <b>clutched</b> system, however, {{in this case}} all turning requires braking. This {{can be used on}} lighter tanks, but the amount of kinetic energy in larger tanks makes the required brakes impractically large. Another disadvantage is that the differential will allow the tracks to turn at different speeds no matter what the cause may be. This may be the application of braking, but also occurs as the tank travels over terrain; if one side of the tank enters softer terrain and slows down, the tank will naturally turn towards that side. Forward momentum tends to offset this effect, so it is mainly a problem at low speeds.|$|E
25|$|A {{soldier in}} Hancock's {{division}} reported {{movement in the}} Confederate line that led some {{to believe that the}} enemy might be retreating. Despite the unlikeliness of this supposition, the V Corps division of Brig. Gen. Andrew A. Humphreys was ordered to attack and capitalize on the situation. Humphreys led his first brigade on horseback, with his men moving over and around fallen troops with fixed bayonets and unloaded rifles; some of the fallen men <b>clutched</b> at the passing pant legs, urging their comrades not to go forward, causing the brigade to become disorganized in their advance. The charge reached to within 50 yards before being cut down by concentrated rifle fire. Brig. Gen. George Sykes was ordered to move forward with his V Corps regular army division to support Humphreys's retreat, but his men were caught in a crossfire and pinned down.|$|E
25|$|Philip's parents {{appeared}} {{regularly on}} the news and <b>clutched</b> what {{has now become a}} well-recognised picture of a smiling Philip in his Confirmation clothes of a blue jacket and a red rosette. This photo has been deemed a precursor to that of British infant Madeleine McCann, who disappeared in Portugal 21 years later. However, the family, unlike the McCanns, have been relatively private about their loss, speaking to the media on only a few occasions in the past 25 years. It has been reported that this is due to several inaccurate reports of the incident of which they have disapproved. Gardaí have, however, praised the media as a proven method for encouraging people to come forward with further information on the case each time an appeal is broadcast. Residents' organisation ACRA also launched an intense campaign to attempt to find Philip.|$|E
40|$|The {{parasitic}} wasp Achrysocharoides zwoelferi (Hymenoptera, Eulophidae) produces <b>clutches</b> consisting {{of only one}} sex. Moreover, male <b>clutch</b> size is invariably one while female <b>clutches</b> {{are in the range}} one to four. We designed field experiments to determine the effect of host quality on <b>clutch</b> composition. We found that solitary male and solitary female <b>clutches</b> were reared from the same size mines, and that larger mines tended to produce gregarious female <b>clutches.</b> A higher proportion of male <b>clutches</b> were placed in older hosts, despite their large size. Variation in body size, both between and within <b>clutches,</b> was measured in order to test the predictions of models that take into account the constraint that <b>clutch</b> size is an integer trait, something of potential importance when absolute <b>clutch</b> size is low. Our data supported several predictions of these models, including the trade-off-invariant rule for optimal offspring size developed by Charnov and Downhower. However, while most invertebrate <b>clutch</b> size models assume equal resource share among members of the same <b>clutch,</b> we found an increase in inequality in larger <b>clutches...</b>|$|R

25|$|In May 1999, Sharpton, Jesse Jackson, {{and other}} activists protested the December 1998 fatal police {{shooting}} of Tyisha Miller in central Riverside, California. Miller, a 19-year-old African-American woman, had sat unconscious {{in a locked}} car with a flat tire and the engine left running, parked at a local gas station. After her relatives had called 9-1-1, Riverside Police Department officers {{who responded to the}} scene observed a gun in the young woman's lap, and according to their accounts, she was shaking and foaming at the mouth, and in need of medical attention. When officers decided to break her window to reach her, as one officer reached for the weapon, she allegedly awoke and <b>clutched</b> her firearm, prompting several officers to open fire, hitting her 23 times and killing her. When the Riverside County district attorney stated that the officers involved had erred in judgement but committed no crime, declining to file criminal charges against them, Sharpton participated in protests which reached their zenith when protestors spilled onto the busy SR 91, completely stopping traffic. Sharpton was arrested for his participation and leadership in these protests.|$|E
25|$|In 1938, {{champion}} Joe Louis {{announced that}} he would face Schmeling for the title. The rematch became an instant international sensation. Many clamored impatiently for its happening, but others, afraid of international tensions and the possibility of Hitler taking over the championship, protested. The controversy and ballyhoo led to the event becoming the most anticipated boxing match since the rematch between Dempsey and Gene Tunney, or possibly earlier. Louis, with his poor, black roots was adopted by American fans as the symbol of America as a land of opportunity. In contrast, Americans perceived Schmeling and his ties to Hitler as an obvious threat to those opportunities and ideals. When the German walked to the ring at Yankee Stadium on 22 June 1938, he did so under a hail of garbage thrown from the stands. Louis came out blazing in the first round and Schmeling tried to counter-punch as he had in the first bout, but to no avail. Driven into the ropes and battered with a fusillade of short, crisp blows from every angle, Schmeling turned his back to his opponent and <b>clutched</b> onto the ropes, letting out a scream that even years later, many spectators could recall vividly. Schmeling later said that he screamed because he had been hit with a blow to the kidneys. Schmeling's knees buckled under the punishment, and referee Arthur Donovan pushed Louis away, beginning a count on Schmeling. Schmeling reluctantly stepped away from the ropes, and Donovan allowed him to continue. A few punches later, Schmeling was knocked down again. From then on, he was helpless. He rose but fell moments later, and Donovan stopped the fight.|$|E
25|$|After Jacobo Arbenz came {{to power}} in 1951, he {{extended}} political freedom, allowing Communists in Guatemala to participate in politics. This move by Arbenz let many opponents in Ubico’s regime to recognize themselves as Communists. By 1952, Arbenz supported a land reform, and took unused agricultural land, about , from owners who had large properties, and made it available to rural workers and farmers. These lands were to be taken from the United Fruit Company with compensation; however, the UFC believed the compensation was not enough. Meantime, Arbenz allowed the Communist Party to organize and include leaders notably his adviser who were leftist. The propaganda effort that was led by United Fruit Company against the revolution in Guatemala persuaded the U.S. government to fight against communism in Guatemala. The United States <b>clutched</b> on small details to prove the existence of widespread Communism in Guatemala. The Eisenhower administration at the time in the U.S. were not happy about the Arbenz government, they considered Arbenz to be too close to Communism; there have been reports that Arbenz’s wife was a Communist and part of the Communist Party in Guatemala. Even though it was impossible for the U.S. to gather evidence and information about Guatemala’s relations to the Soviet Union, Americans wanted to believe that Communism existed in Guatemala. Many groups of Guatemalan exiles were armed and trained by the CIA, and commanded by Colonel Carlos Castillo Armas they invaded Guatemala on 18 June 1954. The Americans called it an Anti-Communist Coup against Arbenz. The coup was supported by CIA radio broadcasts and so the Guatemalan army refused to resist the coup, Arbenz was forced to resign. In 1954 a military government replaced Arbenz' government and disbanded the legislature and they arrested communist leaders, Castillo Armas became president.|$|E

Jeff sidestepped when Matt attempted a diving leg drop. Jeff hit a falling headbutt and a clothesline. Jeff went on to deliver a diving leg drop of his own. Jeff went to the top rope but Matt trapped him in a Tree of Woe. Matt then applied the sunset flip, which Jeff countered and both men were lying outside the ring. In the ring, Jeff injured his left knee, which Matt would work on. He hit a chop block {{and a series of}} moves. He tried a powerbomb, but Jeff countered it into a Compactor Clutch. Matt assaulted Jeff again with a Half Boston Crab. Jeff got to the ropes, breaking the hold, and kicked Matt to the outside. Jeff went to the top, but, because of his hurt knee, he fell down. Matt grabbed Jeff's leg but Jeff hit a mule kick. Matt tried a Twist of Fate, but Jeff countered it into a leg drop. Jeff hit a suplex, and went to the top rope again but, because of his knee, Matt took advantage and <b>clutched</b> him. Matt tried to hit a Twist of Fate but Jeff reversed it into his own. Matt attempted a pinfall on Jeff and used ropes for leverage but Lita ordered him to break it. Jeff went to the top rope again, but Matt caught him, and tried to hit him a Twist of Fate from the top.
