40|$|Traffic {{congestion}} {{has been}} a serious social and technical problem since the early year’s rapid motorization in Banda Aceh, Aceh Province of Indonesia. Urban arterial performance becomes the crucial concerns of many traffic engineers. Arterial performances were analyzed using oblique cumulative plots and breakdown method. The approaches are time series treatment between cumulative vehicles arrival versus time contracted from data recorded by video cameras. Investigations were conducted during both morning and evening peak hours on three regular weekdays for observing saturation condition in order to observe the maximum <b>capacity</b> <b>under</b> <b>prevailing</b> <b>conditions.</b> This study examined the impact of presence on-street parking on deterioration both travel speed and capacity. It found that capacity diminished slightly 10 - 13 % (275 - 368 vph) compared to the pre-breakdown condition. Likewise, during the breakdown, speed dropped about 13 - 19 % (3 - 5 kph) controlled by pre-breakdown as well. The simulation software so called VISSIM 5. 30 was governed to estimate the measurement of effectiveness (MOEs) by removing on-street parking from a site of study. The MOEs reveal that removing on-street parking able to reduce average delay approximately 12 sec/veh (32 %) and increase speed about 5 kph (24 %) ...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, the IGCC prozess is {{the most}} {{efficient}} technique for power generation. However, there are many process steps which cause tremendous losses in efficiency. The highest losses occur during the cooling of the flue gas required for the gas cleaning. A reduction of loss in efficiency {{can be achieved by}} a continuous hot gas cleaning at elevated temperatures without any intercalated flue gas cooling steps. The german project HotVeGas deals with an IGCC process including a high temperature coal gasification and a high temperature flue gas cleaning. The important steps in the recent hot gas cleaning are removal of slag, retention of gaseous alkalis and CO conversion together with hydrogen separation by a high temperature shift catalyst membrane. The removal of alkalis is predominant because condensates of alkali metal salts can demage components in the power plant. Therefore, the essential aim is to keep the alkali concentration at low values. The concept of a removal of alkali at high temperatures is based on sorption in aluminosilicates and forming glass melts. In this regard, materials with a high sorption <b>capacity</b> <b>under</b> <b>prevailing</b> <b>conditions</b> are required. Furthermore, there is a great demand for operational CO catalysts. Within the context of an overall view of the considered IGCC process thermochemical model calculations were performed to estimate the gas purity after alkali removal under reducing conditions. The parameters of interest were coal composition, gasifying agent und system pressure. The resulting gas composition was then used to determine the condensation temperatures of alkaline salts. In addition, thermochemical stabilities of shift catalysts under reducing conditions were calculated. In consideration of the sorption capacity of aluminosilicates at high temperatures in reducing atmosphere sorption tests were performed at 1400 and 1500 °C...|$|E
40|$|Many {{years of}} {{research}} {{have led to the}} development of theories and methodologies in roadway capacity analysis in the developed countries. However, those resources coexist with roadway design and traffic control practices in the local country, and cannot be simply transferred to China for applications. For example, the Highway Capacity Manual in the United State describes roadway <b>capacity</b> <b>under</b> ideal conditions and estimates practical <b>capacities</b> <b>under</b> <b>prevailing</b> <b>conditions</b> in the field. This capacity and the conditions for change are expected to be different on Chinese roadways as the local roadway design (lane width, curves and grades), vehicle size, and traffic mix are different. This research looks into an approach to the capacity issue different from the Highway Capacity Manual. According to the car-following principle, this paper first describes the safety criteria that affect traffic operations. Several speed schemes are subsequently discussed as they are affected by the maximum speed achievable under the local conditions. The study has shown that the effect of geometric and traffic conditions can be effectually reflected in the maximum speed adopted by the drivers. For most Chinese highways without a posted speed limit, the choice of speed by the drivers from the safety prospective is believed to have incorporated considerations of the practical driving conditions. Based on this, a condition for capacity calculation is obtained by comparing the desired vs. safety-based distance headways. The formulations of the model are mathematically sound and physically meaningful, and preliminary testing of the model is encouraging. Future research includes field data acquisition for calibration and adjustment, and model testing on Chinese highways...|$|R

40|$|Highways are {{generally}} designed {{to serve a}} mixed traffic flow that consists of passenger cars, trucks, buses, recreational vehicles, etc. The fact that the impacts of these different vehicle types are not uniform creates problems in highway operations and safety. A common approach to reducing the impacts of truck traffic on freeways has been to restrict trucks to certain lane(s) to minimize the interaction between trucks and other vehicles and to compensate for their differences in operational characteristics. ^ The performance of different truck lane restriction alternatives differs under different traffic and geometric conditions. Thus, a good estimate of the operational performance of different truck lane restriction alternatives <b>under</b> <b>prevailing</b> <b>conditions</b> is needed to help make informed decisions on truck lane restriction alternatives. This study develops operational performance models {{that can be applied}} to help identify the most operationally efficient truck lane restriction alternative on a freeway <b>under</b> <b>prevailing</b> <b>conditions.</b> The operational performance measures examined in this study include average speed, throughput, speed difference, and lane changes. <b>Prevailing</b> <b>conditions</b> include number of lanes, interchange density, free-flow speeds, volumes, truck percentages, and ramp volumes. ^ Recognizing the difficulty of collecting sufficient data for an empirical modeling procedure that involves a high number of variables, the simulation approach was used to estimate the performance values for various truck lane restriction alternatives under various scenarios. Both the CORSIM and VISSIM simulation models were examined for their ability to model truck lane restrictions. Due to a major problem found in the CORSIM model for truck lane modeling, the VISSIM model was adopted as the simulator for this study. ^ The VISSIM model was calibrated mainly to replicate the capacity given in the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) for various free-flow speeds under the ideal basic freeway section conditions. Non-linear regression models for average speed, throughput, average number of lane changes, and speed difference between the lane groups were developed.
