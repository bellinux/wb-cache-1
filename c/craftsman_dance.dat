2500|$|Twenty years later, Gordon, {{who had not}} {{previously}} considered {{himself to be a}} political artist, created Dancing Henry Five in response to the 9/11 attacks and the war in Iraq. [...] It also received mostly positive critical response. [...] It was called [...] "a bare-bones production that created a powerful epic mood" [...] by John Rockwell, who compared it favorably to a production at Lincoln Center. Other critics praised its [...] "humor and deft movement", its [...] "masterful blend of charm and sting", and called it [...] "stunning and provocative", while describing the movement in the dance-theater piece as [...] "stripped down and democratic". [...] "It takes a witty <b>craftsman</b> of <b>dance</b> theater like Gordon to turn a heroically jingoistic play into a wry but fervent plea for peace", wrote one critic about the most recent revival of the piece, while another wrote that [...] "The means are simple, the dancing far from virtuoso; the thought and meanings are complex." ...|$|R
50|$|In 1987 Goh became {{seriously ill}} {{and after a}} very brief illness died on 28 November 1987 of an AIDS-related disease, viral colitis, {{at his home in}} New York City. Before his death he had decided that a {{foundation}} to further choreographic endeavors would be part of his legacy. Janek Schergen was chosen by Mr. Goh to be the artistic director of this endeavour. The Choo San Goh & H. Robert Magee Foundation was formed in 1992 and the centerpiece of it is its annual Choo San Goh Award for Choreography. Since that time numerous choreographers and dance companies have been given financial awards to create new dance works in an effort to further develop choreographic talent. The foundation also oversees the licensing of Goh’s ballets in performances by dance companies throughout the world. Singapore Dance Theatre has added to their repertoire twelve of Goh’s works, bringing his unique identity as a Singaporean choreographer back to his homeland. In 1997 Singapore Dance Theatre commissioned a monograph on Goh entitled Goh Choo San, Master <b>Craftsman</b> in <b>Dance.</b> It contains a detailed overview of his life in written text and photos of his ballets. Singapore Dance Theatre mounted a successful retrospective of his works in 2007 entitled Legacy. Obituaries were published in the New York Times and the Washington Post on November 30, 1987.|$|R
