25|$|Pigment {{production}} {{usually involves}} {{the precipitation of}} CdS, the washing of the solid precipitate to remove soluble cadmium salts followed by calcination (roasting) to convert it to the hexagonal form followed by milling to produce a powder. When <b>cadmium</b> sulfide <b>selenides</b> are required the CdSe is co-precipitated with CdS and the cadmium sulfoselenide is created during the calcination step.|$|R

5|$|Various cadmium salts {{are used}} in paint pigments, with CdS as a yellow pigment being the most common. <b>Cadmium</b> <b>selenide</b> is a red pigment, {{commonly}} called cadmium red. To painters who work with the pigment, cadmium provides the most brilliant and durable yellows, oranges, and reds — {{so much so that}} during production, these colors are significantly toned down before they are ground with oils and binders or blended into watercolors, gouaches, acrylics, and other paint and pigment formulations. Because these pigments are potentially toxic, users should use a barrier cream on the hands to prevent absorption through the skin even though the amount of cadmium absorbed into the body through the skin is reported to be less than 1%.|$|E

The light source is usually a light-emitting diode (LED), a miniature incandescent lamp, or sometimes a neon lamp, whereas the detector is a semiconductor-based photoresistor made of <b>cadmium</b> <b>selenide</b> (CdSe) or cadmium sulfide (CdS).

The as-deposited thin films were annealed at 300, 500 and 700 °C and then subjected to various structural, morphological and optical investigations. The effect of the presence of capping agent and annealing on these properties was discussed. The phenomenon of phase transformation occurred during annealing. The optical band gap energies were found in the range 2. 37 – 1. 7 eV with respect to the annealing temperatures...|$|R
5000|$|A {{prevailing}} {{belief is}} that trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO) or trioctylphosphine (TOP), a neutral ligand derived from a common precursor used in the synthesis of CdSe dots, caps the surface of CdSe quantum dots. However, results from recent studies challenge this model. Using NMR, quantum dots {{have been shown to}} be nonstoichiometric meaning that the <b>cadmium</b> to <b>selenide</b> ratio is not one to one. CdSe dots have excess cadmium cations on the surface that can form bonds with anionic species such as carboxylate chains. [...] The CdSe quantum dot would be charge unbalanced if TOPO or TOP were indeed the only type of ligand bound to the dot.|$|R
25|$|Nanoparticles of {{different}} materials have shown skin’s permeability limitations. In many experiments, gold nanoparticles 40nm in diameter or smaller are used and have shown to penetrate to the epidermis. Titanium oxide (TiO2), zinc oxide (ZnO), and silver nanoparticles are ineffective in penetrating the skin past the stratum corneum. <b>Cadmium</b> <b>selenide</b> (CdSe) quantum dots {{have proven to}} penetrate very effectively when they have certain properties. Because CdSe is toxic to living organisms, the particle must be covered in a surface group. An experiment comparing the permeability of quantum dots coated in polyethylene glycol (PEG), PEG-amine, and carboxylic acid concluded the PEG and PEG-amine surface groups allowed for the greatest penetration of particles. The carboxylic acid coated particles did not penetrate past the stratum corneum.|$|E

2500|$|Clusters can {{be found}} in all classes of {{chemical}} compounds. [...] According to the commonly accepted definition, a cluster consists minimally of a triangular set of atoms that are directly bonded to each other.

[...] Clusters occur in [...] "pure" [...] inorganic systems, organometallic chemistry, main group chemistry, and bioinorganic chemistry. [...] The distinction between very large clusters and bulk solids is increasingly blurred. [...] This interface is the chemical basis of nanoscience or nanotechnology and specifically arise from the study of quantum size effects in <b>cadmium</b> <b>selenide</b> clusters. Thus, large clusters can be described as an array of bound atoms intermediate in character between a molecule and a solid.|$|E

30|$|Quantum dots are {{semiconductor}} nanocrystals {{made from}} a variety of different compounds, such as <b>cadmium</b> and <b>selenide</b> with unique optical and electrical properties [1, 13, 127]. Most quantum dots are composed of heavy metals that are not normally exocytosed from cells, and this can give rise to in vivo cytotoxicity and limited clinical safety. Nevertheless, interest in these structures has resurged with the advent of heavy metal-free quantum dots, which are expected to have less toxicity than earlier designs [128]. A few radiolabeled quantum dots have been reported with a variety of isotopes, such as 125 mTe, 18 [*]F, and 64 Cu [129 – 132]. Cai et al. have reported an amine-fuctionalized quantum dot modified with RGD peptides and DOTA chelator for PET/NIRF imaging of the integrin αvβ 3. Results showed high linear correlation between nuclear and optical signals. In this study, tumor uptake was 4 % ID/g at 18 h post-injection [133].

Typical solid-state techniques, such as reflection, laser assisted photoreflection, resistivity and Hall effect measurements are used as well. A plain relation between crystal structure/film morphology and PEC behavior is established so long as the electrochemical preparation method is capable to explicitly control the deposit structure.

40|$|In {{this work}} two induced, third order {{nonlinear}} effects were demonstrated. Both phenomena were induced on weak probe beams by a pumping beam in the resonant regime of the nonlinear materials. Both demonstrations were phase independent and were accomplished with low power considering the short interaction lengths. ^ The first phenomena demonstrated was {{a reduction in}} a monochromatic probe signal due to a pump signal. The pump and probe were perpendicularly propagated and intersect within a three millimeter square of amorphous zinc selenide. The reduction effect written onto the probe follows a nonlinear profile which saturates with a five percent reduction of the probe signal, while the pump maintains a linear absorption profile. The saturation of the induced effect occurs at low intensity of less than 12 W cm− 2. For a helium neon probe, at 632. 8 nanometers, the pump induced change in the index of refraction, Δn, and the induced change in the absorption coefficient, Δα, were analyzed in the saturation region using Fresnel equations and found to have the values of Δn = 0. 0049 and Δα = 0. 0038 mm − 1. While resonant saturation effects have been seen in semiconductor doped glass before those effects required a copropagating pump that was eight orders of magnitude more intense. ^ The second portion of this work was centered on amorphous zinc selenide cascaded with semiconductor doped glass. The glass is doped with quantum dots of <b>cadmium</b> sulfur <b>selenide</b> that is available from Schott Glass. The pump used was in the resonant regime and copropagated with a white light source as a probe and both were introduced and removed from the cascaded materials by multimode fibers. The cascaded materials acted as a single period grating which preferentially allowed certain wavelengths to pass. When the material was pumped the preferential pass was reversed. The difference between the probe in the pumped and unpumped state was an expanding sinusoidal with a relative change of ± 20 %. The preferential pass and the pump induced shift in the preferential regions is comparable to resonance Fabry Perot etalons with an induced change in the optical path length but is considerably more robust. ...|$|R
