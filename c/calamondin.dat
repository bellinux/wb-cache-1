50|$|Humans have {{deliberately}} bred new {{citrus fruits}} by propagating wild-found seedlings (e.g. clementines), creating or selecting mutations of hybrids, (e.g. Meyer lemon), and crossing different varieties (e.g. 'Australian Sunrise', a finger lime and <b>calamondin</b> cross).|$|E
50|$|The <b>calamondin</b> has {{considerable}} amount of essential oils stored in the rind. However, due to its thin rind, the essential oil yield is quite low. The most common method of extraction is via steam distillation, cold-press method and centrifugal extraction. The calamansi essential oil is used to alleviate symptoms of depression and anxiety, and is widely used as a substitute to lemon or lime essential oil. It can be beneficial as an additive to cleaning products because {{of its ability to}} neutralize odors due to its high limonene content. Since majority of the world's <b>calamondin</b> comes from the Philippines, most of the essential oil supply is found there.|$|E

5000|$|Citrus japonica 'Hindsii' (Kumquat): This fruiting tree {{is one of}} the kumquat varieties, and {{relatives}} with small leaves suitable for indoor bonsai include Citrus japonica 'Margarita', Citrus japonica 'Japonica' (Marumi kumquat), × Citrofortunella mitis, Citrus aurantifolia (Key lime), and Citrofortunella microcarpa (<b>Calamondin).</b> The trees flower and may even bear fruit in pot cultivation.|$|E
50|$|In {{its native}} {{homeland}} in Southeast Asia the <b>calamondin</b> grows well in cool and elevated areas and in sandy soils rich in organic matter. Waterlogged areas are {{not suitable for}} cultivation because no citrus tolerates continuously water soaked soils. Budded or grafted trees will start to bear fruit {{one or two years}} after planting. Trees may live for forty or more years.|$|E
50|$|O-methylated {{flavonoids}} formation {{implies the}} presence of specific O-methyltransferase (OMT) enzymes which accept a variety of substrates. Those enzymes mediate the O-methylation on a specific hydroxyl group, like on 4' (example in Catharanthus roseus) or 3' (example in rice) positions. Those positions can be ortho, meta, para and {{there can be a}} special 3-O-methyltransferase for the 3-OH position. <b>Calamondin</b> orange (Citrus mitis) exhibits all of those activities.|$|E
50|$|Citrus depressa {{is grown}} in Taiwan and Ryukyu Islands. This flat lemon is a {{flowering}} tree {{with an average}} height of 5m. The appearance is similar to <b>Calamondin.</b> The flowers, white and about 3cm in diameter, usually bloom in April. The fruit, which appear around July, weigh about 25~60g. Unripe, the skin is a dark green, which becomes yellow during ripening. The fruits have a very low sugar content and are very sour.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the famous}} crops of Ngaraard is taro and its recipe, which uses taro leaves, coconut milk and land crab, is called demok. These are some other crops of Ngaraard: swamp cabbage (kangkum), tapioca (diokang), sweet potato (chemutii), giant swamp taro (brak), banana, <b>calamondin</b> (kingkang), breadfruits, ysaol, amra tree (titimel), Eugenia plant (chedebsachel), wax apple (rebotel), betelnut tree and pepper leaf (kebui). Ngaraard has a rich soil and plenty of crops {{but only a few}} vegetables.|$|E
50|$|There {{are also}} groups that interbreed {{with the four}} core taxa, but which have not {{historically}} been categorized as citrus. The trifoliate orange and kumquats do not naturally interbreed with the four undisputed citrus taxa due to different flowering times, but hybrids (such as the citrange and <b>calamondin)</b> exist. Australian limes and Clymenia are native to Australia and Papua New Guinea, so they did not naturally interbreed with the four core taxa; {{but they have been}} crossbred with mandarins and calamondins by modern breeders.|$|E
50|$|Toyò {{is used as}} a marinade, an {{ingredient}} in cooked dishes, and most often as a table condiment, usually alongside other sauces such as fish sauce (patís) and sugar cane vinegar (sukà). It is often mixed and served with the juice of the calamansi (× Citrofortunella microcarpa; also called <b>calamondin,</b> limonsito). The combination is known as toyomansî, which can be comparable to the Japanese ponzu sauce (soy sauce with yuzu). Toyò is also a main ingredient in Philippine adobo, one of the more famous dishes of Filipino cuisine.|$|E
50|$|Carl Peter Thunberg {{originally}} classified the kumquats as Citrus japonica in his 1784 book, Flora Japonica. In 1915, Walter T. Swingle reclassified {{them in a}} segregate genus, Fortunella, {{named in}} honor of Robert Fortune. Seven species of Fortunella have generally been recognized—F. japonica, F. margarita, F. crassifolia, F. hindsii, F. obovata and F. polyandra, as well as the recently described F. bawangica. Since the kumquat is a cold hardy species, there are many hybrids between common citrus members and the kumquat (most popularly the <b>calamondin</b> that occurred naturally). Those hybrids are not citrus hybrids, according to Swingle, but reside in a separate hybrid genus which he called × Citrofortunella.|$|E
50|$|In Florida, {{the fruit}} {{is used in}} its fully ripe form with a more mature flavor profile than the unripe version. Tasters note {{elements}} of apricot, tangerine, lemon, pineapple and guava. The peel is so thin, each fruit must be hand snipped from the tree to avoid tearing. The entire fruit minus the stems and seeds can be used. It is hand processed and pureed or juiced and used in various products such as <b>calamondin</b> cake, coulis, marmalade, and jam. The peels can be dehydrated and used as gourmet flavoring with salt and sugar. The fruit was popular with Florida cooks in cake form from the 1920s to 1950s.|$|E
50|$|Philippine noodle soups {{can be seen}} {{served in}} street stalls, {{as well as in}} the home. They show a {{distinct}} blend of Oriental and Western culture adjusted to suit the Philippine palate. They are normally served with condiments such as patis, soy sauce, the juice of the <b>calamondin,</b> as well as pepper to further adjust the flavor. Like other types of soup, they may be regarded as comfort food and are regularly associated with the cold, rainy season in the Philippines. They are normally eaten with a pair of spoon and fork, alternating between scooping the soup, and handling the noodles, and are less commonly eaten with the combination of chopsticks and a soup spoon.|$|E

40|$|Kumquat and <b>calamondin</b> are two small-size citrus fruits. Owing {{to their}} health benefits, they are {{traditionally}} used as folk medicine in Asian countries. However, the research on flavonoids and biological activities of kumquat and <b>calamondin</b> have received less attention. This review summarizes the reported quantitative and qualitative data of phenolic compositions in these two fruits. Effects of maturity, harvest time, various solvent extractions and heat treatment of phenolic compositions, and bioactivities were discussed; distributions of the forms of phenolic compounds existing in kumquat and <b>calamondin</b> were also summarized. Furthermore, biological activities, including antioxidant, antityrosinase, antimicrobial, antitumor, and antimetabolic disorder effects, have also been discussed. Effective phenolic components were proposed for a certain bioactivity. It was found that C-glycoside flavonoids are dominant phenolic compounds in kumquat and <b>calamondin,</b> unlike in other citrus fruits. Up to now, biological activities and chemical characteristics of C-glycoside flavonoids in kumquat and <b>calamondin</b> are largely unknown...|$|E
40|$|Histopathological assays gain {{physiological}} {{insights into}} the mechanisms by which kumquat and <b>calamondin</b> are resistant to citrus canker caused by Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri (Xcc). Unlike Mexican lime, which is highly susceptible to Xcc, <b>calamondin</b> and kumquat leaves challenged with Xcc developed rapid necrosis, resembling a hypersensitive reaction. Fluorescent microscopy examination identified fluorescent materials around the necrotic lesions in kumquat and <b>calamondin</b> leaves challenged with Xcc, but not in Mexican lime. The resistant cultivars inoculated with Xcc exhibited lower antioxidant enzymatic activities and accumulated less H 2 O 2. These modifications serve as physical barriers to ward off pathogen, thereby suppressing lesion development...|$|E
