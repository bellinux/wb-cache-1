Thousands {{of gallons of}} milk are hose-fed from delivery trucks into the manufacturing area, where it is heated to complete the pasteurization of the milk. The heated milk is processed into a stainless steel trough, and the temperature further increased, while the first live cheese cultures and rennet, a coagulant, {{are added to the}} developing mixture. According to Amir Rosenblatt, a cheesemaker at Beecher's, the heating and cheese temperatures used in their cooking process are tightly controlled through the sustainable technology of steam power. [...] "A variation of half a degree [...] can change the flavor of the cheese," [...] he said. Cheesemakers use stainless steel [...] "rakes" [...] to then gather the milk mixture, before allowing it to settle briefly, at which point the cheese is cut repeatedly by hand until it achieves a yogurt-like texture and substance. This process is repeated often, until a desired consistency is reached. The mixture is then drawn away to a new trough where most of the remaining water and whey is drained from the cheese. While the whey is continually pulled from the cheese, cheesemakers constantly separate the cheese by hand into smaller and small stacks of cheese curds, which form as the whey is removed. To complete the curding, a large amount of salt is added to cure the cheese and draw still more whey from it. The curds are finally cut into portions, filled into <b>cheese</b> <b>molds,</b> stacked on top of each other, and the remaining excess moisture is forced from the cheese with a constant [...] of pressure for at least 24 hours, before the finished cheese is stored to age.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is 1) to {{investigate}} the milk processing system in the Balkan Mountains，central Bulgaria， 2) to analyze its characteristics，and 3) to discuss a development history of maturation / non-maturation，mold using / <b>mold</b> non-using in <b>cheese</b> processing. It was confirmed there are fermented milk processing series and solidifying-additives using series in the milk processing system of the central Bulgaria. It was found out that the fermented milk processing series consists of the following sub-series : a) heating lactic fermented milk processing sub-series which produce fermented milk for direct consumption; b) non-heating naturally fermented milk processing sub-series specialized for the production of butter oi 1; c) non-heating naturally fermented milk processing sub-series for the production of naturally fermented milk possible for long-term storage. As for the solidifying-additives using series，it was found out that rennet，citric acid and fermented milk are used as a coagulating agent in cheese production，and brine or both brine and bleu-mold are used in the maturation stage of the cheese making process. Two characteristics of the blue-mold cheese production in central Bulgaria can be distinguished - first，This kind of cheese is produced only during the cold season in winter，and second， the blue mold grows naturally on the cheese. Considering the case study of cheese production in Bulgaria and the natural environment conditions of the Balkan Peninsula，West Asia and West Europe，the development history of mature <b>cheese</b> using <b>mold</b> was considered that 1) the use of rennet possibly originated in the Balkan Peninsula， 2) the use of rennet as a cheese production technique spread from the Balkan Peninsula both to the East (the region of West Asia) and the West (the Westem European region) ， 3) due to the hot climate in West Asia， storage of milk products rather than appreciation of those taste is put on higher priority in the milk processing，and the techniques of non-maturation and non-mold using are applied to the cheese making in the region， 4) in the Balkan Peninsula. two important factors - namely，the cool climate and appreciation of food taste - have contributed to the development of <b>cheese</b> maturation techniques，and <b>mold</b> and non-mold <b>cheese</b> coexist under the environment of not-high humidity due to the feeling of dislike for moldy foods，and 5) cool climate，high humidity and appreciation of food taste in Western Europe are the three key factors which have contributed to the development of mature <b>cheese</b> using <b>mold</b> in the region. 本研究は， 1) ブルガリア中央部バルカン山脈地域に おける乳加工体系を明らかにし， 2) その特徴を分析す ると共に， 3) ブルガリア中央部の事例を通じてチーズ の熟成の有無・カビ利用の有無の発達史を検討すること を目的とした。バルカン山脈地域では発酵乳系列群と凝 固剤使用系列群の技術が確認された。発酵乳系列群の乳 加工技術は，食用の酸乳へと加工する加熱乳酸発酵亜系 列，バターオイル加工に特化した非加熱自然発酵亜系 列，そして，自然発酵でも長期保存が可能となる酸乳を 加工する非加熱自然発酵亜系列より構成されていること が把握された。凝固剤使用系列群の乳加工技術では，凝 固剤としてレンネット，クエン酸，酸乳が用いられてお り，チーズは塩水漬けで熟成され，青カビを用いた熟成 チーズも加工されていることが把握された。バルカン山 脈での青カビチーズは，冬期の冷涼な期間中のみに加工し，青カビが自然に付着してくる加工法であった。バル カン半島，西アジア，西ヨーロッパの自然環境の要因， ブルガリアのチーズの加工法と利用法の事例を通じて， カビを利用した熟成チーズの発達史は， 1) レンネット 利用の起原地はバルカン半島である可能性が高く， 2) レンネット利用はバルカン半島から東方の西アジアと西 方の西ヨーロッパに伝播し， 3) 西アジアでは「暑熱環 境性」であるがために食味性よりも保存性が最優先さ れ，チーズは非熟成・非カビ利用となり， 4) バルカン 半島では， 「冷涼性」と「食味の優越性」によりチーズ は熟成型となり，湿度はそれほどには高くなく，カビに 対する嫌悪感からカビを利用したチーズとカビの非利用 のチーズとが混在することとなり， 5) 西ヨーロッパで は「冷涼性」に「湿潤性」が兼ね備わり， 「食味の優越 性」がカビを利用した熟成チーズへと極めて発達させ た，と考察された。[URL]...|$|R

These dissolved substances may precipitate from the aqueous phase of cheese to form sparingly soluble crystals that can impart a crunchy, gritty, or sandy texture on the cheese. In the present work, optical and diffractometric methods were optimized for use with cheese samples to identify crystal phases in several cheese varieties. These techniques, which included powder X-ray diffractometry (PXRD), single crystal X-ray diffractometry (SCXRD), and petrographic microscopy (PM) have traditionally been used on geological specimens that are {{quite different from the}} cheese samples used in the present study. Nonetheless, these techniques were successfully used to gain valuable insight into crystal development in cheese. Powder X-ray diffractometry was optimized to minimize the occurrence of artifacts that may occur due to the high water content and low crystallinity of some cheese samples. The use of enhanced sample preparation techniques facilitated the identification of organic and inorganic crystal phases such as tyrosine, leucine, brushite (CaHPO 4 · 2 H 2 O), and calcite (CaCO 3) in hard and soft cheeses. SCXRD was used to determine the crystal structures of ikaite and struvite, which had been tentatively identified in washed-rind cheese using PXRD.

In two subsequent aging studies, PXRD was used to determine the approximate timing of crystal nucleation in the rinds of white <b>mold</b> <b>cheese</b> and washed-rind cheese.

This mixture is stirred and heated, as before, until the casein in the milk curdles and adheres to the mass of curd.

Phage was applied at defined time points thereafter, in single or repeated treatments, at 3 × 108 or 1 × 109 pfu/cm 2. With Scott A (103 cfu/cm 2) and a single dose of A 511 (3 × 108 pfu/cm 2) on camembert-type cheese, viable counts dropped 2. 5 logs {{at the end of the}} 21 day ripening period. Repeated phage application did not further inhibit the bacteria, whereas a single higher dose (1 × 109 pfu/cm 2) was found to be more effective. On red-smear cheese ripened for 22 days, Listeria counts were down by more than 3 logs. Repeated application of A 511 further delayed re-growth of Listeria, but did not affect bacterial counts after 22 days. With lower initial Listeria contamination (101 – 102 cfu/cm 2), viable counts dropped below the limit of detection, corresponding to more than 6 logs reduction compared to the control.
