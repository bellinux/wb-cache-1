5000|$|For {{fixed line}} users, it is {{possible}} to override the <b>carrier</b> <b>pre-selection</b> (CPS) on a per-call basis, dialling a special code before the number, e.g. 1280 for BT, 1664 for LowerCall, or 1844 for Daisy. Ofcom defines the range for these as: [...] "124 to 140, 143 to 146, 148 to 149, 160 to 169, and 181 to 189 inclusive. Numbers of up to 5-digits used to access an Indirect Access Provider (‘Type B Access Codes’)".|$|E
5000|$|Eir {{operates}} the largest fixed-line telecommunications {{network in the}} Republic of Ireland, under licence from the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg). Most homes and businesses in the state are dependent on their network. A range of telecommunications services is provided on the network including Business IP, its MPLS platform. Eir have also completed a wholly owned fibre network ring around Northern Ireland and another around Belfast. Their ISP division, Eir Net, provides dial-up services, as well as broadband services (see broadband roll-out, below). Any alarm-monitoring products using SMS are [...] "hardcoded" [...] to work with Eir's SMSC, so will not work on Digiweb, BT, Smart, UPC or Magnet phone networks. DECT SMS handsets are also preprogrammed for Eir's SMSC. Any competing phone service that is not just <b>carrier</b> <b>pre-selection</b> (CPS) of Eir must provide their own SMSC, but even when they do, consumers {{may be unable to}} migrate from eir due to SMSC numbers in equipment that cannot be reprogrammed.|$|E
50|$|Eir {{retains a}} virtual {{monopoly}} of around 70% on fixed-line telephony in the State (the only exceptions being those operated by UPC Ireland cable company (formerly NTL Ireland and Chorus), Digiweb Metro and some fibre offerings from BT, Magnet Networks, Smart and Digiweb). Chorus had offered wireless telephony {{but failed to}} renew their licence. Eir is required to allow <b>carrier</b> <b>pre-selection</b> (CPS). Introduced in Ireland in 2001, CPS allows subscribers to use an alternative provider for all their calls, without the need to dial indirect access codes or numbers, although they still receive a bill from Eir for line rental. Under a wholesale line rental scheme, {{it is possible for}} customers, to have a single bill from an alternative provider, for example, Vodafone, including the cost of Eir line rental, rather than continuing to receive a separate one from Eir for this cost. Unlike the UK, where BT's competitors now can charge less than BT for line rental, it is not yet possible for operators in Ireland to buy the lines from Eir and charge their own rate for line rental, should they wish.|$|E
50|$|On 25 May 2006 the Minister of Communications of South Africa Dr Ivy Matsepe-Casaburri {{established}} the Local Loop Unbundling Committee chaired by Professor Tshilidzi Marwala to recommend the appropriate local loop unbundling models. The Local Loop Unbundling Committee submitted {{a report to}} Minister Matsepe-Casaburri on 25 May 2007. This report recommends that models that permit customers to access both voice and data be offered by many different companies. The models recommended are Full Unbundling, Line Sharing and Bitstream Access. It is recommended that customers should exercise <b>carrier</b> <b>pre-selection</b> and thus be able to switch between service providers. It is also recommended that an organisation be created to manage the local loop and that this organisation should be {{under the guidance of}} the regulator Icasa and that Icasa be capacitated in terms of resources. The committee recommended that service providers approved by Icasa should have access to the telephone exchange infrastructure whenever necessary. The committee recommended that a regulatory guideline be established and be managed by Icasa to guarantee that strategic issues like quality of the local loop be optimised for regulation and delivery of services. Based on this report the Minister has issued policy directives to Icasa to move swiftly with the unbundling process. At the end of March 2010 nothing has happened yet, however a deadline of November 1, 2011 was set by the Minister of Communications for monopoly holder, Telkom SA to finalise the unbundling process.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: <b>Carrier</b> <b>Pre-Selection</b> (CPS) is regulator's {{telecommunication}} policy, {{which allows}} customers {{directly connected to}} the network of one provider to automatically access another company's services when they {{pick up the phone}} to make a call. This paper estimates the economic benefits of CPS in the LM telecommunication market. The economic benefits include substitution of LM calls and mobile phone calls, charge system, number of telephone service providers, technical interconnection among service providers, and access charges among networks.

The regulation of fixed-line telephony has {{a significant impact on}} prices for residential consumers. Liberalization of the telecommunications industry decreased retail prices by about 8. 2 %. The introduction of <b>carrier</b> <b>pre-selection</b> and number portability had a negative impact on price levels. The estimation results also suggest that a 1 % decrease in termination charges on the incumbent network led on average to a 0. 17 % decrease in the cost of usage basket for residential consumers. Furthermore, in the pricing regressions for incumbent local and national calls at peak and off-peak times interconnection charges are significant only in the estimation of national peak prices. A 1 % decrease in single transit interconnection charges on the incumbent network led to a 0. 31 % decrease in incumbent national prices at peak times, as calculated for the average prices in the EU in 2002.
