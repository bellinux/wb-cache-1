40|$|Performance scoring offers credit grantors {{improved}} {{ability to}} manage their consumer loan portfolios. The analytical models on which performance scoring are based employ data from creditors ' accounts receivable ledgers reflecting customer payments and purchases or data from credit reporting agencies. Collected at the "Observation Point, " these data reflect the behavior of customers during the "Performance Period, " usually the preceding six or 12 months. The performance scoring system based on this information is designed to predict customer payment performance in the future, the "Outcome Period. " Creditors have frequently determined historical "roll rates, " that is, the percentages of customers moving from one stage of delinquency to another. Thus, a creditor may know that 25 percent of his customers who are one payment delinquent at the "Observation Point " will be one payment or more delinquent within the next month. However, knowledge of the roll rate permits a creditor to forecast movement of customers through various categories of delinquency only on an average basis. Rather than focus attention on all customers that are one payment behind, {{it would be more}} efficient for a <b>credit</b> <b>grantor</b> to direct collection efforts only to that group of customers most likely to remain delinquent or likely to become more seriously behind in their payments. An illustration of how performance scoring permits creditors to focus on customers whose delinquenc...|$|E

These provisions are therefore likely to reduce over-indebtedness and reckless credit granting, at least in the formal sector. A negative result for consumers, however, could be that <b>credit</b> <b>grantors</b> will be much more reluctant to grant credit in the future, and that, therefore, fewer people will be able to access credit. Further, this could lead to an increase in the number of unregistered and illegal credit providers.|$|R
30|$|The {{financial}} services industry comprises {{a broad range}} of businesses with distinctions that are not clearly distinguished (Asmundson, 2011). That said, they can be broadly categorised into four main groups: monetary financial institutions, other financial institutions, insurance companies or intermediaries, and activities auxiliary to financial intermediation (Burgess, 2011). Monetary financial institutions include banks (i.e. central, investment, and commercial) and building societies. Other financial institutions can include the following: non-bank <b>credit</b> <b>grantors</b> (e.g. <b>credit</b> unions and cooperatives), consumer credit institutions (e.g. payday lenders, pawnbrokers), payment service institutions, electronic money institutions, mortgage and home finance lenders, finance leasing companies, bank holding companies, investment funds, securities dealers, unit trusts and factoring companies, hedge funds, venture capital, private equity, and pension funds (Burgess, 2011).|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{covers the}} field of the {{contract}} law known as the consumer credit law. It deals with the legal protection afforded to the consumer under current South African law with emphasis on the legal position in specific credit agreements contained in standard-form contracts. The thesis focuses on those credit contracts in which the legal relationship between the consumer and the dominant party is contained in the standard-form contracts, specifically credit agreements relating to money lending transactions in which the <b>credit</b> <b>grantor’s</b> rights are secured either by means of mortgage agreement, a suretyship contract, or a deed of cession. In South Africa the right to equality and human dignity, {{as opposed to the}} classical theories of contract: pacta sunt servanda and the principle of freedom of contract, are supported by the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa Act 108 of 1996 which entrenched democratic values permeating all areas of the law including contract law. In this thesis the harmonisation of these classical theories of contract law and the constitutional values of human dignity and equality have been considered. As has been shown in a number of cases, notably those relating to the contracts of suretyship, cession in securitatem debiti, and mortgage, the current law regulating the relationship between the <b>credit</b> <b>grantors</b> and the <b>credit</b> receivers is in need of law reform to fall in line with the constitutional values of equality and human dignity. The greatest difficulty inherent in this area of the law is the reluctance of the courts to intervene at the instance of consumers. The courts would only intervene in the clearest of the cases, and would only do so in the public interest. In this thesis the current South African Law is considered {{in the light of the}} developments elsewhere. The tendency of credit providers to alter the terms of the contracts unilaterally and the growing number of conflicting decisions of the Provincial Divisions of High Court has also been considered. The writer also considers the role of the newly created Consumer Affairs Court. ...|$|R
50|$|For {{most of its}} existence, Equifax has {{operated}} primarily in the business-to-business sector, selling consumer credit and insurance reports and related analytics to businesses {{in a range of}} industries. Business customers include retailers, insurance firms, healthcare providers, utilities, government agencies, as well as banks, credit unions, personal and specialty finance companies and other financial institutions. Equifax sells businesses credit reports, analytics, demographic data, and software. Credit reports provide detailed information on the personal credit and payment history of individuals, indicating how they have honored financial obligations such as paying bills or repaying a loan. <b>Credit</b> <b>grantors</b> use this information to decide what sort of products or services to offer their customers, and on what terms. Equifax also provides commercial credit reports, similar to Dun & Bradstreet, containing financial and non financial data on businesses of all sizes. Equifax collects and provides data through the NCTUE, an exchange of non credit data including consumer payment history on telco and utility accounts.|$|R

It is submitted that (a) these acts be consolidated to simplify matters; (b) {{the provisions of the}} acts are simplified and clarified; (c) a standing committee on consumer and credit legislation be established to do research on these acts on a continuing basis and to recommend appropriate amendments after having considered representations by the legal professions, commerce and consumer groups; (d) the acts are unnecessarily biased towards consumers and <b>credit</b> <b>grantors</b> incur expenses which are legally not recoverable from debtors.

40|$|ABSTRACT Adjustable-rate {{automobile}} and other consumer loans are being offered more frequently. A series of simulations test the risk-return tradeoff faced by consumers and the interest-rate risk v. credit risk faced by lenders. These risks are {{shown to be}} related to the initial contract rate and maturity; timing and amount of rate increase; and form of contract adjustment. While adjustable-rate mortgage loans have been available for quite some time and now comprise a significant portion of the residential mortgage market, adjustable-rate consumer loans are of more recent origin and currently make up only a small portion of the consumer credit market. Nonetheless, the increasing use of adjustable-rate consumer loans (ARLs) raises many of the same issues associated with adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs). THE BASIC ISSUES There are two primary issues: first, the risk return trade-off faced by consumers contemplating ARMs and ARLs; and, second, the interest-rate risk v. credit risk trade-off faced by lenders. As we shall see, the two risks are closely related, although <b>credit</b> <b>grantors</b> also have another source of risk arising from features of ARMs and ARLs that narrow or eliminate the margin between the unpaid balance on the loan and the value of the collateral...|$|R
40|$|Credit scoring is an {{automated}} exercise in predictive analytics deployed by retail lenders and their agents {{to overcome the}} perennial problem of the ‘information asymmetries’ existing between debtors and creditors. Credit scoring systematically outperforms ‘subjective’ decision-making by lenders about loan applications, lowering costs and increasing profitability by boosting the speed and consistency of judgements able to be made about credit risk. This system of expert knowledge {{has emerged as a}} crucial part of the lending infrastructure and a new ‘core competency’ for lenders. The implications for social subjecthood, however, are underexplored: the extant literature on finance and society says little about credit scoring’s effects as a ‘disciplinary device’ on credit consumers, or how scoring systems might accustom would-be borrowers to conduct and conceive of their lives in particular ways. My thesis presents findings from an exploratory sociological study of consumer credit scoring systems in New Zealand. It analyses data gathered in 2013 from seventy women and men in focus groups and open-ended individual interviews about their subjective experiences of debt and credit scoring practices. The research fills a gap in critical social inquiry into consumer credit provision by using an interpretive qualitative approach to identify ways in which the commoditised information platforms administered by credit bureaus in New Zealand are involved in the self-understandings of individuals. The study draws on Marxist, Foucaultian and feminist understandings of finance and the consumer-subject to offer a critical reading of participants’ involvement in the workings of the credit economy. I suggest that the systematic surveillance of borrowers by lending institutions through credit bureaus not only implies new forms of economic control and population management, but extends the instrumental rationality of finance into the realm of society and the self. Credit scoring – a market device that operates as an “objective” site of reality construction and revalorisation of productive and exchange relations – hails us as dutiful consumers and citizens from the spaces and rhythms of financial activity. There is also evidence that it operates as a ‘technology of self’, permitting forms of self-administration whereby individuals constitute themselves as particular types of financially viable beings within the wider interpersonal and intersubjective complex of memories, measures, morals, corporeality, obligation, anxiety, and affect. In this ‘techno-social’ production of the subject, in which credit agencies exist as loci or conduits of governmental intent, individuals located within borrowing collectives can be interpreted variously as: (a) credit subjects, consumers subjectified in service to the debt economy; (b) credit-scoring subjects, hyper-rationalised subjectivating complements to calculative market devices; and (c) creditworthy subjects, cultural obligors forming part of an unruly social unity concerned intersubjectively with emotive and intimate relations with families, co-dependants, employers, colleagues, retailers, <b>credit</b> <b>grantors</b> and institutions. The complex, multifaceted and sometimes contradictory ways in which participants negotiate new knowledges of themselves as sources of profit and governable risks call into question the adequacy of orthodox microeconomic accounts of ‘self-interested’ financial behaviour as a model for economic and social behaviour. They also emphasise how an overly simplistic reliance on the notion of ‘responsibilisation’ in the financialisation of everyday life is evident within some conceptions and critiques of the neoliberal subject. Participants’ experiences and self-understandings, rather, illustrate how the contemporary credit consumer is not simply dominated from above by the structural disciplines of finance capital, but is constituted ascendantly by harnessing individuals’ own capabilities of self-direction and expressions of freedom and desire. What is at stake in the unspoken politics of consumer finance is the targeting of the willing self as the raw material of credit – of the deeper affinities of finance with the discerning and reflexive subject...|$|R
