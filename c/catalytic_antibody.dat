5000|$|An abzyme (from {{antibody}} and enzyme), {{also called}} catmab (from catalytic monoclonal antibody), and most often called <b>catalytic</b> <b>antibody,</b> is a monoclonal antibody with catalytic activity. Abzymes are usually raised in lab animals immunized against synthetic haptens, but some natural abzymes {{can be found}} in normal humans (anti-vasoactive intestinal peptide autoantibodies) and in patients with autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, where they can bind to and hydrolyze DNA. To date abzymes display only weak, modest catalytic activity and have not proved to be of any practical use. [...] They are, however, subjects of considerable academic interest. Studying them has yielded important insights into reaction mechanisms, enzyme structure and function, catalysis, and the immune system itself.|$|E

By inserting the variable regions of this Fab coding sequence into a (NH 2) -VL-linker-VH-(COOH) construct (where VL and VH represent the heavy and light chain variable regions), we have assembled a recombinant gene encoding a catalytic single-chain antigen-binding protein. This protein has been expressed in Escherichia coli and exhibits the same catalytic parameters as the parent monoclonal antibody NPN 43 C 9.

To {{address this problem}} we have developed a broadly applicable drug-masking chemistry that operates {{in conjunction with a}} unique broad-scope <b>catalytic</b> <b>antibody.</b> This masking chemistry is applicable {{to a wide range of}} drugs because it is compatible with virtually any heteroatom. We demonstrate that generic drug-masking groups may be selectively removed by sequential retro-aldol–retro-Michael reactions catalyzed by antibody 38 C 2. This reaction cascade is not catalyzed by any known natural enzyme. Application of this masking chemistry to the anticancer drugs doxorubicin and camptothecin produced prodrugs with substantially reduced toxicity. These prodrugs are selectively unmasked by the <b>catalytic</b> <b>antibody</b> when it is applied at therapeutically relevant concentrations. We have demonstrated the efficacy of this approach by using human colon and prostate cancer cell lines. The antibody demonstrated a long in vivo half-life after administration to mice. Based on these findings, we believe that the system described here has the potential to become a key tool in selective chemotherapeutic strategies...|$|E
40|$|Cocaine {{addiction}} and overdose have long defied specific treatment. To provide a new approach, the high-activity <b>catalytic</b> <b>antibody</b> mAb 15 A 10 was elicited using a transition-state analog for the hydrolysis of cocaine to nontoxic, nonaddictive products. In {{a model of}} cocaine overdose, mAb 15 A 10 protected rats from cocaine-induced seizures and sudden death in a dose-dependent fashion; a noncatalytic anticocaine antibody did not reduce toxicity. Consistent with accelerated catalysis, the hydrolysis product ecgonine methyl ester was increased > 10 -fold in plasma of rats receiving mAb 15 A 10 and lethal amounts of cocaine. In a model of cocaine addiction, mAb 15 A 10 blocked completely the reinforcing effect of cocaine in rats. mAb 15 A 10 blocked cocaine specifically and did not affect behavior maintained by milk or by the dopamine reuptake inhibitor bupropion.

Naturally occurring immunoglobulin M (IgM) class antibodies that hydrolyze Aβ and inhibit Aβ aggregation were identified. The production of these antibodies increases {{as a function of}} age, ostensibly reflecting an attempt by the immune system to protect against the deleterious effect of Aβ accumulation in old age. A search for <b>catalytic</b> <b>antibodies</b> in a library of human immunoglobulins variable (IgV) domains yielded catalysts that hydrolyzed Aβ specifically at exceptionally rapid rates. The catalytic IgVs contained the light-chain variable domains within scaffolds that are structurally reminiscent of phylogenetically ancient antibodies.

40|$|Carbocation {{cyclization}} cascades catalyzed by terpenoid cyclases {{rank among}} the most important and the most complex carbon-carbon bond forming reactions in chemistry and biology. Pentalenene synthase (PS), a 38 kD monomer catalyzes the cyclization of farnesyl diphosphate to pentalenene through a series of highly reactive carbocation intermediates. Using this universal sesquiterpene precursor over 300 sesquiterpenes can be produced. Pentalenene synthase directs the exclusive formation of pentalenene. Such precision is the hallmark of most terpenoid cyclases, which are responsible for the biosynthesis of myriad natural products in all forms of life. The x-ray crystal structure of the Asn 219 Leu PS variant demonstrates the structural changes encountered upon enzyme inactivation and provides insight into the proposed catalytic mechanism. ^ <b>Catalytic</b> <b>antibody</b> technology provides an alternative approach that can be exploited to maximize cyclization product diversity starting from a polyene substrate. Importantly, <b>catalytic</b> <b>antibody</b> cyclases are not limited to a handful of naturally occurring polyene substrates, so their potential product diversity is even greater than that of naturally-occurring terpenoid cyclases. Several antibodies have been generated that catalyzed cationic cyclization reactions. In particular, <b>catalytic</b> <b>antibody</b> HA 5 - 19 A 4 Fab catalyzes the cyclization of a terpenoid-like substrate to a trans-decalin bicyclic product similar to the rings A and B of lanosterol. The x-ray crystal structure of this Fab further verifies the essential structural requirements for cyclization. Surprisingly, the active site template of both pentalenene synthase and HA 5 - 19 A 4 Fab contain similar features although the overall structures differ significantly. ...|$|E

Nevertheless, the misunderstanding of how antibodies can mimic a catalytic activity may hamper the development of therapeutic tools. We thus investigated the structure function roles of residues of a <b>catalytic</b> <b>antibody</b> endowed with a β-lactamase activity. The <b>catalytic</b> <b>antibody</b> 9 G 4 H 9 was generated using the internal image properties of anti-idiotypic antibodies. The single-chain fragment was cloned and produced in Escherichia coli. Based on the structure function knowledge of β-lactamases pattern and on the tridimensional model of the scFv, five residues were selected for mutagenic analysis {{to learn about the}} contribution of putative residues in catalysis. Light chain mutants R 24 A, S 26 A, S 28 A, and E 98 A lost catalytic activity significantly. Mutant K 27 A retained catalytic activity but the estimated KM was affected.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the hypothesis that}} decreased hapten flexibility may lead to increased <b>catalytic</b> <b>antibody</b> activity, we used two closely related immunogens differing only in {{the flexibility of the}} atomic framework around the structural motif of the haptens, analogous to the reaction centre of the corresponding substrates. Identical leaving-group determinants in the haptens and identical leaving groups in the substrates removed the ambiguity inherent in some data reported in the literature. Anti-phosphate and anti-phosphonate kinetically homogeneous polyclonal <b>catalytic</b> <b>antibody</b> preparations were compared by using carbonate and ester substrates respectively, each containing a 4 -nitrophenolate leaving group. Synthetic routes to a new phosphonate hapten and new ester substrate were developed. The kinetic advantage of the more rigid anti-phosphonate/ester system was demonstrated at pH 8. 0 by a 13 -fold advantage in k(cat) /k(non-cat) and a 100 -fold advantage in the proficiency constant, k(cat) /k (non-cat) x K(m). Despite these differences, the pH-dependences of the kinetic and binding characteristics and the results of chemical modification studies suggest closely similar catalytic mechanisms. The possible origin of the kinetic advantage of the more rigid hapten/substrate system is discussed...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAmong the {{numerous}} questions remaining opened about <b>catalytic</b> <b>antibodies</b> (abzymes), {{the understanding of}} the origin of the genes encoding them is of vital significance. An original statistical analysis of genes encoding abzymes is described in the present report. Results suggested that these genes display a high conservation degree with their germline counterpart and a limited number of amino acid changes. Hence, on the contrary with high-affinity antibodies, maturation process by accumulation of somatic hypermutations is not required for the catalytic function. We demonstrated that despite a weak somatic mutation rate, the physicochemical properties of mutated amino acid (AA) are predominantly dissimilar with that of the germline AA. Further, we developed a novel approach in order to analyze the nature of genes encoding <b>catalytic</b> <b>antibodies.</b> For the first time, an unexpected and significant high level expression of rare gene subgroups was noticed and emphasized.

40|$|The low {{abundance}} and activity of <b>catalytic</b> <b>antibodies</b> are major obstacles to their selection from the virtually unlimited repertoire of antibody binding sites. The requirement for new screening methodologies is further emphasized by {{the availability of}} combinatorial libraries, in which a functional polypeptide has to be selected out of millions of possibilities. We present a simple and sensitive screening approach (termed catELISA) based on immobilized substrates and immunodetection of the end product of the catalyzed reaction. The feasibility of catELISA is demonstrated here by the generation of potent ester-hydrolyzing antibodies by direct screening of hybridoma supernatants. We show that this approach is not only facile but general: it is not limited by type of reaction, substrate, or catalyst (enzymes, <b>catalytic</b> <b>antibodies,</b> chemical catalysts). catELISA opens a route to <b>catalytic</b> <b>antibodies</b> that replaces existing lengthy and arduous methods, thus allowing us to expand their number and improve their quality and to address questions {{that would otherwise be}} difficult to answer...|$|R

The particular value of studies on polyclonal <b>catalytic</b> <b>antibodies</b> is discussed briefly. Both the kcat and kcat/K(m) values were shown to increase with increase in pH across a pKa of approx. 9. Group-selective chemical modification studies established that the side chains of tyrosine and arginine residues are essential for catalytic activity, and provided no evidence for the involvement of side chains of lysine, histidine or cysteine residues. The combination of evidence from the kinetic and chemical modification studies and from studies on the pH-dependence of binding suggests that catalysis involves assistance to the reaction of the substrate with hydroxide ions by hydrogen-bond donation at the reaction centre by tyrosine and arginine side chains. This combination of hydrogen-bond donors appears to be a feature common to a number of other hydrolytic <b>catalytic</b> <b>antibodies.</b> High-pKa acidic side chains may be essential for the effectiveness of <b>catalytic</b> <b>antibodies</b> that utilize hydroxide ions...|$|R
40|$|A {{potentially}} general kinetic {{method for}} the investigation of active-site availability in preparations of macromolecular catalysts was developed. Three kinetic models were considered: (a) the conventional two-step model of enzyme catalysis, where the preparation contains only active catalyst (E(a)) and inert (i. e. non-binding, non-catalytic) material (E(i)); (b) {{an extension of the}} conventional model (a) involving only E(a) and E(i), but with non-productive binding to E(a) (in addition to productive binding); (c) a model in which the preparation contains also binding but non-catalytic material (E(b)), predicted to be present in polyclonal <b>catalytic</b> <b>antibody</b> preparations. The method involves comparing the parameters V(max) and K(m) obtained under catalytic conditions where substrate concentrations greatly exceed catalyst concentration with those (klim/obs, the limiting value of the first-order rate constant, k(obs), at saturating concentrations of catalyst; and Kapp/m) for single-turnover kinetics, in which the reverse situation obtains. The active-site contents of systems that adhere to model (a) or extensions that also lack E(b), such as the non-productive binding model (b), may be calculated using [E(a) ](T) =V(max) /klim/obs. This was validated by showing that, for alpha-chymotrypsin, identical values of [E(a) ](T) were obtained by the kinetic method using Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe- 4 -nitroanilide as substrate and the well-known 'all-or-none' spectroscopic assay using N-trans-cinnamoylimidazole as titrant. For systems that contain E(b), such as polyclonal <b>catalytic</b> <b>antibody</b> preparations, V(max) /klim/obs is more complex, but provides an upper limit to [E(a) ](T). Use of the kinetic method to investigate PCA 271 - 22, a polyclonal <b>catalytic</b> <b>antibody</b> preparation obtained from the antiserum of sheep 271 in week 22 of the immunization protocol, established that [E(a) ](T) is less than approx. 8 % of [IgG], and probably less than approx. 1 % of [IgG]...|$|E

The selenocysteine residue is located in the binding site of the antibody and is shown to be crucial for this activity. Of the thiol compounds tested, only GSH is able to serve as substrate for Se- 4 A 4.

40|$|The x-ray {{structure}} of the complex of a <b>catalytic</b> <b>antibody</b> Fab fragment with a phosphonate transition-state analog has been determined. The antibody (CNJ 206) catalyzes the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl esters with significant rate enhancement and substrate specificity. Comparison of this structure {{with that of the}} uncomplexed Fab fragment suggests hapten-induced conformational changes: the shape of the combining site changes from a shallow groove in the uncomplexed Fab to a deep pocket where the hapten is buried. Three hydrogen-bond donors appear to stabilize the charged phosphonate group of the hapten: two NH groups of the heavy (H) chain complementarity-determining region 3 (H 3 CDR) polypeptide chain and the side-chain of histidine-H 35 in the H chain (His-H 35) in the H 1 CDR. The combining site shows striking structural similarities to that of antibody 17 E 8, which also has esterase activity. Both <b>catalytic</b> <b>antibody</b> ("abzyme") structures suggest that oxyanion stabilization plays a significant role in their rate acceleration.

In the presence of antibody 15 A 9 the 1 st order exchange rates for the rapidly exchanged proton of [2 - 13 C]glycine were only 25 and 150 times slower than those observed with tryptophan synthase (EC 4. 2. 1. 20) and serine hydroxymethyltransferase (EC 2. 1. 2. 1). The <b>catalytic</b> <b>antibody</b> increases the 1 st order exchange rates of the α-protons of [2 - 13 C]glycine by at least three orders of magnitude. We propose that this increase is largely due to an entropic mechanism which results from binding the glycine-pyridoxal- 5 ′-phosphate Schiff base. The 1 st and 2 nd order exchange rates of the pro- 2 S proton have been determined but we were only able to determine the 2 nd order exchange rate for the pro- 2 R proton of glycine.

The diversity of this {{response has been}} found to be very narrow in several cases. Some antibodies also catalyse chemical reactions. Such catalytic antibodies are usually identified among those that bind tightly to an analogue of the transition state (TSA) of the relevant reaction; therefore, catalytic antibodies are also thought to have restricted diversity. To further characterise this diversity, we investigated the structure and biochemistry of the <b>catalytic</b> <b>antibody</b> 7 C 8, one of the most efficient of those which enhance the hydrolysis of chloramphenicol esters, and compared it to the other catalytic antibodies elicited in the same immunisation. Results: The structure of a complex of the 7 C 8 antibody Fab fragment with the hapten TSA used to elicit it was determined at 2. 2 Å resolution. Structural comparison with another <b>catalytic</b> <b>antibody</b> (6 D 9) raised against the same hapten revealed that the two antibodies use different binding modes. Furthermore, whereas 6 D 9 catalyses hydrolysis solely by transition-state stabilisation, data on 7 C 8 show that the two antibodies use mechanisms where the catalytic residue, substrate specificity and rate-limiting step differ. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that substantial diversity may be present among antibodies catalysing the same reaction. Therefore, some of these antibodies represent different starting points for mutagenesis aimed at boosting their activity.

Intravenous immunoglobulins, a therapeutic pool of human IgG, is used in patients with donor-specific antibodies, alone or in conjunction with other immunosuppressive treatments, to desensitize the patients and prevent the development of acute graft rejection.
