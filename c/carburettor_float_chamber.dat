500|$|The use of {{carburettors}} {{was calculated}} {{to give a}} higher specific power output, due to the lower temperature, hence greater density, of the fuel/air mixture compared to injected systems. However, the Merlin's <b>float</b> controlled <b>carburettor</b> meant that both Spitfires and Hurricanes were unable to pitch nose down into a steep dive. The contemporary Bf 109E, which had direct fuel injection, could [...] "bunt" [...] into a high-power dive to escape attack, leaving the pursuing aircraft behind because its fuel had been {{forced out of the}} <b>carburettor's</b> <b>float</b> <b>chamber</b> by the effects of negative g-force (g). RAF fighter pilots soon learned to [...] "half-roll" [...] their aircraft before diving to pursue their opponents. [...] "Miss Shilling's orifice", a restrictor in the fuel supply line to restrict flow together with a diaphragm fitted in the <b>float</b> <b>chamber</b> to contain fuel under negative G, went some way towards curing the fuel starvation in a dive; however, at less than maximum power a fuel-rich mixture still resulted. Another improvement was made by moving the fuel outlet {{from the bottom of the}} S.U. carburettor to exactly halfway up the side, which allowed the fuel to flow equally well under negative or positive g.|$|R
50|$|Negative G engine cut-out was not {{a problem}} unique to Merlin-powered fighters since many other pre-war {{aeroplanes}} also used <b>carburettors</b> containing a <b>float</b> <b>chamber.</b> For example, in 1942, the United States acquired a flyable, Japanese Mitsubishi A6M Zero, known as the Akutan Zero. When test-flown, this aircraft was also found to experience engine cut-outs, due to the float-type carburettor of its Nakajima Sakae engine. The Americans devised tactics to counter the Zero in combat that took advantage of this and other results of testing the aircraft.|$|R

50|$|A {{second problem}} with the {{conventional}} carburettor was its good performance in steady conditions, but poor progression: its dynamic ability to respond, such as when suddenly opening the throttle. This could give 'flat spots' in performance, or required great additional complexity to the carburettor such as multiple chokes, emulsion tubes and accelerator pumps. The Fish carburettor metered its fuel flow through a calibrated tapered groove, connected directly to the accelerator pedal and the throttle butterfly. The fuel metering orifice was controlled in immediate proportion to the throttle position, {{in a similar manner}} to the motorcycle slide <b>carburettor.</b> Between the <b>float</b> <b>chamber</b> and the venturi, an additional chamber, unique to the Fish design, contains the metering arm and groove. The arm is attached to the throttle spindle, moves with it, and is drilled with a hollow channel supplying fuel to the jets on the throttle spindle. This arm has an inlet hole at its end, which is a simple drilling and not of precise size. The hole passes over the metering groove, which is a radial arc in one wall of the chamber and it is the width of this groove which is precisely controlled, so as to accurately meter the fuel. As the throttle arm moves to the wide-throttle position, the arm sweeps across to the wider part of the groove, allowing more fuel to flow. The arm is close-fitting within the width of the chamber. As it moves, this close fit has the effect of a vane pump and acts as an accelerator pump to force additional fuel into the jet when the throttle is first opened.|$|R
50|$|The main {{carburettor}} types {{commonly associated}} with Amal are slide carburettors for motorcycles. These were historically distinguishable as two types: the Monobloc with integral, offset <b>float</b> <b>chamber</b> and Concentric, a later development with repositioned <b>float</b> <b>chamber</b> directly under the body and air-slide.|$|R
50|$|The <b>floating</b> <b>chamber</b> {{can become}} fouled and stuck leading to poor feeding. When field {{stripping}} the Ace, the recoil spring is removed after removing the slide. The ejector may be removed before removing the barrel and the <b>floating</b> <b>chamber</b> must be aligned vertically {{to remove the}} barrel from the slide. Once the barrel is removed, the <b>floating</b> <b>chamber</b> can be rotated and separated from the main barrel for cleaning. When the extractor is replaced into the barrel, {{the back of the}} extractor should slide into the rear slot of the slide.|$|R
5000|$|Carburettors are {{provided}} with a <b>float</b> <b>chamber</b> to provide a constant hydrostatic head of fuel above the carburettor's metering jets, thus a constant pressure. The <b>float</b> <b>chamber</b> itself does not vary the pressure according to demand, but it does vary the supply flowrate with demand, to keep this pressure constant.|$|R
50|$|Later {{models were}} {{fitted with a}} bashplate between the lower frame downtubes (by frame number TB879). The bashplate was dual purpose: to stop dirt {{entering}} the air filter, and also to protect the carburettor from damage. Even later models (by frame number TB1029) were fitted with a further small light steel plate shielding the <b>carburettor</b> <b>float</b> bowl and fitted under {{the heads of the}} front two engine mounting bolts.|$|R

50|$|A <b>float</b> <b>chamber</b> is {{a device}} for {{automatically}} regulating {{the supply of}} a liquid to a system. It is most typically found in the carburettor of an internal combustion engine, where it automatically meters the fuel supply to the engine. However, this arrangement is found in many automatic liquid systems, for example the cistern of a toilet {{could be said to}} be a type of <b>float</b> <b>chamber.</b>|$|R
50|$|Williams {{designed}} and built four semi-automatic rifles while in prison. All four used the high pressure gas within the breech as a cartridge was fired to operate their semi-automatic actions. The means used to accomplish this was a <b>floating</b> <b>chamber</b> containing the cartridge that channeled the gas {{at the front of}} the chamber to force the <b>floating</b> <b>chamber</b> backwards into the bolt with sufficient energy to operate the action. Rearward movement of the chamber was limited to a short stroke to impact the bolt face, in effect making the <b>floating</b> <b>chamber</b> a short stroke gas piston. All four rifles are part of the permanent David Marshall Williams display in the North Carolina Museum of History.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{intention of}} the Fish carburettor was to avoid {{the problems of the}} <b>float</b> <b>chamber,</b> and its sensitivity to sideways forces from acceleration and cornering. In the conventional carburettor, a venturi in the airflow creates a lowered pressure and this is enough to encourage the flow of fuel through the metering jets. The flow rate is critically sensitive to the fuel pressure at the jet, i.e. the hydrostatic head owing to the depth of fuel between the jet and the float level. Any sloshing within the <b>float</b> <b>chamber</b> affected this. Fish's design kept the <b>float</b> <b>chamber,</b> but avoided the dependency of flow rate on fuel depth. The <b>float</b> <b>chamber</b> was sealed and pressurised by a ram air effect from the air inlet, which then caused fuel to flow through the metering jet. This flow rate was entirely independent of fuel level, but did remain approximately proportional to the mass airflow. The Fish carburettor was also sensitive to mass airflow, rather than volume airflow, making it self-compensating for changes due to temperature or altitude.|$|R
5000|$|Early {{machine guns}} were {{expensive}} to operate. The United States Army wanted to train machine gun crews with less-expensive ammunition. To do this, {{they needed the}} [...]22 LR cartridge to operate firearms designed to use the [...]30-06 cartridge. David Marshall Williams invented a method that involved a separate <b>floating</b> <b>chamber</b> that acted as a gas piston with combustion gas impinging directly {{on the front of}} the <b>floating</b> <b>chamber.</b> [...] The [...]22 caliber Colt Service Ace conversion kit for the [...]45 caliber M1911 pistol also used Williams' system, which allows a much heavier slide than other conversions operating on the unaugmented blowback mechanism and makes training with the converted pistol realistic. A <b>floating</b> <b>chamber</b> provides additional force to operate the heavier slide, providing a felt recoil level similar to that of a full power cartridge.|$|R

50|$|The Rothensee {{boat lift}} {{utilizes}} <b>floats</b> in <b>float</b> <b>chambers</b> {{in a similar}} manner to that at Henrichenburg. In this case only two <b>float</b> <b>chambers</b> were needed. The lift follows the patented plans of Rudolf Mussaeus.The trough is 85 metres long and 12.2 metres wide and is supported on two 36 metre long 10 metre in diameter cylindrical floats submerged in two 60 metre deep <b>float</b> <b>chambers.</b> The <b>floats</b> are internally sub-divided into three separate chambers. Each of these chambers is filled with air compressed to a pressure appropriate to its depth in the <b>float</b> <b>chamber</b> in order to prevent implosion. The floats provide buoyant lift equivalent to 5,400 tonnes, enough to balance the weight of the trough and its load of water and ship. The trough is set in motion using four worm geared shafts, 27.3 metres long and 42 centimetres in diameter moved by eight 44 kW electric motors. Because the trough and its load are in equilibrium with the floats only the friction opposing the troughs movement needs to be overcome by the motors. A complete lift can be achieved using less than 500 kW of power.|$|R
50|$|Winchester {{introduced}} the shotgun in 1954 as their Model 50 Automatic Shotgun in 12 and 20 gauge. The shotgun featured an Inertia Operated Bolt Lock designed by Williams. The bolt block and cartridge sat within a large <b>floating</b> <b>chamber.</b> When {{the gun was}} fired the gas forward of the <b>floating</b> <b>chamber</b> forced the chamber to the rear approximately 1/10th of an inch in a short stroke that generated the energy necessary for the bolt block to disengage {{the rear of the}} <b>floating</b> <b>chamber</b> and operate the semi-automatic action. This was the first semi-automatic shotgun with a fixed non-recoiling barrel. In 1960 Winchester {{introduced the}}ir Model 59 Automatic Shotgun which also utilized the Williams design from the Model 50. This model featured the Winlite 'glass' barrel; it was a thin tube wrapped with micro-filament glass fibre. This model could bullied with the first ever screw-in Versalite choke tubes.|$|R
50|$|One {{drawback}} of {{the basic}} type of <b>float</b> <b>chamber</b> described is that it only operates correctly when {{it is the right}} way up, so more sophisticated solutions are needed in aircraft.|$|R
50|$|The {{overall height}} of the lift {{measured}} {{from the base of}} the underground <b>float</b> <b>chambers</b> to the upper cross beams is 97.21 metres. The water depth in the trough is usually 2.5 metres.|$|R
50|$|The Reece-Fish is a {{variable}} choke, side- or downdraught design, with few moving parts to wear or adjust. To change from side-draught to downdraught, the installer simply rotates the <b>float</b> <b>chamber</b> {{to suit the}} carburettor orientation.|$|R
50|$|The Williams {{design was}} not {{accepted}} by Remington. The rifle was redesigned by Remington employees K. Lowe and C.C. Loomis using the Williams <b>floating</b> <b>chamber.</b> The rifle was designated the Remington Model 550 and introduced in 1941.|$|R
5000|$|About 1937 Remington Arms {{contracted}} Williams {{to produce}} a [...]22 long rifle caliber rimfire semi-automatic rifle utilizing his <b>floating</b> <b>chamber</b> intended for the commercial market.

2500|$|The remedy, {{invented by}} Beatrice [...] "Tilly" [...] Shilling, was {{to fit a}} metal {{diaphragm}} {{with a hole in}} it, across the <b>float</b> <b>chambers.</b> It partly cured the problem of fuel starvation in a dive. The device was commonly referred to as 'Miss Shilling's Orifice'.|$|R
50|$|The Concentric {{design with}} non-protruding <b>float</b> <b>chamber</b> was both slimmer and shorter, {{enabling}} easier mounting to two-port cylinder heads. Left or right sided carburettors could be produced from {{basically the same}} die-casting, and the design was compatible with up to 40 degrees of downdraught.|$|R
50|$|The early {{versions}} of the Rolls-Royce Merlin engine came equipped with a SU carburettor. When these aeroplanes performed a negative G force manoeuvre (pitching the nose hard down), fuel was forced upwards {{to the top of}} the <b>float</b> <b>chamber</b> of the <b>carburettor</b> rather than into the engine, leading to loss of power. If the negative G continued, the fuel would collect in the top of the <b>float</b> <b>chamber,</b> forcing the <b>float</b> to the floor of the chamber. This would in turn open the needle valve to maximum, flooding the carburettor with fuel and drowning the supercharger with an over-rich mixture. This would lead to a rich mixture cut-out, which would shut down the engine completely, a serious drawback in combat.|$|R
25|$|The double-concentric siphon and {{the funnel}} with bent end for pouring in {{different}} liquids, {{neither of which}} appear in any earlier Greek works, were also original inventions by the Banu Musa brothers. Some of the other mechanisms they described include a <b>float</b> <b>chamber</b> and an early differential pressure.|$|R
50|$|David Marshall Williams (November 13, 1900 - January 8, 1975) was the American {{firearms}} {{designer of}} the <b>floating</b> <b>chamber</b> and the short-stroke piston. Both designs used the high pressure gas generated {{in or near the}} breech of the firearm to operate the action of semi-automatic firearms like the M1 Carbine.|$|R
50|$|Unlike carburetor-based systems, {{where the}} <b>float</b> <b>chamber</b> {{provides}} a reservoir, fuel injected systems depend on an uninterrupted flow of fuel. To avoid fuel starvation when subject to lateral G-forces, vehicles are often provided with an anti-surge vessel, usually integrated in the fuel tank, but sometimes as a separate, small anti-surge tank.|$|R
2500|$|Working for the U.S. Ordnance Office, David Marshall Williams {{developed}} a [...]22 training {{version of the}} M1911 using a <b>floating</b> <b>chamber</b> to give the [...]22 long rifle rimfire recoil similar to the [...]45 version.

5000|$|The new {{boat lift}} was opened in 1962 {{and has a}} trough length of 90 metres, a width of 12 metres, and a draft of 3 metres. [...] It was capable of lifting vessels of up to 1350 tonnes. This lift {{utilizes}} the same construction principles as the old lift but using only two floats in two <b>float</b> <b>chambers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|David Marshall Williams (a noted {{designer}} for the U.S. Ordnance Office and later Winchester) developed {{a mechanism to}} allow firearms designed for full-sized cartridges to fire [...]22 caliber rimfire ammunition reliably. His system used a small 'piston' that incorporates the chamber. When the cartridge is fired, {{the front of the}} <b>floating</b> <b>chamber</b> is thrust back by gas pressure impinging {{on the front of the}} chamber as in a traditional piston. This, added to the blowback energy imparted on the cartridge, pushes the bolt back with greater energy than either force alone. Often described as accelerated blowback, this amplifies the otherwise anemic recoil energy of the [...]22 rimfire cartridge. [...] Williams designed a training version of the Browning machine gun and the Colt Service Ace [...]22 long rifle version of the M1911 using his system. The <b>floating</b> <b>chamber</b> is both a blowback and gas operated mechanism.|$|R
40|$|The study {{tested the}} use of dynamic <b>floating</b> <b>chambers</b> to measure {{emissions}} factors of ammonia (NH 3), nitrous oxide (N 2 O) methane (CH 4) and carbon dioxide (CO 2) from stored pig slurry and measured the variations of the emissions in time and space. In 2006, dynamic <b>floating</b> <b>chambers</b> {{were used for the}} continuous measurement of gaseous emissions from two experimental tanks filled with fattening pig slurry stored for two summer months and in a pit filled repeatedly with mixed slurry between October and March. To check the influence of air speed on gaseous emissions, each tank was fitted with a chamber: one operating with an air speed at the surface of the slurry of 0. 01 m/s, the other with a speed of 1 m/s. To ascertain the spatial variability of the emissions, two identical chambers were used for the pit: one was regularly displaced {{across the surface of the}} slurry; the other was fixed throughout the storage period. The measurements obtained were compared with the nitrogen and carbon input-output mass balances of the slurry. The results show that the measured gaseous emissions explain from 4 to 38 % of the total nitrogen losses and from 61 to 285 % of the total carbon losses. The use of such dynamic <b>floating</b> <b>chambers</b> is not an appropriate method to evaluate the gaseous emission factors from slurry storage. The kinetics of the emissions underline the importance of measurement periods and their duration to measure emission factors...|$|R

50|$|A <b>float</b> <b>chamber</b> {{works by}} {{allowing}} liquid within the chamber {{to lift a}} float which is linked to a valve which regulates the liquid intake. When the level is low, the float drops and opens the valve, allowing in liquid until the float rises sufficiently to close off the valve again. This is identical in principle to the ballcock valve.|$|R
