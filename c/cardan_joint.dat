50|$|Double <b>Cardan</b> <b>joints</b> {{are similar}} to double Cardan shafts, except that {{the length of the}} {{intermediate}} shaft is shortened leaving only the yokes; this effectively allows the two Hooke's joints to be mounted back to back. DCJs are typically used in steering columns, as they eliminate the need to correctly phase the universal joints at the ends of the intermediate shaft (IS), which eases packaging of the IS around the other components in the engine bay of the car. They are also used to replace Rzeppa style constant-velocity joints in applications where high articulation angles, or impulsive torque loads are common, such as the driveshafts and halfshafts of rugged four wheel drive vehicles. Double <b>Cardan</b> <b>joints</b> require a centering element that will maintain equal angles between the driven and driving shafts for true constant velocity rotation. This centering device requires additional torque to accelerate the internals of the joint and does generate some additional vibration at higher speeds.|$|R
5000|$|The Thompson {{constant}} velocity joint (TCVJ), {{also known as a}} Thompson coupling, assembles two <b>cardan</b> <b>joints</b> within each other to eliminate the intermediate shaft. A control yoke is added to keep the input and output shafts aligned. The control yoke uses a spherical pantograph scissor mechanism to bisect the angle between the input and output shafts and to maintain the joints at a relative phase angle of zero. The alignment ensures constant angular velocity at all joint angles. Eliminating the intermediate shaft and keeping the input shafts aligned in the homokinetic plane greatly reduces the induced shear stresses and vibration inherent in double cardan shafts. While the geometric configuration does not maintain {{constant velocity}} for the control yoke that aligns the <b>cardan</b> <b>joints,</b> the control yoke has minimal inertia and generates little vibration. Continuous use of a standard Thompson coupling at a straight-through, zero-degree angle will cause excessive wear and damage to the joint; a minimum offset of 2 degrees between the input and output shafts is needed to reduce control yoke wear. Modifying the input and output yokes so that they are not precisely normal to their respective shafts can alter or eliminate the [...] "disallowed" [...] angles.|$|R

Many early uses in the 19th century appear in {{translations}} from French or are strongly influenced by French usage.

50|$|The Klien-Lindner axle uses a double, or hollow, axle, one {{inside the}} other. It has a hollow axle (Hohlachse) on the outside, {{connected}} at its centre by a <b>Cardan</b> <b>joint</b> to a fixed driving axle running through it. The <b>Cardan</b> <b>joint</b> comprises two spherical {{elements that are}} interlinked - a solid one on the fixed axle and a hollow one on the outer hollow axle, each oriented at 90° to the other that transfer the driving forces from the rigid axle to the hollow one. The hollow spheroid acts {{as a sort of}} link motion. In this way the hollow axle can be turned by the fixed axle. In addition, the connecting link is shaped so that the axles can slide relative to one another, parallel to their axes, to a small extent. The degree to which the hollow axle can swivel is set by the outer diameter of the fixed axle and the internal diameter of the hollow one.|$|E
5000|$|The {{universal}} joint, one of {{the earliest}} means of transmitting power between two angled shafts, was invented by Gerolamo Cardano in the 16th century. The fact that it failed to maintain constant velocity during rotation was recognized by Robert Hooke in the 17th century, who proposed the first constant velocity joint, consisting of two <b>Cardan</b> <b>joints</b> offset by 90 degrees, so as to cancel out the velocity variations. This is the [...] "double Cardan", shown below. Many different types of constant-velocity joints have been invented since then.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{notation}} for kinematic structures which allows a unified description of serial, parallel, and hybrid robots or articulated machine tools. During the past decades, the well-known Denavit-Hartenberg parameters {{have been used}} widely to describe serial kinematics of robots in science and industry. Till now, such a common notation for parallel manipulators {{has not yet been}} accepted. This paper tries to fill this gap by presenting a new notation, which is based on the graph representation known from gear trains. In parallel manipulators, spherical and <b>cardan</b> <b>joints</b> are widely used. In order to describe these kinds of joints, the well- known DHparameter notation has been extended, so that, to each joint as many joint variables can be assigned as degrees of freedom exist. The notation is not only very useful for design, programming, and simulation of parallel robots; it also can be applied as a convention to refer to parallel or hybrid kinematic structures elsewhere.

The deck longitudinal beams are supported by nine transverse box beams, slightly tapered at the end, stretching outside the deck width. The ends of these transversal beams are connected to nine couples of hangers, having tubular section. The hangers lie onto the same inclined planes of the arches and are normal to the arches axes.

40|$|Some {{mechanical}} systems with gaps {{such as in}} disc brakes and <b>Cardan</b> <b>joints</b> exhibit nonlinearity under certain load conditions, which is unpredictable and highly sensitive to initial conditions. Previous studies were mainly focused on either a single-degree-of-freedom (DOF) system or a flexible beam with uniform elastic foundation. The analysis of this thesis {{is a combination of}} these two where gaps are first introduced to a flexible beam model. A model of a beam resting on compliant foundation with gaps has been developed and analyzed. The assumed modes method is used to derive the equations of motion (EOM 2 ̆ 7 s) for the system. The responses of both rigid and flexible beam systems with linear piecewise contact vibration is considered. For the rigid beam system with only transverse DOF, the piecewise linear function method and non-dimension analysis are used to determine the solution. For the multi-DOF system, the EOM 2 ̆ 7 s are solved by numerical time integration. The pseudo-arc continuation and Floquet multipliers provide the completed frequency response along with relevant stability information. The primary resonance has been analyzed in different parameters. Several types of bifurcations are observed around the resonant frequency, some leading to chaotic motion within a small range of excitation frequencies. For the parametric analysis, the effect of gaps, excitation force, constraint load, damping and number of springs on the response are discussed, which are used to describe the types of nonlinear response (softening/hardening or both) shown on the resonant peaks. ...|$|R

40|$|Lower {{back pain}} is {{prevalent}} {{in society and}} manual lifting has been linked as one potential cause {{of these types of}} injuries. Therefore, the 3 dLift biomechanical model was developed in this research with the goal of quantitatively analyzing lifting motions. The model divided the body into fifteen segments that were connected by fourteen anatomical joints. During experimental trials, a volunteer subject lifted an object using four different lifting combinations: symmetric leglifts, asymmetric leglifts, symmetric backlifts, and asymmetric backlifts. In order to individualize the 3 dLift model, anthropometric parameters were estimated using measurements taken on the subject. During the lifting trials, the subject wore reflective markers placed on anatomical landmarks, the motions of which were tracked by five video cameras. The subject also stood with each foot on a separate force platform that was used to determine ground reaction forces and centers of pressure. Signal processing methods were utilized to predict the marker positions that were obscured during the lifting trials, and digital filtering was implemented to attenuate noise in the data. After reducing the experimental errors, the segment coordinate axes, <b>Cardan</b> angles, <b>joint</b> center positions, and mass center positions were calculated. The changes in the segment orientations with respect to time were then analyzed to determine the three-dimensional kinematics of the segments. Anthropometric, video, and force platform information were combined in equations of motion that were derived to predict the forces and moments occurring at the joints during the lifting motions. A lower body formulation was developed that started with the measured ground reactions at the feet and proceeded through the segments to the T 10 /T 11 intervertebral joint. Similarly, an upper body formulation was derived that began with a known lifted load at the hands and continued through the segments to the same T 10 /T 11 intervertebral joint. While predicting joint forces and moments, the two formulations also served as a means of validating the 3 dLift model by comparing the results at the T 10 /T 11 joint. While there is much work yet to be done in this research area, the 3 dLift model takes the first steps by developing a systematic methodology for studying lifting motions...|$|R

With the objective of overcoming such issues, the present study compared the effect of three local frame definitions on local axis orientations and joint angles of the fingers and the wrist. Three local frames were implemented for each segment. The "Reference" frames were aligned with global axes during a static neutral posture. The "Landmark" frames were computed using palpated bony landmarks. The "Functional" frames included a flexion-extension axis estimated during functional movements. These definitions were compared {{with regard to the}} deviations between obtained local segment axes and the evolution of <b>joint</b> (<b>Cardan)</b> angles during two test motions. Each definition resulted in specific local frame orientations with deviations of 15 ° in average for a given local axis. Interestingly, these deviations produced only slight differences (below 7 °) regarding flexion-extension Cardan angles indicating that there is no preferred method when only interested in finger flexion-extension movements. In this case, the Reference method was the easiest to implement, but did not provide physiological results for the thumb. Using the Functional frames reduced the kinematic cross-talk on the secondary and tertiary Cardan angles by up to 20 ° indicating that the Functional definition is useful when investigating complex three-dimensional movements. Globally, the Landmark definition provides valuable results and, contrary to the other definitions, is applicable for finger deformities or compromised joint rotations. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
