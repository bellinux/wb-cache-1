This total cash-ﬂow stream {{is divided into}} its {{positive}} and negative parts, <b>called</b> <b>distributions</b> (dist(t)) and capital <b>calls</b> (call(t)). <b>Distributions</b> are the cash ﬂows returned to the LP from the PE fund (net of fees) when the fund successfully sells a company. Capital calls are the LP’s investments into the fund, including the payment of ongoing management fees.

50|$|Through the 1980s {{attention}} {{turned from}} pure hardware to software development. The BNR Toronto lab introduced Meridian Mail in the 1980s, which {{went on to}} be a very successful product and forced the introduction of similar products from other telephony vendors. They later added automatic <b>call</b> <b>distribution</b> and other similar services.|$|E
50|$|In 1991, LaRosa's {{invested}} heavily in the implementation and marketing of a single number <b>call</b> <b>distribution</b> center for delivery and carry out orders.

30|$|Following [19], in {{this work}} {{it is assumed that}} {{customers}} return their products to those facilities from which the products are distributed. Unlike [19], in the network studied here, these facilities are not plants, but facilities for distribution and collection of products, <b>called</b> <b>distribution</b> and collection centres (DCCs). Furthermore, in [19] a single product type is considered, whereas {{in this work}} multiple product types are studied.|$|R
50|$|Most office {{telephone}} {{systems have}} some facility for recording calling volumes, and incoming call timing. Dispatch centers use Automatic <b>call</b> <b>distribution</b> (ACD) groups {{which can be}} evaluated for metrics such as average wait time, abandoned calls, and calls per hour. These numeric data can be entered into spreadsheets for analysis of trends.|$|E

50|$|Private Branch Exchange (PBX) was a {{telephone}} exchange device that {{acted as a}} mini-switchboard to route phone calls. The closed nature of PBXs limited flexibility, and a system was designed to enable common computing devices to make routing decisions. The automated form of this technology developed into the automated <b>call</b> <b>distribution</b> system, where issued information about incoming calls would direct a response.|$|E

30|$|Using power {{transformation}} of a random variable may {{offer a more}} flexible distribution model by adding a new parameter. Ghitany et al.
