25|$|Sephy, {{living with}} Callum's mother, Meggie, becomes {{increasingly}} fond of her daughter, Callie Rose. Callum's guard, Jack, delivers a letter, written by Callum before he died, {{saying that he}} never loved her and <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> she was stupid enough to fall for him. Meggie tries to make Sephy believe that Callum was forced to write the letter {{by the rest of}} the gang, but the letter is so hurtful that Sephy believes it and becomes full of postnatal depression. She meets Jaxon, a hot-tempered man with a band, the Midges. He offers Sephy a singing part, but the noughts are prejudiced against her because she is a cross. She begins to neglect Callie Rose.|$|E
25|$|When the {{black-chested buzzard-eagle}} was first {{described}} by Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot in 1819, it {{was placed in}} the genus Spizaetus, as Spizaetus melanoleucus. Nowadays, however, the monotypic genus Spizastur is merged in Spizaetus, and the black-and-white hawk-eagle, originally described as by Vieillot three years earlier as Buteo melanoleucus, is now known as Spizaetus melanoleucus. The earlier use of the specific epithet melanoleucus for the black-and-white hawk-eagle technically precludes its use for the black-chested buzzard-eagle, except when it is placed in Geranoaetus. In fact, in the mid-20th century Buteo fuscescens was the prevailing name for the black-chested buzzard-eagle for some years, but it was eventually dismissed as erroneous. This specific name was established – as Spizaetus fuscescens – by Vieillot for the immature of the black-chested buzzard-eagle at the very same time as he described the adult, because he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> such differently-colored birds were conspecific.|$|E

In 2010, during an interview with Larry King, Nelson expressed his doubts with regards to the attacks and the official story. Nelson explained that he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the buildings could collapse due to the planes, attributing instead the result to an implosion.|$|E

500|$|The revelations {{from the}} trial cast Lim as evil incarnate {{in the minds}} of Singaporeans. [...] Some {{citizens}} [...] <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> anyone would willingly defend such a man. [...] They called Cashin to voice their anger; a few even issued death threats against him. [...] On the other hand, Knight's name spread among Singaporeans as the man who brought Adrian Lim to justice, boosting his career. [...] He handled more high-profile cases, and became the director of the Commercial Affairs Department in 1984. [...] He would maintain his good reputation until his conviction for corruption seven years later.|$|E
500|$|Written by series creators Cheryl Heuton and Nicolas Falacci, {{the episode}} was filmed twice, once in Boston, Massachusetts {{and once in}} Los Angeles, California, with two {{different}} casts using two somewhat different scripts. The test audience <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the three men who portrayed the family {{could be related to}} each other, so the producers made cast changes to the family. [...] They also made several changes {{to the rest of the}} cast to accommodate the changes in the script. [...] Heuton and Falacci changed the script to focus on the brothers' relationship with each other. [...] When filming finished, CBS picked up the episode and the series three weeks later.|$|E
500|$|Following George W. Bush's {{reelection in}} 2004, she urged {{her husband to}} run again for President, later saying: [...] "I {{literally}} wore black for a week.

I was so against the [...] And I said to Joe, 'You've got to change this, {{you have to change}} this.'" [...] During Joe Biden's 2008 campaign to be the Democratic nominee, she continued to teach during the week and would join him for campaigning on weekends. She said that she would have taken an activist role in addressing education as her chief focus of concern as a potential First Lady. She also said that she was basically apolitical and would not seek inclusion in Cabinet meetings.|$|E

500|$|The {{idea for}} [...] "Mother Simpson" [...] was pitched by Richard Appel, {{who decided to}} do {{something}} about Homer's mother, who previously had only been mentioned once. Many of the writers <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> an episode about Homer's mother had not previously been produced. Part of the fun of an episode about Homer's mother for the writers was {{that they were able to}} solve several little puzzles, such as where Lisa's intelligence came from. The ending shot with Homer gazing at the sky was decided at the table read, but the drawing at the end was inserted by David Silverman because it was felt that the scene was so touching that no other lines were needed. As a result, no promos were aired over the credits during the original airing of the episode. Bill Oakley has admitted that he always gets teary-eyed when he watches the ending.|$|E
500|$|In March 1953, {{three months}} before the Rosenbergs' executions, he wrote a letter for his {{attorney}} to deliver to President Eisenhower asking for their sentences to be commuted to prison terms so that they would have an opportunity to confess. He wrote: [...] "if these two die, I shall live {{the rest of my life}} with a very dark shadow on my conscience". He described his own testimony as [...] "an act of contrition for the wrong I had done my country, my family and myself" [...] and explained how he now viewed its consequences: [...] "Here I had to take the choice of hurting someone dear to me, and I took it deliberately. I <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> this would be the outcome. May God in His mercy change that awful sentence." [...] That same month he admitted he had stolen a few ounces of uranium-238 from a bomb laboratory at Los Alamos years before and had tossed it into the East River in 1950 after he first denied having stolen it.|$|E
500|$|Alice and Louis {{arrived at}} Bingen on 12 July 1862 and {{were greeted by}} cheering crowds {{gathered}} in spite of pouring rain. After being introduced to town officials, they took a train to Mainz, where they had breakfast, before taking a steamer along the Rhine to Gustavsburg. From there, they took a train to Darmstadt, where they were greeted with great enthusiasm. Alice wrote back to her mother that [...] "I believe the people never gave so hearty a welcome", while her sister Helena wrote that [...] "nothing {{could have been more}} enthusiastic than her entry into Darmstadt was″. Alice did not adapt immediately to her new surroundings. She was homesick, and <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> while she was so far away from England, her father was not still alive and comforting her mother. The Queen confided to her journal: Already nearly a fortnight since our dear Alice has left and strange to say – much as she has been to me – and dear and precious as a comfort and an assistance, I hardly miss her at all, or felt her going – so utterly alone am I – by that one dreadful loss – that one thought, that everything passed by unheeded! ...|$|E

500|$|Beauregard {{attempted}} to concentrate his small forces before Sherman could reach Columbia, South Carolina, the state capital. His urgent dispatches to Richmond {{were treated with}} disbelief—Davis and Robert E. Lee (now the general in chief of all the Confederate armies) <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Sherman was advancing without a supply line as quickly as Beauregard was observing him do. Also concerned about what he considered Beauregard's [...] "feeble health," [...] Lee recommended to Davis that he be replaced by Joseph E. Johnston. The change of command came on February 22 and Beauregard, although outwardly cooperative and courteous to Johnston, was bitterly disappointed at his replacement. For {{the remainder of the}} war, Beauregard was Johnston's subordinate, assigned to routine matters without combat responsibilities. Johnston and Beauregard met with President Davis on April 13 and their assessment of the Confederate situation helped convince Davis that Johnston should meet with Sherman to negotiate a surrender of his army. The two surrendered to Sherman near Durham, North Carolina, on April 26, 1865, and were paroled in Greensboro on May 2. Beauregard traveled to Mobile and then took a U.S. naval transport to his hometown of New Orleans. In August that year Beauregard's house was surrounded by troops who suspected he was harbouring Edmund Kirby Smith. All the inhabitants were locked in a cotton press overnight. Beauregard complained to General Philip Sheridan who expressed his annoyance at his erstwhile enemy's treatment.|$|E
500|$|When {{starting}} {{out as a}} comedy writer, Appel recalled: [...] "One reason I caught up to my contemporaries is that when I started to send out my scripts, the idea that I'd been on the Lampoon, even 8 or 10 years before, was a credential I could use." [...] Appel got his first television job when David Mirkin hired him for the writing staff of The Simpsons in 1994, initially on a ten-week contract, {{and served as a}} writer and producer there for four years. There, he wrote seven episodes, often employing the use of [...] "joke sequences, a narrative approach to humor that eschews the quick laugh in favor of something that develops over time." [...] Appel found work on The Simpsons to be a learning curve because it was a [...] "very tough show to write for." [...] His first episode was season seven's [...] "Mother Simpson". Appel was desperately trying to think of a story idea to show and decided that he had to really reach out and opted to do something about Homer's mother, who previously had only been mentioned once. He named her Mona Simpson, after his wife. Many of the writers <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> an episode about Homer's mother had not previously been produced. The writers used the episode to solve several little puzzles, such as where Lisa's intelligence came from. Also for season seven he penned [...] "Bart on the Road", in which he utilized the plot devices of [...] "go to work with your parents day" [...] and Bart getting a driving license, and contributed to the episode [...] "22 Short Films About Springfield"; the two segments he wrote for the episode (one about Marge, the other about Lionel Hutz) were both cut. Appel wrote two episodes from season eight, [...] "Bart After Dark" [...] and [...] "The Secret War of Lisa Simpson", as well as season nine's [...] "The Two Mrs Nahasapeemapetilons" [...] and season 10's [...] "When You Dish Upon A Star".|$|E

2500|$|The general {{response}} was [...] "as the Westminster Review put it, that Gosse's theory was 'too monstrous for belief.'"

2500|$|Using helicopters, Marines landed behind Taliban lines {{into areas}} where {{coalition}} forces {{had never been}} before. Simultaneously, other Marine elements pushed into remote areas by vehicle convoys. The initial stages of the operation were so sudden that Taliban forces were apparently taken by surprise.

2500|$|After the Tehran Conference, the Allies shifted {{support from}} royalist Chetniks to {{communist}} Partisans.

2500|$|But Fox's radical {{position}} {{soon became}} too extreme {{for many of}} his followers, particularly old Whig friends like the Duke of Portland, Earl Fitzwilliam and the Earl of Carlisle. Around July 1794 their fear of France outgrew their resentment towards Pitt for his actions in 1784, and they crossed the floor to the Government benches. Fox <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> they [...] "would disgrace" [...] themselves in such a way. After these defections, the Foxites could no longer constitute a credible parliamentary opposition, reduced, as they were, to some fifty MPs.|$|E
2500|$|In 1825 J. F. Engelhard {{discovered}} that the ratio of Fe to protein is identical in the hemoglobins of several species. From the known atomic mass of iron he calculated the molecular mass of hemoglobin to n × 16000 (n = number of iron atoms per hemoglobin, now known to be 4), the first determination of a protein's molecular mass. This [...] "hasty conclusion" [...] drew a lot of ridicule at the time from scientists who <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> any molecule could be that big. Gilbert Smithson Adair confirmed Engelhard's results in 1925 by measuring the osmotic pressure of hemoglobin solutions.|$|E
