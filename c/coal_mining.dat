5|$|Up {{until the}} 18th century, the {{inhabitants}} of Chadderton raised domestic farm animals, supplementing their incomes by the spinning and weaving wool in the domestic system. Primitive <b>coal</b> <b>mining</b> was established by the 17th century, and the factory system adopted in the late-18th century. During the Victorian era, Chadderton's economy was heavily dependent on manufacturing industries, especially the spinning of cotton, but also the weaving of silk and production of hats. By the 20th century the landscape was covered with over 50 cotton mills. Industries ancillary to these sectors, including <b>coal</b> <b>mining,</b> brick making, mechanical engineering, and bleaching and dyeing were present. Chadderton developed an extensive <b>coal</b> <b>mining</b> sector auxiliary to Chadderton's cotton industry and workforce. Coal was transported out of the township via the Rochdale Canal. The amount of coal was overestimated however, and production began to decline even before that of the local spinning industry; Chadderton's last coal mine closed in 1920.|$|E

5|$|MD36 {{passes through}} the Georges Creek Valley, which {{has a long history}} of <b>coal</b> <b>mining.</b> In {{recognition}} of this, the MDSHA has designated MD36 as part of the Coal Heritage Scenic Byway. <b>Coal</b> <b>mining</b> was a major industry in western Maryland in the 19th century, with railroads being the major route connecting the coal mines to markets outside the Georges Creek Valley. Deep mining, which was the primary mining method used in western Maryland, declined in use after World WarII, replaced primarily by surface mining. Although Maryland coal production is now only a small fraction of total U.S. coal production, coal from the Georges Creek Valley is used to power the AES Warrior Run power plant in Cumberland.|$|E
5|$|On {{the back}} of the Industrial Revolution, Oldham {{developed}} an extensive <b>coal</b> <b>mining</b> sector, correlated to supporting the local cotton industry and the town's inhabitants, though there is evidence of small scale <b>coal</b> <b>mining</b> in the area as early as the 16th century. The Oldham Coalfield stretched from Royton in the north to Bardsley in the south and in addition to Oldham, included the towns of Middleton and Chadderton to the west. The Oldham Coalfield was the site of over 150 collieries during its recorded history. Although some contemporary sources suggest there was <b>coal</b> <b>mining</b> in Oldham at a commercial scale by 1738, older sources attribute the commercial expansion of <b>coal</b> <b>mining</b> with the arrival in the town of two Welsh labourers, John Evans and William Jones, around 1770. Foreseeing the growth in demand for coal as a source of motive and steam power, they acquired colliery rights for Oldham, which by 1771 had 14 colliers. The mines were largely to the southwest of the town around Hollinwood and Werneth and provided enough coal to accelerate Oldham's rapid development at the centre of the cotton boom. At its height in the mid-19th century, when it was dominated by the Lees and Jones families, Oldham coal was mainly sourced from many small collieries whose lives varied from a few years to many decades, although two of the four largest collieries survived to nationalisation. In 1851, collieries employed more than 2,000 men in Oldham, although the amount of coal in the town was somewhat overestimated however, and production began to decline even before that of the local spinning industry. Today, the only visible remnants of the mines are disused shafts and boreholes.|$|E

30|$|In this paper, {{we studied}} the {{effectiveness}} of <b>coal</b> <b>mine</b> safety supervision system reform on state-owned key <b>coal</b> <b>mines,</b> local state-owned <b>coal</b> <b>mines</b> and township <b>coal</b> <b>mines</b> by using time series analysis method. The regression {{results show that the}} structural reform has had a big influence on the safety situation of <b>coal</b> <b>mines</b> and its work is effective on the whole. In the short term, the structural reform is not conductive to the improvement of <b>coal</b> <b>mine</b> safety situation, and negative effects are different in the three types of <b>coal</b> <b>mines.</b> Specifically, the negative effects in state-owned key <b>coal</b> <b>mines</b> are non-significant compared with township <b>coal</b> <b>mines.</b> In the long term, the structural reform is conductive significantly to the improvement of <b>coal</b> <b>mine</b> safety situation, and positive effects are also different in the three types of <b>coal</b> <b>mines.</b> Specifically, the effects of the new supervision system in township <b>coal</b> <b>mines</b> are more significant than the effects in state-owned key <b>coal</b> <b>mines.</b> Therefore, the Administration of <b>Coal</b> <b>Mine</b> Safety should take measures to perfect its supervision system {{on the basis of the}} above conclusions and analysis. (1) Ensure the independence and authority of the Administration of <b>Coal</b> <b>Mine</b> Safety, and establish effective supervision system to avoid its abuse of power at the same time; (2) avoid frequent changes of supervision organization and coordinate its relationship with the legislation departments, administration departments and justice department; (3) stabilize the policy on the township <b>coal</b> <b>mines</b> and encourage long-term legal business, and also periodically inspect the township <b>coal</b> <b>mines</b> which have passed the security acceptance; (4) weaken the beneficial relations between local government and township <b>coal</b> <b>mines.</b> The tax from the township <b>coal</b> <b>mines</b> can be mostly submitted to central government and then return to local government according to their different demands, and the rest can be used as safety fund for granting appropriate subsidies to the legitimate township <b>coal</b> <b>mines.</b>|$|R

The safety cultural grade of T <b>coal</b> <b>mine</b> enterprise and S <b>coal</b> <b>mine</b> enterprise were both “qualified”, which indicate that the production could be continued.
