40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In the low {{pressure}} environment of commercial aircraft, hypoxaemia may be common and accentuated in patients with lung or heart disease. Regulations specify a <b>cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> not lower than 750 hPa {{but it is not}} known whether this standard is met. This knowledge is important in determining the hazards of commercial flight for patients and the validity of current flight simulation tests. METHODS: Using a wrist-watch recording altimeter, <b>cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> was recorded at 60 s intervals on 45 flights in Boeing 747 - 400 aircraft with three airlines. A log was kept of aircraft altitude using the in-flight display. Change in <b>cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> during flight, relationship between aircraft altitude and <b>cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> and proportion of flight time with <b>cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> approaching the minimum specified by regulation were determined. RESULTS: Flight duration averaged 10 h. Average <b>cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> during flight was 846 hPa. There was a linear fall in <b>cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> as the aircraft cruising altitude increased. At 10, 300 m (34, 000 ft) <b>cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> was 843 hPa and changed 8 hPa for every 300 m (1000 ft) change in aircraft altitude (r(2) = 0. 993; P < 0. 001). Lowest <b>cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> was 792 hPa at 12 200 m (40, 000 ft) but during only 2 % of flight time was <b>cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> less than 800 hPa. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> is determined only by the engineering of the aircraft and its altitude and {{in the present study was}} always higher than required by regulation. Current fitness-to-fly evaluations simulate cabin conditions that passengers will not experience on these aircraft. There may be increased risks to patients should new or older aircraft operate nearer to the present minimum standard. 5 page(s...|$|R
50|$|There is a suit <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge</b> on {{the left}} wrist. A mirror on an elastic wrist band is worn on the right - this helps the wearer see things that would {{otherwise}} be outside his or her field of view. During re-entry, an altimeter on a wrist strap may also be worn this gives an immediate check on <b>cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> and warns when to brace for touchdown (during the last phase of landing the cabin opens to the outside air.) A wristwatch is often worn as well, with an elastic wrist band replacing the strap so it may fit over the bulky suit glove. The watches are often privately purchased and a wide variety of Swiss and Russian models have been used.|$|R
40|$|As {{a result}} of {{technology}} developed at NASA s Kennedy Space Center, pilots now have a hand-held personal safety device to warn them of potentially dangerous or deteriorating <b>cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> altitude conditions before hypoxia becomes a threat. The Personal <b>Cabin</b> <b>Pressure</b> Altitude Monitor and Warning System monitors <b>cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> to determine when supplemental oxygen should be used according to Federal Aviation Regulations. The device benefits both pressurized and nonpressurized aircraft operations - warning pressurized aircraft when the required safe <b>cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> altitude is compromised, and reminding nonpressurized aircraft when supplemental oxygen is needed...|$|R

5000|$|All {{exhaust air}} is dumped to {{atmosphere}} via an outflow valve, usually {{at the rear}} of the fuselage. This valve controls the <b>cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> and also acts as a safety relief valve, in addition to other safety relief valves. If the automatic pressure controllers fail, the pilot can manually control the <b>cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> valve, according to the backup emergency procedure checklist. The automatic controller normally maintains the proper <b>cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> altitude by constantly adjusting the outflow valve position so that the cabin altitude is as low as practical without exceeding the maximum pressure differential limit on the fuselage. The pressure differential varies between aircraft types, typical values are between [...] and [...] At 39000 ft, the <b>cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> would be automatically maintained at about 6900 ft (450 ft lower than Mexico City), which is about [...] of atmosphere pressure.|$|R
