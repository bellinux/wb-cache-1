5|$|Deep frying (also {{referred}} to as deep fat frying) is a <b>cooking</b> <b>method</b> in which food is submerged in hot fat, most commonly oil, rather than the shallow oil used in conventional frying, done in a frying pan. Normally, a deep fryer or chip pan is used for this; industrially, a pressure fryer or vacuum fryer may be used. Deep frying may also be performed using oil that is heated in a pot. Deep frying is classified as hot-fat <b>cooking</b> <b>method.</b> Typically, deep frying foods cook quickly: all sides of a food are cooked simultaneously as oil has {{a high rate of}} heat conduction.|$|E
5|$|Stir frying: Stir frying is a Chinese cooking {{technique}} used for preparing {{food in a}} wok. It originates from the Han Dynasty, but did not fully develop until the Song Dynasty. Although there are no surviving records of Han Dynasty stir frying, archaeological evidence of woks and the tendency to slice food thinly indicate that the technique was likely used for cooking. It {{was not until the}} Ming Dynasty that stir frying was popularized as primary <b>cooking</b> <b>method</b> of Chinese cuisine. Stir frying was brought to America by early Chinese immigrants, and has been used for non-Asian cuisines.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: There is {{epidemiologic}} {{evidence that}} the consumption of fried, grilled or barbecued meat and fish that are well-done or browned {{may be associated with}} an increased cancer risk. These high-temperature <b>cooking</b> <b>methods</b> are thought to be surrogates for mutagens and carcinogens produced in meat and fish, eg heterocyclic amines or polycyclic hydrocarbons. Since data on food <b>cooking</b> <b>methods</b> are scarce, the aim {{of this study was to}} describe the variation in meat and fish <b>cooking</b> <b>methods</b> in different parts of Europe. Design: Using a standardized 24 h recall from a sub-sample of the EPIC cohort (35 644 persons, 35 - 75 y old), mean daily intake of meat and fish prepared by different <b>cooking</b> <b>methods</b> and the relative contribution of the <b>cooking</b> <b>methods</b> to the overall cooking of meat and fish was calculated. Results: Whereas frying was more often noted in northern Europe, roasting and stir frying were more often used in the south. Concerning high-temperature <b>cooking</b> <b>methods,</b> their frequency of application varies between 15 % in the EPIC cohort of North-Italy and 49 % in the cohort of The Netherlands. Average consumption of fried, grilled and barbecued meat and fish ranges from a low of 12 g/day in the centres in southern Spain to a high of 91 g/day in northern Spain. Conclusion: High variation in both the kind of meat/fish consumed as well as its <b>cooking</b> <b>methods</b> is observed within EPIC. In order to use this variation for the evaluation of the impact of <b>cooking</b> <b>methods</b> on cancer risk, a questionnaire on meat and fish <b>cooking</b> <b>methods</b> is being developed and could be applied in the whole EPIC cohort...|$|R

Because of this inefficient <b>cooking</b> <b>method,</b> much of the area's limited fuel resources are wasted. However, in 2003, an Eritrean research group designed a stove, which uses available fuel sources (including dung, locally called kubet) for cooking injera and other foods efficiently, saving the heat from the fuel.

25|$|Potatoes {{are often}} broadly {{classified}} as {{high on the}} glycemic index (GI) and so are often excluded from the diets of individuals trying to follow a low-GI diet. The GI of potatoes can vary considerably depending on type (such as red, russet, white, or King Edward), origin, preparation methods (by <b>cooking</b> <b>method,</b> whether it is eaten hot or cold, whether it is mashed or cubed or consumed whole), and with what it is consumed (addition of various high-fat or high-protein toppings). Consuming reheated or cooled potatoes that were previously cooked may afford a lower GI effect.|$|E
25|$|The above {{principles}} can be {{used for}} pairing wines with Asian cuisine. Pair for the flavor of the dish - whatever the 'main ingredient' may be - it is not the meat, seafood, or vegetables that stand out as the predominant flavor. Rather the true flavor of the dish is determined by the <b>cooking</b> <b>method</b> (for example, the toasty flavors of a stir fry), the sauce (from curries to sweet-and-sour), the use of seasonings (such as ginger and coriander leaves to mask fishy tastes), or the blending of ingredients to for new flavors (as in sukiyaki or satay). Indeed, it may result from a combination of any of these elements. Also, note {{that in the case of}} an Asian meal, several dishes are served at the same time and are shared by everyone present. The wine chosen for such a meal has to be versatile.|$|E
500|$|The most typical <b>cooking</b> <b>method</b> of the Quakers was boiling, {{a method}} brought from ancestral {{northern}} England. Boiled breakfast and dinner were standard fare, {{as well as}} [...] "pop-robbins", balls of batter made from flour and eggs boiled in milk. Boiled dumplings and puddings were so common in Quaker homes that they were referred to by outsiders as [...] "Quaker food". Travelers noted apple dumplings as an almost daily dish in the Delaware Valley and cookbooks specialized in puddings and dumplings. Food was mostly preserved through boiling, simmering or standing. A popular genre of dishes made from this favored method of food preparation was [...] "cheese" [...] (or [...] "butter"), a generic term for dishes prepared by slow boiling or pressing. They could be made from ingredients as varying as apples (i.e., apple butter), plums and walnuts. Cream cheese had its origins in Quaker cooking, but was in colonial times not true cheese made with rennet or curds, but rather cream that was warmed gently and then allowed to stand wrapped in cloth until it became semi-solid. Dried beef was widely popular in the Delaware Valley and was eaten along with puddings and dumplings to add flavor. The use of dried beef was so widespread that it was often called [...] "Quaker gravy" [...] in the 18th century. Though the Quaker influence from the northern Midlands was the most dominant, there was some influence from German immigrants during the 18th century. Scrapple, a pot pudding made from meat scraps and grain, became {{a staple of the}} regional cuisine for many generations.|$|E
