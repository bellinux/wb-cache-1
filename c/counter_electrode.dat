In particular, a series of DSC devices utilizing Co(III) /(II) polypyridine redox mediators ([Co(bpy) 3] 3 +/ 2 +, [Co(phen) 3] 3 +/ 2 +, [Co(dtb) 3] 3 +/ 2 +; bpy = 2, 2 ′-bipyridine; dtb = 4, 4 ′ditert-butyl- 2, 2 ′-bipyridine; phen = 1, 10 -phenanthroline) having distinct electrochemical characteristics were evaluated. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements reveal that [Co(bpy) 3] 3 +/ 2 + and [Co(phen) 3] 3 +/ 2 + mediators exhibit relatively fast heterogeneous electron transfer rates with porous PEDOT/ClO 4 electrodes (k = 7 × 10 − 3 cm s− 1 and 2. 1 × 10 − 3 cm s− 1, respectively) and correspondingly low charge transfer resistances (< 1 Ω) that are competitive with results obtained for Au and Pt coated electrodes.

50|$|After Professor Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology has {{introduced}} a basic configuration of VING in 2006 where he used a tip of atomic force microscope (AFM) to induce the deformation of a single vertical ZnO nanowire, the first development of VING is followed in 2007. The first VING utilizes the <b>counter</b> <b>electrode</b> with the periodic surface grating resembling the arrays of AFM tip as a moving electrode. Since the <b>counter</b> <b>electrode</b> is not in full contact with {{the tips of the}} piezoelectric nanowire, its motion in-plane or out-of-plane occurred by the external vibration induces the deformation of the piezoelectric nanostructure, leading to the generation of the electrical potential distribution inside each individual nanowire. It {{should be noted that the}} <b>counter</b> <b>electrode</b> is coated with the metal forming the schottky contact with the tip of the nanowire, where only the compressed portion of piezoelectric nanowire would allow the accumulated electrons pass through the barrier between its tip and the <b>counter</b> <b>electrode,</b> in case of n-type nanowire. The switch-on and -off characteristic of this configuration shows its capability of generating direct current generation without any requirement for the external rectifier.|$|E
50|$|The {{electrical}} contact {{plays an important}} role to pump out charges in the surface of the tip. The schottky contact must be formed between the <b>counter</b> <b>electrode</b> and the tip of the nanowire since the ohmic contact will neutralize the electrical field generated at the tip. In order to form an effective schottky contact, the electron affinity(Ea) must be smaller than the work function(φ) of the metal composing the <b>counter</b> <b>electrode.</b> For the case of ZnO nanowire with the electron affinity of 4.5 eV, Pt (φ=6.1eV) is a suitable metal to construct the schottky contact. By constructing the schottky contact, the electrons will pass to the <b>counter</b> <b>electrode</b> {{from the surface of the}} tip when the <b>counter</b> <b>electrode</b> is in contact with the regions of the negative potential, whereas no current will be generated when it is in contact with the regions of the positive potential, in the case of n-type semiconductive nanostructure (p-type semiconductive structure will exhibit the reversed phenomenon since the hole is mobile in this case). The formation of the schottky contact also contributes to the generation of direct current output signal consequently.|$|E

30|$|In summary, we {{have shown}} the {{effectiveness}} of the physical PLD method to decorate straightforwardly MWCNTs with Co–Ni NPs for the development of novel <b>counter</b> <b>electrodes</b> for DSSC applications. These novel Co–Ni/MWCNTs based CEs were integrated into DSSCs and their devices PCE performance systematically investigated {{as a function of the}} Co–Ni NPs decoration conditions. Indeed, by varying the N LP used during the PLD process, we were able to control not only the average Co–Ni nanoparticle size, but more importantly the surface coverage rate of MWCNTs by the PLD Co–Ni NPs. Our results revealed that the N LP variation induces significant changes in the surface roughness of the Co–Ni/MWCNTs counter-electrodes, which in turn are shown to influence directly the overall PV performance of the DSSCs. In fact, the N LP =  40, 000 is identified as the optimal PLD decoration condition that corresponds at the same time to the highest local surface roughness of the Co–Ni/MWCNTs CEs, and the highest PCE of 6.68 %. In a wider picture, we found that both surface roughness of the Co–Ni/MWCNTs CEs and PCE of their associated DSSCs exhibit identical N LP dependence over the N LP =  0 – 60, 000 investigated range. This enabled us to establish, for the first time, a direct linear correlation between the PCE of our DSSCs and the surface roughness of their Co–Ni/MWCNTs <b>counter</b> <b>electrodes.</b> Our results point out the importance of increasing the effective surface area of Co–Ni/MWCNTs <b>counter</b> <b>electrodes</b> for the enhancement of the overall PCE of the DSSCs. The relatively low Φ value of the Co–Ni/MWCNTs (3.9 versus 4.3  eV for the Pt reference CE) is an additional advantage that enhances their catalytic activity through a favored electrons transfer to the electrolyte solution. It is concluded that the PLD decoration of the MWCNTs/FTO <b>counter</b> <b>electrodes</b> by Co–Ni NPs offers an interesting alternative to develop high-performance <b>counter</b> <b>electrodes</b> where the Co–Ni NPs advantageously replace the expensive Pt catalyst commonly used in DSSCs.|$|R
