40|$|China has {{experienced}} a rapid land-use /cover change (LUCC) during the 20 th Century, and this process {{is expected to continue}} in the future. How LUCC has affected water resources across China, however, remains uncertain due to the complexity of LUCC-water interactions. In this study, we used an integrated Dynamic Land Ecosystem Model (DLEM) in conjunction with spatial data of LUCC to estimate the LUCC effects on the magnitude, spatial and temporal variations of evapotranspiration (ET), runoff, and water yield across China. Through comparisons of DLEM results with other model simulations, field observations, and river discharge data, we found that DLEM model can adequately catch the spatial and seasonal patterns of hydrological processes. Our simulation results demonstrate that LUCC led to substantial changes in ET, runoff, and water yield in most of the China's river basins during the 20 th Century. The temporal and spatial patterns varied significantly across China. The largest change occurred during the second half century when almost all of the river basins had a decreasing trend in ET and an increasing trend in water yield and runoff, in contrast to the inclinations of ET and declinations of water yield in major river basins, such as Pearl river basin, Yangtze river basin, and Yellow river basin during the first half century. The increased water yield and runoff indicated alleviated water deficiency in China in the late 20 th Century, but the increased peak flow might make the runoff difficult to be held by reservoirs. The continuously increasing ET and decreasing water yield in Continental river basin, Southwest river basin, and Songhua and Liaohe river basin implied regional water deficiency. Our study in China indicates that deforestation averagely increased ET by 138 mm/year but decreased water yield by the same amount and that reforestation averagely decreased ET by 422 mm/year since most of deforested land was converted to paddy land or irrigated cropland. In China, cropland-related land transformation is the dominant anthropogenic force affecting water resources during the 20 th Century. On national average, cropland expansion was estimated to increase ET by 182 mm/year while cropland abandonment decreased ET by 379 mm/year. Our simulation results indicate that urban sprawl generally decreased ET and increased water yield. <b>Cropland</b> <b>managements</b> (fertilization and irrigation) significantly increased ET by 98 mm/year.

The close relationship between total soil C and N concentrations, under all land uses, suggested that N was the most limiting nutrient in these wetlands.

Croplands, except rice cultivation, had lower soil N:P ratios than the original P. australis wetland, consistent with the tendency of favoring species adapted to high rates of growth (low N:P ratio). The release of soil C was less and the soil C:N and C:P ratios higher in the natural P. australis riparian wetland than in the croplands, whereas C storage was more similar. The levels of soil C storage were generally opposite to those of C release, indicating that C release by respiration was the most important factor controlling C storage. <b>Cropland</b> soil <b>management</b> promotes faster nutrient and C cycles and changes in soil nutrient stoichiometry.

Afforestation of farmed organic soils (peatlands) will have a substantial benefit in reducing CO 2 and N 2 O emissions in the longer term, but is not eligible under Article 3. 4 (as it would fall in under Article 3. 3, Afforestation). Restoration of farmed peatland to its original state and natural conversion will also reduce emissions of CO 2 and N 2 O in the longer term (time scale of decades), but CH 4 emissions will increase.

40|$|This project {{aimed to}} {{identify}} {{the extent to which}} emissions due to changes in Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) stocks arising from Cropland and Grassland/Grazing Land management can be incorporated into the UK’s Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) inventory. Key management activities were identified which might affect SOC stocks. A literature review carried out as part of the project concluded that tillage reduction cannot be considered a reliable management option to increase the SOC content of UK soils. However increasing crop residue returns and increasing inputs of manure and fertiliser could increase SOC stock although the SOC stock increases resulting from manure and fertiliser inputs could be outweighed by increases nitrous oxide emissions and the risk of nitrate run-off. The review found that increasing crop yields through increased fertilisation and improved crop rotation could increase the annual input of crop residues and root exudate to soils and hence increase SOC on low fertility soils. Manure additions resulted in greater C sequestration than the addition of equivalent amounts of N as mineral fertiliser and the effect lasted longer. However, increasing inputs of nitrogen from fertiliser or manure risk increasing N 2 O emissions which could negate any increases in SOC stock. IPCC default stock change factors were judged to be inappropriate to the UK, based on expert opinion and the literature review findings. Therefore the project used the Daily DayCent and Landscape DNDC models to attempt to estimate stock change factors for <b>Cropland</b> <b>management</b> activities under UK conditions. Although based on a very limited dataset this suggested that the effect of <b>Cropland</b> <b>management</b> activities under UK conditions might be less than implied by the IPCC stock change factors. Tillage reduction was found to have little effect on SOC stocks. Increasing manure and crop residue inputs increased SOC stocks, with manure inputs being particularly effective. A framework for reporting SOC stock changes resulting from <b>Cropland</b> <b>management</b> was developed, and used to assess mitigation options. Overall the impact of <b>Cropland</b> <b>Management</b> on SOC is likely to be very small compared to other activities in the LULUCF inventory such as land use change. The most effective mitigation option was using Cropland from annual tillage crops to perennial crops, fallow and set aside. However given the need for food production there is limited scope for such change. Increasing manure, fertiliser and crop residue inputs gave smaller increases in SOC stocks, but practical considerations limit the scope of these actions. Lack of field data on the effect of Grassland improvement on SOC stocks was identified as a knowledge gap. The literature review suggested that intensification could increase SOC stocks under pasture on mineral soils. However, expert opinion suggested that this might not be the case for rough grazing on organo-mineral soils, where intensification might lead to SOC loss. This lack of data meant that {{it was not possible to}} calibrate or validate models to estimate UK specific stock change factors for Grassland. As the IPCC stock change factors were judged to be inappropriate to UK conditions assessment of the mitigation potential of Grassland management using these factors was not carried out to avoid presenting potentially misleading results. Suggested strategies for filling these knowledge gaps are outlined in the report. Attempts to assess grass/crop rotation patterns across the UK using data from the Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS) used to handle Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) payments were hampered by difficulties in obtaining access to the data. However land use change matrices were generated for England and Wales, and used to map areas of change. Subject to data availability, this approach could be used in future inventories to give a better representation the effect of rotation patterns on SOC stocks. ...|$|E

40|$|Gully erosion is {{an extreme}} process of land {{degradation}} operating in {{different regions of the}} world. A common way to quantify the susceptibility of land to gully incision is the use of topographical thresholds for different land use types. However, the impact of various management practices in cropland on these thresholds has not been studied to date, although land management may significantly affect runoff production, erosion processes and rates. Here, the impact of different land management practices on gully head development in cropland is studied based on a standardized procedure for topographical threshold analysis: s N kA−b, where s represents the slope gradient of the soil surface, A the drainage area at the gully head, b an exponent and k a coefficient reflecting the resistance of the land to gully head development. A case study area was chosen around Wanzaye, North Ethiopia, where three different <b>cropland</b> <b>management</b> practices were studied in 75 catchments: (i) the catchment-wide use of stone bunds on the contour, (ii) the use of slightly sloping drainage ditches (feses), and (iii) the combined use of stone bunds and feses. The lowest k-values (0. 078 – 0. 090) are found for catchments treated with feses, the highest k-values (0. 198 – 0. 205) are observed for stone bund catchments, and medium k-values (0. 092 – 0. 099) are found for mixed catchments. This finding implies that catchments with the exclusive use of drainage ditches are the most vulnerable to gully head development compared with mixed catchments and stone bund catchments. However, on-site sheet and rill erosion rates are reduced by feses as they lower the gradient of the overland flow lines. Three trends in <b>cropland</b> <b>management</b> around Wanzaye and the wider region are observed: (i) feses are exclusively made on rather steep slopes where small drainage areas lead to the rapid development of gully heads; (ii) stone bunds are constructed on both steeper and gentle sloping cropland; and (iii) larger and gently sloping catchments seem to be most suitable for the combined use of drainage ditches and stone bunds. status: publishe...|$|E

Temperature resolved Pyrolysis Field Ionization Mass Spectroscopy analysis showed that the composition of both relict heathland and cultivated soils was surprisingly similar, in spite of over 60 years of intense <b>cropland</b> <b>management.</b> The mass spectra of SOM in both heathland-cropland soil pairs investigated was dominated by signals from lipids, alkylaromatics and sterols. The accumulation of this SOM rich in aliphatics was logically linked to the high input of lipids, long-chain aliphatics and sterols from heathland vegetation and the low soil pH and microbial activity. Based on the relatively high OC surface loadings of HF-extractable OM (13 - 44 mg C m(- 2) Fe and 1. 2 - 2. 3 mg C m(- 2) clay), direct organo-mineral bonds between OM and Fe-oxides or clay minerals seem to be only partly involved as a stabilization mechanism in these soils. The distinct bimodal shape of the thermograms indicates that OM-crosslinking could furthermore contribute substantially to SOM stabilization in these soils. This study therefore corroborates the previously proposed view that lipids may be bound in networks of alkylaromatics, the structural building blocks of OM macromolecules.

FMNR adapts centuries-old methods of woodland management, called coppicing and pollarding, to produce continuous tree-growth for fuel, building materials, food and fodder without the need for frequent and costly replanting. On farmland, selected trees are trimmed and pruned to maximise growth while promoting optimal growing conditions for annual crops (such as access to water and sunlight). When FMNR trees are integrated into crops and grazing pastures there is an increase in crop yields, soil fertility and organic matter, soil moisture and leaf fodder. There is also a decrease in wind and heat damage, and soil erosion.|$|R
40|$|Agroecosystem {{models are}} {{strongly}} dependent on information on land management patterns for regional applications. Land management practices {{play a major}} role in determining global yield variability, and add an anthropogenic signal to the observed seasonality of atmospheric CO 2 concentrations. However, there is still little knowledge on spatial and temporal variability of important farmland activities such as crop sowing dates, and thus these remain rather crudely approximated within carbon cycle studies. In this study, we present a framework allowing for spatio-temporally resolved simulation of cropland carbon fluxes under observational constraints on land management and canopy greenness. We apply data assimilation methodology in order to explicitly account for information on sowing dates and model leaf area index. MODIS 250 m vegetation index data were assimilated both in batch-calibration for sowing date estimation and sequentially for improved model state estimation, using the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), into a crop carbon mass balance model (SPAc). In doing so, we are able to quantify the multiannual (2000 – 2006) regional carbon flux and biometry seasonality of maize–soybean crop rotations surrounding the Bondville Ameriflux eddy covariance site, averaged over 104 pixel locations within the wider area. (1) Validation at the Bondville site shows that growing season C cycling is simulated accurately with MODIS-derived sowing dates, and we expect that this framework allows for accurate simulations of C cycling at locations for which ground-truth data are not available. Thus, this framework enables modellers to simulate current (i. e. last 10 yr) carbon cycling of major agricultural regions. Averaged over the 104 field patches analysed, relative spatial variability for biometry and net ecosystem exchange ranges from ∼ 7 % to ∼ 18 %. The annual sign of net biome productivity is not significantly different from carbon neutrality. (2) Moreover, observing carbon cycling at one single field with its individual sowing pattern is not sufficient to constrain large-scale agroecosystem carbon flux seasonality. Study area average growing season length is 20 days longer than observed at Bondville, primarily because of an earlier estimated start of season.

40|$|As <b>cropland</b> <b>management</b> {{and land}} use shifted towards more {{intensive}} practices, global land degradation increased drastically. Understanding relationships between ecological and socioeconomic drivers of soil and landscape degradation within these landscapes in economically dynamic contexts such as the Mediterranean region, requires multi-target and multi-scalar approaches covering long-term periods. This study provides an original approach for identifying desertification risk drivers and sustainable land management strategies within Italian agro-forest districts. An Environmental Sensitivity Area (ESA) approach, based on four thematic indicators (climate, soil, vegetation and land-use) and a composite index of desertification risk (ESAI), {{was used to evaluate}} changes in soil vulnerability and landscape degradation between the years 1960 and 2010. A multivariate model was developed to identify the most relevant drivers causing changes in land susceptibility at the district scale. Larger districts, and those with a higher proportion of their total surface area classified as agro-forest, had a significantly lower increase in land susceptibility to degradation during the 50 years when compared with the remaining districts. We conclude that preserving economic viability and ecological connectivity of traditional, extensive agricultural systems is a key measure to mitigate the desertification risk in the Mediterranean region...|$|E
40|$|C {{sequestration}} via {{agricultural soils}} can be accounted for, under Article 3. 4 of the Kyoto Protocol, provided that specific measures are implemented. Sound <b>cropland</b> <b>management</b> {{can play a}} positive role in mitigating GHGs emissions from other sources, and carbon dioxide in particular, through a decrease of soil organic carbon (SOC) losses, an increase of organic material inputs or combining these two options. Literature data estimate about 1, 500 Gg SOC to 1 m depth (Eswaran et al., 2000), in comparison with 4, 000 Gg C of fossil fuels, indicating SOC as the largest sink of C after fossil fuels. Vegetation (600 Gg) and atmosphere (760 Gg) store considerably less C than soils. Carbon sequestration can occur through a reduction in soil disturbance, since more carbon is lost as CO 2 from tilled soils in comparison with reduced or sod-seeding systems: no tillage systems may absorb on average 0. 7 - 1. 4 t CO 2 ha - 1 yr - 1 (INRA 2002, ECCP 2003).

40|$|Nations are now {{obligated to}} assess their {{greenhouse}} gas emissions under the protocols of Article 4 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The IPCC has developed `spreadsheet-format 2 ̆ 7 methodologies for countries to estimate national greenhouse gas emissions by economic sector. Each activity has a magnitude and emission rate and their product is summed over all included activities to generate a national total (IPCC, 1997). For N 2 O emissions from cropland soils, field {{studies have shown that}} there are important factors that influence N 2 O emissions at specific field sites that are not considered in the IPCC methodology. We used DNDC, a process-oriented agroecosystem model, to develop an unofficial national inventory of direct N 2 O emissions from cropland in China. We assembled county-scale data on soil properties, daily weather, crop areas, N-fertilizer use, livestock populations (for manure inputs to <b>cropland),</b> and agricultural <b>management</b> for the 2500 counties in mainland China. Total 1990 cropland area was 0. 95 million km 2. Total N-fertilizer use in China in 1990 was 16. 6 Tg N. The average fertilization rate was 175 kg N ha− 1 cropland. One-year simulations with DNDC were run for each crop type in each county to generate estimates of direct N 2 O emissions from soils. National totals were the sum of results for all crop simulations across all counties. Baseline simulations estimated that total N 2 O emission from arable land in China in 1990 was 0. 31 Tg N 2 O-N yr− 1. We also ran simulations with zero N-fertilizer input; the difference between the zero-fertilizer and the baseline run is an estimate of fertilizer-induced N 2 O emissions.

40|$|Interannual climatic and hydrologic {{variability}} {{has been}} substantial {{during the past}} decades in many regions. While climate variability and its impacts on precipitation and soil moisture have been rather intensively studied, less is known on its impacts on freshwater availability and further implications for global food production. In this paper we quantify effects of hydroclimatic variability on global "green" and "blue" water availability and demand in agriculture. Analysis is based on climate forcing data for the past 30 yr with demography, diet composition and land use fixed to constant reference conditions. We thus assess how observed interannual hydroclimatic variability impacts {{on the ability of}} food production units (FPUs) to produce a given diet for their inhabitants, here focused on a benchmark for hunger alleviation (3000 kilocalories per capita per day, with 80 % vegetal food and 20 % animal products). We applied the LPJmL vegetation and hydrology model to calculate spatially explicitly the variation in green-blue water availability and the water requirements to produce that very diet. An FPU was considered water scarce if its water availability was not sufficient to produce the diet (neglecting trade from elsewhere, i. e. assuming food self-sufficiency). We found that altogether 24 % of the global population lives in areas under chronic scarcity (i. e. water is scarce every year) while an additional 19 % live under occasional water scarcity (i. e. water is scarce in some years). Of these 2. 6 billion people under some degree of scarcity, 55 % would have to rely on international trade to reach the reference diet while for 24 % domestic trade would be enough (assuming present <b>cropland</b> extent and <b>management).</b> For the remaining 21 % of population under scarcity, local food storage and/or intermittent trade would be enough secure the reference diet over the occasional dry years...|$|R
40|$|Purpose The {{sensitivity}} of soil organic carbon to global change drivers, {{according to the}} depth profile, is receiving increasing attention because of its importance in the global carbon cycle and its potential feedback to climate change. A better knowledge of the vertical distribution of SOC and its controlling factors—the aim of this study—will help scientists predict the consequences of global change. Materials and methods The study area was the Murcia Province (S. E. Spain) under semiarid Mediterranean conditions. The database used consists of 312 soil profiles collected in a systematic grid, each 12 km 2 covering a total area of 11, 004 km 2. Statistical analysis to study the relationships between SOC concentration and control factors in different soil use scenarios was conducted at fixed depths of 0 – 20, 20 – 40, 40 – 60, and 60 – 100 cm. Results and discussion SOC concentration in the top 40 cm ranged between 6. 1 and 31. 5 g[*]kg− 1, with significant differences according to land use, soil type and lithology, while below this depth, no differences were observed (SOC concentration 2. 1 – 6. 8 g[*]kg− 1). The ANOVA showed that land use {{was the most important}} factor controlling SOC concentration in the 0 – 40 cm depth. Significant differences were found in the relative importance of environmental and textural factors according to land use and soil depth. In forestland, mean annual precipitation and texture were the main predictors of SOC, while in cropland and shrubland, the main predictors were mean annual temperature and lithology. Total SOC stored in the top 1 m in the region was about 79 Tg with a low mean density of 7. 18 kg[*]Cm− 3. The vertical distribution of SOC was shallower in forestland and deeper in cropland. A reduction in rainfall would lead to SOC decrease in forestland and shrubland, and an increase of mean annual temperature would adversely affect SOC in croplands and shrubland. With increasing depth, the relative importance of climatic factors decreases and texture becomes more important in controlling SOC in all land uses. Conclusions Due to climate change, impacts will be much greater in surface SOC, the strategies for C sequestration should be focused on subsoil sequestration, which was hindered in forestland due to bedrock limitations to soil depth. In these conditions, sequestration in <b>cropland</b> through appropriate <b>management</b> practices is recommended...|$|R
40|$|The {{occlusion}} {{of carbon}} (C) by phytoliths, the recalcitrant silicified structures deposited within plant tissues, {{is an important}} persistent C sink mechanism for croplands and other grass-dominated ecosystems. By constructing a silica content-phytolith content transfer function and calculating the magnitude of phytolith C sink in global croplands with relevant crop production data, this study investigated the present and potential of phytolith C sinks in global croplands and its contribution to the cropland C balance to understand the cropland C cycle and enhance long-term C sequestration in croplands. Our {{results indicate that the}} phytolith sink annually sequesters 26. 35 ± 10. 22 Tg of carbon dioxide (CO 2) and may contribute 40 ± 18 % of the global net cropland soil C sink for 1961 - 2100. Rice (25 %), wheat (19 %) and maize (23 %) are the dominant contributing crop species to this phytolith C sink. Continentally, the main contributors are Asia (49 %), North America (17 %) and Europe (16 %). The sink has tripled since 1961, mainly due to fertilizer application and irrigation. Cropland phytolith C sinks may be further enhanced by adopting <b>cropland</b> <b>management</b> practices such as optimization of cropping system and fertilization...|$|E
40|$|Strategies for {{mitigating}} {{the increasing}} concentration {{of carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) in the atmosphere include sequestering carbon (C) in soils and vegetation of terrestrial ecosystems. Carbon and nitrogen (N) move through terrestrial ecosystems in coupled biogeochemical cycles, and increasing C stocks in soils and vegetation {{will have an impact}} on the N cycle. We conducted simulations with a biogeochemical model to evaluate the impact of different <b>cropland</b> <b>management</b> strategies on the coupled cycles of C and N, with special emphasis on C-sequestration and emission of the greenhouse gases methane (CH 4) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O). Reduced tillage, enhanced crop residue incorporation, and farmyard manure application each increased soil C-sequestration, increased N 2 O emissions, and had little effect on CH 4 uptake. Over 20 years, increases in N 2 O emissions, which were converted into CO 2 -equivalent emissions with 100 -year global warming potential multipliers, offset 75 – 310 % of the carbon sequestered, depending on the scenario. Quantification of these types of biogeochemical interactions must be incorporated into assessment frameworks and trading mechanisms to accurately evaluate the value of agricultural systems in strategies for climate protection...|$|E
40|$|Poor {{cropland}} {{fertility and}} a rapidly rising demand for food force Sahelian farmers to cultivate more land and shorten fallow periods. This mostly {{leads to a}} gradual decline in crop yields per hectare, which can be counterbalanced by the systematic use of livestock manure on cropland. To assess the potential and limits of manuring practices, annual nutrient budgets were established for different land-use types, based on forage and crop yields and livestock and <b>cropland</b> <b>management</b> in five village territories in western Niger, which were selected along the Sahelian climatic gradient. Stocking rates per km 2 of pasturing area range from 8 â€“ 22 tropical livestock units (TLU, animal of 250 kg live weight). Faecal excretion during grazing directly returns 18 â€“ 25 % of the consumed forage dry matter, 21 â€“ 29 % of the ingested nitrogen and 44 â€“ 56 % of ingested phosphorus to the grazed land. Corralling animals on fields at night leads to a spatial concentration of nutrients, benefiting at most 9 % of the arable village land. Where livestock consume only 15 â€“ 20 % of {{the total amount of}} forage produced, there is some scope for increasing village livestock numbers in order to increase the area manured, but eventually manuring must be complemented by additional measures such as the application of inorganic fertilizers to sustain overall productivity of the farming systems...|$|E
40|$|Soil {{monitoring}} programmes face significant challenges {{as there is}} an important trade-off between detecting significant changes in soil properties on the one hand (which can be achieved by minimizing variability by higher sampling density or stratification approaches), and identifying the driving forces responsible for these changes on the other hand (which requires enough variability). This study aims to reconcile these two objectives by identifying the driving forces of soil organic carbon (SOC) evolution over a long period, based on an extensive but stratified soil monitoring programme. Data at both the finest level (questionnaires to the farmers) and the large scale (agricultural census, climate and soil databases for southern Belgium) were used in a cluster analysis, multiple linear regressions and mixed odels in order to discriminate between the driving forces involved. Results indicated that the negative 'baseline effect' (i. e. the inversely proportional effect of the initial SOC content on the SOC evolution) was responsible for {{an important part of the}} SOC variability. Consequently, the systems are not at steady state when starting the observations, although this assumption is used by most SOC dynamic models. Moreover, the baseline effect resulted in a trend of the soils to converge towards a regional SOC stock which significantly differed according to land use (36. 4 t C ha- 1 for the plough depth of cropland and 92. 2 t C ha- 1 for the 0 - 30 cm layer of grassland). Despite this strong effect, the main driving forces of the SOC decrease of cropland (- 0. 2 t C ha- 1 yr- 1) and SOC increase of grassland (+ 0. 2 t C ha- 1 yr- 1) over a period of 50 years were discriminated. The agricultural <b>management</b> (<b>cropland)</b> and the clay content (grassland), together with the change in precipitation (to a lesser degree for cropland) were highlighted as the predominant factors involved in SOC evolution, when land use change is excluded. The use of questionnaires allowed to better understanding the impact of an intensive agricultural management on the SOC content, as the lowest SOC stocks were associated to the most intensively managed fields. The mixed models partly succeeded in predicting SOC evolution as they presented still large uncertainties after validation (mean error from 3 % to 25 %, root mean square error of prediction from 21 % to 242 %). While SOC monitoring schemes are increasingly being implemented, our results will likely apply to those using a similar design. It was shown that this strategy succeeded to reconcile both the SOC change detection and the distinction of the driving forces involved at the regional scale...|$|R
40|$|The UK is {{required}} to report projections for the Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) sector for carbon budgets under the UK Climate Change Act, for the European Union Monitoring Mechanism, and for the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. LULUCF activities can result in net emissions or removals of greenhouse gases, and changes in carbon stocks in the pools associated with LULUCF. This report provides projections at the UK and Devolved Administration (DA) level, with separate estimates for Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland, which are summed to give the UK totals. • LULUCF is divided into six land use types: 5 A Forest Land, 5 B Cropland, 5 C Grassland, 5 D Wetlands, 5 E Settlements, 5 F Other Land. The code refers to the IPCC inventory category of LULUCF. There is a separate inventory sector dedicated to other emissions, mainly methane and nitrous oxide, from agricultural activities. Carbon stock changes from Harvested Wood Products are reported in an additional category, 5 G Other. • Projections are made for net emissions and removals of greenhouse gases to 2050, arising from LULUCF activities reported in the latest (1990 ‐ 2012) greenhouse gas inventory, for the DAs and the UK, which excludes Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies. • The LULUCF inventory now uses the CARBINE model for estimating forest carbon stocks, and models all UK forest instead of just the post‐ 1920 forest. As {{a consequence of the}} change in model, and corresponding changes in activity data, the projected sink for forestry is estimated to be much larger than in previous inventories. This has resulted in an increase in the total net sink for UK LULUCF being reported for all scenarios within the projections. • Four scenarios (Business‐As‐Usual (BAU), High emissions, Mid emissions and Low emissions) were constructed initially. The non‐BAU scenarios were later modified to include cropland-grassland rotations (churn), to take into account land use changes in land that has not reached equilibrium from previous changes in land use. The scenarios were developed by a policy maker stakeholder group from trajectories in the 2050 DECC calculator report and take account of land use policies and aspirations (DECC, 2010). The BAU scenario assumes no new policy intervention. The main results are: 1. At a UK level, the LULUCF sector has been a net sink since 1998 and is predicted to remain so under all scenarios until at least 2050, although at a declining level from around 2030 ‐ 2037 onwards (depending on the scenario) mainly due to the number of trees being thinned or reaching maturity and harvested. 2. At a DA level, England will remain a net sink under all scenarios {{with the exception of the}} high emissions scenario with churn, which gives a net source from 2013 to 2016 and from 2045 onwards. 3. Scotland is a net sink under all scenarios 4. Wales is a small net sink under the Low scenarios, becomes a net source from 2043 onwards under the Mid scenario, and an increasing source from 2016 onwards under the High emissions scenario 5. Northern Ireland is either a small net sink or small net source depending on whether the churn factor is used. The LULUCF sector in the UK and in each of the DAs is dominated by CO 2 emissions and removals, although N 2 O emissions also make a significant contribution. 6. The Forest Land, Cropland and Grassland land use categories determine the trend in the UK and each DA. The contribution from cropland and grassland to the overall trend is from changes in land use rather than from land management activities as only a few <b>cropland</b> and grassland <b>management</b> activities are currently included in the inventory. 7. The churn scenarios increase overall estimated net emissions for all scenarios for the UK and each DA, as net emissions from land use change to Cropland are maintained, rather than declining over time, as in the original scenarios. ...|$|R
40|$|Gully {{cut-and-fill}} dynamics {{are often}} {{thought to be}} driven by climate and/or deforestation related to population pressure. However, in this case-study of nine representative catchments in the Northern Ethiopian Highlands, we find that neither climate changes nor deforestation can explain gully morphology changes over the twentieth century. Firstly, by using a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate historical catchment-wide curve numbers, we show that the landscape was already heavily degraded in the nineteenth and early twentieth century – a period with low population density. The mean catchment-wide curve number (> 80) one century ago was, under the regional climatic conditions, already resulting in considerable simulated historical runoff responses. Secondly, twentieth century land-cover and runoff coefficient changes were confronted with twentieth century changing gully morphologies. As the results show, large-scale land-cover changes and deforestation cannot explain the observed processes. The study therefore invokes interactions between authigenic factors, small-scale plot boundary changes, <b>cropland</b> <b>management</b> and sociopolitical forces to explain the gully cut processes. Finally, semi-structured interviews and sedistratigraphic analysis of three filled gullies confirm the dominant impact of (crop) land management (tillage, check dams in gullies and channel diversions) on gully cut-and-fill processes. Since agricultural land management – including land tenure and land distribution – has been commonly neglected in earlier related research, we argue therefore that it can be a very strong driver of twentieth century gully morphodynamics...|$|E
