5|$|Service design {{management}} differs {{in several ways}} from product {{design management}}. For example, the application of international trading strategies of services is difficult because the evolution of service 'from a craftsmanship attitude to industrialization of services' requires {{the development of new}} tools, approaches, and policies. Whereas goods can be manufactured centrally and delivered around the globe, services have to be performed at the place of consumption, which makes it difficult to achieve global quality consistency and effective <b>cost</b> <b>control.</b>|$|E

For the case with direct environmental <b>control</b> <b>costs</b> and environmental <b>control</b> <b>costs</b> borne by inputs, the loss ofprotection due to environmental <b>control</b> <b>costs</b> is 19. 67 % of the protection afforded by the U.

25|$|Differences ensued. One of {{the first}} was that Utzon {{believed}} the clients should receive information on {{all aspects of the}} design and construction through his practice, while the clients wanted a system (notably drawn in sketch form by Davis Hughes) where architect, contractors, and engineers each reported to the client directly and separately. This had great implications for procurement methods and <b>cost</b> <b>control,</b> with Utzon wishing to negotiate contracts with chosen suppliers (such as Ralph Symonds for the plywood interiors) and the New South Wales government insisting contracts be put out to tender.|$|E

The slotted liner is machined with multiple longitudinal slots, for example 2mm x 50mm, spread across the length and circumference of each joint.

With this, and with the lack of <b>cost</b> <b>controls,</b> the scheme effectively paid people to heat properties, so long as they used renewable energy in the process. The lack of <b>cost</b> <b>controls</b> enabled applicants to use as much energy as they wished, thus applicants made a monetary profit for using more energy.|$|R
25|$|To ensure {{every single}} {{operation}} showed a clear profit {{on a full}} costing basis, i.e. inclusive of all overhead costs, the company required each operation to be budgeted in detail before deciding whether to accept it. The managing director's authorisation was required to dispense with this rule in exceptional cases where the risk of accepting a contract that was only marginally profitable, i.e. excluding overheads, was outweighed by {{the risk of having}} an aircraft sit idly on the ground. An immediate financial analysis that compared actual costs and revenues with their budgets followed the completion of each flight, thereby instantly gauging that flight's profitability and validating the effectiveness of the firm's pricing policy. A policy of requiring aircraft commanders to pay for all operating expenses other than fuel in cash proved to be an effective method to exercise instant <b>cost</b> <b>control</b> over fees and charges incurred for products and services supplied by third parties, such as ground handling fees, technical support services and catering supplies.|$|E
25|$|Starting in 1853, Thomas A. Scott of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company {{employed}} Carnegie as a secretary/telegraph operator at {{a salary}} of $4.00 per week ($125.00 in 2017 dollars). Carnegie accepted this job with the railroad as he saw more prospects for career growth and experience with the railroad than with the telegraph company. At age 24, Scott asked Carnegie if he could handle being superintendent of the Western Division of the Pennsylvania Railroad. On December 1, 1859, Carnegie officially became superintendent of the Western Division. Carnegie then hired his sixteen-year-old brother, Tom, to be his personal secretary and telegraph operator. Not only did Carnegie hire his brother, but he also hired his cousin, Maria Hogan, who became the first female telegraph operator in the country. As superintendent Carnegie made {{a salary of}} fifteen hundred dollars a year ($47,000 in 2017). His employment by the Pennsylvania Railroad Company would be vital to his later success. The railroads were the first big businesses in America, and the Pennsylvania {{was one of the}} largest of them all. Carnegie learned much about management and <b>cost</b> <b>control</b> during these years, and from Scott in particular.|$|E

40|$|The {{traditional}} costing {{system was}} originally developed in England when industrial engineers and cost accountants applied a primary concept of cost accounting systems to minimise {{the risk of}} bankruptcy during times of recession. The conventional Bills of Quantities (BoQ) arbitrarily distributed average overheads to the real jobs or projects on a direct labour basis. There {{would seem to be}} an invisible cost-causal relationship between overheads and activities. Project overheads are indirect costs that are not necessarily defined in close relation to the activities. The Activity-Based Costing (ABC) system enables it to assign costs to every activity, then to jobs or projects. This paper aims to investigate an application of the ABC system for the management of project overheads to increase profit during construction operations and to develop a <b>cost</b> <b>controlling</b> concept, through a thorough review of literature and a critical discussion. The ABC system provides diverse cost drivers in assigning accurately the project overheads to every activity and demonstrates clear insights of cost cause-and-effect relationships to the jobs or project packages. The ABC system would, therefore, be implemented suitably to develop an Activity-Based <b>Cost</b> <b>Controlling</b> (ABCC) model for the management of project overheads, and as a <b>cost</b> <b>controlling</b> tool and technique to increase profit during the construction stage in the construction industry...|$|R

2500|$|Businesses {{that stock}} too little {{inventory}} cannot {{take advantage of}} large orders from customers if they cannot deliver. The conflicting objectives of <b>cost</b> <b>control</b> and customer service often pit an organization's financial and operating managers against its sales and marketing departments. Salespeople, in particular, often receive sales-commission payments, so unavailable goods may reduce their potential personal income. This conflict can be minimised by reducing production time to being near or less than customers' expected delivery time. This effort, known as [...] "Lean production" [...] will significantly reduce working capital tied up in inventory and reduce manufacturing costs (See the Toyota Production System).|$|E
2500|$|In addition, the {{principle}} of strict <b>cost</b> <b>control</b> was also applied to aircraft maintenance and flight operations. This entailed outsourcing all engineering work as the fleet {{was too small to}} warrant Lloyd International setting up its own maintenance department. It furthermore involved [...] "buying" [...] flying hours at a fixed rate. Moreover, through Wheelock Marden, Lloyd International was indirectly associated with the Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering Company. This enabled it to draw on that company's extensive spares pool in Hong Kong. (Other than Hong Kong, Lloyd International pursued a policy of not stationing any spares along regular routes flown by its aircraft. Instead each aircraft carried its own spares kit — usually consisting of a spare wheel and brake — and a ground engineer.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The airline {{tends to}} offer lower fares, which {{requires}} strict <b>cost</b> <b>control.</b> Part of the airline's lower cost structure includes operation of McDonnell Douglas MD-80 jets, which the airline can purchase and refurbish {{for as little}} as $4 million. While the aircraft are less fuel-efficient than newer planes, Allegiant is able to purchase used MD-80s outright for one-tenth the cost of a new Boeing 737 although Allegiant has subsequently purchased used Boeing 757-200s, Airbus A319s and Airbus A320s. (the 757s were acquired for its Hawaii service while the Airbus jets are beginning to replace MD-80 aircraft). [...] Given the low cost of ownership, Allegiant is able to operate its aircraft less (seven flight hours per day on average versus 13 hours per day at JetBlue Airways), which helps keep labor costs lower. Overall, Allegiant operates with 35 full-time workers per plane compared to more than 50 at other carriers. Allegiant schedules their crew members so that they always return to their domicile {{at the end of the}} day, thus avoiding the need for hotel rooms which can be a costly expense for airlines.|$|E
