Environmental contaminants considered were solid particulates, microorganisms, ammonia, and typical animal odors. The 12 -day test conducted in August 1988 was designed to verify that the rodent RAHF system would adequately support and maintain animal specimens during normal system operations. Additional objectives of this test were to demonstrate that: (1) the system would capture typical particulate debris produced by the animal; (2) microorganisms would be contained; and (3) the passage of animal odors was adequately controlled. In addition, the amount of carbon dioxide exhausted by the RAHF system was to be quantified. Of primary importance during the test was the demonstration that the RAHF would contain particles greater than 150 micrometers. This was verified after analyzing collection plates placed under exhaust air ducts and and rodent cages during cage maintenance operations, e. g., waste tray and feeder <b>changeouts.</b> Microbiological testing identified no additional organisms in the test environment that could be traced to the RAHF. Odor containment was demonstrated to be less than barely detectable. Ammonia could not be detected in the exhaust air from the RAHF system.

40|$|Industrial cooling {{remains one}} of the largest {{potential}} areas for electrical energy savings in industrial plants today. This is in spite of a relatively small amount of attention paid to it by energy auditors and rebate program designers. US DOE tool suites, for example, have long focused on combustion related systems and motor systems with a focus on pumps and compressors. A chilled water tool designed by UMass was available for some time but is no longer being supported by its designers or included in the government tool website. Even with the focus on motor systems, auditing programs like the DOE's Industrial Assessment Center program show dramatically less energy savings for electrical based systems than fossil fueled ones. This paper demonstrates the large amount of increased saving from a critical review of plant chilled water systems with both hardware and operational improvements. After showing several reasons why cooling systems are often ignored during plant energy surveys (their complexity, lack of data on operations etc.), three specific upgrades are considered which have become more reliable and cost effective in the recent past. These include chiller <b>changeouts,</b> right sizing of systems with load matching, and floating head pressures as a retrofit. Considerations of free cooling and improved cooling tower operations are shown as additional "big hitters?. It is made clear that with appropriate measurements and an understanding of the cooling system, significant savings can be obtained with reasonable paybacks and low risk...|$|R

40|$|Sometime in {{the late}} 1990 's, if all goes {{according}} to plan, Space Station Freedom will allow the United States and its cooperating partners to maintain a permanent presence in space. Acting as a scientific base of operations, it will {{also serve as a}} way station for future explorations of the Moon and perhaps even Mars. Systems onboard the station will have longer lifetimes, higher reliability, and lower maintenance requirements than seen on any previous space flight vehicle. Accordingly, the station will have to be resupplied with consumables (air, water, food, etc.) and other equipment <b>changeouts</b> (experiments, etc.) on a periodic basis. Waste materials and other products will also be removed from the station for return to Earth. The availability of a Logistics Resupply Module (LRM), akin to the Soviet's Progress vehicle, would help to accomplish these tasks. Riding into orbit on an expendable launch vehicle, the LRM would be configured to rendezvous autonomously and dock with the space station. After the module is emptied of its cargo, waste material from the space station would be loaded back into it. The module would then begin its descent to a recovery point on Earth. Logistics Resupply Modules could be configured in a variety of forms {{depending on the type of}} cargo being transferred. If the LRM's were cycled to the space station in such a way that at least one vehicle remained parked at the station at all times, the modules could serve double duty as crew emergency return capsules. A pressurized LRM could then bring two or more crew-persons requiring immediate return (because of health problems, system failure, or unavoidable catastrophes) back to Earth. Large cost savings would be accrued by combining the crew return function with a logistics resupply system...|$|R
40|$|Worldwide, nearly 3 billion people— 40 % of {{the global}} population—burn wood, coal, and other solid fuels every day to cook their food; this number is even larger when {{including}} those who heat their homes with solid fuels as well. Exposure to pollution from heating and cooking fires causes about 3 million deaths each year, {{making it one of}} the biggest environmental health problems the world faces. The harm from this smoke is not restricted to those who breathe it, however: it contains gases and particles that contribute to global climate change as well. Chapter 2 shows that household cooking with solid fuels caused an estimated 12 % of population-weighted ambient PM 2. 5 worldwide in 2010. Exposure to this air pollution caused the loss of 370, 000 lives and 9. 9 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) globally in the same year. In Chapter 3 I demonstrate that household heating with solid fuels caused an estimated 21 % of population-weighted ambient PM 2. 5 in 2010 in Central Europe, 13 % in Eastern Europe, 12 % in Western Europe, and 8 % in North America. Exposure to this air pollution results caused approximately 60, 000 premature deaths in Europe, and nearly 10, 000 deaths in North America, as well as an estimated 1. 0 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in Europe and 160, 000 DALYs in North America. Chapter 4 addresses drivers of household wood combustion pollution in the San Francisco Bay Area, where the sector is the largest source of PM 2. 5 and regulators recently introduced amendments to wood burning rules for the airshed. Fireplaces are the source of the vast majority (84 %) of PM 2. 5 from residential wood combustion in the San Francisco Bay Area, despite their use primarily as an aesthetic or recreational combustion activity. By evaluating hypothetical fuel and combustion device <b>changeouts,</b> I find that replacing fireplaces with gas would yield significant health and economic benefits. Specifically, retrofitting frequently used fireplaces (300, 000 units) to gas inserts in the Bay Area’s nine counties would reduce sector emissions by about 90 %, avoiding approximately 140 - 310 premature deaths and 19, 000 lost days of work each year, and creating upwards of $ 1 billion in annual financial benefits from improved public health. Chapter 5 explains methodological overlaps and differences between the previous chapters. In Chapter 6, I explore the current regulatory and policy mechanisms specific to household heating with solid fuels, and relate these to the climate change implications associated with the sector. In Chapter 7, I highlight the relative dearth of data on household heating with biomass and its nuanced climate implications. This leads to a series of recommendations for future research, including collection of better household heating data in China and further work to understand how household combustion of biomass interfaces with both local air quality policy and climate change mitigation, outlining areas where this topic is currently visible in California...|$|R
40|$|LecturePg. 133 - 138 Turbomachinery life expectancy, {{economic}} conditions, {{and plant}} capacity enhancements {{have created a}} need for vintage compressors to be reevaluated and re-engineered for operational parameters {{that may not have}} been incorporated in the original design. Aerodynamic revamps have been standard practice for optimizing flow conditions to today's processes. These <b>changeouts</b> have traditionally been limited to manipulation within designed pressure ratings. Recently, in addition to the aerodynamic enhancements, processes are requiring increased pressure levels. These new requirements and requests have posed questions and concerns which have not been of predominant importance previously. Integrity of the containment vessel, leakage of process gases, condition, and life expectancy at above design conditions must be addressed to make an informed comparison between a rerate and purchase of replacement equipment. The hazards and possible expenses of operating turbomachinery above rated pressures without a systematic and consistent verification process should be avoided. Hence, a new field has been undertaken by OEMs driven by equipment user request, to certify existing casings at increased levels in the safest and most reliable manner. The following guidelines have been produced to conduct such rerates with minimal risk to the compressor case and thus, the processes in which these machines play an intricate part: ? Specific case testing history ? Examine records and designs to determine if the casing has been hydrotested previously, or has been hydrotested to appropriate new condition levels. ? Review of similar vintage machinery ? Review designs of similar machines built in the same era to determine if ratings have ever been within appropriate levels. ? Analyze the specific case design ? Analyze the case with the use of modem and proven finite element methods to verify the integrity of the case design at elevated pressures based on blueprint dimensions. Review data with the user, discussing concerns of both parties and come to a consensus whether a hydrotest is feasible. ? Inspect and review ? Inspect the case per manufacturing blueprints to verify thickness and overall condition of the case and continuity of FEA model. With the use of magnetic particles, inspect the casing for indications and discontinuities which could endanger the casing during the hydrotest. Review the data and determine if continuation of testing is feasible. ? Strain gauge casing ? Place strain gauge equipment at key high stress locations based on FEA model to protest casing during hydrotesting. ? Hydrotest case ? With online strain readings, hydrotest casing to the appropriate levels. Carefully monitor the strain data to protect the casing from going beyond prescribed stress levels at the desired pressure levels. If stress levels appear to be approaching recommended limits, consensus should be made on whether to continue. ? Recertification ? After a successful hydrotest, rerate the compressor name plate and records for the new pressure level. The following paper will use a case history as a step by step example to show how case recertification has been accomplished in the safest possible manner with minimal risk to equipment...|$|R

Discussed herein are the utility?s operation experience and the evolution of pump component design to accommodate the attendant increase in running time at reduced capacities. Changes were made in the hydraulic and mechanical design of the pump, and in overhaul and maintenance procedures. With these improvements, the original <b>changeout</b> interval has been restored for both base lose and cycling operation. Continued developments in the area of high energy pump technology promise even greater durability in the future...|$|E
40|$|The Space Station Prototype (SSP) Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS) {{hardware}} {{was designed}} and built to be maintainable by the flight crew. To achieve this goal, subsystems were designed for ease of component removal and installation, which included accessibility to component fasteners and connectors, adequate tool clearance, minimum fluid loss during <b>changeout,</b> positive capture of loose parts during <b>changeout,</b> replacement by one crewman, and protection of adjacent parts during maintenance. During testing of this hardware, many day-to-day problems arose which allowed {{the evaluation of the}} maintenance concepts under actual maintenance conditions. This paper briefly discusses the maintenance objectives of the hardware design. Specific maintenance designs and their test evaluations are discussed. A removable cartridge valve concept for liquid line components and threaded mechanical fittings and V-band couplings for gaseous line components are critiqued. Other maintenance devices are also evaluated...|$|E
