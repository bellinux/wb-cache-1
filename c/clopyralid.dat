50|$|<b>Clopyralid</b> (3,6-dichloro-2-pyridinecarboxylic acid) is a {{selective}} herbicide used {{for control of}} broadleaf weeds, especially thistles and clovers. <b>Clopyralid</b> is in the picolinic acid family of herbicides, which also includes aminopyralid, picloram, triclopyr, and several less common herbicides. For control of Creeping Thistle, Cirsium arvense, a noxious, perennial weed, <b>clopyralid</b> {{is one of the}} few effective herbicides available. It is particularly damaging to peas, tomatoes and sunflowers and can render potatoes, lettuce and spinach inedible. It does not affect members of the family Poaceae (grasses).|$|E
50|$|<b>Clopyralid</b> is {{licensed}} for lawn use in France {{and under}} the following names:Bayer Jardin: Désherbant jeune gazon and Scanner Sélectif gazonVilmorin: désherbant Gazon LONPAR.Brand names of <b>clopyralid</b> in the US market include Stinger, Transline, Reclaim, Curtail, Confront, Clopyr AG, Lontrel, Millennium Ultra, Millenium Ultra Plus and Redeem.|$|E
50|$|<b>Clopyralid</b> {{is known}} for its ability to persist in dead plants and compost, and has {{accumulated}} to phytotoxic levels in finished compost in a few highly publicized cases. This first came to light in Washington State when, during 2000 and 2001, residues of <b>clopyralid</b> were detected in commercial compost, and compost made at a municipal site damaged tomatoes and other garden plants planted in it. Word quickly spread to other local and state governments and in 2002, DowAgro, the manufacturer of <b>clopyralid,</b> voluntarily deregistered it for use on domestic lawns in the US and it is banned in several US states but it is found in consumer products in Europe such as Scotts Verdone Extra and Vitax Lawn Clear 2.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Clopyralid</b> is a {{broadleaf}} herbicide in the pyridine group, used {{mainly in}} turf, rangeland, and {{for control of}} noxious thistles. Notorious {{for its ability to}} persist in compost, it is another example of synthetic auxin.|$|E
5000|$|Most {{herbicides}} {{used for}} controlling Yellow Star-thistle are registered for range lands, right-of-way, and other non-crop areas. Many auxin-like or growth-regulator herbicides {{are used for}} post-emergence control, including 2,4-D, aminopyralid, <b>clopyralid,</b> dicamba, picloram and triclopyr. Alternatively, glyphosate (e.g., Monsanto [...] "Roundup") may be used. Pre-emergence herbicides used for yellow star-thistle control include chlorsulfuron and sulfometuron. Pre-emergence and post-emergence herbicides may be used effectively together to kill growing plants {{as well as any}} new seedlings that may emerge from the copious soil seed bank often produced by yellow starthistle. Controlled burning may also be used in conjunction with <b>clopyralid</b> application as an effective integrated approach to yellow star-thistle management.|$|E
50|$|A yellow star-thistle biotype {{resistant}} to picloram {{was discovered in}} a pasture near Dayton, Ohio in 1988. This biotype was determined to have cross resistance to other auxin-like herbicides, especially <b>clopyralid.</b> Resistance was discovered to be conveyed by a single nuclear recessive gene.|$|E
50|$|Chemical control can be {{achieved}} {{with a variety of}} products including: <b>Clopyralid,</b> glyphosate, Diquat, Picloram, and 2, 4-D ester. However, caution must be exercised when using these products, and their use is not always appropriate, especially near water surfaces and other sensitive natural habitats. Check with local, regional, and national regulations directing use.|$|E
50|$|It is {{also used}} for {{broadleaf}} weeds, particularly Creeping Charlie (Glechoma hederacea). It is sold under the trade names Turflon, Weed-B-Gon (purple label), and Brush-B-Gon ("Poison Ivy Killer") for these purposes.

50|$|Because {{of their}} shorter life cycle, cotton thistle plants can be {{effectively}} treated with herbicides. All herbicide treatments {{should be applied}} at the rosette stage of the plant. Generally, herbicide applications would be in early spring or autumn. One of the primary difficulties in chemical control of cotton thistles is their ability to germinate nearly year round. From autumn to spring a range of plant sizes can be found which may result in variable success from chemical control. Herbicides are very effective on seedlings and young rosettes, but control becomes more variable with increasing plant age. Onopordum spp. seeds may persist for several years in the soil. Buried seed may persist for up to twenty years, and reinfestation is likely without yearly management. Therefore, several years of re-treatment may be necessary. Picloram, dicamba, 2,4-D, dicamba + 2,4,-D, and metsulfuron are effective for controlling Cotton Thistle. <b>Clopyralid</b> is more selective for controlling plants in the Asteraceae family, but will also injure or kill legumes.|$|E
50|$|Aside from {{mechanical}} removal or borax treatment, {{the other}} alternative for Glechoma infestation is use of commercial herbicides. There is some disagreement over {{the effectiveness of}} various herbicides, with dicamba (Trimec and Weed-B-Gon) and 2,4-D being described variously as both effective and ineffective by different sources. Some {{or all of the}} disagreement {{may be due to the}} existence of subpopulations which have differing susceptibilities to different compounds, as well as to differing rates of application. To avoid generating herbicide resistance, the same product should not be used several years in succession; rather, various products should be used in rotation.Triclopyr has also been described as effective, and <b>Clopyralid,</b> MCPP, and quinclorac as ineffective. Fluroxypyr and Confront have also been described as effective, but sales of both are restricted to professionals. Two applications ten to fourteen days apart are necessary; also, the ability of the surviving plants to regenerate after 24 days can require a second treatment four or five weeks later, and even more followups.|$|E
40|$|<b>Clopyralid</b> is an auxin-mimic type herbicide. It is more {{selective}} (kills {{a more limited}} range of plants) than some other auxin-mimic herbicides like picloram, triclopyr, or 2, 4 -D. Like other auxin-mimics, it has little effect on grasses and other monocots, but also does little harm {{to members of the}} mustard family (Brassicaceae) and several other groups of broad-leaved plants. <b>Clopyralid</b> controls many annual and perennial broadleaf weeds, particularly of the Asteraceae (sunflower family), Fabaceae (legume family), Solanaceae (nightshade family), Polygonaceae (knotweed family), and Violaceae (violet family). It is chemically similar to picloram, but <b>clopyralid</b> has a shorter half-life, is more water-soluble, and has a lower adsorption capacity than picloram. Clopyralid’s half-life in the environment averages one to two months and ranges up to one year. It is degraded almost entirely by microbial metabolism in soils and aquatic sediments. <b>Clopyralid</b> is not degraded by sunlight or hydrolysis. The inability of <b>clopyralid</b> to bind with soils and its persistence implies that <b>clopyralid</b> {{has the potential to be}} highly mobile and a contamination threat to water resources and non-target plant species, although no extensive offsite movement has been documented. <b>Clopyralid</b> can cause severe eye damage if splashed into the eyes during application, but otherwise is non-toxic to fish, birds, mammals, and other animals...|$|E
40|$|The role of {{ethylene}} in herbicidal injury {{induced by}} 4 -amino- 3, 5, 6 -trichloropicolinic acid (picloram) or 3, 6 -dichloropicolinic acid (<b>clopyralid)</b> {{was investigated in}} sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) and rapeseed (Brassica napus L. cv Altex). Picloram induces herbicide injury in both species, whereas <b>clopyralid</b> induces injury only in sunflower. Picloram applied to the third leaf of a rapeseed plant increased ethylene evolution several-fold. <b>Clopyralid</b> {{had no effect on}} ethylene production in rapeseed. In sunflower, both picloram and <b>clopyralid</b> elevated ethylene production. Ethylene biosynthesis induced by the herbicide treatment was not restricted to treated areas. When <b>clopyralid</b> was applied only to the lower stem and cotyledons of sunflower, the herbicide treatment resulted in an increase in the rate of ethylene production from the true leaves. Increased ethylene production preceded or coincided with the onset of morphological responses induced by a herbicide application to a susceptible species. The contrast in ethylene production by these two plant species cannot be accounted for by differences in absorption and translocation of <b>clopyralid</b> and picloram...|$|E
40|$|The {{herbicide}} <b>clopyralid</b> (Transline) {{is commonly}} applied by air to control yellow starthistle, a noxious weed, in California. In laboratory studies, <b>clopyralid</b> toxicity in Fowler’s toad was low, indicating a wide safety margin when used under field conditions. In addition, monitoring of <b>clopyralid</b> drift following aerial application demonstrated that 98 -foot (30 -meter) buffers between treatment areas and water sources provided adequate drift protection for an adjacent stream and vernal pools. Nevertheless, {{to ensure that}} movement of the herbicide to water sources is minimized, {{it is important to}} prevent application error, particularly accidental encroachment into established buffer zones. This study demonstrated that drift potential for <b>clopyralid</b> was minimal even with an aerial application and a slight downwind breeze toward sensitive aquatic sites. It is also the first report demonstrating a high tolerance to <b>clopyralid</b> in larval toads...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the studies}} was to {{determine}} the influence of copper and zinc contamination on <b>clopyralid</b> dissipation in soil. The experiment was carried out in laboratory conditions (plant growth chamber). <b>Clopyralid</b> was applied to three different soils [similar textures, pH, organic carbon content and contrasting copper and zinc content: soil natural contaminated with Cu and Zn (S 1), soil with natural low Cu and Zn concentration (S 2) and soil S 21 prepared in the laboratory (S 2 soil additionally contaminated with Cu and Zn salts in the amounts equivalent to contamination level of S 1 soil) ]. Soil samples were taken for analyses for 1 hour (initial concentration) and 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 and 96 days after treatment. <b>Clopyralid</b> residue was analysed using GC/ECD (gas chromatography with electron capture detector). Good linearity was found between logarithmic concentration of <b>clopyralid</b> residues and time. The differences in Cu and Zn content influenced the <b>clopyralid</b> decay in soil. The values of DT 50 obtained in the experiment ranged from 21 to 27 days. A high concentration of Cu and Zn in soil slowed down <b>clopyralid</b> degradation (the DT 50 value was higher – 25 – 27 days) ...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1986 Field {{studies were}} started at Hyslop Farm, Corvallis, Oregon in 1984 to {{determine}} the soil persistence of the herbicide <b>clopyralid</b> (3, 6 -dichloropicolinic acid) under cropping situations. The herbicide was sprayed on bare soil at the proposed use rate of 0. 14 kg/ha {{in the spring and}} on the same plots at a high rate of 0. 56 kg/ha in the summer. Winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L. 'Stephen') was seeded in the same fall. Treated plots did not yield differently than untreated plots. Safflower (Carthamus tinctorius L.), a crop known to be sensitive to <b>clopyralid,</b> was planted in the spring of 1985 to the area treated with <b>clopyralid</b> in 1984. Safflower grew normally and fresh weights were not reduced. Greenhouse bioassays were conducted on soil samples collected from two separate sets of plots treated with <b>clopyralid</b> in the fall of 1984 or the spring of 1985. The application rates were 0. 56 and 1. 12 kg/ha. Lentil (Lentilla lens L.), safflower, and peas (Pisum sativum L.) were used as indicator plants. From the plots sprayed in the fall, soil samples were collected at 0, 14, 34, 54, 114, 220, and 287 days after treatment. <b>Clopyralid</b> disappeared faster in the second depth (10 to 20 cm depth) than in the first depth (0 to 10 cm depth). No herbicide was detected in the second depth 220 days after treatment but in the first depth there was sufficient herbicide to cause growth reduction in all of the indicator species. In soil sampled 287 days after applying either 0. 56 or 1. 12 kg/ha, enough herbicide remained in the first depth to produce slight symptoms on lentil. No herbicide injury was observed on peas or safflower. From plots sprayed in the spring, soil samples were collected 0, 14, 28, and 56 days after treatment. In the spring, <b>clopyralid</b> dissipated more slowly than in the fall, based on the observation that the indicator plants were more severely injured when grown in soil samples collected following the spring application than they were following the fall application. Adding 2, 4 -D did not affect <b>clopyralid</b> persistence. <b>Clopyralid</b> and XRM- 3785 (<b>clopyralid</b> + 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxy acetic acid) at the same dosage of <b>clopyralid</b> disappeared from the soil at approximately the same time...|$|E
40|$|During the {{establishment}} of native plants in revegetation projects, the plants often need {{to be released from}} weed competition, but little is known of their tolerance of herbicides suitable for release spraying.

40|$|Montmorillonite (SWy- 2) -chitosan bionanocomposites (SW-CH) were {{prepared}} following different methodologies, characterized, and assayed as adsorbents of the herbicide <b>clopyralid</b> (3, 6 -dichloropyridine- 2 -carboxylic acid) {{in aqueous solution}} and soil/water suspensions, to assess {{the potential of the}} materials to prevent and remediate soil and water contamination by anionic pesticides. The SW-CH bionanocomposites were good adsorbents for the herbicide at pH levels where both the anionic form of the herbicide (pK a= 2. 3) and the cationic form of CH (pK a= 6. 3) predominated. The performance of the SW-CH bionanocomposites as adsorbents of <b>clopyralid</b> depended on the amount and arrangement of chitosan in the samples. <b>Clopyralid</b> adsorption was rapid and mostly linear up to herbicide concentrations as high as 0. 5 mM. High salt concentrations (0. 1 M NaCl) promoted desorption of the adsorbed pesticide from SW-CH, strongly suggesting that adsorption of <b>clopyralid</b> occurred primarily through an ion exchange mechanism on positively charged CH sites at the montmorillonite surface. Amendment of an acidic soil (pH= 4. 5) with SW-CH at rates of 5 % and 10 % led to a significant increase in <b>clopyralid</b> adsorption, whereas this effect was negligible when SW-CH was added to an alkaline soil (pH= 8. 0), reflecting the absence of positively charged sites in SW-CH at high pH values.

40|$|Abstract: The {{stability}} of the herbicide <b>clopyralid</b> (3, 6 -dichloro- 2 -pyridinecarboxylic acid) was studied under different experimental conditions of pH, illumination and initial substrate concentration. It was found that in the pH interval from 1. 0 to 9. 0 in the presence/absence of daylight, <b>clopyralid</b> solutions were stable {{for at least a}} period of two months. The kinetics of the photocatalytic degradation of <b>clopyralid</b> in aqueous suspensions of TiO 2 (Degussa P 25) under UV and visible light, as well as of direct photolysis using the same radiation sources, were also investigated. It was found that the rate of photocatalytic degradation in the presence of UV light was more than five times higher compared to direct photolysis, whereas in the presence of visible light, the corresponding rates of photocatalytic/photolytic degradation were much lower (more than 15 times). The reaction in the investigation concentration range is zero-order with respect to the degradation of the <b>clopyralid</b> pyridine moiety, with a reaction rate of 3. 4 × 10 - 6 mol dm- 3 min- 1 and an adsorption coefficient of the substrate of 2. 5 × 10 4 dm 3 mol- 1...|$|E

40|$|International audiencePhotolyses {{of three}} herbicides, bentazon, <b>clopyralid,</b> and triclopyr, were studied on plant leaves after crop treatment.

30|$|The {{results of}} the two trials show that some {{alternative}} treatments could be used either to replace terbuthylazine and hexazinone, or to reduce inputs during {{the first and second}} year of weed control, notably for sites dominated by C. scoparius. For the Pinus radiata trial, the treatments with the highest potential were either (i) an aerial application of 1125  g ha− 1 <b>clopyralid,</b> 225  g ha− 1 triclopyr and 150  g ha− 1 haloxyfop in the spring following planting, and the year after or (ii) spot control with 1200  g ha− 1 terbuthylazine and 300  g ha− 1 hexazinone in the spring following planting, followed by an aerial broadcast release with 1500  g ha− 1 <b>clopyralid,</b> 150  g ha− 1 triclopyr and 150  g ha− 1 haloxyfop in spring of year 2.

30|$|In {{a survey}} of New Zealand forest managers, Rolando et al.

The three combinations of herbicides assessed in this trial based on <b>clopyralid</b> gave good control of broom at all rates assessed, though the two mixtures with triclopyr were more effective than the clopyralid/picloram mixture, especially when on 12 -month-old broom. The medium rate tested for the two treatments that included both <b>clopyralid</b> and triclopyr mixtures (clo/tric and cpat) (which were based on rates recommended to forestry managers) appeared similar in efficacy. Although the highest rate of the clopyralid/triclopyr mix (clo/tric-H) gave slightly better control than the medium rate of both mixes (clo/tric-M and cpat-M), the difference was not statistically significant and cost was twice the medium rates. Thus, there {{does not appear to be}} an advantage in adding picloram and aminopyralid to the clopyralid/triclopyr mix. However, the clopyralid/triclopyr/picloram/aminopyralid mix would cost the same as the clopyralid/triclopyr mix based on the prices obtained from Askin and Askin (2014) (Table  1). Comparisons of costs will vary depending on market prices for the various forms of triclopyr and combinations available.|$|E

However, under the same experimental conditions, no degradation of <b>clopyralid</b> was observed in the presence of any of the mentioned catalysts. When the kinetics of mecoprop degradation was studied using UV light, more efficient were the undoped powders, while in the case of <b>clopyralid,</b> N-doped TiO 2 Degussa P 25 powder was most efficient, which is probably a consequence of the difference in the molecular structure of the two herbicides...|$|E

Equilibrium adsorption coefficients (K(d)) were measured using a batch equilibration procedure, and mobility was studied in repacked columns of the soils under fluctuating saturated/unsaturated flow conditions. Breakthrough curves (BTCs) {{were consistent with}} an inverse relationship between leaching and adsorption with greater mobility of the weakly-adsorbed <b>clopyralid</b> than the more strongly adsorbed thiazafluron or metamitron. The BTC data were {{used to evaluate the}} LEACHP simulation model. Following model calibration with respect to hydrological parameters and some of the herbicide degradation rates, the best fits between predicted and observed data were with the less adsorptive and highly mobile <b>clopyralid.</b> In general, the model gave acceptable predictions of the timing of the concentration maxima and the shapes of the BTCs, although earlier breakthrough than that observed was predicted with the less mobile herbicides, thiazafluron and metamitron, in the silty-clay soils. For metamitron, the total amounts leached were not predicted accurately, suggesting more rapid degradation of the herbicide in the soil columns than in the kinetic studies performed in a 1 : 1 soil:solution ratio shaken system.

30|$|Where {{a second}} weed control {{operation}} {{was carried out}} this was predominantly (60 %) aerial application of the active ingredients <b>clopyralid</b> (3, 6 -dichloro- 2 -pyridine carboxlic acid), picloram (4 -amino- 3, 5, 6 -trichloro- 2 -pyridinecarboxylic acid) and/or triclopyr (3, 5, 6 -trichloro- 2 -pyridyloxyacetic acid) (applied as various formulated products) in 150 to 200  L ha- 1 water. Application rates of these active ingredients in second year release operations were variations around 1.5  kg ha- 1 a.i. <b>clopyralid,</b> 0.15  kg ha- 1 a.i. triclopyr and 0.05  kg ha- 1 a.i. picloram and were only applied when necessary (scrub weeds such as broom or gorse start to overtop the trees). A repeat application of terbuthylazine and hexazinone was used in one region only at rates shown in Table  3. In Northland where the difficult to kill sedges (Gahnia spp.) and grasses (such as Cortaderia selloana) occur hexazinone was also used in second release operations.|$|E
