These are the axial direction (along the grain), the radial direction, and the <b>circumferential</b> <b>direction.</b> Because the preferred coordinate system is cylindrical-polar, this type of orthotropy is also called polar orthotropy. Mechanical properties, such as strength and stiffness, measured axially (along the grain) are typically better than those measured in the radial and circumferential directions (across the grain).

In 2 D systems, at sufficiently high surface coverage, diffusive motion is widely {{known to be}} strongly affected by physical confinement, e. g., by the walls. In this Letter, we explore the effects of confinement by shape, not rigid boundaries, on the diffusion of particles by confining them {{to the surface of}} a cylinder. We find that both the magnitude and the directionality of lateral diffusion is strongly influenced by the radius of the cylinder. An anisotropy between diffusion in the longitudinal and <b>circumferential</b> <b>direction</b> of the cylinder develops. We demonstrate that the origin of this effect {{lies in the fact that}} screw-like packings of mono- and oligodisperse discs on the surface of a cylinder induce preferential collective motions in the <b>circumferential</b> <b>direction,</b> but also show that even in polydisperse systems lacking such order an intrinsic finite size confinement effect increases diffusivity in the <b>circumferential</b> <b>direction...</b>|$|E

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. An approach for three dimensional Therinohydrodyiiamic analysis of multi-lobed journal bearings is presented. The generalized Reynolds equation solution yields the Dressure distribution in the axial and <b>circumferential</b> <b>directions.</b> The energy equation is three dimensional and takes into account the convection and dissipation in axial and <b>circumferential</b> <b>directions.</b> Heat conduction through the fluid film ill axial, <b>circumferential</b> and cross-film <b>direction</b> is considered. Variation of viscosity in all three directions is considered. A finite element method is used to solve the associated partial differential equations and the associated boundary conditions. In order to obtain a stable and realistic temperature distribution, three dimensional finite element upwinding technique is developed and incorporated whenever the convective term is dominant. Reynolds boundary condition is used to determine the cavitation boundary and thermal cavitation model is applied in that region. Location and magnitudes of maximum temperature in the bearing and the pressure profiles are obtained and compared to existing data in literature.

Thus the simulation of the stress distribution and fracture parameters on the interface is essential for the structural integrity. Rubber fault is caused by material inside or pre-existing or introduced small defects in surface. Originally crack extension under load is very slowly, until one or more to reach sufficient size and become visible cracks, and then bringing the total fracture occurred. Therefore, the crack propagation characteristics of the rubber are main factors of its strength. Rivlin and Thoma...|$|E

40|$|The {{capacity}} of a composite vascular graft constituting polyurethane (PU) and gelatin to support cell growth was investigated using human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). Gelatin-based polyurethane grafts were fabricated by co-spraying polyurethane and gelatin using a spray, phase-inversion technique. Graft microstructure was investigated by light and scanning electron microscopy. Uniaxial tensile tests were performed to assess the grafts' mechanical properties in longitudinal and <b>circumferential</b> <b>directions.</b> hMSCs obtained from bone marrow aspirate were seeded onto flat graft samples. After 24, 48, and 72 h of incubation, cell morphology was evaluated by Giemsa staining and cell viability was calculated by XTT assay. SEM analysis evidenced that PU samples display a microporous structure, whereas the gelatin-based PU samples show a fibrillar appearance. The presence of cross-linked gelatin produced a significant increase of ultimate tensile strength and ultimate elongation in <b>circumferential</b> <b>directions</b> compared to PU material. Qualitative analysis of hMSC adhesion onto the grafts revealed remarkable differences between gelatin-based PU and control graft. hMSCs grown onto gelatin-based PU graft form a monolayer that reached confluence at 72 h, whereas cells seeded onto the control graft {{were not able to}} undergo appropriate spreading. hMSCs grown onto gelatin-based PU graft showed significantly higher viability than cells seeded onto bare PU at all time points.
