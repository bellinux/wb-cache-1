5|$|Considerably {{shorter than}} the average footballer at 5ft 7in, Gibbs made up for his {{physical}} disadvantage with positional play, determination, accurate tackling, and staying on his feet. Although a defender, his lack of goals (7 in 491 appearances) and reluctance to get forward were often remarked upon. Gibbs refuted the suggestion that he didn't attack enough, while former managers Roeder and Taylor both considered Gibbs to be an excellent <b>crosser</b> of the ball when he did venture forward. He scored his first professional goal during his 59th game. By comparison, Gibbs' long-term successor at right-back, Lloyd Doyley, scored his first professional goal on his 269th appearance.|$|E
5|$|Wormull helped Stevenage {{to reach}} {{the final of the}} FA Trophy in 2002, which they lost 2–0 to {{full-time}} professional club Yeovil Town. While with the club he won his seventh international cap, and maintained his reputation as a good <b>crosser</b> of the ball who was willing to shoot; in his first two seasons with the club he contributed more shots than any of his teammates, and in his second and third seasons he made most assists. Stevenage began to move towards full-time status before the 2002–03 season. At the end of that season, Wormull submitted a transfer request, because he was struggling to balance work and football commitments. Manager Graham Westley rejected the request, but in April 2004 his contract was cancelled by mutual consent, citing the player's injury record and his difficulties adjusting to the demands of full-time football.|$|E
25|$|Maldini was {{renowned for}} his {{technical}} ability, athleticism, sliding tackles, stamina, composure and fast energetic forward runs as a left-back or wing-back. He {{was also an}} excellent <b>crosser</b> of the ball, and was an effective attacking threat, scoring and assisting several goals throughout his career. In the final few years of his career, as he lost speed, he was moved to a centre-back position, where he excelled in relying on his experience, tactical ability, positioning and timing to win the ball.|$|E

500|$|Franz Beckenbauer {{said that}} the speed and skill Matthews possessed meant that [...] "almost {{no one in the}} game could stop him". John Charles noted that [...] "he was the best <b>crosser</b> I've ever seen – and he had to contend with the old heavy ball". Johnny Giles said that [...] "he had {{everything}} – good close control, great dribbling ability and he was lightning quick. He was also an intelligent player, who knew how to pass the ball". Despite his great talents, he rarely tackled opponents and was not adept at heading the ball or using his left foot.|$|E
500|$|Writing a 1947 {{critique}} of Stanley Matthews, Meredith criticised {{the lack of}} direct play on show in the 1940s and stated {{that when he was}} playing that [...] "I knew what was expected of me– to beat the wing-half and the full-back, take the ball down to the corner flag and centre". His ball control skills were unparalleled, leaving opposition players unable to tackle him. He also was an extremely accurate passer and <b>crosser</b> of the ball. His dribbling and crossing gave him a large advantage over rival wingers, who relied solely on speed to beat opposition full-backs. In addition to wing-play, he was also highly skilled at sending in long-range shots across the face of the goal, and could be relied upon to meet crosses from his left-winger with a powerful volley.|$|E

500|$|Myrie-Williams is {{generally}} deployed as a winger, and can play on either flank. He is predominantly left-footed, {{and has been}} used on the wing {{for the majority of}} his career. Despite being left-footed, Myrie-Williams states that he is much more comfortable on the right wing— cutting inside and getting a shot on goal. He has been described as being [...] "blessed with searing pace and an impressive left foot", causing defenders [...] "countless problems". Myrie-Williams believes that his strongest attribute is that he [...] "loves running at defenders", as well as being [...] "pretty confident with the ball at his feet" [...] and [...] "not being afraid to take anyone on due to his pace". He also states that he can [...] "spot a good pass", and gets as much enjoyment assisting goals as he does scoring them. He {{has been described as a}} [...] "direct winger" [...] with [...] "a habit of drifting out wide". Myrie-Williams often takes set-pieces and has been described as a [...] "dangerous <b>crosser</b> of the ball".|$|E
500|$|The bill, as amended, {{passed the}} Senate without {{recorded}} vote on March 27, 1936. [...] The House of Representatives received the bill on April 1, and referred {{it to the}} Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures. It was reported back to the House on April 16, having been amended to require the Cleveland committee to purchase not less than 25,000 coins at one time, eliminating {{the possibility that the}} committee could order an initial 5,000 and then fail to purchase any more. The full House considered the bill on April 23, 1936, with the bill reported by John Joseph Cochran of Missouri as an emergency measure. When he asked for unanimous consent to pass the amended bill, Pennsylvania's Robert F. Rich asked how many coinage bills were going to be considered and if it would not be possible to consolidate a dozen of them into one bill. [...] Cochran replied that he had consulted with Ohio's Robert <b>Crosser</b> and been informed that [...] "if we do not get the authority to print the coins now it will be useless". The following day, Bulkley moved that the Senate concur in the House amendments, which it did, and the bill was signed into law by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on May 5, 1936.|$|E

2500|$|A quick, hard-working, and {{tenacious}} player, gifted with power, pace, {{strength and}} stamina, Davids was renowned for his combative style of play, tight marking of opponents {{and ability to}} break down opposition plays as a defensive midfielder. In addition to his ball-winning ability, {{as well as his}} physical and athletic attributes, Davids was also a highly creative player, who was known for his outstanding technique, acceleration, close control, and ball-juggling skills; his technical ability and prowess at street soccer and as a freestyle footballer earned him the nickname [...] "The Mayor of the Street" [...] in his youth. Davids was also a powerful striker of the ball, as well as being an accurate passer and <b>crosser.</b> His tactical intelligence and ability to read the game, combined with his speed, energy, tackling, vision, and dribbling ability, allowed him to start counter-attacks after winning back possession and also enabled him to make forward runs and contribute to his team's offensive play. His versatility and wide range of skills thus enabled him to be deployed in several other midfield positions throughout his career; he was capable of playing as a left midfielder, or even as a central or box-to-box midfielder, and in his youth, was also deployed as an attacking midfielder, or as a second-striker on occasion. Due to his aggressive playing style, Davids earned several nicknames throughout his career, such as [...] "The Piranha", [...] "Tubarão" [...] (The Shark), and most notably, [...] "The Pitbull".|$|E
