We have addressed this issue by measuring the superior/inferior <b>correction</b> <b>factor</b> in 25 subjects and assessing the effect of using a subject-specific <b>correction</b> <b>factor</b> (CFss) for MRCA in comparison with no adaptive motion correc-tion (CF,) and erroneous adaptive motion correction with a <b>correction</b> <b>factor</b> of 1. 0 (CF,).

25|$|Since {{the basic}} {{indicator}} system in either an analog or digital meter responds to DC only, a multimeter includes an AC to DC conversion circuit for making alternating current measurements. Basic meters utilize a rectifier circuit {{to measure the}} average or peak absolute value of the voltage, but are calibrated to show the calculated root mean square (RMS) value for a sinusoidal waveform; this will give correct readings for alternating current as used in power distribution. User guides for some such meters give <b>correction</b> <b>factors</b> for some simple non-sinusoidal waveforms, to allow the correct root mean square (RMS) equivalent value to be calculated. More expensive multimeters include an AC to DC converter that measures the true RMS value of the waveform within certain limits; the user manual for the meter may indicate {{the limits of the}} crest factor and frequency for which the meter calibration is valid. RMS sensing is necessary for measurements on non-sinusoidal periodic waveforms, such as found in audio signals and variable-frequency drives.|$|E

25|$|Newton's laws {{of motion}} {{describe}} {{the motion of}} an object in an inertial (non-accelerating) frame of reference. When Newton's laws are transformed to a rotating frame of reference, the Coriolis force and centrifugal force appear. Both forces are proportional to {{the mass of the}} object. The Coriolis force is proportional to the rotation rate and the centrifugal force is proportional to its square. The Coriolis force acts in a direction perpendicular to the rotation axis and to the velocity of the body in the rotating frame and is proportional to the object's speed in the rotating frame (more precisely, to the component of its velocity that is perpendicular to the axis of rotation). The centrifugal force acts outwards in the radial direction and is proportional to the distance of the body from the axis of the rotating frame. These additional forces are termed inertial forces, fictitious forces or pseudo forces. They allow the application of Newton's laws to a rotating system.

Notable improvements include rebuilding dangerous intersections, pulling back stop lines for cars to improve visibility of cyclists, and expanding the use of bicycle traffic lights, to give pre-greens for cyclists.
