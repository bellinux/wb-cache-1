5|$|As a carrier, {{the ship}} was {{to have had a}} {{complement}} of ten Bf 109 fighters and ten Ju 87 dive-bombers. She would have been armed with an anti-aircraft battery of ten 10.5cm SK C/33 guns in dual mounts, ten 3.7cm SK C/30 guns in dual mounts, and twenty-four 2cm Flak 38 guns in quadruple mounts. Conversion work was halted in June 1943, however, and the incomplete vessel was towed to Königsberg where she was eventually scuttled on 29 January 1945. The ship was seized by the advancing Soviet Army and was briefly considered for <b>cannibalization</b> for spare parts to complete her sister ship Lützow, which had been purchased by the Soviet Navy before the war. This plan was also abandoned, and {{the ship was}} broken up for scrap.|$|E
25|$|The {{success of}} Apple's lower-cost {{consumer}} models, especially the LC, {{also led to}} <b>cannibalization</b> of their higher priced machines. To address this, management introduced several new brands, selling largely identical machines at different price points aimed at different markets. These were the high-end Quadra, the mid-range Centris line, and the ill-fated Performa series. This led to significant market confusion, as customers {{did not understand the}} difference between models.|$|E
25|$|A two-door {{station wagon}} {{was added to}} the line in 1959. With the larger Rambler Six wagons offered only as four-door models, AMC's {{management}} thought there would be little sales <b>cannibalization</b> from the American. The Deluxe wagon was priced at $2,060, while the $2,145 Super version included a standard cargo-area mat and roof rack. A Deliveryman commercial wagon, with no rear seat and an extended cargo floor, was available, but found few takers. Self-adjusting brakes were added in 1959.|$|E
25|$|Maintenance was {{a problem}} for F-15 {{operations}} from the beginning. In January 1948, the entire fleet was grounded for ten days because of weather {{and a lack of}} spare parts, mostly heat exchangers that were found to be cracking prematurely. Because of the lack of spare heat exchangers, replacements had to be obtained from F-15s in storage at JAMA. By February 1948 the parts problem had become so critical that the 8th PRS had an average in service rate of only two aircraft. <b>Cannibalization</b> of both damaged and flyable aircraft eventually brought this rate up, but the unit would never reach a strength of sixteen operational aircraft again, reaching a high of fifteen only once, in December 1948.|$|E
25|$|The {{captured}} aircraft at Phan Rang AB {{were later}} {{used by the}} VPAF in missions during the Cambodian–Vietnamese War and the Sino-Vietnamese War. The A-37s flew most of the ground support missions in those conflicts, being more suited to the role than the VPAF's MiG-17s and MiG-21s. Several squadrons of captured UH-1H Hueys were also operated by the VPAF for many years from Phan Rang. These aircraft were maintained by <b>cannibalization</b> and/or black market smuggling of spare parts. They were phased out of service in the 1980s and 1990s, in all probability {{due to lack of}} spares. Some of the aircraft were shipped to Vietnam's allies like Czechoslovakia, Poland, the Soviet Union and East Germany. Others were sold to private foreign owners, although probably a dozen or so UH-1s still remain in VPAF service.|$|E
500|$|Renamed Weser, {{the ship}} was {{to have had a}} {{complement}} of ten Bf 109 fighters and ten Ju 87 divebombers. Work was not completed, however, and the incomplete vessel was towed to Königsberg where she was eventually scuttled. The ship was seized by the advancing Soviet Army and was briefly considered for <b>cannibalization</b> for spare parts to complete her sistership [...] for the Soviet Navy. This plan was also abandoned, and {{the ship was}} broken up for scrap.|$|E
2500|$|Multiple {{methods of}} sexual {{approaches}} have evolved in cannibalistic species {{as a result}} of sexual cannibalism. [...] The mechanism by which the male approaches the female is imperative for his survival. If the female is unable to detect his presence, the male is less likely to face <b>cannibalization.</b> This is evident in the mantid species,Tenodera aridifolia, where the male alters his approach utilizing the surrounding windy conditions. The male attempts to avoid detection by approaching the female when the wind impairs her ability to hear him. [...] In the praying mantid species, Pseudomantis albofimbrata, the males approach the female either from a [...] "slow mounting from the rear" [...] or a [...] "slow approach from the front" [...] position to remain undetected. The male alters his approach through the utilization of the surrounding windy conditions, and thus the risk of facing <b>cannibalization</b> is reduced.|$|E
2500|$|The risk of {{cannibalism}} becomes {{greatly reduced}} when opportunistic mating is practiced. [...] Opportunistic mating {{has been characterized}} in numerous orb-weaving spider species, such as Nephila fenestrata, where the male spider waits until the female is feeding or distracted, and then proceeds with copulation; this greatly reduces the chances of <b>cannibalization.</b> This distraction can be facilitated by the male's presentation of nuptial gifts, where they provide a distracting meal for the female in order to prolong copulation and increase paternity.|$|E
2500|$|During the 1892–1894 {{war between}} the Congo Free State and the Swahili-Arab city-states of Nyangwe and Kasongo in Eastern Congo, {{there were reports of}} {{widespread}} <b>cannibalization</b> of the bodies of defeated Arab combatants by the Batetela allies of Belgian commander Francis Dhanis. [...] The Batetela, [...] "like most of their neighbors were inveterate cannibals." [...] According to Dhanis' medical officer, Captain Hinde, their town of Ngandu had [...] "at least 2,000 polished human skulls" [...] as a [...] "solid white pavement in front" [...] of its gates, with human skulls crowning every post of the stockade.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{well-documented}} case {{occurred in}} Chichi-jima in February 1945, when Japanese soldiers killed and consumed five American airmen. This case {{was investigated in}} 1947 in a war crimes trial, and of 30 Japanese soldiers prosecuted, five (Maj. Matoba, Gen. Tachibana, Adm. Mori, Capt. Yoshii, and Dr. Teraki) were found guilty and hanged. [...] In his book , James Bradley details several instances of cannibalism of World War II Allied prisoners by their Japanese captors. The author claims that this included not only ritual <b>cannibalization</b> of the livers of freshly killed prisoners, but also the cannibalization-for-sustenance of living prisoners {{over the course of}} several days, amputating limbs only as needed to keep the meat fresh.|$|E
2500|$|A public {{relations}} {{campaign in the}} late 1980s proclaimed that this was [...] "not your father's Oldsmobile." [...] Ironically, many fans of the brand say that the declining sales were in fact caused by the [...] "this is not your father's Oldsmobile" [...] campaign", as the largest market for Oldsmobiles was the population whose parents had, in fact, owned Oldsmobiles and that by going away from the traditional vehicles that Oldsmobile's brand was built upon, lost many loyal buyers and put the brand {{on a collision course}} with Pontiac and Buick which led to internal <b>cannibalization</b> and a downfall from which it could never recover. Oldsmobile's final major ad campaign had the slogan [...] "Start Something" [...] in a last-ditch effort to market to younger buyers at the turn of the millennium.|$|E
2500|$|According to , an {{estimated}} 100,000 {{people died in}} one of the worst factional struggles in Guangxi in January–April 1968, before Premier Zhou sent the PLA to intervene. Zheng Yi's [...] alleged [...] "systematic killing and <b>cannibalization</b> of individuals in the name of political revolution and 'class struggle' among the Zhuang people in Wuxuan County, Guangxi, during that period. Zheng was criticized in China for reliance on unpublished interviews and for negative portrayal of a Chinese ethnic minority, although senior party historians corroborated allegations of cannibalism. Sinologist Gang Yue questioned how [...] "systematic" [...] the cannibalism could have been, given the inherent factionalism of the Cultural Revolution. In Mao's Last Revolution (2006), MacFarquhar and Schoenhals also dispute that it was communism that compelled the Zhuang in this area towards cannibalism, noting that similar incidents occurred under pressure from the Kuomintang secret police in the republican period.|$|E
2500|$|Hamilton Howard [...] "Albert" [...] Fish (May 19, 1870– January 16, 1936) was an American serial killer. He {{was also}} known as the Gray Man, the Werewolf of Wysteria, the Brooklyn Vampire, the Moon Maniac, and The Boogey Man. A child rapist and cannibal, he boasted that he [...] "had {{children}} in every state", and at one time stated the number was about 100. However, it is not known whether he was referring to rapes or <b>cannibalization,</b> nor is it known if the statement was truthful. He was a suspect in at least five murders during his lifetime. Fish confessed to three murders that police were able to trace to a known homicide, and he confessed to stabbing at least two other people. He was put on trial for the kidnapping and murder of Grace Budd, and was convicted and executed by electric chair. His crimes were dramatized in the 2007 film The Gray Man, starring Patrick Bauchau as Fish.|$|E
2500|$|The {{physiological}} {{impacts of}} cannibalism on male fitness include {{his inability to}} father any offspring if {{he is unable to}} mate with a female. [...] There are males in species of arachnids, such as N. plumipes, that sire more offspring if the male is cannibalized after or during mating; copulation is prolonged and sperm transfer is increased. In the species of orb-weaving spider, Argiope arantia, males prefer short copulation duration upon the first palp insertion in order to avoid cannibalism. Upon the second insertion, however, the male remains inserted in the female. The male exhibits a [...] "programmed death" [...] to function as a full-body genital plug. This causes it to become increasingly difficult for the female to remove him from her genital openings, discouraging her from mating with other males. An additional benefit to <b>cannibalization</b> is the idea that a well-fed female is less likely to mate again. If the female has no desire to mate again, the male who has already mated with her has his paternity ensured.|$|E
50|$|Contrary to Pyo's {{account of}} Francis Spaight, three more crewmen died {{within two days}} of <b>cannibalization</b> of Patrick O'Brien, and the {{remaining}} crew were saved six days after <b>cannibalization</b> of Patrick O'Brien.|$|E
50|$|Finally, <b>cannibalization</b> is also {{referenced}} in {{the search}} engine optimization (SEO) industry; it is known as keyword <b>cannibalization.</b> Keyword <b>cannibalization</b> happens when multiple pages on a website specifically target the same content, {{to the point where}} the search engine has a difficult time determining which page is most relevant for the search query, and thus might not necessarily promote the page one would want website visitors to see most.|$|E
50|$|Another common case of <b>cannibalization</b> is when companies, {{particularly}} retail companies, open sites {{too close}} to each other, in effect, competing for the same customers. The potential for <b>cannibalization</b> is often discussed when considering companies with many outlets in an area, such as Starbucks or McDonald's.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Cannibalization</b> is a {{necessary}} evil in lot of cases. As sales plateau and decline only to stabilize at a lower amount, {{it is important for}} business to innovate and experiment in order to create something new and cutting edge to maintain market share. Strategic development is important for business and integral for moving forward. Nitin Pangarkar said it is very important for businesses to maximize competitiveness with business strategy and <b>cannibalization</b> is part of this (Pangarkar, 2015). <b>Cannibalization</b> of markets is competing with others success and self-cannibalization is competing with yourself. As Steve Jobs said when he released the iPhone [...] "If you don't cannibalize yourself, someone else will" [...] (Isaacson, 2011). Even though there are dangers with <b>cannibalization</b> it has been very successful at pushing business innovation forward and identifying stagnant areas of a business.|$|E
5000|$|Also, most ebb {{and flow}} systems use a {{recycling}} reservoir to flood the table. Over {{a period of time}} the pH of the nutrient solution may fluctuate to a range which is unhealthy for the plant. If the pH is not corrected, various problems may occur, including but not limited to poor nutrient absorption and leaf <b>cannibalization.</b> As the name implies, leaf <b>cannibalization</b> occurs as the plant takes nutrients from one part of the plant and uses those nutrients in {{a different part of the}} plant. Leaf <b>cannibalization</b> appears as yellow or brown spots on leaves.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cannibalization</b> {{is usually}} due to {{unavailability}} of spare parts, {{due to an}} emergency, long resupply times, physical distance, or insufficient planning or budget. <b>Cannibalization</b> can also be due to surplus inventory. At the end of World War II a large quantity ol of high quality, but unusable war surplus equipment such as radar devices made a ready source of parts to build radio equipment.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{example of}} <b>cannibalization</b> {{occurs when a}} {{retailer}} discounts a particular product. The tendency of consumers is to buy the discounted product rather than competing products with higher prices. When the promotion event is over and prices return to normal, however, the effect will tend to disappear. This temporary change in consumer behavior {{can be described as}} <b>cannibalization,</b> though scholars do not normally use the phrase [...] "cannibalization" [...] to denote such a phenomenon.|$|E

50|$|In {{marketing}} strategy, <b>cannibalization</b> {{refers to}} a reduction in sales volume, sales revenue, or market share of one product {{as a result of the}} introduction of a new product by the same producer.|$|E
5000|$|Unserviceable {{military}} aircraft are also sold as [...] "knock-downs" [...] {{after they have}} ended their service life, packaging them with serviceable aircraft. This allows them {{to be used for}} <b>cannibalization</b> of spare parts.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cannibalization</b> {{of fiction}} refers to adapting, {{borrowing}} or stealing plots, characters, themes or ideas from one story {{for use in}} another or from one medium to another, such as a film adaptation of a book.|$|E
50|$|While {{this may}} seem {{inherently}} negative, {{in the context of}} a carefully planned strategy, it can be effective, by ultimately growing the market, or better meeting consumer demands. <b>Cannibalization</b> is a key consideration in product portfolio analysis.|$|E
5000|$|When to launch: Factors such as {{potential}} <b>cannibalization</b> {{of the sales}} of a vendor's other products, any requirement for further improvement of the proposed new product, or unfavorable market conditions may operate to delay a product launch.|$|E
50|$|Jocasta is alluded in the Ultimate Marvel continuity. When the Wasp (Janet Pym) is {{a victim}} of the Blob's <b>cannibalization</b> during Magneto's {{worldwide}} devastation, Hank Pym has Wasp's body taken to the Jocasta Project, an encrypted file within the Triskelion.|$|E
5000|$|Distributors - face {{a complex}} {{environment}} that often includes thousands of individual SKUs with several different product lifecycles. Each distributor must account for {{factors such as}} channel conflict, cross-product <b>cannibalization,</b> and competitive actions. Revenue Management has proved useful to distributors in promotion analysis and negotiated contracts.|$|E
50|$|Market <b>cannibalization,</b> market cannibalism, or {{corporate}} cannibalism is {{the practice of}} slashing {{the price of a}} product or introducing a new product into a market of established product categories. If a company is practising market <b>cannibalization,</b> it is seen to be eating its own market and in so doing, hoping to get a bigger share of it. Concretely, it refers to the principle of a newly introduced product B eating up the market shares of an already established product A, both usually coming from the same company. In this case, both products belong to the same category of products. This occurrence can have either a positive or negative impact on the company’s bottom line, can be accidental or deliberate, in which case it is commonly called cannibalisation strategy.|$|E
5000|$|Channel-based {{challenges}} Most companies adopt a multi-channel {{strategy in}} order to take their products or services to their customers. Each channel- be it a store, online, mobile etc. needs to be tackled in a different way to ensure maximization of results. In addition to this channel, <b>cannibalization</b> should also not happen.|$|E
50|$|To cut {{development}} costs, many of {{the aircraft}} systems have been adopted from the Boeing 747-400, including the engines, avionics, flight deck, landing gear and other systems. Two former United Airlines Boeing 747-400 aircraft (Serial numbers 28715 & 28716) were acquired and taken to the Mojave Air & Space Port for <b>cannibalization.</b>|$|E
50|$|Several {{corporations}} {{source products}} from specialized contract manufacturers or contract packagers, {{which may or}} may not own their brands, because establishing their own production facilities would require substantial investments in equipment, human resources, and patents. Sourcing from a specialty company that has already made such investments and also has spare production capacity may be a viable alternative. If the two companies find that the market situation allows them to avoid or minimize direct competition and they are not stealing each other's market share (<b>cannibalization),</b> then the companies may reach an agreement whereby the specialty manufacturer supplies the goods to the other. The methods to reduce <b>cannibalization</b> are general marketing practices such as dedicated distribution channels, different image and customer perception of the brands, pricing, and separate regional presences. The same basic concepts apply to the service industry (e.g., customer services helplines).|$|E
5000|$|Multiple {{methods of}} sexual {{approaches}} have evolved in cannibalistic species {{as a result}} of sexual cannibalism.

50|$|Producers that {{pursue this}} {{strategy}} {{believe that the}} additional sales revenue it creates more than offsets the additional costs {{of research and development}} and opportunity costs of existing product line <b>cannibalization.</b> In a competitive industry, this is a risky strategy because when consumers catch on to this, they may decide to buy from competitors instead.|$|E
50|$|One form of {{internal}} redeployment is <b>cannibalization</b> of usable spare parts from one asset to another. For example, a taxicab company has two non-running cabs with different non-working parts in each. By taking a working part from one non-running cab and {{placing it in}} the other, the company has reduced its number of non-running cabs by 50%.|$|E
