2500|$|<b>Clamp</b> <b>meters</b> <b>clamp</b> {{around a}} {{conductor}} carrying a current to measure {{without the need}} to connect the meter in series with the circuit, or make metallic contact at all. Those for AC measurement [...] use the transformer principle; clamp-on meters to measure small current or direct current require more exotic sensors.|$|R
50|$|A {{relatively}} recent development was a multi-conductor <b>clamp</b> <b>meter</b> with several sensor coils around {{the jaws of}} the clamp. This could be clamped around standard two- or three-conductor single-phase cables to provide a readout of the current flowing through the load, with no need to separate the conductors.|$|E
5000|$|Other current probes use Hall effect {{sensors to}} measure the {{magnetic}} field around a wire produced by an electric current through the wire without the need to interrupt the circuit to fit the probe. They are available for both voltmeters and oscilloscopes. Most current probes are self-contained, drawing power from a battery or the instrument, but a few {{require the use of}} an external amplifier unit. (See also: <b>Clamp</b> <b>meter)</b> ...|$|E
50|$|The PV Analyzer PVA-1000 is an I-V curve tracer. It {{generates a}} {{variable}} load {{applied to a}} PV module or string of PV modules. It sweeps the load from open circuit to short circuit in approximately 250ms, capturing the current and voltage at 500 points. The PVA simultaneously measures the irradiance and module temperature with the SolSensor Wireless PV Reference Sensor. The wireless sensor has a range of 300 feet. The PVA-1000 measures strings up to 1000 Volts and 30 Amps. It is used primarily for commissioning and troubleshooting PV systems because {{of its ability to}} identify problems in the health of a PV string that cannot otherwise be seen with a voltmeter or current <b>clamp</b> <b>meter.</b>|$|E
50|$|Fluke's {{complete}} {{test and}} measurement line now includes digital multimeters, <b>clamp</b> <b>meters,</b> electrical testers, power quality analyzers, thermal imagers, insulation resistance testers, portable oscilloscopes, earth ground testers, infrared and contact thermometers, air quality meters, and vibration testers.|$|R
50|$|Resembling {{a current}} clamp in {{appearance}} and function is the Rogowski coil current sensor. This coreless transformer {{is used in}} <b>clamp</b> <b>meters</b> and power monitoring loggers. It {{has the advantage of}} better linearity, having no core to saturate, it can be made flexible, and does not require any magnetic or electrical contact at the opening end. The Rogowski coil gives a voltage proportional to the rate of change of current in the primary cable, so more signal processing is needed before the sensed values can be displayed.|$|R
50|$|The stabistor (also {{called a}} forward {{reference}} diode) is the technical {{term used to}} designate a special type of semiconductor silicon diode featuring extremely stable forward voltage characteristics. These devices are specially designed for low-voltage stabilization applications requiring a guaranteed voltage over a wide current range and highly stable over temperature. In these applications, stabistors offer improved dynamic impedance (voltage change vs. current) than low voltage zener diodes where tunneling instead of avalanche current is dominant. Other typical applications include bias stabilization in class-AB output stages, clipping, <b>clamping,</b> <b>meter</b> protection, etc.|$|R
50|$|A <b>clamp</b> <b>meter</b> {{measures}} the vector {{sum of the}} currents flowing in all the conductors passing through the probe, which depends on the phase relationship of the currents. Only one conductor is normally passed through the probe. In particular if the clamp is closed around a two-conductor cable carrying power to equipment, the same current flows down one conductor and up the other; the meter correctly reads a net current of zero. As electrical cables for equipment have both insulated conductors (and possibly an earth wire) bonded together, clamp meters are often used with what is essentially a short extension cord with the two conductors separated, so that the clamp can be placed around only one conductor of this extension.|$|E

This device consists of sensor, processor, display and network. The sensor consists of current transformer and AC to AC Power Adapter. The processor is Arduino UNO which process sensor output. Liquid crystal device (LCD) is used to display real time output.

40|$|Based on the {{findings}} of test runs conducted 4 Q 13 using the price agent described in [1] as well as discussions with Oestkraft, Energinet, and IBM internally, our implementation of the direct-price agent has been updated as described in detail in [2]. Several test runs have been conducted where an initial set of 15 houses have been controlled. This document provides some results with regard to the demand response obtained from above mentioned test group. Where available, <b>clamp</b> <b>meter</b> readings have been considered (5 houses). If no clamp reader data is available, SmartMeter data was used (10 houses). ...|$|E
5000|$|Less-expensive <b>clamp</b> <b>meters</b> use a {{rectifier}} circuit which actually reads mean current, but is calibrated {{to display the}} RMS current corresponding to the measured mean, giving a correct RMS reading only if the current is a sine wave. For other waveforms readings will be incorrect; when these simpler meters are used with non-sinusoidal loads such as the ballasts used with fluorescent lamps or high-intensity discharge lamps or most modern computer and electronic equipment, readings can be quite inaccurate. Meters which respond to true RMS rather than mean current are described as [...] "true RMS".|$|R
50|$|In {{electrical}} and electronic engineering, a current clamp or current probe is an electrical device with jaws which open to allow clamping around an electrical conductor. This allows {{measurement of the}} current in a conductor without {{the need to make}} physical contact with it, or to disconnect it for insertion through the probe. Current clamps are typically used to read the magnitude of alternating current (AC) and, with additional instrumentation, the phase and waveform can also be measured. Some <b>clamps</b> <b>meters</b> can measure currents of 1000 A and more. Hall effect and vane type clamps can also measure direct current (DC).|$|R
5000|$|Shunts {{are rated}} by maximum current and voltage drop at that current. For example, a 500 A, 75 mV shunt {{would have a}} {{resistance}} of 0.15 milliohms, a maximum allowable current of 500 amps and at that current the voltage drop would be 75 millivolts. By convention, most shunts are designed to drop 50 mV, 75 mV or 100 mV when operating at their full rated current and most ammeters consist of a shunt and a voltmeter with full-scale deflections of 50, 75, or 100 mV. All shunts have a derating factor for continuous use, 66% being the most common. Continuous use is a run time of 2+ minutes, {{at which point the}} derating factor must be applied. There are thermal limits where a shunt will no longer operate correctly. At 80 °C thermal drift begins to occur, at 120 °C thermal drift is a significant problem where error, depending on the design of the shunt, can be several percent and at 140 °C the manganin alloy becomes permanently damaged due to annealing resulting in the resistance value drifting up or down. [...] If the current being measured is also at a high voltage potential this voltage will be present in the connecting leads too and in the reading instrument itself. Sometimes, the shunt is inserted in the return leg (grounded side) to avoid this problem. Some alternatives to shunts can provide isolation from the high voltage by not directly connecting the meter to the high voltage circuit. Examples of devices that can provide this isolation are Hall effect current sensors and current transformers (see <b>clamp</b> <b>meters).</b> Current shunts are considered more accurate and cheaper than Hall effect devices. Common accuracy of such devices are ±0.1% & 0.25% and 0.5%.|$|R
40|$|A {{measurement}} technique to calibrate current clamp meters in ac current {{in the measurement}} range from 100 to 1500 A at 50 Hz has been developed at the National Institute of Metrological Research (INRIM) {{in addition to the}} primary reference measurement systems for ac current calibrations at INRIM. This technique is traceable to the national standards of dc resistance, dc voltage, and ac current ratio. It is based on a standard current transformer (CT), on a 50 -mΩ standard shunt, and on a 61 / 2 -digit digital voltmeter (DVM) that measures the voltage on the standard shunt inserted in a conductor, to which also the <b>clamp</b> <b>meter</b> is applied, whose current is supplied by a CT that can generate currents up to 1500 A. The CT is controlled by a variable transformer. The <b>clamp</b> <b>meter</b> is applied to a copper wire and placed on a tilting support simulating the actual operating mode of the meter. This {{measurement technique}} is applicable in industrial metrological laboratories and is an alternative to measurement practices of accredited secondary laboratories 1 involving digital calibrators and turn current coils. This measurement technique was also tested utilizing an 81 / 2 -digit high-accuracy DVM. The results of the evaluation are presented and discussed. The expanded (k = 2) uncertainties of the technique span from 1. 0 × 10 − 2 at 100 A to 2. 0 × 10 − 3 at 1500 A...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of the implementation, programming and control of a robotic arm for fusion welding applications at Universidad San Francisco de Quito. The robotic arm is capable of automatically make welding seams following the specifications given by the user. The {{ultimate goal is to}} engage and implement the robotic arm Scorbot ER 9 Pro of the Robotics and Manufacturing Laboratory at Universidad San Francisco de Quito to perform welds using the GMAW process. The project was divided into two stages. Firstly, the coupling and system implementation were achieved for the robot to be able to perform the welding process. Once the robot was ready to work, research was carried out to achieve the optimal settings to ensure the quality of the weld. The research used various techniques to obtain experimental data, such as temperature measurement using thermocouples, measuring arc voltage and current with <b>clamp</b> <b>meters</b> and multimeters, and microscopy for metallographic analysis from samples.

40|$|The Wawashang Complex on the East Coast of Nicaragua is {{a typical}} example of remote rural area that can benefit from {{off-grid}} renewable energy solutions. In this Complex, the non-profit organization FADCANIC supports {{the development of the}} communities of the Caribbean Coast through an innovative agro-forestry program, a school, a carpentry workshop as well as a natural reserve. No power grid reaches the Complex, but many buildings are electrified by dislocated systems of photovoltaic modules and batteries with gasoline generators as backup. FADCANIC is trying to exploit better the natural resources in order to provide power for more initiatives and make energy supply less expensive, more reliable and sustainable. In February 2013 a trip to Wawashang was made to collect the necessary data. Purpose of this thesis is to propose a micro hydropower installation in State Creek, the river flowing through the Complex. The hydropower potential was measured by inexpensive tools, i. e. a wooden folding ruler and a borrowed current meter. The Creek offers a site with a low head of 3 to 5 m over a distance of 200 m and a good water flow of 100 - 200 l/s {{at the beginning of the}} dry season. The power obtained could benefit either a farmer's house by the river, a coconut grinder or support the photovoltaic energy of the Complex, whenever solar irradiation is too low. A discussion will follow about the turbines to be used in such low head systems, in a power range between 0. 2 and 3 kW. A 1 kW turbine will be chosen for two alternative waterway preliminary designs, one of which using pipes and the other a wooden channel. Such solution appears satisfactory as it can deliver power to the coconut grinder during the day and electrify the farmer's house at night. Moreover, this plan makes it possible to measure and analyze the Wawashang buildings power consumption. The measurement, taken by the use of <b>clamping</b> current <b>meters,</b> has shown a peak power demand of about 17 kW, due to the higher power requirement for the carpentry workshop. An analysis of the energy resources, also part of this work, reveals that, besides solar energy and low head micro hydropower generation in State Creek, biomasses could be an interesting option for power generation in the future. Particularly, coconut husks and shells, sugar cane, excrements and waste wood may be considered as an important resource for the production of energy within the Wawashang Complex. </p...|$|R
