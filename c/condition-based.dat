A Sagem-built ICDS-8A glass cockpit suite is an integrated part of the SH09's standard avionics and instrumentation package. The rotorcraft has been designed with a <b>condition-based</b> maintenance policy, specifying {{that there should be no}} time between overhaul (TBO) limits on its various components and systems, including the engine; instead, maintenance is performed based upon condition, which is continuously monitored at all times by an onboard health and usage monitoring system (HUMS). Ease of maintenance and access to systems was an active consideration during the design phase, aiming to deliver lower overall maintenance costs.|$|E

50|$|<b>Condition-based</b> {{maintenance}} (CBM), shortly described, is maintenance when need arises. This {{maintenance is}} performed after {{one or more}} indicators show that equipment is going to fail or that equipment performance is deteriorating.|$|E
50|$|Along with <b>condition-based</b> {{maintenance}}, {{planned maintenance}} comprises preventive maintenance, {{in which the}} maintenance event is preplanned, and all future maintenance is preprogrammed. Planned maintenance is created for every item separately according to manufacturers recommendation or legislation. Plans can be date-based, based on equipment running hours, or on the distance travelled by the vehicle. A good example of a planned maintenance program is car maintenance, where time and distance determine fluid change requirements. A good example of <b>condition-based</b> maintenance is the {{oil pressure warning light}} that provides notification that you should stop the vehicle because engine lubrication has stopped and failure will occur.|$|E
50|$|Systems with {{spare parts}} that are {{energized}} but that lack automatic fault bypass are not actually redundant because human action {{is required to}} restore operation after every failure. This depends upon <b>Condition-based</b> maintenance and Planned Maintenance System support.|$|E
50|$|<b>Condition-based</b> {{maintenance}} {{was introduced}} to try to maintain the correct equipment at the right time. CBM is based on using real-time data to prioritize and optimize maintenance resources. Observing {{the state of the}} system is known as condition monitoring. Such a system will determine the equipment's health, and act only when maintenance is actually necessary. Developments in recent years have allowed extensive instrumentation of equipment, and together with better tools for analyzing condition data, the maintenance personnel of today are more than ever able to decide what is the right time to perform maintenance on some piece of equipment. Ideally <b>condition-based</b> maintenance will allow the maintenance personnel to do only the right things, minimizing spare parts cost, system downtime and time spent on maintenance.|$|E
50|$|The typical Trojan is condition-based: It is {{triggered}} by sensors, internal logic states, a particular input pattern or an internal counter value. <b>Condition-based</b> Trojans are detectable with power traces {{to some degree}} when inactive. That {{is due to the}} leakage currents generated by the trigger or counter circuit activating the Trojan.|$|E
50|$|In {{this context}} combinational Trojans and {{sequential}} Trojans are distinguished. A combinational Trojan monitors internal signals until a specific condition happens. A sequential Trojan {{is also an}} internally activated <b>condition-based</b> circuit, but it monitors the internal signals and searches for sequences not for a specific state or condition like the combinational Trojans do.|$|E

50|$|As {{with any}} capital asset, {{manufacturers}} typically include the standard maintenance practices and procedures {{needed to keep}} the asset functioning properly and within design specifications.

5000|$|This {{differs from}} <b>Condition-based</b> maintenance(CBM) where the part is {{replaced}} {{once it has}} failed or once a threshold is passed. [...] This often involves taking the vehicle out of service with at an inconvenient time when it could be generating revenue. It is preferable to use an IVHM approach to replace it at the most convenient time. This allows the reduction in waste component life caused by replacing the part too early and also reducing cost incurred by unscheduled maintenance. This is possible due to the increased prognostic distance provided by an IVHM solution. There are many technologies {{that are used in}} IVHM. The field itself is still growing and many techniques are still being added to the body of knowledge.|$|E
50|$|A unique {{geological}} {{feature of}} Battle Mountain {{is that the}} western slope outcrops are composed entirely of alkalai feldspar granite, while the eastern slope {{up to and including}} the summit is entirely rhyolitic. This provides strong evidence of a theorized lateral explosive eruption event centered on the eastern slope at approximately 704 Ma as proposed by Woolman (2016). Further mathematical geology evidence which supports this theory includes a paleaogeographic reconstruction of the mountain by Woolman utilizing artificial neural networks and Markov chain geostatistical models including period climate <b>condition-based</b> soil erosion rates, Kirkby's hillslope movement evolution equations and recursive biogeochemical soil erosion rates in felsic granitic conditions. The result was the digital reconstruction image shown on the left, indicating what Battle Mountain may have looked like 704 million years ago on the western slope.|$|E
5000|$|Prognostics is an {{engineering}} discipline focused on predicting {{the time at}} which a system or a component [...] will no longer perform its intended function. This lack of performance is most often a failure beyond which the system {{can no longer be}} used to meet desired performance. The predicted time then becomes the remaining useful life (RUL), which is an important concept in decision making for contingency mitigation. Prognostics predicts the future performance of a component by assessing the extent of deviation or degradation of a system from its expected normal operating conditions. The science of prognostics is based on the analysis of failure modes, detection of early signs of wear and aging, and fault conditions. An effective prognostics solution is implemented when there is sound knowledge of the failure mechanisms that are likely to cause the degradations leading to eventual failures in the system. It is therefore necessary to have initial information on the possible failures (including the site, mode, cause and mechanism) in a product. Such knowledge is important to identify the system parameters that are to be monitored. Potential uses for prognostics is in <b>condition-based</b> maintenance. The discipline that links studies of failure mechanisms to system lifecycle management {{is often referred to as}} prognostics and health management (PHM), sometimes also system health management (SHM) or—in transportation applications—vehicle health management (VHM) or engine health management (EHM). Technical approaches to building models in prognostics can be categorized broadly into data-driven approaches, model-based approaches, and hybrid approaches.|$|E
