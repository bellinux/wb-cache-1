Lack of overview of sub-menus and menu items is a problem for marking menus and a solution <b>called</b> <b>browse</b> menus is proposed. The browse menus gives a preview of the next sub-menu or item before a selection is made and speeds up selection. Different ways of selecting sub-menus and commands were investigated and a combination of release button and exceed border were found to be the most efficient selection technique for both beginners and experts. The results conclude that marking menus with eight sectors, nested three levels deep is a promising alternative for complex haptic applications...|$|R

40|$|In brick-and mortar {{stores and}} paper catalogs, the experiential, {{non-directed}} consumer activity <b>called</b> <b>browsing</b> can expose a prospective buyer {{to hundreds of}} images, scents, and sounds {{in the space of}} seconds. On the World-Wide Web, however, the browser’s experience is attenuated, not only by the limited number of items represented at a given time on a given page, but by the number of arbitrary decisions that are often required to navigate to that page. The High-Density Online Catalog (HDOC) is a singlepage, interactive visualization derived from parallel coordinate plots and intended for browsing many items with common attributes. A fully populated HDOC immediately communicates its depth and breadth, and engages the user to dip freely into its contents.

30|$|Cellular network {{forensics}} is a cross-discipline {{of digital}} forensics and cellular networks {{with the goal}} to investigate cellular network-facilitated crimes under a legally obtained warrant {{for the purpose of}} crime reconstruction. These criminal activities can be carried out with a direct network support (e.g., perpetrators communicate over a cellular network) or network is incidental to the crime (e.g., the network can provide historical data about calls or user locations). The investigations in cellular network can be in real time and non-real-time. The real-time investigations work with evidence transiting over the network {{at the time of the}} crime or the attack like ongoing <b>calls,</b> <b>browsing</b> sessions, or triangulated geolocation coordinates of a user. The non-real-time investigations work with evidence in relation to past user activity such as charging data records or user’s most visited cell. Prior to every investigation, operators and law enforcement agencies (LEAs) must establish forensic readiness to ensure secure identification, acquisition, and delivery of cellular network evidence [3, 4]. These operations are realized with two forensics mechanisms, Lawful Interception (LI) and Lawful Access Location Services (LALS).|$|R
40|$|Metadata that {{describe}} characteristics of geographic datasets {{are used for}} discovering potential datasets and evaluating their suitability for intended purposes (Guptil 1999, Taylor 2004). Discovery is based on search functions relying on metadata about thematic, spatial, and temporal extents of datasets (Beard and Sharma, 1997) and well developed in directories, clearing houses, and digital libraries. Tools for evaluating datasets by metadata are far less developed. For example, means for comparing closely similar datasets are limited to studying the metadata document of each dataset at a time. By visualization usability of metadata for evaluation could be increased. The ISO 19115 : 2003 metadata standard for geographic information defines a metadata element <b>called</b> <b>browse</b> graphic that it is to “illustrate the dataset ” but leaves it open what the illustration would be.

40|$|Nowadays mobile {{devices are}} used for various {{applications}} such as making voice/video <b>calls,</b> <b>browsing</b> the Internet, listening to music etc. The average battery consumption {{of each of these}} activities and the length of time a user spends on each one determines the battery lifetime of a mobile device. Previous methods have provided predictions of battery lifetime using a static battery consumption rate that does not consider user characteristics. This paper proposes an approach to predict a mobile device’s available battery lifetime based on usage patterns. Because every user has a different pattern of voice calls, data communication, and video call usage, we can use such usage patterns for personalized prediction of battery lifetime. Firstly, we define one or more states that affect battery consumption. Then, we record time-series log data related to battery consumption and the use time of each state. We calculate the average battery consumption rate for each state and determine the usage pattern based on the time-series data. Finally, we predict the available battery time based on the average battery consumption rate for each state and the usage pattern. We also present the experimental trials used to validate our approach in the real world...|$|R

30|$|As {{users of}} mobile devices make phone <b>calls,</b> <b>browse</b> the web, or use an app, {{large volumes of}} data are {{routinely}} generated that are a potentially useful source for investigating human behavior in space. However, as such data are usually collected only as a by-product, they often lack stringent experimental design and ground truth, which makes interpretation and derivation of valid behavioral conclusions challenging. Here, we propose an unsupervised, data-driven approach to identify different user types based on high-resolution human movement data collected from a smartphone navigation app, {{in the absence of}} ground truth. We capture spatio-temporal footprints of users, characterized by meaningful summary statistics, which are then used in an unsupervised step to identify user types. Based on an extensive dataset of users of the mobile navigation app Sygic in Australia, we show how the proposed methodology allows to identify two distinct groups of users: ‘travelers’, visiting different areas with distinct, salient characteristics, and ‘locals’, covering shorter distances and revisiting many of their locations. We verify our approach by relating user types to space use: we find that travelers and locals prefer to visit distinct, different locations in the Australian cities Sydney and Melbourne, as suggested independently by other studies. Although we use high-resolution GPS data, the proposed methodology is potentially transferable to low-resolution movement data (e.g. Call Detail Records), since we rely only on summary statistics.|$|R

Ten users revisited web pages after a few minutes and other web pages after one to six days using both Netscape with Browsing Icons and Netscape alone. With the tool they completed the short-term revisits in 84 % of the time required when using Netscape alone. The revisits after one to six days users could accomplish in 57. 8 % of the time they needed when using Netscape, thereby visiting only 53. 8 % as many pages.

The potential for enhancement of forage utilization of two high tannin containing tropical browse trees and three legumes {{through the use of a}} digestive modifier <b>called</b> <b>Browse</b> Plus was investigated in this study. The study was carried out in 1995. The main objective of the study was to evaluate the potential for improving digestibilities of dry matter (DM) and crude protein (CP) of two browse tree species, namely; Acacia albida and Colophospermum mopane and three herbaceous legumes, namely; Chamaecrista rotundifolia, Stylosanthes scabra, and Stylosanthes guif/iensis by use of Browse Plus. The legumes were sampled at three’phases of growth in 1994, making a total of nine samples. Forages were obtained from Sanyati, a semi-arid area of Zimbabwe. Total tannin levels in the forage samples were determined using the radial diffusion technique and in WvoDM and CP digestibilities were determined using the mobile nylon bag technique following infusion of 0 - 3 g of Browse Plus Into rumens of each of the three cannulated Holstein steers that were used. Ruminal infusion of Browse Plus enhanced (P 0. 05) between total tannin level, DM and/or CP digestibilities. The results from this study indicated that Browse Plus can improve DM and CP digestibilities of forages containing high tannin levels. This is likely to increase nutrient availability at the level of the small intestines, thereby enhancing utilization of such forages by ruminants. From the results, we recommend that Browse Plus be utilized at an inclusion rate of 2 g per animal per day in order to realize benefits from improved utilization of forages high in tannins...|$|R

40|$|Conventional {{hierarchical}} {{organizations are}} inadequate in managing publications which are inherently multi-dimensional. The rigid hierarchical organization limits a user {{to a small}} number of navigable paths, and ambiguities arise on the preferred location of an object.

40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} {{a new approach}} to managing large image databases which we <b>call</b> active <b>browsing.</b> Active browsing integrates relevance feedback into the browsing environment, so that users can modify the database's organization to suit the desired task. Our method is based on a similarity pyramid data structure which hierarchically organizes the database {{so that it can be}} e#ciently browsed. At coarse levels, the similarity pyramid allows users to view the database as large clusters of similar images. Alternatively, users can "zoom into" finer levels to view individual images. We discuss relevance feedback for the browsing process, and argue that it is fundamentally di#erent from relevance feedback for more traditional search-by-query tasks. We propose two fundamental operations for active browsing: pruning and reorganization. Both of these operation depend on a user defined relevance set which represents the image or set of images desired by the user. We present statistical m [...] ...|$|R
