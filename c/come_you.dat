500|$|... 1924 – [...] "How <b>Come</b> <b>You</b> Do Me Like You Do?" [...] {{is a song}} by {{vaudeville}} duo Gene Austin and Roy Bergere. It {{became popular}} in 1924 with the recordings of blues singers Rosa Henderson and Viola McCoy. Marion Harris recorded a hit version in 1924. The song enjoyed a revival in 1954 after Bill Krenz's recording.|$|E
500|$|This {{appearance}} of the comet is also noted in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. Eilmer of Malmesbury may have seen Halley previously in 989, as he wrote of it in 1066: [...] "You've come, have you?... You've <b>come,</b> <b>you</b> source of tears to many mothers, you evil. I hate you! It is long since I saw you; but as I see you now you are much more terrible, for I see you brandishing the downfall of my country. I hate you!" ...|$|E

Not the slightest trace {{was left in}} her face of the terror that had convulsed it barely a minute since! [...] "How <b>came</b> <b>you</b> by this?" [...] she repeated, seizing me {{by the arm and}} shaking me, in the ungovernable impatience that possessed her.|$|R
500|$|In 1905, in {{an essay}} titled [...] "If Whitman had been an Architect", Holden made an {{anonymous}} plea to architects for {{a new form of}} modern architecture: [...] "Often I hear of the glory of the architecture of ancient Greece; of the proud Romans; of sombre Egypt; the praise of vast Byzantium and the lofty Middle Ages, too, I hear. But of the glory of the architecture of the Modern I never hear. <b>Come,</b> <b>you</b> Modern Buildings, come! Throw off your mantle of deceits; your cornices, pilasters, mouldings, swags, scrolls; behind them all, behind your dignified proportions, your picturesque groupings, your arts and crafts prettinesses and exaggerated techniques; behind and beyond them all hides the one I love." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the closing}} chorale, [...] "" [...] (Amen, amen! <b>Come,</b> <b>you</b> fair crown of joy), Bach sets the Abgesang {{only of the}} final stanza of Nicolai's hymn. The musicologist Julian Mincham offers the thought: [...] "Conceivably the most convincing {{explanation}} lies, as it so often does, within the text– ... do not delay, I await You longingly. The hymn tune itself, through its very abbreviation implies {{a sense of urgency}} and the feeling of being unable to defer any longer." [...] In Bach's setting, the violin adds a jubilant fifth part to the four vocal parts. The violin has to [...] "climb three octaves to convey the extent of the soul's longing for the joys of a future life and the prospect of Jesus returning at the end of time".|$|E
500|$|Before the 1966 season began, Koufax and Drysdale met {{separately}} with Dodger GM Buzzie Bavasi {{to negotiate}} their contracts {{for the upcoming}} year. After Koufax's meeting, he met Drysdale for dinner and complained that Bavasi was using Drysdale against him in the negotiations, asking, [...] "How <b>come</b> <b>you</b> want that much when Drysdale only wants this much?" [...] Drysdale responded that Bavasi {{did the same thing}} with him, using Koufax against him. Drysdale's first wife, Ginger Drysdale, suggested that they negotiate together to get what they wanted. They demanded $1 million ($ today), divided equally over the next three years, or $167,000 ($ today) each for each of the next three seasons. Both players were represented by an entertainment lawyer, J. William Hayes, which was unusual during an era when players were not represented by agents. At the time, Willie Mays was Major League Baseball's highest paid player at $125,000 ($ today) per year and multi-year contracts were very unusual.|$|E

500|$|The {{painting}} {{depicts a}} scene from Summer in which the young Damon sits thinking by a stream on a hot summer's day. The beautiful Musidora strips naked to cool down by bathing in the stream, not knowing that Damon can see her. Damon is torn between his desire to watch her and the [...] "delicate refinement" [...] of knowing he should avert his gaze. Damon decides to respect her modesty and leaves {{a note on the}} riverbank reading [...] "Bathe on, my fair,/ Yet unbeheld save by the sacred eye/ Of faithful love: I go to guard thy haunt;/ To keep from thy recess each vagrant foot/ And each licentious eye". Musidora sees the paper and panics, but on reading it and realising that it has been written by Damon, feels admiration for his behaviour as well as a surge of pride that her own beauty can provoke such a reaction. She leaves him a note in turn, reading [...] "Dear youth! sole judge of what these verses mean,/ By fortune too much favoured, but by love,/ Alas! not favoured less, be still as now/ Discreet: the time may <b>come</b> <b>you</b> need not fly." ...|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. Melinda Newman of HitFix {{said it was}} [...] "a bit snoozy", however complemented Twain's reasonably strong vocals. Newman added, [...] "She’s not pushing or belting in any way, but she’s upfront and center. However, her delivery is hardly the peppy rallying call that the lyrics call for and if a song ever demanded to be uptempo, this would be it." [...] Sean Daly of the St. Petersburg Times called the song [...] "a shocking stinkeroo every which way." [...] Daly criticized Twain's vocal delivery, noting she sounded as though she sang through {{the side of her}} mouth much like James Cagney, and said the track reinforced the skeptics who insisted Lange was the reason for Twain's success. He concluded, [...] "If 'Today Is Your Day' is a sign of things to <b>come,</b> <b>you</b> might want to hold your breath on that comeback." [...] Jenna Hally Rubenstein of MTV was disappointed with [...] "Today Is Your Day", but said she would [...] "take it" [...] following the singer's long absence from music. Rubenstein commented that the song was undoubtedly saccharine, yet Twain's lush and rich voice prevailed.|$|E
500|$|Annemarie Roelofs {{recalled}} that {{critics of the}} Feminist Improvising Group were always either very positive, or very negative; {{there was never any}} middle-ground. Nicols and Roelofs said they received little support from male improvisers, who criticised their technical ability and referred to them as women, not musicians. FIG's message that [...] "anyone can do it" [...] antagonised many who value [...] "technical virtuosity" [...] and [...] "improvisational competence". Nicols said they also complained about FIG's [...] "irreverent approach to technique and tradition", while Smith suggested that they may have felt threatened by the [...] "spectacle of so many unsupervised and unpredictable women on the stage". Irène Schweizer {{recalled that}} FIG were invited to perform at the Total Music Meeting in Berlin in November 1979 because she had played at the festival before (in all-men groups). But after seeing FIG perform, the organiser asked Schweizer [...] "how <b>come</b> <b>you</b> brought such a group, they can't play, and they are not good enough." [...] Nicols said that avant-garde musician Alexander von Schlippenbach also complained about FIG being there, saying that [...] "we couldn't play our instruments" [...] and that he could have found [...] "loads of men that would have played a lot better".|$|E

500|$|... "Lucky Day" [...] is a pop song {{featuring}} {{an upbeat}} rhythm and synths. The song has gathered comparisons to the Katy Perry song [...] "Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)" [...] (2010) and music by David Guetta for its dance themes. In the introduction Roberts sings [...] "Could it be my lucky day?"; the track continues with [...] "Just light the first spark, {{and watch the}} fireworks explode. Boom, Boom, Baby", {{in what has been}} described by Robert Copsey of Digital Spy as a [...] "60s-swing-meets-East-London vibe". Roberts' voice has been described by Katherine St Asaph of Pop Dust as a [...] "springy" [...] vibrato, with breathy background vocals featuring sounds effect including repeated kissing noises. Roberts sings about falling in love with someone, as she sings: [...] "Aah, say that you love me, say that you need me too... best you ever had. It could be so easy, for you to please me, baby. So how <b>come</b> <b>you</b> tease me?". Roberts discussed the track on her blog, commenting that its lyrical content alludes to a boy that initially does not share the same feelings as his partner, [...] "but in the end you win him over and it's your lucky day. You can take it however you want though, maybe you won on the scratch cards and so you had a lucky day, that kind of thing". Roberts described it as a [...] "romantic reference" [...] with a [...] "down-beat track underneath", and in contrast called the top-line of the track [...] "quite cute and girly". A remix of the song was producer by band White Lies, and debuted on The Guardian. The 90s-themed concept incorporates house music, with [...] "chunky" [...] beats and [...] "twinkly" [...] synths to the original instrumental of the song.|$|E

2500|$|The album's opening track, [...] "Piano & I", {{begins with}} a {{rendition}} of Ludwig van Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata, combined with a hip hop beat. The introduction is followed by [...] "Girlfriend", which was produced by Jermaine Dupri. Commended for its [...] "crisp production", the song samples Ol' Dirty Bastard's [...] "Brooklyn Zoo". Keys' cover of Prince's 1982 ballad [...] "How Come U Don't Call Me Anymore?" [...] (retitled [...] "How <b>Come</b> <b>You</b> Don't Call Me") {{was inspired by a}} long-term relationship with a partner. The music critic for PopMatters felt that the song was credible, but fell short from the original and Stephanie Mills's 1980s cover. [...] "Fallin'", the gospel-driven lead single and often considered Keys's signature song, contains a sample of James Brown's [...] "It's a Man's Man's Man's World".
