5|$|The {{compensation}} package {{led to the}} Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement (IRSSA), {{announced on}} May 8, 2006, and implemented in September 2007. At the time, there were about 86,000 living victims. The IRSSA included funding for the AHF, for commemoration, for health support, and for a Truth and Reconciliation program, {{as well as an}} individual <b>Common</b> <b>Experience</b> Payment (CEP). Any person who could be verified as having resided at a federally run Indian residential school in Canada was entitled to a CEP. The amount of compensation was {{based on the number of}} years a particular former student resided at the residential schools: $10,000 for the first year attended (from one night residing there to a full school year) plus $3,000 for every year thereafter.|$|E

25|$|The {{idea that}} patriarchy is natural has, however, {{come under attack}} from many sociologists, {{explaining}} that patriarchy evolved due to historical, rather than biological, conditions. In technologically simple societies, men's greater physical strength and women's <b>common</b> <b>experience</b> of pregnancy combined together to sustain patriarchy. Gradually, technological advances, especially industrial machinery, diminished the primacy of physical strength in everyday life. Similarly, contraception has given women control over their reproductive cycle.|$|E
25|$|The All-Palestine Government however lacked any {{significant}} authority {{and was in}} fact seated in Cairo. In 1959 it was officially merged into the United Arab Republic by the decree of Nasser, crippling any Palestinian hope for self governance. With the establishment in 1948 of the State of Israel, along with the migration of the Palestinian exodus, the <b>common</b> <b>experience</b> of the Palestinian refugee Arabs was mirrored in a fading of Palestinian identity. The institutions of a Palestinian nationality emerged slowly in the Palestinian refugee diaspora. In 1950 Yasser Arafat founded Ittihad Talabat Filastin. After the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, most of the Husseini clan relocated to Jordan and the Gulf States. Many family heads that remained in the Old City and the northern neighborhoods of East Jerusalem fled due to hostility with the Jordanian government, which controlled {{that part of the}} city; King Abdullah's assassin was a member of an underground Palestinian organization led by Daoud al-Husayni.|$|E

500|$|In 2000, Beck and his fiancée, stylist Leigh Limon, {{ended their}} nine-year relationship. Beck lapsed into {{a period of}} melancholy and introspection, during which he wrote the bleak, acoustic-based tracks later found on Sea Change. Beck sat on the songs, not wanting {{to talk about his}} {{personal}} life; he later said that he wanted to focus on music and [...] "not really strew my baggage across the public lobby". Eventually, however, he decided the songs spoke to a <b>common</b> <b>experience</b> (a relationship breakup), and that it would not seem self-indulgent to record them. In 2001, Beck drifted back to the songs and called producer Nigel Godrich.|$|E
500|$|Sgt. Pepper {{was widely}} {{perceived}} by listeners as the soundtrack to the [...] "Summer of Love". In Riley's opinion, the album [...] "drew people together through the <b>common</b> <b>experience</b> of pop {{on a larger}} scale than ever before". American radio stations interrupted their regular scheduling, playing the album virtually non-stop – often from start to finish. It occupied the number one position of the Billboard Top LPs in the US for 15 weeks, from 1 July to 13 October 1967. With 2.5 million copies sold within three months of its release, Sgt. Peppers initial commercial success exceeded that of all previous Beatles albums. None of its songs were issued as singles at the time.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{interaction}} of intrinsic and extrinsic incentives. We propose a simple principal-agent model with control that incorporates the existence of social groups resulting from <b>common</b> <b>experiences</b> in the past. Our laboratory experiment shows that agents with previous <b>common</b> <b>experiences</b> with their principals (CE agents) perform better than agents without such experiences (NCE agents). However, as soon as actual control exceeds their expectation, CE agents decrease their performance substantially, which has no equivalent for NCE agents. This pronounced decrease in effort when control is perceived as excessive represents a novel channel through which hidden costs of control materialize. Our results {{have important implications for}} firms' strategies to motivate employees...|$|R

The press came to refer to the three, who made numerous joint public appearances, as the [...] "Movement widows". Evers-Williams and King were frequent guests at Medgar Evers College, and Shabazz occasionally visited the King Center in Atlanta. Writing about Shabazz, Evers-Williams described her as a [...] "free spirit, in the best sense of the word. When she laughed, she had this beauty; when she smiled, it lit up the whole room." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} co-written by co-showrunners J.H. Wyman and Jeff Pinkner, and {{consulting}} producer Akiva Goldsman. Executive producer Joe Chappelle directed. Pinkner and Wyman approached the episode [...] "like a new pilot" [...] {{to draw in}} viewers who wanted to watch the show but did not know when to start. They used Lincoln Lee {{as a tool to}} acquaint viewers with the new changes. Former guest actor Seth Gabel, who played Lee, joined the cast as a series regular for the fourth season. He believed his character allowed the audience to see Fringe Division from a new perspective. He explained, [...] "You need a layman's perspective from time to time. The show has gotten so deep into this crazy, surreal scientific world that you need someone to enter every now and then to remind you this is not the <b>common</b> <b>experience.</b> You need someone to show you how far down the rabbit hole you’ve gone, so you don't become desensitized to it. I think Lincoln serves that for a while." ...|$|E
500|$|The work is {{an example}} of Lichtenstein's {{presentation}} of the uncertainty of the one-eyed perspective. It {{is considered to be a}} work on the subject of [...] "focal vision and blindness", and it is a prominent example of the theme running through Lichtenstein's art relating to vision. He uses the narrative to emphasize this theme, while playing on both the circular peephole and the circular eyes. The depicted mechanical device, a peephole in this case, forces the vision into a monocular format. Monocularity is funnelled through the primitive peephole apparatus that almost mimics a camera lens. In some senses, monocularity of this work is a strong theme that is directly embodied although only by allusion. In addition, the work is considered to be closely related to his later work, Image Duplicator (1963), which is regarded as a correction of I Can See the Whole Room! with its glaring and aggressive binocularity. The monocularity of I Can See the Whole Room! should be viewed as a concentrated form of monocularity, such as [...] "the <b>common</b> <b>experience</b> of closing one eye in order to fix an object in the gaze", but a subordinated form of monocularity that is enhanced by technology.|$|E
50|$|We are not {{sharing the}} {{personality}} of the poet. No, we share what is common to the poet and to us. We share his <b>common,</b> human <b>experience,</b> not his personality. There are two kinds of poetry: (1) poetry about <b>common</b> <b>experiences</b> that all people have, and (2) poetry about new and nameless sensations that enrich one, which he also sees in the prose of George MacDonald, and this suggests that it is not unique to poetry.|$|R

500|$|Leaving {{school without}} his family's knowledge, {{he made the}} {{decision}} to fight in the Civil War in August 1862. Despite his mixed-race ancestry, Pitman avoided the racial segregation imposed on other Native Hawaiian recruits of the time and enlisted in the 22nd Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry, a white regiment. He served as a private in the Union Army fighting in the Battle of Antietam and the Maryland Campaign. In his company, Private Robert G. Carter befriended the part-Hawaiian soldier and wrote in later life of their <b>common</b> <b>experience</b> in the 22nd Massachusetts. Compiled decades afterward from old letters, Carter's account described the details surrounding his final fate in the war. On the march to Fredericksburg, Pitman was separated from his regiment and captured by Confederate guerrilla forces. He was forced to march to Richmond and incarcerated in the Confederate Libby Prison, where he contracted [...] "lung fever" [...] from the harsh conditions of his imprisonment and died on February27, 1863, a few months after his release on parole in a prisoner exchange. Modern historians consider Henry Hoʻolulu Pitman to be the only known Hawaiian or Pacific Islander to die as a prisoner of war in the Civil War.|$|E
500|$|Riou took {{and passed}} his lieutenant's {{examination}} on 19 October 1780, {{shortly after the}} expedition's return to Britain, and received his promotion on 28 October.

Here Riou appears to have become ill, a <b>common</b> <b>experience</b> for naval officers serving in the tropics, but he survived to return to Britain and was discharged from his ship on 3 February 1782 and went into the Royal Naval Hospital at Haslar. He recovered his health and by April 1783 was back on active service, joining the Portsmouth guardship [...] Discharging from the Ganges in June 1784, he went on to half-pay, which lasted for two years until he received another appointment, this time to the 50-gun [...] in March 1786. The Salisbury was the flagship of Rear-Admiral John Elliot, who sailed to Newfoundland take up his post as Commodore-Governor there. During this period in his life, Riou was described by a seaman aboard the Ganges as 'a strict disciplinarian with a fanatical regard for cleanliness'. He was also noted to be a religious man, and an affectionate son and brother. A further period on half-pay followed his discharge from the Salisbury in November 1788, but meanwhile he had [...] succeeded in attracting the attention of the Townsend family, and was able to use their patronage to secure an appointment to command , in April 1789.|$|E

2500|$|The IRSSA offered former {{students}} blanket compensation through the <b>Common</b> <b>Experience</b> Payment (CEP) {{with an average}} lump-sum payment of $28,000. The CEP, {{a component of the}} Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement, totaling $1.9 billion, was [...] "part of an overall holistic and comprehensive response to the Indian residential school legacy." [...] Payments were higher for more serious cases of abuse. The CEP recognized [...] "the experience of living at an Indian Residential School(s) and its impacts. All {{former students}} who resided at a recognized Indian Residential School(s) and were alive on May 30, 2005 were eligible for the CEP. This include First Nations, Métis, and Inuit former students." [...] This initial payment for each person who attended a residential school amounted to $10,000 per person plus $3,000 per year. The application deadline for CEP was 19 September 2011 with some exceptions made until September 19, 2012. By 31 December 2012, [...] "a total of 105,540 applications were received under the <b>common</b> <b>experience</b> payment. $1.62 billion was paid to [...] "78,750 recipients, representing 98% of the 80,000 estimated eligible former students." ...|$|E
