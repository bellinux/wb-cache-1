25|$|In 1986, the Kodak Microelectronics Technology Division {{developed}} a 1.3 MP CCD image sensor, the first {{with more than}} 1 million pixels. In 1987, this sensor was integrated with a Canon F-1 film SLR body at the Kodak Federal Systems Division to create the first DSLR camera. The digital back monitored the <b>camera</b> <b>body</b> battery current to sync the image sensor exposure to the film body shutter. Digital images were stored on a tethered hard drive and processed for histogram feedback to the user. This first camera was created for the U.S. Government, and was followed by several other models intended for government use, and eventually the first commercial DSLR, launched by Kodak in 1991.|$|E
25|$|Some {{distance}} scales have markings {{for only}} a few distances; for example, the 35mm lens above shows only 3ft and 5ft on its upper scale. Using other distances for DOF limits requires visual interpolation between marked distances. Since the distance scale is nonlinear, accurate interpolation can be difficult. In most cases, English and metric distance markings are not coincident, so using both scales to note focused distances can sometimes lessen the need for interpolation. Many autofocus lenses have smaller distance and DOF scales and fewer markings than do comparable manual-focus lenses, so that determining focus and f-number from the scales on an autofocus lens may be more difficult than with a comparable manual-focus lens. In most cases, determining these settings using the lens DOF scales on an autofocus lens requires that the lens or <b>camera</b> <b>body</b> be set to manual focus.-number from user-determined near and far points in much the same manner as using DOF scales on manual-focus lenses (Canon Inc. 2000, 61–62). The feature has not been included on models introduced after April 2004.|$|E
500|$|This {{cooperative}} venture was established, largely at the instigation of George Lucas, {{to serve}} his designs for the Star Wars prequels. The collaboration resulted in the Sony HDW-F900 CineAlta HDCAM high definition video camera. Sony produced the electronics and a stand-alone version of the camera; Panavision supplied custom-designed high definition lenses, trademarked Primo Digital, and retrofitted the <b>camera</b> <b>body</b> to incorporate standard film camera accessories, facilitating the equipment's integration into existing crew equipment as a [...] "digital cinema camera". This Panavision HD-900F, {{was used in the}} making of Lucasfilm's [...] (2002), described as [...] "the first digital major feature film". Panavision's next step in the evolution of digital cinema cameras also involved collaboration between Sony and Panavision; this time, Panavision participated in all the stages of development. The aim was to create a system that could use the entire range of the company's 35mm spherical lenses.|$|E

500|$|From 2005 to 2007, Cameron {{worked with}} a handful of designers, {{including}} famed fantasy illustrator Wayne Barlowe and renowned concept artist Jordu Schell, to shape the design of the Na'vi with paintings and physical sculptures when Cameron felt that 3-D brush renderings were not capturing his vision, often working together in the kitchen of Cameron's Malibu home. In , Cameron announced that he would film Avatar for a mid-2008 release and planned to begin principal photography with an established cast by [...] The following August, the visual effects studio Weta Digital signed on to help Cameron produce Avatar. Stan Winston, who had collaborated with Cameron in the past, joined Avatar to help with the film's designs. Production design for the film took several years. The film had two different production designers, and two separate art departments, one of which focused on the flora and fauna of Pandora, and another that created human machines and human factors. In , Cameron was announced to be using his own Reality Camera System to film in 3-D. The system would use two high-definition cameras in a single <b>camera</b> <b>body</b> to create depth perception.|$|E
2500|$|The {{ability to}} {{exchange}} lenses, {{to select the}} best lens for the current photographic need, and to allow the attachment of specialised lenses, {{is one of the}} key factors in the popularity of DSLR cameras, although this feature is not unique to the DSLR design and mirrorless interchangeable lens cameras are becoming increasingly popular. Interchangeable lenses for SLRs and DSLRs (also known as [...] "Glass") are built to operate correctly with a specific lens mount that is generally unique to each brand. A photographer will often use lenses made by the same manufacturer as the <b>camera</b> <b>body</b> (for example, Canon EF lenses on a Canon body) although there are also many independent lens manufacturers, such as Sigma, Tamron, Tokina, and Vivitar that make lenses for a variety of different lens mounts. There are also lens adapters that allow a lens for one lens mount to be used on a <b>camera</b> <b>body</b> with a different lens mount but with often reduced functionality.|$|E
2500|$|The first SLR cameras with {{internal}} (“through-the-lens” or “TTL”) meters (e.g., the Pentax Spotmatic) {{required that the}} lens is stopped down to the working aperture when taking a meter reading. [...] With a small aperture, this darkened the viewfinder, making viewing, focusing, and composition difficult. Subsequent models soon incorporated mechanical coupling between the lens and the <b>camera</b> <b>body,</b> indicating the working aperture to the camera while allowing the lens to be at its maximum aperture for composition and focusing; this feature became known as automatic aperture control or automatic diaphragm control.|$|E

2500|$|On modern cameras, {{especially}} when aperture {{is set on}} the <b>camera</b> <b>body,</b> f-number is often divided more finely than steps of one stop. Steps of one-third stop (1/3 EV) are the most common, since this matches the ISO system of film speeds. Half-stop steps are used on some cameras. Usually the full stops are marked, and the intermediate positions are clicked. As an example, the aperture that is one-third stop smaller than 2.8 is 3.2, two-thirds smaller is 3.5, and one whole stop smaller is 4. The next few f-stops in this sequence are: ...|$|E

50|$|In contrast, swivel LCDs (also {{known as}} {{articulating}} screen) are displays that freely rotate while {{attached to a}} <b>camera</b> <b>body.</b> Usually, the <b>camera</b> <b>body</b> is {{much larger than the}} swivelling display. Swivel LCD devices can be considered as swivel lens devices because the <b>camera</b> <b>body</b> can swivel around the small display; albeit, aiming the camera is more difficult. Most camcorders have a swivel LCD.|$|E

50|$|Its large {{diameter}} and relatively short flange focal distance of 44.0 mm allows mechanical adaptation of EF <b>camera</b> <b>bodies</b> to {{many types of}} non-EF lenses. It is possible to mount lenses using the Nikon F mount, Olympus OM, Leica R and universal M42 lens mounts (among others) {{by the use of}} a mechanical adapter without electronic control of the aperture or autofocus. Conversely, parfocal adaptation of EF lenses to non-EF <b>camera</b> <b>bodies</b> is not generally possible with only a mechanical adapter that does not contain optical elements.|$|R

50|$|The Nikon F-mount lens {{systems and}} the Pentax K-mount systems are the only 35 mm SLR camera systems (apart from the Leica M-mount {{rangefinder}} system) that allow a photographer to use a mechanical SLR <b>camera</b> <b>body,</b> a fully automatic SLR <b>camera</b> <b>body,</b> and a DSLR <b>camera</b> <b>body,</b> all utilizing the same lenses. The only aspects of these manufacturers' lenses that have changed are the addition of electronic contacts, autofocus abilities and, in some cases, {{the elimination of the}} external aperture ring for electronic control (i.e., Nikon's 'G-type' auto-Nikkors, which cannot be used on a mechanical SLR <b>camera</b> <b>body).</b>|$|E
50|$|Other main {{differences}} included focusing drive {{built into}} the <b>camera</b> <b>body</b> for use with standard lens, removable back, shutter speed knob integral with film wind knob placed {{at the front of}} the <b>camera</b> <b>body,</b> and finished in black.|$|E
50|$|A {{technique}} that requires no additional capabilities of any <b>camera</b> <b>body</b> - lens combination consists of stabilizing the entire <b>camera</b> <b>body</b> externally {{rather than using}} an internal method. This is achieved by attaching a gyroscope to the <b>camera</b> <b>body,</b> usually utilizing the camera's built-in tripod mount. This allows the external gyro to stabilize the camera, and is typically employed in photography from a moving vehicle, when a lens or camera offering another type of image stabilization is not available.|$|E
