5|$|Originally {{intended}} just {{to convince}} Fox to fund some shooting in Paris, Frankel's sizzle reel led {{the studio to}} put a stronger marketing push behind the movie. It moved the release date from February to summer, scheduling it as a lighter alternative audiences <b>could</b> <b>consider</b> to Superman Returns {{at the end of}} June 2006, and began to position it as an event movie in and of itself.|$|E
5|$|The {{stadium is}} owned by Manchester City Council and leased by the {{football}} club.

Manchester City signed an agreement with Manchester City Council in March 2010 to allow a £1 billion redevelopment led by architect Rafael Viñoly.|$|E
5|$|Industrial Zen is {{a studio}} album {{recorded}} by English jazz musician John McLaughlin in 2006. It {{was released on}} 22 May 2006 by Verve Records as a compact disc. Following the release of Thieves and Poets (2003), he began creating an album that was more ambitious and one that he <b>could</b> <b>consider</b> unique to him. He collaborated with various musicians for the project, such as vocalist Shankar Mahadevan, saxophonist Bill Evans, and tabla player Zakir Hussain. A jazz fusion and electric jazz album, Industrial Zen features the use of several instruments, including drums, keyboards, the electric bass, and the tabla. Additionally, McLaughlin wrote and produced all eight songs that appear on the record.|$|E

25|$|During this period, {{there was}} {{considerable}} debate within the settlement over the proper status {{of the church in}} the New World: whether it was a new church or whether it remained within the Lutheran hierarchy in Germany.

25|$|Although Brezhnev {{and other}} CPM first {{secretaries}} were largely successful in suppressing Romanian irredentism in the 1950s–1980s, Mikhail Gorbachev's administration facilitated {{the revival of}} the movement in the region.

25|$|Abraham Isaac Kook, first Chief Rabbi of the Jewish {{community}} in then Palestine, held that atheists were not actually denying God: rather, they were denying one of man's many images of God. Since any man-made image of God {{can be considered}} an idol, Kook held that, in practice, one <b>could</b> <b>consider</b> atheists as helping true religion burn away false images of god, thus in the end serving the purpose of true monotheism.|$|E
25|$|By contrast, England {{had played}} full series {{both at home}} and abroad in every summer and winter since the end of the war, though with mixed results. The team had been {{comprehensively}} outplayed twice by Australia, and though other results against India, South Africa and West Indies had been better, there had been considerable experimentation with new players, and only a handful of players <b>could</b> <b>consider</b> themselves certainties for selection were England to choose to field its strongest side.|$|E

25|$|England were shaken, {{with the}} score at 31 for 4, and with Ian Bell and Kevin Pietersen at the crease. Pietersen <b>could</b> <b>consider</b> himself lucky to survive, after a {{suggestion}} {{he had been}} caught first ball. He survived, {{and went on to}} make 20, only to be given out off a similar situation from Shane Warne. His 41-run partnership with Bell steadied things somewhat, and there were hopes among England fans that Bell would make his first significant score against the tourists. Instead, he fell two overs after Pietersen, having given the tiniest of edges to Gilchrist for 21.|$|E
25|$|Fritz Perls {{presented}} {{his theory of}} dreams {{as part of the}} holistic nature of Gestalt therapy. Dreams are seen as projections of parts of the self that have been ignored, rejected, or suppressed. Jung argued that one <b>could</b> <b>consider</b> every person in the dream to represent an aspect of the dreamer, which he called the subjective approach to dreams. Perls expanded this point of view to say that even inanimate objects in the dream may represent aspects of the dreamer. The dreamer may, therefore, be asked to imagine being an object in the dream and to describe it, in order to bring into awareness the characteristics of the object that correspond with the dreamer's personality.|$|E
25|$|England won the toss {{and chose}} to field – a {{decision}} which looked correct {{as the new}} ball bowlers found plenty of movement of the pitch. However, they failed {{to take advantage of}} this situation, and the two wickets earned during the first session of play were due to lbw decisions that the batsmen <b>could</b> <b>consider</b> themselves unlucky to get out to. The biggest wicket of the day for England was that of Kumar Sangakkara, who pulled a ball out to deep square leg into the waiting hands of Monty Panesar. He had scored 46, but looked set for a much larger score. At the end of the day’s play, Sri Lanka were 147/4, but with Mahela Jayawardene still at the crease.|$|E

25|$|On April 6, 1970, a Dukes County {{grand jury}} {{assembled}} in special session to investigate Kopechne's death. Judge Wilfred Paquet instructed {{the members of}} the grand jury that they <b>could</b> <b>consider</b> only matters brought to their attention by the superior court, the district attorney, or their own personal knowledge. Citing the orders of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, Paquet told the grand jury that it could not see the evidence or Boyle's report from the inquest, which were still impounded. Dinis, who had attended the inquest and seen Boyle's report, told the grand jury that there was not enough evidence to indict Kennedy on potential charges of manslaughter, perjury or driving to endanger. The grand jury called four witnesses who had not testified at the inquest: they testified for a total of 20 minutes, but no indictments were issued.|$|E
25|$|For IIIAC, the {{cease-fire}} agreement meant a lessening of the hit-and-run guerrilla attacks, {{but there was}} never a time in the following months when a guard detachment <b>could</b> <b>consider</b> itself safe. By March, political and military differences had again split China wide open and, although a pretense at negotiation continued, clashes increased between Communists and Nationalists. Neither side was blameless in the covert renewal of hostilities, but the major share of blame fell to the Communists, who definitely violated the January 10 agreement in March and April by moving troops from Shansi and Hopeh into Manchuria. With the assistance of the Soviet occupation forces, which conveniently withdrew when Chinese Communists arrived to take over, and which left large stockpiles of Japanese weapons and munitions behind, Mao Zedong managed to strengthen his forces considerably during {{the cease-fire}}.|$|E
25|$|When {{questioned}} {{as to why}} {{the heads}} found at Cranley Gardens had been subjected to moist heat, Nilsen stated that he had frequently boiled the heads of his victims in a large cooking pot on his stove in order that the internal contents would evaporate, thus removing the need to dispose of the brain and flesh. The torsos and limbs of the three victims killed at this address would be dissected within a week or so of their murder before being wrapped in plastic bags and stowed in the three locations he had indicated to police; the internal organs and smaller bones he would flush down the toilet. This practice — which had led to his arrest — had been the only method he <b>could</b> <b>consider</b> to dispose of the internal organs and soft tissue as, unlike at Melrose Avenue, he had no exclusive usage of the garden of the property.|$|E

25|$|I am {{unable to}} state with {{certainty}} what language the Pelasgians spoke, but we <b>could</b> <b>consider</b> the speech of the Pelasgians who still exist in settlements above Tyrrhenia {{in the city of}} Kreston, formerly neighbors to the Dorians who at that time lived in the land now called Thessaliotis; also the Pelasgians who once lived with the Athenians and then settled Plakia and Skylake in the Hellespont; and along with those who lived with all the other communities and were once Pelasgian but changed their names. If one can judge by this evidence, the Pelasgians spoke a barbarian language. And so, if the Pelasgian language was spoken in all these places, the people of Attica being originally Pelasgian, must have learned a new language when they became Hellenes. As a matter of fact, the people of Krestonia and Plakia no longer speak the same language, which shows that they continue to use the dialect they brought with them when they migrated to those lands.|$|E
25|$|On 3 April, Armenian {{military}} authorities announced that NKR forces had recaptured positions around Talysh, which the Azerbaijani Ministry of Defense claimed was untrue. On 6 April, news footage shown on Armenia's First Channel revealed Armenian journalists and NKR troops freely mingling {{on the streets}} of Talysh and Madagiz. On 8 April, news footage shown on Azerbaijani TV channel showed Azerbaijan military placing a new sign at heights near Talysh. On 11 April, news footage from Armenia's First channel showed Talysh heights under NKR troops control near Tap Qaraqoyunlu. Again on 8 May, news footage from Civilnet showed the journalist Tatul Hakobyan with some NKR soldiers at Talysh heights near Naftalan. Later Defense Minister Zakir Hasanov stated that if shelling of Azerbaijani settlements by Armenian forces did not cease, Azerbaijan <b>could</b> <b>consider</b> launching artillery attacks on Stepanakert. On the same day, the Azerbaijani Ministry of Defense announced a unilateral end to hostilities. The Azerbaijani Ministry of Defense stated that should Armenian shelling pursue, Azerbaijan will continue its offensive.|$|E
