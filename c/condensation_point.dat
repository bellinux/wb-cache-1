40|$|Pseudo-damping is a counter-intuitive {{phenomenon}} {{observed in}} a special class of linear structures that exhibit an impulse response characterized by a decaying amplitude, {{even in the absence}} of any dissipation mechanism. The conserved energy remains within but designated parts of the system. Pseudo-damping develops when the natural frequency distribution of the system includes <b>condensation</b> <b>points.</b> The recently formulated theoretical foundation of this phenomenon, based on mathematical properties of special trigonometric series, makes it possible to describe a class of mechanical systems capable of displaying pseudo-damping characteristics. They include systems with discrete oscillators and one-dimensional continuous beamlike structures already reported by the authors in recent studies. This paper examines development of pseudo-damping phenomenon in two-dimensional structures, using plates and shells as examples, and shows how a preloaded plate on an elastic foundation can lead to pseudo-damping. Moreover, in the case of curved shell elements examined here, pseudo-damping can result due to the curvature of the structure, which naturally introduces <b>condensation</b> <b>points</b> in the modal density...|$|R

50|$|Nitrogen is {{generally}} preferred over carbon dioxide {{for a few}} reasons. Nitrogen will not liquefy and leak into the marker, while if the CO2 tank doesn't have an anti-siphon tube installed, or {{if there is no}} expansion chamber or regulator, liquid CO2 can leak into the marker, causing damage to O-rings and dangerous overpressures. The solenoid valves on electro-pneumatic markers are particularly sensitive to this, and thus many manufacturers will specify to use only nitrogen or HPA with their electro-pneumatic markers. Nitrogen generally has a more consistent shot than CO2. This is because when the playing area is warm, the CO2 will expand more rapidly from the liquid form, causing the marker to fire at a higher velocity. But when the temperature is lower, the expansion occurs more slowly, causing a decrease in the velocity of the shot. This is especially apparent during rapid firing while using CO2. The rapid discharge of CO2 causes the temperature of the liquid CO2 to drop dramatically, resulting in a significant loss in pressure. The effect of temperature on HPA or nitrogen, on the other hand, is negligible. However, CO2 tanks are significantly cheaper than nitrogen tanks. The nitrogen tanks traditionally cost slightly less to be filled than the CO2 tanks at approximately three to five US dollars. Also, many fields offer better rates for HPA fills due to the lower cost to the field; HPA {{is generally}} cheaper to procure as it has myriad industrial applications, and the field can even purchase the equipment to pressurize their own cylinders on-site. CO2, on the other hand, must be separated from other gases before bottling, usually through super-cooling air to the <b>condensation</b> <b>point</b> of each gas, a process that requires far more sophisticated and expensive equipment.|$|E

40|$|Cytoskeletal dynamics, {{modulated}} by actin-myosin interactions, play {{an important}} role in Escherichia coli K 1 invasion of human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC). Herein, we show that inhibitors of myosin function, butanedione monoxide and ML- 7, significantly blocked the E. coli invasion of HBMEC. The invasive E. coli induces myosin light-chain (MLC) phosphorylation during the invasion process, which gets recruited to the site of actin condensation beneath the bacteria. We also show that invading E. coli downregulates the activity of p 21 -activated kinase 1 (PAK 1), which is an upstream regulator of MLC kinase (MLCK). Overexpression of wild-type PAK 1 and constitutively active PAK 1 in HBMEC inhibits E. coli invasion significantly with a concomitant decrease in MLC phosphorylation. The inhibition of E. coli invasion by these PAK 1 mutants is due to the absence of phospho-MLC at the actin <b>condensation</b> <b>points.</b> In contrast, the dominant-negative PAK 1 shows no effect either on the invasion or on MLC phosphorylation or phospho-MLC recruitment to the actin focal points, suggesting that activated PAK 1 inactivates MLCK.
