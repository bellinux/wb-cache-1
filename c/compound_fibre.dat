Two fibres (32 -nm striation periodicity; system I fibres) closely underlie each of the 2 -stranded roots, while different fibres (150 -nm striation periodicity; system II fibres) run parallel to the root microtubules, and are 150 - 200 nm more internally located.

A special region of the plasmalemma of both gamete types about 0 - 5 fim away from the basal bodies and located between 2 adjacent microtubular roots is structurally specialized and acts as a mating structure in gametic fusion.

40|$|Wheat {{bioactive}} <b>compounds</b> (<b>fibres,</b> minerals, vitamins, antioxidants) {{are concentrated}} in grain outer layers, which constitute the bran fraction obtained after the milling process leading to the white flour. In order to improve the health value of the flours, whole grains can be processed or alternatively, bran fractions {{can be added to}} white flours. In the bran, bio-actives compounds are poorly bio-accessible as they are trapped in resistant cell-wall. Dry fractionation of wheat bran takes advantage from differences in compositional and mechanical properties between grain tissues. Both ultrafine milling and electrostatic separation can be used to prepare bran fractions with different degrees of micronization and/or enriched in compounds of interest. In vitro digestion studies of bran-enriched breads have shown that the bio-accessibility of phenolic acids and minerals improves with decreasing particle size and also with increasing concentration of micronized aleurone material. © 2010 Sociét é française de nutrition.

A specially developed double pultrusion technique has been employed for <b>compounding.</b> <b>Fibres</b> were analysed in single fibre tensile tests. Strength, stiffness, impact strength, and heat distortion temperature (HDT) were determined for injection-moulded standard test specimen and structural features were revealed by scanning electron microscopy. A strong reinforcing effect was observed in all cases. In particular, high tenacity tyre cord rayon gives excellent composite strength and impact strength, often doubling or tripling the pristine matrix values. In the case of PP, Lyocell type fibres provide enhanced stiffness and HDT, and thus the combination of both fibre types leads to a balanced composite property profile. The PE case is very similar to PP. For HIPS mainly strength and stiffness is increased, while for TPE the property profile is changed completely.

Over the past decades modifiable risk factors of CHD have been identified, including smoking and diet. These factors when altered can have a significant impact on an individuals' risk of developing CHD, their overall health and quality of life. There is strong evidence suggesting that dietary intake of plant foods rich in <b>fibre</b> and polyphenolic <b>compounds,</b> effectively lowers the risk of developing CHD. However, the efficacy of these foods often appears to be greater than the sum of their recognised biologically active parts. Here we discuss the hypothesis that beneficial metabolic and vascular effects of dietary fibre and plant polyphenols are due to an up regulation of the colon-systemic metabolic axis by these <b>compounds.</b> <b>Fibres</b> and many polyphenols are converted into biologically active compounds by the colonic microbiota. This microbiota imparts great metabolic versatility and dynamism, with many of their reductive or hydrolytic activities appearing complementary to oxidative or conjugative human metabolism. Understanding these microbial activities is central to determining the role of different dietary components in preventing or beneficially impacting on the impaired lipid metabolism and vascular dysfunction that typifies CHD and type 11 diabetes. This approach lays the foundation for rational selection of health promoting foods, rational target driven design of functional foods, and provides an essential thus-far, overlooked, dynamic to our understanding of how foods recognised as "healthy" impact on the human metabonome...|$|R

40|$|The modern {{consumer}} {{is aware of}} the link between food consumption and health. Therefore, the demand for functional foods, i. e. foods with health-promoting or disease-preventing characteristics, increases. Examples of functional foods are foods fortified with dietary fibre, probiotics, prebiotics, antioxidants and/or vitamins. Health effects of food containing a significant content of dietary fibre are not only assigned to the dietary fibre fraction, but also to associated antioxidants, vitamins and minerals. Previous research showed that dietary <b>fibre</b> <b>compounds</b> named arabinoxylan-oligosaccharides (AXOS), hydrolysis products of arabinoxylan, have prebiotic properties. Although AXOS molecules can carry ester-linked ferulic acid, a powerful antioxidant, the antioxidant capacity of AXOS preparations has been examined much less. To evaluate the antioxidant capacity and structure-function relationship of AXOS, ferulic acid enriched AXOS (f-AXOS) were obtained by use of Amberlite XAD- 4 and successive elution with ethanol-water mixtures and ferulic acid depleted AXOS were obtained through treatment with ferulic acid esterase. Carbohydrate content and composition and ferulic acid content of f-AXOS and AXOS samples were determined. The antioxidant capacity of these fractions was determined by use of a Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) assay. As AXOS are water soluble dietary <b>fibre</b> <b>compounds,</b> and possibly combine prebiotic and antioxidant activities, they are interesting compounds for incorporation in many functional foods, including AXOS enriched bread. status: publishe...|$|R

In {{the first part of this}} research project, pultrusion and pull-drill process are investigated according to the production of granules. The pull-drill-process has a very great potential with respect to the practicability because this process enables a continuous production of granules. In cooperation with Voigt Metallbearbeitung GmbH (Grossbreitenbach, Federal Republic of Germany), the performance of the pull-drill plant is optimized. This plant also is optimized according to a stable production of granules. In cooperation with Svoboda Umformtechnik Ges. m. b. H.

This polit plant is used for the further development of the process technology and for the production of model materials.
