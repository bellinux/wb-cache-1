This paper describes a qualitative study, aimed at examining parents’ experiences of <b>contact</b> <b>arrangements</b> post-separation, undertaken within a mixed methods random allocation study of therapeutic outcomes for parents in entrenched conflict over their children. Two established semi-structured interviews with 22 parents were jointly subjected to thematic analyses.

These findings indicate the immense strain children and parents are under and shed much light on the desperate states of mind for parents, particularly the anxieties driving relentless child contact disputes.

40|$|From {{the early}} 1990 s {{there has been}} a plethora of {{evidence}} highlighting concerns regarding domestic violence and child contact. This has resulted in various legal and policy responses, over the last 10 - 15 years, to promote safe <b>contact</b> <b>arrangements</b> through the family courts. However, the Family Justice Review (FJR, 2011) concluded that court should be a last resort for families making arrangements for children post-parental separation. Consequently, policy reform has taken place which seeks to diminish the role of courts in adjudicating private family law disputes. Changes include restrictions to legal aid and new measures to promote private resolution of disputes outside the court arena. A growing body of research highlights important implications of this new policy context for women and children's access to justice in domestic violence cases (Coy et al., 2015; Harding and Newnham, 2015; Mackay, 2013; Rights of Women, 2014).
