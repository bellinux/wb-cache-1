60|$|And I say again, since light against {{light was}} {{so early in}} the church in the wilderness, and has also been there so long, and again, since many in this church were both born and bred there under these oppositions of light, it is easy to {{conclude}} that something of the enemy's darkness might be also called light by the sincere that followed after. For by antichristian darkness, though they might call it light, the true light was darkened, and so the eye made dim, even the eye of the truly godly. Also the Holy Ghost did much withdraw itself from the church, so the doctrines, traditions, and rudiments of the world took more hold there, and spread themselves more formidably over the face of that whole church. For after the first angel had sounded, and the star was fallen from heaven to the earth, and had received the key of the bottomless pit, and had opened the mouth thereof, the smoke came out amain. This angel {{was one of the first}} dads of antichristianism, and this smoke was that which they <b>call</b> <b>light,</b> but it was 'light against light.' 'And he opened the bottomless pit, and there arose a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace, and the sun and the air were darkened, by reason of the smoke of the pit' (Rev 9:1,2).|$|E
60|$|A {{beautiful}} {{feature of}} the scene to-day, as the preceding day, were the vines growing on fig-trees (?) [This interrogation-mark must mean that Mr. Hawthorne was not sure they were fig-trees.--ED.], and often wreathed in rich festoons from one tree to another, by and by to be hung with clusters of purple grapes. I suspect the vine is a pleasanter object of sight under this mode of culture than it can be in countries where it produces a more precious wine, and therefore is trained more artificially. Nothing can be more picturesque than the spectacle of an old grapevine, with almost a trunk of its own, clinging round its tree, imprisoning within its strong embrace the friend that supported its tender infancy, converting the tree wholly to its own selfish ends, as seemingly flexible natures are apt to do, stretching out its innumerable arms on every bough, and allowing hardly a leaf to sprout except its own. I must not yet quit this hasty sketch, without throwing in, both in the early morning, {{and later in the}} forenoon, the mist that dreamed among the hills, and which, now that I have called it mist, I feel almost more inclined to <b>call</b> <b>light,</b> being so quietly cheerful with the sunshine through it. Put in, now and then, a castle on a hilltop; a rough ravine, a smiling valley; a mountain stream, with a far wider bed than it at present needs, and a stone bridge across it, with ancient and massive arches;--and I shall say no more, except that all these particulars, and many better ones which escape me, made up a very pleasant whole.|$|E

I could only get on at all by taking [...] "nature" [...] into my confidence and my account, by treating my monstrous ordeal as a push in a direction unusual, of course, and unpleasant, but demanding, after all, for a fair front, only another turn of the screw of ordinary human virtue. No attempt, nonetheless, could well require more tact than just this attempt to supply, one's self, ALL the nature. How could I put even a little of that article into a suppression of reference to what had occurred? How, on the other hand, could I make reference without a new plunge into the hideous obscure? Well, a sort of answer, after a time, had come to me, and it was so far confirmed as that I was met, incontestably, by the quickened vision of what was rare in my little companion. It was indeed as if he had found even now--as he had so often found at lessons--still some other delicate way to ease me off. Wasn't there light in the fact which, as we shared our solitude, broke out with a specious glitter it had never yet quite worn?--the fact that (opportunity aiding, precious opportunity which had now come) it would be preposterous, with a child so endowed, to forego the help one might wrest from absolute intelligence? What had his intelligence been given him for but to save him? Mightn't one, to reach his mind, risk the stretch of an angular arm over his character? It was as if, when we were face to face in the dining room, he had literally shown me the way. The roast mutton was on the table, and I had dispensed with attendance. Miles, before he sat down, stood a moment with {{his hands in his pockets}} and looked at the joint, on which he seemed on the point of passing some humorous judgment.

60|$|Everyday {{observation}} shows that, of {{the bodies}} which compose the material world, some are in motion and some are, or appear to be, at rest. Of the bodies in motion, some, like the sun and stars, exhibit a constant movement, regular in amount and direction, for which no external cause appears. Others, as stones and smoke, seem also to move of themselves when external impediments are taken away. But these appear to tend to move in opposite directions: the bodies we call heavy, such as stones, downwards, and the bodies we <b>call</b> <b>light,</b> at least such as smoke and steam, upwards. And, as we further notice that the earth, below our feet, {{is made up of}} heavy matter, while the air, above our heads, is extremely light matter, it is easy to regard this fact as evidence that the lower region is the place to which heavy things tend--their proper place, in short--while the upper region is the proper place of light things; and to generalise the facts observed by saying that bodies, which are free to move, tend towards their proper places. All these seem to be natural motions, dependent on the inherent faculties, or tendencies, of bodies themselves. But there are other motions which are artificial or violent, as when a stone is thrown from the hand, or is knocked by another stone in motion. In such cases as these, for example, when a stone is cast from the hand, the distance travelled by the stone appears to depend partly on its weight and partly upon the exertion of the thrower. So that, the weight of the stone remaining the same, {{it looks as if the}} motive power communicated to it were measured by the distance to which the stone travels--as if, in other words, the power needed to send it a hundred yards was twice as great as that needed to send it fifty yards. These, apparently obvious, conclusions from the everyday appearances of rest and motion fairly represent the state of opinion upon the subject which prevailed among the ancient Greeks, and remained dominant until the age of Galileo. The publication of the 'Principia' of Newton, in 1686-7, marks the epoch at which the progress of mechanical physics had effected a complete revolution of thought on these subjects. By this time, it had been made clear that the old generalisations were either incomplete or totally erroneous; that a body, once set in motion, will continue to move in a straight line for any conceivable time or distance, unless it is interfered with; that any change of motion is proportional to the 'force' which causes it, and takes place in the direction in which that 'force' is exerted; and that, when a body in motion acts as a cause of motion on another, the latter gains as much as the former loses, and vice versâ. It is to be noted, however, that while, in contradistinction to the ancient idea of the inherent tendency to motion of bodies, the absence of any such spontaneous power of motion was accepted as a physical axiom by the moderns, the old conception virtually maintained itself is a new shape. For, in spite of Newton's well-known warning against the 'absurdity' of supposing that one body can act on another at a distance through a vacuum, the ultimate particles of matter were generally assumed to be the seats of perennial causes of motion termed 'attractive and repulsive forces,' in virtue of which, any two such particles, without any external impression of motion, or intermediate material agent, were supposed to tend to approach or remove from one another; and this view of the duality of the causes of motion is very widely held at the present day.|$|E

Although there is vast amounts of literature discussing patient communication with their health care providers, few studies have explored patients’ perceptions concerning <b>call</b> <b>light</b> use and communication. The specific {{aim of this study}} was to solicit patients’ perceptions regarding their <b>call</b> <b>light</b> use and communication with nursing staff. Methods: Patients invited to this study met the following inclusion criteria: proficient in English, been hospitalized for at least 24 hours, aged ≥ 21 years, and able to communicate verbally (eg, not intubated). Thirty participants provided written informed consent, were enrolled in the study, and completed interviews. Results: Using qualitative descriptive methods, five major themes emerged from patients’ perceptions (namely; establishing connectivity, participant safety concerns, no separation: health care and the <b>call</b> <b>light</b> device, issues with the current <b>call</b> <b>light,</b> and participants’ perceptions of “nurse work”). Multiple minor themes supported these major themes. Data analysis utilized the constant comparative methods of Glaser and Strauss.

40|$|AIM: The {{aim of this}} {{exploratory}} {{study was to determine}} whether the level of nursing teamwork is correlated to <b>call</b> <b>light</b> answering time in acute care hospital patient care units. Background: Teamwork has been shown to improve productivity. In this study, we examine the relationship between unit <b>call</b> <b>light</b> response time as a measure of productivity and the level of teamwork on the unit. METHOD: The Nursing Teamwork Survey was administered to nursing staff on 18 inpatient units in 3 hospitals. In addition to the overall teamwork score, the NTS has 5 subscales. <b>Call</b> <b>light</b> response times were collected from electronic systems which measures the time it takes for nursing staff on a given unit to respond to patient call lights. RESULTS: There was no significant relationship between <b>call</b> <b>light</b> response time and teamwork overall or on the five subscales. Shared mental models, which comprise the conceptual understanding of the roles and responsibilities of each team member, however was moderately correlated with call-light answering times. CONCLUSIONS: It is logical that shared mental models would be associated with <b>call</b> <b>light</b> response time since a common problem in patient units is the "it's not my job syndrome" where nursing staff do not answer call lights for patients assigned to someone else. More research with a larger number of patient units is needed to validate these findings...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Fall {{prevention}} programs for hospitalized patients have had limited success, {{and the effect}} of programs on decreasing total falls and fall-related injuries is still inconclusive. This exploratory multi-hospital study examined the unique contribution of <b>call</b> <b>light</b> response time to predicting total fall rates and injurious fall rates in inpatient acute care settings. The conceptual model was based on Donabedian's framework of structure, process, and health-care outcomes. The covariates included the hospital, unit type, total nursing hours per patient-day (HPPDs), percentage of the total nursing HPPDs supplied by registered nurses, percentage of patients aged 65 years or older, average case mix index, percentage of patients with altered mental status, percentage of patients with hearing problems, and <b>call</b> <b>light</b> use rate per patient-day. Methods We analyzed data from 28 units from 4 Michigan hospitals, using archived data and chart reviews from January 2004 to May 2009. The patient care unit-month, defined as data aggregated by month for each patient care unit, was the unit of analysis (N = 1063). Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were used. Results Faster <b>call</b> <b>light</b> response time was associated with lower total fall and injurious fall rates. Units with a higher <b>call</b> <b>light</b> use rate had lower total fall and injurious fall rates. A higher percentage of productive nursing hours provided by registered nurses was associated with lower total fall and injurious fall rates. A higher percentage of patients with altered mental status was associated with a higher total fall rate but not a higher injurious fall rate. Units with a higher percentage of patients aged 65 years or older had lower injurious fall rates. Conclusions Faster <b>call</b> <b>light</b> response time appeared to contribute to lower total fall and injurious fall rates, after controlling for the covariates. For practical relevance, hospital and nursing executives should consider strategizing fall and injurious fall prevention efforts by aiming for a decrease in staff response time to call lights. Monitoring <b>call</b> <b>light</b> response time on a regular basis is recommended and could be incorporated into evidence-based practice guidelines for fall prevention. </p...|$|E

Blakley, Kroth, and Gregson (2011) believed that service excellence is the key driver to an organization's patient satisfaction levels. The {{purpose of this study}} is to examine if intentional nurse rounding, incorporating the 4 -P Program, done at designated times, would have an effect on patient satisfaction. This is a modified replication of Blakley, Kroth and Gregson’s (2011) research, “The Impact of Nurse Rounding on Patient Satisfaction in a Medical-Surgical Hospital Unit”. The conceptual framework of this study will be based on Stringer’s Action Research Framework of Look, Think, and Act (2007). This study will be conducted in an Indiana East Central hospital, in the Women & Children’s Department. The projected sample is 150 postpartum patients over a 6 month period. The unit will implement the Patient Rounding process every 2 hours from 7 am to 7 pm and every 4 hours from 7 pm to 7 am. The staff will check the patient’s 4 P’s (pain, position, potty, & placement) during the rounding process, as well as answer any patient/family questions. For data collection, rounding logs will be kept and completed per nursing staff. <b>Call</b> <b>light</b> logs will keep record of <b>call</b> <b>light</b> usage prior to and following the implementation of intentional patient rounding on the unit. Nurses will be interviewed concerning the 2 hour rounding and asked whether they observed a decrease in patient <b>call</b> <b>light</b> usage. Patients will receive a survey to determine their overall level of satisfaction with the care received. The targeted areas for the survey will be the following: Nursing Staff Courtesy & Friendliness, Pain Control, Overall Level of Safety, Overall Teamwork between Doctors, Nurses, and Staff, and Overall Quality of Care.
