40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} is to analyse the connections between <b>agreements</b> under <b>Company</b> law and the study of legal consequences of such bonds. The research is organized in three main sections. The first part is dedicated to reconstruct the theories of linked contracts and economic operations. It emerges the tendency of the legislator to legislate hypothesis of linked contracts in Business Law in order to achieve more certainty in business transactions. The second section is concentrated over hypothesis of linked contracts in Company Law provided by the legislature. It is therefore analysed the relationship between <b>Company’s</b> <b>Agreements</b> and Shareholders' Agreements, the relationship between Cooperative’s Agreement and Agreements with its own shareholders, the leveraged buy-out operations, the regulation of funding in relation to a specific transaction and the payment for share capital secured in Limited Liability Partnerships (In Italian Company's Law defined as «società a responsabilità limitata»). The third part concentrates on the analysis of a series of court judgements regarding hypothesis of linked contracts created pursuant to the power of autonomy of the parties: the connection between a <b>Company’s</b> <b>Agreement</b> and the agreement to sell a property to the same company; the connection between a <b>Company’s</b> <b>Agreement</b> and a contract between the company and his own shareholder; the connection between a <b>Company’s</b> <b>Agreement</b> and the stipulation of a shared property agreement with a shareholder. The analysis proceeds by focusing on three situations in which the connection is set up in a way to circumvent the law: in the first it is violated the rule to protect the integrity of the share capital, in the second the proper fulfilment of taxes and in the third one the pre-emption clause. The conclusions point out the characteristics of linked contracts in Company Law...|$|R

40|$|International audienceOver {{the past}} decade, {{a number of}} European {{companies}} have negotiated transnational <b>company</b> <b>agreements.</b> These agreements may help improve labour standards in the subsidiaries, and even more for those employed by subcontractors or suppliers. They may also encourage social dialogue at these levels. However, given their uncertain legal status, {{how it is possible}} to ensure their effective implementation throughout the company's subsidiaries? What matters is less the legal status of the transnational collective agreement than the active involvement of the various actors involved in the process. The role of the signatories to the agreement is of course crucial, but its effective implementation also requires the commitment of local managements and workers' representatives. This article draws on discussions and interviews with managers and worker representatives directly involved in the implementation of transnational <b>company</b> <b>agreements,</b> and identifies ways to encourage this kind of commitment...|$|R

40|$|In many European countries, the {{majority}} of workers have their wage rates determined directly by industry-level agreements. For some workers, industry agreements are supplemented by firm-specific agreements. Yet, {{the relative importance of}} individual company and industry agreements (in other words, the degree of centralisation) differs drastically across industries. The authors of this paper use unique linked employer-employee data from a 2003 survey in Belgium to examine how these bargaining features affect the extent of rent-sharing. Their results show that there is substantially more rent-sharing in decentralised than in centralised industries, even when controlling for the endogeneity of profits, for heterogeneity among workers and firms and for differences in characteristics between bargaining regimes. Moreover, in centralised industries, rent-sharing is found only for workers that are covered by a <b>company</b> <b>agreement.</b> The findings of this paper finally suggest that, within decentralised industries, both firm-specific and industry-wide bargaining generate rent-sharing to the same extent. Rent-sharing, collective bargaining, propensity score matching. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{insurance}} {{sector is}} a small but important sector in the Dutch economy. There are two sub sections or domains, insurance companies and intermediaries. There are two employer organisations, the Association of Insurers (VvV) and Adfiz (previously Fidin), and four employee organisations: FNV Bondgenoten, CNV Dienstenbond, De Unie, BBV and, {{on behalf of the}} self-employed, the FNV Zelfstandigen. About 25 % of employees are organised. The four unions are recognised parties at the negotiation table and thus signatory partners to the extended collective agreement in the insurance section. The extended multi employer collective agreement (for the smaller companies) covers about 35 % of the 50, 000 employees. The large companies, all members of VvV, each have their own <b>company</b> <b>agreement</b> and dominate the sector. VvV covers 95 % of the market. This implies that about 95 % of employees ares employed in a member company of VvV. Adfiz organises about 14 % of companies (intermediaries). In this domain there is no multi-employer agreement and Adfiz is not involved in collective bargaining...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{negotiation}} of corporate agreements in France, {{the cornerstone of}} labor relations, {{has been the subject}} of much research. However, few address the issue of the process of the {{negotiation of}} a <b>company</b> <b>agreement</b> on gender equality, a theme that has been mandatory since the Génisson 2001 Act. This issue presents certain particularities (the transversal nature of gender equality across various Human Resource areas, legal framework obligations, etc.) that may affect the negotiation process. To clarify this issue and to enrich both the literature on labor relations and the literature on gender equality our contribution seeks to identify the characteristics relative to negotiations on gender equality. As part of a CIFRE thesis (Industrial Convention of Formation by Research) and using participant observation in the negotiation of a corporate agreement on gender equality as well as interviews conducted with both union and management negotiators, we have been able to identify certain characteristics particular to negotiations on gender equality compared to the negotiation of agreements on other subjects. In particular, the definition of the theme of negotiation (gender equality) plays a central role in the negotiation; the transversal nature of this theme to various HR processes (recruitment, remuneration, promotion…) has strong implications on negotiators' bargaining leeway as well as on the role of unions vis-à-vis management; finally, the documented legal framework that attaches great importance to statistical indicators, can result in unattainable quantified commitments being included in the agreement...|$|E
40|$|Die Einzelhandelsbranche war in j Vergangenheit h 4 ufig Gegenstand der 6 ffentlichen und politischen Diskussion. In vorliegendem Forschungsbericht werden zum einen die Grundstruktur der Einzelhandelsbetriebe und zum anderen deren betriebliche Charakteristika im Vergleich zu Betrieben des Dienstleistungssektors und der Privatwirtschaft analysiert. Hierbei wird ein besonderer Fokus auf die Verbreitung atypischer Besch 4 ftigungsformen, die Tarifbindung, die betriebliche Aus- und Weiterbildung, erwartete Personalprobleme, den Fachkr 4 ftebedarf und die Besch 4 ftigung 4 lterer Mitarbeiter gelegt. Basierend auf den Auswertungen des IAB-Betriebspanels der Jahre 2010 und 2011 zeigt sich in der Einzelhandelsbranche sowohl eine starke betriebliche Verbreitung als auch eine hohe Nutzungsintensit 4 t der Teilzeitarbeit sowie der geringf Besch 4 ftigung. 82 Prozent der Betriebe nutzen Teilzeitarbeit und 64 Prozent der Einzelhandelsbetriebe besch 4 ftigen {{mindestens}} einen Mini-Jobber. 44 Prozent der Besch 4 ftigten des Einzelhandels arbeiten in Teilzeit und 23 Prozent sind geringf besch 4 ftigt.

This research report {{on the one hand}} investigates the basic structure of retail trade {{and on the other hand}} studies the in-plant characteristics of establishments in the retail trade compared with establishments in the service sector and the private sector. The analysis will focus on the distribution of the atypical employment, the bargaining coverage, the in-plant education and training, expected problems with human resource management, the need for skilled workers and the employment of older workers. Based on the analysis of the IAB Establishment Panel 2010 and 2011, there is a strong distribution and intensity in the use of part-time work and marginal employment in the retail sector. 82 percent of the establishments in the retail sector use part-time work and 64 percent employ at least one mini-jobber. 44 percent of the employees in the retail trade work part-time and 23 percent are marginally employed. Despite of the annulment of the collective agreement in 2000, retail trade establishments have a higher degree of collective bargaining coverage compared to establishments of the service sector. 27 percent of the establishments in the retail trade are subject to an industry-wide wage agreement, 2 percent to a <b>company</b> <b>agreement</b> concluded by the establishment and the trade union and 71 percent of all establishments in the retail sector are not bound by collective bargaining. In-plant education plays an important role in the retail sector. Compared to the service and the private sectors, more establishments in retail trade are legally authorised to educate apprentices and actively train apprentices at a higher rate. Otherwise there aren't differences concerning the participation in in-plant training. The most frequently used types of qualification are external and internal seminars and on-the-job training (instruction, initial skill adaption training). The analysis show that there aren't major differences concerning the expected problems with human resource management between the three sectors. Nearly 60 percent of all establishments in retail, the service and the private sectors predict no problems with human resource management. The problems mentioned most frequently are high financial burden on wage cost, difficulties in finding the required specialized personnel on the labor market, followed by lack of motivation in the workplace. In the first half of 2011 the need for skilled workers in the retail trade in Germany was about 106. 000 persons. This is an increase of 4. 000 employees compared to the previous year. Furthermore, 19 percent of the establishments in retail trade expect having to fill new vacancies or reoccupy old vacancies with qualified employees until 2013. However, the majority of establishments of the retail sector (58...|$|E

40|$|This article {{introduces}} the principal {{issues relating to}} the development of transnational collective bargaining. In particular, it summarizes the background and content of the juridical study undertaken for the European Commission, the so-called Ales Report, which suggested the mechanisms for an optional legal framework for transnational <b>company</b> <b>agreements.</b> We highlight four crucial questions: first, how to define, at transnational (company) level, the competent and legitimate workers’ representatives; second, how transnational <b>company</b> <b>agreements</b> can be effectively implemented; third, what systems and/or rules are suitable for the resolution of transnational labour disputes; and fourth, how transnational company bargaining can relate to other elements of the multi-level European industrial relations system. These same questions are addressed by other articles in this special issue, and we compare the answers they give with those provided by the Ales report. The lack of any legal form of internal regulation or external coordination seems to be the main feature of the upsurge in transnational company bargaining. This is likely to increase the already high degree of complexity inherent in the European industrial relations system: its multi-level governance model is characterized by task-specific jurisdictions, many jurisdictional levels and a flexible design...|$|R
