5|$|After {{decades of}} {{planning}} and construction the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) is a next generation detector for the new proton-proton <b>collider</b> (7 TeV + 7 TeV) called the Large Hadron <b>Collider</b> (LHC) which is now operational in the existing 17mi (27km) circular underground tunnel near Geneva, Switzerland at CERN, the European Laboratory for Particle Physics. Florida State University faculty members collaborated in the design, construction and operation of the LHC, with some components assembled at Florida State and shipped to CERN for installation. Florida State faculty contributed to several areas of the CMS, especially the electromagnetic calorimeter and the hadron calorimeter.|$|E
5|$|Super <b>Collider</b> was {{released}} in several versions domestically. There are {{two versions of the}} CD: a standard edition and a Best Buy-exclusive edition which features three bonus tracks along with 3D cover art. Additionally, standard and limited vinyl editions were made available, as well.|$|E
5|$|The {{safety of}} high energy {{particle}} collisions was {{a topic of}} widespread discussion and topical interest during {{the time when the}} Relativistic Heavy Ion <b>Collider</b> (RHIC) and later the Large Hadron <b>Collider</b> (LHC)—currently the world's largest and most powerful particle accelerator—were being constructed and commissioned. Concerns arose that such high energy experiments—designed to produce novel particles and forms of matter—had the potential to create harmful states of matter or even doomsday scenarios. Claims escalated as commissioning of the LHC drew closer, around 2008–2010. The claimed dangers included the production of stable micro black holes and the creation of hypothetical particles called strangelets, and these questions were explored in the media, on the Internet and at times through the courts.|$|E
5|$|Dystopia debuted {{at number}} {{three on the}} Billboard 200, with 48,000 copies sold in its first week, in {{addition}} to another 14,400 copies in its second week, when it fell to number 30 on the Billboard 200. Dystopia sold over 110,000 copies in the US fourteen weeks after its release. The album was a bigger seller than Super <b>Collider,</b> which took 43 weeks to reach 80,000. The album sold 148,000 copies in the US by December 2016, becoming the second biggest-selling heavy metal album released in 2016.|$|E
5|$|From 1988 to 1994, Marburger chaired Universities Research Association, the {{organization}} that operated Fermilab and oversaw construction of the ill-fated Superconducting Super <b>Collider,</b> an experience that is credited with convincing him of the influence government had in how science is carried out. During this time he {{also served as a}} trustee of Princeton University. He stepped down as President of Stony Brook University in 1994, and began doing research again {{as a member of the}} faculty.|$|E
5|$|Helium at low {{temperatures}} {{is used in}} cryogenics, and in certain cryogenics applications. As examples of applications, liquid helium is used to cool certain metals to the extremely {{low temperatures}} required for superconductivity, such as in superconducting magnets for magnetic resonance imaging. The Large Hadron <b>Collider</b> at CERN uses 96 metric tons of liquid helium to maintain the temperature at 1.9 kelvin.|$|E
5|$|In June 2013, Megadeth {{released}} its fourteenth studio album, Super <b>Collider,</b> to mixed critical reaction. In the {{months following the}} album's release, frontman and guitarist Dave Mustaine revealed {{that he and the}} rest of the band had already begun to discuss a follow-up, an urgency somewhat influenced by the then-recent death of Slayer guitarist Jeff Hanneman, which had reportedly given Mustaine a sense of mortality.|$|E
5|$|Investigations of the {{mathematical}} structure of M-theory have spawned important theoretical results in physics and mathematics. More speculatively, M-theory {{may provide a}} framework for developing a unified theory of all of the fundamental forces of nature. Attempts to connect M-theory to experiment typically focus on compactifying its extra dimensions to construct candidate models of our four-dimensional world, although so far none has been verified to give rise to physics as observed at, for instance, the Large Hadron <b>Collider.</b>|$|E
5|$|On , a {{group of}} European citizens, led by German {{biochemist}} Otto Rössler, filed a suit against CERN in the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. The suit, which was summarily rejected on the same day, alleged that the Large Hadron <b>Collider</b> posed grave risks {{for the safety of}} the 27 member states of the European Union and their citizens.|$|E
5|$|On February 12, 2013, the album's {{title was}} {{revealed}} as Super <b>Collider.</b> About two weeks later, Mustaine announced several song titles in an interview, discussing {{some of those}} songs in the process. Mustaine also revealed that fourteen songs were being worked on in total. Recording for the album was completed in mid-March.|$|E
5|$|Other virtual {{particles}} {{may contribute}} to the summation as well; for example, two photons may interact indirectly through virtual electron–positron pairs. In fact, such photon-photon scattering (see two-photon physics), as well as electron-photon scattering, is meant {{to be one of the}} modes of operations of the planned particle accelerator, the International Linear <b>Collider.</b>|$|E
5|$|Super <b>Collider</b> is {{the fourteenth}} studio album by American heavy metal band Megadeth. It was {{released}} on June 4, 2013, and is Megadeth's first album to be released on Tradecraft, a Universal label created for frontman Dave Mustaine. In the U.S., {{a special edition of}} the album was made available exclusively through Best Buy retailers. The album features a guest appearance from Disturbed and Device vocalist David Draiman. On April 23, 2013, the title track {{was released on}} iTunes as the album's lead single.|$|E
5|$|The cover artwork is {{modified}} from {{an existing}} {{photograph of the}} Inner Barrel of the Compact Muon Solenoid's Silicon Tracker, a particle physics experiment built on the Large Hadron <b>Collider</b> at CERN. A very faint reflection of Vic Rattlehead {{can be seen in}} the object's center. A 3D cover is featured on the special edition.|$|E
5|$|The report {{ruled out}} any doomsday {{scenario}} at the LHC, {{noting that the}} physical conditions and collision events which exist in the LHC, RHIC and other experiments occur naturally and routinely in the universe without hazardous consequences, including ultra-high-energy cosmic rays observed to impact Earth with energies far higher than those in any man-made <b>collider.</b>|$|E
5|$|The risk {{assessments}} of catastrophic scenarios at the LHC sparked public fears, and some scientists {{associated with the}} project received protests - the Large Hadron <b>Collider</b> team revealed that they had received death threats and threatening emails and phone calls demanding the experiment be halted. , Romania's Conservative Party held a protest before the European Commission mission to Bucharest, demanding that the experiment be halted because it feared that the LHC could create dangerous black holes.|$|E
25|$|RHIC {{is now the}} second-highest-energy heavy-ion <b>collider</b> in the world. As of November 7, 2010, the Large Hadron <b>Collider</b> (LHC) has {{collided}} heavy ions of lead {{at higher}} energies than RHIC. The LHC operating time for ions (lead-lead and lead-proton collisions) is limited to about one month per year.|$|E
25|$|The {{coupling}} of the leptons {{to gauge}} bosons are flavour-independent (i.e., {{the interactions between}} leptons and gauge bosons are {{the same for all}} leptons). This property is called lepton universality and has been tested in measurements of the tau and muon lifetimes and of Z boson partial decay widths, particularly at the Stanford Linear <b>Collider</b> (SLC) and Large Electron-Positron <b>Collider</b> (LEP) experiments.|$|E
25|$|Theory {{on how the}} <b>collider</b> {{could create}} a small wormhole, {{possibly}} allowing time travel into the past.|$|E
25|$|Cornell {{scientists}} have researched the fundamental particles of nature {{for more than}} 70 years. Cornell physicists, such as Hans Bethe, contributed {{not only to the}} foundations of nuclear physics but also participated in the Manhattan Project (see also: List of Cornell Manhattan Project people). In the 1930s, Cornell built the second cyclotron in the United States. In the 1950s, Cornell physicists became the first to study synchrotron radiation. During the 1990s, the Cornell Electron Storage Ring, located beneath Alumni Field, was the world's highest-luminosity electron-positron <b>collider.</b> After building the synchrotron at Cornell, Robert R. Wilson took a leave of absence to become the founding director of Fermilab, which involved designing and building the largest accelerator in the United States. Cornell's accelerator and high-energy physics groups are involved {{in the design of the}} proposed International Linear <b>Collider</b> and plan to participate in its construction and operation. The International Linear <b>Collider,</b> to be completed in the late 2010s, will complement the Large Hadron <b>Collider</b> and shed light on questions such as the identity of dark matter and the existence of extra dimensions.|$|E
25|$|To {{find the}} Higgs boson, a {{powerful}} particle accelerator was needed, because Higgs bosons {{might not be}} seen in lower-energy experiments. The <b>collider</b> needed {{to have a high}} luminosity in order to ensure enough collisions were seen for conclusions to be drawn. Finally, advanced computing facilities were needed to process the vast amount of data (25 petabytes per year as of 2012) produced by the collisions. For the announcement of 4 July 2012, a new <b>collider</b> known as the Large Hadron <b>Collider</b> was constructed at CERN with a planned eventual collision energy of 14 TeV—over seven times any previous collider—and over 300 trillion (3×1014) LHC proton–proton collisions were analysed by the LHC Computing Grid, the world's largest computing grid (as of 2012), comprising over 170 computing facilities in a worldwide network across 36 countries.|$|E
25|$|Deconfinement was {{claimed in}} 2000 at CERN SPS in heavy-ion collisions, and it implies {{a new state}} of matter: quark–gluon plasma, less {{interacting}} than in the nucleus, almost as in a liquid. It was found at the Relativistic Heavy Ion <b>Collider</b> (RHIC) at Brookhaven in the years 2004–2010 by four contemporaneous experiments. A quark–gluon plasma state has been confirmed at the CERN Large Hadron <b>Collider</b> (LHC) by the three experiments ALICE, ATLAS and CMS in 2010.|$|E
25|$|Preons were {{suggested}} as subparticles of quarks and leptons, but modern <b>collider</b> experiments {{have all but}} ruled out their existence.|$|E
25|$|The SM {{also makes}} several {{predictions}} about the decay of Z0 bosons, which have been experimentally confirmed by the Large Electron-Positron <b>Collider</b> at CERN.|$|E
25|$|CERN {{releases}} new particle-collision {{data from}} the Large Hadron <b>Collider</b> which {{may help explain why}} matter became dominant over antimatter in the early universe.|$|E
25|$|The Large Hadron <b>Collider</b> was {{the focus}} of the 2012 student film Decay, with the movie being filmed on {{location}} in CERN's maintenance tunnels.|$|E
25|$|Scientists {{studying}} {{data from}} the Large Hadron <b>Collider</b> report an extremely rare particle decay event, casting doubt on the scientific theory of supersymmetry.|$|E
25|$|P {{contains}} an inverted fork (or <b>collider),</b> , {{such that the}} middle node m is not in Z and no descendant of m is in Z.|$|E
25|$|Fermilab {{continues}} {{to participate in}} the work at the Large Hadron <b>Collider</b> (LHC); it serves as a Tier 1 site in the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid.|$|E
25|$|CERN {{scientists}} confirm, with a {{very high}} degree of certainty, that a new particle identified by the Large Hadron <b>Collider</b> in July 2012 is the long-sought Higgs boson.|$|E
25|$|New {{data from}} the Large Hadron <b>Collider</b> – based on {{measurements}} of the B meson – could offer the first direct hint of new physics beyond the Standard Model.|$|E
25|$|Mario Benedetti (1945), {{electronics}} engineer, {{the main}} Argentine scientist {{involved in the}} Large Hadron <b>Collider</b> project. He is also the owner of Tío Curzio, {{one of the most}} fashionable restaurants in the city.|$|E
25|$|Fermilab is {{dismantling}} the CDF (<b>Collider</b> Detector at Fermilab) and DØ (D0 experiment) facilities, {{and has been}} approved to continue moving forward with MINOS, NOνA, g−2, and Liquid Argon Test Facility.|$|E
25|$|The Tevatron was a {{circular}} particle accelerator (now inactive, since 2011) in the United States, at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (also known as Fermilab), {{just east of}} Batavia, Illinois, and holds {{the title of the}} second highest energy particle <b>collider</b> in the world, after the Large Hadron <b>Collider</b> (LHC) of the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) near Geneva, Switzerland. The Tevatron was a synchrotron that accelerated protons and antiprotons in a 6.86km, or 4.26mi, ring to energies of up to 1 TeV, hence its name. The Tevatron was completed in 1983 at a cost of $120 million and significant upgrade investments were made in 1983–2011.|$|E
25|$|The University of Freiburg Institute of Physics is {{actively}} involved with {{research at the}} Large Hadron <b>Collider</b> and has {{contributed significantly to the}} ATLAS experiment, resulting in the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012.|$|E
25|$|On July 2, 2012, {{two days}} before a {{scheduled}} announcement at the Large Hadron <b>Collider</b> (LHC), scientists at the Tevatron <b>collider</b> from the CDF and DØ collaborations announced their findings from the analysis of around 500 trillion collisions produced since 2001: They found {{that the existence of}} the Higgs boson was likely with a mass in the region of 115 to 135 GeV. The statistical significance of the observed signs was 2.9 sigma, which meant that there is only a 1-in-550 chance that a signal of that magnitude would have occurred if no particle in fact existed with those properties. The final analysis of data from the Tevatron did however not settle {{the question of whether the}} Higgs particle exists. Only when the scientists from the Large Hadron <b>Collider</b> announced the more precise LHC results on July 4, 2012, with a mass of 125.3 ± 0.4 GeV (CMS) or 126 ± 0.4 GeV (ATLAS) respectively, was there strong evidence through consistent measurements by the LHC and the Tevatron for the existence of a Higgs particle at that mass range.|$|E
