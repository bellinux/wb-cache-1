Likewise, it allows {{the efficient}} analysis of passive devices based on <b>circular</b> <b>waveguides</b> with arbitrary perturbations, thus providing more accurate results with less computational efforts than a rectangular waveguide based BI-RME approach.

A field analysis of this system produces the dispersion of complex modes, and reveals in detail intriguing phenomena such as backward-wave propagation below the un-lined waveguide’s fundamental-mode cutoff, resonant tunneling of power, field collimation, and miniaturization. It is shown how the waveguide geometry and metamaterial parameters may be selected to engineer the lined waveguide’s spectral response.

50|$|The {{development}} of radio communication initially {{occurred at the}} lower frequencies because these could be more easily propagated over large distances. The long wavelengths made these frequencies unsuitable for use in hollow metal waveguides because of the impractically large diameter tubes required. Consequently, research into hollow metal waveguides stalled {{and the work of}} Lord Rayleigh was forgotten for a time and had to be rediscovered by others. Practical investigations resumed in the 1930s by George C. Southworth at Bell Labs and Wilmer L. Barrow at MIT. Southworth at first took the theory from papers on waves in dielectric rods because the work of Lord Rayleigh was unknown to him. This misled him somewhat; some of his experiments failed because he was not aware of the phenomenon of waveguide cutoff frequency found in Lord Rayleigh's work. Serious theoretical work was taken up by John R. Carson and Sallie P. Mead.
