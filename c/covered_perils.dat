40|$|Business {{interruption}} insurance {{often referred}} to as lost profit or loss income insurance is written and purchased to protect a business for when its operations are interrupted and income is reduced due to the occurrence of a <b>covered</b> <b>peril.</b> The determination of the actual economic loss can be difficult and controversial. The loss computation depends on the determination of what the sales would have been had there been no loss event and what expenses should be subtracted from the estimated sales. In this paper, we discuss the issues with business interruption claims, and theoretically correct approach to measure a firm’s loss due to an interruption in operations from a <b>covered</b> <b>peril.</b> We present an example showing calculation of economic loss due to business interruptions...|$|R

For the purpose of highlighting the common individualities regarding the configuration of the catastrophe bonds, there are recognized homogenous groups in terms of <b>covered</b> <b>perils</b> and size of the each CB tranche, while emphasizing some stringent aspects linked to their trigger mechanism (like the basis risk), their rating, or tenor. The research identifies several profiles regarding the structural {{characteristics of the}} CB during the entire analysed period (1999 - 2014) and the main periods of development of the market.

40|$|Political risk {{insurance}} {{is concerned with}} the risk associated with government intervention and restriction of trade into emerging markets. It may encompass long-term perils (investment related), such as the confiscation, expropriation or nationalization of an infrastructure project in an emerging market or short term perils (export trade related), such as contract frustration, embargo or currency inconvertibility. Today exposure to the political will of a host country is being challenged by economic events blurring the landscape for political risk, which is creating a growing need for better informed econometrics, and advanced analysis of risk vs. reward, as well as a broader interpretation of <b>covered</b> <b>perils</b> and events. The need for reinsurance capacity in Political Risk is higher {{than it has been in}} a decade. However, more and more reinsurers are either restricting the coverage or entirely leaving the practice. This paper proposes an objective reinsurance pricing methodology to assess the risk of writing a large political risk reinsurance portfolio based on country risk ratings, sovereign ceilings, political risk default rates and severity assumptions based on historical data. The paper also incorporates a mechanism to indicate the effects of regional and trade correlations based on the advanced credit modeling. Having such an objective methodology to assess the risk of reinsuring political risk should broaden support from traditional reinsurance markets and attract risk capital from the capital markets...|$|E

40|$|Wind Versus Water: Why ‘Proximate Cause’ Should Help, Not Hurt, Policyholders Who Seek Coverage for Hurricane Claims” {{examines}} {{the clash between}} the “efficient proximate cause” doctrine of insurance law, which holds that coverage exists if the dominant cause of a loss is a <b>covered</b> <b>peril,</b> with the now-ubiquitous “anti-concurrent causation clauses” added to homeowners’ and business insurance policies, which exclude coverage for damages caused by a named event (such as flood) “regardless of any other cause or event that contributes concurrently or in any sequence to the loss. ” The article reviews various state laws and court rulings that have placed some restraint on insurance companies’ drive to evade coverage for disasters by multiplying exclusions and construing those exclusions as broadly as possible...|$|R
40|$|As {{a result}} of the 1906 {{earthquake}} and fire in San Francisco which destroyed the city, a clause known as the “ensuing loss” clause was created to address concurrent causation situations in which a loss follows both a <b>covered</b> <b>peril</b> and an excluded peril. Ensuing loss clauses appear in the exclusions section of such policies and in essence they provide that coverage for a loss caused by an excluded <b>peril</b> is nonetheless <b>covered</b> if the loss “ensues” from a <b>covered</b> <b>peril.</b> Today, ensuing loss clauses are found in “all risk” property and homeowners policies, which cover all losses except for losses caused by perils that are expressly excluded. A century after its creation, the clause often has been overlooked in cases in which it may have been applicable, and when it has been considered, it has confused and divided the courts. The courts’ inconsistent interpretation and application of the clause creates inefficiencies in the legal system because it is harder to settle cases that have: (1) unpredictable outcomes and (2) factual disputes regarding causation that must be resolved by juries at trial instead of judges as a matter of law. Thus, the parties and courts unnecessarily spend more time and resources on such cases. This Article claims: (1) the ensuing loss clause overrides anti-concurrent causation exclusions and (2) the courts’ confusion in interpreting and applying the clause has arisen due to the courts’ misunderstanding of the origins and purpose of the clause and their mistaken incorporation of theoretical tort causation concepts such as “efficient proximate cause” into the clause instead of applying the contractual rules of policy interpretation to the clause. The Article then proposes an interpretation of the clause that should lead to more predictable, consistent outcomes and the efficient resolution of claims...|$|R

50|$|In {{insurance}}, {{the insurance}} {{policy is a}} contract (generally a standard form contract) between the insurer and the insured, known as the policyholder, which determines the claims which the insurer is legally required to pay.

Subsequently, a marketplace for fire insurance for buildings on land arose, especially after the Great Fire of London in 1666.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that 'all-risk' {{policies}} do not actually <b>cover</b> all <b>perils.</b> The liability of the insurer in such cases is consequently not absolute. Certain 'self-evident' exclusions, in fact, exist {{in the case of the}} liability of the insurer in an 'all risk' policy. Despite the fact that the insured procured an 'all-risk' policy, an insurer would not be liable to compensate the insured for damages resulting from all occurrences. It is crucial that the precise content and meaning of terms and especially 'wear and tear', 'leakage', 'breakage', 'inherent vice', 'latent defect' and 'defective packaging' be clear. It appears that the South African law of insurance blindly follows the English law. As a result, the potentially problematic interpretation incidental to English law is incorporated into South African insurance law. An example of this problem situation is the current interpretation of 'inherent vice' and 'defective packaging'. In English law, these terms are interpreted as being the same. It is submitted, however, that the defective packaging of a product should not be construed as an inherent vice of that product. The implication of this submission is not that an insurer should be held liable, but that the combination of these concepts as having the same meaning is not technically correct in law. In similar vein, the South African courts also follow the English courts in their superfluous distinction between 'normal' and 'abnormal' wear and tear, as well as 'normal' and 'abnormal' leakag...|$|R
40|$|The Life Insurance delineates {{de facto}} that {{specific}} contract {{through which the}} insurer, if given a warranty premium, relegates himself to the underwriter to pay off a stipulated sum {{to the benefit of}} the latter, the discharge of this commitment depending on the life of the insured. Individual insurance bonds do <b>cover</b> those <b>perils</b> liable to act upon the very person of the insured, and aim at the life (i. e. life insurance contracts) or else the somatic integrity (accident and health insurance covenants) of the warrantee. They are characterized by the lump drafting of the guaranteed, contract – stipulated pre – chartered amounts. Life insurance agreements are elaborate, as combining an insurance operation aiming at the eventuality of a risk occurrence, and an investment deal circumscribed by the capitalization process. The solicitor (i. e. the contractor) is literally the partaker bound to the insurer via the commitment to pay the insurance premiums. The appellant ought to possess the juridical capacity to contract, in terms of being either a physical or a legal person. The insured participator is the individual pertained to by the underwritten risk. The insurance beneficiary is the physical or the legal person applied for to benefit by the insurance contract. The unfolding of the insurance contract depends on the life of the insured partaker, a clear – cut distinction being easily operated among the following covenant types: insurance in case of survival; decease insurance; commingled insurance; ancillary insurance...|$|R

40|$|The {{state of}} the world’s oceans has reached a tipping point. Never before in human history has the planet’s most {{important}} habitat been in such <b>peril.</b> <b>Covering</b> roughly seventy per cent of the earth’s surface, the oceans control the planet’s climate; produce approximately eighty per cent of its oxygen; and serve as {{the primary source of}} food for over a billion people. In spite of the apparent immensity of the world’s oceans, what was once considered inexhaustible and resilient has become finite and fragile. From the disappearance of fish stocks and coral reefs, to the growing threats of climate change, global warming, rising sea levels and the increasing pressure of excessive human use is destroying ocean life and vital coastal habitats. Making matters worse are the rising threats of maritime piracy and terrorism, which pose a significant threat to global trade and security, along with the Westphalian state’s monopoly of force itself. In short, if current trends continue, {{and if there is a}} failure to responsibly govern the world’s oceans, there is risk of much greater problems in the near future, coming at a much accelerated pace.

40|$|Maritime {{transportation}} {{is the oldest}} of the transportation forms of moving larger quantities of cargo with long tradition and culture. As ancient as the transport at sea, so is also the history of pirates. Some say that they should be regarded as a “necessary evil”, {{the other side of the}} shield that creates a balance in the world, others merely accept the presence. In any event it creates the background for fascination and intrigue, even though the brutality in reality is extensive. This elucidates the need for knowledge of which challenges this problem creates, and this thesis will look upon this in relation to marine insurance. Also, the difference between piracy and armed robbery both in international law and Norwegian marine insurance has been looked into. After researching the subject, the difficulties of separating the terms piracy and armed robbery became more pronounced. It was therefore necessary to look further into these in an international and domestic perspective. Particularly it became important to find out more about how it would be treated in Norwegian marine insurance. When establishing the difference in cover between hull and war insurance, the two main insurances a vessel signs, the discussion of piracy and armed robbery is very important. As the war insurer mainly covers piracy, but will not take responsibility in cases of armed robbery, the hull insurer is possibly the one covering the latter. This separation also influences the other insurers, at least the P&I and loss of hire insurer, as neither of these <b>cover</b> war <b>perils</b> as a starting point. In the situations regarded as piracy, the war insurer will have to cover losses from all insurances, while if armed robbery, the cover will be exactly the same as if it had been another crime. The cover from hull, war, P&I, loss of hire and cargo insurance regarding both piracy and armed robbery is included. The last part of the thesis describes a real case from 1999, the situation of Alondra Rainbow. The vessel was hijacked by pirates in the Strait of Malacca while steaming. After a few weeks a vessel matching the description of the vessel, but with another name, was observed in Indian waters and the Indian Coast Guard was alerted. This proved to be the first case ever where UNCLOS’ encouragement to intercept a vessel hijacked by pirates, was used and the pirates was convicted afterwards in a country with no relation to the attacked ship. This particular case is thereafter looked upon from a Norwegian marine insurance view. The final outcome of this thesis is that there would be beneficial for the marine insurance industry to look further into, and perhaps create some guidelines as to how to handle cases in the grey zone between piracy and armed robbery...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the thesis is to compare the rules on causation and incidence of loss from a hull insurance perspective in the Nordic countries. As a consequence of there being underlying differences in how these questions are resolved, it therefore results in an interesting comparison. In addition, {{in light of the}} proposal of a common Marine Insurance Plan for the entire Nordic market a comparison is relevant for the same reasons. In the Norwegian Marine Insurance Plan the scope of the insurers liability when <b>covered</b> and uncovered <b>perils</b> have contributed to a loss is based on an apportionment principle, cf. § NMIP 2 - 13. This solution is unique in relation to the corresponding rules in the Nordic Countries, which operate with the dominant cause principle. However, the NMIP was used as a prototype to the revision of the Finnish Marine Hull Conditions (FHC) in the year of 2001. As a result, today the FHC has a corresponding rule of apportionment. Nevertheless, an exception is made to the apportionment principle when the loss is attributed to a combination of marine and war perils. In this case the starting point is the dominant cause principle as well. Another question related to causation arises in cases where a loss is caused by a peril that {{can be traced back to}} a previous insurance period. According to the NMIP § 2 - 11 first subparagraph the liability of the insurer is triggered when the interest insured is struck by an insured peril during the insurance period. The starting point is thus a peril has struck principle which is a different point of departure to the damage principle which the remaining Nordic countries operate with. The approach to the question of causation and incidences of loss differ within the Nordic countries. These differences may provide implications both in changing between the insurance conditions and with an implementation of a common Nordic Marine Insurance Plan. The question to be answered is what the differences really are, their impact and which solution would be best suited for the whole common Nordic marine insurance market. Although an all comprehensive comparison between the Nordic rules of marine insurance would be both interesting and relevant at time, the aim of this work will be limited to compare and analyse the selected sections from a hull insurance perspective. Focus is foremost put on a comparison between the relevant Swedish and Norwegian rules...|$|R
