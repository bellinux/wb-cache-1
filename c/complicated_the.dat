5|$|On 19 September 1957, the US {{conducted}} the first contained underground test at the Nevada Test Site, codenamed Rainier. The Rainier shot <b>complicated</b> <b>the</b> {{push for a}} comprehensive test ban, as underground tests could not be as easily identified as atmospheric tests.|$|E
5|$|Emmendingen {{lies in the}} Elz valley, which {{winds through}} the Black Forest. The Elz creates a series of hanging valleys which {{challenge}} the passage of large bodies of troops; the rainy weather further <b>complicated</b> <b>the</b> passage through the Elz valley. The area around Riegel am Kaiserstuhl is noted for its loess and narrow transition points, which greatly influenced the battle.|$|E
5|$|For {{both sexes}} clothes were tight-fitted, and narrow waists and wrists were appreciated. The silhouettes for grown men and young girls {{emphasized}} wide shoulders and narrowed to the waist; the silhouettes for female aristocrats were more <b>complicated.</b> <b>The</b> Sogdian clothing underwent a thorough process of Islamization {{in the ensuing}} centuries, with few of the original elements remaining. In their stead, turbans, kaftans, and sleeved coats became more common.|$|E

5|$|Machinery {{problems}} {{were likely to}} delay the ships well past their intended delivery dates of 1943–44. Three turbines were delivered by Brown Boveri in 1939 to Arkhangelsk for the Sovetskaya Rossiya, but the Kharkhovskii Turbogenerator Works never completed a single turbine before the German invasion in June 1941. A prototype boiler {{was supposed to have}} been built ashore for evaluation, but it was not completed until early 1941, which further <b>complicated</b> <b>the</b> production plan.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{designated}} the TB-7, the aircraft was renamed the Pe-8 after its primary designer, Vladimir Petlyakov, {{died in a}} plane crash in 1942. Supply problems <b>complicated</b> <b>the</b> aircraft's production and the Pe-8s also had engine problems. As Soviet morale boosters, they were also high-value targets for the Luftwaffe's fighter pilots. The loss rate of these aircraft, whether from mechanical failure, friendly fire, or combat, doubled between 1942 and 1944.|$|E
5|$|The {{logistical}} {{demands of}} the surrender were formidable. After Japan's capitulation, more than 5,400,000 Japanese soldiers and 1,800,000 Japanese sailors were taken prisoner by the Allies. The damage done to Japan's infrastructure, combined with a severe famine in 1946, further <b>complicated</b> <b>the</b> Allied efforts to feed the Japanese POWs and civilians.|$|E

5|$|The long-running HUG process <b>complicated</b> <b>the</b> RAAF's {{management}} of its fleet of F/A-18s. At any one time, {{the capabilities of}} individual aircraft differed considerably depending on their upgrades. Accordingly, the long-standing arrangement where aircraft were almost permanently assigned to each squadron {{was replaced by a}} system where they were pooled. Attempts to allocate Hornets with similar levels of modifications from the common pool to each squadron were not successful.|$|E
5|$|The mid-engine <b>complicated</b> <b>the</b> {{design of}} the four-wheel drive system, and an {{innovative}} solution was needed to get drive {{from the rear of}} the engine to the front wheels. The chosen design took the front-wheel drive from the central differential on the rear transaxle and sent it through the V in the centre of the engine using a quill drive, before joining an inverted differential. The clutch was a twin-plate unit designed by AP Racing.|$|E
5|$|The {{project was}} plagued with {{problems}} from the outset. The first was scope. President Kennedy had begun considering {{the structure of}} his library soon after taking office, {{and he wanted to}} include archives from his administration, a museum of personal items, and a political science institute. After the assassination, the list expanded to include a fitting memorial tribute to the slain president. The variety of necessary inclusions <b>complicated</b> <b>the</b> design process and caused significant delays.|$|E

5|$|The slight {{radioactivity}} of rubidium {{was discovered}} in 1908, {{but that was before}} the theory of isotopes was established in 1910, and the low level of activity (half-life greater than 1010years) made interpretation <b>complicated.</b> <b>The</b> now proven decay of 87Rb to stable 87Sr through beta decay was still under discussion in the late 1940s.|$|E
5|$|As a start, the {{spectrum}} of HAT-P-33 was composed using the digital speedometer at the 1.5-meter Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory in Arizona. The collected data found that the star was a single dwarf star exhibiting a slight rotation. Several of its parameters, including its effective temperature and surface gravity, were found. Additionally, the SOPHIE échelle spectrograph at a 1.93-meter telescope at France's Haute-Provence Observatory was used to observe the star. The resulting data invited the possibility that radial velocity measurements, which can exhibit anomalies that often indicate {{the presence of a}} planet, may have been because of background distortion (and not a planet). This possibility significantly <b>complicated</b> <b>the</b> ability of scientists to verify this planet. After the observations, follow-ups were postponed for several years.|$|E
5|$|Engine supply {{problems}} <b>complicated</b> <b>the</b> {{construction of}} the aircraft. Production of the ATsN superchargers could not be organized in any systematic way and only the first four Pe-8s were equipped with them. Factory No. 124 shut down its Pe-8 production line {{at the beginning of}} 1940 while alternative engines were evaluated. Somewhere in the massive Soviet chain of command, {{the decision was made to}} proceed without the superchargers. The unavailability of the Klimov M-100 engine of the ATsN-2 installation required a design change, although this modification allowed a commander and radio operator to be carried in its place. Then, to compound the problem further, the production of AM-34FRNV engines ended in the second half of 1939. Only two or four Pe-8s were equipped with them. Eighteen of the aircraft produced by the end of 1940 were fitted with AM-35A engines.|$|E

5|$|In 2001, Martin {{was still}} {{optimistic that the}} fourth {{installment}} might be released {{in the last quarter}} of 2002. However, the five-year gap did not work for all characters during writing. On one hand, Martin was unsatisfied with covering the events during the gap solely through flashbacks and internal retrospection. On the other hand, it was implausible to have nothing happen for five years. After working on the book for about a year, Martin realized he needed an additional interim book, which he called A Feast for Crows. The book would pick up the story immediately after the third book, and Martin scrapped the idea of a five-year gap. The material of the written 250-page prologue was mixed in as new viewpoint characters from Dorne and the Iron Islands. These expanded storylines and the resulting story interactions <b>complicated</b> <b>the</b> plot for Martin.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to {{problems with the}} terminal building, both the airport's location and surrounding infrastructure were {{the subject of much}} complaint as well. For one, although some 1,700 cars visited the airport daily, the parking lot had only 129 slots, and could not be expanded any further. The airport complex likewise was located directly alongside major city thoroughfares, in particular the city's main highway, the Tomas Confesor Highway, which <b>complicated</b> <b>the</b> flow of traffic in and around the area. At one point, the ATO, which was already having difficulty managing vehicular traffic around the airport, proposed banning cargo and delivery trucks from passing through the road in front of the terminal building. However, the city government did not respond.|$|E
5|$|Kumar {{requested}} Nagarjuna a year's time {{to complete}} and provide the finishing touches to the script. The latter read the script to director K. Raghavendra Rao, who suggested Kumar develop a simpler version, as the original was too <b>complicated.</b> <b>The</b> rewritten version was read to Nagarjuna in {{two and a half}} hours and to Nageswara Rao over six hours, as the latter wanted every detail to be clear. Due to the complex nature of the second half, the latter suggested Kumar to add a comedy plotline between grandfather and grandson. After its incorporation into the script, and after considering the titles Hum and Trayam, Manam was chosen as the film's title on Nageswara Rao's suggestion.|$|E

5|$|On top of {{the failure}} of the franchises to approve the spin-off, a series of {{lawsuits}} <b>complicated</b> <b>the</b> divestiture. Two legal challenges to the parent company were filed by investors, one in Pillsbury's home state of Minnesota and another in the state where it was incorporated, Delaware, in which the legality of the stock tender plan was questioned. These three events eventually forced Pillsbury to give up its bid to fend off Grand Metropolitan and agree to be acquired in November 1988 for a sum of US$5.7 billion.|$|E
5|$|Several {{other factors}} <b>complicated</b> <b>the</b> rise of {{nationalism}} in the German states. The man-made factors included political rivalries {{between members of}} the German confederation, particularly between the Austrians and the Prussians, and socio-economic competition among the commercial and merchant interests and the old land-owning and aristocratic interests. Natural factors included widespread drought in the early 1830s, {{and again in the}} 1840s, and a food crisis in the 1840s. Further complications emerged {{as a result of a}} shift in industrialization and manufacturing; as people sought jobs, they left their villages and small towns to work during the week in the cities, returning for a day and a half on weekends.|$|E
5|$|The 15th Avenue Northeast {{site for}} the University District's station was {{rejected}} {{in favor of an}} option on Brooklyn Avenue. The placement of the Brooklyn station, either on the north or south side of NE 45th Street, was debated by the Sound Transit Board in 2004. Seattle mayor Greg Nickels favored a station on the north side, but other boardmembers sided with community and business groups who wanted a site on the south side. The station site was further <b>complicated</b> <b>the</b> following year by Safeco's decision to expand its headquarters building {{on the west side of}} Brooklyn Avenue NE, impacting staging areas that were selected by Sound Transit. Ultimately, Safeco moved its headquarters to a downtown building in 2006, and sold the Brooklyn building to the University of Washington, and the staging areas remained available.|$|E
