40|$|Abstract. Color bar signal {{generator}} {{is one of}} the most important measurements for PAL TV applications. However, its use in resource constrained applications such as color TV video adjustment is limited because of the high architecture complexity involved. Due to the broad range of applications presently offered by FPGA (filed programmable gate array), their use has become increasingly widespread in different areas and sectors. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a color bar {{signal generator}} based on FPGA and MC 1377 with a high performance and low system complexity. The FPGA technology proved to be a proper platform to meet these two contrasting requirements. The signal structure, generation principle, and FPGA implementation of <b>composite</b> <b>PAL</b> synchronize <b>signal</b> and RGB color signal are described. The interface circuits, hardware and software of the system are introduced. The software is simulated using MAXplus platform. Simulation results indicate the effectiveness and stability of the signal generator...|$|R
50|$|D2 is {{a digital}} video tape format created by Ampex and other {{manufacturers}} (through a standards group of SMPTE) and introduced at the 1988 NAB (National Association of Broadcasters) convention as a lower-cost {{alternative to the}} D-1 format. Like D-1, D-2 video is uncompressed; however, it saves bandwidth and other costs by sampling a fully encoded NTSC or <b>PAL</b> <b>composite</b> video <b>signal,</b> and storing it directly to magnetic tape, rather than sampling component video. This is known as digital composite.|$|R

50|$|MineCam 2 used {{parts from}} a disused Sony 'Handycam.' The colour CCD chip was removed {{and put in}} a round tobacco tin {{connected}} by a short cable {{to the rest of the}} electronics in a small Eddystone die-cast box. The 'Eddy box' contained extra hardware to convert the Y/C (700 kHz) direct colour-under output to <b>composite</b> <b>PAL,</b> and provide various unusual power supply voltages. Because of the colour stripe filter and the early technology, this CCD was only as sensitive as the monochrome vidicon.|$|R
5000|$|When testing with PAL, {{the colour}} {{subcarrier}} was 2.66034375 MHz and the sidebands of the <b>PAL</b> <b>signal</b> {{had to be}} truncated on the high-frequency side at +330 kHz (matching the rolloff of the luminance signal at +3.0 MHz). On the low-frequency side, a full 1.0 MHz sideband was radiated. ( [...] This behaviour would cause massive U/V crosstalk in the NTSC system, but delay-line PAL hides such artefacts. [...] ) ...|$|R

It calculates the user’s command collected from the remote console or proximal control box and sends commands to the robot vehicle and cable delivery equipment. Each device in the cabinet has its special purpose. Of course, the main program runs on one small industrial personal computer (IPC). Since the <b>PAL</b> video <b>signal</b> from the robot vehicle cannot be used directly, a hardware driver is needed to convert the <b>PAL</b> <b>signal</b> into digital format for further use.

25|$|Sony added TV {{output to}} the PSP Slim through Firmware update 3.60. It can output in a {{conventional}} aspect ratio (4:3) or widescreen (16:9), and offers a screensaver if the PSP is inactive for a set amount of time. It is able to output games, videos, and other media. To achieve TV output on the Slim model, Composite, S-Video, Component (YPBPR) and D-Terminal (YPBPR) cables are sold separately by Sony. PSP format games are output as a progressive scan signal, which can be carried only by the Component and D-Terminal cables, and displayed on televisions which support progressive scan. They are also rendered at the 480×272 resolution of the PSP screen, rather than the 720×480 resolution used for output, and are not upscaled, meaning that they are displayed with black windowboxing when viewed to an external display. This can be overcome on some TVs by using built-in zoom functionality. However, the PSP system software, music player and video playback are displayed in full-screen. As of firmware update 5.00, PlayStation (PSone) format software purchased from the PlayStation store is output in full-screen mode and optionally in interlaced format for non-progressive displays. The maximum resolution through TV output is 720×480 pixels and composite video uses NTSC color encoding (no <b>PAL</b> <b>composite</b> <b>signal</b> is available; European TVs must be NTSC compatible {{to be used with}} a PSP via composite). The old PSP-1000 model is not capable of this feature due to a slightly different port. As a result, original PSP accessories (using the connector) will not work with the Slim and the Slim's accessories will not work with the original PSP. Sony released {{a new version of the}} remote control accessory designed for the Slim as a result. The PSP Slim can still use 3.5mm headphones, like the old PSP-1000. The Serial Port is not available on the PSP-E1000, thus it can't have TV-output and remote controls connected.|$|R

50|$|As {{an added}} bonus, {{due to the}} {{increased}} bandwidth of S-VHS, teletext data (<b>PAL)</b> <b>signals</b> can be recorded along with the normal video signal. As a result, this teletext data is also able to be decoded and displayed on-screen as an overlay of the conventional TV picture (though not on standard VHS machines). A suitably teletext-equipped receiver/decoder (TV, PC card, etc.) displays the recorded teletext data information as if the video were being viewed as a real-time live broadcast.|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of colour {{television in the}} 1950 's was an impressive achievement producing a full colour picture on new receivers whilst maintaining substantially complete compatibility with monochrome receivers. This was achieved by placing two colour difference signals {{on top of the}} existing monochrome (luminance) signal. The disadvantage of the technique was the lack of full separability of the signals in the receiver, resulting in signal cross-effects and some loss of picture quality. Although acceptable at the time of introduction improving source quality (due to improved cameras, digital sources, and improved recording) coupled with increasing quality expectations has caused these artefacts to become more noticeable and less acceptable. Consequently considerable work in the last twenty five years has concentrated on finding improved encoding and decoding techniques for creating compatible <b>PAL</b> <b>signals.</b> Unfortunately until very recently with the {{introduction of}} PAL plus no satisfactory solution had been agreed upon. Work in the field has been made difficult through the complexities of the multi-dimensional <b>PAL</b> <b>signal,</b> the lack of common framework, and the difficulty of assessment and comparison. This thesis provides new work in several areas in the field of enhanced-PAL coding including: i) the development of a complete multi-dimensional representation for a television coding system, ii) the description of a new technique for determining the spatio-temporal characteristics of coding systems, iii) the description and application of a new approach to objective quality assessment, and iv) the detailed study of a new improved PAL coding technique. This thesis also i) provides comprehensive background on the multi-dimensional interpretation of the <b>PAL</b> <b>signal</b> and television coding techniques, ii) develops a model for the human visual system chrominance threshold response, iii) places all current enhanced PAL coding techniques into a common theoretical framework, and iv) provides a detailed mathematical analysis of WC-PAL. Work on all these areas was greatly assisted through the development by the author of a multi-dimensional graphical interface (PHIGSdraw) and image processing system (TVPROC) ...|$|R

In the ITT 2020, the crystal frequency was divided by 17 to give the microprocessor a clock frequency of 1.042 MHz. In the Apple II, the frequency was divided by 14 to give a microprocessor clock frequency of 1.023 MHz.|$|R

Two other connectors provided a centronics compatible printer port, (supported by Basic with LPRINT, LLIST and HCOPY, a [...] "screen dump" [...] command) and an expansion interface port. The expansion port connector also had signal lines for an RS232 serial connection which Basic supported with several commands, but its main use was to connect a 5¼-inch floppy disk drive.|$|R

Parallax thus makes sample code available which can generate video signals (text and somewhat low-resolution graphics) using a minimum parts count consisting of the Propeller, a crystal oscillator, and a few resistors to form a crude digital-to-analog converter (DAC). The frequency of the oscillator is important, as the correction ability of the video timing hardware {{is limited to the}} clock rate. It is possible to use multiple cogs in parallel to generate a single video signal. More generally, the timing hardware can be used to implement various pulse-width modulation (PWM) timing signals.|$|R

40|$|The Aspergillus nidulans pH-responsive {{transcription}} factor PacC is modulated by limited, two-step proteolysis. The first, pH-regulated cleavage {{occurs in the}} 24 -residue highly conserved “signaling protease box” {{in response to the}} alkaline pH signal. This is transduced by the <b>Pal</b> <b>signaling</b> pathway, containing the predicted calpain-like cysteine protease and likely signaling protease, PalB. In this work, we carried out classical mutational analysis of the putative signaling protease PalB, and we describe 9 missense and 18 truncating loss-of-function (including null) mutations. Mutations in the region of and affecting directly the predicted catalytic cysteine strongly support the deduction that PalB is a cysteine protease. Truncating and missense mutations affecting the C terminus highlight the importance of this region. Analysis of three-hemagglutinin-tagged PalB in Western blots demonstrates that PalB levels are independent of pH and <b>Pal</b> <b>signal</b> transduction. We have followed the processing of MYC 3 -tagged PacC in Western blots. We show unequivocally that PalB is essential for signaling proteolysis and is definitely not the processing protease. In addition, we have replaced 15 residues of the signaling protease box of MYC 3 -tagged PacC (pacC 900) with alanine. The majority of these substitutions are silent. Leu 481 Ala, Tyr 493 Ala, and Gln 499 Ala result in delayed PacC processing in response to shifting from acidic to alkaline medium, as determined by Western blot analysis. Leu 498 Ala reduces function much more markedly, as determined by plate tests and processing recalcitrance. Excepting Leu 498, this demonstrates that PacC signaling proteolysis is largely independent of sequence in the cleavage region...|$|R

2500|$|A {{standard}} <b>PAL</b> <b>signal</b> contains 625 {{lines of}} video data per screen, broken into two [...] "fields" [...] containing half {{the lines of}} the whole image, divided as every odd line, then every even line number.

CEPT1 hides the data in these lines, where they are not visible, using lines 6–22 on the first field and 318–335 on the second field. The system does not have to use all of these lines; a unique pattern of bits allows the decoder to identify which lines contain data. Some teletext services use a great number of lines, others, for reasons of bandwidth and technical issues, use fewer.|$|R

50|$|In 4:2:0, the {{horizontal}} sampling is doubled compared to 4:1:1, {{but as the}} Cb and Cr channels are only sampled on each alternate line in this scheme, the vertical resolution is halved. The data rate is thus the same. This fits reasonably well with the PAL color encoding system since this has only half the vertical chrominance resolution of NTSC. It would also fit extremely well with the SECAM color encoding system since like that format, 4:2:0 only stores and transmits one color channel per line (the other channel being recovered from the previous line). However, little equipment has actually been produced that outputs a SECAM analogue video signal.

40|$|This paper {{treats the}} problem of digital TV {{terrestrial}} broadcasting in presence of co-channel interference from analogue TV services. The channel capacity is calculated for the optimum distribution of the transmitted power. An OFDM scheme is presented {{which is designed to}} be robust to the analogue TV interference. Power and number of bits per symbol are assigned to each OFDM channel to give the maximum data rate for a given signal to interference ratio. Simulations of the proposed scheme, for 8 MHz bandwidth and interference from a system G <b>PAL</b> <b>signal,</b> show that acceptable error rate can be achieved for e. g. 27 Mbit/s at a signal to interference ratio of- 6 dB.
