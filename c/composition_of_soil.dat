25|$|Hydrogen {{and oxygen}} {{isotopes}} also work as tracers for water budget in terrestrial reservoirs, including lakes, rivers, groundwater and soil water. For a lake, both {{the amount of}} water in the lake and the isotopic composition of the water are determined by a balance between inputs (precipitation, stream and ground water inflow) and outputs (evaporation, stream and ground water outflow). The isotopic composition of lake water can often be used to track evaporation, which causes isotope enrichment in the lake water, as well as a δD-δ18O slope that is shallower than the meteoric water line. The isotopic composition of river water is highly variable and have complicated sources over different timescales, but can generally be treated as a two-endmember mixing problem, a base-flow endmember (mainly ground water recharge) and an overland-flow endmember (mainly storm events). The isotope data suggest that the long-term integrated base-flow endmember is more important in most rivers, even during peak flows in summer. Systematic river isotope data were collected across the world by the Global Network of Isotopes in Rivers (GNIR).The isotopic composition of groundwater {{can also be used to}} trace its sources and flow paths. An example is a groundwater isotope mapping study in Sacramento, California, which showed lateral flow of river water with a distinct isotope composition into the groundwater that developed a significant water table depression due to pumping for human use. The same study also showed an isotopic signal of agricultural water being recharged into the giant alluvial aquifer in California's Central Valley. Finally, the isotopic <b>composition</b> <b>of</b> <b>soil</b> water is important for the study of plants. Below the water table, the soil has a relatively constant source of water with a certain isotopic composition. Above the water table, the isotopic <b>composition</b> <b>of</b> <b>soil</b> water is enriched by evaporation until a maximum at the surface. The vertical profile of isotopic <b>composition</b> <b>of</b> <b>soil</b> water is maintained by the diffusion of both liquid and vapor water. A comparison of soil water and plant xylem water δD can be used to infer the depth at which plant roots get water from the soil.|$|E

Isotopic <b>compositions</b> <b>of</b> <b>soil</b> water near soil surface become isotopically heavy because of the evaporation in particular summer season, thus the isotopic heavy peak is formed near the soil surface. In fall season, there is strongly rainfall {{by a number of}} typhoons and autumn rain fronts, so relatively large amount of precipitation are supplied to the soil. At that time, the cyclic variations of the isotopes in soil water move downward wholly, but when rainfall is relatively small amount, the cyclic variations do not move clearly. This result indicate that the recharge occurs only after intense rainfall events of typhoons or autumn rain front. And {{as a result of the}} stable isotopic <b>compositions</b> <b>of</b> <b>soil</b> water and groundwater, the piston flow is dominantly in the soil water movement in TERC.
