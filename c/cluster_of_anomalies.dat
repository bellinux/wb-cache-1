Evidence ofgeographic clustering uas evaluated by distribution of individual cases using zip codes of maternal residence. Potential temporal <b>clustering</b> <b>of</b> <b>anomalies</b> was sought by tabulating the frequency <b>of</b> each <b>anomaly</b> category during 5 consecutive 2 -year intervals between 1992 and 2001.

40|$|Abstract Background Environmental {{pollution}} {{as a cause}} <b>of</b> congenital <b>anomalies</b> {{is sometimes}} suspected because <b>of</b> <b>clustering</b> <b>of</b> <b>anomalies</b> in areas <b>of</b> higher exposure. This highlights questions around spatial heterogeneity (clustering) in congenital anomaly rates. If spatial variation is endemic, then any one specific cluster is less remarkable, though the presence <b>of</b> uncontrolled geographically <b>clustered</b> risk factors is suggested. If rates are relatively homogeneous across space other than around specific hazards, then evidence for these hazards causing the clusters is strengthened. We sought to estimate the extent of spatial heterogeneity in congenital anomaly rates in the United Kingdom. Methods The study population covered about one million births from five registers in Britain from 1991 – 1999. We estimated heterogeneity across four geographical levels: register area, hospital catchment, electoral ward, and enumeration district, using a negative binomial regression model. We also sought clusters using a circular scan statistic. Results Congenital anomaly rates clearly varied across register areas and hospital catchments (p 0. 2). Adjusting for socioeconomic deprivation and maternal age made little difference {{to the extent of}} geographical variation for most congenital anomaly subtypes. The two most significant circular <b>clusters</b> (<b>of</b> four ano-rectal atresias and six congenital heart diseases) contained two or more siblings. Conclusion The variation in rates between registers and hospital catchment area may have resulted in part from differences in case ascertainment, and this should be taken into account in geographical epidemiological studies of environmental exposures. The absence of evidence for variation below this level should be interpreted cautiously in view of the low power of general heterogeneity tests. Nevertheless, the data suggest that strong localised clusters in congenital anomalies are uncommon, so clusters around specific putative environmental hazards are remarkable when observed. Negative binomial models applied at successive hierarchical levels provide an approach of intermediate complexity to characterising geographical heterogeneity. </p...|$|R

Some of the setbacks to successful geochemical exploration may be ascribed {{to the use of}} various partial extraction techniques,without a profound understanding of the regolith components and their composition. This investigation therefore focuses on the use of hydroxylamine partial extraction geochemistry for geochemical mapping in regolith over two contrasting environments viz; aeolian sand-calcrete regolith over Au mineralization at Amalia Blue Dot Mine in South Africa and lateritic regolith covering the Ni-Cu deposit at Kabanga Main and Luhuma in Tanzania. Regolith samples from the above areas were sieved and extracted with hydroxylamine hydrochloride solution and analyzed for multi-element by AAS and ICP-MS techniques. A stepwise optimization of the hydroxylamine extraction technique of samples from both areas was carried out and incorporated into the analytical programme (in a pilot study). Results of hydroxylamine partial extraction generally gave better anomaly contrast and reflection of bedrock mineralization than the conventional aqua regia techniques that were previously used in the region. The results however show that lateritic regolith may be best extracted using 0. 25 M hydroxylamine while 0. 1 M concentration appears most suitable for extraction of aeolian-calcrete regolith. The above results are corroborated by principal component analysis of the analytical data that show various element associations, e. g. with Fe-Mn oxides while others possibly belong to the loosely adsorbed or exchangeable group. The gochemical maps in the pilot study areas at Amalia, Kabanga and Luhuma show elevated element contents or <b>clusters</b> <b>of</b> <b>anomalies</b> <b>of</b> diverse elements associated with Fe-Mn oxides. Geochemical mapping at Kabanga with deeply concealed mineralization however shows variability of subdued element patterns over mineralized areas. Geochemical signatures associated with hydroxylamine hydrochloride partial leach are therefore characterized by a lower geochemical background than that using conventional aqua regia leach. This study leads recommending for further investigations into partial extraction of the exchangeable group of elements, possibly using ammonium acetate. South Afric...|$|R

Most of the data describes cells with acceptable performance. Detecting and analysing mobile network cells with quality problems from the data stream is a tedious and continuous problem for network operators. Anomaly detection {{can be used to}} identify cells, whose performance deviates from the average and which are potentially having some sub-optimal configuration or are in some error condition. In this paper we provide two methods to detect such anomalously behaving cells. The first method estimates the distance from a cell to an optimal state and the second one is based on detecting the support of the data distribution using One-Class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM). We use the methods to analyse a data sample from a live 3 G network and compare the analysis results.

The activity of m-GDH was measured by both a radioisotopic procedure and colourimetric technique. As judged from these measurements and relative to the paired value for GlDH, the incidence of abnormally low m-GDH activity was significantly higher in type- 2 diabetics than in control subjects. Moreover, the paired ratio in reaction velocity between the colourimetric and radioisotopic assay of m-GDH was abnormally high in patients with low m-GDH activity. Low m-GDH activity often coincided with increased GPT activity in plasma or high GPT/GOT ratio in lymphocytes. No obvious <b>clustering</b> <b>of</b> these <b>anomalies</b> was found in relatives of diabetic patients. These findings suggest that an inherited or acquired genomic defect of m-GDH in lymphocytes, and possibly in pancreatic B-cells, may participate to the pathogenesis of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.

40|$|Remediation of unexploded {{ordnance}} (UXO) and prioritization of excavation {{procedures for}} archaeological artifacts using electromagnetic (EM) induction are studied in this dissertation. Lowering {{of the false}} alarm rates that require excavation and artifact excavation prioritization can reduce {{the costs associated with}} unnecessary procedures. Data were taken over 5 areas at the San Jacinto Battleground near Houston, Texas, using an EM- 63 metal detection instrument. The areas were selected using the archaeological concepts of cultural and natural formation processes applied to what is thought to be areas that were involved in the 1836 Battle of San Jacinto. Innovative use of a Statistical Point Pattern Analysis (PPA) is employed to identify <b>clustering</b> <b>of</b> EM <b>anomalies.</b> The K-function uses point {x,y} data to look for possible clusters in relation to other points in the data set. The clusters once identified using K-function will be further examined for classification and prioritization using the Weighted K-function. The Weighted K-function uses a third variable such as millivolt values or time decay to aid in segregation and prioritization <b>of</b> <b>anomalies</b> present. Once the <b>anomalies</b> <b>of</b> interest are identified, their locations are determined using the Gi-Statistics Technique. The Gi*-Statistic uses the individual Cartesian{x, y} points as origin locations to establish a range of distances to other cluster points in the data set. The segregation and location <b>of</b> <b>anomalies</b> supplied by this analysis will have several benefits. Prioritization of excavations will narrow down what areas should be excavated first. <b>Anomalies</b> <b>of</b> interest can be located to guide excavation procedures within the areas surveyed. Knowing what <b>anomalies</b> are <b>of</b> greater importance than others will help to lower false alarm rates for UXO remediation or for archaeological artifact selection. Knowing significant anomaly location will reduce the number of excavations which will subsequently save time and money. The procedures and analyses presented here are an interdisciplinary compilation of geophysics, archaeology and statistical analysis brought {{together for the first time}} to examine problems associated with UXO remediation as well as archaeological artifact selection at historic battlegrounds using electromagnetic data...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of outlier detection is finding samples considerably deviating from the majority. Such outliers, {{often referred to}} as anomalies, are nowadays more and more important, because they help to uncover interesting events within data. Consequently, a considerable amount of statistical and data mining techniques to identify anomalies was proposed in the last few years, but only a few works at least mentioned why some sample was labelled as an anomaly. Therefore, we propose a method based on specifically trained decision trees, called sapling random forest. Our method is able to interpret the output <b>of</b> arbitrary <b>anomaly</b> detector.

In this study, we hypothesized that neutrophil infiltration into AT may occur at an early stage of MetS in association with modulation of major functions of peripheral neutro-phils and that MetS could alter production of neutrophils by bone marrow.

40|$|BACKGROUND: CHARGE {{syndrome}} is a non-random <b>clustering</b> <b>of</b> congenital <b>anomalies</b> including coloboma, heart defects, choanal atresia, retarded growth and development, genital hypoplasia, ear anomalies, and deafness. A consistent feature in CHARGE {{syndrome is}} semicircular canal hypoplasia resulting in vestibular areflexia. Other commonly associated congenital anomalies are facial nerve palsy, cleft lip/palate, and tracheo-oesophageal fistula. Specific behavioural problems, including autistic-like behaviour, have been described. The CHD 7 gene on chromosome 8 q 12. 1 was recently discovered {{as a major}} gene involved in the aetiology of this syndrome. METHODS: The coding regions of CHD 7 were screened for mutations in 107 index patients with clinical features suggestive of CHARGE syndrome. Clinical data of the mutation positive patients were sampled to study the phenotypic spectrum of mutations in the CHD 7 gene. RESULTS: Mutations were identified in 69 patients. Here we describe the clinical features of 47 of these patients, including two sib pairs. Most mutations were unique and were scattered throughout the gene. All patients but one fulfilled the current diagnostic criteria for CHARGE syndrome. No genotype-phenotype correlations were apparent in this cohort, which is best demonstrated by the differences in clinical presentation in sib pairs with identical mutations. Somatic mosaicism was detected in the unaffected mother of a sib pair, supporting the existence of germline mosaicism. CONCLUSIONS: CHD 7 mutations account {{for the majority of}} the cases with CHARGE syndrome, with a broad clinical variability and without an obvious genotype-phenotype correlation.

40|$|Dieker and Opitz in 1969 {{described}} the simultaneous occurrence of limb deficiencies (LDs) and renal anomalies (RAs) in three patients. Curran and Curran introduced in 1972 the term "acrorenal syndrome. " Since then, the term "acrorenal syndrome" is used occasionally, but a well-circumscribed definition {{has never been}} established. On the other hand, {{the concept of an}} acrorenal polytopic developmental field defect was postulated by Opitz and others to explain the association between RAs and LDs. We undertook this study to investigate whether this acrorenal "syndrome" could be identified in a large group of cases with congenital RAs and a limb deficiency. Eleven birth defect registries {{that are part of the}} International Clearinghouse for Birth Defects Monitoring (i. e., registries of ICBDMS in Finland, France [Paris and Strasbourg], Israel, Italy [IPIMC and Emilia Romagna], Mexico, Northern Netherlands, South America, Spain, and the United States [Atlanta]) provided data on 815 infants who had a LD and at least one other major congenital anomaly. These 815 cases were ascertained among 5, 163, 958 births. We selected the 197 cases who had both a limb deficiency and a renal or urinary tract anomaly. In about 50 % of these cases a diagnosis or a recognized phenotype was reported, with chromosomal aberrations and VACTERL being most frequent.

The framework draws on the Bayesian probabilistic reasoning apparatus which clearly defines concepts such as outlier, noise, distribution drift, novelty detection (object, object primitive), rare events, and unexpected events. Based on these concepts we provide a taxonomy <b>of</b> domain <b>anomaly</b> events. One <b>of</b> the mechanisms helping to pinpoint the nature <b>of</b> <b>anomaly</b> is based on detecting incongruence between contextual and noncontextual sensor(y) data interpretation. The proposed methodology has wide applicability. It underpins in a unified way the anomaly detection applications found in the literature. To illustrate some of its distinguishing features, in here the domain anomaly detection methodology {{is applied to the}} problem <b>of</b> <b>anomaly</b> detection for a video annotation system.
