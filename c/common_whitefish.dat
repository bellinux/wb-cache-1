By {{the middle of}} the 19th century, commercial fishing for <b>common</b> <b>whitefish</b> and lake trout began to replace the fur trade as the island's primary industry. As sport fishing became more popular in the 1880s, hotels and restaurants accommodated tourists coming by train or lake boat from Detroit.|$|E
25|$|The provincial fish is {{the brown}} trout which is found {{together}} with <b>common</b> <b>whitefish,</b> grayling, European perch, Arctic char, burbot, salmon and the carnivorous northern pike. Roughly 250 types of birds {{have been observed}} in Jämtland. The species presence greatly varies, in the fells bluethroat, long-tailed skua, Eurasian dotterel, ptarmigan, Lapland and snow bunting are found. The forested region is inhabited by species such as hazel hen, black grouse, capercaillie, Siberian jay, three-toed woodpecker and rustic bunting. Several different types of owls dwells in the province and the provincial owl is the northern hawk owl.|$|E
2500|$|Fish {{species of}} the gulf include Atlantic salmon, {{viviparous}} eelpout, gobies, belica, loach, European chub, minnow, silver bream, common dace, ruffe, Crucian carp, stickleback, European smelt, common rudd, brown trout, tench, pipefish, burbot, perch, gudgeon, lumpsucker, roach, lamprey, vendace, garfish, <b>common</b> <b>whitefish,</b> common bream, [...] zander, orfe, pike, spined loach, sprat, Baltic herring, sabre carp, common bleak, European eel and Atlantic cod. Commercial fishing is carried out in spring and autumn. Gray seal and ringed seal are met in the gulf, but the latter is very rare.|$|E
5000|$|The name Sperillen {{is derived}} from the Old Norse Sperðill which means [...] "tail" [...] and may refer to the {{elongated}} form of the lake. The lake is well known for its fisheries and is one of only a few in Norway with a commercial fishery. <b>Common</b> species are <b>whitefish,</b> char, European perch and trout, as well as crayfish.|$|R
25|$|Dozens {{of species}} of fish {{have been found in}} the middens. Some of the most <b>common</b> are pike, <b>whitefish,</b> cod and ling at Østenkaer, anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus), three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and eel at Krabbesholm. The oldest site, Yderhede, {{featured}} remains of flatfish and sharks: porbeagle, topeshark, smoothhound and at Lystrup Enge spurdog. At Egsminde herring, cyprinids and European perch were found. The presence of deep-sea fish and sharks probably indicates the Ertebølle fishermen often ventured out on deep water. Whether they did so in their marshland dugouts or also owned larger, ocean-going ones is an answer that waits for more evidence.|$|R
50|$|The Thomsen River on {{northern}} Banks Island {{has been}} described as the most northerly multi-species river in North America. At least three fish species, lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush), least cisco (Coregonus sardinella), and ninespine stickleback (Pungitius pungitius), reach their known northern limit of distribution in the Thomsen River while the Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) is a <b>common</b> species. Lake <b>whitefish</b> (Coregonus clupeaformis) may also occur in upper reaches of the Thomsen and marine fourhorn sculpin (Myoxocephalus quadricornis) are occasionally found in the lower reaches of the river. Approximately one half of the Thomsen River watershed lies within Aulavik National Park.|$|R

50|$|The fera is {{a species}} of {{freshwater}} whitefish that reached a length between 35 and 40 centimetres. It {{is a member of}} the <b>common</b> <b>whitefish</b> complex (Coregonus lavaretus sensu lato).|$|E
50|$|The {{taxonomy}} {{of the genus}} Coregonus is disputed; some authorities assign the gwyniad to the <b>common</b> <b>whitefish</b> (Coregonus lavaretus) complex, whereas FishBase and the IUCN list it as a distinct species, C. pennantii.|$|E
50|$|<b>Common</b> <b>whitefish</b> and {{especially}} vendace from the fresh water lakes in Finland are renowned for the excellent delicate {{taste of the}} roe. Roe is served as topping of toast or on blini with onion and smetana.|$|E
5000|$|The Coregonus {{sardinella}} complex, including C. peled and C. albula. This {{group is}} {{more closely related}} to the [...] "true whitefishes" [...] (e.g. the <b>common</b> <b>whitefish</b> C. lavaretus, lake whitefish C. clupeaformis) than to the C. artedi complex ciscoes.|$|E
50|$|In 1895 {{the brook}} trout was {{introduced}} from Lake Zug, while between 1894 and 1897 the <b>common</b> <b>whitefish</b> was introduced.

50|$|The {{status of}} the gravenche is disputed {{because there are no}} {{specimens}} in museums. While Emile Dottrens described it as subspecies of the <b>common</b> <b>whitefish</b> Coregonus lavaretus in 1958, other experts like Maurice Kottelat regarded it as a full species endemic to Lake Geneva.|$|E
50|$|Species {{found in}} the lake include, pikeperch, <b>common</b> <b>whitefish,</b> brown trout, Arctic char, bleak, chub, Danube roach (Rutilus pigus), common carp, rudd, tench, triotto (Rutilus aula), savetta, or Italian nase (Chondrostoma soetta), twait shad, {{northern}} pike, perch, black bass, pumpkinseed (Lepomis gibbosus), eel and burbot.|$|E
5000|$|In Britain the schelly {{populations are}} usually {{considered}} {{as members of}} the widespread Eurasian whitefish species Coregonus lavaretus, or <b>common</b> <b>whitefish,</b> as with the Welsh gwyniad and Scottish powan. The schelly is however listed as a distinct species of Coregonus, C. stigmaticus, in FishBase and by the IUCN.|$|E
50|$|The lake is ultraoligotrophic but {{supports}} a slow-growing but stable population of some eight species of cold-water fishes, including round whitefish, cisco, and lake trout. Lake trout dominate the lake, both numerically {{and in terms}} of biomass.Other native fish species include <b>common</b> <b>whitefish,</b> Arctic grayling, burbot, longnose sucker, and slimy sculpin.|$|E
50|$|The Lena tugun of Lena River {{drainage}} {{has sometimes}} been distiguished as a distinct subspecies Coregonus tugun lenensis, but is not accepted in current taxonomy. Coregonus tugun is distantly related to all other whitefishes, and may have diverged both from the <b>common</b> <b>whitefish</b> complex and from the Eurasian and American ciscoes already ten million years ago.|$|E
50|$|In the Baltic basin countries, {{this species}} has {{traditionally}} been known as Coregonus lavaretus (the <b>common</b> <b>whitefish).</b> The name Coregonus maraena has been adopted following {{the suggestion that the}} name Coregonus lavaretus should only be applied narrowly to some whitefish populations in France and Switzerland, as advocated by Kottelat and Freyhof, and repeated by the IUCN and FishBase.|$|E
50|$|The fish is endangered, because various {{competitors}} {{were introduced}} into the lake during the Soviet period, including <b>common</b> <b>whitefish</b> (Coregonus lavaretus) from Lake Ladoga, goldfish (Carassius auratus) and narrow-clawed crayfish (Astacus leptodactylus); and because of lake level change. On the other hand, the Sevan trout itself has been successfully introduced to Issyk Kul lake in Kyrgyzstan.|$|E
50|$|Coregonus widegreni, {{also called}} the Valaam whitefish, is {{putative}} species of freshwater whitefish, {{a part of the}} <b>common</b> <b>whitefish</b> complex (Coregonus lavaretus sensu lato) from Northern Europe. It is a demersal form of freshwater whitefish that feeds on benthic invertebrates. It spawns in late autumn, and can reach a length of 55 cm maximum. It is characterized by a low gill raker density.|$|E
5000|$|A {{sturgeon}} caviar imitation {{is a black}} or red coloured lumpsucker caviar sold throughout Europe in small glass jars. A more expensive alternative sold in Sweden and Finland is caviar from the vendace. In Finland caviars from burbot and <b>common</b> <b>whitefish</b> are also sold, but not as [...] "caviar", since the word [...] "caviar" [...] is exclusively reserved for sturgeon roe.|$|E
50|$|Fish species {{found in}} Ringsjön are European perch, carp bream, moderlieschen, {{northern}} pike, zander, common carp, burbot, common roach, rainbow trout, crucian carp, common rudd, <b>common</b> <b>whitefish,</b> tench, eel, and brown trout. Ringsjön {{has had an}} overpopulation of carp bream and common roach for a long time, leading to an increased algal bloom, and in 2005 work began on removing 80% of these species from the lake.|$|E

5000|$|Sevan trout (Salmo ischchan) is an {{endemic species}} of the lake, but it is {{endangered}} as some competitors were introduced into the lake, including <b>common</b> <b>whitefish</b> (Coregonus lavaretus) from Lake Ladoga, goldfish (Carrasius auratus), and crayfish (Astacus leptodactylus). If the Sevan trout {{is likely to become}} extinct in its [...] "home" [...] lake, it seems that it will survive in Issyk-Kul Lake (Kyrgyzstan) where it was introduced in the 1970s.|$|E
50|$|The taxonomic {{status of}} the British {{whitefish}} populations, including powan, {{is a matter of}} debate. Currently the Scottish powan, along with the Welsh gwyniad known from a single lake, and four similar populations in England known as schelly, are generally considered belonging to the widespread Eurasian <b>common</b> <b>whitefish</b> (Coregonus lavaretus). This accords with the close genetic similarity among these units. The FishBase and IUCN however classify the Scottish powan as a distinct species, Coregonus clupeoides.|$|E
5000|$|The {{humpback}} whitefish (Coregonus pidschian), {{also referred}} to as the bottom whitefish, the Arctic whitefish or the pidschian, is a species of freshwater whitefish with a northern distribution. It is one of the members in the broader <b>common</b> <b>whitefish</b> complex, or the Coregonus clupeaformis complex. This fish lives in estuaries and brackish water near river mouths, in deltas and in slowly running rivers, in large lakes with tributaries, and floodplain lakes. [...] It can migrate long distances upriver for spawning.|$|E
5000|$|There is much {{uncertainty}} and {{confusion in the}} classification of the many of species of this genus. Particularly, one extreme view of diversity recognises just two main species in Northern and Central Europe, the <b>common</b> <b>whitefish</b> C. lavaretus and the vendace C. albula, whereas others would divide these into numerous, often narrowly distributed species. In North America, the ciscoes of the Coregonus artedi complex in the Great Lakes area comprise several, often co-occurring forms or ecotypes, whose taxonomic status remains controversial.|$|E
50|$|Fish {{species of}} the gulf include Atlantic salmon, {{viviparous}} eelpout, gobies, belica, loach, European chub, minnow, silver bream, common dace, ruffe, Crucian carp, stickleback, European smelt, common rudd, brown trout, tench, pipefish, burbot, perch, gudgeon, lumpsucker, roach, lamprey, vendace, garfish, <b>common</b> <b>whitefish,</b> common bream, zander, orfe, pike, spined loach, sprat, Baltic herring, sabre carp, common bleak, European eel and Atlantic cod. Commercial fishing is carried out in spring and autumn. Gray seal and ringed seal are met in the gulf, but the latter is very rare.|$|E
50|$|During the 18th century each {{village in}} the Kalix area had its own part of the river to fish Salmon and <b>Common</b> <b>whitefish.</b> The villages along the coast line caught Common bleak and Herring. Part of the catch was transported down south, along with Seal blubber and tar. Around 1660 a copper mine was opened south of Bodträsk by Moån village. At {{the end of the}} 18th century Björkfors village also opened a mine, and in Törefors village an iron mine opened in 1801.|$|E
50|$|Fish fries {{are common}} on Fridays and during Lent. Fish fries are usually set up buffet style {{typically}} consisting of items including rolls, potatoes (typically {{in the form}} of french fries and mashed), salad, coleslaw, apple sauce, deep fried fish and sometimes fried shrimp and baked fish. Fish is generally popular throughout the state due to the states location on four of the Great Lakes. Trout, walleye, perch and catfish are <b>common.</b> <b>Whitefish</b> is a regional specialty usually offered along the coast, with smoked whitefish and whitefish dip being noteworthy.|$|E

50|$|The vendace is a slim, {{streamlined}} {{fish with}} an adipose fin - an additional small fin {{on the back}} between the dorsal fin and the tail (caudal fin), as {{is typical of the}} salmon family. Its lower jaw is longer than the upper one. It is similar in appearance to both the <b>common</b> <b>whitefish</b> (Coregonus lavaretus sensu lato), whose upper jaw is longer than its lower one, and the peled (Coregonus peled), whose jaws are of equal length. The back is bluish green or brown, the flanks are silvery and the belly white. This fish seldom grows more than 30 cm long.|$|E
50|$|The {{northern}} shore is densely {{built up}} with the main resort towns of Krumpendorf, Pörtschach, and Velden. The Süd Autobahn motorway and a railway mainline occupy the narrow space between the steep hills and the shore. The southern shore is quieter and less developed. The water surface (epilimnion) can reach up to 25 °C in summer. In winter, the region is often covered by snow and approximately every 10 years the lake freezes over, attracting numerous ice skaters. Lake Wörth's fauna is dominated by fish typically found in alpine lakes. The most common species are the pike (Esox lucius) and the <b>common</b> <b>whitefish</b> (Coregonus lavaretus).|$|E
