40|$|The paralyzed {{zebrafish}} strain relaxed {{carries a}} null mutation for the skeletal muscle dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR) β 1 a subunit. Lack of β 1 a results in (i) reduced membrane {{expression of the}} pore forming DHPR α 1 S subunit, (ii) elimination of α 1 S charge movement, and (iii) impediment of arrangement of the DHPRs in groups of four (tetrads) opposing the ryanodine receptor (RyR 1), a structural prerequisite for skeletal muscle-type excitation-contraction (EC) coupling. In this study we used relaxed larvae and isolated myotubes as expression systems to discriminate specific functions of β 1 a from rather general functions of β isoforms. Zebrafish and mammalian β 1 a subunits quantitatively restored α 1 <b>S</b> <b>triad</b> targeting and charge movement as well as intracellular Ca 2 + release, allowed arrangement of DHPRs in tetrads, and most strikingly recovered a fully motile phenotype in relaxed larvae. Interestingly, the cardiac/neuronal β 2 a as the phylogenetically closest, and the ancestral housefly βM as the most distant isoform to β 1 a also completely recovered α 1 <b>S</b> <b>triad</b> expression and charge movement. However, both revealed drastically impaired intracellular Ca 2 + transients and very limited tetrad formation compared with β 1 a. Consequently, larval motility was either only partially restored (β 2 a-injected larvae) or not restored at all (βM). Thus, our results indicate that triad expression and facilitation of 1, 4 -dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR) charge movement are common features of all tested β subunits, whereas the efficient arrangement of DHPRs in tetrads and thus intact DHPR-RyR 1 coupling is only promoted by the β 1 a isoform. Consequently, we postulate a model that presents β 1 a as an allosteric modifier of α 1 S conformation enabling skeletal muscle-type EC coupling...|$|R

40|$|Beginning in 1968, Andy Warhol and budding filmmaker Paul Morrissey {{collaborate}} {{with an unusual}} array of superstars to create three visionary and controversial films that showcase the transgender body as one point of resistance against the hegemonic powers of capitalism. Flesh, Trash, and Women in Revolt are three films-as-texts that introduce, iconize, and commercialize the transgender body through metatheatre, biomythography, {{and the advent of}} absurdist cinema. Featuring three transgender superstars (Candy Darling, Jackie Curtis, and Holly Woodlawn), these three texts?upon close examination?reveal how consumerism materially constructs all bodies in oppression through an essential, painful, and binary tension of consumer and commodity. Using pseudo-pornography, psychodrama, and camp style, Warhol-Morrissey celebrates the body as a narrative metalepsis, and the result is an oppressive hyperreality that reckons the body as simultaneous product and process within consumerism. As this oppression further unites all bodies through the death of subjectivity, Warhol-Morrissey employs two salient, unifying motifs within travesty across these three films, and these motifs are maternal bodies and genderless babies. Through these two interrelated motifs, Warhol-Morrissey exploits transgender bodies to deconstruct gender essentialism and challenge reproductive futurism. Despite commercialization, Warhol-Morrissey 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>triad</b> of transgender films situates sociopolitical activism in the present tense through queer opposition to address urgent inequalities and the painful suffering of bodies within a contemporary world.

With {{the end of the}} Cold War it is imperative that we re‐examine the basic premises that guided the choices of the strategic nuclear systems. The initial bottom line is that these systems were successful in that they did deter nuclear war without destroying either or both superpowers. However, now that the emotion of the conflict has passed, the effectiveness of the nuclear triad should be examined to determine how much was enough and which technical conventional wisdoms were incorrect. As this paper documents, incorrect technical estimates took place. These errors (and/or exaggerations) caused the U. S. to greatly increase the capabilities of its nuclear triad. At a minimum, these errors were fiscally wasteful, and at a maximum they could have endangered the stability between the countries.

40|$|Archean sulfur mass-independent {{fractionation}} (S-MIF) {{has been}} widely {{recognized as one of}} the strongest indicators for the rise of atmospheric oxygen in the Early Proterozoic. A decade after its discovery, the wide-ranging implications of Archean sulfur MIF have been discussed extensively and despite a number of recent studies on the gas-phase chemistry of sulfur, no definite overall picture has emerged to date as to the precise origin and preservation of the Archean mass-independent sulfur signal. The interpretation of the Archean sulfur MIF as a strong constraint for atmospheric oxygen levels, however, requires a dominant atmospheric source of sulfur MIF. This study was aimed at investigating the potential contribution of the poorly explored mass-independent effects from liquid-phase sulfur chemistry and focused on sulfur isotope fractionation during liquid-phase photolytic breakdown of phenacylphenylsulfone (PPS) as a model system for initial investigation. Results confirm that MIF in this system is caused by the magnetic 33 S isotope and excludes other mechanisms such as nuclear volume effects or vibronic coupling that would produce concomitant MIF in the 32 S- 34 _ 3 - 3 <b>S</b> <b>triad.</b> This provides a starting point for discussing the implications of magnetic isotope effects as a mechanism for mass-independent isotope fractionation in the chemical evolution of the sulfur cycle and suggests that liquid-phase processes such as the photolysis of PPS cannot constitute the principal source of mass-independent sulfur fractionation in the Archean. by Sebastian Hermann Kopf.

40|$|This {{research}} investigates psychological {{ideas of}} the interior self as transient {{and its relationship to}} the Real within a creative practice that includes video, projection and animation. The significance of the research is in the critical development of my creative practice and its creative outcome as a means of visually manifesting {{ideas of the}} interior self as explored by the theorist Slavoj Zizek. Theoretically, the notion of the interior self is defined as a transient state of co-existing contradictions. Its definition is located in Zizek’s reading of Jacques Lacan’ <b>s</b> <b>triad</b> of orders that comprise the thinking self (Zizek, 2007 a, p. 8). In Zizek, the interior self is positioned at the interstice between the Real and the Symbolic orders (Myers, 2003), hovering between life and death, absence and presence, here and not here, interior and exterior, real and not real. In positioning the self in this manner, the inter-relationship of the Symbolic order and the order of the Real (Zizek, 1989, p. 191 - 192) is discussed with reference to the uncanny, extimacy and the gaze, and thus situate my creative work. Using the film theory of Kate Mondloch (2007; 2010) and with reference to Todd McGowan (2007) and Patrick Fuery (2000), I investigate the immersive or experiential possibilities of creative work in generating an inter-relationship between the work and the viewer, and thereby reveal the notion of the interior self as transient. It is within the reflexive praxis model (Crouch, 2007; 2012) that the critical examination unfolds. The investigation of works by artists who influence my practice, such as Anna Gaskell, Bill Viola, Mike Parr and Robbie Cooper are essential in further developing this approach and provide examples for this analysis. My creative work is reflexively examined in relation to various exhibitions held throughout my candidature. Ultimately, this research examines the notion of the interior self and the lost Real that defines it as transient, through a reflexive creative praxis, both in the content of the work, the medium of video, animation and projection, and in its relationship to viewer...|$|R

That study (Clark et al., 1997) proposed the use of Piaget and Garcia 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>triad</b> mechanism to describe the development of a schema, specifically with respect to students 2 ̆ 7 understanding of the chain rule. This study was designed to collect data to test this theory. Both quantitative and qualitative methods were employed. Data were collected via a questionnaire on a group of calculus students 2 ̆ 7 (n = 34) knowledge of and skill with function, composition of functions, differentiation and chain rule. The data were analyzed to investigate how their performance on the composition of functions items related to that of the chain rule. No strong correlation is reported. Some of the subjects had experienced a reform calculus course which used computer experiences and cooperative learning. A comparison was made between the two groups, although no overall differences are reported. Follow-up interviews based on the questionnaire responses were conducted with six subjects. These results are positive {{in the sense that the}} triad description fits with the data. We present detailed descriptions of the Intra-, Inter-, and Trans-levels of the development of the chain rule schema. Some evidence is presented to support the notion that understanding of composition of functions is key to understanding the chain rule. The type of instruction was a factor in how a student performed on these tasks. The differences between the types seem to be related to the difference between using the chain rule and understanding the chain rule, and an explanation of these differences is offered. The need for collecting differing types of data is established. Two students scored high quantitatively but did not perform well in the interview, while another student failed the quantitative work but demonstrated a high level in the interview.

This study analyzes Purdue agriculture 2 ̆ 7 s contributions to agricultural science and agricultural education, its responses to changes in the American economy and to two World Wars, its role as a component of Purdue University, and its relationships with politicians, government officials, scientists, educators, farmers, farmers 2 ̆ 7 organizations, and business people. ^ An introductory chapter treats the development of agricultural science and education to 1862. The next three chapters deal with the emergence of the School of Agriculture, the Agricultural Experiment Station, and the Department of Extension from the passage of the Morrill Act of 1862 to the passage of the Smith-Lever Act of 1914. Chapters five through eight examine Purdue 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> agricultural <b>triad</b> during World War I, the 2 ̆ 2 Farm Crisis 2 ̆ 2 of the 1920 s, the Great Depression of the 1930 s, and World War II.

Unlike officials at these leading institutions, Purdue officials failed to obtain an adequate level of sustained financial support from the state legislature. Financial restraints fostered cautious and conservative attitudes among the leaders of Purdue agriculture. Deaths, retirements, and resignations between 1939 and 1945 brought a new generation of leaders into power that forged links with agribusiness and endorsed the effort of the new president of the University to transform Purdue from a provincial college of agriculture and engineering into a modern research university. ...|$|R

40|$|The Global Leadership Program (GLP) is {{a chance}} for {{approximately}} 35 Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) students to travel to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and participate in a cross-university cultural and educational exchange. The students have the opportunity to collaborate with and learn from MIT's own students and faculty during the program. The highlight of the summer is a nine-week design-build course, referred to as the Engineering Design Challenge, which teaches the fundamentals of engineering design and the necessary fabrication skills to execute those designs. The challenge requires small teams to design and build a single-person electric vehicle (EV). The first two years, the challenge was to make go-karts; since then, the scale has been increased to electric boats. The design challenge is presented as a real-world engineering exercise by intentionally being open-ended and primarily student-driven. It requires the students to practice both their technical skills as well as their interpersonal, professional, and leadership skills. This sort of allencompassing, immersive approach to education is based on principles found within the Project- Based Learning (PBL) and Conceive-Design-Implement-Operate (CDIO) pedagogical frameworks. Though it has only been around since 2013, the program has had a lasting impact on both the students that participated and their peers upon their return to Singapore. Elements of MIT's own student culture were shared with the participants and successfully transplanted back to SUTD at the program's end. This sort of cross-university educational and cultural exchange has exciting implications for expanding the global engineering educational network as the world becomes more and more connected. by Paige Lynette <b>Reiter.</b> Thesis: <b>S.</b> B., Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Department of Mechanical Engineering, 2016.

50|$|Born in Cleveland, Ohio, in the USA in 1947, he {{was adopted}} shortly after birth by Jewish parents Alexander and Freda Reiter, {{and brought up}} in a working-class neighbourhood. His adoptive father, a {{self-employed}} truck driver, {{died of a heart attack}} in 1958, leaving his mother to raise Reiter as an only child. Aged 19, Reiter moved to Oregon, where he completed his BA in the Independent Studies Program at the University of Oregon. He married Carol Geneva Rechard in 1969 and moved to Alberta, Canada, where both attended the University of Alberta. <b>Reiter</b> <b>completed</b> his master's degree in American Literature, writing his thesis on William Faulkner's The Wild Palms owing to his interest in interdisciplinary subjects. He began publishing stories in prestigious journals like The Fiddlehead (University of New Brunswick) and poems in journals like Canadian Literature. His first paid employment was as a technical editor with the Aerospace Engineering Test Establishment in Cold Lake, followed by an appointment as a scientific editor at the Northern Forest Research Centre in Edmonton, Alberta. His interest in environmental matters led him to be a publishing consultant for several Government departments such as Environment Canada.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we study a utility {{representation}} for preferences, and we price its continuity, using a topology for preferences introduced by Chichilnisky (1977). Such utility representations were constructed under restrictive conditions first by Y. Kannai and <b>S.</b> <b>Reiter</b> (1974, 1975). Our results are related {{more closely to}} those of Mount and Reiter (1974 and 1975). Starting from restrictive conditions these works have attempted to enlarge the class of preferences that could be continuously represented. The class of preferences studied here is much larger than those considered earlier, and it therefore applies to a wider class of problems. Our preferences include ones which are not necessarily convex or monotone, and which may be locally satiated; furthermore, no completeness of preferences is required. The assumption made by Mount and Reiter (1975) {{of the existence of}} an E-threshold is also not required here. These results are possible due to properties of the order topology introduced in Chichilnisky (1977). As we shall now discuss, this topology has quite desirable features for the study of preferences, and these now make it a natural choice for the problem at hand. ...|$|R
