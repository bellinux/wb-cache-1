40|$|It {{is widely}} argued that Europe's unified {{monetary}} policy calls for international coordination of fiscal policy. This paper surveys {{the issues involved}} with the coordination of fiscal policies as a demand management tool. We discuss <b>ex-ante</b> and ex-post <b>coordination.</b> The former operates through binding agreements (pre-commitment), while the latter is ad-hoc, depending on {{the current state of}} affairs. We propose a simple model to investigate the circumstances under which coordination {{may or may not be}} desirable. The model focuses on the design of stabilization policies in the presence of demand and supply shocks. It assumes that fiscal policy is the exclusive responsibility of governments trading off the variability of deficits against output variability and, possibly, variability in inflation. Monetary policy is delegated to the ECB, which trades off price stability against fluctuations in the interest rate (its policy instrument). We compare a non-cooperative scenario with fiscal coordination. We further distinguish between the fiscal authorities jointly playing Nash against the ECB (a proxy of ex-post coordination) and them acting as Stackelberg leaders against the ECB (a proxy of <b>ex-ante</b> <b>coordination).</b> Fiscal coordination may be counterproductive because of the adverse reaction of the ECB to the coordination efforts of the governments. Coordination is most likely to be beneficial when shocks are asymmetric because union-wide aggregates are only mildly affected, which leads to a passive monetary policy. <b>Ex-ante</b> <b>coordination</b> is more desirable because it presupposes a commitment capacity that helps the governments to acquire a strategic leadership position against the central bank...|$|R

50|$|On 1979, he {{published}} a seminal paper in Econometrica introducing {{the notion of}} dominance solvable games. Dominance solvability is a solution concept for games {{which is based on}} an iterated procedure of deletion of dominated strategies by all participants. Dominance solvability is a stronger concept than Nash equilibrium because it does not require <b>ex-ante</b> <b>coordination.</b> Its only requirement is iterated common knowledge of rationality. His work on this concept was mentioned in Eric Maskin's Nobel Prize Lecture.|$|R
30|$|Which {{are those}} {{failures}} that justify the selective {{intervention of the}} State? In the first place, the most prominent failure is the coordination one (Chang 1994; Hausmann and Rodrik 2006). The coordination failure is related to incomplete markets. Thus, economic benefits of one investment {{would depend on the}} realization of other investments. For example, constructing a hotel in a beach would be profitable if someone else decides to build an airport to take people to that beach (Hausmann and Rodrik 2006, p. 7). This kind of situations is frequent in manufacturing upgrading, especially if it is referred to new sectors linked with science and technology. Therefore, a mechanism of <b>ex-ante</b> <b>coordination</b> is justified, and there is where State can come into action.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} a two-player real option {{game with a}} first-mover {{advantage}} is analyzed, where payoffs are driven by a player-specific stochastic state variable. It is shown that there exists an equilibrium which has qualitatively different properties from those in standard real option games driven by common stochastic shocks. The properties of the equilibrium are four-fold: (i) preemption does not necessarily occur, (ii) if preemption takes place, the rent-equalization property holds, (iii) for almost all sample paths it is <b>clear</b> <b>ex-ante</b> which player invests first, and (iv) {{it is possible that}} both players invest simultaneously, even if that is not optimal. It is argued from simulations that real option games with a common one-dimensional shock do not provide a good approximation for games with player-specific uncertainty, even if these are highly correlated.

30|$|This paper {{discusses}} why, {{given the}} structure of the formal dairy sector, the two cooperation strategies are actually conflicting and <b>ex-ante</b> <b>coordination</b> of plans amongst donors would be desirable. Furthermore, the paper discusses why the underlying market structure is key in determining the optimal strategy to follow. On the one hand, if the sector is not perfectly competitive, then efforts aimed at strengthening the different stages of the formal supply chain (such as improving the efficiency of farmers) might fail in the longer run {{due to a lack of}} incentives (e.g., Alston et al. 1997). Under this situation, the strategy of creating local dairy supply chains might be appropriate in order to “discipline” the formal sector, forcing it to expand the production of processed milk, reduce dairy product prices and increase the demand for milk. On the other hand, if the formal sector is competitive but inefficient, the strategy of creating short dairy chains worsens the situation by further reducing the amount of milk available to processors, increasing their idle capacity and average costs.|$|R
40|$|In {{the paper}} we analyze {{learning}} in the repeated game framework, when agents know only own payoffs (uncoupledness, Hart, MasColell [8]), but observe the common history of play (perfect monitoring). Each is using a simple learning strategy, modeled by a finite automaton. We study learning strategies that can guarantee that the period by period play converges almost surely to an approximate Nash equilibrium. It is shown that the <b>ex-ante</b> <b>coordination</b> on the pairs of learning strategies that actually achieve {{this is more than}} exponential in the approximation level, and almost exponential in the complexity of the learning strategies. The same holds {{if we look at the}} Bayesian rational learning strategies. We also show that coordination problems persist under the weaker notion of convergence. ∗ I am indebted to Yossi Feinberg for his devoted guidance, support and valuable suggestions.

30|$|A {{supply chain}} in disarray can be {{identified}} as a barrier not only to growth for the agricultural sector but also to achieving food security in a country because it may lead to either a deficiency in food production and/or too high prices. Using the dairy sector of Malawi as an example, {{the purpose of this}} paper is to discuss the coherence between market structure and the development strategy pursued by international donors. Within Malawi the dairy sector may be characterised as a segmented market: with both formal and informal milk markets, with smallholder producers serving both markets. The formal market includes few processing firms operating with idle capacity and selling dairy products to an affluent segment of the urban population, whilst the informal market comprises the sale of unprocessed milk products to the less affluent urban population and also rural areas. In this context, cooperative international action, conducted through agencies from a range of countries, is targeted at improving the efficiency of the formal supply chain and also the creation of local supply chains that sell processed products directly to poor consumers. The paper discusses reasons why these two cooperation strategies, given the structure of the sector, may potentially conflict with each other, the need to address the degree of market imperfection of the formal sector and the desirability of <b>ex-ante</b> <b>coordination</b> of plans amongst donors.|$|R
40|$|First made {{available}} online in May 2015. Information - understood as items of {{and in particular}} accretions to knowledge which act over subjective probabilities attached by economic agents to uncertain events - is a commodity whose production, exchange and use presents special problems of measurement, private and social evaluation of its effects, classification. Treatment of these problems in recent literature on information economics is recalled {{in order to discuss}} the formation of expectations - precisely as subjective probabilities modified by information - on the basis of which necessarily economic agents operate in any sequential economy, i. e. an economy where markets - even if generalised to include markets for future and contingent commodities - open and shut repeatedly or are continuously open, making impossible a general equilibrium allocation based on a single price system at a point in time. The informational efficiency of markets, postulated by the theory of so-called "rational" expectations - which would be better defined as "successful" instead - is rejected because i) it is contradicted by the paradox of worthlessness of information which can be derived from it; ii) it implies innate knowedge instead of learning processes; iii) it neglects the possible self-fulfilment of expectations. The informational inadequacy of markets remains at the root of inefficiency, disequilibrium and instability which visibly characterises market economies. Attempts at <b>ex-ante</b> <b>coordination</b> of decisions of economic agents have been attempted with both French-type indicative planning and Soviet-type command planning. Both however come up against not only practical difficulties - which might be reduced by technical progress in information processing and communication - but also the non-cooperative strategies of participants in the planning exercise, though for different reasons and with different implications in the two systems. The alternative remains of delegating to markets detailed decisions about inputs and outputs, limiting policy to macroeconomic variables; this however requires the development of new instruments of control and information (above all about {{the costs and benefits of}} such control) ...|$|R

Using survey data from 191 purchasing and sales managers of original equipment manufacturers, {{this study examines}} five characteristics of management control information (scope, timeliness, aggregation, integration and symmetry), and two dimensions of <b>ex-ante</b> control mechanisms (<b>coordination</b> and influence). The analysis shows differences between purchasing manager–supplier relationships and sales manager–industrial client relationships. In both dyads coordination and timeliness increase commitment; in the latter, broad scope and partner influence also affect commitment.
