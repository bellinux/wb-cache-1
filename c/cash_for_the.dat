5|$|After their victory, Alcibiades and Thrasybulus {{began the}} siege of Chalcedon in 409 BC with about 190 ships. Although unable to attain a decisive victory or induce the city to surrender, Alcibiades was able to win a small {{tactical}} land battle outside of the city gates and Theramenes concluded {{an agreement with the}} Chalcedonians. Afterwards they concluded a temporary alliance with Pharnabazus which secured some much needed immediate <b>cash</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> army, but despite this Alcibiades was still forced to depart in search for more booty to pay the soldiers and oarsmen of the fleet.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, Bowers {{returned}} to Nevada. Her hearing had diminished significantly, {{and she was}} forced to give up the scrying business as she was unable to hear the requests of her clients. She launched a claim against the government asking for financial assistance in return for the $14,000 she and Sandy Bowers had donated to support the Union cause in the Civil War and to finance the 1860 Paiute War, but was ignored. Destitute, she was placed in the Washoe County poorhouse, and became the subject of a protracted legal dispute between the governments of Nevada and California over who was to pay for her care. In August 1901 it was agreed that California would take responsibility for her welfare, and she was summarily put on a San Francisco-bound train by Reno officials with $30 <b>cash.</b> <b>For</b> <b>the</b> last two years of her life she lived at the King's Daughters Home in Oakland, dying on October 27, 1903. Her ashes were returned to Nevada and buried alongside Sandy and Margaret at the Bowers Mansion.|$|E
5|$|It {{belonged to}} Señora O. Yturbe of Madrid, who sold it in 1930 to Franz M. Zatzenstein, {{founder of the}} Matthiesen Gallery in Berlin. That April, the Duveen Brothers, less {{affected}} by the 1929 stock market crash than other dealers, paid Zatzenstein £30,000, in <b>cash,</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> painting and sold it immediately to Mellon. A dealer usually {{had to go through}} the lengthy process of sending photographs of a painting via trans-Atlantic ship to an American buyer and then wait for a reply; the transaction for the Nativity is exceptional because it is the first painting of which the photograph was wired via Marconi cable from England to America. To avoid the export fees due if the painting been sent directly to New York, the Duveens took a circuitous route– from Madrid to Germany, then to Paris and America. In 1936 it was acquired by the A.W. Mellon Educational and Charitable Trust, and gifted to the National Gallery a year later.|$|E

His offbeat style and likeable {{personality}} quickly gained him attention, but in 1965 he was sacked after some outspoken remarks about religion on air. Like most of the pirate stations, Radio London carried sponsored American evangelical shows and Everett's disparaging remarks about The World Tomorrow caused its producers to threaten to withdraw their lucrative contract with the station. Everett returned six months later, however, before being given his own show by Radio Luxembourg in 1966.|$|E

25|$|On December 3, 2012, the General Services Administration {{announced}} that it would entertain proposals from private-sector developers to swap the J.

GSA Acting Administrator Dan Tangherlini said the agency hoped the cash infusion would enable the FBI to build its new headquarters. A deadline of March 4 was established for proposals. A few weeks later, Montgomery County, Maryland officials said they were soliciting private developers to help them form a bid for the new FBI headquarters as well.|$|E
25|$|Sharecropping {{occurred}} {{extensively in}} Scotland, Ireland and colonial Africa, and came into wide {{use in the}} Southern United States during the Reconstruction era (1865–1877). The South had been devastated by war - planters had ample land but little money for wages or taxes. At the same time, most of the former slaves had labor but no money and no land - they rejected the kind of gang labor that typified slavery. A solution was the sharecropping system focused on cotton, which was the only crop that could generate <b>cash</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> croppers, landowners, merchants and the tax collector. Poor white farmers, who previously had done little cotton farming, needed cash as well and became sharecroppers.|$|E
25|$|The {{idea of an}} {{architectural}} competition to determine {{the design of the}} memorial was favored at the JNEMA's inaugural meeting. They planned to award <b>cash</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> best design. In January 1945, the JNEMA officially announced a two-stage design competition that would cost $225,000 to organize. Smith and the JNEMA struggled to raise the funds, garnering only a third of the required total by June 1945. Then mayor Aloys Kaufmann feared that the lack of public support would lead officials to abandon hope in the project. The passage of a year brought little success, and Smith frantically underwrote the remaining $40,000 in May 1946. By June, Smith found others to assume portions of his underwriting, with $17,000 remaining under his sponsorship. In February 1947, the underwriters were compensated, and the fund stood over $231,199.|$|E

25|$|The loss of John Jr.'s job as {{postmaster}} {{caused a}} financial crisis for the Surratt family. When John Sr.'s estate was probated in late November 1862, the family owned only two middle-age male slaves. However, by 1863, Louis J. Weichmann, a friend of John Jr. from St. Charles College, observed that the family had six or more slaves working on the property. By 1864, Mary Surratt found that her husband's unpaid debts and bad business deals had left her with many creditors. Several of her slaves ran away. When he was not meeting with Confederate sympathizers in the city, her son was selling vegetables to raise <b>cash</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> family. Mary was tired of running the farm, tavern, and other businesses without her son's help. In the fall of 1864, she began considering moving to her townhouse in the city.|$|E
25|$|Shahzad is {{believed}} to have bought the 1993 Nissan Pathfinder on April 24, a week prior to the attempted bombing. The vehicle had been listed in an online Craigslist ad, and he reportedly bought it from a female Connecticut college student for $1,300 (negotiated down from $1,800), which he paid in $100 bills. He reportedly exchanged the <b>cash</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> car at a Connecticut shopping center parking lot, where he inspected the interior and cargo area (but not the engine) and declined the offer of a bill of sale. He later had the car windows tinted, which made it harder to peer inside. A surveillance tape from the parking lot shows Shahzad test-driving the car, according to the FBI. He bought a second vehicle through Craigslist (a black Isuzu Rodeo) from a mechanic in Stratford, Connecticut.|$|E

25|$|From that time, through fresh {{sanguine}} {{predictions for}} {{improvements in the}} business climate and the Reading's overall performance, which allowed him to borrow more funds on a less grand scale {{and to get the}} McCalmonts to defer interest payments due; and maneuverings such as periodically paying workers in scrip—essentially promissory notes—instead of cash, Franklin Gowen continued to run the Reading. In early 1880, employees were paid in <b>cash</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first time in sixteen months. Then, on Friday, May 22, 1880, two Coal & Iron Co. checks, intended to transfer cash to the railroad, bounced. Gowen offered railroad promissory notes to make the checks good, but the bank turned him down. McCalmont Brothers ignored Gowen's plea by cable for a fresh loan of a half million dollars. That same day the Reading announced suspension of payments on debt.|$|E

500|$|The Soviets {{considered}} finishing Kinburn and Navarin to {{a modified}} design that featured [...] guns; a two-gun turret weighed {{slightly less than}} a triple 14-inch gun turret. Four proposals were made with various changes to the turrets' armour scheme, but none were accepted, not least because the prospects of actually acquiring such guns were minimal. Domestic industry was not capable of building such large guns {{and they were not}} able to purchase the guns from any foreign company. Other ideas were examined for the three less complete ships. These included converting the hulls to cargo ships, passenger liners, or [...] oil barges, but most of the ideas were rejected as the hulls were thought to be too large and unwieldy for the proposed alternative uses. None of the proposals was accepted, and all three of the less complete ships were sold to a German company for scrap on 21 August 1923 to raise much-needed <b>cash</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> government.|$|E
