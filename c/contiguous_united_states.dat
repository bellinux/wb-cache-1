40|$|Conservation {{scientists}} {{emphasize the}} importance of maintaining a connected network of protected areas to prevent ecosystems and populations from becoming isolated, reduce the risk of extinction, and ultimately sustain biodiversity. Keeping protected areas connected in a network is increasingly recognized as a conservation priority in the current era of rapid climate change. Models that identify suitable linkages between core areas have been used to prioritize potentially important corridors for maintaining functional connectivity. Here, we identify the most "natural" (i. e., least human-modified) corridors between large protected areas in the <b>contiguous</b> <b>Unites</b> <b>States.</b> We aggregated results from multiple connectivity models to develop a composite map of corridors reflecting agreement of models run under different assumptions about how human modification of land may influence connectivity. To identify which land units are most important for sustaining structural connectivity, we used the composite map of corridors to evaluate connectivity priorities in two ways: (1) among land units outside of our pool of large core protected areas and (2) among units administratively protected as Inventoried Roadless (IRAs) or Wilderness Study Areas (WSAs). Corridor values varied substantially among classes of "unprotected" non-core land units, and land units of high connectivity value and priority represent diverse ownerships and existing levels of protections. We provide a ranking of IRAs and WSAs that should be prioritized for additional protection to maintain minimal human modification. Our results provide a coarse-scale assessment of connectivity priorities for maintaining a connected network of protected areas...|$|R

40|$|Our {{ability to}} predict {{precipitation}} on climate time-scales (months–decades) {{is limited by}} our ability to separate signals in the climate system (cyclical and secular) from noise — that is, variability due to processes that are inherently unpredictable on climate time-scales. This dissertation describes methods for characterizing “weather” noise — variability that arises from daily-scale processes — {{as well as the}} potential predictability of precipitation on climate time-scales. In each method, we make use of a climate-stationary null model for precipitation and determine which characteristics of the true, non-stationary system cannot be captured by a stationary assumption. This un-captured climate variability is potentially predictable, meaning that it is due to climate time-scale processes, although those processes themselves may not be entirely predictable, either practically or theoretically. The three primary methods proposed in this dissertation are 1. A stochastic framework for modeling precipitation occurrence with proper daily-scale memory representation, using variable order Markov chains and information criteria for order selection. 2. A corresponding method for representing precipitation intensity, allowing for memory in intensity processes. 3. A semi-parametric stochastic framework for precipitation which represents intensity and occurrence without separating the processes, designed to handle the issues that arise from estimating likelihoods for zero-inflated processes. Using each of these methods, potential predictability is determined across the <b>contiguous</b> 48 <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> Additionally, the methods of Chapter 4 are used to determine the magnitude of weather and climate variability for the “historical runs” of five global climate models for comparison against observational data. It is found that while some areas of the <b>contiguous</b> 48 <b>United</b> <b>States</b> are potentially very predictable (up to ∼ 70 % of interannual variability), many regions are so dominated by weather noise that climate signals are effectively masked. Broadly, perhaps 20 – 30 % of interannual variability may be potentially predictable, but this ranges considerably with geography and the annual seasonal cycle, yielding “hot spots” and “cold spots” of potential predictability. The analyzed global climate models demonstrate a fairly robust representation of weather-scale processes, and properly represent the ratio of weather-to- climate induced variability, despite some regional errors in mean precipitation totals and corresponding variability...|$|R

5|$|The bobcat (Lynx rufus) is a North American {{cat that}} {{appeared}} during the Irvingtonian stage of around 1.8 million years ago (AEO).

With a gray to brown coat, whiskered face, and black-tufted ears, the bobcat resembles the other species of the midsized Lynx genus. It is smaller on average than the Canada lynx, with which it shares parts of its range, but is about {{twice as large as}} the domestic cat.

30|$|A more {{important}} issue related to tree-ring studies {{is that such}} studies can inform us about recent fire history from within only those forest types that typically experience relatively frequent, low-severity fire. Thus, tree-based studies are necessarily biased toward surface fires that scar, but do not kill, trees (Whitlock 2004). Because a disproportionately large number of historical studies are conducted in forests that support low-severity fire regimes, we may have unwittingly painted a biased broader perspective of what constitutes the dominant fire regime {{in the majority of}} conifer forests of North America. In the western <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> for example, the vast majority of forest types lie outside the ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) vegetation type (about 85 % of forested land within the <b>contiguous</b> western <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> according to the LANDFIRE database) and are dominated by mixed- and high-severity fires rather than low-severity fires (see also Agee [1993 :Figure 1.4] and Arno and Fiedler [2005 :Table 3.1]). This fact is not widely appreciated, and is not the picture of natural fire regimes propagated by the popular press, from which one gets the impression that most western forest types historically burned frequently and only at low severity.|$|R
40|$|Overview. Public {{skepticism}} {{about global warming}} was reinforced by the extreme cold of December 2009 in the <b>contiguous</b> 48 <b>United</b> <b>States</b> and in much of Eurasia. The summer of 2009 was also unusually cool in the <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> But when a cold spell hits, we need to ask: * Cold compared to what. Our memory {{of the past few}} winters? Winters of our childhood? Winters earlier in the 20 th century? * Cold where and for how long? Regional cold snaps are expected even with large global warming. Weather fluctuations can be 10, 20 or 30 degrees, much larger than average global warming. * The reality of seasons. As the plot of Earth we live on turns away from the sun, in winter or at night, it cools off. That’s true even with global warming, albeit not quite so much. Before addressing these matters, we note that scientists reporting global warming have come under attack for a supposed conspiracy to manufacture evidence of global warming. Perhaps because some members of the public accept these charges as reality, vicious personal messages are sent to the principal scientists almost daily.
