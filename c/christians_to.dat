5|$|George Went Hensley (May 2, 1881 – July 25, 1955) was an American Pentecostal {{minister}} {{best known}} for popularizing the practice of snake handling. A native of rural Appalachia, Hensley experienced a religious conversion around 1910: {{on the basis of}} his interpretation of scripture, he came to believe that the New Testament commanded all <b>Christians</b> <b>to</b> handle venomous snakes.|$|E
5|$|Horton Hatches the Egg {{has been}} used in discussions {{on a wide variety of}} topics e.g., economics, Christianity, feminism, and adoption. James Kemp, a retired United Methodist pastor, {{compared}} Horton to the early <b>Christians</b> <b>to</b> whom the First Epistle of Peter was addressed. Like those early Christians, Horton faces persecution and ridicule for his actions, but Horton is faithful to his mission and is rewarded, as evidenced by the elephant-bird that hatches at the end of the book.|$|E
5|$|Hyder's army {{included}} several Catholic soldiers and he allowed <b>Christians</b> <b>to</b> build a church within the Seringapatam Fort where French generals offered prayers and priests visited. Mangalorean historian A.L.P. D'Souza mentions that Hyder had also used Canara Christians for administrative purposes. In {{accordance with the}} two treaties concluded with Portugal, Hyder allowed Portuguese priests to settle disputes among the Christians. Despite this, the Christians in general hated Hyder Ali because of the heavy taxes they were made to pay to the king's treasury.|$|E

5|$|In {{mid-19th century}} America, the Wesleyan holiness {{movement}} began to teach that entire sanctification was less a process {{and more of}} a state that one entered into by faith at a definite moment in time. This second blessing, as it was commonly called, allowed <b>Christians</b> <b>to</b> be freed from the power of sin. Among adherence of the holiness movement, baptism in the Holy Spirit was synonymous with second blessing sanctification.|$|E
5|$|Munro issued three edicts {{regarding}} Christian estates {{that had}} {{been taken over by}} non-Christians during the captivity. In determining ownership of land, he sent two Mangalorean Hindus, Muthsuddy Vencappah and Saly Purvoe Dur Shetty along with other <b>Christians</b> <b>to</b> investigate and report back to him about these estates. Through the assistance of the Church, and with the support of Munro, the Christians were able to recover their lands and estates.|$|E
5|$|An {{exception}} {{was made for}} <b>Christians</b> <b>to</b> participate in Christmas ceremonies in Bethlehem. Some sources claim Jews could only visit the wall if they traveled through Jordan (which {{was not an option}} for Israelis) and did not have an Israeli visa stamped in their passports. Only Jordanian soldiers and tourists were to be found there. A vantage point on Mount Zion, from which the Wall could be viewed, became the place where Jews gathered to pray. For thousands of pilgrims, the mount, being the closest location to the Wall under Israeli control, became a substitute site for the traditional priestly blessing ceremony which takes place on the Three Pilgrimage Festivals.|$|E

5|$|In 1987, Payá {{founded the}} Christian Liberation Movement (MCL), {{which called for}} nonviolent civil disobedience against {{the rule of the}} Cuban Communist Party. The group advocates for civil liberties and freedom for {{political}} prisoners. He also began a magazine for Catholics titled People of God (Pueblo de Dios), calling for <b>Christians</b> <b>to</b> lead the struggle for human rights. However, the magazine was shut down the following year by Cuba's bishops under government pressure. Payá attempted to run for the National Assembly of People's Power (NAPP) in 1992, but was not allowed to stand.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unknown}} how much support there was for {{persecution}} within the aristocracy. After Gallienus's peace, Christians reached high ranks in Roman government. Diocletian appointed several <b>Christians</b> <b>to</b> those positions himself, {{and his wife}} and daughter may have been sympathetic to the church. There were many individuals willing to be martyrs, and many provincials willing to ignore any persecutory edicts from the emperors as well. Even Constantius was known to have disapproved of persecutory policies. The lower classes demonstrated little of the enthusiasm they had shown for earlier persecutions. They no longer believed the slanderous accusations that were popular in the 1st and 2nd centuries. Perhaps, as the historian Timothy Barnes has suggested, the long-established Church had become another accepted part of their lives.|$|E
5|$|Persecutory {{policies}} {{varied in}} intensity across the empire. Where Galerius and Diocletian were avid persecutors, Constantius was unenthusiastic. Later persecutory edicts, including {{the calls for}} universal sacrifice, were not applied in his domain. His son, Constantine, on taking the imperial office in 306, restored <b>Christians</b> <b>to</b> full legal equality and returned property that had been confiscated during the persecution. In Italy in 306, the usurper Maxentius ousted Maximian's successor Severus, promising full religious toleration. Galerius ended the persecution in the East in 311, but it was resumed in Egypt, Palestine, and Asia Minor by his successor, Maximinus. Constantine and Licinius, Severus's successor, signed the Edict of Milan in 313, which offered a more comprehensive acceptance of Christianity than Galerius's edict had provided. Licinius ousted Maximinus in 313, bringing an end to persecution in the East.|$|E

5|$|Silence is a 2016 {{historical}} period drama film {{directed by}} Martin Scorsese and written by Jay Cocks and Scorsese, {{based on the}} 1966 novel {{of the same name}} by Shūsaku Endō. Set in Nagasaki, Japan, the film was shot entirely in Taiwan around Taipei. The film stars Andrew Garfield, Adam Driver, Liam Neeson, Tadanobu Asano and Ciarán Hinds. The plot follows two 17th-century Jesuit priests who travel from Portugal to Edo-era Japan to locate their missing mentor and spread Catholic Christianity. The story is set in the time when it was common for <b>Christians</b> <b>to</b> hide from persecution following the suppression of Japanese Roman Catholics during the Shimabara Rebellion (1637–1638) against the Tokugawa shogunate.|$|E
5|$|Teachers of the {{doctrine}} focus on personal empowerment, promoting a positive view of the spirit and body. They maintain that Christians have been given power over creation because they {{are made in the}} image of God and teach that positive confession allows <b>Christians</b> <b>to</b> exercise dominion over their souls and material objects around them. Leaders of the movement view the atonement as providing for the alleviation of sickness, poverty, and spiritual corruption; poverty and illness are cast as curses which can be broken by faith and righteous actions. There are, however, some prosperity churches which seek a more moderate or reformed paradigm of prosperity. Kirbyjon Caldwell, pastor of a Methodist mega-church, supports a theology of abundant life, teaching prosperity for the whole human being, which he sees as a path to combating poverty.|$|E
5|$|The Reformed {{tradition}} {{holds that}} baptism is primarily God's promise or offer of grace to the baptized. Baptism {{is said to}} signify union with Christ in his death, burial, and resurrection. The baptized is made one with Christ's person, meaning God the Father treats them the same as he treats Christ. Baptism also unites the baptized with Christ's history, meaning that the person {{can be said to}} have died, been buried, and raised again just as Christ was. The baptized person's identity in Christ is based on Christ's action in baptism rather than the person's action. This union also unites <b>Christians</b> <b>to</b> one another. Through the words of institution used in baptism, Christians are also united to each {{of the members of the}} trinity.|$|E

Following the match, Stratus turned on Jericho and slapped him several times, allowing <b>Christian</b> <b>to</b> perform the Unprettier on Jericho.|$|R
5|$|The {{sacrament of}} Holy Orders consecrates and deputes some <b>Christians</b> <b>to</b> serve {{the whole body}} as members of three degrees or orders: episcopate (bishops), presbyterate (priests) and diaconate (deacons). The Church has defined rules on who may be ordained into the clergy. In the Latin Church, the priesthood is {{generally}} restricted to celibate men, and the episcopate is always restricted to celibate men. Men who are already married may be ordained in certain Eastern Catholic churches in most countries, and the personal ordinariates and may become deacons even in the Western Church (see Clerical marriage). But after becoming a Catholic priest, a man may not marry (see Clerical celibacy) unless he is formally laicised.|$|E
5|$|Within {{two years}} of the expulsion, the {{population}} in the Chiquitos missions dropped below 20,000. Despite the general decline of the settlements, however, the church buildings were maintained and, in some cases, extended by the towns' inhabitants. The construction of the church in Santa Ana de Velasco falls into this period. Bernd Fischermann, an anthropologist who studied the Chiquitano, suggests three reasons that the Chiquitano preserved the heritage of the Jesuits even after their expulsion: the memory of their prosperity with the Jesuits; the desire to appear as civilized <b>Christians</b> <b>to</b> mestizos and white people; and to preserve the ethnicity that originated from a mix of various culturally distinct groups blended by an enforced common language and customs learned from the Jesuits.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of Saladin's reign as sultan in Egypt, upon the encouragement of his adviser, Qadi al-Fadil, Christians were prohibited from employment in the fiscal administration, but various Ayyubid emirs continued to allow <b>Christians</b> <b>to</b> serve in their posts. A number of other regulations were imposed, including the bans on alcohol consumption, religious processions, and the ringing of church bells. Conversion of formerly high-ranking Christians and their families to Islam took place throughout the early period of Ayyubid rule. According to historian Yaakov Lev, the persecution of non-Muslims had some permanent effects on them, but nonetheless, the effects were local and contained. To manage Mediterranean trade, the Ayyubids permitted Europeans—mainly Italians, but also French and Catalans—to settle in Alexandria in large numbers. However, {{in the aftermath of}} the Fifth Crusade, 3,000 merchants from the area were arrested or expelled.|$|E
50|$|Imparted righteousness, in Methodist theology, is that gracious gift of God {{given at}} the moment of the new birth which enables a <b>Christian</b> disciple <b>to</b> strive for holiness and sanctification. John Wesley {{believed}} that imparted righteousness worked in tandem with imputed righteousness. Imputed righteousness is the righteousness of Jesus credited <b>to</b> the <b>Christian,</b> enabling the <b>Christian</b> <b>to</b> be justified; imparted righteousness is what God does in Christ by the power of the Holy Spirit after justification, working in the <b>Christian</b> <b>to</b> enable and empower the process of sanctification (and, in Wesleyan thought, Christian perfection).|$|R

5|$|During the High Middle Ages, {{which began}} after 1000, the {{population}} of Europe increased greatly as technological and agricultural innovations allowed trade to flourish and the Medieval Warm Period climate change allowed crop yields to increase. Manorialism, the organisation of peasants into villages that owed rent and labour services to the nobles, and feudalism, the political structure whereby knights and lower-status nobles owed military service to their overlords {{in return for the}} right to rent from lands and manors, were two of the ways society was organised in the High Middle Ages. The Crusades, first preached in 1095, were military attempts by Western European <b>Christians</b> <b>to</b> regain control of the Holy Land from Muslims. Kings became the heads of centralised nation states, reducing crime and violence but making the ideal of a unified Christendom more distant. Intellectual life was marked by scholasticism, a philosophy that emphasised joining faith to reason, and by the founding of universities. The theology of Thomas Aquinas, the paintings of Giotto, the poetry of Dante and Chaucer, the travels of Marco Polo, and the Gothic architecture of cathedrals such as Chartres are among the outstanding achievements toward the end of this period and into the Late Middle Ages.|$|E
5|$|From the {{beginning}} of Christianity through the tenth century, Christian theologians saw the Eucharist as the church's participation in Christ's sacrifice. Christ {{was believed to be}} present in the Eucharist, but there were differences over the way in which this occurred. The School of Antioch in the Eastern Roman Empire, along with Hilary of Poitiers and Ambrose in the Western Roman Empire, taught a realist, metabolic, or somatic view, where the elements of the Eucharist were believed to be changed into Christ's body and blood. The influential fourth-century Western theologian Augustine of Hippo, on the other hand, held that Christ is really present in the elements of the Eucharist, but not in a bodily manner, because his body remains in heaven. Augustine believed the Eucharist is a spiritual eating which allows <b>Christians</b> <b>to</b> become part of Christ's body. Western theologians in the three centuries following Augustine did not elaborate on the way Christ is present in the Eucharist, but emphasized the transforming power of the sacrament.|$|E
5|$|In the Reformed confessions, the Lord's Supper is a {{meal that}} {{provides}} spiritual nourishment. Eating {{the body and}} drinking the blood of Christ in the sacrament is believed to spiritually strengthen Christians. Believers are already believed to be united with Christ, but the Supper serves to deepen and strengthen this union. The Supper is also a way to commemorate and proclaim the death and resurrection of Christ. Partakers are to express gratitude and praise to God in thanks for his death and the benefits it provides. The Supper is believed to assure Christians of their salvation and union with Christ, which has been communicated {{to them in the}} preaching of the gospel. The Supper is also believed to enhance Christians' union with one another. It calls <b>Christians</b> <b>to</b> love and obey Christ, and to live in harmony with other Christians.|$|E
