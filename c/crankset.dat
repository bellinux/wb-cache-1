25|$|The <b>crankset</b> {{that drives}} a bicycle via the pedals.|$|E
25|$|Pedal {{power is}} simple, efficient, and practical. There are {{essentially}} two designs, the reciprocating treadle and the rotating pedal <b>crankset.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{the context}} of road cycling, compact {{drivetrain}} typically refers to double cranksets with a smaller (usually 110mm) bolt circle diameter than the standard 130mm or Campagnolo's 135mm. As of 2006, {{all of the major}} component manufacturers such as Shimano and Campagnolo offer compact cranks in their midrange and high-end product lines. The compact <b>crankset</b> provides a compromise between the standard road double <b>crankset</b> (with 39/52 or 39/53 tooth chainrings) and the road triple (with 30/42/52 or 30/39/53 tooth chainrings). The compact <b>crankset</b> has two chainrings and typical ratios are 34/48, 34/50 and 36/50. This provides nearly the same lower gear ratios as a triple but without the need for a third chainring, a triple front derailleur and a long cage rear derailleur. Both Shimano and Campagnolo recommend and sell front derailleurs specifically designed for compact cranksets, claiming better shifting.|$|E
25|$|There are tandem <b>cranksets</b> {{available}} called independent pedaling system <b>cranksets,</b> {{which allow}} each cyclist to pedal, or not, {{at their own}} pace.|$|R
50|$|They {{also make}} handcycles and <b>cranksets.</b>|$|R
50|$|These units require {{specific}} cranks or <b>cranksets,</b> but can {{be relatively}} simple to interchange between bikes, depending on compatibility.|$|R
25|$|Note that if {{a normal}} right-side-drive <b>crankset</b> is {{installed}} backwards to create a left-side-drive bicycle, the threaded pedal holes {{at the end of}} the crank arms would be reversed. In this configuration, precession may loosen the pedals over time, causing the pedals to become detached and/or damaging the pedal threading in the crank arms. A front <b>crankset</b> designed for tandem use is a commercially available option, since this has a chainring for the timing chain on the left side, though choice of chainring sizes may be limited.|$|E
25|$|Chainrings {{designed}} for use with multi-chainring crank arms may have ramps or pins to aid in shifting. The middle chainring, {{in the case of}} a triple <b>crankset,</b> usually has the most shaping to aid in shifting up and down. The smallest chainring usually has the least, if any shaping.|$|E
25|$|Usually, {{the rear}} hub {{is the best}} {{component}} on which one can operate chainline adjustments, especially on threaded hubs. If a track hub is used, it’s better to operate on the bottom bracket or - for minor shifts - on the <b>crankset.</b> The same occurs if a flip-flop hub is used, because the chainline {{should be the same}} in both sides (freewheel and fixed gear).|$|E
50|$|Bontrager took on product {{development}} at Trek, designing handlebars, handlebar stems, bar ends, seatposts, tires, <b>cranksets</b> and rims and wheels.|$|R
50|$|TIME Sport International is a French {{manufacturer}} of bicycles and cycling equipment, including bicycle frames, cycling shoes, clipless bicycle pedals, <b>cranksets,</b> and gloves.|$|R
5000|$|Specialized's [...] "S-Works" [...] {{top-level}} racing {{mountain bike}} <b>cranksets</b> use a Hirth joint with a center hex-head threaded rod {{to secure the}} crank halves together.|$|R
25|$|The gearing {{supplied}} by the manufacturer on a new bicycle is selected to be useful {{to the majority of}} people. Some cyclists choose to fine-tune the gearing to better suit their strength, level of fitness, and expected use. When buying from specialist cycle shops, it may be less expensive to get the gears altered before delivery rather than at some later date. Modern <b>crankset</b> chainrings can be swapped out, as can cogsets.|$|E
25|$|At {{least one}} {{manufacturer}} offers a <b>crankset</b> {{in which the}} crank arms may rotate independently. This is supposed to aid in training by requiring each leg to move its own pedal in a full circle. One independent study has demonstrated training with these cranks can improve cycling efficiency. The manufacturer also claims that this change can also be useful to aid in running improvement, help prevent injuries in runners, improve core strength development, and are useful for the rehabilitation of lower extremity injuries, especially in the athlete. The manufacturer claims these cranks {{have been used as}} a training tool by several World and Olympic Champions in both cycling and triathlon and several professional sports teams including MLB and NFL teams, and other uses.|$|E
25|$|Some components, {{which are}} often {{optional}} accessories on sports bicycles, are standard features on utility bicycles to enhance their usefulness, comfort, safety and visibility. Mudguards, or fenders, protect the cyclist and moving parts from spray when riding through wet areas and chainguards protect clothes from oil on the chain while preventing clothing from being caught between the chain and <b>crankset</b> teeth. Kick stands keep bicycles upright when parked, and bike locks deter theft. Front-mounted baskets, front or rear luggage carriers or racks, and panniers mounted above either or both wheels {{can be used to}} carry equipment or cargo. Pegs can be fastened to one, or both of the wheel hubs to either help the rider perform certain tricks, or allow a place for extra riders to stand, or rest. Parents sometimes add rear-mounted child seats, an auxiliary saddle fitted to the crossbar, or both to transport children. Training wheels are sometimes used when learning to ride.|$|E
5000|$|... double (Standard) : These are {{intended}} {{to be used with}} <b>cranksets</b> having two chainrings. When viewed {{from the side of the}} bicycle, the inner and outer plates of the cage have roughly the same profile.|$|R
25|$|Cheaper <b>cranksets</b> {{may have}} the chainrings welded or riveted {{directly}} to the crank arm or spider. More expensive sets have the chainrings bolted on {{so that they can}} be replaced if worn or damaged, or to provide different gearing.|$|R
50|$|Alfine is {{the name}} of a comfort and urban {{oriented}} product series by Shimano. It is mainly known for internally geared hubs, but includes also hydraulic disc brakes and levers, chain tensioners, dynamo hubs, <b>cranksets,</b> shift levers, and complete wheels.|$|R
25|$|In practice, this {{relationship}} {{can be observed}} in bicycles: Bicycles are typically composed of two road wheels, front and rear gears (referred to as sprockets) meshing with a circular chain, and a derailleur mechanism if the bicycle's transmission system allows multiple gear ratios to be used (i.e. multi-speed bicycle), all of which attached to the frame. A cyclist, the person who rides the bicycle, provides the input power by turning pedals, thereby cranking the front sprocket (commonly referred to as chainring). The input power provided by the cyclist is equal to the product of cadence (i.e. the number of pedal revolutions per minute) and the torque on spindle of the bicycle's <b>crankset.</b> The bicycle's drivetrain transmits the input power to the road wheel, which in turn conveys the received power to the road as the output power of the bicycle. Depending on the gear ratio of the bicycle, a (torque, rpm)input pair is converted to a (torque, rpm)output pair. By using a larger rear gear, or by switching to a lower gear in multi-speed bicycles, angular speed of the road wheels is decreased while the torque is increased, product of which (i.e. power) does not change.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most common}} tandem <b>crankset</b> {{is a set}} of four cranks. [...] Both left cranks have spiders and chainrings to be {{connected}} by a timing chain, and only one of the right cranks has a spider for the drive chain.|$|E
2500|$|A planetary-gear <b>crankset</b> {{offers two}} {{different}} gear ratios {{with just one}} chainring. This can {{have at least two}} advantages: shifting while not pedaling and fewer chances for the chain to come off the chainring. [...] The Mountain Drive & Speed-Drive by Schlumpf Innovations and the Hammerschmidt are examples.|$|E
2500|$|The Rotor crank was {{developed}} by Aeronautic Engineering School students in Madrid, Spain in 1995 and was later commercialised. While Rotor cranks have found success with recreational road and mountain cyclists, many competitive cyclists continue to use the traditional fixed system as offered by major manufacturers Campagnolo and Shimano, amongst others. [...] One major factor is weight—Rotor cranks are 50%–75% heavier than most competitive cranks. [...] Other negative factors include higher purchase cost than other fine <b>cranksets,</b> and increased maintenance due {{to the complexity of}} the system. [...] These <b>cranksets</b> are no longer in production, and availability of some parts is problematic. [...] However the bearings are standard parts. [...] A few parts, like links, are still distributed.|$|R

5000|$|Distinctive {{components}} made by Surly {{include the}} Dingle cog, <b>cranksets</b> with separately detachable spiders, a reversible chain tensioner, and the [...] "Large Marge," [...] {{one of the}} first production fatbike rims. Surly also sells lifestyle items such as wool jerseys and flasks bearing the Surly logo.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>crankset</b> (in the US) or {{chainset}} (in the UK), is {{the component}} of a bicycle drivetrain that converts the reciprocating motion of the rider's legs into rotational motion used to drive the chain or belt, which in turn drives the rear wheel. It consists {{of one or more}} sprockets, also called chainrings ...|$|E
2500|$|The term often {{refers to}} a human-powered crank {{which is used to}} {{manually}} turn an axle, as in a bicycle <b>crankset</b> or a brace and bit drill. [...] In this case a person's arm or leg serves as the connecting rod, applying reciprocating force to the crank. There is usually a bar perpendicular {{to the other end of}} the arm, often with a freely rotatable handle or [...] attached.|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} table {{provides some}} {{comparison of the}} various methods of measuring gears (the particular numbers are for bicycles with 170mm cranks, 700C wheels, and 25mm tyres). Speeds for several cadences in revolutions per minute are also given. [...] On each row the relative values for gear inches, metres of development, gain ratio, and speed {{are more or less}} correct, while the front/rear values are the nearest approximation which can be made using typical chainring and cogset sizes. Note that bicycles intended for racing may have a lowest gear of around 45 gear inches (or 35 if fitted with a compact <b>crankset).</b>|$|E
50|$|SRAM is a {{standout}} among component manufacturers that has consistently assigned equal value to women’s cycling. Products and technologies that reflect that {{commitment to the}} broad range of female riders’ needs include shifter Reach Adjust, WiFLi (wide range road gearing options), Quarq <b>cranksets</b> available in down to 162.5mm lengths, and 36 cm wide Zipp handlebars.|$|R
50|$|On November 6, 2007, SRAM {{acquired}} Zipp Speed Weaponry, {{a company}} designing and manufacturing high-end carbon wheelsets {{for use on}} road racing bicycles, {{as well as other}} high-end components such as <b>cranksets,</b> handlebars, stems and wheels. The company operates out of Indianapolis, Indiana and produces all of its carbon fiber rims at the company's American factory.|$|R
2500|$|Some <b>cranksets</b> {{have been}} {{produced}} that incorporate a ratcheting mechanism to accommodate coasting. In this case, the chain continues to rotate with the rear wheel when the rider stops pedaling. [...] The ultimate goal of freewheeling cranks is to allow the rider to shift the chain while coasting. [...] Shimano's discontinued FF system (Front Freewheeling) {{is one of the}} more commonly seen examples.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the context}} of {{mountain}} biking the term compact <b>crankset,</b> or micro drive, refers to smaller triple cranksets, giving a small benefit in weight {{at the expense of}} increased wear and also giving the bike better clearance over obstacles. [...] Typical ratios would be 22/32/44 teeth as opposed to 28/38/48 or 24/36/46 teeth. [...] These would be used with smaller cassettes (Generally cassettes are available with 11 tooth minimum gear sizes for compact chainsets while standard chainsets were designed for cassettes with a 13 or 14 tooth top gear), giving the same overall ratio. Compact chainrings have been the dominant standard for mountain bike cranks since the mid nineties.|$|E
2500|$|Rotor is a {{trade name}} of a type of crank used in the {{transmission}} system of a bicycle. Unlike a standard pair of cranks that always remain at 180 degrees relative to each other, the Rotor system varies this angle through the circle of motion. The chainrings also speed up and slow down, which increases and decreases {{the size of the}} gear temporarily as the <b>crankset</b> rotates. [...] The effect of these movements minimizes the dead spot (where little power is produced) at {{the top and bottom of}} the pedaling cycle, and reduces knee strain. [...] The manufacturer claims that power output relative to heart rate is increased, amongst other claimed benefits.|$|E
2500|$|It takes {{a couple}} of weeks of regular use to become {{accustomed}} to the unusual feel of the Rotor linkage cranksets. [...] After becoming accustomed to it, most riders prefer it. [...] However, there is no difficulty in switching between ordinary cranksets and Rotor linkage cranksets. [...] Once a rider has learned to use Rotor linkage cranksets the adaption when switching back and forth between <b>crankset</b> types only takes a minute or two. [...] Many competitive cyclists, including the Cervélo TestTeam, use Rotor's Q-rings which mimic the fluctuation in gear size without the added weight. However Rotor Q-rings and other non-round rings cannot duplicate the crank arm movements that allow application of power through the dead spots of the pedaling cycle. [...] Non-round rings also increase the difficulty of setting up the front derailleur, while Rotor linkage cranksets present no extra difficulty in that regard.|$|E
50|$|The {{company was}} first to market with dimpled discs and rims (they also own the patent), to induce {{boundary}} layer turbulence and prevent detached airflow in crosswinds. Zipp has done pioneering research in aerodynamics, using various high tech wind tunnels, and has published advanced papers in this area. The company {{was also the first}} to produce disc wheels, deep section rims, and <b>cranksets</b> using carbon fiber technology.|$|R
5000|$|... triple (Alpine) : Derailleurs {{designed}} {{to be used with}} <b>cranksets</b> having three chainrings, or with two chainrings that differ greatly in size. When viewed {{from the side of the}} bicycle, the inner cage plate extends further towards the bottom bracket's center of rotation than the outer cage plate does. This is to help shift the chain from the smallest ring onto the middle ring more easily.|$|R
50|$|Patents for {{built-in}} {{systems to}} change gear ratios appeared as early as 1890. Adler offered a three-speed gearbox bicycle in the 1930s. Several attempts to develop gearbox bicycles during the 2000s for downhill racing, such as the Honda RN-01 G-cross, incorporated complete derailleur gear drive trains in an enclosure. Around the same time Schlumpf Innovations and Hammerschmidt offered <b>cranksets</b> with two different gear ratios and just one chainring. Pinion launched their spur-gear system in the 2010s.|$|R
