40|$|New {{funding for}} MPs 2 ̆ 7 offices {{increases}} {{the benefits of}} incumbency, writes Norm Kelly THE HOWARD government recently announced that all MPs and senators would receive an increase in staff, from three to four full-time employees. This announcement, apparently timed to ensure new staff are on board for the election campaign later this year, has understandably been met with suspicion and cynicism by the wider public. Such concern {{stems from the fact}} that the Coalition is the obvious major beneficiary, with 126 of the 226 parliamentarians, and also because of the political manner in which resources can be deployed. In his announcement Special Minister of State Gary Nairn said that the additional resources were to meet the increased constituent demand brought about by improved communications and technology, but there appears to be a lack of supporting evidence provided to back up this claim. It has also been suggested that the increase was driven from the prime minister’s office, which may indicate that the upcoming election is a greater factor in the decision. So, what is a fair level of staff resources for MPs who have more than 87, 000 constituents to represent on average? The recent Democratic Audit report (PDF) by Sally Young and Joo-Cheong Tham identifies MPs’ staff costs in 2001 - 02 as being almost 450, 000 for each MP. With the addition of one more staff, and salary and other increases over the past five years, this figure is more likely to be now about 700, 000 per MP. By comparison, British MPs are provided with an 84, 000 (A 210, 000) salary allowance to service about 70, 000 constituents. Canadian MPs, with 75, 000 constituents each, receive C 275, 000 (A 300, 000) a year to cover not only salary costs, but also the cost of office rental and equipment. While such comparisons require further analysis (eg, average wage costs and other allowances) to provide a truly accurate picture, these raw figures indicate that Australia’s federal MPs were already well provided for in terms of staffing support, even before this latest increase. What is of greater concern is the type of work that taxpayer-funded staff are allowed to do. In other countries, it is common for there to be strict rules preventing parliamentarians’ staff from using the public purse to engage in political party work. In Australia, it is widely accepted there is blatant use of parliamentary resources to engage in party activities. Such misuse of public funds is not only tolerated, but encouraged. This places incumbent MPs and parties at a distinct advantage over other candidates at an election. A pivotal point in the use of MPs’ offices for party electioneering purposes occurred in 2004, when just five weeks before the election, the Howard government approved MPs to use their printing allowances for the production of election campaign material. This is a deliberate abuse of parliamentary resources, but the announcement (a quiet memo from the Department of Finance), made during the height of an election campaign, largely passed without notice. Additional ways that incumbent MPs gain electoral advantage include access to the full electoral roll in electronic form (not available to other election candidates), the use of their printing allowance of 150, 000 per year (increased from 125, 000 last year), and postage allowance (up from 27, 500 to 45, 000 in 2005). In many ways an electorate office has effectively become campaign headquarters. Coalition and Labor politicians generally see incumbency benefits as a non-issue, for three main reasons. The first is obvious they are the beneficiaries! MPs also perceive this as not being an election issue, expecting voters will concentrate on other mainstream policy areas, such as the economy, industrial relations and health, once the election campaign starts in earnest. Finally, there are no major policy differences between the Coalition and Labor on parliamentary entitlements. Both sides want to enjoy the benefits of incumbency, and would be concerned with a back-bench backlash if it was suggested that allowances should be trimmed. The only opponents to these increased entitlements appear to be the minor parties and independents, who are trying to compete against the major parties at elections. Parties and candidates without any parliamentary representation are at an even greater disadvantage at election time. However, there is an opportunity for Labor to make a clear policy statement on this issue ahead of the election. By promoting a stricter application of allowances, and supporting a reduction in excessive printing and <b>communications</b> <b>allowances,</b> this would provide a clear distinction to Coalition policy and hopefully elevate MPs’ entitlements as an election issue. What Labor MPs may lose in future entitlements may be compensated by increased voter support. At worst, it could pressure the government into curtailing some of the excessive increases it has presided over in recent years. It is unfortunate that increases in parliamentary entitlements attract a cynical response, as MPs have many demands on their resources. However, the nature and method in determining these increases invite suspicion, and allow the needs of MPs to be blurred by using incumbency to gain an unfair partisan advantage in elections. • Norm Kelly is a member of the Democratic Audit at the Australian National University.
