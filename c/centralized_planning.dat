25|$|In 2010, Fidel Castro, in {{agreement}} with Raúl Castro's reformist sentiment, admitted that the Cuban model based on the old Soviet model of <b>centralized</b> <b>planning</b> was no longer sustainable.

25|$|Concerning rural water supply, in 2004 the {{government}} established {{a policy of}} decentralization, foreseeing to transfer the responsibility for operating and maintaining rural water systems from the state to local communities. Implementation has initially been slow, but picked up over time. In March 2009 a decree transferred the ownership of piped systems in small towns outside the ONEA service area to municipalities, which in turn contract out operation and maintenance to local private operators or to ONEA. According to the World Bank, before decentralization the development of rural services suffered from an overly <b>centralized</b> <b>planning</b> and investment process, which bypassed local governments. Rural water supply was, {{and to some extent}} still is, characterized by a diversity of project rules, implementation approaches, and technical options that are left to the discretion of financing agencies and NGOs.|$|E
500|$|Progressive Era reformers {{sought to}} improve {{municipal}} government by such changes as the commission system, city planning, and zoning controls. The interests of white business and residential districts were protected, but sometimes {{at the expense}} of blacks who lived in segregated neighborhoods. Fairbanks (1999) explores the changing assumptions about city planning and government among the city's leaders. [...] Dissatisfied with its haphazard development they endorsed <b>centralized</b> <b>planning</b> and wrote and secured the adoption of a new charter and set up a board of commissioners. The commission structure, however, caused government officials to view the city in separate parts rather than as a whole. By the 1920s supporters of comprehensive planning were calling for a program that included adoption of council-manager government, a citywide zoning policy, and public funds for improvements in parks, sewers, schools, and city streets. Voters approved the bond proposals and charter amendments in 1927 and 1930. Dallas thus achieved a more coordinated government which was theoretically more aware of the city's needs and more able to treat those needs equally {{for the benefit of the}} city as a whole.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Centralized</b> <b>planning</b> is {{inherently}} undemocratic in Hayek's view, {{because it requires}} [...] "that the will of a small minority be imposed upon the people". The power of these minorities to act by taking money or property in pursuit of centralized goals, destroys the Rule of Law and individual freedoms. Where there is <b>centralized</b> <b>planning,</b> [...] "the individual would more than ever become a mere means, {{to be used by}} the authority in the service of such abstractions as the 'social welfare' or the 'good of the community'". Even the very poor have more personal freedom in an open society than a centrally planned one. [...] "hile the last resort of a competitive economy is the bailiff, the ultimate sanction of a planned economy is the hangman." [...] Socialism is a hypocritical system, because its professed humanitarian goals can only be put into practice by brutal methods [...] "of which most socialists disapprove". Such centralized systems also require effective propaganda, so that the people come to believe that the state's goals are theirs.|$|E
2500|$|Eric Zencey {{wrote that}} the free market economy Hayek {{advocated}} is designed for an infinite planet, and when it runs into physical limits (as any growing system must), {{the result is a}} need for <b>centralized</b> <b>planning</b> to mediate the problematic interface of economy and nature. [...] "Planning is planning, whether it's done to minimize poverty and injustice, as socialists were advocating then, or to preserve the minimum flow of ecosystem services that civilization requires, as we are finding increasingly necessary today." ...|$|E

2500|$|Dr. Hopper was {{initially}} sympathetic to Soviet efforts to collectivize industry and agriculture under state control, believing the United States could benefit by emulating their <b>centralized</b> <b>planning</b> models. His {{writing in the}} early 1930s reflected his belief that the Bolsheviks were modernizing [...] "backward" [...] portions of Asia by advancing industrialization in the Far East, a positive improvement in his estimation. In the early 1930s he correctly predicted that rising Soviet power and influence in the Far East would lead to conflict there with the United States. In view of the famines and widespread starvation that gripped Soviet Russia in 1930s, Hopper coined the phrase that Russia was ready to [...] "starve itself great".|$|E
2500|$|Hayek {{argues that}} Western democracies, {{including}} the United Kingdom and the United States, have [...] "progressively abandoned that freedom in economic affairs without which {{personal and political}} freedom has never existed in the past". Society has mistakenly tried to ensure continuing prosperity by <b>centralized</b> <b>planning,</b> which inevitably leads to totalitarianism. [...] "We have in effect undertaken to dispense with the forces which produced unforeseen results and to replace the impersonal and anonymous mechanism of the market by collective and ‘conscious’ direction of all social forces to deliberately chosen goals." [...] Socialism, while presented {{as a means of}} assuring equality, does so through [...] "restraint and servitude", while [...] "democracy seeks equality in liberty". Planning, because it is coercive, is an inferior method of regulation, while the competition of a free market is superior [...] "because it is the only method by which our activities can be adjusted to each other without coercive or arbitrary intervention of authority".|$|E
2500|$|In 2004, the CTA, {{projecting}} a $55 million funding {{shortfall in}} its 2005 budget, {{called for a}} [...] "long term funding solution," [...] involving a change to the sales tax distribution formula in the RTA Act. In response, the Illinois General Assembly appropriated $54 million {{to cover the cost}} of CTA's paratransit service for 2005. An amendment to the RTA Act [...] made the RTA responsible for the funding, financial review and oversight of all ADA paratransit services, effective July 1, 2005, and transferred responsibility for operating or providing for the operation of paratransit service to Pace starting July 1, 2006, thereby relieving the CTA of that responsibility. The General Assembly also directed the Illinois Auditor General to audit the RTA and the Service Boards, as part of its review of the funding issue. The Auditor General's preliminary report, while agreeing that public funding was insufficient to support the level of transit services, said that the legislature must address other issues, including underfunded pensions, high salaries, absenteeism, and the lack of strong, <b>centralized</b> <b>planning,</b> resulting in several of the service boards competing for customers in the same areas, the Auditor General calling for [...] "an end to the transit agencies fighting each other for customers, routes and federal funding for pet projects that may not fit into an overall regional transit plan." ...|$|E

50|$|Rather than <b>centralize</b> <b>planning</b> and {{decision-making}} {{at the state}} level, the GMA focuses on local control.

After his exile, he died in Ephesus. This ancient tradition, and the <b>centralized</b> <b>plan</b> of the church, customary for votive oratories on the sites of martyrdoms, support the 5th-century origin of this foundation.|$|R
