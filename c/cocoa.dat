5|$|Among {{the tourist}} attractions in Tawau are: The Tawau International Cultural Festival, Tawau Bell Tower, Japanese War Cemetery, Confrontation Memorial, Teck Guan <b>Cocoa</b> Museum, Tawau Hills National Park, Bukit Gemok, and Tawau Tanjung Markets. The main {{economic}} {{activities of the}} town are: timber, <b>cocoa,</b> oil palm plantations, and prawn farming.|$|E
5|$|As of 1993, {{there were}} 40 timber-processing plants {{and a number}} of sawmills. Tawau Port is a major export and import gateway for timber {{especially}} from North Kalimantan. A barter trade has been formalised between East Kalimantan (now North Kalimantan) and Sabah with the creation of Tawau Barter Trade Association (BATS) in 1993. The association handles the cash-based trade of raw materials from Indonesia, but in recent years has focussed on timber industry. Other than timber, since British rule ended exports have traditionally been spices, <b>cocoa</b> and tobacco. Birds' nests are harvested at Baturong, Sengarung, Tepadung and Madai Caves by the Ida'an community. Tawau {{is one of the top}} <b>cocoa</b> producers in Malaysia, and the world together with Ivory Coast, Ghana and Indonesia. The town is the <b>cocoa</b> capital for both in Sabah and Malaysia. <b>Cocoa</b> production is mostly concentrated in the interior, north of the town, while palm oil production is concentrated along the roads to Merotai, Brantian, Semporna and Kunak. Both <b>cocoa</b> and palm oil are part of the large agriculture sector that has become the main income producer for the town.|$|E
5|$|Hot chocolate, {{also known}} as hot <b>cocoa,</b> {{drinking}} chocolate or just <b>cocoa</b> is a heated beverage consisting of shaved chocolate, melted chocolate or <b>cocoa</b> powder, heated milk or water, and usually a sweetener. Hot chocolate may be topped with whipped cream. Hot chocolate made with melted chocolate is sometimes called drinking chocolate, characterized by less sweetness and a thicker consistency.|$|E
5|$|The Tawau International Cultural Festival is {{an annual}} event, first held in 2011, {{that has been}} {{promoted}} for its potential to attract tourists. The Tawau Bell Tower in the town's park was built by the Japanese in 1921 shortly after World War I to mark the close allied relations between Japan and Great Britain. Other historical attractions include the Japanese War Cemetery, Confrontation Memorial, the Public Service Memorial and the Twin Town Memorial. Tawau {{is one of the}} top <b>cocoa</b> production centres in Malaysia. The Teck Guan <b>Cocoa</b> Museum has become one of the important historical attractions for the town since it was founded in the 1970s by Datuk Seri Panglima Hong Teck Guan. Varieties of <b>cocoa</b> products including chocolate jam and hot <b>cocoa</b> beverages are sold in the museum.|$|E
5|$|The {{flavonoids}} {{found in}} the <b>cocoa</b> that makes up hot chocolate also {{have a positive effect}} on arterial health. A particular study performed by the National Institutes of Health partially supported by Mars Chocolate company showed high amounts of improvement in blood flow after drinking a flavanol-rich <b>cocoa</b> beverage. In the study, the subjects (27 people ages 18 to 72) drank a <b>cocoa</b> drink containing 900 milligrams of flavonols every day, which resulted in an improvement in blood flow and the function of endothelial cells that line blood vessels.|$|E
5|$|The storms {{severely}} damaged crops on Dominica, particularly <b>cocoa.</b> After {{several years of}} increasing amounts of exported <b>cocoa,</b> there was a decrease of approximately 1.86% in pounds between 1902–03 and 1903-04. In Puerto Rico, there was high winds and heavy rainfall along the north coast of the island.|$|E
5|$|Although hot {{chocolate}} is generally consumed for pleasure, the beverage confers several potential health benefits. A 2003 study from Cornell University found that <b>cocoa</b> contains {{large amounts of}} antioxidants that may help prevent cancer. Also, it has been demonstrated that the <b>cocoa</b> bean helps with digestion. From the 16th to 19th centuries, {{hot chocolate}} was valued as a medicine {{as well as a}} drink.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1978, {{the economy}} of Côte d'Ivoire {{experienced}} a serious decline due to the sharp downturn in international market prices of coffee and <b>cocoa.</b> The decline was perceived as fleeting, since its impact on planters was buffered by the Caistab, the agricultural marketing board, which ensured them a livable income. The next year, in order to contain a sudden drop in the prices of exported goods, Houphouët-Boigny raised prices to resist international tariffs on raw materials. However, by applying only this solution, Côte d'Ivoire lost more than 700billion CFA francs between 1980 and 1982. From 1983 to 1984, Côte d'Ivoire fell victim to a drought that ravaged nearly 400,000 hectares of forest and 250,000 hectares of coffee and <b>cocoa</b> plants. To address this problem, Houphouët-Boigny travelled to London to negotiate an agreement on coffee and <b>cocoa</b> prices with traders and industrialists; by 1984, the agreement had fallen apart and Côte d'Ivoire was engulfed in a major financial crisis.|$|E
5|$|Cupuaçu {{butter is}} closely {{analogous}} to <b>cocoa,</b> {{and is used}} to make white chocolate.|$|E
5|$|Illipe butter, {{from the}} nuts of the Shorea stenoptera. Similar to <b>cocoa</b> butter, {{but with a}} higher melting point. Used in cosmetics.|$|E
5|$|Kola nut (Cola spp.), from a West African {{relative}} of the <b>cocoa</b> tree, is {{the origin of the}} cola flavor in soft drinks.|$|E
5|$|Shea butter, much {{of which}} is {{produced}} by poor, African women. Used primarily in skin care products and {{as a substitute for}} <b>cocoa</b> butter in confections and cosmetics.|$|E
5|$|Borneo tallow nut oil, {{extracted}} from the fruit of species of genus Shorea. Used {{as a substitute for}} <b>cocoa</b> butter, and to make soap, candles, cosmetics and medicines in places where the tree is common.|$|E
5|$|Early {{the next}} year, he {{returned}} and witnessed the successful launch of Explorer 1 on January 31, 1958, {{all the while}} calling in his reports to WALB. Eventually, Barbree was hired by radio station WEZY in <b>Cocoa</b> Beach, {{and worked as a}} traffic reporter, covering the space program as well.|$|E
5|$|June 4, 1968– Tropical Storm Abby moves ashore near Punta Gorda, {{spawning}} 3 small tornadoes {{and producing}} up to 14.2inches (361mm) of precipitation at <b>Cocoa.</b> The rainfall is beneficial and ends a severe, persistent drought in the state. The storm causes six indirect {{deaths in the}} state.|$|E
5|$|Later Lowestoffe {{detained}} a Danish schooner sailing from Acuba to Jacquemel with a {{cargo of}} cattle. She also recaptured the British brig John, which a French privateer had taken, and herself took a Spanish brig sailing from La Guaira to Tenerife with a cargo of <b>cocoa</b> and spices.|$|E
5|$|Madagascar {{is known}} for its {{high-quality}} <b>cocoa</b> and vanilla, much of which are exported. In the coastal areas of Madagascar or in upscale inland restaurants, vanilla may be used to prepare savory sauces for poultry.|$|E
5|$|Outside Orlando, {{there are}} campuses in <b>Cocoa,</b> Clermont, Daytona Beach, Kissimmee, Leesburg, Ocala, Palm Bay, and Sanford. In {{addition}} to having standard classes at these campuses, some courses are offered via alternative methods, such as two-way TV from the main campus or via broadband.|$|E
5|$|September 2009 saw {{the move}} to Fairtrade <b>cocoa</b> beans in Cadbury's Dairy Milk, and a new record label based on Gorilla's {{campaign}} ("A Glass and a Half") saw the advert/song Zingolo.|$|E
5|$|The Thomas S. Jones organ {{builders}} {{were based}} at No.25 Pentonville Road between 1860 and 1935. The Dunn & Hewett <b>cocoa</b> factory was established at No.9 Pentonville Road in 1833 by Daniel Dunn, {{who went into}} partnership with Charles Hewett in the 1850s. The business claimed to have invented soluble chocolate and <b>cocoa,</b> and moved to No.136, expanding to No.138 in the 1870s. The building was enlarged and partially rebuilt over the 1880s and 90s, and included a staff tea-room at No.140 by 1907. The factory closed around 1930 and was subsequently sub-let to various businesses. The Ealing Radiator Company was established at Nos.152–154 Pentonville Road in 1936, manufacturing car radiators. A first floor extension was added in 1952, while Nos.136–150 were cleared to accommodate a low metal-framed building. These premises have now been sub-let to various businesses.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the {{courtroom}} scene, the Kool-Aid Man is seen breaking through a wall, which later became a running gag in the series involving a certain character or breaking through a wall and Peter's job as a Mascot is a parody of the <b>Cocoa</b> Puffs commercial.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally {{most of the}} Chiquitos tribes practiced swidden agriculture, growing maize and yuca on a small scale. After {{contact with}} the Spanish, <b>cocoa</b> and rice also were cultivated. Hunting and fishing {{provided}} additional nutrition in the dry season. The Jesuits introduced cattle breeding.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture {{damage was}} widespread. Across the country 40% of the {{sugarcane}} crop, 80–100% of the banana crop, 75% {{of the coffee}} trees under three years old, and 20% of {{the top layer of}} the <b>cocoa</b> crop were lost to the storm. Insured damage in Jamaica was initially estimated at around US$1.5billion, but post-storm analysis showed that it was closer to US$310million.|$|E
5|$|As World War I {{continued}} in Europe {{and increased the}} demand for defense-related shipping, American-Hawaiian stopped its sugar service. Ohioans specific activities during this time are not known. She {{may have been in}} the half of the American-Hawaiian fleet that was chartered for transatlantic service, or she may have been in the group of American-Hawaiian ships chartered for service to South America, delivering coal, gasoline, and steel in exchange for coffee, nitrates, <b>cocoa,</b> rubber, and manganese ore.|$|E
5|$|At age seventy-seven, Barbree {{is one of}} the longest-serving network correspondents to work {{continuously}} on {{a single}} subject. He started working for NBC on July 21, 1958 covering the space program, and continues in that capacity to the present. He has never missed a mission launch, despite suffering a heart attack while jogging along <b>Cocoa</b> Beach in 1987, and being declared clinically dead for several minutes. Following his heart attack, he had bypass surgery, and still did not miss any launches.|$|E
5|$|Born to Tammye and Mike Harris in <b>Cocoa</b> Beach, Florida, Ashlyn {{was raised}} with her older brother, Chris. Growing up, {{she looked up}} to her brother and {{frequently}} joined him and his friends skateboarding and surfing. Until the age of 14, she played club soccer with the boys teams. She first played for the Palm Bay Rangers and South Brevard United before playing for the Seminole Ice girls team. In 2003, Harris won the state championship with the U-17 Indialantic Force.|$|E
5|$|Conclusions on dietary {{components}} have {{at times}} {{been difficult to}} ascertain as results have differed between population-based studies and randomised controlled trials. There is limited evidence that light to moderate use of alcohol, particularly red wine, is associated with lower risk of AD. There is tentative evidence that caffeine may be protective. A number of foods high in flavonoids such as <b>cocoa,</b> red wine, and tea may decrease the risk of AD.|$|E
5|$|Eichmann told Brand that {{he wanted}} 10,000 new trucks for the Waffen-SS to use on the Eastern front, one truck for every 100 Jews, as well as 200 tons of tea, 200 tons of <b>cocoa,</b> 800 tons of coffee and 2,000,000 cases of soap. If Brand {{returned}} from Istanbul with confirmation that the Allies had accepted the proposal, Eichmann said he would release 10 percent of the one million. The deal would proceed with 100,000 Jews released for every 1,000 trucks.|$|E
5|$|In Mesoamerica, wild {{teosinte}} {{was transformed}} through human selection into the ancestor of modern maize, more than 6,000 years ago. It gradually spread across North America {{and was the}} major crop of Native Americans {{at the time of}} European exploration. Other Mesoamerican crops include hundreds of varieties of locally domesticated squash and beans, while <b>cocoa,</b> also domesticated in the region, was a major crop. The turkey, {{one of the most important}} meat birds, was probably domesticated in Mexico or the U.S. Southwest.|$|E
5|$|In October 1915, {{landslides}} {{closed the}} Panama Canal and all American-Hawaiian ships, including Kentuckian, {{returned to the}} Straits of Magellan route again. Kentuckians exact movements from this time through early 1918 are unclear. She {{may have been in}} the half of the American-Hawaiian fleet that was chartered for transatlantic service. She may also have been in the group of American-Hawaiian ships chartered for service to South America, delivering coal, gasoline, and steel in exchange for coffee, nitrates, <b>cocoa,</b> rubber, and manganese ore.|$|E
5|$|Moderate {{rainfall}} {{resulted in}} river flooding along the St. Johns River, resulting in flooding along roads in Seminole County. Roadway, urban, and lowland flooding was also reported in Brevard and Orange counties. Roadway flooding was extensive in some areas, resulting in road closures in Oviedo, <b>Cocoa</b> Beach, and Cape Canaveral. Heavy rainfall in Pinellas Park caused heavy street flooding along an intersection on U.S. Highway 19. No casualties were reported, and damage was minor.|$|E
5|$|Prisoners ate {{meals in}} their cells, {{from the early}} years of the prison through to its closure in 1991. Bread from the prison bakehouse was {{included}} in every meal in the convict era. It was served with black tea for breakfast, and with either tea or <b>cocoa</b> in the evening. The main meal, called dinner, was in the middle of the day, and also featured soup, meat, and vegetables.|$|E
5|$|Several {{negative}} effects {{may be attributed}} to the drinking of hot chocolate. The types and severity of health risks vary between different styles of hot chocolate. Hot chocolate made from milk also contains the sugars naturally found in milk. Processed <b>cocoa</b> powder usually contains additional sugars. Some brands also contain hydrogenated oils and fats, the most common of which are coconut derivatives.|$|E
5|$|The {{balance of}} Iowans {{activities}} {{over the next}} two years are unclear. She may have been in the half of the American-Hawaiian fleet that was chartered for transatlantic service. She may also have been in the group of American-Hawaiian ships chartered for service to South America, delivering coal, gasoline, and steel in exchange for coffee, nitrates, <b>cocoa,</b> rubber, and manganese ore.|$|E
5|$|The first {{chocolate}} beverage {{is believed}} to have been created by the Mayans around 2,500-3,000 years ago, and a <b>cocoa</b> beverage was an essential part of Aztec culture by 1400 AD, by which they referred to as xocōlātl. The beverage became popular in Europe after being introduced from Mexico in the New World and has undergone multiple changes since then. Until the 19th century, hot chocolate was even used medicinally to treat ailments such as liver and stomach diseases.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Tammy {{surprised}} forecasters when {{it formed}} on October 5. Because {{they had not}} expected the disturbance to develop, warnings were not issued until about 12hours before the storm made landfall. Despite the short warning, tourists and business travelers cancelled flights as the storm neared landfall. Upon the storm developing, a tropical storm warning was immediately issued for the coast from <b>Cocoa</b> Beach, Florida to the Santee River, South Carolina.|$|E
