50|$|<b>Clortermine</b> (Voranil) was {{developed}} by Ciba in the 1960s and is an anorectic drug of the amphetamine class. It is the 2-chloro analogue of the better known appetite suppressant phentermine, and is the 2-chloro positional isomer of chlorphentermine. <b>Clortermine</b> produces very low rates of self-administration in animals similarly to chlorphentermine, {{and as a result}} it likely does not act on dopamine. Instead, it may act as a serotonin and/or norepinephrine releasing agent.|$|E
40|$|Four pigeons {{were trained}} to discnminate {{injections}} of d-am-phetamine (AMPH; 2. 0 mg/kg i. m.) from saline with responding maintained under a fixed-ratio 30 schedule offood delivery. When drugs used therapeutioally as anoreccs were tested, they con-sistendy produced greater than 80 % of AMPH-appropnate re-sponding. The order of potency for substifuting for AMPH was: mazindol> AMPH = phenmetrazine = phentermine> chior-phentern*ie = phendimetrazine = dlethyipropion> <b>clortermine</b> = mefenorex. Other anorectics such as phenyipropanolamine (0. 3 - 30. 0 mg/kg) and fenfluramine (1. 0 -i 7. 0 mg/kg) only sub-stituted paralIy for AMPH whereas benzphetamine (1. 0 -i 00. 0 mg/kg) resufted primarily in saline-appropriate responding. Corn-pounds related to AMPH in biochemical mechanism of action or psychomotor stimulant activity also were tested. Methyipheni-date (0. 1 - 3. 0 mg/kg), piribedil (0. 3 -i 7. 0 mg/kg) and nisoxetine (0. 03 - 1. 0 mg/kg) shared discriminative stimulus properties with AMPH whereas bupropion (1. 0 - 30. 0 mg/kg) and propyihexed-nne (1 0. 0 - 1 00. 0 mg/kg) substituted for AMPH in two of three pigeons tested. In contrast, caffeine and fenetylline resulted prindpally in saline-appropriate responding. Compounds from pharmacological classes not related to AMPH, such as morphine, diazepam and phencydildine, failed to substitute for AMPH. In general, compounds with anorectic and/or stimulant properties shared discriminative stimulus properties with AMPH. The DS properties of psychomotor stimulants have been studied extensively in several species, including pigeons (de l...|$|E
