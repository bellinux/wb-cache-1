Therefore, the basic instrumental requirements for TGA are a precision balance with a pan loaded with the sample, and a programmable furnace. The furnace can be programmed either for a constant heating rate, or for heating to acquire a <b>constant</b> <b>mass</b> <b>loss</b> with time. Though a constant heating rate is more common, a <b>constant</b> <b>mass</b> <b>loss</b> rate can illuminate specific reaction kinetics. For example, the kinetic parameters of the carbonization of polyvinyl butyral were found using a <b>constant</b> <b>mass</b> <b>loss</b> rate of 0.2 wt %/min. [...] Regardless of the furnace programming, the sample is placed in a small, electrically heated furnace equipped with a thermocouple to monitor accurate measurements of the temperature by comparing its voltage output with that of the voltage-versus-temperature table stored in the computer’s memory. A reference sample may be placed on another balance in a separate chamber. The atmosphere in the sample chamber may be purged with an inert gas to prevent oxidation or other undesired reactions. A different process using a quartz crystal microbalance has been devised for measuring smaller samples on the order of a microgram (versus milligram with conventional TGA).|$|E

40|$|Discoveries of exoplanets {{orbiting}} evolved stars motivate critical {{examinations of}} the dynamics of $N$-body systems with <b>mass</b> <b>loss.</b> Multi-planet evolved systems are particularly complex because of the mutual interactions between the planets. Here, we study the underlying dynamical mechanisms which can incite planetary escape in two-planet post-main sequence systems. Stellar <b>mass</b> <b>loss</b> alone is unlikely to be rapid and high enough to eject planets at typically-observed separations. However, the combination of <b>mass</b> <b>loss</b> and planet-planet interactions can prompt a shift from stable to chaotic regions of phase space. Consequently, when <b>mass</b> <b>loss</b> ceases, the unstable configuration may cause escape. By assuming a <b>constant</b> stellar <b>mass</b> <b>loss</b> rate, we utilize maps of dynamical stability to illustrate the distribution of regular and chaotic trajectories in phase space. We show that chaos can drive the planets to undergo close encounters, leading to the ejection of one planet. Stellar <b>mass</b> <b>loss</b> can trigger the transition of a planetary system from a stable to chaotic configuration, subsequently causing escape. We find that <b>mass</b> <b>loss</b> non-adiabatically affects planet-planet interaction for the most massive progenitor stars which avoid the supernova stage.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{analytic}} {{model for the}} interaction between planetary atmospheres and stellar winds from main sequence M stars, {{with the purpose of}} obtaining a quick test-model that estimates the timescale for total atmospheric <b>mass</b> <b>loss</b> due to this interaction. Planets in the habitable zone of M dwarfs may be tidally locked and may have weak magnetic fields, because of this we consider the extreme case of planets with no magnetic field. The model gives the planetary atmosphere <b>mass</b> <b>loss</b> rate {{as a function of the}} stellar wind and planetary properties (mass, atmospheric pressure and orbital distance) and an entrainment efficiency coefficient α. We use a mixing layer model to explore two different cases: a time-independent stellar <b>mass</b> <b>loss</b> and a stellar <b>mass</b> <b>loss</b> rate that decreases with time. For both cases we consider planetary masses within the range of 1 → 10 M_⊕ and atmospheric pressures with values of 1, 5 and 10 atm. For the time dependent case, planets without magnetic field in the habitable zone of M dwarfs with initial stellar <b>mass</b> <b>losses</b> of ≤Ṁ_w < 10 ^- 11 M_ yr^- 1, may retain their atmospheres for at least 1 Gyr. This case may be applied to early spectral type M dwarfs (earlier than M 5). Studies have shown that late type M dwarfs (later than M 5) may be active for long periods of time (≥ 4 Gyr), and because of that our model with <b>constant</b> stellar <b>mass</b> <b>loss</b> rate may be more accurate. For these stars most planets may have lost their atmospheres in 1 Gyr or less because most of the late type M dwarfs are expected to be active. We emphasize that our model only considers planets without magnetic fields. Clearly we must expect a higher resistance to atmospheric erosion if we include the presence of a magnetic field.

We aim to understand the properties of stellar winds in the fast magnetic rotator regime {{and the effects of}} magneto-centrifugal forces on wind speeds and <b>mass</b> <b>loss</b> rates. Methods: We extend a solar wind model to 1 D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the winds of rotating stars. We test two assumptions for how to scale the wind temperature to other stars and assume the <b>mass</b> <b>loss</b> rate scales as Ṁ_∝ R_^ 2 Ω_^ 1. 33 M_^- 3. 36, in the unsaturated regime. Results: For 1. 0 M_ stars, the winds can be accelerated to several thousand km s^- 1, and the effects of magneto-centrifugal forces are much weaker for lower mass stars. We find that the different assumptions for how to scale the wind temperature to other stars lead to significantly different <b>mass</b> <b>loss</b> rates for the rapid rotators. If we assume a <b>constant</b> temperature, the <b>mass</b> <b>loss</b> rates of solar mass stars do not saturate at rapid rotation, which we show to be inconsistent with observed rotational evolution. If we assume the wind temperatures scale positively with rotation, the <b>mass</b> <b>loss</b> rates are only influenced significantly at rotation rates above ∼ 75 Ω_. We suggest that models with increasing wind speed for more rapid rotators are preferable to those that assume a constant wind speed.

40|$|A {{large number}} of massive stars are known to rotate, {{resulting}} in significant distortion and variation in surface temperature from the pole to the equator. Radiatively driven <b>mass</b> <b>loss</b> is temperature dependent, so rapid rotation produces variation in <b>mass</b> <b>loss</b> and angular momentum loss rates {{across the surface of}} the star, which is expected to affect the evolution of rapidly rotating massive stars. In this work, we investigate the two dimensional effects of rotation on radiatively driven <b>mass</b> <b>loss</b> and the associated loss of angular momentum in ZAMS models with solar metallicity. Using 2 D stellar models, which give the variation in surface parameters as a function of co-latitude, we implement two different <b>mass</b> <b>loss</b> prescriptions describing radiatively driven <b>mass</b> <b>loss.</b> We find a significant variation in <b>mass</b> <b>loss</b> rates and angular momentum loss as a function of co-latitude. We find that the <b>mass</b> <b>loss</b> rate decreases as the rotation rate increases for models at <b>constant</b> initial <b>mass,</b> and derive scaling relations based on these models. When comparing 2 D to 1 D <b>mass</b> <b>loss</b> rates, we find that although the total angle integrated <b>mass</b> <b>loss</b> does not differ significantly, the 2 D models predict less <b>mass</b> <b>loss</b> from the equator and more <b>mass</b> <b>loss</b> from the pole than the 1 D predictions using von Zeipel's law.

In the passive domain the passive film thickness stabilizes within 200 to 400 s after an initial fast growth. The in-crease in current at the onset of the transpassive domain does not affect the passive dissolution rate. Only at higher potential dissolution rate increases due to the dissolution of Cr(VI), Co(III) and Mo(VI) species. The observed <b>constant</b> <b>mass</b> <b>loss</b> rate at transpassive po-tentials indicates that the passive film at these potentials is cracked or porous. Increasing temperature accelerates the mass loss through the oxide/electrolyte interface enhancing the passive and transpassive dissolution and increasing the thickness of the oxide film...|$|E
40|$|Mass loss on the {{horizontal}} branch has been invoked {{in the literature}} to explain such phenomena as the color (mass) dispersion of {{the horizontal}} branch and the observed distribution of period changes in RR Lyrae stars. To test these claims, the Yale stellar evolution code was used to evolve horizontal branch models of masses 0. 64, 0. 66, 0. 68, 0. 70, and 0. 72 solar mass with Z of 0. 001, core mass of 0. 4893, main-sequence helium abundance of 0. 23, and <b>constant</b> <b>mass</b> <b>loss</b> rates of 0, 10 (exp - 10), 5 x 10 (exp - 10), and 10 (exp - 9) solar mass/yr. Mass loss was assumed to occur only in the instability strip, where a mechanism {{is most likely to}} exist. Synthetic horizontal branches, constructed from the models, show that mass loss on the horizontal branch cannot produce the observed color dispersion even for the highest mass-loss rate of 10 (exp - 9) solar mass/yr. Mass loss is unlikely to occur at a higher rate without significant effects on the horizontal branch morphology, which would destroy the good agreement between standard synthetic models without mass loss and observed horizontal branches. Periods and period changes were calculated for all models. The period changes are not significantly larger for models with mass loss. The effect of mass loss in clusters of other metallicities is discussed...|$|E
40|$|We {{show that}} <b>mass</b> <b>loss</b> on the AGB {{is not a}} {{continuous}} process. Episodes of low <b>mass</b> <b>loss</b> rate, already known for carbon stars, are found to occur in oxygen-rich stars as well, suggesting that they constitute a general phenomenon. We propose that the <b>mass</b> <b>loss</b> depends on the phase of the thermal pulse cycle. A plausible physical mechanism indicates that <b>mass</b> <b>loss</b> peaks during a thermal pulse, and slows down or is interrupted during the interpulse phase. Episodes of low <b>mass</b> <b>loss</b> may coincide with decrease or cessation of variability...|$|R
30|$|From Table  4, it {{was obvious}} that <b>mass</b> <b>loss</b> {{increased}} with the increase of number of cycles during abrasion. Again, it was noticed that the amount of <b>mass</b> <b>loss</b> was decreased with the increase of concentration of PK cellulase. As for example, under 1000 cycles of abrasion testing, the <b>mass</b> <b>loss</b> of the bleached sample was found to be 1.90  mg while the maximum <b>mass</b> <b>loss</b> was found to be 1.50  mg in sample no. 1, and this gradually reduced to a minimum <b>mass</b> <b>loss</b> of 1.06  mg with the increase of concentration, time, and temperature. Only in cases of sample nos. 4 and 5 <b>mass</b> <b>loss</b> was found to be equal, i.e., 1.43  mg.|$|R
40|$|We {{calculate}} the <b>mass</b> <b>loss</b> driven by MHD waves from hot Jupiters by using MHD simulations in one-dimensional flux tubes. If a gaseous planet has magnetic field, MHD waves are excited by turbulence at the surface, dissipate {{at the upper}} atmosphere, and drive gas outflows. Our calculation shows that <b>mass</b> <b>loss</b> rates are comparable to the observed <b>mass</b> <b>loss</b> rates of hot Jupiters, therefore {{it is suggested that}} gas flow driven by MHD waves can {{plays an important role in}} the <b>mass</b> <b>loss</b> from gaseous planets. The <b>mass</b> <b>loss</b> rate varies dramatically with radius and mass of a planet: a gaseous planet with a small mass but with inflated radius produces very large <b>mass</b> <b>loss</b> rate. We also derive an analytical expression for the dependence of <b>mass</b> <b>loss</b> rate on planet radius and mass that is in good agreement with the numerical calculation. The <b>mass</b> <b>loss</b> rate also depends on the amplitude of velocity dispersion at the surface of a planet. Thus we expect to infer the condition of the surface and the internal structure of a gaseous planet from future observations of <b>mass</b> <b>loss</b> rate from various exoplanets.
