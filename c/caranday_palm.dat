50|$|Trithrinax campestris or <b>caranday</b> <b>palm</b> is a South American arecaceae palm {{native of}} Uruguayan and northeastern Argentine sabanas, where it shares its habitat with Copernicia alba among others and extends {{also to the}} summits of {{mountain}} ranges of Sierras de Córdoba and Sierras de San Luis. It is a very rustic palm that grows in arid, well drained, rocky soils. Its distinctive features are its compact shape, short green to grayish foliage, and trunk fully hidden by dry dead branches (coat) remaining from several previous seasons.|$|E

5000|$|Copernicia alba is a South American {{species of}} palm tree, which {{is found in}} the humid part of the Gran Chaco {{ecoregion}} in Bolivia, Paraguay, Colombia, Brazil (in the states of Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul) and Argentina (especially the province of Formosa, and less abundantly towards drier areas). They often, but not always, form dense single-species woodlands. Its common names in Spanish show the various colours (and technical qualities) that its wood and/or bark takes according to its environment: palma blanca, palma negra, palma colorada ("white", [...] "black", and [...] "red" [...] palm, respectively). In Guaraní, it is called caranday, [...] "water palm". Its English trade name is wax <b>palm</b> or <b>caranday</b> wax <b>palm</b> (it belongs to the same genus as the Carnauba wax palm).|$|R
