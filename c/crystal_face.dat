2500|$|The first {{recorded}} He diffraction experiment {{was completed in}} 1930 by Estermann and Stern [...] on the (100) <b>crystal</b> <b>face</b> of lithium fluoride. [...] This experimentally established the feasibility of atom diffraction when the de Broglie wavelength, λ, of the impinging atoms is {{on the order of}} the interatomic spacing of the material. [...] At the time, the major limit to the experimental resolution of this method was due to the large velocity spread of the helium beam. [...] It wasn't until the development of high pressure nozzle sources capable of producing intense and strongly monochromatic beams in the 1970s that HAS gained popularity for probing surface structure. [...] Interest in studying the collision of rarefied gases with solid surfaces was helped by a connection with aeronautics and space problems of the time. [...] Plenty of studies showing the fine structures in the diffraction pattern of materials using helium atom scattering were published in the 1970s. [...] However, it wasn't until a third generation of nozzle beam sources was developed, around 1980, that studies of surface phonons could be made by helium atom scattering. [...] These nozzle beam sources were capable of producing helium atom beams with an energy resolution of less than 1meV, making it possible to explicitly resolve the very small energy changes resulting from the inelastic collision of a helium atom with the vibrational modes of a solid surface, so HAS could now be used to probe lattice dynamics. [...] The first measurement of such a surface phonon dispersion curve was reported in 1981 , leading to a renewed interest in helium atom scattering applications, particularly for the study of surface dynamics.|$|E

40|$|Frozen water {{droplets}} 20 - 80 um in diameter were dropped into supercooled clouds produced {{in a large}} cloud chamber 6. 5 m high. They were collected {{at the bottom of}} the chamber. They grew to various shapes from spherical frozen particles to hexagonal ice crystals. By observing their shapes, it was possible to estimate the growth process of frozen droplets. A typical case accompanied with the appearance of 20 <b>crystal</b> <b>faces,</b> was observed. They were two basal, six prism and twelve pyramidal faces. In addition to these <b>crystal</b> <b>faces,</b> small (1120) <b>crystal</b> <b>faces</b> were observed between two prism faces in a few cases.

60|$|Oft {{have you}} seen a swan superbly frowning, And with proud breast his own white shadow crowning; He slants his neck beneath the waters bright So silently, it seems {{a beam of light}} Come from the galaxy: anon he sports,-- With {{outspread}} wings the Naiad Zephyr courts, Or ruffles all the surface of the lake In striving from its <b>crystal</b> <b>face</b> to take Some diamond water drops, and them to treasure In milky nest, and sip them off at leisure. But not a moment can he there insure them, Nor to such downy rest can he allure them; For down they rush as though they would be free, And drop like hours into eternity. Just like that bird am I in loss of time, Whene'er I venture on the stream of rhyme; With shatter'd boat, oar snapt, and canvass rent, I slowly sail, scarce knowing my intent; Still scooping up the water with my fingers, In which a trembling diamond never lingers.|$|E
60|$|Caroline wore {{continually}} {{round her}} neck a slender braid of silk, attached to which was some trinket. Mrs. Pryor {{had seen the}} bit of gold glisten, but had not yet obtained a fair view of it. Her patient never parted with it. When dressed it was hidden in her bosom; as she lay in bed she always held it in her hand. That Tuesday afternoon the transient doze--more like lethargy than sleep--which sometimes abridged the long days, had stolen over her. The weather was hot. While turning in febrile restlessness, she had pushed the coverlets a little aside. Mrs. Pryor bent to replace them. The small, wasted hand, lying nerveless on the sick girl's breast, clasped as usual her jealously-guarded treasure. Those fingers whose attenuation it gave pain to see were now relaxed in sleep. Mrs. Pryor gently disengaged the braid, drawing out a tiny locket--a slight thing it was, such as it suited her small purse to purchase.

40|$|Shape-controlled rutile titanium(IV) oxide (TiO 2) {{nanorods}} {{with various}} aspect ratios were prepared by two-step synthesis {{in the presence}} of two kinds of inorganic anions. The first synthesis step from titanium(III) chloride solution induced the formation of aggregated needlelike rutile TiO 2, the shape of which largely depended on the inorganic anion used. Moreover, shape-controlled rutile TiO 2 rods with { 110 } side <b>crystal</b> <b>faces</b> and { 111 } and/or { 001 } edge <b>crystal</b> <b>faces</b> were obtained by hydrothermal treatment of the needlelike rutile TiO 2.

40|$|Hydrates in some {{crude oils}} have a smaller {{tendency}} to form plugs than in others, and lately this {{is becoming a}} focus of research. To study this and the action of hydrate antiagglomerants in general, hydrate surface properties must be known. To help in characterizing the surface properties by simulation, the capillary waves of clathrate hydrate surfaces in vacuum is examined in all unique <b>crystal</b> <b>faces</b> by Molecular Dynamics, and an attempt is made to estimate the surface energies in the respective <b>crystal</b> <b>faces</b> from the wave fluctuations [1]. We also attempt to estimate solid/liquid surface energies of hydrate/oil and hydrate/water for a specific face, for comparison. The forcefield OPLS_AA {{is used for the}} organic compounds, while TIP 4 P/ice is used for the water framework. The anisotropy of the surface energy is then estimated and the result compared to the initial growth rate of different <b>crystal</b> <b>faces</b> as found in experiment. [2...|$|R

40|$|Charging {{is a basic}} {{property}} of the solid/solution interface of minerals. The charging at different <b>crystal</b> <b>faces</b> depends on the surface chemical composition, that is, the type and number of proton-reactive surface groups. Atomic force microscopy has provided direct information on the pH-dependent charging properties of individual <b>crystal</b> <b>faces</b> (Eggleston and Jordan, Geochim, Cosmochim. Acta, 1998) of hematite (001 face) and quartz (101 face). This promising scanning force technique may enable the testing of structure-reactivity relations as applied in the MUlti SIte Complexation model (MUSIC). The published pH-dependent variation of the interaction forces has been evaluated. The large experimental difference in the pH dependence of the interaction force is {{in accord with the}} expected proton affinity behavior of both <b>crystal</b> <b>faces,</b> as predicted with the MUSIC model. The reactivity of the 001 face of hematite is quite exceptional, because the surface groups only charge at extremely high or low pH values in contrast to the generally observed (overall) charging behavior of hematite. The difference in reactivity of the <b>crystal</b> <b>faces</b> of hematite has implication for the rate of aggregation. The presence of the 001 face leads to a less pH-dependent rate of aggregation below the point of zero charge, in accord with experimental observations (Schudel et al., J. Colloid Interface Sci., 1997). Model analysis further shows that the interaction forces acting on the 001 faces of hematite are sensitive to the presence of surface defects, in contrast to the forces acting on the 101 faces of quartz...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{was focused on}} the utilization of pyroelectric crystals for generation of radiation. When in constant temperature pyroelectric crystals are spontaneously polarized.

When a pyroelectric crystal is heated or cooled it becomes depolarized and the surface charges become available.
