The thin-walled structures {{with this kind of}} materials would exhibit large displacement response under high-level acoustic loads. Usually, the external heating is non-uniform. In the paper, a finite element model for analyzing nonlinear random dynamic behaviors of Carbon-Carbon composite panels with temperature gradients under Guassian sound excitation is founded. The total system response is decomposed into the time-independent component and the time-dependent component, using the equivalent linearization technique. Numerical results include root mean square (RMS) values of maximum deflections, time histories and power spectrum densities (PSD) of the deflection response. The results obtained in this paper can contribute to the thorough understanding of thermo-acoustic response of composite thin-walled structures...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The Carbon-Carbon(C-C) {{composite}} materials are logical {{candidates for the}} manufacture of space crafts and other advanced structures, due to their low density values. These materials are naturally expensive, and the machining cost increases the final product’s price.

40|$|Carbon-carbon {{composites}} are {{an attractive}} choice for fusion reactor plasma facing components {{because of their}} low atomic number, superior thermal shock resistance, and low neutron activation. Next generation tokamak reactors such as the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER), will require high thermal conductivity carbon-carbon composites and other materials, such as beryllium, to protect their plasma facing components from the anticipated high heat fluxes. Moreover, ignition machines such as ITER will produce a large neutron flux. Consequently, the influence of neutron damage on the structure and properties of carbon-carbon composite materials must be evaluated. Data from two irradiation experiments are reported and discussed here. Carbon-carbon composite materials were irradiated in target capsules in the High Flux Isotope Reactor (HAIR) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORAL).

40|$|Currently, the {{composite}} materials (CM) {{are widely used}} in the aerospace technology and mechanical engineering where the key parameters characterizing structural components and articles are related to their weight characteristics {{as well as their}} performance under high temperatures. For the experimental investigation of composite-based threaded items, the rod-based 3 Dreinforced <b>carbon-carbon</b> <b>composite</b> <b>material</b> (CCCM) was chosen. The subject of the research was the metric thread. The test samples were cut of the aforesaid material along one of the reinforcement direction. The following thread sizes were analyzed: М 24 × 1. 5; М 24 × 2; М 24 × 3. Dependence of the thread strength on the number of thread turns was determined within the range of 1 to 10 thread turns for М 24 × 2 thread size. The remaining test samples were used to obtain the relationship between the thread load bearing capacity and the thread pitch. The obtained dependence of the thread load bearing capacity on the number of thread turns showed the following: a) An increment in the thread load bearing capacity decreases with increasing number of thread turns. However, this effect is less pronounced than that observed for the metal ‘screw/nut’ pair. b) With the CCCM material under study, it proved to be impossible to test configurations having only 1 or 2 thread turns. c) The wide confidence range (CR) of the failure load {{can be explained by the}} fact that the material under study features an apparent structural heterogeneity, with a different probability of hitting a unit cell of the matrix and filler of the material. Nevertheless, the confidence range is stable, thus indicating indirectly the possibility of using this test method for further study of composite-based threaded items. There is an explicit correlation between the thread load bearing capacity and the thread pitch. Increase in the thread strength with increasing thread pitch depends on the relationship between the pitch size and the characteristic size of the unit cell of the material. The test research has shown that it is possible to make CCCM-based screw joints designed for operation under high temperatures as an alternative for metal screw joints, provided that the key parameters such as the thread profile, pitch, diameter and the number of thread turns are properly chosen. </p...|$|E

40|$|It {{is known}} that a newly formed glass {{container}} will only possess a very small fraction of its theoretical strength. This suggests that damage occurs {{on the surface of}} the glass melt during the forming process due to glass to mould contact and hot glass handling. It might be expected that any damage inflicted on the surface of a glass article during manufacture would heal at the elevated manufacturing temperatures used, however this does not appear to be true. Therefore, the actual mechanism by which glass strength is reduced during forming needs to be fully understood and the work presented in this thesis addresses this problem. Experiments, therefore, have been carried out here which simulate the formation of glass articles using an experimental pressing rig by systematically altering processing parameters such as the mould material, surface fmish of the mould, pressing temperature and atmosphere. Processing parameters that are used industrially for the formation of glass containers were generally reproduced wherever possible in order to investigate the glass-to-mould interaction. The interaction of both a cast iron mould <b>material</b> and <b>carbon-carbon</b> <b>composite</b> <b>materials</b> with a soda-lime-silica glass were examined using the techniques of scanning electron microscopy, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy in order to determine the type and extent of surface damage formed. The surfaces of the pressed glass samples made were found to contain defects of embedded particles and indented dimples. The embedded particles found were usually due to bulk material transfer from the plunger material used. The texture found {{on the surface of the}} pressed glass samples was found to be directly affected by the surface fmish of the plunger. Pressing glass samples using a cast iron plunger at an initial plunger temperature below 450 °C resulted in a randomly rippled 'chilled' surface. As the initial temperature of the plunger was increased, the surface texture of the pressed glass became a closer replica of the plunger surface. The use of vacuum assistance to form the glass samples also resulted in the surface of the pressed glass becoming a closer replica of the original plunger surface, even at lower pressing temperatures. The surfaces of the cast iron and <b>carbon-carbon</b> <b>composite</b> plungers appeared to have been affected by the initial plunger temperatures used.

The thin-walled structures {{with this kind of}} materials would exhibit large displacement response under high-level acoustic loads and possibly display buckling at elevated temperatures. Reliable experimental data are difficult to acquire because of the high costs and difficulties with instrumentation at high acoustic intensity and elevated temperatures. Thus, in the design process greater emphasis will likely be placed on improved mathematical and computational prediction methods.

Consequently, an informal partnership between government and industrial personnel called the Carbon-Carbon Spacecraft Radiator Partnership (CSRP) was created to foster <b>carbon-carbon</b> <b>composite</b> use for thermally and structurally demanding space radiator applications. The first CSRP flight opportunity is on the New Millennium Program (NMP) Earth Orbiter- 1 (EO- 1) spacecraft, scheduled for launch in late 1999.

Therefore some oxidation protection mechanism is mandatory to make these materials available for high temperature applications. It is the purpose of the current research to develop a viable high temperature oxidation protection system for <b>carbon-carbon</b> <b>composites.</b> It has been shown that such a coating system must have at least two layers; a gradient porous SiC layer aimed to redistribute the stress produced due to CTE (coefficient of thermal expansion) mismatch and a dense top layer of a suitable material meant to protect <b>carbon-carbon</b> <b>composite</b> substrate from oxidation. Materials for the top layer experimented during the current research were SiC, ShN 4 and HfC. Pack cementation technique was used to develop the gradient SiC layer while top dense layers were deposited by using the reactive sputtering technique. To improve the oxidation protection and crack resistance of the top dense coating multilayering approach was adopted. During the current research basically four different coating systems were produced, characterized and then tested at high temperature for their oxidation performance. These coating systems were, gradient SiC layer plus dense sputtered SiC layer, gradient SiC layer plus dense sputtered ShN 4 layer, gradient SiC layer plus dense sputtered SiC/ShN 4 layers, gradient SiC layer plus dense sputtered SiClHfC layers. Oxidation testing of these coatings in atmosphere showed that these coatings are thermodynamically stable at all test temperatures studied (1300 - 1575 °C), except coatings with a ShN 4 layer.

First, stress, strain, and energy data were calculated by the finite element method for square plates with a 10 percent difference in the material properties between specified segments, i. e., between the center and the outside section or between two halves of the plate. Th{{is demonstrated}} the efficiency of the method in predicting variations in the structural behavior based on small material property differences. Then, finite element analyses and actual axial compression tests were performed on a Space Shuttle brake stator made from woven <b>carbon-carbon</b> <b>composites.</b> The <b>material</b> properties used in the numerical modeling of the stator were previously characterized at a large number of points on the component by quantitative NDE-procedures, i. e., ultrasonics and radiography. The results from the experimental compressive loading tests were used to verify the NDE/FEM results. Good agreement was found for most parameters...|$|R
40|$|TITLE: CARBON-CARBON COMPOSITES MAJOR PROFESSOR: Dr. Jarlen Don <b>Carbon-Carbon</b> (C-C) <b>composites,</b> are <b>materials</b> {{that offer}} {{designers}} a significant importance over conventional materials for advanced applications. The <b>Carbon-Carbon</b> (C-C) <b>composites</b> were originally developed {{to be used}} in aerospace and defense applications, because of their unique properties. Currently, they are employed in many applications. They exhibit light weight, high thermal efficiency, and excellent mechanical properties at higher temperatures, making them the right candidate materials for aircraft and racing car brakes and re-entry nose tips. Moreover, they demonstrate significant durability for friction and wear properties. Compared to advanced ceramics, <b>Carbon-Carbon</b> (C-C) <b>composites</b> have improved thermal and mechanical properties along with high friction coefficient and low wear [1 - 2]. Due to its remarkable properties, <b>carbon-carbon</b> <b>composites</b> display high dimensional stability at elevated temperatures greater than 3000 °C without major deformation, while other materials such as a wide range of metals experience drastic deterioration. The properties of <b>Carbon-Carbon</b> (C-C) <b>composites</b> are very much dependent on the manufacturing methods used for production. Although the general production technology is known, the combination of processes to achieve specifically tailored properties remains the expertise of particular manufacturers. This study represent a review of some major developments in <b>Carbon-Carbon</b> (C-C) <b>composites</b> including properties, major applications, and future potential [3]. Improving structural components and elements by various techniques such as matrix reinforcements along with decreasing of manufacturing costs make this family of materials more and more attractive to a variety of engineering applications, especially high performance applications...|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. The structural analysis of <b>carbon-carbon</b> (C-C) <b>composites</b> is a research area of increasing importance. As the use of the materials expands towards more demanding aerospace applications, it is of critical importance to understand the laminate mechanics specific to <b>carbon-carbon</b> <b>composite</b> laminates. Specifically, the materials of interest in this research are oxidation resistant <b>carbon-carbon</b> <b>composites.</b> These <b>material</b> systems include a protection scheme to prevent the catastrophic oxidation of the structure in oxygen rich environments in excess of 450 OC. A common protection scheme includes the use of external oxidation barrier coatings in conjunction with internal particulate oxidation inhibitors. The goal of this research is to gain an understanding of the influence of the oxidation of the inhibitor particles on the mechanical properties of the matrix material, as well as the thermomechanical performance of the laminate. This investigation encompasses two development phases. In the initial phase, the oxidation of the inhibitor particles and its effect on the temperature dependent material properties of the inhibited matrix material are analyzed. The temperature dependent matrix material properties developed are then used as model input in two dimensional representations of the through the-thickness region of a carbon-carbon laminate. Two different through-the-thickness representations are considered. The through-the-thickness models are subjected to a variety of longitudinal and transverse mechanical and thermomechanical loads. Results indicate that the assumed material transformation of the matrix material has little effect on the longitudinal or axial performance of the model. The material transformation, however, is shown to affect the transverse model response...|$|R
