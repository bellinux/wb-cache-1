25|$|Early in 2003, the SARS {{epidemic}} brought China to {{a virtual}} standstill. Most tuberculosis <b>control</b> <b>activities</b> {{came to a}} stop. However, after the SARS epidemic had been successfully controlled, tuberculosis <b>control</b> <b>activities</b> picked up rapidly {{in the second half}} of the year. By the end of 2003, 43% of the estimated total new cases of smear-positive tuberculosis had been diagnosed and treated in the country's DOTS program. With further acceleration of tuberculosis control efforts, 64% and 80% of these cases were diagnosed and treated in 2004 and 2005, respectively. The acceleration of efforts to control tuberculosis after the SARS epidemic would not have been possible if the government had not laid the foundation to revitalize the tuberculosis control program before 2003. However, the gains in tuberculosis control after SARS also resulted from measures to improve the public health system.|$|E

25|$|Changes {{in section}} 404 {{jurisdiction}} would diminish use of one tool {{used by many}} states to <b>control</b> <b>activities</b> affecting wetlands. In recent years, most states have used CWA section 401 water quality certification programs in addition to or in lieu of specific regulatory statutes. Section 401 requires that before a federal permit or license is issued, states must certify that the project complies with water quality standards. That authority effectively gives states a veto power on the federal permit {{or the ability to}} require conditions that become part of a permit. State water quality certification has been used by a number of states to <b>control</b> <b>activities</b> affecting wetlands without having to independently establish state permitting and enforcement programs. However, if federal jurisdiction does not exist and no section 404 or other federal permit is required, section 401 certification also is not required and so is not available as a tool for the state to evaluate the proposed activity.|$|E

25|$|For those {{patients}} with tuberculosis who eventually {{ended up in}} the public health system, the problems did not end there. Governmental funding for public health had also declined over the years. In 2002, only about 41% of funding for the country's Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) institutions came from the government. To make ends meet, local CDCs concentrated on the generation of revenue. There was little incentive to undertake tuberculosis <b>control</b> <b>activities,</b> which are labor-intensive and create little income. Even in areas where government subsidies support free diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis, many CDCs continue to charge patients for ancillary tests and drugs, some of which are of questionable benefit.|$|E

This paper develops a resource leveling algorithm based on the backward <b>controlling</b> <b>activity</b> in {{line of balance}}. The backward <b>controlling</b> <b>activity</b> is a kind of special activity, and if its duration is prolonged the project duration could be reduced. It brings two advantages to the resource leveling: both the resource allocated on the backward activity and the project duration are reduced. A resource leveling algorithm is presented which permits the number of crews of the backward <b>controlling</b> <b>activity</b> to be reduced until the terminal situation is reached, where the backward <b>controlling</b> <b>activity</b> does not exist or the number of crews cannot be reduced. That adjustment enables the productivity of all activities to be consistent. An illustrative pipeline project demonstrates the improvement in resource leveling. And this study designed a MATLAB program to execute the design algorithm. The proposed model could help practitioners to achieve the goals of both resource leveling and project duration reduction without increasing any resource...|$|R

40|$|Electrical and {{mechanical}} activities were recorded from the rectosigmoid of normal subjects using an intraluminal recording tube with {{two sets of}} bipolar electrodes and strain gauges. Four distinct types of electrical activities were recorded. (1) Electrical <b>control</b> <b>activity</b> (ECA). This activity varied in amplitude and frequency over time and the control waves were not phase-locked. The means of dominant frequency components in the lower and higher frequency ranges were 3. 86 +/- 0. 18 SD and 10. 41 +/- 0. 46 SD c/min, respectively. The overall dominant frequency component was mostly in the lower frequency range of 2. 0 - 9. 0 c/min. (2) Discrete electrical response activity (DERA). This activity appeared as short duration bursts (less than 10 s) of response potentials whose repetition rate was in the total colonic electrical <b>control</b> <b>activity</b> frequency range of 2. 0 - 13. 0 c/min. The mean duration of this activity was 2. 24 +/- 1. 30 SD s. (3) Continuous electrical response activity (CERA). This activity appeared as long duration bursts (greater than 10 s) of response potentials which were not related to electrical <b>control</b> <b>activity.</b> Its mean duration was 14. 78 +/- 3. 68 SD s. This activity generally did not propagate. (4) Contractile electrical complex (CEC).
