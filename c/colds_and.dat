40|$|The linear Vlasov {{dispersion}} relation for {{the lower}} hybrid density drift instability is studied in a four component (hot electrons <b>and</b> protons, <b>cold</b> electrons <b>and</b> protons) plasma. The introduction of a cold ion population monotonically reduces the maximum growth rate of the instability. Reduction of the ratio of temperatures of the <b>cold</b> <b>and</b> hot plasmas reduces both the real frequency and {{the growth rate of}} the instability. Near a ratio of the <b>cold</b> <b>and</b> hot plasma temperatures of 0. 01 a higher frequency branch of this instability emerges and for a fixed ratio of <b>cold</b> <b>and</b> hot electron density exhibits an increasing maximum growth rate as the ratio of the <b>cold</b> <b>and</b> hot plasma temperatures decreases further. The ratio of the <b>cold</b> <b>and</b> hot plasma temperatures for the ions is the crucial parameter and deserves detailed magnetospheric studies...|$|R

25|$|A healthy fancy mouse {{will live}} on average 18 to 30 months, {{depending}} on genetic predisposition. Like most mammals mice are susceptible to mites, ticks and other skin parasites, as well as intestinal parasites. The cage should be cleaned regularly, and preferably treated with anti-mite spray. Mice are particularly sensitive to drafts and may pick up <b>colds</b> <b>and</b> other flu-like conditions. Mice can also over-groom when stressed, leading to skin irritations and fur loss. Older mice are susceptible to tumors, especially breast cancer in females as the mammary tissue is distributed around much of the body. Persistent problems should be referred to a veterinarian, although finding a veterinarian with experience in treating mice can be difficult.|$|E

40|$|Background: Cassava, an {{important}} tropical crop, has remarkable drought tolerance, but is {{very sensitive to}} cold. The growth, development, and root productivity of cassava are all adversely affected under <b>cold</b> <b>and</b> drought. Methods: To profile the transcriptional response to <b>cold</b> <b>and</b> drought stresses, cassava seedlings were respectively subjected to 0, 6, 24, and 48 h of <b>cold</b> stress <b>and</b> 0, 4, 6, and 10 days of drought stress. Their folded leaves, fully extended leaves, and roots were respectively investigated using RNA-seq. Results: Many genes specifically and commonly responsive to <b>cold</b> <b>and</b> drought were revealed: genes related to basic cellular metabolism, tetrapyrrole synthesis, and brassinosteroid metabolism exclusively responded to cold; genes related to abiotic stress and ethylene metabolism exclusively responded to drought; and genes related to cell wall, photosynthesis, and carbohydrate metabolism, DNA synthesis/chromatic structure, abscisic acid and salicylic acid metabolism, and calcium signaling commonly responded to both <b>cold</b> <b>and</b> drought. Discussion: Combined with cold- and/or drought-responsive transcription factors, the regulatory networks responding to <b>cold</b> <b>and</b> drought in cassava were constructed. All these findings will improve {{our understanding of the}} specific and common responses to <b>cold</b> <b>and</b> drought in cassava, and shed light on genetic improvement of <b>cold</b> <b>and</b> drought tolerance in cassava...|$|R

[...] Moore's brigade arrived in January, but Moore {{spent most of his}} time traveling between Charleston and North Carolina, lobbying for funds and clothing for his poorly equipped soldiers, and recruiting more men. [...] He went so far as to obtain a private loan from Thomas Polk, a planter in Mecklenburg County, for $6,250 in South Carolina currency to pay for rations for his command. [...] Moore's unit engaged in daily drills under his supervision and that of Colonel Francis Nash. [...] Despite these efforts, the North Carolinians suffered from rampant <b>colds</b> <b>and</b> pneumonia, and many of the enlisted men deserted to join the South Carolina line because of the high bounty being offered by that state for service.|$|E
500|$|On {{the last}} few days on set, the {{conditions}} had become so poor that the crew began burning furniture to stay warm. Since only exterior shots needed to be filmed at that point, they burned nearly every piece of furniture left. Several actors went days without showering, and because of the freezing conditions, several caught <b>colds</b> <b>and</b> other illnesses. Campbell later described the filming process as nearly [...] "twelve weeks of mirthless exercise in agony", though he allowed that he did manage to have fun while on set. On January 23, 1980, filming was finished and almost every crew member left the set to return home, with Campbell staying with Raimi. While looking over the footage that had been shot, Raimi discovered that a few pick-ups were required to fill in missing shots. Four days of re-shoots were then done to complete the film. The final moment involved Campbell having [...] "monster-guts" [...] splattered on him in the basement.|$|E

500|$|Despite the {{operations}} on {{his throat and}} having taken the sea air at Cowes, Frederick remained hoarse, and was advised by Mackenzie to spend the coming winter on the Italian Riviera. In August, following reports {{that his father was}} gravely ill, he considered returning to Germany, but was dissuaded by his wife, and went to Toblach in South Tyrol with his family, where Victoria had rented a house. He arrived in Toblach on 7 September, exhausted and hoarse. Concerned by Frederick's lack of visible improvement after a brief meeting with Frederick in Munich, Philipp, Prince of Eulenburg consulted the distinguished laryngologist Max Joseph Oertel, who urged a drastic and thorough operation on Frederick's throat, and said he suspected a benign tumour which could soon become malignant. By this time, Mackenzie's treatment of Frederick was generating strong criticism. After a fortnight in Toblach, Mackenzie arrived to reexamine Frederick, who had continued to suffer from <b>colds</b> <b>and</b> hoarseness; in public, however, the doctor remained largely unconcerned, and attributed the hoarseness to a [...] "momentary chill." [...] However, he recommended that Frederick should leave Toblach for Venice, to be followed by Victoria. The weather soon turned cold, and Frederick's throat caused him pain, for which he received cocaine injections.|$|E
500|$|Both A.auricula-judae and {{the similar}} A.polytricha are popular in China, where the {{medicinal}} use of food is common; a soup containing {{the species is}} used medicinally for dealing with <b>colds</b> <b>and</b> fevers by reducing {{the heat of the}} body. There is evidence that the species were being cultivated in China as early as the Tang dynasty (618–907). Li Shizhen, in his Pen Tsao Kang Mu, quotes Tang Ying-chuan from that period as saying [...] "... put the steamed bran on logs, cover with straw, Wood Ear will grow". In the early 20th century, large volumes of A.auricula-judae were exported from Australia to China, and it is today still sold in Asian food shops for culinary use. It is also popular in Vietnam, although the climate is there more suited to A.polytricha. A report on small-scale fungi cultivation concluded that A.auricula-judae would be suitable for cultivation only in cooler climates. According to a 2010 publication, the annual production of Auricularia species worldwide is the fourth highest among all industrially cultivated culinary and medicinal mushrooms, and in China, the estimated output was roughly 1.655 million tonnes (based on 2003 data), most of which are A.polytricha however (which has by and large replaced A.auricula-judae in international trade).|$|E
