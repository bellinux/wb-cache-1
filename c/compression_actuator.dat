Here {{we focus on}} one factor that has often been overlooked in previous studies of valveless pumping, namely the impact that a <b>compression</b> <b>actuator</b> exerts upon the pliant {{part of the system}} when they collide. In particular, a ﬂuid-ﬁlled closed-loop system is considered, which consists of two distensible reservoirs connected by two rigid tubes, with one of the reservoirs compressed by an actuator at a prescribed frequency. A lumped-parameter model with constant coefficients accounting for mass and momentum balance in the system is constructed. Based on such a model, a mean ﬂow in the ﬂuid loop can only be produced by system asymmetry and the nonlinear effects associated with actuator impact. Through asymptotic and numerical solutions of the model, a systematic parameter study is carried out, thereby revealing the rich and complex system dynamics that strongly depends upon the driving frequency of the actuator and other geometrical and material properties of the system. The driving frequency dependence of the mean ﬂowrate in the ﬂuid loop and that of the mean reservoir pressures also are examined for a number of representative cases...|$|E

Here {{we focus on}} one factor that has often been overlooked in previous studies of valveless pumping, namely the impact that a <b>compression</b> <b>actuator</b> exerts upon the pliant {{part of the system}} when they collide. In particular, a fluid-filled closed-loop system is considered, which consists of two distensible reservoirs connected by two rigid tubes, with one of the reservoirs compressed by an actuator at a prescribed frequency. A lumped-parameter model with constant coefficients accounting for mass and momentum balance in the system is constructed. Based upon such a model, a mean flow in the fluid loop can only be produced by system asymmetry and the nonlinear effects associated with actuator impact. Through asymptotic and numerical solutions of the model, a systematic parameter study is carried out, thereby revealing the rich and complex system dynamics that strongly depends upon the driving frequency of the actuator and other geometrical and material properties of the system. In particular, a number of critical frequencies that characterize the interactions between the actuator and the system are calculated asymptotically. Guided by such critical frequencies, the numerical results are categorized into different types of dynamical responses, and the parameter regions for their existence are systematically determined. Moreover, the transition of different system responses are observed through critical phase (which corresponding to the moment when different system responses occur) tracking...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{development}} of a lightweight hyper-redundant manipulator driven by embedded dielectric polymer actuators. This manipulator uses binary actuation and belongs to a class of digital mechanisms that are able to perform precise discrete motions without the need for sensing and feedback control. The system is built from an assembly of modular parallel stages and has potential to be miniaturized for applications ranging from biomedical devices to space system components. The polymer actuators can make such devices feasible. This paper presents the design of a modular polymer actuator that can work under both tension and <b>compression.</b> The <b>actuators</b> achieve improved performance by incorporating an elastic passive element to maintain uniform force-displacement characteristic and bi-stable action. A flexible frame also insures nearly optimal pre-strain required by dielectric film based actuators...|$|R

We specify the capacity, bandwidth and allowable time delay for a control valve {{that can be used}} to actively suppress surge in a specific full-scale centrifugal <b>compression</b> system. The <b>actuator</b> requirements are obtained from closed-loop simulations with a nonlinear simulation model of the compressor test rig. In order to meet the requirements, a new high-speed valve actuator had to be developed. We present the resulting actuator design and provide test results to illustrate that the control valve meets our design specifications...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{the present}} work, the FGM monomorph {{actuator}} {{was developed and}} applied in the impedance pump. The actuator was fabricated using electrophoretic deposition (EPD). Two starting materials, pure PZT and doped PZT, were mixed to form four different compositions. The actuator was then fabricated by sequential deposition of the four compositions layer by layer on the substrate and followed by sintering to full density. The actuator shows both piezoelectric property and microstructural gradient across the layers. The actuator is able to achieve a bending displacement of nearly 2 mm at resonant frequency. It has been successfully applied to the impedance pump as the actuating component. The pumping action comes from the periodic <b>compression</b> by the <b>actuator</b> to induce a net flow. Maximum flow was observed at the resonant frequency of the actuator. A flow rate of about 9 ml/min was generated...|$|R
40|$|In this report, we {{extend our}} {{previous}} work within MOU 372 on modeling and longitudinal speed control design for heavy commercial {{vehicles equipped with}} variable compression braking mechanisms. Previously, we developed a detailed crankangle based simulation model for a six cylinder, 350 hp diesel engine with a continuously varying compression brake {{that is capable of}} describing the intrinsic interactions between individual cylinder intake and exhaust processes, turbocharger dynamics during combustion and braking modes, and the transition between those modes. Moreover, for control design and analysis purposes we derived a low-order approximation of that model. In this report we present our new results on developing longitudinal control algorithms that coordinate the variable compression brake with conventional service brakes and gear selection. Specifically, we integrate the <b>compression</b> brake <b>actuator</b> with the service brakes and design a PI-controller that emulates the driver's actions on long grades. The controller uses the engine speed measurement to activate the service brakes only when retarding power of the compression brake is insufficient. We also employ robust linear control technique using the concept of structured singular values to design a controller that is robust to parameter variations and model uncertainty in the CHV. Finally, we compare the performance of this robust controller with the performance of an adaptive control scheme that we have derived within MOU 393. The performance of all the controllers is demonstrated through extensive simulations on the 24 th order nonlinear vehicle model developed in our previous work within MOU 372.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{deals with}} the {{development}} of a nonlinear control strategy for asymmetric actuators. In asymmetric actuators, the generated force/torque is not symmetric in push and pull. Examples of asymmetric actuators are thrusters, shape memory alloy wires, and in general, cables and long rods that cannot be used for <b>compression</b> forces. These <b>actuators</b> are called unidirectional. More complex asymmetric actuators are those that generate uneven push and pull forces. Examples of these actuators are double acting hydraulic and pneumatic cylinders in which the area of the piston is not the same in forward and reverse directions. Since in the existing control techniques the actuator is assumed to be symmetric, the application of asymmetric actuators requires new control schemes. In this paper, we propose a nonlinear control method capable of producing any biased input that can be used by asymmetric actuators. The controller is based on quadratic coupling terms with which positive, negative, and any biased input can be generated. We study the stability of the system along with a method to select the controller gains for tuning the output of the controller to match the actuator type. The normal form method and perturbation techniques are used to study the controller design...|$|R
40|$|Flow {{control is}} one of the main thrust areas of the Collaborative Center of Control Science (CCCS) at the Ohio State University. The primary {{objective}} of the flow control team at CCCS is to develop tools and methodologies for closed-loop flow control. The team possesses synergistic capabilities in all of the required multidisciplinary areas of flow simulation, low dimensional modeling, controller design, and experimental integration and implementation of the components along with actuators and sensors. The initial application chosen for study is closed-loop control of shallow cavity flows in subsonic Mach numbers. Shallow cavity flows have well known characteristics, are amenable to low dimensional modeling, possess known and localized receptivity, and are amenable to external forcing. Therefore, they are quite suited for closed-loop control technology development. The team has made significant progress in the development of various components necessary for low dimensional model based control strategy, which will be presented and discussed in this paper. The current experimental set up utilizes a titanium diaphragm <b>compression</b> driver for <b>actuator,</b> which is capable of forcing the flow up to about 10 kHz in the Mach number range of 0. 25 to 0. 5. While the low dimensional model based controller design is progressing steadily, a simple logic-based controller has been implemented, which can suppress the peak pressur...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the use of}} a new class of flight control actuators employing Post-Buckled Precompressed (PBP) piezoelectric elements in morphing wing Uninhabited Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The new actuator relies on axial compression to amplify deflections and control forces simultaneously. Two designs employing morphing wing panels based on PBP actuators were conceived. One design relied on a change in curvature of the actuators to control the camber of the airfoil. Axial <b>compression</b> of the <b>actuators</b> was ensured by means of rubber bands and increased end rotation levels with almost a factor of two up to +/- 13. 6 deg peak-to-peak, with excellent correlation between theory and experiment. Wind tunnel tests quantitatively proved that wing morphing induced roll acceleration levels in excess of 1500 deg/sˆ 2. A second design employed PBP actuators in a wing panel with significant thickness, relying on a highly compliant Latex skin to allow for shape deformation {{and at the same time}} induce an axial force on the actuators. Bench tests showed that due to the axial compression provided by the skin end rotations were increased with more than a factor of two up to +/- 15. 8 deg peak-to-peak up to a break frequency of 34 Hz. Compared to conventional electromechanical servoactuaters, the PBP actuators showed a net reduction in flight control system weight, slop and power consumption for minimal part count. Both morphing wing concepts showed that PBP piezoelectric actuators have significant benefits over conventional actuators and can be successfully applied to induce aircraft control.

40|$|The {{closed-loop}} dynamic {{behavior of}} post-buckled precompressed (PBP) piezoelectric elements is in-vestigated in this paper. PBP actuators {{have been shown}} to be capable of generating significantly larger deflections than traditional piezoelectric actuators, up to a factor of three, without compromising applied end force. Due to an axial force close to the perfect-column buckling load they have displayed reduced stability and even instability around zero deflection. Therefore, a closed-loop control system was created to stabilize the PBP actuator over its entire range of deflections. The dynamic response of this system was compared with the open-loop response of the PBP actuator and with the dynamic characteristics of a traditional elec-tromechanical servoactuator. It was found that a pure integrative (I) controller was able to stabilize the PBP actuator over its entire range of deflections. To maintain stability, the gains had to be decreased for higher axial loads, reducing the bandwidth of the system, but still outperforming a traditional servoactuator by 40 %. Furthermore, the influence of actuating an aerodynamic control surface was investigated by adding an inertial mass to one of the supporting axes of the PBP actuator. It was shown that a PBP actuator was capable of rotating these masses, although this slightly reduced the speed of the response.

40|$|Mechanical counter-pressure (MCP) space suits {{have the}} {{potential}} to greatly improve the mobility of astronauts as they conduct planetary exploration activities; however, the underlying technologies required to provide uniform compression in an MCP garment at sucient pressures (29. 6 kPa) for space exploration have not yet been demonstrated, and donning and dong of such a suit remains a signicant challenge. This research effort focuses on the novel use of active material technologies to produce a garment with controllable compression capabilities to address these problems. We the describe the modeling, development, and testing of low spring index (C = 3) nickel titanium (NiTi) shape memory alloy (SMA) coil actuators designed for use in wearable <b>compression</b> garments. Several <b>actuators</b> were manufactured, annealed, and tested to assess their de-twinning and activation characteristics. We then describe the derivation and development of a complete two-spring model to predict the performance of hybrid compression textiles combining passive elastic fabrics and integrated SMA coil actuators based on 11 design parameters. Design studies (including two specifically tailored for MCP applications) are presented using the derived model to demonstrate the range of possible garment performance outcomes based on strategically chosen SMA and material parameters. Finally, we present a novel methodology for producing modular 3 D-printed SMA actuator cartridges designed for use in compression garments, and test 5 active tourniquet prototypes (made using these cartridges and commercially available fabrics) to assess the eect of SMA actuation on the tourniquet compression characteristics. Our results demonstrate that hybrid active tourniquet prototypes are highly effective, with counter-pressures increasing by an average of 81. 9 % when activated (taking an average of only 23. 7 seconds to achieve steady state). Maximum average counter-pressures reached 34. 3 kPa, achieving 115. 9 % of the target MCP counter-pressure. We observed signicant spatial variability in the active counter-pressure profiles, stemming from high friction, asymmetric fabric stretching, and near-field pressure spikes/voids caused by the SMA cartridge. Modifications to reduce tourniquet friction were effective at mitigating a proportion of this variability. System performance and repeatability were found to depend heavily on the passive fabric characteristics, with performance losses attributable to irrecoverable fabric strain, degradation in fabric elastic modulus, and non-linear modulus behavior. The results of this research open the door to new opportunities to advance the field of MCP spacesuit design, as well as opportunities to improve compression garments used in healthcare therapies, competitive athletics, and battlefield medicine. by Bradley Thomas Holschuh.
