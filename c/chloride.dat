40|$|The {{presence}} of <b>chlorides</b> in concrete {{is a permanent}} subject of research because they cause corrosion of steel bars. <b>Chlorides</b> added to the concrete during preparation, as accelerators of the bonding of cement minerals process, enter into reaction with aluminates, creating a phase known as chloroaluminate hydrates. In everyday conditions the product of chemical bonding between <b>chlorides</b> and aluminates is usually monochloridealuminate C 3 A·CaCl 2 ·Hx, better known as Friedel's salt. In this paper, the influence of chemical bonding of <b>chlorides</b> with aluminates {{during the process of}} cement hydration on corrosion of steel bars in concrete was investigated. The process of <b>chlorides</b> bonding with aluminates yielding monochloride aluminate is monitored by XRD analyses. It was found that the amount of <b>chlorides</b> bonding with aluminates increases with an increase of temperature, and as a result, reduces the amount of 'free' <b>chlorides</b> in concrete. Potentiodynamic measurements have shown that increase in temperature of the heat treatment of working electrodes by <b>chlorides</b> leads to a reduction of steel bars corrosion as a result of either the increase of the monochloride-aluminate content or the decrease of free <b>chlorides</b> amount. <b>Chlorides</b> bound in chloroaluminate hydrates do not cause activation of steel bars corrosion in concrete. It was also proven that the increase of free <b>chlorides</b> concentration in the concrete leads to intensification of steel bars corrosion. This additionally approves that free <b>chlorides</b> are only the activators of process of steel bars corrosion in the concrete...|$|R
