5|$|Last of the Summer Wine {{focused on}} a trio of older men and their {{youthful}} antics. The original trio consisted of <b>Compo</b> Simmonite, Norman Clegg, and Cyril Blamire. Blamire left in 1976, when Michael Bates fell ill shortly before filming of the third series, requiring Clarke to hastily rewrite the series with a new third man. The third member of the trio would be recast four times {{over the next three}} decades: Foggy Dewhurst in 1976, Seymour Utterthwaite in 1986, Foggy again in 1990, and Truly Truelove in 1997. After <b>Compo</b> died in 1999, his son, Tom Simmonite, filled the gap for the rest of that series, and Billy Hardcastle joined the cast as the third lead character in 2001. The trio became a quartet between 2003 and 2006 when Alvin Smedley moved in next door to Nora Batty, but returned to the usual threesome in 2006 when Billy Hardcastle left the show. The role of supporting character Entwistle steadily grew until the beginning of the 30th series, when he and Alvin were recruited by Hobbo Hobdyke, a former milkman with ties to MI5, to form a new trio of volunteers who respond to any emergency.|$|E

This group was rounded out by characters at two locations frequented by the trio: John Comer and Jane Freeman as Sid and Ivy, the quarrelling husband-and-wife owners of the local café; and Blake Butler and Rosemary Martin as Mr Wainwright and Mrs Partridge, the librarians having a not-so-secret affair.

40|$|Os genes HLA (Antígenos leucocitários humanos) estão localizados no Complexo Principal de Histocompatibilidade humano (o MHC), e possuem os maiores níveis de variação do genoma, com milhares de alelos, altas taxas de heterozigose e diversidade nucleotídica. No presente estudo, nosso objetivo foi a identificação dos principais alvos da seleção natural nos genes HLA. Para isso, propusemos duas abordagens que resultaram na redação de dois manuscritos. Na primeira abordagem, nós testamos a hipótese de que os principais alvos da atuação da seleção natural nas moléculas HLA seriam os aminoácidos que <b>compões</b> os sítios que ancoram os peptídeos antigênicos (os bolsões B e F da região de ligação de peptídeos (PBR)). Para isso, utilizamos um conjunto de dados de 6. 435 e 6. 409 indivíduos genotipados para os genes HLA-A e -B respectivamente, gerados para o 13 º Workshop Internacional de Histocompatibilidade (IHW) e pertencentes a 55 populações espalhadas por todos os continentes. Nós estimamos a diversidade nucleotídica (&PI;) das sequências que codificam para os bolsões B e F e comparamos esses dados com os obtidos de outros bolsões da PBR. Concomitantemente, utilizamos a classificação de alelos dos locos HLA-A e -B em supertipos, que são agrupamentos alélicos com similaridades nos perfis de ligação de peptídeos, devido a semelhanças em aminoácidos específicos dos bolsões B e F. Nós descrevemos os padrões observados de variação dos supertipos e desenvolvemos um teste de hipótese onde comparamos os estimadores observados de diferenciação populacional (Gst) e diversidade genética (taxa de heterozigose (He) e número de alelos (k)) com os obtidos a partir de 10. 000 réplicas constituídas por agrupamentos aleatórios de alelos. O bolsão B foi a região que apresentou os maiores níveis de diversidade no gene HLA-B (p 0, 05), o que contrasta com a tendência geral observada nos microssatélites e genes HLA -C e -DRB 1 (r 2 = - 0, 1957, - 0, 2261 e - 0, 2637, respectivamente (p < 0, 05)). Finalizando, as populações SAE apresentaram valores de D de Tajima maiores (p < 0, 001, teste de soma de ranques de Mann-Whitney) e mais significativos (p < 0, 0000005, aplicando um teste {{binomial}} exato) no loco HLA-B, quando comparadas às populações das outras regiões. Essas diferenças entre regiões geográficas não foram observadas nos genes HLA-C e -DRB 1, corroborando a explicação seletiva para o aumento da frequência dos alelos de HLA-B originados por conversão gênica/recombinação em resposta aos novos desafios ambientais das regiões tropicais na América do Sul. As conclusões obtidas a partir de ambas as abordagens do presente trabalho apontam o gene HLA-B como o principal alvo da seleção natural, uma vez que esse loco concentra as maiores evidências de atuação de seleção natural recente quando comparado aos demais genes HLA analisados. Nós também demonstramos com as análises intragênicas que o bolsão B do PBR de HLA-B concentra por boa parte das diferenças observadas entre as populações, implicando em diferenças nos perfis de apresentação de peptídeos entre essas mesmas populações, o que pode ser interpretado como um indicativo de adaptações locais aos conjuntos de patógenos presentes em distintas regiões geográficasThe Classical HLA genes (Human Leucocyte Antigens) {{are located}} in the human Major Histocompatibility Complex (the MHC) and present the highest levels of variation on the Human genome, with thousands of alleles associated with high levels of heterozygosis and nucleotide diversity. In the present study, our goal was the identification of the main targets of natural selection on the HLA genes. We proposed two different approaches to address this issue resulting in two manuscripts. At the first approach, we performed an intragenic analysis, verifying if the amino acids at the peptide-binding region (PBR) anchor positions (the B and F pockets) exhibit higher evidences of evolution under natural selection when compared with the remaining regions of the HLA molecules. To do so, we used a dataset generated for the 13 th International Histocompatibility Workshop (IHW), composed by 6, 435 and 6, 409 individuals genotyped for HLA-A and -B respectively, belonging to 55 populations scattered along all the continents. We measured the levels of nucleotide diversity (π) of the sequences coding for the B and F pockets and compared them with the remaining PBR pockets. Concomitantly, we applied the supertype classification which consists in groups of HLA-A and -B alleles which bind overlapping sets of peptides, as a consequence of sharing specific amino acids at B and F pockets and described the patterns of supertype variation in the observed data. Next, we developed a hypothesis test in which the observed patterns of population differentiation (Gst) and variability (heterozygosity (He) and number of alleles (k)), using the supertype definition, were compared with 10, 000 replicates of random assigned groups of alleles. At the HLA-B locus, the B pocket presented the highest levels of variation (p < 0. 00001, Wilcoxon rank sum test) and concentrated most of the differences between supertypes. Our simulations results revealed that the reassignment of alleles into random groups could not reproduce the observed patterns of population differentiation (with 98...|$|R
