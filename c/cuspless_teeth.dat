40|$|Objectives: To {{examine the}} effects on bone tissues of {{immediate}} implant-supported mandibular overdentures with cusped or <b>cuspless</b> <b>teeth.</b> Methods: A randomized controlled trial was conducted at the Dental Clinic, Faculty of Dentistry, Al-Azhar University, Assiut Branch, Egypt, over a 12 -month period from September 2013 to September 2014. Twenty patients were treated with immediate implant-supported overdentures: one group received overdentures with cusped teeth, and the other group received overdentures with <b>cuspless</b> <b>teeth.</b> The rate of implant success was assessed clinically and radiographically at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. The data were collected by a questionnaire, an observation checklist, and radiography. The data were then analyzed using computerized methods. Results: Overdentures with cusped teeth showed a significant improvement in the clinical criteria, including the absence of clinical implant mobility, pain, and bone resorption, while the clinical criteria {{for the absence of}} peri-implant radiolucency were insignificantly different between the 2 groups (p> 0. 05). There {{were no significant differences in}} the clinical evaluations for bone levels at the time of insertion or 3 months after insertions, while significant differences were found at 6, 9, and 12 months after insertion. Conclusion: Overdentures with cusped teeth supported by immediate implants were found superior regarding many clinical criteria than those cuspless counterparts...|$|E
