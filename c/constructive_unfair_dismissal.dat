50|$|Mrs Rutty was a {{warehouse}} assistant in Tonbridge, Kent packing educational toys for Commotion Ltd’s business. She {{and her husband}} had to take over care for their grand daughter, Jasmine. Mrs Rutty asked the warehouse supervisor, Mr Wood, for flexible working time, as a three-day week. She was denied on the basis that the employer wanted to keep her as a full-time member, by a Mr Brown. She appealed, and Mr Coote rejected her claim again, writing back saying that the company's policy was to ‘help to create a team spirit by having a uniform working day’. She resigned and claimed her application was unreasonably rejected, <b>constructive</b> <b>unfair</b> <b>dismissal</b> and indirect discrimination.|$|E

On 24 January he resigned, and claimed for sex discrimination under s 2A SDA 1975 because he alleged that a Reverend David Miller, who had been appointed {{as a member of}} the panel interviewing for alternative posts, was transphobic. Mr Andy Baldwin also claimed for <b>constructive</b> <b>unfair</b> <b>dismissal</b> because in permitting a discriminatory work environment with an unfair selection procedure the employer breached the implied term of mutual trust and confidence.|$|E

2500|$|WorkChoices {{introduced}} several {{restrictions on}} {{who was able}} to lodge an <b>unfair</b> <b>dismissal</b> claim with the AIRC. <b>Unfair</b> <b>dismissal</b> was defined by the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (the Act) as dismissal which is [...] "harsh, unjust or unreasonable." [...] Employees had to be working for a business that had more than 100 employees, and served a qualifying period of 6 months to claim <b>unfair</b> <b>dismissal.</b> Other reasons that excluded an employee from taking <b>unfair</b> <b>dismissal</b> action included where an employee was employed on a seasonal basis or on a contract of employment for a specified period or task, employed on a probationary period that was reasonable and determined in advance, a short-term casual employee, a trainee engaged for a specific period, or an employee not employed under an award or workplace agreement and earning more than $101,300 per year.|$|R
50|$|The <b>unfair</b> <b>dismissal</b> claim would, {{if he is}} well advised, be {{in respect}} of the post-termination period and sue in court for {{wrongful}} dismissal in respect of the notice period, thus stretching out the statutory limits by making the <b>unfair</b> <b>dismissal</b> limit only start running from a later date to allow perhaps more loss of earnings and ignoring the breach of contract limit by using the court instead of tribunal to deal with wrongful dismissal.

The variables explored in the analysis relate to the arbitration result in association with the size of the employer’s business, the industry sector in which the business belongs, the occupational skill level of the dismissed employee, the presence of a human resource expert during the dismissal, the reason for the dismissal, and the type of remedy when one is ordered...|$|R

40|$|Abstract]: This study {{identifies}} {{statistically significant}} associations between <b>unfair</b> <b>dismissal</b> arbitration decisions and inherent characteristics {{pertaining to the}} <b>unfair</b> <b>dismissal</b> claims. The inherent characteristics examined are the industry sector in which the employee worked, the occupational skill level of the employee’s position, size of the business, presence of human resource expertise within the business, the reason for dismissal, and the genders of both the employee and arbitrator. This research contributes {{to the body of}} knowledge on grievance activity within the workplace. It focuses specifically on arbitrated grievances and as such, AIRC <b>unfair</b> <b>dismissal</b> decisions are investigated as an exemplar of arbitrated grievance activity. This study is within an Australian context which may limit its world-wide generalisability but its strength is that it addresses across industry and across occupational data. Empirical analysis is undertaken using data collected from <b>unfair</b> <b>dismissal</b> arbitration decisions made by the AIRC during 2004 and 2005.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the journey Australia traversed {{in the development}} at of the <b>unfair</b> <b>dismissal</b> protections it provides {{the majority of its}} workers, since the nation's Federation in 1901. Historically, the country's Constitutional "heads of power" were intended to prohibit the federal government from regulating individual aspects of the employment relationship. Over time, such interpretations of the constitutional powers were challenged by governing parties, resulting in the modern-day, "national" <b>unfair</b> <b>dismissal</b> protections afforded to the majority of workers. The journey Australians traversed during the architecture of their current <b>unfair</b> <b>dismissal</b> legislation provides a lesson on a government's ability to conjure significant influence on individual arrangements between management and workers. Despite Australia's participation in the worldwide, neoliberal push to deregulate labour markets, the protection of workers from <b>unfair</b> <b>dismissal</b> is an explicit matter in the employment relationship attracting increased regulation through industrial legislation. This paper culminates in reporting the consequences facing employers who improperly administer dismissals and how employers can take steps to mitigate such risks...|$|R
40|$|<b>Unfair</b> <b>dismissal</b> law {{has been}} the {{persistent}} subject of reform {{since its inception in}} Britain and Australia. This paper endeavours to identify the ideas and perceptions that have animated the contestations between traditional and emerging notions of <b>unfair</b> <b>dismissal</b> law producing this reform. In Britain in particular {{and to a lesser extent}} in Australia, there has been consideration of a new reform proposal of compensated no fault dismissal which would seek to challenge the normative ideal of industrial justice used to justify traditional <b>unfair</b> <b>dismissal</b> law. The primary arguments being used by proponents of the no fault dismissal proposal pertain to efficiency, simplicity and reducing regulatory burdens upon business. This paper questions whether these arguments provide a sufficient basis for replacing traditional <b>unfair</b> <b>dismissal</b> law with no fault dismissal, arguing that the latter relies upon a commodity conception of work that does not account for benefits other than the economic value which an individual receives from their job.

40|$|This work {{explores the}} {{evolutionary}} dynamic {{exhibited by the}} trajectory of <b>unfair</b> <b>dismissal</b> law in Britain and Australia. A different comparative evolutionary dynamic is observed in the phase {{leading up to the}} enactment of a statutory <b>unfair</b> <b>dismissal</b> scheme and in the period subsequent to enactment. It is argued that the shared common law origin of the legal systems of Britain and Australia masks significant divergence in their respective labour law traditions. Whilst collective laissez-faire in Britain, and conciliation and arbitration in Australia both sought to secure industrial peace, these divergent traditions operated in a manner particular to their jurisdiction in constraining the evolution of a statutory <b>unfair</b> <b>dismissal</b> law. It was only when these traditions underwent severe economic, social and political challenges that they faced a crisis of legitimacy and new ideas for labour law were canvassed. Although occurring over twenty years apart, the breakdown of Britain’s and Australia’s labour law traditions saw the juridification of domestic labour law, with a central reform being the inception of a statutory right protecting against <b>unfair</b> <b>dismissal.</b> Despite emerging from divergent legal traditions and according to different timeframes, the trajectory of <b>unfair</b> <b>dismissal</b> law subsequent to its enactment was to converge upon a common theme of peeling back the statutory superstructure in favour of localised and alternative dispute resolution. Although these developments are diachronistic across the two jurisdictions, this evolutionary dynamic of divergence giving way to convergence is revealing of a high degree of path dependency as between the <b>unfair</b> <b>dismissal</b> laws of Britain and Australia.
