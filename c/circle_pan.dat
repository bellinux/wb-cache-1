This paper delves in the project promoted by the poets around the cited magazine, by focusing on two concise aspects: on the one hand, the self-definition of the lyrical group as "poets of the people" and the modulations acquired by such figuration on the pages of El Barrilete; on the other hand, the controversy held by the publication members with the <b>circle</b> of El <b>pan</b> duro, oriented towards establishing which of these social actors are better positioned to exercise genuine representation of the "people"...|$|R

In particular Mako's [...] "love triangle" [...] with fellow characters Korra and Asami was heavily criticized. Reviewer Alex Cranz described the situation as [...] "soapiness usually reserved for shows about women banging vampires". Reviewer Hannah Strom described the love triangle as [...] "ridiculousness" [...] and described Mako as [...] "kind of a terrible person". She also held that [...] "both Korra and Asami are way too cool for any of this ridiculousness and should go run away and have their own adventures". At the conclusion of Season Two, reviewer Jason Krell created an extensive list of suggestions to make Season Three “amazing”. At {{the top of his}} list was for Korra and Asami to “love Mako no more”. Krell characterized the love triangle as a tired romantic dynamic. Reviewer Max Nicholson noted that fans [...] "expressed frustration" [...] with Mako in his treatment of particularly Asami in the saga while praising the show's creators decision to give voice to fans' frustrations with Mako in the form of Prince Wu in [...] "Remembrances".|$|R
