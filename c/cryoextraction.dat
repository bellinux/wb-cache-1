50|$|Ice cider can be {{made from}} two {{processes}} that concentrate the natural sugars within an apple through the use of cold temperatures: cryoconcentration and <b>cryoextraction.</b> The most common apples used for the production of ice cider are McIntosh, Cortland, Empire and Spartan. Due to <b>cryoextraction</b> requiring the apples to remain on the branches later than they are typically picked, new breeds of apple have been developed specifically for the production of ice cider.|$|E
50|$|The {{process of}} {{cryoconcentration}} resembles slightly the process indigenous Canadians realized occurred when maple syrup could be concentrated by the cold.

5000|$|Selig Percy Amoils, FRCS, born 1933, is a South African {{ophthalmologist}} and {{biomedical engineering}} inventor. [...] In 1965, Amoils refined the <b>cryoextraction</b> method of cataract surgery {{by developing a}} cryoprobe that was cooled through the Joule-Thomson effect of gas expansion.

50|$|In ophthalmology, <b>cryoextraction</b> {{is a form}} of intracapsular {{cataract}} extraction {{in which}} a cryoextractor, a special type of cryoprobe, is used to freeze the crystalline lens and pull it intact from the eye. Dr. Charles Kelman is credited with pioneering this surgical method in 1962. It can also be used in the treatment of orbital tumors.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cryoextraction</b> is {{the process}} by which grapes are frozen with {{refrigeration}} and pressed. Winemakers subject grapes to temperatures around 20 degrees Fahrenheit (or -7 degrees Celsius), and press them while still frozen. Ice crystals remain in the press, while concentrated juice flows out. The resulting wine resembles ice wine. The process of freeze distillation is similar in its concentrating effects, although it occurs after fermentation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cryoextraction</b> {{is a form}} of ICCE that freezes {{the lens}} with a {{cryogenic}} substance such as liquid nitrogen. In this technique, the cataract is extracted through use of a cryoextractor — a cryoprobe whose refrigerated tip adheres to and freezes tissue of the lens, permitting its removal. Although it is now used primarily for the removal of subluxated lenses, it was the favored form of cataract extraction from the late 1960s to the early 1980s.|$|E
5000|$|In Austria, Germany, the United States, and Canada, {{the grapes}} must freeze {{naturally}} {{to be called}} ice wine. In other countries, some winemakers use <b>cryoextraction</b> (that is, mechanical freezing) to simulate {{the effect of a}} frost and typically do not leave the grapes to hang for extended periods as is done with natural ice wines. These non-traditional wines are sometimes referred to as [...] "icebox wines". An example is Bonny Doon's Vin de Glacière or King Estate's Vin Glace (made from Oregon Pinot gris grapes). German wine law entirely bans post-harvest freezing methods, even if not labeled [...] "Eiswein".|$|E

40|$|Background and {{objective}} Main airway severe obstruction {{is a problem}} facing difficulty flexible bronchoscope because the patient {{is not able to}} breath smoothly under prostration, and death from suffocation is a frequent outcome. Managing the airway of patients with critical tracheal stenosis remains a formidable challenge to bronchoscopists. This study is to evaluate the application and efficacy of argon plasma coagulation (APC) and <b>cryoextraction</b> for thetreatment of endobronchial neoplasma under rigid bronchoscope combined with flexible bronchoscope. Methods Two groups of airway pathologically proved neoplasma were retrospectively reviewed for the different endobronchial intervation modalities. Group A: Argon plasma coagulation (APC) and <b>cryoextraction</b> were used for the treatment of endobronchial neoplasma under rigid bronchoscope combined with electronic bronchoscope in 19 cases with tracheobronchial carcinoma. Rigid bronchoscope was inserted into trachea with general anesthesia. Then the endobronchial tumor was removed by the combination APC and <b>cryoextraction.</b> Group B: APC and grasp or <b>cryoextraction</b> were used for the debulking of endobronchial tumor under flexible bronchoscope in 20 cases with airway tumor. Results Both tracheal and bronchial obstruction were more severe in Group A than those in Group B, but the tumor debulking was higher {{for the first time in}} Group A than in Group B. There were no difference on debulking volume between trachea and bronchus in the same group. The procedures were less complex in Group A than in Group B. The clinical improvement was better in Group A than inGroup B. There were no severe complications directly related to the procedures. Conclusion The combination of APC and <b>cryoextraction</b> is a rapid and effective method for the treatment of endoluminal airway tumor under rigid bronchoscope combined with electronic bronchoscope. <b>Cryoextraction</b> could rapidly debulk airway tumor and APC could effectively ablate tumor and stop bleeding. Electronic bronchoscope is used for the maintenance after rigid bronchoscope and for the treatment of slightly airway obstruction...|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY Thirty-two {{eyes with}} subluxated and dislocated lenses were surgically managed {{by means of}} the vitrophage. The best results were {{obtained}} for those cases in which subluxation or dislocation of lenses into the vitreous was not associated with other complications such as glaucoma, perforating injuries, and retinal detachment. No major intraoperative or postoperative problems were seen in uncomplicated cases during a follow-up period ranging from 5 to 45 months. Management of subluxated and dislocated lenses has remained controversial. The indications for surgical intervention and the procedure of choice are still debatable. Many indications for the removal of dislocated lenses have been described (Haik, 1961; Chandler, 1964; Selleyer and Barraquer, 1973). However, these vary among surgeons. Surgical techniques previously used for removing subluxated or dislocated lenses have included dis-cission, aspiration, lens extraction with forceps or loop, and <b>cryoextraction.</b> Unfortunately these pro-cedures have been associated with a high incidence of operative and postoperative complications (Jarrett, 1967; Barraquer, 1972; Liesman, 1972), such as vitreous loss, retinal detachment, and glau-coma. For this reason many ophthalmologists have considered surgery for dislocated lenses to be very risky and have avoided operating on such eyes. The automated vitrectomy instruments such as the vitrophage have greatly aided the surgery of the anterior segment. We have previously described the use of this instrument for cataracts in adults and children, for anterior segment reconstruction (Pey-man and Sanders, 1975; Peyman, et al., 1975; Peyman et al., 1977; Peyman et al., 1978 a, b) and for removal of dislocated lenses through the pars plana route (Peyman and Sanders, 1975). In this report we describe various techniques we have used to deal with dislocated lenses of different types.

40|$|Ice cider is {{produced}} by fermenting apple juice that has been concentrated by freezing (cryoconcentration or <b>cryoextraction).</b> Ice cider is more a sweet wine than a cider, with an intense apple flavour and sweetness, and acidity to balance the flavours. It originates from Canada, where specifications includes a pre-fermentation sugar content of not less than 30 °Brix, and a finished product with a residual sugar content of not less than 130 g/l, containing 7 - 13 % alcohol. This project aims to investigate and document some of the aspects of ice cider production process for Swedish conditions. The ambition is to start building experience and knowledge useful for ice cider production in Sweden. The scientific documentation on ice cider fermentation and biochemical properties of cryoconcentrated apple juice is very limited. In this project factors important {{for the quality of}} cider and ice wine were reviewed, and methods for producing ice cider through cryoconcentration and subsequent fermentation were evaluated. It was demonstrated in this project that concentrating the apple juice by cold has an equally concentrating effect on sugars, total acids and total phenolics. It was also demonstrated that the level of concentration of the juice highly influences the fermentation kinetics and output. Higher sugar level slowed down the rate of fermentation, and the amount of ethanol produced was lower. In order to produce a good ice cider, the juice needs to be sufficiently concentrated to produce the alcohol content and residual sugar level that defines the product, while not be too concentrated and place excessive hyperosmotic stress upon the yeast cells, resulting in slow and potentially stuck fermentations. The juice needs to hold a minimum of 32 °Brix, while a juice of above 42 °Brix will be very difficult to ferment. It was further demonstrated in this project that the selection of yeast strain has an effect on level of ethanol produced, and acid development during fermentation of ice cider. The level of phenolics was found to remain fairly stable across different yeast strains during fermentation. The yeast strain was also demonstrated to have a small impact on the flavour of the ice cider...|$|E
