40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{an ongoing}} {{effort to develop}} new geospatial information products for <b>aiding</b> <b>coastal</b> forest restoration and conservation efforts in coastal Louisiana and Mississippi. This project employs Landsat, Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data in conjunction with airborne elevation data to compute coastal forest cover type maps and change detection products. Improved forest mapping products are needed to <b>aid</b> <b>coastal</b> forest restoration and management efforts of State and Federal agencies in the Northern Gulf of Mexico (NGOM) region. In particular, such products may <b>aid</b> <b>coastal</b> forest land acquisition and conservation easement procurements. This region's forests are often disturbed and subjected to multiple biotic and abiotic threats, including subsidence, salt water intrusion, hurricanes, sea-level rise, insect-induced defoliation and mortality, altered hydrology, wildfire, and conversion to non-forest land use. In some cases, such forest disturbance has led to forest loss or loss of regeneration capacity. In response, a case {{study was conducted to}} assess and demonstrate the potential of satellite remote sensing products for improving forest type maps and for assessing forest change over the last 25 years. Change detection products are needed for assessing risks for specific priority coastal forest types, such as live oak and baldcypress-dominated forest. Preliminary results indicate Landsat time series data are capable of generating the needed forest type and change detection products. Useful classifications were obtained using 2 strategies: 1) general forest classification based on use of 3 seasons of Landsat data from the same year; and 2) classification of specific forest types of concern using a single date of Landsat data in which a given targeted type is spectrally distinct compared to adjacent forested cover. When available, ASTER data was useful as a complement to Landsat data. Elevation data helped to define areas in which targeted forest types occur, such as live oak forests on natural levees. MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index time series data aided visual assessments of coastal forest damage and recovery from hurricanes. Landsat change detection products enabled change to be identified at the stand level and at 10 - year intervals with the earliest date preceding available change detection products from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and from the U. S. Geological Survey. Additional work is being done in collaboration with State and Federal agency partners in a follow-on NASA ROSES project to refine and validate these new, promising products.

Because calling the implementation DN3 plan is an acceptance of severe problems, the DN3 plan was not invoked in the 1985 Mexico City earthquake that left large areas of Mexico City in ruins, since the authorities did not want to recognize there was an emergency in the capital, while the army was called to the city, it was just a peacekeeping force.

Final population densities of H. galeatus followed a negative linear regression (r² = 0. 92 and 0. 83; P <= 0. 01) with increasing salinity levels. Final population densities of B. longicaudatus were quadratically (r² = 0. 72 and 0. 78; P <= 0. 01) related to increasing salinity levels from 0 to 25 dS/m. An increase in population densities of B. longicaudatus was observed at moderate salinity levels (10 and 15 dS/m) compared to 0 dS/m. Root-length comparisons revealed that B. longicaudatus caused root stunting at low salinity levels, 0 to 10 dS/m, but roots were not affected at 15 to 25 dS/m.

40|$|Abstract A {{strong but}} {{variable}} western boundary current flows {{south along the}} east coast of Madagascar, and at the island's southern end interacts with eddies propagating zonally from the east. These two routes of variability are compared using altimetric sea surface height (SSH) data and dynamic height from a high-resolution numerical model. The effects on biological productivity are also discussed. Hydrographic analysis The westward-flowing South Equatorial Current branches on reaching Madagascar, with the East Madagascar Current (EMC) flowing southward along the coast. A mooring at 23 ˚S recorded a mean near-surface current of 0. 7 ms- 1, with variations throughout the year, but no clear seasonal signal (Schott et al., 1988). Analysis of ship drift data suggest a seasonal variation, with slightly greater speeds during the austral winter and spring (Lutjeharms et al., 2000). Here we build upon these observations using satellite data and output from a numerical model. Satellite analysis The EMC carries warm, nutrient-poor water poleward; however, the flow <b>aids</b> <b>coastal</b> upwelling of cold nutrient-laden waters, which encourages phytoplankton growth. Usually this results in a sharp chlorophyll boundary parallel to the coast. An exception is shown in Fig. 1 b, where there is a tongue of high productivity water extending more than 200 km from the coast. This is due to a cyclonic eddy embedded within the EMC (Fig. 1 a). Altimeter data reveal a number of cyclones and anticyclones moving southward within the EMC each year, but not all seem to affect the near-surface chlorophyll...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2014 Coastal flood hazard {{zones and}} the design of coastal {{defenses}} are often devised using either the maximum recorded total water level (TWL) or a 'design' event such as the 100 -year return-level flood, usually projected from observed extreme events. Despite technological advances driving more consistent instrumental records of wave heights and water levels, the observational record may be short, punctuated with intermittent gaps, and vary in quality. These issues in the observational record result in limited estimates of extreme return-level events. We present a model that simulates the various components (waves, non-tidal residuals, and tides) of TWLs on sandy beaches in a Monte Carlo sense, {{taking into account the}} conditional dependencies that exist between the components. Extreme events are modeled using non-stationary extreme value distributions that include the effects of seasonality and climate variability. The resulting synthetic TWL time series allow for empirical extraction of return level events and the ability to robustly estimate and assess present-day flood and erosion hazards. We demonstrate this approach along a northern Oregon, USA littoral cell and evaluate both the chronic and extreme coastal hazards affecting the area. Simulations result in extreme TWL return levels up to 90 cm higher than those estimated from the "observational" TWL record which results in approximately 25 % more coastal flooding during the simulated 100 -year return level event as compared to that event computed using "observational" data only. More robust estimates of extreme TWLs and tighter confidence bounds on return level events can <b>aid</b> <b>coastal</b> engineers, managers, and emergency planners in evaluating exposure to hazards...|$|R
40|$|Mercury is a toxic {{that was}} mined in California’s Coast Range, and then {{used in the}} Sierra Nevada foothills for {{extraction}} of gold. Weathering of abandoned waste rock piles and mines, plus erosion of contaminated microorganisms, transform it into a more toxic form, methyl-mercury. This enters food chains where it bioaccumulates to concentrations that can cause impaired neurological function {{in a variety of}} higher organisms (fish, birds, humans). This toxic conversion has, in the scientific literature, been quite dogmatically attributed to activities of sulfate-reducing bacteria. Importantly, recent unpublished results from our laboratory with freshwater sediments show that iron-reducing bacteria can also convert inorganic mercury into methyl mercury, and do so at rates equivalent to those of sulfate-reducing bacteria. Due to California’s high concentration of iron in coastal sediments, we propose to test the hypothesis that iron-reducing bacteria also contribute significantly to the overall production of methyl mercury in marine sediments. We will do this by exploring the linkage between methyl mercury production and the activity of iron-reducing bacteria. In mercury-contaminated marine sediments, we will measure rates of methyl mercury production along with signature activities of different bacterial metabolic types, i. e. sulfate reduction and iron reduction. A second approach involves culturing evolutionarily diverse iron-reducing bacteria from contaminated marine sediments to compare (vs. sulfate-reducers) their relative abilities to methylate mercury. Understanding, based on potential in pure cultures and activities in contaminated sediments, which bacterial types contribute significantly to mercury methylation in <b>coastal</b> sediments will <b>aid</b> in modeling of marine methyl mercury problems, and in creating remediation strategies for impacted sites.

Chloride concentrations of groundwater in a coastal aquifer near San Diego, California, range from about 57 to 39, 400 mg/L. On the basis of relative proportions of major-ions, the chemical composition is classified as Na-Ca-Cl-SO 4, Na-Cl, or Na-Ca-Cl type water. δ 2 H and δ 18 O values range from − 47. 7 ‰ to − 12. 8 ‰ and from − 7. 0 ‰ to − 1. 2 ‰, respectively. The isotopically depleted groundwater occurs in the deeper part of the coastal aquifer, and the isotopically enriched groundwater occurs in zones of sea water intrusion. 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios range from about 0. 7050 to 0. 7090, and differ between shallower and deeper flow paths in the coastal aquifer. 3 H and 14 C analyses indicate {{that most of the}} groundwater was recharged many thousands of years ago. The analysis of multiple chemical and isotopic tracers indicates that the sources and movement of saline groundwater in the San Diego coastal aquifer are dominated by: (1) recharge of local precipitation in relatively shallow parts of the flow system; (2) regional flow of recharge of higher-elevation precipitation along deep flow paths that freshen a previously saline aquifer; and (3) intrusion of sea water that entered the aquifer primarily during premodern times.

40|$|Sea-level rise is {{expected}} to affect agricultural land in low-lying coastal areas by salinization of the groundwater {{as the result of}} seawater intrusion. One of the potential solutions to the decreasing yield on salt affect agricultural land is the change in land-use from traditional agriculture to inland marine aquaculture, e. g. sustainable cultivation of marine shellfish. Exploration of presence and ambient growth rates of shellfish in surrounding <b>coastal</b> seas might <b>aid</b> in finding suitable locations for sustainable inland shellfish cultivation. At present, cockles (Cerastoderma edule) are a national export product of the Netherlands and are manually harvested in the Dutch Wadden Sea. However, the cultivation of cockles is being considered for low-lying polders in this area. To find suitable locations for these activities, we calculated the growth rates of cockles from annual SIBES (Synoptic Intertidal Benthic Sampling Program) field surveys that started in 2008, covering all tidal flats of the Wadden Sea. Data on shell length and age was used to fit Von Bertalanffy growth functions. To better understand the potential causes of the observed variation in growth, the relationship between cockle growth and environmental conditions was modelled by means of a generalized additive model. Cockle growth was related to sampling year, distance to gullies and median grain size. Model outcomes were used to map the growth conditions for cockles on the tidal flats of the Wadden Sea. Cockle growth is predicted to be high near tidal inlets (in particular those near the islands of Texel, Vlieland, Terschelling and Borkum) and low at the tidal divides. This map and its underlying information on growth conditions provides a baseline to identify and modify suitable inland locations for sustainable cockle cultivations along the coastlines of the Wadden Sea...|$|R

Land use land cover change information is needed to help coastal zone managers and planners to understand and mitigate the impacts of environmental change on the region.

40|$|Investigations of the geomorphic and {{sedimentary}} {{context in}} which turbid zone reefs exist, both in the modern and fossil reef record, can inform key ecological debates regarding species tolerances and adaptability to elevated turbidity and sedimentation. Furthermore, these investigations can address critical geological and palaeoecological questions surrounding longer-term coral-sediment interactions and reef growth histories. Here we review current knowledge about turbid zone reefs from the inner-shelf regions of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) in Australia to consider these issues and to evaluate reef growth in the period prior to and post European settlement. We also consider the future prospects of these reefs under reported changing water quality regimes. Turbid zone reefs on the GBR are relatively well known compared to those in other reef regions. They occur within 20 km of the mainland coast where reef development {{may be influenced by}} continual or episodic terrigenous sediment inputs, fluctuating salinities (24 - 36 ppt), and reduced water quality through increased nutrient and pollutant delivery from urban and agricultural runoff. Individually, and in synergy, these environmental conditions are widely viewed as unfavourable for sustained and vigorous coral reef growth, and thus these reefs are widely perceived as marginal compared to clear water reef systems. However, recent research has revealed that this view is misleading, and that in fact many turbid zone reefs in this region are resilient, exhibit relatively high live coral cover (> 30 %) and have distinctive community assemblages dominated by fast growing (Acropora, Montipora) and/or sediment tolerant species (Turbinaria, Goniopora, Galaxea, Porites). Palaeoecological reconstructions based on the analysis of reef cores show that community assemblages are relatively stable at millennial timescales, and that many reefs are actively accreting (average 2 - 7 mm/year) where accommodation space is available, despite recent anthropogenic pressures. These turbid zone reefs challenge traditional views on the environmental conditions required for active reef growth, but given their proximity to land and associated stresses, current knowledge on these less well understood reefs should be synthesised to <b>aid</b> <b>coastal</b> management directives. Terrigenous sediments are a dominant influence on turbid zone reef occurrence, composition and growth, and, therefore, the assessment of their future prospects will require a detailed understanding of the sedimentary regimes under which they occur and of their differential response modes...|$|R
40|$|Management of {{the coast}} {{and the effects of}} sea-level rise will arguably be one of the {{greatest}} challenges coastal communities will face in coming years. Striking a balance between planning restrictions and coastal development will become a more contentious issue, therefore dealing with coastal hazards and risks in this context needs to take a pragmatic and adaptable approach. The Bellarine Peninsula - Corio Bay Local Coastal Hazard Assessment is one of four state-wide pilot projects looking at coastal hazards on a "coastal compartment" scale. In Victoria, little guidance exists for the preparation of these documents other than the consideration of a sea-level rise benchmark of 0. 8 m by 2100. This benchmark requirement must also be considered for 'greenfield' development, with an additional consideration of 0. 2 m sea-level rise by 2040 for infill development. (Victorian Coastal Strategy, 2014). The assessment used some innovative methods which will <b>aid</b> <b>coastal</b> managers to effectively and actively manage their coast. The assessment moved away from the use of specific timeframes as a reference. The aim of this was to avoid tying the sea-level rise scenarios to a specific year which may imply a higher level of certainty than is warranted. The preferred approach was to assess the coastal inundation and erosion hazards for a given amount of sea-level rise and determine the likely consequences. This approach leads to the adoption of a "trigger point" approach for coastal hazards where given actions or responses can be tied to a measureable quantity, that is, increases in mean sea-level. Hydrodynamic inundation modelling was used to predict inundation extents as well as the duration of inundation for key areas identified as being the most vulnerable. This showed that, in many cases, the peak inundation level of the design storm event only occurred {{at the top of the}} tide (less than 2 hours). The aim of the outputs from the hazard assessment was to present managers with information that allows the development of realistic local responses.

The ground truth survey included grab sample measurements and underwater video imagery at {{more than two hundred}} sites in the Merrimack River Embayment, Gulf of Maine, USA. There has been an ambitious effort by the state agencies in Massachusetts to do seafloor characterization as part of the MA Ocean Management Plan. This sediment data ground-truth’s the existing, recently-collected geophysical data at a finer scale than any previous sampling. The sediment from the grab samples was separated into fractions of quarter phi size resolution so grain size distributions could be analyzed. The underwater video imagery was used to describe the surface texture of the sediment. The sediment and video data from each ground truth station were then georeferenced and geospatially analyzed using ArcGIS. Sediment samples primarily were composed of coarse iron-rich garnet sands and finer amphibole-rich grey sands. Grain size analysis included fraction, skewness, and kurtosis of the grain size distribution. Negative skewness around the delta is caused by an abundance of fine sediment in the Merrimack River derived sands, suggesting a fluvial, rather than tidal, origin of the particles. Optic and acoustic remote-sensing surveys were used to gain complete spatial coverage of the seafloor, returning different values based on the depth, surface texture and reflectance. Airborne Lidar Bathymetry (ALB) collected by the United States Army Corps of Engineers in 2007 was used to map land and the seafloor up to a depth of 15 meters below sea level. Swath bathymetry and backscatter imagery data, collected by the United States Geologic Survey (USGS) from 2004 - 2005, was used for intermediate water depths ranging from 10 to 120 meters below sea level. These surveys were then used to segment sediment types based on the backscatter intensity using ArcGIS tools. The results of this work, along with the previous results from a physiographic study provided by the USGS, will support additional <b>coastal</b> research and <b>aid</b> in <b>coastal</b> zone management decisions...|$|R
40|$|The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR 5) {{states that}} climate change and ocean {{acidification}} are altering the oceans {{at a rate that}} is unprecedented compared with the recent past, leading to multifaceted impacts on marine ecosystems, associated goods and services, and human societies. AR 5 underlined key uncertainties that remain regarding how synergistic changes in the ocean are likely to affect human systems, and how humans are likely to respond to these events. As climate change research has accelerated rapidly following AR 5, an updated synthesis of available knowledge is necessary to identify emerging evidence, and to thereby better inform policy discussions. This paper reviews the literature to capture corroborating, conflicting, and novel findings published following the cut-off date for contribution to AR 5. Specifically, we highlight key scientific developments on the impacts of climate-induced changes in the ocean on key socioeconomic sectors, including fisheries, aquaculture and tourism. New evidence continues to support a climate-induced redistribution of benefits and losses at multiple scales and across coastal and marine socio-ecological systems, partly resulting from species and ecosystem range shifts and changes in primary productivity. New efforts have been made to characterize and value ecosystem services in the context of climate change, with specific relevance to ecosystem-based adaptation. Recent studies have also explored synergistic interactions between climatic drivers, and have found strong variability between impacts on species at different life stages. Although climate change may improve conditions for some types of freshwater aquaculture, potentially providing alternative opportunities to adapt to impacts on wild capture fisheries, ocean acidification poses a risk to shellfish fisheries and aquaculture. The risk of increased prevalence of disease under warmer temperatures is uncertain, and may detrimentally affect human health. Climate change may also induce changes in tourism flows, leading to substantial geospatial shifts in economic costs and benefits associated with tourism revenue and coastal infrastructure protection and repairs. While promising, ecosystem-based coastal adaptation approaches are still emerging, and require an improved understanding of key ecosystem services and values for coastal communities in order to assess risk, <b>aid</b> <b>coastal</b> development planning, and build decision support systems...|$|R
40|$|Studies {{on modern}} {{sediment}} transport and deposition, especially studies analyzing settling particles collected with sediment traps, have rarely {{been carried out}} in the northern South China Sea. Using sediment trap time series data from Site XS 1 (17 degrees 24. 5 'N, 110 degrees 55. 0 'E, water depth 1690 m) adjacent to the Xisha Trough, variations in sediment source through time have been reconstructed. These observations include total particle flux (TPF) and current data, grain size distributions, and clay mineral compositions obtained from two sediment traps deployed in 500 m and 1500 m water depth, respectively. Time series records at Site XS 1 changed seasonally for both sampled layers. TPF in the lower layer (426 mg/m(2) /d) was several times that of the upper layer (113 mg/m 2 /d) and is affected by lateral transport. However, mean grain size (Mz) of the upper layer is greater that of the lower layer (29 vs 10 mu m) due to contributions from biogenic materials. There are no clear seasonal changes in clay mineral assemblage in either the upper or lower layers. The annual percentages of four main clay minerals were 82 - 83 % illite, 7 - 9 % kaolinite, 6 - 8 % chlorite and 1 - 3 % smectite. Taiwan was the dominant sediment source (42 - 74 %), while sediment contributions from the Red River and Annamite Chain account for 23 - 53 % and 0 - 15 %, respectively. Sediment supply from Taiwan could be explained by deep water current flow, while <b>coastal</b> currents may <b>aid</b> sediment transport from the Red River and small mountainous rivers of central Vietnam.

40|$|In October 2011, the Kenya Defence Forces entered Southern Somalia for {{organized}} {{military operations}} with a Swahili codenamed “Operation Linda Nchi”, {{with the aim}} of capturing the port city Kismayu and weakening the Al-Shabaab militia group. This was as a result of kidnappings of foreign tourists in the <b>Coastal</b> Kenya and <b>aid</b> workers. The military operation however, prompted a domino effect of retaliatory attacks in Kenya by these insurgents. These terror attacks have resulted into severe impacts in Kenya that have also had an effect on the Kenyan media, which is characterized as one among the most vibrant and respected medias in Africa. This thesis aims at exploring the impacts of these terror attacks on the Kenyan media freedom. It focuses on the three major terror attacks; Westgate Mall, Mpeketoni and Garissa University attack, which took place in Kenya. It will then look further into the attack {{that took place in the}} Kenya Defence Forces’ camp in El-Adde Somalia. In order to address this study, a qualitative case study research method was incorporated to gather data regarding these attacks and how they have had an impact on the media freedom in Kenya. The study reveals that the Kenyan media is in fact facing a clamp-down in that the impacts of the Al-Shabaab attacks have had an implication on the media freedom albeit, indirectly. This has been through the string of anti-terrorism measures stipulated in the Security Law Amendment Act, which was passed into law by the parliament in 2014. President Kenyatta backed-up these laws as a measure to improve the country’s security scope in detecting, deterring and disrupting threats to the national security. The new laws have ignited major debates on the spirit of the Kenyan constitution regarding freedom of expression due to the significant influence it has on what the media intends to disseminate and how it disseminates it to the public. The study shows that the Kenyan media is a principal institution of the public sphere because it has provided an arena for two-way communication between the citizenry and polity resulting into the building of public opinion. The thesis further adds that the media in Kenya is an interface between the people and the state as an instrument in the flow of public information to the people. Thus, the study argues that the independence of the media and its free access is paramount as a beneficial factor in representing individuals and gauging democracy within the polity. Therefore, the thesis contends that the government is required to devise new strategies and measures to wage war on terror without antagonizing the media operations as it is a key sphere in Kenya...|$|R
