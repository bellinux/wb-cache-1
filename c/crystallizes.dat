40|$|Past {{studies that}} have {{examined}} the relationship between Openness and <b>crystallized</b> ability have failed to account statistically for the fact that subtests commonly regarded as measures of <b>crystallized</b> intelligence (e. g., Vocabulary) are contaminated substantially by general intelligence. A method using residuals derived from a regression is proposed as a means to estimate <b>crystallized</b> ability. Further, self-reported intelligence was hypothesized to moderate or mediate the correlation between Openness and <b>crystallized</b> intelligence. It was found that two factors (General and Objective) could be derived from a principal components analysis (PCA) of the six Openness facets and that only Objective Openness correlated with intelligence. Using the residual approach to estimating <b>crystallized</b> ability, it was found that Objective Openness correlated with only g and not <b>crystallized</b> ability. The self-report intelligence measure correlated only with the General Openness factor.

Berkelium(III) phosphate (BkPO4) has been prepared as a solid, which shows strong fluorescence under argon laser (514.5nm line) excitation. Berkelium hydrides {{are produced by}} reacting metal with hydrogen gas at temperatures about 250 °C. They are non-stoichiometric with the nominal formula BkH2+x (0 < x < 1).

5|$|Surface {{currents}} only {{affect the}} top few hundred meters (yards) of the sea, {{but there are}} also large-scale flows in the ocean depths caused by the movement of deep water masses. A main deep ocean current flows through all the world's oceans and is known as the thermohaline circulation or global conveyor belt. This movement is slow and is driven by differences in density of the water caused by variations in salinity and temperature. At high latitudes, the water is chilled by the low atmospheric temperature and becomes saltier as sea ice <b>crystallizes</b> out. Both these factors make it denser and the water sinks. From the deep sea near Greenland, such water flows southwards between the continental landmasses {{on either side of the}} Atlantic. When it reaches the Antarctic, it is joined by further masses of cold, sinking water and flows eastwards. It then splits into two streams that move northwards into the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Here it is gradually warmed, becomes less dense, rises towards the surface, and loops back on itself. Some flows back into the Atlantic. It takes a thousand years for this circulation pattern to be completed.|$|E
