40|$|Dry skin is {{characterized}} as a rough and scaling skin surface. It usually has lower water content than normal skin. Vitamin D helps to regulate cellular proliferation and differentiation andcan help to protect skin from environmental factors. However, the stability vitamin D in cosmetic formulations is low. Thus, {{the aim of this}} study was to evaluate the sensory properties and protective effects on skin hydration of a <b>cosmetic</b> <b>formulation</b> containing Cichorium intybus root extract, previously shown to be “vitamin D like” (VD). A formulation containing VD or not (vehicle) was applied on the arm, forearm and face of fifteen subjects. Measurements of stratum corneum water content, Transepidermal Water Loss (TEWL) and skin microrelief parameters were performed using biophysical and skin image techniques before (baseline), after 2 hours, and after 45 and 90 days of daily application of the formulations. Only the formulation with VD was effective in maintaining skin barrier function and skin hydration under low humidity conditions.

40|$|Phytoconstituents {{are gaining}} {{popularity}} as ingredients in <b>cosmetic</b> <b>formulations</b> {{as they can}} protect the skin against exogenous and endogenous harmful agents and can help remedy many skin conditions. Exposure of skin to sunlight and other atmospheric conditions causes the production of reactive oxygen species, which can react with DNA, proteins, and fatty acids, causing oxidative damage and impairment of antioxidant system. Such injuries damage regulation pathways of skin and lead to photoaging and skin cancer development. The effects of aging include wrinkles, roughness, appearance of fine lines, lack of elasticity, and de- or hyperpigmentation marks. Herbal extracts act on these areas and produce healing, softening, rejuvenating, and sunscreen effects.
