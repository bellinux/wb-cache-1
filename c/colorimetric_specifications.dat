5000|$|Building on the Optical Society of America's {{report on}} {{colorimetry}} in 1922, the CIE convened its eighth session in 1931, {{with the intention}} of establishing an international agreement on <b>colorimetric</b> <b>specifications</b> and updating the OSA's 1922 recommendations based on the developments during the past decade. The meeting, held in Cambridge, United Kingdom, concluded with the formalization of the CIE 1931 XYZ colour space and definitions of the 1931 CIE 2° standard observer with the corresponding colour matching functions, and standard illuminants A, B, and C.|$|E
5000|$|The {{official}} state colors, colonial blue and buff, are {{designated by the}} Textile Color Card Association of the United States, Inc., New York, as [...] "arno blue" [...] (Cable No. 10663), and [...] "golden beige" [...] (Cable No. 10781) respectively; the color shades having been determined by <b>Colorimetric</b> <b>Specifications</b> of the National Bureau of Standards, United States Department of Commerce, in Test No. 2, 1/140565, dated November 18, 1954, which is on file with the Delaware Public Archives, Dover, Delaware. The colors of the coat of arms and {{other elements of the}} state flag shall be the following: Husbandman, trousers of gray brown, shirt of red, hat and hilling hoe of brown; rifleman, suit of green, binding, bag and leggings of buff, hat of brown, powder flask and feather of gray; shield, frame of shaded yellow, top panel of orange, center panel of blue, lower panel of white, ox of red brown, grass and corn of green, wheat and branches underfoot of yellow, heraldic wreath to be blue and silver (twisted); ship under full sail to have a dark hull and white sails; date, December 7, 1787, to be white; cord and tassels to be blue and gold.|$|E
40|$|There {{are many}} ways to specify color and color difference. Color imaging {{scientists}} and engineers describe color using precise, numeric color specifications. Such color specifications are often based on the color matching behavior of a standard human observer and are referred to as device-independent <b>colorimetric</b> <b>specifications...</b>|$|E
40|$|AbstractA cone {{chromaticity}} space, a transform of a <b>colorimetric</b> <b>specification</b> {{system into}} coordinates that represent cone excitations, {{does not provide}} color appearance information. Boynton and Olson (Color Research and Application 12, 94 – 105, 1987) gathered color naming for the 424 Optical Society of America Uniform Color Scales (OSA-UCS) color samples. Here, a computational algorithm was developed that converts OSA-UCS sample values into L, M, S cone excitations based on the 1964 CIE 10 ° Standard Observer. This {{makes it possible to}} plot the cone chromaticities associated with the eight color names used by Boynton and Olsen’s observers to describe the non-dark appearing colors...|$|R
40|$|Except for linear devices like CRTs, color transformations from <b>colorimetric</b> <b>specifications</b> to device {{coordinates}} {{are mostly}} obtained by measuring {{a set of}} samples, inverting the table, and looking up values in the table (including interpolation), and mapping the gamut from input to output device. The accuracy of a transformation is determined by reproducing {{a second set of}} samples and measuring the reproduction errors. Accuracy as the average predicted perceptual error is then used as a metric for quality. Accuracy and precision are important metrics in commercial print because a print service provider can charge a higher price for more accurate color, or can widen his tolerances when customers prefer cheap prints. The disadvantage of determining tolerances through averaging perceptual errors is that the colors in the sample sets are independent and this is not necessarily a good correlate of print quality as determined through psychophysics studies. Indeed, images consist of color palettes and the main quality factor is not color fidelity but color integrity. For example, if the divergence of the field of error vectors is zero, color constancy is likely to take over and humans will perceive the color reproduction as being of good quality, even if the average error is relatively large. However, if the errors are small but in random directions, the perceived image quality is poor because the relation among colors is altered. We propose a standard practice to determine tolerance based on the Farnsworth-Munsell 100 -hue test (FM- 100) fo...|$|E
40|$|With {{the advent}} of the {{spectrophotometer}} {{as an alternative to the}} densitometer for pressroom applications, it becomes desirable to use a single three-color overprint halftone gray patch for controlling color on the press. As a consequence, the need for new specifications in colorimetric units, rather than SID and dot gain units, arises. The purpose of this study was to conduct a mathematical conversion of the traditional SID and dot gain specifications into the <b>colorimetric</b> <b>specifications,</b> in terms of the CIELAB coordinates. The FIPP dot gain and SID specifications were applied to the gray patch contained in the Gretag CMS 3 color control bar. This gray comprises an overprint of 75 % cyan, 62 % magenta, and 60 % yellow. Applying all possible SID and dot gain tolerances to this gray results in overall 225 three-color overprint grays. By employing computer programs containing the GRL Trapping Model, (2) the GRL Dot Gain Model, and (3) the Yule-Nielsen modified Spectral Neugebauer Model, the CIELAB coordinates of the 225 grays were predicted without taking actual spectrophotometric measurements on press sheets. The CIELAB coordinates of these grays were then plotted in the three-dimensional L* a* b* space. The shape of the cluster of these 225 grays is nearly spherical. The largest deviation of one of XI these grays from the aim gray is 4. 7 AE*ak units. Varying any dot area by ± 2 % or changing any SID by ± 0. 1 causes a color deviation of less than 3 (delta) E*ab units...|$|E
