40|$|Virus and cells evolve during serial {{passage of}} cloned BHK- 21 cells {{persistently}} infected with {{foot-and-mouth disease virus}} (FMDV). These carrier cells, termed C 1 -BHK-Rc 1 (J. C. de la Torre, M. Dávila, F. Sobrino, J. Ortín, and E. Domingo, Virology 145 : 24 - 35, 1985), become constitutively resistant to the parental FMDV C-S 8 c 1. Curing of late-passage C 1 -BHK-Rc 1 cells of FMDV by ribavirin treatment (J. C. de la Torre, B. Alarcón, E. Martínez-Salas, L. Carrasco, and E. Domingo, J. Virol. 61 : 233 - 235, 1987) did not restore sensitivity to FMDV C-S 8 c 1. The resistance of C 1 -BHK-Rc 1 cells to FMDV C-S 8 c 1 was not due to an impairment of attachment, penetration, or uncoating of the particles but to some intracellular block {{that resulted in a}} 100 -fold decrease in the amount of FMDV RNA in the infected cells. FMDV R 59, the virus isolated from late-passage carrier cells, partly overcame the <b>cellular</b> <b>block</b> and was more cytolytic than FMDV C-S 8 c 1 for BHK- 21 cells. Sequencing of the VP 1 gene from nine viral clones from C 1 -BHK-Rc 1 cells showed genetic heterogeneity of 5 X 10 (- 4) substitutions per nucleotide. Mutations were sequentially fixed during persistence. In addition to resistance to FMDV C-S 8 c 1, C 1 -BHK-Rc 1 cells showed a characteristic round cell morphology, and compared with BHK- 21 cells, they grew faster in liquid culture, were less subject to contact inhibition of growth, and had an increased ability to form colonies in semisolid agar. Reconstitution of a persistent infection was readily attained with late-passage C 1 -BHK-Rc 1 cells and FMDV C-S 8 c 1 or FMDV R 59. The results suggest that coevolution of BHK- 21 cells and FMDV contributes to the maintenance of persistence in cell culture...|$|E
40|$|Human Eukaryotic {{translation}} {{initiation factor}} 5 A 2 (eIF 5 A 2), a novel oncogene located at chromosome 3 q 26. 2, is frequently up-regulated in many human solid tumors including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It {{has been reported}} that EIF 5 A 2 can promote cell growth in hypoxia condition, in which the metabolism pathways (e. g. glucose metabolism) are disordered, suggesting that EIF 5 A 2 may {{play a crucial role in}} regulating cancer cell metabolic activities. The aim of this study is to find out how EIF 5 A 2 promotes cancer cell growth and proliferation from the perspective of cellular metabolism. Previous studies have shown that the aberrant metabolic alterations play a crucial role in the initiation and progression of HCC. The poor vascularization in tumor tissues leads to nutrient deprivation and limited oxygen supply, which attenuates cell proliferation. However, tumor cells could adapt the environmental stress via altered metabolic pathways. For example, tumor cells are inclined to utilize glucose through glycolysis rather than tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) for energy generation and metabolite production, in despite of high oxygen availability, which is termed as Warburg Effect. In this study, the functional study and metabolic analysis were performed on liver cell line models with EIF 5 A 2 overexpression or knockdown. It was observed that overexpression of EIF 5 A 2 accelerated cell growth rate under normoxic condition, and high EIF 5 A 2 expression level enabled the cells to survive better in the absence of oxygen. The cell cycle analysis indicated that overexpression of EIF 5 A 2 accelerated the G 2 entry. With the application of non-targeted metabolic analysis and metabolite detection assays, it was found that the glucose utilization and lipogenesis rates in EIF 5 A 2 -overexpressing cells increased significantly both under normoxic and hypoxic condition. The high rates of glucose uptake and lactate secretion in EIF 5 A 2 -overexpressing cells revealed the turnover from TCA cycle to aerobic glycolysis. In addition, the increased Glycerophospholipids in cells, an important component of <b>cellular</b> <b>block</b> building, was a solid proof that EIF 5 A 2 promoted cell proliferation. Furthermore, a series of key enzymes in both glycolysis and de novo lipid biosynthesis were screened using qPCR and Western Blot analysis. The results showed that EIF 5 A 2 up-regulated several key enzymes in glycolysis process such as Glucose Transporter type 1 and 2 (GLUT 1 / 2), Hexokinase 1 and 2 (HK 1 / 2), Glyceraldehyde 3 -phoshpate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), pyruvate kinase muscle type (PKM), and Lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA). In addition, EIF 5 A 2 reprogrammed fatty acid de novo biosynthesis and lipogenesis by up-regulating fatty acid synthase (FASN) and cytosolic acetyl-CoA synthetase 2 (ACSS 2). Conversely, these enzymes mentioned above were all down-regulated in cells transduced with shRNAs targeted at EIF 5 A 2. In summary, this study provided evidence that EIF 5 A 2 could promote cell growth and proliferation in liver cell lines through reprogramming cellular metabolism, including glucose metabolism and fatty aid biosynthesis. Due to the great diversity of cancer cells, our perspective in this study may be not universal, but could provide a framework about the metabolic function of EIF 5 A 2 in HCC, as well as a novel insight for how to manipulate cancer cell metabolism. published_or_final_versionClinical OncologyDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E

40|$|The authors {{argue that}} bearing walls of {{buildings}} that {{have up to}} four stories can be designed and made of small <b>cellular</b> concrete <b>blocks.</b> These walls demonstrate advantages specific to solid masonry walls. For example, they have high water vapor permeability. Whenever the internal humidity increases, half of the moisture content can be extracted from the masonry due to the water vapour permeability of external walls, while {{the other half of}} the moisture content can go back into the room (due to the sorption capacity of the wall material). Furthermore, any lower density wall material has smaller heat absorption capacity to ensure a comfortable environment. The application of small <b>cellular</b> concrete <b>blocks</b> as a wall material is an alternative to thoroughly insulated multi-layer external walls.

Different types of blocks are widely used as a construction material for walls, such us earth blocks, adobe, concrete hollow <b>blocks,</b> <b>cellular</b> <b>blocks,</b> bricks, because of their low price and easy installation.

Specifically, let the two automata use the same lattice of cells, but let each state of the conventional automaton specify {{the state of the}} block automaton, the phase of its partition shifting pattern, and the position of the cell within its block. For instance, with the Margolus neighborhood, this would increase the number of states by a factor of eight: there are four possible positions that a cell may take in its [...] block, and two phases to the partition. Additionally, let the neighborhood of the conventional automaton be the union of the blocks containing the given cell in the <b>block</b> <b>cellular</b> automaton.
