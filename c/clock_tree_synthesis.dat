40|$|Physical routability {{constraints}} such {{as legal}} location checking and excessive number of vias are usually ignored {{in most of}} the <b>clock</b> <b>tree</b> algorithms. These Constraints could make an abstract <b>clock</b> <b>tree</b> difficult to route in practice and cause important manufacturability and reliability challenges. Therefore the final <b>clock</b> <b>tree</b> layout specifications can be seriously deviated from the expected ones. Vias have major impact on circuit reliability and manufacturing yield. The variability in via resistance is becoming an increasing concern in nanotechnologies. In this thesis a practical frame work is proposed to construct the <b>clock</b> <b>tree</b> network under via constraint. We propose an algorithm that minimizes the number of bends that is closely related to the number of vias. The proposed algorithm is able to construct a zero skew <b>clock</b> <b>tree</b> with at most one bend branch merging. By performing simultaneous wire sizing and <b>clock</b> <b>tree</b> construction, the algorithm effectively reduces the number of bends at the expense of a small increase in capacitance. Furthermore, the number of vias is also controlled by considering a pre-specified pattern to route the internal <b>clock</b> <b>tree</b> edges. The impact of the pattern routing is taken into account in the early clock distribution design phase. We introduce a probabilistic routing demand estimation method to integrate the expected routing demand of the clock net with other <b>clock</b> <b>tree</b> optimization metrics. A new demand driven cost function is exploited in network topology generation as well as branch point embedding stages of a zero skew <b>clock</b> <b>tree</b> algorithm {{to reduce the number of}} vias.

Moreover, the clock pins {{are connected to}} the <b>clock</b> <b>trees</b> via programmable switches.

In this paper we present an algorithm for selecting logic modules used for circuit placement such that the clock skew is minimized. The algorithm can be applied to a variety of <b>clock</b> <b>tree</b> architectures, including those used in major commercial FPGAs. Furthermore, the algorithm can be extended to handle bu ered <b>clock</b> <b>trees</b> and multi-phase <b>clock</b> <b>trees.</b> Experimental results show that the algorithm can reduce clock skews signi cantly as compared with the traditional placement algorithms which do not consider clock skew minimization. ...|$|R

40|$|This work tackles {{a problem}} of clock power {{minimization}} within a skew constraint under supply voltage variation. This problem is defined in the ISPD 2010 benchmark. Unlike mesh and cross link that reduce clock skew uncertainty by multiple driving paths, our focus is on controlling skew uncertainty {{in the structure of}} the tree. We observe that slow slew amplifies supply voltage variation, which induces larger path delay variation and skew uncertainty. To obtain the optimality, we formulate a symmetric <b>clock</b> <b>tree</b> <b>synthesis</b> as a mathematical programming problem in which the slew effect is considered by an NLDM-like cell delay variation model. A symmetry-to-asymmetry tree transformation is proposed to further reduce wire loading. Experimental results show that the proposed four methods save up to 20 % of clock tree capacitance loading.

40|$|<b>Clock</b> <b>tree</b> <b>synthesis</b> {{plays an}} {{important}} role on the total performance of chip. Gated clock tree is an effective approach to reduce the dynamic power usage. In this paper, two novel gated clock tree synthesizers, power-aware clock tree synthesizer (PACTS) and power- and slew-aware clock tree synthesizer (PSACTS), are proposed with zero skew achieved based on Elmore RC model. In PACTS, the topology of the clock tree is constructed with simultaneous buffer/gate insertion, which reduces the switched capacitance. In PSACTS, a more practical clock slew constraint is applied. Compared to previous works, <b>clock</b> <b>tree</b> <b>synthesis</b> is done first and followed by the insertions of clock gates. The clock slew changes a lot after the insertions of clock gates in real cases. In our work, the clock tree is constructed simultaneously with the insertions of clock gates. This ensures the limitation of the clock slew can be strictly satisfied while the limitation of the clock slew is always applied in the real design. The experimental results show that the power cost of our work is smaller and the runtime is reduced. The slew rate constraint is satisfied with a small clock skew from SPICE estimation. Generally, our work has better performance, improved efficiency and is more practical to be applied in the industry. Department of Electronic and Information Engineerin...|$|E
