In 2013, 49 surface water samples from 13 selected sampling sites along the Basaseachi waterfall and its main rivers, were collected during the spring, summer, autumn, and winter seasons. Fecal and total <b>coliform</b> <b>counts</b> were determined using standard methods; the AutoScan- 4 system was used for identification of isolates and the antibiotic resistance profile by challenging each organism using 21 antibiotics. Significant differences among seasons were detected, where autumn samples resulted in the highest total (p < 0. 05) and fecal (p < 0. 001) <b>coliform</b> <b>counts,</b> whereas the lowest total <b>coliform</b> <b>counts</b> were recorded in spring. Significant differences between sampling sites were observed, where samples from sites 6, 8, and 11 had the highest total <b>coliform</b> <b>counts</b> (p < 0. 009), whereas samples from site 9 exhibited the lowest one. From the microbiological analysis, 33 bacterial isolates from 13 different sites and four sampling seasons were selected; 53 % of isolates were resistant to at least one antibiotic, and 15 % exhibited a multidrug resistance (MDB) phenotype. MDB were identified as Klebsiella oxytoca (two out of four identified isolates), Escherichia coli (2 / 7), and Enterobacter cloacae (1 / 3). In addition, some water-borne microorganisms exhibited resistance to cefazoline, cefuroxime, ampicillin, and ampicillin-sulbactam.

The overall mean counts of vegetables were 4. 0 x 10 3 cfu g - 1; 8. 1 x 10 2 cfu g - 1; 2. 0 x 10 2 cfu g - 1; 3. 5 x 10 2 cfu g - 1 for total bacteria, <b>coliform</b> <b>counts,</b> faecal <b>coliform</b> <b>counts</b> and yeast counts, respectively. The rate of internalisation of coliforms in vegetables irrigated with stream/well water was 2. 7 times higher than those irrigated with pipe water. The mean <b>coliform</b> <b>counts</b> (4. 7 x 10 7 cfu g - 1) and faecal <b>coliform</b> <b>counts</b> (1. 8 x 10 6 cfu g - 1) of soil samples {{were similar to those}} of stream water suggesting both sources exerted similar contamination rates on the vegetables. Generally, there were no significant variations between the rates of internalisation of microbes at the market and farm levels at p< 05, indicating that internalisation of microbes in the vegetables mainly occurred at the farm level. The study has shown that microbial contamination of vegetables in Ghana {{is not limited to the}} external surface, but internal vegetable parts could harbour high microbial loads and pose risk to consumers. Safety practices associated with the commodity should therefore not be limited to external washing only. There is the additional need of heating vegetables to eliminate microbes both externally and internally before consumption...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate physicochemical and microbiological quality of raw, pasteurized and UHT milks in Shahrekord (Iran) in the spring 2005. All types of milk samples were collected from different part of the city were selected and in three consequent periods. The physicochemical parameters including fat, protein, temperature, Titrable Acidity (TA), Solid Not Fat (SNF) and Specific Gravity (SG) were determined. Additionally, the microbiological evaluations were based on the total bacterial count, total <b>coliform</b> <b>count</b> and Escherichia coli (E. coli). The results (mean values of 81 measurements) for raw milk samples showed fat content 2. 6, protein 3. 5, T 18 Â°C, TA 0. 17, SNF 7. 71 and SG 1. 030 and total bacterial count 13 x 10 6 cfu mL - 1, total <b>coliform</b> <b>count</b> 1300 cfu mL - 1 and E. coli positive. Those values for the pasteurized milks were the fat content 2, protein 3. 5, T 15 Â°C, TA 0. 16, SNF 7. 5 and SG 1. 033 and total bacterial count 71 x 10 4 cfu mL - 1, total <b>coliform</b> <b>count</b> 800 cfu mL - 1 and E. coli positive. Furthermore, the values of UHT milks were the fat content 2. 8, protein 3. 1, T 19 Â°C, TA 0. 15, SNF 8. 3, SG 1. 029, total bacterial count 71 cfu mL - 1, total <b>coliform</b> <b>count</b> 9 cfu mL - 1 and E. coli negative. Statistical analysis of data revealed that there is significant difference between results of different shops at the level of p< 0. 01 which implies the contamination of raw and pasteurized milk is above standards...|$|E
40|$|As {{there were}} massive fish kills in Lake Bafa {{which is a}} lagoon {{situated}} in Southwestern Turkey in October, 2006, water and fish samples {{were taken from the}} region. Water samples were analysed physicochemically, toxicologically and microbiologically and fish samples were subjected to toxicological analysis. The analyses of lake water revealed on oxygen value of approximately 5. 0 mg/L, salinity 16. 2, nitrogen from ammonia 0. 1 mg/L, nitrogen nitrite 0. 013 mg/L, and total organic carbon 13 mg/L. Total <b>coliform</b> <b>count</b> was 1100 MPN/ 100 ml and faecal <b>coliform</b> <b>count</b> was 28 MPN/ 100 ml. There was no detection of any pesticide residues in fish and water samples. Massive fish kills are thought to be due to the decrease in water quality...|$|E
40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to assess how {{different}} bacterial groups in bulk milk are related to bulk milk somatic cell count (SCC), bulk milk total bacterial count (TBC), and bulk milk standard plate count (SPC) and to measure the repeatability of bulk milk culturing. On 53 Dutch dairy goat farms, 3 bulk milk samples were collected at intervals of 2 wk. The samples were cultured for SPC, <b>coliform</b> <b>count,</b> and staphylococcal count and for the presence of Staphylococcus aureus. Furthermore, SCC (Fossomatic 5000, Foss, Hillerød, Denmark) and TBC (BactoScan FC 150, Foss) were measured. Staphylococcal count was correlated to SCC (r= 0. 40), TBC (r= 0. 51), and SPC (r= 0. 53). <b>Coliform</b> <b>count</b> was correlated to TBC (r= 0. 33), but not to any of the other variables. Staphylococcus aureus did not correlate to SCC. The contribution of the staphylococcal count to the SPC was 31 %, whereas the <b>coliform</b> <b>count</b> comprised only 1 % of the SPC. The agreement of the repeated measurements was low. This study indicates that staphylococci in goat bulk milk are related to SCC and make a significant contribution to SPC. Because of the high variation in bacterial counts, repeated sampling is necessary to draw valid conclusions from bulk milk culturing...|$|E
40|$|Samples {{of protein}} feed {{supplements}} produced by rendering plants were examined for salmonellae, total aerobic bacterial <b>counts,</b> <b>coliform</b> <b>counts,</b> and enterococci. Isolations of salmonellae were more frequent from products with high counts; however, 6 % {{of the samples}} with total counts of less than 1, 000 per gram and 14 % of the samples with <b>coliform</b> <b>counts</b> of less than 1 per gram contained salmonellae. Serotypes of Escherichia coli which {{have been associated with}} disease in domestic animals and poultry were also isolated from products. Although the distribution of serotypes of salmonellae isolated from environmental swabs and flies was similar to that isolated from products, the isolation of several serotypes from flies which had not been isolated in plants suggested that flies may be a potential source of contamination...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper had}} been {{presented}} for promotion {{at the university}} of Khartoum. To get the full text please contact the other at Ibtisammohamed@hotmail. comThe processed cheese used during the present study was made from white Sudanese cheese with different ripening time (15 and 30 days) from milk with different fat present (2. 2 and 4. 4 %). At time of processing the processed cheese was packed into two types of packaging (glass and plastic) and stored at 4 °C for 3 months. The different fat level of milk showed significant differences (p 0. 05) with the different fat percent of the milk from which the processed cheese was made. The psychrophilic counts, total bacterial <b>counts,</b> <b>coliform</b> <b>counts</b> and yeast and molds counts showed significant differences (p< 0. 05) with different ripening time (15 and 30 days). Also the storage periods showed significant differences (p< 0. 05) with psychrophilic counts, total bacterial <b>counts,</b> <b>coliform</b> <b>counts</b> and yeast and molds counts. Similarly the different types of packaging (plastic and glass) showed significant differences (p< 0. 05) with psychrophilic <b>counts,</b> <b>coliform</b> <b>counts</b> and yeast and molds counts. However total bacterial counts showed non significant differences (p< 0. 05) with the different types of packaging of the processed cheese. Hence, the present study concluded that if the Sudanese white cheese could be further reprocessed the hygienic quality and the shelf life would improve...|$|R
