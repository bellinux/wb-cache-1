40|$|The {{additivity}} of nonsimultaneous masking {{can be used}} as {{a measure}} of nonlinearity in the auditory system. For example, two equally effective forward maskers should produce 3 dB of additional masking when they are combined, assuming linearity with respect to intensity. A combined effect greater than this (excess masking) indicates compression. In the present experiments, the signal was a 10 -ms pure tone presented 20 ms after a 200 -ms narrowband noise masker and/or immediately after a 20 -ms narrowband noise masker. The signal frequency was 250, 500, or 4000 Hz. The signal threshold produced by combining two equally effective maskers was measured. At all three frequencies, little excess masking was observed for a signal 10 dB above absolute threshold, indicating linear additivity (no compression). At signal levels 30 dB above absolute threshold, excess masking was observed at all three frequencies. The estimated <b>compression</b> <b>exponents</b> were 0. 29 at 250 Hz, 0. 34 at 500 Hz, and 0. 17 at 4000 Hz.

40|$|The conjugacy length {{function}} of a group Γ determines, for a given a pair of conjugate elements u, v ∈ Γ, an upper bound for the shortest γ in Γ such that uγ = γv, relative to the lengths of u and v. This thesis focuses on estimating the conjugacy length function in certain finitely generated groups. We first look at a collection of solvable groups. We see how the lamplighter groups have a linear conjugacy length function; we find a cubic upper bound for free solvable groups; for solvable Baumslag [...] Solitar groups it is linear, while for a larger family of abelian-by-cyclic groups we get either a linear or exponential upper bound; also we show that for certain polycyclic metabelian groups it is at most exponential. We also investigate how taking a wreath product effects conjugacy length, {{as well as other}} group extensions. The Magnus embedding is an important tool in the study of free solvable groups. It embeds a free solvable group into a wreath product of a free abelian group and a free solvable group of shorter derived length. Within this thesis we show that the Magnus embedding is a quasi-isometric embedding. This result is not only used for obtaining an upper bound on the conjugacy length {{function of}} free solvable groups, but also for giving a lower bound for their L p <b>compression</b> <b>exponents.</b> Conjugacy length is also studied between certain types of elements in lattices of higher-rank semisimple real Lie groups.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of {{quantization}} {{on the performance of}} the Neyman-Pearson test. It is assumed that a sensing unit observes samples of a correlated stationary ergodic multivariate process. Each sample is passed through an N-point quantizer and transmitted to a decision device which performs a binary hypothesis test. For any false alarm level, it is shown that the miss probability of the Neyman-Pearson test converges to zero exponentially as the number of samples tends to infinity, assuming that the observed process satisfies certain mixing conditions. The main contribution {{of this paper is to}} provide a compact closed-form expression of the error exponent in the high-rate regime i. e., when the number N of quantization levels tends to infinity, generalizing previous results of Gupta and Hero to the case of non-independent observations. If d represents the dimension of one sample, it is proved that the error exponent converges at rate N 2 /d to the one obtained in the absence of quantization. As an application, relevant high-rate quantization strategies which lead to a large error exponent are determined. Numerical results indicate that the proposed quantization rule can yield better performance than existing ones in terms of detection error.

The absolute cylinder pressure {{is the result of}} an exponent of the dynamic <b>compression</b> ratio.

For example, if the static compression ratio is 10:1, and the dynamic compression ratio is 7.5:1, a useful value for cylinder pressure would be (7.5)^1.3 × atmospheric pressure, or 13.7 bar.

The shocklet and shock wave are caused by the solenoidal and compressive modes of driven forces, respectively. Hereafter, the related two flows are called as SFT and CFT, respectively. It shows that in SFT the temperature spectrum follows the k^- 5 / 3 power law, and the temperature field has "ramp-cliff" structures. By contrast, in CFT the temperature spectrum obeys the k^- 2 power law, and the temperature field is dominated by large-scale rarefaction and <b>compression.</b> The power-law <b>exponents</b> for the p. d. f. of large negative dilatation are - 2. 5 in SFT and - 3. 5 in CFT, close to theoretical values. For the isentropic assumption of thermodynamic variables, the derivation in SFT grows with the turbulent Mach number (Mt), and for same Mt, the variables in CFT are more anisentropic. The angle statistics shows that the temperature gradient in CFT is preferentially perpendicular to the anisotropic strain rate tensor. It tends to be parallel with the first eigenvector and be orthogonal {{with the other two}} eigenvectors. For the cascade of temperature, the temperature variance is increased by the viscous dissipation and the pressure-dilatation, but is decreased by the SGS temperature flux. The statistics of pressure-dilatation proves that the negligible contribution of pressure-dilatation at small scales is due to the cancelations of high values between rarefaction and compression regions. The strongly positive skewness of the p. d. f. s of pressure-dilatation implies that the conversion from kinetic to internal energy through compression is more intense than the opposite process through rarefaction. Furthermore, in SFT the fluctuations of pressure-dilatation approximately follow the Zeman model...|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we {{build on the}} theory {{concerning}} the metric geometry of relatively hyperbolic and mapping class groups, especially {{with respect to the}} difficulty of embedding such groups into Banach spaces. In Chapter 3 (joint with Alessandro Sisto) we construct simple embeddings of closed graph manifold groups into a product of three metric trees, answering positively a conjecture of Smirnov concerning the Assouad-Nagata dimension of such spaces. Consequently, we obtain optimal embeddings of such spaces into certain Banach spaces. The ideas here have been extended to other closed three-manifolds and to higher dimensional analogues of graph manifolds. In Chapter 4 we give an explicit method of embedding relatively hyperbolic groups into certain Banach spaces, which yields optimal bounds on the <b>compression</b> <b>exponent</b> of such groups relative to their peripheral subgroups. From this we deduce that the fundamental group of every closed three-manifold has Hilbert <b>compression</b> <b>exponent</b> one. In Chapter 5 we prove that relatively hyperbolic spaces with a tree-graded quasi-isometry representative can be characterised by a relative version of Manning's bottleneck property. This applies to the Bestvina-Bromberg-Fujiwara quasi-trees of spaces, yielding an embedding of each mapping class group of a closed surface into a finite product of simplicial trees. From this we obtain explicit embeddings of mapping class groups into certain Banach spaces and deduce that these groups have finite Assouad-Nagata dimension.

By varying masker frequency it is possible to estimate off-frequency compression. The maskers were 500 -Hz-wide bands of noise, and the signal was a brief pure tone. Compression at different levels was estimated using different overall signal levels, or different masker-signal intervals.

Autoignition of the combustible mixture can occur only upon reaching the characteristic self-ignition temperature Tz. It should take place during (near end) the load compression.

However, it is quite cumbersome especially in case of frequent changes of engine load (there are also difficulties with the precise advance angle adjusting of fuel mixture ignition). According to our conception, the other method of autoignition adjustment can be successfully applied.

The measurements were taken at a signal frequency of 2 kHz and compared with measurements of click-evoked OAE suppression. The elicitor was a broadband noise, set to a sound pressure level of 54 dB to avoid triggering the middle ear muscle reflex.

The upward spread of simultaneous masking may arise from a combination of excitatory and suppressive effects. In this study, growth of masking functions were obtained for a 4 -kHz signal masked by an on-frequency (4  kHz) or off-frequency (2. 4  kHz), simultaneous or forward masker, {{in the presence of a}} notched noise with a center frequency of 4  kHz presented to restrict off-frequency listening. Compression was estimated from the slopes of the off-frequency growth of masking functions. Suppression was estimated by comparing the off-frequency simultaneous- and forward-masked growth of masking functions. Results showed that, for mid-level signals (35 – 60  dB SPL), the <b>compression</b> <b>exponent</b> estimated from simultaneous and forward masking averaged 0. 31 and 0. 26, respectively. The maximum amount of suppression (defined as the decrease in the basilar-membrane response to the signal) was variable, ranging from about 6 to 17  dB across subjects. Despite the substantial reduction in the response to the signal, the results suggest that suppression has a minimal effect on the slope of the masking function at mid levels. Rather, upward spread of masking seems to be mainly determined by the compressive basilar-membrane response to the signal in relation to the linear response to the lower-frequency masker...|$|E
