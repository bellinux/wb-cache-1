25|$|I owe {{so much to}} Brett, and teamTBB. It was Brett that {{advised me}} to turn pro, {{he told me to}} do an Ironman and he trained me to win two World Ironman Championships. Not only that, the Team {{framework}} enabled me to train with some of the best athletes in the world; to grow and develop as a person and to learn some incredibly important lessons. With the Team I reached heights that I never thought possible, and for that I am truly grateful. teamTBB is focused on helping 'development athletes' who might otherwise not have the opportunity to succeed in professional triathlon. I no longer fit into their framework, and hence the time has <b>come</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to move on.|$|E
2500|$|Peter {{promises}} {{to return for}} Wendy every spring. The {{end of the play}} finds Wendy looking out through the window and saying into space, [...] "You won't forget to <b>come</b> <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> Peter? Please, please don't forget." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 10 July 2012, Taibu called time on {{his career}} aged 29. He said he would only do work for the church. Taibu told Zimeye: “I just feel that my true calling now lies in doing the Lord’s work, and {{although}} I am fortunate and proud to have played for my country, the time has <b>come</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to put my entire focus on {{that part of my}} life.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, indeed?" [...] {{said the}} old gentleman. [...] "Your name is George? Then I am here as soon as you, you see. You <b>came</b> <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> no doubt?" ...|$|R
60|$|Hardly had I {{got rid of}} my charge {{than the}} bull <b>came</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> again. The trick I had played on him only served to {{increase}} his rage, and he snorted loudly.|$|R
60|$|Following that eventful {{evening at}} the theatre, <b>came</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> seven weeks as bare as seven sheets of blank paper: no word was written on one of them; not a visit, not a token.|$|R
2500|$|Following the ballot, Beazley {{said of his}} {{political}} future, [...] "For me to do anything further in the Australian Labor Party I would say is Lazarus with a quadruple bypass. So the time has <b>come</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to move on but when that gets properly formalised I will let you know." [...] It was also revealed that his brother David {{had died of a}} severe heart attack at age 53, shortly before the vote took place.|$|E
2500|$|Youzhny {{resigned}} from the Russian Davis Cup team in February 2011, stating, [...] "I think the time has <b>come</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> step aside and give younger players a chance". He added, [...] "Now, I want to {{devote more time to}} my family and concentrate on individual tournaments". However, he competed at the 2011 Davis Cup tie with Brazil, stating that [...] ""We're in a tough situation right now and I thought it was my duty to help the team. Therefore, I've made myself available for that tie." [...] Youzhny won both of his rubbers, the first against Ricardo Mello, while he took over five hours to defeat Thomaz Bellucci, 14–12 in the fifth set. In his last Davis Cup match so far, in 2012, Youzhny partnered with Nikolay Davydenko to beat Austria doubles team Oliver Marach and Alexander Peya.|$|E
2500|$|Liu Ye, {{a friend}} of Lu Su, once {{wrote a letter to}} him: [...] "Now, warlords and heroes have emerged all over the Empire. I believe the time has <b>come</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to put my talents to good use. I am in a rush to fetch my mother but I will be {{dropping}} by Dongcheng County for a while. I heard that recently, someone called Zheng Bao (鄭寶) has rallied thousands of followers in Chaohu and the lands under their control are very fertile. Many people in Lujiang Commandery are planning to join him after hearing about him – not to mention myself. I observe his situation and see that he is still gathering followers. You should act fast and not miss this opportunity." [...] Lu Su agreed with what Liu Ye said. After his grandmother's funeral, Lu Su returned to Qu'e County and made plans to leave Jiangdong and head north to join Zheng Bao. However, he found out that Zhou Yu had fetched his mother to Wu Commandery (吳郡; around present-day Suzhou, Jiangsu) so he went to Wu Commandery to speak to Zhou Yu.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh no, indeed!" [...] she answered. [...] "The young gentlemen used to {{find out}} whether I was going, and <b>came</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> with a hack, and generally, if the weather was good, we walked home." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, indeed?" [...] {{said the}} old gentleman. [...] "Then it was your young man who <b>came</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> I am a {{physician}} and was requested--five minutes ago--to come and visit a sick man at George's Shooting Gallery." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{went down}} town again after that," [...] said Sheen, [...] "and met the same fellows who were {{fighting}} Linton and the others. They <b>came</b> <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> and I was getting awfully mauled when Joe Bevan turned up." ...|$|R
60|$|Miss N. I {{was looking}} {{to see if the}} {{carriage}} had <b>come</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> It is time that I return home.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why didn't you <b>come</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> yesterday, {{instead of}} waking me {{up out of}} a sound sleep? Here it is two o'clock! So spat--warum, eh?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mother, somehow I {{thought you}} had died. I must have dreamed it. I am very happy; but tell me, did a message <b>come</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to-day?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{sent the}} flowers, he <b>came</b> <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> and, {{on the way}} home, showed me how wrong I had been to doubt him for an hour. Don't ask me to tell that part, but be sure I was the happiest {{creature}} in the world then." ...|$|R
60|$|MRS. G. I {{remember}} now. Mrs. Scargill {{was talking}} about her at the Duffins' tennis, before you <b>came</b> <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> on Tuesday. Captain Mafflin {{said she was a}} 'dear old woman.' Do you know, I think Mafflin is a very clumsy man with his feet.|$|R

6000|$|... "Nothing, nothing!" [...] {{answered}} Elinor, hastily. [...] "You paint my {{face with}} your own fantasies. Well, <b>come</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> tomorrow, and we will visit this wonderful artist." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You may {{say what}} you like," [...] Francie returned. [...] "It will be immense fun {{to be in the}} newspapers. <b>Come</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> at this hour day after to-morrow." ...|$|E

60|$|When they <b>came</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> I turned cold {{with fear}} that Madonna was already taken, and, by {{contrast}} {{with such a}} fear as that, the reflection that he might carry out his threat to hang me from that black beam of his, faded into insignificant proportions.|$|R
6000|$|... "Upon my word, {{this is a}} most {{unpleasant}} young person," [...] Lord Arranmore said. [...] "Brooks, do see her off {{the premises}} before she changes her mind and <b>comes</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> again. You have, I hope, been entertained, ladies," [...] he added, turning to Sybil and Lady Caroom.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sir George {{would have}} said that he had <b>come</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> alone. Indeed you are but a poor courtier beside him. But is it true, Nigel, that you go to France?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{you should}} do better. Merci! There's a cab: {{some of them have}} <b>come</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> I must go," [...] she added, {{listening}} for a sound that reached her from the road.|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{much larger}} share than mine," [...] said Alan, smiling. [...] "If Pat had not <b>come</b> <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> I {{would not have}} known of your danger. What a {{magnificent}} fellow he is!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'He's a game cove, too, and he <b>came</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> like a bantam,' {{said the}} other, still rubbing his knee. 'I got my old {{left-right}} in, {{and he went}} over {{as if he had}} been pole-axed. It wasn't my fault, mounseer. I told you you'd get pepper if you went on.' ...|$|R
60|$|They <b>came</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> Ungraciously and ungently, with {{blow and}} curse, they haled me forth, and I faced Captain Jamie and Warden Atherton, {{themselves}} arrayed {{with the strength}} {{of half a dozen}} state-bought, tax-paid brutes of guards who lingered in the room to do any bidding. But they were not needed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Wot 'appened, sir!" [...] wailed Tippet. [...] "Oh, Gord, sir! [...] Hit came back. Hit <b>came</b> <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> sir.

6000|$|... "Unluckily I {{have sent}} the ponies home, {{and told the}} close {{carriage}} to <b>come</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> at nine. It was all settled, and I don't want to alarm Lord Keith by coming home too soon." ...|$|E
60|$|They {{immediately}} {{fell upon}} me with ill language and oaths, {{asked me what}} I did out of my grave {{at such a time}} when so many honester men were carried into the churchyard, and why I was not at home saying my prayers against the dead-cart <b>came</b> <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> and the like.|$|R
60|$|The {{reply to}} my request was a {{summons to appear}} before the officer to whom I had {{addressed}} my appeal. A sergeant <b>came</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> along with the interpreter, and I managed to obtain his permission to let Victory accompany me--I had never left her alone with the prisoners since we had been captured.|$|R
60|$|Trick. When I saw you <b>came</b> not <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> I was loth to be {{long without}} you.|$|R
