50|$|York {{groundsel}} has showy flower-heads {{especially when}} compared to its <b>Common</b> <b>ragwort</b> parent. The flower-head, found at {{the tips of the}} plants (apical) appearing in clusters (an inflorescence) usually consists of three to seven florets in a grouped corymb; at first dense and leafy but eventually less dense with peduncles 5 to 20 millimeters (0.2 to 0.8 in) which get longer when fruiting (up to 25 mm (1 in)). The flower-head is broadly cylindrical 10×4 millimeters (0.4×0.16 in), becoming slightly bell shaped) when the bright yellow ray florets open. Involucral bracts sparse (4-8), elongated (3.5 - 4 mm), usually without black tips. The floret ligules are narrow and long 5 to 7 millimeters (0.2 to 0.24 in) long and 1.5 millimeters (0.06 in) wide), occasionally becoming revolute. Like other Senecios, the 10-30 papilla occur stigmatically into pericarp; each usually with four-pored pollen, the grains in polar view 30-35 micrometers when fully expanded.|$|E
40|$|In Northern Germany, <b>common</b> <b>ragwort</b> (Senecio jacobaea) is {{developing}} into a serious pest weed {{due to its}} increasing abundance on grassland and its toxicity for livestock. Between 2009 and 2011, the potential of chemical control of <b>common</b> <b>ragwort</b> was tested in seven field trials on light soils {{in the region of}} Hannover. The effectiveness of several herbicides for pastures had been tested at different times of the year (spring, early summer and autumn). The applied herbicides differed in their efficacy in dependence of the time of application and thus stage of development of the weed. Of those herbicides registered in Germany, only Simplex (Fluroxypyr + Aminopyralid) reached an efficacy of over 90 % using the maximum dose at the times of treatment. Additionally, Simplex showed the highest speed of action in comparison to other herbicides. Partial effects were observed after application of Banvel M (MCPA + Dicamba), U 46 M-Fluid (MCPA) + U 46 D-Fluid (2, 4 -D) or Garlon 4 (Triclopyr). These three herbicides were slightly more effective when applied in spring compared to application in early summer. Autumn application showed variable results of tested herbicides. Of those herbicides which are not registered in Germany, Legolas (2, 4 -D + 2, 4 -Dichlorprop-P + Dicamba) showed best results in controlling <b>common</b> <b>ragwort...</b>|$|E
