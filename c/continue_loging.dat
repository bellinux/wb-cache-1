50|$|Logging of the {{watershed}} has <b>continued.</b> <b>Logging</b> {{is the cause}} of the main environmental problem facing the river, excessive sedimentation.

50|$|In {{the spring}} of 1874, Kehl came to Chippewa Falls and began {{construction}} of the Glen Mills, {{one and a half}} miles from Chippewa Falls.

Pound & Co., from 1876 to 1878, when he purchased the business for himself. In 1875, he became interested in the First National Bank as stockholder and director, and became vice-president of the bank. He had extensive investments in real estate in Dane and Sauk counties, and was a director of the company that published the Chippewa County Independent.|$|R
5000|$|In 1983, the {{province}} of British Columbia issued a licence to Carrier Lumber to cut trees in lands that included remote central British Columbia territory which was claimed by the Xeni Gwet'in band of the Tsilhqot'in. The Tsilhqot'in are a semi-nomadic group of First Nations people {{who had lived in}} the area for centuries, managing these lands and repelling invaders. The Xeni Gwet'in blockaded the area, preventing Carrier from logging. The company conducted unsuccessful negotiations with the provincial government to <b>continue</b> <b>logging.</b> The Xeni Gwet'in filed suit seeking a court declaration that would prohibit Carrier Lumber's commercial logging operations in this area, and establish their claim for Aboriginal title to the land, which was part of their historic territory.|$|R

25|$|Along many rivers {{the arid}} {{conditions}} have caused courses to be dammed to provide water for irrigation. These dams have caused concerns {{along with those}} caused by other activities. The Yaqui has been dammed with three large reservoirs along its course. The Río Grande de Santiago has also been dammed including the Aguamilpa dam begun in 1991 and the El Cajón Dam (Mexico) upstream from it. To provide irrigation water for farming the dry basin, the Nazas river was dammed in the 1930s and 40s. This {{has led to the}} former drainage lakes in the area drying up, and soil depletion from the elimination of the river as a source of soil. Due to the <b>continued</b> <b>logging</b> in the area, erosion on the slopes of hillsides has increased.|$|R
50|$|Austene is {{reunited with}} her widowed father Arlen (Michael Beck) - once the town's deputy sheriff, but now its token drunk. Meanwhile, Thorne obtains {{a permit to}} <b>continue</b> <b>logging.</b> The Lords of the Tanglewood rally in {{response}} to this; they prank the loggers with numerous boobytraps, impeding Thorne's efforts to chop down the forest. They also play rock music on a ghetto-blaster, which causes the loggers to dance around idiotically. (One of them even air guitars with a chainsaw!) Finally, McKenna appears before Thorne and intimidates him by turning into a bear; the terrified villain calls off the deforestation, and confesses all of his wrongdoing to the authorities. With their forest saved, the townspeople rebuild the kids' treehouse...while Austene sees McKenna's spirit reunited with that of his Native American wife.|$|R

50|$|The Court {{government}} was comfortably re-elected in 1996. The Liberals actually won {{a majority in}} their own right (29 seats out of 57) for the first time ever, but Court opted to retain the coalition with the Nationals. However, Court's popularity suffered in his second term as Premier due to scandals, including deals made {{between the government and the}} Premier's brother, Ken Court, as well as the finance broking scandal, where many elderly investors lost their savings and an inquiry found the Government ineffective and inefficient in managing the industry. Also important was the <b>continued</b> <b>logging</b> of old growth forests in the South West of Western Australia. A rejuvenated Labor Party, led since 1996 by Dr Geoff Gallop, won the state election on 10 February 2001 on a 13-seat, 7-point swing—a shift in voter sympathies not seen since the 1911 state election.|$|R

40|$|<b>Continuing</b> <b>logging</b> in {{the tropics}} is making the {{conservation}} of remaining forests increasingly difficult. Furthermore, there are increasing evidences that recruitment of trees might be endangered through events such as climate change, enhanced seed predation or fragmentation. In this study we assess various impacts of tree harvesting in a Dipterocarp lowland rain forest in Sabah, Malaysia, already threatened by recruitment shortage. The results of the simulations of 56 different scenarios using the process-based forest growth model Formind 2. 0 were assessed. Formind 2. 0 {{is based on the}} calculations of the carbon balance of individual trees belonging to 13 different plant functional types. Desturbed recruitment leads to shifts in the abundances of species, to species loss, and to forest decline and dieback depending on the level of recruitment shortage. Forests under recruitment shortage lose their stability, additional disturbances like logging cause permanent and severe changes in tree species composition...|$|R

The ruling was that [...] "take" [...] included indirect taking by means of the habitat modification/destruction associated with logging:Corkill v Forestry Commission of New South Wales (1991) 73 LGRA 126.
