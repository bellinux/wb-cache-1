40|$|<b>Cardiac</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> are a {{well known}} cause of epileptic {{seizures}}. Epileptic seizures resulting in <b>cardiac</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> are less well recognised and <b>cardiac</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> are commonly {{presumed to be}} of primary cardiac origin. This paper describes a patient with complete AV heart-block during a partial complex seizure. Simultaneous EEG/ECG monitoring was used to show the secondary nature of the bradyarrhythmia...|$|R
40|$|Sudden {{unexpected}} {{death in}} epilepsy (SUDEP) accounts for 5 - 30 % of deaths {{in patients with}} epilepsy. Past research has attempted to reveal these mechanisms, but the specific risk factors and pathophysiology have not been established. Inherited lethal <b>cardiac</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> can be erroneously diagnosed as epilepsy. A diagnosis of coexistent epilepsy cannot be completely excluded in the inherited <b>cardiac</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> but the differential diagnosis is often challenged. SUDEP {{may be attributed to}} seizure-induced fatal <b>cardiac</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> or cardiopulmonary dysfunction as a secondary cause. The expanding knowledge base has increased the understanding of the structure-function and genotype-phenotype relationships of ion channels and has provided insights into the pathophysiological basis of common diseases such as <b>cardiac</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> and epilepsy. In this review, the mechanisms for SUDEP and the possible relationships between epilepsy and inherited <b>cardiac</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> as “neuro-cardiac channelopathy ” have been discussed based on clinical and genetic evidence...|$|R
40|$|The {{current study}} was {{conducted}} to find out the prevalence of <b>cardiac</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> in clinically healthy Iranian fat-tailed sheep in two physiological states, i. e., late pregnancy and early post-partum periods. The electrocardiogram (ECG) was recorded from 32 sheep (early post-partum, n= 17 and late pregnant, n= 15) without any clinical signs of cardiac diseases. Assessment of ECG revealed that 84. 3 % of sheep had one or two kinds of <b>cardiac</b> <b>arrhythmias.</b> Two types of <b>cardiac</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> which detected in this study were sinus tachycardia and sinus arrhythmia. The proportion of different <b>cardiac</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> between early post-partum and late pregnant sheep, were significantly (P= 0. 003) different. Sinus tachycardia was the most frequent arrhythmia recorded in both groups. Since none of the sheep with <b>cardiac</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> exhibited any clinical signs of heart disease at the time of ECG recording, the arrhythmias seen in this study could be regarded as physiological ones...|$|R
5|$|Cooked {{tarantula}} spiders {{are considered}} a delicacy in Cambodia, and by the Piaroa Indians of southern Venezuela. Spider venoms may be a less polluting alternative to conventional pesticides as they are deadly to insects but the great majority are harmless to vertebrates. Possible medical uses for spider venoms are being investigated, {{for the treatment of}} <b>cardiac</b> <b>arrhythmia,</b> Alzheimer's disease, strokes, and erectile dysfunction. Because spider silk is both light and very strong, attempts are being made to produce it in goats' milk and in the leaves of plants, by means of genetic engineering.|$|E
5|$|Hydrofluoric acid is {{a contact}} poison with greater hazards than many strong acids like sulfuric acid {{even though it}} is weak: it remains neutral in aqueous {{solution}} and thus penetrates tissue faster, whether through inhalation, ingestion or the skin, and at least nine U.S. workers died in such accidents from 1984 to 1994. It reacts with calcium and magnesium in the blood leading to hypocalcemia and possible death through <b>cardiac</b> <b>arrhythmia.</b> Insoluble calcium fluoride formation triggers strong pain and burns larger than 160cm2 (25in2) can cause serious systemic toxicity.|$|E
5|$|Risk factors {{indicating}} {{an increased}} risk of death include older age, female gender, a history of liver cirrhosis, biliary narrowing due to cancer, acute renal failure and the presence of liver abscesses. Complications following severe cholangitis include renal failure, respiratory failure (inability of the respiratory system to oxygenate blood and/or eliminate carbon dioxide), <b>cardiac</b> <b>arrhythmia,</b> wound infection, pneumonia, gastrointestinal bleeding and myocardial ischemia (lack of blood flow to the heart, leading to heart attacks).|$|E
40|$|AbstractEpilepsy, the commonest serious {{neurological}} condition, {{is associated}} with an increased risk in premature deaths, including an estimated 500 sudden unexpected deaths (SUDEP) per year in the UK. In some patients seizures are associated with <b>cardiac</b> <b>arrhythmias,</b> which are thought to be a major factor in SUDEP. Omega- 3 fatty acids have been shown to reduce <b>cardiac</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> in animal studies and to reduce sudden cardiac deaths, thought to be due to <b>cardiac</b> <b>arrhythmias,</b> in both healthy subjects and in those who have had one myocardial infarction. Additionally, omega- 3 fatty acids in animal studies and in a small clinical observation study have shown anti-seizure effects. Omega- 3 fatty acid supplementation in patients with refractory seizures may reduce seizures and seizure associated <b>cardiac</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> and hence SUDEP...|$|R
40|$|Alcohol {{abuse and}} {{particularly}} extension of alcohol consumption in alcohol diseas {{increases the risk}} of <b>cardiac</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> development and aggravates existing arrhythmias. Patients do not always receive the necessary specific treatment due to lack of detection of the ethanol genesis of these arrhythmias. Management of patients with alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence, including its cardiac complications among other <b>cardiac</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> should use both antiarrhythmic and anti-alcohol drugs and antidepressants. Such issues as diagnosis and management of patients with alcohol-induced <b>cardiac</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> are presented. </p...|$|R

5|$|Hypokalemia (low blood {{potassium}} levels) commonly {{occurs during}} attacks; levels below 3.0mmol/l are typically encountered. Magnesium and phosphate levels are often {{found to be}} decreased. Creatine kinase levels are elevated in two thirds of cases, usually due to a degree of muscle injury; severe elevations suggestive of rhabdomyolysis (muscle tissue destruction) are rare. Electrocardiography (ECG/EKG) may show tachycardia (a fast heart rate) due to the thyroid disease, abnormalities due to <b>cardiac</b> <b>arrhythmia</b> (atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia), and conduction changes associated with hypokalemia (U waves, QRS widening, QT prolongation, and T wave flattening). Electromyography shows changes similar to those encountered in myopathies (muscle diseases), with a reduced amplitude of the compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs); they resolve when treatment has commenced.|$|E
5|$|Mancera {{has been}} married twice. His first {{marriage}} was to a woman named Martha in the early 1990s, with whom lived in civil union for a year. They divorced two years later, and after six years Mancera married Magnolia, {{with whom he had}} two children, Miguel and Leonardo. After a decade, he divorced Magnolia. Mancera has a daughter out of wedlock, but he has said the child's mother does not want Mancera to see her. In September 2007, two assailants on a motorcycle intercepted and attempted to rob him while he drove his BMW in Periférico Sur. His bodyguard intervened and shot one of the robbers, killing him. From 2008 to 2009, Mancera dated Alejandra Barrales, who was the president of the PRD party at that time, and also she intended to become the PRD candidate for Mayor of Mexico City in 2012. In his spare time, he practices multiple sports, including Krav Maga, indoor cycling and weight lifting, hunting and aviation. On October 31, 2014, Mancera had a cardiac surgery because three months before a <b>cardiac</b> <b>arrhythmia</b> was detected. During the surgery, he had a cardiac perforation. He recovered two weeks later.|$|E

40|$|An {{exploratory}} study design {{was used to}} describe the relationship between the degree of acute rejection and the presence of <b>cardiac</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> in <b>cardiac</b> transplant patients. The frequencies and types of <b>cardiac</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> were observed in relationship to the results of endomyocardial biopsy and the serum T cell levels. A retrospective primary review of records was conducted utilizing 42 cardiac transplant recipients with a total of 128 endomyocardial biopsy procedures, the unit of analysis. In general, more <b>cardiac</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> were recorded after endomyocarial biopsy than before and the majority were atrial type arrhythmias, followed by ventricular and junctional arrhythmias. The significant relationships occurred between conduction arrhythmias, both frequency and type, and acute rejection. However, very small numbers of conduction arrhythmias were reported. Previous relationships between <b>cardiac</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> in general and acute rejection were not supported, possibly due to the effects of cyclosporine (Sandimmune) ...|$|R

25|$|In heart, Epac1 is {{expressed}} predominantly, and {{is involved in}} the development of hypertrophic events by chronic cAMP stimulation through β-adrenergic receptors. In contrast, chronic stimulation of Epac2 may be a cause of <b>cardiac</b> <b>arrhythmia</b> through CaMKII-dependent diastolic sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ release in mice. Epac2 also is involved in GLP-1-stimulated atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) secretion from heart.|$|E
