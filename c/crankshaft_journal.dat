This bearing consists of several small journal bearings attached to a disk which has a larger <b>crankshaft</b> <b>journal</b> bearing in the center. Each piston has one head admission valve. This valve is actuated by a variable cam on the crankshaft, and allows for the entrance of supercritical water into the cylinder.

50|$|In the {{crankcase}} of {{a vehicle}} engine, motor oil lubricates rotating or sliding surfaces between the <b>crankshaft</b> <b>journal</b> bearings (main bearings and big-end bearings), and rods connecting the pistons to the crankshaft. The oil collects in an oil pan, or sump, {{at the bottom of}} the crankcase. In some small engines such as lawn mower engines, dippers on the bottoms of connecting rods dip into the oil at the bottom and splash it around the crankcase as needed to lubricate parts inside. In modern vehicle engines, the oil pump takes oil from the oil pan and sends it through the oil filter into oil galleries, from which the oil lubricates the main bearings holding the crankshaft up at the main journals and camshaft bearings operating the valves. In typical modern vehicles, oil pressure-fed from the oil galleries to the main bearings enters holes in the main journals of the crankshaft.|$|E

40|$|Repairing {{marine diesel}} engine {{crankshafts}} {{is a significant}} part of overall engine repairs and thus is very important for the ship building and ship repair industry. When a ship’s diesel engine is repaired, <b>crankshaft</b> <b>journal</b> surfaces must be renewed according to very precise geometrical and surface roughness requirements. Although current technologies are sufficient to meet these requirements, they are very time consuming and consequently expensive. A comprehensive research into the surface machining of marine diesel engine crankshaft journals allowed to improve technological processes and to identify respective surface roughness parameters, as well as to provide appropriate technological recommendations. It {{is important to note that}} <b>crankshaft</b> <b>journal</b> surfaces must be seen as 3 D objects, whose micro-topographical surface roughness parameters have to be defined so that they reflect the actual surface. To summarize all available scientific research in this field, we can state that there has been no analysis into the impact of technological regimes on the surface micro-topography of marine engine crankshaft journals. Bearing in mind the aforementioned arguments a study has been launched to develop a novel grinding technology, enabling diesel engine crankshafts with medium-sized crankpin journals to be repaired directly inside the engine housing. This paper covers the following issues: 1) Description of the novel technological equipment for <b>crankshaft</b> <b>journal</b> grinding; 2) 3 D roughness model of the <b>crankshaft</b> <b>journal</b> surface; 3) calculation of 3 D parameters based on practical metrological and technological characteristics. This technology saves significant financial resources as well as reduces engine repair time. By solving problems related to surface accuracy, it is possible to considerably improve the crankshaft machining process, along with the performance of maintenance operations and consequently the overall quality of repair work.

Determination of forces and torques that act on the crankshaft journals firstly requires determination of forces that act on components of engines mechanism: piston, connecting rod and crankpins of the crankshaft. In this paper, calculation of reactions on crankshaft journals is done according to literature [1], where in computation of reactions on the crankshaft journals; the effects of detached parts of the crankshaft is taking into consideration by substituting them with torques located above the supporters, in the analyses rod.

V6 engines, on the other hand, are generally arranged at 60° (again because of timing), but can be built as 90° engines, with either staggered timing or split <b>crankshaft</b> <b>journals.</b> 90° V6 engines are shorter and wider than 60° engines, allowing lower engine bay hood/bonnet profiles.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the article {{is to develop a}} tool to assess the {{theoretical}} resource crankshaft bearings of internal combustion engine. As a result, two methods for evaluating of the theoretical resource crankshaft bearings have been developed {{on the basis of the}} calculation of hydro-mechanical characteristics of bearings: the minimum film thickness and the extent of the zone of boundary friction. Under the theoretical resource of crankshaft bearing it is understood that during his work an increase of the radial clearance in the area of potential exposure (boundary friction) is over the limit. The first technique is based on the bearing life dependence on the ratio between the minimum film thickness and its maximum allowable value. The second technique is based on the molecular-mechanical theory of friction and wear fatigue theory. Thus, these techniques may be used to estimate the resource of the <b>crankshaft</b> <b>journal</b> bearings at the design and finishing stage. However, some parameters of mathematical models have to be determined from the experimental test.

40|$|The most {{important}} design parameters for hermetically sealed compressors used in domestic refrigerators are the Coefficient of Performance (COP); low manufacturing and operating costs; long operating life, low {{noise and vibration}} levels and to achieve environmentally friendly constructions. Positive displacement piston type compressors are used in refrigerators today due to their high capacity/volume ratios. Hence, the bearings of the hermetic compressors must also satisfy these design conditions. Investigation and optimization of crank shaft bearings in hermetic compressor applications are the main objectives of this study. The effect of crank shaft geometry, bearing clearance, lubricant viscosity, surface roughness and bearing location along the shaft on the friction losses were investigated and the new journal bearing designs were developed. Detailed parametric numerical simulations were performed using commercial software. According {{to the results of}} the simulations number of compressors were assembled with the selected design parameters and performance measurements were carried out. The results of the numerical analysis have shown that the numerically calculated mechanical loss level is similar to the performance results measured in a calorimeter test system. Results of the simulations and experiments were evaluated with six sigma (6 ?) techniques. Measurement of the efficiency of the compressor with the improved bearing design showed 1. 3 % increase in the coefficient of performance (COP) with respect to the compressor with previous bearing design. This study shows that the mechanical loss characteristics are significantly influenced by the length of the bearings, clearance between the <b>crankshaft</b> <b>journal</b> and its bearing, kinematic viscosity and operating conditions.

40|$|Over the years, {{internal}} combustion engine technology development has been targeted towards improving operating efficiency and thereby lowering fuel consumption. Friction Mean Effective Pressure (FMEP) accounts for 7 - 15 % of the total indicative power produced in an engine cycle for large diesel engines, such as in trucks. The base-engine components such as piston rings, bearings, gears, seals and pumps contribute 60 % - 70 % of this FMEP. Minimizing the friction losses in the engine would translate to a direct reduction in fuel consumption. The development of low friction engine technology requires extensive studies and testing, with major challenges associated with the accurate measurement of individual component contribution to the overall engine friction power loss. Therefore, the requirement for a ‘Virtual Engine Friction Strip Test’ using modern simulation tools is exigent. This thesis project, {{in association with the}} Tribology and Mechanics research group, at the Advanced Technology and Research department at Volvo Group Trucks Technology aims at developing a full engine strip down test simulation model. Owing to the large number of active components on an engine contributing to the overall friction losses, the scope of this study is restricted to the major friction contributors in the cranktrain – piston rings, skirts, journal bearings on the connecting rods and the main <b>crankshaft</b> <b>journal</b> bearings. A one-dimensional analytical model was prepared using the Gamma Technologies’ GT-Suite simulation tool. The dynamics of the crankshaft and the piston cylinder unit are modeled. The hydrodynamics of the lubrication films for the bearings, rings and skirts are solved quasi-statically, and mixed lubrication and asperity contact lubrication are also modeled. Combined with an oil thermal model, a shear thinning model, and accurate measurement data, a detailed insight of the engine friction can be obtained. The model was validated against various other simulation approaches and against strip tests of the Volvo MD 13 Euro 4 DST Engine. The same test conditions of the strip tests are reproduced on the simulation model, and the results are compared. In order to establish the model fidelity and robust solution methodology, it is also used to perform various studies on friction reduction techniques. This Virtual Engine Strip Test simulation model provides an opportunity to analyze new friction reduction methods and unconventional engine designs, towards the development of a low friction engine...|$|E
40|$|The thermal {{behaviour}} of a 2. 4 l {{direct injection}} diesel engine {{has been investigated}} to identify how the fuel consumption penalty associated with operation during warm–up can be minimised. A version of PROMETS (Programme for Modelling Engine Thermal Systems) was developed to support the investigations. The developments improved the representation of thermal-friction conditions in the oil circuit, extended the piston heat transfer sub-model {{to account for the}} effects of piston cooling jets and introduced a main bearing thermal-friction model to predict friction and oil film temperatures. Computational studies were complemented by an experimental investigation of the effectiveness of pre-heating the oil feed to the bearings. Results show that heat transfer from the oil film to the bearings shells and <b>crankshaft</b> <b>journal</b> reduces the benefit in friction savings. Other measures considered were exhaust gas heat recovery, repositioning of the oil main gallery within the block, thermal energy storage, reductions in engine thermal capacity and a novel split-EGR cooler able to cool the EGR gases and heat either the coolant or oil streams. All of the above measures were investigated in isolation, but where appropriate different measures were adopted in conjunction to achieve even greater fuel savings. During warm-up the energy available to raise fluid temperatures is small. As a result, over the New European Drive Cycle, thermal energy storage showed the greatest benefits. Given an available source of thermal energy which can be transferred to the oil over a chosen time, simulations indicate that a higher power input over a shorter period is most beneficial. This reflects the increased sensitivity of oil viscosity to temperature changes at colder temperatures which in turn means that the potential to reduce friction is highest in the first minutes after engine start up but drops rapidly hereafter. Results also show how the balance of energy transfers out of the oil changes as the engine warms up and point to the importance of oil interaction with components in the lower parts of the engine which have a large thermal capacity, such as elements supporting the main bearings, the crankshaft and the lower liner which limit the rate of temperature rise of the oil. A combination of supplementary heat introduction into the oil circuit from a thermal store and an elimination of heat losses from the oil to the lower parts of the engine resulted in a fuel consumption saving close to that achieved by starting the engine fully warm, which equates to around 6 % improvement.

The engine's length was minimised by not staggering its cylinder banks fore and aft, which meant that the connecting rods from opposing cylinders had to share a short <b>crankshaft</b> bearing <b>journal</b> known as the [...] "big end".

5000|$|First, {{and most}} important, the <b>crankshaft's</b> rod <b>journals</b> are {{physically}} {{farther from the}} main journals than on the original equipment.

The piston travels 3.58 in (9.1 cm) in this configuration. When this engine is modified with a 402 cubic inch (6.6 l) stroker kit, the distance between the main journal centerline and the rod journal centerline is increased to 2.00 in (5.08 cm), which results in the piston travelling 4.00 in (10.16 cm).
