50|$|In 2008 {{the force}} changed uniforms to black <b>combat</b> style <b>trousers</b> with a polo shirt but reverted {{to the more}} {{traditional}} white shirt and tie on a trial basis in November 2012. It has since reverted to the polo shirt.|$|R
25|$|Until 1994 the No.1 Dress {{was also}} the {{everyday}} working uniform, but today it is rarely seen except on formal occasions. The normal working dress retains the shirt and trousers. In some forces short sleeved shirts may be worn open-necked. Long sleeved shirts must always be worn with a tie or cravat, worn {{with or without a}} jersey or fleece. If a jersey, fleece or jacket is worn over a short sleeved shirt, then a tie must be worn. In 2003, Strathclyde Police replaced the white shirts with black wicking T-shirts with stab vest on top, for the majority of officers on duty. Some forces use <b>combat</b> <b>trousers</b> (trousers are of a cargo pocket style i.e. two thigh pockets and two conventional side and rear pockets) and boots. Today, female officers almost never wear a skirt in working dress, and sometimes wear trousers in formal dress as well. Officers also frequently wear reflective waterproof jackets, which have replaced the old greatcoats and cloaks traditionally worn in inclement weather. Most officers now wear stab vests, a type of body armour, when on duty.|$|E

50|$|Before the 1966 Pattern {{equipment}} {{had reached}} all units a slightly revised design of Smock, <b>Combat</b> and <b>Trousers,</b> <b>Combat</b> were introduced as the 1968 Pattern range. The 1966 Pattern DPM fabric design was changed very little for the 1968 issue, {{and it seems}} that the 1968 Pattern garments were made for some time in the two very similar DPM fabrics. A Hood, Combat, DPM, made of DPM cotton fabric and with a plain olive green lining, was also included in the range, fastened as required {{to the back of the}} Smock with the two epaulette buttons and a third under the collar.|$|R

5000|$|The Cathedral's constables wear uniforms {{similar to}} typical British police officers. They wear {{a white shirt}} with epaulettes, black tie, black <b>combat</b> style <b>trousers,</b> and a high {{visibility}} jacket with the words [...] "Cathedral Constable" [...] on the back. Not all officers are attested, but sworn officers are distinguishable by their wearing of a cap with a blue and white chequered band, and the carrying of personal safety equipment. All constables are trained to deal with difficult and occasionally dangerous situations whilst ensuring minimal disruption to the spiritual tranquillity of the Cathedral.|$|R
50|$|In 1966 the Army introduced, {{though not}} universally, a {{camouflage}} field uniform. Known informally as the 1966 Pattern, {{it was in}} fact identical in design to the 1960 Pattern kit, though now made in DPM fabric. It is labelled, like the earlier plain olive green version, Smock, Combat, 1960 Pattern and <b>Trousers,</b> <b>Combat,</b> 1960 Pattern. The 1966 DPM range did not completely replace the plain olive green 1960 Pattern Smock and Trousers, which continued to be worn widely until the 1968 DPM kit was issued. Both the Royal Marines and the Parachute Regiment continued to wear the <b>Trousers,</b> <b>Combat,</b> 1960 Pattern with the Denison smock, and examples of these trousers were made even after 1968. These units eventually stopped issuing the Denison smock (in mid to late 1970s) and adopted smocks in the general-issue DPM while still for a time wearing the plain olive 1960 Pattern Trousers.|$|R
50|$|The Swedish Police Authority (Polismyndigheten) is {{the central}} {{administrative}} authority for the police in Sweden, responsible for law enforcement, general social order and public safety within the country. The agency is headed by the National Police Commissioner, who is appointed by the Government and has the sole responsibility for all activities of the police. Although formally organised under the Ministry of Justice, the Swedish police is—similar to other authorities in Sweden—essentially autonomous, {{in accordance with the}} constitution. The agency is governed by general policy instruments and is subject to a number of sanctions and oversight functions, to ensure that the exercise of public authority is in compliance with regulations. Police officers typically wear a dark-blue uniform consisting of <b>combat</b> style <b>trousers</b> with a police duty belt, a polo shirt or a long sleeve button shirt, and a side-cap embellished with a metal cap badge. The standard equipment includes a handgun, pepper spray and an expandable baton.|$|R

50|$|A notable {{exception}} was the Special Service Force (SSF), {{who wore a}} camouflage jump smock, regimental T-shirt, beret, and high-top paratrooper boots, with work dress or <b>combat</b> <b>trousers</b> as applicable.|$|E
50|$|Adult {{members who}} had {{military}} force service experiences might own sets of No.9 uniform, issued by both RHKR(V) and HKMSC. Others may buy DPM field dress themselves. Cadet members wear a pair of Olive Green lightweight trousers instead of DPM lightweight <b>trousers.</b> <b>Combat</b> Soldier 95 (CS95) shirts were restricted by the Corps as the system adopt rank slides instead of epaulettes. However, some members modified the shirts, putting epaulettes tapes onto the uniform to meet the standard of the Corps. Also, olive-green brassards used by Regular Army in early-80's are adopted by the Corps, instead of rank patches used in late-80's and early-90's.|$|R
5000|$|The British Army had officially {{adopted a}} DPM combat uniform for general use in 1972, and a Smock, combat, DPM was {{introduced}} {{as the general}} issue jacket of the range. Both the Royal Marines and the Parachute Regiment, together with Air Despatchers of 47 Air Despatch Squadron (RCT) and the 395th Air Despatch Troop (RCT) (V), continued to wear the Denison smock, (typically with olive green <b>Trousers,</b> <b>combat,</b> 1960 pattern for field use or [...] "lightweight" [...] trousers in barracks and walking-out) until the late 1970s. The Royal Bermuda Regiment, the home defence unit of the British colony of Bermuda, wore the Denison 'til adopting the 1968 Pattern DPM uniform {{at the end of}} the 1970s.|$|R
5000|$|The {{official}} attire for PDS stipulated by HQ NCC is the Smart No. 4 uniform for all cadets, although {{air or sea}} {{units are}} permitted to wear their respective No. 3 uniforms without badges. Since male cadets in Land units only receive their No.3 uniform upon graduation from the Cadet Officer Course, No. 3 uniforms are sometimes borrowed {{for the sake of}} performances. In this case, the No. 3 uniform is worn with white stable belts, white polyester laces and <b>combat</b> boots with <b>trousers</b> tucked into garters, in imitation of the Military Police No. 3 Uniform. Modified versions of the attire can be worn to increase the aesthetic appeal of the performance, notable examples being Half No. 4 with Jockey Cap, Half No. 3, No. 3 with Brassards labelled [...] "PDS", [...] "Precision Drill" [...] or with ranks embroidered, also in imitation of the SAF Military Police No. 3 Uniform. White gloves can also be worn for performances.|$|R

5000|$|The man on {{the left}} is {{slightly}} less specific in the service representation of his gear and uniform, but he appears to be a U.S. Army Soldier, as he wears a Tropical ("Boonie") Hat, which was widely worn by Army combat personnel in Vietnam (particularly towards {{the latter part of the}} war), and to a much lesser extent by Marines. His uniform consists of the Tropical <b>Combat</b> Jacket and <b>Trousers,</b> and [...] "jungle" [...] boots. Like his comrade on his far left, his uniform jacket's sleeves are rolled up. This man wears no body armor, is armed only with an M60 machine gun, and carries two separate belts of 7.62mm machine-gun ammunition, draped and criss-crossed over his torso. He is also wearing an M17 Protective (Gas) Mask carrier on his left thigh, although U.S. troops infrequently wore or used gas masks in Vietnam. (They were used primarily when tear gas (CS gas) was employed in combat, such as by tunnel rats, and by troops engaged in urban/city combat, such as the Marines in Huế City in January and February 1968). Under his uniform jacket, he also wears a GI M-1956 pistol belt, with two M-1956 canteen covers that are attached, each carrying a GI 1-quart canteens, and situated at the right rear hip.|$|R
50|$|When on duty {{officers}} wear black wicking T-shirts, {{and black}} <b>combat</b> <b>trousers.</b> Dorset Police no longer use the traditional police jumper, having favoured the black fleece with police {{written on the}} chest and back. Dorset Police do not have Brunswick stars on their epaulettes, just the rank and collar number (or just collar number for constables). Regular Officers and Special Constables wear the same uniform including black <b>combat</b> <b>trousers,</b> black wicking tops and black stab vests. High Visibility Tac Vests are now issued to all officers, along with Body Armour. The idea of these utility vests are to spread {{the weight of the}} equipment carried by officers across the torso rather than place strain on the waist when using a standard utility vest.|$|E
5000|$|The {{earliest}} {{suspect was}} a man in his mid-twenties, [...] five foot ten in height, [...] with sandy-coloured Oasis-style hair like that of Noel Gallagher, who was wearing light coloured <b>combat</b> <b>trousers</b> and a beige top seen arguing with her less than an hour before she was killed.|$|E
