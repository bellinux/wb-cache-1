25|$|STV {{has some}} {{history in the}} United States. Many cities, {{including}} New York City, once used it {{to break up the}} Democratic Party monopolies on elective office. Cincinnati, Ohio, adopted STV in 1925 {{to get rid of a}} Republican Party monopoly, but the Republicans returned the city to FPTP in 1957. From 1870 to 1980, Illinois used a semi-proportional <b>cumulative</b> <b>voting</b> system to elect its House of Representatives. Each district across the state elected both Republicans and Democrats year-after-year. Cambridge, Massachusetts, (STV) and Peoria, Illinois, (<b>cumulative</b> <b>voting)</b> continue to use PR. San Francisco had citywide elections in which people would cast votes for five or six candidates simultaneously, delivering some of the benefits of proportional representation.|$|E
25|$|As part of {{settlement}} of this case, five Alabama cities and counties, including Chilton County, adopted {{a system of}} <b>cumulative</b> <b>voting</b> for election of representatives in multi-seat jurisdictions. This has resulted in more proportional representation for voters. In another form of proportional representation, 23 jurisdictions use limited voting, as in Conecuh County. In 1982, limited voting was first tested in Conecuh County. Together use of these systems has {{increased the number of}} African Americans and women being elected to local offices, resulting in governments that are more representative of their citizens.|$|E

500|$|According to Harvard Business School, Williams once {{described}} {{teaching as a}} [...] "real thrill". Williams utilized the case study method of teaching, using real life examples to facilitate discussion among his students. While serving as a professor at Harvard Business School, Williams received honors and awards for his teaching and served {{on a number of}} corporate boards. Williams was also the author or co-author of hundreds of cases as well as numerous articles and several books, including Basic Business Finance: Text and Cases, which he co-authored with fellow Harvard Business School professors Pearson Hunt and Gordon Donaldson. Basic Business Finance {{is considered one of the}} seminal textbooks in the fields of business and finance and was adopted for use in more than 300 colleges and universities. In 1951, Williams authored the book, <b>Cumulative</b> <b>Voting</b> for Directors, a study of <b>cumulative</b> <b>voting</b> by stockholders to elect corporate directors. Two years later, he co-authored the textbook Case Problems in Finance with Harvard Business School colleague Pearson Hunt. Williams also authored and co-authored cases illustrating financial policies of banks and corporations, including Chase Manhattan Bank, First Pennsylvania Corporation and General Motors.|$|E
2500|$|FairVote {{also argued}} that <b>cumulative</b> <b>voting</b> is {{appropriate}} under the Voting Rights Act, as it [...] "ensures the equal principle of [...] "one-person, one vote"", is race-neutral, {{and that it is}} supported by case law and history.

6000|$|Lord Grey's {{prescription}} for correcting the practical faults revealed by experience in our present system of representation, {{consisted of the}} following ingredients:--the cumulative vote; not fewer than three seats to each constituency; universities and some other constituencies, necessarily consisting of educated men, to have increased representation; {{a limited number of}} life members to be introduced into the House of Commons, the vacancies to be filled, when not less than three had occurred, by <b>cumulative</b> <b>vote</b> within the House itself. On all this Mr. Greg wrote to Lord Grey (May 28, 1874): 'I quite agree with you that this impending danger we both foresee might be averted, if our country would listen either to you or to me.' ...|$|R
50|$|As with <b>cumulative</b> <b>voting,</b> Storable Votes allow {{voters to}} {{redistribute}} votes among issues {{as they see}} fit. However, <b>cumulative</b> <b>voting</b> applies to a single multi-candidate election, whereas Storable Votes apply to multiple elections, each between two alternatives only.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Cumulative</b> <b>voting</b> {{satisfies}} the monotonicity criterion, the participation criterion, the consistency criterion, and reversal symmetry. <b>Cumulative</b> <b>voting</b> does not satisfy independence of irrelevant alternatives, later-no-harm criterion nor the Condorcet criterion. It does not satisfy the plurality criterion. The 11th edition of Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised states, [...] "If it is desired to elect by mail, by plurality vote, by preferential voting, or by <b>cumulative</b> <b>voting,</b> {{this must be}} expressly stated, and necessary {{details of the procedure}} should be prescribed (see 45)." [...] (Emphasis added). Robert's Rules describes the <b>cumulative</b> <b>voting</b> process. It provides that, [...] "A minority group, by coordinating its effort in voting for only one candidate {{who is a member of}} the group, may be able to secure the election of that candidate as a minority member of the board." [...] (Emphasis added). Thus, <b>cumulative</b> <b>voting,</b> when permitted, is a right to accumulate or stack votes but not a guarantee that this stacking will meet or override other election criteria such as a majority vote or majority present.|$|E

6000|$|I {{went with}} a man named Willersley, a man some years senior to myself, who had just missed a {{fellowship}} and the higher division of the Civil Service, and who had become an enthusiastic member of the London School Board, upon which the <b>cumulative</b> <b>vote</b> {{and the support of}} the [...] "advanced" [...] people had placed him. He had, like myself, a small independent income that relieved him of any necessity to earn a living, and he had a kindred craving for social theorising and some form of social service. He had sought my acquaintance after reading a paper of mine (begotten by the visit of Chris Robinson) on the limits of pure democracy. It had marched with some thoughts of his own.|$|R
50|$|In 1998, {{voters in}} Oregon passed an {{initiative}} requiring that all elections {{be conducted by}} mail. Voters may also drop their ballots off at a county designated official drop site. Oregon has since reduced the cost of elections, and the time available to tally votes has increased. Oregon requires receipt of votes by 8:00pm local time on election day. County elections offices collect from post offices at their closing time on election day and from drop boxes at 8:00pm election day. Any valid ballot received by 8:00pm local time on election day by any county is required to be counted, unless the <b>cumulative</b> <b>votes</b> of any valid ballots transferred to the relevant county elections office after {{the closing of the}} polls cannot change the outcome of the election for any given seat.|$|R
5000|$|The rosters for the All-Star Game are {{selected}} through a voting process. The starters {{for the first}} time are chosen by not only the fans, but also by the media and current NBA players. Fans make up 50% of the vote, and NBA players and media each comprise 25% of the vote. The two guards and three frontcourt players who receive the highest <b>cumulative</b> <b>vote</b> totals are named the All-Star starters. NBA head coaches vote for the reserves for their respective conferences, none of which can be players on their own team. Each coach selects two guards, three frontcourt players and two wild cards, with each selected player ranked in order of preference within each category. If a multi-position player is to be selected, coaches are encouraged to vote for the player at the position that was [...] "most advantageous for the All-Star team", regardless of where the player was listed on the All-Star ballot or the position he was listed in box scores.|$|R
50|$|Buckalew was {{the most}} {{influential}} early advocate of proportional representation in the United States.

50|$|Advocates of <b>cumulative</b> <b>voting</b> often {{argue that}} {{political}} and racial minorities deserve better representation.

5000|$|Many of Abu Bakr Effendi's {{descendants}} {{originate from}} {{his marriage to}} Tohora Saban Cook whom he married after renouncing the [...] "perfectly white" [...] first wife, Rukea Maker.

The family continues to reside in South Africa, with some returning to Turkey, and many migrating to Australia. Some of Abubakr's sons continued in his footsteps of serving far and wide, with one son, Ahmed, getting involved in Cape politics. He {{became a member of}} the Cemetery Committee because the cemetery where his father's grave was situated was threatened with closure by the Cape Administration. He stood for the legislature of the Cape but failed to get the required votes for a seat due to a change in the system for <b>cumulative</b> <b>votes,</b> amended especially to keep him out of the lCape legislature. Some also served in the Ottoman Army and fought in the Hejaz against the Anglo and Arab nationalist uprising against the Ottoman Empire.

5000|$|Since the {{adoption}} of the Cutback Amendment, there have been proposals by some major political figures in Illinois to bring back multi-member districts. A task force led by former governor Jim Edgar and former federal judge Abner Mikva issued a report in 2001 calling for the revival of <b>cumulative</b> <b>voting,</b> [...] in part because it appears that such a system increases the representation of racial minorities in elected office. [...] The Chicago Tribune editorialized in 1995 that the multi-member districts elected with <b>cumulative</b> <b>voting</b> produced better legislators. [...] Others have argued that the now-abandoned system provided for greater [...] "stability" [...] in the lower house. A recent effort in 2010 called the Putback Amendment led by John Bambenek also would have restored <b>cumulative</b> <b>voting,</b> but it ultimately did not qualify for the ballot.|$|E
60|$|In {{the general}} debates on Mr. Disraeli's Reform Bill, my {{participation}} {{was limited to}} the one speech already mentioned; but I made the Bill an occasion for bringing the two great improvements which remain to be made in Representative Government, formally before the House and the nation. One of them was Personal, or, as it is called with equal propriety, Proportional Representation. I brought this under the consideration of the House, by an expository and argumentative speech on Mr. Hare's plan; and subsequently I was active in support of the very imperfect substitute for that plan, which, in a small number of constituencies, Parliament was induced to adopt. This poor makeshift had scarcely any recommendation, except that it was a partial recognition of the evil which it did so little to remedy. As such, however, it was attacked by the same fallacies, and required to be defended on the same principles, as a really good measure; and its adoption in a few Parliamentary elections, as well as the subsequent introduction of what is called the <b>Cumulative</b> <b>Vote</b> in the elections for the London School Board, have had the good effect of converting the equal claim of all electors to a proportional share in the representation, from a subject of merely speculative discussion, into a question of practical politics, much sooner than would otherwise have been the case.|$|R
40|$|The {{internet}} allows modern {{artists to}} share their creative works online. Users of art sharing websites are influenced by each other, and if a creative work {{does not have a}} lot of views or likes, people tend to assume that the work – or the artist – is bad or unpopular. Consequently, popular artists enjoy a self-reinforcing cycle of increasing visibility, but it is difficult for new artists to gain recognition. My partner, Rob Riglietti, and I worked to develop a new anonymous web application for artists to share creative works such as art, poems, and photographs. Rob and I designed the app to be anonymous so that users could view and judge the creative works without being influenced by the identity of the creator or by other users. Rather than showing the most popular works on the site’s home page, works with the least exposure – as represented by up- or down-votes – are displayed first. In addition, a work’s <b>cumulative</b> <b>vote</b> total is not shown to visitors until they have voted themselves. I coded the web application using the JavaScript framework Meteor. Meteor, unlike most traditional web development tools, is a full-stack, reactive framework. Full stack means that a web developer codes both the “front end” (the user’s interface) and the “back end” (the server) together in a unified program. Reactive means that any changes to the application or its data are immediately relayed to all users of the application; the web page updates in real time. Although the app has not been released for public use {{at the time of this}} writing, I have greatly increased my web development knowledge through my work on this project...|$|R
60|$|The {{political}} {{circumstances of}} the time induced me, shortly after, to complete and publish a pamphlet (Thoughts on Parliamentary Reform), part {{of which had been}} written some years previously on the occasion of one of the abortive Reform Bills, and had at the time been approved and revised by her. Its principal features were, hostility to the Ballot (a change of opinion in both of us, in which she rather preceded me), and a claim of representation for minorities; not, however, at that time going beyond the <b>cumulative</b> <b>vote</b> proposed by Mr. Garth Marshall. In finishing the pamphlet for publication, with a view to the discussions on the Reform Bill of Lord Derby's and Mr. Disraeli's Government in 1859, I added a third feature, a plurality of votes, to be given, not to property, but to proved superiority of education. This recommended itself to me as a means of reconciling the irresistible claim of every man or woman to be consulted, and to be allowed a voice, in the regulation of affairs which vitally concern them, with the superiority of weight justly due to opinions grounded on superiority of knowledge. The suggestion, however, was one which I had never discussed with my almost infallible counsellor, and I have no evidence that she would have concurred in it. As far as I have been able to observe, it has found favour with nobody; all who desire any sort of inequality in the electoral vote, desiring it in favour of property and not of intelligence or knowledge. If it ever overcomes the strong feeling which exists against it, this will only be after the establishment of a systematic National Education by which the various grades of politically valuable acquirement may be accurately defined and authenticated. Without this it will always remain liable to strong, possibly conclusive, objections; and with this, it would perhaps not be needed.|$|R
