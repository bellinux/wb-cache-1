This is particularly striking because according to DR standards, presence of coliforms in more than 5 percent of samples indicates that water is no longer potable.|$|E
25|$|Though Paules {{highlights}} the positive consequences of emotional labor {{for a specific}} population of waitresses, other scholars have also found negative consequences of emotional labor within the waitressing industry. Through eighteen months of participant observation research, Bayard De Volo (2003) found that casino waitresses are highly monitored and monetarily bribed to perform emotional labor in the workplace. Specifically, Bayard De Volo (2003) argues that through a sexualized environment and a generous tipping system, both casino owners and customers control waitresses' behavior and appearance for their own benefit and pleasure. Even though the waitresses have their own forms of individual and collective resistance mechanisms, intense and <b>consistent</b> <b>monitoring</b> of their actions by casino management {{makes it difficult to}} change the power dynamics of the casino workplace.|$|E

40|$|The {{relationship}} between self-monitoring and weight control was examined closely by analyzing 18 weeks of data for 56 {{participants in a}} long-term cognitive behavioral weight-loss program. The percentage of subjects who monitored consistently, which monitoring variables were most related to weight change, {{and the effect of}} variability in monitoring on weight change were examined. Approximately 2 Aof the subjects moni-tored food consumption for the entire day {{more than half of the}} days; approximately did not monitor on most days. Monitoring-any food eaten, all foods eaten, time food was eaten, quantity of food eaten, and grams of fat consumed-was positively correlated with weight change. Not monitoring at all was negatively associated with weight change. More <b>consistent</b> <b>monitors</b> lost more weight and participants lost much more weight during their best, compared to their worst, weeks of monitoring. These results upport the notions that self-monitoring, and perhaps "obsessive-compulsive self-regulation, " are necessary for successful weight control. Self-monitoring is the systematic observation and recording of target be-haviors (Kanfer, 1970). Self-monitoring is sometimes described as the "cor-nerstone " (Wadden, 1993, p. 201) and the most effective technique used in be-havioral treatments ofobesity (Kirschenbaum, 1987; Perri, Nezu, & Viegener...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To examine: (1) the {{relationship}} between parental monitoring and communication and adolescent risk involvement over time, including consideration of their potential interaction; and (2) the effect of <b>consistent</b> versus inconsistent <b>monitoring</b> and communication over time on adolescent risk behaviors. METHODS: Baseline and follow-up {{data were collected from}} 1999 - 2003. A total of 817 African-American adolescents and their parents were recruited from 35 low-income urban communities in Baltimore, MD. Perceived parental monitoring, parent-adolescent communication and seven risk behaviors were assessed. Logistic general estimating equation (GEE) models were performed to assess the dynamic association. RESULTS: Perceived parental monitoring had protective effects on concurrent adolescent risk involvement over two-year observation. The protective effect on girls' sexual abstinence increased significantly over time. Perceived problem communication was associated with increased risk of concurrent involvement in violent behaviors, but the effect did not change over time. For girls, the probability of engaging in sex increased greatly (from 0. 3 to 0. 6) for those who perceived problem communication, while it remained stable (about 0. 4) for those perceiving less problem communication. CONCLUSIONS: The data confirm the protective effect of perceived parental monitoring on adolescent risk involvement. It also extends previous findings by showing the importance of <b>consistent</b> parental <b>monitoring</b> and communication...|$|R

5000|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, Hebrew National {{switched}} to an external certification group, the Triangle K, {{under the auspices}} of Rabbi Aryeh Ralbag, which was widely seen as somewhat of an upgrade in its standards of kashrut. In 2004, the Conservative Movement found the upgrade sufficient to be acceptable by Conservative standards. [...] The Rabbis Ralbag and Plotkin conferred jointly and developed a strategy for <b>consistent</b> <b>monitoring</b> of the products labeled kosher by Hebrew National. By reducing production facilities to just one location, expenses were dramatically reduced for upkeep, utilities, employees, and maintenance. The production process was streamlined so that a viewing station kept an eye on each individual sausage that passed through the facility. Rabbis Plotkin and Ralbag share monitoring duties amongst a group of other Rabbis, allowing for a pure and reliable dedication to the purveyance of Kosher hot dogs. Hebrew National hot dogs are, in this way, able to claim their product as Kosher. In a blog post on the subject, Conservative rabbi and kosher certification entrepreneur Jason Miller lamented the fact that in several baseball stadiums in the United States, Hebrew National hot dogs are publicized as kosher [...] "when in fact they are cooked on the same grill as the non-kosher hot dogs and sausages" [...] and served on dairy hot dog buns.|$|E
50|$|The {{success of}} the Tahr Control Plan, {{as well as the}} future of tahr in New Zealand, {{can be seen from the}} report {{prepared}} by Kenneth F.D. Hughey and Karen M. Wason, which presents survey results conducted among farmers living within tahr distribution. As they demonstrate, roughly 80% of farmers view tahrs as a resource, not as a threat. The respondents indicated they place conservational and commercial value (live animal/meat, hunting, farming) on tahrs. Thirty six percent of these farmers also reported to having earned at least $1,000 a year in profit from having tahrs on their property, with the highest earnings being above $50,000 (Table 5.5 of that study), usually as a result of allowing professionally guided hunters on their property. Also, a 1988 study showed that hunters spent $851 per person per year on hunting, with expenses being greatest for big-game targets, such as the Himalayan tahr.The fact that the tahr is no longer viewed by general public as an unwanted species may indicate their numbers are now successfully reduced to an acceptable range. This reflects the Department of Conservation’s efforts to promote tahr hunting, <b>consistent</b> <b>monitoring</b> for the trends in tahr population, and official control operations. In New Zealand alone, an estimated $840M have been spent on alien species per year (0.9% of GNP), 25% being towards vertebrate mammals. Of these total costs, $400 M have been dedicated to defense against the invasive species. If conditions maintain, “the total cost of alien vertebrates in New Zealand may therefore exceed $270 million per year”. However, as shown above, these costs may come along with some negative environmental effects on native ecosystems.|$|E
50|$|Proponents of GIP discuss {{several ways}} to {{mitigate}} risks. Governments can make sufficient choices about which industries or companies to support. Some instances of targeting the wrong firms or industries are inevitable because some degree of failure is inherent in GIP effort. Profit cannot measure success, but rather, success occurs {{with the creation of}} environmental and technological externalities. Governments can avoid using the wrong policy instruments when they experiment in select parts of the country before applying policy country-wide. Policy learning and lesson drawing from industrial policy and GIP can foster the adoption of correct policy instruments. Rent-seeking can be an issue, but the creation of rent attracts investors into risky green technology fields. Rent management can avoid the problem by dictating the correct amount of profit, offering profit incentives in an appropriate way, and withdrawing them when markets can function on their own. Governments must work with the private sector, and the two should have a mutual interest and understanding of the issues each seeks to address, although governments must avoid capture by the private sector. Independent monitoring of policy progress, strong institutions, consumer protection agencies, and a free press can deal with the risk of political capture. Furthermore, clear objectives, <b>consistent</b> <b>monitoring,</b> evaluation techniques, and exit strategies can strengthen policies. Policies can avoid trade disputes through the process of policy learning and if policies adhere to WTO rules. Policymakers can evade ineffective GIP through the creation of a transparent and accountable political coalition of actors, which includes public-private partnerships, business alliances, and civil society. A strong coalition also addresses coordination failures. The extra risks of GIP options could avoid future costs by increasing progress toward more ambitious cuts in emissions. As a result, GIP that is politically optimal may be economically optimal in the long-run, even if it experiences immediate inefficiencies.|$|E
