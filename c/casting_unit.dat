40|$|In <b>casting</b> <b>units,</b> workers {{work under}} tough {{conditions}} {{to perform the}} desired task. These toughconditions normally give rise to various musculoskeletal disorders within the workers. These disordersemerge within the workers body due to repetitive lifting, differential lifting height, ambient conditionsetc. For the minimization of musculoskeletal disorders it is quite difficult to model with mathematicaldifference or differential equations. In this paper the minimization of musculoskeletal disorders problemhas been formulated using artificial neural networks model. But the existing neural network model hasvarious drawbacks like large training time, huge data requirement to train for a non linear complexmusculoskeletal disorders problem, the relatively large number of hidden nodes required etc. Hence, anattempt {{has been made to}} develop a non linear model using fuzzified neuron sub-models to overcome theabove mentioned problems. These models would have the capability of representing solutions forminimizing musculoskeletal disorders needed for workers working in the <b>casting</b> <b>units...</b>|$|R

50|$|The Series B Rapide {{designed}} {{during the}} war and released to the press before end of hostilities looked radically different from the A: now the oil pipes were internal, and the gearbox was part of the engine <b>casting</b> (<b>Unit</b> Construction). The angle between the cylinders was now 50° instead of the 47.5° of the Series A engine. This allowed the use of the engine as a stressed member of the frame, which consisted of an oil-tank spine with the engine hanging below, and the front and rear suspension attached at the ends. This was considered sensational at the time, and the arrangement was not seen again till the late seventies. The use of the engine-gearbox unit as a stressed member became more usual. Brakes were dual single-leading shoe (SLS), front and rear. The 55.5 in wheelbase was three inches (76 mm) shorter than the Series A, and its dimensions were more like a 500 cc bike of the time.|$|E
5000|$|The {{high power}} {{meant that the}} gearbox and clutch did not cope well. and it was {{developed}} into the ‘Series B’ which had internal oil pipes and the gearbox integrated with the engine <b>casting</b> (<b>Unit</b> Construction). The angle between the cylinders was increased to 50° instead of the 47.5° of the Series A engine, which allowed {{the use of the}} engine as part of the frame. The Rapide had ‘’Girdraulic’’ front forks and triangulated rear springing to prevent front end twist under hard braking. and the cantilever rear became the most widely used form of rear suspension for motorcycles after 1980. Brakes were dual 7 in single-leading shoe (SLS), front and rear. A more modern hydraulic shock absorber and spring assembly later replaced the old twin springs and friction damper. The rear seat was supported by a sub-frame down to the rear frame pivot point, providing a semi-sprung seat with 6 in of suspension.|$|E

40|$|The {{control and}} {{minimization}} of non-metallic inclusions {{content in the}} tundish and in the mold of a continuous <b>casting</b> <b>unit</b> is crucial for ensuring the final quality of the steel cast product. Nonmetallic inclusions of sizes smaller than 15 µm are hard to remove, as they are difficult to float. They are easily carried by the flow of steel melt into the mold and adversely affect the steel cleanliness. It is suggested that a gas curtain made of small bubbles of argon {{can be used to}} capture and remove these inclusions in the tundish, thus avoiding their transport into the mold. A 1 : 3 scale physical model of tundish of the continuous <b>casting</b> <b>unit</b> of ArcelorMittal plant, in Vitória, Brazil, was built to investigate the effects of gas flow, shape and positioning of the gas curtain inside the tundish, on the efficiency of removal of inclusions. The results suggest that the gas bubbling inside the tundish can be effective in inclusion removal. The efficiency is dependent upon the location of argon bubbling.

Defect free castings with minimum production cost have become the need of foundry. The gating and riser system design plays an important role in the quality. Due to the lack of existing theoretical procedures the designing processes are normally carried on a trial-and-error basis. This paper review casting produced by foundry with internal shrinkage as a major defect was analyzed and identified that gating and risering system was improperly designed. The designed gating system reduced defect and increase yield. Finally, a more reasonable gating system was obtained by analysis of simulation results...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess manual handling of oxygen cylinders by casting workers and to implement ergonomic intervention to reduce the risk of musculoskeletal disorders.. Material and Method: This is an interventional study conducted among 18 male workers of a steel <b>casting</b> <b>unit.</b> Assessment of manual handling of oxygen cylinders, was done using in order Snook tables. The manual handling of oxygen cylinders was changed to mechanical handling and making a box with the capacity of 16 oxygen cylinders which can be moved by crane.. Result: According to the results, lifting and lowering cylinders was not suitable for most of the workers. Moreover, caring, pulling and pushing was suitable for less than 10 percent of the workers. Condition of lifting cylinders by fire workers was suitable only 25 percent of them. According to the snook tables {{material handling}} activities must be suitable for at least 75 percent of workers..

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Over recent years, aluminium composite materials have attracted increasing interest as potential candidates for replacing conventional monolithic alloys {{in a variety of}} structural applications where the weight of structural materials is critical. However, the lack of a satisfactory and cost effective technique, especially for the production of complex shaped aluminium MMC components, has prohibited widespread commercial use of these materials. This is a main driving force behind the performance of the present research which had the following two main objectives:- 1) The development of a novel casting technique based on the use of an EPS pattern mould and a counter-gravity mould filling. This involved the design and manufacture of a special <b>casting</b> <b>unit.</b> 2) The evaluation of the proposed casting technique compared with a gravity pouring EPC method through a series of casting trials using both a Duralcan (reinforced with 15 vo!. ...|$|E
30|$|The LPDC {{machine unit}} {{employed}} {{here is a}} vertical cold chamber die <b>casting</b> <b>unit.</b> The wheel casting {{coming out of the}} LPDC unit is quenched in water and is sent for checking internal casting defects in the non-destructive x-ray checking machine. After non-destructive x-ray check, the alloy wheel casting then follows the gate-cutting process, heat treatment, shot-blasting, CNC machining and air-leak testing. After air-leak test depending on the product requirement the alloy wheel is either sent to the paint line or sent to the Chrome Plating Plant. The paint line mainly consists of degreasing the machined alloy wheel, deoxidizing, conversion coating, pre-heating in dry-off oven, color coating and packing and dispatch. On the other hand, the machined wheels entering the Chrome Plating Plant are subjected to rigorous surface finish improvement by buffing operation. After this it enters the chrome plating process which consists of the copper plating line followed by chrome plating line.|$|E
