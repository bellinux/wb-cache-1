5|$|In {{the early}} 1940s Babb joined <b>Cox</b> <b>and</b> Underwood, {{a company that}} {{obtained}} the rights to poorly made or otherwise unmarketable films of subjects that were potentially controversial or shocking. It would often remove entire sections of these films and add material such as medical reels that lent itself to sensational promotion. Babb went {{on the road with}} a <b>Cox</b> <b>and</b> Underwood concoction titled Dust to Dust, a reworking of High School Girl with a childbirth scene added to the end. Its profits allowed <b>Cox</b> <b>and</b> Underwood to retire from the business, leaving Babb to start his own company, Hygienic Productions. He opened it near his childhood home in Wilmington, Ohio, and hired booking agents and advance salesmen along with out-of-work actors and comedians to present repackaged films and new features.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs (NSAIDs) are {{a family}} of <b>COX</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>COX</b> 2 inhibitors used to reduce the synthesis of pro-inflammatory mediators. In addition, inflammation often leads to a harmful generation of nitric oxide. Efforts are being done in discovering safer NSAIDs molecules capable of inhibiting the synthesis of pro-inflammatory lipid mediators and nitric oxide to reduce the side effects associated with long term therapies. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The analogue of arachidonic acid (AA), 2 -hydroxy-arachidonic acid (2 OAA), was designed to inhibit the activities of <b>COX</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>COX</b> 2 <b>and</b> it was predicted to have similar binding energies as AA for the catalytic sites of <b>COX</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>COX</b> 2. The interaction of AA and 2 OAA with <b>COX</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>COX</b> 2 was investigated calculating the free energy of binding and the Fukui function. Toxicity was determined in mouse microglial BV- 2 cells. <b>COX</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>COX</b> 2 (PGH 2 production) activities were measured in vitro. <b>COX</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>COX</b> 2 expression in human macrophage-like U 937 cells were carried out by Western blot, immunocytochemistry and RT-PCR analysis. NO production (Griess method) and iNOS (Western blot) were determined in mouse microglial BV- 2 cells. The comparative efficacy of 2 OAA, ibuprofen and cortisone in lowering TNF-α serum levels was determined in C 57 BL 6 /J mice challenged with LPS. We show {{that the presence of}} the -OH group reduces the likelihood of 2 OAA being subjected to H* abstraction in COX, without altering significantly the free energy of binding. The 2 OAA inhibited <b>COX</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>COX</b> 2 activities <b>and</b> the expression of COX 2 in human U 937 derived macrophages challenged with LPS. In addition, 2 OAA inhibited iNOS expression and the production of NO in BV- 2 microglial cells. Finally, oral administration of 2 OAA decreased the plasma TNF-α levels in vivo. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: These findings demonstrate the potential of 2 OAA as a NSAID...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine the modulatory in vitro effects of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) on isolated Leydig cells of adult alpaca (Lama pacos) testis. We first evaluated the presence of GnRH receptor (GnRHR) <b>and</b> cyclooxygenase (<b>COX)</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>COX</b> 2 in alpaca testis. We then studied the in vitro effects of buserelin (GnRH analogue), antide (GnRH antagonist), and buserelin plus antide or inhibitor of phospholipase C (compound 48 / 80) <b>and</b> <b>COXs</b> (acetylsalicylic acid) on the production of testosterone, PGE 2, and PGF 2 and on the enzymatic activities of <b>COX</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>COX</b> 2. Immunoreactivity for GnRHR was detected in the cytoplasm of Leydig cells and in the acrosomal region of spermatids. <b>COX</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>COX</b> 2 immunosignals were noted in the cytoplasm of spermatogonia, spermatocytes, spermatids, Leydig cells, and Sertoli cells. Western blot analysis confirmed the GnRHR <b>and</b> <b>COX</b> 1 presence in alpaca testis. The in vitro experiments showed that buserelin alone increased (P 0. 01) and antide and buserelin plus acetylsalicylic acid decreased (P 0. 01) testosterone and PGF 2 production <b>and</b> <b>COX</b> 1 activity, whereas antide and compound 48 / 80 counteracted buserelin effects. Prostaglandin E 2 production <b>and</b> <b>COX</b> 2 activity were not affected by buserelin or antide. These data suggest that GnRH directly up-regulates testosterone production in Leydig cells of adult alpaca testis with a postreceptorial mechanism that involves PLC, <b>COX</b> 1, <b>and</b> PGF 2...|$|R
