40|$|DE 102008027524 B 3 UPAB: 20090928 NOVELTY - The {{laser cutting}} unit is moved conventionally, {{relative}} to the workpiece (1. 4). In a novel arrangement, the cutting nozzle (1. 3) fastened to the cutting head (1) can also be moved in two axial directions, parallel {{to the surface of}} the workpiece. This additional movement is caused by a separate drive system. The new arrangement increases the working area of the laser cutter. The focusing optic (1. 2) is a telecentric planar field optic and/or a telecentric F-theta optic. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The cutting nozzle rotates about an axis directed at right angles to the workpiece surface. The rotational axis of the nozzle, or of its opening, is located eccentrically with respect to the longitudinal axis of the cutting head. An eccentric drive moves the cutting nozzle. A double-eccentric drive is used, with two drive motors. These are independently-controlled. The eccentric drives are connected. They are arranged one inside the other, or one above the other. Through combined nozzle movement and beam (10) deflection, the operational area achieved on the workpiece reaches at least 7 mm 2. The cutting nozzle is alternatively moved by two independently-controlled linear drives. The drives used are: moving coil, pneumatic or hydraulic. The linear drives act on the cutting nozzle from the radial exterior of the unit, and are articulated to it. The laser beam and <b>cutting</b> <b>gas</b> are directed through the nozzle onto the workpiece. The nozzle opening is circular, elliptical or slot-shaped. The nozzle is held by a cross-slide assembly with linear drives to each slide. The beam deflection includes an oscillatory motion. AN INDEPENDENT CLAIM IS INCLUDED FOR the corresponding laser cutting method. USE - Agile laser cutting equipment with a mirror deflecting the focused beam. ADVANTAGE - By superimposing mechanical and optical deflections, variation of cutting direction can be achieved with smaller radii. This accelerates the cutting operation, increasing production and saving <b>cutting</b> <b>gas.</b> At the same time, stressing of the equipment by accelerations and torques is reduced. Wear is reduced and equipment life is extended. Movements of individual drives become smoother. Agility is increased without increase in the size of the gas opening, so <b>cutting</b> <b>gas</b> is conserved. The additional drives permit simpler optics to be used if required. This minimizes cost. Advantages of differing types of nozzle drives are discussed further in the disclosure. Gas flow is readily matched with the cutting requirement and either conical-cylindrical or Laval nozzles can be used...|$|E

40|$|The {{quality of}} cuts {{performed}} on titanium sheets using high tolerance plasma arc cutting (HTPAC) process was investigated underdifferent process conditions. A 5 mm thick sheet of grade 2 commercially pure titanium was cut using several feed {{rates in the}} dross-free feed rate range and with the adoption of oxygen or nitrogen as cutting and shielding gases. When oxygen was used as <b>cutting</b> <b>gas</b> higher feed rate and geometry attributes (unevenness and kerf width) of better quality were achieved due to the oxidation reaction. The quality features of {{the cutting edge of}} HTPAC of commercially pure titanium were integrated with considerations on microstructural features related to the formation of a wide layer severely affected by plasma-induced thermal cycle and by interaction with the <b>cutting</b> <b>gas.</b> In fact, all cutting edges displayed an external layer of oxide, under which a thin layer of oxygen-enriched -case was noticed for cuts performed with oxygen. The thickness of the total heat affected zone (HAZ) overcame 1 mm for all the cuts in nitrogen and for the slowest cut in oxygen. Temperature measurements during the passage of the torch defined the thermal cycles of the cutting process in several locations of the sheet. These are characterised by high heating rates (above 2000 K/s within the HAZ) and low cooling rates (150 – 580 K/s within the HAZ). An analytical model was applied to simulate the thermal effects of the material interaction with the torch in the case of slow cuts with oxygen. A comparison between predicted thermal cycles, experimental measurements and microstructural observations confirmed the reliability of the estimation in terms of extension of microstructural modifications...|$|E
