40|$|Abstract Due to {{the limited}} supply of mental health {{services}} for Afro-Colombian victims of violence, a Common Elements Treatment Approach (CETA) intervention has been implemented in the Colombian Pacific. Given the importance of improvement in mental health interventions for this population, it is necessary to characterize this process. This article seeks to describe the implementation of CETA for Afro-Colombian victims of violence in Buenaventura and Quibdó, Colombia through case studieswith individual in-depth interviews <b>with</b> <b>Lay</b> Psychosocial Community <b>Workers</b> (LPCW), supervisors, and coordinators responsible for implementing CETA.

Afro-Colombian culturalapproach and 6. Strategies to promote users&# 8217; well-being. Colombian Pacific&# 8217;s scenario implies several factors, such as the active armed conflict, economic crisis, and lack of mental health care resources, affecting the implementation process and the intervention effects. This implies the need to establish and strengthen partnerships between institutions in order to administer necessary mental health care for victims of violence in the Colombian Pacific...|$|R

It has often been suggested that col-ony-level productivity costs may outweigh the fitness advantages of worker reproduction, but this has never been shown. We estimated these costs in two ant species with large complex societies, the leafcutter ants Acromyrmex echinatior and Acromyrmex octospinosus, by splitting 16 laboratory colonies and comparing the dynamics of the fungus garden volume between orphaned and queenright nests (<b>with</b> and without <b>laying</b> <b>workers,</b> respectively). Apart from fungus volume as a longitudinal measure of colony productivity, we estimated sex allocation, the timing of the switch between raising queen offspring and worker sons, and differences in body mass between queen and worker sons. We showed that orphaned nests give pri-ority to raising dispersing queen-derived sexuals (virgin queens, haploid and diploid queen sons) over rais-ing worker sons. Worker sons could be heavier than, equally heavy as, or lighter than queen sons, depending on the condition of the colony. The reduction in colony productivity of orphaned nests com-pared to their queenright counterparts was negligible (1. 2 %), at least during the first 9 weeks after queen loss when these costs could be estimated. Such low costs could only outweigh the benefit of <b>worker</b> <b>laying</b> if the survival of worker sons is low, for example if workers show efficient worker policing, or discriminate against all male brood outside the brief reproductive season...|$|R

Methods We conducted a feasibility study of a 14 -week automated telephonic interactive voice response (IVR) depression self-care service among Bolivian primary care patients with at least moderately severe depressive symptoms. We analyzed IVR call completion rates, {{the reliability and validity}} of IVR-collected data, and participant satisfaction. Results Of the 32 participants, the majority were women (78  % or 25 / 32) and non-indigenous (75  % or 24 / 32). Participants had moderate depressive symptoms at baseline (PHQ- 8 score mean 13. 3, SD =  3. 5) and reported good or fair general health status (88  % or 28 / 32). Fifty-four percent of weekly IVR calls (approximately 7 out of 13 active call-weeks) were completed. Neither PHQ- 8 scores nor IVR call completion differed significantly by ethnicity, education, self-reported depression diagnosis, self-reported overall health, number of chronic conditions, or health literacy. The reliability for IVR-collected PHQ- 8 scores was good (Cronbach’s alpha =  0. 83). Virtually every participant (97  %) was “mostly” or “very” satisfied with the program. Many described the program as beneficial for their mood and self-care, albeit limited by some technological difficulties and the lack of human interaction. Conclusion Findings suggest that IVR could feasibly be used to provide monitoring and self-care education to depressed patients in Bolivia.

50|$|Army ants can forage {{and feed}} on insects over {{large areas of}} more than 1,800 square yards in a single day, so they must {{constantly}} move to new areas.

Thousands of larvae are located near the centre with the queen, and workers are responsible for feeding them. Larger workers also serve as porters, carrying larvae to new bivouacs.

40|$|The size (e. g. length, {{width and}} volume) {{and the weight}} of eggs laid by A. mellifera caucasica queens (Qs) and <b>laying</b> <b>workers</b> (LWs) in both worker cells (WC) and in drone cells (DC) were compared. All {{measurements}} were taken at 3 different embryonic developmental periods (at 0 – 6 h, 18 – 24 h and 54 – 60 h after oviposition). The results showed that the size and weight of fertilized (in WC) and unfertilized (in DC) eggs laid by queens did not differ significantly. However, eggs from <b>laying</b> <b>workers</b> were 2. 8 % longer and 10. 7 % wider, they had as much as 22. 2 % larger volume and they were 22. 3 % heavier compared to eggs laid by queens. Thus, eggs from A. m. caucasica <b>laying</b> <b>workers</b> were larger and heavier than from queens. Significant decrease of size and weight occurred during embryonic development. Shortly before hatching, eggs from queens and workers lost 5. 4 % and 6. 4 % of their length, 8. 9 % and 9. 1 % of their width, 16. 4 % and 16. 9 % of their volume and 28. 1 % and 24. 2 % of their weight, respectively.

40|$|One of the {{consequences}} of massive investment in antiretroviral access and other AIDS programmes has been the rapid emergence of large numbers of <b>lay</b> <b>workers</b> in the health systems of developing countries. In South Africa, government estimates are 65, 000, mostly HIV/TB care-related <b>lay</b> <b>workers</b> contribute their labour in the public health sector, outnumbering the main front-line primary health care providers and professional nurses. The phenomenon has grown organically and incrementally, playing a wide variety of care-giving, support and advocacy roles. Using South Africa as a case, this paper discusses the different forms, traditions and contradictory orientations taken by lay health work and the system-wide effects of a large <b>lay</b> <b>worker</b> presence. As pressures to regularise and formalise the status of <b>lay</b> health <b>workers</b> grow, important questions are raised as to their place in health systems, and more broadly what they represent as a new intermediary layer between state and citizen. It argues for a research agenda that seeks to better characterise types of lay involvement in the health system, particularly in an era of antiretroviral therapy, and which takes a wider perspective on the meanings of this recent re-emergence of an old concept in health systems heavily affected by HIV/AIDS.

We aimed to pilot a low-cost multi-component 'Friendship Bench Intervention' for CMD, locally adapted from problem-solving therapy and delivered by trained and supervised female <b>lay</b> <b>workers</b> to learn if was feasible and possibly effective {{as well as how}} best to implement it on a larger scale. Method We trained <b>lay</b> <b>workers</b> for 8 days in screening and monitoring CMD and in delivering the intervention. Ten <b>lay</b> <b>workers</b> screened consecutive adult attenders who either were referred or self-referred to the Friendship Bench between July and December 2007. Those scoring above the validated cut-point of the Shona Symptom Questionnaire (SSQ) for CMD were potentially eligible. Exclusions were suicide risk or very severe depression. All others were offered 6 sessions of problem-solving therapy (PST) enhanced with a component of activity scheduling. Weekly nurse-led group supervision and monthly supervision from a mental health specialist were provided. Data on SSQ scores at 6 weeks after entering the study were collected by an independent research nurse. <b>Lay</b> <b>workers</b> completed a brief evaluation on their experiences of delivering the intervention. Results Of 395 potentially eligible, 33 (8 %) were excluded due to high risk. Of the 362 left, 2 % (7) declined and 10 % (35) were lost to follow-up leaving an 88 % response rate (n = 320). Over half (n = 166, 52 %) had presented with an HIV-related problem. Mean SSQ score fell from 11. 3 (sd 1. 4) before treatment to 6. 5 (sd 2. 4) after 3 - 6 sessions. The drop in SSQ scores was proportional to the number of sessions attended. Nine of the ten <b>lay</b> <b>workers</b> rated themselves as very able to deliver the PST intervention.
