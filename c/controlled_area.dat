To detect a leak in the steam generator and thus the passage of radioactive water at an early stage, an activity meter is mounted to track the outlet steam of the steam generator. In contrast, boiling water reactors pass radioactive water through the steam turbine, so the turbine is kept as part of the radiologically <b>controlled</b> <b>area</b> of the nuclear power station.|$|E

25|$|Hamilcar Barca, who {{commanded}} the Carthaginian land forces from 247 BC to 241 BC, probably lacked the manpower {{to take on}} the Roman armies stationed in Sicily. So instead of fighting pitched battles, he simply placed his camp on an unassailable position near the Roman <b>controlled</b> <b>area</b> and launched a harassment campaign. Hamilcar won several minor victories, shrugged off failures and with his immunity to defeat, kept the Carthaginian cause alive. After six years of harassment, the bankrupt and near exhausted Roman state borrowed money from its citizens to create a fleet and defeated the Carthaginians at sea to end the First Punic War.|$|E
25|$|The Vance-Owen {{plan was}} {{presented}} in January 1993. It was planned to create 10 cantons on {{the territory of the}} whole of Bosnia and Herzegovina. This plan increased conflict between Croats and Bosniaks. The Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH) launched four offensives and conquered a large area which was under control of HVO; almost the whole Central Bosnia (except Novi Travnik, Vitez, Busovača, Kiseljak, Kreševo and Žepče and the wider areas around those towns and Usora, part of Municipality of Travnik, Zavidovići and part of Municipality of Vareš) and part of Herzegovina, Konjic, Jablanica and eastern and northern parts of Mostar. A number of crimes against civilians were committed on both sides. Hostility between Croats and Bosniaks ended with mediation by the United States and the signing of the Washington Agreement on 18 March 1994. The cooperation between Croats and Bosniaks was renewed, and the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, a Bosniak and Croat <b>controlled</b> <b>area</b> was established. There was also a proposal to create a confederation of Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Republic of Croatia.|$|E
25|$|Reintroduction of extirpated native species, such as {{the swift}} fox, is another issue that must be {{balanced}} with the needs and tolerances of existing species. Other extirpated species that formerly occupied the grasslands were the bison (Bison bison), wolf (Canis lupus) and grizzly bear (Ursus arctos horribilis), {{which may not be}} feasible to reintroduce due to cost and potential conflict with humans. Educational and scientific pursuits require guidelines and permits to protect the landscape from inadvertent damage such as collection of rare species or archaeological samples. Extraction of natural resources such as minerals, gas, oil, and coal are incompatible with the management intent of the protected area, as are linear developments such as roads, pipelines and power lines. As such, only freehold areas may be explored for resource extraction, and no new linear developments are planned; however, construction of a viewing area is being considered to limit and concentrate public access to an approved and <b>controlled</b> <b>area.</b> Fencing and signage, used for public safety and resource protection, are also kept to a minimum.|$|E
30|$|The {{development}} of the prediction formula aims at quickly dividing the injection–production <b>control</b> <b>area.</b> In order to validate the feasibility and accuracy of this prediction formula, we apply this prediction formula to predict the ratio of injection–production <b>control</b> <b>area</b> for a synthetic reservoir model. Then the ratio of injection–production <b>control</b> <b>area</b> for a synthetic reservoir model is also calculated by streamline numerical simulator. If the results calculated by the two methods match well, it means that this prediction formula {{can be used to}} predict the ratio of injection–production <b>control</b> <b>area</b> without running streamline numerical simulator.|$|R
30|$|Now, we {{identify}} two distinct cases. First, {{the case where}} all <b>control</b> <b>areas</b> {{are affected by the}} same attack signal and then, the case where the attack signal differs from one <b>control</b> <b>area</b> to another. The scenario where the adversary affects only some <b>control</b> <b>areas</b> and not all of them falls under the second case, where some α _i = 0.|$|R

25|$|The RPF renewed its {{civil war}} against the Rwanda Hutu {{government}} when it received word that the genocidal massacres had begun. Its leader Paul Kagame directed RPF forces in neighboring countries such as Uganda and Tanzania to invade the country, but here, Paul Kagame did not direct RPF Forces from neighbouring countries because RPF was already in Rwanda {{for three years and}} half battling the Hutu forces and Interahamwe militias who were committing the massacres. The resulting civil war raged concurrently with the genocide for two months. The Tutsi-led RPF continued to advance on the capital, and soon occupied the northern, eastern, and southern parts of the country by June. Thousands of additional civilians were killed in the conflict. UN member states refused to answer UNAMIR's requests for increased troops and money. The remaining part of the country not under RPF control was occupied by France in Operation Turquoise. While the French operation did prevent mass killings it has been alleged that the deployment of French troops was intended to allow the Hutu militias to escape, and that the slaughter of Tutsis continued in the French <b>controlled</b> <b>area.</b>|$|E
25|$|Following the {{fighting}} around Wide Bay and Open Bay, the Australian advance essentially {{came to an}} end, although limited offensive action continued up {{until the end of}} the war. They had effectively secured the island to the west of the Gazelle Peninsula, isolating the 93,000-strong garrison around Rabaul. For the remainder of the war, patrol actions were used to maintain the initiative and hold the defensive line that was established across the island between the two lodgements at Open Bay and Wide Bay; in May the 37th/52nd Infantry Battalion marched across the island to the Mavelo Plantation from where they were ferried by barge to Open Bay to relieve the 36th Infantry. No further advances were attempted as the Allies focused their main operations elsewhere, such as Borneo and the Philippines. In addition, engineers worked to improve the road system around the secured plantations. Refugees from the Japanese <b>controlled</b> <b>area</b> moved into the Wide Bay and Open Bay areas and were subsequently recruited by the Australian New Guinea Administrative Unit for labouring tasks. Australian operations on the island were constrained by shortages of shipping and air support as these resources were redirected largely to efforts to secure Borneo; these shortages delayed the concentration of the 5th Division considerably and it was not until April that the 5th Division had completed its movements, with the arrival of the 4th and 13th Infantry Brigades being followed by the 2/2nd Commando Squadron.|$|E

On 14 April the battalion advanced through Celle and {{spent the night in}} nearby woods and on 15 April whilst moving to the village of Nettelkamp, east of Uelzen, they were bombed by Jet planes. The 2nd Ox and Bucks encountered heavy enemy resistance at Kahlstorf, near Emern, on 16–17 April and sustained 25 casualties; there were many enemy bomb attacks and the battalion then moved to the hamlet of Gross Pretzier. The battalion moved through Rosche then Katzien and were at Ebstorf from 23 April to 29 April. After leaving Ebstorf on foot, D Company 2nd Ox and Bucks took over as the spearhead of the British Army's advance across Northern Germany. A few miles north of Ebstorf D Company 2nd Ox and Bucks discovered a satellite of Bergen Belsen concentration camp. They were ordered to continue to pursue the enemy; the camp guards had already fled. The 2nd Ox and Bucks crossed the River Elbe on 30 April and the advance continued through Nostorf, Schwartow and Lutterstorf to Bad Kleinen, {{on the banks of the}} Schweriner See. On 2 May 1945 2nd Ox and Bucks moved eastwards along the same routes that units of the German army complete with heavy tanks, troop carriers and heavy artillery were travelling westwards determined to surrender to the British army and escape from the Soviet army. Many German soldiers and refugees were unable to move to the British army <b>controlled</b> <b>area</b> and were forced into Soviet captivity. The battalion linked up with the Soviet Red Army near the Baltic port of Wismar on 3 May 1945.|$|E

The Spanish AGC system regulates the frequency and the power exchange between France and Spain. The system is hierarchically structured with one master regulator that coordinates four <b>control</b> <b>areas.</b> Each <b>control</b> <b>area</b> is composed of several generating units providing AGC service. Coordinating signals are sent to the <b>control</b> <b>areas</b> so that the global system response achieves the objective established by the System Operator. The participation of each <b>control</b> <b>area</b> in the service is set according to the rated share that it has obtained in the secondary-reserve market and its relative response speed {{compared to that of}} the rest of the <b>control</b> <b>areas.</b> Some problems, such as the lack of sensitivity to the quality of the reserve provided by the <b>control</b> <b>areas,</b> have been detected in the operation of the current AGC scheme.
