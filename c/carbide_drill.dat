40|$|AbstractINTRODUCTIONThe {{removal of}} well-fixed broken femoral {{component}} and cement mantle {{can be extremely}} demanding, time consuming and potentially damaging to the host bone. Different methods have been described to extract broken femoral stem yet this {{remains one of the}} most challenging prospect to the revision hip surgeon. PRESENTATION OF CASEThe authors present two cases underwent a modified sliding cortical window technique utilising a tungsten <b>carbide</b> <b>drill,</b> Charnley pin retractor and an orthopaedic mallet to aid extraction of a fractured cemented femoral stem in revision total hip arthroplasty. DISCUSSIONThe modified technique offers a simple and controlled method in extracting a well fixed fractured cemented femoral stem. It has the advantage of retaining the cement mantle with subsequent good seal of the femoral cortical window secured with cable ready system. Furthermore, tungsten <b>carbide</b> <b>drill</b> bit and Charnley pin retractor are relatively readily available to aid the extraction of the broken stem. Finally, it yields the option of implanting a standard femoral stem and obviates the need for bypassing the cortical window with long revision femoral component. CONCLUSIONFractured femoral stem is a rare yet a complex and very demanding prospect to both patients and hip surgeons. The sliding cortical window technique utilising tungsten <b>carbide</b> <b>drill</b> and Charnley pin retractor is technically easy and most importantly; preserves host bone stock with cement-in-cement revision hip arthroplasty. We believe this technique can be added to the armamentarium of revision hip surgeon when faced with the challenge of extracting a fractured cemented femoral stem...|$|E
40|$|This thesis work is {{performed}} at Sandvik Mining Rock Tools, a world leading supplier of rock drilling tools. The work {{is part of}} developing a new tribological wear test method for cemented <b>carbide</b> <b>drill</b> bit inserts. The test method has earlier been judged successful in mimicking the rotary-percussive rock drilling process because it gives the same wear mechanisms as have been observed for inserts used in rock drilling. During testing the cemented <b>carbide</b> <b>drill</b> bit insert is pressed against a moving rock surface while water and particles {{are added to the}} contact area. The particles are present to simulate the rock crushings formed during drilling. They are believed to cause abrasive wear of the inserts. In this work the effect of load, particle material and particle size are studied. When adding silica particles, which are softer than the cemented carbide material, no correlation is obtained between wear rate and load or particle size. Cracking of WC grains, added rock material and removal of pieces of carbide material are seen at the worn sample surfaces. These observations are similar to observations described in other works about wear of cemented carbide. Adding alumina particles, which are harder than the sample material, gives high wear rate and ground/striped sample surfaces. The wear rate increases with alumina particle size...|$|E

The most common problems of CFRP/metal stacks machining are CFRP delamination, fiber pull ? out, thermal degradation and intensive tool wear. Last decade such parameters of CFRP/metal stacks drilling as axial force and torque are in the focus of researches. However, the cutting temperature in the drilling process of CFRP/metal stack and its influence on drill bit wear is still not fully gained at the present time. The purpose of current study is to investigate the effect of cutting temperature on the tool life of <b>carbide</b> <b>drill.</b> The temperature was measured with K type thermocouple which was embedded on the flank surface of the drill. Axial force was measured with dynamometer. Data of cutting temperature and axial force was digitalized with analog - digital converter (ACD) and visualized on personal computer (PC).
