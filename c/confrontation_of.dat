5|$|Even though Maryland did not {{secede from}} the Union, Steuart's loyalty lay with the South, as did {{that of his}} father. He {{commanded}} one of the Baltimore city militias during the riot of April 1861, following which Federal troops occupied Baltimore, an incident which was arguably the first armed <b>confrontation</b> <b>of</b> the Civil War.|$|E
5|$|A {{survival}} horror storyline {{usually involves}} {{the investigation and}} <b>confrontation</b> <b>of</b> horrific forces, and thus many games transform common elements from horror fiction into gameplay challenges. Early releases utilized camera angles seen in horror films, which allowed enemies to lurk {{in areas that are}} concealed from the player's view. Also, many survival horror games make use of off-screen sound or other warning cues to notify the player of impending danger. This feedback assists the player, but also creates feelings of anxiety and uncertainty.|$|E

5|$|Santa Santita, or Magdalena, The Unholy Saint, is a 2004 Filipino film {{starring}} Angelica Panganiban and Jericho Rosales, {{directed by}} Laurice Guillen. The film follows Malen, {{the daughter of}} an intercessor, her love affair with a hustler and gigolo, and her <b>confrontation</b> <b>of</b> the evil within her life. Based on a script by Jerry Gracio, the film was picked up by Guillen in 2000 but did not start production because an appropriate actress for Malen could not be found. After picking Panganiban, Guillen began work, and the eventual film was released on November 17, 2004, in the Philippines and March 11, 2005, internationally. Receiving good reviews from Variety and the Philippine Daily Inquirer, Santa Santita was one of only two films to be rated as Grade A by the Cinema Evaluation Board of the Philippines, and represented the Philippines at the Asiaticafilmediale festival in Italy and the Bangkok International Film Festival.|$|E
5|$|Similar to the Moor-Christian <b>confrontation</b> <b>of</b> the morisca—whether in Spain or in transplanted {{versions}} in Central America—there {{are also}} elaborate ritual dances in Mexico {{such as the}} Danza de la Pluma that exploit {{the trauma of the}} Spanish conquest of indigenous America. Weapons employed may be swords (and shields) whips, even firearms. These representations take place over a large area of Mesoamerica and, in part, are an obvious adaptation of Spanish tradition, but in Mexico will pit the native Aztec against the Spanish invader. The most interesting aspect of these dances is that—depending on where one sees them and under what conditions—it is plausible to read into the dances an outcome other than the historical Spanish victory. That is, indigenous performers may take inspiration {{from the fact that the}} natives of Spain drove out the Moorish invaders; thus, the natives of Mesoamerica, too, shall one day drive out the invaders.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} the Crusades in general, and {{particularly}} that of the First Crusade, is widely debated among historians. The confusion is partially due to the numerous armies in the first crusade, and their lack of direct unity. The similar ideologies held the armies to similar goals, but the connections were rarely strong, and the unity broke down often. The Crusades are most commonly linked to {{the political and social}} situation in 11th-century Europe, the rise of a reform movement within the papacy, and the political and religious <b>confrontation</b> <b>of</b> Christianity and Islam in Europe and the Middle East. Christianity had spread throughout Europe, Africa, and the Middle East in Late Antiquity, but by the early 8th century Christian rule had become limited to Europe and Anatolia after the Muslim conquests.|$|E

5|$|Tragic {{though they}} were for the Byzantines at the time, the defeat at Anzen and the {{subsequent}} sack of Amorion were militarily of no long-term importance to the Empire, since the Abbasids failed {{to follow up on}} their success. They did, however, {{play a crucial role in}} discrediting iconoclasm, which had always relied on military success to maintain its validity. Shortly after Theophilos's sudden death in 842, the veneration of icons was restored as part of the Triumph of Orthodoxy throughout the Empire. The Battle of Anzen is also notable for illustrating the difficulties faced by the Byzantine military of the time against horse-archers, a remarkable change from the army of the 6th–7th centuries, when such skills formed a core part of Byzantine tactical doctrine. It is also remarkable for being the first <b>confrontation</b> <b>of</b> the middle Byzantine army with the Turkic nomads from Central Asia, whose descendants, the Seljuq Turks, would emerge as Byzantium's major antagonists from the mid-11th century on.|$|E
5|$|While Prince Poniatowski and Kościuszko {{considered}} {{the outcome of}} the war still open, and were planning to use the combined Polish-Lithuanian forces to defeat the still separate Russian forces, King Poniatowski, with the consent of the Guardians of the Laws (cabinet of ministers) decided to ask for a ceasefire. Tsarina Catherine demanded that the King Poniatowski joins the pro-Russian aristocratic faction, the Targowica Confederation; with his cabinet split, he gave in to her demand around 22–23 July, which effectively forced Prince Poniatowski to terminate military resistance. The last military <b>confrontation</b> <b>of</b> the war was fought on 26 July at Markuszów in Lublin province, where an enemy attack was repelled by Polish cavalry led by Poniatowski.|$|E

50|$|Abraham Lincoln {{considered}} Indian affairs a {{low priority}} {{when compared to}} the secession crisis. Lincoln's administration focused their efforts on American military <b>confrontations</b> <b>of</b> early 1861. They had little time to consider the Indian's role in the coming conflict. However, certain general attitudes protrude and explains the administrations' ambivalence toward the Indian.|$|R

50|$|The <b>confrontations</b> <b>of</b> {{the pirates}} with the crews rarely escalate, {{with a single}} shipman murder recorded, in late-2000s. This is, in part, because crews will often {{cooperate}} with the pirates, sell part of the cargo, then report the piracy {{in order to receive}} insurance money. Cases of cooperation of the pirates with the police have also been recorded.|$|R
40|$|To date, little {{research}} has explored the utility <b>of</b> inter-personal <b>confrontation</b> as a strategy for the reduction of homonegative attitudes and/or behaviours among heterosexual women. Consequently, {{the purpose of the}} current study was to explore three unique aspects <b>of</b> such <b>confrontations</b> among a sample of heterosexual women from the University of Saskatchewan. These three aspects were: 1) to what extent do high- and low-prejudiced women’s reactions to <b>confrontations</b> <b>of</b> subtle homonegative behaviour differ; 2) what differences exist in the way that heterosexual women respond to bias directed towards gay men than to bias directed towards lesbian women; 3) what effect does the vested interest of a confronter have on heterosexual women’s reaction to <b>confrontations</b> <b>of</b> homonegative behaviour. A 2 (target condition) X 2 (modern homonegativity endorsement) X 4 (confronter type) between-subjects design was used wherein 286 female volunteers completed a questionnaire booklet developed for the project. The questionnaire booklet asked participants to first imagine themselves in a scenario where they would be confronted for engaging in subtle homonegative behaviour and to then indicated how they would think, feel, and behave in response to such a confrontation. The results indicated that low-prejudice participants reacted with greater negative-self directed affect (e. g., guilt) and compunction (e. g., apologize for behaviour) than high-prejudice participants when confronted by either a gay man or lesbian woman. Such reactions are important as they mark the initiation of a self-regulatory cycle that allows the individual to avoid such biased behaviour in the future. Limitations of the study and directions for future research concerning inter-personal <b>confrontations</b> <b>of</b> homonegativity are also presented...|$|R
25|$|The Battle of Bergendal {{had forced}} the Boers {{to abandon their}} hopes of {{achieving}} an outcome through direct, military <b>confrontation</b> <b>of</b> the enemy. But despite their defeats much of the Boer army remained intact, and Botha dispersed his men to Lydenburg and Barberton to begin a new phase of the conflict.|$|E
25|$|A major <b>confrontation</b> <b>of</b> the Bleeding Kansas era was in {{the writing}} of constitutions that would govern the state of Kansas. The first of four such {{documents}} was the 1855 Topeka Constitution, written by antislavery forces unified under the Free State Party. This was the basis for the Free State Territorial government that resisted the illegitimate, but federally authorized government elected by non-resident, and thus unqualified Missourians.|$|E
25|$|One line of {{research}} consistently finds that supposedly different forms of psychotherapy show similar effectiveness—historically dubbed the Dodo bird verdict because all win. Further analyses seek to identify the factors that the psychotherapies have in common that seem to account for this, known as common factors theory; for example {{the quality of the}} therapeutic relationship, interpretation of problem, and the <b>confrontation</b> <b>of</b> painful emotions.|$|E
50|$|The {{campaigns of}} the Argentine Army against Mapuches {{in the other}} side of the Andes pushed in 1880 many Mapuches into Araucanía. Pehuenche chief Purrán was taken {{prisoner}} by the Argentine Army and the Argentine Army penetrated in the valley of Lonquimay which Chile considered part of its legal territory. The fast Argentine advance alarmed Chilean authorities and contributed to the Chilean-Mapuche <b>confrontations</b> <b>of</b> 1881.|$|R

25|$|By early 1869, the insurrection was suppressed, but the Porte {{offered some}} concessions, {{introducing}} island self-rule and increasing Christian rights on the island. Although the Cretan crisis ended {{better for the}} Ottomans {{than almost any other}} diplomatic <b>confrontation</b> <b>of</b> the century, the insurrection, and especially the brutality with which it was suppressed, led to greater public attention in Europe to the oppression of Christians in the Ottoman Empire.|$|E
25|$|The largest <b>confrontation</b> <b>of</b> {{the parties}} {{occurred}} in 30–31 March 1929, in the Battle of Sabilla, where the Ikhwan leadership were killed. The Battle of Sabilla {{was the last}} major battle of camel raiders, thus having an historic importance. It had become a scene of carnage for the technologically mediocre Ikhwan against the cavalry and machine-guns of Ibn Saud's army. In {{the aftermath of the}} battle some 500 Ikhwan tribesmen died, whereas Ibn Saud's losses were about 200.|$|E
25|$|Checkpoint Charlie {{has become}} one of Berlin's primary tourist attractions. An open-air exhibit was opened during the summer of 2006. Gallery walls along the Friedrichstraße and the Zimmerstraße inform on escape attempts, how the {{checkpoint}} was expanded, and its significance during the Cold War, in particular the <b>confrontation</b> <b>of</b> Soviet and American tanks in 1961. An overview of other important memorial sites and museums on the division of Germany and the wall is presented as well.|$|E

40|$|Taking {{action against}} {{discrimination}} has positive consequences for well-being (e. g., Cocking & Drury, 2004) {{but most of}} this {{research has focused on}} collective actions and has used methodologies assessing one point in time. This study therefore used a diary methodology to examine how women’s everyday <b>confrontations</b> <b>of</b> discrimination would affect measures of subjective and psychological well-being, and how these relationships would change over time. In a 28 -day online diary study, women indicated their daily experience of discrimination, described their response, and completed measures of well-being. Results showed that {{at the beginning of the}} study, using indirect confrontation predicted greater well-being than using angered confrontation. However, continued use of indirect and educational confrontation decreased well-being whereas continued use <b>of</b> angered <b>confrontation</b> increased well-being over time. By the end of the study, using angered confrontation predicted greater well-being than using indirect <b>confrontation.</b> Analyses <b>of</b> linguistic markers were consistent with the explicit measures of well-being. Implications for distinguishing between types <b>of</b> <b>confrontations</b> and integrating time analyses are discussed...|$|R
50|$|Since Israel's {{declaration}} of independence in 1948 this state has found itself in nearly continual conflict with the Arab world and some other predominantly Muslim countries. The animosity between the Arabs and the Israelis became a global issue during the 1970s. The Yom Kippur War of 1973, with the supplying of Israel by its Western allies while some Arab states received Soviet supplies, made {{this one of the}} most internationally threatening <b>confrontations</b> <b>of</b> the period.|$|R
