30|$|First, {{in order}} {{to examine the effects of}} the {{condenser}} lens-based solar concentrator on the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs, we varied the focal length of the light pathway in the <b>condenser</b> <b>lens</b> system such that a reference DSSC with an approximately 10 -μm-thick T 25 single layer (T 25 SL) was exposed to various concentrated sunlight conditions, as shown in Figure  1. Here, by simulating the optical geometries in the given <b>condenser</b> <b>lens</b> system, we estimated that the circular area of the focused beam can fully cover a 0.6 [*]×[*] 0.6 cm 2 photoactive layer as long as the optical length is less than 10 mm. Also, when <b>condenser</b> <b>lens</b> system was applied, the temperature measured by a thermocouple installed on top of DSSC was approximately 40 °C or less, in which no additional cooling system was required.|$|R
50|$|Dark {{field and}} phase {{contrast}} setups {{are based on}} an Abbe, aplanatic, or achromatic condenser, but to the light path add a dark field stop or various size phase rings. These additional elements are housed in various ways. In most modern microscope (ca. 1990s-), such elements are housed in sliders that fit into a slot between the illuminator and the <b>condenser</b> <b>lens.</b> Many older microscopes house these elements in a turret-type condenser, these elements are housed in a turret below the <b>condenser</b> <b>lens</b> and rotated into place.|$|R

50|$|A {{cross-section}} (or 'side-view') of {{the optical}} {{components of a}} typical SLR camera shows how the light passes through the lens assembly (1), is reflected by the mirror (2) placed at a 45-degree angle, and is projected on the matte focusing screen (5). Via a <b>condensing</b> <b>lens</b> (6) and internal reflections in the roof pentaprism (7) the image appears in the eyepiece (8). When an image is taken, the mirror moves upwards from its resting position {{in the direction of}} the arrow, the focal plane shutter (3) opens, and the image is projected onto the film or sensor (4) in exactly the same manner as on the focusing screen.|$|E
5000|$|A flat {{piece of}} heat-absorbing glass is often {{placed in the}} light path between the <b>condensing</b> <b>lens</b> and the slide, to avoid {{damaging}} the latter. This glass transmits visible wavelengths but absorbs infrared. Light passes through the transparent slide and lens, and the resulting image is enlarged and projected onto a perpendicular flat screen so the audience can view its reflection. Alternatively, the image may be projected onto a translucent [...] "rear projection" [...] screen, often used for continuous automatic display for close viewing. This form of projection also avoids the audience interrupting the light stream by casting their shadows on the projection or by bumping into the projector.|$|E
25|$|In {{this system}} a {{filament}} {{is located at}} one focus of an ellipsoidal reflector and has a <b>condenser</b> <b>lens</b> {{at the front of}} the lamp. A shade is located at the image plane, between the reflector and lens, and the projection of the top edge of this shade provides the low-beam cutoff. The shape of the shade edge and its exact position in the optical system determine the shape and sharpness of the cutoff. The shade may be lowered by a solenoid actuated pivot to provide low beam, and removed from the light path for high beam. Such optics are known as BiXenon or BiHalogen projectors. If the cutoff shade is fixed in the light path, separate high-beam lamps are required. The <b>condenser</b> <b>lens</b> may have slight fresnel rings or other surface treatments to reduce cutoff sharpness. Modern <b>condenser</b> <b>lenses</b> incorporate optical features specifically designed to direct some light upward towards the locations of retroreflective overhead road signs.|$|R
30|$|The image {{resolution}} limits were examined using a FEI Titan 80 – 300 ETEM operated with a primary electron energy of 300 keV and with 5  mbar N 2 {{added to the}} sample region. At these conditions, an electron-dose-rate-dependent resolution degradation was reported in a previous study [5]. The total dose-rate (beam current) and the areal dose-rate (beam current density) are connected via {{the area of the}} illumination. A change in total dose-rate can be accomplished by changing the illumination area at a fixed areal dose-rate, which in practice is most easily done by changing the condenser aperture. The total dose-rate can also be varied by changing the areal dose-rate for a fixed illumination area, which can be done by changing the first <b>condenser</b> <b>lens,</b> or second gun anode, and compensating for any change in beam size with the lower <b>condenser</b> <b>lenses.</b> Likewise, the areal dose-rate can be changed either by changing the total dose-rate for a fixed illumination area, or by changing the illumination area at a fixed total dose-rate by spreading or contracting the electron beam using the lower <b>condenser</b> <b>lenses.</b> Here, the variation in total dose-rate was accomplished by changing the second condenser aperture, which kept the areal dose-rate constant. Variation in areal dose-rate was accomplished by changing the second and third <b>condenser</b> <b>lenses</b> to spread out or contract the electron beam on the sample at a constant total dose-rate.|$|R

40|$|Depth and {{radius of}} the region interrogated by cardiac optical mapping with a laser beam depend on photon travel inside the heart.

Monte Carlo computer simulations that incorporated a 0. 55 NA lens in air and absorption and scattering of 488 nm laser light in 3 -d cardiac tissue indicated the distribution of excitation light fluence. A subsequent computer simulation incorporating absorption and scattering of transmembrane voltage-sensitive fluorescence (669 nm) indicated locations in tissue from which fluorescence photons exiting the tissue surface originated.

25|$|Typically a TEM {{consists}} of three stages of lensing. The stages are the <b>condenser</b> <b>lenses,</b> the objective lenses, and the projector <b>lenses.</b> The <b>condenser</b> <b>lenses</b> are responsible for primary beam formation, while the objective lenses focus the beam that comes through the sample itself (in STEM scanning mode, there are also objective lenses above the sample to make the incident electron beam convergent). The projector lenses are used to expand the beam onto the phosphor screen or other imaging device, such as film. The magnification of the TEM {{is due to the}} ratio of the distances between the specimen and the objective lens' image plane. Additional stigmators allow for the correction of asymmetrical beam distortions, known as astigmatism. It is noted that TEM optical configurations differ significantly with implementation, with manufacturers using custom lens configurations, such as in spherical aberration corrected instruments, or TEMs using energy filtering to correct electron chromatic aberration.|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} study we have {{developed}} a new version (ND-NIRs) of a polychromator-type near-infrared (NIR) spectrometer with a high-resolution photo diode array detector, which we built before (D-NIRs).

40|$|Abstract: We {{report on}} the design of a {{holographic}} homogenizer composed of a periodic hologram and a <b>condensing</b> <b>lens.</b> If the hologram is periodic, the homogenizer is free from the alignment error of the incident laser beam. Holographic homogenizer also has an advantage of the flexibility {{in the size of the}} target beam. We calculated theoretically the Fraunhofer diffracted wave function when a rectangular laser beam is incident on a periodic hologram. The diffracted wave is the sum of sinc functions at regular distance. The width of each sinc function depends on the size of the incident laser beam and the distance between the sinc functions depends on the period of the hologram. We calculated numerically the diffracted light intensity for various ratios of the size of the incident laser beam to the period of the hologram. The results show that it is possible to make the diffracted beam uniform at a certain value of the ratio. The uniformity is high at the central part of the target area and low near the edge. The more sinc functions are included in the target area, the larger portion of the area becomes uniform and the higher is the uniformity at the central part. Therefore, we can make efficient homogenizer if we design...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Photoacoustic microscopy, {{also known}} as optoacoustic imaging, is a {{comparatively}} new method of investigation in dental medicine, which uses a laser-generated ultrasound (short laser pulses) to achieve images for interpretation. Photoacoustic microscopy {{can be used in}} a broad spectrum, from detecting tooth decay at its earliest stages to dental anatomy analysis. Material and methods: The energy emitted by the photoacoustic pulse is moderately absorbed by the target and exchanged into heat, leading to a local transitory temperature upsurge. The tension propagates and grows as ultrasonic waves, distinguished by the ultrasonic transducers which are planted apart from the tissue. The photoacoustic microscope has a tunable dye laser which passes through a <b>condensing</b> <b>lens,</b> an objective and ultimately an ultrasonic transducer attached to an acoustic lens to capture and receive information about the scanned probe from a sample moved on the X, Y dimensions. Results: The precise anatomy of layered concentric structures can be clearly observed in photoacoustic microscopy. The image value of the inner layer can be higher, indicating strong optical absorption, while the image value of the outer layer is lower, indicating weaker optical absorption. Meanwhile, the inner layer has the exact same size as the dentin structure and the outer layer has the exact same size as the enamel structure in this cross-section. Conclusions: The photoacoustic microscope (all-optical) comes out to be a future and promising tool for detecting early-stage caries and lesions on the surface of the teeth, where micro-leakage occurs at the interface of tooth restoration, and also the anatomy of dental tissues...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. Previous reports suggest excess high energy, {{short wave}} light {{increase}} lipofuscin fluorophore accumulation in the {{retinal pigment epithelium}} layer. Oxidation of lipofuscin has been implicated in the genesis of macular degeneration. By {{taking advantage of the}} increased exposure to light by optometry students, we tested whether optometry students accumulate more lipofuscin fluorophores than similarly aged allied health students and whether yellow filters alter lipofuscin accumulation. Method. The sample consisted of 54 non-optometry students (Mean age 27, 4. 1 SD; 63 % Female), 62 first-year optometry students (Mean age 27, 4. 9 SD; 55 % female), and 39 second-year students (Mean age 26, 3. 8 SD, 54 % female). First year practice patients were exposed primarily to anterior segment biomicroscopy, while second year practice patients included posterior segment biomicroscopy with <b>condensing</b> <b>lens</b> and binocular indirect ophthalmoscopy sessions. A two distribution mixture model estimated the gray scale of the fluorescent lipofuscin ring around the macula. Results. There was significantly less luminance intensity in optometry students (Mean 70. 8 grayscale) relative to non-optometry students (Mean 76. 2 grayscale, F = 5. 3, p=. 024) which was opposite from our prediction. Covariates included ge (b=. 9,p=. 002) and baseline lipofuscin (b= 1. 1, p Conclusion. Our results were more consistent with oxidation of lipofuscin fluorophores than accumulation following the excess exposure to light as practice patients. The study revealed intriguing trends in a challenging environment that suggested the topic is worth further investigation in a more rigorous experimental environment. The bottom line however is that we do not trust our results over time due to the systematic effect of multiple camera flashes that were not controlled across patients.
