25|$|Many of {{the active}} {{substances}} in black tea do not develop at temperatures lower than 90°C (194°F). As a result, black tea in the West is usually steeped in water near its boiling point, at around 99°C (210°F). The most <b>common</b> <b>fault</b> when making black tea is to use water at too low a temperature. Since boiling point drops with increasing altitude, {{it is difficult to}} brew black tea properly in mountainous areas. Warming the tea pot before steeping is critical at any elevation.|$|E

[...] No-one was injured, but the incident resulted in the withdrawal of all Merchant Navy class locomotives from service whilst the cause was ascertained. [...] An examination of other class members showed that the fracture, caused by metal fatigue, was a <b>common</b> <b>fault.</b> [...] To cover the motive power shortage caused by the mass withdrawal of thirty locomotives, classes from other British Railways regions were drafted in to deputise. The incident resulted in a redesign and replacement of the crank axle.|$|E

2500|$|The most <b>common</b> <b>fault</b> {{associated}} with malolactic fermentation is its occurrence {{when it is}} not desired. This could be for a wine that is meant to be acidic and fruity (such as Riesling) or it could be a wine that was previously thought to have gone through MLF and bottled only to have malolactic fermentation commence in the bottle. The outcome of this [...] "in-bottle" [...] fermentation is often gassy, hazy wine that can be unpalatable to consumers. Improvement in sanitation and control of lactic acid bacteria in the winery can limit the occurrence of these faults.|$|E
2500|$|First, in any {{significant}} economic slump, all economic indicators of output production, market sales, investment and employment are down, not just average profitability. If (for example) sales are down, it is logical that profit income will be down as well, {{but this does}} not mean automatically that lower profitability causes the downturn in sales. It all depends on how exactly [...] "macro" [...] and [...] "micro" [...] trends are related. Post-Keynesian economists are apt to point out that, whether people are buying or not, matters a great deal to the overall functioning of the economy, and matters a great deal to overall profitability. The most <b>common</b> <b>fault</b> in economic analysis is that short-term trends are confused with long-term trends, and this is often what the controversy between Marxists and Keynesians is about.|$|E
2500|$|The media {{reported}} {{that this was}} at least the seventh occurrence of an Airbus A320 series aircraft touching down with the landing gear locked ninety degrees out of position, and one of at least sixty-seven [...] "nose wheel failures" [...] on A319, A320 and A321 aircraft worldwide since 1989. Earlier incidents included another JetBlue flight bound for New York City, a United Airlines flight into Chicago, and an America West flight into Columbus, Ohio. While some incidents were traced to faulty maintenance and denied as a design flaw by Airbus Industries, the manufacturer had issued maintenance advisories to A320 owners which were later mandated as Airworthiness Directives by American and French aviation authorities. Messier-Dowty, which manufactures nose gear assemblies for the A320, stated in an NTSB report in 2004 {{that part of the}} gear had been redesigned to prevent future problems, but at the time the redesign was awaiting approval. Mechanics familiar with this <b>common</b> <b>fault</b> usually replace or re-program the Brake Steering Control Unit (BSCU) computer.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model of}} diverse programs that assumes there are {{a common set of}} potential software faults that are more or less likely to exist in a specific program version. Testing is modeled as a specific ordering of the removal of faults from each program version. Different models of testing are examined where common and diverse test strategies are used for the diverse program versions. Under certain assumptions, theory suggests that a common test strategy could leave the proportion of <b>common</b> <b>faults</b> unchanged, while di-verse test strategies are likely to reduce the proportion of <b>common</b> <b>faults.</b> A re-view of the available empirical evidence gives some support to the assumptions made in the fault-based model.

6000|$|From {{that day}} Valencia courted Headley's company more and more. To {{fall in love}} with him was of course absurd; and he had cured himself of his passing fancy for her. There could be no harm, then, in her making the most of {{conversation}} so different from what she heard in the world, and which in her heart of hearts she liked so much better. For it was with Valencia as with all women; in this <b>common</b> <b>fault</b> of frivolity, as in most others, the men rather than they are to blame. Valencia had cultivated in herself those qualities which she saw admired by the men whom she met, and some one of whom, of course, she meant to marry; and as their female ideal was a butterfly ideal, a butterfly she became. But beneath all lay, deep and strong, the woman's love of nobleness and wisdom, the woman's longing to learn and to be led, which has shown itself in every age in so many a fantastic and even ugly shape, and which is their real excuse for the flirting with, [...] "geniuses," [...] casting themselves at the feet of directors; which had tempted her to coquette with Elsley, and was now bringing her into [...] "undesirable" [...] intimacy with the poor curate.|$|E
40|$|For {{the complex}} {{industrial}} process, {{it has become}} increasingly challenging to effectively diagnose complicated faults. In this paper, a combined measure of the original Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is provided to carry out the fault classification, and compare its result with what is based on SVM-RFE (Recursive Feature Elimination) method. RFE is used for feature extraction, and PCA is utilized to project the original data onto a lower dimensional space. PCA T 2, SPE statistics, and original SVM are proposed to detect the <b>faults.</b> Some <b>common</b> <b>faults</b> of the Tennessee Eastman Process (TEP) are analyzed in terms of the practical system and reflections of the dataset. PCA-SVM and SVM-RFE can effectively detect and diagnose these <b>common</b> <b>faults.</b> In RFE algorithm, all variables are decreasingly ordered according to their contributions. The classification accuracy rate is improved by choosing a reasonable number of features. © 2014 Fang Wu et al...|$|R

60|$|Professor Murray will, I am sure, {{excuse me}} if I {{say that he}} has the <b>common</b> <b>fault</b> of most Englishmen of being inaudible. Why on earth people who have {{something}} to say which is worth hearing should not take the slight trouble to learn how to make it heard is one of the strange mysteries of modern life. Their methods are as reasonable as to try to pour some precious stuff from the spring to the reservoir through a non-conducting pipe, which could by the least effort be opened. Professor Murray made several profound remarks to his white tie and to the water-carafe upon the table, with a humorous, twinkling aside to the silver candlestick upon his right. Then he sat down, and Mr. Waldron, the famous popular lecturer, rose amid a general murmur of applause. He was a stern, gaunt man, with a harsh voice, and an aggressive manner, but he had the merit of knowing how to assimilate the ideas of other men, and to pass them on in a way which was intelligible and even interesting to the lay public, with a happy knack of being funny about the most unlikely objects, so that the precession of the Equinox or the formation of a vertebrate became a highly humorous process as treated by him.|$|E
60|$|It is the <b>common</b> <b>fault</b> of biographers to over-colour the {{character}} of a favourite hero, but those who knew Sir William Heathcote will admit that there is no exaggeration in what I have said. He was the highest product of a class and school of thought which is fast disappearing, and which will perhaps find few representatives in the next generation. With change of time comes also change of men; and the statesmen and politicians of the new world, whatever their merits or demerits, will probably be of a very different order from him of whom I am writing. The old university culture, the fastidious taste, the independence of thought, the union of political life with county associations--bound up as they are in this case by a rare intelligence and a moderation of mind which trimmed, with an almost judicial impartiality, the balance of thought on all matters submitted to him--are not a combination to be easily found in any age or society; but it may be safely predicted that they will be even less common in the coming age {{than they were in the}} generation of which Sir William Heathcote was a representative and ornament. Be this, however, as it may, I desire, by your favour, to record here the loss of one who deserved, if ever man did, the name of an English worthy.|$|E
6000|$|It was {{so funny}} that it set me {{thinking}} afresh and that, with the interest of it, which became a positive excitement, I had to keep myself in hand in order not too publicly to explain, not to break out right and left with my reflections. I don't know why--it was a sense instinctive and unreasoned, but I felt from the first that if I was on the scent of something ultimate I had better waste neither my wonder nor my wisdom. I was on the scent--that I was sure of; and yet even after I was sure I should still have been {{at a loss to}} put my enigma itself into words. I was just conscious, vaguely, of being on the track of a law, a law that would fit, that would strike me as governing the delicate phenomena--delicate though so marked--that my imagination found itself playing with. A part of the amusement they yielded came, I daresay, from my exaggerating them--grouping them into a larger mystery (and thereby a larger [...] "law") than the facts, as observed, yet warranted; but that is the <b>common</b> <b>fault</b> of minds for which the vision of life is an obsession.
