40|$|Oxidation of lipids {{corresponds}} to the degradation of fatty acids by a continuation of sequential reactions : the decomposition of peroxides formed on the fatty chains after the attack by radicalaires compounds ends {{in the production of}} aldéhydes, <b>cétones,</b> acids, alcohols and go to a loss of the organoleptic and nutritional qualities (characteristic rancy smell and taste), thus a significant loss of economic value. The synthetic antioxidants (BHT, BHA) are effective, but their use is of pleased in more controversial. It is thus advisable to study with attention the plant natural antioxidants. The antioxidizing properties of the plant products are given by a certain number of tests as the test to the DPPH or the test ORAC in aqueous environment, and the measure of the index of peroxides or the Rancimat for the lipophilic phases. Certain tests are above all models of study, and few are really recognized, however certain standards are outlined, and the standardization arrives finally (cf the test ORAC, reference USDA). Among the compound vegetables which stand out very sharply at the level of their antioxidizing property, polyphénols are the most represented in the vegetal reign.

Els organoborans poden ser utilitzats com intermedis versàtils en la síntesis orgànica. Tenint en compte l’ús dels organoborans i la importància dels amino alcohols, quatre noves rutes “one-pot” han estat desenvolupades en aquesta tesis per sintetitzar β– o γ–amino alcohols. Les dos primeres rutes estan basades en la β–boració catalítica d’imines α,β–insaturades seguida per la reducció de la imina corresponent i l’oxidació de l’enllaç C-B per obtenir l’estructura γ–amino alcohol desitjada. La tercera ruta consistia en una β-aminació organocatalítica de <b>cetones</b> α,β–insaturades seguida per la reducció del doble enllaç C=O in situ. L’última ruta va ser dissenyada per la síntesis dels β–amino alcohols, basada en l’addició organocatalítica del bor a tosilaldimines seguida pel procés d’homologació/oxidació. Amino alcohols {{are important}} building blocks extensively employed for {{the synthesis of}} natural products, pharmaceuticals, and {{for the production of}} chiral auxiliaries or catalysts used in asymmetric synthesis.

Taking into consideration the advantages of organoboronic esters and the importance of amino alcohols, four new one-pot routes to synthesize β– or γ–amino alcohols have been developed in this thesis. The first and the second were based on the catalytic β–boration of α,β–unsaturated imines followed by reduction of the corresponding imines and oxidation of C-B bond to obtain the desired γ–amino alcohol structure. The third was based on the organocatalytic β–amination of α,β–unsaturated ketones followed by the reduction of the C=O double bond.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that certain flavonoids can have an inhibitory effect on angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity, which {{plays a key role in}} the regulation of arterial blood pressure. In the present study, 17 flavonoids belonging to five structural subtypes were evaluated in vitro for their ability to inhibit ACE in order to establish the structural basis of their bioactivity. The ACE inhibitory (ACEI) activity of these 17 flavonoids was determined by fluorimetric method at two concentrations (500 µM and 100 µM). Their inhibitory potencies ranged from 17 to 95 % at 500 µM and from 0 to 57 % at 100 µM. In both cases, the highest ACEI activity was obtained for luteolin. Following the determination of ACEI activity, the flavonoids with higher ACEI activity (i. e., ACEI > 60 % at 500 µM) were selected for further IC(50) determination. The IC(50) values for luteolin, quercetin, rutin, kaempferol, rhoifolin and apigenin K were 23, 43, 64, 178, 183 and 196 µM, respectively. Our results suggest that flavonoids are an excellent source of functional antihypertensive products. Furthermore, our structure-activity relationship studies show that the combination of sub-structures on the flavonoid skeleton that increase ACEI activity is made up of the following elements: (a) the catechol group in the B-ring, (b) the double bond between C 2 and C 3 at the C-ring, and (c) the <b>cetone</b> group in C 4 at the C-ring.

Infrared spectroscopy, visible spectrophotometry, and sorption isotherms (mono-metal and competitive sorption systems) methods {{were used to assess}} the changer. The E 4 /E 6 ratio (at 465 / at 665 nm) and the infrared spectra of DOM and HA showed aromatic behaviour in compostsoil (SSC-S); in contrast sewage sludge-soil (SS-S) showed an aliphatic behaviour. Application of either SS or SSC increased the Pb and Zn sorption capacity of soil. The Pb and Zn sorption increased in soil and soil mixtures with a competitive metal system. The metal affinity sequence for soil, SS-S, and SSC-S was compared with the predicted affinity sequences obtained from metal properties. Poor correspondence was observed between the metal affinity sequence and the metal affinity sequence predicted by ionic potential, indicating that metals bonding to soils were not predominantly electrostatic. An affinity sequence based on Pearson’s theory agreed with the metal affinity sequences for soils. A statistical analysis showed that the bands assigned to esters (1080 cm- 1) of DOM, phenolic OH (1420 cm- 1), amide I (1650 cm- 1), carboxyl and carbonyl C=O stretches of different nature, C=O stretch of aromatic esters, aliphatic <b>cetone,</b> aldehyde (1720 cm- 1), ethers and esters (1230 cm- 1), aliphatic alcohols (1125 cm- 1), and lignin (1380 cm- 1) of HA were correlated with Zn constants of Langmuir adsorption isotherm (P < 0. 05) ...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays the {{majority}} of wastes is going to landfill sites but waste decomposition produces high amount of pollutants. Because of their interesting properties (low permeability after compaction, expansion ability and high Cation Exchange Capacity) smectites are usually used as pollutant barriers {{at the bottom of}} waste landfill. Landfill leachates are mainly characterized by large amounts of ammonium, which may exchanged with the cations of clay barriers. To better understand the behaviour of these barriers in the presence of leachates, the study of SWy- 2 montmorillonite exchanged with ammonium cations in interaction with different simple molecules produced by waste degradation is proposed. Selected molecules are characteristic of a functional group: ethanol (alcohol), acetone (<b>cetone),</b> formamide (amide), acetonitrile (nitrile), MTBE (ether), benzene (aromatic hydrocarbon), phenol (phenol), aniline (amine) and dichloromethane (aliphatic hydrocarbon). Batch experiments were performed during 7 days at several molecular concentrations higher than in landfill. Treated samples were then dried at 40 °C and analysed by Fourier-Transform Infrared spectroscopy, X-Ray powder diffraction, thermogravimetry, ICP-OES and LECO (for C and N contents). The sorption capacity considerably varies according to molecules. Some molecules (benzene, acetonitrile, MTBE [...] .) do not show fixation, or only a very weak adsorption. Others (aniline, formamide [...] .) are adsorbed. For instance, the sample which interacted with aniline shows a basal distance increase from 1. 19 nm (NH 4 -SWy- 2) to 1. 50 nm and a sharpening of the (001) reflexion. This interlayer space reorganization is attributed to the fixation of aniline molecules on the hydrated interlayer cation (ammonium in this study). The behaviour of NH 4 -SWy- 2 sample in the presence of formamide is quite different. The formamide molecules take the place of interlayer water molecules in the vicinity of ammonium cation which increases the swelling properties of the clay sample. Some consequences on clay barrier modifications can then be discussed...|$|E

In the first section, {{a new and}} efficient methodology towards the stereocontrolled synthesis of novel &# 61537;-acetylenic ketones containing a masked &# 61537;-amino acid functionality in enantiomerically pure form has been developed. This new chiral building block is the starting material for the synthesis of enantiomerically pure quinolyl and pyrazolylglycines, important structures with potential biological activity and very useful for the synthesis of peptidomimetics. The methods begins from the Garner's aldehyde and takes place through an alkyne derivative via a carbonyl-alkyne homologation reaction. Condensation of the lithium acetylide at low temperatures with different aldehydes yielded the corresponding propargyllic alcohol derivatives in good yields, which under mild oxidative conditions gave the corresponding acetylenic ketones algmost quantitatively.

40|$|L'élimination de la matière organique et la réduction de volume des boues peuvent être obtenues par incinération, par {{oxydation}} sous pression en milieu humide ("wet air oxidation") ou par combustion en eau supercritique ("supercritical water oxidation"). Une étude en autoclave agité a permis de comparer sur une même boue d'épuration les performances des deux techniques d'oxydation voie humide et d'oxydation supercritique, en mettant l'accent sur les sous-produits résiduels en phase liquide et la composition de la phase gaz. Les résultats obtenus montrent que l'élimination de la DCO dépend fortement de la température: l'abattement de la DCO passe de 70 % à 235 °C à 94 % à 430 °C. L'azote organique de la boue est transformé en NH 4 + mais seule une élimination limitée de l'azote totale est obtenue à 430 °C. Les sous-produits résiduels dans la phase liquide sont constitués en majorité d'acides gras, d'aldéhydes et de <b>cétones,</b> l'acide acétique étant prédominant. Hormis le CO 2, les sous-produits gazeux majeurs formés par des réactions complexes comme la pyrolyse, le réformage et la méthanation sont CO, H 2 et CH 4. Dans les conditions supercritiques, tous les sous-produits gazeux sont fortement oxydés. L'augmentation de la température de traitement permet d'obtenir un résidu solide de plus en plus inerte, les cendres obtenues en conditions supercritiques contenant moins de 1 % de matière organique. Les performances des deux procédés étudiés laissent envisager leur développement à moyen terme comme voies alternatives d'élimination des boues. ContextAs {{the number}} of wastewater treatment plants increases, and the efficiency of treatment improves, {{the problem of how}} to dispose of the ever increasing amounts of generated sludge has intensified. For the beginning of the next century 1 million tons of sludge will be produced annually in France; disposal in landfills will be impossible and agricultural use could be limited by tight quality standards. Therefore, the development of effective and acceptable sludge processes is urgently needed. Destruction of organic matter in sludge and large reductions in sludge volume are achieved either by incineration or by wet air oxidation (WAO), which needs no fuel and generates no smoke, fly ash or emissions of NOx and SO 2. Supercritical water oxidation (SCWO) offers an attractive alternative. Water, above its vapor-liquid critical point of 374 °C and 221 bar, is an excellent solvent for organic compounds and becomes completely miscible with oxygen. Reported results of sewage sludge SCWO demonstrate rapid and effective treatment. The objective of this study was to compare sub- and supercritical water oxidation of sludge in terms of organic matter destruction and formation of by-products in both gas and liquid phases. MethodologyOxidation of sludge was studied in a 0. 5 L batch reactor rated for 450 °C- 300 bar. The raw material was a biological sludge containing 4 % solids with a chemical oxygen demand (COD) value of 52 g/L. In the standard experimental procedure, 100 mL sludge were heated up to reaction temperature and oxygen was then introduced in 50 % excess with respect to COD. Heating was maintained during 1 hour before slow cooling to room temperature. The overall organic destruction was quantified in terms of total organic carbon (TOC) and COD. Gas and liquid phases sampled at room temperature after reaction were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC). Sulfur and nitrogen species were also analyzed. ResultsWhen the temperature increased from 210 to 383 °C, COD destruction increased significantly (Table 1). At 383 °C, a COD destruction efficiency of 94. 3 % was obtained. However, at 430 °C, organic matter oxidation was only marginally improved. In WAO tests, considerable acetic acid was produced and remained in the substrate. The produced acetic acid was oxidized rapidly under SCWO conditions. Surprisingly, the concentrations of the other volatile fatty acids (VFA) remained approximately constant between 310 and 430 °C (Table 2). In addition to VFA, which represent ca. 50 % of the residual COD, oxygenated organic compounds such as aldehydes, ketones and alcohols were produced (Table 3). The data in Table 4 show that decomposition of organic nitrogen compounds into ammonia was completed at 383 °C, while nitrates were reduced to N 2 by reaction with organic matter and ammonia. NOx were not detected in the gas phase. The low reactivity of ammonia in supercritical water had been previously demonstrated. At 430 °C, ammonia removal from sludge was limited to 15 %. On the other hand, even in WAO conditions all sulfur species were totally converted to sulfate. Under subcritical conditions, the gas phase contained significant concentrations of hydrogen and carbon monoxide in addition to water, residual oxygen and carbon dioxide. Traces of methane and C 2 -C 3 hydrocarbons were also detected (Figs. 1 and 2). These gases result from a complex chemistry including pyrolysis, steam reforming and water-gas shift. Under supercritical conditions, all these compounds were extensively eliminated by oxidation. Under supercritical conditions the residual solids contained less than 1 % organic matter. By X-ray diffraction hydroxyapatite, quartz and kaliophilite were identified in the residual solids. These results confirm that supercritical water oxidation is a new sludge treatment concept of great interest. The degree of conversion of organic carbon is high, while liquid and especially gaseous by- products are produced in minor amounts compared to subcritical conditions. Temperatures higher than 430 °C would be needed for substantial nitrogen removal...|$|R
40|$|L'efficacité de l'extraction sur résine XAD- 4 a été étudiée à partir de neuf composés hydrophiles non ionisables (alcools, aldéhydes, <b>cétones,</b> esters). Le facteur de capacité (k') est déterminé expérimentalement par élution {{frontale}} de différentes fractions volumiques de méthanol. Les rendements de récupération sont évalués pour quatre solvants. L'efficacité maximale et le facteur de concentration optimal sont définis {{en fonction}} du volume de percolation et du volume d'élution. Le rendement moyen est de 80 % après élution par l'acétone. L'entraînement dynamique à la vapeur est par ailleurs développé pour concentrer les composés dans 200 ml de distillat à partir de 4 litres d'échantillon. Le rendement moyen est de 77 %. Ces deux techniques sont associées afin d'accroître la spécificité de la méthodologie analytique vis-à-vis des composés hydrophiles non ionisables. Après un entraînement de l'échantillon d'eau, le condensat est ensuite percolé sur une colonne de résine XAD- 4 (7 cm x 1, 5 cm), l'élution s'effectuant par 14 ml d'acétone. L'éluat est alors concentré, à température ambiante, par un courant d'azote jusqu'à 4 ml, puis analysé par un chromatographe en phase gazeuse. Cette méthodologie a été appliquée à un eau naturelle artificiellement polluée par 15 composés hydrophiles non ionisables. Les rendements de récupération sont compris entre 42 % et 83 % (rendement moyen de 63 %). Non-ionic hydrophilic compounds are very {{often used as}} solvents in industrial activities or for domestic use. These products are generally alcohols, aldehydes, ketones and esters. Although they are not very dangerous for the environment at low concentrations, for hazardous pollution conditions {{there is a need}} to be able to identify and quantify such compounds. Chlorination of humic substances during drinking water treatment can also generate chlorinated by-products (chlorinated ketones). Because of their solubility in water, it is necessary to concentrate and extract these compounds before gas chromatography analysis. In this study, we describe a method where liquid/gas (steam distillation) and liquid/solid (XAD- 4 resin) extractions were combined. The aim of this work was to define analytical conditions to obtain the best efficiency for the overall method. In the first phase, we developed the liquid/solid extraction on XAD- 4 resin by studying capacity factors, elution volumes and percolated water volumes. The sorption of nine non- ionic hydrophilic compounds (ethanol, butanol- 1, pentanol- 1, ethyl acetate, n-butyl acetate, methylisobutylketone, cyclohexanone, diisobutylketone, butanal) from water onto microparticulate XAD- 4 resin, and their subsequent recovery into water-methanol mixtures, was used to estimate the capacity factor (k'water) for each analyte. According to the capacity factor values, we could define three classes of compounds: 1. highly hydrophilic compounds such as ethanol, which were not very well retained by the resin (k'water= 11); 2. moderately hydrophilic compounds such as ethyl acetate, butanol- 1, butanal, pentanol- 1 for which capacity factors were less than 100; 3. weakly hydrophilic compounds that were well retained by the resin, such as diisobutylketone with a capacity factor equal to 1770. Subsequently, mobilization/recovery by frontal elution into each of four different solvents (dichloromethane, acetone, acetonitrile, methanol) was studied in order to define for each of the analytes an optimal recovery procedure. Recoveries were dependent on the volume of the water sample passing through the column (100 mL, 200 mL, 400 mL) and on volume of solvent used for the elution. The best recoveries were observed when 200 mL of water were passed through the column and when the elution was performed by 14 mL of acetone. Mean recovery was 80 %. Methylisobutylketone, pentanol- 1 and ethyl acetate were extracted with yields higher than 80 %, whereas butanal and 2, 2 -dichloroethanol showed a poor recovery of around 60 %. In the second phase of the study, steam distillation was also assessed as a technique for the concentration of analytes (200 mL condensate from 4 litres aqueous sample). Mean recovery was 77 %. Higher recoveries were observed for ethyl acetate, butanol- 1, pentanol- 1 and 1, 1 - dichloroacetone. Dichloroethanol was not extracted with a suitable recovery (yield around 33 %). The two extraction methods were combined to increase the extraction specificity for non- ionic hydrophilic compounds. In a preliminary concentration step, the analytes were recovered by steam distillation from 4 litre water samples. Analytes were sorbed from the condensate onto a 7 cm x 1. 5 cm column of XAD- 4 resin, then eluted with 14 mL acetone. The column eluate was concentrated to 4 mL, at room temperature in a gentle stream of nitrogen, and analyzed by gas chromatography. The extraction procedure was applied to 18 compounds (butanol- 1, pentanol- 1, hexanol- 1, octanol- 1, decanol, 2, 2 -dichloroethanol, ethyl acetate, n-butyl acetate, methyl hexanoate, methyl octanoate, methylisobutylketone, diisobutylketone, 1, 1 -dichloroacetone, octanone- 2, butanal, hexanal, octanal, benzaldehyde) in spiked ultrapure water and also to 15 compounds (same compounds except for benzaldehyde and 2, 2 -dichloroethanol) in spiked natural water. Mean recovery percentages for the analytes in ultrapure water and in natural water were respectively around 60 % and 63 %. These results demonstrate that the ionic composition of the water medium did not interfere with the efficiency of the complete method. In the case of spiked natural water, recovery yields ranged between 42 % (butanol- 1) and 83 % (octanol- 1). Keywords...|$|R
40|$|Les étapes de désinfection de l'eau, telles que l'ozonation et la chloration, génèrent des sous-produits d'oxydation de nature variée. Ces composés sont soupçonnés d'être toxiques à plus ou moins long terme. Certains d'entre eux sont, de plus, {{facilement}} biodégradables et favorisent donc une reviviscence bactérienne dans le réseau de distribution. Enfin, à cause de leurs caractéristiques organoleptiques, ils peuvent conduire à la détérioration de la qualité sensorielle de l'eau distribuée. La recherche de plusieurs sous-produits d'oxydation dans l'eau potable a pu être effectuée grâce à de nouvelles techniques d'analyse quantitative par chromatographie en phase gazeuse: il s'agit des aldéhydes et des <b>cétones</b> de faible poids moléculaire, des acides haloacétiques et de certains céto-acides. Ces composés ont été recherchés dans des usines comportant une étape d'ozonation. L'influence de ce traitement sur {{la formation}} des aldéhydes et des céto-acides est démontrée dans cette étude. L'ozonation multiplie la concentration totale d'aldéhydes par un facteur variant de 2 à 4 suivant les usines et les trois céto-acides recherchés ont été trouvés en quantités importantes dans des eaux ozonées. La filtration sur charbon, lorsqu'elle existe, s'avère efficace pour l'élimination de ces composés. Les trois acides chloroacétiques sont présents dans des eaux chlorées, en sortie d'usines appliquant des taux de chloration assez importants. Enfin, I'évolution de ces sous-produits d'oxydation tout au long d'un réseau de distribution a pu être expliquée par leur biodégradabilité. New regulations are being {{considered by the}} US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) concerning a variety of disinfection by-products formed during chlorination and ozonation (halonitriles, haloketones, haloacids, low molecular weight aldehydes [...] .) and many surveys are underway to assess the presence of such products in drinking waters. This renewed interest for disinfection byproducts (DBPs) arises from their suspected carcinogenic or mutagenic properties. In addition to possible long term health effects, specific disinfection by-products may also induce immediate water quality deterioration due to their objectionable organoleptic properties. Biodegradable DBP's also probably contribute a substantial proportion of the biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC). As far as oxidation disinfection practices in France are concerned, the use of ozone is frequent. Also, most major French treatment plants include an activated carbon filtration process {{which is likely to}} remove some of the DBPs {{as well as some of}} their precursors. This paper summarizes the results obtained along various treatment plants in the Paris area, concerning three major families of DBPs considered for regulation: the DBPs investigated include 30 aldehydes and ketones, chloroacetic acids and 3 ketoacids. The aldehydes and ketones were measured by GC-ECD or GC-MS after derivatization with PFBHA; the chloroacetic acids were measured using a micro extraction method with methyltertiobutylether followed by diazomethane methylation and GC-ECD or GC-MS; the six plants investigated in the Paris area treat surface water from the river Seine upstream of Paris (Morsang, Vigneux, Orly, Ivry) or groundwater which is artificially recharged with Seine river water downstream of Paris (Le Pecq, Aubergenville). The Alençon plant which is located outside the Paris area treats raw water from the Sarthe river plus groundwater from various wells. All the treatment lines studied include an ozonation step which is followed at some plants (Morsang, Ivry, Vigneux, Le Pecq-Minor) by a granular activated carbon (GAC) filtration. The treatment line investigated at Vigneux used an ozone/hydrogen peroxide combination as an oxidation step. Three of these treatment lines (Morsang, Le Pecq-Minor, Alençon) comprise a prechlorination step; the other plants only use chlorination as a final disinfection step. The study compares the total concentration of aldehydes detected before and after ozonation as well as after GAC filtration. Approximately half of this total is usually due to formaldehyde while acetaldehyde, glyoxal and methylglyoxal represent most of the remainder. These concentrations which initially range from 1 to 25 µg/l show a drastic increase after ozonation. Depending on the water DOC and ozonation conditions, the total level of aldehydes is multiplied by a factor of 2 to 4. The final chlorine disinfection step used at all these plants does not significantly influence the total concentration of the aldehydes, therefore the level of these DBPs at the outlet of the plants is mainly determined by the ozonation or ozone/GAC filtration steps. The three aldo and ketoacids analysed were glyoxylic acid, pyruvic acid and ketomalonic acid. They were detected in ozonated water with total concentrations which range from 65 to 80 µg/l. Glyoxylic acid alone, represents half of these quantities. Chloroacetic acids were not detected at the outlet of the plants which are supplied by groundwater (Le Pecq-Minor, Aubergenville) and which apply a low chlorine dose (0. 1 - 0. 2 ppm) as a final disinfection stop. Although the Morsang treatment line investigated applies a low prechlorination dose ([smaller or equal] 1 ppm) in addition to the low postchlorination dose, no haloacids were detected at the outlet, which is agreement with the low levels of trihalomethanes usually detected at this plant. The absence of haloacids at the outlet of this plant can be attributed to the efficiency of the ozone/GAC combination as well as to the low prechlorination dose applied. Haloacids were only detected at the outlet of the Orly, Ivry and Alençon plants which apply a rather high chlorine dose during the final disinfection stop (between 0. 8 and 2. 2 ppm) in order to maintain a residual in the distribution system. Typical levels of haloacids are found between 10 and 35 µg/l, mainly under the form of dichloro and trichloroacetic acid. To summarize, the levels of the specific DBPs investigated remain well below their individual WHO recommendations (respectively 50, 100 and 900 µg/ 1 for dichloroacetic acid, trichloroacetic acid and formaldehyde). Unless more drastic national regulations are implemented, the interest in the fate of these DBP's mainly lies in their possible secondary effects such as enhancement of bacterial regrowth in distribution systems or degradation of drinking water organoleptic properties...|$|R

Les très faibles concentrations en composés génotoxiques dans les eaux potables nécessitent la concentration des échantillons, procédé qui risque toutefois de modifier la génotoxicité. Plusieurs tests mettant en oeuvre des cellules procaryotes ou eucaryotes, des plantes ou des mammifères, ont permis de mettre en évidence les effets génotoxiques dans des eaux potables chlorées. L'identification des composés génotoxiques est réalisée au moyen des données de la spectrométrie de masse et de la spectroscopie UV ou RMN (proton ou carbone). Ces agents sont généralement non volatils, acides et polaires. Bien que certains composés inorganiques interviennent parfois, la majeure partie de la génotoxicité est attribuée aux agents organohalogénés (bromés ou/et chlorés), les principaux étant les trihalométhanes, acides acétiques, acétonitriles, <b>cétones,</b> et hydroxyfuranones. La fixation de normes contribue à limiter l'exposition des populations aux agents potentiellement dangereux. La qualité des eaux de boisson peut être accrue en utilisant une eau brute moins chargée en matière organique, et en améliorant le traitement chimique tout en veillant à conserver la qualité microbiologique de l'eau produite. In 1974, {{two independent}} studies - {{one in the}} Netherlands {{and the other in}} the United States - demonstrated the occurrence of trihalomethanes in drinking water. Following studies showed that these chemicals were common contaminants of drinking water and that chloroform, i. e. one of these trihalomethanes, was carcinogenic in rodents. Further investigations demonstrated that extracts of chlorinated drinking water induced significant mutagenicity in the Ames/Salmonella assay. In the present paper we will fist discuss the methods used to detect the genotoxic activity of drinking water and, then, the methods developed to identify the compounds responsible for this activity. After this, we will present the main genotoxic chemicals identified in drinking water, before finally considering several propositions to limit the exposure of populations to these genotoxic compounds. Drinking water is usually produced through a multistage process which includes one or several chlorination steps. It is now widely accepted that the genotoxic activity of drinking water mainly originates from the reaction of chlorine with humic substances present in raw water. Humic substances are natural organic matters (resulting from the degradation of plants and animal tissues) of very complex structure with most chemical functions arranged in aromatic rings or aliphatic chains. The identification of a genotoxic activity in drinking water usually requires concentration of the water samples. Even though such a process implies a probable qualitative/quantitative alteration of the constituents of water samples, the extremely low amounts of genotoxic compounds in drinking water require concentration steps. Among the many genotoxicity tests carried out, the Ames test (which detects reverse mutations in bacteria Salmonella typhimurium) is the assay which was the most frequently used in the field of drinking water mutagenicity. Other tests were performed on eucaryotic cells. Assays detecting micronuclei or chromosomal aberrations in plants, or mutations in mold, yeast, or maize enabled the detection of genotoxic effects of drinking water extracts. Tests on mammal cells also showed that drinking water extracts induced point mutations, sister chromatid exchanges, chromosomal aberrations and micronuclei. In vivo tests on aquatic organims such as newt or mussels demonstrated the micronuclei inducing effect of unconcentrated drinking water samples. Regarding the identification of the compounds responsible for the genotoxicity, it is obviously not possible to identify all of the thousands of chemicals that may be involved. But such a process is important in order to evaluate the specific genotoxicity and the risk associated with (at least) the main chemicals occurring in drinking water. The identification process usually follows three steps: 1. concentration of the sample can be performed using reverse osmosis, freeze drying, liquid-liquid extraction, and/or adsorption on non ionic resin followed by extraction with organic solvent; 2. the purification step uses one or a combination of chromatographic techniques (TLC, packed column liquid chromatography, HPLC or GC); 3. structural identification of the chemical is performed using data from mass spectrometry, and proton and carbon NMR, or UV spectroscopy. The analysis of the genotoxic compounds of drinking water showed that they are rather non-volatile, quite acid and not stable at high pH, rather polar, and with a mean molecular weigh around 200. Turning now to the identity of these compounds, it is considered that the genotoxicity of drinking water is mainly due to organohalogenated chemicals. Some inorganic chemicals (this class of chemicals is usually not recovered in drinking water extracts) which induce genotoxic or carcinogenic effects must, however, be recalled. Arsenic, nitrates, bromates and radon are natural or human-activity-related drinking water contaminants which are responsible for cancers in rodents or in humans. Among the many genotoxic or carcinogenic organohalogenated compounds identified in drinking water, the most abundant chemicals are chlorinated and/or brominated trihalomethanes. Other important groups of compounds are chlorinated and/or brominated derivatives of acetic acids, acetonitriles, ketones, phenolic compounds. The chlorinated hydroxyfuranones, although present at concentrations lower than 0. 1 µg/l in drinking water, can be responsible {{for more than half of}} the Ames mutagenicity. MX, the most potent of these chlorohydroxyfuranones, has been submitted to intensive toxicological studies worldwide and was very recently identified as a potent carcinogen in rats. Now that the presence of genotoxic compounds in drinking waters is a well documented and accepted fact, the perspectives lies in the better identification of the impact of these drinking water contaminants. The development of more sensitive tests such as the Comet assay (detection of DNA strand breaks) or the 32 P postlabelling assay (detection of DNA adducts) should be pursued. Moreover, the interaction between genotoxic compounds and DNA must be investigated more thoroughly, including the identification of adduct structures. More globally, it is of interest to better assess the impact of these agents on public health and on the occurrence of specific human cancers. At present, even though a few individual water contaminants are classified as human probable carcinogens, the chlorinated drinking water (in itself) is not considered as carcinogenic to humans. Exposure to these potentially harmful agents can be limited with 1. improving drinking water quality - i. e. decreasing the formation of genotoxins - by using raw water containing lower amounts of organic matter; and 2. modifying the water chemical treatment by using lower amounts of chlorine and/or combining chlorine with other disinfectants. The public health can also be protected by the setting of guidelines for drinking water: each compound identified as dangerous would be given a concentration threshold which should never be exceeded. The Environmental Protection Agency in the U. S. A. and the World Health Organisation are authorities setting such guidelines. Finally, we believe it is important to limit the concentration of genotoxic compounds in drinking water as much as possible, and one way to do so is to use chlorine in smaller amounts and in a more efficient way. But it is of paramount importance to keep in mind that the disinfection process (in which chlorine still plays a major role) and the providing of a microbiologically safe drinking water should never be jeopardized...|$|R
