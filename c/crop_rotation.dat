5|$|<b>Crop</b> <b>rotation</b> {{can help}} to control pests by depriving them of their host plants. It is a major tactic in the control of corn rootworm, and has reduced early season {{incidence}} of Colorado potato beetle {{by as much as}} 95%.|$|E
5|$|<b>Crop</b> <b>rotation</b> is, {{however, the}} most {{important}} cultural control of L. decemlineata. Rotation may delay the infestation of potatoes and can reduce the build-up of early season beetle populations because the adults emerging from diapause can only disperse to new food sources by walking. One 1984 study showed that rotating potatoes with non-host plants reduced the density of early season adults by 95.8%.|$|E

5|$|Malagasy farmers {{continue}} to use fire to clear out agricultural land and pasture for livestock, promoting grass growth while inhibiting forest regeneration. The fires sometimes burn {{out of control and}} destroy forest edges along with the natural flora, increasing the damage even further than intended. Due to the nature of Madagascar's geology and soil, tavy also depletes the fertility of the soil, accelerating the <b>crop</b> <b>rotation</b> rate and necessitating expansion into primary forests.|$|E
5|$|Richard {{severely}} curtailed {{tobacco production}} {{in favor of}} more sustainable crops, including wheat, corn, rye, and barley. This reduced the soil depletion inherent to tobacco production, and allowed for the practice of <b>crop</b> <b>rotation.</b> He also planted fruit orchards, including peach and apple trees, which he used to produce spirits. In 1801 Richard constructed a dairy, which ran primarily under the supervision of his wife Elizabeth Collins Lee.|$|E
5|$|The {{conventional}} {{approach was}} probably {{the first to be}} employed, since it is comparatively easy to destroy weeds by burning them or ploughing them under, and to kill larger competing herbivores. Techniques such as <b>crop</b> <b>rotation,</b> companion planting (also known as intercropping or mixed cropping), and the selective breeding of pest-resistant cultivars have a long history.|$|E
40|$|The {{characterization}} of actual <b>crop</b> <b>rotations</b> {{on a large}} territory is a major challenge for local stakeholders {{in order to understand}} agricultural impacts on natural resources, e. g., nitrate leaching (Beaudouin et al., 2005). Although various mathematical descriptions and simulations of <b>crop</b> <b>rotations</b> have been proposed (e. g., Castellazi et al., 2010), few models propose to reconstruct actual crop sequences and to simplify their diversity in a reasonable number of <b>crop</b> <b>rotations.</b> The aim of this work was thus to combine modelling and farm interviews to characterize <b>crop</b> <b>rotations</b> which were representative of different soil characteristics and farming systems over a whole agricultural area of 70, 000 ha...|$|R

5|$|Agriculture {{also made}} up an {{important}} part of the Plymouth economy. The colonists adopted Native American agricultural practices and crops. They planted maize, squash, pumpkins, beans, and potatoes. Besides the crops themselves, the Pilgrims learned productive farming techniques from the Native Americans, such as proper <b>crop</b> <b>rotation</b> and the use of dead fish to fertilize the soil. In addition to these native crops, the colonists also successfully planted Old World crops such as turnips, carrots, peas, wheat, barley, and oats.|$|E
5|$|Between the 16th {{century and}} the mid-19th century, Britain saw a large {{increase}} in agricultural productivity and net output. New agricultural practices like enclosure, mechanization, four-field <b>crop</b> <b>rotation</b> to maintain soil nutrients, and selective breeding enabled an unprecedented population growth to 5.7 million in 1750, freeing up {{a significant percentage of}} the workforce, and thereby helped drive the Industrial Revolution. The productivity of wheat went up from about 19 bushels per acre in 1720 to around 30 bushels by 1840, marking a major turning point in history.|$|E
5|$|In Moldavia, {{agriculture}} and animal raising remained the principal economic activities. Similarly to Wallachia, wooden plow remained the main agricultural tool throughout the Middle Ages. The constant clearing of land shows that finding new land was still preferred to <b>crop</b> <b>rotation.</b> The {{establishment of the}} principality enhanced the security of travel, thus Moldavia could also profit from the transit trade between Poland and the Black Sea ports. The first local coins were minted in 1377, under Peter I Muşat (c.13751391).|$|E
40|$|To {{support the}} {{development}} and expansion of organic farming, {{more research is needed}} to optimise the function and practices of individual farms. Furthermore, it is important to assess the ecological effects of organic farming on a regional scale in order to show potential ad-vantages of organic farming compared to conventional farming. Both issues require model-ling of cropping methods and <b>crop</b> <b>rotations.</b> The authors present a rule-based model for the generation of site-specific and agronomically suitable <b>crop</b> <b>rotations.</b> Site-specific estimation modules for yields, nitrogen balance, risk of weed problems, phytosanitary restrictions for <b>crop</b> <b>rotations,</b> and economic costs and benefits allow the generation and selection of eco-nomically optimal, site-specific organic <b>crop</b> <b>rotations.</b> A stand-alone version of the model is presented, but the algorithms are also used within a linear programming farm model...|$|R

5|$|Manuel Belgrano {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{politicians}} to advocate the development of an important educative system. He did so at the first report he made as head of the Consulate of Commerce, suggesting the creating of schools of agriculture and commerce. A school of agriculture would teach about important topics such as <b>crop</b> <b>rotation,</b> the specific ways to work with each crop, methods of seeding and harvesting, preservation of seeds, and identification of pests. Until that time, the only previous attempts to teach agriculture was done by the Jesuits, who were banished in 1767.|$|E
5|$|Modern plant breeders {{develop new}} crop {{varieties}} to meet specific conditions. A new variety might, for example, be higher yielding, more disease resistant {{or have a}} longer shelf life than the varieties from which it was bred. The practical use of crop diversity goes back to early agricultural methods of <b>crop</b> <b>rotation</b> and fallow fields, where planting and harvesting one type of crop on a plot of land one year, and planting a different crop on that same plot the next year. This takes advantage of differences in a plant's nutrient needs, but more importantly reduces the buildup of pathogens.|$|E
5|$|On a more {{practical}} level, the central government took an active interest in supporting agriculture. Producing food was the top priority of land use. Larger farms (latifundia) achieved an economy of scale that sustained urban life and its more specialized division of labour. Small farmers benefited from the development of local markets in towns and trade centres. Agricultural techniques such as <b>crop</b> <b>rotation</b> and selective breeding were disseminated throughout the Empire, and new crops were introduced from one province to another, such as peas and cabbage to Britain.|$|E

40|$|Cropland use {{activities}} are major drivers of global environmental changes and of farming system resilience. Rotating crops {{is a critical}} land-use driver, and a farmers' key strategy to control environmental stresses and crop performances. Evidence has accumulated that <b>crop</b> <b>rotations</b> have been dramatically simplified over the last 50 years. In contrast, organic farming stands as an alternative production way that promotes crop diversification. However, our understanding of <b>crop</b> <b>rotations</b> is surprisingly limited. In order to understand if organic farming would result in more diversified and multifunctional landscapes, we provide here a novel, systematic comparison of organic-to-conventional <b>crop</b> <b>rotations</b> at the global scale based on a meta-analysis of the scientific literature, paired with an independent analysis of organic-to-conventional land-use. We show that organic farming leads to differences in land-use compared to conventional: overall, <b>crop</b> <b>rotations</b> are 15 % longer and result in higher diversity and evener crop species distribution. These changes are driven by a higher abundance of temporary fodders, catch and cover-crops, mostly {{to the detriment of}} cereals. We also highlighted differences in organic rotations between Europe and North-America, two leading regions for organic production. This increased complexity of organic <b>crop</b> <b>rotations</b> is likely to enhance ecosystem service provisioning to agroecosystems...|$|R
5|$|The {{improvements}} {{of animal}} husbandry {{in the medieval}} period in Europe went {{hand in hand with}} other developments. Improvements to the plough allowed the soil to be tilled to a greater depth. Horses took over from oxen as the main providers of traction, new ideas on <b>crop</b> <b>rotation</b> were developed and the growing of crops for winter fodder gained ground. Peas, beans and vetches became common; they increased soil fertility through nitrogen fixation, allowing more livestock to be kept.|$|E
5|$|The {{onion fly}} (Delia antiqua) lays eggs on {{the leaves and}} stems {{and on the ground}} close to onion, shallot, leek, and garlic plants. The fly is {{attracted}} to the crop by the smell of damaged tissue and is liable to occur after thinning. Plants grown from sets are less prone to attack. The larvae tunnel into the bulbs and the foliage wilts and turns yellow. The bulbs are disfigured and rot, especially in wet weather. Control measures may include <b>crop</b> <b>rotation,</b> the use of seed dressings, early sowing or planting, and the removal of infested plants.|$|E
5|$|Advice on more {{productive}} techniques for farming {{began to appear}} in England in the mid-17th century, from writers such as Samuel Hartlib, Walter Blith and others. The main problem in sustaining agriculture in one place for a long time was the depletion of nutrients, most importantly nitrogen levels, in the soil. To allow the soil to regenerate, productive land was often let fallow and in some places <b>crop</b> <b>rotation</b> was used. The Dutch four-field rotation system was popularised by the British agriculturist Charles Townshend in the 18th century. The system (wheat, turnips, barley and clover), opened up a fodder crop and grazing crop allowing livestock to be bred year-round. The use of clover was especially important as the legume roots replenished soil nitrates.|$|E
