5|$|Eveline was an {{inspiration}} for many of Balzac's characters. She <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> model for La Fosseue, Mme Claes, Modesta Mignon, Ursule Mirouet, Adelina Houlot, and especially Eugenie Grandet and Mme de Mortsauf. There is less agreement among scholars on whether she was also the inspiration for more negative characters such as Fedora and lady Dudley, as Balzac seems to have used her mostly {{as a model for}} more positive personas. His works also mention numerous characters named Eve or Eveline, and have several dedications to her.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the 124 cast and crew members, 250 local extras were also hired. The majority of the extras were used {{as members of the}} local high school band, chorus and dramatic society that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Brodys walk through the town, and during Sean's attack. A local gravestone maker produced 51 slabs for the mock graveyard used for Sean's funeral.|$|E
5|$|Securely {{attached}} {{children are}} {{best able to}} explore when they have the knowledge of a secure base (their caregiver) to return to in times of need. When assistance is given, this bolsters the sense of security and also, assuming the parent's assistance is helpful, educates the child in {{how to cope with}} the same problem in the future. Therefore, secure attachment <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> most adaptive attachment style. According to some psychological researchers, a child becomes securely attached when the parent is available and able {{to meet the needs of}} the child in a responsive and appropriate manner. At infancy and early childhood, if parents are caring and attentive towards their children, those children will be more prone to secure attachment.|$|E

40|$|When {{modelling}} a domain, it {{is often}} the case that certain individuals are represented as belonging to multiple categories, generating therefore "tangled" hierarchies: 1. A physical object <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> an amount of matter 2. A hole <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a region of space 3. A building <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a place 4. A biological organ <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> an aggregate of molecules 5. An association <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a group of people 6. A physical object <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a temporal process This phenomenon is quite common: the examples above have been taken from existing toplevel ontologies used in practice, and they are responsible, in our opinion, of many situations of tangleness, confusion, and lack of semantic rigour. We advocate in the present paper a design principle aimed to clarify such situations and produce more reusable and well-founded ontologies.

25|$|Algebraic {{combinatorics}} {{is an area}} {{of mathematics}} that employs methods of abstract algebra, notably group theory and representation theory, in various combinatorial contexts and, conversely, applies combinatorial techniques to problems in algebra.

25|$|The Black Hills granites {{were exposed}} to erosion during the Neoproterozoic, but were later buried by {{sandstone}} and other sediments during the Cambrian. Remaining buried throughout the Paleozoic, they were re-exposed again during the Laramide orogeny around 70 million years ago. The Black Hills area was uplifted as an elongated geologic dome. Subsequent erosion stripped the granite of the overlying sediments and the softer adjacent schist.
