Standard counts are the amount of radiation released by the two nuclear sources inside the machine, with no loss or leakage. This allows the machine to compare the amount of radiation released {{to the amount of}} radiation received. With the use of a 3/4" [...] diameter rod a hole is created in the <b>compacted</b> <b>base</b> by hammering the rod into the base to produce a hole that the densometer's probe can be inserted into. The densometer is placed on top of the hole, and then the probe is inserted into the hole by unlocking the handle {{at the top of the}} probe. One source produces radiation that interacts with the atoms in the soil, and is then compared to the standard count, to calculate the density. The other source interacts with hydrogen atoms to calculate the percentage of water in the soil.|$|E

5000|$|Hot mix asphalt {{concrete}} (commonly abbreviated as HMAC or HMA) {{is produced by}} heating the asphalt binder to decrease its viscosity, and drying the aggregate to remove moisture from it prior to mixing. Mixing is generally performed with the aggregate at about 300 °F (roughly 150 °C) for virgin asphalt and 330 °F (166 °C) for polymer modified asphalt, and the asphalt cement at 200 °F (95 °C). Paving and compaction must be performed while the asphalt is sufficiently hot. In many countries paving is restricted to summer months because in winter the <b>compacted</b> <b>base</b> will cool the asphalt too much before {{it is able to}} be packed to the required density.

5000|$|Alpha Ridge was {{proposed}} in the late 1970s as an unpopular project that strained the public participation process {{to address the needs}} of a population expansion that would quadruple while it was in operation. The search for a third County landfill started in 1973 with opposition causing the drop of selections at Triadelphia Road and Route 144, Interstate 70 and Sand Hill Road and Henryton Road at Route 99. In 1976 the search centered around the 600-acre Burliegh Manor slave plantation purchased by future Maple Lawn developer Steward Greenbaum. Community members quit the site study claiming they were denied meaningful participation. When updating the historical status of the plantation in 1976, County archivist Cleora Barnes Thompson added [...] "It should be stated here that the presence of a landfill in the surrounding area of Burliegh might not be in any way harmful as it will prevent the encroachment of future suburban development and will later provide a large area for a park, recreation or open space". Protests from citizens and Goodloe Byron against Clarksville, Guilford and Ellicott City sites left Marriotsville as the site with least opposition. Gibes Realty-Woodbrier Enterprises put together an offer of $3900 and acre to purchase land contracts. The Company owners, Robert and James Moxley were the original land speculators for Columbia and children of former County Chairman Norman E. Moxley. In February 1977 the Gibes-Woodbrier Alpha Ridge site was selected at the end of County Executive Edward L. Cochran's term. His wife became the realtor for the subdivision of Burleigh Manor afterward. Howard County Citizens for Conservation gathered 3000 signatures against the project and sued the county for lack of public meetings on the selection. The suit was dismissed in May with acknowledgement that meetings did not have adequate notice. In May 1979 the Maryland State Health department granted the permit for Alpha Ridge. The initial site was built on a <b>compacted</b> <b>base</b> without liners. Residents were informed that Alpha Ridge would operate until the year 2000 without expansion and be converted to a park at the end of its collection phase. BFI Recycling service started in 1989 as part of a Maryland initiative to increase recycling to 20% by 1994. The same year a $52 million project was earmarked to bring the landfill into compliance with Maryland Environmental regulations. By 1990, Alpha Ridge operations cost $75 a ton. In 1992, Howard County proposed to expand the landfill, beyond its original 2.3 million ton capacity. $11 million was budgeted to install cell liners on the remainder of the property to bring capacity up to 6.8 million tons. Citizen opposed the expansion showing documentation from 1978 that the intent was not to expand. Public hearings on expansion in February were emptied by the fire marshal for overcrowding. In 1993, Ecker sought alternatives as groundwater contamination suits were imminent. He proposed a regional trash incinerator facility with Anne Arundel County to provide power to NSA. On 8 June 1994, the County Council voted 5-0 to start transporting trash out of the county. An Anne Arundel transfer site was choose for the USA Waste residential contract and the historic Trinity Church graveyard in Elkridge was selected as a transfer station for the BFI commercial waste contract by creating a solid waste overlay zoning for the site. Alpha ridge remained in operation as hearings were held about lack of notification for the Elkridge waste transfer facility, and concerns about importing out of county residential waste. The redirection of waste at Alpha Ridge lost the $60 per ton commercial waste revenue, but reduced the residential collection expense to $33 a ton. Alpha Ridge remains open as a recycling center and transfer station. The Trinity Church trash transfer location was converted to the Blue Stream Housing development in 2014.|$|E

The focus of many of Texas districts in the Texas Department of Transportation (TXDOT) is the maintenance and rehabilitation of the existing highway network. The rural districts now have large portions of their networks which need major rehabilitation and reconstruction. Many districts are experimenting with innovative rehabilitation strategies for repairing the wide range of pavement types found around the state. One area of major interest is in rehabilitating thin flexible pavements which are near the end of their service lives. I PROBLEM STATEMENT To address this problem in a cost-effective manner, some of the districts have been actively recycling thin surfaced pavements and stabilizing bases in an attempt to correct deterioration and increase the structural capacity. In a one pass operation the existing surface and base are mixed and stabilized with small quantities of either lime or cement. Frequently the reshaped and <b>compacted</b> <b>base</b> is simply sealed with a one course surface treatment. For higher volume roads sometimes a new grade I flexible base is added with a thin asphalt surfacing. The goal of this research is to investigate the performance of existing projects and evaluate the impact of the different variables (like stabilizer type, percentage, thickness of layer, etc.) used during their construction. 1. 2 RESEARCH CONCLUSIONS Monitoring of the sections included visual condition assessment, structural strength testing with falling weight deflectometer (FWD) and Dynaflect, Dyna@c Cone Penetrometer (DCP) testing and Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR). In general, describe the following:) Comparison of DCP tests results with the back calculated subgrade modulus as estimated from MODULUS 5. 1.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to evaluate the life cycle costs and market barriers associated with using reflective paving materials in streets and parking lots as a way to reduce the urban heat island effect. We calculated and compared the life cycle costs of conventional asphalt concrete (AC) pavements to those of other existing pavement technologies with higher reflectivity-portland cement concrete (PCC), porous pavements, resin pavements, AC pavements using light-colored chip seals, and AC pavements using light-colored asphalt emulsion additives. We found that for streets and parking lots, PCC can provide a cost-effective alternative to conventional AC when severely damaged pavements must be completely reconstructed. We also found that rehabilitating damaged AC streets and intersections with thin overlays of PCC (ultra-thin white topping) can often provide a cost-effective alternative to standard rehabilitation techniques using conventional AC. Chip sealing is a common maintenance treatment for low-volume streets which, when applied using light-colored chips, could provide a reflective pavement surface. If the incremental cost of using light-colored chips is low, this chip sealing method could also be cost-effective, but the incremental costs of light-colored chips are as of yet uncertain and expected to vary. Porous pavements were found to have higher life cycle costs than conventional AC in parking lots, but several cost-saving features of porous pavements fell outside the boundaries of this study. Resin pavements were found to be only slightly more expensive than conventional AC, but the uncertainties in the cost and performance data were large. The use of light-colored additives in asphalt emulsion seal coats for parking lot pavements was found to be significantly more expensive than conventional AC, reflecting its current niche market of decorative applications. We also proposed two additional approaches to increasing the reflectivity of conventional AC, which we call the chipping and aggregate methods, and calculated their potential life cycle costs. By analyzing the potential for increased pavement durability resulting from these conceptual approaches, we then estimated the incremental costs that would allow them to be cost-effective compared to conventional AC. For our example case of Los Angeles, we found that those allowable incremental costs range from less than $ 1 to more than $ 11 per square yard ($ 1 to $ 13 per square meter) depending on street type and the condition of the original pavement. Finally, we evaluated the main actors in the pavement market and the existing and potential market barriers associated with reflective pavements. Apart from situations where lifecycle costs are high compared to conventional AC, all reflective paving technologies face a cultural barrier based on the belief that black is better. For PCC, high first costs were found to be the most significant economic barrier, particularly where agencies are cons trained by first cost. Lack of developer standards was found to be a significant institutional barrier to PCC since developers are often not held accountable for the long-term maintenance of roads after initial construction, which creates a misplaced incentive to build low first-cost pavements. PCC also faces site-specific barriers such as poorly <b>compacted</b> <b>base</b> soils and proximity to areas of frequent utility cutting...|$|E
