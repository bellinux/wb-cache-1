As a novel, grand <b>AI</b> <b>challenge,</b> General Game Playing is {{concerned}} with the development of systems that understand the rules of unknown games and play these games well without human intervention. In this paper, we show how Answer Set Programming can assist a general game player with the special class of single-player games. To this end, we present a translation from the general Game Description Language (GDL) into answer set programs (ASP). Correctness of this mapping is established by proving that the stable models of the resulting ASP coincide with the possible developments of the original GDL game. We report on experiments with single-player games from past AAAI General Game Playing Competitions which substantiate the claim that Answer Set Programming can provide valuable support to general game playing systems for this type of games. ...|$|R

30|$|Finally, {{we should}} {{remember}} that AI mimics human intelligence. Radiologists are key people for several current <b>AI</b> <b>challenges,</b> such as the creation of high-quality training datasets, definition of the clinical task to address, and interpretation of obtained results. Many labelled studies and findings provided by experienced radiologists are needed; those datasets are difficult to find and are time-consuming, implying high costs [3]. However, even if crucial, the radiologist’s role should not be confined to data labelling. Radiologists may play {{a pivotal role in}} the identification of clinical applications where AI methods may make the difference. Indeed, they represent the final user of these technologies, who knows where they can be applied to improve patient care. For this reason, their point of view is crucial to optimise the use of AI-based solutions in the clinical setting. Finally, the application of AI-based algorithms often leads to the creation of complex data that need to be interpreted and linked to their clinical utility. In this scenario, radiologists may {{play a crucial role in}} data interpretation, cooperating with data scientists in the definition of useful results.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Bart Selman AI {{textbooks}} and papers often discuss the big questions, such as "how {{to reason with}} uncertainty", "how to reason efficiently", or "how to improve performance through learning.

40|$|Answering science {{questions}} posed in natural language {{is an important}} <b>AI</b> <b>challenge.</b> Answering such questions often requires non-trivial inference and knowledge that goes beyond factoid retrieval. Yet, most systems for this task are based on relatively shallow Information Retrieval (IR) and statistical correlation techniques operating on large unstructured corpora. We propose a structured inference system for this task, formulated as an Integer Linear Program (ILP), that answers natural language questions using a semi-structured knowledge base derived from text, including questions requiring multi-step inference and a combination of multiple facts. On a dataset of real, unseen science questions, our system significantly outperforms (+ 14 %) the best previous attempt at structured reasoning for this task, which used Markov Logic Networks (MLNs). It also improves upon a previous ILP formulation by 17. 7 %. When combined with unstructured inference methods, the ILP system significantly boosts overall performance (+ 10 %). Finally, we show our approach is substantially more robust to a simple answer perturbation compared to statistical correlation methods.
