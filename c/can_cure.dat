5|$|In Cambodia, {{the deeply}} rooted {{tradition}} {{of using the}} Bengal and pygmy slow lorises in traditional medicine is widespread, and the pygmy slow loris is the most commonly requested animal in traditional medicine shops in Cambodia's capital, Phnom Penh. Some {{people in the country}} believe dried slow loris <b>can</b> <b>cure</b> cancer. Slow lorises are also smoked for other traditional remedies. Traditional Khmer medicine practitioners in that region claim that medicines made from slow lorises <b>can</b> <b>cure</b> 100diseases, with some practitioners from the National Centre for Traditional Medicine reporting that slow loris are sometimes roasted alive under the assumption that this increases the medicine's potency. Slow lorises are also burned alive, causing their eyes to burst and release a liquid called minyak kukang (or loris oil), which is used in black magic and traditional medicine and is supposed to have life-giving qualities and act as a love potion.|$|E
5|$|Mulder later tells Scully that {{he wants}} to reveal the {{conspiracy}} to the public. As he is leaving, he meets with The Smoking Man who tells him that he <b>can</b> <b>cure</b> Scully's cancer by using a chip included in the vial Mulder took from the Pentagon. Meanwhile, Kritschgau goes before the FBI panel, denying any knowledge of Ostelhoff's murderer, also revealing that his son died that morning. Kritschgau claims to work for not only the Department of Defense but also a congressional lobbying firm known as Roush. Mulder sees Scully and her doctor about the chip. Scully's family is skeptical, particularly her brother Bill, who is quite upset with Mulder. Scully decides to go ahead and have the chip inserted in her neck.|$|E
5|$|The initial aim of {{treatment}} is {{to settle the}} symptoms of an acute attack. Repeated attacks can be prevented by medications that reduce serum uric acid levels. Tentative evidence supports the application of ice for 20 to 30 minutes {{several times a day}} to decrease pain. Options for acute treatment include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), colchicine and steroids. While steroids and NSAIDs work equally well, steroids may be safer. Options for prevention include allopurinol, febuxostat, and probenecid. Lowering uric acid levels <b>can</b> <b>cure</b> the disease. Treatment of associated health problems is also important. Lifestyle interventions have been poorly studied. It is unclear whether dietary supplements have an effect in people with gout.|$|E
40|$|Perishable <b>canned</b> <b>cured</b> meat inoculated with Clostridium botulinum spores {{was placed}} at 4. 4 or 10 degrees C after manufacture. Spore {{germination}} occurred at 10 degrees C. The germinated cell count remained stable {{over a period}} of 16 to 18 weeks. During that time period the inhibitory system and residual nitrite descreased. These factors combine to make perishable <b>canned</b> <b>cured</b> meats more prone to spoilage and potential hazard if they are temperature abused after a period of refrigerated storage...|$|R
40|$|The {{method by}} which sodium nitrite may act to prevent {{germination}} or outgrowth, or both, of heat-injured spores in <b>canned</b> <b>cured</b> meats was investigated by using Clostridium perfringens spores. Four possible mechanisms were tested: (i) prevention of germination of the heat-injured spores, (ii) prior combination with a component in a complex medium to prevent germination of heat-injured spores, (iii) inhibition of outgrowth of heat-injured spores, and (iv) induction of germination (which would render the spore susceptible to thermal inactivation). Only the third mechanism was effective with the entire spore population when levels of sodium nitrite commercially acceptable in <b>canned</b> <b>cured</b> meats were used. Concentrations of 0. 02 and 0. 01 % prevented outgrowth of heat-sensitive and heat-resistant spores, respectively. Nitrite-induced germination occurred with higher sodium nitrite concentrations...|$|R

5|$|The risk of {{developing}} pancreatic cancer is lower among non-smokers, and people who maintain a healthy weight and limit their consumption of red or processed meat. A smoker's chance {{of developing}} the disease decreases if they stop smoking, and almost returns {{to that of the}} rest of the population after 20years. Pancreatic cancer can be treated with surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, palliative care, or a combination of these. Treatment options are partly based on the cancer stage. Surgery is the only treatment that <b>can</b> <b>cure</b> pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and may also be done to improve quality of life without the potential for cure. Pain management and medications to improve digestion are sometimes needed. Early palliative care is recommended even for those receiving treatment that aims for a cure.|$|E
5|$|Percy tells Annabeth {{about his}} dreams, and she deduces that Grover {{has found the}} Golden Fleece, which <b>can</b> <b>cure</b> Thalia's {{poisoned}} tree, and {{is located at the}} coordinates from the Gray Sisters. Tantalus (who replaced Chiron as camp counselor) sends Clarisse La Rue on a quest to find the Golden Fleece. Percy, Annabeth, and Tyson run away from camp to find Grover. They are aided in their escape by the god Hermes, who helps them reach a passing cruise ship, the Princess Andromeda. Once aboard, they discover that the ship is full of tourists in a dream-like state living alongside Greek monsters. They are captured by Luke Castellan and learn that he is trying to revive his master Kronos. They escape on a lifeboat and eventually find one of many hideouts that Luke, Thalia, and Annabeth built as children. They are attacked by a hydra but are saved by Clarisse, who is sailing on a confederate ironclad called the CSS Birmingham.|$|E

25|$|Auriculotherapy, {{commonly}} known as ear acupuncture, auricular acupuncture, or auriculoacupuncture, is considered to date back to ancient China. It involves inserting needles to stimulate points on the outer ear. The modern approach was developed in France during the early 1950s. There is no scientific evidence that it <b>can</b> <b>cure</b> disease; the evidence of effectiveness is negligible.|$|E

25|$|Another {{prominent}} {{aspect of}} the Mami Wata deities is their connection to healing. If someone comes down with an incurable, languorous illness, Mami Wata often takes the blame. The illness is evidence that Mami Wata has taken {{an interest in the}} afflicted person and that only she <b>can</b> <b>cure</b> him or her. Similarly, several other ailments may be attributed to the water spirit. In Nigeria, for example, she takes the blame for everything from headaches to sterility.|$|E
25|$|The {{discovery}} that certain toxic chemicals administered in combination <b>can</b> <b>cure</b> certain cancers ranks {{as one of}} the greatest in modern medicine. Childhood ALL, testicular cancer, and Hodgkins disease, previously universally fatal, are now generally curable diseases. Conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy has shown the ability to cure some cancers, including testicular cancer, Hodgkin disease, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and some leukemias. It has also proved effective in the adjuvant setting, in reducing the risk of recurrence after surgery for high-risk breast cancer, colon cancer, and lung cancer, among others.|$|E

25|$|Aid {{in dealing}} with the spirit world may be {{obtained}} from a kru (shaman or spirit practitioner), an achar (ritualist), thmup (witch, sorcerer or sorceress), or a rup arak (medium, usually male). The kru is a kind of sorcerer who prepares charms and amulets to protect the wearer from harm. He <b>can</b> <b>cure</b> illnesses, find lost objects, and prepare magic potions. Traditionally, Cambodians have held strong beliefs about protective charms. Amulets are worn routinely by soldiers to ward off bullets, for example. The kru are believed to have the power to prepare an amulet and to establish a supernatural link between it and the owner. A kru may acquire considerable local prestige and power. Many kru are former Buddhist monks.|$|E
25|$|After Noah is blinded in an {{accident}} at film school, he breaks off with Luke, feeling a need to be independent and blaming Luke, because the couple had been arguing {{at the time of}} the accident. Noah finds a specialist, neurosurgeon Reid Oliver, whom he believes he <b>can</b> <b>cure</b> his sight, and Luke tries to lure the arrogant doctor to Oakdale; when promises of money do not work, he successfully blackmails him. In spite of this rocky start, the pair gradually fall in love. When Noah eventually begins to consider reuniting with Luke, Luke is torn - both angry at Noah's prior treatment and confused by his feelings for Reid. Reid eventually resigns from the hospital when he realizes that he must either do so or break off his relationship with Luke, the hospital's biggest donor, but is soon reinstated. Tragically, Reid is mortally injured when his car is struck by a train.|$|E
