5000|$|Circa 1803, {{according}} to William Pattee's History of Old Braintree and Quincy (1878) Josiah Bemis, George Stearns, and Michael Wild developed a splitting method similar in concept to the plug and feather method. This technique for splitting stone (referred to by modern researchers as the [...] "Flat Wedge Method") entailed cutting slots {{in a shallow}} line into the stone using a <b>cape</b> <b>chisel</b> struck with a large hammer. Small, flat metal wedges were then driven between shims made of sheet iron. The method of feathers and plugs began to be employed around this time, and spread rapidly throughout the region. Evidence of stone split with both methods indicate the evolution of this technique. The method using the <b>cape</b> <b>chisel</b> created long rectangular slots, whereas the newer method, using a plug drill, left round holes.|$|E
