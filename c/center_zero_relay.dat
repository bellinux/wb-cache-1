The method is based on the approximation by the truncated Taylor series about <b>center</b> <b>zero.</b> Duffing equation and conditions are transformed into the matrix equations, which corresponds to a system of nonlinear algebraic equations with the unknown coefficients, via collocation points. Combining these matrix equations and then solving the system yield the unknown coefficients of the solution function. Numerical examples are included to demonstrate the validity and the applicability of the technique. The results show the efficiency and the accuracy of the present work.
