40|$|In this study, {{the effects}} of non-sidelooking {{airborne}} radar clutter dispersion on space-time adaptive processing (STAP) is considered, and an efficient adaptive angle-Doppler compensation (EAADC) approach is proposed to improve the clutter suppression performance. In {{order to reduce the}} computational complexity, the reduced-dimension sparse reconstruction (RDSR) technique is introduced into the angle-Doppler spectrum estimation to extract the required parameters for compensating the clutter spectral <b>center</b> <b>misalignment.</b> Simulation results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm are presented...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — The {{performance}} of clutter-cancellation GMTI (Ground Moving Target Indication) radar can suffer when observing uneven terrain when the array phase centers are not {{aligned with the}} radar vehicle's velocity vector. This type of phase <b>center</b> <b>misalignment</b> is present {{in a number of}} existing and proposed GMTI systems. A method for mitigating this problem using a DEM (Digital Elevation Model) for the terrain is described and demonstrated in this paper. The DEM is incorporated into the radar data {{in such a way that}} the nonstationarity caused by hilly terrain is greatly reduced, thus allowing reduced-order STAP (Space-Time Adaptive Processing) to be applied...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a {{theoretical}} study {{to the effect}} of journal misalignment on the static characteristics of oil filled porous journal bearing when lubricated with couple stress fluid has been carried out. The analytical model used through this work is for a bearing with isotropic permeability. Considering isotropic permeability the Reynolds' equation for the oil film is modified to include a so  called filter term and the effect of fluid coupled stress. The pressure equation for the porous medium is obtained from Darcy's law and continuity equation. The equation which was used to evaluate the oil film thickness was modified to include the effect of possible misalignment in longitudinal and transverse directions. The governing equations with appropriate boundary conditions are numerically solved using a suitable numerical technique. A computer program has been prepared to solve the governing equations. The validity of the program has been tested by comparing the results obtained through this work with that published in available works. The comparison shows a good agreement between the results obtained through this work and that published by other workers. By comparing the behavior of aligned and misaligned bearing {{it was found that the}} journal <b>center</b> <b>misalignment</b> has a considerable effect on the performance parameters of the bearing which can not be neglected...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the effects of bistatic clutter spectral dispersion on STAP techniques. A new spectral slope-based approach is presented for mitigating the bistatic geometry-induced performance loss by pre-processing the secondary data used for covariance estimation. Due to its capability to compensate both the clutter spectral <b>centers</b> <b>misalignment</b> and the trace slope variability over range, this approach is shown to yield further dispersion reduction with respect to previously proposed strategies thus improving the performance of STAP. © 2007 IEEE...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- In this {{contribution}} {{we develop}} a theoretical statistical approach {{to predict the}} acceptable bandwidth tolerances for optical filter cascades in wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) networks. We also establish tolerances for the <b>center</b> frequency <b>misalignments</b> considering a statistical approach presented in a previous work. The optical filters analyzed have a trapezoidal shape, and different bandwidths are considered for the study. The analytical results are validated with system simulations. Key-Words:- WDM optical network, optical filtering, filter cascadability, bandwidth variation, frequency misalignment, system performance. ...|$|R
40|$|Several {{advanced}} modulation formats {{have been}} suggested {{over the last few}} years as the substitutes to typically used non-return-to-zero and return-to-zero formats in WDM systems. Exhaustive research and field trials have been performed and reported comparing their characteristics and enhancement to impairments such as fibre dispersion and nonlinearities. This work sets these formats in a metropolitan area network scenario where narrow optical filtering arises as another deleterious effect. The resilience of the modulation formats to filtering and laser <b>center</b> frequency allowable <b>misalignment</b> has been studied, compared and presented in this thesis at a bit rate of 40 Gbit/s...|$|R
30|$|When {{the vehicle}} reached the water surface, the fluid torque {{influenced}} {{the motion of}} vehicle and increased with high initial angle of attack. As the vehicle entered water, the buoyancy and buoyancy <b>center</b> changed. The <b>misalignment</b> between center-of-gravity position and buoyant center resulted to another torque. Both torques were affected simultaneously. When α <  0 °, the initial angle of attack and fluid torque were both negative. The vehicle began to rotate downwards. The increase of slope angle caused the negative increase of the angle of attack and rotational angular velocity. Both torques accelerated the change of angle of attack and slope angle when the vehicle entered the water completely. The overturn occurred downwards when the slope angle exceeded the threshold. When α ≥  0 °, the initial angle of attack and fluid torque were both positive. The vehicle began to rotate upwards. The decrease of slope angle caused the positive increase of the angle of attack and rotational angular velocity. Both torques accelerated the change of angle of attack and slope angle when the vehicle entered the water completely. The overturn occurred upwards when the slope angle exceeded the threshold. Choosing the proper water-entry angle of attack is important to avoid the overturn phenomenon.|$|R
40|$|Aurora kinases (AURKs) are conserved serine/threonine kinases, {{crucial in}} {{regulating}} cell cycle events. Mammalian oocytes express all three Aurk isoforms throughout meiosis, with AurkA being the predominant isoform. Inhibition of all AURK isoforms by pharmacological means disrupts oocyte meiosis. Therefore, AurkA short interfering RNA (siRNA) {{was performed to}} silence AurkA gene expression in mouse oocytes and to further assess the function of AurkA during meiosis by analyzing subsequent loss-of-function oocyte phenotypes. Results indicated that AurkA siRNA applied in our experiments specifically knocked down both AurkA gene and protein expression without influencing transcript levels of AurkB / AurkC and other endogenous protein expression, such as GAPDH and ERK- 2. AURKA was not essential for resumption of meiosis, but it potentiated oocyte meiotic progression. Knockdown of AurkA led to {{a significant reduction in}} the number of oocytes proceeding to metaphase II (MII). AurkA siRNA resulted in abnormal spindle assembly, improper localization of microtubule organizing <b>centers</b> (MTOCs) and <b>misalignment</b> of chromosomes in metaphase I (MI) oocytes. Co-immunoprecipitations demonstrated that AURKA was physically associated with phospho-Histone H 3 ser 10 in meiotic oocytes. AurkA siRNA dramatically reduced Histone H 3 ser 10 phosphorylation, but not ser 28, and resulted in a significant increase of abnormal chromosome segregation in MII oocytes. In conclusion, as a predominant isoform among Aurks in oocytes, AurkA plays critical roles in mouse oocyte meiosis by regulating spindle and chromosome dynamics. Mol. Reprod.
