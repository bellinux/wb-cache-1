40|$|The {{purpose of}} my thesis is {{to point out}} the {{increase}} of the amount of the petty cases, to analyze its reasons, to describe the development of the relevant legislation and case law and to deal with some main legal arguments related to the issue of the reimbursement of the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>proceedings</b> in petty cases. The reason for my research is mainly its topicality and rapid evolution in a few past years. The boom of the mass claim recovery realized by the specialized "debt companies" was the reason of the legislative amendments and led to the ground-breaking decisions of the Constitutional Court, which resulted in the repeal of the regulation No. 484 / 2000 Coll. The thesis is composed of the introduction, four chapters and conclusion.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{monograph}} is {{to describe}} and analyse the Czech regulation of evidence taking in its complexity and entirety. Since the monograph is primarily destined for foreign lawyers, not only the legal regulation but also its reflection by the Czech legal theory as well as judicial practice is examined. Thus, the added value of this publication is that it not only describes the legal regulation itself, but also demonstrates on numerous case law produced by Constitutional Court and Supreme Court its real functioning in daily judicial practice. This allows {{better understanding of how}} the whole system of evidence taking in the Czech civil procedure works. The publication offers an extensive summary and analysis of regulation of the Czech civil procedure related to the evidence taking. In order to ensure such complex approach, {{the first part of the}} monograph is dedicated to fundamental and general principles of the Czech civil procedure which are crucial for the regulation of various aspects of evidence taking. Since the concept of evidence may be different in various jurisdictions, the monograph also examines the value and importance of evidence in the Czech law as well as principles and standards of its collection and subsequent judicial evaluation. Due to the existing differences in various jurisdictions, special attention is dedicated especially to the written evidence and to the role and importance of experts and witnesses in judicial proceedings. The recent judicial practice often has to deal with foreign elements (foreign witness, document in foreign language etc.) in judicial proceedings. For this reason the publication also examines various aspects of translation and interpretation in Czech judicial proceedings. The attention is dedicated also to <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>proceedings.</b> Covered are the principles on which the payment of costs is based as well as rules governing which party and to which extent will bear them. Last chapter examines the concept of “illegally obtained evidence” and “illegal evidence” in the Czech civil procedure. Thus, the focus is put on rules regulating which evidence is according to the Czech Civil Procedure Code as interpreted by Czech highest courts permissible in civil procedure...|$|E

Eva Alexander Chair: Civil Law Date (final draft) : 30 June 2014 Key words: <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> legal <b>proceedings,</b> reimbursement <b>of</b> legal fees, small claims The thesis analyzes the Czech legal rules {{relating to the}} <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> civil judicial <b>proceedings,</b> in particular the attorneys' fees. In the first part, the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> civil judicial <b>proceedings</b> are described in general, including out-of-pocket expenses of parties and their representatives and counsel, court fees, lost wages, evidence and interpreting costs and notarial fees. The first part further focuses on payment and reimbursement <b>of</b> <b>costs.</b> Under Czech law, the losing party must reimburse the successful party at the rate determined by the statutory rules.

40|$|Improper exeercising {{of parental}} {{authority}} becomes {{a subject of}} legal intervention whenever interests of a child are threatened or infringed upon. In that situation there is a competence for intervention actualized in the guardianship mode. In particular cases though, improper excercising of parental authority, including educational obligations {{can result in a}} criminal responsibility of parents. Criminal responsibility of parents for negligence in education (upbringing) is not regulated directly in Polish Penal Code (P. C.). Only some forms of depravation of children eg. in the sphere of sexual life, or inducing children to drink heavily, are penalized. There is also a possibility provided of deciding an additional penalty of depravation of parental rights in case of conviction for a crime perpetrated to the detriment of a minor, with minor's cooperation or in circimstances being a demoralizing example for a minor (art. 41 P. C.). The basic regulation of penal law protecting a child against educational negligence is found in art. 105 of Code of Pety Offences. It provides that anyone admitting a minor to commit an act forbidden by law as a crime or petty offence and indicating at demoralization, by means of flagrant breaching of obligations resulting from parental authority is subjected to criminal responsibility for a petty offence. In practice that norm does not play any substantial role. Civil liability of parents for lack of supervision upon a child who caused damage is also possible. The new measures against parents for the improper excercising of educational duties to the child who demonstrates demoralization or perpetrates a penalized act were introduced in the Act of October 26, 1982 of Proceeding in the Cases of Minors. It provides a possibility of obliging parents to redress a damage caused by the minor and of notifying their employers and organizations they are members of if the parents or a guardian permit the childs demoralization in course of their committed non-fullfillment of duties towards the child. The Act provides also a possibility to inflict a fine of 500 - 5000 zł upon the parents if they are seeking to avoid performing obligations set on them by family court. There is also a general principle introduced of having <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>proceedings</b> in a case of minor incurred by his parents. Handling a problem of parental responsibility in the Act can raise many doubts. These are still fostered by the regulation of these corrective measures which consist in taking a child away from his natural milieu. They can be considered as such an extensive intervention in the parental authority that one can easily view them as a concealed form of parental responsibility for an improper conduct of their child.

40|$|This report {{presents}} {{the findings from}} the evaluation of the first pilot Family Drug and Alcohol Court (FDAC) in Britain. FDAC is a new approach to care proceedings, in cases where parental substance misuse is a key element in the local authority decision to bring proceedings. It is being piloted at the Inner London Family Proceedings Court in Wells Street. Initially the pilot was to run for three years, to the end of December 2010, but is now to continue until March 2012. The work is co-funded by the Department for Education (formerly the Department for Children, Schools and Families), the Ministry of Justice, the Home Office, the Department of Health and the three pilot authorities (Camden, Islington and Westminster). The evaluation was conducted by a research team at Brunel University, with funding from the Nuffield Foundation and the Home Office. FDAC is a specialist court for a problem that is anything but special. Its potential to help break the inter-generational cycle of harm associated with parental substance misuse goes straight to the heart of public policy and professional practice. Parental substance misuse is a formidable social problem and a key factor in around a third of long-term cases in children’s services in some areas. It is a major risk factor for child maltreatment, family separation and offending in adults, and for poor educational performance and substance misuse by children and young people. The parents’ many difficulties create serious problems for their children and place major demands on health, welfare and criminal justice services. For these reasons, parental substance misuse is a cross-cutting government agenda. FDAC is distinctive because it is a court-based family intervention which aims to improve children’s outcomes by addressing the entrenched difficulties of their parents. It has been adapted to English law and practice from a model of family treatment drug courts that is used widely in the USA and is showing promising results with a higher number of cases where parents and children were able to remain together safely, and with swifter alternative placement decisions for children if parents were unable to address their substance misuse successfully. The catalysts for the FDAC pilot were the encouraging evidence from the USA and concerns about the response to parental substance misuse through ordinary care proceedings in England: poor coordination of adult and children’s services; late interventions to protect children; delays in reaching decisions in court; and soaring <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>proceedings,</b> linked to the cost of expert evidence. The work is co-funded by the Department for Education (formerly the Department for Children, Schools and Families), the Ministry of Justice, the Home Office, the Department of Health and the three pilot authorities (Camden, Islington and Westminster). 1 The evaluation was conducted by a research team at Brunel University, with funding from the Nuffield Foundation and the Home Office...|$|E

In Iran, before the enactment of the Commercial Code, the provisions relating to insolvency were applied to both merchants and non-merchants; but following the enactment of that code, merchants are subject to the bankruptcy regulations, and non-merchants are subject to the insolvency regulations. As a whole, the common denominator between all regulations of bankruptcy and insolvency is the failure of payment of debts and liabilities having been upon the bankrupt or the insolvent. Request for the insolvency <b>of</b> the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>proceedings</b> and judgment debt on behalf of the merchant who claims for insolvency is rejected; but, according to the provisions of the Commercial Code, the merchant ought to petition for bankruptcy.
