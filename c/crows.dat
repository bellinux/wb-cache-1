5|$|Visual {{differentiation}} {{from the}} fish crow (C. ossifragus) {{is extremely difficult}} and often inaccurate. Nonetheless, differences apart from size do exist. Fish <b>crows</b> {{tend to have more}} slender bills and feet. There may also be a small sharp hook {{at the end of the}} upper bill. Fish <b>crows</b> also appear as if they have shorter legs when walking. More dramatically, when calling, fish <b>crows</b> tend to hunch and fluff their throat feathers.|$|E
5|$|Adult mockingbirds {{can fall}} victim to birds of prey such as the great horned owl, screech owl and sharp-shinned hawk, though their {{tenacious}} behavior makes them less likely to being captured. Scrub-jays also have killed and eaten mockingbirds. Snakes rarely capture incubating females. Fledgelings have been prey to domestic cats, red-tailed hawks, and <b>crows.</b> Eggs and nestlings are consumed by blue jays, fish <b>crows</b> and American <b>crows,</b> red-tailed hawks, swallow-tailed kites, snakes, squirrels, and cats. Blowfly larvae and Haemoproteus {{have been found in}} Florida and Arizona populations, respectively.|$|E
5|$|American <b>crows</b> are {{socially}} monogamous cooperative breeding birds.

Offspring from a previous nesting season will usually remain with the family to assist in rearing new nestlings. American <b>crows</b> do not reach breeding age {{for at least two}} years. Most do not leave the nest to breed for four to five years.|$|E

5|$|If seen {{flying at}} a {{distance}} from where size estimates are unreliable, the distinctly larger common ravens (C. corax) can be distinguished by their almost lozenge-shaped tail and their larger-looking heads.

Ravens also soar for extended periods, unlike <b>crows,</b> which rarely fly more than a few seconds without flapping their wings.|$|E

50|$|The Cuban <b>crow</b> (Corvus nasicus) {{is one of}} four {{species of}} <b>crow</b> that occur on a few key islands in the Caribbean.

The fourth Caribbean <b>crow,</b> the palm <b>crow</b> (C. palmarum), is a later arrival in {{evolutionary}} terms and shows characteristics more akin to North American species such as the fish <b>crow</b> (C. ossifragus), which it is probably closely related to.|$|R

When the <b>crow</b> insists on being let in, the sparrow admits the <b>crow</b> to her home, and invites the <b>crow</b> to dry herself on the stove. The <b>crow</b> does so and is burnt to death.

5|$|The disease runs most {{rampant in}} the {{subtropical}} conditions which encourage reproduction of its mosquito vectors among which Culex tarsalis is most significant. Mortality rates {{appear to be}} higher than those in other birds, causing local population losses of up to 72% in a single season. Because of this, American <b>crows</b> are a sentinel species indicating the presence of West Nile virus in an area. <b>Crows</b> cannot transmit the virus to humans directly.|$|E

The <b>crows</b> almost overwhelm the convoy, killing Nurse Betty and Otto and taking out the flamethrower operator, causing the weapon to careen out of control. Alice finally appears and saves Carlos and the others from a fiery death, using her telekinesis to fill the sky with fire, killing the <b>crows</b> and leaving her unconscious. After recovering, Alice is introduced to Claire and gives her the diary she found, and she and Carlos then convince Claire to take her convoy to Alaska.|$|E
5|$|American <b>crows</b> are {{protected}} internationally by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918. Despite attempts by humans {{in some areas}} to drive away or eliminate these birds, they remain widespread and very common. The number of individual American <b>crows</b> is estimated by BirdLife International to be around 31,000,000. The large population, {{as well as its}} vast range, are the reasons why the American crow is considered to be of least concern, meaning that the species is not threatened.|$|E

5|$|Painted turtles {{are most}} {{vulnerable}} to predators when young. Nests are frequently ransacked and the eggs eaten by garter snakes, <b>crows,</b> chipmunks, thirteen-lined ground and gray squirrels, skunks, groundhogs, raccoons, badgers, gray and red fox, and humans. The small and sometimes bite-size, numerous hatchlings fall prey to water bugs, bass, catfish, bullfrogs, snapping turtles, three types of snakes (copperheads, racers and water snakes), herons, rice rats, weasels, muskrats, minks, and raccoons. As adults, the turtles' armored shells protect them from many potential predators, but they still occasionally fall prey to alligators, ospreys, <b>crows,</b> red-shouldered hawks, bald eagles, and especially raccoons.|$|E
