During this refit, on 17 July 1920, she received the designation AD-10 when the Navy adopted the alphanumeric system of hull <b>classification</b> <b>and</b> <b>identification.</b> Her battery underwent its third change when her [...] guns were upgraded from the 40-caliber to the 51-caliber model. Bridgeport remained in the yard until 20 August, when she returned to Newport. Back at New York {{at the end of the}} month, Bridgeport received orders to join in the rescue effort for submarine [...] that had sunk off the Delaware capes during post-overhaul trials. The destroyer tender left the anchorage off Tompkinsville late on 2 September and reached the scene late the following morning. Bridgeport remained in the vicinity until late the next day when she headed back to New York to reembark some of her crewmen left behind as a result of her hasty departure.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} (1) the {{submission to}} the ISMIR’ 04 genre <b>classification</b> contest <b>and</b> (2) the submission to the MIREX’ 05 (Music Information Retrieval eXchange) audio-based genre <b>classification</b> <b>and</b> artist <b>identification</b> tasks. The main {{difference between the}} submissions is the reduction of computation time {{in the order of}} magnitudes. This paper concludes with a discussion of the relationship between genre <b>classification</b> <b>and</b> artist <b>identification,</b> the relationship between similarity <b>and</b> <b>classification,</b> <b>and</b> references to related MIREX’ 05 submissions. 1 IMPLEMENTATION OVERVIEW Features are extracted from 22 kHz mono wav input (2 minutes from the center of each piece are used for further analysis). For the 2004 submission these features are cluster models of MFCC spectra. The 2005 submission additionally uses fluctuation patterns and two descriptors derived from them: Gravity and Focus. For each piece in the test set the distance to all pieces in the training set is computed. A nearest neighbor classifier is used. There is no training other than storing the features of the training data. Each piece in the test set is assigned the genre label (or artist’s name) of the piece closest to it. 1. 1 M 2 K Specific The functions are implemented in Matlab 7 and submitted with an M 2 K wrapper. The 2004 submission requires the Netlab Toolbox and the signal processing toolbox. The 2005 submission does not require any additional toolboxes. The same functions are used for the genre <b>classification</b> <b>and</b> artist <b>identification</b> tasks. 1. 2 Computation Time The CPU times given in Table 1 are measured on a 1. 3 GHz Intel Centrino laptop. The 2004 submission does not fulfill the MIREX’ 05 time constraints (72 hours per task). For example, it takes 10 days to compute the (symmetric) distance matrix on a collection with 3000 pieces. The 2005 submission completes this in less than 4 hours. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Song {{and music}} {{discrimination}} {{play a significant}} role in multimedia applications such as genre <b>classification</b> <b>and</b> singer <b>identification.</b> Song <b>and</b> music discrimination {{play a significant role}} in multimedia applications such as genre <b>classification</b> <b>and</b> singer <b>identification.</b> The problem of identifying sections of singer voice and instrument signals is addressed in this paper. It must therefore be able to detect when a singer starts and stops singing. In addition, it must be efficient in all circumstances that the interpreter is a man or a woman or that he or she has a different register (soprano, alto, baritone, tenor or bass), different styles of music and independent of the number of instruments. Our approach does not assume a priori knowledge of song and music segments. We use simple and efficient threshold-based distance measurements for discrimination. Linde-Buzo-Gray vector quan-tization algorithm and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) are used for comparison purposes. Our approach is validated on a large experimental dataset from the music genre database RWC that includes many styles (25 styles and 272 minutes of data).

40|$|Abstract The {{control and}} the {{diagnosis}} of non-linear systems require modelling <b>and</b> <b>identification</b> techniques, adapted to numerical computation. This paper deals with such issues. Nonlinearities that are considered are dead zones, hysteresis and saturations. These nonlinearities are simplified according to a multimodel approach that has additive unknown inputs and that divides nonlinearities into several discrete-time linear models. These unknown inputs are used to define commutation conditions from one local model to the other. An automaton is proposed as global model. For identification purpose, we propose an algorithm that uses both <b>classification</b> <b>and</b> linear <b>identification</b> techniques. Finally, this algorithm {{is applied to the}} throttle valve of combustion engine...|$|R

40|$|Abstract We {{previously}} {{proposed a}} deformable model for automatic and accurate segmentation of prostate boundary from 3 D ultrasound (US) images by matching both prostate shapes and tissue textures in US images[6]. Textures {{were characterized by}} a Gabor filter bank and further classified by support vector machines (SVM), in order to discriminate the prostate boundary from the US images. However, the step of tissue texture characterization <b>and</b> <b>classification</b> is very slow, which impedes the future applications of the proposed approach in clinic applications. To overcome this limitation, we firstly implement it in a 3 -level multi-resolution framework, and then replace the step of SVM-based tissue <b>classification</b> <b>and</b> boundary <b>identification</b> by a Zernike moment-based edge detector in both low and middle resolutions, for fast capturing boundary information. In the high resolution, the step of SVM-based tissue <b>classification</b> <b>and</b> boundary <b>identification</b> is still kept for more accurate segmentation. However, SVM is extremely slow for tissue classification as it usually needs {{a large number of}} support vectors to construct a complicated separation hypersurface, due to the high overlay of texture features of prostate and non-prostate tissues in US images. To increase the efficiency of SVM, a new SVM training method is designed by effectively reducing the number of support vectors. Experimental results show that the proposed method is 10 times faster than the previous one, yet without losing any segmentation accuracy. ...|$|R
