40|$|By {{scholarly}} convention, federal {{administrative law}} {{begins in the}} United States in 1887 {{with the establishment of}} the Interstate Commerce Commission. Before that time the national government is perceived as a state of courts and parties in which federal administration was minimal and congressional statutes were either self-executing or so detailed as to preclude significant administrative discretion. Such administration as there was went on within executive departments under the exclusive control of the President, and judicial review of administrative action was virtually unknown. From this perspective the administrative state of the twenty-first century, with its independent commissions, combinations of legislative, executive, and judicial authority in administrative agencies, broad delegations of administrative discretion, limitations on presidential <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>administration,</b> and ubiquitous opportunities for judicial review of executive action, represents a radical transformation of original constitutional understandings. There is much truth in this conventional vision of nineteenth-century governance, but far from the whole truth. This Article begins a project of recovering the lost one hundred years of federal administrative law. For statutory sources, agency practice, and common law actions in the Federalist period reveal a quite different and more nuanced picture. From the very beginning some administrators were clothed with broad statutory authority, made general rules, adjudicated cases, were located outside of departments, and were tightly bound to congressional oversight and direction. And common law actions provided a judicial review that was often more intrusive and robust than we observe in contemporary practice. If there was an original understanding of the structure, function, and <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>administration</b> in early federal law, Federalist practices suggest that it was a much more complex and pragmatic understanding than our conventional account admits...|$|E

40|$|In 1801 the Jeffersonian Republicans {{took charge}} of Congress, the presidency, and the {{national}} administration, determined to roll back the state-building excesses of their Federalist predecessors. In this effort they were partially successful. But the tide {{of history and the}} demands of a growing nation confounded their ambitions. While reclaiming democracy they also built administrative capacity. This Article examines administrative structure and accountability in the Republican era in an attempt to understand the “administrative law” of the early nineteenth century. That inquiry proceeds through two extended case studies: the Jeffersonian embargo of 1807 - 1809 and the multi-decade federal effort to survey and sell the ever-expanding “public domain. ” The first was the most dramatic regulation of commerce attempted by an American national government either before or since. The second began a land office business that dominated the political and legal consciousness of the nation for nearly a century. The embargo tested the limits of administrative coercion and revealed an escalating conflict between the necessities of regulatory administration and judicial review in common law forms. The sale of the public domain required the creation of the first mass administrative adjudication system in the United States and revealed both the ambitions and the limits of congressional <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>administration</b> in a polity ideologically devoted to assembly government. Together these cases describe the early-nineteenth-century approach to a host of familiar topics in contemporary administrative law: presidential versus congressional <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>administration,</b> the propriety and forms of administrative adjudication, policy implementation via general rules, and the appropriate role of judicial review. Perhaps most significantly, both the embargo episode and the efforts to privatize the public domain demonstrate the singular importance of internal administrative control and accountability in maintaining neutrality and consistency in the application of federal law. This “internal law of administration” remains both a crucial and an understudied aspect of American administrative governance...|$|E

However, due to its low water solubility, pungency, and cytotoxicity, its pharmacologic use is limited. In this study, we investigated the effect of capsaicin derivatives of synthetic (e. g., 10 -hydroxy-N-(4 -hydroxy- 3 -methoxybenzyl) decanamide, etc.) and natural (olvanil and dihydrocapsaicin) origin on Madin-Darby Canine Kidney–C 7 cells. Impedance spectroscopy {{was used to determine}} the transepithelial electrical resistance and the capacitance. Permeability assays with fluorescein isothiocyanate–dextran were carried out to evaluate the impact on cell permeability. The results show that lipophilicity could play an important role for the interference with TJ and that the mechanism is independent from the ion channel TRPV- 1 and hence on the flux of calcium into the cells. In summary, we synthesized 4 derivatives of capsaicin of lower lipophilicity and compared their properties with other well-known vanilloids. We show that these compounds are able to enhance the permeability of a hydrophilic macromolecule, by opening the TJ for a shorter time than capsaicin. This behavior is dependent on the lipophilicity of the molecule. Understanding of these phenomena may lead to better <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>administration</b> of therapeutic molecules...|$|E

One important aspect requiring such management is the issue of energy consumption of computing systems, in the perspective of green computing. As these managers address each a specific aspect, {{there is a need for}} using several managers to cover all the domains of administration. However, coordinating them is necessary for proper and effective global administration. Such coordination is a problem of synchronization and logical <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>administration</b> operations that can be applied by autonomous managers on the managed system at a given time in response to events observed on the state of this system. We therefore propose to investigate the use of reactive models with events and states, and discrete control techniques to solve this problem. In this paper, we illustrate this approach by integrating a controller obtained by synchronous programming, based on Discrete Controller Synthesis, in an autonomic system administration infrastructure. The role of this controller is to orchestrate the execution of reconfiguration operations of all administration policies to satisfy properties of logical consistency. We apply this approach to coordinate three managers : two energy-aware ones, which control server provisioning and processor frequency, and a repair manager...|$|E

In the Assembly of Kosovo in two former legislations of its sessions in a few cases the influence (control) of the Government toward the Assembly was evident. Government and political parties in power blocked the regular functioning of the Assembly. Abandoning or nonparticipation in Assembly sessions (boycott) by the Government and the political powers forced the Head of Parliament to interrupt the session due to lack of quorum. Such acts happened upon the request for constituting of ad hoc commissions for control of executive or independent agencies during the interpellations, etc. Relying on the said cases, we came to a conclusion that in several cases the Government had a control upon the Assembly and not vice versa.

40|$|Jacksonian America was {{a country}} in rapid transition. Intensified {{sectional}} divisions, exponential increases in urbanization and immigration, the rise of factory production, and repeated cycles of economic boom and bust helped to fuel an anxious desire for political reform. For Jacksonian Democrats {{the answer to this}} popular yearning was the reconstruction of American democracy—including a broadened electorate, offices open to all, and the elimination of monopoly and other special privileges. Government at the national level was to be kept small and returned to the people. But as is often the case, the institutionalization of democracy demanded a corresponding increase in governmental capacities. Destroying the power of the “Monster Bank” gave new powers and capacities to the Treasury for the management of monetary policy and fiscal transfers. Offices open to all through the new system of “rotation in office” created the need for bureaucratic systems of control that replaced status-based restraints and personal loyalties. And the side effects of technological development, in particular the human carnage that accompanied the rapid expansion of steamboat travel, generated public demand for protection that prompted the creation of a recognizably modern system of health and safety regulation. “The Democracy” established by the Jacksonians both furthered the building of an American administrative state and solidified an emerging nineteenth-century model of American administration law. In that model administrative accountability was preeminently a matter of political oversight and direction and internal hierarchical control. Judicial <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>administration</b> featured a cramped vision of mandamus review combined with almost unlimited personal liability of officials for erroneous action. Although administrative law structured in this fashion seems peculiar, indeed almost invisible, to the twenty-first-century legal imagination, it fit comfortably within Jacksonian democratic ideology...|$|E

Statutes drawn up for the college in 1352 by the bishop of Winchester gave <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>administration,</b> under the chapter, to three officials elected annually from the residentiaries. Of these three, the treasurer was concerned with finance, especially disbursements, the steward with estate management and collecting revenue, and the precentor with the chapel and its services. Chief of the treasurer's duties was paying wages {{to members of the}} college, but he was also responsible for all expenditure made by himself and other officers, except the precentor, and was finally accountable for revenues, which, although collected by the steward, were delivered to him.

Estates In Berkshire and Buckinghamshire were at first managed directly, but by 1361 all except two nearby manors were at farm. With regard to estates at farm, the steward's duties were to arrange leases, make occasional visits of Inspection and collect rents. Towards estates under direct management his responsibilities were heavier, Including constant economic supervision, and holding court. Local officials held office for long periods, and the steward had a permanent lay helper, the steward of the courts. The income of the chapel itself (offerings and gifts) was collected by the precentor who paid from it for the upkeep of the chapel and the services.

40|$|This article consideres {{some key}} {{questions}} of history of Taurica X–XI centuries. Firstly, {{the ending of}} the Khazar period in peninsula. Secondly, the role of Taurica in system of Russian-Byzantine relations in Х century. At last, thirdly, mutual relations of Byzantium and nomads of Northern Black Sea Coast in X–XI centuries. It’s necessary to notice that the sequence and character of events occurring on peninsula are reconstructed on the basis of complex analysis of written, epigraphical, sphragistical and archaeological sources. The analysis of sources testifies that already by the end of IX century considerable part of strategically important mountainous and seaside areas of Taurica located between Cherson and Bospor (socalled “Klimates”) was under direct <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>administration</b> of thema Cherson. For the first time at official level results of process of the statement of a new political and administrative system on peninsula were reflected in Kletorologion of Philotheos (899). Simultaneously in Crimea the church system was improved. As testifies notitia of Nicholas I Mystic (901 – 907), it included five administrative units – archbishops Cherson, Bospor, Gottia, Sugdeja and Fully. History of Taurica in Х century, especially of the second half of century, in many respects defined the Russian-Byzantine relations. The present crisis burst in 80 th of Х century. It was connected with «Korsun campaign» of Prince Vladimir. This work attempts critical analysis of sources on this problem. Among the basic conclusions it is necessary to mention wide scale of Russian military expansion on peninsula at this time, not reflected in written form, but well proved during archaeological research in Cherson, Sugdeja, Aluston, Bospor and Tamatarha. The establishment of new themes in Taurica (Bospor and Sugdeja) and the Tmutarakan princedom in the Asian part of Bospor becomes the basic consequence of military and political opposition of Russia and Byzantium. Comparison of narrative and archaeological sources shows that the nomadic population of peninsula throughout Х – first half of XI centuries remained pechenegs. Approach of “polovtsians period” in the history of Taurica {{in the beginning of the}} second half of XI century had no catastrophic consequences for local population...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a critical {{study of the}} administrative court of Saudi Arabia (Board of Grievances). Its aim is to evaluate the modem Board of Grievances. The study also investigates {{the nature of the}} Board of Grievances, that is, the extent to which its role is entirely administrative according to the Act of 1982, or also contains aspects of an appeal, review, or investigatory court. The study explores the legal nature and jurisdiction of the Board, the appointment, qualifications, and training of its members and processes for their removal or retirement, transfer, promotion, and discipline. It is argued that the Board's membership, jurisdiction and procedures all reflect historical, legal and constitutional factors; and that these influences affect the efficiency of the Board as a mechanism for the legal <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>administration</b> and of grievances against the government. The thesis seeks to identify major changes which would enhance the Board's role and strengthen its contribution {{to the rule of law}} in Saudi Arabia. The first part of the thesis consists of two chapters dealing with the historical, constitutional and legal framework within which the Board operates. Chapter 1 examines the law and constitutional background of Saudi Arabia. The main thrust of this chapter is to place the Board of Grievances within the constitutional and legal environment in which it operates, in other words within the history of the growth of the state itself. Chapter 2 examines the historical development of the Board of Grievances in Islam. The chapter also briefly compares the Islamic Board of Grievances with an institution that has interesting similarities, the Court of Chancery in English legal history. The four chapters of the second part examine the modern Board of Grievances, tracing its development since 1924, and its present jurisdiction, practice, and procedures. Chapter 3 discusses the modem development of the Board of Grievances in Saudi Arabia. The purpose of this chapter is to explain the various stages of the development of the Board of Grievances as established in Saudi Arabia. Chapter 4 examines the composition and structure of the modern Board of Grievances. This chapter also discusses the status of the Board members as administrative judicial officers. Chapter 5 highlights the scope and limits of jurisdiction of the Board of. Grievances. Chapter 6 examines the rules of procedure of the Board of Grievances and its working practices. The concluding Chapter 7 refers to issues arising from the study in order to suggest some reforms necessary to improve the performance of the Board and to satisfy the expectation of the people.

40|$|Three {{years have}} passed on September 1 st since {{judicial}} review of administrative decisions was returned in Poland as principle of the system. This function is performed by a special court which is the Supreme Administrative Court (SAC). Simultaneously, specific provisions were upheld, by virtue of which review of administrative decisions could be sporadically performed by common courts of law and by district courts of labor and social security, According to the Constitutional principle positioning the Supreme Court as the highest judicial organ supervising judicial decisions of a l l courts, it can: overrule decisions of the Supreme Administrative Court by means of extraordinary appeal against a valid judgement answer legal queries directed to it, as well as resolve guiding principles for the judiciary also {{in the range of}} administrative law. On describing model of the SAC competence, the Polish legislator adopted a principle of enumerating clause specifying 20 categories of most typical cases in relations of administrative organ — citizen in art. 196 § 2 of code of administrative procedure, when final decision' of administrative instances can be appealed against to court. Complaint on no decision given can be also lodged in those cases. The SAC competence is further extended in the other acts eg. in cases of censorship or taxation including. State enterprises and other State organizational units. Frequent doubts can be raised in applying the enumerating clause, as to possibility of judicial action on account of ambivalent or too general definition of categories of cases. Similar doubts appear in the notion of „administrative decision" and legal grounds of giving it. Another problem is the range of judicial review in cases where the legislator left decisiongiving or its contents to the discretion of organ, or when the so-called not precise terms are being used. Three year judicial practice indicates that the Court aims at strengthening the institution of judicial review of administrative decisions as the principle of the system. It is manifested by: — following the principle of presumed admissibility of action in case of doubt (in dubio pro actione), — interpreting the notion of "decision" in a way enabling — a wide range of <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>administration</b> and protection of rights of citizens and their organizations. A decision is not excluded from judicial review when it bears a wrong name or is lacking proper external form. On the other hand it is avoided to interfere into a sphere of internal affairs of administration and regulated by not being generally valid provisions, i. e. enacted without a statutory authorisation. Was there any duty imposed on a citizen by decision given on a grounds of these provisions, the SAC would find the decision invalid, — bringing under control all decisions of organizational units which are not organs of State administration in their nature if it is only ascertained that they realize a function of State administration, — complete review of decisions given on grounds of provisions containing not precise terms known also as non clearly defined ones and establishing their judicial interpretation, — review of decisions given at discretion of administration, the Court establishes only whether a case allowed for giving a discretionary decision, or it could be barred at discretion (in refusal). It is also stated whether the procedural regulations were followed, whether substantiation of decision is consistent with the results of proceedings to take evidence, — performing indirect control of legality of executory acts, refusal to apply any act which is inconsistent with statutory law. The Court attempted at making administration follow the principle that imposing duties upon citizens or refusal to grant them rights or refusing them right to behave according to their will can take place only when organ of administration is authorised to do so by the explicit legal provision. Opposition to give administrative decision on grounds of non statutory provisions (not originating in statutes) helps in avoiding regulating relations administrative organ — citizen on their grounds when individual cases have to be settled with by means of decision. Different opinion of the Supreme Court can be raised in some cases, two year practice of the SAC recognizing that decisions of entering and dissolving labor contracts with nominated employees belong to the category of "matters of employment" and are one of 20 categories of cases being under the cognizance of the SAC was objected by the supreme judicature. Judicial decisions related to establishing a scope of judicial control (review) rouse a vivid interest among legal scholars.
