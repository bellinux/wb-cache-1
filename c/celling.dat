The griffins now have to walk to Natick just as they found new home, but Peter thinks that our main journey was Natick as Lois takes an apple and bites it while an old man plays the song. So they once again continue their journey after Lois throws the apple at him. They made to natick, but there is no factory. Stewie yells that they done of their life only to trip and get covered in nuclear waste. Upon the sun lights up and shows the factory is still standing and in perfect condition. Expecting to be able to live off of the snackfood while stewie mutates his arms into tentacles, they establish the town of New Quahog around the factory. Peter proclaims himself mayor, and Joe and Clevemire join him to form a ruling council. One year later, New Quahog has become a fresh new community, complete with houses and wells. Peter has successfully reigned as mayor despite many mistakes, such as giving people jobs picked out of a hat rather than based on the person's skills. However, when Brian points out how New Quahog is a peaceful place with no violence, Peter says that they are completely defenseless finds metal to make guns.

In particular, the transcription of <b>cel</b> 7 C and <b>cel</b> 7 D was strongly induced by cellotriose or cellotetraose. The highest level of <b>cel</b> 7 C transcripts was observed in the presence of cellotetraose, whereas the highest level of <b>cel</b> 7 D transcripts was found in the presence of cellotriose, amounting to 2. 7 × 106 and 1. 7 × 106 copies per 105 actin gene transcripts, respectively. These numbers of <b>cel</b> 7 C and <b>cel</b> 7 D transcripts were higher than those in the presence of cellulose. In contrast, cellobiose had a weaker transcription-inducing effect than either cellotriose or cellotetraose for <b>cel</b> 7 C and had little effect in the case of <b>cel</b> 7 D.
