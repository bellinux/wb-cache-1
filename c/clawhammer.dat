25|$|American old-time music {{typically}} {{uses the}} five-string open back banjo. It is {{played in a}} number of different styles, the most common being <b>clawhammer</b> or frailing, characterized by the use of a downward rather than upward stroke when striking the strings with a fingernail. Frailing techniques use the thumb to catch the fifth string for a drone after most strums or after each stroke ("double thumbing"), or to pick out additional melody notes in what is known as drop-thumb. Pete Seeger popularised a folk style by combining <b>clawhammer</b> with up picking, usually without the use of fingerpicks. Another common style of old-time banjo playing is Fingerpicking banjo or classic banjo. This style is based upon parlor-style guitar.|$|E
500|$|Some of {{his songs}} feature a basic <b>clawhammer</b> style of {{right-hand}} playing but these are often distinguished by unusual chord voicings or by chords with added notes. An {{example of this is}} his song [...] "Needle of Death," [...] which features a simple picking style, though several of the chords are decorated with added ninths. Characteristically, the ninths are not the highest note of the chord, but appear {{in the middle of the}} arpeggiated finger-picking, creating a [...] "lumpiness" [...] to the sound.|$|E
500|$|The album also {{received}} favorable reviews. Robert Wilonsky of the Dallas Observer observed that Welch [...] "inhabits a role so completely, the fiction separating character and audience disappears". [...] Thom Owens (Allmusic) {{stated that the}} album [...] "lacks some of the focus" [...] of Revival, but is [...] "a thoroughly satisfying second album" [...] and proof that her debut was not a fluke. [...] No Depressions Farnum Brown commended the live and [...] "immediate feel" [...] of the album, [...] Welch's <b>clawhammer</b> banjo, and Rawlings' harmonies. Similar to Revival, Welch was praised for reflecting influences such as the Stanley Brothers, but still managing to create an original sound, while Chris Herrington from Minneapolis's City Pages criticized the songs' lack of authenticity. He wrote [...] "Welch doesn't write folk songs; she writes folk songs about writing folk songs." ...|$|E
50|$|The bridge {{consists}} of F#m, D♭, A7, D, D7, C#m, F#7, Bm7 and E7 chords. The outro {{was written by}} Clapton with A, F#7, Bm7, E7, A and A6 chords. For the recording, Clapton is also using the <b>clawhammering</b> picking technique with a nylon string guitar. AllMusic critic William Ruhlmann also notes the distinctive acoustic guitar sound on the track. The recording was produced by Clapton himself {{with the help of}} his long-time collaborator record producer Simon Climie.|$|R
5000|$|After the {{break-up}} of the Stomping <b>Clawhammers,</b> Dara Luskin (bass), Frank McMahon (banjo, mandolin), Alex Crichton (vocals, guitar) formed Los Stompers in 1997. Following {{a tour of}} Scandinavia, the band released its first album, Mezzy on Stage, in 1998. Recorded live in the now defunct Jazzmatazz, Barcelona and released through former Los Manolos group members label, Ventilador Music, the album was a compendium of traditional Irish pub songs such as [...] "Follow me up to Carlow", [...] "The Star of the County Down" [...] and [...] "Waxie's Dargle" [...] as well as original material. 1999 saw the release of their debut studio album, Pub Friction, joined by Colm Petit on fiddle, and solidified their proposal of a fusion between many styles and traditions from Catalan rumba to country music. This was achieved through the production skills of former Manolos drummer Andreu Hernandez, various collaborations with experienced session musicians such as Ricky Araiza and Cece Giannotti, and the inclusion of many instruments not normally found in Irish music such as the cajón, the darbouka, trumpet and tuba. The album was received well in the Spanish press, with reviews by EFE EME and La Vanguardia.|$|R

2500|$|Historically, {{the banjo}} was {{played in the}} <b>clawhammer</b> style by the Africans who brought their version of the banjo with them. Several other styles of play were {{developed}} from this. <b>Clawhammer</b> consists of downward striking {{of one or more}} of the four main strings with the index, middle or both finger(s)while the drone or fifth string is played with a 'lifting' (as opposed to downward pluck) motion of the thumb. The notes typically sounded by the thumb in this fashion are, usually, on the off beat. Melodies can be quite intricate adding techniques such as double thumbing and drop thumb. In old time Appalachian Mountain music, there is also a style called two finger up-pick, and a three finger version that Earl Scruggs developed into the famous [...] "Scruggs" [...] style picking, nationally aired in 1945 on the Grand Ole Opry.|$|E
2500|$|Today old-time banjo players most {{commonly}} utilize the <b>clawhammer</b> style, {{but there were}} originally several other styles, {{most of which are}} still in use, loosely grouped by region. The major styles were <b>clawhammer</b> (which also went by a number of regional names), two-finger index lead (also called [...] "North Carolina picking"), two-finger thumb lead (Kentucky and East Tennessee), and a three-finger [...] "fiddle style" [...] that seems to have been influenced in part by late-19th century urban classical style. A young player might learn whatever style a parent or older sibling favored, or take inspiration from phonograph records, radio, travelling performers and migrant workers, local guitarists and banjo players, as well as other musicians they met when travelling to neighbouring areas. This style of having a fiddle play the lead melody and a banjo play a rhythmic accompaniment is the most basic form of Appalachian old-time music, and is the instrumentation most Appalachian old-time musicians consider to be [...] "classic." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Scruggs was 21, Monroe {{was looking}} for a banjo player for his group because David Akeman, known as Stringbean, was quitting. At the time, banjo players often functioned in the band as comedians, and the {{instrument}} was often held as a prop — their <b>clawhammer</b> playing was almost inaudible. Monroe, along with band member Lester Flatt, auditioned several banjo players who had the same traditional playing style as Akeman. When Scruggs auditioned for them at the Tulane Hotel in Nashville, Flatt said," [...] I was thrilled. It was so different! I had never heard that kind of banjo picking". [...] Scruggs joined Monroe in late 1945, earning $50 a week. After they accepted Scruggs as one of the Blue Grass Boys, the roster consisted of Bill Monroe (vocals/mandolin), Lester Flatt (guitar/vocals), Earl Scruggs (banjo), Chubby Wise (fiddle), and Howard Watts (stage name Cedric Rainwater) on bass. This group of men became the prototype of what a bluegrass band would be.|$|E
2500|$|Appalachian {{music has}} also {{influenced}} {{a number of}} musicians from outside the region. [...] In 1957, British skiffle artist Lonnie Donegan {{reached the top of}} the U.K. charts with his version of the Appalachian folk song [...] "Cumberland Gap," [...] and the following year the Kingston Trio had a number one hit on the U.S. charts with their rendition of the North Carolina ballad, [...] "Tom Dooley". [...] Grateful Dead member Jerry Garcia frequently performed Appalachian songs such as [...] "Shady Grove" [...] and [...] "Wind and Rain", and claimed to have learned the <b>clawhammer</b> banjo style from [...] "listening to Clarence Ashley". [...] Bob Dylan, who also performed a number of Appalachian folk songs, considered Roscoe Holcomb to be [...] "one of the best," [...] and guitarist Eric Clapton considered Holcomb a [...] "favorite" [...] country musician. [...] Classical composers Lamar Stringfield and Kurt Weill have used Appalachian folk music in their compositions, and the region was the setting for Aaron Copland's Appalachian Spring. [...] In the early 21st century, the motion picture O Brother, Where Art Thou?, and to a lesser extent Songcatcher and Cold Mountain, generated renewed mainstream interest in traditional Appalachian music.|$|E
2500|$|Scruggs {{is noted}} for popularizing a three-finger banjo-picking style now called [...] "Scruggs style" [...] {{that has become}} a {{defining}} characteristic of bluegrass music. Prior to Scruggs, most banjo players used the [...] frailing or <b>clawhammer</b> technique, which consists of holding the fingers bent like a claw and moving the entire hand in a downward motion so that the strings are struck with the back of the middle fingernail. This motion is followed by striking the thumb on a single string. [...] The three-finger style of playing is radically different from frailing; the hand itself remains stationary and only the fingers and thumb move, somewhat similar to classical guitar technique. Scruggs style also involves using picks on three digits, each plucking three individual stings — downward with the thumb, then upward with the index and middle finger in sequence. When done skillfully and in rapid sequence, the style allows any digit (though usually the thumb) to play a melody, while the other two digits play arpeggios of the melody line. The use of picks gives each note a louder percussive attack, creating an exciting effect, described by The New York Times as [...] "like thumbtacks plinking rhythmically on a tin roof". This departure from traditional playing elevated the banjo to become more of a solo instrument—a promotion from its former role of providing background rhythm or serving as a comedian's prop—and popularized the instrument in several genres of music.|$|E

A sense of being entirely inconspicuous, a realization that I was committed to convention, produced in me an air of perfect ease. By conforming I had become {{as much a part of}} the scene as Sir Walter or the waiter who shifted my plates and filled my glass.

60|$|Left {{to himself}} the plainsman {{looked around the}} hall which seemed a splendid and spacious one to him. It was filled with ladies in {{beautiful}} costumes, and with men in <b>clawhammer</b> coats. He had seen pictures of evening suits in the newspapers but never before had he been privileged to behold live men in them. The men seemed pale and puny for the most part. He had never before seen ladies in low-necked dresses and one just before him seemed shamelessly naked, and he gazed at her in astonishment. He was glad Mary had more modesty.|$|E

No longer ago than we can remember we saw an aged party in spectacles and a <b>clawhammer</b> coat gyrating through the air like an irregular bolt shot out of a catapult. Before we could ascertain from him the site of the quadruped from whom he had received his impulsion, he had passed like a vague dream, and the equine scoundrel went unwhipped of justice.|$|E

The Camel not only stood stock still but moved a little backward toward England. Old Ben the boatswain said that he'd never knowed but one deader calm, and that, he explained, was when Preacher Jack, the reformed sailor, had got excited in a sermon in a seaman's chapel and shouted that the Archangel Michael would chuck the Dragon into the brig and give him a taste of the rope's-end, damn his eyes! ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Clawhammer</b> and frailing are {{primarily}} banjo techniques that are sometimes {{applied to the}} guitar. [...] Jody Stecher and Alec Stone Sweet are exponents of guitar <b>clawhammer.</b> Fingerstyle guitarist Steve Baughman distinguishes between frailing and <b>clawhammer</b> as follows. In frailing, the index fingertip is used for up-picking melody, and the middle fingernail is used for rhythmic downward brushing. In <b>clawhammer,</b> only downstrokes are used, and they are typically played with one fingernail as is the usual technique on the banjo.|$|E

5000|$|Alec Stone Sweet {{describes}} the <b>clawhammer</b> technique in the liner notes to [...] "Tumblin' Gap: <b>Clawhammer</b> Guitar Solos": [...] "There are five {{characteristics of the}} way I play <b>clawhammer.</b> First, every specific note played by the right hand is produced either by the index finger or the thumb. Second, no note is ever plucked; each is played either with the thumb, or by striking down on a string with the nail of the index finger. Third, the index finger never plays off the beat, and the thumb never plays on the beat. This feature of <b>clawhammer</b> technique gives the music a heavier - and, to my ear, more natural - drive {{than it would have}} if it were played, say, as melody over an alternating bass. There is one exception to this rule: variations on a common <b>clawhammer</b> banjo lick (that you can hear on the climatic high notes of the second part of Polly Put the Kettle On, and the third part of Joke on the Puppy) when the thumb plays on beat. Fourth, for any piece, most of the notes are produced by the left hand, in combinations of slides, hammers, and pull-offs; slurs can occur on or off the beat. Fifth, I play in multiple tunings, and sometimes replace the sixth string bass with a high sixth string treble (of the same gauge employed for the first string). The banjo player will realize that I use my thumb on the bass strings to obtain drones, much as a <b>clawhammer</b> player uses the banjo’s high fifth string; indeed, when I string the guitar with a high treble in place of the sixth-string bass, it is partly to imitate the fifth string of the banjo. In many of the tunes, I keep multiple drones going, on different strings. To sum up, in my version of <b>clawhammer</b> guitar, the thumb plays off the beat, even when it plays harmony bass notes or bass lines; no strings are ever plucked; with respect to the right hand, only the index finger and the thumb sound notes, but never at the same time. What is incredible is how much full textured sound one finger, one thumb, and left hand slurs can generate." ...|$|E
