40|$|Pruning and reaping {{different}} quantities (P 1 - 5) of air biomass of the haloxylon {{trees were}} studied {{in two different}} haloxylon planted areas {{from the viewpoint of}} vigority. It was done within the format of the design of fully random blocks with five treatments (pruning from the 10 cm over the <b>collar,</b> <b>pruning</b> 150 cm of the top branches, pruning 100 cm of the top branches, pruning 50 cm of the top branches and control) and four repetitions as possible ways to remove wilting state, dying status and revive the vigor condition of hand-planted shrubs. The index of VI = H (CD) a - 1 was accepted out of many quantitative indexes as the symbol of vigority (quality) which could show the vigorous quality {{in the form of a}} quantitative quantity after testing in hand-planted shrubs of Kerman Province. The average of this index in each of the three germinating conditions (vigorous, wilting and dying) was 1370, 780 and 280, respectively. The statistical studies showed that there was a significant difference among its quantities in different degrees of vigority. In other words, the quantities of this index, in addition to the size of growth showed its quality (the vigority degree) as well. The analysis of the data in LSD method during a 5 -year research showed that the impact of P 1 and P 2 on the growth of trees and also VI in both regions were significant. The results showed that the intensive prunings are able to increase the growth of wilting haloxylon and rejuvenate their vigority and freshness...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1998 The Douglas-fir {{pitch moth}} (DFPM), Synanthedon novaroensis, is {{attracted}} to exudations of oleoresin and oviposits at wounds on the bole of host trees. Larvae then feed in subcortical regions of vigourously growing hosts. With the increase use of pruning in young stands of Douglas-fir, Pseudotsuga menzesii (Mirb.) Franco, the potential exists for the DFPM, attracted to pruning wounds, to create defects {{that would reduce}} the value of wood products and erode potential returns on this investment. Therefore, {{the objective of this}} study was to investigate the relationship between host selection behavior of the DFPM related to intermediate silvicultural activities such as pruning. Specific objectives of this study were to determine if DFPM demonstrates an ovipositional preference between: individual pruned Douglas-fir trees; clones of Douglas-fir; branch pruning wounds and wounds on the bole of Douglas-fir; pruning wounds made through the branch collar and wounds made outside the branch collar; and wounds made during different seasons of the year. A series of field experiments were conducted in young Douglas-fir stands in Western Washington from 1991 - 1997. The principal conclusions from these experiments were: DFPM host preference varies significantly between individual Douglas-fir trees; DFPM host preference varies significantly between clones of Douglas-fir; DFPM oviposits at wounds on the bole of a host more often than at wounds made outside the branch collar; DFPM oviposits significantly more often at pruning wounds made through the branch <b>collar</b> than at <b>pruning</b> wounds made outside the branch collar; and DFPM oviposits significantly more often at pruning wounds made in the spring than at pruning wounds made in summer, autumn, or winter...|$|R
