40|$|Prague, {{with its}} monuments of great {{historical}} and artistic value, {{has been gaining}} popularity in recent years. It {{has become one of}} the most important tourist destinations in Central Europe. This is the reason why hotel industry in this city is developing so quickly – there are 654 <b>collective</b> tourist <b>accommodation</b> establishments with 547 hotels, motels, pensions and residences, which is more than 83 %. Establishments, located in the old, historical buildings, are among the most interesting hotel groups in the city. For the purpose of this project, hotels located in buildings erected before the beginning of World War II, operating during the research that took place from the beginning of July to the end September 2008 and which have 10 or more rooms (according to Czech definition of the hotel) were taken into consideration. Historical hotels in Prague are mostly <b>collective</b> tourist <b>accommodation</b> establishments in the historical city center, in Prague 1 district, where 135 establishments of this type operate (September 2008), which is almost 80 % in this administrative district and a quarter in the whole city. This shows a great potential of this kind of facilities, covering a great range of hotel market in Prague. The main advantage of these establishments is their location directly in the city centre which is also the main tourism, business and political core. The vicinity of the main tourist attractions, as well as public institutions, shopping venues and business centers, is the main reason why the historical hotels are so popular among the people visiting Prague. It is important to mention, that such a great location is strictly connected with the higher price in comparison to hotels situated further away from the center. The majority of historical hotels are rather small in size. 88 of them (65 % of the total) offer less than 50 rooms, and on the other hand, only 14 (about 10 %) have more than 100 rooms. Historical hotels in Prague 1 district are mostly upper class hotels, ranging from 3 stars above. Almost half of all hotels in this district (about 49 %) are 4 -star hotels and 27 of them are luxurious 5 -star hotels with an outstandingly exclusive service. Most of the mentioned hotels are privately owned by individuals, families or different companies. In addition to this, many of them are associated within different organizational structures, such as hotels chains, systems or groups, often of international or even global range. The main and the most interesting attribute of these hotels is their location in interesting, unique buildings, often of great historical and artistic value. They are mostly located in tenement houses, but also in such places as former stables, hospitals, convents or banks. It significantly influences their attractiveness and creates unique atmosphere of the hotel, which is perfect for guests looking for new sensations. This is the main feature giving the hotel its own “spirit of the place” which is important in creating its outstanding brand and often a long lasting tradition. Despite the favorable location and the atmosphere, historical hotels also have problems of their own. Among the most important ones is the constant protection of the building by the building conservation officer, as the centre of Prague is on UNESCO World Heritage List, which often makes it difficult to renovate the hotel or add new facilities, for example to adopt the building for people with reduced mobility. This is the reason, why small, historical hotels often cannot compete with big, modern and well equipped hotels, located just a few steps away from the city centre. To conclude, it is easy to assume that historical hotels of “Golden Prague” are creating a unique web of original establishments, offering a wide range of various services – from economical to luxury class – to their guests. All of them have a great potential for future development, but some problems may also occur and are more likely to happen to them than in the case of “traditional” hotels...|$|R
40|$|In 1980, El Salvador {{fragmented}} revolutionary movement {{united to}} form the Frente Farabundo Martí para la Liberación Nacional (FMLN). This Front subsequently fought a war against the U. S. backed Salvadoran military which culminated in military stalemate. After the 1992 Peace Accords, the guerrilla army demobilized and the FMLN became a political party. Though the right-wing government party won the elections in subsequent years, the FMLN soon consolidated itself as the main opposition party. From 1997 on, it won several important municipalities. In 2009, the FMLN won the presidential elections and constituted the first left-wing government in the country’s history. This study presents a retrospective analysis of the postwar legacy of El Salvador’s insurgent movement. It demonstrates {{how and why the}} insurgent relations forged during the war continued to be highly relevant throughout the postwar period, and how these internal relations shaped the development of the former insurgents as a political electoral force. At war’s end, the former insurgents sought different ways of <b>collective</b> and individual <b>accommodation</b> to the emerging circumstances. Different insurgents leaders and subgroups held different cards that facilitated–or hindered–social, political and economic ascendency in the postwar context. Drawing on Bourdieu and others, this study looks at post-insurgency as a social field: a historically constructed space of relationships between multiple social agents that were previously connected through participation in insurgency. This perspective emphasizes the importance of the movement’s internal relations and of its modifications over time. The study of internal relations of a movement that operated clandestinely for large part of its existence is a delicate and complicated task. Hence, the study offers three detailed longitudinal case studies providing a window into parts of the movement, drawing on the disciplines of social history and political ethnography. The case studies treat postwar affairs in a peasant community founded by the insurgent movement, a review of the life trajectories of guerrilla fighters identified from historical photographs, and an inside account of the movement of FMLN veterans and their political activities, respectively. These case studies show how post-insurgent accommodations led to more pronounced internal inequalities, growing postwar disillusionment and the rise of patronage and clientelism in different segments of the movement. The contentious accommodation of internal relations {{played a key role in}} the postwar development of El Salvador’s former insurgent movement. This finding holds broader relevance for research on post-insurgent transitions. It posits the need to look beyond the strictly military and political aspects of insurgency and pay attention to the insurgents’ social history, including clandestine connections, in research on post-insurgent transitions. It challenges social scientists to consider the myriad ways in which insurgent networks may reconvert to adapt to the emerging circumstances of peace, and how such reconversions may impact on post-war societies. The interpersonal relations shaped in the insurgent movement might well constitute one of the most enduring legacies of insurgency in its aftermath. In the case of El Salvador, it has been a crucial part of what former insurgents worked with to gain postwar ascendency...|$|R

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Institute of Science and Technology, 2015 Geleneksel olandan kopuşu ifade eden modernite kavramı yeni olanı nitelemekte ve güçlü bir değişim düşüncesini içinde barındırmaktadır. Batı kökenli bir kavram olan modernite zamanla tüm alanlarda uygulama alanı bulmuş, günlük yaşamı değiştirmiş ve hızla yayılmıştır. Modernleşme sürecinde, yeni malzeme ve teknoloji ile yapılar inşa edilmiş, yapı sürecinde standartlaşma, endüstrileşme gibi tartışmalar başlamış ve yeni bina tipolojileri oluşmaya başlamıştır. Modernizm, en etkili söylemini ise manifestolar aracılığıyla konutta gerçekleştirmiştir. Sıradan ve modern bireyler için yeni yaşam koşullarına uygun, yeni malzeme ve tekniklerle seri üretime olanak sağlayan konforlu, yalın, sağlıklı ve ideal konutun özellikleri belirlenmeye çalışılmıştır.   Evrensel özelliğe sahip modernleşme süreci, uygulandığı yerin dinamiklerine ve yere özgü durumlara göre farklı uygulamaların ortaya çıkmasına neden olmuştur. Türkiye’de çağdaşlaşmanın bir gereği olarak görülen modernleşme sürecinde kentlerin görünümü değişmiş, geleneksel konutun yerini modern apartmanlar almıştır. Modernleşme süreci, büyük kentlerde yaşanan dönüşümün etkisiyle 20. yüzyılın ikinci yarısında Anadolu kentlerinde etkisini göstermiştir. Bu araştırmada Denizli kentinin modernleşme sürecini okuyabilmek için modern mimari uygulamaları nedeniyle kentlerde hızla uygulanmaya başlanan apartman örnekleri incelenmiştir. Denizli’de 1960 ile 1980 yılları arasında inşa edilen ve modernleşmenin simgesi olarak görülen apartmanların tasarım, uygulama ve kullanım aşamaları araştırılmış, modern mimarlığın kentteki uygulama koşulları ve modern apartmanların yaşadığı değişimler ve bu değişimlerin nedenleri saptanmaya çalışılmıştır.   Araştırma sürecinde örnekler, alanda yapılan gözlem ve tespitler ile Denizli Belediyesi İmar Müdürlüğü Arşivi’nde yapılan çalışmalar sonucu belirlenmiştir. Örneklerin analiz edilmesi ve değerlendirilmesi aşamasında kullanılan diğer yöntemler literatür çalışması, bulunan projelerin dijital ortama aktarılması ve mimarlarla yapılan kişisel görüşmelerdir. Bu kapsamda, çalışmada öncelikle modernite kavramının oluşumu ve gelişimi incelenmiş, sonrasında modern mimarlık ve konut uygulamalarının Avrupa ve Türkiye’de nasıl gerçekleştirildiği araştırılmıştır. Sonraki bölümde modernleşme  süreci kırılma noktası olarak kabul edilerek Denizli kentinin mekânsal gelişimi incelenmiş, Denizli’de inşa edilen geleneksel konut ve modern konutların genel özellikleri ele alınmıştır. Alan çalışmasının yer aldığı bölümde, belirlenen apartmanlar arşiv bilgilerine göre sınıflandırılmış ve tasarım, uygulama ve kullanım süreçleri detaylı olarak analiz edilmiştir. Elde edilen verilerin değerlendirildiği sonraki bölümde aktörler, mimari özellikler ve değişimler alt başlıkları ile modern bir konut sunum biçimi olan apartmanların Denizli’de nasıl uygulandığı belirlenmeye çalışılmıştır. Son olarak belge değerine sahip nitelikli ilk modern apartman örneklerinin kent belleği için önemi belirtilmiş ve geleceğe yönelik öneriler geliştirilmiştir. The {{concept of}} modernity {{represents}} a separation from tradition, defines {{a new approach}} and includes an idea of a powerful change. Modernity, as a western originated concept, found an area of application in every field during the period, changed daily life and spread rapidly. During the modernization era, buildings were constructed with new materials and technology, discussions, such as standardization and industrialization, started and new building typologies emerged. Modernism found its most powerful expression {{in the field of}} housings. The aim was to define “Ideal Housing” for ordinary and modern individuals, suited for the new living conditions, enabling mass production with new materials and techniques and providing comfortable, simple and healthy living environment. Modernism, which had universal characteristics, paved way for different implementations in accordance with dynamics and specialties of place and time. The appearance of the cities changed and the traditional housing was replaced with modern apartment buildings during the modernization period in Turkey. This change is regarded as a necessity of modernization. The modernization process began to influence Anatolian cities {{during the second half of}} the 20 th century as a continuation of the transition, occurring in large cities, such as Istanbul and Ankara.   In Denizli, during the 1950 s; the traditional garden houses, with few stories, were replaced with apartment buildings as a result of modernization, industrialization, increasing population and rapid urbanization. Apartment buildings, which required a <b>collective</b> type of <b>accommodation</b> and reflected a new life-style, have been built with new materials and techniques due to the increasing demand for housing and rapidly found an area of construction within the city.   The aim of this study is to examine the modernization process taking place in the city of Denizli, to study the apartment buildings built in Denizli between 1960 and 1980, and to define the speed and direction of the local modernization and how this modernization took place. In this context, the design, implementation and stages of usage of the first apartment buildings, which are being considered as the symbols of modernization in the city, were examined and the implementation conditions of the modern architecture within the city, the changes these apartment buildings underwent as well as the reasons of these changes were determined. The configuration characteristics, spatial relationships and design criteria of the apartment buildings, subject to this study, and the local implementation of modern housing, the changes endured by these apartment buildings regarding the differing needs during usage and the actors affecting these processes were researched. The examples of the research process were determined by field observations and evaluations as well as archive researches. The other methods used during the analysis and evaluation of the examples were literature review, transfer of the found projects to digital media and personal meetings with architects.   The districts in which the initial apartment buildings of the modern period appear were defined in accordance to the literature review as well as the characteristics of these apartment buildings. As a result of the research on the historical urban development of Denizli, the locations of the first apartment buildings built in this city were found to be the districts of Sırakapılar, Saraylar, Atalar, 15 Mayıs, Topraklık and Altıntop. In those areas, many apartment buildings which could be used for research data were found as a result of the analysis and photographing. The block and parcel numbers of the examples specified during the field study were obtained from the municipality and research was conducted at the development directorate of the municipality of Denizli in order to obtain the original projects of these buildings. The 90 apartment building projects, which could be identified on the field and have properties which might contribute to the research, were chosen for detailed evaluation. The map sections of the examples which were obtained and used for the study were kept as blueprints, and they have been transferred to the digital medium in order to create a more comprehensible source document. In this context, both original and renovated floor plans, façades, building surveys, floor additions and etc. of the buildings were re-drawn using computer programs. Therefore, the project drawings added in the appendix with 1 / 200 scale, have value as a document since they include the scaled plans and the appearances of the structures. The other source of data used during this research was in-person interviews. In order to determine the design criteria, to obtain detailed information regarding the design and production process and to understand the changes performed during the construction process together with their reasons, interviews were conducted with the architects of the projects identified from the data included in the archives. In the light of the obtained information, the first chapter explains the purpose, extent and methodology of the study. The second chapter contains the concepts which form the base of the study. This part discusses the concepts of modernity, modernism, modernization as well as a short examination of the historical progression and the changes of these concepts and proceeds with the investigation of modern architecture and housing processes. Examples of modern housing in Europe, where modernism emerged in the first place; as well as manifestations contributing to modern architecture, and the reasons for the emergence of modern housing are investigated. The Modern Architecture and Housing Process in Turkey, the First National Architecture period, the Modern Architecture period, the Second National Architecture period and the international Modern Architecture period are presented in four subheadings.   In the third chapter, the spatial development of the city of Denizli are described. In this chapter, the changes and transformations of the city, beginning from the first settlement period included in the pre-modernization era; as well as the properties of the produced traditional housings, are defined in a historical perspective. The changes in the city caused by the new economic, social and political effects emerging in the modernization era; the reasons for the production of modern housing, and the first modern housing examples built in the city, were examined. In the fourth chapter, the examples determined during the field study and archive research are analyzed in detail. The determination of the general properties of the structures, the schematics and design of the facades was followed by the analysis of the endured changes during the construction and use, in order to provide insight regarding the local implementation of modern housing. The examples were categorized as follows: apartment buildings with original schematics in the archive, apartment buildings where only the renovated schematics could be obtained, and apartment buildings that were demolished. Modern architecture has had the opportunity to be applied globally with its universal nature. Still, because of the unique characteristics of each location, differences can be observed in the implementations. In the fifth chapter where the obtained data of the examples are interpreted and evaluated, a classification is made in order to provide insight on how modern housing was applied in Denizli. Therefore, the factors which influenced the production of the example apartment buildings are defined, the architectural properties of the apartment buildings are evaluated and the changes which were performed during construction and use are identified in this chapter.   The final chapter of the thesis includes a general evaluation of the conducted research together with the presentation of the results as well as proposals which were developed for the future.
