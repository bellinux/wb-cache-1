60|$|Steerforth laughed to that degree, {{that it was}} {{impossible}} for me to help laughing too; though I am not sure I should have done so, but for this inducement. When we had had our laugh quite out, which was after some time, he told me that Miss Mowcher had quite an extensive connexion, and made herself useful to a variety of people in a variety of ways. Some people trifled with her as a mere oddity, he said; but she was as shrewdly and sharply observant as anyone he knew, and as long-headed as she was short-armed. He told me that what she had said of being here, and there, and everywhere, was true enough; for she made little darts into the provinces, and seemed to pick up customers everywhere, and to know everybody. I asked him what her disposition was: whether it was at all mischievous, and if her sympathies were generally {{on the right side of}} things: but, not succeeding in attracting his attention to these questions after two or three attempts, I forbore or forgot to repeat them. He told me instead, with much rapidity, a good deal about her skill, and her profits; and about her being a scientific <b>cupper,</b> if I should ever have occasion for her service in that capacity.|$|E

40|$|Sensory {{profiles}} of thirteen coffee {{samples from the}} Huila Region, Colombia, were evaluated using two different sensory panels, a highly trained descriptive sensory panel {{and a group of}} certified coffee <b>cuppers.</b> The trained panel consisted of six descriptive panelists who developed a lexicon to evaluate and then test the coffee samples. Four ‘cuppers’ scored samples based on the Speciality Coffee Association of America “Cupping Protocol”. In addition <b>cuppers</b> generated tasting notes to characterize the different coffee samples. Data analysis indicated little overlap between the two methods and a low relationship between the two different sets of terms. Moreover, tasting notes by <b>cuppers</b> indicate lack of agreements on the terms used to describe samples with only four terms used by more than two assessors to describe a single coffee product, {{out of a total of}} 59 terms used by the <b>cuppers.</b> The results indicate that the cupping method provides different information that cannot be used as an alternative to descriptive sensory analysis with trained panelists when describing the sensory profile of coffee products. Results also indicate that further training of <b>cuppers</b> is needed in order to potentially provide higher agreement in generating tasting notes to better characterize coffee samples...|$|R
