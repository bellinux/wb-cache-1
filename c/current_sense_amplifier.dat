In this thesis, a low power consumption and high speed <b>current</b> <b>sense</b> <b>amplifier</b> has been proposed to achieve the read/write operation for a SRAM. A very few voltage difference existing between the bit pair will induce the effective sense activity in our proposed sense amplifier. In addition, an isolated mechanism has been applied in our research to reduce the power consumption effectively. Meanwhile, there are several experiments have been implemented while considering different bit line loading, output loading and supply voltage. The experimental results show that a better performance has been obtained as comparing with other methods.

40|$|Global on-chip {{interconnects}} in 70 nm {{and beyond}} present challenges in satisfying delay constraints while minimizing energy consumption, especially energy due to leakage [1]. Although many global interconnects may have low activity factors (e. g. cache fill bus) thus reducing dynamic power, leakage {{is still a}} great concern. Leakage is an increasing concern in traditional repeated interconnects due to the large device sizes required to meet tight delay constraints [2] and the inherently distributed nature of the repeaters which complicates power gating.

40|$|The {{traditional}} {{method of}} implementing SRAM in CMOS is via a six-transistor cell and five routing lines. If {{the number of}} transistors {{and the number of}} wires could be reduced, the packing density of the memory cells could be increased, and the area reduced. This document describes the design of an SRAM system based on a new four¬transistor SRAM cell. The primary design goal was to create a functional system, so that the relationship between reduced cell area and a potentially reduced system area could be investigated. A new write method and associated array structure has been used, and the design of the system parameters was accomplished using static noise margin theory. The power dissipation and percentage reduction in cell area have been improved over previous designs. The circuits to achieve the access to the cell have been designed and simulated. These include low-impedance driver circuits, that allow the power supply of the cell's devices to be individually modified to read and write the cell, and a <b>current</b> <b>sense</b> <b>amplifier</b> system to convert the output current to a digital voltage. These circuits allow complete and accurate control to be achieved, but a price is paid for the complexity in terms of layout area. The SRAM system emulates a standard SRAM, and could therefore be used to replace current SRAM implementations. The design was simulated on a system level, and found to operate correctly. Although it is outperformed by its six-transistor cell counterpart in terms of power dissipation, speed and layout area, the groundwork for defining further research and improving the characteristics of further designs has been laid.

40|$|As feature sizes {{progress}} into nanometer realms, on-chip interconnects play {{an increasing}} {{role in the}} overall performance and power consumption of high-performance integrated circuits. Three novel on-chip interconnect communication techniques are presented; (i) differential current-transfer sensing, (ii) multi-level current signaling, (iii) swing-limited interconnect communication; silicon implementation and an integration methodology in conventional CAD flow are proposed. The differential current-transfer sense amplifier (DCTSA), is a new static-power mitigated receiver for conventional differential current-sensing. It is compared with the conventional differential <b>current</b> <b>sense</b> <b>amplifier</b> (DCSA) and standard repeaters. Results in 130 nm, 65 nm and 45 nm show that DCTSA outperforms repeaters for wires with activity of 50 % and higher and length longer than 4 mm. The multi-level current signaling technique with novel driver and receiver circuits is proposed which encode two bits on one interconnect using current levels. This multi-level system is compared with conventional repeaters for process technologies including 130 nm, 90 nm, 65 nm and 45 nm. The impact of process induced parameter variations was analyzed and a process tolerant driver was presented. Compared to repeaters, multi-level current signaling is attractive for wires longer than 4 mm and with activity factors more than 40 %. A swing-limited interconnect current-mode technique is proposed with a novel low-swing receiver circuit, which achieves energy efficient transmission for on-chip interconnects over repeaters. This swing-limited interconnect system is compared with repeaters in a 65 nm industrial CMOS technology. With this signaling technique there is a 56 % energy reduction and 21 % delay reduction compared to repeaters. Delay savings increase by 8 % at supply of 1. 4 v at iso energy. A total area savings of 86 % is obtained in device width with this technique. A methodology and tool for the integration of current-mode interconnect techniques into conventional design flow was presented. The methodology and tool called Network-on-Chip Interconnect Calculator provides results in terms of delay and power for interconnects, and illustrates the effects of delay and power on input parameters in plots. It hides the circuit level details of the proposed current-mode techniques and provides a simple library {{that can be used}} by conventional CAD flow. The proposed signaling techniques along with conventional repeater insertion method have been implemented in silicon in IBM 130 nm technology through MOSIS for different wirelengths showing proof-of-concept. The test chip is fully functional and the measurement results closely followed the simulated results, thus verifying the validity of the proposed techniques and their benefit over existing techniques for on-chip interconnects. ...|$|E

There are several methods to increase the dynamic range of the sensor through the readout algorithm. The multiple sampling method can increase the dynamic range (DR) without a loss of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The idea is to acquire several images during one frame. Based on the multiple sampling method, the method described in this thesis uses the special feature of the pinned photodiode to select the charge transfer time locally to change the total integration time in one frame based on the input light intensity. The comparator is reused during the different conversion phases to save power and area.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} presents circuit {{techniques for}} designing high performance amplifiers. In low power design, {{the range of}} common mode input signal shrinks due to reduced power supply voltage. In addition, due to reduced bias current, noise density rises. The reduced input signal range and raised noise floor severely degrade system dynamic range. A novel rail to rail input circuit is presented. The proposed circuit has advantages over conventional circuits in term of noise and power consumption. Moreover, due to reduced bias current, low power amplifiers typically have lower bandwidth and slew rate, which limits their dynamic performance. The bandwidth is further reduced at high gain settings because of the constant gain bandwidth product. A novel self-adaptive compensation technique to extend small signal bandwidth and improve slew behavior is presented. If an amplifier needs to drive various capacitive and/or resistive loads, parallel Miller compensation is the most power efficient frequency compensation scheme. However, the frequency response of parallel Miller compensation is complicated and no thorough analysis on frequency response has been given in literatures. To illustrate the connection between poles/zeros and each individual circuit component, we use a design oriented approach to derive transfer functions for various load conditions. With these transfer functions, circuit designers can optimize their design accordingly. As a case study, a low power precision instrumentation amplifier is designed. Compared to low power instrumentation amplifiers on the market or reported in literature, it can save at least 40 % power, meanwhile offer higher bandwidth and faster slew rate at typical gain settings. Many challenges also exist in designing high voltage amplifiers.

40|$|Abstract – The {{reliable}} operation of SRAM in presence of process variation in sub- 100 nm devices is largely influenced by periphery circuits, like <b>sense</b> <b>amplifiers,</b> demanding more robust solutions. A new differential <b>sense</b> <b>amplifier</b> {{for use in}} standard 6 -T SRAM based on gated-diode is proposed and designed. For comparison, three other latch-based <b>sense</b> <b>amplifiers</b> are also designed in 45 nm technology. The brief description of each <b>sense</b> <b>amplifier</b> is presented with HSPICE simulation results. With <b>sense</b> <b>amplifier</b> model and reasonable assumption, the deep analysis of effects from process variation proves that gated-diode <b>sense</b> <b>amplifier</b> is the most robust.

40|$|Abstract—A {{conventional}} latch-type <b>sense</b> <b>amplifier</b> in {{a static}} {{random access memory}} (SRAM) could trigger sensing failure under severe process variation. On the other hand, a traditional current-mirror <b>sense</b> <b>amplifier</b> could consume too much power. To strike a good balance, this paper presents an automatic-power-down (APD) <b>sense</b> <b>amplifier,</b> which can avoid sensing failure while keeping the power dissipation low. In this scheme, the operation window of the <b>sense</b> <b>amplifier</b> is adaptive to the real silicon speed of its associated column through Schmitt–Trigger-based dual- HL APD circuitry. A 64 -kb SRAM design using the proposed technique in a 22 -nm predictive technology model demonstrates that a power savings of 28 %– 87 % over the traditional current-mirror <b>sense</b> <b>amplifier</b> is achievable.

40|$|As we move {{under the}} aegis of the Moore 2 ̆ 7 s law, we have to deal with its darker side with {{problems}} like leakage and short channel effects. Once we go beyond 45 nm regime process variations also have emerged as a significant design concern. Embedded memories uses <b>sense</b> <b>amplifier</b> for fast <b>sensing</b> and typically, <b>sense</b> <b>amplifiers</b> uses pair of matched transistors in a positive feedback environment. A small difference in voltage level of applied input signals to these matched transistors is amplified and the resulting logic signals are latched. Intra die variation causes mismatch between the sense transistors that should ideally be identical structures. Yield loss due to device and process variations has never been so critical to cause failure in circuits. Due to growth in size of embedded SRAMs as well as usage of <b>sense</b> <b>amplifier</b> based signaling techniques, process variations in <b>sense</b> <b>amplifiers</b> leads to significant loss of yield for that we need to come up with process variation tolerant circuit styles and new devices. In this work impact of transistor mismatch due to process variations on <b>sense</b> <b>amplifier</b> is evaluated and this problem is stated. For the solution of the problem a novel self compensation scheme on <b>sense</b> <b>amplifiers</b> is presented on different technology nodes up to 32 nm on conventional bulk MOSFET technology. Our results show that the self compensation technique in the conventional bulk MOSFET latch type <b>sense</b> <b>amplifier</b> not just gives improvement in the yield but also leads to improvement in performance for latch type <b>sense</b> <b>amplifiers.</b> Lithography related CD variations, fluctuations in dopant density, oxide thickness and parametric variations of devices are identified as a major challenge to the classical bulk type MOSFET. With the emerging nanoscale devices, SIA roadmap identifies FinFETs as a candidate for post-planar end-of-roadmap CMOS device. With current technology scaling issues and with conventional bulk type MOSFET on 32 nm node our technique can easily be applied to Double Gate devices. In this work, we also develop the model of Double Gate MOSFET through 3 D Device Simulator Damocles and TCAD simulator. We propose a FinFET based process variation tolerant <b>sense</b> <b>amplifier</b> design that exploits the back gate of FinFET devices for dynamic compensation against process variations. Results from statistical simulation show that the proposed dynamic compensation is highly effective in restoring yield at a level comparable to that of <b>sense</b> <b>amplifiers</b> without process variations. We created the 32 nm double gate models generated from Damocles 3 -D device simulations [25] and Taurus Device Simulator available commercially from Synopsys [47] and use them in the nominal latch type <b>sense</b> <b>amplifier</b> design and on the Independent Gate Self Compensation <b>Sense</b> <b>Amplifier</b> Design (IGSSA) to compare the yield and performance benefits of <b>sense</b> <b>amplifier</b> design on FinFET technology over the conventional bulk type CMOS based <b>sense</b> <b>amplifier</b> on 32 nm technology node effective in restoring yield at a level comparable to that of <b>sense</b> <b>amplifiers</b> without process variations.
