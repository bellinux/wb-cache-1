50|$|The {{products}} {{developed and}} available today in cased hole work are the expandable liner hanger and the cased hole clad. The expandable liner hanger is basically an evolution of existing equipment currently {{used in the}} oil industry, a product with better thru bore and envisaged higher reliability. The Case hole clad provide a <b>casing</b> <b>patch</b> across a damaged section of casing, or to close off previously perforated casing. This product has two main advantages - minimal through bore loss two times the wall thickness of tubular being expanded and high pressure integrity performance.|$|E

40|$|Brookhaven National Laboratory was {{requested}} {{to conduct a}} literature survey for the best available cement {{to use in the}} proposed <b>casing</b> <b>patch</b> as part of the Geothermal Drilling Organization (GDO) project on remediation of deformed casings. A total of 50 wells has been identified with deformed production casing in Unocal's portion of The Geysers geothermal field. Reduced internal diameter and casing doglegs result in lost production and the possible need for abandonment. The cause of the deformations is believed to be formation movement along fault planes and/or along weaker layers or interfaces between high impedance contrast media. Apparently, it is unclear whether shear or axial compression is the dominant failure mechanism. A procedure to address the casing deformation and avoid abandonment of these wells has been developed as described in the Geysers Deformed Casing Remediation Proposal. The proposed remediation procedure involves isolation of the zone of interest with an inflatable packer, milling the deformed casing and cementing a 7 inch diameter liner to extend approximately 100 ft above and 100 ft below the milled zone. During the milling operation {{it is possible that the}} original cement and surrounding formation may slough away. In order to specify a suitable cement formulation for the <b>casing</b> <b>patch</b> it is first necessary to identify and understand the deformation mechanism/s operating in The Geysers field. Subsequently, the required cement mechanical properties to withstand further deformation of the repaired system must be defined. From this information it can be determined whether available cement formulations meet these requirements. In addition to The Geysers, other geothermal fields are at possible risk of casing deformation due to subsidence, seismic activity, lateral and vertical formation movement or other processes. Therefore, the proposed remediation procedure may have applications in other fields. The literature survey focused on published properties for cements used in geothermal and oil well applications and the experiences of well casing deformation occurring in oil and gas fields.
