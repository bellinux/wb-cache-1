2500|$|The {{postage stamps}} and postal {{system of the}} Confederate States of America carried the mail of the Confederacy {{for a brief period}} in American history. Early in 1861 when South Carolina no longer {{considered}} itself part of the Union and demanded that the U.S. Army abandon Fort Sumter, plans for a Confederate postal system were already underway. Indeed, the Confederate Post office was established on February 21, 1861; and it was not until April 12 that the American Civil War officially began, when the Confederate Army fired upon US soldiers who had refused to abandon the fort. However, the United States Post Office Department continued to handle the mail of the seceded states as usual during the first weeks of the war. [...] It was not until June 1 that the Confederate Post office took over <b>collection</b> <b>and</b> <b>delivery,</b> now faced with the task of providing postage stamps and mail services for its citizens.|$|E
2500|$|President Jefferson Davis had {{appointed}} John Henninger Reagan on March 6, 1861, to {{head the}} new Confederate States of America Post-office Department.

The most immediate concerns of the Confederate postmaster general was the organization of his department and providing for the payment of postage so that it would become self-financing. While the recalled U.S. postage could no longer be used to carry the mail by the U.S. Post Office, the Confederacy did use [...] "appropriated" [...] United States postal stationery for some time. General Reagan claimed he never conferred official authority on postmasters to issue interim, [...] "provisional" [...] stamps, but they filled a need in the absence of national Confederate stamps (which were not issued until October, 1861) and stamped envelopes.|$|E
60|$|Railway {{travelling}} {{is at best}} a compromise. The quite conceivable {{ideal of}} locomotive convenience, so far as travellers are concerned, is surely a highly mobile conveyance capable of travelling easily and swiftly to any desired point, traversing, at a reasonably controlled pace, the ordinary roads and streets, and having access for higher rates of speed and long-distance travelling to specialized ways restricted to swift traffic, and possibly furnished with guide-rails. For the <b>collection</b> <b>and</b> <b>delivery</b> {{of all sorts of}} perishable goods also the same system is obviously altogether superior to the existing methods. Moreover, such a system would admit of that secular progress in engines and vehicles that the stereotyped conditions of the railway have almost completely arrested, because it would allow almost any new pattern to be put at once upon the ways without interference with the established traffic. Had such an ideal been kept in view from the first the traveller would now be able to get through his long-distance journeys at a pace of from seventy miles or more an hour without changing, and without any of the trouble, waiting, expense, and delay that arises between the household or hotel and the actual rail. It was an ideal that must have been at least possible to an intelligent person fifty years ago, and, had it been resolutely pursued, the world, instead of fumbling from compromise to compromise as it always has done and as it will do very probably for many centuries yet, might have been provided to-day, not only with an infinitely more practicable method of communication, but with one capable of a steady and continual evolution from year to year.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} {{the problem of}} designing a logistic network for Less Than Truckload (LTL) shipments of freight transport providers. These companies have to collect products from many origins (suppliers) and ship them to many destinations (clients) through multistop routes and consolidate flows into hubs to achieve economies of scale. This problem {{is known as the}} Hub Location Routing Problem (HLRP). The main decisions concern the location of hubs, allocation of origin and destination nodes to the hubs, as well as the design of routes serving origin and destination nodes and determination of flows between hubs. We propose a mathematical model for the HLRP with capacity on hubs and single allocation, dedicated to postal service systems, where <b>collections</b> <b>and</b> <b>deliveries</b> may occur within the same routes. A metaheuristic based on a genetic algorithm, improved by a local search is developped to solve the problem. Experiments are conducted on data sets adapted from the Australian Post (AP) data set.
