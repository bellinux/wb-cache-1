The classifier or diagnosis result <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> value (continuous output), {{in which case}} the classifier boundary between classes must be determined by a threshold value (for instance, to determine whether a person has hypertension based on a blood pressure measure). Or it can be a discrete class label, indicating one of the classes.|$|E
25|$|Although insects {{can be a}} problem, by far {{the biggest}} killer of {{carnivorous}} plants (besides human maltreatment) is grey mold (Botrytis cinerea). This thrives under warm, humid conditions and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> problem in winter. To some extent, temperate carnivorous plants can be protected from this pathogen by ensuring that they are kept cool and well ventilated in winter and that any dead leaves are removed promptly. If this fails, a fungicide is in order.|$|E

When the pair have a boxing match, the prisoners and guards watch with interest. Although Luke is severely outmatched by his larger opponent, he refuses to acquiesce.

500|$|During {{his four}} years at Michigan, Woolfolk had what one {{reporter}} described as [...] "a strange love-hate relationship" [...] with Coach Bo Schembechler. Woolfolk noted at the time Schembechler is a [...] "tough coach", and it was [...] "not easy at all" [...] playing for him. Schembechler was often angered by Woolfolk's tendency to try to run around defenders rather than banging through them, resulting in Woolfolk being benched more than once. But Schembechler said Woolfolk [...] "came of age" [...] in the November 1980 Ohio State game. After Woolfolk's MVP performance in the 1981 Rose Bowl helped Schembechler to his first bowl game victory, Bo complimented Woolfolk's powerful performance, noting: [...] "Butch <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> load." [...] By the 1981 season, Schembechler was a true believer in Woolfolk, saying: [...] "Today, I can say without reservation, that I'd rather go into a big game with Woolfolk at tailback than any other back in the country." [...] Woolfolk, too, concluded {{in the end that}} Schembechler was [...] "key" [...] to his success: [...] "He kept after me. He kept saying I was getting too fancy. He kept saying, 'You're a big back, a fast back, and you ought to be running over people -- not trying to dance around them.'" ...|$|E

500|$|The {{gameplay}} received very mixed reviews, {{with the}} artificial intelligence universally derided and other gameplay elements garnering {{a range of}} opinions. Bozon said that [...] "the A.I. <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> pain, as characters often take extremely odd routes to destinations or show command issues when engaging enemies", Joe Juba of Game Informer called the pathfinding [...] "laughably terrible", a criticism echoed by Jeremy Parish of 1UP.com, and Parkin called it [...] "an unmitigated disaster". VanOrd termed it [...] "the worst, most broken system of unit pathfinding ever devised", and Gann felt {{it was so bad}} that it showed that the developers [...] "had no idea what they were doing" [...] in making an RTS. Bozon felt that the overall real-time strategy gameplay, however, was deep, if a bit slow, as did VanOrd. Parkin felt that the gameplay was [...] "easy and intuitive", though slow, while Parish felt that the limitations of the Nintendo DS's small screens made the game too streamlined for an RTS game. Juba and the GamePro reviewer felt that the restrictions necessary to fit an RTS on a system the size of the DS made the game too simple and easy. The Japanese Famitsu review, however, felt that the game worked well as an RTS for the Nintendo DS, and was well-suited to the console. Both Bozon and Parish felt that the local multiplayer was better than the single-player game, though Bozon felt that the lack of online multiplayer was stifling and VanOrd felt that the tie between the multiplayer game and the player's single-player progress imbalanced any game where both players had not fully completed the storyline.|$|E
