40|$|The authors examine risk {{management}} options for Egyptian cottons, the export prices for which are volatile. They use regression analysis to establish whether Egyptian cotton's prices can be effectively hedged by using existing futures contracts on the New York Cotton Exchange. They find {{no relationship between}} the movements in prices of Egyptian long and extra-long cottons and prices for the base quality of U. S. medium <b>staple</b> <b>cotton</b> traded on the New York futures market. (Probably because Egyptian cotton prices are government-determined, U. S. medium <b>staple</b> <b>cotton</b> prices are influenced by price support policies unrelated to the longer staple markets, and the fiber of the cottons analyzed have different physical characteristics.) So, the New York cotton futures market's No. 2 contract is not an appropriate mechanism for hedging the price risk facing Egyptian cotton under present procedures for determining prices - and probably not under market-determined prices. If the cotton market in Egypt is liberalized, cotton prices there may correlate more with prices elsewhere - especially for the longer <b>staple</b> <b>cottons.</b> The authors extend their regression analysis to the prices of other medium <b>staple</b> <b>cottons</b> - Australian, Central Asian, Mexican, Pakistani, and Turkish - to determine how they behave relative to U. S. medium <b>staple</b> <b>cotton</b> prices. None of these prices had short-term movements closely related to U. S. cotton prices, indicating mainly the influence of domestic policies on the U. S. market. Again, the New York futures No. 2 contract {{does not provide a}} satisfactory hedge for these cottons. The cotton futures contract recently introduced in New York (world cotton contract) - based on the Cotlook A Index - may prove useful for hedging the price risk for some cottons (especially Australian, Central Asian, and Pakistani) but apparently not Egyptian cotton. The authors recommend (together with privatizing the industry) establishing a domestic spot market to give transparency to the price-forming process. When the spot market is functioning well, establishing a foward market could provide a hedging instrument for Egyptian cotton.

40|$|Cotton is an {{important}} agricultural commodity, providing income to millions of farmers in industrial and developing countries. Technological changes in the textile industry mean that priorities concerning fibre properties have also changed and cotton breeders have concentrated on improvement in fibre traits {{to meet the demands}} of industry. Because of adoption of rotor spinning that converts raw fibre into yarns at a speed of 150 mmin- 1 as compared to 20 m min- 1 of ring spinning, the requirements of textile industries of raw cotton have changed. According to these new norms, fibre strength is a greater determinant of yarn quality. India is the only country where all four of the cultivated species of cotton are grown for commerce.

40|$|Graduation date: 1985 The Egyptian economy depends {{heavily on}} cotton {{as the major}} export {{commodity}} among agricultural commodities. Egypt is the largest exporter of extra long <b>staple</b> <b>cotton</b> in the world followed by Sudan and Peru. It provides about 45 {{percent of the world}} exports of extra long <b>staple</b> <b>cotton.</b> Instability in the demand and prices received for cotton result in instability in foreign exchange earnings upon which it depends for imports of other commodities. Therefore, Egyptian policy makers need to {{have a better understanding of}} the cotton market, of how the market functions, and of the factors which affect Egyptian exports. Egyptian cotton faces competition from other long staple exporting countries, mainly Sudan. The U. S. is the major producing and exporting country of short and medium <b>staple</b> <b>cotton.</b> The introduction of man-made fibers is believed to have affected the market for Egyptian cotton. The effect of variations in the income of the importing countries must be considered. In this study, a simultaneous equation model was developed in order to investigate these effects. The model consists of eight structural equations, representing the demand for and supply of export cotton for Egypt, Sudan, Peru and the U. S. The analysis is based on time series data for the period 1950 - 80. The results show that the export price of each country is the major factor in determining the export sales of its cotton. Demand elasticities ranged from - 0. 95 to - 1. 21. Egypt's export price affects the demand for Sudan's cotton, and Sudan's price affects the demand for Egypt's cotton. Peru's export quantities are affected by Egypt and Sudan prices more than they affect them. U.
