The author has also concluded that the subject of the evasion of taxes and other <b>compulsory</b> <b>payments</b> does not include increase in the tax principal debt, fine and late charge, which are covered by the financial responsibility.

Zakat is a <b>compulsory</b> <b>payment</b> i. e. a tax in this sense paid to the government on one’s income and wealth. The Zakat rates are studied for their viability and effectiveness to fulfill fiscal needs of the government. Based on the evidence from many countries, it is argued that Zakat rates are substantial enough to generate the needed public finance given the large tax base and free the government from using seignorage and deficit financing. Its compulsory nature both as per law of the land and as per religion would ensure minimum tax evasion and its progressive and direct nature would effectively redistribute income. The effect of Zakat on the overall macroeconomy, the financial system, monetary system, property market, stock market, inflation, foreign debt, balance of payments, FDI and the on the development oriented variables like inequality and poverty are also discussed to give a holistic view {{of the effects of the}} proposed system. ...|$|E

40|$|Individual Transferable Quota (ITQ) {{systems have}} been used to control harvests and {{increase}} fisheries’ economic efficiency; however, they do not eliminate competitive fishing which can result in stock and congestion externalities that are especially apparent when resources are spatially heterogeneous within the controlled region of the ITQ system. These externalities arise because ITQ systems do not control the spatial distribution of effort leaving fishers to concentrate their effort in more profitable patches. We explored the potential for cooperative behavior to reduce this congestion using an experimental economics approach in the context of management of a stock enhancement program (SEP). Four treatments were applied involving different systems which were: compulsory, voluntary and by-use payment for the SEP, with either open or exclusive access to the enhanced zone (EZ). Income is either directly to individuals or split between participants through income-sharing (as occurs in cooperatives). Voluntary payment to fund the SEP enabled individuals to opt out of cooperation, which reduced the enhancement activity and led to a significantly lower cooperation than the optimal level and also lower relative to the <b>compulsory</b> <b>payment</b> system. Treatments that included a by-use payment combined with exclusive access to the EZ were most effective in preventing dissipation of economic rent. The different rule settings were affected by participants’ expectations of reciprocity, with greater involvement and thus production from the SEP amongst cooperative participants. Perceptions of vulnerability were also important, as more self-interested participants were more likely to exclude themselves from the SEP. The structure of rules may enable individuals who are more intrinsically cooperative to drive the fishery towards a state with low rent dissipation...|$|E
30|$|The single-bound dichotomous choice {{contingent}} valuation questions {{were used in}} the study. Before the CV question was asked, the current conditions, biodiversity as well as the benefits of U Minh Thuong National Park were introduced. Then, we identified some threats of biodiversity loss such as encroachment, disturbance of vegetation, environmental pollution, wildlife hunting, and trade occurring in this area. A hypothetical conservation program was proposed to prevent from biodiversity loss in the national park. Biodiversity will continue to degrade more seriously without this conservation project. The study proposed funding a biodiversity conservation project {{to increase the number of}} plants and animals in U Minh Thuong National Park or at least keep them from declining every year. The conservation fund could then request international organizations to provide the same amount of money or more compared with the contributions of residents. The raised money would be only used for conservation activities in U Minh Thuong National Park (See the section of CV question for more details in the Appendix). The payment vehicle was used as voluntary continuous donation, contributed through a monthly water bill for three years, which could catch the present value of preferences for biodiversity conservation and also prevent potential protests due to <b>compulsory</b> <b>payment</b> like taxes (Rolfe et al., [2000]). Each household was interviewed whether he/she would be willing to contribute the biodiversity conservation fund a certain amount of money every month as surcharge on his/her household water bills for the next three years. The admissible answers were ‘yes’ or ‘no’. Five different bid values of VND 10, 000, VND 35, 000, VND 60, 000, VND 85, 000 and VND 110, 000 were chosen for the study. These values are equivalent to values in US dollarsa of $ 0.47, $ 1.66, $ 2.84, $ 4.21 and $ 5.20, respectively. Each household was randomly interviewed whether he/she would be willing to contribute one of these bid values and answered whether he/she accepted only one bid value. For example, the respondent was asked ‘Would you be willing to pay VND 10, 000 every month for biodiversity conservation program in U Minh Thuong?’ If the answer was ‘yes’, the list of ‘yes’ reasons was then presented. If the response was ‘no’, the list of ‘no’ reasons was then introduced and an open-end question was also asked whether a respondent would like to contribute another lower amount of money to identify the categories of protest zero, valid zero and WTP less bids.|$|E

Unlike marginal tax rates, the repayment rate applies on the full HRI, so that a person with a HRI of $39,500 in the 2007/08 tax year would not have to make any compulsory HELP repayment, but a person with a HRI of $40,000 would make a payment of $1,600. This is 4% of the HRI (not taxable income or the debt balance) of $40,000. The compulsory repayment amount cannot exceed the balance of the HELP debt.|$|R
2500|$|The year 1549 saw an {{unprecedented}} rebellion in Norfolk. Unlike popular challenges {{elsewhere in the}} Tudor period, {{it appears to have}} been Protestant in nature.

In the case of Norwich this process was underscored later by the arrival of Dutch and Flemish [...] "Strangers" [...] fleeing persecution from the Catholics and eventually numbering as many as one third of the city's population. Large numbers of such exiles came to the city, especially Flemish Protestants [...] from the Westkwartier ("Western Quarter"), the region in the Southern Netherlands where the first Calvinist fires of the Dutch Revolt had spread.

Indeed, there exists heterogeneity across countries in the public sector involvement in the different sectors of the economy. For example, according to Danmarks Statistik and the Spanish Labour Force Survey, while in Denmark, the number of general government employees in the Health and Education sectors is close to 90 % and more than 80 %, respectively; in Spain, these percentages are about 50 and 60 %, respectively.

Secondly, the flexibility of fiscal policy and thus the ability to influence the economic situation is reduced when hypothecation is used.|$|R

40|$|Premiums {{constitute}} {{the cost of}} insurance protection. There are however authors who tend to find some tax elements in them. This article aims at presenting {{the conditions in which}} such a view may be regarded as correct and when the marks which are the characteristics of taxes can also appear in premiums paid on account of insurance as part of the Polish insurance system. Taxes are commonly regarded as being obligatory and not subject to refund. Compulsion cannot, however, be the right criterion that differentiates taxes from other payments and also from premiums. Although premiums are <b>compulsory</b> <b>payments</b> paid by the insured they cannot be compared to taxes. It is not because of the fiscal reasons that obligatory insurance was introduced. It was destined to popularize it in those fields in which such popularization proved to be necessary. Premiums as a cost for insurance protection must be equivalent. The degree of the rate of payment depends upon the realization of the principle of equilibrium between the premiums and the amount recoverable. In practice the premiums paid by the insured are not only destined to make good any loss or damage or to pay benefits, but also form a preventive fund and a reserve fund. The part of premiums which constitutes the preventive fund can be regarded as a specific kind of tax securing financial means for undertakings preventing the occurrence of events. The other part of the premiums which provides for the reserve fund bears even more distinctive marks of a tax. This fund is a form of revenue subject to refunding. As the insurance company has never exercised its right to that fund the payments on that account may be considered a permanent source of budget income.
