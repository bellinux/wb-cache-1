50|$|In May 1984, Rammy Arms Crew and Benny's Mob led {{a weekend}} of {{violence}} and chaos in the seaside town of Torquay. Police had made the game a 7:30 pm Saturday kick off with Torquay United to try and avoid trouble, but it backfired totally as hordes of Blackpool fans travelled down on the Friday instead and stayed over until Sunday, where they caused 24 hours of carnage. The local Torquay newspaper headline read, “Soccer Mob Storms Resort”. 61 Blackpool fans were arrested, 5 people treated for stab wounds, including a man from Liverpool who was attacked with a <b>carpet</b> <b>knife</b> and received a 15-inch wound. Thousands of pounds worth of damage was done to the town with The Yacht House pub wrecked and a nightclub front demolished. Two Rammy Arms members were even convicted of stealing a four poster bed from a luxury hotel. Helen Chamberlain a presenter of Sky Sports Soccer AM show, and a Torquay United fan, would many years later on the show state that “Blackpool fans are mad”.|$|E
25|$|The Yaz culture (or Yaz-depe, Yaz Depe, Yaz Tepe) was {{an early}} Iron Age culture of Margiana, Bactria and Sogdia (ca. 1500–1000 BC). It emerges {{at the top of}} late Bronze Age sites (BMAC), {{sometimes}} as stone towers and sizeable houses associated with irrigation systems. Ceramics were mostly hand-made, but there was increasing use of wheel-thrown ware. There have been found bronze or iron arrowheads, also iron sickles or <b>carpet</b> <b>knives</b> among other artifacts.|$|R
50|$|Few {{essential}} {{tools are}} needed in <b>carpet</b> weaving: <b>Knives</b> are used to cut the yarn after the knot is made, a heavy instrument like a comb for beating in the wefts, {{and a pair of}} scissors for trimming off the ends of the yarn after each row of knots is finished. From region to region, they vary in size and design, and in some areas are supplemented by other tools. The weavers of Tabriz used a combined blade and hook. The hook projects {{from the end of the}} blade, and is used for knotting, instead of knotting with the fingers. Comb-beaters are passed through the warp strings to beat in the wefts. When the rug is completed, the pile is often shorn with special knives to obtain an even surface.|$|R
5000|$|... (C6) A hawkbill blade is {{sharpened}} on {{the inside}} edge and is similar to <b>carpet</b> and linoleum <b>knives.</b> The point will tear even {{if the rest of}} the knife is comparatively dull. The karambit from Far South-East Asia is a hawkbill knife which is held with the blade extending {{from the bottom of the}} fist and the tip facing forward. The outside edge of a karambit may be sharp and if so may also feature a backwards facing point.|$|R
50|$|Bou-Saada has {{traditionally}} been an important market place producing and selling jewelry, metalwork, <b>carpets</b> and bousaadi <b>knives.</b> There is also a textile mill in town. Even in modern times, Bou-Saada is an important trading post for nomads. There is also some national tourism during winter.Bou-Saada is well-connected with other urban centres by road. M'Sila is 70 km northeast, Biskra is 175 km east, Bordj Bou Arreridj 130 km northeast and Djelfa 120 km southwest.Bou-Saada has two quarters, the old medina (ksar) within the city walls with arched alleyways, and the French town to the south. Surrounding the town are extensive date groves.|$|R
40|$|The coast {{under study}} has been {{subdivided}} into 5 physiographical units. The physiographic area includes about 22 km of coastline, 10 of which of sandy beach, 5 of low rocky coast and 7 of cliffy coast. The outcropping rocks are those related to the Hercynian cycle, with the typical sequence of intrusive events represented by tonalites, granodiorites and leucogranitic plutons. The studied area includes includes only the sectors B and C. The wave-cut (cliff) stretches of coast, oriented according to these lineations are considerably fractured and crossed by tectonic lines perpendicular to the coast, on which processes of linear erosion and deep valleys have evolved. All physiographical units under study present maximum exposure to the winds and waves from west and north-west. The morphology of the submerged beaches of north western Gallura is strongly affected by the outcropping of the crystalline basement that determines its geomorphological arrangement The distribution of the dike set strongly affects coastal morphology by creating natural barriers to longitudinal transport, defining physiographic entities and creating tombolos and isolated rocks. La Liccia, Rena Majori and Bureddaggia are highly exposed beaches, liable to very intense swell with modest SW-NE net energy flow. Naracu Nieddu and Lu Litarroni beaches are poorly exposed, liable to intense swell with mild SW-NE net energy flow. Tourism {{represents one of the}} predominant sectors of the local economic systems and has influenced all other forms of the use of those parts of coast and sea, who have oriented themselves towards an organisation suitable for the needs of tourism. Tourist activities include various compartments of quality of the agricultural nutrition sector (to think about wine, cheese, bread and so on) and furthermore traditional and artistic trade or craft (fabrication of baskets, <b>carpets,</b> ceramics, <b>knives,</b> leather, wooden objects etc.). Of fundamental importance is the analysis of “progettualità” deriving from the socio-economic energies used for planning, programming (in particular of the local development programs, the instruments for urban development) and from those which regard actions {{in the area of the}} Quadro Comunitario di Sostegno also with the recent instrument of “Progettatione Integrata Territoriale” (PIT). With these reports it will be possible to verify a new scheme of territorial order, which directly originates from knowledge about the intentions of the local administration and the economic world in relation to the two principal objectives of development: -Strengthening and re-establishing entrepreneurship by productive investments in principally tourism-related activities, -Realisation, alignment and completion of infrastructural devices to be provided by the public (water pipes, the net of sewers, recycling…) and service...|$|R
