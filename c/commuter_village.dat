5|$|In 1863, {{with the}} {{cemetery}} fully operational and a planned new lunatic asylum near Brookwood likely to boost traffic, the LSWR agreed {{to build a}} mainline station at Brookwood, along with an improved Necropolis Junction and a goods yard, provided the LNC supplied the necessary land and built the approach road and stationmaster's house for the new station. The new station, called Brookwood (Necropolis) railway station (the suffix was gradually dropped), opened on 1 June 1864. A substantial <b>commuter</b> <b>village</b> grew around the northern (i.e. non-cemetery) side of the new station, and the station building (on the northern side of the tracks) was enlarged in 1890. In conjunction with these works, a branch line was added in 1890 from a bay platform to the National Rifle Association's shooting range at Bisley, running west {{to the north of}} the LSWR main line before curving north to Bisley.|$|E

25|$|Today, Ravensworth is {{primarily}} a <b>commuter</b> <b>village,</b> and the historically important agricultural sector now employs {{only a small number}} of people. Stone mining was once important to the local economy, and although that industry had died out by the twentieth century, a sandstone quarry was recently opened outside the village. The village is served by a primary school, a public house and a chapel, and contains a large village green.|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} the {{cemetery}} opened, the nearest railway station other than those on the cemetery branch was Woking railway station, [...] away. As only one train per day ran from London to the cemetery stations and back, and even that ran only when funerals were due to take place, access to the cemetery was difficult for mourners and LNC staff. Although in the negotiations leading {{to the creation of}} the cemetery the LSWR had told the LNC that they planned to build a main line station near the cemetery, they had not done so. On 1 June 1864 the LSWR finally opened Brookwood railway station on their main line, immediately adjacent to the cemetery. A substantial <b>commuter</b> <b>village</b> grew around the northern (i.e. non-cemetery) side of the new station.|$|E

5000|$|Attempts {{to define}} the exact {{geographic}} meaning of Leeds lead {{to a variety of}} concepts of its extent, varying by context include the area of the city centre, the urban sprawl, the administrative boundaries, and the functional region.

500|$|Since the {{independence}} of Morocco, Marrakesh has thrived as a tourist destination. In the 1960s and early 1970s the city became a trendy [...] "hippie mecca". It attracted numerous western rock stars and musicians, artists, film directors and actors, models, and fashion divas, leading tourism revenues to double in Morocco between 1965 and 1970. Yves Saint Laurent, The Beatles, The Rolling Stones and Jean-Paul Getty all spent significant time in the city; Laurent bought a property here and renovated the Majorelle Gardens. Expatriates, especially those from France, have invested heavily in Marrakesh since the 1960s, and developed many of the riads and palaces. Old buildings were renovated in the Old Medina, new residences and <b>commuter</b> <b>villages</b> {{were built in the}} suburbs, and new hotels began to spring up.|$|R
