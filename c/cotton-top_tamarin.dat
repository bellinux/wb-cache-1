25|$|The <b>cotton-top</b> <b>tamarin</b> is diurnal and {{sleeps with}} its social group in trees with foliage cover. The group leaves the {{sleeping}} tree together {{an hour after}} dawn and spends the day foraging, resting, travelling, and grooming. The species is thought to rise late and increases the speed of its foraging and travelling before dusk to avoid crepuscular and nocturnal predators. Its main predators include raptors, mustelids, felids, and snakes. The <b>cotton-top</b> <b>tamarin</b> is extremely vigilant, always looking for potential predators. When the group is resting, one individual moves apart and acts as a lookout to alert the group if it sees a threat.|$|E
25|$|The <b>cotton-top</b> <b>tamarin</b> makes selective, {{specialized}} vocalizations in {{the presence}} of food. These include the C-call, produced when a cotton-top approaches and sorts through food, and the D-call, which is associated with food retrieval and is exhibited while eating.|$|E

25|$|Other studies {{involving}} <b>cotton-top</b> <b>tamarins</b> have {{hinted that}} positive reciprocity and reciprocal altruism are irrelevant in the prosociality of these primates. Some researchers believe these primates tend to cooperate for selfish reasons and {{in situations where}} they incur some benefit for themselves. That is, cooperation in <b>cotton-top</b> <b>tamarins</b> can be better described by mutualism than by true altruism.|$|R
25|$|Among {{the typical}} <b>cotton-top</b> <b>tamarin</b> {{communicative}} vocalizations, the combination long call (CLC) and the alarm call (AC) {{are the most}} heavily represented in the literature. CLCs encompass a range of contact calls that are produced by isolated individuals using chirps and whistles. This type of call is also used for seemingly altruistic alarm calls, thus adding to its range of cooperative behaviors. It is issued {{in the presence of}} kin when a threatening llamas predator is seen. Predators of the <b>cotton-top</b> <b>tamarin</b> include snakes, ocelots, tayras, and most notably, hawks. Early observations by Patricia Neyman even showed that cotton-tops produce diverse sets of alarm calls that can discriminate the presence of birds of prey versus ground-based predators.|$|E
25|$|The Proyecto Tití ("Project Tamarin") {{was started}} in 1985 to provide {{information}} and support in conservation of the <b>cotton-top</b> <b>tamarin</b> and its habitat in northern Colombia. Proyecto Tití's programs combine field research, education, and community programs to spread awareness about this endangered species and encourage the public to participate in its protection. It now has partner status with the Wildlife Conservation Network.|$|E
25|$|The illegal pet {{trade and}} {{scientific}} research {{have also been}} cited as factors by the IUCN. While biomedical studies have recently limited their use of this species, illegal capture for the pet trade still {{plays a major role}} in endangering the cotton-top. Before 1976, when CITES listed the species under Appendix I banning all international trade, the <b>cotton-top</b> <b>tamarin</b> was exported for use in biomedical research.|$|E

25|$|The <b>cotton-top</b> <b>tamarin</b> has {{a diet of}} mainly fruit (40%) {{and animal}} {{material}} (40%). This includes insects, plant exudates such as gum and sap, nectar, and occasionally reptiles and amphibians. Due to its small body size and high food passage rate, its diet must be high-quality and high-energy. Insectivory is common in the cotton-top and the species hunts for insects {{using a variety of}} methods: stealth, pouncing, chasing, exploring holes, and turning over leaves.|$|E
25|$|The <b>cotton-top</b> <b>tamarin</b> is seen {{to produce}} food calls both in the {{presence}} and absence of group members. Additionally, response to food calls are directed back to an original caller independent of visual confirmation of a food source. While this {{may appear to be}} a result from a very primitive form of communication, Roush and Snowdon (2005) maintain that the food-calling behavior confers some mentally representable information about food to recipient tamarins.|$|E
25|$|The {{cooperative}} breeding hypothesis {{predicts that}} cotton-top tamarins engage with this young-rearing paradigm, {{and in turn}} naturally embrace patterns of prosocial behavior. These monkeys engage in such behavior by acting altruistically within their groups in caring for infants, vocalizing alarm calls, and in sharing food. Though some studies indicate that cotton-top tamarins have the psychological capacity to participate in reciprocally mediated altruism, {{it is unclear whether}} the <b>cotton-top</b> <b>tamarin</b> acts solely using judgements on reinforcement history.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The glycoconjugate-binding {{properties}} and {{the expression of}} carcinoembryonic antigen in colonic cancers of <b>cotton-top</b> <b>tamarins</b> at the German Primate Center are described. Deviating from findings in non-tumorous colonic epithelia of <b>cotton-top</b> <b>tamarins</b> was the presence of UEA-, SBA-, or DBA-binding sites in the infranuclear cytoplasm of colonic epithelial cells, staining of entire cells, and the occurrence of subepithelial extracellular glycoconjugates in and adjacent to colonic cancers.

Key words: CEA; colon cancer; cotton-top tamarins; lectin histochemistry. <b>Cotton-top</b> <b>tamarins</b> (CTTs [Saguinus oedipus oed-ipus]) spontaneously develop colonic cancer in statis-tically significant numbers. To date, approximately 300 cases of CTT colonic cancers have occurred worldwide in a limited number of all in adult (> 2 years of age) animals.

25|$|The <b>cotton-top</b> <b>tamarin</b> {{displays}} {{a wide variety}} of social behaviors. In particular, groups form a clear dominance hierarchy where only dominant pairs breed. The female normally gives birth to twins and uses pheromones to prevent other females in the group from breeding. These tamarins have been extensively studied for their high level of cooperative care, as well as altruistic and spiteful behaviors. Communication between cotton-top tamarins is sophisticated and shows evidence of grammatical structure, a language feature that must be acquired.|$|E
25|$|The <b>cotton-top</b> <b>tamarin</b> is {{a highly}} social primate that {{typically}} lives in groups of two to nine individuals, but may reach up to 13 members. These small familial groups tend to fluctuate in size and in composition of individuals and a clear dominance hierarchy is always present within a party. At {{the head of the}} group is the breeding pair. The male and female in this pair are typically in a monogamous reproductive relationship, and together serve as the group's dominant leaders.|$|E
25|$|Another {{way to look}} at {{punishment}} in cotton-top tamarins is by observing their aggressive behavioral responses within and between groups, as well as between species. The <b>cotton-top</b> <b>tamarin,</b> like many marmosets, other tamarins, and specifically those in the genus Saguinus, stages aggressive displays almost exclusively towards fellow monkeys that belong to the same gender. These intrasexual displays of aggression are more frequent in females, and are vital when a breeding female is forcing both subadult and adult females to emigrate out of a familial group.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Disseminated encephalitozoonosis was {{diagnosed}} in 2 sibling, juvenile, <b>cotton-top</b> <b>tamarins</b> (Saguinus oedipus) and 3 sibling, neonatal, emperor tamarins (S. imperator) {{by use of}} histologic examination, histochemical analysis, electron microscopy, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis with nucleotide sequencing. All tamarins were captive born at zoos in North America and died with no premonitory signs of disease. The main pathologic findings were myocarditis (4 / 5), hepatitis (3 / 5), interstitial pneumonia (3 / 5), skeletal myositis (3 / 5), meningoencephalitis (2 / 5), adrenalitis (2 / 5), tubulointerstitial nephritis (1 / 5), myelitis (1 / 5), sympathetic ganglioneuritis (1 / 5), and retinitis (1 / 5). Central nervous system lesions were the most prominent findings in <b>cotton-top</b> <b>tamarins.</b> The inflammation was predominantly lymphocytic and suppurative in <b>cotton-top</b> <b>tamarins,</b> whereas emperor tamarins had granulomatous or lymphoplasmacytic lesions. Intralesional periodic acid–Schiff-, gram-, or acid–fast (or all 3) -positive, oval-to-elliptical shaped organisms were found in 1 cotton-top and the 3 emperor tamarins. By electron microscopy, these organisms were consistent with microsporidia of the genus Encephalitozoon. E. cuniculi genotype III was detected by PCR analysis and sequencing in paraffin-embedded brain, lung, and bone marrow specimens from the <b>cotton-top</b> <b>tamarins.</b> Although PCR results were negative {{for one of the}} emperor tamarins, their dam was seropositive for E. cuniculi by ELISA an...|$|R

25|$|Up to 40,000 {{cotton-top}} tamarins {{are thought}} to have been caught and exported for use in biomedical research before 1976, when CITES gave them the highest level of protection and all international trade was banned. Now, the species is at risk due to large-scale habitat destruction, as the lowland forest in northwestern Colombia where the <b>cotton-top</b> <b>tamarin</b> is found has been reduced to 5% of its previous area. It is currently classified as critically endangered {{and is one of the}} rarest primates in the world, with only 6,000 individuals left in the wild.|$|E
25|$|C-call {{chirping}} {{is believed}} to be an honest signal for communicating food preference, and a <b>cotton-top</b> <b>tamarin</b> more often and more rapidly vocalizes with these chirps when approaching a highly favored food source. Functionally, this behavior may inform other tamarins of the actions the caller will take in a feeding context and whether a preferable food source is available. Despite this research indicating that food calls may be informative to fellow group mates, other observations of cotton-tops show that quantity and distribution of food and audience do not significantly alter a caller's food-centered vocalizations.|$|E
25|$|CLCs {{involve the}} {{production}} of complex sequence multisyllabic vocalizations. Researchers have argued that long calls exhibit individual differences, thus can carry information sufficient for recipients to determine caller identity. Using habituation-discrimination paradigms in language experiments, this theory has been confirmed multiple times in literature. However, the individual syllables within a complete CLC vocalization in isolation of each other do not transfer sufficient information to communicate messages between monkeys. Scientists thus consider the whole, intact string of vocalizations to be the unit of perception for CLCs in the <b>cotton-top</b> <b>tamarin.</b> These examinations may confirm that cotton-tops incorporate a lexical syntax in areas of their communication.|$|E
40|$|Summary. Urine was {{collected}} from 6 female <b>cotton-top</b> <b>tamarins</b> (Saguinus o. oedipus) and urinary oestrone and oestradiol concentrations were measured by radioimmuno-assay. Oestrone was excreted at 50 -fold higher concentrations than oestradiol. Five females showed patterns of regular oestrone cyclicity, {{with a mean}} peak-to-peak oestrone cycle of 23 =. =+-=. days. Levels of oestradiol tended to vary with levels of oestrone excretion, but peaks were less pronounced and more variable. The sixth female, diagnosed as having 'wasting marmoset syndrome', had very low levels of excreted oestrogens, suggesting infertility. We suggest that urinary oestrone provides a good index to ovarian cyclicity in female <b>cotton-top</b> <b>tamarins...</b>|$|R

25|$|The <b>cotton-top</b> <b>tamarin</b> has fur {{covering}} {{all of the}} body except the palms of the hands and feet, the eyelids, {{the borders of the}} nostrils, the nipples, the anus, and the penis. The back is brown, and the underparts, arms and legs are whitish-yellow. The rump and inner thighs and upper tail are reddish-orange. The fur is distributed with varying densities throughout the body: the genital region (scrotum and pubic zone), axilla, and the base of the tail have lower densities, while the forward region is much higher. Many individuals have stripes or whorls of fur of striking coloration on their throats. The cotton-top also has whiskers on its forehead and around its mouth.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the first}} 20 weeks after a <b>cotton-top</b> <b>tamarin</b> is born, {{it is not}} fully capable of {{producing}} the range of vocalizations that an adult monkey can. Despite this limitation on speech producibility, researchers believe that language acquisition occurs early on with speech comprehension abilities arising first. Infants can at times produce adult-like chirps, but this is rarely done in the correct context and remains inconsistent across the first 20 weeks of life. Regardless, infant cotton-tops are able to respond in behaviorally appropriate ways to varying contexts when presented with adult chirps. This indicates that verbal perception is a quickly acquired skill for offspring, followed closely by auditory comprehension, and later by proper vocal producibility.|$|E
25|$|Despite an {{expansive}} array of altruistic behaviors, cotton-top tamarins engage in great bouts of spite through negative reciprocity and punishment. They {{have been observed}} to immediately start denying cooperation with monkeys that deny them benefits. Further, in captivity, these primates are not observed to increase altruistic behavior with fellow primates that are committed fully to cooperation. Based on this, researchers believe that repeated interactions in a cooperative society {{like that of the}} <b>cotton-top</b> <b>tamarin</b> can heighten the chances that an individual will designate behavioral punishments to others in its group. This reaction has also been observed in other species. However, these reciprocal punishments, or relative lack of altruistic actions, may alternatively happen as a result of response facilitation that increases the chances of a cotton-top punishing another primate after watching that individual perform a similar action.|$|E

25|$|Dominant pairs are {{the only}} {{breeding}} pair within their groups, and the female generally has authority over the breeding male. While nonbreeding group members can be the leading pair's offspring, immigrant adults may also live with and cooperate in these groups. This social grouping in <b>cotton-top</b> <b>tamarins</b> is hypothesized to arise from predation pressure. <b>Cotton-top</b> <b>tamarins</b> exhibit prosocial behavior that benefits {{other members of the}} group, and are well known for engaging in cooperative breeding whereby the group's subordinate adults help in rearing the offspring of the dominant pair. The dominant female is more likely to give birth to nonidentical twins than a singleton, so it would be too energetically expensive for just one pair to raise the young.|$|R
