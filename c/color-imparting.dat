40|$|Upwelling water-leaving {{radiance}} {{transmitted through}} the atmosphere and received by satellite sensors carries information on <b>color-imparting</b> water components, either naturally occurring or man-induced. Therefore, our understanding of optical processes operating on the air-water surface and within the water column has an utmost importance. However, rigorous theory of underwater light field based on solution of radiative transfer equation (RTE) is very complicated and cannot be used in routine remote sensing practice. On the other hand, it appears that simple radiative transfer models for semi-infinite plane-parallel layers, such a...|$|E
40|$|As long as dinosaurs {{have been}} known there has been {{speculation}} about their appearance. Fossil feathers can preserve the morphology of <b>color-imparting</b> melanosomes, which allows color patterns in feathered dinosaurs to be reconstructed. Here we map feather color patterns in a Late Jurassic basal paravian theropod dinosaur. Quantitative comparisons with melanosome shape and density in extant feathers indicate that the body was gray and dark and the face had rufous speckles. The crown was rufous, and the long limb feathers were white with distal black spangles. The evolution of melanin-based within-feather pigmentation patterns may coincide with that of elongate pennaceous feathers in the common ancestor of Maniraptora, before active powered flight. Feathers may thus {{have played a role}} in sexual selectio...|$|E
40|$|Penguin {{feathers}} {{are highly}} modified {{in form and}} function, {{but there have been}} no fossils to inform their evolution. A giant penguin with feathers was recovered from the late Eocene (similar to 36 million years ago) of Peru. The fossil reveals that key feathering features, including undifferentiated primary wing feathers and broad body contour feather shafts, evolved early in the penguin lineage. Analyses of fossilized <b>color-imparting</b> melanosomes reveal that their dimensions were similar to those of non-penguin avian taxa and that the feathering may have been predominantly gray and reddish-brown. In contrast, the dark black-brown color of extant penguin feathers is generated by large, ellipsoidal melanosomes previously unknown for birds. The nanostructure of penguin feathers was thus modified after earlier macrostructural modifications of feather shape linked to aquatic flight...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Wood-plastic {{composites}} (WPCs) {{continue to}} make inroads into the decking market. One of the main drawbacks from the consumerâ€™s perspective {{is that they can}} fade during weathering. It has been shown that WPCs fade more when exposed to a combination of light and water spray than when exposed only to light. This suggests that the loss of the <b>color-imparting</b> extractives from the wood could be partly to blame for color fade. Pigments are routinely added to only the plastic matrix to combat WPC color fade despite the fact that change in color could be due primarily to changes in the wood component of WPCs. In this study, we investigated two methods of fiber pretreatment in an attempt to improve the color stability of WPCs. The first was to remove water-soluble extractives from wood flour through a series of washes. Washed wood flour was then compounded with high-density polyethylene and injection-molded into test specimens. The second method involved coloring wood flour with either a water-based dye or an oil-based stain. Colored wood flour was also compounded with high-density polyethylene and injection-molded into test specimens. Pigments were added to half of the composites containing colored wood. The composites underwent accelerated weathering in a xenon-arc weathering apparatus, and were monitored for changes in color. Washing wood flour and coloring wood flour with a water-based dye were inef fective for improving composite color stability during weathering. However, coloring wood flour with an oil-based stain resulted in a more color stable WPC...|$|E
