5|$|At 1800 on 20 January 1944, the {{headquarters}} of Major General A. H. Ramsay's 5th Division, which had <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> Lae, replaced that of the 9th Division. At {{the same time the}} 8th Infantry Brigade replaced the 20th. The 8th Infantry Brigade, which had spent much of the war on garrison duty in Western Australia, began departing Cairns on 10 January. The original intention had been for it to go to Lae to relieve the 29th Infantry Brigade, which had fought in the Salamaua-Lae campaign, but in December it was decided to ship it directly to Finschhafen. The brigade contained three infantry battalions, the 4th, 30th and 35th, all from New South Wales. It also still had the support of the 2/12th Field Regiment, 532nd EBSR, and A Company, Papuan Infantry Battalion. The brigade suffered its first casualties on the night of 21/22 January in a friendly fire incident, which was a common occurrence with units inexperienced in jungle warfare. Two Australians were killed and two wounded by their own comrades.|$|E
5|$|Several {{groups of}} men {{eventually}} {{made their way}} to Pine Ridge. Among the first was Lieutenant Eric Plant's platoon from the 9th Battalion. Captain John Whitham's company of the 12th Battalion moved forward from Bolton's Ridge when they saw the 6th Battalion moving up behind them. As the 6th Battalion reached the ridge, the companies carried on towards Gun Ridge, while Lieutenant-Colonel Walter McNicoll established the battalion headquarters below Bolton's Ridge. As the 6th Battalion moved forward they were engaged by Turkish small arms and artillery fire, causing heavy casualties. At 10:00 brigade headquarters received a message from the 6th Battalion asking for reinforcement, and McCay sent half the 5th Battalion to assist. At the same time the 8th Battalion were digging in on Bolton's, except for two companies which moved forward to attack a group of Turks that had <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> the south behind the 6th Battalion. By noon the 8th Battalion was dug in on the ridge; in front of them were scattered remnants of the 5th, 6th, 7th, and 9th Battalions, mostly out of view of each other in the scrub. Shortly after, McCay was informed that if he wanted the 6th Battalion to hold its position, it must be reinforced. So McCay sent his last reserves, a company of the 1st Battalion, and ordered the 8th to leave one company on the ridge and advance on the right of the 6th Battalion. The scattered formations managed to hold their positions {{for the remainder of the}} afternoon, then at 17:00 saw large numbers of Turkish troops coming over the southern section of Gun Ridge.|$|E

25|$|Early European explorers found Miami and Potawatomi peoples {{living near}} the mouth of the St. Joseph River at the site of present-day St. Joseph and Benton Harbor. The {{original}} Miami name for the river was Sakiwäsipi (Outlet River), later it was known as Kociihsasiipi. In 1654, Médard Chouart des Groseilliers of France and a French companion were the first Europeans to travel the river. In 1675 Père Jacques Marquette had <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> the Mississippi River via the Illinois River, then to the Kankakee River and portaged to the St. Joseph River near modern-day South Bend, Indiana and then down to Lake Michigan. On November 1, 1679 René Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle sailed southeast across Lake Michigan and built Fort Miami {{at the mouth of the}} river. La Salle named the river La Rivière des Miamis (River of the Miamis).|$|E
25|$|The salvage yard, {{which was}} {{situated}} near Noels Pond on , was finished to partial occupancy {{by the fall}} of 1954 and completed in 1955. Thirty Butler Buildings (prefabricated steel) were located on the property. The machinery which constructed the bypass road was buried {{at the end of the}} property when it became over used and obsolete in 1959/1960, under the supervision of Warrant Officer Ebb Higdon, Company A. They were later dug up to be sold for scrap but were found to be useless and reburied. This equipment had <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> Florida in Liberty ships, with the battalion in 1953. In 1986, when this information was made available to the town of Stephenville via a series of articles in the Georgian newspaper, several doubters and curiosity seekers, armed with metal detectors, swarmed over the site and located the buried equipment.|$|E

25|$|The XXIV Corps {{commanded}} by Major General John Gibbon from Major General Edward O. C. Ord's Army of the James had occupied Burkeville Junction, Virginia, a junction of the South Side Railroad and Richmond and Danville Railroad {{to the southeast}} of Rice's Station, {{on the night of}} April 5. When Longstreet arrived at Rice's Station, he learned that Ord's troops were at Burkeville Junction and ordered his men to dig in along the tracks and roads into town. During the morning of April 6, after being warned that Lee's Army was on the march, Ord and Gibbon had moved cautiously up the railroad and found Longstreet's force digging in near Rice's Station. Gibbon's skirmishers slowly formed for an attack and had a minor confrontation with the entrenched Confederates. As darkness approached and being unsure {{of the size of the}} Confederate force, Ord decided to wait for Sheridan and Meade to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> behind. The Union force suffered 66 casualties before going into bivouac as darkness approached. Exact Confederate casualties are unknown.|$|E
25|$|Nearly each summer, Maria, Alexander {{and their}} {{children}} would make an annual trip to Denmark, where her parents, King Christian IX and Queen Louise, hosted family reunions. Maria's brother, King George I, and his wife, Queen Olga, would <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> Athens with their children, and the Princess of Wales, often without her husband, would come with some of her children from England. In contrast to the tight security observed in Russia, the tsar, tsarina {{and their children}} relished the relative freedom that they could enjoy at Bernstorff and Fredensborg. The annual family meetings of monarchs in Denmark was regarded as suspicious in Europe, where many assumed they secretly discussed state affairs. Bismarck nicknamed Fredensborg “Europe’s Whispering Gallery” and accused Queen Louise of plotting against him with her children. Maria also had {{a good relationship with}} the majority of her in-laws, and was often asked to act as a mediator between them and the tsar. In the words of her daughter Olga: “She proved herself extremely tactful with her in-laws, which was no easy task”.|$|E

500|$|Burnside did {{not perform}} an {{adequate}} reconnaissance of the area, {{and he did not}} take advantage of several easy fording sites out of range of the enemy; his troops were forced into repeated assaults across the narrow bridge which was dominated by Confederate sharpshooters on high ground. By noon, McClellan was losing patience. He sent a succession of couriers to motivate Burnside to move forward. He ordered one aide, [...] "Tell him if it costs 10,000 men he must go now." [...] He increased the pressure by sending his inspector general to confront Burnside, who reacted indignantly: [...] "McClellan appears to think I am not trying my best to carry this bridge; you are the third or fourth one who has been to me this morning with similar orders." [...] The IX Corps eventually broke through, but the delay allowed Maj. Gen. A. P. Hill's Confederate division to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> Harpers Ferry and repulse the Union breakthrough. McClellan refused Burnside's requests for reinforcements and the battle ended in a tactical stalemate.|$|E
500|$|The Swiss came to {{a sudden}} halt as the columns reached the sunken {{road in front of}} the park; the depth of the road and the height of the rampart behind it—together higher than the length of the Swiss pikes—effectively blocked their advance. [...] Moving down into the road, the Swiss {{suffered}} massive casualties from the fire of d'Avalos's arquebusiers. [...] Nevertheless, the Swiss made a series of desperate attempts to breach the Imperial line. [...] Some parties managed to reach the top of the rampart, only to be met by the landsknechts, who had <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> behind the arquebusiers. [...] One of the Swiss captains was apparently killed by Frundsberg in single combat; and the Swiss, unable to form up atop the earthworks, were pushed back down into the sunken road. [...] After attempting to move forward for about half an hour, the remnants of the Swiss columns retreated back towards the main French line. [...] In the fields which they had crossed and before the rampart, they left more than 3,000 dead; among these were twenty-two captains, including both Winkelried and Albert von Stein. [...] Of the French nobles who had accompanied the Swiss assault, only Montmorency survived.|$|E

2500|$|The pilot {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Grant Rule, an Executive Producer of Countdown, it was shot in an old warehouse in Pyrmont and starred Terry Serrio from the Elks and Joy Smithers, who would later star in Bangkok Hilton mini series with Nicole Kidman.

Another link to Countdown was the briefing of songwriters by [...] co-producer Carolyn James and Graham Thorburn, who <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> producing and directing Countdown to direct four episodes. Together they negotiated a [...] "No Favoured Nations" [...] contract for songwriters to receive royalties over a limited time frame rather than ABC purchasing songs outright. This meant the music budget stretched much further, and that signed and unsigned writers received same revenue and so provided significant income to lesser-known songwriters such as David McComb of The Triffids.|$|E
2500|$|Koger and Postuma sanded Clapton's 1964 SG Standard (not, as {{is found}} in various sources, a 1961 model, and not an SG Special) and painted it with {{oil-based}} enamel paint in the [...] "gaudy dayglo colours of the day." [...] As Koger explained, [...] "the single thread running through all of my paintings is nostalgia for paradise." [...] The theme of the SG's design is [...] "good versus evil, heaven versus hell, {{and the power of}} music in the universe to rise above it all as a force of good". The centrepiece on the face is a cherub holding a triangle, surrounded by yellow stars on a celestial blue background ("a Fool hallmark"). The angel's curly hairstyle was inspired by Clapton's hairstyle at the time. Flames <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> the bottom of the guitar (the bass-bout with the volume and tone controls) and the treble point has rainbow-coloured arcs. The pick guard contains a landscape with mountains and a red sun on the horizon, a [...] "Dutch miniature" [...] representing paradise.
