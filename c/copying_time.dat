40|$|In this work, control {{strategies}} for combining two potentially powerful buffer management techniques in object bases were devised and evaluated: (1) buffer pool segmentation with segment-specific replacement criteria, and (2) dual buffering consisting of copying objects from pages into object buffers. Two diien-sions exist for exerting {{control on the}} buffer pool: (1) the <b>copying</b> <b>time</b> which determines at what time objects are copied from their memory-resident home page, and (2) the relo-cation time which determines when a (copied) object is to be transferred back to its home page. Along both dimensions, {{it is possible to}} differentiate between an eager and a lazy strategy. The extensive experimental results indicate that lazy object copying combined with an eager relocation strategy is almost always superior and significantly outperforms page-based buffering in most applications. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Speed-Accuracy Tradeoff is a {{study of}} human {{perceptions}} and reactions which can be applied {{in a variety of}} design. An examination seat can be considered as a workstation operated by an examiner which is essential in the education process. Unlike common workstations which are designed to improve the working accuracy, the examination seats are designed to minimize the copy accuracy. A major propose of examination management is to protect the academic dishonesty. A common way to reduce cheating is the seat arrangement by increasing the distance between the examination seats. However the cheating problems may occur when the large number of examiners is set in a relative small room. The arrangement of exam seats are limited by room space then the relative close distance between seats may encourage examination cheating. Based on speed-accuracy tradeoff, the distance between seats and the <b>copying</b> <b>time</b> period can be set as the speed factors or the index of difficulties which affect the copying accuracy. The results show the relationship between the copy accuracy and index of difficulties such as the examination seat distance and the looking time periods.

40|$|We are {{interested}} in implementing data structures on shared memory multiprocessors. A natural model for these machines is an asynchronous parallel machine, in which the processors are subject to arbitrary delays. On such machines, it is desirable for algorithms to be lock-free, that is, they must allow concurrent access to data without using mutual exclusion. Efficient lock-free implementations are known for some specific data structures, but these algorithms do not generalize well to other structures. For most data structures, the only previously known lock-free algorithm is due to Herlihy. Herlihy presents a simple methodology to create a lock-free implementation of a general data structure, but his approach can be very expensive. We present a technique that provides the semantics of exclusive access to data without using mutual exclusion. Using this technique, we devise the caching method, a general method of implementing lock-free data structures that is provably better than Herlihy's methodology for many well-known data structures. The cost of one operation using the caching method is proportional to T T, where T is the sequential cost of the operation. Under Herlihy's methodology, the cost is proportional to T + C, where C is {{the time needed to}} make a logical copy of the data structure. For many data structures, such as arrays and well connected pointer-based structures (e. g., a doubly linked list), the best known value for C is proportional {{to the size of the}} structure, making the <b>copying</b> <b>time</b> much larger than the sequential cost of an operation. The new method can also allow concurrent updates to the data structure; Herlihy's methodology cannot. A correct lock-free implementation can be derived from a correct sequential implementation in a straightforward manner using this method. The method is also flexible; a programmer can change many of the details of the default implementation to optimize for a particular pattern of data structure use...|$|E
