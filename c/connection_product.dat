40|$|This paper {{presents}} Shell Oil's {{approach to}} consistent, standardized finite element analyses (FEA) of threaded casing-tubing connections. The paper shows how FEA {{can provide a}} tool and methodology to reduce testing costs and cycle times to qualify <b>connection</b> <b>product</b> lines, and to determine a relative ranking of connection performance. The paper explains Shell's approach to obtaining semi-automatic mesh generation to achieve critical consistency between the mesh models of different connections. A standard suite of FEA is shown to be very useful for identifying the relative worst cases of in-print machining tolerances to use for evaluation testing of metal sealing connections. This enables qualification testing of a <b>connection</b> <b>product</b> line using the minimum number of specimens and tests. FEA also is shown to be useful to compare the relative sealing behavior of different design-types of connections. For this methodology, it is shown to be essential to use FEA as a robust tool capable o [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Given two {{analytic}} nonlinear input-output systems {{represented as}} Fliess operators, four system interconnections are considered in a unified setting: the parallel <b>connection,</b> <b>product</b> connection, cascade connection and feedback connection. In each case, the corresponding generating series is produced, when one exists, and conditions for convergence of the corresponding Fliess operator are given. In the process, an existing {{notion of a}} composition product for formal power series is generalized to the multivariable setting, and its set of known properties is expanded.

40|$|Abstract. Motivated by {{some results}} in {{classical}} differential geometry, we give a constructive procedure for {{building up a}} connection over a (twisted) tensor product of two algebras, starting from connections defined on the factors.

50|$|Founded in 2003, Delicious (then called del.icio.us) pioneered tagging and {{coined the}} term social bookmarking. Frassle, a {{blogging}} system released in November 2003, included social bookmarking elements. In 2004, as Delicious began to take off, similar services Furl, Simpy, Spurl.net, and unalog were released, along with CiteULike and Connotea (sometimes called social citation services) and the related recommendation system Stumbleupon. Also in 2004, the social photo sharing website Flickr was released, and inspired by Delicious it soon added a tagging feature. In 2006, Ma.gnolia (later renamed to Gnolia), Blue Dot (later renamed to Faves), Mister Wong, and Diigo entered the bookmarking field, and Connectbeam included a social bookmarking and tagging service aimed at businesses and enterprises. In 2007, IBM released its Lotus <b>Connections</b> <b>product.</b> In 2009, Pinboard launched as a bookmarking service with paid accounts.

One strategy for achieving this is to link the competitor’s brand with a group that the consumer does not wish to be asso-ciated with.

The implementation of capable IT structures will be a key success factor to be profitable. This paper describes the market challenges of telecommunica-tions companies and illustrates a comparison of different governance methods. It also introduces a new governance method and finally outlines which structures are appro-priate to meet the shifted market requirements. 1 Challenges for Modern Telecommunications Companies Currently, modern telecommunications companies (TelCos) undergo enormous structural changes towards IP-based telecommunications companies (IPTs). The product portfolio of IPTs contains bundles of products e. g. IP-based broadband Internet access (www), IP telephony (Voice over IP VoIP), IP television (IPTV) and premium content (e. g. movies, games, music). Many TelCos aim at scenarios, where it is possible to produce, buy and consume all <b>connection</b> <b>products</b> (IP access), all service products (www, VoIP, IPTV) and all the content anywhere and anytime online...|$|R
