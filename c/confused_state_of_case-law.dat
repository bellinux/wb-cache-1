Specifically, the Court should examine which Article III values Congress seeks to accommodate or undermine in its legislative scheme, and then weigh this impact against which values Congress hopes to serve by creating Article I courts. In other words, {{the benefits of a}} legislative court must be weighed against its effect on separation of powers and judicial independence.
