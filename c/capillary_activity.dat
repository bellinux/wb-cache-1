Consumption cooperatives operating in the mass retail which obtained generous tax treatments by Governments leaning to the left, lost most of them by centre right Governments. The cooperatives of agriculture and food processing, those of small fishing and those of production and labor, important both in the League and in CCI, were able to obtain from different Governments special privileges in the postwar period and   kept most of them also under the centre right Governments of the last period. Social cooperatives object of a special legislation in 1992 under a Government of Giulio Andreotti, a leader close to the catholic organizations, kept their preferential tax regime with all the subsequent governments.

St. -Hil., 'manaca', is a {{medicinal}} species used in Brazil, {{especially in}} central region, {{for the treatment}} of several diseases such as pain and inflammation. In this study, the methanol/aqueous phase of the ethanol extract of the leaves of 'manaca' (MAP), at the doses of 50, 150 and 500 mg/kg was used to evaluate the anti-inflammatory and/or antinociceptive effects and the possible anti-inflammatory mechanism. The antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory activities of MAP were assessed using formalin test, carrageenan-induced paw oedema. The myeloperoxidase <b>activity,</b> <b>capillary</b> permeability, leukocyte migration and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) levels were evaluated in pleural exudate. The MAP reduced the licking time only in the later phase of formalin test, and showed anti-inflammatory activity by reducing the paw oedema, migration cell, myeloperoxidase <b>activity,</b> <b>capillary</b> permeability and TNF-alpha levels.

40|$|The {{distribution}} {{and intensity of}} alkaline phosphatase deposition in 54 patients with dermatomyositis-polymyositis (PM-DM) was analyzed by the enzyme histochemical method. Increased enzyme reactivity of endomysial capillaries was found in 28 % of patients, equally distributed between adult onset PM (Group I) and PM-DM with overlap in other connective tissue diseases (Group V). Patients with high endomysial capillary reactivity (R 1 larger {{than or equal to}} 60) responded poorly to steroids, had an increased incidence of rheumatoid factor, and had less fiber degeneration/necrosis in their biopsies. Twenty-two percent of patients demonstrated prominent perimysial phosphatase reactivity localized in newly formed collagen and fibroblasts. Thirty patients (55 %) demonstrated significant numbers of alkaline-phosphatase-positive fibers positively correlated with increased fiber degeneration/necrosis, endomysial fibrosis, increased numbers of triglyceride-containing muscle fibers, and NADH tetrazolium reductase hyperreactivity. Minimal overlap between the three enzyme distribution patterns was found. Endomysial <b>capillary</b> <b>activity</b> probably represents endothelial alkaline phosphatase induction analogous to the pattern seen normally in lower mammals (rat, rabbit, guinea pig). Alkaline phosphatase fiber reactivity probably represents a particular phase in fiber regeneration/maturation especially after denervation and is positively correlated with an increased incidence of spontaneous fibrillation potentials in PM-DM...|$|E
40|$|Interior {{insulation}} systems {{influence the}} hygrothermal behaviour of a construction. Therefore, special attention is required towards its hygrothermal design. One approach, that is recently becoming increasingly popular, {{is based on}} the concept of <b>capillary</b> <b>activity.</b> By using vapour permeable hydrophilic insulation materials, liquid moisture occurring inside the construction can be transported back towards the interior surface to a certain extent, which helps to control the moisture level inside the construction beneath critical values. To determine a building component's hygrothermal performance prior to construction, detailed material properties have to be at hand. For various reasons, the common test methods to quantify liquid transport often do not deliver adequate results for the specific purpose. Therefore, a new laboratory test has been developed, that is carried out under conditions similar to real life. Under defined boundary conditions, a temperature below the dew point is applied to a laterally sealed material sample, thus generating a gradient of partial pressure. The insetting vapour diffusion into the material leads to a rising moisture content and increased relative humidity at the cold side of the material. A liquid transport reverse to vapour diffusion sets in. By performing regular gravimetric as well as nuclear magnetic resonance measurements, both water gain and distribution across the sample are monitored, serving as a basis to fine?tune the liquid transport coefficients via hygrothermal computational simulation. On the basis of a fibrous insulation material, the results of the new measuring method are demonstrated and compared to the results of conventional test methods...|$|E

The two cell types were cultured alone and in coculture in {{the presence or absence}} of lead acetate for up to 1 week. A battery of cell specific markers was used for cell identification. Newborn Sprague-Dawley rat brain astrocytes were more sensitive than bovine adrenal endothelial cells to the cytotoxic effects of 10 - 50 [mu] lead acetate, as demonstrated by a decrease in cell number and by the presence of intracellular vacuoles and detached cells. The number of astrocytes decreased to 50 % of control after 4 days in culture at a concentration of 10 [mu] lead. In contrast, a mitogenic effect of lead was observed on the endothelial cells at this concentration, with an increase in cell number to 110 % of control. In coculture, the two cell types demonstrated a distinctive cellular organization and the astrocytes were less sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of lead than when they were cultured alone. A lead-enhanced induction of a neural <b>capillary</b> enzyme <b>activity,</b> [gamma]-GTP, was detected histochemically in the coculture system. These results are consistent with a maturing of differentiating effect of the endothelial cells on the astrocytes, making them less susceptible to lead and mature enough to induce [gamma]-GTP activity in the endothelial cells...|$|R

Osteoblasts regulate the hematopoietic stem cell niche, and activation of the parathyroid hormone (PTH) receptor can {{increase the number of}} cells mobilized into the bloodstream. Methods C 57 Bl/ 6 mice were randomly assigned treatment with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), PTH, G-CSF plus PTH or saline. All mice underwent hindlimb ischemia. Blood flow was measured by laser Doppler imaging. Indices of <b>capillary</b> <b>activity</b> were determined by electron microscopy in muscle tissue. CD 34 + and Ki 67 + cells were detected and evaluated by immunofluorescence, apoptosis by TUNEL, surface antigen and endothelial progenitor cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis, and vascular endothelial growth factor- 164 and angiopoietin- 1 expression by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Frozen bone marrow sections were stained for antigen-specific B cells and fibronectin and analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Results Following mobilization induced by G-CSF treatment, mice also treated with PTH showed increases in blood flow, capillary density, nitrite/nitrate release, angiogenic factors and circulating progenitor cells, as well as reduced apoptosis, fibrosis, oxidative stress and inflammation in ischemic muscles. Furthermore, hematopoietic antigen-specific B cells in the bone marrow were also increased by G-CSF alone and in combination with PTH. Conclusions PTH might increase the efficiency of hematopoietic stem-cell-based therapy in a recognized model of peripheral ischemia.

The main symptom of chronic prostatitis is pain. In this study, {{we would like to}} explain the origin of pain in men with CP/CPPS and its therapy. Forty-five patients with CP/CPPS have received thermobalancing therapy (TT) enabled by Dr Allen’s therapeutic device (DATD) for six months as mono-therapy. The control group comprised 45 men with CP/CPPS did not receive TT. Before and after six months the National Institute of Health Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH-CPSI) scores, prostatic volume (PV) by ultrasound measurement and uroflowmetry (Qmax) were compared between the groups. Baseline characteristics have shown no difference. After TT, significant improvements in pain score (p < 0. 001), quality of life index (QoL) (p < 0. 001), decrease of PV (p < 0. 001), and increase Qmax (p < 0. 001) were determined. There were not noteworthy changes in the control group. Chronic pain due to CP/CPPS happens as a consequence and challenges at the capillary level, namely pathological <b>capillary</b> <b>activity.</b> In response to initial triggers—such as inflammation, cold, psychological and other factors—constriction and spontaneous expansion of capillaries follows, creating a continuous secondary trigger—i. e., the micro-focus of hypothermia—which in turn provokes expansion of capillaries.

The study consisted of a double-blind phase in which 20 patients were recruited and randomly treated with placebo or Pycnogenol (50 mg x 3 /day for 2 months) and an open phase in which another 20 patients were treated with Pycnogenol at the same dose schedule. In total, 40 patients with diabetes, atherosclerosis and other vascular diseases involving the retina were enrolled; 30 of them were treated with Pycnogenol and 10 with placebo. The results demonstrated a beneficial effect of Pycnogenol on the progression of retinopathy. Without any treatment (placebo) the retinopathy progressively worsened during the trial and the visual acuity significantly decreased; on the contrary, the Pycnogenol-treated patients showed no deterioration of retinal function and a significant recovery of visual acuity was also obtained. The fluorangiography showed an improvement of retinal vascularization and a reduced endothelial permeability and leakage in the Pycnogenol, but not in the placebo-treated, patients. The ophthalmoscopy and the electroretinogram (ERG) also confirmed the beneficial effects of Pycnogenol. The mechanism of action of Pycnogenol may be related to its free radical (FR) scavenging, anti-inflammatory and <b>capillary</b> protective <b>activities.</b> It has been suggested that Pycnogenol may bind to the blood vessel wall proteins and mucopolysaccharides and produce a capillary 'sealing' effect, leading to a reduced capillary permeability and oedema formation...|$|R

Adsorption of <b>capillary</b> permeability <b>activity</b> from human glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cell conditioned medium and GBM cyst fluids by anti-VEGPF antibodies demonstrated that VEGPF is secreted by GBM cells and is present in sufficient quantities in vivo to induce vascular permeability. Cloning and sequencing of polymerase chain reaction-amplified GBM and normal brain cDNA demonstrated three forms of the VEGPF coding region (567, 495, and 363 nucleotides), corresponding to mature polypeptides of 189, 165, and 121 amino acids, re-spectively. VEGPF mRNA levels in CNS tumors vs. normal brain were investigated by the RNase protection assay. Signifi-cant elevation ofVEGPF gene expression was observed in 81 % (22 / 27) of the highly vascular and edema-associated CNS neoplasms (6 / 8 GBM, 8 / 8 capillary hemangioblastomas, 6 / 7 meningiomas, and 2 / 4 cerebral metastases). In contrast, only 13 % (2 / 15) of those CNS tumors that are not commonly asso-ciated with significant neovascularity or cerebral edema (2 / 10 pituitary adenomas and 0 / 5 nonastrocytic gliomas) had signifi-cantly increased levels of VEGPF mRNA. The relative abun-dance of the forms ofVEGPF mRNA was consistent in tumor and normal brain: VEGPF 495 > VEGPF 363 > VEGPF 567.

We now report its complete amino acid sequence determined by Edman degradation and its biological effects on mouse and human vascular endothelial cells. ICPP is a homodimeric protein linked by cysteine disulfide bonds of 25115 Da revealed by mass spectrometry. Each monomer is composed of 110 amino acids including eight cysteine residues and a pyroglutamic acid at the N-terminal extremity. ICPP shares 52 % sequence identity with human VEGF but lacks the heparin binding domain and Asn glycosylation site. Besides its strong <b>capillary</b> permeability <b>activity,</b> ICPP {{was found to be}} a potent in vitro angiogenic factor when added to mouse embryonic stem cells or human umbilical vein endothelial cells. ICPP was found to be as potent as human VEGF 165 in activating p 42 /p 44 MAPK, in reinitiation of DNA synthesis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells, and in promoting in vitro angiogenesis of mouse embryonic stem cells. All these biological actions, including capillary permeability in mice, were fully inhibited by 1 microm of a new specific VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (ZM 317450) from AstraZeneca that belongs to the anilinocinnoline family of compounds. Indeed, up to a 30 times higher concentration of inhibitor did not affect platelet-derived growth factor, epidermal growth factor, FGF- 2, insulin, alpha-thrombin, or fetal calf serum-induced p 42 /p 44 MAPK and reinitiation of DNA synthesis.

Perilymphatic perfusion of the dopamine transporter inhibitors nomifensine and N-[1 -(2 -benzo[b]thiophenyl) cyclohexyl]piperidine into the cochlea reduced the spontaneous neural noise and the sound-evoked compound action potential of the auditory nerve in a dose-dependent manner, leading to both neural responses being completely abolished. We observed no significant change in cochlear responses generated by sensory hair cells (cochlear microphonic, summating potential, distortion products otoacoustic emissions) or in the endocochlear potential reflecting the functional state of the stria vascularis.

In contrast, during brief epochs of seizure activity elicited by local administration of the GABAA receptor antagonist, bicuculline, capillary RBC flow increased without pericyte-induced capillary diameter changes. Precapillary arterioles were the smallest vessels to dilate, together with penetrating and pial arterioles. Our results provide in vivo evidence that pericytes can modulate capillary blood flow in the brain, which may be important under pathological conditions. However, our data suggest that precapillary and penetrating arterioles, rather than pericytes in capillaries, are responsible for the blood flow increase induced by neural activity...|$|R
40|$|Capsule {{polysaccharide}} (CPS) {{plays an}} important role in the virulence of Streptococcus pneumoniae and is usually used as the pneumococcal vaccine target. Glycerol- 2 -phosphate is found in the CPS of S. pneumoniae types 15 A and 23 F and is rarely found in the polysaccharides of other bacteria. The biosynthetic pathway of the nucleotide-activated form of glycerol- 2 -phosphate (NDP- 2 -glycerol) has never been identified. In this study, three genes (gtp 1, gtp 2, and gtp 3) from S. pneumoniae 23 F that have been proposed to be involved in the synthesis of NDP- 2 -glycerol were cloned and the enzyme products were expressed, purified, and assayed for their respective <b>activities.</b> <b>Capillary</b> electrophoresis was used to detect novel products from the enzyme-substrate reactions, and the structure of the product was elucidated using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Gtp 1 was identified as a reductase that catalyzes the conversion of 1, 3 -dihydroxyacetone to glycerol, Gtp 3 was identified as a glycerol- 2 -phosphotransferase that catalyzes the conversion of glycerol to glycerol- 2 -phosphate, and Gtp 2 was identified as a cytidylyltransferase that transfers CTP to glycerol- 2 -phosphate to form CDP- 2 -glycerol as the final product. The kinetic parameter...|$|R

Type 2 diabetes mellitus is linked to impaired skeletal muscle glucose uptake and storage. This study aimed to investigate the fiber type distributions and the three-dimensional (3 D) architecture of the capillary network in the skeletal muscles of type 2 diabetic rats. Muscle fiber type transformation, succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) <b>activity,</b> <b>capillary</b> density, and 3 D architecture of the capillary network in the soleus muscle were determined in 36 -week-old Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats as an animal model of nonobese type 2 diabetes and age-matched Wistar (Cont) rats. Although the soleus muscle of Cont rats comprised both type I and type IIA fibers, the soleus muscle of GK rats had only type I fibers. In addition, total SDH activity in the soleus muscle of GK rats was significantly lower than that in Cont rats because GK rats had no high-SDH activity type IIA fiber in the soleus muscle. Furthermore, the capillary diameter, capillary tortuosity, and microvessel volume in GK rats were significantly lower than thos...|$|R
40|$|In Pseudomonas fluorescens CHA 0 {{and other}} {{fluorescent}} pseudomonads, the Gac/Rsm signal transduction pathway is instrumental for secondary metabolism and biocontrol of root pathogens via {{the expression of}} regulatory small RNAs (sRNAs). Furthermore, in strain CHA 0, an imbalance in the Krebs cycle can affect the strain's ability to produce extracellular secondary metabolites, including biocontrol factors. Here, we report the metabolome of wild-type CHA 0, a gacA-negative mutant, which has lost Gac/Rsm activities, and a retS-negative mutant, which shows strongly enhanced Gac/Rsm-dependent <b>activities.</b> <b>Capillary</b> electrophoresis-based metabolomic profiling revealed that the gacA and retS mutations had opposite effects on the intracellular levels {{of a number of}} central metabolites, suggesting that the Gac/Rsm pathway regulates not only secondary metabolism but also primary metabolism in strain CHA 0. Among the regulated metabolites identified, the alarmone guanosine tetraphosphate (ppGpp) was characterized in detail by the construction of relA (for ppGpp synthase) and spoT (for ppGpp synthase/hydrolase) deletion mutants. In a relA spoT double mutant, ppGpp synthesis was completely abolished, the expression of Rsm sRNAs was attenuated, and physiological functions such as antibiotic production, root colonization, and plant protection were markedly diminished. Thus, ppGpp appears to be essential for sustaining epiphytic fitness and biocontrol activity of strain CHA 0...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe surface {{grafting}} {{of cellulose}} nanocrystals (CNC) {{is a valuable}} tool to increase opportunities for their application. This work had several goals designed to improve CNC: reduction of hornification, increased re-dispersibility after CNC drying, and tuning of the surface graft to enhance the adsorption of particular molecules. To achieve this, the CNC surfaces were modified chemically with aromatic surface grafts using widely employed methods: the creation of urethane linkages, silylation and esterification. Even a low degree of grafting sufficed to increase water contact angles {{to as much as}} 96 °. The analysis of water sorption isotherms showed that at high water <b>activities,</b> <b>capillary</b> condensation could be suppressed and hysteresis was decreased. This indicates that hornification was significantly suppressed. However, although the contact angles increased, the water sorption isotherms were changed only slightly because of reduced hysteresis. The grafts were not able to shield the surface from water vapour sorption. A comparison of the sorption isotherms of anisole and cyclohexane, sorbates with a similar surface area, showed that the sorption of anisole was three times higher than that of cyclohexane. The specific sorption of aromatic molecules was achieved and the most efficient methodology was the esterification of CNC with carboxylic acids containing a flexible linker between the aromatic moiety and ester bond...|$|R

This research on the mapping and quantification of business generated in the sugarcane chain in 2008 for the first time gives the scale of the entire sugarcane productive chain in Brazil. The sector now shows the numbers that indicate the industry's role in building the country's GDP, as well as in job creation, tax generation, and the distribution (<b>capillary)</b> of economic <b>activities.</b> By applying the method Strategic Management of Agro-Systems (GESIS), developed by the first author, Professor Marcos Fava Neves, coordinator of the Marketing & Strategic Projects and Research Center, USP (MARKESTRAT), {{it was found that the}} sugarcane sector GDP is around $ 28. 1 billion USD, equivalent to almost 2 % of the Brazilian GDP or almost all of the income generated in a year in a country like Uruguay. The majority of the industry's inputs are local, explaining its favorable trade balance situation. A series of new products has become increasingly more important and a major transformation is going on in this sector that has one of the oldest and, at the same time, most modern plants with regard to clean energy on the planet. chain mapping, chain quantification, agro-industry system, sugar cane sector, ethanol, sugar, Crop Production/Industries, Industrial Organization,...|$|R
40|$|Objective. Although {{findings}} of nail-fold capillary changes and reduced {{red blood cell}} velocity in SSc patients are well established, studies in adult-onset DM patients are scarce. Our objective {{was to assess the}} changes and red blood cell velocity in finger nail-fold capillaries using nail-fold video capillaroscopy (NVC) in patients with adult-onset DM. Methods. This study included 50 patients with adult-onset DM and 20 healthy subjects. A semi-quantitative rating scale was used to score capillaroscopy changes. Red blood cell velocity was evaluated using frame-to-frame determination of the position of capillary plasma gaps. Results. Thirty-seven (74 %) patients showed the scleroderma NVC pattern. Patients with the scleroderma pattern exhibited elevated serum creatine kinase levels more frequently and increased visual analogue scale of muscle disease activity. Scores of loss of capillaries were associated with muscle and global disease activity, whereas scores of haemorrhages were associated with skin disease activity. However, NVC findings were not significantly associated with lung involvement. The scores of irregularly enlarged capillaries, haemorrhages and loss of capillaries were reduced after stabilization of disease activity by treatment. The mean red blood cell velocity was not significantly reduced in DM patients compared with healthy controls and was not changed by treatment. Conclusion. Our results suggest that changes in nail-fold <b>capillaries</b> reflect disease <b>activity</b> in DM. Furthermore, the differences found in red blood cell velocity may reflect somewhat distinct microcirculation injuries in DM and SSc...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe chorioallantoic {{membrane}} resides adjacent {{to either the}} inner surface of the egg shell or uterine epithelium in oviparous and viviparous reptiles, respectively. Chorionic cells face the shell or uterine epithelium and transport calcium to underlying embryonic <b>capillaries.</b> Calcium transport <b>activity</b> of the chorioallantois increases {{in the final stages}} of development coincident with rapid embryonic growth and skeletal ossification. We excised embryos from viviparous Zootoca vivipara females at a stage prior to significant calcium accumulation and incubated them ex utero with and without calcium to test the hypothesis that chorioallantois calcium transport activity depends on developmental stage and not calcium availability. We measured calcium uptake by monitoring incubation media calcium content and chorioallantois expression of calbindin-D 28 K, a marker for transcellular calcium transport. The pattern of calcium flux to the media differed by incubation condition. Eggs in 0 mM calcium exhibited little variation in calcium gain or loss. For eggs in 2 mM calcium, calcium flux to the media was highly variable and was directed inward during the last 3 days of the experiment such that embryos gained calcium. Calbindin-D 28 K expression increased under both incubation conditions but was significantly higher in embryos incubated with 2 mM calcium. We conclude that embryos respond to calcium availability, yet significant calcium accumulation is developmental stage dependent. These observations suggest the chorioallantois exhibits a degree of functional plasticity that facilitates response to metabolic or environmental fluctuations...|$|R
40|$|Controlling the {{dissemination}} of malaria requires {{the development of new}} drugs against its etiological agent, a protozoan of the Plasmodium genus. Angiotensin II and its analog peptides exhibit activity against the development of immature and mature sporozoites of Plasmodium gallinaceum. In this study, we report the synthesis and characterization of angiotensin II linear and cyclic analogs with anti-plasmodium activity. The peptides were synthesized by a conventional solid-phase method on Merrifield's resin using the t-Boc strategy, purified by RP-HPLC and characterized by liquid chromatography/ESI (+) MS (LC-ESI(+) /MS), amino acid analysis, and <b>capillary</b> electrophoresis. Anti-plasmodium <b>activity</b> was measured in vitro by fluorescence microscopy using propidium iodine uptake as an indicator of cellular damage. The activities of the linear and cyclic peptides are not significantly different (p[*]<[*] 0. 05). Kinetics studies indicate that the effects of these peptides on plasmodium viability overtime exhibit a sigmoidal profile and that the system stabilizes after a period of 1 [*]h for all peptides examined. The results were rationalized by partial least-square analysis, assessing the position-wise contribution of each amino acid. The highest contribution of polar amino acids and a Lys residue proximal to the C-terminus, {{as well as that of}} hydrophobic amino acids in the N-terminus, suggests that the mechanism underlying the anti-malarial activity of these peptides is attributed to its amphiphilic character.
