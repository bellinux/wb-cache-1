40|$|Abstract: Risk and {{reliability}} analysis is presently being performed {{in almost all}} fields of engineering depending upon the specific field and its particular area. Probabilistic risk analysis (PRA), also called quantitative risk analysis (QRA) is a <b>central</b> feature of <b>hydraulic</b> engineering structural design. Actually, probabilistic methods, which consider resistance and load parameters as random variables, are more suitable than conventional deterministic methods to determine the safety level of a hydraulic structure. In fact, hydraulic variables involved in plunge pools, such as discharge, flow depth, and velocity, are stochastic in nature, which may be represented by relevant probability distributions. Therefore, the optimal design of a plunge pool needs to be modelled by probabilistic methods. The main topic {{of this paper is}} concerned with the reliability-based assessment of the geometry of the plunge pool downstream of a ski jump bucket. Experimental data obtained from a model of a flip bucket spillway has been used to develop a number of equations for the prediction of scour geometry downstream from a flip bucket spillway of a large dam structure. The accuracy of the developed equations was examined both through statistical and experimental procedures with satisfactory results.

Despite its importance, no standard widely-applied methodology exists to assess susceptibility of soil to piping. The pinhode test, originally developed by Sherard et al. in 1976 is an empirical test based on the qualitative evalution of the dispersibility (colloidal erodibility) of compacted fined-grained soils. This study aims at evaluating the pinhole test for assessing the susceptibility of soils to piping and establishes recommendations to use the pinhole test, and assesses the effects of hydraulic head, water quality and soil moisture content on the hydrological and erosion responses.

40|$|Culverts {{are common}} means to convey {{flow through the}} roadway system for small streams. In general, larger flows and road {{embankment}} heights entail the use of multibarrel culverts (a. k. a. multi-box) culverts. Box culverts are generally designed to handle events with a 50 -year return period, and therefore convey considerably lower flows much of the time. While there are no issues with conveying high flows, many multi-box culverts in Iowa pose a significant problem related to sedimentation. The highly erosive Iowa soils can easily lead to the situation {{that some of the}} barrels can silt-in early after their construction, becoming partially filled with sediment in few years. Silting can reduce considerably the capacity of the culvert to handle larger flow events. Phase I of this Iowa Highway Research Board project (TR- 545) led to an innovative solution for preventing sedimentation. The solution was comprehensively investigated through laboratory experiments and numerical modeling aimed at screening design alternatives and testing their hydraulic and sediment conveyance performance. Following this study phase, the Technical Advisory Committee suggested to implement the recommended sediment mitigation design to a field site. The site selected for implementation was a 3 -box culvert crossing Willow Creek on IA Hwy 1 W in Iowa City. The culvert was constructed in 1981 and the first cleanup was needed in 2000. Phase II of the TR 545 entailed the monitoring of the site with and without the selfcleaning sedimentation structure in place (similarly with the study conducted in laboratory). The first monitoring stage (Sept 2010 to December 2012) was aimed at providing a baseline for the operation of the as-designed culvert. In order to support Phase II research, a cleanup of the IA Hwy 1 W culvert was conducted in September 2011. Subsequently, a monitoring program was initiated to document the sedimentation produced by individual and multiple storms propagating through the culvert. The first two years of monitoring showed inception of the sedimentation in the first spring following the cleanup. Sedimentation continued to increase throughout the monitoring program following the depositional patterns observed in the laboratory tests and those documented in the pre-cleaning surveys. The second part of Phase II of the study was aimed at monitoring the constructed self-cleaning structure. Since its construction in December 2012, the culvert site was continuously monitored through systematic observations. The evidence garnered in this phase of the study demonstrates the good performance of the self-cleaning structure in mitigating the sediment deposition at culverts. Besides their beneficial role in sediment mitigation, the designed self-cleaning structures maintain a clean and clear area upstream the culvert, keep a healthy flow through the <b>central</b> barrel offering <b>hydraulic</b> and aquatic habitat similar with that in the undisturbed stream reaches upstream and downstream the culvert. It can be concluded that the proposed self-cleaning structural solution “streamlines” the area upstream the culvert in a way that secures the safety of the culvert structure at high flows while producing much less disturbance in the stream behavior compared with the current constructive approaches...|$|R

In fact, hydraulic variables involved in hydraulic structures, such as discharge, flow depth and velocity, are stochastic in nature, which maybe represented by relevant probability distributions. Therefore, the optimal design of hydraulic structures needs to be modelled by probabilistic methods. Reliability analysis methods are being adopted for use to develop risk management programs. Implementing the programs will ensure that safety is maintained to a robust and acceptable level. Any simple reliability analysis should include the following steps: The main work carried out relates to three different subjects in the general area of dam structures failure. These included the probabilistic methods work on: o Geometry of plunge pool downstream of flip bucket spillway o Evaluation of superelevation in open channel bends o Hydrodynamic loading on buildings by floods 1. Geometry of plunge pool downstream of flip bucket spillway Extreme scouring can gradually undermine the foundations of structures such as spillway and body dams and the areas downstream of dams. Extensive plunge pools downstream of flip bucket spillway structures, which are caused by jets of different configurations, form an important field of research. The plunge pool mechanism is more complex because of difficulties arising from the modelling of bed rock and sediment load flow {{in and around the}} scour hole caused by the jet effect of the flow downstream of flip bucket spillway. The experimental study of plunge pool has been limited to the consideration of variables involved in the plunge pool geometry. The reliability-based assessment of the geometry of the plunge pool downstream of a flip bucket spillway. Experimental data obtained from a model of a flip bucket spillway has been used to develop a number of equations for the prediction of scour geometry downstream from a flip bucket spillway of a large dam structure. The accuracy of the developed equations was examined both through statistical and experimental procedures with satisfactory results. 2. Evaluation of superelevation in open channel bends The so-called centrifugal force caused by flow around a curve results in a rise in the water surface at the outside wall and a depression of the surface along the inside wall. This phenomenon is called superelevation. The problems associated with flow through open channel bends deserve special attention in hydraulic engineering. Water surface slopes have been frequently reported to be a function of the curvature. But due to the difficulties in operation, the theoretical basis of superelevation has been discussed in depth in the literature. Furthermore, experience indicates that existing theory does not lead to good results at the present status. Superelevation in the Ziaran Flume (Iran) has led to severe erosion of the bank and has undermined the structure. Therefore, this study aims to cast light on the cause of overtopping by superelevation. By means of direct observation on the flume’s hydraulic performance, during full discharge, and from generalization of the field data, a more reliable prediction method of the magnitude of superelevation has become possible. The probabilistic analysis is shown to have several advantages in comparison with deterministic analysis methods. 3. Hydrodynamic loadings on buildings by floods Assessing the vulnerability of buildings in flood-prone areas is a key issue when evaluating the risk induced by flood events, particularly because of its proved direct influence on the loss of life during catastrophes. Hydrodynamic loads are caused by water flowing along, against and around a structural element or system. Hydrodynamic loads are basically of the lateral type and are related to direct impulsive loads by the moving mass of water, and to drag forces as the water flows around the obstruction. Where application of hydrodynamic loads is required, the loads shall be calculated or estimated by recognized engineering and reliable methods. A comprehensive methodology for risk assessment of buildings subjected to flooding is nevertheless still missing. A new set of experiments has been performed in this thesis with the aim of shedding more light on dynamics of flood induced loads and their effects on buildings with state of the art benchmarks. In this research, an overview is given of flood induced load on buildings, the new experimental work is then presented, together with results from preliminary analysis. Initial results suggest that use of existing prediction methods might be unsafe and that impulsive loading might be critical for both the assessment of the vulnerability of existing structures and the design of new flood-proof buildings. The research presented in this thesis is focused on developing and applying probabilistic design, safety, system reliability and risk based design in the field of hydraulic structures design in the open channel bends, plunge pool downstream of flip bucket spillway and dam break analysis. Probabilistic design approach is a powerful tool in reliability assessment of civil hydraulic engineering. Uncertainty and risk are <b>central</b> features of <b>hydraulic</b> engineering. Hydraulic design is subject to uncertainties due to the randomness of natural phenomena, data sample limitations and errors, modelling reliability and operational variability. Uncertainties can be measured in terms of the probability density function, confidence interval, or statistical moment such as standard deviation or coefficient of variation of the stochastic parameters. Outcomes from this thesis are beneficial to the design of hydraulic structures in many ways; not only minimizing cost, but also educating and providing valuable knowledge for structural operators. Probabilistic methods {{and reliability}} analysis can increase the quality and value of the achievements compared to traditional dam engineering approaches. Since the goal is to avoid the dam failures by reducing risk to almost zero with optimum cost, dam safety risk analysis has a key role in modern dam safety programs.

40|$|Lubricated {{friction}} {{issues are}} <b>central</b> to all <b>hydraulic</b> actuation systems undergoing motion and any in-depth {{understanding of the}} nature of lubricated friction will advance future component design. The classic friction models of hydraulic actuation systems under steady state conditions and their dependency on velocity and temperature have been studied extensively over the past years. A model which is commonly employed to represent the characteristics of friction is that of Stribeck in which the dependency of the friction force is based on velocity alone. However, experimentally, it has been found that lubricated friction is dependent on acceleration. Thus, the Stribeck model can be considered as a subset of a dynamic friction model in which acceleration is zero. Thus, it can be concluded that the Stribeck model is best applied to cases when the change rate of the velocities is very small. This thesis considers the dependency of lubricated friction on acceleration when pressure and temperature changes are relatively constant. As such, the basic hypothesis for this study was proposed as follows: “Lubricated friction in hydraulic actuation systems is not only a function of velocity, but is also a function of both velocity and acceleration”. In this thesis several terms are defined which facilitate the description under which friction models are developed. For example, the term non-steady state friction is used to account for the effect of acceleration on lubricated friction force while in motion. Further, the lubricated friction models are divided into two groups: steady state friction models and non-steady state friction models. Nonlinear friction modeling and measuring methods are reviewed in this dissertation. This review also includes nonlinear lubricated friction modeling in hydraulic actuation systems. A conclusion from this review was that limited research has been done in documenting and explicitly demonstrating the role of acceleration on lubricated friction. The research first introduced a methodology to experimentally measure friction as a function of acceleration and to demonstrate this dependency in the form of a three dimensional graph. A novel technique to experimentally obtain data for the lubricated friction model was introduced. This allowed the lubricated friction forces to be measured as a function of velocity in a continuous manner, but with acceleration being held constant as a family parameter. Two different valve controlled hydraulic actuation systems (VCHAS) were studied under a wide variety of accelerations at constant temperature and pressure. To enable repeatable data collection for the different friction conditions and to accommodate for the effect of hysteresis, a periodic parabolic displacement waveform was chosen which enabled the acceleration to be a family parameter. The second phase of the research introduced a method of representing the data (lubricated friction model) in a lookup table form. The relationship of lubricated friction (in this work, pressure differential, ΔP across the actuator) as a function of velocity and acceleration was presented in a unique semi-empirical 2 D lookup table (2 D LUT). Limitations of this experimental approach were identified, but the dependency on acceleration was clearly established. The last phase of the study implemented this 2 D LUT model into a practical software model of an actuator and demonstrated its accuracy when compared to its experimental counterpart. The semi-empirical model (2 D LUT) was experimentally verified by implementing the semi-empirical and Stribeck models into a real time simulation of an actuator and by comparing the experimental outputs against simulated outputs for a common sinusoidal input. A sinusoidal actuator displacement input was chosen to test the simulations as it was not used in the collection of the original data. The output of the simulation was compared to the experimental results and it was evident that for the range in which data could be collected in developing the model, the proposed 2 D LUT model predicted an output that was superior to a model which used a standard Stribeck model. It was concluded that the semi-empirical model could be integrated into a simulation environment and predict outputs in a superior fashion when compared to the Stribeck friction model. Thus it was concluded that the stated hypothesis is consistent with the experimental evidence shown by all hydraulic actuators considered. Further, it was also observed that the traditional Stribeck form (steady state dynamic friction) does change with increasing acceleration to the point that the standard breakaway friction almost disappears. It is evident that the 2 D LUT is a viable tool for modeling the non-steady state friction of hydraulic actuation systems. The semi-empirical 2 D LUT model so developed is a more global representation of hydraulic actuator lubricated friction. In this research, only linear hydraulic actuators were considered; however, the novel nonlinear semi-empirical 2 D LUT lubricated friction model can be applied to any actuator (linear and rotary) and provides a new way in which the dynamic friction can be viewed and modeled...|$|R

40|$|The Rosie mobile worksystem is a robot {{that is on}} {{the cutting}} edge of {{hazardous}} environment robotics. It is a heavy-duty hydraulic robot designed for nuclear reactor decontamination and dismantlement. The robot consists of a wheeled platform containing a <b>central</b> <b>hydraulic</b> power supply powered by an electric tether, four independently steerable wheels, and a heavy-duty crane/ manipulator. The hydraulic wheel actuator subsystem has been determined to be a vital component of the mobile platform through reliability analysis. Our research into analyzing this robot's reliability through the technique of analytical redundancy (AR) will help provide the Department of Energy (DOE) with a more complete and effective set of tests for monitoring and diagnostics of the Rosie system. In this paper, we discuss the derivation through AR of a suite of model based tests for the default sensor package for one of Rosie's wheel actuators. AR allows us to exploit the sensor information of the sensors values and the system model to derive tests of the consistency of the sensor data. Some of these tests are comparison of the actual system response to control inputs to predicted response indicated by the model, the other tests uncovered by the AR analysis reflect higher order state interdependencies. These tests and their use in monitoring and diagnostics for Rosie are detailed and examined in depth. This work is also an interesting example of the application of model based techniques for an important class of practical systems. National Science FoundationSandia National Laborator...|$|E
40|$|A {{triaxial}} injector is {{a single}} bi-propellant injection element located {{at the center of}} the injector body. The injector element consists of three nested, hydraulic swirl injectors. A small portion of the total fuel is injected through the <b>central</b> <b>hydraulic</b> injector, all of the oxidizer is injected through the middle concentric hydraulic swirl injector, and the balance of the fuel is injected through an outer concentric injection system. The configuration has been shown to provide good flame stabilization and the desired fuel-rich wall boundary condition. The injector design is well suited for preburner applications. Preburner injectors operate at extreme oxygen-to-fuel mass ratios, either very rich or very lean. The goal of a preburner is to create a uniform drive gas for the turbomachinery, while carefully controlling the temperature so as not to stress or damage turbine blades. The triaxial injector concept permits the lean propellant to be sandwiched between two layers of the rich propellant, while the hydraulic atomization characteristics of the swirl injectors promote interpropellant mixing and, ultimately, good combustion efficiency. This innovation is suited to a wide range of liquid oxidizer and liquid fuels, including hydrogen, methane, and kerosene. Prototype testing with the triaxial swirl injector demonstrated excellent injector and combustion chamber thermal compatibility and good combustion performance, both at levels far superior to a pintle injector. Initial testing with the prototype injector demonstrated over 96 -percent combustion efficiency. The design showed excellent high -frequency combustion stability characteristics with oxygen and kerosene propellants. Unlike the more conventional pintle injector, there is not a large bluff body that must be cooled. The absence of a protruding center body enhances the thermal durability of the triaxial swirl injector. The hydraulic atomization characteristics of the innovation allow the design to be rapidly scaled from small in-space applications [500 - 5, 000 lbf (2. 2 22. 2 kN) ] to large thrust engine applications [80, 000 lbf (356 kN) and beyond]. The triaxial injector is also less sensitive to eccentricities, manufacturing tolerances, and gap width of many traditional coaxial and pintle injector designs. The triaxial-injector injection orifice configuration provides for high injection stiffness. The low parts count and relatively large injector design features are amenable to low-cost production...|$|E
40|$|This report {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} landing gear actuation system design on more-electric aircraft (MEA). Firstly, information about more-electric aircraft and more-electric actuators was gathered and sorted. Current more-electric landing actuation system applications and researches were also summarized. Then several possible more-electric landing gear actuation concepts were identified. To evaluate these concepts, the case study method has been used. A concept aircraft “MRT 7 -T”, which has similar maximum takeoff weight to that of Boeing 787, has been chosen as the design case. Systems of different configurations and architectures were designed for this aircraft. In {{the end of this}} study, a comparison between different more-electric landing gear actuation systems, and also with traditional <b>central</b> <b>hydraulic</b> system was made. The best concept was proposed. More-electric actuation technology has made considerable progress in the last two decades. However, most of the applications and researches have focused on flight control actuation and brakes. Using more-electric drives for landing gear actuation has been well known to be difficult, for the reason of massive power needs and difficulties in achieving redundancy levels. Famous more-electric research projects like POA and Power-By-Wire only gave recommendation of using electro-hydrostatic actuators (EHA) in landing gear actuation. And no further information is available to the public. In this study, DHS (distributed hydraulic system), EHA (electro-hydrostatic actuator) and EMA (electro-mechanical actuator) were identified as candidate solutions. Design requirements such as retraction time, load and redundancy levels were derived through analysis. As a unique feature, landing gear kinematics concepts were also subject to optimization. Various kinematics concepts were proposed and analyzed in detail, to provide favorable loading and geometrical conditions for the systems. Kinematics design guidelines were built through discussion. Different motors such as AC induction motor, BDCM (brushless DC motor) and PMSM (permanent magnetic synchronous motor) were evaluated for use. Different system architectures were also explored. The multi-discipline optimization method has been extensively used in the design process of the systems. Firstly, each node of the actuation systems was optimized. Then optimizations were made to the systems. Performances of each system were analyzed in several aspects such as weight, power, reliability and maintenance. Comparison of different systems was made through scoring method. The results suggested that DHS, EHA and EMA are all applicable for landing gear actuation. And isolated EHA is the best...|$|E
