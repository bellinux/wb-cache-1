50|$|Palmer {{experimented with}} about 8 {{different}} hang glider versions and their wings were mostly 90 degree swept back wings. His smallest glider weighed 24 lb, {{and had a}} surface area of 205 sq ft. The flexibility in the frame caused no performance problems. His first and largest hang glider was about 45 pounds and had a surface area of 342 sq ft. Palmer explored control of his several versions of hang gliders by using different control frames: pilot {{in front of the}} <b>control</b> <b>frame,</b> pilot behind the <b>control</b> <b>frame,</b> and <b>control</b> <b>frame</b> in front of the pilot in a swing seat, which inadvertently approximated the George A.

30|$|The {{protection}} {{offered by}} IEEE 802.11 security protocols such as WEP, WPA, and WPA 2 does not govern wireless <b>control</b> <b>frames.</b> The <b>control</b> <b>frames</b> are transmitted in clear-text form, {{and there is}} no way to verify their validity by the recipients. The flaw of <b>control</b> <b>frames</b> can be exploited by attackers to carry out DoS attacks and directly disrupt the availability of the wireless networks. In this work, focusing on resource limitation in the wireless networks, a new lightweight noncryptographic security solution is proposed to prevent wireless DoS attacks. In order to prove the ability of the proposed model and quantify its performance and capabilities, a simulation topology is developed, and extensive experiments are carried out. Based on the acquired results, it is concluded that the model successfully prevents wireless DoS attacks, while the security cost is not remarkable compared to the model achievements.|$|R
50|$|Another {{feature of}} L2 {{is the ability}} for an L2 {{transmitter}} to know whether there is buffer space for the data frame at the receiving end. This again relies on L2 <b>control</b> <b>frames</b> (AFC) which allow a receiver to tell the peer's transmitter how much buffer space is available. This allows the receiver to pause the transmitter if needed, thus avoiding receive buffer overflow. <b>Control</b> <b>frames</b> are unaffected by L2 flow control: they can be sent {{at any time and}} the L2 receiver is expected to process these at the speed at which they arrive.|$|R

Thomas Purcell and Mike Burns would use the triangle <b>control</b> <b>frame.</b> Much later Dickenson would do similarly as he fashioned an airframe to fit on the by-then standard four boom stiffened Rogallo airfoil. Dickenson's model made use of a single hang point and an A frame: He started with a framed Rogallo wing airfoil with a U-frame (later an A-frame control bar) to it; it was composed of a keel, leading edges, a cross-bar and a fixed <b>control</b> <b>frame.</b> Weight-shift (mass-shift) was also used to control the glider.

30|$|F 2 -MAC {{protocol}} (Chao et al. 2011) {{presents an}} efficient channel sensing and access scheme for an ad-hoc CRN. F 2 -MAC employs a five-way handshake to exchange control information. Similar to traditional RTS and CTS frames, {{two types of}} <b>control</b> <b>frames</b> are delivered through a dedicated control channel. Three more control messages, data channel idle (DCI), DCIACK and ready-to-vacate (RTV), are delivered through data channels. However, five <b>control</b> <b>frames</b> and a certain waiting time before transmitting in the F 2 -MAC protocol results in the highest overheads. The maximum number of <b>frames</b> exchanged as <b>control</b> information is four for many CR-MAC protocols. Exchanging five <b>control</b> <b>frames</b> will not only consume more mobile energy but also CR nodes may miss the rare opportunity to transmit. Energy-efficient communication via wireless interfaces optimization usually requires some collaborative mechanism between operating system, applications, and network infrastructure (Fatima and Shah 2015). Moreover, F 2 -MAC does not specify whether the dedicated control channel is GCCC or non-GCCC.|$|R

40|$|Weighted and <b>controlled</b> <b>frames</b> {{have been}} {{introduced}} recently to improve the numerical efficiency of iterative algorithms for inverting the frame operator. In this paper we develop systematically these notions, including their mutual relationship.

We also make the connection with frame multipliers. Finally we analyze weighted frames numerically. First we investigate three possibilities for finding weights in order to tighten a given frame, i. e., decrease the frame bound ratio. Then we examine Gabor frames and how well the canonical dual of a weighted frame is approximated by the inversely weighted dual frame.
