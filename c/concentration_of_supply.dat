The Egyptian leadership and the Soviet advisers were disappointed {{that the war was}} about to end without them having used the most sophisticated weapon the Soviets had supplied Egypt. As a result, in the hours before the ceasefire took into effect, the Soviet ambassador to Egypt called the Soviet foreign minister and asked for his permission to launch missile strikes against Israel. Unable to reach him, he turned to the Soviet minister of defence, who approved the attack. In the last few minutes before the ceasefire took into effect, the Soviet teams managed to fire three missiles, without Egyptian knowledge or approval. Each of the three Scud missiles carried 2 tons of explosives. One of the missiles exploded near Arish, from which Israel received its aid from the United States, and the other two were fired at the Israeli bridgehead at Deversoir, on the western side of the canal. One of them hit a <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> trucks and killed seven soldiers from the 401st Brigade of the 600th Division. The explosion left a crater of 15 meter in diameter and a depth of four meters. Later on, Sadat claimed in his book that he commanded the forces to fire the Scuds at the Israeli bridgehead: [...] "I wanted Israel to know that we have such weapons and that {{we would be able to}} use them later on in the war".|$|E

First of all, at wholesale level, production {{is characterized by}} very low <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply,</b> due {{to the presence of}} many small-medium wineries with a small market shares. At retail level, however, the marketing strategy allows a few large brands to be leaders in the LSRT segments. Other competitors generally choose different retail trade scales, preferring to market their products through the HoReCa channel, or through specialized and selected wine shops. This {{can be explained by the}} fact that LSRT channel requires high supply potential at a relatively low price, and big companies can thus benefit from economies of scale and higher stock capacity. Instead, medium and small companies mainly try to allocate their products in the channels that allow a better unitary profit.|$|E

40|$|The private rental sector (PRS) {{is growing}} in many {{advanced}} economies due to declining home ownership and retrenchment in social housing. This paper examines changes in the PRS {{in the context of}} housing market change and ongoing urbanisation processes.

Increasing demand from higher and lower income households has occurred alongside increasing <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> in mid-market segments. The paper discusses possible explanations of this mismatch. It suggests that middle/higher income households rent through a mixture of constraint and choice in areas {{with a high level of}} amenity, adding to understanding of gentrification of inner-city areas. Urban restructuring, evident in increased land values in inner areas of large cities, has resulted in limited 'filtering down' of older housing into low-rent private rental stock and a concentration of investment in supply in mid-market segments with greatest prospects for resale and rental...|$|E
30|$|Despite {{the fact}} that {{disintermediation}} decreases the number of vertical steps in the supply chain, and supplier diversification decreases exposure to common risks (Babich et al. 2007; Wan and Beil 2009), quality control and safety assurance may become more challenging in the new, more fluid environment of production networks. This new challenge may prove particularly demanding for Japanese automakers with extremely slim procurement departments. Our finding that car manufacturers seek hub suppliers across keiretsu boundaries resonates with the concerns voiced by a white paper from the Japanese Ministry of Trade, Economy, and Industry (METI 2011). This white paper, which was published soon after the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011, reported that manufacturing procurement in Japan has acquired a “diamond structure,” characterized by the <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> links on certain key original producers of parts and materials. The implication of the new macro-structure, which resulted from the micro-processes analyzed in this paper, is that negative temporary shocks can now propagate throughout entire supply networks regardless of keiretsu boundaries when such suppliers suffer damage.|$|E

Both aspects are constantly spurred by the rapid changes in demand and the diversity of supply, and the intrinsic importance that tourism has gained in individual lifestyles and in national economies.

Mixed approaches that combine top-down governance models with bottom-up collaborative strategies and policy networks are considered able to provide resilient decision making systems able to cope with unexpected challenges or conflict situations.

The latter has been well placed to gain a well-defined identity in the possible scenarios of development and integration of the agricultural sector into the regional economy and beyond. In several instances, the increase in production might attest to the successful implementation of a certification program of the areas of land long organic by nature rather than the reversal of the agricultural system. It is the case of Albania that might be able to adopt the certification procedures for the recognition of organic products in order to attain or better boost the economic worthiness of production. One of the critical points that presents themselves in the Albanian organic agriculture has been depicted from the inadequacy of the evaluation of the products. The operating lack of the commercialization chain, the missing integration of the supply chain and the weak links among manufacturers, processors/exporters and consumers make the Albanian producers face an ever-decreasing profit once they return to organic products. On the other hand this is going to favour traders and exporters who stand to gain more in terms of the margin of profit. The existing organic agricultural systems are characterized by small-sized and fragmented structures, far from being organized in groups and not integrated into the supply chain.

The efficient use of resources is a fundamental issue for sustainability assessment, entailing and affecting environmental, economic and social aspects. It {{is not surprising that}} they hold a central role in many different sustainability assessment frameworks. In conventional life cycle assessment (LCA), natural resources are considered as one area of protection (AoP). It is well recognized that the typical approach of this AoP starts from the provisioning function of resources, but natural resources however are also dealt with in totally different frameworks. If one starts from an ecological point of view, provisioning services is only one role natural resources fulfill next to regulating, cultural and supporting functions, all captured by the Ecosystems Services framework.

40|$|Due to {{the rapid}} growth in demand for certain materials, {{compounded}} by political risks associated with the geographical concentration of the supply of them, a shortage of these materials could be a potential bottleneck to the deployment of low-carbon energy technologies. In order to assess whether such shortages could jeopardise {{the objectives of the}} EU’s Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET-Plan), an improved understanding of these risks is vital. In particular, this report examines the use of metals in the six low-carbon energy technologies of SET-Plan, namely: nuclear, solar, wind, bioenergy, carbon capture and storage (CCS) and electricity grids. The study looks at the average annual demand for each metal for the deployment of the technologies in Europe between 2020 and 2030. The demand of each metal is compared to the respective global production volume in 2010. This ratio (expressed as a percentage) allows comparing the relative stress that the deployment of the six technologies in Europe is expected to create on the global supplies for these different metals. The study identifies 14 metals for which the deployment of the six technologies will require 1 % or more (and in some cases, much more) of current world supply per annum between 2020 and 2030. These 14 significant metals, in order of decreasing demand, are tellurium, indium, tin, hafnium, silver, dysprosium, gallium, neodymium, cadmium, nickel, molybdenum, vanadium, niobium and selenium. The metals are examined further in terms of the risks of meeting the anticipated demand by analysing in detail the likelihood of rapid future global demand growth, limitations to expanding supply in the short to medium term, and the <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> and political risks associated with key suppliers. The report pinpoints 5 of the 14 metals to be at high risk, namely: the rare earth metals neodymium and dysprosium, and the by-products (from base metals) indium, tellurium and gallium. The report explores a set of potential mitigation strategies, ranging from expanding European output, increasing recycling and reuse to reducing waste and finding substitutes for these metals in their main applications. A number of recommendations are provided which include: •	ensuring that materials used in significant quantities are included in the Raw Materials Yearbook proposed by the Raw Materials Initiative ad hoc Working Group, •	the publication of regular studies on supply and demand for critical metals, •	efforts to ensure reliable supply of ore concentrates at competitive prices, •	promoting R&D and demonstration projects on new lower cost separation processes, particularly those from by-product or tailings containing rare earths, •	collaborating with other countries/regions with a shared agenda of risk reduction, •	raising awareness and engaging in an active dialogue with zinc, copper and aluminium refiners over by-product recovery, •	creating incentives to encourage by-product recovery in zinc, copper and aluminium refining in Europe, •	promoting the further development of recycling technologies and increasing end-of-life collection, •	measures for the implementation of the revised WEEE Directive, and •	investing broadly in alternative technologies. It is also recommended that a similar study should be carried out to identify the metal requirements and associated bottlenecks in other green technologies, such as electric vehicles, low-carbon lighting, electricity storage and fuel cells and hydrogen.

For example, US corporations have control over food production by subcontracting smaller farmers, which allows them to participate and profit without taking on the risks of farming, such as weather and disease. Food regimes are the result of “political struggles among contending social groups” for control over how food production is framed and conceptualized, according to McMichael. The corporate food regime came about with the neoliberal economic theory which is motivated by efficiency and trade liberalization, and states that nations should focus their efforts and resources on producing goods and services where they have an advantage relative to other nations (that is, goods that they are best at producing), as cited by Philip McMichael. The corporate food regime has existed for only the last 100 years, as compared to the millennia prior to industrialization and the Green Revolution.|$|R

40|$|Firms {{exporting}} {{their goods}} and services abroad face risks that {{are different from the}} risks faced by firms who do not engage in international trade. It is common practice to allow the receiving party to pay in instalments. The exporting firm faces credit risk, but as in most countries, Dutch firms can insure such risks. To some extent, such export credit risks can be insured on the private market. There are private insurance companies that insure short-term risks. On the Dutch market, Gerling NCM, Coface, and Euler-Cobac operate as insurers. The Dutch government acts as reinsurer of long-term export credit risks (three years or more). A reinsurance agreement exists with Gerling NCM for this purpose. Short-term and medium-term contracts can be reinsured in the private reinsurance market. In almost all OECD countries export credits are officially supported. This can take the form of direct finance (e. g. US, Canada) or the government can insure the export credit risks (directly as for example in the United Kingdom or indirectly by reinsuring a private insurer such as in the Netherlands). The role of this government-backed insurance on exports to certain countries is important as experience has shown that the private market is very reluctant to cover long term export risks to non-OECD countries. Considering the government involvement in this market, one can raise the following questions: 1. What are the key determinants of export credit risk insurability by the private market? 2. Which export credit risks can be covered by the private market? In the report, an answer to these questions is provided by means of a literature review and an extensive field study, with special emphasis {{on the role of the}} Dutch government as a reinsurer of export credit risks. The main conclusions are as follows. Economic theory predicts that firms that operate risk averse are willing to pay an insurance premium. Large (say listed) firms operate at a relative low degree of risk aversion. These firms can use internal risk hedging as a useful alternative to private export credit risk insurance. Medium-sized firms are more likely to apply for export credit risk insurance, while small firms probably face problems (since for this group there is only one supplier of insurance active in the Dutch market). Small firms do not have the knowledge to hedge export risks differently than by export credit insurance in the Netherlands. They lack the resources and knowledge to have access to the international insurance markets. Moreover, the duration of the coverage is often not as long as exporting companies would like (this is experienced by both large and small companies). This is partly due to reinsurance restrictions faced by the insurance companies. A related problem to insurability is the high market <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply.</b> Market dominance leads to monopolistic rent extraction. In the case of the Netherlands this might apply to Gerling NCM. On the other hand relationship insurance seems to be a popular model. In our field study, firms point at a preference for long-lasting relations. Most exporters seem to have low price elasticity of insurance demand. Economic theory predicts moral hazard to be an important determinant of insurability. The issue of moral hazard, though recognized by insurance companies, does not dominate the perception of insurability. The price of export credit insurance is largely determined by macroeconomic risk factors, such as political risk. This leads us to the second main issue: what role should the government play on the market for export credit risk insurance and which risks should be covered by the governement? We argue the following: ? In markets with asymmetric information it is likely that profitable projects will be denied insurance. If the government considers export growth as one of its main goals, it should interfere in the market by lowering relative prices; ? The government is equipped to hedge intertemporal risks due to a low social cost of capital. In our field study some market participants point at the responsibility the government should take, especially in the case of small exporting companies; ? The government should offer opportunities to hedge macroeconomic risks, such as political/country risk. These risk types are seen as the main drivers of export insurance premium contracts; ? Moral hazard of public (re-) insurance might be a problem, but is not perceived as such in our field study by (re) insurance companies operating in the private market. The relation between the Dutch government and Gerling NCM is different, though. Gerling NCM retains no risk on its public account, and the government cannot end its relation with Gerling NCM. Therefore, moral hazard could be a problem in this insurer/reinsurer relation; ? Besides direct interference, the government should take care of prudential regulation of the insurance sector. Monopolistic behaviour should be avoided by appropriate regulation. Especially contracts that have a large geographical nature are subject to at least monopolistic competition. Clients who are not satisfied with the monopoly supplier should be able to meet other suppliers (at home or abroad). This holds especially for long-term contracts. In all cases the government should operate in a prudential way. No involvement may prevent profitable projects from being insured, too much involvement may crowd out the market for private export credit risk insurance. Finally, based on the research, we recommend the following. ? It seems that the industrial organization of the market for export credit risks insurance is an important issue. Some firms that were interviewed mentioned the large number of alternatives in the London market. This reinforces the idea of increasing competition in the Netherlands. ? There is a large barrier to entry on the Dutch market: an insurance company needs extensive datasets to go into business. Old firms have a competitive advantage by controlling such databases. Perhaps public data collection (at EU level) could mitigate this problem. ? Especially smaller firms are not aware of possibilities on the international market for export credit risk insurance. A national campaign explaining and informing about alternative risk products (not necessarily insurance products) will help exporters to find a better solution for reducing the risks they are exposed to.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to examine the {{consequences}} for the Canarian banana sector of the obligation to be integrated in producer’s organisations as a result of the coming into force of the European Common Market Organisation for bananas. Firstly, the successive modifications to the legislation referring to banana producer’s organisations are presented both at EU and Canarian level. And secondly, the effects that the application of this regulation has had on the commercial structures of the Canarian banana sector are analysed. A <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> the <b>supply</b> and that has generated more results in cost savings that in sales management.

Tissue content of potassium increased with increasing supply in both species. Roots, excised from these plants, {{were placed in}} a solution of 137 -Cs-labelled caesium chloride for 15 min to determine uptake potential. There were clear negative relationships between the rate of uptake of 137 Cs by both species and (a) the <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> potassium <b>supplied</b> and (b) plant tissue potassium concentrations. With Agrostis, there was an approximately ten-fold difference in 137 Cs uptake between potassium-deficient and optimum plants; with Calluna, it was approximately eight-fold.
