50|$|In {{keeping with}} its {{cost-cutting}} philosophy, Canon designed the AE-1 {{to use a}} significant amount of structural plastic for a lighter and cheaper camera at the expense of being less impact resistant. Canon went to great effort to disguise the use of plastic - the injection-molded acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) for the top panel finished with ether satin <b>chrome</b> (<b>or</b> black enameled) to give {{the look and feel of}} metal. The bottom plate were made of brass and then finished with satin <b>chrome</b> (<b>or</b> black enameled). Extensive use of electronics also allowed simpler modular internal construction instead of mechanical linkages. Five major and 25 minor internal modules reduced the individual parts count by over 300. Modular construction, in turn, allowed automated production lines in order to reduce cost. Unfortunately, cost concerns also resulted in the use of plastic in some of the moving/operating mechanisms.|$|R
