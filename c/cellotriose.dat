40|$|Two {{forms of}} Ruminococcus flavefaciens FD- 1 endoglucanase B, {{a member of}} {{glycoside}} hydrolase family 44, one with only a catalytic domain {{and the other with}} a catalytic domain and a carbohydrate binding domain (CBM), were produced. Both forms hydrolyzed cellotetraose, cellopentaose, cellohexaose, carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), birchwood and larchwood xylan, xyloglucan, lichenan, and Avicel but not cellobiose, <b>cellotriose,</b> mannan, or pullulan. Addition of the CBM increased catalytic efficiencies on both CMC and birchwood xylan but not on xyloglucan, and it decreased rates of cellopentaose and cellohexaose hydrolysis. Catalytic efficiencies were much higher on xyloglucan than on other polysaccharides. Hydrolysis rates increased with increasing cellooligosaccharide chain length. Cellotetraose hydrolysis yielded only <b>cellotriose</b> and glucose. Hydrolysis of cellopentaose gave large amounts of cellotetraose and glucose, somewhat more of the former than of the latter, and much smaller amounts of cellobiose and <b>cellotriose.</b> Cellohexaose hydrolysis yielded much more cellotetraose than cellobiose and small amounts of glucose and <b>cellotriose,</b> along with a low and transient amount of cellopentaose...|$|E

Aryl-β-glucosidase activity was detected only for whole cells and disrupted cells, suggesting that these activities are cell bound.

40|$|When glucose or {{cellobiose}} {{was provided}} as an energy source for Fibrobacter succinogenes, {{there was a}} transient accumulation (as much as 0. 4 mM hexose equivalent) of cellobiose or <b>cellotriose,</b> respectively, in the growth medium. Nongrowing cell suspensions converted cellobiose to <b>cellotriose</b> and longer-chain cellodextrins, {{and in this case}} the total cellodextrin concentration was as much as 20 mM (hexose equivalent). Because cell extracts of glucose- or cellobiose-grown cells cleaved cellobioise and <b>cellotriose</b> by phosphate-dependent reactions and glucose 1 -phosphate was an end product, it appeared that cellodextrins were being produced by a reversible phosphorylase reaction. This conclusion was supported by the observation that the ratio of cellodextrins to cellodextrins with one greater hexose [n/(n + 1) ] was approximately 4, a value similar to the equilibrium constant (Keq) of cellobiose phosphorylase (J. K. Alexander, J. Bacteriol. 81 : 903 - 910, 1961). When F. succinogenes was grown in a cellobiose-limited chemostat, cellobiose and <b>cellotriose</b> could both be detected, and the ratio of <b>cellotriose</b> to cellobiose was approximately 1 to 4. On the basis of these results, cellodextrin production is an equilibrium (mass action) function and not just an artifact of energy-rich cultural conditions. Cellodextrins could not be detected in low-dilution-rate, cellulose-limited continuous cultures, but these cultures had a large number of nonadherent cells. Because the nonadherent cells had a large reserve of polysaccharide and were observed at all stages of cell division, it appeared that they were utilizing cellodextrins as an energy source for growth.

30|$|Concerning {{the final}} {{hydrolysis}} products, Spr CelA from S. proteamaculans {{can be classified}} as an endo-β- 1, 4 -glucanase that undergoes exo-β- 1, 4 -glucanase activity due to its ability to release cello oligosaccharides, cellobiose and glucose from CMC. Other endo-β- 1, 4 -glucanases that release cello oligosaccharides, cellobiose and glucose from CMC as the main hydrolysis products have been reported previously. For instance, the E 4 - 90 endo-β- 1, 4 -cellulase from Thermomonospora fusca releases mainly cellobiose, <b>cellotriose,</b> cellotetraose and glucose with CMC as the substrate, suggesting that this enzyme is involved in endo- and exo-activity (Irwin et al., 1998), and the endoglucanase Cel 9 A from Thermobifida fusca releases mainly cellobiose, with some minor products e.g., cellopentaose, cellotetraose, <b>cellotriose</b> with CMC as the substrate (Chir et al. 2011). In contrast, the endocellulase Cel 5 A from Cellvibrio mixtus releases mainly cellobiose and <b>cellotriose</b> with no evidence of glucose formation during the early stage (Voget et al. 2006).|$|E
40|$|The {{chemical}} degradations of highly-purified <b>cellotriose,</b> cellotetraose, and cellopentaose in H 2 O 2 and NaOH {{media were}} studied, respectively. The degradation products {{were analyzed by}} HPLC, FTIR, and GC-MS techniques. The results show that for the three oligosaccharides the main oxidative degradation products are 2, 3 -dihydroxy-butanedioic acid, 2 -keto-gluconic acid, glucopyranose, D-glucose, D-gluconic acid, and cellooligosaccharides with lower DP. A small amount of arabinose is formed during the oxidation of <b>cellotriose.</b> The main alkaline degradation products for the three oligomers include 3 -deoxy-isosaccharinic acid- 1, 4 -lactone and 3 -deoxy-hexonic acid- 1, 4 -lactone. Arabinose coumpounds {{are found to be}} an accidental degradation product of <b>cellotriose.</b> Finally, the possible formation mechanisms are proposed, including 2, 3 -dihydroxy-butanedioic acid, 2 -keto-gluconic acid, D-gluconic acid, arabinose, 3 -deoxy-isosaccharinic acid- 1, 4 -lactone, and 3 -deoxy-hexonic acid- 1, 4 -lactone. The radical attack from H 2 O 2 is probably at the glycosidic linkage, resulting in the formation of a series of degradation products.

40|$|The {{fermentation}} and aerobic metabolism of cellodextrins by 14 yeast {{species or}} strains was monitored. When grown aerobically, Candida wickerhamii, C. guilliermondii, and C. molischiana metabolized cellodextrins of {{degree of polymerization}} 3 to 6. C. wickerhamii and C. molischiana also fermented these substrates, while C. guilliermondii fermented only cellodextrins of degree of polymerization {{less than or equal}} to 3. Debaryomyces polymorphus, Pichia guilliermondii, Clavispora lusitaniae, and one of two strains of Kluyveromyces lactis metabolized glucose, cellobiose, and <b>cellotriose</b> when grown aerobically. These yeasts also fermented these substrates, except for K. lactis, which fermented only glucose and cellobiose. The remaining species/strains tested, K. lactis, Brettano-myces claussenii, B. anomalus, K. dobzhanskii, Rhodotorula minuta, and Dekkera intermedia, both fermented and aerobically metabolized glucose and cellobiose. Crude enzyme preparations from all 14 yeast species or strains were tested for ability to hydrolyze <b>cellotriose</b> and cellotretose. Most of the yeasts produced an enzyme(s) capable of hydrolyzing <b>cellotriose.</b> However, with two exceptions, R. minuta and P. guilliermondii, only the yeasts that metabolized cellodextrins of degree of polymerization greater than 3 produced an enzyme(s) that hydrolyzed cellotretose...|$|E
40|$|The wood decay {{basidiomycete}} Phanerochaete chrysosporium {{produces a}} variety of cellobiohydrolases belonging to glycoside hydrolase (GH) families 6 and 7 {{in the presence of}} cellulose. However, no inducer of the production of these enzymes has yet been identified. Here, we quantitatively compared the transcript levels of the genes encoding GH family 6 cellobiohydrolase (cel 6 A) and GH family 7 cellobiohydrolase isozymes (cel 7 A to cel 7 F/G) in cultures containing glucose, cellulose, and cellooligosaccharides by real-time quantitative PCR, in order to evaluate the transcription-inducing effect of soluble sugars. Upregulation of transcript levels in the presence of cellulose compared to glucose was observed for cel 7 B, cel 7 C, cel 7 D, cel 7 F/G, and cel 6 A at all time points during cultivation. In particular, the transcription of cel 7 C and cel 7 D was strongly induced by <b>cellotriose</b> or cellotetraose. The highest level of cel 7 C transcripts was observed in the presence of cellotetraose, whereas the highest level of cel 7 D transcripts was found in the presence of <b>cellotriose,</b> amounting to 2. 7 × 106 and 1. 7 × 106 copies per 105 actin gene transcripts, respectively. These numbers of cel 7 C and cel 7 D transcripts were higher than those in the presence of cellulose. In contrast, cellobiose had a weaker transcription-inducing effect than either <b>cellotriose</b> or cellotetraose for cel 7 C and had little effect in the case of cel 7 D. These results indicate that <b>cellotriose</b> and cellotetraose, but not cellobiose, are possible natural cellobiohydrolase gene transcription inducers derived from cellulose...|$|E
40|$|Streptomyces reticuli has an {{inducible}} ATP-dependent uptake system specific for cellobiose and <b>cellotriose.</b> By reversed genetics a {{gene cluster}} encoding {{components of a}} binding protein-dependent cellobiose and <b>cellotriose</b> ABC transporter was cloned and sequenced. The deduced gene products comprise a regulatory protein (CebR), a cellobiose binding lipoprotein (CebE), two integral membrane proteins (CebF and CebG), and the NH 2 -terminal part of an intracellular β-glucosidase (BglC). The gene for the ATP binding protein MsiK is not linked to the ceb operon. We have shown earlier that MsiK is part of two different ABC transport systems, one for maltose and one for cellobiose and <b>cellotriose,</b> in S. reticuli and Streptomyces lividans. Transcription of polycistronic cebEFG and bglC mRNAs is induced by cellobiose, whereas the cebR gene is transcribed independently. Immunological experiments showed that CebE is synthesized during growth with cellobiose and that MsiK is produced {{in the presence of}} several sugars at high or moderate levels. The described ABC transporter is the first one of its kind and is the only specific cellobiose/cellotriose uptake system of S. reticuli, since insertional inactivation of the cebE gene prevents high-affinity uptake of cellobiose...|$|E
40|$|Alkaline endo- 1, 4 -beta-D-glucanase was {{secreted}} by Bacillus pumilus {{grown in}} submerged culture {{on a combination}} of oat spelt xylan and corn starch as carbon sources. The enzyme was purified to homogeneity by Sephacryl S- 200 and Q-Sepharose column chromatography. The protein corresponded to molecular mass and pi values of 67 kDa and 3. 7, respectively. The enzyme was optimally active at pH 7. 0 - 8. 0 and 60 degrees C and retained 50 % of its optimum activity at pH 12. The most notable characteristic of the endoglucanase was its high stability up to pH 12 for 20 h at 30 degrees C. The enzyme hydrolyzed carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) and cello-oligosaccharides but was inactive on cellobiose, <b>cellotriose,</b> Avicel, xylan, 4 -nitrophenyl-beta-D-glucoside, 4 -nitrophenyl-beta-D-cellobioside, and 4 -nitrophenyl-beta-D-xyloside. Analysis of reaction mixtures by HPLC revealed that the enzyme produced almost exclusively <b>cellotriose</b> when acted on CMC and appeared to hydrolyze cello-oligosaccharides by successively releasing <b>cellotriose.</b> The use of 4 -methylumbelliferyl cello-oligosaccharides and the determination of bond cleavage frequency revealed that the enzyme preferentially hydrolyzed the third glycosidic bond adjacent to the glycon. The enzyme mediated a decrease in the viscosity of CMC associated with a release of only small amounts of reducing sugar.

40|$|An enzyme active against {{carboxymethyl}} cellulose (CMC) was purified from the stationary-phase-culture supernatant of Clostridium josui grown {{in a medium}} containing ball-milled cellulose. The purification {{in the presence of}} 6 M urea yielded homogeneous enzyme after an approximately 50 -fold increase in specific activity and a 13 % yield. The enzyme had a molecular mass of 45 kilodaltons. The optimal temperature and pH of the enzyme against CMC were 60 degrees C and 6. 8, respectively. The enzyme hydrolyzed cellotetraose, cellopentaose, and cellohexaose to cellobiose and <b>cellotriose</b> but did not hydrolyze cellobiose or <b>cellotriose.</b> A microcrystalline cellulose, Avicel, was also hydrolyzed significantly, but the extent of hydrolysis was remarkably less than that of CMC. On the basis of these results, the enzyme purified here is one of the endo- 1, 4 -beta-glucanases.

We have performed a characterisation of the enzymatic properties of the less well-studied endoglucanases Cel 12 A (EG III), Cel 45 A (EG V) and the catalytic core of Cel 45 A. For comparison, Cel 5 A and Cel 7 B {{were included in the}} study. Adsorption studies on microcrystalline cellulose (Avicel) and phosphoric acid swollen cellulose (PASC) showed that Cel 5 A, Cel 7 B, Cel 45 A and Cel 45 Acore adsorbed to these substrates. In contrast, Cel 12 A adsorbed weakly to both Avicel and PASC. The products formed on Avicel, PASC and carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) were analysed. Cel 7 B produced glucose and cellobiose from all substrates. Cel 5 A and Cel 12 A also produced <b>cellotriose,</b> in addition to glucose and cellobiose, on the substrates. Cel 45 A showed a clearly different product pattern by having cellotetraose as the main product, with practically no glucose and cellobiose formation. The kinetic constants were determined on <b>cellotriose,</b> cellotetraose and cellopentaose for the enzymes. Cel 12 A did not hydrolyse <b>cellotriose.</b> The kCat values for Cel 12 A on cellotetraose and cellopentaose were significantly lower compared with Cel 5 A and Cel 7 B. Cel 7 B was the only endoglucanase which rapidly hydrolysed <b>cellotriose.</b> Cel 45 Acore did not show activity on any of the three studied cello-oligosaccharides. The four endoglucanases' capacity to hydrolyse @b-glucan and glucomannan were studied. Cel 12 A hydrolysed @b-glucan and glucomannan slightly less compared with Cel 5 A and Cel 7 B. Cel 45 A was able to hydrolyse glucomannan significantly more compared with @b-glucan. The capability of Cel 45 A to hydrolyse glucomannan was higher than that observed for Cel 12 A, Cel 5 A and Cel 7 B.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the characterization of}} an intracellular β-glucosidase enzyme BGLII (Cel 1 a) and its gene (bgl 2) from the cellulolytic fungus Trichoderma reesei (Hypocrea jecorina). The expression pattern of bgl 2 {{is similar to that}} of other cellulase genes known from this fungus, and the gene would appear to be under the control of carbon catabolite repression mediated by the cre 1 gene. The BGLII protein was produced in Escherichia coli, and its enzymatic properties were analyzed. It was shown to be a specific β-glucosidase, having no β-galactosidase side activity. It hydrolyzed both <b>cellotriose</b> and cellotetraose. BGLII exhibited transglycosylation activity, producing mainly <b>cellotriose</b> from cellobiose and sophorose and cellobiose from glucose. Antibodies raised against BGLII showed the presence of the enzyme in T. reesei cell lysates but not in the culture supernatant.

40|$|Ruminococcus albus has {{the ability}} to intracellularly degrade cello-oligosaccharides {{primarily}} via phosphorolysis. In this study, the enzymatic characteristics of R. albus cellodextrin phosphorylase (RaCDP), which is a member of glycoside hydrolase family 94, was investigated. RaCDP catalyzes the phosphorolysis of <b>cellotriose</b> through an ordered ‘bi bi’ mechanism in which <b>cellotriose</b> binds to RaCDP before inorganic phosphate, and then cellobiose and glucose 1 -phosphate (Glc 1 P) are released in that order. Among the cello-oligosaccharides tested, RaCDP had the highest phosphorolytic and synthetic activities towards cellohexaose and cellopentaose, respectively. RaCDP successively transferred glucosyl residues from Glc 1 P to the growing cello-oligosaccharide chain, and insoluble cello-oligosaccharides comprising a mean of eight residues were produced. Sophorose, laminaribiose, β- 1, 4 -xylobiose, β- 1, 4 -mannobiose and cellobiitol served as acceptors for RaCDP. RaCDP had very low affinity for phosphate groups in both the phosphorolysis and synthesis directions. A sequence comparison revealed that RaCDP has Gln at position 646 where His is normally conserved in the phosphate binding sites of related enzymes. A Q 646 H mutant showed approximately twofold lower apparent Km values for inorganic phosphate and Glc 1 P than the wild-type. RaCDP has Phe at position 633 corresponding to Tyr and Val in the + 1 subsites of cellobiose phosphorylase and N,N′-diacetylchitobiose phosphorylase, respectively. A F 633 Y mutant showed higher preference for cellobiose over β- 1, 4 -mannobiose as an acceptor substrate in the synthetic reaction than the wild-type. Furthermore, the F 633 Y mutant showed 75 - and 1100 -fold lower apparent Km values for inorganic phosphate and Glc 1 P, respectively, in phosphorolysis and synthesis of <b>cellotriose...</b>|$|E

Ball-milled straw induced endoglucanase, beta-glucosidase, beta-xylanase and beta-xylosidase. Carboxymethylcellulose, cellotetraose and <b>cellotriose</b> induced cellulolytic enzymes specifically whereas cellobiose acted as inducer for beta-glucosidase only. <b>Cellotriose</b> and cellotetraose induced beta-glucosidase, but only partially induced endoglucanase. Hemicellulose (in {{the form of}} xylan) and xylobiose induced only beta-xylanase and beta-xylosidase.

40|$|During {{the growth}} of Clostridium cellulolyticum in {{chemostat}} cultures with ammonia as the growth-limiting nutrient, as much as 30 % of the original cellobiose consumed by C. cellulolyticum was converted to <b>cellotriose,</b> glycogen, and polysaccharides regardless of the specific growth rates. Whereas the specific consumption rate of cellobiose and of the carbon flux through glycolysis increased, the carbon flux through the phosphoglucomutase slowed. The limitation of the path through the phosphoglucomutase had a great effect on the accumulation of glucose 1 -phosphate (G 1 P), the precursor of <b>cellotriose,</b> exopolysaccharides, and glycogen. The specific rates of biosynthesis of these compounds are important since as much as 16. 7, 16. 0, and 21. 4 % of the specific rate of cellobiose consumed by the cells could be converted to <b>cellotriose,</b> exopolysaccharides, and glycogen, respectively. With the increase of the carbon flux through glycolysis, the glucose 6 -phosphate (G 6 P) pool decreased, whereas the G 1 P pool increased. Continuous culture experiments showed that glycogen biosynthesis was associated with rapid growth. The same result was obtained in batch culture, where glycogen biosynthesis reached a maximum during the exponential growth phase. Glycogen synthesis in C. cellulolyticum was also not subject to stimulation by nutrient limitation. Flux analyses demonstrate that G 1 P and G 6 P, connected by the phosphoglucomutase reaction, constitute important branch points for the distribution of carbon fluxes inside and outside cells. From this study {{it appears that the}} properties of the G 1 P-G 6 P branch points have been selected to control excretion of carbon surplus and to dissipate excess energy, whereas the pyruvate-acetyl coenzyme A branch points chiefly regulate the redox balance of the carbon catabolism as was shown previously (E.

40|$|Streptomyces scabies is an {{economically}} important plant pathogen well-known for damaging root and tuber crops by causing scab lesions. Thaxtomin A is the main causative agent responsible for the pathogenicity of S. scabies and cello-oligosaccharides are environmental triggers that induce the production of this phytotoxin. How cello-oligosaccharides are sensed or transported in order to induce the virulent behavior of S. scabies? Here we report that the cellobiose and <b>cellotriose</b> binding protein CebE, and MsiK, the ATPase providing energy for carbohydrates transport, are the protagonists of the cello-oligosaccharide mediated induction of thaxtomin production in S. scabies. Our work provides the first example where the transport and not the sensing of major constituents of the plant host is the central mechanism associated with virulence of the pathogen. Our results allow to draw a complete pathway from signal transport to phytotoxin production where {{each step of the}} cascade is controlled by CebR, the cellulose utilization regulator.

40|$|A 160 kDa enzyme with β-glucosidase {{activity}} was purified from the midgut Gland {{of the land}} crab Gecarcoidea natalis. The enzyme was capable of releasing glucose progressively from cellobiose, <b>cellotriose</b> or cellotetraose. Although β-glucosidases (EC 3. 2. 1. 21) have some activity towards substrates longer than cellobiose, the enzyme was classified as a glucohydrolase (EC 3. 2. 1. 74) as it had a preference for larger substrates (cellobiose<cellotriose=cellotetraose). It was able to synthesise some cellotetraose by the transglycosylation of smaller substrates – another common feature of glucohydrolases. The interaction between the glucohydrolase described here and the endo-β- 1, 4 -glucanases described previously for G. natalis provides a complete model for cellulose hydrolysis in crustaceans and possibly in other invertebrates. After mechanical fragmentation by the gastric mill, multiple endo-β- 1, 4 -glucanases would initially cleave β- 1, 4 -glycosidic bonds within native cellulose, releasing small oligomers, including cellobiose, <b>cellotriose</b> and cellotetraose. The glucohydrolase would then attach to these oligomers, progressively releasing glucose. The glucohydrolase might also attach directly to crystalline cellulose to release glucose from free chain ends. This two-enzyme system differs from the traditional model, which suggests that total cellulose hydrolysis requires the presence an endo-β- 1, 4 -glucanse, a cellobiohydrolase and a β-glucosidas...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{optimization}} of capillary electrophoresis {{conditions for the}} separation of unreacted substrate and products (cellobiose, glucose) generated by the enzymatic cleavage of <b>cellotriose</b> with enzyme cellobiase. The optimal separation electrolyte was {{shown to be a}} solution containing 30 mmol·dm- 3 sodium hydroxide with addition of 1. 0 mmol·dm- 3 sodium phosphate and 1. 0 mmol·dm- 3 sodium phosphate dibasic (pH = 12. 38). With this separation electrolyte calibration curves and repeatability were measured and the limits of detection and quantification were determined. The relative standard deviations of peak areas ranged up to 6. 1 % and they did not exceed 0. 2 % for the migration time. Limits of detection were determined in the range from 0. 020 to 0. 026 mmol·dm- 3 and limits of quantification from 0. 066 mmol·dm- 3 to 0. 085 mmol·dm- 3. Subsequently the enzyme reaction was monitored in offline setup. Furthermore, the offline procedure was automated and the relative standard deviation of cellodextrines after 30 minutes of hydrolysis was ranging up to 13. 0 % of glucose and <b>cellotriose</b> and 3. 0 % cellobiose using this automated method, which makes it suitable for semiquantitative and comparative measurements. The last part of the experiment was to carry out enzymatic reaction in online setup [...] . ...|$|E

40|$|Piriformospora indica, an {{endophytic}} root-colonizing fungus, efficiently promotes {{plant growth}} and induces resistance to abiotic stress and biotic diseases. The fungal cell wall extract induces cytoplasmic calcium [Ca 2 +]cyt elevation in host plant roots. Here, {{we show that}} an elici-tor-active cell wall moiety, released by P. indica into the medium, is <b>cellotriose</b> (CT). CT in-duces a mild defense-like response including the production of reactive oxygen species, changes in membrane potentials and the expression of genes involved in growth regulation and root development. CT based [Ca 2 +]cyt elevation in Arabidopsis roots does not require BAK 1 coreceptor, or the putative Ca 2 + channels TPC 1, GLR 3. 3, - 2. 4 and - 2. 5 and operates synergistically with the elicitor chitin. We identified an ethylmethane-sulfonate-induced mu-tant ([Ca 2 +]cyt elevation mutant, cycam) impaired in response to CT, cellooligomers (n = 2, 4 - 7), but not to chitooligomers (n = 4 - 8) in roots. The mutant contains a single nucleotide ex-change in the gene encoding for a poly(A) ribonuclease (AtPARN, At 1 g 55870) which de-grades poly(A) tails of specific mRNAs. The wild-type PARN cDNA, expressed {{under the control of}} a 35 S promoter, complements the mutant phenotype.

40|$|Cellodextrins, the {{incomplete}} {{hydrolysis products}} from insoluble cellulose, are accessible as a carbon source to certain {{members of the}} human gut microbiota, such as Bifidobacterium breve UCC 2003. Transcription of the cldEFGC gene cluster of B. breve UCC 2003 was shown to be induced upon growth on cellodextrins, implicating this cluster in the metabolism of these sugars. Phenotypic analysis of a B. breve UCC 2003 ::cldE insertion mutant confirmed that the cld gene cluster is exclusively required for cellodextrin utilization by this commensal. Moreover, our results suggest that transcription of the cld cluster is controlled by a LacI-type regulator encoded by cldR, located immediately upstream of cldE. Gel mobility shift assays using purified CldR(His) (produced by the incorporation of a His(12) -encoding sequence into the 3 ' end of the cldC gene) indicate that the cldEFGC promoter is subject to negative control by CldR(His), which binds to two inverted repeats. Analysis by high-performance anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC-PAD) of medium samples obtained during growth of B. breve UCC 2003 on a mixture of cellodextrins revealed its ability to utilize cellobiose, <b>cellotriose,</b> cellotetraose, and cellopentaose, with <b>cellotriose</b> apparently representing the preferred substrate.

40|$|A {{genomic library}} of Pseudomonas fluorescens subsp. cellulosa DNA was {{constructed}} in pUC 18 and Escherichia coli recombinants expressing 4 -methylumbelliferyl beta-D-cellobioside-hydrolysing activity (MUCase) were isolated. Enzyme produced by MUCase-positive clones did not hydrolyse either cellobiose or <b>cellotriose</b> but converted cellotetraose into cellobiose and cleaved cellopentaose and cellohexaose, producing a mixture of cellobiose and <b>cellotriose.</b> There was no activity against CM-cellulose, insoluble cellulose or xylan. On this basis, the enzyme is identified as an endo-acting cellodextrinase and is designated cellodextrinase C (CELC). Nucleotide sequencing of the gene (celC) which directs the synthesis of CELC revealed an open reading frame of 2153 bp, encoding a protein of Mr 80, 189. The deduced primary sequence of CELC was confirmed by the Mr of purified CELC (77, 000) and by the experimentally determined N-terminus of the enzyme which was identical with residues 38 - 47 of the translated sequence. The N-terminal region of CELC showed strong homology with endoglucanase, xylanases and an arabinofuranosidase of Ps. fluorescens subsp. cellulosa; homologous sequences included highly conserved serine-rich regions. Full-length CELC bound tightly to crystalline cellulose. Truncated forms of celC from which the DNA sequence encoding the conserved domain had been deleted, directed the synthesis of a functional cellodextrinase that did not bind to crystalline cellulose. This {{is consistent with the}} N-terminal region of CELC comprising a non-catalytic cellulose-binding domain which is distinct from the catalytic domain. The role of the cellulose-binding region is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Common scab disease on {{root and}} tuber plants {{is caused by}} Streptomyces scabies and related species which use the {{cellulose}} synthase inhibitor thaxtomin A as main phytotoxin. Thaxtomin production is primarily triggered by the import of cello-oligosaccharides. Once inside the cell, {{the fate of the}} cello-oligosaccharides is dichotomized into i) fueling glycolysis with glucose for the saprophytic lifestyle through the action of β-glucosidase(s) (BG), and ii) eliciting the pathogenic lifestyle by inhibiting the CebR-mediated transcriptional repression of thaxtomin biosynthetic genes. Here we investigated the role of scab 57721 encoding a putative BG (BglC) in the onset of the pathogenicity of S. scabies. Enzymatic assays showed that BglC was able to release glucose from cellobiose, <b>cellotriose</b> and all other cello-oligosaccharides tested. Its inactivation resulted in a phenotype opposite to what was expected as we monitored reduced production of thaxtomin when the mutant was cultivated on media containing cello-oligosaccharides as unique carbon source. This unexpected phenotype could be attributed to the highly increased activity of alternative intracellular BGs, probably as a compensation of bglC inactivation, which then prevented cellobiose and <b>cellotriose</b> accumulation to reduce the activity of CebR. In contrast, when the bglC null mutant was cultivated on media devoid of cello-oligosaccharides it instead constitutively produced thaxtomin. This observed hypervirulent phenotype does not fit with the proposed model of the cello-oligosaccharide-mediated induction of thaxtomin production and suggests that the role of BglC in the route to the pathogenic lifestyle of S. scabies is more complex than currently presented...|$|E
40|$|In {{the course}} of a study on the {{bacterial}} degradation of plant cell wall polysaccharides, we observed that growing cells of motile cellulolytic bacteria accumulated, without attachment, near cellulose fibers present in the cultures. Because it seemed likely that the accumulation was due to chemotactic behavior, we investigated the chemotactic responses of one of the above-mentioned bacteria (Cellulomonas gelida ATCC 488). We studied primarily the responses toward cellobiose, which is the major product of cellulose hydrolysis by microorganisms, and toward hemicellulose hydrolysis products. We found that cellobiose, <b>cellotriose,</b> D-glucose, xylobiose, and D-xylose, as well as other sugars that are hemicellulose components, served as chemoattractants for C. gelida, as determined by a modification of Adler's capillary assay. Competition and inducibility experiments indicated that C. gelida possesses at least two types of separately regulated cellobiose chemoreceptors (Cb 1 and cellobiose, <b>cellotriose,</b> xylobiose, and D-glucose, and it is constitutively synthesized. The presence in C. gelida of a constitutive response toward cellobiose and of at least two distinct cellobiose chemoreceptors has implications for the survival of this cellulolytic bacterium in nature. A possible mechanism for cellobiose-mediated bacterial chemotaxis toward cellulose is proposed. We suggest that, in natural environments, motile cellulolytic bacteria migrate toward plant materials that contain cellulose and hemicellulose by swimming up cellobiose concentration gradients and/or concentration gradients of other sugars (e. g., xylobiose, D-xylose, and D-glucose) formed by enzymatic hydrolysis of plant cell wall polysaccharides...|$|E
