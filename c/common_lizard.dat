5|$|There are no snakes in Ireland {{and only}} one species of reptile (the <b>common</b> <b>lizard)</b> is native to the island. Extinct species include the Irish elk, the great auk and the wolf. Some {{previously}} extinct birds, such as the golden eagle, been reintroduced in about the year 2000 after decades of extirpation. Until medieval times Ireland was heavily forested with oak, pine and birch. Forests today cover about 12.6% of Ireland, of which 4,450km² or one million acres is owned by Coillte, the Republic's forestry service.|$|E
5|$|Water voles are {{a highly}} {{threatened}} {{species in the}} UK, with a 70–90% decline in numbers mainly due to predation by the introduced American mink, but also habitat loss and water pollution. East Anglian sites of national importance for this species include Cley, Titchwell and other Norfolk coastal sites. Brown hares are widespread, and European otters may be seen at several locations. Both common and grey seals {{can be seen at}} the Blakeney Point colony and off the beaches. The common frog, common toad and <b>common</b> <b>lizard</b> all occur in suitable habitats, and the rare natterjack toad breeds at Holkham and Holme.|$|E
50|$|<b>Common</b> <b>lizards</b> (such as lacerta vivipara) and slowworms (Anguis fragilis) can {{be found}} in the park.|$|R
50|$|There {{are five}} native {{reptiles}} in Wales. These include grass snakes, sand <b>lizards,</b> <b>common</b> <b>lizards</b> and slowworms.|$|R

5|$|Water voles are {{a highly}} {{threatened}} {{species in the}} UK, with a huge decline in numbers of 70–90%, mainly due to predation by the introduced American mink, but also habitat loss and water pollution. They are still common at Cley, {{which is one of}} a number of East Anglian sites now of national importance for this species. Brown hares are widespread, and European otters may be seen, with spraints regularly found at the southern end of East Bank. The common frog, common toad and <b>common</b> <b>lizard</b> all occur on the reserve.|$|E
5|$|The largest {{terrestrial}} lizard of {{the archipelago}} of Puerto Rico is the Mona ground iguana (Cyclura cornuta stejnegeri). A subspecies of the rhinoceros iguana (Cyclura cornuta), it is endemic to Mona Island, {{located in the}} Mona Passage between the main island of Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. Another Cyclura species of similar size, the Anegada ground iguana (Cyclura pinguis), once occurred in the archipelago but it became extirpated due to predation by dogs, cats, and humans, habitat destruction, and competition from goats and pigs, and is now restricted to Anegada. The most <b>common</b> <b>lizard</b> in Puerto Rico is the sharp-mouthed lizard (Anolis pulchellus). The Anolis lizards of Puerto Rico, and the Greater Antilles in general, represent an interesting case of adaptive radiation. Anolis lizards in the Greater Antilles are {{more closely related to}} other species within the same island than to species of adjacent islands. Surprisingly, even though species divergence occurred independently on each island, the same set of ecomorphs (habitat specialists) have evolved on each island.|$|E
25|$|The reptile populations at Bickerton Hill are of {{particular}} significance. It {{is one of five}} sites in the county where the adder has been recorded since 1995. Other reptiles here include slowworm and <b>common</b> <b>lizard.</b>|$|E
25|$|Adders are {{widespread}} {{throughout the}} national park. On the moors they eat <b>common</b> <b>lizards</b> {{and around the}} hedgerows and woodland edges they feed on mice and voles.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} rare plant, animal, bird and insect species {{can be found}} on the {{heathland}} including: butterflies (e.g. small heath and green hairstreak), grasshoppers, <b>common</b> <b>lizards,</b> skylarks, and stonechats.|$|R
50|$|The <b>common</b> <b>lizards</b> {{can be seen}} in the houses. Kirla or girgit {{is found}} in the hedges and attracts the {{attention}} by changing its colours. Sanda is found in sandy areas.|$|R
25|$|The {{heathland}} is {{a significant}} local habitat for the <b>common</b> <b>lizard</b> (Zootoca vivipara) grass snakes (Natrix natrix), and slowworms (Anguis fragilis) dominate the mats in the grassland in spring-time. The common newt (Lissotriton vulgaris), common toad (Bufo bufo) and common frog (Rana temporaria) all inhabit the ponds, and the high insect numbers associated with the water attract bats, such as the common pipistrelle (Pipistrellus pipistrellus) and common long-eared bat (Plecotus auritus).|$|E
25|$|Other {{vertebrates}} {{that survive}} at body temperatures below 0°C include painted turtles (Chrysemys picta), gray tree frogs (Hyla versicolor), box turtles (Terrapene carolina - 48 hours at -2°C), spring peeper (Pseudacris crucifer), garter snakes (Thamnophis sirtalis- 24 hours at -1.5°C), the chorus frog (Pseudacris triseriata), Siberian salamander (Salamandrella keyserlingii - 24 hours at -15.3°C), European <b>common</b> <b>lizard</b> (Lacerta vivipara) and Antarctic fish such as Pagothenia borchgrevinki. Antifreeze proteins cloned from such fish {{have been used}} to confer frost-resistance on transgenic plants.|$|E
25|$|Reptiles {{that feed}} on slugs include mainly snakes and lizards. Some {{colubrid}} snakes are known predators of slugs. Coastal {{populations of the}} garter snake,Thamnophis elegans, have a specialised diet consisting of slugs, such as Ariolimax, while inland populations have a generalized diet. One of its congeners, the Northwestern garter snake (Thamnophis ordinoides), is not a specialized predator of slugs but occasionally feed on them. The redbelly snake (Storeria occipitomaculata) and the brown snake (Storeria dekayi) feed mainly but not solely on slugs, while some species in the genus Dipsas, Sibynomorphus (e.g. Sibynomorphus neuwiedi) and the common slug eater snake (Duberria lutrix), are exclusively slug eaters. Several lizards include slugs in their diet. This {{is the case in}} the slowworm (Anguis fragilis), the bobtail lizard (Tiliqua rugosa), the she-oak skink (Cyclodomorphus casuarinae) and the <b>common</b> <b>lizard</b> (Zootoca vivipara).|$|E
50|$|Adders, <b>common</b> <b>lizards</b> (try Oxwich bay) {{and grass}} snakes have been recorded. Some sand lizards bred by Herpetological Conservation Trust volunteers and Chester and Jersey Zoos have been {{released}} into the wild.|$|R
50|$|Habitats in this reserve are a lake, wetland, {{grassland}} and woodland. Invertebrates include grass {{snakes and}} <b>common</b> <b>lizards,</b> there are birds such as great crested grebes, and flora such as red bartsia and purple loosestrife.|$|R
50|$|The (American) {{five-lined skink}} (Plestiodon fasciatus) is {{a species of}} lizard endemic to North America. It {{is one of the}} most <b>common</b> <b>lizards</b> in the eastern U.S. and one of the seven native species of lizards in Canada.|$|R
500|$|... present include adder (Vipera berus), {{grass snake}} (Natrix natrix), slowworm (Angula fragilis) and <b>common</b> <b>lizard</b> (Lacerta vivipara). Many bird species breed on the Quantocks, {{including}} the grasshopper warbler (Locustella naevia), nightjar (Caprimulgus europaeus), raven (Corvus corax) and the European pied flycatcher (Ficedula hypoleuca). The Quantocks are {{also an important}} site for red deer (Cervus elaphus). Invertebrates of note include the silver-washed fritillary butterfly (Argynnis paphia), and three nationally rare dead-wood beetles: Thymalus limbatus, Orchesia undulata and Rhinosimus ruficollis.|$|E
500|$|There are brown trout, European eel and {{three-spined stickleback}} in the streams, and salmon {{occasionally}} {{run in the}} Kinloch River. The only amphibian found on Rùm is the palmate newt and the only reptile native to Rùm is the <b>common</b> <b>lizard.</b> Invertebrates are diverse and have been studied there since 1884, numerous species of damsel fly, dragonfly, beetle, butterflies, moths etc. having been recorded. Several rare upland species are found on the ultrabasic slopes of Barkeval, Hallival and Askival including the ground beetles Leistus montanus and Amara quenseli. The midge (Culicoides impunctatus), a biting gnat, occurs in [...] "unbelievable numbers".|$|E
2500|$|It has {{recently}} been suggested that all snakes may be venomous to a certain degree, with harmless snakes having weak venom and no fangs. Most snakes currently labelled [...] "nonvenomous" [...] would still be considered harmless according to this theory, as they either lack a venom delivery method or are incapable of delivering enough to endanger a human. This theory postulates that snakes may have evolved from a <b>common</b> <b>lizard</b> ancestor that was venomous—and that venomous lizards like the gila monster, beaded lizard, monitor lizards, and the now-extinct mosasaurs may also have derived from it. They share this venom clade with various other saurian species.|$|E
50|$|The desert iguana (Dipsosaurus dorsalis) {{is one of}} {{the most}} <b>common</b> <b>lizards</b> of the Sonoran and Mojave deserts of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. They also occur on several Gulf of California islands. Their color is mostly grey and tan.|$|R
50|$|The site {{lies between}} two tidal creeks which {{run into the}} River Crouch. It has {{saltmarsh}} and rough grassland with an unusual transition zone between them. Birds include reed buntings, yellow wagtails and meadow pipits, and there are <b>common</b> <b>lizards</b> and slowworms.|$|R
5|$|Amphibians {{are common}} in the capital, {{including}} smooth newts living by the Tate Modern, and common frogs, common toads, palmate newts and great crested newts. On the other hand, native reptiles such as slowworms, <b>common</b> <b>lizards,</b> grass snakes and adders, are mostly only seen in Outer London.|$|R
60|$|But I {{have only}} time {{to point out}} to you a few curious facts with regard to reptiles, which should be {{specially}} interesting to a Hampshire bio- geologist. You know, of course, that in Ireland there are no reptiles, save the little <b>common</b> <b>lizard,</b> Lacerta agilis, and a few frogs on the mountain-tops--how they got there I cannot conceive. And you will, of course, guess, and rightly, that the reason of the absence of reptiles is: that Ireland was parted off from England before the creatures, which certainly spread from southern and warmer climates, had time to get there. You know, of course, that we have a few reptiles in England. But you may not be aware that, as soon as you cross the Channel, you find many more species of reptiles than here, as well as those which you find here. The magnificent green lizard which rattles about like a rabbit in a French forest, is never found here; simply because it had not worked northward till after the Channel was formed. But there are three reptiles peculiar to this part of England which should be most interesting to a Hampshire zoologist. The one is the sand lizard (L. stirpium), found on Bourne-heath, and, I suspect, in the South Hampshire moors likewise--a North European and French species. Another, the Coronella laevis, a harmless French and Austrian snake, which has been found about me, in North Hants and South Berks, now about fifteen or twenty times. I have had three specimens from my own parish. I believe it not to be uncommon; and most probably to be found, by those who will look, both in the New Forest and Woolmer. The third is the Natterjack, or running toad (Bufo Rubeta), a most beautifully spotted animal, with a yellow stripe down his back, which is common with me at Eversley, and common also in many moorlands of Hants and Surrey; and, according to Fleming, on heaths near London, and as far north-east as Lincolnshire; in which case it will belong to the Germanic fauna. Now, here again we have cases of animals which have just been able to get hither before the severance of England and France; and which, not being reinforced from the rear, have been forced to stop, in small and probably decreasing colonies, on the spots nearest the coast which were fit for them.|$|E
