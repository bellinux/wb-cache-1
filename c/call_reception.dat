40|$|Introduction: The medical {{dispatching}} call service made by croatian nurses {{is crucial}} in its significance and responsibility in taking and receiving calls, setting priorities and allocating resources. The best indicators {{of the quality of}} its effect are the changes in call response time, reception time, delay time - which is defined as time between receiving a call and intervention emergency team arrival to the patient, and protocol compliance. The introduction of the new Croatian Emergency <b>Call</b> <b>Reception</b> Index protocol, which is modified from the Norwegian Index of medical Emergencies, resulted in a new model of aiding criteria-based decisions. We examined the efficiency of the dispatching service which is based on Croatian Emergency <b>Call</b> <b>Reception</b> Index protocol. Methods: We performed retrospective analysis of one year period and compared results according to criteria given by the Norwegian index, between index and control group. All the included participants had NACA Severity of Injury or Illness Index score 5 - 7. There {{were no significant differences between}} the participants in both groups based on the subjects’ age and gender. We included 40 participants [20 indexes and 20 control group]. Results: Average <b>call</b> <b>reception</b> and reaction time as well as elapsed time, defined as a time between receiving a call and intervention emergency team arrival to the patient, were significantly shorter in the index group, where the <b>call</b> <b>reception</b> and reaction time were 111 seconds, compared to 180 seconds in the control group. Average elapsed time between receiving a call and the intervention team’s arrival to the patient was 11. 3 minutes for the index group, and it was 15. 5 minutes for the control group. Average time elapsed between receiving a call and the patient’s admission to the emergency department was 32 minutes for the index group and 52 minutes for the control group. Discussion: Seeing as the dispatching service is dynamic, demanding and highly responsible, it is subject to constant monitoring of quality indicators. The implementation of the Croatian Emergency <b>Call</b> <b>Reception</b> Index significantly improved the management of Emergency Medical service...|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{highlights}} quality {{aspects of}} the management of an Emergency Health Service Center (SSUEm 118, Varese) {{in order to identify}} the corrective measures required in a service that is increasingly close to the citizens real needs and expectations. Data were collected retrospectively on a total 54, 301 calls for assistance in the period October 1997 -March 1999 from an area covering some 1, 300 sq. km with a population of 1, 150, 000 residents. That resident population was dramatically increased on a daily basis by heavy vehicle traffic particularly on the motorways to the area's many factories and to the Intercontinental Airport Malpensa 2000. The survey employed 7 anaesthetists and resuscitation staff, 14 nurses and 8 Italian Red Cross works from the Emergency Center. The researchers analysed the following phases: <b>call</b> <b>reception</b> and telephone conversation: ambulance dispatch, patient transportation and the alerting of the hospital of destination. The ServFMEA method was used for Quality Control with appropriate dispatch and the conduct and timing of the ambulance service in the Varese SSUEm 118 area. The data collected allowed for a detailed analysis of the accuracy of the information provided over the telephone (over-triage 58 %, undertriage 2 %), the usefulness of the telephone filter, the colour coding (correct in 40 % of cases), pick-up times (5 ' 40 " on average) which were related to problems inherent in the ambulance call-out and the way ambulances reached the emergency (BLS 99 %, ALS 1 %, Air rescue < 1 %). It was concluded that Varese SSUEm 118 was effectively and efficiently run in its first 18 months and results were improved as far as they could be given the inadequate funding of the Italian Heatlh Service...|$|E

40|$|This book {{tracks and}} evaluates {{the impact of}} the ECHR on {{eighteen}} national legal orders. As the reports demonstrate, national systems are increasingly porous to the influence of the ECHR and the case law of its Court. European States no longer embody insular, autonomous, self-defined legal systems, if ever they did. At the constitutional level, the systems of every country surveyed in this volume have experienced significant structural change. To take two dramatic examples, judges once prohibited from engaging in judicial review of statute now do so routinely, with reference to European rights; and the dualist features of many legal systems have given way to a sophisticated monism, {{when it comes to the}} Convention. Further, how the different branches of Government interact with one another has been changed, radically in some States, to the extent that the regime’s evolution has served to undermine traditional separation of powers dogmas. This volume also examines {{the impact of the}} Strasbourg Court’s jurisprudence on legislators, executives, and judges. Thousands of discreet legal and policy outcomes have been altered as a result of the influence of Convention rights. It is also clear that legal education and scholarship are also changing in ways that will help to consolidate the regime’s domestic presence and legitimacy. The impact of the ECHR is organized by a complex social process that we <b>call</b> <b>reception.</b> The reports identify a diverse range of mechanisms of reception: those stable procedures that national officials construct and use in order to adapt the national legal order to the ECHR, as it develops over time. The reports show that no State can fully insulate itself from the regime’s reach and influence. The best States can do is to build and maintain their own system of strong national rights protection, and to develop effective mechanisms of reception. The reports also show that the intensity of the influence of the jurisprudence of the Strasbourg Court on domestic systems varies widely across States; and the Court’s impact has increased over time, in some legal domains more than others, within each State. Although we will venture a number of general propositions about reception processes in this chapter, such statements should be carefully considered in light of the cross-national and temporal diversity documented and evaluated in the national reports...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Update {{propagation}} and transaction atomicity {{are major}} obstacles {{to the development}} of replicated databases. Many practical applications, such as automated teller machine networks, ight reservation, and part inventory control, do not require these properties. In this paper we present an approach for incrementally updating a distributed, replicated database without requiring multi-site atomic commit protocols. We prove that the mechanism is correct, as it asymptotically performs all the updates on all the copies. Our approach has two important characteristics: it is progressive, and non-blocking. Progressive means that the transaction's coordinator always commits, possibly together with a group of other sites. The update is later propagated asynchronously to the remaining sites. Non-blocking means that each site can take unilateral decisions at each step of the algorithm. Sites which cannot commit updates are brought to the same nal state by means of a reconciliation mechanism. This mechanism uses the history logs, which are stored locally at each site, to bring sites to agreement. It requires a small auxiliary data structure, <b>called</b> <b>reception</b> vector, {{to keep track of the}} time unto which the other sites are guaranteed to be up-to-date. Several optimizations to the basic mechanism are also discussed...|$|R
