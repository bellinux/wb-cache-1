5|$|Quantitative {{methods are}} often used to ask {{questions}} about a population that is very large, making a census or a <b>complete</b> <b>enumeration</b> of all the members in that population infeasible. A 'sample' then forms a manageable subset of a population. In quantitative research, statistics are used to draw inferences from this sample regarding the population as a whole. The process of selecting a sample is referred to as 'sampling'. While it is usually best to sample randomly, concern with differences between specific subpopulations sometimes calls for stratified sampling. Conversely, the impossibility of random sampling sometimes necessitates nonprobability sampling, such as convenience sampling or snowball sampling.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} {{infinite}} hyperbolic Coxeter groups. Hyperbolic groups are categorized as compact or not, with compact groups having bounded fundamental domains. Compact simplex hyperbolic groups (Lannér simplices) exist as rank 3 to 5. Paracompact simplex groups (Koszul simplices) exist up to rank 10. Hypercompact (Vinberg polytopes) {{groups have been}} explored but not been fully determined. In 2006, Allcock proved that there are infinitely many compact Vinberg polytopes for dimension up to 6, and infinitely many finite-volume Vinberg polytopes for dimension up to 19, so a <b>complete</b> <b>enumeration</b> is not possible. All of these fundamental reflective domains, both simplices and nonsimplices, are often called Coxeter polytopes or sometimes less accurately Coxeter polyhedra.|$|E

40|$|A brief {{review of}} our recent studies aiming at a better {{understanding}} of the scaling behaviour of polymers in disordered environments is given. The main emphasis is on a simple generic model where the polymers are represented by (interacting) self-avoiding walks and the disordered environment by critical percolation clusters. The scaling behaviour of the number of conformations and their average spatial extent as a function of the number of monomers and the associated critical exponents γ and ν are examined with two complementary approaches: numerical chain-growth computer simulations using the PERM algorithm and <b>complete</b> <b>enumerations</b> of all possible polymer conformations employing a recently developed very efficient exact counting method.

A major stumbling block to {{the widespread use of}} combinatorial auctions is the complexity of winner determination known to be NP-complete. We consider a rich version of combinatorial auctions, rule-based combinatorial auctions, where bids consist of rules that describe acceptable bundles rather than provide <b>complete</b> <b>enumerations</b> of acceptable bundles. This makes the winner determination problem even harder because the problem must find bundles meeting bid criteria as well as finding an optimal selection of winning bids. Our contribution is threefold. First, we give a general approach to providing good approximations to the winner determination problem for rule-based auctions. Although the approach requires adaptation for specific instances, it is conceptually tractable and implementable. Second, the approach is illustrated and tested with an artificial but realistic case proposing an auction format for selling prime time television advertising time formed from data and interviews with industry sources. Third, while some researchers have used commercial solvers that appeared to obviate the need for specialized solution approaches to the winner determination problem, we give evidence which, at least for the problem studied here, shows specialized approaches are necessary...|$|R

40|$|Objective: This study {{examines}} {{the variation in}} coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality {{and acute myocardial infarction}} (AMI) by socio-economic status (SES), country of birth (COB) and geography (urban/rural) in the total population of New South Wales (Australia) in 1991 - 95. Method: CHD deaths and AMI are from <b>complete</b> <b>enumerations</b> of deaths and hospital admissions, respectively; and population denominators are from census information. Data are examined separately by sex, and comparisons of SES groups (based on municipalities), COB and region are analysed using Poisson regression, after adjustment for age. Results: The study identified higher risk for AMI admissions and CHD mortality in lower SES populations with significant linear trends, for both sexes, adjusted for age, region and COB. According to the population attributable fractions (PAF), 23 - 41 % of the risk of CHD occurrence is due to SES lower than the highest quartile. The higher age-adjusted risk for CHD occurrence in rural and remote populations for both sexes, compared with urban communities, was lessened by adjustment for COB, and all but abolished when also adjusted for SES. COB analysis indicated significantly lower age-adjusted AMI admissions and CHD mortality compared with the Australian-born, Conclusions: Higher risks for CHD in rural populations compared with the capital city (Sydney) are due, in part, to lower SES, lesser migrant composition. Implications: Strategies for reducing CHD differentials should consider demographic factors and the fundamental need to reduce socio-economic inequalities, as well as targeting appropriate prevention measures...|$|R
