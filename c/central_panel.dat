5|$|Six outer panels (or shutters) are hinged; when folded {{they show}} an {{exterior}} view of saints and the donors. The inner panels contain {{scenes from the}} Last Judgement arranged across two registers. The large <b>central</b> <b>panel</b> that spans both registers shows Christ seated on a rainbow in judgment, with his feet resting on a golden globe. Below him the Archangel Michael holds scales as he weighs souls. The panel on Christ's far right shows the gates of Heaven, that to his far left the entrance to Hell. The panels of the lower register form a continuous landscape, with figures depicted moving from the <b>central</b> <b>panel</b> to their final destinations after receiving judgement.|$|E
5|$|Modelling is {{far from}} the only {{possible}} way to illustrate mathematical concepts. Giotto's Stefaneschi Triptych, 1320, illustrates recursion in the form of mise en abyme; the <b>central</b> <b>panel</b> of the triptych contains, lower left, the kneeling figure of Cardinal Stefaneschi, holding up the triptych as an offering. Giorgio Chirico's metaphysical paintings such as his 1917 Great Metaphysical Interior explore the question of levels of representation in art by depicting paintings within his paintings.|$|E
5|$|Motifs and {{arrangements}} of figures extend along the lower panels {{from one to}} the next, {{to the extent that the}} separations between panels are ignored with the intersections cutting figures in two. This is particularly evident on the lower register where each panel division intersects figures, so that parts of figures are painted on two adjoining panels; whereas Christ and St Michael are enclosed within the single <b>central</b> <b>panel,</b> giving emphasis to the iconography.|$|E
50|$|The {{house is}} built from granite ashlar, Pentewan stone ashlar and stucco, and {{features}} hipped slate roofs and rendered stacks. The central doorcase is arched with a pulvinated frieze, and contains an 18th-century <b>central</b> <b>panelled</b> door with sidelights.|$|R
5|$|The first {{generation}} of Netherlandish masters borrowed many customs from 13th- and 14th-century Italian altarpieces. The conventions for Italian triptychs before 1400 were quite rigid. In <b>central</b> <b>panels</b> the mid-ground was populated {{by members of the}} Holy Family; early works, especially from the Sienese or Florentine traditions, were overwhelmingly characterised by images of the enthroned Virgin set against a gilded background. The wings usually contain a variety of angels, donors and saints, but there is never direct eye contact, and only rarely a narrative connection, with the <b>central</b> <b>panel's</b> figures. Netherlandish painters adapted many of these conventions, but subverted them almost from the start. Van der Weyden was especially innovative, as apparent in his 1442–45 Miraflores Altarpiece and c.1452 Braque Triptych. In these paintings members of the Holy Family appear on the wings instead of just the <b>central</b> <b>panels,</b> while the latter is notable for the continuous landscape connecting the three inner panels. From the 1490s Hieronymus Bosch painted at least 16 triptychs, the best of which subverted existing conventions. Bosch's work continued the move towards secularism and emphasised landscape. Bosch also unified the scenes of the inner panels.|$|R
50|$|A kali or kalidar kurta {{is similar}} to a frock and has many panels. The kalidar kurta is made up of several {{geometrical}} pieces. It has two rectangular <b>central</b> <b>panels</b> in the back and the front. The kali kurta is worn by men and women.|$|R
5|$|There {{have been}} aberrations. The 1992 kit, {{sponsored}} by Triton Showers, {{was made of}} a blue material covered with multicoloured splashes which resembled a shower curtain. Birmingham have only worn stripes on their home shirt once; in 1999 they wore a blue shirt with a front <b>central</b> <b>panel</b> in narrow blue and white stripes, a design similar to the Tesco supermarket carrier bag of the time.|$|E
5|$|Art {{historian}} Robert Koch remarked in 1988 on {{the similarity}} of provenance, material, technique, tone and colour of the four works described by Eastlake. He proposed that they were intended as wings of a five-part polyptych altarpiece. Based on the format of Bouts' 1464–67 Altar of Holy Sacrament, whose four wing panels are the same length as The Entombment, he believes the altarpiece would have comprised a large <b>central</b> <b>panel</b> with four works half its length and width positioned two at either side. His speculative reconstruction places The Entombment on the upper right-hand wing, above the Adoration.|$|E
5|$|Built with a {{range of}} shops to both sides, the modernist design of the {{entrance}} vestibule {{takes the form of a}} double-height box clad in white Portland stone with a three-part glazed screen on the front façade divided by columns of which the capitals are three-dimensional versions of the Underground roundel. The <b>central</b> <b>panel</b> of the screen contains a large version of the roundel. The ticket hall beyond is octagonal with a central roof light of the same shape. The ticket hall originally had a pair of wooden ticket booths (passimeters) from which tickets were issued and collected, but these were removed when modern ticketing systems made them redundant.|$|E
25|$|After John Loughborough Pearson’s death, William Douglas Caröe {{became the}} church {{architect}} and in 1910 he designed arches and arcades which {{were placed on}} either side of the <b>central</b> <b>panels.</b> They held figures of six martyrs and all six figures were carved by Hitch in Hollington stone.|$|R
50|$|Portuguese art {{historian}} António Bélard da Fonseca, in his multi-volume O Mistério dos Painéis (1957-1967), controversially claimed {{that it is}} James of Portugal, and not St. Vincent, who is depicted as the radiant saintly figure in the <b>central</b> <b>panels</b> of the famous Saint Vincent Panels of Nuno Gonçalves.|$|R

5|$|The {{names of}} a further 24 {{casualties}} from the First World War {{were added to}} the <b>central</b> <b>panel</b> of the memorial prior to Remembrance Sunday 2014. The additions were the result of research {{by a member of the}} local branch of the Royal British Legion (RBL), which produced a list of 50 names, though the remaining casualties' connections to Spalding were deemed too tenuous for their names to be included. As a result of local government reorganisations, the memorial is now the responsibility of South Holland District Council, which is based in Spalding.|$|E
5|$|The roof of {{the front}} aisle has panels with murals in the centre {{of male and female}} figurines flying in the clouds; the male figure is yaksha holding a sword and a shield. Decoration of lotus blooms are also seen on the panels. The {{roof of the}} hall is divided into nine panels {{slightly}} above the level of the ceiling. The <b>central</b> <b>panel</b> here depicts a deva mounted on a ramconjectured to be Agni. Images of Brahma and Varuna are also painted on the central panels; the floating figures are seen in the remaining panels.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{presence}} of vegetation, the earth does not yet contain human or animal life, indicating that the scene represents {{the events of the}} biblical Third Day. Bosch renders the plant life in an unusual fashion, using uniformly gray tints which make it difficult to determine whether the subjects are purely vegetable or perhaps include some mineral formations. Surrounding the interior of the globe is the sea, partially illuminated by beams of light shining through clouds. The exterior wings have a clear position within the sequential narrative of the work as a whole. They show an unpopulated earth composed solely of rock and plants, contrasting sharply with the inner <b>central</b> <b>panel</b> which contains a paradise teeming with lustful humanity.|$|E

50|$|The two panels {{representing}} the empress Ariadne, in the Bargello in Florence and the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna, also {{belong to the}} hypothesied imperial diptych type. They are the only <b>central</b> <b>panels</b> of such a diptych (other than the Barberini ivory) to survive, since all other fragments of such diptychs are from side panels.|$|R
5|$|The work clearly {{distinguishes between}} {{figures of the}} divine, earthly and hellish realms. Perhaps {{following}} Jan van Eyck's c. 1432 Ghent Altarpiece, the polyptych wings form an inverted T-shape. When the shutters are closed the panels resemble an upside-down cross, a form common in 15th-century carved retables: an elevated <b>central</b> <b>panel</b> allowed additional space for a narrative scene, to depict a heavenly vista, a single large figure, or a crucifixion with space for the cross to extend above the other panels, an innovation seen in van der Weyden's Descent from the Cross. This shape echoes typical configuration of Gothic churches, where the naves often extended past the aisles into the apse or choir. The imagery of the outer panels {{is set in the}} earthly realm with the donors, and saints painted in grisaille to imitate sculpture.|$|E
5|$|Scholars have {{proposed}} that Bosch used the outer panels to establish a Biblical setting for the inner elements of the work, and the exterior image is generally interpreted as set in an earlier time {{than those in the}} interior. As with Bosch's Haywain triptych, the inner centerpiece is flanked by heavenly and hellish imagery. The scenes depicted in the triptych are thought to follow a chronological order: flowing from left-to-right they represent Eden, the garden of earthly delights, and Hell. God appears as the creator of humanity in the left hand wing, while the consequences of humanity's failure to follow his will are shown in the right.However, in contrast to Bosch's two other complete triptychs, The Last Judgment (around 1482) and The Haywain (after 1510), God is absent from the <b>central</b> <b>panel.</b> Instead, this panel shows humanity acting with apparent free will as naked men and women engage in various pleasure-seeking activities. According to some interpretations, the right hand panel is believed to show God's penalties in a hellscape.|$|E
5|$|The {{historical}} {{evidence suggests that}} Lochner's paintings were well known and widely copied during his lifetime, and remained so until the 16th century. Early examples in ink after his Virgin in Adoration are in the British Museum and École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts. The influence of Lochner's Last Judgement {{can be seen in}} Hans Memling's Gdansk altarpiece, where the gates of Heaven are similar, as is the rendering of the blessed. Albrecht Dürer knew of him before his stay in Cologne, and Van der Weyden saw his paintings during his travel to Italy. The latter's Altar of Saint John is similar to Lochner's Flaying of Bartholomew, especially in the executioner's pose, while his Saint Columba altarpiece includes two motifs from Lochner's Adoration of the Magi triptych; specifically, the king in the <b>central</b> <b>panel</b> {{with his back to the}} viewer, and the girl in the right hand wing holding a basket containing doves.|$|E
