5000|$|<b>Chlorphenesin</b> {{carbamate}} (Maolate, Musil) is a centrally acting {{muscle relaxant}} {{used to treat}} muscle pain and spasms. <b>Chlorphenesin</b> is no longer {{used for this purpose}} in most developed nations due to the availability of much safer spasmolytics such as benzodiazepines.|$|E
50|$|Phenoxyethanol is {{a vaccine}} {{preservative}} and potential allergen, which {{may result in}} a nodular reaction at the site of injection. It reversibly inhibits NMDAR-mediated ion currents. Ingestion may cause CNS and respiratory depression, vomiting and diarrhea in infants, particularly when combined with <b>chlorphenesin.</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Chlorphenesin</b> (3 -p-chlorophenoxy- 1, 2 -propanediol), when {{injected}} intravenously {{together with}} either of two common bacterial antigens, inhibits the antibody response of the rabbit. The antigens studied are those common to Enterobacteriaceae and to gram-positive bacteria. The immunosuppression is contingent upon incubation of <b>chlorphenesin</b> and antigen in vitro prior to administration, since separate injection of antigen and inhibitor or of mixtures without prior incubation yields undiminished antibody response. <b>Chlorphenesin,</b> as shown by hemagglutination-inhibition tests, does not alter the antigenic determinants, because antibody neutralization occurs in {{the presence or absence}} of the drug. The immunosuppressive effect is reversible, since precipitation of <b>chlorphenesin</b> at 4 C substantially restores immunogenicity. Animals immunized with antigen-drug mixtures, which fail to respond with significant antibody production, nonetheless are immunologically primed. It is concluded that <b>chlorphenesin</b> represents another example of antigen-associated immunosuppressants...|$|E
40|$|<b>Chlorphenesin,</b> {{a simple}} {{glycerol}} ether, when added to Jerne plates greatly {{reduced the number}} of hemolytic plaques. This effect appeared to be related to dose, and was clearly demonstrable with antibody-forming spleen cells from mice that had been immunized either with sheep red blood cells or with penicillin G conjugated with Keyhole limpet hemocyanin. <b>Chlorphenesin</b> did not affect the antigen, destroy complement, or interfere with the interaction of complement and the antigen-antibody complexes. Incubation of spleen cell suspensions with <b>chlorphenesin</b> prior to plating was more effective in reducing the number of plaques than was addition of the substance to the plates. It may act by reducing the ability of antibodies to react with antigens or by affecting the release of antibodies from the spleen cells...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} a number of drugs on the {{production}} of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) by antigen-stimulated sensitized guinea-pig lymph node cells was studied. The drugs were present during the entire culture period and eliminated from supernatants by dialysis. It was found that MIF secretion is inhibited by exogenous dibutyryl cyclic AMP and by theophylline and <b>chlorphenesin,</b> two agents raising the endogenous level of cyclic AMP. On the other hand, isoproterenol, which stimulates cyclic AMP generation in several tissues, did not block MIF production. The formation of the mediator was also suppressed by the microfilament-affecting drug, cytochalasin B. The microtubular disruptive agents, colchicine and vinblastine sulphate, did not influence MIF production. It is concluded that: (a) endogenous cyclic AMP may act as a regulator of MIF production; (b) the activity of contractile microfilaments is probably required for MIF formation; and (c) microtubules are not involved in the secretory process...|$|E
40|$|Slow-reacting {{substance}} of anaphylaxis (SRS-A) is released immunologically from bovine lung in vitro. Various drugs known to protect calves {{and other animals}} during anaphylaxis were tested to investigate their modulation of the formation and release of SRS-A. The anti-inflammatory drugs, meclofenamate and aspirin, potentiated SRS-A release. <b>Chlorphenesin</b> and diethylcarbamazine citrate at high concentrations both inhibited SRS-A release. Two new anti-anaphylactic drugs, PR-D- 92 -EA and M&B 22, 948, were particularly effective in inhibiting SRS-A release at low concentrations. The possible modes of actions of these drugs are discussed.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to develop an emulgel formulation of <b>chlorphenesin</b> (CHL) using 2 types of gelling agents: hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC) and Carbopol 934. The influence of the type of the gelling agent and the concentration of both the oil phase and emulsifying agent on the drug release from the prepared emulgels was investigated using a 23 factorial design. The prepared emulgels were evaluated for their physical appearance, rheological behavior, drug release, antifungal activity, and stability. Commercially available CHL topical powder was used for comparison. All the prepared emulgels showed acceptable physical properties concerning color, homogeneity, consistency, spreadability, and pH value. They also exhibited higher drug release and antifungal activity than the CHL powder. It was found that the emulsifying agent concentration had the most pronounced effect on the drug release from the emulgels followed by the oil phase concentration and finally the type of the gelling agent. The drug release from all the emulgels was found to follow diffusion-controlled mechanism. Rheological studies revealed that the CHL emulgels exhibited a shear-thinning behavior with thixotropy. Stability studies showed that the physical appearance, rheological properties, drug release, and antifungal activity in all the prepared emulgels remained unchanged upon storage for 3 months. As a general conclusion, it was suggested that the CHL emulgel formulation prepared with HPMC with the oil phase concentration in its low level and emulsifying agent concentration in its high level was the formula of choice since it showed the highest drug release and antifungal activity...|$|E
