5|$|From the 4th century {{through to}} the 6th century the use of talud-tablero {{architecture}} became notable in the Mundo Perdido.

5|$|Roman {{citizens}} were organized into {{three types of}} voting units: curiae, centuria, and tribus or tribes. These corresponded to three different kinds of assemblies: the Curiate Assembly, the Centuriate Assembly, and the Tribal Assembly.

5|$|By {{the second}} {{decade of the}} 21st century, the overall {{consensus}} supported the position {{that there was only}} a single author who was writing either {{at the end of the}} 4th <b>century</b> <b>or</b> the beginning of the 5th century, and who was interested in blending contemporary issues (political, religious and social) into the lives of the 3rd century emperors. Further, that the author used the fictitious elements in the work to highlight references to other published works, such as to Cicero and Ammianus Marcellinus in a complex allegorical game. Despite these conundrums, it is the only continuous account in Latin for much of its period and is thus continually being re-evaluated, since modern historians are unwilling to abandon it as a unique source of possible information, despite its obvious untrustworthiness on many levels.|$|E

For the first <b>century</b> <b>or</b> so, the Commonwealth military was usually successful, but became less so from around the mid-17th century. Plagued by insufficient funds, it found itself increasingly hard-pressed to defend the country, and inferior in numbers to the growing armies of the Commonwealth's neighbors.|$|E
5|$|In 849, Calakmul was {{mentioned}} at Seibal where a ruler named as Chan Pet attended the K'atun-ending ceremony; his name {{may also be}} recorded on a broken ceramic at Calakmul itself. However, {{it is unlikely that}} Calakmul still existed as a state in any meaningful way at this late date. A final flurry of activity took place {{at the end of the}} 9th <b>century</b> <b>or</b> the beginning of the 10th. A new stela was erected, although the date records only the day, not the full date. The recorded day may fall either in 899 or 909 with the latter date the most likely. A few monuments appear to be even later although their style is crude, representing the efforts of a remnant population to maintain the Classic Maya tradition. Even the inscriptions on these late monuments are meaningless imitations of writing.|$|E
