500|$|Kubrick spent {{extensive}} hours editing, often working {{seven days}} a week, and more hours a day as he got closer to deadlines. For Kubrick, written dialogue was one element {{to be put in}} balance with mise en scène (set arrangements), music, and especially, editing. Inspired by Pudovkin's treatise on film editing, Kubrick realized that one could create a performance in the editing room and often [...] "re-direct" [...] a film, and he remarked: [...] "I love editing. I think I like it more than any other phase of filmmaking... Editing is the only unique aspect of filmmaking which does not resemble any other art form—a point so important it cannot be overstressed... It <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>or</b> break a film". Biographer John Baxter stated that [...] "Instead of finding the intellectual spine of a film in the script before starting work, Kubrick felt his way towards the final version of a film by shooting each scene from many angles and demanding scores of takes on each line. Then over months... he arranged and rearranged {{the tens of thousands of}} scraps of film to fit a vision that really only began to emerge during editing".|$|E

Paul Turk, the publications director of the aviation consultancy firm Avmark Inc., said that many airlines faced difficulties in the 1980s due to fare wars, a recession, and decline in travel and that Air Florida had already faced increasing debt and financial losses prior to the crash. Turk argued that [...] "Air Florida would have folded without the crash". Thomas Canning, a senior airline analyst for Standard & Poor's, said [...] "I don't believe one crash <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>or</b> break an airline. There were a lot of other factors involved in Air Florida's bankruptcy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ólafur Arnalds won a British Academy Television (BAFTA) Craft Award for Original Television Music in April 2014. It was {{his first}} {{composition}} for television. Ólafur's music was widely praised. Mike Hale, writing in The New York Times, called it [...] "a tasty icing of gloom and foreboding", and noted that the show leaned very heavily on the mood that the music created. Cast members were equally as impressed with the music. Actress Jodie Whittaker has said that [...] "hearing the music by Ólafur Arnalds just broke me every time." [...] Actor Andrew Buchan was equally effusive. [...] "The power of music can draw people in more than they realise. I had never heard {{a piece of music}} like it. They deliberately went left-field with Ólafur Arnalds. I found it haunting, beautiful and desolate. It <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>or</b> break a show.

60|$|One of the {{material}} advantages possessed by a man-of-war in a chase with a merchant vessel, is in the greater velocity with which her crew <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>or</b> take in sail. I knew that the moment we began to touch our braces, tacks and sheets, that the Leander would do the same, {{and that she would}} effect her objects in half the time in which we could effect ours. Nevertheless, the thing was to be done, and we set about the preparations with care and assiduity. It was a small matter to round in our weather braces, until the yards were nearly square, but the rigging out of her studding-sail booms, and the setting of the sails, was a job to occupy the Dawn's people several minutes. Marble suggested that by edging gradually away, we should bring the Leander so far on our quarter as to cause the after-sails to conceal what we were about forward, and that we might steal a march on our pursuers by adopting this precaution. I thought the suggestion a good one, and the necessary orders were given to carry it out.|$|E

6000|$|After all, the {{practical}} reason why, {{when the power}} is once {{in the hands of}} the people, a majority are permitted, and for a long period continue, to rule is not because they are most likely to be in the right, nor because this seems fairest to the minority, but because they are physically the strongest. But a government in which the majority rule in all cases can not be based on justice, even as far as men understand it. Can there not be a government in which the majorities do not virtually decide right and wrong, but conscience?--in which majorities decide only those questions to which the rule of expediency is applicable? Must the citizen ever for a moment, or in the least degree, resign his conscience to the legislator? Why has every man a conscience then? I think that we should be men first, and subjects afterward. It is not desirable to cultivate a respect for the law, so much as for the right. The only obligation which I have a right to assume is to do at any time what I think right. It is truly enough said that a corporation has no conscience; but a corporation of conscientious men is a corporation with a conscience. Law never made men a whit more just; and, by means of their respect for it, even the well-disposed are daily made the agents on injustice. A common and natural result of an undue respect for the law is, that you may see a file of soldiers, colonel, captain, corporal, privates, powder-monkeys, and all, marching in admirable order over hill and dale to the wars, against their wills, ay, against their common sense and consciences, which makes it very steep marching indeed, and produces a palpitation of the heart. They have no doubt that it is a damnable business in which they are concerned; they are all peaceably inclined. Now, what are they? Men at all? or small movable forts and magazines, at the service of some unscrupulous man in power?
