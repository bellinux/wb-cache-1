5000|$|Swage (compression) {{fittings}} or {{cable clips}} {{are used to}} terminate counterweight system lift lines, after the cable has been looped around a thimble. Cable clips terminations maintain less load capacity than swage fittings, typically require three clips, and are greatly reduced in load capacity if the installer happened to [...] "saddle a dead horse". Both swage and <b>cable</b> <b>clip</b> terminations permanently crimp (deform) the wire rope.|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} {{how to do}} stability analysis, variation simulation and tolerance envelopes for deformable cables and hoses. In this way, the well-established methods for analyzing and minimizing the propagation of geometric variation are extended from rigid and sheet metal assemblies to large deformations of slender parts. This extension is highly motivated, not at least, by the increased amount of cables and hoses in electrified and hybrid solutions in the automotive industry. To secure the geometric correctness of the analysis, we use a nonlinear rod approach {{in the implementation of}} a simulation model of flexible cables that accounts for large deformations and supports a wide range of common <b>cable</b> <b>clip</b> types, cable joints and branches. A selection of measures and visualizations that reflect the spatial effects of geometric variation in deformable cables is incorporated in established variation analysis techniques. In particular, the concept of tolerance envelopes for rigid parts has been extended to also handle system of slender parts such as cables and hoses. This article extends previous research on robust design and variation simulation to cables subject to large deformations and has been successfully applied on two typical industrial cases: a wiring harness attached with various types of clips to a static surrounding and a cooler hose subjected to a high-frequency sampled engine motion...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{question}} of the pretensioning force of the wrapping wires for a suspension bridge {{is one of the}} important subjects. It could prevent the main cable from eroding by air or chemicals. And it must have some loss under the influence of dead loading, each mobile load and environment[1]. Now, the research of wrapping wire of the main cable is not much at home and abroad. And wrapping wire tension is mainly obtained depending on engineering experience. This paper has an experiment about the wrapping wire of Yangmingtan Bridge in Harbin to draw conclusions that wrapping wires tension which is 2 m far from the <b>cable</b> <b>clips</b> is reduced extensively, more than 80 %. But the residual tension, 8 m from the <b>cable</b> <b>clips,</b> is about 35 % of the initial tension. In addition, the wrapping wires tension which is about 93 cm far from pre-wrapped wire-loops remains stable. Finally, starting from calculation theory, the paper puts forward that the wrapping wire tension should be 2. 0 kN...|$|R

The series ran 12 episodes.|$|R
5000|$|Shown {{below are}} the cabling {{arrangements}} for both 4-wire and 6-wire cable. Initially 4-wire was used and many older installations still use it, then the 6-wire became the new standard, but the 4-wire has latterly been reissued to all Openreach engineers {{as part of}} cost savings. Modern 4-wire however is the same diameter as 6-wire to allow engineers to retain existing tacking guns and <b>cable</b> <b>clips.</b> Note that the wires in the 6-wire cable are coloured with two colours in a ratio of four to one in length, with the first colour mentioned being the predominant one, e.g. if the indicated colour of the wire is W-B then the wire will be coloured white for 12 mm, then blue for 3 mm and so on. (In other words, {{it looks like a}} white wire with blue patches on it.) ...|$|R

50|$|Initially, {{electric}} locomotives were used only {{where it was}} economical to string overhead line for power. This limited their usage for gathering loads at the mine face, where trackage was temporary and frequently relocated. This motivated the development of battery locomotives, but {{in the first decade}} of the 20th century the first successful electric gathering locomotives used cable reels. To run on tracks away from overhead lines, the power <b>cable</b> was <b>clipped</b> to the overhead line and then automatically unreeled as the locomotive advanced and reeled up as the locomotive returned.|$|R
50|$|Optical {{attached}} cable (OPAC) {{is a type}} of {{fibre optic}} cable that is installed by being attached to a host conductor along overhead power lines. The attachment system varies and can include wrapping, lashing or clipping the fibre optic cable to the host. Installation is typically performed using a specialised piece of equipment that travels along the host conductor from pole to pole or tower to tower, wrapping, clipping or lashing the fibre optic cable in place. Different manufacturers have different systems and the installation equipment, cable designs and hardware are not interchangeable.Although lashed <b>cable</b> systems and <b>clipped</b> <b>cable</b> systems have been investigated as a means of attaching optical fibre cables to overhead power lines, wrapped cables were the first type to be developed and are the only type in common use today.|$|R
40|$|An {{electronic}} {{gate circuit}} is described, which is linear for pulses up to 10 V over an impedance of 200 Ω. The gate-pulse width {{is determined by}} an external <b>clipping</b> <b>cable</b> and can be varied from 500 ns down to 40 ns. The input can be of either polarity. The gate incorporates a fixed, well defined dead-time of about 50 μs, which assures stable operation also at high counting rates...|$|R
5000|$|Color-coding of cables is {{sometimes}} {{used to keep}} track of which is which. For instance, the wires coming out of ATX power supplies are color-coded by voltage. Documenting and labeling cable runs, tying related cables together by cable ties, cable lacing, rubber bands or other means, running them through <b>cable</b> guides, and <b>clipping</b> or stapling them to walls are other common methods of keeping them organized. Above drop ceilings, hooks or trays are used to organize cables and protect them from electrical interference ...|$|R
2500|$|Downrigger are devices used while {{trolling}} {{to keep a}} bait or lure at {{the desired}} depth. In practice, fish swim at different depths according to {{factors such as the}} temperature and amount of light in the water, and the speed and direction of water currents. [...] A downrigger consists of a one or two metre horizontal pole which supports a weight, typically about three kilograms of lead, on a steel <b>cable.</b> A <b>clip</b> called a [...] "line release" [...] attaches the fishing line to the weight, and the bait or lure is attached to the release. The fishing line is reeled in by a spool powered either by manual cranking or by an electric motor. Using a downrigger can be hazardous. For example, man-made reservoirs can contain submerged trees and other structures beneath the surface which downriggers can snag.|$|R
50|$|The {{major problem}} with these {{bindings}} is {{they did not}} release {{in the case of}} an accident. In particular, if the forward tip of the ski rotated to the side, the force was transmitted through the length of the ski to the boot, forming a huge moment arm. Even small forces could produce torques able to break the ankle or knee, and spiral fractures of the calf were common. This was not as much of an issue in cross-country where the heel was relatively free to move, but in downhill use when the <b>cable</b> was <b>clipped</b> down this was a serious concern. In the 1950s it was estimated that a skier had a 1% chance of suffering an injury on any given day, and that 10% of skiers would suffer a fracture over a single season.|$|R
5000|$|In the {{immediate}} post-World War II era, most downhill ski bindings {{were of the}} [...] "Kandahar" [...] pattern of cable binding. This consisted of a metal cup {{at the front of}} the ski that kept the boot centred, with a leather strap buckled over the toe to hold it down into the cup. A long metal cable or spring ran around the back of the boot, over a flange protruding from the heel. The strap held the boot forward and kept the toe in the cup and under the strap. The system was designed to keep the toe firmly in place while allowing the heel to rise off the ski. This allowed for a smooth cross-country striding motion. For downhill use, the <b>cable</b> was <b>clipped</b> down near the heel to keep the boot in firmer contact with the ski, and allow some level of lateral control.|$|R

Farmers and Quaker State returned, with Farmers {{increasing}} its sponsorship to 22 races. GoDaddy.com left for Tommy Baldwin Racing/Stewart-Haas Racing to sponsor Danica Patrick, but Time Warner <b>Cable</b> and Great <b>Clips</b> signed on as replacements. After a poor start to the season, Kahne rebounded immensely {{and picked up a}} win in the Coca-Cola 600. He won again at New Hampshire in July and made the 2012 Chase, finishing a career-best 4th in standings. Kahne also won four pole positions throughout the season.|$|R
50|$|On August 26-28, 2005, l'Atelier {{collaborated with}} Winnipeg artist Daniel Barrow {{to present the}} {{screening}} series, Garbage Hill: A Showcase of Discarded Winnipeg Film and TV, held at the Winnipeg Film Group's Cinematheque. The series was a compendium of former cable access television shows from VPW and Cablevision, locally produced television commercials and under appreciated films from thirty years of Manitoba filmmaking. Barrow presented <b>clips</b> from <b>cable</b> TV shows, such as dance free-for-all The Pollock and Pollock Gossip Show, repertory musical performance show The Cosmopolitans, and the white Persian cat fan club TV-newsletter What's New Pussycat, among others, with his signature overhead projector providing scrolling historical background on each show. L'Atelier national du Manitoba presented the history of locally produced, low-budget TV commercials in the feature-length video Kubasa in a Glass: the Fetishised Winnipeg TV Commercial 1976-1992. Barrow went on to continue collecting the work of 1980s cable access stars, and in 2009 Video Pool Media Arts Centre released, Winnipeg Babysitter, a DVD compendium of <b>cable</b> access <b>clips</b> featuring early performances of Guy Maddin, Marcel Dzama, Neil Farber, The Cosmopolitans, the Pollocks, and many more.|$|R
50|$|At {{the same}} time, Look {{introduced}} their Grand Prix heel binding. This was essentially {{one half of}} a Nevada system, turned sideways so it released vertically instead of to the sides. With cable bindings the heel was normally held down by looping the cable over the heel or cupped it in a semi-circular indentation {{on the back of}} the heel. To fit these different styles of binding points, and the fact that the boots had no standardized size or shape, the rotating portion of the Grand Prix was mounted on a bracket that lifted it above the heel flange, allowing the user to adjust its height. The actual binding point was a bronze roller sized to be similar to a standard <b>cable,</b> this could <b>clip</b> on top of the heel, or would fit into the indentation cut into the heel of some boots.|$|R
50|$|The use of {{cigarette}} lighter receptacles to supply 12 volt DC {{power is a}} classic example of backward compatibility to a de facto standard. The connector falls far short of ideal, being physically large and awkward to use, while being less reliable than alternatives such as the Anderson Powerpole connector (which is often used by amateur radio enthusiasts in mobile operations). Nevertheless, cigarette lighter receptacles are in widespread use, and all but the lowest-cost cars, trucks, RVs, and even boats can be expected to have at least one such receptacle. Portable cigarette lighter receptacles attached to <b>cables</b> and alligator <b>clips</b> for connection directly to car batteries are available for temporary use. In newer vehicles, one or more USB connectors may also be provided, as a source of modest amounts of 5 volt DC power, but even in these situations a cigarette lighter receptacle is provided for 12 volt DC power, and for applications that require higher amperage.|$|R
5000|$|... 1932: a major {{advance on}} the Huitfeldt concept was {{introduced}} to the market by Guido Reuge in 1932. Reuge replaced the heel strap with a metal cable connected to a spring {{at the front of the}} toe. The spring provided even tension as the boot moved. Previously, the strap was adjusted so it had enough slack to allow the boot to rotate as high as the skier wished, but as the boot rotated back down to the ski it became increasingly slack again. The cable removed this limitation, and held the boot firmly through its entire motion, greatly increasing the solidity of the fit. A later advance added two small metal clips near the rear of the foot that the <b>cable</b> could be <b>clipped</b> under. These held the boot firmly to the ski during downhill portions of the runs. Cable bindings remained in use for some time for cross-country, and are today popular for telemark skiing. However, the Rottefella design from the 1930s became more popular for Nordic skiing through the 1950s and into the 1970s until the Salomon Nordic System (SNS) binding entirely re-invented bindings used for Nordic skiing.|$|R
