Following bomb damage on 20 November 1940 during the Second World War, the slate roof of the engine shed was replaced with corrugated asbestos.

The next day, 28 June 1991, two Slovenian members of the Yugoslav Air Force (pilot Jože Kalan and the technician Bogo Šuštar) deserted from the Yugoslav People's Army and joined the Slovenian Territorial Defence forces with their helicopter (serial number JLV 12660). The helicopter received a new <b>code</b> <b>number,</b> T-001 Velenje and the Slovenian emblem, and was kept hidden in a private barn {{until the end of}} conflict in Slovenia. The Gazelles would see further action in the subsequent Yugoslav Wars and the Kosovo War; as Yugoslavia dissolved, the various successor states would inherit the SOKO-built Gazelles and continue to operate them, such as the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbian Air Force and Montenegro Air Force.|$|E
25|$|Villeneuve led {{the rest}} of his fleet into Cadiz on 21 August 1805, and the Sirius was sent to form part of the British fleet blockading them there. With Nelson's arrival to take command of the fleet, the main body was moved out to sea, with a chain of four frigates and four ships of the line {{established}} to observe the fleet in Cadiz and transmit signals about their movements to the British fleet. Sirius was the closest to the port and at first light on 19 October it was observed that the enemy were preparing to put to sea. Sirius immediately signalled the next frigate in the line, Henry Blackwood's , 'Enemy have their topsails hoisted'. Thus Prowse began the process that would lead to the interception of the combined fleet two days later. An hour later at 7 a.m. Sirius ran up three flags to signal <b>code</b> <b>number</b> 370, 'Enemy ships are coming out of port or getting under sail'. The signal was repeated down the line, reaching Nelson 48 miles away aboard HMS Victory at 9.30 a.m.|$|E
