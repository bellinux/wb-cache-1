Sixty program directors provided identifying characteristics about the facility, application information for internship and postdoctoral training, information on clientele and case load of trainees, and specific training information. In addition, respondents provided definitions of the two areas and suggested differentiating features. It was concluded that the similarities are more numerous than are the differences in training. Definitions suggest that (a) <b>clinical</b> child <b>psychology</b> has broader application than pediatric psychology despite the latter's broader principles of application, and (b) pediatric psychologists rely heavily on the traditional skills and techniques of <b>clinical</b> child <b>psychology.</b> The only differentiating features identified were in terms of medically related populations of children served, collaboration with health care disciplines, and a specialized focus of viewing psychological dif-ficulties within the medical culture by pediatric psychologists.
