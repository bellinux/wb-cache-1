After that, the player can communicate, battle, trade, etc., with Ruby and Sapphire.|$|E
5|$|The {{first known}} game {{incorporating}} graphics that updated in real time, rather than {{only when the}} player made a move, was a pool game programmed by William Brown and Ted Lewis specifically for {{a demonstration of the}} University of Michigan-developed MIDSAC <b>computer</b> <b>at</b> the University of Michigan in 1954. The game, developed over six months by the pair, featured a pool stick controlled by a joystick and a knob, and a full rack of 15 balls on a table seen in an overhead view. The computer calculated the movements of the balls as they collided and moved around the table, disappearing when they reached a pocket, and updated the graphics continuously, forty times a second, so as to show real-time motion. Like previous video games, the pool game was intended primarily to showcase the computing power of the MIDSAC computer.|$|E

5|$|Turing {{joined the}} National Physical Laboratory (NPL) in October 1945, {{by which time}} {{scientists}} within the Ministry of Supply had concluded that Britain needed a National Mathematical Laboratory to co-ordinate machine-aided computation. A Mathematics Division was set up at the NPL, and on 19 February 1946 Alan Turing presented a paper outlining his design for an electronic stored-program computer {{to be known as}} the Automatic Computing Engine (ACE). This was one of several projects set up in the years following the Second World War with the aim of constructing a stored-program <b>computer.</b> <b>At</b> about the same time, EDVAC was under development at the University of Pennsylvania's Moore School of Electrical Engineering, and the University of Cambridge Mathematical Laboratory was working on EDSAC.|$|E
5|$|Brown, though {{disappointed}} {{at being}} scooped, congratulated the Ortiz team on their discovery. He apologized for immediately overshadowing their announcement of Haumea with his announcement of Eris, {{and explained that}} someone had accessed their data and {{he was afraid of}} being scooped again. Ortiz did not volunteer to say that it had been he who accessed the data. Upon learning from web server records that it was a <b>computer</b> <b>at</b> the Sierra Nevada Observatory that had accessed his observation logs the day before the discovery announcement—logs which included enough information to allow the Ortiz team to precover Haumea in their 2003 images—Brown came to suspect fraud. He emailed Ortiz on August 9 and asked for an explanation. Ortiz did not respond, and on August 15 the Caltech team filed a formal complaint with the IAU, accusing the Ortiz team of a serious breach of scientific ethics in failing to acknowledge their use of the Caltech data, and asked the MPC to strip them of discovery status. Ortiz later admitted he had accessed the Caltech observation logs but denied any wrongdoing, stating this was merely part of verifying whether they had discovered a new object. Brown began to wonder if the Spanish team had actually identified Haumea at all before they saw his own abstract and telescope log.|$|E
5|$|Limited {{computer}} power: There was {{not enough}} memory or processing speed to accomplish anything truly useful. For example, Ross Quillian's successful work on natural language was demonstrated with a vocabulary of only twenty words, because {{that was all that}} would fit in memory. Hans Moravec argued in 1976 that computers were still millions of times too weak to exhibit intelligence. He suggested an analogy: artificial intelligence requires computer power {{in the same way that}} aircraft require horsepower. Below a certain threshold, it's impossible, but, as power increases, eventually it could become easy. With regard to computer vision, Moravec estimated that simply matching the edge and motion detection capabilities of human retina in real time would require a general-purpose computer capable of 109 operations/second (1000 MIPS). As of 2011, practical computer vision applications require 10,000 to 1,000,000 MIPS. By comparison, the fastest supercomputer in 1976, Cray-1 (retailing at $5 million to $8 million), was only capable of around 80 to 130 MIPS, and a typical desktop <b>computer</b> <b>at</b> the time achieved less than 1 MIPS.|$|E

40|$|M. Ed. The {{increasing}} use {{of information}} technology in education around the globe has raised important questions {{about the relationship between}} the educator and the computer. This study examined the educators' perception of the role of <b>computers</b> <b>at</b> the school, in teaching and learning, and their perception of the impact of <b>computer</b> implementation <b>at</b> the school in comparison with worldwide implementation. The data was drawn from several educators from a single school with varying perceptions about the role of <b>computers</b> <b>at</b> the school who participated in focus group interviews and allowed participant observation of the researcher at their school. Although all educators expected to benefit from <b>computer</b> implementation <b>at</b> the school, they felt that <b>computer</b> implementation <b>at</b> the school did not benefit them to their satisfaction due to lack of access to the computer room, relegation of computers to a single subject of computer literacy, lack of exposure, limited programs, and the context of the school (management) which were viewed as barriers to successful implementation of <b>computers</b> <b>at</b> the school. The study concludes that for educators to implement the use of computers in a constructive manner, they must have opportunities to (experiment) learn about computers (knowledge and skills) in a supportive climate that promotes staff development...|$|R

5|$|The {{graphics}} and sound of The Guardian Legend have been influential. Robert Dewar and Matthew Smosna {{of the open}} computing magazine Open Systems Today cited the game {{as an example of}} how graphics co-processors such as those in the NES can compensate for inadequate CPU speed in graphics-intensive computer applications. They noted that the fast-paced action seen in the game could not be replicated on a personal <b>computer</b> <b>at</b> that time (1992) without an expensive graphics board and regardless of CPU speed. The music of the game, composed by Masatomo Miyamoto and Takeshi Santo, has remained popular years after the game's release. Samantha Amjadali of the Melbourne-based newspaper The Herald Sun reported that a remixed tune from the game was rated as the second most popular track on the website OverClocked ReMix in March 2002. Video game cover band The Advantage's 2006 album Elf Titled featured a cover version of music from one of the game's dungeon levels.|$|E
