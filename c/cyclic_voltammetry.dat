5|$|The 18-valence {{electron}} rhodium(III) pentadienediyl species {{generated by}} this reaction demonstrates again {{the instability of}} the rhodocene moiety, in {{that it can be}} refluxed in toluene for months without 1,2,3-tri-tert-butylrhodocene forming but in oxidising conditions the 1,2,3-tri-tert-butylrhodocenium cation forms rapidly. <b>Cyclic</b> <b>voltammetry</b> has been used to investigate this and similar processes in detail. The mechanism of the reaction has been shown to involve a loss of one electron from the pentadienediyl ligand followed by a fast rearrangement (with loss of a hydrogen atom) to form the 1,2,3-tri-tert-butylrhodocenium cation. Both the tetrafluoroborate and hexafluorophosphate salts of this cation have been structurally characterised by X-ray crystallography.|$|E
5|$|The {{differences}} in reduction potentials is attributed in the cobaltocenium {{system to the}} inductive effect of the alkyl groups, further stabilising the 18-valence electron species. A similar effect {{is seen in the}} rhodocenium data shown above, again consistent with inductive effects. In the substituted iridocenium system, <b>cyclic</b> <b>voltammetry</b> investigations shows irreversible reductions at temperatures as low as −60°C; by comparison, the reduction of the corresponding rhodocenes is quasi-reversible at room temperature and fully reversible at −35°C. The irreversibility of the substituted iridocenium reductions is attributed to the extremely rapid dimerisation of the resulting 19-valence electron species, which further illustrates that iridocenes are less stable than their corresponding rhodocenes.|$|E
5|$|Octaphenylrhodocene, , is {{the first}} rhodocene {{derivative}} to be isolated at room temperature. Its olive green crystals decompose rapidly in solution, and within minutes in air, demonstrating a dramatically greater air sensitivity than the analogous cobalt complex, although it is significantly more stable than rhodocene itself. This difference is attributed to the relatively lower stability of the rhodium(II) state {{as compared to the}} cobalt(II) state. The reduction potential for the + cation (measured in dimethylformamide relative the ferrocenium / ferrocene couple) is −1.44V, consistent with the greater thermodynamic stabilisation of the rhodocene by the C5HPh4 ligand compared with the C5H5 or C5Me5 ligands. Cobaltocene is a useful one-electron reducing agent in the research laboratory as it is soluble in non-polar organic solvents, and its redox couple is sufficiently well behaved that it may be used as an internal standard in <b>cyclic</b> <b>voltammetry.</b> No substituted rhodocene yet prepared has demonstrated sufficient stability to be used in a similar way.|$|E

[1, 2] The head-end process of the pyroprocessing under development at KAERI includes disassembly and oxidative decladding steps, where cladding hull wastes are generated from the fuel rods.
