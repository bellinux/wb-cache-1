Its {{commerce}} was suffering {{due to a lack of}} autonomy under Venice, while it enjoyed considerable autonomy under the much more feudal Kingdom of <b>Croatia-Hungary.</b> A number of insurrections followed (1242-1243, 1320s, 1345-1346 - the latter resulted in a sixteen-month-long Venetian siege) which finally resulted in Zadar coming back under the crown of King Louis I of <b>Croatia-Hungary</b> under the Treaty of Zadar, in 1358. After the War of Chioggia between Genoa and Venice, Chioggia concluded on 14 March 1381 an alliance with Zadar and Trogir against Venice, and finally Chioggia became better protected by Venice in 1412, because Šibenik became in 1412 the seat of the main customs office and the seat of the salt consumers office with a monopoly on the salt trade in Chioggia and on the whole Adriatic Sea. After the death of Louis, Zadar recognized the rule of king Sigismund, and after him, that of Ladislaus of Naples. During his reign <b>Croatia-Hungary</b> was enveloped in a bloody civil war. In 1409, Venice, seeing that Ladislaus was about to be defeated, and eager to exploit the situation despite its relative military weakness, offered to buy his [...] "rights" [...] on Dalmatia for a mere 100,000 ducats. Knowing he had lost the region in any case, Ladislaus accepted. Zadar was, thus sold back to the Venetians for a paltry sum.|$|E

Prikazuje se kronologija širenja vlasti Šubića nad gradovima te prikazuje kako su oni koristili komunalne ustanove i prepuštanje vodećih položaja (potestata, kapetana i, iznimno, gradskih kneževa) kao sredstvo privlačenja pristalica među dalmatinskim plemstvom. The {{relationship}} between Croatian magnates and the nobility of medieval Dalmatian communes {{has not been}} neglected by Croatian historians. Already “the father of Croatian historiography” John Lučić-Lucius, himself a Trogir patrician, dedicated considerable attention to that topic, and so did medieval chroniclers-historians writing on the Croatian territories. Yet in spite, or perhaps precisely because, of that both the older and more recent Croatian historiography took a rather one-sided perspective. They observed the events from the urban perspective and so communicated to the readership an anachronistic and incorrect picture of the medieval reality. By doing so, they created an impression that Dalmatian communes {{were the most important}} and almost dominant factor in the polygon of forces that in the late Middle Ages emerged around them {{under the influence of the}} king of <b>Croatia-Hungary,</b> Croatian magnates, Venice and the towns themselves, headed by their nobilities. This historiographical problem becomes obvious when studying the history of the Croatian magnate kindred, the counts of Bribir, also known since the fourteenth century as the Šubić family. They are the most prominent heroes and anti-heroes of the mentioned medieval chronicles. This article will briefly outline the chronology of the events and describe the character of their relationships with Dalmatian communes and their nobilities. The members of the kindred first obtained committal posts in Dalmatian towns in the early thirteenth century. The rule over these urban communities became, from the 1220 s, an important item in the political plans of the leading family members: counts Višen, Gregory, Stephen, Stjepko, who succeeded in imposing their rule over the majority of the towns by the early 1250 s, as well as in acquiring the position of leading magnates in Croatia. Under Paul I and his brothers, the Šubić successfully legalized their position by Paul’s appointment as the ban of Croatia. In this period, all the towns in the area from Velebit to Omiš, with the exception of Zadar, came under their direct rule. The importance of that area further increased when the Šubići became directly involved in the dynastic crisis in the Kingdom of Hungary-Croatia. They became the most prominent supporters of the Neapolitan Anjou in the struggle for the crown, for which they needed an unimpeded maritime access to Southern Italy. Although the cities had tried to resist the excessively strong influence of Paul and his brothers until the mid- 1280 s, they soon realized that their opposition was futile and reconciled themselves with the situation. Moreover, the rule of the Šubići provided them with palpable benefits. The urban communities became part of a strong and well-organized territorial unit, which in turn provided conditions for their peaceful and safe development. The occasional lesser resistances of the cities to the policies of Ban Paul and his successor Ban Mladen II were not real rebellions and their causes were not grounded in political principles. Urban revolts would acquire the character of a rebellion only towards the end of Mladen’s rule in the early 1320 s, and even then they would be mostly caused by a changed external political situation and the course of events that did not favour the Šubić family. In contrast, the rule of the Šubić family over the cities for the most part did not step outside the predefined constitutional framework. In fact, it only replaced the weakened royal power. The organs of the urban autonomous governments continued to operate under a more or less strict control, while important steps towards the codification of statutory law—such as the statutes of Split, Šibenik and Skradin—took place precisely in that period. This era also saw considerable building activity in the towns under the rule of the Šubić family, much of it of representative character. The Šubić policy of recruiting urban noblemen into their clientele and entrusting them with tasks and positions within their oligarchy was of key importance. As a result, the family attracted supporters in the towns, while urban noblemen advanced in the social hierarchy of the Kingdom as well as of their respective cities, and changed the internal balance of power. The noblemen of Zadar had the greatest importance, but patricians of other cities, from Dalmatia as well as Central Italy, Venice and Adriatic, participated too. The article succinctly analyzes this group and provides a short prosopography of Dalmatian noblemen. It also tries to evaluate its importance regarding the development of contemporary events...|$|E

Razmatranje se nadovezuje na prikaz i raščlambu temeljnih značajki susljednih pobuna plemstva Ugarsko-Hrvatskoga Kraljevstva protiv vlasti Sigismunda Luksemburškoga krajem 14. i početkom 15. stoljeća te se uspostavlja korelacija između tih događaja i načina na koji je peteročlana upravljačka skupina svojim postupcima dovela do toga da je 1409. godine mletačka vlast i za njih i za zadarsku općinu praktično postala jedina moguća opcija. The author {{starts from}} the {{perceived}} {{discrepancy between the}} historiographic view of {{the circumstances in which}} Venice took the possession of Zadar in 1409 and the information obtained from archival sources, to examine the real events and to place them within the framework of a discussion {{of the relationship between the}} medieval state authority and the local power elites. In the first part of the essay, the author discusses the appearance of a group of five noblemen who in the course of the summer of 1401 succeeded in taking control of the political life of Zadar. The group included three noblemen whose conflict with the king of <b>Croatia-Hungary,</b> Sigismund, had forced them to leave the town. They returned to Zadar only after the rebellious Hungarian nobility had captured and imprisoned the King in the April of 1401. The author then analyzes the ways in which the remaining members of the group, two noblemen who had spent these four years in the town, could have been connected to the refugees. Looking at the circumstances in which the group of five took control of the political life of Zadar, the author concludes that the key to their success was probably the leading role they played in the repossession of the island of Pag, the centre of salt production and the foundation of the Zadar power, which had been taken from the town by the King in 1396. In the second part of the essay, the author uses the extant literature and reinterprets the printed and archival sources to redefine the successive waves of rebellion against the king Sigismund. He notices that the discontented nobility failed to find a common denominator and to establish an organization that would succeed in dethroning the monarch. The rebellion succeeded only when its organization was taken over, rather explicitly, by the Papal Curia, who had its own reasons for a confrontation with the king Sigismund. The author discusses the post- 1402 attempts of the organizers of the rebellion to recruit one of the most influential malcontents and the leader of the opposition to the King, the Bosnian Grand Duke Hrvoje Vukčić Hrvatinić, and outlines the reasons for the failure of these attempts. He furthermore discusses the behaviour of the Croatian and Slavonian nobility during these restless years, to define the frameworks in which the ruling elites of Mladen Ančić, Od tradicije “sedam pobuna” do dra 96 govoljnih mletačkih podanika Zadar would fit following their disobedience of the current king. In particular, the coronation of the royal counter-candidate Ladislas of Naples in Zadar in 1403 and its consequences are discussed. The author concludes that the coronation failed to fulfil the expectations of the mutinous Hungarian noblemen, who came to collect the new king, as well as of the Church groups who had organized the rebellion after 1402. He furthermore stresses that the coronation was organized to suit the interests of Ladislas of Naples and of the Bosnian Grand Duke, who, as a reward for his services to Ladislas, obtained the title of Herceg (dux Spaleti). In the third part of the essay, the author, availing himself of barely used sources, discusses the mechanisms that Ladislas of Naples and his main adherent on the East Adriatic Coast, the new Herceg of Split, used to tie the political leaders of Zadar to themselves. By using this strategy, they turned the most important East Adriatic town of this period into a stronghold and a secure point from which they could establish safe contacts. The author shows that Ladislas supported and helped the territorial expansion of the Zadar commune, and that he did so at the expense of Sigismund’s supporters. At the same time and in the same manner, the Herceg of Split secured the attachment of four out of five members of the group, who actually controlled the political life of the town: he gave them large estates that had been taken from the rival magnates and noblemen. In this way both the urban community and its leaders were put in a position in which they came to share the interests of the new king and the Herceg. In the concluding discussion, the author shows that it was precisely the fact that both the territorial expansion of the town and the accumulation of wealth in the hands of those who controlled the town were based on the gifts of the Sigismund’s supporters’ estates, significantly reduced the possible scenarios of resolving the political crisis. Both for the leading group in the town, and for the entire ruling social class, the re-establishment of Sigismund’s rule was out of question because it entailed a priori loss of everything obtained in the past seven years. At the same time, in spite of the rise during this period, the town did not grow sufficiently powerful to transform itself into a city-state. Under these circumstances, even the rule of Venice, against which the citizens of Zadar had, in the previous centuries, raised no less than seven rebellions and the opposition to which constituted an important element of the urban identity, was more acceptable than the return of Sigismund’s rule...|$|E
