25|$|Most cotton in the United States, Europe and Australia is {{harvested}} mechanically, {{either by}} a cotton picker, {{a machine that}} removes the cotton from the boll without damaging the cotton plant, or by a <b>cotton</b> <b>stripper,</b> which strips the entire boll off the plant. Cotton strippers are used in regions where it is too windy to grow picker varieties of cotton, and usually after application of a chemical defoliant or the natural defoliation that occurs after a freeze. Cotton is a perennial crop in the tropics, and without defoliation or freezing, the plant will continue to grow.|$|E

40|$|Cotton has {{consistently}} ranked {{as a leading}} cash crop in Texas. In 1997, Texas led the USA {{in the production of}} upland cotton and ranked second in the nation in the production of American pima cotton. Currently, 85 % of the harvested cotton in Texas is stripper harvested. The acreage of cotton produced in Texas leaves producers with questions concerning the most cost-effective method of cotton harvesting in individual situations. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the least costly harvesting system for strippers with and without bur extractors, by size of cotton operation in Texas.

40|$|The cotton picking as {{affected}} by the physical and mechanical properties was investigated. The tottowtng properties were studied: plant standing population, size and weight characteristics, volume weight under different stresses {{and the effect of}} cotton density on pressure drop, pulling force of bolls and raw cotton (mechanically and by suction aid, coefficient of friction, and the cutting force of cotton stem. It was found (for the cotton variety Giza 7. 5) that mechanical picking depend on the type of sowing <b>cotton</b> seeds. <b>Cotton</b> <b>strippers</b> should work at height not less than 40 em, while for cotton pickers the spindles should have 40 to 100 em in the first picking run and up to 140 cm height in the second run. Tile pulling force of bolls was 46 N and for raw cotton it was 0. 91 N. mathematical relationships were developed for the relationÂ¬ships between cotton density and stress, cotton density and pressure drop, and the air pulling force with cotton mass and air velocity. it was also found that the cutting speed of the knife should be greater than 2. 8 m/s in order to develop a cutting force greater than 800 N...|$|R
50|$|Through its research, the {{organization}} helped eradicate Texas fever, a bovine disease spread by ticks that threatened the state's cattle industry. In the 1920s, it conducted {{the first known}} studies on the crossbreeding of cattle, which {{went on to become}} a national practice still in use by the cattle industry. In 1931, Texas Agricultural Experiment Station developed the first mechanical <b>cotton</b> <b>stripper,</b> a machine that would become widely adopted by cotton farmers within a decade. The organization is a world leader in sorghum research, having begun with its developing the first known sorghum hybrid in 1955. In the 1950s, it also again came to the aid of the cattle industry by developing techniques for destroying screwworms which were plaguing cattle in Texas and Central America.|$|E
40|$|The Cotton Harvesting Cost Calculator (CHCC) is a {{web based}} program {{designed}} and developed to provide cotton producers a user-friendly means to accurately estimate the harvesting cost {{associated with a}} specific harvesting equipment configuration.

30|$|In {{addition}} to the impact at an individual level, rural user entrepreneurship is likely to make a significant impact at the society or community level. The products innovated and commercialized for the rural level improve the users' quality of life by having access to products that are usually considered as basic necessities in developed economies. In addition, the commercialization of innovated products may also provide health benefits {{in the form of}} reduced harmful impacts as seen in the case of <b>cotton</b> <b>stripper</b> machine and the nonstick clay tawa. The use of <b>cotton</b> <b>stripper</b> increased the production and improved the quality of cotton ready for ginning, which increased profitability. This suggests that the increased efficiency and productivity {{with the use of the}} product also leads to the economic prosperity of its users. Instances of such cross-pollination would be in line with the suggestions of World Bank's published research (Dutz 2007) on increasing India's innovation potential. The report suggests that supporting networks and institutions like NIF and others can promote grassroots level rural innovations, which are likely to assist in poverty alleviation and sustainable development (Utz and Dahlman 2007).|$|E

40|$|There are {{currently}} two main types of machinery used for harvesting cotton in the United States, cotton pickers and <b>cotton</b> <b>strippers</b> {{with or without}} field cleaners. These different machine types package seed cotton with varying amounts of burrs, sticks, and leaves. Harvested cotton is placed in modules for storage prior to ginning. Recent developments in the industry include on-board module builders that package seed cotton as they harvest. This leads to three methods of storage: 1) traditional seed cotton modules, 2) half-modules, and 3) round modules utilized by harvesters with on-board module builders; all of these have different levels of packaging density. Cotton is harvested under widely varying conditions {{throughout the country and}} the moisture content of seed cotton at the point of containerization can be an important factor in the final quality of the crop. Seed cotton is being stored for increasing periods of time before being processed by cotton gins. The number of cotton gins in the U. S. has decreased while the production of cotton has increased. All cotton is harvested as it matures and the harvesting rate greatly exceeds the ginning rate. As a consequence of fewer gins, increased harvesting rates and increased quantities of cotton, the storage time of seed cotton prior to ginning has increased. It is hypothesized that the impact of varying densities, varying trash contents, and increased storage times prior to ginning is impacting the quality of the cotton lint and seed. The goal of this research is to quantify the impacts of these factors. The purpose of this research is to evaluate the effects of packaging seed cotton from any of the three different harvesting methods into varying types of storage as a function of differing moisture content and increased storage time. Results are indicated in terms of quality of both the fiber and the seed of ginned samples, as well as how the quality changes affect the value of the processed cotton. Samples of seed cotton are sealed in plastic containers for up to three months at varying levels of moisture, density, and trash content. Temperature and oxygen levels are monitored during storage. Samples are ginned and cottonseed and fiber are analyzed. The results of this research indicate that density does not affect the final quality of the lint and seed harvested. Increased moisture contents {{have a negative effect on}} both the quality and the value of the seed cotton, and this effect becomes more pronounced as the length of storage increases...|$|R
30|$|Further, {{if we look}} at the {{traditional}} model of new product development, we find that it is a process that starts with the generation of ideas, which undergoes a number of iterations and finally lead to the commercial launch of new products (Cooper and Kleinschmidt 1993; Cooper 1996; Fox et al. 1998). This is in line with the findings from all our case studies. We find that the rural user develops an idea and initiates the process of user innovation by building a prototype or initial product, which undergoes a series of changes before it could be commercialized. The <b>cotton</b> <b>stripper</b> was modified seven times over a period of 10 years. The motorcycle-driven plough, biomass gasifier, mitticool refrigerator, and multicrop thresher were all modified multiple times during the commercialization process.|$|E
30|$|We {{find that}} the five rural user {{entrepreneurs}} not only experience economic but also social gains. All the five rural entrepreneurs are able to generate livelihood for themselves and earn money by selling their products. All of them report that by becoming an entrepreneur {{they have been able}} to move out of poverty. In four cases, we also see increased productivity and efficiency of work. For instance, Patel reported his <b>cotton</b> <b>stripper</b> brought down cotton stripping cost from US$ 0.02 per kg to US$ 0.02 per 20 kg. All the five user entrepreneurs state that their entrepreneurial career has impacted them at a personal level. It has helped build self-confidence and has instilled a sense of self-respect. They proudly report that their community also respects them now as they have received national level recognition through awards and media coverage. All of them report that their standard of living has improved and they are now able to provide school and college education to their children.|$|E
30|$|Through this {{research}} question {{we tried to}} explore whether there was any spillover effect of their entrepreneurial career on the society at large. We find {{that the creation of}} entrepreneurs, in our case rural user entrepreneurs, offers economic, social, and environmental gains for the society. Specifically, we find that customers get access to low-cost products like the mitticool refrigerator or the motorcycle-driven plough or low-cost biofuel. Two user entrepreneurs, namely, Patel and Kamboj, report their customers have experienced economic gains as reduced cost of production after using their machines. After analyzing the interview data of user entrepreneurs and the NIF chairman, we find that there is also a society-level impact like employment generation, improving quality of life for the poor, health benefits, and building a sense of pride in the community of the user entrepreneur. For example, Kamboj provides employment to 25 rural villagers in his small factory. Further, many rural women who bought Kamboj's machine have generated employment for themselves by processing and selling herbal products from their homes. Mitticool refrigerators offer cold water and food storage options to the poor. The <b>cotton</b> <b>stripper</b> offers health benefits by eliminating the harmful manual procedure traditionally used for cotton stripping.|$|E
40|$|Seed cotton {{transport}} {{from the}} field to the gin is currently accomplished by building modules and hauling them with a module truck. Costs of module transport have not been characterized fully. Engineering economic analyses were performed to develop equations {{that are used to}} estimate the cost of module transport based on various assumptions. The use of a semi-tractor trailer (STT) for seed cotton transport is a possibility for reducing costs. Equations also were developed for modeling STT transport costs. Within 15 miles from a gin, the cost of seed cotton transport is $ 60 per module truck load and $ 90 per STT load. Outside of 15 miles, the transport costs increased linearly and more rapidly for STT than module truck costs. However, it was assumed that STT would haul 50 % more seed cotton per load. The transportation costs of <b>stripper</b> <b>cotton</b> were higher than picker cotton. Comparisons of the module truck versus STT system costs were made using geographic information system (GIS) software. An ArcGIS project was developed using gin location, production areas, highway and road system, and other items of interest. A transport analysis routine in ArcGIS allowed for routing of modules from field to gin and determination of distances. The cost equations developed were used for comparing costs of module transport and STT transport. One transport example where ten fields of seed cotton were transported 150 miles one-way distance to the gin indicated that STT transport cost $ 9, 430 less than module truck transport...|$|R
