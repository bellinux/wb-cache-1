After the death of Aurangzeb, the Mughal Empire became weak and Murshid Quli Khan became the Nawab of Bengal, owning only nominal allegiance to the Mughal emperor. At that time Bardhaman was referred to as <b>chakla,</b> a change from the earlier pargana. Subsequently, during the reign of Alivardi Khan, the Bargis attacked and plundered Bardhaman.|$|E
25|$|Desmoulea {{remained}} at Suda Bay for several weeks, {{down on the}} sandy bottom by the stern, with its after well deck awash; the cargo {{was transferred to the}} tanker Eocene. Along with the torpedo attack on the cargo ship Clan Cumming by the Italian submarine Neghelli on 19 January, this was the only Italian success against British convoys in the Aegean Sea. After the action, Allied shipping made passage into the Aegean through the Antikithera Strait. Desmoulea was finally taken in tow by the armed boarding vessel HMS <b>Chakla</b> and escorted to Port Said by the anti-submarine trawlers HMS Lydiard and HMS Amber. The ship arrived on 6 May and moored off the western beacon of Suez, for use as a temporary storage vessel. It was torpedoed again on 3 August 1941, while awaiting repairs, by German bombers. Desmoulea was towed to Bombay, India and ran aground twice during the passage. Desmoulea was converted into a store ship, named Empire Thane and remained in port at Cochin until 1947, from where it was towed back to the United Kingdom. It was rebuilt under its original name in 1949, before being laid up in 1955 and scrapped in 1961.|$|E

Udaipur, in the south of Tripura, was the capital of the kingdom, until the king Krishna Manikya moved the capital to Old Agartala in the 18th century. [...] It was moved to the new city of Agartala in the 19th century.

5000|$|Furthermore, the Cantonment Act of 1864 {{provided}} for the establishment and extension of hospitals in cantonments. Women working in <b>chaklas</b> were often required to undergo medical examinations once a week, {{in order to examine}} them for traces of venereal diseases. Prostitutes were often confined against their wills in these prison hospitals, especially if they were found to have a venereal disease. [...] The Cantonment Act of 1864, originally meant for military bases, was eventually extended to the Presidencies and Provinces of British India. However, when military personnel were increasingly struck down by venereal diseases, more regulations were demanded. This eventually led to the Indian Contagious Disease Acts.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the governments}} of many Indian princely states had {{regulated}} prostitution prior to the 1860s, such regulation in British India was first ushered in by the Cantonment Act of 1864. The British sought to regulate prostitution {{as a matter of}} accepting a necessary evil. The Cantonment Acts regulated and structured prostitution in the British military bases. The structuring features of the Cantonment Acts provided for about twelve to fifteen Indian women for each regiment of British soldiers. Each regiment contained about a thousand soldiers. These women were kept in brothels called <b>chaklas.</b> They were licensed by military officials and were allowed to consort with soldiers only. Most of the women came from poor families and had no other opportunities for social or economic independence. The structural inequalities that pushed women into prostitution were often enforced by the colonial governments.|$|R

50|$|It {{was located}} in the eponymous <b>Chakla</b> region, near the {{historical}} border between Tibet and China. By the late 1200's, it had been founded around the city of Dartsedo, now known as Kangding. Due to its position, the town formed a trading centre for merchants from Tibet and China, who traded goods such as tea, traditional medicines, horses, and paper; for this reason the Ganden Phodrang government established a taxation regime in the kingdom, headed by a commissioner. The local kings resented the taxation coming from Lhasa, resulting in a rebellion in 1666, backed up by <b>Chakla</b> allying with the emerging Qing dynasty. Ganden Phodrang forces invaded five years later, followed by {{the murder of the}} king of <b>Chakla</b> by the commissioner in 1699.
