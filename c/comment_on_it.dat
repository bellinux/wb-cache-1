5|$|A bill {{setting out}} {{arrangements}} for funding and building the fleet was finalized in mid-July 1914. At {{this time the}} Navy had not yet settled on a final battleship design. It was planned that the first ship's keel would be laid in December 1914 and fitting out be completed sometime in 1918. The bill was not immediately introduced into parliament, however, as Idenburg was given until 10 August to <b>comment</b> <b>on</b> <b>it.</b> The outbreak of the First World War led to the bill being withdrawn due to the uncertain international circumstances and the impossibility of buying battleships from foreign shipbuilders in wartime. Instead, the Government ordered three s in 1915, though only two were completed.|$|E
5|$|Noriega {{took control}} of most major {{newspapers}} by either buying a controlling stake in them, or by forcing them to shut down. The government also harassed, intimidated, or exiled individual journalists and editors. The newspaper La Prensa, which remained independent and was frequently critical of Noriega, had its staff intimidated and its offices damaged; eventually, it too was forced to close. In May 1984, Noriega allowed the first presidential elections in 16 years. Noriega and Díaz Herrera picked Nicolás Ardito Barletta Vallarino to be the PRD's candidate, {{with the intention of}} keeping him under close control. When the initial results showed Arias, who had the support of much of the opposition, {{on his way to a}} landslide victory, Noriega halted the count. After brazenly manipulating the results, the government announced that Barletta had won by a slim margin of 1,713 votes. Independent estimates suggested that Arias would have won by as many as 50,000 votes had the election been conducted fairly. More than 60,000 votes were not included in the final count. The U.S. government was aware of this manipulation, but chose not to <b>comment</b> <b>on</b> <b>it.</b> Noriega's rule became increasingly repressive, even as the U.S. government of Ronald Reagan began relying on him in its covert efforts to undermine Nicaragua's Sandinista government. The U.S. accepted Barletta's election, and signaled a willingness to cooperate with him, despite recognizing the flaws in the election process.|$|E

Paulson said releasing a partial transcript was possible. The same day, CBC News reported that Centre Block security video showed that Zehaf-Bibeau had been shot once in an exchange of gunfire with Commons security before running along the Hall of Honour towards the Library of Parliament. On December 3, the Toronto Star, National Post and Winnipeg Free Press major newspapers called for the videos to be released.|$|E

500|$|Burns was incredulous that Emma and Carl {{had not yet}} consummated their four-month-old marriage, {{and criticized}} their going to a {{substitute}} teacher for relationship advice, something that Benigno also found stupid. Slezak and VanDerWerff disliked the episode's portrayal of Emma, since the recently seen [...] "stronger, less neurotic, and altogether more appealing Emma", as Slezak put it, was inconsistent with her depiction here. One of the few positive comments was from Canning, who singled out Emma's ignorance of what an [...] "afternoon delight" [...] actually was. The reviewers were more enthusiastic about the pairing of Puck and Lauren, though somewhat divided. MTV's Emily Exton called them her [...] "favorite couple of the evening" [...] and cited [...] "the ridiculous logic that they share". Canning called their scenes [...] "a hoot", though Benigno said he was [...] "still not buying" [...] the relationship. A third couple, that of the resurrected pairing of Finn and Quinn, was in Harper's [...] "didn't love" [...] column, and VanDerWerff couldn't bring himself to care enough to <b>comment</b> <b>on</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

[...] Cecil was already aware of certain stirrings, although he did not then know the exact nature of the plot or who exactly was involved. [...] Instead of informing the king immediately, he decided to wait and watch what happened. [...] Catesby's reaction to news of the letter's existence was somewhat different; he and Wintour suspected Francis Tresham was its author and the two went to confront him. [...] Tresham managed to convince them of his innocence, all the while urging them to abandon the plot. [...] Percy reacted to the news by declaring that he was ready to [...] "abide the uttermost trial". [...] He may have visited the infant Prince Charles on 1 November, indicating perhaps that some rearrangement of the plan was being considered.

500|$|After {{filming the}} {{underwater}} shots, Cameron began writing the screenplay. He wanted {{to honor the}} people who died during the sinking, so he spent six months researching all of the Titanics crew and passengers. [...] "I read everything I could. I created an extremely detailed timeline of the ship's few days and a very detailed timeline of the last night of its life," [...] he said. [...] "And I worked within that to write the script, and I got some historical experts to analyze what I'd written and <b>comment</b> <b>on</b> <b>it,</b> and I adjusted it." [...] He paid meticulous attention to detail, even including a scene depicting the Californians role in Titanic demise, though this was later cut (see below). From the beginning of the shoot, they had [...] "a very clear picture" [...] of what happened on the ship that night. [...] "I had a library that filled one whole wall of my writing office with Titanic stuff, because I wanted it to be right, especially {{if we were going to}} dive to the ship," [...] he said.

500|$|The episode [...] "What Was Missing" [...] became {{controversial}} {{because of}} an allegedly implied past relationship between Marceline and Princess Bubblegum. The controversy largely began after an accompanying [...] "Mathematical" [...] recap—a studio-endorsed behind the scenes video series implied that there were lesbian relations between Princess Bubblegum and Marceline and that the writing staff actively seeks input from fans. This incident was addressed by the show's producer, Fred Seibert, who said that [...] "in {{trying to get the}} show’s audience involved we got wrapped up by both fan conjecture and spicy fanart and went a little too far." [...] Soon after, the video recap and the entire channel was pulled off of YouTube, although [...] "What Was Missing" [...] still airs during reruns. Seibert's decision to remove the video also proved controversial; Bitch magazine later wrote an article about how the episode [...] "handled female desire—female queer desire at that—in a subtle but complex way", but that the removal of the recap and the studio's perceived treatment of the controversy was detrimental towards the acceptance of queer romance in children's television. Ward later addressed the issue and gave a more neutral view; he said that, because there were [...] "so many extreme positions taken on it all over the Internet", he did not [...] "really want to <b>comment</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> [...] it was a big hullaballoo." [...] In August 2014, Olson commented on the controversy, telling a crowd of fans gathered at a Barnes & Noble book signing from The Adventure Time Encyclopedia, that, according to Ward, Marceline and Princess Bubblegum had dated in the past, but that because the series airs in some areas where homosexual relationships are illegal, the show {{has not been able to}} officially make clear the relationship in the series itself.|$|E
500|$|Merryman had a {{relationship}} with stock car racing driver Jeff Gordon. She first met Gordon in 2000 while she was employed in Palm Beach, Florida at a Neiman Marcus store in a mall where she advised customers about cosmetics products. Merryman did not recognize the race-car driver at their first meeting, though her friends were excited to meet him during the same encounter. Initially Merryman turned down Gordon's request to take her out for lunch. One year after their initial encounter, they began {{a relationship}}. They were romantically-linked for 11 months. Merryman and Gordon vacationed together in Saint-Jean, Saint Barthélemy in the Caribbean in January 2003 to celebrate the New Year. This relationship caused difficulty for his then-ongoing marriage to Brooke Sealy. Sealy discovered Gordon's relationship with Merryman and subsequently divorced the race-car driver. Gordon's wife, who also went by the name Jennifer Brooke Gordon, cited Merryman by name in her divorce papers with the racecar driver. Merryman was featured in the October 2003 issue of Playboy magazine, where she was interviewed about her relationship with Gordon. Merryman stated that Gordon had confided in her: [...] "He got married when he was 23 and has been on the racetrack since he was a kid. He used to tell me all the time he {{never had a chance to}} have fun." [...] She reflected on what she had learned after her period of time with Gordon, saying in the future she would avoid relationships both with men of his occupation and those who were married. Gordon did not comment on Merryman's 2003 appearance in the magazine. When asked about the article, Gordon refused to <b>comment</b> <b>on</b> <b>it.</b> He stated: [...] "It's not even worth commenting on. All I want to talk about is being fast". Gordon's divorce was finalized in June 2003.|$|E
