The first night's programming began, at Bernstein's insistence, with a homage to the BBC, whose public broadcasting pedigree he had always admired, and closed with a public-spirited statement of advertising policy which suggested an ambivalence about the commercial imperative to maximise profits.|$|E

5000|$|Child and Family Wellness shops (CFW Shops [...] ) is {{a social}} {{entrepreneurship}} project to deliver franchise pharmacy chains to developing countries. The franchise is run by locally trained health care entrepreneurs. The franchisee is self-motivated to run the business with a goal to serve the poor. Current franchise locations are concentrated in Kenya, but goals are to set up franchises all over Africa. Entrepreneurs are required to pay a $300 franchise fee to open their first franchise. The central office offers business training, marketing, medicine transportation and micro loans to get the shops outfitted with medicine. Over a million patients have been served with the CFW shops franchise, however, this million is {{only a fraction of}} patients requiring medication in developing countries. CFW shops was created in response to a publication that 25000 children die each day in the world due to lack of access to medication. CFW distribution system of franchising established strict rules of consistency and quality in an effort to boycott the counterfeit medication market. Most of the stores have a trained nurse on staff. CFW shops do not distribute antiretroviral drugs. CFW shops focus on widespread but cheaper options to treat diseases like malaria. Some of the CFW nurses make house calls and assist patients in their social life. The CFW franchisee is for profit while the franchisor a not-for-profit organization funded by charitable donations. In an effort to popularize the CFW brand, the CFW shops also conduct free medical screening and demonstrate water purification techniques for the community. Since the CFW is part NGO, part <b>commercial</b> <b>franchise,</b> charitable donations will go to a separate account that will pay directly for treatment at the stores. CFW is a typical example of using franchising as a social tool.|$|E

40|$|Social {{franchising}} {{is primarily}} a method to transfer knowledge from one established enterprise to another that wants {{to achieve the same}} social and economic goals. The social franchise is an adaptation of a <b>commercial</b> <b>franchise</b> in which the developer of a successfully tested social concept (franchisor) ena-bles others (franchisees) to replicate the model using the tested system and the brand name to achieve a social benefit. In fact, social franchising combines social objectives (sharing learning and methodologies for greater social impact) with economic objectives. This link is the reason that many consider social fran-chising to be a potential tool for the growth of social farming initiatives that introduce the co-production of private and public values. The paper opens with an overview of social franchising.

40|$|Billions {{of dollars}} are spent to develop drugs for {{infectious}} diseases in developing countries. How will these drugs along with clinical services be delivered to the patients who currently {{do not have access}} to them? Health franchises have been around since early 1990 s, creating networks of shops and clinics that provide specialized care to low income individuals. This thesis attempts to understand the underlying mechanisms of successful health franchises. Two cases are taken into consideration, CFWshops in Kenya and Mi Farmacita Nacional (MFN) in Mexico. Both are pharmaceutical shops with small clinics attached to them. The two cases were examined through a framework derived from successful <b>commercial</b> <b>franchises</b> and franchise theory. The elements that were addressed include operational structure, marketing strategy, product and service offerings, monitoring of businesses, and financial structure. CFWshops and MFN had some stark differences in how they addressed each of these elements. Unlike typical <b>commercial</b> <b>franchises,</b> health franchises aim to provide social benefits to the population. This goal requires franchises to not only create a business strategy to be financially sustainable and take advantage of networks, but also show health improvements in the community. The success of a health franchise is dependent on the health impacts it provides because its mission is not to generate a profit for the stakeholders but rather the value added to the customer by providing access that was not there before. (cont.) The comparative case analysis suggests several key recommendations. Health innovations in resource limited settings should create networks with other public and private health groups to leverage existing knowledge and best practices. This reduces cost and time of learning and allows businesses to utilize existing channels to provide access for drugs and services to individuals who currently are not receiving them. by Ramya Sankar.

40|$|Introducing a {{technology}} push to stimulate entrepreneurship {{in remote areas}} in developing countries can be examined {{in the context of}} a franchising model (social or <b>commercial</b> <b>franchising).</b> The results of this study (fieldwork in Kalimantan, Indonesia) point to a high feasibility of introducing {{a technology}} push by a franchising model. The results indicate that the smallholder rubber farmers (community level) and the head of villages, head of district and the government departments (low, middle and high institutional level) support a technology push and are willing to participate. Furthermore almost all stakeholders prefer a franchising model to introduce a technology push with social franchising elements. Additionally, empirical evidence confirmed the main theoretical argument of this research: a technology push carried out by a franchising model can stimulate (social) entrepreneurship in remote villages. This study thus concluded that in order to stimulate (social) entrepreneurship in local communities and with that local economic development, a hybrid franchising (a combination of both <b>commercial</b> and social <b>franchising)</b> model should be used to carry a technology push...|$|R
