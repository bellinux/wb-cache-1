40|$|The {{action of}} the β-lactam antibiotics, penicillin-G (PCG) and <b>cefoselis</b> (CFSL) on GABAA receptors (GABAA-R) was {{investigated}} using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique and Xenopus oocyte expressed murine GABAA-R. Murine GABAA-Rs were expressed in Xenopus oocytes by injecting cRNA that encoded for each subunit (α 1, β 2, and γ 2) {{and the effects of}} PCG and CFSL on the α 1 β 2 γ 2 s subunit receptors were examined using two-electrode voltage clamp. Using the α 1 β 2 γ 2 s GABAA-R, PCG and CFSL inhibited GABA-induced currents in a concentration-dependent manner, with IC 50 s of 557. 1 ± 125. 4 and 185. 0 ± 26. 6 [*]μM, respectively. The inhibitory action of PCG on GABA-induced currents was non-competitive whereas that of CFSL was competitive. Mutation of tyrosine to phenylalanine at position 256 in the β 2 subunit (β 2 Y 256 F), which is reported to abolish the inhibitory effect of picrotoxin, drastically reduced the potency of PCG (IC 50 = 28. 4 ± 1. 42 [*]mM) for the α 1 β 2 Y 256 Fγ 2 s receptor without changing the IC 50 of CFSL (189 ± 26. 6 [*]μM). These electrophysiological data indicate that PCG and CFSL inhibit GABAA-R in a different manner, with PCG acting non-competitively and CFSL competitively. The mutational study indicates that PCG might act on an identical or nearby site to that of picrotoxin in the channel pore of the GABAA-R...|$|E
40|$|Various Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO 1 NfxB mutants were {{isolated}} on agar plates containing cefpirome and ofloxacin. They were classified into type A and type B, {{based on the}} degrees of changes in their susceptibilities. Type A mutants were four to eight times more resistant to ofloxacin, erythromycin, and new zwitterionic cephems, i. e., cefpirome, cefclidin, cefozopran, and <b>cefoselis,</b> than was the parent strain, PAO 1. In contrast, type B mutants were more resistant to tetracycline and chloramphenicol, as well as ofloxacin, erythromycin, and the new zwitterionic cephems, than was PAO 1, and they were four to eight times more susceptible to carbenicillin, sulbenicillin, imipenem, panipenem, biapenem, moxalactam, aztreonam, gentamicin, and kanamycin that was PAO 1. The changes in susceptibilities of type B mutants were greater than those of type A mutants. The susceptibilities of both type A and type B mutants were restored {{to the level of}} PAO 1 by transformation with plasmid pNF 111, which contained the wild-type nfxB gene, demonstrating that they are NfxB mutants. Immunoblot analysis with a monoclonal antibody to OprJ revealed that type B mutants produced larger amounts of outer membrane protein OprJ than did type A mutants and that PAO 1 produced an undetectable amount of it. Moreover, transconjugants obtained with the different types of NfxB mutants as the donor strains showed almost the same phenotypes as the corresponding donor strains. These results suggest that {{there are at least two}} nfxB mutations that show different phenotypes and that production of OprJ is associated with changes in susceptibilities of NfxB mutants...|$|E
