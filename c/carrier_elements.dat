50|$|Typically, the {{avoidance}} of point solutions provides flexibility for a given system to provide variable capabilities. Designing a cargo carrier that mixes pressurized and unpressurized systems can lead to increased cost if all associated cargo accommodations must be flown on every flight. To avoid unnecessary costs associated with designing and flying structure that accommodates fixed relative capacities {{of all types of}} payloads, a modular approach is taken for CPS.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the approach taken {{to building a}} low-cost, modular spacecraft bus {{that can be used}} to support a variety of technology experiments in different space environments. It describes the techniques used and design drivers considered to ensure experiment independence from as yet selected host spacecraft. It describes the technology experiment carriers that will support NASA's Living With a Star Space Environment Testbed space missions. NASA has initiated the Living With a Star (LWS) Program to develop a better scientific understanding to address the aspects of the connected Sun-Earth system that affect life and society. A principal goal of the program is to bridge the gap between science, engineering, and user application communities. The Space Environment Testbed (SET) Project is one element of LWS. The Project will enable future science, operational, and commercial objectives in space and atmospheric environments by improving engineering approaches to the accommodation and/or mitigation of the effects of solar variability on technological systems. The SET Project is highly budget constrained and must seek to take advantage of as yet undetermined partnering opportunities for access to space. SET will conduct technology validation experiments hosted on available flight opportunities. The SET Testbeds will be developed in a manner that minimizes the requirements for accommodation, and will be flown as flight opportunities become available. To access the widest range of flight opportunities, two key development requirements are to maintain flexibility with respect to accommodation constraints and to have the capability to respond quickly to flight opportunities. Experiments, already developed to the technology readiness level of needing flight validation in the variable Sun-Earth environment, will be selected on the basis of the need for the subject technology, readiness for flight, need for flight resources and particular orbit. Experiments will be accumulated by the Project and manifested for specific flight opportunities as they become available. The SET Carrier is designed to present a standard set of interfaces to SET technology experiments and to be modular and flexible enough to interface to a variety of possible host spacecraft. The Carrier will have core components and mission unique components. Once the core <b>carrier</b> <b>elements</b> have been developed, only the mission unique components need to be defined and developed for any particular mission. This approach will minimize the mission specific cost and development schedule for a given flight opportunity. The standard set of interfaces provided by SET to experiments allows them to be developed independent of the particulars of a host spacecraft. The Carrier will provide the power, communication, and the necessary monitoring features to operate experiments. The Carrier will also provide all of the mechanical assemblies and harnesses required to adapt experiments to a particular host. Experiments may be hosted locally with the Carrier or remotely on the host spacecraft. The Carrier design will allow a single Carrier to support a variable number of experiments and will include features that support the ability to incrementally add experiments without disturbing the core architecture...|$|E
40|$|The Continuously fed Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR) is {{a popular}} design for {{anaerobic}} treatment of wastewater. This reactor type is simple in design and operation, independent of biomass type and low in capital costs. The CSTR has, however, to be operated at long Hydraulic Retention Times (HRT) {{of the order of}} 16 to 30 days since biomass is continuously lost with the effluent. Various alternate concepts of reactor design have, therefore, been developed to allow more rapid treatment. Treatment can be enhanced by retaining biomass within the digester so that the HRT is decoupled from solid biomass retention time (SRT). Unlike in continuous stirred tank digesters where the SRT is equal to HRT, the SRT in other designs are much greater than the HRT. This allows the wastewater to be treated at high throughputs while retaining the biocatalyst (or biomass) mediating the treatment within the digester. In this study the operation of a CSTR was intensified by separating SRT from HRT while taking into account the economical aspects. The intensification of operation is defined as increasing wastewater throughput or organic loading rate {{while at the same time}} maintaining efficiency of treatment and robustness to reject disturbances (changes in wastewater concentration and flow rate). The operation of existing CSTR was intensified by addition of carriers. It is hypothesized that by providing surfaces (or carriers) for bacterial attachment within the continuous stirred tank digester, biomass will be better retained and the wastewater throughput can be increased. The carriers or surfaces employed in this study were light <b>carrier</b> <b>elements</b> (shredded granular rubber tire having a density of 0. 96 g/cm 3) that move gently with the water in the reactor. This carrier material is much cheaper compared with other commercial carrier materials. This reactor type, called an Anaerobic Moving Bed Reactor (AMBR), was applied in this study to treat high strength synthetic wastewater, containing molasses as the main substrate. The improvement of reactor performance was clearly shown by the capability of the system to be operated without any difficulties at HRT of 6 days at an OLR of 5. 8 g COD/l/d or at HRT of 1 day at an OLR of 4 g COD/l/d. The carriers were shown to be effective in retaining biomass aggregates. The AMBR was further intensified by changing the feeding strategy. It was shown that in stirred tank digester without carriers an intermittent feeding strategy resulted in better microbial capacity to degrade higher chain volatile fatty acids like propionic and butyric acids than the continuous feeding mode. An increase in degrading capacity of the intermittently fed digester was shown via degradation rates of pulse additions of propionic and butyric acids and by its capability of handling all changes in loading rates imposed. The continuously fed digester, receiving constant feed, on the other hand, suffered more when loading rates were changed, and the degradation rates of propionic and butyric acids were slower. The intermittent feeding mode was then implemented on the AMBR, and it was operated as a sequencing batch reactor with a fill, react, settle and decant period in each cycle. The sequencing batch mode when applied to the AMBR (now called an Anaerobic Moving Bed Sequencing Batch Reactor or AMBSBR) could increase capability of the digester to handle higher shock loads. At 3. 8 d HRT the AMBSBR could handle an OLR of 10. 8 g COD/l/d as opposed to 7. 4 g COD/l/d by the AMBR. At 2. 5 d HRT the AMBSBR could handle an OLR of 6. 4 g COD/l/d while the AMBR could only be loaded at an OLR of 4. 2 g COD/l/d. The ratio of SRT to HRT was at least 15 for this reactor. The reactor was able to handle concentrated feed flow rates at longer cycles or more dilute feed flow rates at frequent shorter cycles. The proposed operational strategies were verified by using a structured mathematical model which was developed based on the IWA ADM 1 model. Several modifications were implemented to the model to obtain better predictions. The modified model was capable in predicting all the trends of the operating variables from both continuously and intermittently fed reactors. None of the two model versions (ADM 1 and modified models) was, however, able to predict the increased propionate degradation capacity in intermittently fed digesters. The reason for this was the assumption of fixed stoichiometry of fermentative reactions for glucose mineralisation. By modifying the fractions of glucose mineralisation a better fit between experimental results and the model could be obtained...|$|E
30|$|Co-precipitation {{method is}} one of the {{effective}} techniques for the determination of trace heavy metal ions among the separation–preconcentration–separation techniques (Duan et al. 2003). Co-precipitation technique usually involves carrying down by the precipitate of desired <b>elements</b> with a <b>carrier</b> <b>element</b> (a substance that has similar crystalline structure and that can aid the incorporation of the desired element from the sample matrix into solution) especially if the trace elements to be determined is too dilute and cannot be precipitated by any conventional means (Tchounwou et al. 2012). The technique is effective in that it is fast, simple, and numerous analyte ions can be preconcentrated and separated from the matrix concurrently. Organic and inorganic co-precipitants have been reported for co-precipitation of heavy metal ions at trace levels from environmental samples (Elci et al. 2003). Inorganic ligands reported as co-precipitants in literatures were hydroxide, thiocyanate, phosphates and organic ligands were dibenzyldithiocarbamate, N-benzoyl-N-phenyl-hydroxylamine, 2 -nitroso- 1 -napththol- 4 sulfonic acid (Chen et al. 1997; Depecker et al. 2009; Tuzen and Soylak 2009; Uluozlu et al. 2010; Vircavs et al. 1994; Zhang et al. 2010).|$|R
