5|$|A police {{investigation}} was initiated in October 1971 to uncover any criminal action {{taken by the}} company. Tjøntveit announced in December 1971 that he had established a new airline—Norwegian Overseas Airways (NOA)—which intended to operate freight routes using the Lockheed L-100 Hercules. The {{police investigation}} quickly established that there were shortcomings in Trans Polar's bookkeeping {{and that there were}} several violations of aviation regulations. However, they police had difficulty establishing who was responsible in the company. As Tjøntveit was no longer a Norwegian citizen, he was prohibited from holding management and board positions in the airline. Still, it was obvious that he had been <b>calling</b> <b>the</b> <b>shots.</b> Because NOA could not obtain Scandinavian operating permits, it moved its operations to Bangladesh—hindering the police from interviewing Tjøntveit and other central managers in Trans Polar who had joined the new airline. The police also stated that the investigation took too long because they had too few investigators with expertise in financial crime.|$|E

Dale Jr. managed to finish 12th at Dover for the Autism Speaks 400 with his new crew chief after contending for the lead. At Pocono Raceway, however, he again ended with a 27th-place finish. After the change in crew chiefs, Earnhardt was consistently better, finishing fifteenth at Chicagoland Speedway; however, during that time he also had one DNF at Daytona International Speedway where he was taken out of the race early in a large pileup.|$|E

5000|$|Living on Colorado’s Western Slope defined Aspinall’s {{political}} ideology. His {{family had}} traditionally voted Republican, but the party’s in-fighting in 1912 between Theodore Roosevelt and William H. Taft disillusioned Aspinall. However, despite becoming a Democrat, his rural roots shaped a relatively conservative philosophy. He believed in limited federal involvement in western {{land and water}} issues; to him, localities could better decide the uses of their resources. “When I was young…I lived outside {{the little town of}} Palisade, and the townspeople always seemed to <b>call</b> <b>the</b> <b>shots.</b> Then I moved to Palisade, and the bigger town of Grand Junction always seemed to <b>call</b> <b>the</b> <b>shots.</b> Then I went to the state Legislature, and the Eastern Slope…seemed to <b>call</b> <b>the</b> <b>shots.</b> And in Congress, the big metropolitan areas seemed to hold all the marbles.” ...|$|R

500|$|Known for his charisma, personality, and iconic stature on the court, Rudolph symbolized NBA officiating {{during the}} early years of the NBA to fans of {{professional}} basketball and became the most recognizable official during the NBA's first four decades. [...] Bob Ryan of The Boston Globe said of Rudolph, [...] "If any man other than Red Auerbach ever earned the title of NBA institution, it was certainly Mendy Rudolph." [...] Upon retirement, he set a precedent for the standards that future referees are judged. [...] Early in his officiating career, Joe Crawford (later hired by the NBA in 1977) attended games that Rudolph worked in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and studied his style and approach. [...] Earl Strom credited Rudolph for being an influence on the development of his career in the NBA. [...] In his autobiography, <b>Calling</b> <b>the</b> <b>Shots,</b> Strom described Rudolph as [...] "one of the most prominent referees because of his style, courage, and judgment. [...] He had excellent judgment. [...] He made the call regardless of the pressure, whom it involved, or where it was."

500|$|There were complaints, however, {{that the}} {{documentary}} did not depict {{enough of the}} political aspects of the Iraqi War. Farhi said, [...] "The 90-minute documentary doesn't say much about the larger issues facing Iraq, but it does capture some small and captivating human stories.... They happen to live in what one boy describes as 'the most dangerous city on Earth.' You don't see much of Iraq's violence in Baghdad High, but you surely feel its gravity and their dread." [...] The Boston Heralds Mark Perigard said that he felt the documentary was [...] "a personal story, not a political one". In The New York Times, Mike Hale commented, [...] "While the boys talk frequently about violence and despair, they rarely discuss politics or ethnic differences (with the exception of Anmar, the Christian) and they almost never directly address the American presence. We do hear some parental opinions, which are surprisingly neutral. One mother says: 'We shouldn't blame the Americans for everything. There {{is something wrong with}} us too'." [...] Jennifer Marin, a culture columnist from the Los Angeles Times, wrote at About.com, that while it was innovative, informative and a noble experiment, the footage is [...] "undistinguished and rough because the hands holding the cameras weren't skilled and the eyes framing the shots were not those of artists or keen observers." [...] She thought that, with the exception of Mohammad, the boys lacked charisma, and that the film failed to capture the drama of living in a war-zone, {{due to the lack of}} a director <b>calling</b> <b>the</b> <b>shots.</b> Perigard said, [...] "After the time you've invested , it's not nearly satisfying enough. For all the questions this fascinating film raises, it might as well be written in sand." ...|$|E

It also describes his fractious relationship with the South African captain Graeme Smith. Vaughan alleged that Smith had called him [...] a [...] "queer" [...] and Andrew Flintoff a [...] "big baby". Moreover, Smith acted as a witness during the trial of Vaughan's case with match-referee Clive Lloyd, where Vaughan had mildly rebuked the umpires for having called off play in bright conditions the previous day during a Test match in Johannesburg, South Africa, which resulted in Vaughan being fined his entire match-fee. Afterwards he started referring to Smith as 'The Witness', and also accused him of playing to the cameras.|$|E
2500|$|In early November 2009, Palin {{said that}} despite other's prior denials that it {{contained}} [...] "death panels", {{the health care}} legislation voted on by the U.S. House of Representatives had a [...] "provision mandating bureaucratic panels that will be <b>calling</b> <b>the</b> <b>shots</b> regarding who will receive government health care". In an interview with Barbara Walters, Palin acknowledged {{that none of the}} health care bills included the actual word pair; [...] "No, death panel isn't there." [...] In November 2009, when asked about how she came up with the term [...] "death panels," [...] Palin said, [...] "To me, while reading that section of the bill, it became so evident {{that there would be a}} panel of bureaucrats who would decide on levels of health care, decide on those who are worthy or not worthy of receiving some government-controlled coverage. Since health care would have to be rationed if it were promised to everyone, it would therefore lead to harm for many individuals not able to receive the government care. That leads, of course, to death." [...] Palin also clarified that, [...] "The term I used to describe the panel making these decisions should not be taken literally." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{timing of}} the album, between Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young reunions, {{the fact that it}} was {{produced}} by David Crosby, and the presence of the individual band members' names on the album cover has led to the suggestion that the album was something of a substitute for CSNY. [...] For his part, Crosby's motivation for taking over production duties on the album may have been an attempt to finally exert dominance over the rest of the band, as he had tried to do during his earlier tenure with The Byrds. [...] McGuinn certainly supported this viewpoint, as he revealed in a 1977 interview: [...] "Crosby was <b>calling</b> <b>the</b> <b>shots.</b> It was his coup d'état. He wanted to minimize my importance in the group, and maximize his, and other people's." [...] In Crosby's defense, it is worth noting that both McGuinn and Hillman were actively touring between recording sessions for the album, the former with the Columbia version of The Byrds and the latter with Manassas. [...] With only sporadic availability of two of the band's four creative parties, the brunt of assembling the album was left to the otherwise unengaged Crosby and Clark, which could account for the preponderance of Clark vocals and the CSNY-esque production on the album.|$|E

2500|$|The {{seventh and}} final season, {{consisting}} of 13 episodes, begins with Michael receiving an assignment from Andrew Strong (Jack Coleman), a high-ranking CIA official {{with whom he}} made the deal that got his team and Maddie set free. Strong made the deal because he believes Michael {{is the only person}} he can entrust with a dangerous mission that involves thwarting an American named Randall Burke (Adrian Pasdar) believed to be running freelance terror operations. Fiona has moved on to a new job with her new bounty hunter boyfriend. Sam and Jesse continue to help Michael despite, or perhaps because of, intrusions on their personal and professional lives. Maddie, meanwhile, is trying to get custody of Nate's son, Charlie, to keep him out of foster care. It turns out Burke {{is part of a larger}} organization, and he sacrifices his life in order to help Michael rescue a woman whom Burke called [...] "the key to everything": Sonya (Alona Tal). Michael and the team, including Fiona, begin working with Sonya to get deeper into her organization. As they do, Michael meets James (John Pyper-Ferguson), the man <b>calling</b> <b>the</b> <b>shots</b> for Sonya and Burke, and after passing some intense tests, Michael is welcomed into James's [...] "family". It doesn't take long for Michael to find out that James works for peace and justice in the world, but uses extreme methods to get what he wants. After Michael kills Sonya to protect Fiona, James sends his men to kill Maddie, Charlie, and Jesse. Maddie sacrifices herself to protect them and Michael shoots James, intent on taking him in custody. James blows up his own building, hoping to kill Michael and Fiona. They escape, but must be presumed dead to protect themselves. Strong releases Sam and Jesse, without imprisonment. [...] While the two of them contemplate continuing helping out those who need it like they had for the past seven years, Michael and Fiona have made their home in a small town in Ireland raising Charlie as their own and being the family that Fi had always dreamed of with Michael as her husband. As the show ends, Michael asks Fiona what should he tell Charlie when he is older. Fi says Michael should tell him the truth, but Michael doesn't know where to start. Fiona tells him to start from the beginning, by saying, [...] "My name is Michael Westen. I used to be a spy." ...|$|E
