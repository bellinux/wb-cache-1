30|$|On {{the basis}} of the {{research}} of Remington and Witting, Thompson et al. [47, 48, 49] conducted many studies on a track–bridge vibration model. Under that model, first, the bridge combined with the track was considered as an infinitely long Euler–Bernoulli beam with <b>continuous</b> <b>elastic</b> <b>support.</b> Then, the <b>continuous</b> <b>elastic</b> <b>support</b> was replaced by a fixed equivalent point support (i.e., two layers of <b>continuous</b> <b>elastic</b> <b>support</b> were modeled). Finally, discrete point supports were inserted between the track and the bridge to account for the random distribution of support stiffness, sleeper space, and beam mass. This model was used to study problems related to steel-bridge noise and validated SEA for calculation of low-frequency bridge-borne noise. The results showed that SEA is applicable for calculation of sound radiation above 40  Hz and that sound radiation calculation results below 40  Hz can be inaccurate.|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} this {{dissertation}} {{is concerned with the}} oval shape optimization of ax symmetric shells. An oval shape equation which is able to represent circles, an ellipse and egg shape is found successfully in this study. Coordinates of shell nodes are represented by parameters of the oval shape equation. Shell thickness at the nodes and the parameters of the oval shape equation become design variables, while a minimum shell material volume is the objective function of this shape optimization problem. Actual stresses at the shell nodes which are less or equal to allowable stress becomes inequality constraints which must be satisfied. A content in the shell which is equal to a constant become an equality constraint which must be satisfied too. A Gauss quadrature method is used to solve integration problems of the shell material volume and the content in the shell numerically. A finite element method which uses a curve element is used to calculate the actual stresses at the shell nodes. A displacement function which indirectly includes by rigid body motions is used in this study. The displacement function has two additional constants which explain a strain value decrease due to the rigid body motions, such that a condensation of element stiffness matrices and element load vectors are needed before the element stiffness matrices and the element load vectors are assembled into a structure stiffness matrix and a structure load vector respectively. Genetic algorithms are based on genetics and Darwin theory "survival of the fittest" is used to know characteristics of the problems and to solve the oval shape optimization of ax symmetric shells. In this study, continuous genetic algorithms are developed, and then the continuous genetic algorithms are combined with a flexible polyhedron method and an arranged mutation technique. The optimization methods which form the combination of some methods are called a hybrid method. A computer program is written based on the oval shape equation, the finite element formulation, the continuous genetic algorithms and the hybrid method. The computer program is used to solve the oval shape optimization of ax symmetric shells on a roll support and a <b>continuous</b> <b>elastic</b> <b>support,</b> with a uniform pressure load, a water load and a combination of the water load and a shell self weight...|$|E

Second order effects can affect the compressive stressâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 3 strain law of steel bars, influencing ductility calculations of RC structures. Moreover, literature studies show that buckling can occur over a length wider than stirrupsâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 pitch (global buckling mode), involving more stirrups and inducing large deflections in the bar. If the critical length is not carefully estimated, stirrupsâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 failure can occur, causing also the sudden loss of confining effects in concrete.

Analytical solutions for the nonlinear behaviour and for the nonlinear buckling load are obtained for shallow arches with equal or unequal <b>elastic</b> <b>supports.</b> It is found that {{the flexibility of the}} <b>elastic</b> <b>supports</b> and the shallowness of the arch play important roles in the nonlinear structural response of the arch.

40|$|Train {{circulation}} is {{a random}} dynamic phenomenon and, {{according to the}} different frequencies of the loads it imposes, there exists the corresponding response of track superstructure. Random dynamic phenomena are generally approached through the probability of occurrence (for stochastic processes see [1]). The railway track is modeled as a <b>continuous</b> beam on <b>elastic</b> <b>support.</b> At the moment when an axle of a railway vehicle passes from {{the location of a}} support point of a rail, that is a sleeper, a random dynamic load is applied on the sleeper. The theoretical approach for the estimation of the dynamic loading of a sleeper demands the analysis of the total load acting on the sleeper to individual component loads-actions, which, in general, can be divided into: the static component of the load‚ and the relevant to it reaction/action per support point of the rail (sleeper), the semi-static component of the load, and the relevant to it reaction/action per support point of the rail (sleeper) and the dynamic component of the load, and the relevant to it reaction/action per support point of the rail (sleeper). The motion of a railway vehicle on the rail running table –of the railway track– is described by formulas and it is illustrated through diagrams which have the form of a “signal”. It is a random/ stochastic dynamic phenomenon. The general equation that describes the motion is the second order differential equation (of motion). In the present paper the dynamic component of the Load and the relevant Action/ Reaction on each support point of the rail are investigated through a sensitivity analysis by variating parameters of the second order differential equation of motion of the Non Suspended Masses of the Vehicle ([2],[3]) and specifically the transient response of the reaction/ action on each support point (sleeper) of the rail. © 2014, North Atlantic University Union.

The response of the track to the aforementioned excitation results in the increase of the static loads on the superstructure. The dynamic load is primarily caused by the motion of the vehicle's Non-Suspended (unsprung) Masses, which are excited by track geometry defects, and, to a smaller degree, by the effect of the Suspended (sprung) Masses. In order to formulate the theoretical equations for the calculation of the dynamic component of the load, the statistical probability of exceeding the calculated load-in real conditions should be considered, so that the corresponding equations refer to the standard deviation (variance) of the load. In the present paper the dynamic component is investigated through the second order differential equation of motion of the Non Suspended Masses of the Vehicle and specifically the transient response of the reaction/ action on each support point (sleeper) of the rail.
