40|$|The Competition Committee debated {{retail banking}} in October 2006. Competition {{can improve the}} {{functioning}} of the retail banking sector without harming prudential regulation. The efficient functioning of the sector is important for economic performance. The sector is considered special primarily because of externalities related to potential “contagion” effects stemming from (i) the withdrawal-upondemand characteristic of some bank deposits and (ii) the role banks play in the payment system, and (iii) the fact that banks are important for the funding of consumers and SMEs. <b>Customer</b> <b>mobility</b> and choice is essential to simulate retail-banking competition. An important observation is that the degree of <b>customer</b> <b>mobility</b> is low and the longevity of customer-bank relationships is long. Financial information sharing platforms should therefore be promoted and, where limited by privacy laws, privacy laws should be modified in a way that maintains the goal of protecting privacy while also allowing consumers to receive the benefits of credit ratings. ...|$|E

30|$|Our work {{opens the}} way to several future developments. First, we need to better {{establish}} the relationship between shop size {{and the quality of}} the infrastructure surrounding the shop. Larger shops might have better parking lots, being more accessible even if farther away and so on. By controlling for these factors, we can actually evaluate the net effect of product price and sophistication on <b>customer’s</b> <b>mobility</b> decisions. Second, we can move towards the data mining community and use these features in a predictive framework that, given a customer and a product, will be able to suggest the amount of time the customer is willing to invest to obtain the product. There are a number of marketing applications that could benefit both customers and retailers. Finally, we can explore what are the privacy implications of such systems. These applications will have to ensure that the personal information of the customers is never jeopardized.|$|R

Here we improve over our previous work by using a more realistic measure of customer-shop distance, and investigating deeper implications of shop and product types on <b>customer</b> <b>mobility.</b>|$|E
40|$|Switching costs {{increase}} the rigidity of consumers demand and lessen competition between firms, effects that are particularly relevant in the mobile voice services market. This paper characterizes {{the most important}} mobility restrictive factors for consumers in this market, presenting specific examples and discussing their impact on competition. In addition, a survey was conducted to obtain data on consumption decisions by mobile voice customers in Portugal. The survey results suggest that switching costs represent more than 13 euros or 57 % of the average monthly expenditure with these services. The disclosure of a new mobile phone number {{is the most difficult}} task in the switching process. Customers also showed high concern with respect to the possibility of losing quality of service. Compatibility costs also impose high restrictions to <b>customer</b> <b>mobility.</b> Following the identification of these restrictive factors, the adoption by policy makers of remedies to address the different search and switching costs is discussed and their implementation prioritized according to mobile customers' needs.

30|$|In {{the paper}} we show {{different}} dynamics for different shop types. Larger shops (‘Iper’) have higher retention and catch rates, especially against the smallest shops (‘Gestin’). The hypothesis {{still to be}} tested is if this effect {{has anything to do}} with the shops’ intrinsic power (shops are larger, thus fulfill more needs), or if there are external explanations (larger shops have better infrastructure). We need to integrate our data sources with other information about how people access the shops: do the shops have larger parking lot? Are they better served by public transportation? Are the customers visiting them by car or by foot? These and other questions need to be answered to have a fully controlled experiment on <b>customer</b> <b>mobility.</b> Our results partially address these concerns. Given that we find strong product-dependent variables, it means that the object of the purchase is playing an effect on customer’s mobility. If infrastructure-type variables would be the only important factor, we would not see the rates we described in this paper.|$|E

In this paper, we study the privacy issues in distributed systems during the monitoring of thresholds functions, where several nodes contribute with their data to the monitoring of a specific event. We provide a privacy-preserving framework suitable to find an acceptable trade-off among privacy protection, data quality and system performance. Using real-life data from GPS devices of private cars, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in a case study consisting of the monitoring of <b>customers</b> <b>mobility</b> behaviors; in other words, we show how techniques for efficient communication can be used while preserving the individual privacy of the actors who are participating to the collective analysis...|$|R

40|$|Rural {{retailers}} in Sweden {{are currently}} in need of new strategies {{in order to meet}} the increasing competition from urban shopping centers and increased <b>customer</b> <b>mobility.</b> This study examines the how events can influence local retail survival in rural areas. In interviews, local stakeholders involved in retail, events and municipal decision-making describes how events affect the retail of a rural municipality in Sweden. A questionnaire survey among the visitors of two local events is also conducted, in order to see how consumers perceive the services in, and around the events. The result reveals that even if most retailers do not perceive an impact of the local events on their businesses, they acknowledge them as an important factor with potential of creating a competitive advantage. The main problem is the lack of communication between retailers, event managers and local governance. In order to get advantages from the events the local stakeholders need to form cooperative bodies where they can exchange information and knowledge, but also find joint business strategies. The study generates hypothesis for further research on the potentials of rural retail...|$|E

These schemes allow us to identify the feasible configurations of instantaneous up- and downlink bit-rates of users; i. e., such that {{can be obtained by}} allocating respective powers, taking into account in an exact way the interference created in the whole, multicellular network. We consider the bit-rate configurations identified by these schemes as feasible sets for some classical, maximal fair resource allocation policies, and study their performance in the long-term evolution of the system. Specifically, we assume Markovian arrivals, departures and mobility of customers, which transmit some given data-volumes, as well as some temporal channel variability (fading), and study the mean throughput i. e., the mean bit-rates that the policies offer in different parts of a given cell. Explicit formulas are obtained in the case of proportional fair policies, which may or may-not take advantage of the fading, for null or infinitely rapid <b>customer</b> <b>mobility.</b> This approach applies also to a channel shared by the elastic traffic and a strea ing, with predefined customer bit-rates,regulated by the respective admission policy...|$|E
40|$|Policymakers {{around the}} world call for more {{competition}} in the banking sector. One prerequisite to achieving this is <b>customer</b> <b>mobility.</b> Despite its policy relevance, surprisingly {{little is known about}} consumers’ bank switching behaviour. We show that the principal reasons to stay at one’s bank are a good bank-customer relationship, practical barriers, and the perception that there is not much benefit in switching. Moreover, we find that the reported propensity to switch varies across banking products. For the main current and savings accounts, this propensity is most strongly related to the bank-customer relationship, while for mortgage loans it is especially linked to switching experience. These findings have important implications for antitrust policy; they provide an argument against using a cluster-based legal standard for the analysis of competition and in favour of a disaggregated approach. Regarding the effectiveness of hypothetical policy initiatives to lower switching barriers, we find that the reported switching propensity with current accounts is higher in the case of account number portability, while more knowledge of the existing switching service has no significant effect. Lastly, scenario analysis shows that a policy of allowing new foreign banks to enter the savings market is less promising for enhancing mobility than a policy that increases the number of domestic players...|$|E

40|$|The {{premium rates}} paid for {{statutory}} health insurance in Germany {{play a key}} role in the competition among health care funds. With the most recent health care reform (GKV-Wettbewerbsst 4 rkungsgesetz GKV-WSG), a range of new products have been introduced that could erode the advantageous selling proposition of the premium rates. In addition to the pure monetary incentive to change health insurance provider, the new products include aspects that are becoming increasingly important to insured persons, such as the assessment of their own morbidity and the level and quality of health care provision. We find that current morbidity, experiences in morbidity, and expectations about morbidity will gain in importance when choosing health care provider. Using micro-data for the years 1999 to 2004 from the German Socio-Economic Panel study (SOEP), we investigate the willingness to change health provider in a multivariate setting. The SOEP data will be matched with register information about premium rates of all statutory health insurance funds in Germany. Applying a multinomial logit model, we show that there are two prototypes of insured people who change funds. The characteristics of those who changed funds can be used to evaluate the future developments in statutory health insurance in Germany, assuming that <b>customer</b> <b>mobility</b> will continue to increase...|$|E
40|$|Customer experience' is a {{term that}} covers {{a wide range of}} {{activities}} that take place between suppliers and users of products and services. LaSalle and Britton define it as 'a holistic experience which involves a person - as opposed to a customer - as a whole at different levels and in every interaction between such person and a company' (2003). This research considers a key aspect of such an holistic experience: that which is embodied in the product or service under consideration. In the context of increasing mobile technology convergence, the paper considers new approaches that focus on developing the necessary underlying enablers and common interaction flows that are required to deliver a designed experience, taking into account the increasing number of mobile operating systems and service delivery platforms. Ultimately these models move towards allowing users to 'co-create their own unique experiences' (Pralahad and Ramswamy, 2004). The convergence between IT and telecommunications domains presents a unique challenge to product and service designers. Services are increasingly accessible via multiple delivery devices and delivery networks. This trend has been seen most recently in the advent of Internet based services being delivered via mobile phones where 'mobile service delivery and technologies have become the glue between previously secluded 'telecom' and "IT' domains' (Karrberg and Liebenau, 2006). At the same time network operators are trying to tighten their relationship with their customers by offering 'sticky' services aimed at raising the barriers to <b>customer</b> <b>mobility.</b> These two trends lead to a new design challenge: how to design a recognisably consistent and compelling product customer experience that applies over all delivery services, operating systems and networks. Solutions to this problem have to date been either technology led, focussing on integrated delivery platforms, or reliant on rule-based design.

40|$|Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the Degree of Master of Business Administration at Strathmore UniversityBusinesses in the telecom industry need to build long-term relationships with customers to improve customer retention and financial benefit. The problem stated {{in this study is}} that due to intense competition, <b>customer</b> <b>mobility</b> across networks is expected with various determinants such as quality of service, price, switching costs and customer loyalty. So far, there is limited mobility according to data with the regulator- Communications Authority of Kenya, hence it is important to identify the determinants that influence switching behavior in the Kenyan market and propose a model for predicting future customer switching behavior. The target population of the study was users of mobile phones services in Kenya. The study sample comprised of 152 respondents drawn from a population of four operators, selected using purposive sampling. The study employed a cross-sectional survey design to explore what influences customer switching behavior analysis of Kenya telecom industry. The study used primary data that was collected using a semi structured questionnaire. Statistical Package for Social Sciences was used to perform the analysis as it aided in organizing and summarizing the data by the use of descriptive statistics, inferential statistics and Pearson’s correlation coefficient. The data collected was presented by use of percentages, frequency distributions, tables, and the researcher’s categorized variables. The study findings revealed that, amongst the customer determinants for switching intention, switching cost and customer loyalty recorded influential determinate with the coefficient was significant in Nairobi and Nakuru. It was also evident from the study results that all the considered determinants (predictors); customer loyalty, price, switching cost and service quality had significant effect for switching intention.

30|$|<b>Customers</b> <b>mobility</b> is {{dependent}} on the sophistication of their needs: sophisticated customers need to travel more to fulfill their needs. In this paper, we provide more detailed evidence of this phenomenon, providing an empirical validation of the Central Place Theory. For each customer, we detect what is her favorite shop, where she purchases most products. We can study the relationship between the favorite shop and the closest one, by recording the influence of the shop’s size and the customer’s sophistication in the discordance cases, i.e. the cases in which the favorite shop is not the closest one. We show that larger shops are able to retain most of their closest customers and they are able to catch large portions of customers from smaller shops around them. We connect this observation with the shop’s larger sophistication, and not with its other characteristics, as the phenomenon is especially noticeable when customers want to satisfy their sophisticated needs. This is a confirmation of the recent extensions of the Central Place Theory, where the original assumptions of homogeneity in customer purchase power and needs are challenged. Different types of shops have also different survival logics. The largest shops get closed if they are unable to catch customers from the smaller shops, while medium size shops get closed if they cannot retain their closest customers. All analysis are performed on a large real-world dataset recording all purchases from millions of customers across the west coast of Italy.|$|R

40|$|Infrastructure in {{the form}} of payment systems is a {{necessity}} to allow for payments to reach from payer to payee, but it is also subject to product differentiation between banks. In the euro countries, a domestic-integration zone termed SEPA that consolidates payment systems into a singular system has been regulated, providing market efficiencies for customers and companies. However, in Sweden, banks use unstandardized file communication that is costly for stakeholders to interface against, and is becoming increasingly difficult to oversee. With the introduction of novel payment solutions (e. g. mobile payments), there is also an increase in competitors that access the infrastructure. A rising customer demand for faster, global and integrated payments has been identified. This increased fragmentation of the market requires large investments for banks and reduces <b>customer</b> <b>mobility,</b> which motivates the need for consolidation of payment flows. The purpose of this thesis is to identify the roles of stakeholders in the clearing and settlement mechanism, and to identify the drivers and inhibitors that affect business decisions to change the systems in place. These results are categorized according to co-opetition theory. Furthermore, the thesis brings forward the global industry standard for financial messaging ISO 20022 to the business context, and discusses its implications in the Swedish market from an interoperability point of view. The study has been conducted using mixed methods with a qualitative approach. It includes: Analysis of documents and materials, non-participative observation, interviews with 9 industry experts and an in-depth case study of real-time payments in Sweden (Betalningar i Realtid). Results show that actors’ perceptions of one another are ambiguous, but cooperation is well-established and reaps many positive effects for firms. Co-opetition activities in banks are inclined to drive change, while competitive moves are likely to leave the system unchanged. Co-opetition is only possible under certain pre-agreed rules such as differentiation by implementing flexible payment solutions. The main implication for migration to an improved, standardized payment flow is connected to the governance of infrastructure. It is suggested that if agreements between stakeholders are not reached in due time then SEPA-like regulation put forward by higher instances is a likely outcome...|$|E

Additionally, management doc-uments were analyzed to examine the degree to which gender is considered. Results show that women traders had less access to social and economic resources, profitable markets, and high-value fish, which resulted in lower income. These gender inequalities are linked, among oth-ers, to women’s reproductive roles such as childcare and household responsibilities. Formal fisheries management was found to be gender insensitive, showing how a crucial feedback element of adaptive management is missing in Zanzibar’s management system, i. e., knowledge about key actors, their needs and challenges...|$|R
