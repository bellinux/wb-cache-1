The concentration of solutes affects many colligative properties, including increasing the osmotic pressure, and causing freezing-point depression and boiling-point elevation. Because the solutes are charged ions they also increase the electrical conductivity of the solution. The increased ionic strength reduces the thickness of the electrical double layer around <b>colloidal</b> <b>particles,</b> and therefore the stability of emulsions and suspensions.|$|E

25|$|Because {{the size}} of the {{dispersed}} phase may be difficult to measure, and because colloids have the appearance of solutions, colloids are sometimes identified and characterized by their physico-chemical and transport properties. For example, if a colloid consists of a solid phase dispersed in a liquid, the solid particles will not diffuse through a membrane, whereas with a true solution the dissolved ions or molecules will diffuse through a membrane. Because of the size exclusion, the <b>colloidal</b> <b>particles</b> are unable to pass through the pores of an ultrafiltration membrane with a size smaller than their own dimension. The smaller {{the size of}} the pore of the ultrafiltration membrane, the lower the concentration of the dispersed <b>colloidal</b> <b>particles</b> remaining in the ultrafiltered liquid. The measured value of the concentration of a truly dissolved species will thus depend on the experimental conditions applied to separate it from the <b>colloidal</b> <b>particles</b> also dispersed in the liquid. This is particularly important for solubility studies of readily hydrolyzed species such as Al, Eu, Am, Cm, or organic matter complexing these species.|$|E

25|$|Constructed {{wetlands}} {{are designed}} to remove stormwater pollutants associated with fine to <b>colloidal</b> <b>particles</b> and dissolved contaminants. These shallow, extensively vegetated water bodies use enhanced sedimentation, fine filtration and biological uptake to remove these pollutants. They usually comprise three zones: an inlet zone (sedimentation basin) to remove coarse sediments; a macrophyte zone, a heavily vegetated area to remove fine particulates and uptake of soluble pollutants; and a high flow bypass channel to protect the macrophyte zone. The macrophyte zone generally includes a marsh zone {{as well as an}} open water zone and has an extended depth of 0.25 to 0.5m with specialist plant species and a retention time of 48 to 72 hours. Constructed Wetlands can also provide a flow control function by rising during rainfall and then slowly releasing the stored flows. Constructed wetlands will improve the runoff water quality depending on the wetland processes. The key treatment mechanism of wetlands are physical (trapping suspended solids and adsorbed pollutants), biological and chemical uptake (trapping dissolved pollutants, chemical adsorption of pollutants), and pollutant transformation (more stable sediment fixation, microbial processes, UV disinfection).|$|E
