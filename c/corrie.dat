5|$|On {{his first}} start after the Derby, St. Gatien was sent to Royal Ascot for the Gold Vase, in which he faced the top class older horses <b>Corrie</b> Roy (who started favourite) and Tristan at {{weight-for-age}} over two miles. <b>Corrie</b> Roy made the running until the straight, when Wood moved St. Gatien up to challenge. The Derby winner quickly {{took control of the}} race and pulled away to win easily by four lengths from <b>Corrie</b> Roy, with Tristan a remote third. Later at the same meeting <b>Corrie</b> Roy won the Alexandra Plate, while Tristan beat Harvester in the Hardwicke Stakes.|$|E
5|$|Two {{days after}} her defeat in the Derby, La Fleche ran against fillies in the Oaks. Although some {{regarded}} her as a certainty, her odds drifted from 2/5 to 8/11 before the start. In the race she tracked the leader Broad <b>Corrie</b> before taking {{the lead in the}} straight apparently poised for an easy victory. In the final furlong however, she was closely pressed by The Smew, a filly she had dealt with easily in the 1000 Guineas, and Barrett had to ride a vigorous finish to win the race by a short head. On 29 July at Goodwood, La Fleche won the Nassau Stakes in which, despite looking less than fully fit, she quickened impressively to bear Broad <b>Corrie</b> by a length and a half.|$|E
5|$|The Christians {{were granted}} a {{parliamentary}} annuity of £6000 a year, which the Queen requested in person. In addition, a dower of £30,000 was settled upon, and the Queen gave the couple £100,000, which yielded {{an income of}} about £4000 a year. As {{well as that of}} Ranger of Windsor Park, Christian was given the honorary position of High Steward of Windsor, and was made a Royal Commissioner for the Great Exhibition of 1851. However, he was often an absentee figurehead at the meetings, instead passing his time playing with his dog <b>Corrie,</b> feeding his numerous pigeons, and embarking on hunting excursions.|$|E

5|$|On 12 October he contested the Champion Stakes {{over ten}} furlongs at Newmarket. He ran {{a dead heat}} with the filly Thebais, winner of the 1881 1000 Guineas and Oaks, with the St Leger winner Dutch Oven in third. Later in the meeting he {{finished}} second to the two-year-old Energy in the Great Challenge Stakes. At the end of October, Tristan ran twice at the Newmarket Houghton meeting without reproducing his best form. In the Cambridgeshire Handicap he carried top weight of 130 pounds and finished seventh of the thirty-one runners behind Hackness. On his final {{start of the year}} he ran in the Jockey Club Stakes over two and a quarter miles. In a closely contested four way finish he dead-heated for second place with City Arab, a short head behind Chippendale and a neck in front of the mare <b>Corrie</b> Roy.|$|E
5|$|On 27 August 1997, a {{delegation}} of Noongars consisting of Ken Colbung, Robert Bropho, Richard Wilkes and Mingli Wanjurri-Nungala arrived in the UK to collect Yagan's head. The delegation {{was to have been}} larger, but Commonwealth funding was withdrawn at the last minute. The handover of Yagan's skull was further delayed, however, when a Noongar named <b>Corrie</b> Bodney applied to the Supreme Court of Western Australia for an injunction against the handover. Claiming that his family group has sole responsibility for Yagan's remains, Bodney declared the exhumation illegal and denied the existence of any tradition or belief necessitating the head's exhumation and removal to Australia. On 29 August, Justice Henry Wallwork rejected the injunction application, on the grounds that Bodney had previously agreed to the current arrangements, and on the evidence of another Noongar elder (Albert Corunna, who claimed to be a closer relation of Yagan) and anthropologist Pat Baines, both of whom refuted Bodney's claim to sole responsibility.|$|E
5|$|On the east, {{the first}} {{impression}} is all of rock. The long strath of Grisedale runs north-eastward to Ullswater, cutting off a series of hanging valleys which fall from the Helvellyn range. To the south east of Nethermost Pike, below the summit of High Crag, is Ruthwaite Cove. Surrounded by crag on three sides, this <b>corrie</b> contains Hard Tarn, a small pool on a rock shelf. This {{is one of the}} most difficult mountain tarns to locate, and its black algal bed and clear water combine to give the false impression of great depth. Ruthwaite Cove is now the site of Ruthwaite Lodge, a climbing hut. It was formerly the setting for more industrial activity, with the remains of several underground mines and some shallow open workings visible near the Lodge.|$|E

5|$|On 15 June 1824 Heber {{set out on}} a tour of {{northern}} India, accompanied by his personal chaplain, Martin Stowe, and Daniel <b>Corrie,</b> the Archdeacon of Calcutta. Amelia remained in Calcutta; earlier in the year she had given birth to her third daughter, Harriet. The general plan was to travel by boat to the upper waters of the River Ganges, then overland into the foothills of the Himalayas before turning south and west, crossing Rajputana to reach Bombay. The journey was almost aborted near to its beginning when Stowe fell ill in Dacca and died there; after some hesitation, Heber decided that the tour should continue. Early in August the party reached Benares (now Varanasi), the largest of the cities in the Ganges plain, where Heber spent several weeks. It was a wholly Indian city without a European population, sacred to Hindus, Sikhs and Buddhists but with a well-established CMS school and a substantial Christian minority. Heber consecrated a new church, and when he conducted a Holy Communion service in both English and Hindustani, a large congregation of Christians and Hindus thronged the church.|$|E

The case was dismissed by a Federal judge in November 2005 for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, citing, among other things, the political question doctrine.
