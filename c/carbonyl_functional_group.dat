5000|$|The word {{polyurea}} {{is derived}} from the Greek words πολυ- - poly- meaning [...] "many"; and ουρίας - oûron meaning [...] "to urinate". The latter term refers to the substance urea, found in urine, rather than urine itself. Urea or carbamide is an organic compound with the chemical formula (NH2)2CO. The molecule has two amine groups (-NH2) joined by a <b>carbonyl</b> <b>functional</b> <b>group</b> (C=O). In a polyurea, alternating monomer units of isocyanates and amines react with each other to form urea linkages. Ureas can also be formed from the reaction of isocyanates and water which forms a carbamic acid intermediate. This acid quickly decomposes by splitting off carbon dioxide and leaving behind an amine. This amine then reacts with another isocyanate group to form the polyurea linkage. This two step reaction is used in what is commonly but improperly called polyurethane foams. The carbon dioxide that is liberated in this reaction is the primary blowing (foaming) agent especially in many polyurethane foams which more precisely should be called polyurethane/urea foams.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the functional form of the potentials, force fields define a set of parameters for different types of atoms, chemical bonds, dihedral angles and so on. The parameter sets are usually empirical. A force field would include distinct parameters for an oxygen atom in a <b>carbonyl</b> <b>functional</b> <b>group</b> and in a hydroxyl group. The typical parameter set includes values for atomic mass, van der Waals radius, and partial charge for individual atoms, and equilibrium values of bond lengths, bond angles, and dihedral angles for pairs, triplets, and quadruplets of bonded atoms, and values corresponding to the effective spring constant for each potential. Most current force fields parameters use a fixed-charge model by which each atom is assigned one value for the atomic charge that is not affected by the local electrostatic environment; proposed developments in next-generation force fields incorporate models for polarizability, in which a particle's charge is influenced by electrostatic interactions with its neighbors. For example, polarizability can be approximated {{by the introduction of}} induced dipoles; it can also be represented by Drude particles, massless, charge-carrying virtual sites attached by a springlike harmonic oscillator potential to each polarizable atom. The introduction of polarizability into force fields in common use has been inhibited by the high computational expense associated with calculating the local electrostatic field.|$|E

50|$|Fatty acid {{synthesis}} in most prokaryotes occurs by a type II synthase made of many enzymes {{located in}} the cytoplasm that can be separated. However, some bacteria such as Mycobacterium smegmatis as well as mammals and yeast use a type I synthase which is a large multifunctional protein similar to the synthase used for polyketide synthesis. This Type I synthase includes discrete domains on which individual reactions are catalyzed. In both fatty acid synthesis and polyketide synthesis, the intermediates are covalently bound to ACP, or Acyl Carrier Protein. However, in fatty acid synthesis the original molecules are Acyl-CoA or Malonyl-CoA but poyketide synthases can use multiple primers including Acetyl-CoA, Propionyl-CoA, Isobutyrl-CoA, Cyclohexanoyl-CoA, 3-amino-5-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA, or Cinnamyl-CoA. In both fatty acid synthesis and polyketide synthesis these CoA carriers will be exchanged for ACP before they are incorporated into the growing molecule. During the elongation steps of fatty acid synthesis, ketosynthase, ketoreductase, dehydratase, and enoylreductase are all used in sequence to create a saturated fatty acid then postsynthetic modification {{can be done to}} create an unsaturated or cyclo fatty acid. However in polyketide synthesis these enzymes can be used in different combinations to create segments of polyketide that are saturated, unsaturated, or have a hydroxyl or <b>carbonyl</b> <b>functional</b> <b>group.</b> There are also enzymes used in both fatty acid synthesis and polyketide synthesis that can make modifications to the molecule after it has been synthesized. As far as regulating the length of the molecule being synthesized, the specific mechanism by which fatty acid chain length remains unknown but it is expected that ACP-bound fatty acid chains of the correct length act as allosteric inhibitors of the fatty acid synthesis enzymes. In polyketide synthesis, the synthases are composed of modules in which the order of enzymatic reactions is defined by the structure of the protein complex. This means that once the molecule reaches the last reaction of the last module, the polyketide is released from the complex by a thioesterase enzyme. Therefore, regulation of fatty acid chain length is most likely due to allosteric regulation, and regulation of polyketide length is due to a specific enzyme within the polyketide synthase.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the surface {{heterogeneity}} {{and the surface}} mediation on the intermolecular potential energy for nitrogen adsorption on graphitized thermal carbon black (GTCB). The surface heterogeneity is modeled as the random distribution of effective <b>carbonyl</b> <b>functional</b> <b>groups</b> on the graphite surface. The molecular parameters and the discrete charges of this carbonyl group are taken from Jorgensen, et al. (J. Am. Chem. Soc., (1984) 106, 6638) while those for nitrogen (dispersive parameters and discrete charges) are taken from Murthy et al. (Mol. Phys., (1983) 50, 531) in our Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulation. The solid surface mediation in the reduction of intermolecular potential energy between two fluid molecules was taken from a recent work by Do et al. (Langmuir, (2004) 20, 7623). Our simulation results accounting for the surface heterogeneity and surface mediation on intermolecular potential energy were compared with the experimental data of nitrogen at 77 and 90 K. The solid-fluid dispersive parameters are determined from the Lorentz-Berthelot (LB) rule. The fraction of the graphite surface covered with <b>carbonyl</b> <b>functional</b> <b>groups</b> was then derived from the consideration of the Henry constant, and for the data of Kruk et al. (Langmuir, (1999) 15, 1435) {{we have found that}} 1 % of their GTCB surface is covered with effective <b>carbonyl</b> <b>functional</b> <b>groups.</b> The damping constant, due to surface mediation, was determined from the consideration of the portion of the adsorption isotherm where the first layer is being completed, and it was found to take a value of 0. 0075. With these parameters, we have found that the GCMC simulation results describe the data over the complete range of pressure substantially better than any other MC models in the literature. The implication of this work is demonstrated with local adsorption isotherms of 10 and 20 A slit pores. One was obtained without allowance for surface mediation, while the other correctly accounts for these factors. The two local isotherms differ substantially, and the implication is that if we used incorrect local isotherms (i. e. without the surface mediation) the pore size distribution would be incorrectly derived...|$|R

40|$|Presented {{here are}} {{computed}} {{rates for the}} thermal unimolecular decomposition {{of a variety of}} alkoxy radicals with four- and five-carbon length backbones. Three classes of molecules are examined: alkoxy radicals with saturated hydrocarbon backbones, those with alcohol <b>functional</b> <b>groups,</b> and those with <b>carbonyl</b> <b>functional</b> <b>groups.</b> The chosen species represent many of those found during the combustion of fossil fuels as well as bio-derived alternatives. Density functional theory calculations were benchmarked against higher level coupled cluster calculations and used to explore the potential energy surfaces of these systems. Transition state theory was used to calculate high-pressure limit rate coefficients of all radical intermediates in the regimes relevant to atmospheric chemistry and combustion. We show that the assumption that alkoxy radicals quickly decompose via β-scission to aldehydes and other radicals is not valid for some of the alkoxy radicals investigated in this work. We further illustrate how intra-H migrations in larger alkoxy radicals with <b>carbonyl</b> and alcohol <b>functional</b> <b>groups</b> can dominate unimolecular decomposition under combustion and atmospheric relevant conditions.
