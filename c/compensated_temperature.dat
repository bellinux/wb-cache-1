40|$|Before {{starting}} the operational processing {{of all the}} acquired X-SAR interferometric SAR data from the SRTM mission, the calibration of deterministic phase errors {{as far as possible}} is necessary. Besides the phase errors caused by the shuttle and mast dynamic variations and the position and attitude inaccuracy, there are phase errors originating from the radar instrument itself that may be <b>compensated.</b> <b>Temperature</b> variations and radar parameter changes like gain settings are the major contributors to these phase errors. During the mission we monitored and recorded telemetry data indicating periodic temperature variation along with the orbit, during a data-take and from mission day one to the end. Temperature variations in microwave devices and cables cause a phase variation, which contributes to the overall phase error and degrades the accuracy of the interferometric height measurement. The phase errors have been measured directly, like for the long mast cables, or derived from the calibration tone phase analysis or simply by correcting the known phase to temperature characterization values of the microwave parts with the measured mission temperature data. The lessons learned from that mission and the results of the analysis and the improvement of the height accuracy is presented in this paper...|$|E

40|$|Subducted {{temperature}} anomalies {{have been}} invoked {{as a possible}} way for mid-latitudes to alter the climate variability of equatorial regions through the so-called `thermocline bridge', both in the Pacic and Atlantic oceans. To have a signicant impact on the equatorial heat balance, however, temperature anomalies must reach the equatorial regions sufciently undamped. In the oceans, the amplitude of propagating temperature (and salinity) anomalies can be altered both by diabatic (nonconservative) and adiabatic (conservative) effects. The importance of adiabatic alter-ations depends on whether the anomalies are controlled by wave dynamics or by passive advection associated with density compensation. Waves being relatively well understood, this paper seeks to understand the amplitude variations of density <b>compensated</b> <b>temperature</b> and salinity anomalies caused by adiabatic effects, for which no general methodology is available, assuming that these can be computed independently of amplitude variations caused by diabatic effects. The rst main result {{is to show that}} the ratio T 0 =S 0 of density compensated T and S anomalies may potentially undergo large amplitude variations at the gyre scale, because density compensation requires the equality T 0 =S 0 = S= to hold along the mean trajectories, and because in the actual oceans th...|$|E
40|$|Physiological {{response}} to environmental change is examined in {{species of the}} intertidal limpets, Patella (Prosobranchia) and Siphonaria (Pulmonata). Characteristics of heart beat were determined using impedance pneumography and these are described. Heart rate of P. granularis is related to temperature and body size, and cardiac arrest in this limpet is apparently stress- related. Siphonaria oculus may exhibit a temperature-independent, extreme, and often prolonged bradycardia (< 10 beats/min). When measured shortly after aerial exposure, heart rate and oxygen consumption of the above limpet species are closely correlated. The relationships of aerial oxygen consumption with body weight and ambient temperature were determined for the above high shore species of limpet. Both have low aerial rates of oxygen consumption relative to low shore limpet species, and their QlO values decrease with increasing temperature. Diel field recordings of heart rate of S. oculus, taken during summer and winter, suggest absence of temperature acclimation, and this was also shown for oxygen consumption at high aerial temperatures (30 °C) in laboratory experiments. Oxygen consumption of P. granularis is partially temperature <b>compensated</b> <b>temperature</b> acclimation). In air, even though S. oculus loses water faster, it shows greater tolerance of water loss and survives longer than P. granularis. Prolonged aerial exposure of S. oculus leads to depression of heart rate and of V 02 (down to 18 % of the pre- exposure rate), responses interpreted as representing adaptive metabolic rate depression. In P. granularis aerial heart rate remains constant and V 02 never falls below IX 38 % of pre-exposure rate. This reduction in V 02 in air is considered as being stress-related, resulting from impairment of oxygen uptake. In declining oxygen tension S. capensis shows a better capacity for oxyregulation than P. granularis. On exposure to hypoxia, sand-inundation and hyposalinity, S. capensis may show typical bradycardia (< 10 beats/min), suggesting depression of aerobic metabolism, and on return to pre-exposure conditions there is no overshoot of heart rate, suggesting absence of oxygen debt. The effect of hypoxia, sand-inundation and hyposalinity on heart rate of P. granularis is variable; this becomes depressed and is often interspersed with extended cardiac arrest. When conditions are normalized, this species exhibits a clear overshoot of heart rate. The significance of differences in physiological response between patellid and siphonariid limpets is discussed {{with regard to their}} habitat segregation, particularly in the upper-shore zone (open rock and tidal pools) and sand-inundated rock substrata, where only siphonariid limpets may be found. While not previously characterized in marine gastropods, metabolic rate depression by Siphonaria, through facilitating isolation and conserving food reserves, is suggested as a key factor determining their distribution in physico-chemically more extreme and variable intertidal habitats. ...|$|E
40|$|In this program, a {{database}} of dynamic temperature and dynamic pressure measurements were acquired inside {{the core of a}} TECH 977 turbofan engine to support investigations of indirect combustion noise. Dynamic temperature and pressure measurements were recorded for engine gas dynamics up to temperatures of 3100 degrees Fahrenheit and transient responses as high as 1000 hertz. These measurements were made at the entrance of the high pressure turbine (HPT) and at the entrance and exit of the low pressure turbine (LPT). Measurements were made at two circumferential clocking positions. In the combustor and inter-turbine duct (ITD), measurements were made at two axial locations to enable the exploration of time delays. The dynamic temperature measurements were made using dual thin-wire thermocouple probes. The dynamic pressure measurements were made using semi-infinite probes. Prior to the engine test, a series of bench, oven, and combustor rig tests were conducted to characterize the performance of the dual wire temperature probes and to define and characterize the data acquisition systems. A measurement solution for acquiring dynamic temperature and pressure data on the engine was defined. A suite of hardware modifications were designed to incorporate the dynamic temperature and pressure instrumentation into the TECH 977 engine. In particular, a probe actuation system was developed to protect the delicate temperature probes during engine startup and transients in order to maximize sensor life. A set of temperature probes was procured and the TECH 977 engine was assembled with the suite of new and modified hardware. The engine was tested at four steady state operating speeds, with repeats. Dynamic pressure and temperature data were acquired at each condition for at least one minute. At the two highest power settings, temperature data could not be obtained at the forward probe locations since the mean temperatures exceeded the capability of the probes. The temperature data were processed using software that accounts for the effects of convective and conductive heat transfer. The software was developed under previous NASA sponsored programs. <b>Compensated</b> <b>temperature</b> spectra and compensated time histories corresponding to the dynamic temperature of the gas stream were generated. Auto-spectral and cross-spectral analyses of the data were performed to investigate spectral features, acoustic circumferential mode content, signal coherence, and time delays. The dynamic temperature data exhibit a wideband and fairly flat spectral content. The temperature spectra do not change substantially with operating speed. The pressure spectra in the combustor and ITD exhibit generally similar shapes and amplitudes, making it difficult to identify any features that suggest the presence of indirect combustion noise. Cross-spectral analysis reveal a strong correlation between pressure and temperature fluctuations in the ITD, but little correlation between temperature fluctuations at the entrance of the HPT and pressure fluctuations downstream of it. Temperature fluctuations at the entrance of the low pressure turbine were an order of magnitude smaller than those {{at the entrance to the}} high pressure turbine. Time delay analysis of the temperature fluctuations in the combustor was inconclusive, perhaps due to the substantial mixing that occurs between the upstream and downstream locations. Time delay analysis of the temperature fluctuations in the ITD indicate that they convect at the mean flow speed. Analysis of the data did not reveal any convincing indications of the presence of indirect combustion noise. However, this analysis has been preliminary and additional exploration of the data is recommended including the use of more sophisticated signal processing to explore subtle issues that have been revealed but which are not yet fully understood or explained...|$|E
