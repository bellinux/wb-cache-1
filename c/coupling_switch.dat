40|$|In this study, {{we propose}} two chaotic {{oscillators}} coupled via switch. The chaotic oscillators are auto gain controlled os-cillators containing time delay. The oscillators have feed-back systems which control the gain. The <b>coupling</b> <b>switch</b> is placed between the feedback systems which control {{both of the}} oscillators. The <b>coupling</b> <b>switch</b> connects alternately with one subcircuit {{and the other with}} a fixed time interval. We carry out computer calculations and circuit experiments for two coupled auto gain controlled oscillators containing time delay and investigate synchronization phenomena. In the computer calculations, we observe coexistence phenom-ena of in-phase synchronization and opposite-phase synchro-nization. In the circuit experiments, we observe coexistence phenomena of in-phase quasi-synchronization and opposite-phase quasi-synchronization.

40|$|Automatic {{test pattern}} {{generation}} yielding high fault coverage also for non-trivial faults in CMOS circuits has found a wide attention in industry and research for a long time. Test generation from gate level netlists is quite efficient, but has shortcomings with respect to fault coverage in complex CMOS gates, while an approach reyling on the transistor structure only is inefficient and virtually impossible for larger circuits. This paper describes mechanisms for <b>coupling</b> <b>switch</b> level and gate elvel test generation towards an efficient mixed level test generator that combines acceptable performance for large networks and high fault coverage also for non-trivial transistor networks.

The control scheme is mainly based on the droop method for active and reactive power sharing by means of voltage and frequency regulation. In addition, to get a smooth transfer between islanded and grid-connected modes, a phase-locked loop is also used in the control system. This loop is only activated during islanded mode to eliminate the phase deviation between the voltages in {{both sides of the}} point of common <b>coupling</b> <b>switch.</b> The output of this loop is send to all power units following a one-to-all communication scheme with low bandwidth.

40|$|Ultra-low-dose opioid antagonists enhance opioid {{analgesia}} {{and reduce}} analgesic tolerance and dependence by preventing a G protein <b>coupling</b> <b>switch</b> (Gi/o to Gs) by the mu opioid receptor (MOR), although the binding site of such ultra-low-dose opioid antagonists was previously unknown. Here {{we show that}} with approximately 200 -fold higher affinity than for the mu opioid receptor, naloxone binds a pentapeptide segment of the scaffolding protein filamin A, known {{to interact with the}} mu opioid receptor, to disrupt its chronic opioid-induced Gs coupling. Naloxone binding to filamin A is demonstrated by the absence of [(3) H]-and FITC-naloxone binding in the melanoma M 2 cell line that does not contain filamin or MOR, contrasting with strong [(3) H]naloxone binding to its filamin A-transfected subclone A 7 or to immunopurified filamin A. Naloxone binding to A 7 cells was displaced by naltrexone but not by morphine, indicating a target distinct from opioid receptors and perhaps unique to naloxone and its analogs. The intracellular location of this binding site was confirmed by FITC-NLX binding in intact A 7 cells. Overlapping peptide fragments from c-terminal filamin A revealed filamin A(2561 - 2565) as the binding site, and an alanine scan of this pentapeptide revealed an essential mid-point lysine. Finally, in organotypic striatal slice cultures, peptide fragments containing filamin A(2561 - 2565) abolished the prevention by 10 pM naloxone of both the chronic morphine-induced mu opioid receptor-Gs coupling and the downstream cAMP excitatory signal. These results establish filamin A as the target for ultra-low-dose opioid antagonists previously shown to enhance opioid analgesia and to prevent opioid tolerance and dependence...|$|E
40|$|Transient kinetic {{measurements}} of the actomyosin ATPase provided {{the basis of the}} Lymn–Taylor model for the cross-bridge cycle, which underpins current models of contraction. Following the determination {{of the structure of the}} myosin motor domain, it has been possible to introduce probes at defined sites and resolve the steps in more detail. Probes have been introduced in the Dictyostelium myosin II motor domain via three routes: (i) single tryptophan residues at strategic locations throughout the motor domain; (ii) green fluorescent protein fusions at the N and C termini; and (iii) labelled cysteine residues engineered across the actin-binding cleft. These studies are interpreted with reference to motor domain crystal structures and suggest that the tryptophan (W 501) in the relay loop senses the lever arm position, which is controlled by the switch 2 open-to-closed transition at the active site. Actin has little effect on this process per se. A mechanism of product release is proposed in which actin has an indirect effect on the switch 2 and lever arm position to achieve mechanochemical <b>coupling.</b> <b>Switch</b> 1 closing appears to be a key step in the nucleotide-induced actin dissociation, while its opening is required for the subsequent activation of product release. This process has been probed with F 239 W and F 242 W substitutions in the switch 1 loop. The E 706 K mutation in skeletal myosin IIa is associated with a human myopathy.

40|$|Chronic {{morphine}} {{causes the}} mu opioid receptor (MOR) to switch its coupling from Gi/o to Gs, resulting in excitatory signaling via both Galphas and its Gbetagamma dimer. Ultra-low-dose naloxone (NLX) prevents this switch and attenuates opioid tolerance and dependence. This protective effect is mediated via a high-affinity interaction of NLX to a pentapeptide region in c-terminal filamin A (FLNA), a scaffolding protein interacting with MOR. In organotypic striatal slice cultures, we now show that acute morphine induces a dose-dependent Go-to-Gs <b>coupling</b> <b>switch</b> at 5 and 15 min that resolves by 1 hr. The acute Gs coupling induced by 100 microM morphine was completely prevented by co-treatment with 100 pM NLX, (+) NLX, or naltrexone (NTX), or their pentapeptide binding site (FLNA(2561 - 2565)), which we show {{can act as}} a decoy for MOR or bind to FLNA itself. All of these co-treatments presumably prevent the MOR-FLNA interaction. Since ultra-low-dose NTX also attenuates the addictive properties of opioids, we assessed striatal cAMP production and CREB phosphorylation at S(133). Correlating with the Gs coupling, acute morphine induced elevated cAMP levels and a several-fold increase in pS(133) CREB that were also completely blocked by NLX, NTX or the FLNA pentapeptide. We propose that acute, robust stimulation of MOR causes an interaction with FLNA that allows an initially transient MOR-Gs coupling, which recovers with receptor recycling but persists when MOR stimulation is repeated or prolonged. The complete prevention of this acute, morphine-induced MOR-Gs coupling by 100 pM NLX/NTX or 10 microM pentapeptide segment of FLNA further elucidates both MOR signaling and the mechanism of action of ultra-low-dose NLX or NTX in attenuating opioid tolerance, dependence and addictive potential...|$|E

40|$|Stress (Takotsubo) {{cardiomyopathy}} is {{a severe}} form of acute heart failure (HF) with rapid onset, characterized by hypocontraction {{of the heart}} from the mid-left ventricle to apex. It is precipitated by extreme stress and plasma levels of the catecholamines adrenaline and noradrenaline are significantly elevated. This thesis describes {{the development of a}} new model of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy through rapid intravenous injection of a supraphysiological dose of adrenaline into anaesthetised male Sprague- Dawley (SD) rats and real-time imaging of the heart using either 2 D-echocardiography or cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR). This in vivo rat model was used, in conjunction with in vitro IonOptix video-edge detection of cardiomyocyte contractility, to firstly demonstrate that this syndrome results from an adrenaline-induced trafficking-switch of the coupling of the pleiotropic β 2 -adrenceptor (AR) from Gs-adenylyl cyclase (AC) -cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) cardiostimulant to Gi-activated cardiodepressant pathways. Cardiomyocyte β 2 AR:β 1 AR population ratios, determined by radioligand binding, suggested that an apical-basal gradient in β 2 AR expression accounted for the in vivo apical hypokinesis. Certain β-blockers can act as biased agonists of a Gi-coupled isoform of the β 2 AR in animal and human cardiomyocytes via a pathway that involves p 38 MAPK. Administration of the clinical β-blockers propranolol and carvedilol 15 minutes after adrenaline either enhanced or failed to reverse apical hypocontractility. In vitro analysis demonstrated that β 2 AR-Gi signalling involves p 38 MAPK activation. However, pre-treatment with either the p 38 MAPK inhibitor SB 203580 or the β 2 AR blocker ICI- 118, 551 prior to adrenaline resulted in significant mortality, which suggested that the β 2 AR-Gs/Gi <b>coupling</b> <b>switch</b> is a cardioprotective strategy. Gi-protein is upregulated in chronic HF, while β 1 ARs are down-regulated. In contractility studies of chronically failing human/rat cardiomyocytes, β 2 AR-Gs responses were present with minimal active Gi-protein component. This suggested that while in acute HF β 2 AR-Gs positively inotropic responses are impaired and β 1 ARs are preserved, the opposite may be true in chronic HF.

40|$|The {{objective}} of a multi-variable control involves maintaining various control variables at independent set points. The interactions {{present in the}} system affects more than one controlled variables because of the manipulated variable. Decouplers are designed to reduce the interactions in between the loops in to achieve a satisfactory responses when there is presence of non-minimum phase zeros,multiple time delays and large uncertainty. The dynamic and static decoupling are {{the two types of}} decoupling strategies. In this thesis, these control strategies are discussed. In practice, there exists certain process unmodelled dynamics. Hence, there is a necessity to examine the robust stability of a system to check whether the control system stability is ascertained in presence of these unmodelled dynamics. This thesis deals with designing a controller along with decoupler to achieve the desired performance of a TITO system. At first, a decoupler is being designed from the plant matrix. Then, a first order plus dead time model is obtained for each of the decoupled process {{on the basis of the}} frequency response fitting. After getting the FOPDT model a decentralized PI/PID controller for each reduced order decoupled model is designed to obtain desired gain and phase margins. The present technique is applied to a coupled tank system. The characteristics like non-minimum phase and non-linear characteristics make the control of coupled tank liquid level system, a standout amongst the most difficult benchmark control problems. The main {{objective of}} the coupled tank system is to maintain a desired level of liquid in the two tanks independent of each other when the water enters the tank and when the water flows out. The coupling impact here in this framework is a <b>coupling</b> <b>switch</b> that permits stream of water in the tank at higher level to a tank at lower level. Lastly, robust stability of the control system is analyzed in the presence of various process uncertainties like additive uncertainty and multiplicative uncertainties. The stability analysis is examined using the small gain theorem or the spectral radius criterion. The robust stability of the coupled tank system is also determined...|$|E
40|$|Dopamine receptors mediate various {{important}} neurophysiological functions. At {{a molecular}} level, G protein coupling {{is considered the}} main activation mechanism {{for most of the}} receptor-mediated cellular processes. A number of studies using native tissue have supported the idea that receptors can interact to form dimers or higher order oligomers. Particularly in medium spiny neurons of the striatum, dopamine receptor subtypes are reported to form dimers with themselves or other receptors (e. g. adenosine receptor A 2 A). Although a functional relevance for these dimers has been proposed, current assay systems are not capable of teasing out dimer-specific signaling events from those from other receptor populations. We have developed an assay that allows investigation of receptor-effector coupling specifically with defined dimer pairs. Using this assay, we investigated putative dopamine D 1 -D 2 and A 2 A-D 2 receptor dimer functions and studied the issue of a purported G protein <b>coupling</b> <b>switch</b> in the D 1 -D 2 receptor dimer in which the heteromer was proposed to activate Gq, unlike D 1 or D 2 receptor when expressed alone. We were unable, however, to find evidence for Gq activation by the D 1 -D 2 heteromer, as the protomers in the heteromer maintained fidelity of signaling to their cognate G proteins. We also developed and optimized a series of novel Gs biosensors to elucidate differences in heterotrimeric G protein conformational changes triggered by dopamine D 1 and A 2 A receptors, two of the prominent pharmacological targets in the striatum. In addition to G protein signaling, intracellular calcium is also involved in many important cellular functions in all cell types. In neurons, intracellular calcium is implicated in learning and memory (synaptic plasticity) as well as neurodegeneration (apoptosis). In medium spiny neurons, dopamine-mediated calcium release from internal stores has been reported to result from activation of phospholipase C (PLC). However, different subtypes of dopamine receptors and intermediary proteins have been proposed {{to play a role in}} this dopamine-mediated PLC activation, and the underlying mechanisms are unclear. We found that activation of D 1 and D 2 receptors expressed individually can mobilize calcium in a PLC-dependent manner. In parallel, we also examined D 1 and D 2 receptor colocalization in striatal brain slices as well as in cultured medium spiny neurons. Although we found evidence using bacterial artificial chromosome-D 1 and D 2 reporter mice that D 1 and D 2 receptors are co-expressed in a small number of brain regions, we failed to observe D 1 -D 2 receptor colocalization, suggesting the possibility that in neurons the receptors are somehow segregated...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Intrauterine {{insemination}} (IUI) is {{a commonly}} used treatment in subfertile couples. We assessed patients' preferences for IUI relative to expectant management. METHODS: Forty subfertile couples were offered scenarios {{in which the}} treatment-independent pregnancy chance was varied against a fixed pregnancy chance after IUI without or with controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) of 8 % and 12 % per cycle, respectively. The treatment-independent pregnancy chance within 12 months was initially set at 100 %, and subsequently reduced until <b>couples</b> <b>switched</b> preferences. We also investigated {{the impact of the}} risks of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) and multiple pregnancy on couples' preferences. RESULTS: When pregnancy was guaranteed within a year, all couples would opt for expectant management. Most <b>couples</b> <b>switched</b> to IUI without COH at a 60 % chance of a treatment-independent pregnancy and to IUI with COH between a 40 % and 60 % chance. Where the risk of OHSS was set at 10 %, a large majority of the couples preferred expectant management to IUI. At a multiple pregnancy risk of 100 %, 77 % of the couples would still prefer IUI. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of couples prefer IUI with or without COH when the treatment-independent pregnancy chance in the next 12 months is < 50 % and < 40 %, respectively. The risk of a multiple pregnancy does not affect their preference for IUI, whereas IUI is rejected when the risk of OHSS exceeds 10...|$|R
