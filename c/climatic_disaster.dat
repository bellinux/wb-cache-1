40|$|This {{paper is}} a local level {{examination}} of the political spaces and opportunities that arise for radical political agents {{in the aftermath of}} a <b>climatic</b> <b>disaster.</b> It explores the theoretical argument that disasters break the social contract between the state and disaster-affected communities by opening political space for change. The empirical work is based on a large-scale flooding disaster that affected southern Pakistan in 2010 and 2011 and caused international concern around increased Islamist mobilisation through their disaster relief programmes. The case study investigates the extent to which the <b>climatic</b> <b>disaster</b> opened political space for the radical Islamist group, the Jamaat-ud-Dawa, to mobilise. Based on fieldwork conducted in three districts of Sindh in southern Pakistan, this paper demonstrates that climatic disasters are able to impact radical politics.

40|$|The {{process of}} global climate change has been {{associated}} with an increase in the frequency of <b>climatic</b> <b>disasters.</b> Yet, there is still little systematic evidence on the macroeconomic costs of these episodes. This paper uses panel time-series techniques to estimate the short and long-run impact of <b>climatic</b> and other <b>disasters</b> on a country's GDP. The results indicate that a climate related disaster reduces real GDP per capita by at least 0. 6 percent. Therefore, the increased incidence of these disasters during recent decades entails important macroeconomic costs. Among <b>climatic</b> <b>disasters,</b> droughts have the largest average impact, with cumulative losses of 1 percent of GDP per capita. Across groups of countries, small states are more vulnerable than other countries to windstorms, but exhibit a similar response to other types of disasters; and low-income countries responds more strongly to <b>climatic</b> <b>disasters,</b> mainly because of their higher response to droughts. However, a country's level of external debt has no relation to the output impact of any type of disaster.

40|$|Cryopreservation {{appears as}} an {{alternative}} to the preservation of biodiversity due to the risks to lose a part of the genetic resources by <b>climatic</b> <b>disaster,</b> human activities, pests and diseases. Genetic resources are a prerequisite for the establishment of classical and modern plant breeding programmes. By integrating cryopreservation in different biotechnology programmes, the breeders contribute to the preservation of genetic resources and ensure the chance to maintain the plant improvement process. The first step is the creation of a core collection representative of the genetic diversity and including wild and improved varieties. Considering recalcitrant species like coffee and cacao, the development of cryopreservation permitted to secure the core collection. But another advantage is the possibility to maintain embryogenic potential of strains established for elite clones for further propagation. On another hand, to maintain by in vitro culture chicory selected parental clones for seed production or tissues culture stock established for various research purposes is time consuming and exposed to the various risks like contaminations, loss of strain or somaclonal variation. Cryopreservation has been used as a solution to preserve various plant materials for new potential research programme and to reduce efforts to subculture collection. Cryopreservation is now routinely used at the R&D Centre on various species comprising a large number of coffee, cacao and chicory varieties as well as on a collection of tissue cultures established for pharmaceutical, cosmetic purpose of more 100 plant species. vokMyynti MTT, Tietopalvelut 31600 Jokioine...|$|E

30|$|Both Skidmore and Toya (2002) and Loayza et al. (2009) {{found that}} <b>climatic</b> <b>disasters</b> have a {{positive}} impact on economic growth whereas geological events (such as earthquakes) do not have any significant impact. Using a cross-section of 89 developed and developing countries, Skidmore and Toya (2002) found partially a direct relationship between the frequency of <b>climatic</b> <b>disasters</b> and total factor productivity growth. The results for geological disasters indicate no significant effect on the growth of total factor productivity (TFP). The primal contribution of Skidmore and Toya (2002) to the literature on the economics of natural disasters is that they directly assessed the relationship between foreign technology absorption and catastrophic events. Their study shows that natural disasters update capital stock and encourage the adoption of new technologies, which lead to improved TFP and the growth of the gross domestic product (GDP). After controlling for relevant determinants, it is shown that the frequency of <b>climatic</b> <b>disasters</b> is positively associated with TFP growth, human capital accumulation, and GDP per capita growth. One of the reasons behind this association may be explained by the adoption of new technologies. Once natural disasters destroy the capital stock of a country, the economic incentives to replace it with a more improved technology are higher. In other words, natural disasters may provide opportunities to upgrade capital stock that may lead to higher rates of TFP and GDP per capita growth. Such explanations can be regarded as a good example of Schumpeterian creative destruction (see Schumpeter 1942). To the best of my knowledge, Skidmore and Toya (2002) offer arguably the most comprehensive piece of empirical research of measuring the direct long-run impacts of natural disasters on economies.|$|R

40|$|Historically Bangladesh is a {{breeding}} ground for different <b>climatic</b> <b>disasters</b> due to its geographical location and the impacts are huge due to economic condition, high intensity of exposed population and dependency on nature. Climate change is causing an increase in the intensity and frequency of natural disasters. In Bangladesh, coastal areas are susceptible to cyclones, storm surge, salinity intrusion etc. and northern areas are susceptible to drought. In both these areas agriculture is the major mean of livelihood and agriculture is heavily dependent on nature and thus being severely affected by <b>climatic</b> <b>disasters.</b> In the face of <b>climatic</b> change and <b>disasters</b> farmers apply different adaptive measures to survive. Documenting and analyzing the local adaptation practices is vital to design a comprehensive model of adaptation to save agriculture in these areas.

Many local level adaptation practices were found. These adaptation practices can be divided broadly in three groups: protective measures, modification and alternative practice.

There are cases indicating that more disasters are associated with more GDP (Cavallo et al. 2013; Managi & Sharma 2015). As has been pointed out by McDermott et al.

40|$|Natural {{disasters}} and their economic impacts have been neglected {{in the main}} stream of development and growth theories. Only recently {{a body of research}} into the economic effects of natural disasters began to emerge. This body of literature considers both the socio-economic impact caused by natural {{disasters and}} how the socio-economic conditions within a country prior to a natural disaster impacts on the response to disaster event when it occurs. However, most of these discussions fail to adequately integrate this relationship into a general macro-economic model. This paper attempts to analyse the dynamic effect of <b>climatic</b> <b>disasters</b> on key economic variables of the state of Queensland for the period of 1980 to 2010. A Kaleckian-Post-Keynesian multi-sectoral open economy model, which is augmented by a demand driven labour market, a reserve army effect in the Marxian sense and technological change is being utilised and econometric long run relationship between variables are investigated. The paper predominantly emphasises on the link between <b>climatic</b> <b>disasters</b> and sources of economic growth such as state accumulation, savings, income distribution and labour market fluctuations. By employing the Structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) approach by imposing short and long-run restriction on SVAR model. The short run restrictions impose contemporaneous feedback effects among the real sector economic variables and indicators of natural disasters following the methodology described in Bernanke (1986), Blanchard and Watson (1986), and Sims (1986), and the long run restrictions in SVAR approach is an alternative to cointegration for capturing long-run equilibrium relationships.

According to Munich Re (Munich Re 2005), the number of <b>climatic</b> <b>disasters,</b> including floods, and the losses incurred from these disasters have dramatically increased worldwide over the last 50 years. This is explained both by a higher concentration of people and assets in flood-plains and a higher probability of extreme events linked both to climate change or to the fact that urbanisation, land use and development in rural areas result in greater rainwater runoff (OECD 2006). Since private insurance often chooses not to insure catastrophic risks, many countries, including France, have set-up a national solidarity scheme providing partial or total compensation to victims. The consequence of rising flood risks is that public expenditures to control floods and to provide coverage of flood damages are increasing rapidly.
