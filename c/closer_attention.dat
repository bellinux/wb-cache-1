As a result, MIGA has paid <b>closer</b> <b>attention</b> to exceptionally risky countries that have little appeal to foreign investors, and has insured projects among nations in the global south. MIGA conducted a survey in 2010 which showed that political risk is the most important deterrent of long-term foreign direct investment in developing countries, even more than economic uncertainty and poor public infrastructure. MIGA's Council of Governors amended the agency's convention in 2010 in an attempt to improve the organization's effectiveness by expanding the range of investments eligible for political risk insurance.|$|E

25|$|Oxytocin is {{typically}} remembered {{for the effect}} it has on prosocial behaviors, such as its role in facilitating trust and attachment between individuals. Consequently, oxytocin {{is often referred to}} as the “love hormone". However, oxytocin has a more complex role than solely enhancing prosocial behaviors. There is consensus that oxytocin modulates fear and anxiety; that is, it does not directly elicit fear or anxiety. Two dominant theories explain the role of oxytocin in fear and anxiety. One theory states that oxytocin increases approach/avoidance to certain social stimuli and the second theory states that oxytocin increases the salience of certain social stimuli, causing the animal or human to pay <b>closer</b> <b>attention</b> to socially relevant stimuli.|$|E

"Her chief characteristics… were {{a strong}} will and a {{singularly}} straightforward habit {{of thought and}} action", wrote her mother's friend Anna Vyrubova, who recalled Olga's hot temper and her struggles to keep it under control. [...] "Admirable qualities in a woman, these same characteristics are often trying in childhood, and Olga {{as a little girl}} sometimes showed herself willful and even disobedient." [...] Olga idolized her father and wore a necklace with an icon of St. Nicholas on her chest. She, like her siblings, enjoyed games of tennis and swimming with her father during their summer holidays and often confided in him when she went with him on long walks. Though she also loved Alexandra, her relationship with her mother was somewhat strained during her adolescence and early adulthood. [...] "Olga is always most unamiable about every proposition, though may end by doing what I wish", wrote Alexandra to Nicholas on March 13, 1916. [...] "And when I am severe — sulks me." [...] In another letter to Nicholas during World War I, Alexandra complained that Olga's grumpiness, bad humor and general reluctance to make an official visit to the hospital where she usually worked as a Red Cross nurse made things difficult. Olga also occasionally found her mother's attitude trying. Parlormaid Elizaveta Nikolaevna Ersberg told her niece that the Tsar paid <b>closer</b> <b>attention</b> to the children than Alexandra did and Alexandra often was ill with a migraine or quarreled with the servants. In 1913, Olga complained in a letter to her grandmother, Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna about her mother's invalidism. [...] "As usual her heart isn't well", Olga wrote. [...] "It's all so unpleasant." [...] Queen Marie of Romania, who met Olga and her sisters when they visited Romania on a state trip in 1914, commented in her memoirs that the girls were natural and confided in her when Alexandra wasn't present, but when she appeared [...] "they always seemed to be watching her every expression so as to be sure to act according to her desires." ...|$|E

2500|$|The post-1990 era {{has seen}} what some {{observers}} term the [...] "return of the amateur filmmaker" [...] as state censorship policies after the Tiananmen Square demonstrations produced an edgy underground film movement loosely {{referred to as}} the Sixth Generation. Owing to the lack of state funding and backing, these films were shot quickly and cheaply, using materials like 16 mm film and digital video and mostly non-professional actors and actresses, producing a documentary feel, often with long takes, hand-held cameras, and ambient sound; more akin to Italian neorealism and cinéma vérité than the often lush, far more considered productions of the Fifth Generation. Unlike the Fifth Generation, the Sixth Generation brings a more individualistic, anti-romantic life-view and pays far <b>closer</b> <b>attention</b> to contemporary urban life, especially as affected by disorientation, rebellion and dissatisfaction with China's contemporary social tensions. Many were made with an extremely low budget (an example is Jia Zhangke, who shoots on digital video, and formerly on 16mm; Wang Xiaoshuai's The Days (1993) were made for US$10,000). The title and subjects of many of these films reflect the Sixth Generation's concerns. The Sixth Generation takes an interest in marginalized individuals and the less represented fringes of society. For example, Zhang Yuan's hand-held Beijing Bastards (1993) focuses on youth punk subculture, featuring artists like Cui Jian, Dou Wei and He Yong frowned upon by many state authorities, while Jia Zhangke's debut film Xiao Wu (1997) concerns a provincial pickpocket.|$|E

2500|$|Egyptian Arabic {{is used in}} {{most social}} situations, with Modern Standard and Classical Arabic {{generally}} only being used in writing and in highly religious and/or formal situations. However, within Egyptian Arabic, {{there is a wide}} range of variation. El-Said Badawi identifies three distinct levels of Egyptian Arabic based chiefly on the quantity of non-Arabic lexical items in the vocabulary: ʿĀmmiyyat al-Musaqqafīn (Cultured Colloquial or Formal Spoken Arabic), ʿĀmmiyyat al-Mutanawwirīn (Enlightened or Literate Colloquial), and ʿĀmmiyyat al-'Ummiyīn (Illiterate Colloquial). Cultured Colloquial/Formal Spoken Arabic is characteristic of the educated classes and is the language of discussion of high-level subjects, but it is nevertheless Egyptian Arabic; it is characterized by use of technical terms imported from foreign languages and MSA, as well as <b>closer</b> <b>attention</b> to the pronunciation of certain letters (particularly qāf). It is relatively standardized and, being closer to the standard, is understood fairly well across the Arab world. On {{the opposite end of the}} spectrum, Illiterate Colloquial, common to rural areas and to working-class neighborhoods in the cities, has an almost exclusively Arabic vocabulary; loanwords are generally either very old borrowings (e.g. [...] , [...] "shrimp," [...] from Italian gamberi, [...] "shrimp" [...] (pl.)) or refer to technological items that find no or poor equivalents in Arabic (e.g. [...] , television). Enlightened Colloquial (ʿĀmmiyyat al-Mutanawwirīn) is the language of those who have had some schooling and are relatively affluent; loanwords tend to refer to pop-cultural items, consumer products, and fashions. It is also understood widely in the Arab world, as it is the lingua franca of Egyptian film and television.|$|E
2500|$|TEPCO admits for {{the first}} time that it had failed to take {{stronger}} measures to prevent disasters for fear of inviting lawsuits or protests against its nuclear plants. TEPCO's internal reform task force, led by company President Naomi Hirose, said in a report TEPCO had feared efforts to better protect nuclear facilities from severe accidents such as tsunamis would trigger anti-nuclear sentiment, interfere with operations or increase litigation risks. TEPCO could have mitigated the impact of the accident if it had diversified power and cooling systems by paying <b>closer</b> <b>attention</b> to international standards and recommendations, the report said. TEPCO also should have trained employees with practical crisis management skills rather than conduct obligatory drills as a formality, it said. In the internal report TEPCO said that before the accident it had been afraid to consider the risk of such a large tsunami as the one in March 2011 which hit Fukushima, fearing admissions of risk could result in public pressure to shut plants down. [...] "There were concerns that if new countermeasures against severe accidents were installed, concern would spread in host communities that the current plants had safety problems," [...] the report said. TEPCO said in the report that [...] "severe accident measures" [...] were taken in 2002, which included [...] "containment venting and power supply cross-ties between units," [...] but additional measures were never put in place. [...] TEPCO added that taking such measures could also add to [...] "public anxiety and add momentum to anti-nuclear movements." ...|$|E
