2500|$|In its {{classical}} and modern forms, the alphabet has 19 consonant and 21 vowel letters. However, {{instead of being}} written sequentially like {{the letters of the}} Latin script, Hangul letters are grouped into blocks, such as [...] han, each of which transcribes a syllable. That is, although the syllable [...] han may look like a single character, it is actually composed of three letters: [...] h, [...] a, and [...] n. Each syllabic block consists of two to six letters, including at least one consonant and one vowel. These blocks are then arranged horizontally from left to right or vertically from top to bottom. Each Korean word consists of one or more syllables, hence one or more blocks. The number of mathematically possible distinct blocks is 11,172, though there are far fewer possible syllables allowed by Korean phonotactics, and not all phonotactically possible syllables occur in actual Korean words.

40|$|The initial {{purpose of}} the study was to {{determine}} the potential of acetaldehyde (Ace) to increase the rate of sister-chromatid exchanges (SCEs) in mouse spermatogonia. We tested four doses of Ace (from 0. 4 to 400. 0 mg/kg), including a negative and a positive control group (distilled water and cyclophosphamide, respectively). The results showed that all tested doses were SCE inducers. The highest tested dose increased the control level more than three times. Also, the <b>cumulative</b> <b>frequencies</b> of SCEs per cell were higher in the Ace-treated animals than in the control cells. Ace is transformed into acetate through the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase, a process that may be blocked by disulfiram (Dis) generating the accumulation of Ace. The second {{purpose of the}} study was to determine if the administration of Dis (150 mg/kg) could increase the SCE rate produced by non-genotoxic doses of Ace. (0. 004 and 0. 04 mg/kg). The animals treated with the two doses of Ace alone showed no increase in the frequency of SCEs; also, Dis by itself was not an SCE inducer. However, the groups of animals previously treated with Dis showed an increase of 31 and 60 % with respect to the values obtained with the two doses of Ace alone. Furthermore, the <b>cumulative</b> <b>frequencies</b> of SCEs per cell were higher in the animals administered with both compounds together than in those treated with them separately.

40|$|The {{classical}} {{approach to}} correspondence analysis (CA) {{is designed to}} allow its user to a graphically summarize the association between two or more categorical variables that form a contingency table. Despite its popularity and utility, the classical approach does not take in consideration the structure of ordered variables. One way to performing CA when the variables have an ordered structure is to consider the Taguchi’s statistic (Taguchi, 1974). Beh, D’Ambra, Simonetti (2010) demonstrated the applicability of considering this statistic which {{takes into account the}} ordered structure by considering the cumulative sum of cell frequencies across the variable. Thus, the statistic is defined by summing the chi-squared statistic for each I × 2 contingency table obtained by aggregating the column categories 1 to j and aggregating the column categories (j+ 1) to J. For this reason, the Taguchi’s statistic is also referred to as cumulative chi-squared statistic (Nair; 1987). Cuadras (2002) proposes an approach to correspondence analysis based on double <b>cumulative</b> <b>frequencies.</b> However, it does not decompose any known index. In this paper we explore a generalization of Taguchi’s statistic which takes into account the presence of two ordinal categorical variables by considering their cumulative sum of cell frequencies. This generalization is analogous to the doubly cumulative chi-squared statistic which is constructed by summing the chi-squared statistic for each 2 × 2 sub-table formed by pooling adjacent rows and columns of the original contingency table; see Hirotsu (1986). We illustrate this approach to CA using a partition of the statistic proposed by Hirotsu. Its application presents some interesting properties and allows the analyst to represent the variations of row and column categories rather than the categories on the space generated by <b>cumulative</b> <b>frequencies...</b>|$|R
