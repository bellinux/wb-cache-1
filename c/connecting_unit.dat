40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a new method of analysing the harmonic content of direct <b>connected</b> generator-HVdc convertor <b>units.</b> Existing analysis techniques are reviewed, and {{their strengths and}} weaknesses are discussed. A set of simultaneous equations that fully describes the harmonic interaction among the generators, convertors and the dc system is derived. The simultaneous equations are solved using Newton's method. By exploiting the sparse nature of the Jacobian matrix of partial derivatives, the solution is obtained quickly. The solution of a test system is verified by means of dynamic simulations. The developed unified solution is a significant improvement on existing harmonic analysis. A harmonic model of the salient-pole generator is developed and validated against time domain simulations and harmonic measurement results obtained from the Benmore convertor station when being operated as a group <b>connected</b> <b>unit.</b> The relationship between the generator terminal voltages and currents {{in the presence of}} saliency can be represented by analytical expressions in sequence components, derived from normal machine parameters. The effect of generator saturation on the harmonic content is not significant. The effect of rotor angle on the commutation process in the presence of saliency is significant in direct <b>connected</b> <b>units.</b> By choosing the generator terminal voltage as the firing angle reference, existing firing control for conventional HVdc schemes can be used for direct <b>connected</b> <b>units</b> with practically no modification. Provided that the nominal firing angles are kept within the restriction limits, imposed by the overlap angle, generator terminal power factor, equivalent continuous negative-sequence harmonic loading and the number of generators, practically no extra capacity for harmonic current loading is required in direct <b>connected</b> <b>units.</b> The generator harmonic ratings can be taken at the nominal speed and rated power output. Conventional tuned dc filters are ineffective in adjustable speed operation. Finally, detailed three-phase harmonic information of the Benmore convertor station when being operated in the group connected mode is collected and discussed. The test results are used for validating the developed models, and they also provide valuable evidence of the feasibility of direct <b>connected</b> <b>units...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe models most {{commonly}} {{used to describe the}} antenna organization of the photosynthetic membrane are the <b>connected</b> <b>units</b> model and the domain model. The theoretical descriptions of the exciton dynamics according to these models are reviewed with emphasis on a common nomenclature. Based on this nomenclature we compare for the two models the kinetics and yields of photochemistry and fluorescence under non-annihilation and annihilation conditions both under continuous light and under flash excitation. The general case is considered, that all initially open reaction centers become gradually closed and that exciton transfer between photosynthetic units (PSUs) is possible. Then, calculated kinetics and yields depend on the model assumptions made to account for the exciton transfer between PSUs. Here we extend the <b>connected</b> <b>units</b> model to flash excitation including exciton-exciton annihilation, and present a new simple mathematical formalism of the domain model under continuous light and flash excitation without annihilation. Product and fluorescence yields predicted by the <b>connected</b> <b>units</b> model for different degrees of connectivity are compared with those predicted by the domain model using the same sets of rate constants. From these calculations we conclude that it is hardly possible to distinguish experimentally between different models by any current method. If at all, classical fluorescence induction measurements are more suited for assessing the excitonic connectivity between PSUs than ps experiments...|$|R

40|$|It is {{notoriously}} {{difficult to predict}} the behaviour of a complex self-organizing system, where the interactions among dynamical units form a heterogeneous topology. Even if the dynamics of each microscopic unit is known, a real understanding of {{their contributions to the}} macroscopic system behaviour is still lacking. Here we develop information-theoretical methods to distinguish the contribution of each individual unit to the collective out-of-equilibrium dynamics. We show that for a system of <b>units</b> <b>connected</b> by a network of interaction potentials with an arbitrary degree distribution, highly <b>connected</b> <b>units</b> have less impact on the system dynamics as compared to intermediately <b>connected</b> <b>units.</b> In an equilibrium setting, the hubs are often found to dictate the long-term behaviour.

40|$|The present work {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of the n-type layer in the <b>connecting</b> <b>unit</b> on the performance of tandem organic light-emitting devices (OLEDs). The n-type layer is typically an organic electron-transporting layer doped with reactive metals. By systematically varying the metal dopants and the electron-transporting hosts, we have identified the important factors affecting the performance of the tandem OLEDs. Contrary to common belief, device characteristics were found to be insensitive to metal work functions, as supported by the ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy results that the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals of all metal-doped n-type layers studied here have similar energy levels. It suggests that the electron injection barriers from the connecting units are not sensitive to the metal dopant used. On the other hand, it was found that performance of the n-type layers depends on their electrical conductivities which can be improved by using an electron- transporting host with higher electron mobility. This effect is further modulated by the optical transparency of constituent organic layers. The efficiency of tandem OLEDs would decrease as the optical transmittance decreases. © 2007 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
