40|$|To {{meet the}} needs of the {{shooting}} preserve community and provide a supply of birds to replenish wild-managed areas, artificial propagation and release of bobwhite quail (Colinus virginianus) is a common practice. Although commercial production has con-tinually increased, limited information exists concerning management and nutritional re-quirements for the <b>confined</b> <b>rearing</b> of these birds. Early mortality during the first week of life is a major concern for producers, and recom-mendations that contribute to an improvement in livability are of interest. Wilson and Dugan [1] approached this concern with feed and wa-ter availability and posthatch holding. Their re-sults showed that a posthatch delay in feed and water availability of as little as 4 h will reduce early BW, with greater reductions observed for BW and mortality when a delay of 24 h was imposed. Our approach was to investigate the effects of delayed placement after hatching o...|$|E
40|$|Along {{with the}} fast {{development}} of aquaculture in the Mediterranean, {{a number of}} emerging parasitic diseases was observed in cage-reared fish, which in <b>confined</b> <b>rearing</b> conditions induced mortality or/and indirect economical losses related to suppressed growth. The trend of diversification of aquaculture products {{and the introduction of}} new fish species in the rearing system, helped the introduction of new parasitic pathogens along with their host in the new environment. The process resulted in the adaptation of parasites and in a switch to resident aquaculture species (sea bass and sea bream) or/and increase of prevalence and abundance of parasites on newly introduced fish species. In both cases, the parasitofauna of reared fish even impoverished in terms of species richness and showed greater population values than in the wild fish population. Even if the Mediterranean parasitofauna of reared fish was the issue of numerous publications in the past decade, only occasional findings and reports concerned its specificities in the Adriatic Sea...|$|E
40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of aquaculture in the Mediterranean, {{a number of}} parasitic diseases have emerged in cage-reared fish. In <b>confined</b> <b>rearing</b> conditions, the diseases can induce mortality and economic losses related to suppressed growth. With diversification of aquaculture products {{and the introduction of}} new fish species into the rearing system, new parasitic pathogens have found their way into new environments, resulting in adaptation of the parasite, new colonization on resident aquaculture species (primarily sea bass and sea bream), or increased parasite prevalence and abundance on the newly cultivated fish species. The parasitofauna of reared fish is impoverished in terms of species richness and has greater population values than in the wild fish population. While the parasitofauna of fish reared in the Mediterranean is discussed in numerous publications, only occasional findings specifically refer to the Adriatic Sea. Wild fish populations in the Adriatic Sea have been sampled for parasite isolation and identification but an overview of reared fish parasitofauna has never been reported. This was the main goal of this study...|$|E
40|$|Two {{models have}} been {{proposed}} to explain the adventurous gliding motility of Myxococcus xanthus: (i) polar secretion of slime and (ii) an unknown motor that uses cell surface adhesion complexes that form periodic attachments along the cell length.

40|$|Fishery {{and biology}} {{of the giant}} trevally, Caranx ignobilis {{exploited}} along the Tuticorin coast of Tamilnadu were monitored during 2001 - 2006. Fishery occurred round the year with peak landings during April-August. Spawning and recruitment occur almost round the year with peak during November-December. Young ones are abundant in shallow coastal waters and as grows, they move to deeper waters. Growth parameters, L"' and K are estimated respectively as 143. 6 cm and 0. 69 /year and 'to' as - 0. 0242 year. Estimates show that they grow fast and attain 73, 108, 126 and 134 cm in total length by first, second, third and fourth year respectively. Their weight increment is also fast and attains 5. 5 kg, 16. 8 kg, 25. 9 kg and 33. 7 kg respectively during the period. Stock assessment indicated that the stock at present is over exploited and under heavy fishing pressure. Rearing trial in aquarium tank showed that they are compatible to <b>confined</b> <b>rearing</b> conditions. Based on the distribution and biology of the species, their mariculture potential is discussed...|$|E
40|$|This {{study used}} 26 Bergamasca ewe lambs weaned at 60 days {{of age and}} {{separated}} into 2 groups - Artificial suckling: 10 ewes separated from their dams 48 hours after delivery and fed with cow's milk; Controlled suckling: 16 ewe lambs remained with their dams at pasture {{during the day and}} then separated at night, returning after morning milking. Following weaning, both groups were confined until they reached 38. 6 kg average weight, and then separated into two types of treatment: Pasture rearing: 5 ewes from artificial suckling + 8 ewes from controlled suckling; Confined rearing: 5 ewes from artificial suckling + 8 ewes from controlled suckling. The experimental design was a 2 Ã— 2 factorial, randomized. Average daily milk production for artificial suckling (0. 318 kg) was higher than controlled suckling (0. 256 kg). The economic return of the controlled suckling treatment was 8. 13 % higher than for artificial suckling.

40|$|As {{consumers}} {{and society in}} general {{become more aware of}} ethical and moral dilemmas associated with <b>confined</b> <b>rearing</b> systems, pressure is put on the animal and poultry industries to adopt alternative forms of housing. This presents challenges especially regarding managing competitive social interactions between animals. However, selective breeding programs are rapidly advancing, enhanced by both genomics and new quantitative genetic theory and offer potential solutions by improving adaptation of the bird to existing and proposed production environments. The outcomes of adaptation could lead to improvement of animal welfare by increasing fitness of the animal for the given environments, which might lead to increased contentment and decreased distress in those systems. Genomic selection, based on dense genetic markers, will allow for more rapid improvement of traits that are expensive or difficult to measure, or have a low heritability, such as pecking, cannibalism, robustness, mortality, leg score, bone strength, disease resistance, and thus has the potential to address many poultry welfare concerns. Recently selection programs to include social effects, known as associative or indirect genetic effects (IGE), have received much attention. Group, kin, multi-level and multi-trait selection have all been shown to be highly effective in reducing mortality while increasing productivity of poultry layers and reduce or eliminate the need for beak trimming. Also, multi-level selection was shown to increases robustness as indicated by l greater ability of birds to cope with stressors. Kin selection {{has been shown to be}} easy to implement and improve both productivity and animal well-being. Because social effects are improved with such programs, it might be possible to increase stocking density, increase light levels, and use larger groups in floor pens. However, such changes raise ethical concerns that may constrain making these choices...|$|E

The gram-negative bacterium Myxococcus xanthus glides on surfaces using two independent propulsive engines: (i) S (so-cial) -motility, {{which is similar to}} twitching motility in Pseudo-monas aeruginosa (4), is driven by extension, adhesion, and retraction of polar type IV pili (3); and (ii) A (adventurous) -motility, which is driven by an uncharacterized engine hypoth-esized to be associated with slime secretion (8).

40|$|At first sight, dissociative {{identity}} disorder (DID) and schizophrenia seemas {{far apart}} as any two conditions could be. DID is almost entirely seenas an immediate consequence of severe early abuse (Fonagy & Target, 1995), whereas schizophrenia is largely seen as a genetic predisposition that does not surface until late adolescence or adulthood. However, this consensus view, this reality, falls apart when the surface is scratched. In particular, the genetic predisposition is minimal, and largely irrelevant to prevention, treat-ment, or healing. Perhaps surprisingly, a diagnosis of DID is seen as controversial {{in spite of the}} consistency of diagnosis, yet the far less reliable diagnosis of schizophrenia is seen as science that is as hard and alien as the word itself. This misperception may be a consequence of the widely quoted 50 % concordance rate for schizo-phrenia between identical twins (schizophrenia. com) (Frith and Johnstone, 2003). Were this to be true, it might indicate that schizophrenia is primarily a genetic disease and might respond to drugs and brain operations. I, like many others, would assume this figure is meaningless unless it is <b>confined</b> to twins <b>reared</b> apart, and I have joined many professionals in being surprised to fin...|$|R
40|$|We present HHT {{observations}} in the N= 3 - 2 rotational transition of the CN radical toward selected {{positions of the}} Trapezium region and of the molecular Ridge in the Orion molecular cloud. Two of the positions in the Ridge were also observed in the N= 2 - 1 line of CN and 13 CN. The N= 3 - 2 CN lines have been combined with observations of the N= 2 - 1 and N= 1 - 0 transitions of CN, and of the N= 2 - 1 of 13 CN to estimate the physical conditions and CN abundances in the molecular gas. We analyze in detail the excitation of the CN lines and find that the hyperfine ratios of the N= 3 - 2 line are always close to the Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) optically thin values even {{in the case of}} optically thick emission. This is due to different excitation temperatures for the different hyperfine lines. From the line intensity ratios between the different CN transitions we derive H_ 2 densities of 10 ^ 5 cm^- 3 for the molecular Ridge and of 3 x 10 ^ 6 cm^- 3 for the Trapezium region. The CN column densities are one order of magnitude larger in the Ridge than in the Trapezium region, but the CN to H_ 2 ratio is similar both in the Trapezium and in the Ridge. The combination of the low CN column densities, high H_ 2 densities and relatively high CN abundances toward the Trapezium region requires that the CN emission arises from a thin layer with a depth along the line of sight of only 5 Ìƒx 10 ^ 15 cm. This high density thin layer of molecular gas seems to be related with material that <b>confines</b> the <b>rear</b> side of the HII region Orion A. However the molecular layer is not moving as expected from the expansion of the HII region, but it is "static" with respect to the gas in the molecular cloud. We discuss the implication of a high density "static" layer in the evolution of an HII region. Comment: 16 pages, 5 figures,accepted for Ap...|$|R
