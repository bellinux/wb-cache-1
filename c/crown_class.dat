40|$|Thinning has an {{important}} role in silviculture practice for quality and thick stem production. But, epicormic branches decrease the value of the trunk or timber as a result of thinning, especially in broadleaved species. In this study, the effect of thinning intensity and <b>crown</b> <b>class</b> on epicormic branching were investigated in narrow-leaved ash (Fraxinus angustifolia) plantation, Adapazarı-Turkey. The plantation was 36 years old established at 3 x 2 m initial spacing (1666 trees/ha). Prior the thinning mean stand diameter, top height, basal area and stem number were 31 cm, 34 m and 32 m 2 /ha and 416 stem/ha, respectively. Thinning intensities were removal of basal area 0 % (control), 22 % (moderate) and 38 % (heavy). Results showed that; thinning intensity, <b>crown</b> <b>class</b> (dominant and co-dominant trees) and thinning intensity x <b>crown</b> <b>class</b> interaction had no significant effect on epicormic branching after four years of growth. Very few (< 1 number per stem) new epicormic branch were formed on stems of dominant and co-dominant trees represent final crop. Consequently, narrow leaved ash has very low epicormic branching risk in reaction to thinning and this can be an advantage for species in producing thick and valuable stems...|$|E
40|$|Tree {{growth is}} one of the main {{variables}} needed for forest management planning. The use of simple models containing traditional equations to describe tree growth is common. However, equations that incorporate different factors (e. g. site quality of the stands, crown classes of the trees, silvicultural treatments) may improve their accuracy in a wide range of stand conditions. The aim of this work was to compare the accuracy of tree diameter growth models using (i) a family of simple equations adjusted by stand site quality and <b>crown</b> <b>class</b> of trees, and (ii) a unique global equation including stand and individual tree variables. Samplings were conducted in 136 natural even-aged Nothofagus antarctica (Forster f.) Oersted stands in Southern Patagonia (Argentina) covering age (20 – 200 years), <b>crown</b> <b>class</b> and site quality gradients. The following diameter growth models were fitted: 16 simple equations using two independent variables (age and one equation for each stand site quality or <b>crown</b> <b>class)</b> based on Richards model, plus a unique global equation using three independent variables (age, stand site quality and <b>crown</b> <b>class).</b> Simple equations showed higher variability in their accuracy, explained between 54 % and 92 % of the data variation. The global model presented similar accuracy like the better equations of the simple growth models. The unification of the simple growth models into a unique global equation did not greatly improve the accuracy of estimations, but positively influenced the biological response of the model. Another advantage of the global equation is the simple use under a wide range of natural stand conditions. The proposed global model allows to explain the tree growth of N. antarctica trees along the natural studied gradients. Fil: Ivancich, Horacio Simón.

40|$|In 1994, two ice storms hit the ridge-and-valley {{region of}} southwestern Virginia. Large-diameter trees {{experienced}} {{high levels of}} branch breakage and many small-diameter trees were bent {{under the weight of}} the ice. To right themselves, the conifers formed compression wood. The objective of this study was to quantify the influence of stem diameter, age, <b>crown</b> <b>class,</b> tree location, and influence of nearest neighbor on compression wood formed following the 1994 ice storms in eastern white pine (Pinus strobus, L.). Pinus strobus within a 50 x 100 m plot were destructively sampled at Virginia Techs’ Fishburn Forest in southwestern Virginia and cross-sectional disks were removed at stump height. Disks were sanded, cross-dated, and scanned. Tree locations were spatially mapped with a laser transit, along with distance and attributes of the nearest neighboring trees. The images of the scanned disks were imported into Photoshop and the amount of compression wood formed in the years following 1994 was measured as a percentage of total area in the cross-section. The white pine exhibited a two-age structure with younger trees establishing in 1990 s and older trees in the 1960 s. Through a comparison of these two age classes, the formation of compression wood appeared to be age independent; however diameter and <b>crown</b> <b>class</b> were related to amount of compression wood formed by the white pines following the 1994 ice storms with smaller diameter and lower crown classes forming relatively more compression wood compared to larger, dominant individuals...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1972 An {{understanding}} {{of the dynamics of}} individual tree and stand growth, development, and structural patterns during the immature formative years of a commercial species is essential to determine correct thinning practices necessary to attain desired objectives. This study compared a natural, medium-site Douglas-fir stand and an adjacent similar stand released by a severe crown thinning in 1955 at 45 years of age. Individual tree measurement and classification data collected in 1955 and in 1970 from all stems 1. 5 inches and larger on permanent one-acre research plots within each stand were used to compare growth and developmental changes occurring during the interval. In addition, the Douglas-fir on both plots were measured in 1970 with a Barr and Stroud optical dendrometer to determine volumetric and morphological differences. The interplot and intraplot characteristics manifested during {{and at the end of}} the 15 -year period on each study area were examined. Structural changes of crown classes and components were delineated and investigated. Regression analyses were performed to compare basal area growth rates and volume similarities or differences by crown classes within and between the plots. After 15 years, the thinned stand was superior in site index, stand restructuring for dominance, basal area growth, and d. b. h. - volume relationships based on total cubic foot volume inside bark. Neither the ratio of live crown length to total height nor defect due to crown breakage and resulting Fomes cajanderi had an influence on subsequent <b>crown</b> <b>class</b> movement or basal area growth rate. Mortality was caused by suppression, and occurred in the intermediate and overtopped crown classes. The dynamics and magnitude of <b>crown</b> <b>class</b> movement, especially stability in the dominant class and the proportion of upward movement by the intermediate and codominant classes were greater than previously observed in other studies. This phenomenon has a major impact on silvicultural decisions, and warrants further intensive investigation. Intermediate trees showed the greatest vertical <b>crown</b> <b>class</b> movement; overtopped trees were candidates for mortality in the near future. The greatest actual basal area growth on an individual tree basis occurred in the dominant class on the thinned plot, but the larger codominants and the smaller dominants from the same plot exhibited superior potential for response to release with proportionally larger basal area increases. All crown classes except overtopped on the thinned study area were capable o relatively greater basal area growth than their unthinned counterparts. Fifteen years after release, the volumes of the dominant and codominant trees on the thinned area were significantly greater than the dominants and codominants of corresponding d. b. h. s on the unthinned plot. The d. b. h., height, crown length, and crown surface area were also substantially greater in these crown classes on the thinned plot. At 60 years of age, both plots were forming into three crown classes [...] a dominant, a codominant, and an intermediate-overtopped group based on <b>crown</b> <b>class</b> structure, basal area growth, and volume characteristics. The thinned stand, however, had relatively superior characteristics in these categories. The need for intensive periodic remeasurement of single-tree plots to determine the effects of genetics, tree physiology, microsite, and the spatial-distribution relationship on growth and development is discussed...|$|E
