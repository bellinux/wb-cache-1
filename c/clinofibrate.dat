Daily dose of <b>clinofibrate</b> was 200 mg for the initial four weeks, 400 mg for the second four weeks, and 600 mg for the subsequent 16 weeks. Serum and very-low density lipoprotein (VLDL) triglyceride were decreased by 36 % and 48 %, respectively. Neither total cholesterol nor apolipoprotein B changed significantly, whereas cholesterol was decreased in VLDL and increased in low (LDL) and high density lipoprotein (HDL) fractions. Post-heparin plasma lipoprotein lipase (LPL) before treatment was not lower than the normal value, and we found no change in LPL activity following <b>clinofibrate.</b> Hepatic triglyceride lipase also did not change. Apolipoprotein (apo) C-II/C-III ratio was low as compared to the normal value before treatment, and the ratio was increased by 38 % after the treatment. Decrease in VLDL triglyceride was associated with increase in apo C-II/C-III ratio in all the cases. Abnormal enrichment with triglyceride of LDL and HDL fractions was improved by <b>clinofibrate.</b> Although one patient had a transient and asymptomatic elevation of serum creatine phosphokinase, no patient had muscle pain. There was no accumulation of the drug in the 24 week trial. These results suggest that <b>clinofibrate</b> is an effective and safe approach to the management of dyslipidemia in CAPD patients...|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} effect of a lipid {{clearing}} agent (dlinofibrate) on the osteocytes of rabbits treated with corticosteroids. Thirty-one rabbits were divided into four groups: (A) steroid-treated with a normal diet, (B) steroid-treated and on a diet with added <b>clinofibrate,</b> (C) non-steroid-treated, on a diet with clinofibrate; and (D) non-steroid-treated on a normal diet. All the steroid-treated animals demonstrated hyperlipidaemia and fatty degeneration of the liver. Lipid-containing osteocytes were seen in the femoral heads of these animals. However, those which received <b>clinofibrate</b> (group B) had less severe lipidaemia, and less severe degeneration of the liver. In them, only the osteocytes around the haversian canals exhibited lipid inclusions. <b>Clinofibrate</b> appears to modify lipid metabolism, diminishing the steroid induced accumulation of lipids within osteocytes. This effect may protect against steroid-mediated osteonecrosis. One of the most disabling side effects of systemic corticosteroid therapy is osteonecrosis. The pathogenesis of this disorder is uncertain and among the several hypotheses that have been proposed are osteoporosis leading to microfractures (Freiberger and Swanson 1965; Solomon 1973), coagulation abnormalities (Boettcher et al 1970), fat embolisation (Jones and Sakovich 1966...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>clinofibrate</b> on serum {{lipoprotein}} concentrations, leci-thin cholesterol acyl transferase activity and atherogenic index were studied in 10 diabetes mellitus patients. The patients comprised five with well-controlled non-insulin-dependent diabetes, and five with poorly controlled insulin-dependent diabetes; six non-insulin-depend-ent diabetics acted as placebo controls. No adverse side-effects were reported {{and there were}} no significant changes in total cholesterol, triglyceride or high-density lipoprotein 3 -cholesterol concentrations following 600 mglkg <b>clinofibrate</b> treatment for 4 weeks in either insulin-dependent or non-insulin-dependent diabetics. High-density lipoprotein-cholesterol concentrations and lecithin cholesterol acyl transferase activity were significantly (P< 0. 05) increased by clinofi-brate treatment in insulin-dependent and non-insulin-dependent dia-betics and high-density lipoprotein 2 -cholesterol concentrations were significantly (P< 0. 05) increased by dinofibrate in insulin-dependent diabetics. The atherogenic index was significantly (P<O. OI) reduced in non-insulin-dependent diabetics. It is suggested that the enhanced plasma lecithin cholesterol acyl transferase activity following dinofi-brate therapy is the result of increased high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein 2 -cholesterol concentrations and may {{play a central role in}} the efficacy of clinoflbrate.

40|$|Human carboxylesterase (CES) 1 A is {{responsible}} for the biotrans-formation of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors such as imidapril and temocapril. Because antidiabetic or antihyperlipi-demic drugs are often coadministered with ACE inhibitors in clin-ical pharmacotherapy, the inhibitory effect of these drugs on CES 1 A 1 enzyme activity was investigated. In addition, the inhibi-tory effect on CES 2 enzyme activity was evaluated to compare it with that on CES 1 A 1. The inhibitory effects were evaluated with 11 antidiabetic and 12 antihyperlipidemic drugs. The imidapril hydro-lase activity by recombinant CES 1 A 1 was substantially inhibited by lactone ring-containing statins such as simvastatin and lovastatin and thiazolidinediones such as troglitazone and rosiglitazone. The activity in human liver microsomes was also strongly inhibited by simvastatin and troglitazone (Ki 0. 8 0. 1 and 5. 6 0. 2 M, respectively). However, statins containing no lactone ring such as pravastatin and fluvastatin did not show strong inhibition. 7 -Ethyl- 10 -[4 -(1 -piperidono) - 1 -piperidono]carbonyloxycamptothecin hydrolase activity by recombinant human CES 2 was substantially inhibited by fenofibrate (Ki 0. 04 0. 01 M) as well as by simvastatin (0. 67 0. 09 M). Other fibrates such as <b>clinofibrate</b> and bezafibrate did not show strong inhibition. Thus, the inhibitory effects of the thia-zolidinediones and fenofibrate on CES 1 A 1 and CES 2 were differ-ent. Some statins such as simvastatin and lovastatin, thiazo-lidinediones, and fenofibrate might attenuate the drug efficacy of prodrugs biotransformed by CES 1 A and CES 2...|$|E
40|$|Effects of lipid-lowering {{drugs on}} intermediate-density {{lipoprotein}} in uremic patientsBackgroundPatients with {{chronic renal failure}} often have alterations in lipoprotein profile including elevated very-low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL), and reduced high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels. Among these changes, raised IDL has been shown as an independent risk factor for atherosclerosis in hemodialysis patients. There are {{a limited number of}} studies reporting pharmacological approaches to IDL reduction in a uremic population. MethodsWe therefore summarize the effects of lipid-lowering drugs on IDL levels in patients with chronic renal failure treated by hemodialysis (HD) or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). ResultsFirst, a nicotinic acid analog niceritrol was given to hemodialysis patients. The drug increased HDL-cholesterol by 11 %, but the reductions in VLDL-, IDL- and LDL-cholesterol were not significant. Second, CAPD patients were treated with a fibric acid derivative <b>clinofibrate,</b> which was excreted mainly into bile unlike other drugs in this class. The fibrate resulted in a remarkable reduction in VLDL-triglycerides, although it did not reduce IDL-cholesterol. Finally, an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) pravastatin was used in HD and CAPD patients. Pravastatin reduced IDL- and LDL-cholesterol to the same extent (by 31 %). None of these treatments caused serious adverse effects. ConclusionsWe propose that IDL is an important target in the management of uremic dyslipidemia. To date, statins {{have been shown to be}} suitable for this purpose, although it remains to be clarified whether such an intervention reduces the risk for atherosclerotic vascular events in the uremic population...|$|E
