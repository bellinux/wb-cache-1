500|$|Hugh Jackman as Robert Angier/Lord Caldlow (The Great Danton), {{an aristocratic}} magician. After reading the script, Jackman {{expressed}} interest in playing the part. Christopher Nolan discovered Jackman {{was interested in the}} script, and after meeting him saw that Jackman possessed the qualities of stage showmanship that Nolan was looking for in the role of Angier. Nolan explained that Angier had a [...] "wonderful understanding of the interaction between a performer and a live audience", a quality he believed that Jackman had. Nolan said that Jackman [...] "has the great depth as an actor that hasn't really been explored. People haven't had the chance to really see what he <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>as</b> an actor, and this is a character that would let him do that." [...] Jackman based his portrayal of Angier on 1950s-era American magician Channing Pollock. Jackman also portrays Gerald Root, an alcoholic double used for Angier's New Transported Man.|$|E
500|$|Led Zeppelin {{have been}} {{credited}} with {{a major impact on}} the nature of the music business, particularly in the development of album-orientated rock (AOR) and stadium rock. In 1988 John Kalodner, then-A executive of Geffen Records, remarked that [...] "In my opinion, next to the Beatles they're the most influential band in history. They influence the way music is on records, AOR radio, concerts. They set the standards for the AOR-radio format with 'Stairway to Heaven,' having AOR hits without necessarily having Top 40 hits. They're the ones who did the first real big arena concert shows, consistently selling out and playing stadiums without support. People <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>as</b> well as them, but nobody surpasses them". Andrew Loog Oldham, the former producer and manager of the Rolling Stones, commented on how Led Zeppelin had a major influence on the record business, and the way rock concerts were managed and presented to huge audiences.|$|E
500|$|The {{school is}} {{run as a}} democracy, with {{students}} deciding affairs that range from the curriculum to the behavior code. Lessons are non-compulsory. Neill emphasizes [...] "self-regulation", personal responsibility, freedom from fear, [...] "freedom in sex play", and loving understanding over moral instruction or force. In his philosophy, all attempts to mold children are coercive in nature and therefore harmful. Caretakers are advised to [...] "trust" [...] in the natural process and let children self-regulate such that they live by their own rules and consequently treat with the highest respect {{the rights of others}} to live by their own rules. Neill's [...] "self-regulation" [...] constitutes a child's right to [...] "live freely, without outside authority in things psychic and somatic"—that children eat and come of age when they wants, are never hit, and are [...] "always loved and protected". Children <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>as</b> they please until their actions affect others. In an example, a student can skip French class to play music, but cannot disruptively play music during the French class. Against the popular image of [...] "go as you please schools", Summerhill has many rules. However, they are decided at a schoolwide meeting where students and teachers each have one vote apiece. This does not necessarily mean total cessation to the children, as Neill thought adults were right to bemoan child destruction of property. He considered this tension between adult and child living styles to be natural. Neill felt that most schoolwork and books kept children from their right to play, and that learning should only follow play and not be mixed [...] "to make [...] palatable". Neill found that those students interested in college would complete the prerequisites in two years and of their own volition.|$|E

2500|$|When Neill said {{children}} should be free, he did not mean complete freedom, but freedom without license—that everyone <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>as</b> they like unless such action encroaches upon another's freedom. As such, adults could and should protect children from danger, but not trample their self-regulation. Neill emphasized that adult removal from child affairs was distinct from disregard for their security. He felt that children met their own limits naturally. Neill believed in equal rights between parents and children, and that undesirable [...] "disciplined" [...] or [...] "spoiled" [...] homes were created when those rights were imbalanced. He felt it unnecessary to fulfil all of childhood's requests and had great disdain for spoiled children. Summerhill children were naturally restricted by the school's limited teaching expertise and low funds.|$|E

She had been introduced to Atlantic A Tom Storms through Kent Marcus and Jim Zumwalt, lawyers of managers Dave Steunebrink and Richard Williams, and then eventually signed to Atlantic by Jason Flom. Steunebrink and Richard Williams had originally discovered and signed her to a production deal that was later bought out by Atlantic. The original plan of the label was to turn her into a pop singer, but Williams resisted, saying {{that she wanted to}} play alternative rock music with a band. In an interview with HitQuarters the band's A at Atlantic, Steve Robertson, said, [...] "She {{wanted to make sure that}} we didn't look at her as some straight to Top 40 pop princess. She wanted to make sure that she and her band got the chance to show what they <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>as</b> a rock band writing their own songs." [...] Label president Julie Greenwald and the label staff decided to go with her wishes.
