50|$|It {{works by}} passing cooling air through {{passages}} internal to the blade. Heat is transferred by conduction through the blade, {{and then by}} convection into the air flowing inside of the blade. A large internal surface area is desirable for this method, so the cooling paths tend to be serpentine and full of small fins. The internal passages in the blade may be circular or elliptical in shape. Cooling is achieved by passing the air through these passages from hub towards the blade tip. This cooling air comes from an air compressor. In case of gas turbine the fluid outside is relatively hot which passes through the <b>cooling</b> <b>passage</b> and mixes with the main stream at the blade tip.|$|E

The {{aim is to}} investigate computationally the heat transfer coefficient (HTC) and friction factor (f) along the <b>cooling</b> <b>passage.</b> By using k-epsilon turbulence model, numerical investigations were performed at two steps: first, to validate simulation results from an existing circular pin-fin cooling with staggered arrays against experimental measurement. Seven types structured mesh from coarse (Δy+ = 48. 84) to fine (Δy+ = 1. 21) were evaluated during this step; second, to understand the oblong pin-fins cooling performance on various angle orientation. Simulations were performed by keeping the same initials and boundary conditions as the experiment, and varying Reynolds number from 9, 000 to 36, 000. The result demonstrates that validation can be considered acceptable by developing mesh up to 1. 6 million elements with fine resolution (Δy+ = 1. 21). The expansion factor is a key important factor {{in order to control}} grid quality resolution near wall regions. CFD predicted HTC and pressure loss are in good agreement with available experimental data, even though it is found over-prediction data after the second pin-fin row in the HTC simulation. Investigation of three different oblong pin-fins cooling (GN 1, GN 2 and GN 4) shows that the HTC of pin-fin GN 2 is the greatest level compared to other configurations. The HTC of pin-fins surface increases moderately along the <b>cooling</b> <b>passage</b> due to the increase of flow turbulence that caused by contraction channel and increasing Reynolds number.

40|$|ABSTRACT This CFD study {{presents}} the performance {{evaluation of a}} blade <b>cooling</b> <b>passage.</b> An experimental model with seven-row of inline circular pin-fins is chosen in this study. Simulations consider two types; i. e. ‘warm’ test with isothermal wall condition and ‘cold’ test with adiabatic wall condition respectively, in order to evaluate flow and thermal characteristics such as heat transfer coefficient (HTC) and friction factor (f). The steady RANS with k-epsilon turbulence model {{was carried out by}} two-stages investigating: firstly, validation of an existing circular staggered array of pin-fin cooling that has been experimentally studied by other researcher. Three types structured mesh from coarse (Δy+ = 11. 83) to fine (Δy+ = 1. 23) were applied for validation. Secondly, further investigation of the circular pin-fin cooling with in-line array was simulated by adopting the same scenario of mesh generation based on the optimum result from validation stage. Simulations were performed by keeping the same initials and boundary conditions as experiment, and varying Reynolds number between 9. 000 and 36. 000. The result indicates that the CFD predicted data can be considered acceptable by generating mesh up to 1. 6 million elements with fine resolution (Δy+ = 1. 23). The CFD predicted HTC and pressure loss are in good agreement with available experimental data, though over-prediction data is clearly seen after the second pin-fin row for warm simulation. By comparing the pin-fin array between “staggered” and “in-line”, {{it was found that the}} HTC of staggered array is higher than the in-line orientation. It is due to the staggered layout causes to intensify the coolant flow around the pin-fin.
