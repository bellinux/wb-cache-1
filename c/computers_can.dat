5|$|Parallel <b>computers</b> <b>can</b> {{be roughly}} {{classified}} {{according to the}} level at which the hardware supports parallelism. This classification is broadly analogous to the distance between basic computing nodes. These are not mutually exclusive; for example, clusters of symmetric multiprocessors are relatively common.|$|E
5|$|Parallel <b>computers</b> <b>can</b> {{be roughly}} {{classified}} {{according to the}} level at which the hardware supports parallelism, with multi-core and multi-processor computers having multiple processing elements within a single machine, while clusters, MPPs, and grids use multiple computers to work on the same task. Specialized parallel computer architectures are sometimes used alongside traditional processors, for accelerating specific tasks.|$|E
5|$|Another {{brute force}} {{approach}} is to match up the frequency distribution of the letters. By graphing the frequencies of letters in the ciphertext, and by knowing the expected distribution of those letters in the original language of the plaintext, a human can easily spot {{the value of the}} shift by looking at the displacement of particular features of the graph. This is known as frequency analysis. For example, in the English language the plaintext frequencies of the letters E, T, (usually most frequent), and Q, Z (typically least frequent) are particularly distinctive. <b>Computers</b> <b>can</b> also do this by measuring how well the actual frequency distribution matches up with the expected distribution; for example, the chi-squared statistic can be used.|$|E

25|$|<b>Computers</b> <b>can</b> perform both {{sequential}} control and feedback control, and typically a single computer will do both {{in an industrial}} application. Programmable logic controllers (PLCs) are a type of special purpose microprocessor that replaced many hardware components such as timers and drum sequencers used in relay logic type systems. General purpose process control computers have increasingly replaced stand alone controllers, with a single computer able to perform the operations of hundreds of controllers. Process control <b>computers</b> <b>can</b> process data from a network of PLCs, instruments and controllers in order to implement typical (such as PID) control of many individual variables or, in some cases, to implement complex control algorithms using multiple inputs and mathematical manipulations. They can also analyze data and create real time graphical displays for operators and run reports for operators, engineers and management.|$|E
25|$|As {{with all}} modern {{scientific}} and technological endeavors, computers and software play an increasingly important role. As well as the typical business application software {{there are a number}} of computer aided applications (computer-aided technologies) specifically for engineering. <b>Computers</b> <b>can</b> be used to generate models of fundamental physical processes, which can be solved using numerical methods.|$|E
25|$|Multitasking {{refers to}} the running of {{multiple}} independent computer programs on the same computer; giving the appearance that it is performing the tasks at the same time. Since most <b>computers</b> <b>can</b> do at most one or two things at one time, this is generally done via time-sharing, which means that each program uses {{a share of the}} computer's time to execute.|$|E

50|$|Historically, {{computers}} {{evolved from}} mechanical computers and eventually from vacuum tubes to transistors. However, conceptually computational systems as flexible {{as a personal}} <b>computer</b> <b>can</b> be built out of almost anything. For example, a <b>computer</b> <b>can</b> be made out of billiard balls (billiard ball computer); an often quoted example. More realistically, modern computers are made out of transistors made of photolithographed semiconductors.|$|R
25|$|The {{aviation}} {{travel industry}} {{is affected by}} the severity of fog conditions. Even though modern auto-landing <b>computers</b> <b>can</b> put an aircraft down without the aid of a pilot, personnel manning an airport control tower must be able to see if aircraft are sitting on the runway awaiting takeoff. Safe operations are difficult in thick fog, and civilian airports may forbid takeoffs and landings until conditions improve.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{computer}} programs {{are available to}} help in analyzing qualitative data. The capacity of computers to effectively sort, store and retrieve information makes their use in qualitative data analysis appealing. However, {{it is important to}} notice that <b>computers</b> <b>can</b> only aid in some parts of analysis; computer software do not code data or replace the conceptual processes. It cannot analyse qualitative data for the researcher.|$|E
25|$|Analog {{computers}} were {{widely used in}} scientific and industrial applications where digital computers of the time lacked sufficient performance. Analog <b>computers</b> <b>can</b> have a very wide range of complexity. Slide rules and nomographs are the simplest, while naval gunfire control computers and large hybrid digital/analog {{computers were}} among the most complicated. Systems for process control and protective relays used analog computation to perform control and protective functions.|$|E
50|$|To {{live up to}} its name, a topological quantum {{computer}} must provide the unique computation properties promised by a conventional {{quantum computer}} design, which uses trapped quantum particles. Fortunately in 2002, Michael H. Freedman, Alexei Kitaev, Michael J.

The flash drives present a simple block-structured logical unit to the host operating system, hiding the individual complex implementation details of the various underlying flash memory devices.

25|$|BQP is {{suspected}} to be disjoint from NP-complete and a strict superset of P, {{but that is}} not known. Both integer factorization and discrete log are in BQP. Both of these problems are NP problems suspected to be outside BPP, and hence outside P. Both are suspected to not be NP-complete. There is a common misconception that quantum <b>computers</b> <b>can</b> solve NP-complete problems in polynomial time. That is not known to be true, and is generally suspected to be false.|$|E
25|$|Monitors running screensavers {{consume the}} same amount of power as when running normally, which can be {{anywhere}} from a few watts for small LCD monitors to several hundred for large plasma displays. Most modern <b>computers</b> <b>can</b> be set to switch the monitor into a lower power mode, blanking the screen altogether. A power-saving mode for monitors is usually part of the power management options supported in most modern operating systems, though it must also be supported by the computer hardware and monitor itself.|$|E

25|$|Reeves and Nass ran {{the test}} again but added a voice speaker to both {{computers}} that would verbally communicate {{information to make}} the human-social theme more explicit. The test resulted in {{almost exactly the same}} results. They concluded that people are polite to computers in both verbal and textual scenarios. The respondents did not need much of a cue to respond socially to the computers. The experiment proves that social rules can apply to media and <b>computers</b> <b>can</b> be social initiators. Participants denied being intentionally polite to the computer, but the results suggest differently.|$|E
25|$|Reviewers {{appreciated}} Kurzweil's {{track record}} with predictions, {{his ability to}} extrapolate technology trends, and his clear explanations. However, there was disagreement on whether computers {{will one day be}} conscious. Philosophers John Searle and Colin McGinn insist that computation alone cannot possibly create a conscious machine. Searle deploys a variant of his well-known Chinese room argument, this time tailored to computers playing chess, a topic Kurzweil covers. Searle writes that <b>computers</b> <b>can</b> only manipulate symbols which are meaningless to them, an assertion which if true subverts much of the vision of the book.|$|E
25|$|A dock {{can allow}} some laptop {{computers}} {{to become a}} substitute for a desktop computer, without sacrificing the mobile computing functionality of the machine.

In a cold dock or undock, one completely shuts the computer down before docking/undocking. In a hot dock or undock, the computer remains running when docked/undocked. Standby docking or undocking, an intermediate style used in some designs, allows the computer to be docked/undocked while powered on, but requires that it be placed into a sleep mode prior to docking/undocking.|$|E
