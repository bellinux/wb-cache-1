50|$|Magnesian {{limestone}} grassland supports an {{assemblage of}} <b>calcicolous</b> <b>plants</b> adapted to growing in thin soils with a short sward. The quarry holds {{one of the largest}} British populations of the dark red helleborine, Epipactis atrorubens; a survey in 2010 found nearly 1700 flowering spikes of this nationally rare species.|$|E
50|$|Carsten Erik Olsen (March 1, 1891 - August 19, 1974) was a Danish plant {{ecologist}} {{and plant}} physiologist, who pioneered {{the study of}} plant nutrition in soils of different pH. He was born in Copenhagen and began studies of botany at the University of Copenhagen in 1910, at first with professor Eugenius Warming, then with professor Christen Raunkiær. His doctoral dissertation (1921) was {{on the influence of}} soil pH on the natural distribution of plants. He was then employed by the Carlsberg Laboratory as an assistant to the chemist S. P. L. Sørensen, later in his own lab. There, he worked on plant uptake of ions, especially iron, nitrogen fixation and <b>calcicolous</b> <b>plants.</b>|$|E
50|$|Some {{industrial}} waste products, such as spoil from mining, or alkaloids from other industrial processes were disposed of locally. Caustic waste from the Leblanc process was dumped {{on at least}} two sites - Nob End, to the south of Bolton and Lower Hinds in Bury. The waste on both sites has since weathered-down to calcium carbonate and has provided an ideal environment for a number of nationally rare <b>calcicolous</b> <b>plants,</b> unique in what is predominately an area of acidic soil. These plants, along with non-indigenous garden escapees such as Giant Hogweed and Himalayan Balsam, have added much variety to the flora of the valley. Nob End was designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest in 1988 and a Local Nature Reserve in 2000.|$|E
40|$|Calcicolous populations display colonizer {{characteristics}} {{by producing}} more numerous small seeds than the silicicolous populations. <b>Calcicolous</b> <b>plants</b> are better competitors at the seedling {{as well as}} at adult stages. The silicicolous populations appear to be stress tolerant strategists. Allelopathic interactions were observed between populations and between individuals within populations. -from AuthorsSCOPUS: NotDefined. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
