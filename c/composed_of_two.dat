5|$|A {{study in}} 1993 by Segawa et al. {{revealed}} that the population of S.lessoniana in Okinawa may actually be composed of three distinct species. This was confirmed in genetic studies by Izuka et al. in 1994. Triantafillos and Adams in 2005 also showed that S.lessoniana in Shark Bay, Australia is <b>composed</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> species. These findings indicate that S.lessoniana may actually comprise several very similar and closely related species. It is now believed that S.lessoniana is a cryptic species complex.|$|E
