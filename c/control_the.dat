5|$|A {{more recent}} {{development}} is the electric action which uses low voltage DC to <b>control</b> <b>the</b> key and/or stop mechanisms. Electricity may <b>control</b> <b>the</b> action indirectly through air pressure valves (pneumatics), {{in which case the}} action is electro-pneumatic. In such actions, an electromagnet attracts a small pilot valve which lets wind go to a bellows ("pneumatic") which opens the pallet. When electricity operates the action directly without the assistance of pneumatics, it is commonly referred to as direct electric action. In this type, the electromagnet's armature carries a disc pallet.|$|E

5|$|Although {{a primary}} {{concern of the}} Sprint missile was high speed, the design was not {{optimized}} for maximum energy, but instead relied on the first stage (booster) to provide as much thrust as possible.

The sustainer was not necessarily ignited immediately, depending on the flight profile. For <b>control,</b> <b>the</b> first stage used a system that injected Freon into the exhaust to cause thrust vectoring to <b>control</b> <b>the</b> flight. The second stage used small air vanes for control.|$|E
