500|$|When Maunsell {{inherited}} the design as CME of the Southern Railway, he began trials using the weakest N15 (No.442) in 1924. The {{results indicated that}} better performance could be obtained by altering the steam <b>circuit,</b> <b>valve</b> travel and draughting arrangements, although the first two recommendations were deemed too costly for immediate implementation by the Locomotive Committee. Eight extra King Arthur-type boilers were ordered from North British and fitted to N15s Nos.737742 by December 1925 {{in an effort to}} improve steaming. The remaining Urie boilers were fitted with standard Ross pop safety valves to ease maintenance. Maunsell also addressed draughting problems caused by the narrow Urie [...] "stovepipe" [...] chimney.

500|$|Following The International 2017, Valve {{replaced}} the Major Championship structure with one {{that relies on}} more frequently held tournament events produced by third-party organizations, known as the Dota Pro Circuit. From then on, any tournament that {{has at least one}} team from the North American, South American, Southeast Asian, Chinese, European, and Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) regions, a minimum prize pool of $500,000, which Valve adds $500,000 of their own towards, and concludes with a LAN finals is classified as a Major. In addition, a [...] "Minor" [...] championship tier exists and follows the same rules, but with a minimum prize pool of $150,000 instead. For the <b>Circuit,</b> <b>Valve</b> awards [...] "Qualifying Points" [...] for individual players on a team that finishes in the top four of a tournament, which are publicly listed on a leaderboard and award invitations to The International for the eighth best ranking teams, a practice that was previously done manually by Valve and criticized for being non-transparent and unpredictable. Teams' scores are determined by the total score of the top three point-earning players on them, with points being carried over if a player changes teams during the season. Qualifying points are weighed more heavily towards Majors than Minors, with events that take place closer to The International generally awarding more. To avoid conflicting dates, Valve directly manages the scheduling of the entire circuit.|$|E

50|$|A bailout valve {{is an open}} <b>circuit</b> demand <b>valve</b> {{fitted to}} the {{mouthpiece}} of a rebreather with a manually operated mechanism to switch from closed circuit to open circuit. The position selecting the open <b>circuit</b> demand <b>valve</b> may substitute for the closed state of a dive-surface valve (DSV) as the breathing loop is effectively sealed when on bailout. A bailout valve allows the diver to switch from closed circuit to open circuit without the need to change mouthpieces. This can save time in an emergency, as the bailout demand valve is in place for immediate use. Gas supply to the BOV is often from the on-board diluent cylinder, but arrangements {{can be made for}} off-board gas to be plumbed in using quick connectors.|$|R

40|$|Digital {{hydraulics}} is a {{key part}} of the continuing applicability of fluid power in the modern world. In order to realize the potential of digital hydraulic <b>circuits,</b> <b>valves</b> which are able to switch at high frequencies whilst retaining high flows are first required. This paper details the development of a valve which is capable of switching in 0. 5 ms whilst providing a flow rate of over 50 L/min at a 10 bar pressure drop. Unlike most of the other valves currently in development, position control is used as opposed to the more common bang-bang actuation. This has obvious benefits for valve robustness and offers the possibility of a hybrid control approach which utilizes both throttling and switching control. This paper will detail the design and empirical testing of the valve and benchmark it against published and commercial valves before proceeding to discuss the challenges present in developing the valve further...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. For the {{limitations}} of the existing hydraulic test bench for experimenting with multi-species of hydraulic components, the additional cartridge <b>valve</b> <b>circuit</b> and multi-way directional <b>valve</b> <b>circuit</b> were designed. The AMESim simulation models of the hydraulic test bench’s basic hydraulic circuits were established and simulated. Then the simulation results were compared with the experimental data to get some principles of simulation modeling and optimize the models. These principles were used to simulate the additional hydraulic circuits. Through analysis of the simulation results, theory supports were provided to the optimal design of hydraulic test bench. In this way, the existing hydraulic test bench can be fully used and the suitable components were selected, reducing the waste of resources. Besides, the simulation models can be used as part of the virtual hydraulic teaching...|$|R
