50|$|The {{depth of}} the sockets varies between {{countries}} and age.

40|$|Objectives: Mean and visit-to-visit {{variability}} (VVV) {{of blood}} pressure (BP) {{are associated with}} an increased cardiovascular disease risk. We examined the effect of hormone therapy on mean and VVV of BP in postmenopausal women from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) randomized controlled trials. Methods: BP was measured at baseline and annually in the two WHI hormone therapy trials, in which 10   739 and 16   608 postmenopausal women were randomized to conjugated equine estrogens (<b>CEEs,</b> 0. 625  mg/day) or placebo, and <b>CEEs</b> and medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA, 2. 5  mg/day) or placebo, respectively. Results: At the first annual visit (year 1), mean SBP was 1. 04  mmHg [95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 58, 1. 50] and 1. 35  mmHg (95 % CI 0. 99, 1. 72) higher in the <b>CEEs</b> and <b>CEEs</b> and MPA arms, respectively, compared with the corresponding placebos. These effects remained stable after year 1. <b>CEEs</b> also increased the VVV of SBP (ratio of VVV in <b>CEEs</b> vs. placebo, 1. 03; P <  0. 001), whereas <b>CEEs</b> and MPA did not (ratio of VVV in <b>CEEs</b> and MPA vs. placebo, 1. 01; P =  0. 20). After accounting for study drug adherence, the effects of <b>CEEs</b> and <b>CEEs</b> and MPA on mean SBP increased at year 1, and the differences in the <b>CEEs</b> and <b>CEEs</b> and MPA arms vs. placebos also continued to increase after year 1. Further, both <b>CEEs</b> and <b>CEEs</b> and MPA significantly increased the VVV of SBP (ratio of VVV in <b>CEEs</b> vs. placebo, 1. 04; P <  0. 001; ratio of VVV in <b>CEEs</b> and MPA vs. placebo, 1. 05; P <  0. 001). Conclusion: Among postmenopausal women, <b>CEEs</b> and <b>CEEs</b> and MPA at conventional doses increased mean and VVV of SBP...|$|R

50|$|This is a round plug which {{conforms}} to a shape compatible with <b>CEE</b> 7/1, <b>CEE</b> 7/3, and <b>CEE</b> 7/5 sockets. It has two round pins measuring 4.8 by 19 mm. It may be rated at either 10 A or 16 A, {{and may be}} used for unearthed Class II appliances (and in South Korea for all domestic non-earthed appliances). It is also defined as the Class II plug in Italian standard CEI 23-50. It can be inserted into Israeli SI 32 with some difficulty. The Soviet GOST 7396 standard includes both the <b>CEE</b> 7/17 and the <b>CEE</b> 7/16 variant II plug.|$|R
25|$|This Soviet plug, still {{widely used}} in modern Russia, has pin {{dimensions}} and spacing equal to the Europlug, but lacks the insulation sleeves. Unlike the Europlug, it is rated 6A. It has a round body like the French <b>CEE</b> 7/6 or flat body with a round base like <b>CEE</b> 7/17. The round base has no notches. The pins are parallel and do not converge. The body is made of fire resistant thermoset plastic. The corresponding 6A socket accepts the Europlug, but not others as the 4.5mm holes {{are too small to}} accept the 4.8mm pins of <b>CEE</b> 7/4, <b>CEE</b> 7/6 or <b>CEE</b> 7/7 plugs.|$|R

40|$|The Carrot-ABI 3 gene (C-ABI 3 : a {{homologue}} of Arabidopsis ABI 3) is an embryo-specific transcriptional {{factor that}} regulates ABA inducible gene expression during somatic and zygotic embryogenesis. Although {{the function of}} C-ABI 3 is related to late stage of embryogensis, the expression is observed from very early stage of zygotic and somatic embryogenesis. In this thesis, carrot somatic embryogenesis system was {{used to analyze the}} regulatory system of C-ABI 3 gene expression at early stage of embryogenesis. C-ABI 3 promoter region was isolated and a series of seletions of the promoter was made and fused to a GUS reporter gene. The GUS reporter gene constructs were introduced to carrot and Arabidopsis, and the transgenic tissues were analyzed by GUS staining. By the GUS expression analysis, it was determed that a 40 bp sequence of the promoter is important for the expression in emvryos and embryogenic cells. By electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) with nuclear proteins prepared from embryogenic cell extract, a novel cis-acting element [GTCGGTGCTT] was indentified in the 40 bp sequence and named Carrot Embryonic Element 1 (<b>CEE</b> 1). <b>CEE</b> 1 regulate embryo-specific gene expression in carrot somatic embryogenesis and Arabidipsis zygoticembryogenesis. Furthermore, seven trans-acting factors (<b>CEE</b> 1 BF-A, <b>CEE</b> 1 BF-B, <b>CEE</b> 1 BF-C, <b>CEE</b> 1 BF-E, <b>CEE</b> 1 BF-F, <b>CEE</b> 1 BF-G, and <b>CEE</b> 1 BF-H) that interact with <b>CEE</b> 1 sequence were isolated from carrot embryogenic cell cDNA libraries by using yeast one-hybrid system. All of the <b>CEE</b> 1 BF genes encoded the transcriptional factors which contain an EREBP/AP 2 DNA binding domain. By Northerm blotting, the expression patterns of these seven genes were analyzed. Expression of all of them was observed during zygotic and somatic embryogenesis. However, the expression of <b>CEE</b> 1 BF-E, <b>CEE</b> 1 BF-G, and <b>CEE</b> 1 BF-H was also observed in vegetative tissues. The expression of <b>CEE</b> 1 BF-E, <b>CEE</b> 1 BF-F, and <b>CEE</b> 1 BF-G was induced by the treatment with some kind of stresses. Only <b>CEE</b> 1 BF-C gene expression was embryo-specific as same as that of C-ABI 3 which is a main target gene of trans-acting factors analyzed in this study. Moreover, <b>CEE</b> 1 BF-C, was a major gene isolated by yeast one-hybrid system. Then, GST-fusion protein of <b>CEE</b> 1 BF-C was prosuced in E. coli and used for EMSA with <b>CEE</b> 1. By the EMSA, the interaction of the <b>CEE</b> 1 BF-C protein with <b>CEE</b> 1 region was evidenced and the EMSA data indicated that <b>CEE</b> 1 BF-C protein should make dimer and bind to <b>CEE</b> 1. Furthermore, I analyzed the function of the <b>CEE</b> 1 BF-C protein using transgenic carrot tissues. A lot of secondary embryos were often formed on <b>CEE</b> 1 BF-C cDNA over-expressed transgenic carrot somatic embryos. This indicatesthat the <b>CEE</b> 1 BF-C protein functions as trans-acting factors related plant embryogenesis and should regulate expression of some genes concerning to embryogenesis in morphological and physiological aspects.
