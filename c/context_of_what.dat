5|$|When debates {{polarise}} between techniques, {{the methods}} are {{often referred to}} by a colour code, based on the colours of the bindings of the two volumes from the first Oxford Conference, where the approaches were first distinguished. Green (Old World) archaeoastronomers rely heavily on statistics and are sometimes accused of missing the cultural <b>context</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> is a social practice. Brown (New World) archaeoastronomers in contrast have abundant ethnographic and historical evidence and {{have been described as}} 'cavalier' on matters of measurement and statistical analysis. Finding a way to integrate various approaches has been a subject of much discussion since the early 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Einstein's {{equations}} are nonlinear partial {{differential equations}} and, as such, difficult to solve exactly. Nevertheless, {{a number of}} exact solutions are known, although only a few have direct physical applications. The best-known exact solutions, and also those most interesting from a physics point of view, are the Schwarzschild solution, the Reissner–Nordström solution and the Kerr metric, each corresponding to {{a certain type of}} black hole in an otherwise empty universe, and the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker and de Sitter universes, each describing an expanding cosmos. Exact solutions of great theoretical interest include the Gödel universe (which opens up the intriguing possibility of time travel in curved spacetimes), the Taub-NUT solution (a model universe that is homogeneous, but anisotropic), and anti-de Sitter space (which has recently come to prominence in the <b>context</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> is called the Maldacena conjecture).|$|E
5|$|Twice Through the Heart {{is based}} on a 1992 poetry {{documentary}} of the same name that Kay had written for the BBC television series Words on Film. Kay was concerned by inequalities in how the legal system treats men and women who kill their spouses and, in particular, in how the law on provocation in the United Kingdom was then interpreted, allowing a defence to murder only in the <b>context</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> happened immediately before a homicide and excluding the battered woman defence which considers the broader context which may have involved years of violent abuse. She chose to base the poems on a specific true case, that of Amelia Rossiter, a woman in her sixties who refused to give evidence in court about the years of violence from her husband that eventually led to her stabbing him twice through the heart with a kitchen knife. By the time Kay's programme was broadcast, Rossiter had been freed, her conviction reduced to manslaughter after her plea of provocation was accepted.|$|E

25|$|Comparative {{psychology}} also studies animal behaviour, but, {{as opposed}} to ethology, is construed as a sub-topic of psychology rather than as one of biology. Historically, where comparative psychology has included research on animal behaviour in the <b>context</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> is known about human psychology, ethology involves research on animal behaviour in the <b>context</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> is known about animal anatomy, physiology, neurobiology, and phylogenetic history. Furthermore, early comparative psychologists concentrated {{on the study of}} learning and tended to research behaviour in artificial situations, whereas early ethologists concentrated on behaviour in natural situations, tending to describe it as instinctive.|$|E

25|$|Ethnographers {{concerned}} with the validity of activists' impressions studied a federal anti-trafficking task force {{in a city that}} had been identified as a hub for domestic minor sex trafficking. In comparing local sex markets with the understandings of local social service providers, law enforcement officials, and anti-trafficking activists participating in the task force they found that many of the claims of widespread trafficking activity were either exaggerations or misinterpretations of anecdotal evidence; thus calling into question activists' ability to understand the <b>context</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> they were seeing.|$|E
25|$|This {{means that}} if a formula is {{deducible}} from the laws of intuitionistic logic, being derived from its axioms {{by way of the}} rule of modus ponens, then it will always have the value 1 in all Heyting algebras under any assignment of values to the formula's variables. However one can construct a Heyting algebra in which the value of Peirce's law is not always 1. Consider the 3-element algebra {0,½,1} as given above. If we assign ½ to P and 0 to Q, then the value of Peirce's law ((P→Q)→P)→P is ½. It follows that Peirce's law cannot be intuitionistically derived. See CurryHoward isomorphism for the general <b>context</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> this implies in type theory.|$|E

40|$|Background: In the {{contemporary}} culture we observed {{a kind of}} apology for the hybridization of cognitive activity. Nevertheless, we don’t know is it a real phenomenon or only a facade. To shed some new light on this issue, we investigated two qualitative studies on the hybridization of spontaneous cognitive activity. Methods: Three martial arts masters and four triathletes took part in these studies. A structured interview was used to collect data. Results: We found that professional and experienced athletes do not recognize a big potential for hybridization. They can’t imagine a strong hybridization of own, and their students, spontaneous cognitive activity, both in the current and the future technological reality.

He suggests that a person will redefine the object of judgment based on the content of the evaluations. Therefore, the person will base the meaning of the quote in the <b>context</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> he/she believes to be true about the person who said the quote, resulting in different meanings of the statements based on the author.|$|E

In the announcement of the ended relationship, Paul said, [...] "But the message I have always tried to deliver over the years has always been the same, and that is spreading the message of liberty. Right now I am very much engaged in doing that through the internet. But, I believe we can do better. Right now, the program has changed to the Ron Paul Liberty Report, {{and that is what we}} do, we report on liberty in <b>context</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> is going on in daily activity and what is going on in the news."
