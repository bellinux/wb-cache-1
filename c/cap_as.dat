5|$|Amanita onusta may be {{confused}} with A.cinereoconia because of the similar gray powdery veil remnants on the cap surface. A.cinereoconia is distinguished from A.onusta {{by the absence of}} clamps, its powdery-wooly to powdery-warty <b>cap,</b> <b>as</b> well as the absence of warts or scales {{at the base of the}} stipe. A.cinereoconia also smells distinctly of chloride of lime. Another similar species is A.costaricensis, found only in Costa Rica. A.atkinsoniana, another North American species, has shorter warts that are spaced further apart than those of A.onusta, and the warts on the basal bulb are arranged in parallel rows.|$|E
5|$|New manager Fabio Capello named Carson in {{his first}} England squad for the {{friendly}} match against Switzerland in February 2008, but the goalkeeper {{did not make the}} final squad for the match against France the following month due to injury. After failing to make Capello's squads for the next five internationals, Carson was recalled to the England squad in October 2008 for the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifiers against Kazakhstan and Belarus. He won his third England cap in November 2008, in a friendly against Germany in Berlin when he came on for the second half. In doing so he became the first West Bromwich Albion player to play for England for 24 years. He won his fourth <b>cap</b> <b>as</b> a second-half substitute against Sweden on 15 November 2011.|$|E

5|$|Fruit body {{primordia}} first appear {{between the}} scales of the cones, and require 9 to 35 days to reach their final height. They consist of an inner core of thin-walled generative hyphae enclosed by an outer coat of skeletal hyphae. Immature fruit bodies are white and delicate, but gradually become brown as they mature. Because the cap is grown from the stem tip after it bends, cap development interrupts stem growth, and this shift to centrifugal growth (that is, growth outward from the stem) results in the typical kidney-shaped or semicircular cap. Although the fruit body takes at least 9 days to mature, spores production begins within 48–72 hours of the start of cap growth. Spines start out as minute protuberances {{on the part of}} the stem adjoining the undersurface of the <b>cap.</b> <b>As</b> the cap enlarges, these spines are spread horizontally, and more protuberances are formed, which elongate vertically downwards.|$|E
5|$|When {{viewed in}} mass, such {{as with a}} spore print, the spores appear to be white. Viewed with a light microscope, the basidiospores are 8–10.5 by 4.5–5.5µm, , smooth, and {{yellowish}} in Melzer's reagent. The spore-bearing cells, the basidia, are four-spored and measure 48–65 long by 6–8µm thick. Pleurocystidia and cheilocystidia (specialized cystidia found on the gill faces and edges, respectively) are absent in this species. The pileipellis (cap cuticle) is made of a broad (175–350µm) gelatinous zone, composed of loosely interwoven, slender (1.5–4µm) hyphae; the surface hyphae are a —a dark brownish-gray color. This hyphal arrangement is called an , in which the hyphal walls swell up and gelatinize, giving a translucence to the layer that stands out {{in contrast to the}} underlying flesh. The layer of gelatizined hyphae is tenacious, and may be peeled off the <b>cap</b> <b>as</b> a film. Although clamp connections are found on the hyphae that make up the flesh of the gill, none are found in the cap flesh nor in the pileipellis.|$|E

25|$|MG Walt formalized {{the program}} in February 1967, {{appointing}} LtCol William R. Corson as the III MAF deputy director for Combined Action.

Corson saw <b>CAP</b> <b>as</b> being mobile and offensive in nature, a concept which later took shape in the mobile CAP units.

25|$|Typically, the ACU is {{worn with}} the Advanced Combat Helmet, a patrol cap, or a boonie hat and/or fleece <b>cap</b> <b>as</b> {{appropriate}} in winter months.
