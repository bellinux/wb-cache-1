40|$|Bay (border <b>check)</b> <b>irrigation</b> {{systems are}} {{utilised}} extensively throughout the Goulburn Murray Irrigation District (GMID). However, {{the performance of}} these systems have rarely been assessed, {{in part due to}} the difficulty in determining the soil intake function. The CRC for Irrigation Futures has recently completed a project to demonstrate the Irrimate™ performance evaluation process in bay irrigation through on-farm trials. The Irrimate™ approach originally developed for furrow irrigation has already provided real benefits to farmers and has been accepted across the cotton industry. Bay irrigation has a number of unique characteristics which presented a number of challenges for the tools used to evaluate furrow irrigation. Informed by field trials, new monitoring strategies were tested and new modelling approaches developed in order to provide the same robust evaluation procedure for bay systems. Evaluations provide objective information to irrigators both quantifying efficiencies of current practices and providing strategies to improve performance. Trials were conducted across 11 sites in order to benchmark current performance and to examine the potential advantages of higher flow rates. Performance varied widely between sites with application efficiencies ranging from 45. 9...|$|E

50|$|Border strip, {{otherwise}} known as border <b>check</b> or bay <b>irrigation</b> could {{be considered as a}} hybrid of level basin and furrow irrigation. The field is divided into a number of bays or strips, each bay is separated by raised earth check banks (borders). The bays are typically longer and narrower compared to basin irrigation and are orientated to align lengthwise with the slope of the field. Typical bay dimensions are between 10-70m wide and 100-700m long. The water is applied to the top end of the bay, which is usually constructed to facilitate free-flowing conditions at the downstream end. One common use of this technique includes the irrigation of pasture for dairy production.|$|R
40|$|Within {{the western}} United States, water rights are granted for {{reasonable}} and beneficial water use, and {{a measure of}} irrigation performance that embodies this standard is needed. A new performance parameter, irrigation sagacity (IS), is recommended for this purpose. The term `sagacity 2 ̆ 7 comes from `sagacious 2 ̆ 7, meaning wise or prudent. IS is more {{closely tied to the}} water rights granted, and to the potential for water conservation and reallocation than is the traditional irrigation efficiency, which considers only beneficial uses. Sagacious uses are either beneficial, or non-beneficial but reasonable. Reasonable uses are those that, while not directly benefiting agronomic production within the boundaries of the water rights area, are nonetheless justified under prevailing conditions. Non-sagacious uses (non-beneficial and unreasonable) are those uses which are without economic, practical, or other justification. Determination of sagacity involves <b>checking</b> alternate <b>irrigation</b> practices for practical, technical, economic, and environmental feasibility. Feasibility includes the requirement for a reasonable implementation schedule for any new practices.

This research therefore explored {{the possibility of}} growing roselle (Hibiscus sabdarriffa. L) under irrigation. The experimental treatments comprised five irrigation schedules with irrigation intervals (f) of 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 days. The corresponding gross water requirements (GWR) were 37, 56, 74, 93, and 112 mm. The crops were grown under <b>check</b> basin <b>irrigation</b> during the 2001 / 2002 and 2002 / 2003 irrigation seasons in Bauchi state, Nigeria. Results showed that difference in number of leaves per plant was significant (p = 0. 05) with the fifth irrigation schedule (f = 11 days, GWR = 112 mm) giving the highest value of 347 leaves per plant, while the first irrigation schedule (f = 3 days, GWR = 37 mm) resulted in only 192 leaves per plant. Variations in plant height, number of branches per plant and canopy diameter were insignificant (p = 0. 05). The influence of irrigation schedule on the yield of roselle measured with respect to fresh calyx weight was highly significant with a strong coefficient of determination of 97. 1 %.

40|$|Koshihikari and Hinohikari sown {{at three}} {{different}} times were grown under running and stagnant irrigation {{and in two}} water depth systems. The number of days required for transplanting to heading (DTH) was shortened as the date of sowing was put back. Rises in water temperature during the daytime were strictly <b>checked</b> under running <b>irrigation</b> and at 22 cm depth, though the water temperature during nights was not different from surface to 22 cm depth. Running irrigation extends DTH, while stagnant irrigation remarkably reduced DTH under high temperatures. A high water temperature induced by stagnant irrigation and deep flood irrigation accelerated elongation growth, and low temperature due to running irrigation reduced the rate of leaf emergence and final leaf number on the main stem. The effects of running and stagnant irrigation on dry matter production depended on the temperature environment during growing period, and running irrigation under high temperature and stagnant irrigation under low temperature acted positively on dry matter production. From those results, {{it was concluded that}} it is possible to control the growth and development of rice by changing irrigation type. ...|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was designed to}} evaluate the effects of organic matter, foliar fertilization application, two systems of irrigation and the interactions of treatments on the growth and seed yield of three soybean varieties. ^ The {{experiment was}} conducted for two consecutive years (1977, 1978) at the University of Nebraska Field Laboratory at Mead, Nebraska. ^ The interactions of organic matter applications with irrigation and foliar fertilization increased yield. Apparently, the addition of organic matter to the soil improved the soil-water-root relationships which in turn increased seed yields. ^ Irrigation increased yields 0. 22 tons/ha over the non-irrigated check regardless of system used. ^ The early (Amsoy 71) and full-season (Woodworth) varieties produced higher yields than the later maturity variety (Cutler 71). ^ Foliar fertilization at one-half the suggested rate increased yields 0. 11 tons/ha. However, the full fertilization rate caused excessive vegetative growth and subsequent lodging, so that yields were essentially equal to the non-fertilized <b>check.</b> ^ <b>Irrigation</b> increased crude protein of the soybeans produced regardless of the method of application. As the rate of foliar fertilization increased, the level of seed protein increased, showing that foliar N and P were absorbed by the leaves and translocated into the seed. ^ Only varieties showed differences in dry matter accumulation at all growth stages studied. However, {{each of the three}} varieties was highest in dry matter accumulation during at least one growth stage. ^ Nitrogen content of the vegetative growth increased as the rate of fertilization increased. The nitrogen foliar applied was absorbed by the leaves and translocated to the other vegetative plant parts. There were varietal differences in N content. No relationship between N content and dry matter accumulation, N content and yield or dry matter accumulation and yield were observed. ...|$|R

40|$|To {{save energy}} and money, Nebraska irrigators should <b>check</b> their <b>irrigation</b> pumps for maximum efficiency, a University of Nebraska-Lincoln Extension {{educator}} said.

Statewide UNL pumping plant efficiency studies conducted on hundreds of farmer-owned pumping plants for the last 50 years were developed into the Nebraska Pumping Plant Performance Criteria. These criteria state the amount of useful work to expect for each unit of energy consumed by an irrigation pump. Results varied considerably about 15 percent achieved good efficiency, leaving the other 85 percent using more energy per unit of work than expected by the criteria. The tests revealed the overall average pumping plant in Nebraska is producing only 77 percent of the work that it should be for the fuel it is using, Dorn said. If repairs are made to bring a typical diesel powered pumping plant operating at 77 percent of the performance criteria up to 100 percent of the criteria, it would result in an annual savings of nearly 800 gallons of diesel per year, Dorn said. 2 ̆ 2 That 2 ̆ 7 s why it 2 ̆ 7 s important for farmers to know how much work is being done to pump the water versus the energy consumed, 2 ̆ 2 he said...|$|R

The experiment was {{laid out in a}} split plot within a Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) with four replications. The main plots consisted of three planting depths (10, 15 and 20 cm) and three different methods for summer temperature control (<b>check,</b> mulching and <b>irrigation)</b> were arranged in subplots. The results revealed that by increasing the planting depth, corm propagation, contractile roots number, flowering time, leafing time and leaf number were decreased significantly, but leaf length and stigma were increased. Flowers number and corm weight were increased significantly by increasing planting depths from 10 - 15 cm, but both of them were decreased in 20 cm depth. In response to summer temperatures control treatments, flowering, leafing, leaf and stigma lengths were increased but corm propagation decreased significantly, due to decreasing temperature treatments. Leaves and contractile roots number were not affected by summer treatments. In response to temperature control and planting depth interaction, the most corm propagation and leaf number ware obtained at 10 cm planting depth and control treatments, also minimum corm propagation and leave number was obtained at 20 cm planting depth with mulching treatments.

40|$|The Border <b>Check</b> {{method of}} <b>irrigation,</b> {{widely used in}} Australia and {{overseas}} for the irrigation of pasture crops, may {{be described as a}} method of applying water to land between parallel ridges or checkbanks. Under ideal conditions the land should have no cross slope between the banks, but there is usually a slope in the direction of irrigation. Water is admitted {{at the head of the}} strip or irrigation bay, and the flow is diverted when, in the operator's estimation, the ponded water will carry to the end of the strip without wastage. With experience it is possible to judge the cut-off point with considerable accuracy. Depending upon soil type and the natural slope of the ground, bays may be up to 1, 200 feet long; and 70 feet wide, with average dimensions of 600 feet by 30 feet. It is the purpose of this thesis to examine some of the factors influencing the movement of water down a border strip, and the infiltration of this water into the soil. It is hoped that such studies will lead ultimately to a more critical assessment of border check layout in relation to soil type, topography, etc., and that it may be possible to determine accurately the dimensions needed for efficient use of irrigation water in a particular case. That efficient irrigation is necessary is brought out by the fact that one inch of excess water passing down to the water table may raise it by as much as one foot (49). The major factors influencing the movement of water down a border strip are as follows :- (1) The infiltration characteristics of the soil. (2) The flow per unit width of border strip. (>) The slope of the land in the direction of flow. (4) The resistance of the plant cover to water movement. Minor factors involved include the soil and water temperatures, the salt content of the irrigation water, the head of water during irrigation, the turbidity of the water, the nature of the soil colloids, etc. Most of these, however, influence irrigation by their effect on the infiltration at a particular point. In the work reported upon herein an attempt has been made to evaluate the influence upon pasture irrigation of the infiltration characteristics of the soil, and the density of pasture cover.

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of using Regulated Deficit Irrigation in the humid environment of New Zealand was evaluated on trees of apple cv. Royal Gala (Malus domestica Borkh.). The study {{was carried out}} in a glasshouse experiment and a field experiment. In the glasshouse experiment, it was evaluated the pattern of soil water extraction by the winter mutant of lucerne (Medicago sativa sensu lato) ASR 13 R from a 'synthetic' soil layered {{in the same way that}} it occurs in the research orchard, under trickle and sprinkler irrigation. Results indicated that lucerne extracted soil water at a high rate and explored deep areas of soil. The field experiment was conducted during two consecutive seasons (1987 - 1989). Lucerne as under tree cover and black polyethylene mulch were compared with conventional herbicide strip to control excess of water in the root zone of the crop that would otherwise promote vegetative growth. These treatments were applied in combination with an irrigation schedule divided into three Phases. In Phase I, water was withheld, in Phase II RDI was compared with full irrigation, and during Phase III which coincided with the rapid fruit growth, all treatments received the full irrigation rate. During the first season, RDI and full irrigation treatments were based on 25 % and 100 % replacement EPS (evaporation in the planting square) respectively. In the second season, after a 50 % of the soil water content in the top 600 mm of soil, between Drainage Upper Limit and me Lower Limit was reached, full irrigation treatments were replenished to the DUL, while RDI treatments received 25 % of that amount. Results showed that under the conditions of this study evaluation of crop water requirements based on soil moisture measurements was more reliable than those based on pan evaporation. The degree of reduction of summer pruning obtained under lucerne X RDI treatment, reflected levels of soil and plant water deficit similar to those obtained in arid environments. Results confirmed my hypothesis that by using lucerne as under tree cover, a RDI strategy can be used in this environment. In contrast, black plastic mulch appeared to maintain soil moisture rather than prevent its accumulation. Nevertheless, effects were obtained which reflected positively in fruit growth and yield. Similar results were obtained under the control treatment, although it was less effective for in reducing tree vigour. The latter treatment, however, can be implemented in most orchards at no cost and generate important savings. Apple fruit growth proved to be relatively insensitive to water deficit imposed during early stages of growth, whereas vegetative growth was <b>checked.</b> Restoring full <b>irrigation</b> to coincide with rapid fruit growth stimulated growth of RDI fruits resulting in higher yield under control and plastic X RDI. Lucerne showed higher rates of water use that were not compensated by the irrigation which affected fruit growth and size. Results showed that fruits from RDI treatments were firmer, accumulated higher T. S. S. and had lower bruise susceptibility than fruits from fully irrigated treatments. Fruit quality remained higher after 10 weeks of cool storage...|$|R
