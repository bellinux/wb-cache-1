5|$|However, {{the focal}} point of the {{painting}} is widely debated. Leo Steinberg argues that the orthogonals in the work are intentionally disguised so that the picture's focal center shifts. Similar to Lopez-Rey, he describes three foci. The man in the doorway, however, is the vanishing point. More specifically, the <b>crook</b> <b>of</b> his arm is where the orthogonals of the windows and lights of the ceiling meet.|$|E
5|$|The {{first record}} of Auriga's stars was in Mesopotamia as a {{constellation}} called GAM, representing a scimitar or crook. However, {{this may have}} represented just Capella (Alpha Aurigae) or the modern constellation as a whole; this figure was alternatively called Gamlum or MUL.GAM in the MUL.APIN. The <b>crook</b> <b>of</b> Auriga stood for a goat-herd or shepherd. It was formed {{from most of the}} stars of the modern constellation; all of the bright stars were included except for Elnath, traditionally assigned to both Taurus and Auriga. Later, Bedouin astronomers created constellations that were groups of animals, where each star represented one animal. The stars of Auriga comprised a herd of goats, an association also present in Greek mythology. The association with goats carried into the Greek astronomical tradition, though it later became associated with a charioteer along with the shepherd.|$|E
5|$|The only goal of {{the game}} {{followed}} shortly thereafter. Curtis went on a run for Cardiff, who passed it forward near the box to Ferguson. He shot the ball towards the goal, but it had little power and was easily picked up by Lewis. However, as he did so, the ball squirmed out of Lewis' hands and slipped in between the <b>crook</b> <b>of</b> his left elbow and body. With a couple of Cardiff City forwards closing in, Lewis tried to reclaim the ball but only succeeded in knocking it into the net with his elbow. Arsenal sought to attack immediately after the kick off, but despite it looking promising, Brain was caught offside. Cardiff countered, and possibly {{could have had a}} second goal, but Curtis chose to shoot himself rather than pass to Davies, who would have been presented with an open goal had he received the ball as Lewis was out of position. The match ended with a victory for Cardiff City by one goal to nil. The King presented the trophy to Cardiff's captain Keenor, and medals to each of the players from both teams.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} {{maintained}} {{that the right to}} wear mitres was sometimes granted by the popes to abbots before the 11th century, but the documents on which this claim is based are not genuine (J. Braun, Liturgische Gewandung, p.453). The first undoubted instance is the bull by which Alexander II in 1063 granted the use of the mitre to Egelsinus, abbot of the monastery of St Augustine at Canterbury. The mitred abbots in England were those of Abingdon, St Alban's, Bardney, Battle, Bury St Edmunds, St Augustine's Canterbury, Colchester, Croyland, Evesham, Glastonbury, Gloucester, St Benet's Hulme, Hyde, Malmesbury, Peterborough, Ramsey, Reading, Selby, Shrewsbury, Tavistock, Thorney, Westminster, Winchcombe, and St Mary's York. Of these the precedence was yielded to the abbot of Glastonbury, until in AD 1154 Adrian IV (Nicholas Breakspear) granted it to the abbot of St Alban's, in which monastery he had been brought up. Next after the abbot of St Alban's ranked the abbot of Westminster and then Ramsey. Elsewhere, the mitred abbots that sat in the Estates of Scotland were of Arbroath, Cambuskenneth, Coupar Angus, Dunfermline, Holyrood, Iona, Kelso, Kilwinning, Kinloss, Lindores, Paisley, Melrose, Scone, St Andrews Priory and Sweetheart. To distinguish abbots from bishops, it was ordained that their mitre should be made of less costly materials, and should not be ornamented with gold, a rule which was soon entirely disregarded, and that the <b>crook</b> <b>of</b> their pastoral staff (the crosier) should turn inwards instead of outwards, indicating that their jurisdiction was limited to their own house.|$|E

500|$|Capella {{is thought}} to be {{mentioned}} in an Akkadian inscription dating to the 20th century BC. Its symbolism as a goat dates back to Mesopotamia as a constellation called GAM, representing a scimitar or crook. It may have represented the star alone or the modern constellation as a whole; this figure was alternatively called Gamlum or MUL.GAM in the [...] 7th-century BC document MUL.APIN. The <b>crook</b> <b>of</b> Auriga stood for a goat-herd or shepherd. It was formed from most of the stars of the modern constellation; all of the bright stars were included except for Beta Tauri (Elnath), traditionally assigned to both Taurus and Auriga. Later, Bedouin astronomers created constellations that were groups of animals, where each star represented one animal. The stars of Auriga comprised a herd of goats, an association also present in Greek mythology. It is sometimes called the Shepherd's Star in English literature. Capella was seen as a portent of rain in classical times.|$|E
500|$|... "The Long Bright Dark" [...] was {{critically}} acclaimed by most critics. Tim Goodman from The Hollywood Reporter said Fukunaga develops [...] "a beautiful, sprawling sense of place" [...] in the premiere, and identified the ensemble and the writing, which he believed [...] "undulates from effectively brash soliloquies to penetratingly nuanced moments carried by sparse prose", {{as two of}} its other most satisfying attributes. Marshall <b>Crook</b> <b>of</b> The Wall Street Journal agreed, writing the show hits the mark with [...] "good acting, smart writing, and lush cinematography". Willa Paskin of Slate described the episode as [...] "creepy, gorgeous, unsettling, and searching" [...] and noticed [...] "a literary quality, an accretion of meaningful detail" [...] within the show's narrative.

500|$|In [...] "Isn't This a Lovely Day (to be Caught in the Rain)", while Rogers is out riding, a {{thunderstorm}} breaks {{and she takes}} shelter in a bandstand. Astaire follows her and a conversation about clouds and rainfall soon gives way to Astaire's rendering of this, one of Berlin's most prized creations. Astaire sings to Rogers' back, but the audience can see that Rogers' attitude towards him softens during the song, {{and the purpose of}} the ensuing dance is for her to communicate this change to her partner. The dance is one of flirtation and, according to Mueller, deploys two choreographic devices common to the classical minuet: sequential imitation (one dancer performs a step and the other responds) and touching. Initially, the imitation is mocking in character, then becomes more of a casual exchange, and ends in a spirit of true cooperation. Until the last thirty seconds of this two and a half minute dance the pair appear to pull back from touching, then with a <b>crook</b> <b>of</b> her elbow Rogers invites Astaire in. The routine, at once comic and romantic, incorporates hopping steps, tap spins with barrages, loping and dragging steps among its many innovative devices. The spirit of equality which pervades the dance is reflected in the masculinity of Rogers' clothes and in the friendly handshake they exchange at the end.|$|E
