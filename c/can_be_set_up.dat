5|$|The {{combat system}} in Dwarf Fortress is anatomically detailed. Combat is {{displayed}} by viewing the log which describes each weapon striking a specific {{part of the}} character's body. Internal organs can get punctured, combatants can fall to the ground, vomit and lose body parts. Each dwarf has individually detailed limbs, each with damageable bone, fat, muscle and skin. Fat can be bruised without breaking bones and vice versa. Injuries sometimes can be permanent. There is a medical system where a hospital <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> containing crutches for disabled dwarves, traction benches, plasters and cloth for casts and bandages, thread for suturing, and splints.|$|E
5|$|The Family Edition, {{like the}} prior version, {{includes}} parental controls {{and the information}} filtering feature. Parental controls come {{with a list of}} objectionable sites, separated into 32 categories. The list is updated every two weeks by Norton LiveUpdate. Using the list alone, Norton only blocks sites present on the list. Consequently, Norton may not block sites until the next update. Parents can customize the list, adding or removing sites. A list of allowed sites can be created to restrict children to those specific sites. This version uses application blocking rather than protocol or port filtering to control Internet access. Children can be restricted in what applications they used to access the Internet. A parental controls profile <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> for each child, and settings can be automatically configured based on their age group, whether they be a child, teenager, adult, or administrator. Internet usage and violations are noted in a report presented to parents. PC Magazine found that enabling parental controls added a minute to a computer's boot time.|$|E

25|$|Those {{wishing to}} climb Napes Needle should be warned that a safe descent {{is far more}} {{difficult}} than the ascent as there are no permanent anchors or bolts from which to abseil. Down-climbing {{is the only way}} to get from the summit to the shoulder and gear on this second pitch is sparse to say the least. A relatively simple abseil <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> to get down from the shoulder.|$|E
25|$|Place nine queens and one pawn on an 8×8 {{board in}} such a way that queens don't attack each other. Further {{generalization}} of the problem (complete solution is currently unknown): given an n×n chess board and m>n queens, find the minimum number of pawns, so that the m queens and the pawns <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> on the board {{in such a}} way that no two queens attack each other.|$|E
25|$|Whilst the {{geographic}} distribution of Nephila is large, {{there are many}} habitat similarities between these locations. A warm and reasonably wet climate is generally preferred, as {{these are some of}} the environmental cues that induce spiderling hatching. Locally, spiders look for relatively dense vegetation where webs <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> in areas that insects will regularly fly through. Urban environments are also attractive due to the large prey concentrations and lower amounts of predation.|$|E
5000|$|Tags <b>can</b> <b>be</b> used to <b>set</b> <b>up</b> {{variables}} {{in order to}} verify whether certain conditions are met.|$|R
50|$|Selenium-webdriver, {{which is}} mostly used in web-based {{automation}} frameworks, {{is supported by}} Capybara. Unlike Capybara's default driver, it supports JavaScript, can access HTTP resources outside of application and <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> for testing in headless mode which is especially useful for CI scenarios.|$|R
50|$|Many systems {{employ a}} variant with {{third-party}} add-ons to traditional email packages by first attempting {{to obtain an}} encryption key and if unsuccessful, then sending the email in the clear. PGP, p≡p, Hushmail, and Ciphire, among others <b>can</b> all <b>be</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> to work in this mode.|$|R
25|$|Another coping {{mechanism}} is {{taking advantage of}} technological assistance, such as a personal digital device {{to keep track of}} day-to-day tasks. Reminders <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> for appointments, when to take medications, birthdays and other important events. Many pictures can also be stored to help amnesiacs remember names of friends, family and co-workers. Notebooks, wall calendars, pill reminders and photographs of people and places are low-tech memory aids that can help as well.|$|E
25|$|Waterlining is slacklining over water. This is {{an ideal}} way to learn new tricks, or to just have more fun. Common places to set up waterlines are over pools, lakes, rivers, creeks, between pier or {{railroad}} track pillars, and boat docks. The slackline <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> high {{over the surface of}} the water, close to the surface or even underneath the surface. It is important, however, that the water be deep enough, free from obstacles, and that the area should not be travelled by boats.|$|E
25|$|Sleep {{deprivation}} {{experiments on}} animals <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> differently {{than those on}} humans. The “flower pot” method involves placing a laboratory animal above water on a platform so small that it falls off upon losing muscle tone. The naturally rude awakening which results may elicit changes in the organism which necessarily exceed the simple absence of a sleep phase. This method also stops working after about 3 days as the subjects (typically rats) lose their will to avoid the water. Another method involves computer monitoring of brain waves, complete with automatic mechanized shaking of the cage when the test animal drifts into REM sleep.|$|E
50|$|A {{whispering}} gallery {{is usually}} a circular, hemispherical, elliptical or ellipsoidal enclosure, often beneath a dome or a vault, in which whispers <b>can</b> <b>be</b> heard clearly {{in other parts of}} the gallery. Such galleries <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> using two parabolic dishes. Sometimes the phenomenon is detected in caves.|$|R

2500|$|By {{applying}} the virtual work equation (1) to the system, we can establish the element matrices , [...] {{as well as}} the technique of assembling the system matrices [...] and [...] Other matrices such as , , [...] and [...] are known values and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> directly <b>set</b> <b>up</b> from data input.|$|R
25|$|Sanitation is an {{essential}} part of field missions, and it may include education of local medical staff in proper sterilisation techniques, sewage treatment projects, proper waste disposal, and education of the population in personal hygiene. Proper wastewater treatment and water sanitation are the best way to prevent the spread of serious water-borne diseases, such as cholera. Simple wastewater treatment systems <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> by volunteers to protect drinking water from contamination. Garbage disposal could include pits for normal waste and incineration for medical waste. However, the most important subject in sanitation is the education of the local population, so that proper waste and water treatment can continue once MSF has left the area.|$|E
25|$|The {{ergonomic}} {{design of the}} controls such as handles, launcher, barrel shape and optical sight, is predefined standard. All controls are easy to handle in all shooting positions (lying, kneeling or standing). After the weapon is fired, the firing mechanism with the attached optical sight is removed and the barrel thrown away, the firing mechanism is reusable. The effective combat range of Panzerfaust 3 is between 15 and 300 metres against moving and 400 and 600 metres against static targets. An optical sight with line pattern fixed to the reusable firing mechanism enables to engage moving or static targets. To ensure night combat capability, a night-vision device or residual light amplifier <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> {{in front of the}} optical sight.|$|E
25|$|Various {{avionics}} and onboard {{systems are}} integrated on the Lynx {{in order to}} perform differing mission profiles. Several operators have equipped their Lynx with BAE Systems' Sea Spray surveillance radar to provide for a surface search capability, which is used in maritime patrol, search and rescue, and other mission profiles. British Army models are equipped with a Marconi Elliot automatic flight control system capable of performing automatic three axes stabilisation. The integration of both avionics and weapons systems is customized upon each Lynx batch to customer specifications and requirements. Most of the installed sensors and avionics are typically integrated with the aircraft's avionics management system (AMS), from {{where they can be}} managed by either pilot; sensors such the optional nose-mounted FLIR <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> to directly cue the weapon systems. Functions such as navigation and communications are also tied into the AMS, information from these systems are displayed directly to the pilots on interchangeable integrated display units in the cockpit. The Lynx is considerably easier to service and maintain than the AgustaWestland Apache.|$|E
50|$|A {{stackable}} switch is {{a network}} switch that is fully functional operating standalone but which <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> to operate together {{with one or}} more other network switches, with this group of switches showing the characteristics of a single switch but having the port capacity of the sum of the combined switches.|$|R
50|$|Bastion hosts {{are related}} to multi-homed hosts and {{screened}} hosts. While a dual-homed host often contains a firewall it {{is also used to}} host other services as well. A screened host is a dual-homed host that is dedicated to running the firewall. A bastion server <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> using ProxyCommand with OpenSSH.|$|R
2500|$|A defense {{perimeter}} is {{a drawing}} technique {{in which the}} side behind in [...] or otherwise at a disadvantage <b>sets</b> <b>up</b> a perimeter, largely or wholly composed of a pawn chain, that the opponent cannot penetrate. Unlike other forms of fortress, a defense perimeter <b>can</b> often <b>be</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> in the middlegame with several pieces remaining on the board.|$|R
