40|$|ABSTRACT — GaN and its related alloys {{constitute}} {{a family of}} wide bandgap semiconductors suitable to optoelectronics and power microwave applications. For the latter applications, their high breakdown fields in the 3 MV/cm range and their high peak electron velocity above 107 cm/s are crucial. The high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) based on GaN is suitable to high frequencies and power applications. Moreover, those materials show excellent chemical and metallurgical stability. One peculiarity of GaN is stemming {{from the fact that}} the crystal growth is mostly achieved by heteroepitaxy since no commercial GaN substrates are yet available. The substrates currently chosen are sapphire, silicon carbide and silicon. The high power RF device performance decreases as operation temperature increases (e. g. fall of electron mobility impacting the cut-off frequencies and degradation of device reliability) so it is very important to understand the thermal effect in the device. This work present an analytical model of electron transport based on, at one hand, experimental characterisation such as I-V pulsed measurement, thermal characterisation and, at the other hand, thermal simulation and physical analysis. We were able to derive the variation of the electron velocity model as a function of temperature thanks to the thermal characterisation of parameters such electron mobility, ohmic <b>contact,</b> <b>carrier</b> density and gate Schottky barrier.

40|$|The {{possible}} {{origins of}} metal-bilayer graphene (BLG) contact resistance are investigated by {{taking into consideration}} the bandgap formed by interfacial charge transfer at the metal contacts. Our results show that a charge injection barrier (Schottky barrier) does {{not contribute to the}} contact resistance because the BLG under the contacts is always degenerately doped. We also showed that the contact-doping-induced increase in the density of states (DOS) of BLG under the metal contacts decreases the contact resistance owing to enhanced charge carrier tunnelling at the contacts. The contact doping can be enhanced by inserting molecular dopant layers into the metal <b>contacts.</b> However, <b>carrier</b> tunnelling through the insertion layer increases the contact resistance, and thus, alternative device structures should be employed. Finally, we showed that the inter-band transport by variable range hopping via in-gap states is the largest contributor to contact resistance when the carrier type of the gated channel is opposite to the <b>contact</b> doping <b>carrier</b> type. This indicates that the strategy of contact resistance reduction by the contact-doping-induced increase in the DOS is effective only for a single channel transport branch (n- or p-type) depending on the <b>contact</b> doping <b>carrier</b> type.

40|$|We {{examined}} {{the positive and}} negative effects of somatic mutation on antibody function using saturation mutagenesis in vitro to mimic the potential of the in vivo process to diversify antibodies. Identical mutations were introduced into the second complementarity determining region of two anti-phosphocholine antibodies, T 15 and D 16, which share the same germline VH gene sequence. T 15 predominates in primary responses and does not undergo affinity maturation. D 16 is representative of antibodies that co-dominate in memory responses and do undergo affinity maturation. We previously reported that > 50 % of T 15 mutants had decreased antigen binding capacity. To test if this high frequency of binding loss was unique to T 15 or a consequence of random point mutations applicable to other combining sites, we analyzed the same mutations in D 16. We show that D 16 suffers a similar loss of function, indicating an equally high potential for B-cell wastage. However, only D 16 displayed the capacity for somatic mutation to improve antigen binding, which should enhance its persistence in memory responses. Mutation of residues contacting the haptenic group, as determined by molecular modeling, did not improve binding. Instead, productive mutations occurred in residues that either <b>contacted</b> <b>carrier</b> protein or were distant from the antigen binding site, possibly increasing binding site flexibility through long-range effects. Targeting such residues for mutation should aid in the rational design of improved antibodies...|$|R
