40|$|<b>Cherimoya</b> (Annona cherimola Mill.) is {{native to}} the inter-Andean valleys of {{southern}} Ecuador and northern Peru.

50|$|<b>Cherimoya</b> was bred by W. Broderick Cloete and was foaled on 4 May 1908 at his Hare Park estate near London.

Cloete repurchased the horse from Daly for $25,000 in October 1897 and renamed him Cherry Tree. <b>Cherimoya's</b> dam, Svelte, was also bred by Cloete and was not a successful racehorse.

40|$|Cherimoya (Annona cherimola Mill.) is an {{exquisite}} subtropical fruit, intensively cultivated in Spain, but generally underutilized in the inter-Andean valleys where the species shows high botanical diversity. Economic use of Andean <b>cherimoyas</b> currently remains far below potential levels. In 2006 - 2007, a cherimoya value chain {{analysis was performed}} through a market survey in which structured interviews were made with 172 cherimoya producers and 346 cherimoya traders in Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia. Two main flows of cherimoya were observed in all markets studied. The first flow pertains to locally produced cherimoya fruits that have irregular quality due to high infestation levels of fruit flies. These fruits are inadequately packed and transported, and consequently have a low economic value to both producers and traders. The other flow consists of <b>cherimoyas</b> produced in the Huarochir province (Lima Department, Peru), commonly known as 'Cumbe', a collective trademark registered by producers from the Cumbe Valley. This trademark {{which serves as a}} geographical indication currently lacks appropriate legal protection. Consequently, illegal application of the 'Cumbe'-label is widespread. 'Cumbe' fruits are intensively selected and graded on wholesaler markets in the Lima metropolis and distributed in wooden crates to main markets both within Peru and to its neighboring countries Ecuador and Bolivia. Fruit characterization data show that 'Cumbe' fruits are partly distinctive from other Andean <b>cherimoyas.</b> The value of the collective trademark 'Cumbe' should thus be attributed not only to elite germplasm and appropriate cultivation practices, but also to the intensive selection, grading, and packaging process. As a result of higher product quality, 'Cumbe' cherimoya market prices are up to twice or more of the prices for local <b>cherimoyas.</b> More denominations of origin, locally managed by producer organizations, are valuable tools for both conserving on-farm cherimoya diversity and additional income generation for the rural Andean poor...|$|E

40|$|Differences in the {{regulatory}} properties of PEPC extracted from non-photosynthetic (mesocarp) and photosynthetic (peel) tissues from cherimoya fruit have been observed. The enzyme extracted from peel {{had a similar}} apparent Km value (140 ± 6 µM) to mesocarp PEPC (120 ± 8 µM for PEP), but Vmax was 2. 2 times lower (0. 57 ± 0. 01 µkat•mg- 1 protein) than that measured for non-photosynthetic tissues (1. 26 ± 0. 02 µkat•mg- 1 protein). These special kinetic characteristics point to {{a high rate of}} re-assimilation of respired CO 2 into keto-acids in this fruit non-photosynthetic tissues. The kinetic behaviour of PEPC from cherimoya fruit stored in air or treated with high CO 2 levels (20 %) was also studied.

These kinetic values showed the increase in the affinity of this enzyme toward its substrate, PEP, by elevated external CO 2 concentrations.

40|$|<b>Cherimoya</b> (Annona cherimola) is {{an exotic}} fruit with {{attractive}} organoleptic characteristics. However, {{it is highly}} perishable and susceptible to postharvest browning. In fresh fruit, browning is primarily caused by the polyphenol oxidase (PPO) enzyme catalyzing the oxidation of o-diphenols to quinones, which polymerize to form brown melanin pigment. There is no consensus in the literature regarding a specific role of PPO, and its subcellular localization in different plant species is mainly described within plastids. The present work determined the subcellular localization of a PPO protein from <b>cherimoya</b> (AcPPO). The obtained results revealed that the AcPPO- green fluorescent protein co-localized with a Golgi apparatus marker, and AcPPO activity was present in Golgi apparatus-enriched fractions. Likewise, transient expression assays revealed that AcPPO remained active in Golgi apparatus-enriched fractions obtained from tobacco leaves. These results suggest a putative function of AcPPO in the Golgi apparatus of <b>cherimoya,</b> providing new perspectives on PPO functionality in the secretory pathway, its effects on <b>cherimoya</b> physiology, {{and the evolution of}} this enzyme. </p...|$|R

Gene diversity in <b>cherimoya</b> was high, although not equally distributed among countries. Peru and Ecuador, the countries of origin of this species, showed the greatest diversity, and Spain and Madeira (Portugal) showed the least, probably due to genetics bottlenecks resulting from limited introduction. Cultivars from California showed high values for several genetic diversity measures, likely due to their diverse origins.

40|$|Phosphoenolpyruvate {{carboxylase}} (PEPC, EC 4. 1. 1. 31) regulatory properties {{were studied}} in non-photosynthetic (mesocarp) and photosynthetic (peel) tissues from cherimoya (Annona cherimola Mill.) fruit stored in air, {{in order to}} gain a better understanding of in vivo enzyme regulation. Analyses were also performed with fruit treated with 20 % CO 2 - 20 % O 2 to define the role of PEPC as part of an adaptive mechanism to high external carbon dioxide levels. The results revealed that the special kinetic characteristics of the enzyme from mesocarphigh Vmax and low sensibility to L-malate inhibition - are related to the active acid metabolism of these fruits and point to a high rate of reassimilation of respired C 02 into keto-acids. With respect to fruit stored in air, PEPC in crude extracts from CO 2 -treated <b>cherimoyas</b> gave a similar Vmax (1. 12 ± 0. 03 μkat-mg- 1 protein), a lower apparent Km (68 ± 9 μM for PEP) and a higher I 50 of L-malate (5. 95 ± 0. 3 mM). These kinetic values showed the increase in the affinity of this enzyme toward one of its substrate, PEP, by elevated external CO 2 concentrations. The lower Km value and lower sensitivity to L-malate are consistent with higher in vivo carboxylation reaction efficiency in CO 2 -treated <b>cherimoyas,</b> while pointing to an additional enzyme regulation system via CO 2. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.
