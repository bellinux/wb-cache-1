500|$|The spotted {{sandgrouse}} reaches {{a length of}} about [...] The male has a small reddish-brown nape surrounded by a band of pale grey that extends to the bill and round the neck in a collar. The chin, neck and throat are orange and the breast grey. The upper parts are pinkish-grey with dark flight feathers and dark patches on the wings, tail and lower belly. The primaries are pale with dark trailing edges, a fact that distinguishes this species from the <b>crowned</b> <b>sandgrouse</b> (Pterocles coronatus) which has completely dark primaries. The female also has an orange throat region but is generally duller in plumage than the male. The body colour is greyish-brown liberally spotted with small dark markings and with dark patches on the wings, tail and lower belly. The central tail feathers in both sexes are elongated {{but not to the}} extent that they are in the pin-tailed sandgrouse (Pterocles alchata). When flying overhead, a dark belly stripe is visible.|$|E

50|$|A {{fairly small}} {{sandgrouse}} which appears rather uniformy coloured {{from a distance}} except for darker flight feathers, the wholly dark flight fetahers being the best feature to identify <b>Crowned</b> <b>Sandgrouse</b> from the similar Spotted Sandgrouse. The dark flight feathers contrast with the sandy upper wing coverts and the creamy underwing coverts. The adult male has a black mask and lacks any grey tones on the neck and breast. The females and immatures lack the black mask and differ from Spotted Sandgrouse in having dark vermiculations, rather than spots, across the breast {{and all of the}} belly and not confined to the breast and upper belly as in Spotted. They are 27-29 cm long and have a wingspan of 52-63 cm.|$|E
