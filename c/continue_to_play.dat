Several Old Foresters also played for the Forest club, as Forest School was located less than a mile north of the ground.|$|E
5|$|The group {{recorded}} several independent EPs {{and played}} primarily in their New Orleans area before becoming noticed by Sparrow Records {{at a concert}} in 1999.

5|$|The {{original}} crop over festival {{celebrated the}} end of the sugarcane harvest. These festivals were held in the great house of the plantations, and included both slaves and plantation managers. Celebrations included drinking competitions, feasting, song and dance, and climbing a greased pole. Musical accompaniment was provided by triangle, fiddle, drums and a guitar, played by slave entertainers.

5|$|A {{controversy}} arose regarding {{whether to}} lay natural or artificial turf. Kristofer Hæstad, one of Start's star players, {{stated that he}} would not <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> for the club if artificial turf was laid. The contract with the municipality stated that the stadium would have to be built with artificial turf. In March, Start decided that they would instead lay natural grass, and if necessary pay the municipality for the cost of building another artificial turf venue. The name of the venue was announced on 21 October, after the club had signed a ten-year naming rights agreement with Sparebanken Sør worth NOK35 million. The rights to sell the naming rights were first transferred from the stadium owner to the company Rettighetskompaniet AS, which subsequently sold these to Sparebanken Sør.|$|E
5|$|At this time, Yiddish {{theater in}} London meant amateur clubs. The arrival of {{professional}} Yiddish actors from Russia worked great changes, bringing Yiddish theater in London {{to a new}} level and allowing a modest professionalism, though never at much more than a poverty wage. Adler's memoir acknowledges many people who helped him out in various ways. Eventually, with the aid in particular of Sonya's relative Herman Fiedler—a playwright, orchestra leader, and stage manager—the Adlers and the Grodners were able to take over the Prescott Street Club. There they presented generally serious theater to audiences of about 150. Fiedler adapted The Odessa Beggar from Felix Pyat's The Ragpicker of Paris, a tragicomic play written {{on the eve of the}} Revolutions of 1848. Adler starred in it, in a role he would <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> throughout his career.|$|E
5|$|Lennon {{played a}} mouth organ during a bus journey {{to visit his}} cousin in Scotland; the music caught the driver's ear. Impressed, the driver told Lennon of a {{harmonica}} he could have if he came to Edinburgh the following day, where one had been stored in the bus depot since a passenger left it on a bus. The professional instrument quickly replaced Lennon's toy. He would <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> harmonica, often using the instrument during the Beatles' Hamburg years, {{and it became a}} signature sound in the group's early recordings. His mother taught him how to play the banjo, later buying him an acoustic guitar. At 16, he played rhythm guitar with the Quarrymen.|$|E

5|$|Neverwinter Nights 2 {{went into}} {{development}} in July 2004. This sequel was designed with the Aurora Engine, also used by its predecessor, and the game's toolset {{was included in}} the game's release for players to use in designing their own adventures. The game's design team drew upon older role-playing video games, and decided that the player character would have to earn the respect of others by the things the character does. The game was also designed to be playable with other players online in a cooperative fashion. The game was released in October and November 2006. Official multiplayer support for the game was suspended in December 2012. In response, the Neverwinter Nights 2 community developed several initiatives by which players can <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> the game online.|$|E
5|$|Some <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> off the {{homosexual}} interpretations of Batman. One notable example occurred in 2000, when DC Comics {{refused to allow}} permission for the reprinting of four panels (from Batman #79, 92, 105 and 139) to illustrate Christopher York's paper All in the Family: Homophobia and Batman Comics in the 1950s. Another happened {{in the summer of}} 2005, when painter Mark Chamberlain displayed a number of watercolors depicting both Batman and Robin in suggestive and sexually explicit poses. DC threatened both artist and the Kathleen Cullen Fine Arts gallery with legal action if they did not cease selling the works and demanded all remaining art, as well as any profits derived from them.|$|E
5|$|Born in Meir, Stoke-on-Trent, {{he joined}} local club Stoke City {{as an amateur}} in 1964, making his first-team debut in September 1968. A hard-tackling defender, he soon {{established}} himself in the first team, playing in a centre-back partnership with Alan Bloor {{for much of his}} career. Stoke enjoyed {{one of the most successful}} periods of their history during his time at the club, as he helped Stoke to win the League Cup in 1972, featuring in successive FA Cup semi-finals in 1971 and 1972 and helping the club to successive fifth-place finishes in the First Division in 1973–74 and 1974–75. His bravery as a player meant that he also entered the Guinness Book of Records as the most injured man in football, although he was never able to fully recover after breaking his leg for the fifth time in his career in March 1975. He did manage to <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> competitive football, and helped Stoke to win promotion from the Second Division in 1978–79. He missed the entire 1980–81 season due to injury, and left the club in May 1982.|$|E

5|$|The Gateshead Senators (originally the Gateshead International Senators) are an American {{football}} club formed in 1988 when the Newcastle Senators, {{who played at}} Northern Rugby Club, moved across the Tyne {{to play at the}} Gateshead International Stadium. The club has had mixed fortunes but their most successful season came in 1999. Having won eight of their nine games in the regular season, the team won the Division One North title and advanced to the end-of-season playoffs. After beating the Merseyside Nighthawks 430 in the quarter-finals, the Senators defeated the Essex Spartans 3319 in the semi-finals to reach the championship final. At the Saffron Lane Stadium in Leicester, the Senators faced the Bristol Aztecs. In a tight encounter, the Senators claimed the Division One British American Football League title with a 72 victory. The club reached the playoffs again in the next three seasons but were unable to replicate that success, and after a season voluntarily spent in Division Two in 2003, returned to Division One North in 2004. They <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> in that division, and in the 2012 season failed to make the playoffs after recording five wins and five defeats in their ten games.|$|E
5|$|In 1975–76 Shero {{guided the}} Flyers to a 51–13–16 record {{highlighted}} by a 36–2–2 home ice record. Again {{they won the}} Patrick division and finished first overall in the Campbell Conference. The season saw the club set franchise records in points and winning percentage. The season also witnessed an exhibition game, that {{would become one of}} the most famous games in Flyers history. In 1976 the Soviet Red Army team toured North America and played four games against NHL clubs. On January 11, 1976, the Russians matched up against the Flyers at the Spectrum in Philadelphia. Entering the game the Red Army team was unbeaten, defeating both Boston and the Rangers and registering a tie against the Canadiens. Shero had studied the Soviet style of play, even traveling to the Soviet Union during different off-seasons. Shero even implemented some of the Russian style into his own system, altering it slightly. With his knowledge of the Russian system, Shero devised a game plan. The Russian system involved making several passes often to where a player had just moved from. Shero instructed the Flyers' players not to chase the puck, but rather hold their positions. While in the offensive zone the Flyer forwards were to hold the puck as much as possible to avoid counter-attacks. The Flyers won the game by a final of 4–1 and outshot the Red Army 49–13. The victory led some to see the Flyers as the best team in the world. Following the playoffs that distinction would not last. Bernie Parent had suffered a back injury that limited him to eleven regular season games; he was able to return for the first-round series win versus Toronto. But the pain became too much for Parent to <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> in subsequent series, and Shero was forced to use his back-up goaltender, Wayne Stephenson. The Flyers were also without second-line centre MacLeish, resulting in a depletion of scoring depth. Despite these setbacks Shero led Philadelphia past Boston in the semi-finals and back to the Stanley Cup Finals. However, the Flyers fell short of winning three straight cups, losing to Montreal in four consecutive games.|$|E
