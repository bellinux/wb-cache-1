According to Ted Polhemus and Lynn Procter, fashion {{can be described as}} adornment, of which there are two types: fashion and anti-fashion.

50|$|Despite the <b>commoditisation</b> of book {{production}} due to {{the printing}} press, the artistic tradition of jewelled bookbinding continued in England, though less frequently and often in simpler designs. Luxury bindings were still favoured by the English Court, which {{is evident from the}} records on the private library of Queen Elizabeth I, who favoured velvet bindings. On a visit to the Royal Library in 1598, Paul Hentzner remarked on the books ‘bound in velvet of different colours, though chiefly red, with clasps of gold and silver; some have pearls, and precious stones, set in their bindings.’ Throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the style evolved to be one using velvet, satin, silk, and canvas in bookbinding decorated less with jewels and more with embroidery, metal threads, pearls, and sequins.|$|E

The purity of running was taken away when Smith entered the race because the race dehumanised him. The race made Smith a commodity for nationalisation that he was uncomfortable with. When the sport of running became professional it lost its sense of purity and became a commodity. Sillitoe rejects the <b>commoditisation</b> of running in [...] "The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner" [...] (Small 142). This is why Smith chooses to forfeit the race. Helen Small states, “…the weight of literary attention seems to be focused on a ‘pre-professional era’—either written at that time or looking back at it for inspiration”.

50|$|Later movies {{centered}} on sex-laden folklore, such as Boccaccios Decameron (1971), Chaucers The Canterbury Tales (1972), and Il fiore delle mille e una notte (literally The Flower of 1001 Nights, released in English as Arabian Nights, 1974). These films are usually grouped as the Trilogy of Life. While basing them on classics, Pasolini wrote the screenplays and took sole credit as writer. This trilogy, prompted largely by Pasolinis attempt {{to show the}} secular sacredness of the body against man-made social controls and especially against the venal hypocrisy of religious state (indeed, the religious characters in The Canterbury Tales are shown as pious but amorally grasping fools) were an effort at representing a state of natural sexual innocence essential to {{the true nature of}} free humanity. Alternately playfully bawdy and poetically sensuous, wildly populous, subtly symbolic and visually exquisite, the films were wildly popular in Italy and remain perhaps his most enduringly popular works. Yet {{despite the fact that the}} trilogy as a whole is considered by many as a masterpiece, Pasolini later reviled his own creation on account of the many soft-core imitations of these three films in Italy that happened afterwards on account of the very same popularity he wound up deeply uncomfortable with. He believed that a bastardisation of his vision had taken place that amounted to a <b>commoditisation</b> of the body he had tried to deny in his trilogy in the first place. The disconsolation this provided is seen as one of the primary reasons for his final film, Salo, in which humans are not only seen as commodities under authoritarian control but are viewed merely as ciphers for its whims, without the free vitality of the figures in the Trilogy of Life.|$|E

40|$|<b>Commoditisation</b> is {{a common}} {{phenomenon}} at most visitor attractions, and sacred sites are no exception: The merchandising opportunity is taken by many retailers to gain considerable economic benefit. For example, the annual sales of religious souvenirs' in Italy were estimated at US$ 255 m. While {{most of the studies}} associated with <b>commoditisation</b> at sacred sites concentrate on the commercialisation process or its soqial and/or cultural impacts, little research has been done to investigate its influence from a visitor's perspective. In addition, compared with Christian sites in western countries, Buddhist sites in China have received much less academic attention. 'The aim {{of this study is to}} fill the above research gaps by investigating the role of commoditised religious souvenirs in visitor experience' at Chinese Buddhist sites. Specifically, it seeks to achieve the follOWing objectives: to find out the major factors considered by visitors in evaluating their experience at Chinese Buddhist sites, the importance of the availability of religious souvenirs in the overall visitor experience, visitors' attitudes toward <b>commoditisation</b> at these sacred places and the factors that account for these different attitudes. The field research was carried out at three Buddhist sites in China, the Historic Ensemble of the Potala Palace in Lhasa, Wutai Mountain in Shanxi Province and the Lianhua Temple in Liaoning Province, which were chosen as a result of a classification according to different levels of <b>commoditisation.</b> In-depth interviews and observation were used as data collection methods. Overseas visitors were excluded from the sample to eliminate the influence caused by cultural differences on visitors' evaluation. Four types of factors were identified to be considered by the respondents during their evaluation of their visit experience, i. e. those related to people, place, facilities and critical incidents. Among these factors, the availability of Jeligious souvenirs was not regarded as significant to their visit by most respondents. Their attitudes to <b>commoditisation</b> at the Chinese Buddhist sites varied -from aversion, tolerance, acceptance. and enjoyment to mixed feelings and differentiation. Their opinions were formed mostly with consideration of the purpose, location. ownership and sales practice of the souvenir trade. There was the possibility that their age, profession, life stage, religious background and level of Buddhist knowledge had spme influence on their views on <b>commoditisation</b> at the Chinese Buddhist sites.

Decomposition into modules allows companies to use their own assets more effectively, to access unique external skills, to become more responsive to their customers and to lower their costs. Government, similarly faced by threats of <b>commoditisation</b> and competition as well as rising costs, can adopt a strategy of modularisation as well.

40|$|In {{the past}} two decades, social {{movements}} advocating for food sovereignty, the most visible being Via Campesina (the peasant’s way), have successfully articulated an alternative paradigm to the dominant models of industrial food production and free trade. Food sovereignty is constructed upon particular conceptions of the moral economies of peasants and assumptions about how peasants deploy moral values and economic practices to resist <b>commoditisation.</b> This ethnography establishes how peasants relate to the <b>commoditisation</b> of grain, land and labour in their everyday lives, and in turn reflects on what a food sovereignty rooted in campesino moral economies would look like. To do this, I conducted fieldwork in a village in the Matagalpa Highlands of Nicaragua, documenting campesinos’ everyday practices, moral ideologies and social norms regarding the production, transfer and exchange of food, land and labour. This research breaks down the idea that market exchanges are only profit-seeking and gift-giving is solely the product of mutuality. I argue that campesino households and communities engage partially with capitalist markets whilst pursuing autonomy from them. This is achieved through resisting <b>commoditisation</b> to different degrees for different commodities, with moral norms allowing certain things to fall {{in and out of}} commodity status. Moral norms allow for grain and labour to be sold as a commodity in particular circumstances whereas fully resist the sale of land. Autonomy from the market is underpinned by ideologies of solidarity, shaped by the social embeddedness of exchanges determined by relations of kinship, affiliation and locality. Whilst these ideologies succeed in stalling capitalist accumulation, they can reproduce conservative notions of the family and disguise intra-community class inequalities. I show how market exchanges are frequently used to deliver solidarity and that family networks {{can also be used to}} extract profit: exchanges have become a contested battlefield, where exploiters can portray themselves as helpers...|$|E

40|$|Defence date: 29 October 2012 Examining Board: Professor Bartolomé Yun-Casalilla (EUI) – Supervisor; Professor Luca Molà (EUI); Professor Harold James (Princeton University); Professor Jan de Vries (University of California at Berkeley). In {{the last}} three decades, many historians have {{analysed}} {{the development of new}} consumption patterns and changes in demand during the early modern period. The development of global trade during the early modern era has led to great interest in the historiography in trade and the consumption of long-distance products, such as American groceries, as well as Asian manufactured goods and groceries in the Atlantic world, particularly Europe. Given the significance that such processes had on trade and demand during the economic and social transition from the early modern to the modern eras, most these studies have focused on eighteenth-century Europe. However, few studies on the trade and consumption of import products in Europe and the Atlantic world have focused on the processes of market formation and <b>commoditisation</b> of such products. Market formation and the <b>commoditisation</b> of import products in Europe and the Atlantic world should not be taken for granted in history, since these processes were long in duration and complex in their development and geographical configuration. In fact, <b>commoditisation</b> of import products during the early modern epoch, besides not being always successful, was associated with colonial and commercial processes that in many cases took place in spaces and periods other than in eighteenth-century Europe. This thesis addresses a piece of this story. This dissertation focuses on the trade, circulation and consumption of Asian manufactured goods, such as Chinese silks and porcelains, in the Hispanic empire from about 1580 to 1640. This addresses the trade and the not-always commercial circulation of Asian manufactured goods in the Hispanic world by placing the Pacific Ocean and the Americas in the very centre of the analysis. Furthermore, the dissertation studies the consumption of these products by the elites of two different continental areas of the Hispanic empire, one American - New Spain - and another European - Castile. By raising the significance of the trans-Pacific axis of exchange of exchange of silk for silver, and of the Americas as principal centres of consumption of Asian goods to Castile {{by the end of the}} sixteenth century and the early seventeenth century, this thesis aims to demonstrate that the demand expansion for, <b>commoditisation,</b> and market shaping of Asian goods in the Atlantic world was a complex process, one in which not only the Cape route and the Indian Ocean but also the trans-Pacific trade and the American elites played inescapable roles...|$|E

30|$|The {{food supply}} chain has several key characteristics, {{including}} shelf life constraints for raw materials and perishable products, a long production throughput time, seasonality of production, the necessity of conditioned transportation and storage and safety concerns (Kuo and Chen, 2010). The food industry’s general overview of {{food supply chain}}s is constantly changing because the business environment is dynamic (Dani and Deep, 2010; Iijima et al., 1996; Kuo and Chen, 2010; Van Der Vorst and Beulens, 1999). Any changes in distance, time or temperature in the chain can significantly increase costs or disrupt the net present value of the activities and their added value in the supply chain (Verbic, 2006). Roth et al. (2008) discussed three main trends affecting food supply chains in contemporary business environments pertaining to <b>commoditisation,</b> consolidation and globalisation. <b>Commoditisation</b> distinguishes between food products as either commodities or value added. Consolidation refers to food supply chain members combining food categories and the levels of the supply chain in pursuit of higher margins. Globalisation leads {{not only to the}} global sourcing of raw materials but also to post-production activities such as the storage, transport, distribution and retail of final food products and their export and import (Kuo and Chen, 2010). The global nature of the food supply chain is vividly depicted by the sourcing of ingredients from different countries.|$|E
40|$|Since its {{inception}} in 1989, the private water sector of England and Wales has been enlisted as a centrepiece in debates concerning the merits of privatisation. Advocates point to increased environmental performance and increased investment. Critics note a significant retraction of the early free market aspirations and increasingly prescriptive regulation. However, market mechanisms and liberalisation are once again being emphasised in policy, reigniting the debate surrounding the <b>commoditisation</b> of water. This thesis engages directly and critically with Karen Bakker's 'Uncooperative Commodity' approach to the 'reregulation' of the industry, arguing its tenants must be adapted to accommodate these recent developments. While Bakker's earlier accounts of the reregulation of the water industry placed a great emphasis on the geography and biophysical properties of water, later work by both her and her contemporaries have developed more refined and socialised models of how water and society interact to produce temporary regularities in the material world. This thesis argues that an appropriate means of developing Bakker's original thesis would be a greater focus on socio-historical context when exploring the materiality of water, and hence {{the degree to which}} water may be transformed into a private commodity. Bob Jessop's Strategic Relational Approach (Jessop 2008) is deployed as a means of describing and relating: (1) the degree to which research can identify underlying mechanisms which govern the outcomes of attempts to commoditise water under capitalist modes of production, (2) {{the role of the state}} and politics in flanking or supporting the <b>commoditisation</b> of water and (3) the role of existing discursive-institutional structures in introducing path-dependencies and uneven power geometries which in turn effect the outcomes of collective action towards the <b>commoditisation</b> of water. The thesis documents historical developments in English and Welsh resource planning, regulation, and policy from 1945 to 2012 in order to explain the current structure of the industry, its response to water scarcity, and the origins of the current reform programme. It then focuses on the conflicts and tensions between actors in the industry generated by the current reform programme and their role in affecting the degree of success of the programme itself.

40|$|Research {{over the}} last decade has {{documented}} the return of paid domestic labour across many European societies. This scenario is part of the broader process of the <b>commoditisation</b> of social reproduction, which has accompanied the displacement of the male-breadwinner family model by the dual-worker / one-and-a-half-worker model in some states in the context of little or no re-alignment in the sexual division of domestic labour. The main focus of research has been on the outsourcing of female areas of domestic work, namely cleaning and care-giving, and despite Cancedda’s (2001) observation of evidence across Europe of <b>commoditisation</b> of stereotypically masculine domestic chores such as gardening and household repair/maintenance, there has been little or no empirical investigation of the phenomenon. This paper is concerned with addressing that gap. Drawing on analysis of the UK Time Use Survey, it firstly documents the scale and characteristics of UK households’ outsourcing of typically male areas of domestic work. It then seeks to locate the processes underlying this phenomenon, as well as its implications, drawing on the analysis of in-depth interviews with both partners in couple households with dependent children which buy-in help with male domestic work on a repeated basis. The analysis suggests that there are strong parallels with the <b>commoditisation</b> of female areas of domestic work, with the outsourcing of male domestic jobs being found {{to play an important role}} in couples’ strategies for reconciling work and rest of life. In particular, the attempt by men to conform to the normative expectation of the ‘good father’ – someone who combines breadwinning with nurturing and a more active and involved role in raising children – in the context of a largely unsupportive institutional framework, emerges as a key factor underlying couples’ decision to outsource male domestic jobs. Moreover, there is evidence that men are doubly “let off the hook”, since a common outcome in households of outsourcing of male domestic jobs is that responsibility for its management falls to female partners. These findings are then considered in relation to the broader questions of the gender use of time and gender equality within the contemporary work-life balance policy regime in the UK...|$|E

40|$|The Scottish Gael is {{objectified}} in an un-modified ‘Tourist Gaze’; {{a condition}} that is best understood from a post-colonial perspective. John Urry showed that cultures are objectified by the gaze of a global tourist industry. The unequal power relations in that gaze can be mediated through resistance {{and the production of}} staged touristic events. The process leads to <b>commoditisation</b> and in-authenticity and this is the current discourse on Scottish tourism icons. An ethnographic study of tour guiding shows a pattern of (re) -presentation of a silenced and near invisible Gaeldom. By building upon Foucauldian theories of power, Said’s critique of Orientalism’s discourse and Spivak on agency, this unmodified gaze can be explained from a postcolonial perspective. Six related aspects of Gaeldom’s (re) -presentation are revealed; the discourse of the Victorian invention of Scottish cultural icons, and, by metonymic extension, Gaelic culture; the <b>commoditisation</b> of Gaelic culture {{in the image of the}} Highland Warrior; the re-naming of landscape and invention of new place narratives; historical presence by invitation; elision with Irish culture; and, the mute Gael. Combined, the elements of (re) -presentation result in the distancing and the rendering opaque of Gaelic culture. The absence of informed mediators, either tourist authorities or individuals, the lack of an oppositional narrative and the pervasive discourse of invention reduces the Gael to a silenced subaltern ‘other’. Thus the unmediated tourist ‘gaze’ continues. This exceptionally singular condition of Scottish Gaeldom is comprehensible through analysis of Scottish tourism from a postcolonial perspective...|$|E
