In some domain cassettes, there are only two or few DBL domains and CIDR domains, but in others they cover {{the entire length of the}} PfEMP1. These differences are responsible for different binding capacity among different PfEMP1s.

Its molecular size is approximately 150 kDa. In domain cassette (DC) 4 type, the ECD is made up of three domains DBLα1.1/1.4, CIDRα1.6 and DBLβ3. The DBLβ3 domain contains a binding site for intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1). This is particularly implicated with the development of brain infection. VAR2CSA is atypical in having a single domain cassette that consists of three N terminal DBLPAM domains followed by three DBLε domains and one CIDRPAM. The seven domains always occur together.

Results: A random N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine mutagenesis was performed on E. coli K 4 to isolate mutants showing an increased production of chondroitin. Several mutants were isolated, one of which, here named VZ 15, produced about 80 % more chondroitin than the wild type E. coli.

40|$|Summary. Effects of four mucopolysaccharides and dextran {{sulphate}} on penicillin-induced lysis of Staphylococcus aureus FDA 209 P were studied. Heparin and dextran sulphate inhibited lysis, whereas {{hyaluronic acid}} enhanced it. <b>Chondroitin</b> <b>sulphates</b> <b>A</b> and C had no effect. Incubation of S. aureus suspended in 0 - 03 M phosphate buffer (PH 7 - 0) with dextran sulphate inhibited autolysis of the bacteria, whereas incubation with hyaluronic acid enhanced autolysis. Both extracellular and cell-associated autolysin activities of S. aureus were suppressed by dextran sulphate and {{high concentrations of}} heparin. The addition of hyaluronic acid enhanced autolysin activity. The release of lipoteichoic acid (LTA), a modulator of autolysin activity, from penicillin-treated bacteria was inhibited by heparin and dextran sulphate.

40|$|The {{structure}} of the proteoglycans from normal pig nucleus pulposus and relatively normal human annulus fibrosus and nucleus pulposus was investigated in detail {{and the results were}} compared with the current structural model of proteoglycans of hyaline cartilage.

40|$|This {{paper has}} as its {{principal}} object the demonstration {{of changes in the}} chemical composition ofthe nucleus pulposus associated with disc prolapse. In pursuance ofthis it has been necessary also to investigate along parallel lines the chemistry of the normal ageing process. In the past few years a great deal has been learned about the normal intervertebral disc, and about the changes in it which accompany advancing age. Much light has been thrown on the functioning ofthe disc by Sylv#{ 233 }n’s work (1951) which established the ultrastructure of the nucleus pulposus: he showed it to consist of a network of fine collagen fibrils, about which are aggregated clumps of a polysaccharide/protein complex forming a gel and responsible for the very high imbibition capacity of the nucleus.

40|$|A {{biochemical}} {{analysis has}} been carried out of metabolically labelled proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans synthesized by a haemopoietic multipotential stem cell line, FDCP-mix. The only proteoglycan identified in these multipotential cells was a homogeneous component that contained chondroitin 4 -sulphate chains (Mr approximately 10, 000) arranged in close proximity in a proteinase-resistant domain of the protein core. Small quantities of free chondroitin 4 -sulphate were also detected. Following a 48 h incubation with Na 2 35 SO 4 the majority of the 35 S-radiolabelled proteoglycans (approximately 80 %) were associated with the cells, mainly in an intracellular compartment, and the remaining 20 % were in the culture medium. Pulse-chase studies demonstrated two turnover pathways for the newly synthesized cellular proteoglycans. In the minor pathway, the proteoglycans were secreted rapidly into the medium without any discernable structural modification. In the major pathway the proteoglycans seemed to be transferred into a storage compartment from which the intact macromolecules were not secreted. Eventually, these proteoglycans were degraded to yield free polysaccharide chains and these chains were then released into the medium, but only at a relatively slow rate. There was very little intracellular degradation of <b>chondroitin</b> <b>sulphate</b> chains. The pathway to polysaccharide secretion was a slow stepwise process with a time-lag of about 5 h between proteoglycan synthesis and the appearance of free <b>chondroitin</b> <b>sulphate</b> and <b>a</b> second time-lag, also of about 5 h, before these chains began to be secreted.

40|$|Includes bibliographies. The MSMPR was {{designed}} according to chemical engineering principles and {{tests showed that}} it conforms to the assumptions necessary for conventional MSMPR analysis. Various crystalliser offtakes and six system designs were developed and tested to allow measurements using the thermostatted flow cell. The flow cell allows for continuous measurement of the sample dispersion using a noninvasive monitoring instrument - a Malvern Particle Size Analyser. In this technique, measurement of the steady state crystal size distribution {{is based on a}} diffraction pattern produced by the particles in a parallel beam of monochromatic light. Comparative measurements were obtained by sampling directly from the crystalliser and analysing the product in a Coulter Counter. In this technique, the steady state crystal size distribution is measured by the change in resistance as particles, in an electrically conductive liquid, pass through the Coulter aperture. Due to the large volumes required by the crystalliser, it was necessary to pool urines. Aliquots of volume 1. 5 dm 3 from the 24 hour urines of each of 8 male controls were pooled. The first series of experiments were performed to investigate the effect on calcium oxalate crystallisation of varying the concentration of sodium oxalate solutions used to initiate crystallisation, and also to investigate the effect of varying the temperature. A further series of experiments was performed to determine the effect of adding inhibitors individually (citrate, magnesium, <b>chondroitin</b> <b>sulphate</b> <b>A)</b> and in combination (citrate and magnesium). The inhibitor experiments were performed using two different approaches. In the first, the pooled urine was pre-treated with the inhibitor prior to being introduced into the crystalliser. In the second set of experiments, the inhibitor was introduced into the crystalliser via a separate, independent feed. It is suggested that these approaches represent crude models respectively of (a) the endogenous presence of inhibitors and (b) the oral administration of such inhibitors. Each individual experiment was performed using three different urine pools. The steady state crystal size distributions obtained from both the Coulter and the Malvern instruments were used to determine nucleation and growth rates in each urine. Scanning electron microscopy was used to obtain qualitative and semi-quantitative data related to crystal morphology, number, size and degree of aggregation. Both nucleation and growth rates increased as the concentrations of the initiating sodium oxalate solutions increased. Nucleation and growth rates also increased with increasing temperatures. In the latter series of experiments, different calcium oxalate crystal phases precipitated at the various temperatures. Citrate inhibited nucleation and growth of calcium oxalate, irrespective of how it was admitted to the crystalliser. Magnesium was found to inhibit growth only and, like citrate, this role was independent of how it was introduced into the crystalliser. Although both inhibited growth, the effect of the citrate was greater. When both components were added in combination, inhibition was observed to be additive. In all cases, inhibitory effects increased with increasing concentration. <b>Chondroitin</b> <b>sulphate</b> <b>A</b> was found to inhibit nucleation; inhibition of growth was minimal at the concentrations tested. Aggregation of calcium oxalate crystals was found to be inhibited by <b>chondroitin</b> <b>sulphate</b> <b>A.</b> The results of the calcium oxalate crystallisation kinetic studies, obtained by using Malvern particle sizing and Coulter Counter techniques independently of each other, showed general agreement.

A non-hemolytic and hyaluronidase negative S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus mutant strain was engineered in this work {{by the addition of}} two E. coli K 4 genes, namely kfoA and kfoC, involved in the biosynthesis of chondroitin-like polysaccharide. Chondroitin is the precursor of <b>chondroitin</b> <b>sulphate,</b> <b>a</b> nutraceutical present on the market as anti-arthritic drug, that is lately being studied for its intrinsic bioactivity. In small scale bioreactor batch experiments the production of about 1.46  ±  0.38  g/L hyaluronic acid and 300  ±  28  mg/L of chondroitin with an average molecular weight of 1750 and 25  kDa, respectively, was demonstrated, providing an approach to the concurrent production of both biopolymers in a single fermentation.|$|E
40|$|Pregnancy-associated malaria, {{a manifestation}} of severe malaria, {{is the cause of}} up to 200, 000 infant deaths a year, through the effects of placental {{insufficiency}} leading to growth restriction and preterm delivery. Development of a vaccine is one strategy for control. Plasmodium falciparum-infected red blood cells accumulate in the placenta through specific binding of pregnancy-associated parasite variants that express the VAR 2 CSA antigen to <b>chondroitin</b> <b>sulphate</b> <b>A</b> on the surface of syncytiotrophoblast cells. Parasite accumulation, accompanied by an inflammatory infiltrate, disrupts the cytokine balance of pregnancy with the potential to cause placental damage and compromise foetal growth. Multigravid women develop immunity towards VAR 2 CSA-expressing parasites in a gravidity-dependent manner which prevents unfavourable pregnancy outcomes. Although current vaccine design, targeting VAR 2 CSA antigens, has succeeded in inducing antibodies artificially, this candidate may not provide protection during the first trimester and may only protect those women living in areas endemic for malaria. It is concluded that while insufficient information about placental-parasite interactions is presently available to produce an effective vaccine, incremental progress is being made towards achieving this goal...|$|E
40|$|The role {{of sodium}} {{hyaluronate}} and sodium <b>chondroitin</b> <b>sulphate</b> {{in the management}} of bladder disease Rocco Damiano and Antonio Cicione Abstract: Bladder epithelium is not only a simple defence against infections, {{but it is also a}} specialized tissue regulating complex bladder functions and playing an active role in the pathogenesis of many bladder diseases. There is strong evidence that different chronic inflammatory bladder diseases, such as recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI), chemical or radiation cystitis and painful bladder syndrome/interstitial cystitis (PBS/IC), can be pathophy-siologically linked in the first step of the disease to the loss of the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) mucous layer independently of the original cause of the inflammatory process. The aim of this article is to review the current evidence on the clinic applications of GAGs in urology, with particular emphasis on the therapeutic use of hyaluronic acid (HA) and <b>chondroitin</b> <b>sulphate</b> (CS). <b>A</b> comprehensive electronic literature search was conducted in May 2011 using the Medline database. Three studies supported the decrease of the rate of recurren...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{in vitro}} studies have {{indicated}} that hyaluronan, when compared to buffer controls, effects a controlled and sustained release of diclofenac through the skin by the formation of a reservoir of the drug around the basement membrane. The aim {{of this study was to}} further characterize the drug delivery properties of hyaluronan by comparing it with other gel-forming materials and another glycosaminoglycan, <b>chondroitin</b> <b>sulphate.</b> The results show that neither NaCMC (at a weight or theologically equivalent concentration) nor <b>chondroitin</b> <b>sulphate</b> (at <b>a</b> weight equivalent concentration) exert the controlled release effect seen for the hyaluronan formulation in full thickness skin. A significant difference is seen between the cumulative amounts of labelled diclofenac diffused from the controls at times where sink conditions for the hyaluronan formulation are reached (p less than or equal to 0. 05). Mass balance calculations from each experiment show that significantly more activity is retained in the skin when applied in 2. 5 % HA, compared to 2. 5 % NaCMC (p less than or equal to 0. 02), 3. 2 % NaCMC (p less than or equal to 0. 05) and 2. 5 % <b>chondroitin</b> <b>sulphate</b> (p less than or equal to 0. 02). This study supports the hypothesis that the controlled release and epidermal retention of diclofenac is a characteristic specific to the hyaluronan formulation and does not appear to be observed with another theologically equivalent gel, such as NaCMC or <b>an</b> alternative glycosaminoglycan, <b>chondroitin</b> <b>sulphate...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Chondroitin</b> <b>sulphate</b> is <b>a</b> natural {{component}} of cartilage and other body tissue. This substance is not authorised in Germany as a medicinal product for oral administration. However, <b>chondroitin</b> <b>sulphate</b> {{is to be}} found in numerous products that are on sale as food supplements. The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) was asked to undertake a health assessment of the use of isolated <b>chondroitin</b> <b>sulphate</b> in foods (food supplements) in amounts at which no pharmacological (medicinal/therapeutic) effect is to be expected. Food supplements are foods. Unlike medicinal products they do not, in principle, require marketing authorisation. They must be safe and not harmful to health. Their ingredients should not have any pharmacological effects. As, up to now, no oral dose could be established by the national drug authority (Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices - BfArM) upwards of which the therapeutic (pharmacological) efficacy of a substance can be assumed, BfR based its assessment of the use of isolated <b>chondroitin</b> <b>sulphate</b> in food supplements on intakes of between 800 and 1200 milligram per day. BfR expressly points out that no statement is made about possible pharmacological effects, and that this is not a recommendation to admix amounts of this kind as daily intakes to food supplements/foods. The official food control authorities in the federal Laender decide on the extent to which <b>chondroitin</b> <b>sulphate</b> products require marketing authorisation and whether and in what amounts the use of <b>chondroitin</b> <b>sulphate</b> is, in principle, possible in food supplements. Because of the missing data and existing uncertainties protective measures are recommended on precautionary grounds for pregnant and breast-feeding women, children, adolescents and individuals who are on anti-coagulant medication. These groups of individuals should be advised against consuming products of this kind by the corresponding wording on the label...|$|R
