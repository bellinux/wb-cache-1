30|$|Another ER sheet-enriched {{protein that}} interacts with {{microtubule}}s is <b>Climp</b> 63. The microtubule association by <b>Climp</b> 63 {{has been proposed}} to regulate the mobility of the translocon and, thus, may indirectly regulate {{the stability of the}} translocating complex. We found that depletion of either protein increases translocon mobility. However, depletion of <b>Climp</b> 63 does not cause ER stress as seen with Sec 61 β, suggesting that the microtubule-binding ability of Sec 61 β has a direct impact on translocon, and that of <b>Climp</b> 63 may have other functions, such as positioning ER sheets in the perinuclear region.|$|R
40|$|A set of conserved binding sites {{recognized}} by a transcription factor {{is called a}} motif, {{which can be found}} by many applications of comparative genomics for identifying over-represented segments. Moreover, when numerous putative motifs are predicted from a collection of genome-wide data, their similarity data can be represented as a large graph, where these motifs are connected to one another. However, an efficient clustering algorithm is desired for clustering the motifs that belong to the same groups and separating the motifs that belong to different groups, or even deleting an amount of spurious ones. In this work, a new motif clustering algorithm, <b>CLIMP,</b> is proposed by using maximal cliques and sped up by parallelizing its program. When a synthetic motif dataset from the database JASPAR, a set of putative motifs from a phylogenetic foot-printing dataset, and a set of putative motifs from a ChIP dataset are used to compare the performances of <b>CLIMP</b> and two other high-performance algorithms, the results demonstrate that <b>CLIMP</b> mostly outperforms the two algorithms on the three datasets for motif clustering, {{so that it can be}} a useful complement of the clustering procedures in some genome-wide motif prediction pipelines. <b>CLIMP</b> is available at [URL]...|$|R

30|$|Our results {{characterize}} {{a previously}} unidentified {{activity of the}} cytosolic domain of Sec 61 β. We show that Sec 61 β interacts directly with microtubules, and {{is involved in the}} maintenance of ER homeostasis. Specifically, depletion of Sec 61 β causes ER stress in both C. elegans and mammalian cells, and rescue of the stress appear to associate with the microtubule-binding activity, even when the cytosolic domain of Sec 61 β is replaced by the MTB domain of <b>Climp</b> 63. Our results also suggest that the microtubule-binding activity of Sec 61 β likely stabilizes ribosome-translocon interactions.

40|$|In the experiment, {{the effect}} of {{chemical}} (A) and biological (B) additiva on the fermentation quality of <b>climper</b> high moisture maize grain corn was examined, compared with the untreated control (K). The chemical means contained propionic, formic and benzoic acids and ammonium formate as effective substances. As effective substances of bacterial water–soluble inoculants, selected were bacterial strains of Propionibacterium shermanii JS and Lactobacillus casei LC- 705. Both conservative preservatives were added equally to the ensilaged material. The addition of chemical additivum under conditions of our experiment increased statistically significantly (P< 0. 01) the contents of acetic acid (7. 66 ± 0. 95  g/kg DM), ethanol (11. 22 ± 0. 65  g/kg DM) and pH values (4. 33 ± 0. 02) in experimental silages. Simultaneously, a statistically significant (P< 0. 01) inhibition of lactic acid formation (15. 17 ± 2. 75  g/kg DM) and of total content of all fermentation acids (22. 33 ± 2. 38  g/kg DM) occurred. The bacterial inoculant increased significantly (P< 0. 05) the content of lactic acid (26. 78 ± 2. 63  g/kg DM) and the total acid content (32. 87 ± 2. 88  g/kg DM) in inoculated silages. The inoculation positive effect was demonstrated highly significantly (P< 0. 01) in reduction of ethanol amount (2. 14 ± 0. 40  g/kg DM) and of totat acidification.

30|$|In {{eukaryotic}} cells, the {{endoplasmic reticulum}} (ER) {{is composed of}} membrane tubules and sheets (Shibata et al., 2006). Tubules are 30 – 50 nm in diameter and have a high membrane curvature at their cross-section (Hu et al., 2011), which is stabilized by a class of integral membrane proteins including reticulons and DP 1 /Yop 1 p (Hu et al., 2008; Voeltz et al., 2006). In contrast, sheets are formed by parallel membranes ~ 50 nm apart (Barlowe, 2010). The cisternal spacing is regulated by <b>Climp</b> 63 (Shibata et al., 2010), which is proposed to be a luminal bridge, and {{the surface of the}} sheets are kept flat, likely by kinectin and p 180, which scaffold the membrane as a rod-like structure (Shibata et al., 2010; Zhang and Hu, 2016).|$|R

30|$|Several ER-resident {{proteins}} that associate with microtubules have been identified. STIM 1 binds to the microtubule plus end, moving it closer to its interaction partner on the plasma membrane, Orai (Carrasco and Meyer, 2011; Grigoriev et al., 2008; Park et al., 2009). Tubule-localized REEP 1, a homolog of DP 1 (also known as REEP 5), has a C-terminal microtubule-binding domain, {{the loss of}} which causes hereditary spastic paraplegia (Park et al., 2010). ER sheet marker <b>Climp</b> 63 also engages microtubules using its cytosolic N-terminus in a phosphorylation-dependent manner (Klopfenstein et al., 1998; Vedrenne et al., 2005). Disruption of the interaction likely alters the mobility of sheet-localized translocon complex (Nikonov et al., 2007). These {{findings suggest that the}} ER-microtubule association has physiological importance. However, the specific roles of such association are not clear.|$|R
40|$|Following synthesis, {{integral}} membrane proteins {{dwell in}} the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) for variable periods that are typically rate limiting for plasma membrane delivery. In neurons, the ER extends {{for hundreds of}} microns as an anastomosing network throughout highly branched dendrites. However, {{little is known about}} the mobility, spatial scales, or dynamic regulation of cargo in the dendritic ER. Here, we show that membrane proteins, including AMPA-type glutamate receptors, rapidly diffuse within the continuous network of dendritic ER but are confined by increased ER complexity at dendritic branch points and near dendritic spines. The spatial range of receptor mobility is rapidly restricted by type I mGluR signaling through a mechanism involving protein kinase C (PKC) and the ER protein <b>CLIMP</b> 63. Moreover, local zones of ER complexity compartmentalize ER export and correspond to sites of new dendritic branches. Thus, local control of ER complexity spatially scales secretory trafficking within elaborate dendritic arbors. ...|$|R
40|$|SummaryThe {{endoplasmic}} reticulum (ER) {{consists of the}} nuclear envelope and a peripheral network of tubules and membrane sheets. The tubules are shaped by the curvature-stabilizing proteins reticulons and DP 1 /Yop 1 p, but how the sheets are formed is unclear. Here, we identify several sheet-enriched membrane proteins in the mammalian ER, including proteins that translocate and modify newly synthesized polypeptides, as well as coiled-coil membrane proteins that are highly upregulated in cells with proliferated ER sheets, {{all of which are}} localized by membrane-bound polysomes. These results indicate that sheets and tubules correspond to rough and smooth ER, respectively. One of the coiled-coil proteins, <b>Climp</b> 63, serves as a “luminal ER spacer” and forms sheets when overexpressed. More universally, however, sheet formation appears to involve the reticulons and DP 1 /Yop 1 p, which localize to sheet edges and whose abundance determines the ratio of sheets to tubules. These proteins may generate sheets by stabilizing the high curvature of edges...|$|R

30|$|In {{eukaryotic}} cells, the {{endoplasmic reticulum}} (ER) is a continuous membrane system involved in many critical cellular processes, including protein synthesis, lipid synthesis, and calcium storage. Morphologically, the ER {{is composed of}} cistern-like sheet structures and a reticular network of tubules. Classes of integral membrane proteins that shape the ER have been identified: the reticulons and DP 1 /Yop 1 p proteins generate ER tubules by inducing high curvature in the membrane (Voeltz et al., 2006), the atlastin GTPases and Sey 1 p/RHD 3 proteins mediate fusion of ER membranes, forming a tubular network (Hu et al., 2009; Orso et al., 2009), and <b>Climp</b> 63, Kinectin, and p 180 {{play a role in}} stabilizing ER sheets (Shibata et al., 2010). Mutations in the determinants of ER tubules cause growth defects, short root hairs, and a neurodegenerative disease called hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) (Hu et al., 2009), and sheet-formation proteins are strongly upregulated in professional secretory cells when ER sheet expansion is needed, suggesting that ER morphology is tightly associated with its physiological functions (Shibata et al., 2010).|$|R
30|$|Next, because Sec 61 β, as a {{component}} of the ER translocon, is associated with the protein synthesis pathway, we tested whether its depletion affects protein homeostasis in the ER. Defective protein production in the ER activates UPR signaling. In Sec 61 β-depleted COS- 7 cells, splicing of XBP 1 mRNA (indicative of IRE 1 activation) was detected (Fig.  3 A). The level of splicing was more prominent when Sec 61 β was more efficiently depleted, but overall was moderate compared to that triggered by thapsigargin (TG) treatment (Fig.  3 B). Similarly, eIF 2 α phosphorylation (indicative of PERK activation) was elevated when Sec 61 β was knocked down (Fig.  3 A). XBP 1 splicing was also observed when Sec 61 β was depleted with siRNAs instead of shRNAs (Fig.  3 C). In contrast, depletion of ER tubule marker REEP 1 or sheet marker <b>Climp</b> 63 did not cause detectable ER stress (Fig. S 2 C–E), even though both of them interact with microtubules. These data demonstrate that the loss of Sec 61 β induces ER stress.|$|R
40|$|In a solid-liquid {{two-phase}} flow,the {{separation of}} particles or {{a reduction of}} particle concentration is often desired. Utilization of ultrasound has been considered as one technique for the separation of particles. Particles are known to aggregate due to the radiation pressure of ultrasound. However,the effect of ultrasound including cavitation on particle behavior is not well understood. Thus,we horizontally irradiated water with aluminum particles having a density of 2720 kg/㎥ and diameters of 50 to 150 µm or smaller aluminum powder(flakes) in a rectangular vessel by ultrasound at frequencies of 23 kHz or 100 kHz. In this way,a standing wave was formed. The following results were obtained. For ultrasound of 100 kHz,the aluminum powder aggregates in vertical bands. When acoustic cavitation existed at the frequency of 23 kHz,we noticed that the aluminum particles aggregate as clumps near antinodes of the sound pressure profile because of the flow induced by acoustic cavitation. When the particles are continuously provided in a relatively high concentration,particle clumps form and remain. Then,the particle clumps become larger and suddenly fall faster than the surrounding small particles. Such phenomena repeat themselves periodically. At relatively low concentrations,particle <b>climps</b> do not become large and remain stationary at the same positions...|$|R

30|$|As a tail-anchored protein, human Sec 61 β {{contains}} an N-terminal cytosolic domain (cytSec 61 β) of 70 amino acids (Fig. S 1 B). To pinpoint the microtubule-associating region in Sec 61 β, {{we performed a}} serial truncation of the domain (Fig.  1 E). When the first 19 residues were deleted, the Sec 61 β mutant {{was still able to}} bundle microtubules with the ER (Fig.  1 F). However, when the deletion was extended to 44 residues, such defects were no longer seen in the ER and microtubule morphology (Fig.  1 F). We then removed residues 20 – 44 of cytSec 61 β and found that the mutant failed to tangle the ER and microtubules (Fig.  1 F and 1 G). The region of residues 20 – 44 is enriched with positively charged amino acids. When all six of them (K 20, R 25, R 32, R 34, K 35, and R 42) were substituted by alanine, the mutant Sec 61 β-HA no longer linked microtubule to the ER (Fig.  1 F and 1 G). In contrast and as expected, when we replaced cytSec 61 β with a known microtubule-binding (MTB) fragment (residues 1 – 80 of <b>Climp</b> 63), the chimera MTBClimp 63 -TMSec 61 β behaved the same as Sec 61 β-HA in gluing the ER and microtubules into swirls (Fig.  1 F and 1 G). Like all of the truncation mutants, the chimera localized specifically to the ER (Fig. S 1 C). Notably, alterations of the cytSec 61 β caused decreased expression level (Fig. S 1 D). These results suggest that the microtubule-binding site of Sec 61 β is within a middle region of its cytosolic domain.|$|R
