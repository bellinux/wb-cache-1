A obra do escritor japonês Shusaku Endõ (1923 - 1996) expressa tal angústia e tais dúvidas através dos personagens dos seus romances, abordando temas teológicos que são «pontos quentes» na nossa sociedade. No presente estudo, apresentamos o seu romance Chinmoku [Silêncio], o qual constitui um extracto do Capítulo III da dissertação doutoral defendida em Dezembro 2008, na Pontifícia Universidade Gregoriana, Roma, com o título Transcultural Theodicy in the Fiction of Shusaku Endõ.

There is a special focus on the value of maternity and the resulting education that was provided to girls and young women so that they could meet the sacred duty of being both wives and mothers. Although this education did not exclude academic instruction, this was not afforded priority. Education provided women with the knowledge required to fulfil the tasks that were «appropriate» to them.

On one hand, European companies have the freedom of establishment, {{which means that they}} have the right to operate internationally in equal conditions with respect to national companies. On the other, EU law has tried to achieve two objects on corporate regulation: uniformity and harmonization. Uniformity can be reached by Regulations, i. e. the emblematic case of the Societas Europea (SE) or the European Economic Interest Grouping (EEIG). When political compromise didn’t allow European Institution to uniform, they used Directives with the aim of harmonize some pivotal aspects of the regulation of a company, especially if it operates cross-border. An example can be the cross-border mergers, which often could not be set under national legislation before the implementation of the 2005 Directive on the matter. Uniformity in EU corporate law will be highlighted in the article. El artículo describe los principales logros de la Unión Europea en cuanto a la regulación comunitaria del derecho societario. En particular, se hace especial énfasis sobre dos aspectos importantes de la regulación de las empresas por parte del derecho supranacional. Por una parte, las empresas europeas gozan de la libertad de establecimiento, es decir la facultad de operar de forma transnacional, en igualdad de condiciones con las demás empresas nacionales. Por otra, el derecho comunitario ha tratado de lograr dos objetivos en materia de derecho societario: la uniformidad y la armonización. Cuando intervino para uniformar, la Unión Europea se valió de los Reglamentos, como es el caso emblemático de la Societas Europea (SE) o la Agrupación Europea de Interés Económico. Cuando la mediación política no permitió uniformar, las instituciones comunitarias intervinieron con Directivas al fin de armonizar algunos aspectos esenciales de la reglamentación de una empresa, especialmente si esta tiene negocios internacionales. Para hacer un ejemplo, pensamos a las fusiones transfronterizas, que a menudo no tenían reglamentación nacional antes de la Directiva de 2005 que reglamentó la materia.

A continuación, se insiste en la interdependencia de las reformas del pregrado, del posgrado y de la formación continuada. Se plantean luego los retos y dificultades que han de afrontarse a la hora de cambiar las distintas etapas de la educación médica.

To achieve this, first we present the basic concepts of "new professionalism" and the key strategies of current medical education, which is to train physicians capable of dealing with ethical, scientific and professional challenges that are arising at the beginning of this century. The interdependence of reforms in the undergraduate, graduate and ongoing training areas is then emphasized. The challenges and difficulties to be faced when switching to different stages of medical education are then outlined. It was concluded that, notwithstanding recent reforms in medical education, their great complexity and the still limited availability of contrasting assessments of their results, there are strong synergies between the principles and values of the "new professionalism" and the objectives of the reforms...|$|R

Lo anterior se ilustra con ejemplos de problemas de contraste de hipótesis, en <b>particular</b> <b>con</b> el problema de Behrens-Fisher. 1...|$|R
40|$|International forum {{shopping}} in disputes on liability {{can be a}} legitimate procedural strategy for plaintiffs in looking for a favourable jurisdiction. But it demands careful consideration of the pros and <b>cons.</b> In <b>particular,</b> {{the assumption that the}} selected court will prefer its own law in any case is not always honoured. The true (and more reliable) motives for {{forum shopping}} are aiming at the procedural climate in the selected forum state that seems favourable to the plaintiff (in the case of U. S. courts: jury trial, pre-trial discovery, and class actions). The defendant has but a limited number of remedies and procedural tactics to react upon the claimant’s forum shopping or anticipate it – which requires imagination and skilful reflection of all the conceivable steps to be taken by the plaintiff: ADR, anti-suit injunctions (only rarely available in continental Europe, however), declaratory actions for denial, torpedo suits, and, sometimes, the forum-non-conveniens objection. In order to keep undue excesses in forum shopping under control, it seems necessary that the international community, too, in conventions and treaties, agrees on reducing the choices and on banning exorbitant jurisdictions in national laws...|$|R
40|$|Este artículo presenta las diferentes formas de inserción laboral de trabajadores jóvenes en el Valle de Uco, en la provincia de Mendoza. Durante las últimas décadas, el Valle de Uco basó su patrón de desarrollo agrícola en un modelo intensivo y empresarial de sus tres principales cultivos: los viñedos, los frutales y las hortalizas. En la actualidad, atraviesa un proceso de profunda reconversión productiva, orientada mayoritariamente hacia el mercado externo, que {{entre otras}} consecuencias pasó a modificar el funcionamiento del mercado de trabajo local. En este artículo, se contemplan las diferentes situaciones que llevan al ingreso laboral de los jóvenes en este contexto, según el momento etáreo que atraviesen. Se analiza la relación que este proceso guarda con el tamaño y la estructura de las familias y la situación socio-económica del hogar al que pertenecen. También, se examina el vínculo entre las características de los hogares y la forma de inserción de los jóvenes en el mercado de trabajo, de acuerdo al tipo de ocupación en la que se desempeñan y al destino que le dan a sus ingresos. A partir de la realización de entrevistas en profundidad a trabajadores jóvenes y a informantes clave se pudo dar cuenta de las preferencias de los jóvenes con respecto a distintos tipos de trabajos, <b>con</b> <b>particular</b> énfasis en ciertos trabajos agrícolas y, también en relación a su futuro laboral. This article {{deals with the}} {{different}} ways that young workers in the Uco Valley, at the province of Mendoza, enter to the agrarian local labour market. During the last decadas, the Uco Valley based its pattern of agricultural development in an intensive business model of its three main crops: vineyards, orchards, and vegetables. Currently, it is undergoing a process of profound restructuring of production, mainly oriented towards foreign markets, which among different consequences has modified the functioning of local labour markets. In this article, we referred to the different situations that lead to youngsters to start working in this context, according to their age periods, {{the relationship with the}} size and structure of their families, and the socio-economic situation of the households to which they belong. Also, the links between household characteristics and the various ways youngsters start working according to the type of task in which they can work, as well as the use that they give to their labour incomes, is examined. Using in-depth interviews with young workers and key informants, we could account for preferences of young workers towards different types of tasks, with particular emphasis on certain occupations and the reasons for those preferences, and also how they view their future careers...|$|R
40|$|Although the {{theoretical}} basis for reconstructing three-dimensional data from projection measurements has existed since Radon's work in 1917 (1), {{the utility of}} this technique has only more recently been established beginning with Bracewell's 1956 work on mapping mi crowave emission patterns from the sun (2). Since then investigators in widely divergent fields of study have applied the technique successfully. Of <b>particular</b> <b>con</b> sequence to the work presented here are the early med ical researchers and their contributions. Oldendorrs original 1961 experiment introduced the coi@cept of reconstructive tomography to the medical community (3).

In particular, this paper addresses the problem of extracting the features from user comments of a particular product, taking advantage of a corpus with a semistructured format: pros, cons and summary. In this paper we propose a technique to extract a set of features based on user generated pros and <b>cons</b> for a <b>particular</b> product. Then using this set we test a feature similarity function to obtain new features from reviews (both from the pros/cons and from the free text summary) of the same and other products. Our experimental results have shown interesting conclusions...|$|R

The mechanisms {{involved in this}} dysfunction remains still debated, therefore we evaluated the role of androgen, insulin and body weight on the serum VitD levels in women with or without PCOS. Eighty one patients 18 – 42 yrs old were studied into “SUMMER” and “WINTER” seasonal period: thirty seven PCOS, seventeen no-ovarian hyperandrogenic (noPCOS), twelve functional hypothalamic amenorrhea (FHA) and finally fifteen healthy (Con). Patients were further divided into: lean (L), obese (O), normo- (nINS) and hyperinsulinemic (hINS). All hormonal and metabolic parameters were measured at 1 - 7 days of the menstrual cycle. Our results show that VitD levels were lower in PCOS and in noPCOS than in FHA and <b>Con,</b> in <b>particular</b> in (O) and (hINS) PCOSs. Both in summer and in winter, PCOSs had basal VitD levels significantly lower than FHA and Con, whereas they were similar to noPCOS. Yet, LhINS and OPCOS had VitD levels lower than Con and noPCOS. VitD levels were comparable in LnINS PCOS and Con. In conclusion, PCOSs had levels of VitD lower than controls. Weight and hyperinsulinemia had a significant influence on these values. Finally, over 70 % of our healthy patients had VitD deficiency...|$|R
