40|$|The {{number of}} people in the United States with age-related maculopathy is {{increasing}} in recent years because of increasing longevity. However, it is possible that a birth <b>cohort</b> <b>effect,</b> due to different levels of exposure to risk factors, may explain changes in the prevalence of age-related maculopathy by age. In this report, the authors utilize data from the population-based Beaver Dam Eye Study (1988 – 2000) to examine this possibility. They propose a strategy to handle issues of longitudinal measurements and risk factor adjustment for analyzing the birth <b>cohort</b> <b>effect.</b> Results from the analysis (after adjusting for known risk factors) showed an apparent independent birth <b>cohort</b> <b>effect</b> on age-related maculopathy. The authors also found a strong positive association between age-related maculopathy and age, when comparing participants from the same birth cohort. The birth <b>cohort</b> <b>effect</b> was the same across different age groups, except for early age-related maculopathy, where older age increased the association. Our findings demonstrate that the birth <b>cohort</b> <b>effect</b> is likely attributable to unmeasured risk factors for age-related maculopathy and limitations of risk factor measurements.

40|$|Abstract Background Infection {{rates for}} many {{infectious}} diseases have declined {{over the past}} century. This has created a <b>cohort</b> <b>effect,</b> whereby older individuals experienced a higher infection rate in their past than younger individuals do now. As a result, age-stratified seroprevalence profiles often differ from what would be expected from constant infection rates. Methods Here, we account for the <b>cohort</b> <b>effect</b> by fitting an age-structured compartmental model with declining transmission rates to Hepatitis A seroprevalence data for Canadian-born individuals. We compare the predicted impact of universal vaccination with and without including the <b>cohort</b> <b>effect</b> in the dynamic model. Results We find that Hepatitis A transmissibility has declined {{by a factor of}} 2. 8 since the early twentieth century. When the <b>cohort</b> <b>effect</b> is not included in the model, incidence and mortality both with and without vaccination are significantly over-predicted. Incidence (respectively mortality) over a 20 year period of universal vaccination is 34 % (respectively 90 %) higher than if the <b>cohort</b> <b>effect</b> is included. The percentage reduction in incidence and mortality due to vaccination are also over-predicted when the <b>cohort</b> <b>effect</b> is not included. Similar effects are likely for many other infectious diseases where infection rates have declined significantly over past decades and where immunity is lifelong. Conclusion Failure to account for cohort effects has implications for interpreting seroprevalence data and predicting the impact of vaccination programmes with dynamic models. Cohort effects should be included in dynamic modelling studies whenever applicable. </p...|$|E

40|$|Background: Generational {{differences}} in disease rates {{are the main}} subject of age-period-cohort (APC) analysis, which is mostly applied in cancer and suicide research. This study applied APC analysis to selected neurological diseases: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson's disease (PD) and multiple sclerosis (MS). Methods: The analyses were based on Swiss mortality data. Age-stratified data has been available for MS, PD and ALS since 1901, 1921, and 1942, respectively. APC analysis was performed {{within the framework of}} logit models. Main effect models were extended by implementing nested effects, i. e. age effects nested in subperiods, in order to account for the fact that age profiles may change for reasons other than generational influences. Results: In preliminary analyses, APC analysis yielded noteworthy birth <b>cohort</b> <b>effects</b> in all three diseases. After implementing nested <b>effects,</b> the birth <b>cohort</b> <b>effects</b> disappeared in ALS, and smoothed out in PD, where they were greater for the generations born before the 1920 s.
