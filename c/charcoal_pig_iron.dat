50|$|The Marquette Iron Range was {{discovered}} in 1844 by a party of surveyors led by William A.

5|$|A {{blast furnace}} {{converts}} raw <b>iron</b> ore into <b>pig</b> <b>iron,</b> {{which can be}} remelted in a cupola furnace to produce cast iron. The earliest specimens of cast iron found in China date to the 5th century BC during the late Spring and Autumn period, yet the oldest discovered blast furnaces date to the 3rd century BCE and the majority date to the period after Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141–87 BCE) established a government monopoly over the iron industry in 117 BCE (most of the discovered iron works sites built before this date were merely foundries which recast iron that had been smelt elsewhere). Iron ore smelted in blast furnaces during the Han was rarely if ever cast directly into permanent molds; instead, the <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> scraps were remelted in the cupola furnace to make cast iron. Cupola furnaces utilized a cold blast traveling through tuyere pipes from the bottom and over the top where the charge of <b>charcoal</b> and <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> was introduced. The air traveling through the tuyere pipes thus became a hot blast once it reached {{the bottom of the}} furnace.|$|R

An extension of Veevers capability index for non-centered processes is also a subject addressed in this paper. An example of application in blast <b>charcoal</b> furnace <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> process is presented and bootstrap is used to build confidence intervals for its true capability value as well as to evaluate the performance of the capability estimators. Similar as to what is already known for univariate processes the results showed that autocorrelation has a large impact in the multivariate capabilities indices.

2500|$|One of the {{defining}} {{characteristics of the}} battlefield was a dense woodland south of the Rapidan known locally as the [...] "Wilderness of Spotsylvania". The area had once been an open broadleaf forest, but during colonial times the trees were gradually cut down to make <b>charcoal</b> for local <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> furnaces. When the supply of wood was exhausted, the furnaces were abandoned and secondary forest growth developed, creating a dense mass of brambles, thickets, vines, and low-lying vegetation. Catharine Furnace, abandoned in the 1840s, had recently been reactivated to produce iron for the Confederate war effort. This area was largely unsuitable for the deployment of artillery and the control of large infantry formations, which would nullify some of the Union advantage in military power. It was important for Hooker's plan that his men move quickly out of this area and attack Lee in the open ground to the east. There were three primary roads available for this west-to-east movement: the Orange Plank Road, the Orange Turnpike, and the River Road.|$|R

50|$|The first {{company to}} license {{the process was}} the Manchester firm of W & J Galloway, and they did so before Bessemer {{announced}} it at Cheltenham in 1856.

However, they subsequently rescinded their license in 1858 in return for the opportunity to invest in a partnership with Bessemer and others. This partnership began to manufacture steel in Sheffield from 1858, initially using imported <b>charcoal</b> <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> from Sweden. This was the first commercial production.|$|E
5000|$|The {{reasons why}} the iron {{produced}} by Darby was not used in forges to make wrought iron have been much debated. The reason may be partly that his pig iron was better for castings than <b>charcoal</b> <b>pig</b> <b>iron,</b> but the presence of silicon as an impurity made it an unattractive feedstock for finery forges. [...] However recent work has thrown doubt on this explanation, {{which is based on}} data from the 1720s when the Coalbrookdale Company operated a forge: the forge could hardly even make a profit with charcoal pit iron.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pig</b> <b>iron</b> {{can also}} be used to produce gray iron. This is {{achieved}} by remelting <b>pig</b> <b>iron,</b> often along with substantial quantities of steel and scrap iron, removing undesirable contaminants, adding alloys, and adjusting the carbon content. Some <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> grades are suitable for producing ductile iron. These are high purity <b>pig</b> <b>irons</b> and depending on the grade of ductile iron being produced these <b>pig</b> <b>irons</b> may be low in the elements silicon, manganese, sulfur and phosphorus.

25|$|As Allaire's {{business}} grew, {{he found}} {{it increasingly difficult to}} source adequate amounts of quality <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> from which to manufacture his engines.

40|$|The <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> nugget {{process was}} {{developed}} {{as an alternative}} to the traditional blast furnace process by Kobe Steel. The process aimed to produce <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> nuggets, which have similar chemical and physical properties to blast furnace <b>pig</b> <b>iron,</b> in a single step. The <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> nugget process utilizes coal instead of coke and self reducing and fluxing dried green balls instead of pellets and sinters. In this process the environmental emissions caused by coke and sinter production, and energy lost between pellet induration (heat hardening) and transportation to the blast furnace can be eliminated. The objectives of this research were to (1) produce <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> nuggets in the laboratory, (2) characterize the <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> nugget produced and compare them with blast furnace <b>pig</b> <b>iron,</b> (3) investigate the furnace temperature and residence time effects on the <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> nugget production, and (4) optimize the operational furnace temperatures and residence times. The experiments involved heat treatment of self reducing and fluxing dried green balls at various furnace temperatures and residence times. Three chemically and physically different products were produced after the compete reduction of iron oxides to iron depending on the operational furnace temperatures and/or residence times. These products were direct reduced iron (DRI), transition direct reduced <b>iron</b> (TDRI), and <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> nuggets. The increase in the carbon content of the system as a function of furnace temperature and/or residence time dictated the formation of these products. The direct reduced iron, transition direct reduced <b>iron,</b> and <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> nuggets produced were analyzed for their chemical composition, degree of metallization, apparent density, microstructure and microhardness. In addition, the change in the carbon content of the system with the changing furnace temperature and/or residence time was detected by optical microscopy and Microhardness measurements. The sufficient carbon dissolution required for the production of <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> nuggets was determined. It was determined that <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> nuggets produced had a high apparent density (6. 7 - 7. 2 gr/cm 3), highly metallized, slag free structure, high iron content (95 - 97 %), high microhardness values (> 325 HVN) and microstructure similar to white cast iron. These properties made them a competitive alternative to blast furnace <b>pig</b> <b>iron...</b>|$|R

His results prompted Bessemer to try a purer iron obtained from Cumberland hematite, but even with this he had only limited success because the quantity of carbon was difficult to control. Robert Forester Mushet, had carried out thousands of experiments at Darkhill Ironworks, in the Forest of Dean, and had shown that the quantity of carbon could be controlled by removing almost all of it from the iron and then adding an exact amount of carbon and manganese, in the form of spiegeleisen. This improved the quality of the finished product and increased its malleability.|$|E

50|$|Traditionally, <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> was {{worked into}} wrought iron in finery forges, later {{puddling}} furnaces, {{and more recently}} into steel.

50|$|<b>Pig</b> <b>iron</b> is an {{intermediate}} {{product of the}} <b>iron</b> industry. <b>Pig</b> <b>iron</b> has a very high carbon content, typically 3.5-4.5%, along with silica and other constituents of dross, which makes it very brittle, and not useful directly as a material except for limited applications. <b>Pig</b> <b>iron</b> is made by smelting iron ore into a transportable ingot of impure high carbon-content iron in a blast furnace as an ingredient for further processing steps. The traditional shape of the molds used for <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> ingots was a branching structure formed in sand, with many individual ingots {{at right angles to}} a central channel or runner, resembling a litter of piglets being suckled by a sow. When the metal had cooled and hardened, the smaller ingots (the pigs) were simply broken from the runner (the sow), hence the name <b>pig</b> <b>iron.</b> As <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> is intended for remelting, the uneven size of the ingots and the inclusion of small amounts of sand caused only insignificant problems considering the ease of casting and handling them.|$|R
