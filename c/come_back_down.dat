5|$|On 2 July 2015, Queen Mary 2 began a 175th Anniversary Crossing in Southampton. She sailed {{first to}} Liverpool, leaving that city after a {{fireworks}} display on 4 July, the actual anniversary date of Cunard's first transatlantic voyage. Queen Mary 2 followed {{the route of}} the original ship Britannia, calling first at Halifax, Nova Scotia. After a day there, she headed first upriver into the harbor, using her bow thrusters and swivel-pod motors to negotiate the tight turnaround to <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>down</b> close to the cityfront. A 21-gun salute and bagpipe band honored the ship.|$|E
5|$|The {{approach}} to Battle Mountain and P'il-bong {{was much more}} difficult from the east, the American-held side, than from the west, the North Korean side. On the east side there was no road climbing halfway to the top; {{from the base of}} the mountain at the edge of the Haman valley the only way to make the ascent was by foot trail. Climbers took two to three hours to reach the top of P'il-bong from the reservoir area, and required from three to four hours to get on top of Battle Mountain from the valley floor. The turnaround time for supply trains to Battle Mountain was six hours. Often a dispatch runner required eight hours to go up Battle Mountain and <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>down.</b> In some places the trail was so steep that climbers had to set up ropes to hold along the side of the trail. North Korean night patrols constantly cut telephone lines. The wire men had a difficult and dangerous job trying to maintain wire communication with units on the mountain. Food, water and ammunition were frequently short for the units at the tops of the peaks.|$|E
2500|$|Occasionally, {{the fights}} {{themselves}} would {{be where the}} scorned guest {{would be on the}} catwalk above the stage where they would throw things, like eggs or other foods, at the target of their wrath. [...] Once finished there, the guest would <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>down</b> to the stage, where the usual brawling would commence.|$|E
50|$|Claimed {{top speed}} <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>down</b> to 100 km/h (62 mph) with the “flat-lands” final-drive ratio and 95 km/h (59 mph) {{with the back}} axle {{configured}} for mountainous areas.|$|R

2500|$|In September 1977, California assemblyman Willie Brown {{served as}} {{master of ceremonies}} at a large {{testimonial}} dinner for Jones attended by Governor Jerry Brown and Lieutenant Governor Mervyn Dymally. At that dinner, Brown touted Jones as [...] "what you should see every day when {{you look in the}} mirror in the early morning hours... a combination of Martin Luther King, Jr., Angela Davis, Albert Einstein... Chairman Mao". Harvey Milk, who spoke at political rallies at the Temple, wrote to Jones after one such visit: [...] "Rev Jim, It may take me many a day to <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>down</b> from the high that I reach today. I found something dear today. I found a sense of being that makes up for all the hours and energy placed in a fight. I found what you wanted me to find. I shall be back. For I can never leave." ...|$|E

When I <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>down</b> t'lane again, Orphus 'e was {{vanished}} away; {{there was}} naught {{in the field}} but the ponies, an' a praaper old magpie, a-top o' the hedge.

60|$|He did {{not move}} {{for the next few}} moments, but his brain was busy. Graham might have <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>down</b> the north road in his car and {{afterwards}} taken to the moors, but it was difficult to understand how he had found Foster's track. Chance, however, sometimes favored one in a curious way; the fellow might have found out that he had left the road and expected him to stop the night in Bewcastle dale. Since Foster had Pete with him, he was not, in one sense, afraid of Graham. Although the fellow was, no doubt, dangerous, he was not likely to force an equal fight. The risk would come if Graham found him alone and at a disadvantage, when Foster thought it would go hard with him. This was why he could not have the men on his track, watching for the right moment to strike. It was, however, possible that the strangers were police, and he lay in the heath with knitted brows until Pete touched him.|$|E
50|$|Kahne {{held off}} Keselowski's charge into Turn 1 on the restart with seven to go. When the field <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>down</b> the front stretch, Kyle Larson slammed the outside wall, {{bringing}} out the 11th caution.|$|R
50|$|The first caution of {{the race}} flew on lap 30 for debris on the backstretch. Denny Hamlin exited pit road in fourth, but <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>down</b> for a flat right-rear tire. David Gilliland stayed out to lead a lap before pitting.|$|R
50|$|The term hammer blow {{does not}} {{describe}} what takes place very well since the force varies continuously {{and only in}} extreme cases when the wheel lifts from the rail for an instant is there a true blow when it <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> <b>down.</b>|$|R

50|$|Highmarking or High-Marking is {{a popular}} {{activity}} performed by snowmobilers in mountainous terrain, where the snowmobile operator tries to ride as far up a steep mountain slope as possible, {{then turn around and}} <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>down</b> the hill without getting stuck, rolling the snowmobile or losing power.|$|E
50|$|The race {{restarted}} with 80 to go. Gray Gaulding lost {{an engine}} in Turn 4, {{bringing out the}} fourth caution with 63 to go. Keselowski exited pit road first, but <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>down</b> pit road for a loose wheel, related to unsecure lug nuts, and Harvick assumed the lead once more.|$|R
50|$|After leaving Cambridge United, Murtagh {{spent the}} 2012-13 season at Macclesfield Town {{before moving on}} to play for League two side Mansfield Town.

They were quickly on their journey again, and a scanty hour before noon they arrived at Tecumseh.|$|R

5000|$|The {{use of the}} {{fortress}} as a prison {{is responsible for the}} fact that Hohenasperg is jokingly referred to as [...] "Württemberg's highest mountain" [...] as they say [...] "it takes only five minutes to come to the top, but years to <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>down</b> again." ...|$|E
50|$|Gros Piton can be climbed without ropes or {{mountaineering}} experience. One can hike to {{the summit}} and <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>down</b> to the sea-level within a few hours.

50|$|Effectively, the {{institutional}} investor's large order has given {{an option to}} the professional investor. Institutional investors don't like this, because either the stock price rises to $9.99 and <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> <b>down,</b> without them having the opportunity to sell, or the stock price rises to $10.00 and keeps going up, meaning {{the institutional}} investor could have sold at a higher price.|$|R
50|$|An Old School Hand plant {{trick in}} which one holds the board in one hand, does a One Handed Handstand, puts the board under the feet, then <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> <b>down.</b> It {{is used as a}} fancy way to get onto one's board.

50|$|The #98 Chevrolet of Jimmy Spencer had a {{spectacular}} crash late in race on the backstretch. After contact {{in the middle}} of the backstretch from the #16 Ford of Wally Dallenbach, Jr., the #98 spun and became airborne (almost completely vertical). Luckily, the car <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>down</b> on all 4 wheels without flipping over. However, the suspension broke in the car as a result of the landing.|$|R
50|$|After an {{exchange}} of punts in overtime, the Chargers drove to the Jets 22-yard line, but Kaeding missed a 40-yard field goal attempt late in the extra period, allowing the Jets to <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>down</b> the field. Two Pennington completions for 29 yards and a 19-yard run by LaMont Jordan then set up a 28-yard field goal from Brien with five seconds remaining in overtime.|$|E
5000|$|Stock XYZ {{rises in}} price to $9.99 {{and then comes}} back down. The {{professional}} investor sells at $9.99 and covers his short position when the stock declines. The professional investor can gain $.10 or more per share with very little risk. The institutional investor is unhappy, because he saw the market price rise to $9.99 and <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>down,</b> without his order getting filled.|$|E
50|$|While {{trying to}} enter pit road with 49 laps to go, Brian Vickers spun {{out and about}} blocked the entrance. He was almost rammed by Marcos Ambrose {{trying to get his}} car facing the right direction. He did get it going the right direction, but had to <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>down</b> pit road to serve a drive-through penalty not passing {{to the inside of the}} pit road {{commitment}} line.|$|E
60|$|Turning, Pill <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>down</b> the aisle; as he {{came the}} half-risen {{congregation}} made way for him, curiously. When he came within reach of Dick, the fellow struck savagely out at the preacher, only to have his blow avoided by a lithe, lightning-swift movement of the body above the hips (a trained boxer's trick), and to find himself also lying bruised and dazed on the floor.|$|R
50|$|Unemployment dropped during Daniels' {{first years}} as governor, {{increased}} during the 2008 recession, and gradually <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>down</b> {{in the following}} years. Daniels {{was able to make}} progress on his clean energy agenda during his early years in office with support from the Democrats in the General Assembly. Indiana subsequently became one of the leading states in biofuel production with 15 plants, including the world's largest soybean bio-diesel plant.|$|R
5000|$|Due to the boycott's {{successful}} tactics, on May 22, the Retail Butchers Association (the kosher butchers association) realigned {{itself with}} the boycott campaign and ceased selling kosher meat in all their stores. In addition, kosher restaurants throughout NYC removed meat from their menus until the prices <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>down.</b> By May 27, major Orthodox religious leaders had publicly affirmed support for the boycott, and by June 9 the prices dropped to 14 cents a pound.|$|R
5000|$|Chip: Also {{known as}} the lob, this shot focuses on getting the ball to {{a certain amount of}} {{vertical}} height, where the goalkeeper can't reach it and then have it <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>down</b> again into goal, it takes a certain amount of technique and precision to do and players such as Raúl González, Cristiano Ronaldo, Roberto Baggio, Romário, Francesco Totti, Alessandro Del Piero and Lionel Messi have made it trademark moves.|$|E

Her voice-over tells us that she continued diving for eleven more years with the audience never learning of her blindness, and about her happy marriage to Al.|$|E
50|$|Unlike in Europe, {{war ended}} very {{unexpectedly}} in the Far East. The dropping {{of the atomic}} bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, combined with the American blockade of Japan, and the Soviet entry into the war on 9 August 1945 finally shocked the Japanese into suing for peace. Once peace came, {{there was a period}} of euphoria within the RAF units, but the forces in the region <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>down</b> to earth with a bump a few days later.|$|R
50|$|As Bugs rushes upstairs, {{the manager}} {{gets into the}} elevator, where Bugs (in {{disguise}} again) brings him down. Just as the manager gets wise after exiting, Bugs tricks him into getting aboard another elevator going up, where the manager sees multiple Bugs's thumbing lifts on the elevator on each floor. Just as he <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> <b>down,</b> Bugs shoves the manager out of the elevator, making the manager rush up hundreds of flights of stairs {{to the top of}} the building.|$|R
