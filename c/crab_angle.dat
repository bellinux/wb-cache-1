25|$|Landing {{the runway}} 13 {{approach}} was already difficult with normal crosswinds since {{even if the}} wind direction was constant, it was changing relative to the aircraft during the 47° visual right turn. The landing would become even more challenging when crosswinds from the northeast were strong and gusty during typhoons. The mountain range northeast of the airport also makes wind vary greatly in both speed and direction. From a spectator's point of view, watching large aircraft banking at low altitudes and taking big <b>crab</b> <b>angles</b> during their final approaches was quite thrilling. Despite the difficulty, the runway 13 approach was nonetheless used {{most of the time}} due to the prevailing wind direction in Hong Kong.|$|R

40|$|The {{luminosity}} of Compton x-ray and γ sources {{depends on}} the average current in electron bunches, {{the energy of the}} laser pulses, and the geometry of the particle bunch to laser pulse collisions. To obtain high power photon pulses, these can be stacked in a passive optical resonator (Fabry-Perot cavity) especially when a high average flux is required. But, in this case, owing to the presence of the optical cavity mirrors, the electron bunches have to collide at an angle with the laser pulses with a consequent luminosity decrease. In this article a crab-crossing scheme is proposed for Compton sources, based on a laser amplified in a Fabry-Perot resonator, to eliminate the luminosity losses given by the crossing angle, taking into account that in laser-electron collisions only the electron bunches can be tilted at the collision point. We report the analytical study on the crab-crossing scheme for Compton gamma sources. The analytical expression for the total yield of photons generated in Compton sources with the crab-crossing scheme of collision is derived. The optimal collision angle of the bunch was found to be equal to half of the collision <b>angle.</b> At this <b>crabbing</b> <b>angle,</b> the maximal yield of scattered off laser photons is attained thanks to the maximization, in the collision process, of the time spent by the laser pulse in the electron bunch. Estimations for some Compton source projects are presented. Furthermore, some schemes of the optical cavities configuration are analyzed and the luminosity calculated. As illustrated, the four-mirror two- or three-dimensional scheme is the most appropriate for Compton sources...|$|R

Crab cavities ensure head-on collisions and recover the geometric luminosity loss from {{the presence of a}} finite crossing angle at the interaction point (IP). An R&D program is underway to design and fabricate superconducting RF (SRF) prototype cavity at 800 MHz to test several SRF limits in the deflecting mode.

40|$|The high {{false alarm}} {{associated}} with conventional along-track interferometric {{synthetic aperture radar}} (ATI-SAR) is a big concern for any valuable military radar. To reduce the false alarm rate, this paper proposes a dual-threshold approach that combines the conventional interferometric phase detection with the SAR image amplitude detection. This yields two results: (1) the interferometric phase map (including target velocity information) obtained by applying the interferometric phase detection only to the pixels selected by the amplitude detection, and (2) the amplitude map (including target strength information) obtained by applying the amplitude detection only to the pixels selected by the interferometric phase detection. The concept {{is illustrated by the}} results obtained using the Jet Propulsion Laboratory’s (JPL) AirSAR ATI data, collected in the Monterey Bay area, California.

40|$|The {{prediction}} of vibration amplitude and {{sound pressure level}} of wheel squeal noise is investigated using a concise mathematical model that is verified with measurements from both a rolling contact two disk test rig and a field case study. The model is used to perform an energy-based analysis to determine a closed form solution to the steady state limit cycle amplitude of creep and vibration oscillations during squealing. The analytical solution compares well with a numerical solution using an experimentally tuned creep curve with full nonlinear shape. The predicted squeal sound level trend also compares well with that recorded at various crabbing velocities (proportional to angle of attack) for the test rig at different rolling speeds. In addition, further verification is performed against many field recordings of wheel squeal on a sharp curve of 300 m. A comparison with a simplified modified result from Rudd [1] is also provided and highlights the accuracy and advantages of the present efficient model. The analytical solution provides insight into why the sound pressure level of squeal noise increases with <b>crabbing</b> velocity (or <b>angle</b> of attack) {{as well as how}} the amplitude is affected by the critical squeal parameters including a detailed investigation of modal damping. Finally, the efficient model is used to perform a parametric investigation into means of achieving a 6 dB decrease in squeal noise. The results highlight the primary importance of <b>crabbing</b> velocity (and <b>angle</b> of attack) as well as the creep curve parameters that may be controlled using third body control (ie friction modifiers). The results concur with experimental and field observations and provide important theoretical insight into the useful mechanisms of mitigating wheel squeal and quantifying their relative merits...|$|R

40|$|In an electron-positron {{machine in}} which the beams cross at an angle, the {{characteristics}} of head on collisions can be preserved by tilting the bunches[1 t 2 * 31. The <b>crab</b> <b>angle</b> is created by driving head and tail in opposite directions at a location of zero dispersion or by introducing a head tail energy difference at a location of finite dispersion[4].

This locus is a curve in the 4 D space of the Doppler frequency and the 3 spatial frequencies. This generalization is valid for both monostatic and bistatic radar configurations. We show that the customary clutter power spectrum locus representation in the 2 D space of the Doppler frequency and the single spatial frequency used when considering linear arrays is a projection of the 4 D curve. This projection property furthermore provides a very simple interpretation of the evolution of the 2 D clutter power spectrum locus in function of the <b>crab</b> <b>angle</b> (angle between the antenna reference direction and the platform velocity vector) ...|$|E
40|$|A {{dynamic model}} {{was used to}} {{directly}} compare four different crosswind landing gear mechanisms.

The configuration in which the landing gears are alined by the pilot and locked {{in the direction of}} motion prior to touchdown gave the smoothest runout behavior with the vehicle maintaining its <b>crab</b> <b>angle</b> throughout the landing roll.

The attractive feature is that, despite of sliding phenomena, both lateral and angular deviations can be explicitly controlled with respect to the path to be followed.

On the contrary, in order to reduce soil compaction generally caused by the load of several wheels in the same track, the path following can be carried out with a chosen <b>crab</b> <b>angle.</b> Relying on a kinematic model extended with sliding parameters, a backstepping control approach is considered.

40|$|Abstract A Space-Based Radar (SBR) is a reconnaissance, surveillance, and tar-get {{acquisition}} system capable of supporting {{a wide variety}} of joint mis-sions and tasks simultaneously, including battle management, command and control, target detection and tracking, wide area surveillance and attack operations. SBR also supports traditional intelligence, surveil-lance and reconnaissance missions such as indications, warning, and assessment. These mission areas cover the strategic, operational, and tactical levels of operations of interest. SBR systems are also used for earth science projects. However, an SBR system, by virtue of its mo-tion, generates a Doppler frequency component to the clutter return from any point on the earth {{as a function of the}} SBR-earth geometry. The effect of earth’s rotation around its own axis is shown to add an additional component to this Doppler frequency. The overall effect of the earth’s rotation on the Doppler turns out to be two correction fac-tors in terms of a <b>crab</b> <b>angle</b> affecting the azimuth angle, and a crab magnitude scaling the Doppler magnitude of the clutter patch. Inter-estingly both factors depend only on the SBR orbit inclination and its latitude and not on the specific location of the clutter patch of interest. It is also shown that earth’s rotation together with the range foldover phenomenon inherent in such systems; significantly degrade the clut- 2 ter suppression performance of adaptive processing algorithms. In this chapter, we provide analytical derivations of these phenomena and their impact on performance, and suggested ways to remedy for these effects are shown through computer simulations...|$|E
40|$|Several crosswind-related {{incidents}} {{show that}} landing under heavy crosswind conditions {{can be challenging}} for pilots and may {{pose a threat to}} aviation or at least lead to higher pilot workload and/or irregularities in operations. For transport aircraft the common approach technique for crosswind landings is the so-called crabbed approach with wings level and a windward heading correction. This technique requires alignment of the aircraft with the runway prior to touchdown in order to keep lateral loads of the landing gear and tyres as low as possible and to maintain the controllability on ground after touchdown. The German Aerospace Center Institute of Flight Systems has used the idea of steerable main gears and developed a crosswind landing assistance system. During approach all gear struts are automatically aligned with the runway so that no decrab manoeuvre is required. On ground the assistance system uses each steerable landing gear, differential braking, and the aerodynamic control surfaces to control and stabilise the aircraft. After touchdown the aircraft is automatically aligned with the runway centreline and the still existing <b>crab</b> <b>angle</b> is slowly reduced. A simulator study with pilots in the loop using a model of a typical medium range transport aircraft was conducted in order to evaluate the benefits of such a landing technique. The study revealed that not only the aircraft controllability could be improved by landing in crabbed motion under strong crosswind conditions, but that the side forces acting on the landing gear can be reduced significantly as well. It was also shown that the use of steerable main landing gears is able to enlarge the spectrum of autoland operations, which is relatively limited at present in terms of maximum allowable crosswinds. All together the system has shown to be able to improve flight safety, lower the risk of weatherrelated delays due to go-arounds or diversions, and it also reduces structural loads on the landing gear during touchdown and landing...|$|E
