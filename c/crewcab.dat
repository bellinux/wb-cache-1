5000|$|UAZ-39094 - <b>crewcab</b> {{pickup truck}} with a 10 cm metal {{platform}} with a wooden floor equipped with a removable frame tent and awning, 3 dropsides. Cargo bed replaceable by utility and special service bodies.|$|E
5000|$|Holden {{introduced}} the TF series into Australia in 1988, branded as the Holden Rodeo, following {{on from the}} name of the previous Isuzu based light truck sold by the brand in Australia. The Holden Rodeo was initially available with a 2.6-liter [...] inline-four. A 2.8-liter [...] turbodiesel was introduced soon after. Body styles offered were a two-door single cab, a two-door SpaceCab, with space for two small jump-seats (rarely if ever fitted in Australia) behind the front passengers, and a four-door <b>Crewcab,</b> with space for the driver and four passengers. Several trim levels were available, which included DX (base model), LX (mid-range RWD, top of 4WD range) and LT (top of range, only available as a RWD petrol <b>Crewcab).</b>|$|E
50|$|The range now {{went from}} 2.6 to 4.6 tons gross vehicle weight, and the {{enclosed}} options {{of the panel}} van and compact were available in three wheelbase options. Platform vehicles, <b>crewcabs</b> and numerous undercarriage options completed the range. A special articulated version of the second generation LT, the XLT was available through special order.|$|R
50|$|Some {{vehicles}} are fitted with luxurious multi-seat passenger compartments called <b>crewcabs.</b> These often have DVD players and even drink machines, {{for the benefit}} of the casualty's occupants on their trip home. Different types of rotatable cranes are sometimes fitted for lifting vehicles out of ditches, etc. Heavy lifting cranes are sometimes fitted and can be used for example to winch overturned vehicles back on their wheels.|$|R
50|$|When deploying, CA-TF1 {{can move}} its {{equipment}} {{in one of}} two ways. The first is to load the cache onto a military pallet for shipment via air. The second is over land via two 40-foot (12 m) semi-trailer trucks and a 24-foot (7 m) <b>crewcab</b> box van owned by the Task Force.|$|E
50|$|Controversies also hounded 9TV {{as one of}} the motorpool {{drivers of}} the news {{division}} allegedly violated traffic rules after the news <b>crewcab</b> was entered a no-left/no-entry road (counterflow) while on hazard in the Balara area last September 14, 2014. 9News management then imposed a disciplinary actions and penalties against the driver and his designated reporter and cameraman.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike the Dodge Ram Wagon and Ford Econoline vans {{which had}} a welded-on body extension, a 146 in {{extended}} wheelbase [...] was introduced (about the same length as a Chevrolet/GMC <b>crewcab</b> truck). This was done to accommodate an extra bench seat, finally giving GM a 15-passenger van. GM was the last American automaker to produce such a van, with Dodge introducing the genre in 1971 and Ford joining them in 1978.|$|E
50|$|VW {{imported}} {{the short}} wheelbase Eurovan 5-cylinder gas engine passenger models (CL, GL, GLS, MV Weekender and Westfalia Camperised) to Canada from 1991 to 1996. The 77 hp 2,4L diesel engine was optional in Canada between 1993 and 1996. The long wheelbase version {{was also on}} offer in 1992 only as a 10 seaters CL or GL model trim. Combi and <b>crewcab</b> pick-up versions (sold as Transporter) were also available in 1992. A panel version (long wb only) was sold from 1993 to 1997.|$|E
50|$|One of the company's {{light-duty}} vehicles was the Travelall, {{which was}} similar in concept to the Chevrolet Suburban. The Travelette was a crew cab, available {{in two or}} four-wheel drive. A three-door version was available starting in 1957, and a four-door version was available starting in 1961. The 1961 Travelette four-door (<b>crewcab)</b> was the first six-passenger, four-door truck of its time. The Scout, first introduced in 1961, is a small, two-door SUV, similar to a Jeep. In 1972, the Scout became the Scout II, and in 1974 Dana 44 axles, power steering, and power disc brakes became standard. After the Light Line pickups and Travelall were discontinued in 1975, the Scout Traveler and Terra became available, both with a longer wheelbase than a standard Scout II.|$|E
5000|$|The facelifted 1997 (1998 model year) Holden Rodeo {{came with}} a new trim level, LT Sport, {{available}} as a four-wheel <b>Crewcab</b> only. Airbags for the driver and front passenger also became an option. By 1998 the 2.6-liter engine was discontinued and a new engine was offered, a 3.2-liter [...] V6. This engine was available in both rear- and four-wheel-drive. The rear-wheel drive version had the same chassis, and thus ride-height as the four-wheel-drive, but without the transfer case and front axle. The 3.2-liter V6 was the most powerful engine in a pickup truck in Australia until it was replaced in 2003 by the new look Rodeo based on the Isuzu D-Max. Accordingly, this engine {{was the most popular}} engine in the Rodeo, and the Rodeo sold very well overall, nearing the sales numbers of the Toyota Hilux, traditionally the best-selling commercial vehicle in Australia.|$|E
