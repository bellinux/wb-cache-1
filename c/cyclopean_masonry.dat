60|$|Strange {{as these}} Virgin Isles had looked when {{seen from the}} south, outside, and at the {{distance}} of a few miles, they looked still more strange when we were fairly threading our way between them, sometimes not a rifle-shot from the cliffs, with the white coral banks gleaming under our keel. Had they ever carried a tropic vegetation? Had the hills of Tortola and Virgin Gorda, in shape and size much like those which surround a sea-loch in the Western Islands, ever been furred with forests like those of Guadaloupe or St. Lucia? The loftier were now mere mounds of almost barren earth; the lower were often, like 'Fallen Jerusalem,' mere long earthless moles, as of minute <b>Cyclopean</b> <b>masonry.</b> But what had destroyed their vegetation, if it ever existed? Were they not, too, the mere remnants of a submerged and destroyed land, connected now only by the coral shoals? So it seemed to us, as we ran out past the magnificent harbour {{at the back of}} Virgin Gorda, where, in the old war times, the merchantmen of all the West Indies used to collect, to be conveyed homeward by the naval squadron, and across a shallow sea white with coral beds. We passed to leeward of the island, or rather reef, of Anegada, so low that it could only be discerned, at a few miles' distance, by the breaking surf and a few bushes; and then plunged, as it were, suddenly out of shallow white water into deep azure ocean. An upheaval of only forty fathoms would, I believe, join all these islands to each other, and to the great mountain island of Porto Rico to the west. The same upheaval would connect with each other Anguilla, St. Martin, and St. Bartholomew, to the east. But Santa Cruz, though so near St. Thomas's, and the Virgin Gordas to the south, would still be parted from them by a gulf nearly two thousand fathoms deep--a gulf which marks still, probably, the separation of two ancient continents, or at least two archipelagoes.|$|E

50|$|<b>Cyclopean</b> <b>masonry</b> {{is a type}} of {{stonework}} {{found in}} Mycenaean architecture, built with massive limestone boulders, roughly fitted together with minimal clearance between adjacent stones and no use of mortar. The boulders typically seem unworked, but some may have been worked roughly with a hammer and the gaps between boulders filled in with smaller chunks of limestone.|$|E
50|$|In {{the sixth}} century BCE a cult of Athena Nike was {{established}} and a small temple was built using Mycenaean fortification and <b>Cyclopean</b> <b>masonry.</b> After the temple was demolished by the Persians in 480 BCE a new temple was built over the remains.

50|$|The {{most famous}} {{examples}} of <b>Cyclopean</b> <b>masonry</b> {{are found in}} the walls of Mycenae and Tiryns, and the style is characteristic of Mycenaean fortifications.

50|$|The ancient chief town of the Aurunci, is {{believed}} to have lain over 600 m above the level of the sea, on the narrow south-western edge of the extinct crater of Roccamonfina. Here some remains of <b>Cyclopean</b> <b>masonry</b> exist; but the area enclosed, about 100 by 50 m, is too small for anything but a detached fort. It dates more probably from a time prior to Roman supremacy.|$|E
50|$|The first {{organized}} Hyborian kingdom {{to emerge}} was Hyperborea. The tribe that established it entered their Neolithic age by learning to erect buildings in stone, largely for fortification. These nomads lived in tents {{made out of}} the hides of horses, but soon abandoned them in favor of their first crude but durable stone houses. They permanently settled in fortified settlements and developed <b>cyclopean</b> <b>masonry</b> to further fortify their defensive walls.|$|E
50|$|Eastern Biniac naveta has a {{circular}} layout with a es de plant{{a circular}}, with the outer wall battering inwards. This wall has horizontal stone locks {{placed in a}} horizontal position, following the <b>cyclopean</b> <b>masonry</b> technique, {{which can be found}} in many other prehistoric buildings in Minorca. The building's entrance is located at the southern side. A wall was built in an indeterminate period, which abuts the southern side of the naveta, partially covering it.|$|E
5000|$|Pausanias {{described}} the Cyclopean walls of Mycenae and Tiryns: There still remain, however, {{parts of the}} city wall Mycenae, including the gate, upon which stand lions. These, too, are said to be the work of the Cyclopes, who made for Proetus the wall at Tiryns. (2.16.5) Going on from here and turning to the right, you come to the ruins of Tiryns. ... The wall, which is {{the only part of the}} ruins still remaining, is a work of the Cyclopes made of unwrought stones, each stone being so big that a pair of mules could not move the smallest from its place to the slightest degree. Long ago small stones were so inserted that each of them binds the large blocks firmly together.(2.25.8) Modern archaeologists use [...] "Cyclopean" [...] in a more restricted sense than the description by Pausanias; while Pausanias attributes all of the fortifications of Tiryns and Mycenae, including the Lion Gate, to the Cyclopes, only parts of these walls are built in <b>Cyclopean</b> <b>masonry.</b> The photograph above shows the difference between <b>Cyclopean</b> <b>masonry</b> (shown in the blue rectangle), and the ashlar masonry of the Lion Gate.|$|E
50|$|Some {{ruins of}} walls built in {{polygonal}} masonry (also {{referred to as}} <b>cyclopean</b> <b>masonry)</b> {{can also be seen}} in the districts of Civitalta, Curino, and S. Nicola, with some columns and ruins of a temple brought to life by excavations. The village boasts an ancient tradition in the crafts of stone carving. The last craftsmen made the artistic paving of the town unique to its genre. In the historical center, people can admire the octagonal castle of the Simone’s feud, Count of Sangro.|$|E
5000|$|Towards {{the end of}} the {{republic}} it was a praefectura, and under the empire it appears as a colony (perhaps founded by the triumvirs), though in two (not local) inscriptions it is called municipium. Strabo speaks of it as an important town; Varro mentions the olive oil of its district as especially good. The older Volscian Casinum must have stood on the hill (1,715 ft) above the Roman town (148 ft), where considerable remains of fortifications in <b>Cyclopean</b> <b>masonry,</b> of finely cut blocks of limestone, still exist.|$|E
50|$|On {{the summit}} of the hill at 753 m, nearly 1 mi from the town, stood the ancient citadel, the site of which is now {{occupied}} by a few poor houses (Castel San Pietro) and a ruined medieval castle of the Colonna family. The view embraces the Monte Soratte, Rome, the Alban Hills, and the Pontinian Plain as far as the sea. Considerable portions of the southern wall of the ancient citadel, built in massive <b>cyclopean</b> <b>masonry</b> consisting of limestone blocks, are still visible; and the two walls, also polygonal, which formerly united the citadel with the town, can still be traced.|$|E
50|$|The {{remains of}} {{fortress}} walls, towers and ancient buildings were found during the excavations on Nebet Tepe. The oldest {{part of the}} fortress on the hill was built with large syenite blocks roughly fitted together with minimal clearance between adjacent stones and no use of mortar, typical for the <b>cyclopean</b> <b>masonry.</b> The remains of the Western wall with the imposing quadrangular tower and its entrance are evidence of the Hellenistic period when the ancient town expanded and the fortress on Nebet Tepe became the citadel of the town's acropolis. There are also thick stone walls from latter periods and other ancient buildings.|$|E
50|$|The {{walls are}} built of {{medium-sized}} limestone blocks, {{mostly in the}} <b>Cyclopean</b> <b>masonry</b> technique (ashlar masonry is employed {{at some of the}} gates). They have a total length of 2.8 km, are up to 6.75m wide and 3-5m high. In many locations they are built directly on the cliffs that form the limit of the outcrop. It had four gates, an unusually high number for a Mycenaean fortification, in the north, west, south and southeast. Elaborate built ramps led to the gates. The fortification can be dated to early LH III B, that is, circa 1300 BC.|$|E
50|$|Vardenis {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} {{settlements}} in Armenia. The town and its vicinities are rich in cultural heritage with 568 monuments recorded. The most interesting are Makenats monastery, the basilica in Sotk, the chapels of Ayrk, Karchaghbyur, as well as numerous other chapels, the tombs of 3rd-1st millennia BC, the <b>Cyclopean</b> <b>masonry,</b> and the medieval khachkars (cross-stones). In the centre of Vardenis, there is the Church of Surp Astvatsatsin (Holy Mother of God), built in 1905, where the Armenian historian Hovhannes Tsaretsi worked. The church is surrounded with numerous khachkars dating back to the 14th and the 17th centuries.|$|E
5000|$|These contentions are categorically {{rejected}} by mainstream archeology. Some mainstream archeologists {{have participated in}} experiments to move large megaliths. These experiments have succeeded in moving megaliths up to at least 40 tons, and they have speculated that with a larger workforce larger megaliths could be towed {{with the use of}} known ancient technology. Such allegations are not unique in history, however, as similar reasoning lay behind the wonder of the <b>Cyclopean</b> <b>masonry</b> walling at Mycenaean cities in the eyes of Greeks of the following [...] "Greek Dark Ages", who believed that the giant Cyclops had built the walls.|$|E
50|$|A {{series of}} {{kidney-shaped}} chambers {{clustered around the}} south side of the original talaiot has been excavated. There are indications of other buildings in an elliptical central area measuring roughly 65m × 55m around the talaiot, and others within the massive outer wall of the settlement, also roughly elliptical, which measures some 140m × 105m. Built sometime between 650-540BC, long after the central talaiot and many of its surrounding buildings, this thick wall of <b>cyclopean</b> <b>masonry</b> consists of a base row of huge outer boulders, some weighing around 8 tonnes, with smaller ones (mostly now scattered) above them; it is faced on the inside with rows of smaller rocks.|$|E
50|$|Baroness von Werther, {{the owner}} of Oberau Castle, built the {{building}} and operated it at first as an inn. The half-timbered building was given a wood sheathing in 1862 and it was plastered {{with the appearance of}} <b>Cyclopean</b> <b>masonry</b> 15 years later. Also in 1877, the premises of the officials’ apartments were renovated and a station restaurant was built in the new rooms. Subsequently the building was used both for residential and station purposes. To emphasize the latter function, it received a station clock and the station sign that broke up the previously empty space on the building’s gable during a reorganisation in 1988.|$|E
5000|$|R'lyeh is {{characterized}} by bizarre architecture likened to non-Euclidean geometry. Norwegian sailor Gustaf Johansen, the narrator {{of one of the}} tales in the short story, describes the accidental discovery of the city: [...] "a coast-line of mingled mud, ooze, and weedy <b>Cyclopean</b> <b>masonry</b> which can be nothing less than the tangible substance of earth's supreme terror—the nightmare corpse-city of R'lyeh...loathsomely redolent of spheres and dimensions apart from ours". The short story also asserts the premise that while currently trapped in R'lyeh, Cthulhu will eventually return, with worshipers often repeating the phrase Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn: [...] "In his house at R'lyeh, dead Cthulhu waits dreaming".|$|E
50|$|It was {{captured}} by the Romans in 293 BC. The position of the original town is on the mountain far above the Roman town, and remains of its walls in <b>Cyclopean</b> <b>masonry</b> still exist. The city walls (in opus reticulatum) of the Roman town were erected by Tiberius before he became emperor, the date (between 2 BC and 4 AD) being given by an inscription. Within the city walls are remains of a theatre and other buildings, including temples of Jupiter and Apollo. There still exists, by the gate leading to Bovianum, an important inscription of about 168 AD, relating to the tratture (see Apulia) in Roman days, forbidding the natives to harm the shepherds who passed along them.|$|E
