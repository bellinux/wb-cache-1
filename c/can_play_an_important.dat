The completeness of fossils, and nature of damage, can thus be used to constrain the tectonic history of regions.|$|E

25|$|In February 2013 a {{study found}} common genetic links between five major {{psychiatric}} disorders: autism, ADHD, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and schizophrenia. Abnormal functioning of neurotransmitter systems has {{been implicated in}} several mental disorders, including serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine and glutamate systems. Differences have also {{been found in the}} size or activity of certain brain regions in some cases. Psychological mechanisms have also been implicated, such as cognitive (e.g. reasoning) biases, emotional influences, personality dynamics, temperament and coping style. Studies have indicated that variation in genes <b>can</b> <b>play</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> {{role in the development of}} mental disorders, although the reliable identification of connections between specific genes and specific categories of disorder has proven more difficult. Environmental events surrounding pregnancy and birth have also been implicated. Traumatic brain injury may increase the risk of developing certain mental disorders. There have been some tentative inconsistent links found to certain viral infections, to substance misuse, and to general physical health.|$|E
500|$|While {{international}} trade in greenhouse gas reductions holds substantial promise {{as a source of}} new funding for sustainable development, this market can be largely inaccessible to many smaller-scale projects, remote communities, and least developed localities. [...] To facilitate participation and broaden the benefits, several barriers must be overcome, including: a lack of market awareness among stakeholders and prospective participants; specialized, somewhat complicated participation rules; and the need for simplified participation mechanisms for small projects, without which transaction costs can overwhelm the financial benefits of participation. If the barriers are adequately addressed, greenhouse gas trading <b>can</b> <b>play</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> role supporting activities that benefit people’s lives and the environment.|$|E

2500|$|The {{principal}} {{idea behind}} LES {{is to reduce}} the computational cost by ignoring the smallest length scales, which are the most computationally expensive to resolve, via low-pass filtering of the Navier–Stokes equations. [...] Such a low-pass filtering, which {{can be viewed as a}} time- and spatial-averaging, effectively removes small-scale information from the numerical solution. [...] This information is not irrelevant, however, and its effect on the flow field must be modeled, a task which is an active area of research for problems in which small-scales <b>can</b> <b>play</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> role, such as near-wall flows ...|$|E
2500|$|The chassis, frame, or basket, is {{designed}} to be rigid, avoiding deformation that could change critical alignments with the magnet gap, perhaps causing the voice coil to rub against the sides of the gap. Chassis are typically cast from aluminum alloy, or stamped from thin steel sheet, though in some drivers with large magnets cast chassis are preferable as sheet metal can easily be warped in whenever the loudspeaker is subjected to rough handling. Other materials such as molded plastic and damped plastic compound baskets are becoming common, especially for inexpensive, low-mass drivers. [...] Metallic chassis <b>can</b> <b>play</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> role in conducting heat away from the voice coil; heating during operation changes resistance, causes physical dimensional changes, and if extreme, may even demagnetize permanent magnets.|$|E

2500|$|Security – Packaging <b>can</b> <b>play</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> role in {{reducing}} {{the security risks of}} shipment. [...] Packages can be made with improved tamper resistance to deter manipulation and they can also have tamper-evident features indicating that tampering has taken place. Packages can be engineered to help reduce the risks of package pilferage or the theft and resale of products: [...] Some package constructions are more resistant to pilferage than other types, and some have pilfer-indicating seals. Counterfeit consumer goods, unauthorized sales (diversion), material substitution and tampering can all be minimized or prevented with such anti-counterfeiting technologies. Packages may include authentication seals and use security printing to help indicate that the package and contents are not counterfeit. Packages also can include anti-theft devices such as dye-packs, RFID tags, or electronic article surveillance tags that can be activated or detected by devices at exit points and require specialized tools to deactivate. [...] Using packaging in this way is a means of retail loss prevention.|$|E
2500|$|In cricket, coaches cannot {{intervene}} {{or direct}} gameplay; the captain must {{make all the}} calls once the players are out on the field. However, the coach may convey messages to the captain or the players at any time, {{since there is no}} restriction on signalling or speaking to players on the field. In dynamic situations, like a run chase with an imminent possibility of rain, it is quite common for coaches to update tactics using signals. Hansie Cronje, the former cricket captain of South Africa, once took the field with a wireless link to the coach, Bob Woolmer. Subsequently, the use of gadgets to transmit messages was banned by the International Cricket Council. Regardless, the coach is merely an adviser; it is almost always the case that the cricket captain has complete authority over the team once play starts. In baseball, by contrast, managers and coaches will often direct the players (through hand signals) to carry out a play (such as a stolen base or hit and run), or to field at a particular depth. In fact, [...] "stealing signs" [...] <b>can</b> <b>play</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> part in baseball strategy when a player on an opposing team tries to interpret hand signals between pitcher and catcher or between runner and base coach, and possibly then relay this information to another player without being themselves detected.|$|E
2500|$|Some call {{attention}} to the conjunction of Commons-based peer production with 3D printing and other low-cost manufacturing techniques. The self-reinforced fantasy of a system of eternal growth can be overcome with the development of economies of scope, and here, society <b>can</b> <b>play</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> role contributing to the raising of the whole productive structure to a higher plateau of more sustainable and customized productivity. Further, it is true that many issues, problems, and threats arise due to the democratization of the means of production, and especially regarding the physical ones. For instance, the recyclability of advanced nanomaterials is still questioned; weapons manufacturing could become easier; not to mention the implications for counterfeiting and on IP. It might be maintained that in contrast to the industrial paradigm whose competitive dynamics were about economies of scale, Commons-based peer production 3D printing could develop economies of scope. While the advantages of scale rest on cheap global transportation, the economies of scope share infrastructure costs (intangible and tangible productive resources), taking advantage of the capabilities of the fabrication tools. And following Neil Gershenfeld in that [...] "some of the least developed parts of the world need some of the most advanced technologies," [...] Commons-based peer production and 3D printing may offer the necessary tools for thinking globally but acting locally in response to certain needs.|$|E
