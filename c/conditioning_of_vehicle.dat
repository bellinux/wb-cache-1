40|$|International audienceThe air <b>conditioning</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicle</b> cabins is now {{standard}} equipment for vehicles. Increasing {{the consumption of}} fuel, the air conditioning also raises difficulties and costs with its integration in the electric and hybrid vehicles, because of the continuous or punctual absence of hot source as is the internal combustion engine. In this paper, we study {{the interest of the}} techniques of adiabatic cooling to cooling down a cabin of an agricultural machine. Recordings of the activity of a tractor in real situation are used for studying the temperatures inside the cabin along a typical working day. From these observations, we adapted a model to estimate the thermal exchanges of the cabin with the environment. The solar incomes are estimated under various countries in France and the ventilation rate is taken into account. We substitute then the air conditioning by a system that mists water droplets on the air admission for the cabin. The efficiency of this cooling system depends mainly of the atmospheric conditions and we establish, for various weather situations, the cooling capacity of this process. So the temperatures inside the cabin are assessed, as well as the water consumption. These results add to efficiency assessment about adiabatic cooling systems for industrial vehicles...|$|E

5000|$|Some {{electronic}} devices are marketed as fuel savers. The Fuel Doctor FD-47, for example, plugs into the vehicle's cigarette lighter and displays several LEDs. It is claimed to increase vehicle fuel economy {{by up to}} 25% through [...] "power <b>conditioning</b> <b>of</b> the <b>vehicle's</b> electrical systems", but Consumer Reports detected no difference in economy or power in tests on ten separate vehicles, finding that the device did nothing but light up. Car and Driver magazine found that the device contains nothing buts [...] "a simple circuit board for the LED lights", and disassembly and circuit analysis reached the same conclusion. The maker disputed claims that the device has no effect, and proposed changes to the Consumer Reports testing procedure, which when implemented made no difference to the results.|$|R
30|$|Energy {{generation}} using {{solar photovoltaic}} requires large area. As {{cost of the}} land is growing day by day, there is a strong requirement to use the available land as efficiently as possible. Here, we explored the potential of energy generation using the land above national road highways by constructing a roof structure. This space can contribute to the energy generation without extra cost for the land. It also results in energy efficiency, for example, improved vehicle movement and minimum energy for air <b>conditioning</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Additionally, it also helps in minimum road repairs and longer vehicle tire life due to the effect of sun shade. Thus, the expenditure for wear and tear for road repairs is reduced considerably. From our modelling study, it is observed that the Ahmedabad-Rajkot highway can generate 104 MW of electricity (163 GWh of annual energy generation) and the Ahmedabad-Vadodara highway space can generate 61 MW of electricity (96 GWh of annual energy generation) for single-layer solar panels. If there are two layers of solar panels one over the other, the annual energy generation of the same highways, Ahmedabad-Rajkot and Ahmedabad-Vadodara, can be increased to 229 GWh and 140 GWh, respectively. If our concept is implemented throughout India, it not only increases the power generation to more than a few gigawatts of electricity but also has other various fringe benefits including longer road life, employment generation, reduced CO 2 emission in environment, etc.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an efficient speed governor for the blower motor {{used in the}} air <b>conditioning</b> <b>of</b> electric <b>vehicles</b> (EV). Performance optimization of blowers offers tremendous potential for energy saving and hence the running cost. Pulse width modulation (PWM) technique {{is one of the}} most economical and widely used techniques in the motor control applications. SG 3525 device is used to generate the required PWM signals for the regulation of the blower motor speed. The PWM signal with 0 - 100 % duty ratio control governs the semiconductor switches such as MOSFETs in controlling the supply voltage to the motor. The proposed control scheme governs the speed by varying the reference voltage to the SG 3525 and also protects the motor from high current as the scheme monitors the current flow through the motor indirectly via gate control signal of the semiconductor switches...|$|R
40|$|The {{cold air}} {{refrigerating}} machines are practically {{of the same}} age as the vaporisation-compression-type refrigerating machines, however, the former ones were put in actual operation only during the past decades. As the principal reason for it, their lower economi-cal efficiency can be considered. However, the vaporisation-compression-type refrigerating machines cause heavy pollution to the environment (gap of ozone layer problem), there-fore the interest in the cold air refrigerating machines has been greatly aroused lately. In the paper, the operation, theory and application possibilities of the cold air refrigerating machines are dealt with, especially considering the air- <b>conditioning</b> <b>of</b> motor <b>vehicles.</b> The improvement <b>of</b> the economy of cold air refrigerating machines is especially paid great attention in this paper. In addition, the possibilities of applying heat exchangers, as well as the cooling process of the operating-medium during compression with the help of liquid charge are examined...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A solar based air <b>conditioning</b> blower model <b>of</b> <b>vehicle</b> {{has been}} {{presented}} together {{with the development of}} its intelligent controller in this report. The model is dependent on its own battery that is recharged by the energy collected from solar panel system. An automatic variable speed blower is introduced into the system. Vehicle cabin temperature is controlled by varying the blower speed. The intelligent controller is embedded with fuzzy logic strategy. A control algorithm is obtained with a design of the model and the system. The results satisfied the project objectives. The system is able to run using a lead acid battery and a solar panel with power consumption of 98. 4 W. The fuzzy logic controller performed well with a percentage error less than 1. 64 %. 1...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{determine}} the effects of scopolamine, a cholinergic antagonist, on the <b>conditioning</b> <b>of</b> an instrumental response and the contextual <b>conditioning</b> <b>of</b> this response. Five groups of rats were trained to lever-press on a Variable Interval 30 s schedule in context A. Scopolamine was administered 15 min before each conditioning session to AB 0. 01 mg/kg, AB 0. 10 mg/kg and AB 1. 00 mg/kg groups. The AA Saline and AB Saline groups received saline injections. Contextual <b>conditioning</b> <b>of</b> the lever-pressing response was assessed in one extinction session.

40|$|Secretion {{of saliva}} to aid {{swallowing}} and digestion {{is an important}} physiological function found in many vertebrates and invertebrates. Pavlov reported classical <b>conditioning</b> <b>of</b> salivation in dogs a century ago. <b>Conditioning</b> <b>of</b> salivation, however, has been so far reported only in dogs and humans, and its underlying neural mechanisms remain elusive because {{of the complexity of}} the mammalian brain. We previously reported that, in cockroaches Periplaneta americana, salivary neurons that control salivation exhibited increased responses to an odor after conditioning trials in which the odor was paired with sucrose solution. However, no direct evidence <b>of</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>of</b> salivation was obtained. In this study, we investigated the effects <b>of</b> <b>conditioning</b> trials on the level of salivation. Untrained cockroaches exhibited salivary responses to sucrose solution applied to the mouth but not to peppermint or vanilla odor applied to an antenna. After differential conditioning trials in which an odor was paired with sucrose solution and another odor was presented without pairing with sucrose solution, sucrose-associated odor induced an increase in the level of salivation, but the odor presented alone did not. The conditioning effect lasted for one day after conditioning trials. This study demonstrates, for the first time, classical <b>conditioning</b> <b>of</b> salivation in species other than dogs and humans, thereby providing the first evidence of sophisticated neural control of autonomic function in insects. The results provide a useful model system for studying cellular basis <b>of</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>of</b> salivation in the simpler nervous system of insects...|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The Climatic Wind Tunnel (CWT) is a facility used by the motor industry to test vehicles under climatic extremes {{without the need for}} expensive overseas test programs. This work focuses on the application of computer simulation to the Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) plant that makes up a CWT facility. The objective being to reduce its operational costs through the identification of energy saving operational strategies. When in operation the CWT has a peak power consumption of 3 MW. The implementation of any measures that would reduce this peak load would give rise to considerable savings in the operating costs of the facility. Computer simulation is an accepted technique for the study of systems operating under varying load conditions. Simulation allows rapid analysis of different strategies for operating plant and the effectiveness of achieving the desired effect without compromising the buildings performance. Models for the components of the CWT have been developed and coded in Neutral Model Format. These models have then been linked together in a modular simulation environment to give a model of the complete plant. The CWT plant naturally decomposesin to four major subsystems these being the test chamber, the soakroom, air make-up and refrigeration system. Models of all the primary and secondary HVAC plant are described as is how they constitute the systems that make up the CWT. Validation tests for individual components {{as well as for the}} systems have been carried out. To illustrate the potential of the application of computer simulation into finding improved modes of operation that would reduce the energy consumption of the facility, four studies have been carried out. The studies involve the possibility of scheduling the operation of condenser fans as a function of refrigeration load and outside ambient temperature, methods for the pre-test <b>conditioning</b> <b>of</b> a <b>vehicle,</b> a reduction in the secondary refrigerant flow temperature and an increase in the thickness of the insulated panels from which the facility is constructed. The studies carried out showed that there was potential for moderate energy savings to be made in the operation of the facility and that extended simulation runs would allow for the in-depth assessment of a large range of possible modes of plant operation in order to identify the areas where the greatest savings are possible...|$|R
