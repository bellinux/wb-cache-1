40|$|Expectations {{of market}} {{participants}} {{play an important}} role in monetary policy making. The main reason for this is that expectations influence the behaviour of investors and prices in financial markets. In this article, we present two sources of information on the expectations of financial market participants regarding the central bank’s policy rate. Both the yields of government securities and the survey of interest rate expectations conducted by Reuters contain information on what the market expects the future path of the policy rate to be, but sometimes these two sources of information convey substantially different messages. Our analysis helps to understand this phenomenon by shedding light on two key factors behind it. On the one hand, forward rates calculated from the yield curve contain a risk premium and exceed the expected value of the future <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> <b>policy</b> <b>rate.</b> On the other hand, analysts in the Reuters’ survey report the most likely value of the future <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> <b>policy</b> <b>rate</b> as their forecasts, instead of the average value of all possible scenarios. Finally, we claim that if the information from the two sources is interpreted properly – taking into account the previous factors – both sources contain valuable information for monetary policy making.

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{interest}} rate transmission mechanism for the Eurozone and the USA and discuss this issue {{in the light of}} the recent financial market tensions. For an efficient monetary policy, any change in the <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> <b>policy</b> <b>rate</b> is meant to be transmitted to retail interest rates, ultimately influencing consumer and business lending rates and therefore aggregate domestic demand and output. The disaggregated GETS methodology is employed, which allows us to reveal the relative importance of the central bank and money market rates as policy vehicle variables in the two banking systems. Our empirical results for the two banking systems are rather mixed as far as it concerns the pass-through transmission and completeness.

During the crisis, the policy spread exhibited signs of volatility, owing to the breakdown in interbank market activity. The determinants of this volatility are assessed using Stochastic Volatility models to gauge the role played by liquidity risk, credit risk (financial and sovereign), and interest rate expectations. Our results suggest that liquidity risk is the main determinant of {{the volatility of}} the policy spread, but also that private bank credit risk has become more apparent in the post-Lehman collapse phase of the crisis for the euro area as financial CDS premia rose due to possible default fears. In addition, the ECB appears to have been more effective in addressing liquidity risk since the onset of the crisis, and this may be related to its greater direct access to a broader range of counterparties and its acceptance of a broader range of eligible collateral.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this paper is an {{examination}} of the pass‐through interest rate transmission from the wholesale rates (central bank and/or money market rates) to the retail rates (deposit and lending rates) of the banking system. Knowledge of the transmission substantially helps us to calculate the pass‐through interest rate margin or mark‐up in the banking systems under examination (USA, Canada, the UK and the Eurozone). The selection of the wholesale interest rate is also an important part of this pass‐through transmission framework because it is related to the money supply process and therefore the central bank's policy capabilities. In the empirical part, a Johansen (1988) cointegration based error‐correction procedure (ECM‐GE) is implemented for the wholesale interest rate selection. Then an LSE–Hendry general‐to‐specific model (GETS) is applied, for the revelation of the banking sector pass‐through interest rate behaviour. In the empirical part, on the issue of the wholesale interest rate selection, the USA and the Eurozone seem to favour the Money Market rate while the UK and Canada favour the <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> <b>policy</b> <b>rate.</b> The results indicate two types of interest rate pass‐through behaviour, with market structure implication – namely, the US and UK banking systems contrasted with Canada–Eurozone. interest rate pass‐through behaviour, monetary policy transmission, asymmetries, E 52, E 43,...|$|E

40|$|The main {{aim of this}} {{dissertation}} is {{to broaden}} {{the understanding of the}} monetary policy transmission mechanism as it operates in Sub-Saharan Africa. The ultimate goal is to aid in the appropriate design and implementation of monetary policy for the attainment of developmental goals. The dissertation empirically explores four issues on the pricing, behavioural and output implications of monetary policy. The four questions that the dissertation attempts to answer in Chapters Two to Five respectively are: 1) Does the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission depend on the financial development of an economy? 2) Can monetary policy be used as a tool in easing pressure on domestic currencies in the foreign exchange market? 3) Do banks engage in excessively risky behaviour when monetary policy is expansionary? 4) Does monetary policy influence aggregate variables like private capital formation, growth and their interrelationships? Chapter Two tests the completeness of the pass-through of the <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> <b>policy</b> <b>rate</b> to bank lending rates on one hand, and the interest rate pass-through {{as a function of the}} level of financial development on the other hand. The results show that the pass-through of <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> <b>policy</b> <b>rate</b> to bank lending rates is asymmetric for three Anglophone West African countries, namely: Gambia, Ghana and Nigeria, which are seeking to ascend onto a single monetary framework. However, there is no evidence that financial development affects the pass-through of monetary policy. These findings still prove relevant, especially with regard to the quest for effective monetary policy implementation and the ascension onto a single monetary framework by these 3 countries. The motivation for this study stemmed from policy discussions and academic debates on the premise that financial development is a key element in the pursuit of effective monetary policy implementation, focusing on the three Anglophone West African countries between 1975 and 2011. The study employs the bounds testing approach to cointegration, and the Autoregressive Distributed Lags (ARDL) by Pesaran et al., (2001). The findings show significant differences in the interest rate pass-through of the 3 countries studied. Ghana and Gambia were characterised by undershooting in the response of lending rates to monetary policy changes whilst Nigeria was characterised by overshooting in bank lending rates. Financial development proved significant in some, but not in all the cases, while economic growth proved mostly insignificant in the transmission of the policy rate to bank lending rates In Chapter Three, we show that contractionary monetary policy of high interest rates is able to correct disequilibrium in the foreign currency market in selected countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The chapter also provides empirical evidence about the impact of macroeconomic fundamentals on the domestic foreign exchange market. The study assesses the impact of monetary policy on foreign exchange market pressure (EMP) in developing country contexts focusing on some selected countries in SSA. EMP is the sum of exchange rate depreciation and change in foreign reserves that is required to restore equilibrium to the domestic foreign exchange market. The study was motivated by the fact that most of the SSA countries are developing economies that have negative net export positions and stand to lose significantly from consistently deteriorating foreign exchange positions. This study thus sought to measure the ability of monetary policy to significantly address currency pressures that arise from trading on the global market. The hypothesis that a tighter monetary policy stance can lend strength to a currency was tested in this study using Generalised Methods of Moments (GMM) estimation in a dynamic panel setting. Data on 20 SSA economies for which data were available for the period 1991 to 2010 are used. The study found a negative and significant relationship between monetary policy and EMP, implying that contractionary monetary policy can ease EMP...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of two chapters and aims to investigate the presence Islamic banks in Indonesia {{in the context of}} stability and monetary policy transmission mechanism. The first chapter compares bank stability, in particular profit stability, in Islamic versus conventional banks amid business cycle fluctuations. The unique characteristics of Islamic finance principles hypothetically involve different financial structures and provide stability for banks that comply with them. Using monthly bank-level data with comparable banks across the two types, I investigate the dynamic responses of individual banks to business cycle fluctuations. The dynamic estimation results show that the profits of Islamic banks’ are more stable than those of conventional banks in the short run, yet generally indicate {{no significant difference in the}} long run. However, the inclusion of the loan-to-asset ratio removes the remaining short-run differences. I check for robustness by estimating the static relationship between individual bank’s profits and the average profitability of the total banking industry, and the outcomes support the no-difference results. The second chapter compares the monetary transmission through Islamic and conventional banks by investigating how a particular bank asset portfolio, which corresponds to their type from being conventional or Islamic, determines the equilibrium rate of return on loans and on deposits which in turn affects their loans and net-borrowing from the central bank. Certain application of Islamic finance principles leads to a marked difference in Islamic banks’ assets portfolio which corresponds to a consistently higher loan-to-asset ratio in comparison to conventional banks. I test a set of predictions conveyed by the theoretical model using a panel of individual bank data. The results turn to be highly dependent on how well the two types of banks are segregated from each other, in which slack segregation may dissipate the potential differences. In particular while initially the results show no significant difference in responses of the two types of banks to the <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> <b>policy</b> <b>rate,</b> excluding Islamic windows from the sample allow the potentially difference to be more apparent and significant. Overall, the possibility that both types of banks may after the same pool of consumers exposes them to compete with banks from the other type, generating arbitrage opportunities that drive prices toward equality across types and impede the potential difference across banks...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} aspects of monetary policy is an understanding of the transmission process: the mechanism through which the monetary policy actions of the Central Bank impact on aggregate demand and prices by influencing the investment and consumption decisions of households and firms. Thus, commercial banks are regarded as conveyers of monetary policy shocks and are expected to adjust retail interest rates in response to policy shocks one-to-one. In practice, commercial banks adjust their retail rates in response to changes in monetary policy with a lag of several months and this delay is often viewed as an impediment on the ability of the Central Bank to steer the economy. Several reasons, such as credit rationing and adverse selection, switching costs, risk sharing, consumer irrationality, structure of the financial system, menu costs and asymmetric information are some of the causes advanced for commercial banks retail rates being sticky. In spite of the important role of pass-through analysis in the monetary policy transmission process, it has received very little attention in Sub-Saharan Africa, especially in Cameroon and Nigeria, which have implemented a series of reforms. To this end, this study gives a comparative analysis of interest rate pass-through in Nigeria and Cameroon using retail rates (lending and deposit) and a discount rate (policy rate) from January 1990 to December 2010 for Nigeria and from January 1990 to June 2008 for Cameroon. The study examines the magnitude and speed of retail rate adjustments to changes in the <b>Central</b> <b>Bank</b> <b>policy</b> <b>rate</b> as well as examining the possibility of symmetric and asymmetric pass-through in both countries. In addition, the study also investigates whether there is pass-through of monetary policy from one country to the other. The empirical analysis employs four different types of co-integration techniques to test the presence of a long run co-integrating relationship between retail and the policy rates {{in order to ensure that}} the relationship detected is robust. Three sets of analyses are carried out in the study. Following Cottarelli and Kourelis (1994), the study employed a co-integration technique, firstly, to analyse pass-through for the entire sample, secondly, to analyse symmetric and asymmetric pass-through using a ten year rolling window analysis in an error correction framework. Finally, the policy rates were swapped around to investigate if there are transmissions of impulses from one country to the other. Overall, evidence from the entire sample and rolling window analysis suggests that monetary policy in Cameroon is less effective. This is perhaps one of the reasons why the Banque Des Etats De L’Afrique Centrale (BEAC) is unable to sterilise the excess liquidity of the banking sector in Cameroon. The long run pass-through of 0. 72 and 0. 71 for the entire sample, and the average long run pass-through for the rolling window of 0. 78 and 0. 76 for the lending and deposit rates, suggest that monetary policy is highly effective in Nigeria compared to Cameroon. The empirical evidence confirmed asymmetric adjustment in six rolling windows in the lending rate in Nigeria. Three rolling windows indicated that the direction of rigidity is downward, supporting Scholnick’s (1996) collusive pricing arrangement between banks, and the other three suggested that the lending rate is rigid in the upward direction, corroborating Scholnick’s (1996) customer reaction hypothesis. The deposit rate in Cameroon was also found to adjust asymmetrically and the direction of rigidity is downward, supporting Hannan and Berger’s (1991) customer reaction hypothesis. The investigation of impulse transmission between the two countries revealed that only the policy rate in Nigeria exerts some influence on the deposit rate in Cameroon. Policy recommendations are also discussed. ...|$|E

However, recently there has been a growing literature regarding the validity of the estimated parameters due to the non-stationarity of the interest rate. In this paper I test the consistency of the Taylor rule with the Greek data for the period 1996 - 2004. It appears that the data do not support the Taylor rule {{in the sense that they}} do not form a cointegration set of variables. Therefore, the estimated parameters should be considered fragile and the forecasting for the interest rate as a function of inflation and output should not be expected to be adequately consistent with the actual data. ...|$|R

The univariate analysis suggests {{a high degree}} of persistence in all cases: the fractional integration parameter d is estimated to be above 1, ranging from 1. 26 (US) to 1. 48 (UK), with the single exception of Japan, for which the unit root null cannot be rejected. Concerning the bivariate results, Australian interest rates are found to be cointegrated with the Eurozone and UK ones, Canadian rates with the UK and US ones, and Japanese rates with the UK ones. The increasing degree of integration of international financial markets and the coordinated monetary policy responses following the global financial crisis might both account for such linkages...|$|R
