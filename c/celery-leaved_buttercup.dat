In the meadows many different grasses and other plants grow, such as cuckoo flower (Cardamine pratensis). The pond, stream and ditches support aquatic plants, such as arrowhead (Sagittaria sagittifolia), <b>celery-leaved</b> <b>buttercup</b> (Ranunculus sceleratus), purple-loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria), water-plantain (Alisma plantago-aquatica) and duckweed. Chub (Squalius cephalus) and carp can both {{be found in the}} 500 yards m stream, along with the nationally protected water vole (Arvicola amphibius). Numerous birds frequent The Riddy, some which feed in the meadows including redwing (Turdus iliacus), fieldfare (Turdus pilaris) and northern lapwing (Vanellus vanellus), whilst sparrowhawks (Accipiter nisus) have been observed [...] "patrolling" [...] the mature hedgerows. Grey herons (Ardea cinerea) and common terns (Sterna hirundo) hunt fish, and in the autumn, song thrushes (Turdus philomelos) can be seen at the reserve. Grey wagtail (Motacilla cinerea) and kingfisher (Alcedo atthis) have also been recorded on the reserve.|$|E
