5|$|In 1987 France took on pre-tournament favourites Australia at Concord Oval for a {{place in}} the final. In one of the {{greatest}} World Cup matches, the Australians appeared to be in control, leading 9–0, 15–12 and 24–21 at various stages of the match, only for the French to keep <b>coming</b> <b>back.</b> <b>With</b> the scores locked at 24–24 and the prospect of extra time looming, the French scored {{one of the most memorable}} tries in rugby history. Starting an attack from inside their own half, the French passed the ball through 11 pairs of hands before fullback Serge Blanco beat Wallabies hooker Tom Lawton to score a try in the corner. France won 30–24, and would face co-hosts New Zealand in the final at Eden Park. The French had not fully recovered from their magnificent effort in the semi-final, and New Zealand won the anti-climactic decider 29–9.|$|E
5|$|Pierce's 1954 {{season was}} {{interrupted}} when he reported {{pain in his}} left arm in a May 25 win over Cleveland; after several days of difficulty in determining the problem, he had oral surgery to remove an infected wisdom tooth and adjacent molar on June 3. He did not pitch again until June 20, but a lack of arm strength caused him to be ineffective in that start before slowly <b>coming</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> two relief appearances and another poor start, finally picking up wins with consecutive 3–0 shutouts on July 5 and 11, the latter being his fourth career two-hitter. It was later reported that the tooth problem had possibly existed as early as spring training, when Pierce initially suffered arm problems. But although he recorded only nine wins that season, {{he was one of}} just four pitchers to defeat the Indians three times as they racked up a league-record 111 victories, after also having been one of four pitchers to defeat the champion Yankees four times in 1953.|$|E
25|$|The semi-final {{between the}} youth team and Juventus U15 was an {{exciting}} match, with man of the match Hazim Hassan scoring 2 goals in the first half, and Juventus <b>coming</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> another 2 in the second. The Singapore team managed to beat Juventus in the penalty shootout.|$|E

Bookending these singles, the band gave away the song [...] "Chi-Town" [...] as a free digital download and as an extra release to those who purchased the deluxe edition of the LP on 14 February 2012, whereas a collaboration with artist Martin Creed produced Work #1431, a video for [...] "Anna".|$|R
25|$|In {{the most}} recent tournament, held in Taichung, Taiwan November 9–19, , Italy {{finished}} sixth. They secured an impressive 13–3 victory over Chinese Taipei in their {{first game of the}} tournament, however, they lost their next three match-ups to Netherlands, Cuba and Australia (13 innings). After <b>coming</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> a victory against the Philippines, Italy lost their next two to Japan and South Korea to end the round robin first phase of the tournament with a 2–5 record.|$|E
25|$|Cho {{defended the}} Honinbo title once more, which {{would lead to}} him {{defending}} {{it again and again}} until 1999. He did terribly (in Cho terms) due to not making it through to the Meijin. In the same year, more international tournaments come to be. These include the Tong Yang Cup and the Fujitsu Cup. Cho wasn't very successful in these, winning only one in 1991, the Fujitsu Cup. He lucked out in the 1991 Fujitsu Cup because his opponent Qian Yuping had health issues to pay attention to and couldn't compete in the final. He lost the Judan once more and lost the play-off of the Kisei. His record looked better when he ended with 30 wins and 17 losses. 1992 was nothing special. The only events to note are his defending of the Honinbo and losing the semi-final of the Ing Cup. Remnants of the old Cho were <b>coming</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> his 31–16 record.|$|E

Those records are gonna be crazy-sounding. We really pushed the envelope with some of the stuff we were doing." ...|$|E

500|$|The Russian Primary Chronicle gives a {{different}} version of events, {{in which both}} armies were combat ready and separated by the river before Bolesław, enraged by insults from across the river, charged with his army, surprising Yaroslav and scattering his forces. All accounts agree that the Polish prince was victorious in the battle. Yaroslav retreated north to Novgorod, rather than to Kiev - likely suspecting that he lacked enough strength to defend Kiev, which was besieged by the Pechenegs and had a significant pro-Sviatopolk faction within its walls. Nestor notes that after reaching Novgorod, Yaroslav attempted to flee [...] "overseas" [...] in hopes of <b>coming</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> a Varangian force, {{but according to the}} Primary Chronicle, the citizens of Novgorod pressured him to lead the fight back to Bolesław and Sviatopolk.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Thunder" [...] is a ballad {{about finding}} the [...] "strength of rising after the fall" [...] and follows the self-empowerment {{theme of the}} album. The song begins with the lyrics [...] "First it was heaven, ev'rything roses and fire," [...] and she later proclaims [...] "I’m <b>coming</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> the thunder." [...] Lewis {{projects}} a stance of empowerment as she performs the line [...] "With an empty heart, I am free again" [...] over a [...] "striding" [...] beat accompanied by a piano. Angela Wilson of Vibe described the track as [...] "a celebratory salute to self love" [...] and highlighted the lines [...] "And I won’t wait any longer / When you let me down, I got stronger," [...] as empowering. Will Hodgkinson of The Times thought that [...] "Thunder" [...] was about her former record label boss and friend Simon Cowell, writing that the lyrics [...] "I won’t wait any longer, when you let me down I got stronger," [...] was Lewis' way of saying [...] "Check me out now, you high-waisted berk." [...] The song, in the key of B major, has a tempo of 92beats per minute. Lewis' voice spans more than two octaves, from F3 to G5.|$|E
2500|$|The Associated Press {{reports that}} two PackBot ground robots from iRobot have entered unit 1 and unit 3 of the {{crippled}} Fukushima {{nuclear power plant}} and performed temperature, pressure, and radioactivity measurements. The remote-controlled robots entered the two reactors over the preceding weekend. The devices opened closed doors and explored the insides of the reactor buildings, <b>coming</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> radioactivity readings of up to 49mSv/h inside unit 1 and up to 57mSv/h inside unit 3. TEPCO officials say that the radiation data from the robots do not change their plans for shutting down the plant {{by the end of}} this year. Though more robots will be used, a TEPCO official, Takeshi Makigami, says that robots are limited in what they can do, and eventually [...] "people must enter the buildings". Robots also entered unit 2, but the probe was hindered by fogging of the robot's camera lens from the high humidity, over 90%, inside the building.|$|E
