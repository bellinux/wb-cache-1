30|$|The {{sample of}} {{forwarders}} {{who responded to}} the questionnaire is dominated by small- and medium-sized forwarder companies (approximately 80  % of the recipients with a maximum of 250 employees and a maximum of 50 Mio. € turnover in 2009). For company size, we use the classification of small- and medium-sized enterprises proposed by the European Commission (European Commission 2005). The sample allocation is, consequently, consistent with the forwarder’s market structure presented in the latest survey of German Freight Forwarders and Logistics Operators (The Association of German Freight Forwarders and Logistics Operators 2010). The total number <b>of</b> <b>semi-trailers</b> in the sample is 28, 109 [13.9  % <b>of</b> all <b>semi-trailers</b> registered by German transport companies (Federal Office for Goods Transport 2011 b)] of which 2  % are liftable. The majority <b>of</b> <b>semi-trailers</b> in the sample (approximately 95  %) are disposed by large- (> 250 employees) and middle-sized companies (50 – 250 employees). Subcontracting represents the dominant disposition form among forwarders, with 68  % <b>of</b> all <b>semi-trailers</b> in the sample. The differences in the disposition form in dependence on company size are revealed. Large enterprises (> 250 employees) dispose 60  % by means of subcontracting and possess 56  % <b>of</b> all <b>semi-trailers</b> in the sample. Middle-sized forwarder companies, 36  % of the companies in the sample with 39  % <b>of</b> all <b>semi-trailers,</b> dispose semi-trailers mainly by means of subcontracting, 85  % are subcontracted semi-trailers and 15  % are from their own fleet. In contrast, small-sized forwarders dispose more <b>of</b> their own <b>semi-trailers</b> than foreign <b>semi-trailers.</b> The share <b>of</b> their own fleet, among the smallest of enterprises (< 10 employees), is approximately 60  %, while this share is 46  % for small enterprises (10 – 50 employees). In total, the small-sized forwarder companies dispose only 4.8  % <b>of</b> all <b>semi-trailers</b> in the sample. It should be noted that semi-trailers could be counted twice in the sample. For example, when a large-sized forwarder company disposes the <b>semi-trailer</b> <b>of</b> a small-sized forwarder where both companies are in the sample, the semi-trailer is counted twice. That is, it counts once as being subcontracted for the large-sized forwarder and counts again as being part of the fleet disposition for the small-sized forwarder.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{investigate}} why rail is used to move semi-trailers to and from seaports to lesser extent than it is used to move maritime containers, and which actions can foster an increase <b>of</b> <b>semi-trailer</b> transport by rail. The two types of load units are obviously used in quite different logistics settings. The two transport segments are compared in terms of the transport markets they serve, the competition they face and the operational and technological principles upon which they operate. The empirical setting is the transport of general cargo in load units between Scandinavia, Continental Europe and the UK, although the container segment is analysed as an element of deep-sea liner shipping. Empirical findings are drawn from the case of the Port of Gothenburg and its Scandinavian hinterland. Sustained double-digit annual growth has led to a situation where most of the potential market for the hinterland transport of maritime containers has already been realised. The challenge for further growth is now to capture the semi-trailer segment. Not surprisingly, this analysis shows that rail is more competitive for the hinterland transport of containers than <b>of</b> <b>semi-trailers,</b> but there are still significant opportunities for reaping the benefits of rail transport <b>of</b> <b>semi-trailer</b> transport in the hinterlands of European ports. An increased integration of rail transport and Roll-on/Roll-off shipping will not only require, but also encourage, changes in the overall system design as well as its competitiveness compared to all-road and all-rail services...|$|R
