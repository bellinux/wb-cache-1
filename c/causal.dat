5|$|On the {{macroeconomic}} scale, Lars-Hendrik Röller and Leonard Waverman {{suggested a}} <b>causal</b> link between good telecommunication infrastructure and economic growth. Few dispute {{the existence of}} a correlation although some argue it is wrong to view the relationship as <b>causal.</b>|$|E
5|$|Extreme {{weather and}} sea {{conditions}} {{play a role}} in all of the published theories regarding Fitzgeralds sinking, but they differ on the other <b>causal</b> factors.|$|E
5|$|Genotyping arrays {{designed}} for GWAS rely on linkage disequilibrium to provide {{coverage of the}} entire genome by genotyping a subset of variants. Because of this, the reported associated variants {{are unlikely to be}} the actual <b>causal</b> variants. Associated regions can contain hundreds of variants spanning large regions and encompassing many different genes, making the biological interpretation of GWAS loci more difficult. Fine-mapping is a process to refine these lists of associated variants to a credible set most likely to include the <b>causal</b> variant.|$|E
5|$|However, it {{has also}} been claimed that no {{evidence}} has ever been presented for any <b>causal</b> connection between Anning and the lyrics.|$|E
5|$|Occasionalism is {{the view}} espoused by Nicholas Malebranche that asserts that all {{supposedly}} <b>causal</b> relations between physical events, or between physical and mental events, are not really <b>causal</b> at all. While body and mind are different substances, causes (whether mental or physical) are related to their effects {{by an act of}} God's intervention on each specific occasion.|$|E
5|$|Among other innovations, {{the project}} {{developed}} DNA-marking methods which were {{an important step}} in making the Human Genome Project possible. In 1993, the research group isolated the precise <b>causal</b> gene at 4p16.3, making this the first autosomal disease locus found using genetic linkage analysis.|$|E
5|$|However, this is {{management}} {{at the end of}} a long series of indirect <b>causal</b> factors that are initiated by human consumption, so a second approach is through demand management of human resource use.|$|E
5|$|There {{is thus a}} <b>causal</b> chain which transmits {{information}} from a sense organ to an organ capable of making decisions, and onwards to a motor organ. In this respect, the model is analogous to a modern understanding of information processing such as in sensory-motor coupling.|$|E
25|$|In practice, this {{relationship}} of streamed events is processed through a <b>causal</b> vector engine, which performs a lookup based on recently viewed events and assigns a <b>causal</b> vector {{to an event}} if a relationship is discovered. If A causes B, the <b>causal</b> vector engine checks if B’s <b>causal</b> vector rule index contains a reference to A. The engine may handle events for different transactions simultaneously, perhaps in a different order than they occurred.|$|E
25|$|Strength of Association: A small {{association}} {{does not}} mean {{that there is not a}} <b>causal</b> effect, though the larger the association, the more likely that it is <b>causal.</b>|$|E
25|$|Whether or not qualia or {{consciousness}} {{can play}} any <b>causal</b> {{role in the}} physical world remains an open question, with epiphenomenalism acknowledging the existence of qualia while denying it any <b>causal</b> power. The position has been criticized by a number of philosophers, if only because our own consciousness seem to be causally active. In order to avoid epiphenomenalism, one who believes that qualia are nonphysical would need to embrace something like interactionist dualism; or perhaps emergentism, the claim that there are as yet unknown <b>causal</b> relations between the mental and physical. This in turn would imply that qualia can be detected by an external agency through their <b>causal</b> powers.|$|E
25|$|<b>Causal</b> {{determinism}} is {{the concept}} that events within a given paradigm are bound by causality {{in such a way}} that any state (of an object or event) is completely determined by prior states. <b>Causal</b> determinism proposes that there is an unbroken chain of prior occurrences stretching back to the origin of the universe. <b>Causal</b> determinists believe that there is nothing uncaused or self-caused. The most common form of <b>causal</b> determinism is nomological determinism (or scientific determinism), the notion that the past and the present dictate the future entirely and necessarily by rigid natural laws, that every occurrence results inevitably from prior events. Quantum mechanics poses a serious challenge to this view.|$|E
25|$|Systems {{that are}} <b>causal</b> and stable whose inverses are <b>causal</b> and {{unstable}} {{are known as}} non-minimum-phase systems. A given non-minimum phase system will have a greater phase contribution than the minimum-phase system with the equivalent magnitude response.|$|E

25|$|The Oracle CVE Analytical Engine uses {{a set of}} {{theoretical}} models, each of which evaluates {{some or all of}} the data. When a business analyst configures <b>causal</b> factors, he/she specifies criteria indicating which models should consider which <b>causal</b> factor.|$|E
25|$|According to Nagarjuna, {{the second}} <b>causal</b> link (sankhara, motivations) and the tenth <b>causal</b> link (bhava, gestation) are two karmas through which sentient beings trigger seven sufferings {{identified}} in the Twelve Nidanas, and from this arises the revolving rebirth cycles.|$|E

25|$|In United States law, {{epidemiology}} alone cannot {{prove that}} a <b>causal</b> association {{does not exist}} in general. Conversely, it can be (and is in some circumstances) taken by US courts, in an individual case, to justify an inference that a <b>causal</b> association does exist, based upon a balance of probability.|$|E
25|$|A <b>causal</b> {{network is}} a Bayesian network with an {{explicit}} {{requirement that the}} relationships be <b>causal.</b> The additional semantics of the <b>causal</b> networks specify that if a node X is actively caused {{to be in a}} given state x (an action written as do(X=x)), then the probability density function changes to the one of the network obtained by cutting the links from the parents of X to X, and setting X to the caused value x. Using these semantics, one can predict the impact of external interventions from data obtained prior to intervention.|$|E
25|$|Logical clocks {{provide a}} <b>causal</b> happened-before {{ordering}} of events.|$|E
25|$|Predeterminism is {{the idea}} that all events are {{determined}} in advance. The concept of predeterminism is often argued by invoking <b>causal</b> determinism, implying that there is an unbroken chain of prior occurrences stretching back to the origin of the universe. In the case of predeterminism, this chain of events has been pre-established, and human actions cannot interfere with the outcomes of this pre-established chain. Predeterminism can be used to mean such pre-established <b>causal</b> determinism, in which case it is categorised as a specific type of determinism. It can also be used interchangeably with <b>causal</b> determinismin the context of its capacity to determine future events. Despite this, predeterminism is often considered as independent of <b>causal</b> determinism. The term predeterminism is also frequently used in the context of biology and hereditary, in which case it represents a form of biological determinism.|$|E

25|$|Using a <b>Causal</b> Vector Engine, the {{perception}} of causality can be enhanced under appropriate spatiotemporal conditions based on structural and temporal rules written into the engine. Perception of complex <b>causal</b> semantics, such as additive, mediated, and bidirectional causalities need to be coded so that the engine can distinguish between events that are related and those that only appear to be related but, in fact, are not.|$|E

25|$|Sometimes the Green's {{function}} can {{be split}} into a sum of two functions. One with the variable positive (+) {{and the other}} with the variable negative (-). These are the advanced and retarded Green's functions, and when the equation under study depends on time, one of the parts is <b>causal</b> and the other anti-causal. In these problems usually the <b>causal</b> part is the important one.|$|E

Does improved mood lead to improved health, or does good health lead to good mood, or both? Or does some other factor underlie both? In other words, a correlation can be taken as evidence for a possible <b>causal</b> relationship, but cannot indicate what the <b>causal</b> relationship, if any, might be.|$|E
