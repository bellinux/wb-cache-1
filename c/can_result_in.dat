5|$|After a {{star has}} {{finished}} generating energy through thermonuclear fusion, it evolves {{into a more}} compact, degenerate state.

5000|$|Arterial damage — Arterial pseudoaneurysms may form at {{injection}} sites, which <b>can</b> rupture, potentially <b>resulting</b> <b>in</b> hemorrhage, distal ischemia, and gangrene. Inadvertent intra-arterial injection <b>can</b> also <b>result</b> <b>in</b> endarteritis and thrombosis, with ultimately similar consequences.|$|R

5|$|Although {{reports of}} {{poisoning}} in humans are rare, ingestion of ferric chloride <b>can</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> serious morbidity and mortality. Inappropriate labeling and storage lead to accidental swallowing or misdiagnosis. Early diagnosis is important, especially in seriously poisoned patients.|$|E
5|$|An {{underactive thyroid}} gland results in hypothyroidism. Typical {{symptoms}} are abnormal weight gain, tiredness, constipation, heavy menstrual bleeding, hair loss, cold intolerance, and a slow heart rate. Iodine deficiency {{is the most}} common cause of hypothyroidism worldwide, and the autoimmune disease Hashimoto's thyroiditis {{is the most common}} cause in the developed world. Other causes include congenital abnormalities, diseases causing transient inflammation, surgical removal or radioablation of the thyroid, the drugs amiodarone and lithium, amyloidosis, and sarcoidosis. Some forms of hypothyroidism <b>can</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> myxedema and severe cases <b>can</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> myxedema coma.|$|E
5|$|Another {{disorder}} {{is that of}} thyroid dysgenesis which <b>can</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> various presentations {{of one or more}} misplaced accessory thyroid glands. These can be asymptomatic.|$|E

50|$|Many species <b>can</b> cross-fertilise, <b>resulting</b> <b>in</b> great {{morphological}} {{variety and}} complicating classification.|$|R
5|$|Concussion <b>can</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> {{changes in}} mood {{including}} crankiness, loss {{of interest in}} favorite activities or items, tearfulness, and displays of emotion that are inappropriate to the situation. Common symptoms in concussed children include restlessness, lethargy, and irritability.|$|E
5|$|Disorders of {{the thyroid}} are functional–caused by {{dysfunction}} {{in the production}} of hormones, and nodes and tumors either benign or malignant. Functional disorders can cause inflammation as can some other forms of thyroiditis. Functional disorders <b>can</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> the overproduction or underproduction of hormones. Any of the functional thyroid disorders <b>can</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> the gland's enlargement and cause a swollen neck termed a goitre.|$|E
5|$|In Nigeria, {{at least}} half a million suffer from vaginal fistula, {{largely as a result of}} lack of medical care. Early marriages <b>can</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> fistula.|$|E

5|$|Inhaling helium {{directly}} from pressurized cylinders or even balloon filling valves is extremely dangerous, as high flow rate and pressure <b>can</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> barotrauma, fatally rupturing lung tissue.|$|E
5|$|Injury to the {{accessory}} nerve <b>can</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> neck pain and {{weakness of the}} trapezius muscle. Symptoms will depend on at what point along its length the nerve was severed. Injury to the nerve <b>can</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> shoulder girdle depression, atrophy, abnormal movement, a protruding scapula, and weakened abduction. Weakness of the shoulder girdle can lead to traction injury of the brachial plexus. Because diagnosis is difficult, electromyogram or nerve conduction studies {{may be needed to}} confirm a suspected injury. Outcomes with surgical treatment appear to be better than conservative management, which entails physiotherapy and pain relief. Surgical management includes neurolysis, nerve end-to-end suturing, and surgical replacement of affected trapezius muscle segments with other muscle groups.|$|E

30|$|Complex {{adaptive}} {{systems are}} subset of dynamic non-linear system (McDaniel and Driebe 2001). In non-linear agent interactions, the inputs are {{inversely proportional to}} output (Lansing 2003). In these amazing systems, small changes <b>can</b> <b>results</b> <b>in</b> a big change and vice versa. Mathematically, {{the behavior of the}} non-linear system can be described as non-linear polynomial equations.|$|R

5|$|Reflections in {{more complex}} scenarios, such as {{found on a}} network of cables, <b>can</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> very {{complicated}} and long lasting waveforms on the cable. Even a simple overvoltage pulse entering a cable system as uncomplicated as the power wiring found in a typical private home <b>can</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> an oscillatory disturbance as the pulse is reflected to and fro from multiple circuit ends. These ring waves as they are known persist for far longer than the original pulse and their waveforms bears little obvious resemblance to the original disturbance, containing high frequency components {{in the tens of}} MHz range.|$|E
5|$|Severe {{thunderstorms}} {{can sometimes}} produce hail, very strong straight line winds and tornadoes. Very heavy rainfall from thunderstorms <b>can</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> flash flooding. Thunderstorms occur most often {{during the summer}} but can occur {{at any time of}} the year.|$|E
