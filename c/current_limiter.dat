25|$|A {{thermistor}} {{is a type}} of resistor whose {{resistance is}} dependent on temperature, more so than in standard resistors. The word is a portmanteau of thermal and resistor. Thermistors are widely used as inrush <b>current</b> <b>limiter,</b> temperature sensors (Negative Temperature Coefficient or NTC type typically), self-resetting overcurrent protectors, and self-regulating heating elements (Positive Temperature Coefficient or PTC type typically).|$|E
25|$|As an inrush <b>current</b> <b>limiter</b> {{device in}} power supply circuits, they present a higher {{resistance}} initially, which prevents large currents from flowing at turn-on, and then heat up and become much lower resistance to allow higher current flow during normal operation. These thermistors are usually {{much larger than}} measuring type thermistors, and are purposely designed for this application.|$|E
2500|$|With NTC thermistors, {{resistance}} decreases as temperature rises. An NTC {{is commonly}} used as a temperature sensor, or in series with a circuit as an inrush <b>current</b> <b>limiter.</b>|$|E

30|$|Though {{inductors}} at the DC side {{can serve}} as <b>current</b> <b>limiters,</b> large reactance will reduce the dynamic response speed and can easily cause parallel resonance. In normal operation, the equivalent inductance of saturated iron-core fault <b>current</b> <b>limiters</b> (SI-FCL) is so small {{that it has no}} effect on the VSC-HVDC system. When a DC side fault occurs, the equivalent inductance increases rapidly to limit the fault current. Thus, this approach is superior to installing inductors.|$|R
40|$|The {{continuous}} {{growth of}} electrical energy demand is {{resulting in a}} corresponding increase in the short-circuit current in power networks. Several solutions have been implemented, {{including the use of}} Fault <b>current</b> <b>limiters,</b> in order to reduce circuit breakers' rated capacity and to limit the electrodynamics stress in associated equipment. This paper presents an overview of fault current limiting techniques implemented in power distribution networks, with emphasis on fault <b>current</b> <b>limiters</b> and their characteristics that affect protection co-ordination and performance of power networks, particularly those with embedded generation...|$|R

5000|$|Another way to {{mitigate}} arc flash {{is to use}} a triggered <b>current</b> <b>limiter</b> or commutating <b>current</b> <b>limiter</b> which inserts a low rated continuous current current limiting fuse that melts and interrupts the arc flash within 4 ms. The advantage of this device is that it eliminates the arc flash at the source and does not divert it to another section of the system. A triggered <b>current</b> <b>limiter</b> will always be [...] "Current Limiting" [...] which means it will interrupt the circuit before the first peak current occurs. These devices are electronically controlled and sensed and provide feedback to the user about their operational status. They can also be turned ON and OFF as desired. These devices must be replaced after an operation.|$|E

40|$|Fault <b>current</b> <b>limiters</b> are {{devices that}} limit {{currents}} in electrical networks during a fault event, such as power lines touching or arcing due to tree branches. In this paper, two designs for small-scale saturated-core fault <b>current</b> <b>limiters</b> are discussed: one that uses DC coils to saturate the cores, {{and one that}} uses a hybrid design with DC coils and permanent magnet blocks.

40|$|Fault <b>Current</b> <b>Limiters</b> {{are used}} in {{a wide array of}} {{applications}} from small circuit protection at low power levels to large scale high power applications which require superconductors and complex control circuitry. One advantage of passive fault <b>current</b> <b>limiters</b> (FCL) is the automatic behavior that is dependent on the intrinsic properties of the circuit elements rather than on a complex feedback control scheme making this approach attractive for low cost applications and also where reliability is critical.

50|$|A {{common use}} in the {{electrical}} power generating and distribution industry is as a fault <b>current</b> <b>limiter</b> in the common neutral leg of large three-phase transformers and generators. In the UK they are known as Liquid Neutral Earthing Resistors (LNERs).|$|E
5000|$|A fault <b>current</b> <b>limiter</b> (FCL), or {{fault current}} {{controller}} (FCC), is a device which limits the prospective fault current when a fault occurs (e.g. {{in a power}} transmission network) without complete disconnection. The term includes superconducting, solid-state and inductive [...] devices.|$|E
50|$|As the inrush <b>current</b> <b>limiter</b> self-heats, {{the current}} {{begins to flow}} through it and warm it. Its {{resistance}} begins to drop and a relatively small current flow charges the input capacitors. After the capacitors in the power supply become charged, the self heated inrush <b>current</b> <b>limiter</b> offers little resistance in the circuit, with a low voltage drop {{with respect to the}} total voltage drop of the circuit. A disadvantage is that immediately after the device is switched off, the NTC resistor is still hot and has a low resistance. It cannot limit the inrush current unless it cools for more than 1 minute to get a higher resistance. Another disadvantage is that the NTC thermistor is not short circuit proof.|$|E

40|$|Application of Fault <b>Current</b> <b>Limiters</b> (FCL’s) seems a {{promising}} alternative to upgrade system breakers and switchgears {{in areas with}} heavy demand growth. These devices are mainly expected to improve reliability by reducing fault current values to levels interruptible by existing switchgears, and therefore ensuring safer and more reliable operation of power apparatus. Power substations {{are one of the}} ideal candidates for application of FCL’s. In this work, Monte Carlo simulation method has been used to study performance of fault <b>current</b> <b>limiters</b> and their impacts on different components.

5000|$|Superconducting fault <b>current</b> <b>limiters</b> {{exploit the}} {{extremely}} rapid loss of superconductivity (called [...] "quenching) above a critical combination of temperature, current density, and magnetic field.

5000|$|A fault <b>current</b> <b>limiter</b> is a {{nonlinear}} element {{which has}} a low impedance at normal current levels, but presents a higher impedance at fault current levels. Further, this change is extremely rapid, before a circuit breaker can trip a few millisecond later. (High-power circuit breakers are synchronized to the alternating current zero crossing to minimize arcing.) ...|$|E
50|$|Some {{instruments}} have current limiters {{on their}} inputs. The most common {{example is the}} RD Instruments Workhorse. When a <b>current</b> <b>limiter</b> fails, the instrument draws enough current to trigger the battery's short circuit protection, and the instrument fails to run. When this happens, plug in the AC adapter (which charges the ADCP's internal capacitor bank), then plug in the battery. The instrument will now run normally.|$|E
50|$|Iron-hydrogen {{resistors}} {{were used}} in the early vacuum tube systems in series with the tube heaters, to stabilize the heater circuit current against fluctuating supply voltage.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that a crucial factor {{determining}} the transmission capacity with regards to the voltage stability limit of a stressed power system, is the limitation of field and stator current of overexcited generators. These limiters are commonly referred to as overexcitation limiters (OEL) and stator <b>current</b> <b>limiters</b> (SCL). This thesis investigates the representation of overexcitation <b>limiters</b> and stator <b>current</b> <b>limiters</b> in the Swedish power system and how they could be implemented in the power system simulator PSS/E. Dynamic simulations in PSS/E are performed to investigate and validate differences between model types and parameters. The thesis compares different types of limiters and presents a representative set of parameters based on the documentation and implements them into PSS/E. The result from the study is a recommendation to migrate to limiter model MAXEX 2 for generators without stator <b>current</b> <b>limiters.</b> The MAXEX 2 model uses an inverse time characteristic which is becoming more common in installed voltage regulators. This feature makes it possible for extended use of generators before limiter action is applied. The MAXEX 2 model is also possible to tune into a fixed time delay to represent older types of limiters...|$|R
40|$|In a {{transformer}} due to abrupt change in magnetizing voltage results in Magnetizing inrush current., a transient current up to 10 to 50 {{times larger than}} the rated transformer current can flow for several cycles When {{a transformer}} is first energized. This is magnetizing inrush current. Magnitude of this current is dependent on parameters like switching instant of supply voltage,residual flux, the hysteresis characteristics of the transformer core, impedance of the primary circuit,etc which may cause system disturbances and damage the transformer windings, inorder to over come this situation it is necessary to reduce the inrush current. In This paper inrush <b>current</b> <b>limiters</b> are used that reduce inrush current at the time of switching of the transformer. Here, inrush <b>current</b> <b>limiters</b> using power electronic converters are used...|$|R
