2500|$|GFCIs are {{commonly}} available {{as an integral}} part of a receptacle or a circuit breaker installed in the distribution panelboard. GFCI receptacles invariably have rectangular faces and accept so-called Decora face plates, and can be mixed with regular outlets or switches in a multi-gang box with standard <b>cover</b> <b>plates.</b> In both Canada and the US older two-wire, ungrounded NEMA 1 receptacles may be replaced with NEMA 5 receptacles protected by a GFCI (integral with the receptacle or with the corresponding circuit breaker) in lieu of rewiring the entire circuit with a grounding conductor. In such cases the receptacles must be labeled [...] "no equipment ground" [...] and [...] "GFCI protected"; GFCI manufacturers typically provide tags for the appropriate installation description.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThree {{dimensional}} {{finite element}} model was utilized to determine mode I stress intensity factor through {{the front of a}} single edge crack in main <b>plate</b> with welded <b>cover</b> <b>plate.</b> The numerical results showed that the ratio of the crack length to the position of the welded <b>cover</b> <b>plate</b> end is a crucial parameter for describing the efficiency of the <b>cover</b> <b>plate</b> location. When the crack tip just reached the <b>cover</b> <b>plate</b> end, the <b>cover</b> <b>plate</b> efficiency is only dependent on the <b>cover</b> <b>plate</b> dimensions regardless the location of the <b>cover</b> <b>plate</b> or the crack length. In the case of crack front not reached the <b>cover</b> <b>plate</b> end, the location of <b>cover</b> <b>plate</b> {{near the edge of the}} main plate, i. e., near the crack mouth, is less efficient than that faraway. However, the opposite trend was found for cracks pass beneath the <b>cover</b> <b>plate...</b>|$|R
50|$|The MAE {{consisted}} of a small gallium-arsenide solar cell mounted underneath a removable glass <b>cover</b> <b>plate.</b> As the mission progressed, atmospheric dust would settle on the glass <b>cover</b> <b>plate,</b> blocking increasingly more sunlight from striking the solar cell, causing it to produce less power. Throughout the mission, the glass <b>cover</b> <b>plate</b> was occasionally rotated away from the solar cell, removing the light-blocking effects of the dust. Sensors measuring the difference in power output of the solar cell {{before and after the}} <b>cover</b> <b>plate</b> was removed indicated how quickly the solar cell was losing its ability to produce power, and by extension, how quickly dust was collecting on the <b>cover</b> <b>plate.</b>|$|R

30|$|Before bonding a <b>cover</b> <b>plate</b> to 3 D molded substrate, holes were {{drilled in}} the inlet and outlet {{area of the}} 3 D channel. A solvent-assisted bonding {{technique}} developed by Brown et al. [27] for bonding of PMMA chips was used. A few drops of a solvent mixture (47.5 % dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), 47.5 % water and 5 % methanol) were spread over the <b>cover</b> <b>plate</b> and then the 3 D molded substrate was placed in conformal contact with the <b>cover</b> <b>plate.</b> The assembly of 3 D molded substrate/cover plate was loaded in the NIL machine and brought to 92  °C and a 10  bar for 30  min, which led to complete bonding. For micromixers with no side and three sides of microchannel walls patterned, a plain <b>cover</b> <b>plate</b> without any patterns was used while, for micromixers with one side and four sides of channel walls patterned, a <b>cover</b> <b>plate</b> patterned with ratchet gratings was used. For the micromixer with four sides patterned, the <b>cover</b> <b>plate</b> was so aligned for bonding that the ratchet gratings in the <b>cover</b> <b>plate</b> were in parallel with the ratchet gratings {{in the bottom of}} the 3 D microchannel.|$|R

50|$|The {{mouth was}} {{located at the}} summit of the theca. Radiating like flower petals from the center were five food grooves, or ambulacra. Each ambulacrum had many long, thin, fine {{structures}} called brachioles, which were used to trap food particles and bring them to the mouth. Brachioles were delicate structures, and in fossils are not usually preserved in place. A series of five spiracle plates surrounded the star-shaped mouth, which included the anus, mouth and entrances to a set of five complex, folded respiratory organs known as hydrospires. These spiracles prevented mixing of the various fluids. Waste elimination was through the anispiracle, an opening formed by the fusing of anus and adjacent spiracles.Like crinoids, blastoids were high-level, stalked suspension feeders (feeding mainly on planktonic organisms) that inhabited clear-to-silty, moderately agitated ocean waters from shelf to basin. The food gathering system of blastoids consisted of several types of ambulacra. Food entered the brachiolar ambulacra, was transferred to the side ambulacra through the brachiolar pit, then transferred to the main (median) ambulacra, and finally entered the mouth. Each of these ambulacra was roofed by <b>cover</b> <b>plates.</b> The <b>cover</b> <b>plates</b> of the brachiolar groove were movable and could open, allowing food to enter, or close as needed. Other <b>cover</b> <b>plates</b> may also have been movable.|$|E

40|$|When a {{horizontal}} <b>cover</b> <b>plate</b> is placed above a cavity, the mechanism leading to enhanced self-sustained oscillation within the cavity is investigated by experiment at a Reynolds number Re-theta o = 171 +/- 5. As {{the leading edge}} of the <b>cover</b> <b>plate</b> is located right above the most sensitive region of the cavity shear layer, the oscillating amplitude of shear layer instability is enhanced most effectively. However, this effectiveness decreases when {{the leading edge of}} the <b>cover</b> <b>plate</b> moves further downstream of the cavity. Three mechanisms are found to possibly modify the shear layer instability across the cavity. First of all, insertion of {{a horizontal}} <b>cover</b> <b>plate</b> above the cavity does impose a favourable streamwise pressure gradient that accelerates the flow across the cavity. This flow acceleration increases the amplification rate of shear layer instability. Second, the boundary layer characteristics (both the frequency band and the fluctuating amplitude) may also provide another opportunity to perturb the shear layer instability. Third, the shear layer is deflected into the cavity and leads to strong feedback. In the present study, all three mechanisms are equally important when {{the leading edge of the}} <b>cover</b> <b>plate</b> is positioned above the cavity mouth. However, when the leading edge of the <b>cover</b> <b>plate</b> is located downstream of the cavity, the first and the second effects diminish. In this situation, the stronger feedback due to the inward-deflected shear layer (the third effect) plays an important role to modify the shear layer instability. (C) 2000 Academic Press...|$|R
40|$|This device {{allows for}} expeditious and {{repeated}} changeovers between pressure and force testing and {{which uses a}} minimum internal volume of a wind tunnel test structure. A matrix configuration of holes {{is located on the}} outer surface of the structure. Pressure tubes lead through the internal cavity of the structure from test sites to this outer surface matrix configuration. A pressure tube connector with a corresponding matrix of holes is connected {{to the surface of the}} structure. Pressure tubes leading from remotely located transducers are joined to the connector, thus forming pressure passageways from the test sites to the transducers to allow for pressure testing. When force testing is required, the pressure tube connector is disconnected and a <b>cover</b> <b>plate</b> is connected. The <b>cover</b> <b>plate</b> seals the exposed internal pressure tubes. Also, the outer surface of the <b>cover</b> <b>plate</b> conforms to the exterior of the structure, providing the necessary smooth surface for force testing.

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{economical}} fabrication of fiber-reinforced structural components is illustrated with {{an example of}} a typical control surface (aileron). The concept provides for fabricating struts, ribs, and a <b>cover</b> <b>plate</b> as an integral structure in a hardening device and then joining the closure <b>cover</b> <b>plate</b> mechanically. Fabrication of the integral structure is achieved by the 'thermal expansion molding' technique. The hardening pressure is produced by silicone rubber cores which expand under the influence of temperature. Test results are presented for several rubber materials as well as for various structural pieces. The technique is demonstrated extensively for an aileron, consisting of five ribs, struts, and a <b>cover</b> <b>plate.</b> Economically, for a large scale technical production of an aileron, cost savings of twenty-five percent can be realized compared to those for a sheet metal structure...|$|R
