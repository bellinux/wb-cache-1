40|$|Abstract: Reduction {{in plastic}} {{injection}} molding cycle time and increase in part quality are two {{goals that are}} not usually thought of as being compatible. Conformal cooling channels {{are one of the}} technologies that will help achieve both goals. Cooling time is the only phase of the injection molding cycle that has significant time to reduce. Reduction in cooling time usually results in parts with hotter temperatures. This could result in increased part shrinkage and warpage. The key to cycle time reduction and better quality is to cool the parts uniformly and more quickly. This study will show that conformal cooling channels provide better cooling than standard conventional <b>cooling</b> <b>lines.</b> By designing <b>cooling</b> channels around the part’s geometry, more uniform cooling can be achieved compared to standard conventional <b>cooling</b> <b>lines.</b> Rapid tooling is the easiest and most inexpensive method to construct conformal <b>cooling</b> <b>lines</b> in mold inserts. It is important to balance mold strength with <b>cooling</b> concerns. <b>Cooling</b> <b>lines</b> in the inserts reduce the structural integrity of the inserts. Correct placement and design of the cooling channels is needed to reduce the effect of the <b>cooling</b> <b>lines</b> on the structural integrity of the inserts. Computer-Aided-Engineering tools are needed to optimize the mold inserts for cooling and strength. High Density Polyethylene and Polycarbonate were used in this study. The mold and melt temperature differences between the two materials will help to illustrate the difference between the mold materials and <b>cooling</b> <b>line</b> layouts...|$|R
40|$|This note {{describes}} some of {{the constraints}} on muon diagnostics for the neutrino source and considers useful options. Many of these issues will also apply at some level {{to the design of}} the muon cooling experiment. Although measurements of muon beams have been made for years, the high precision, high intensities, limited access, and large backgrounds associated with the cooling environment may make the required measurements of the muon beam challenging. The primary problems seem to be associated with tuning and operating of the transverse cooling sections. At the upstream end of the <b>cooling</b> <b>line,</b> the total number of secondaries produced at the target will make any measurement of muons difficult, however at the downstream end of the <b>cooling</b> <b>line,</b> once pions and other particles have decayed or been removed by collimation, solenoidal focusing, momentum cuts or absorption, measurements using standard techniques should be much easier.

40|$|As focus shifts towards long-duration space {{exploration}} missions, an {{increased interest in}} active thermal control of cryogenic propellants to achieve zero boil-off of cryogens has emerged. An active thermal control concept of considerable merit is the integration of a broad area cooling system for a cryogenic propellant tank with a combined cryocooler and circulator system {{that can be used}} to reduce or even eliminate liquid cryogen boil-off. One prospective cryocooler and circulator combination is the reverse turbo-Brayton cycle cryocooler. This system is unique in that it has the ability to both cool and circulate the coolant gas efficiently in the same loop as the broad area cooling lines, allowing for a single cooling gas loop, with the primary heat rejection occurring by way of a radiator and/or aftercooler. Currently few modeling tools exist that can size and characterize an integrated reverse turbo-Brayton cycle cryocooler in combination with a broad area cooling design. This paper addresses efforts to create such a tool to assist in gaining a broader understanding of these systems, and investigate their performance in potential space missions. The model uses conventional engineering and thermodynamic relationships to predict the preliminary design parameters, including input power requirements, pressure drops, flow rate, cycle performance, cooling lift, broad area <b>cooler</b> <b>line</b> sizing, and component operating temperatures and pressures given the cooling load operating temperature, heat rejection temperature, compressor inlet pressure, compressor rotational speed, and cryogenic tank geometry. In addition, the model allows for the preliminary design analysis of the broad area cooling tubing, to determine the effect of tube sizing on the reverse turbo-Brayton cycle system performance. At the time this paper was written, the model was verified to match existing theoretical documentation within a reasonable margin. While further experimental data is needed for full validation, this tool has already made significant steps towards giving a clearer understanding of the performance of a reverse turbo-Brayton cycle cryocooler integrated with broad area cooling technology for zero boil-off active thermal control...|$|E

These data are combined with an extinction map and IRAS dust emission images to test our understanding of gas heating and cooling in photo-dissociation regions (PDRs). This nearby PDR is spatially resolved in the IRAS images; variations in the IRAS colors across the cloud indicate an enhanced abundance of small dust grains within the PDR. A spatial correlation between the gas <b>cooling</b> <b>lines</b> and the infrared emission from small dust grains illustrates the dominant role of small dust grains in the gas heating through the photoelectric effect. The photoelectric efficiency, determined from the observations by ratioing the power radiated by gas and small dust grains, is in the range 2 to 3 % {{in close agreement with}} recent theoretical estimates. The brightness profiles across the PDR in the C+ 158 mum and O 63 mum lines are compared with model calculations where the density profile is constrained by the extinction data and where the gas chemical and thermal balances are solved at each position.

However, because of time gaps in the observing schedule, or because of the unfavorable position of some CMEs, the most interesting events recorded by UVCS were a few short-lived ejections that represent the extension at higher altitudes of recursive EIT jets.

40|$|Abstract. Globalisation {{of supply}} chains for the {{automotive}} industry has made it increasingly difficult for developed economies to compete on price alone. In Australia, Nissan Casting has adopted technologies to reduce tooling costs and improve productivity of the die casting machines which use vacuum. Nissan Casting was experiencing cracking of their dies which extended into <b>cooling</b> <b>lines,</b> causing porosity outbreaks and shortened die life. CAST developed a repair technology called CASTrepair ™ which is a relatively quick, simple and inexpensive repair technique for cracked <b>cooling</b> <b>lines</b> in HPDC dies. Also Nissan Casting is an extensive user of vacuum and a major issue was identified as unscheduled machine stoppages caused by aluminium blockages in the vacuum valves. The valves were of the mechanical shut off type and when they failed to shut off quickly enough aluminium entered the valve which then had to be changed. CAST developed CASTvac ™ which is essentially a three dimensional chill vent with no moving parts required {{as a means to}} stop the aluminium entering the vacuum system. CASTvac ™ has proven to be very reliable in production and has significantly reduced downtimes and toolroom maintenance at Nissan Casting. These two technologies, CASTrepair ™ and CASTvac™, will be explained in detail with the latest developments in the technologies and associated benefits of their adoption...|$|R

This is the first survey of [O I] 63 mu m, {{one of the main}} photodissociation region (PDR) <b>cooling</b> <b>lines,</b> in SMGs. New high-resolution Atacama Large Millimetre Array (ALMA) interferometric 870 mu m continuum imaging confirms that these six Herschel-targeted SMG counterparts are bona fide sources of submm emission. We detect [O I] 63 mu m in two SMGs with an SNR greater than or similar to 3, tentatively detect [O I] 63 mu m in one SMG and constrain the line flux for the non-detections. We also exploit the combination of submm continuum photometry from 250 to 870 mu m and our new PACS continuum measurements to constrain the far-infrared luminosity, LFIR, in these SMGs to less than or similar to 30 per cent. We find that SMGs do not show a deficit in their [O I] 63 mu m-to-far-infrared (FIR) continuum luminosity ratios (with ratios ranging from similar or equal to 0. 5 to 1. 5 per cent), similar to what was seen previously for the [C II] 158 mu m-to-FIR ratios in SMGs. These observed ratios are about an order of magnitude higher than what is seen typically for local ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs), which adds to the growing body of evidence that SMGs are not simply scaled up versions of local ULIRGs. Rather, the PDR line-to-L-FIR ratios suggest that the star formation modes of SMGs are likely more akin to that of local normal (lower-luminosity) star-forming galaxies, with the bulk of the star formation occurring in extended galaxy-scale (similar to kpc) regions. These observations represent the first step towards a census of the major PDR <b>cooling</b> <b>lines</b> in typical SMGs that will be attainable with ALMA, enabling detailed modelling to probe the global properties of the star formation and the evolutionary status of SMGs...|$|R
