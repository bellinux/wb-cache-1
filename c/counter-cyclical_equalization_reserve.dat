We perform an extensive simulation study to compare {{the performance of the}} company with and without <b>equalization</b> <b>reserves</b> for several standard profitability measures. <b>Equalization</b> <b>reserves</b> turn out to be beneficial for shareholders in terms of the resulting expected Sharpe ratio and also with respect to the value of the call option on assets at some reasonably large maturity time. Moreover, the expected total discounted tax payments are not smaller when using <b>equalization</b> <b>reserves.</b> The results are robust with respect to model parameters such as interest rate, time horizon, cost of raising capital and business cycle dynamics...|$|R

40|$|In {{a series}} of papers Pentikainen and {{coworkers}} have examined insurance cycles and their consequences for the solvency of insurers and <b>equalization</b> <b>reserves.</b> In a recent contribution, Taylor analyzed the underwriting cycles by means of differential equations, describing more or less deterministic behavior of the cycle. The aim of the present contribution is to give a general framework which {{can be applied to}} describe these cycles in a stochastic way. The advantage of our approach {{lies in the fact that}} we obtain analytical expressions for solvency margins and that we are able to separate the effects of pure solvency and the effect of cyclic behavior. In other words, a clear distinction is made between the classical idea of solvency and the <b>equalization</b> <b>reserves</b> due to cyclic trends.

40|$|A {{traditional}} {{method of}} dealing with solvency and <b>equalization</b> <b>reserves</b> in insurance is {{to make use of}} the classical ruin probability models. An analogy of a well-known physical model, known as the Feynman Path-integrals for imaginary times, is introduced in order to model the solvency of an insurance portfolio incorporating cycles. The aim is to construct a probabilistic model describing probability densities for the surplus of a portfolio in such a way that the classical trajectory satisfying a 2 nd order differential equation is obtained as an expected trajectory. The advantage of this approach is that analytical expressions can be obtained for solvency margins and that the effects of pure solvency and the effect of cyclic behavior can be separated. In other words, a clear distinction is made between the classical idea of solvency and the <b>equalization</b> <b>reserves</b> due to cyclic trends.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{implications}} of the Swedish tax reform of 1994, by explicitly modeling some unusual features of the tax code such as the Annell deduction and the tax <b>equalization</b> <b>reserve</b> (SURV). The paper is about the effects of tax policy on corporate investment and financial structure. Financial preferences are derived using pairwise comparisons, and the weighted average cost of capital is evaluated. This is done by allowing for endogenous adjustment in the firm's financial choices. This paper demonstrates how theoretical and numerical analysis can be combined to evaluate the overall effects of simultaneous changes in several tax parameters. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a comprehensive overview of existing methods of mitigating double taxation of corporate income within a standard {{cost of capital}} model. Two of the most well-known and most utilized methods, the imputation and the split rate systems, do not mitigate double taxation in corporations where the marginal investment is financed with retained earnings. However, all methods are effective when the marginal investment is financed with new share issues. The corporate tax rate, fiscal allowances, allocation to periodization funds and allocation to tax <b>equalization</b> <b>reserves</b> (or allowance for corporate equity) are effective instruments, independent {{of the sources of}} financing. The paper also discusses why so many different methods have been employed in mitigating double taxation. Corporate Taxation; Double Taxation; Cost of Capital...|$|R
40|$|This study {{attempts}} {{to determine the}} impact of the reclassification on income smoothing practices by Islamic banks in Malaysia through loss provisions. It is well acknowledged that Islamic banks set up an allowance for loss provisions in order to absorb any future losses. However, alternative mechanisms, such as Profit <b>Equalization</b> <b>Reserve</b> (PER) and Investment Risk Reserve (IRR) instead of loss provisions, are used to smooth income. This study determines whether the exercise by Islamic banks in Malaysia to reclassify Islamic deposits to investment accounts after the enacted Islamic Financial Service Act (2013), may have caused unintended consequences in less profit payout to investment account holders. The results do not indicate any unintended consequences of less profit payout to investment account holders from the present exercise by the Islamic banks in Malaysia to distinguish Islamic deposits from investment accounts...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} the conventional and mudharabah deposit rates of Malaysian banks in two separate periods — between January 1996 and September 2004, and between October 2004 and June 2011 — which signify the implementation of a framework for calculating the Islamic bank deposit rate and the profit <b>equalization</b> <b>reserve</b> (PER). Employing the autoregressive distributed lagged (ARDL) approach, this study finds the two rates to be cointegrated in the first period similar to previous findings. However, for the second period, there is largely no evidence of a long-term relationship. The significance of this finding is that in the second period, when Islamic banks employ a regulated PER as a displacement risk mitigating mechanism, Islamic banks do not benchmark against conventional rates. They possibly engage in income smoothing for economic efficiency or for signalling purposes. An important policy implication is that PER and any type of reserve to smooth income, that is regulated, may be prescribed as it may have a positive behavioural effect...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{investment}} risk reserve (IRR) {{is key to}} covering potential losses on assets invested with investment account holders (IAH) funds, and profit <b>equalization</b> <b>reserve</b> (PER) is needed to smooth the returns, so that a desired return to IAH can be provided {{in the face of}} volatility in asset returns, and thereby help manage the level of displaced commercial risk (DCR); but the relationship between PER/IRR and DCR is complex. Certain minimum amounts are needed to ensure that a targeted risk return combination can be provided to the IAH with a high probability, even if on some rare occasions asset return may turn negative, requiring the use of IRR to offsetthe losses, and some PER to ensure a market related return to IAH. Since a variety of combinations of PER and IRR can yield a specific targeted return, the appropriate combination will have to be decided by IIFS management based on the expectations of the likely usage of these reserves in the future...|$|R

40|$|The {{intent of}} this article is to {{introduce}} the topic of both Unexpired Risk Reserve and loss Reserving, especially of the Incurred but not reported reserves (IBNR). We will focus on the purpose, common definitions and basic principles. We will explore the common techniques used by practicing actuaries in estimating of Unexpired Risk Reserve and loss reserves. Unexpired Risk Reserve is the present value of loss and expense payments to be provided for by premiums covering the period from the valuation date to expiry on all contracts in force on the valuation date. A loss reserve is a provision for an insurer’s liability for claims. Loss reserving is a major challenge to the casualty actuary because the estimation process involves not only complex technical tasks but considerable judgment as well. This are a critical point, as the actual financial reserves in the accounts has a direct impact on shareholder’s equity, solvency, and also on underwriting profit. reserves for unexpired risks, <b>equalization</b> loss <b>reserves,</b> outstanding loss reserves, IBNR, claim rate, average cost per claim method, run-off triangle...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the {{relationship}} between Islamic bank margin (BM) and its determinants. It also compares the BM behavior of Islamic and conventional banks in the Indonesian dual banking system. Design/methodology/approach – The paper employs a time series approach under the dealership framework of Ho and Saunders. The autoregressive distributed lag model is used to inspect cointegration between BM and its determinants for the period of January 1996 to February 2006 of five sample banks (two Islamic banks and three conventional banks). Findings – The result confirms that there exists a long-running relationship between the Islamic BM and its determinants. In particular, as interest rate volatility increases, Islamic BM responds negatively while that of conventional banks responds positively. The findings differ from most of the other studies as they found a positive relationship between BM and interest rate volatility. This paper also shows that the margin behavior changes as the basis of bank operations changes from conventional to Islamic principles. Research limitations/implications – The paper uses a relatively small sample of three (out of 150) conventional banks as a comparison to two sample Islamic banks. However, as they come from the same peer with the Islamic banks, it is believed that the finding is valid. Islamic banks in Indonesia are not remote from the interest rate volatility in their presence under a dual banking system. It is the displaced commercial risk that threatens Islamic banking profitability in a changing market interest rate situation. Practical implications – Under a dual banking system, the stability of interest rates and the financial system is of great importance for the policy maker in developing the Islamic banking industry in Indonesia. As long as the BM is still a major source of income to the Islamic banks, it is necessary for Islamic banks to have prudent risk management to mitigate the negative effect of displaced commercial risk and maintain its profitability. Implementation of profit <b>equalization</b> <b>reserves</b> concept is a possible measure for Islamic banks to shield their operation. Originality/value – This paper is believed to be the first study on Islamic BM behavior in Indonesia. It is expected to provide useful information for policy makers and Islamic bank management to develop a sound and profitable Islamic banking industry in Indonesia.

40|$|Islamic banking {{deposits}} {{are fundamentally}} structured {{in a different}} way than the conventional banking deposits. Each type of Islamic banking deposits, such as savings, demand, and timed deposits, is devised using the approved Shari’ah contracts such as qard, wadiah, murabahah, and mudarabah. These contracts are opposed to the conventional concepts, as they are based on the concept of a ‘lender-borrower’ relationship. In addition, the Shari’ah-approved contracts are unique as they feature a different nature of risk and return. This is especially the case for mudarabah contracts (henceforth referred to as profit-sharing contracts). The uniqueness of profit-sharing contracts in deposit products has been given due recognition in theory and also in practice, as most of the Islamic banks in Malaysia offered this product. In addition, the unique features and characteristics of profit-sharing based deposit accounts are also highlighted in the prudential standards issued by prominent regulatory bodies such as AAOIFI and IFSB which, have been adopted by the Bank Negara Malaysia (Central Bank of Malaysia). Nevertheless, it is argued by many Islamic banks practitioners, especially in Malaysia, that the concept of profit-sharing in deposits products is not practical in reality, because the depositors do not behave according to, nor accept the principles that have been laid down in the Shari’ah. Thus it is argued that both the depositors and the Islamic bankers have treated the product similar to any other conventional banking deposits products. The main aim of this study, hence, is to explore and examine the level of awareness, knowledge, perceptions, and attitude of the Islamic banking depositors in Malaysia towards characteristics of profit-sharing deposits accounts in accordance with the fundamental Shari’ah principles but also the regulations prevailing. In addition, this research also attempts to explore the significant determinant factors that encourage the depositors to engage with Islamic banking deposits accounts in general and profit-sharing deposits accounts in particular. In fulfilling the aim of the study, primary data collection research was adopted through a survey questionnaire technique. The questionnaires were distributed to eight Islamic banks representing various types of Islamic banks in Kuala Lumpur and Selangor. The questionnaire asked various pertinent questions, which intended to elicit the depositors’ opinions, perceptions, and attitudes towards the unique characteristics of profit-sharing contract as specified in Shari’ah muamalah principles. The characteristics among others are: (i) concept of uncertain deposits returns; (ii) concept of non-guarantee for the deposits; (iii) concept of profit <b>equalization</b> <b>reserve.</b> A total 649 of the returned questionnaires were complete and fit for analysis purpose. The data were analysed using various statistical analysis techniques ranging from simple frequency distribution analysis to the more advanced analyses such as non-parametric statistical analysis, factor analysis, and logistic regression. In general, {{the results of the study}} show that the level of awareness of the need to have Islamic banking deposits accounts because of religious reasons is considered as high among the Malaysian depositors. Nevertheless, the results also indicate that a high level of awareness is not being translated into a high level of understanding concerning the objectives of the products which are structured in accordance to the Shari’ah-compliant contracts. This can be seen in the major findings of this study: the characteristics of profit-sharing contracts, which arguably are the most desirable Shari’ah-compliant contracts, are not acceptable to the depositors. This indirectly implies that they are still strongly influenced by the nature of conventional banking products. In addition, the logistics regression results further proved that related factors (‘financial services’ and ‘income’) emerged as the main determinants in creating demand for profit-sharing deposits accounts. The results of the research should draw the attention of the Islamic bankers and also the regulators to finding ways for improving the level of understanding among the depositors. However, the critical successful factor in educating the depositors is highly dependent on the level of knowledge exhibited by the Islamic bankers themselves, which can be a real concern as highlighted by the findings of this study. ...|$|R
