500|$|In many of Shinkai's films, sad endings {{resulting}} from misunderstandings and unrequited feelings are common. According to Shinkai, his stories {{are intended to}} encourage teenagers as they learn to cope with these commonplace experiences. In an interview, {{he admitted that he}} had been accustomed to being turned down by women, and felt that his stories were encouraging because his characters <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>try,</b> despite being unsuccessful at love. The Garden of Words also illustrated how people do not mature as linearly or elegantly as we often assume. Shinkai himself could relate with Yukari in not feeling as smart or mature at age 27, stating, [...] "We're all still just children at age 27," [...] a point that voice actress Kana Hanazawa also agreed with.|$|E

500|$|After Lwaxana and Timicin {{spend an}} evening together, {{he tries to}} explain the custom of the Resolution. [...] He tells her that a fixed age had to be {{selected}} by the Kaelons because just randomly choosing a time to die would be heartless. Lwaxana finds the practice barbaric and refuses to accept the Kaelon tradition. [...] She tells Timicin how a Betazed woman on her planet successfully fought the tradition of wearing ornate wigs that contained live, captive birds. [...] It only took one courageous woman {{to step forward and}} end this cruel tradition. [...] Lwaxana also compares Timicin's plans to end his life with his research to save his star. If it is Timicin's time to die, Lwaxana argues, perhaps it is also time for his star to die as well, so why should he <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> to prevent it? Timicin thinks about what Lwaxana has told him.|$|E
500|$|On 21 April 2010, the Russian Supreme Court {{ordered the}} Moscow City Court {{to hear an}} appeal in an ongoing Katyn legal case. A civil rights group, Memorial, said the ruling {{could lead to a}} court {{decision}} to open up secret documents providing details about the killings of thousands of Polish officers. On 8 May 2010, Russia handed over to Poland 67 volumes from [...] "criminal case No. 159", launched in the 1990s to investigate the Soviet-era mass killings of Polish officers. Copies of these volumes, each comprising about 250 pages, were packed in six boxes. With each box weighing approximately , the total weight of all the documents stood at about [...] Russian President Dmitry Medvedev handed one of the volumes to the acting Polish president, Bronislaw Komorowski. Medvedev and Komorowski agreed that the two states should <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> to reveal the truth about the tragedy. The Russian president reiterated that Russia would continue to declassify documents on the Katyn massacre. The acting Polish president said that Russia's move might lay a good foundation for improving bilateral relations.|$|E

A player can [...] "break" [...] a mill by moving one of his pieces out of an existing mill, then moving it back to form the same mill a second time (or any number of times), each time removing one of his opponent's men. The act of removing an opponent's man is sometimes called [...] "pounding" [...] the opponent. When one player {{has been reduced to}} three men, phase three begins.|$|E

2500|$|On 8 October Asquith {{wrote to}} Law {{suggesting}} an informal {{meeting of the}} two party leaders, which Law accepted. The two met at Cherkley Court, the home of Law's ally Sir Max Aitken MP (later Lord Beaverbrook), on 14 October. The meeting lasted an hour, and Law told Asquith that he would <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> to have Parliament dissolved, and that in any ensuing election the Unionists would accept the result even if it went against them. Law later expressed his fear to Lansdowne that Asquith would persuade the Irish Nationalists to accept Home Rule with the exclusion of four Ulster counties. Carson would not accept this, requiring all six counties to be excluded, and such a move might split the Unionists. Law knew that Asquith was unlikely to consent to a general election, since he would almost certainly lose it, and that any attempt to pass the Home Rule Bill [...] "without reference to the electorate" [...] would lead to civil disturbance. As such, Asquith was stuck [...] "between {{a rock and a}} hard place" [...] and was sure to negotiate.|$|E
2500|$|During World War II, Ohio State {{was one of}} the few colleges able {{to field}} a marching band for every home game. The band was able to field 100 to 120 musicians {{throughout}} the war. Because the band was still under ROTC control, women were not allowed to perform. The band was open to alumni members of the band, woodwind players, vocalists, high school students, even strangers on the street who expressed interest. The morale with which this highly volunteer band helped to cheer on Ohio State football was during a time when spirits on the home front were at a low. By the early 1950s, the Department of Defense issued much more stringent rules about what courses and activities constitute eligible curriculum for the ROTC program. The Marching Band was no longer an eligible activity, and in 1952, the Marching Band officially ended ties with the ROTC department. Cadets in the band could <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> out and participate in band, but they would no longer receive ROTC credit. Once the Marching Band separated from ROTC control, the band was more free to experiment with show themes and music genres, culminating in the band's 1965 performance of [...] "Hang On, Sloopy!". After the extremely positive response for [...] "Sloopy", the band decided to venture into more modern and topical styles of music.|$|E

6000|$|Don't imagine for {{a moment}} that I don't feel the full horror of my having had to wait till now, when I can avail myself of this aid, to acknowledge, as the poor pale pettifogging term has it, the receipt from you of inexpressibly splendid bounties. I won't attempt to explain or expatiate--about this abject failure of utterance: the idea of [...] "explaining" [...] {{anything}} to you in these days, or of any expatiation that isn't exclusively that of your own genius upon your own adventures and impressions! I think the reason why I have been so baffled, in a word, is that all my powers of being anything else have gone to living upon your two magnificent letters, the one from Verdun, and the one after your second visit there; which gave me matter of experience and appropriation to which I have done the fullest honour. Your whole record is sublime, and the interest and the beauty and the terror of it all have again and again called me back to it. I have ventured to share it, {{for the good of the}} cause and the glory of the connection (mine,) with two or three select others--this I candidly confess to you--one of whom was dear Howard, absolutely as dear as ever through everything, and whom I all but reduced to floods of tears, tears of understanding and sympathy. I know them at last, your incomparable pages, by heart--and thus it is really that I feel qualified to speak to you of them. With the two sublimities in question, or between them, came of course also the couple of other favours, enclosing me, pressing back upon me, my attempted contribution to your Paris labour: to which perversity I have had to bow my head. I was very sorry to be so forced, but even while cursing and gnashing my teeth I got your post-office order cashed, and the money is, God knows, assistingly spendable here! Another pang was your mention of Jean du Breuil's death.... I didn't know him, had never seen him; but your account of the admirable manner of his end makes one feel that one would like even to have just beheld him. We are in the midst, the very midst, of histories of that sort, miserable and terrible, here too; the Neuve Chapelle business, from a strange, in the sense of being a pretty false, glamour at first flung about which we are gradually recovering, seems to have taken a hideous toll of officers, and other distressing legends (legends of mistake and confusion) are somehow overgrowing it too. But painful particulars are not what I want to give you--of anything; you are up to your neck in your own, and I had much rather pick my steps to the clear places, so far as there be any such! I <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> and keep my own existence one, so far as I may--a place clear of the last accablement, I mean: apparently what it comes to is that it's [...] "full up" [...] with the last but one.|$|E
