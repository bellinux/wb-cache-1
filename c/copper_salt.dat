40|$|Copper {{formulations}} and <b>copper</b> <b>salts</b> are {{the most}} frequently used plant protection agents. Therefore copper concentrations in agriculture soils can easily exceed limit emission value for copper (60 mg Cu/kg for the dry soil), which migh already affect the behavior and consequently the ecological function of soil organisms. Data from literature show that different copper formulations and different salts have different impact on animals. The aim of our study was to find out which copper formulations or <b>copper</b> <b>salts</b> have the greatest impact on the avoidance behavior of earthworms. Avoidance behaviour was studied by the rapid avoidance test on earthworms Eisenia Andrei (ISO 17512 - 1). We estimated EC 50 values for different <b>copper</b> furmulations and <b>salts</b> used. In the study two kinds of <b>copper</b> <b>salts</b> (CuCl 2 * 2 H 2 O and CuSO 4 * 5 H 2 O) and three most frequently applied cooper formulations in Slovenia were used (Cuprablau Z, Cuprablau Z Ultra and Champion). Salts have high solubility, while copper formulations have low solubility and create suspension. To increase water solubility and for better effect of active substance copper formulations usually contain different additives. We found out that avoidance behaviour is more prominent in the soil with <b>copper</b> <b>salts</b> than in the soil with copper formulations, among which differences were also found. The range of <b>copper</b> formulations and <b>salts</b> sorted from the lowest to highest calculated EC 50 values is: CuCl 2 * 2 H 2 O < CuSO 4 * 5 H 2 O < Champion < Cuprablau Z Ultra < Cuprablau Z...|$|R
