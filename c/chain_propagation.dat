We develop a static analysis technique, EDP, that analyzes how file systems and storage device drivers propagate error codes. Running our EDP analysis on all file systems and 3 major storage device drivers in Linux 2. 6, we find that errors are often incorrectly propagated; 1153 calls (13 %) drop an error code without handling it. We perform a set of analyses to rank the robustness of each subsystem based on the completeness of its error propagation; we find that many popular file systems are less robust than other available choices. We confirm that write errors are neglected more often than read errors. We also find that many violations are not cornercase mistakes, but perhaps intentional choices.

50|$|Another key {{characteristic}} is {{that the}} rate of initiation (meaning the dormant chemical species generates the active chain propagating species) must be much faster than the rate of <b>chain</b> <b>propagation.</b> This would allow all of the active species to form before <b>chain</b> <b>propagation</b> begins so all of the chains grow at the same rate (the rate of propagation). Conversely, if initiation is much slower than <b>chain</b> <b>propagation</b> (i.e. initiation is the rate determining step) then the active species will form at different points during the reaction leading to wider distribution between the individual polymer chains degree of polymerization (or chain length) and molecular weight (figure 1 and 2).|$|E

Recent work has shown that file systems are especially unreliablewhen the underlying disk system does not behave as expected [20]. Specifically, many modern commodity filesystems, such as Linux ext 3 [31], ReiserFS [23], IBM's JFS [1], and Windows NTFS [27], all have serious bugsand inconsistencies in how they handle errors from the storage system. However, the question remains unan-swered as to why these fault-handling bugs are present...|$|R

50|$|Any surface {{reaction}} {{can be described}} as following one of these mechanisms, or some combination of these mechanisms. In addition, all of these above mechanisms can occur in reverse. In general, the pathway for a reaction on a surface is as follows. First the reactants adsorb onto the surface. Through a series of bonds being formed and being broken, adsorbed intermediates are produced and destroyed. Then the final product(s) is produced and it desorbs from the solid. Most metal {{surface reaction}} occur by <b>chain</b> <b>propagation.</b>|$|E

The free radical mechanism {{is one of the first}} methods to be used. Free radicals are very reactive atoms or molecules that have unpaired electrons. Taking the polymerization of ethylene as an example, the free radical mechanism can be divided into three stages: chain initiation, <b>chain</b> <b>propagation,</b> and chain termination.|$|E

The electrosynthesis mechanism underlying the electrochemical oxidation of oAP {{has been investigated}} by in situ (Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) and Electrochemical Quartz Crystal Microbalance (EQCM)) and ex situ (X ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS)) techniques. In depth studies were performed through the characterization of polymeric layers grown up to 5, 8 and 125 voltammetric cycles. Following the initial formation of radical cations and their coupling, an induction period was noticed during which no net mass deposition occurs but rather a chemical rearrangement of adsorbed linear dimers to give aminophenoxazine like closed structures. Our experimental findings evidenced the necessity to completely reduce the linear dimer {{in order to allow}} its cyclization which is preliminary to polymer formation. We assumed that aminophenoxazine units initiate polymerization and then the addition of oxidized monomers gradually becomes the predominant route for polymer <b>chains</b> <b>propagation.</b> After 125 cycles a thickness of about 54 - 62 nm was estimated by EQCM. XPS investigation supported the presence of linear dimers during the induction period and allowed to attribute unambiguously a phenazine-like closed structure to the finite film.
