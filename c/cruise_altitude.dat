5|$|After launch, {{the missile}} was guided towards the target {{location}} {{as determined by}} the ship using a three-axis Attitude Reference Assembly (ATA) in an AN/DSQ-44 guidance section. The ATA was less accurate than a full-fledged inertial system, but good enough for Harpoon's range. For stabilization and control, the AGM-84A had four fixed cruciform wings (3x BSU-42/B, 1x BSU-43/B) and four movable BSU-44/B tail fins. The missile flew at a low <b>cruise</b> <b>altitude</b> and at a predetermined distance from the expected target position, its AN/DSQ-28 J-band active radar seeker in the nose was activated to acquire and lock on the target. The radar switch-on distance could be set to lower or higher values, the former requiring a more precisely-known target location but reducing the risk to be defeated by enemy Electronic Counter Measures (ECM).|$|E
25|$|Apart from ramjet technology, China has {{successfully}} developed some supersonic anti-ship missiles that can fly above Mach 1.0 (as most anti-ship missiles currently fly at Mach 0.9). The C-101, {{also known as}} FL-2 features a smaller and thinner body of the original SS-N-2 Styx, but it can fly at speeds around Mach 1.7. It can attack targets at 40km. However, like the much larger C-301, its <b>cruise</b> <b>altitude</b> is also at 50 meters and thus prone to interception in comparison to faster SS-N-22 with lower <b>cruise</b> <b>altitude.</b> As a result, both C-101 and C-301 saw very little service. The YJ83 also possesses some supersonic attack capabilities.|$|E
25|$|Earlier Chinese {{missiles}} of such capability {{from before}} the 1990s include the C-301 (also known as HY-3). With its four ramjet engines, it has a range of 130km and a speed greater than Mach 2.5. Though a success, the missile {{is far from being}} as potent as the SS-N-22, mainly because it can fly only at a higher <b>cruise</b> <b>altitude</b> of 50 m, rather than cruising at wave tops (such as the 20 m <b>cruise</b> <b>altitude</b> of SS-N-22), so it is easier to intercept in comparison to SS-N-22. the PLAN's air force has also purchased both the KH31 ramjet supersonic missile and the AS-20 turbojet subsonic anti-ship missile from Russia to arm its fighters.|$|E
50|$|Paielli’s 2000 model corroborated {{an earlier}} 1997 model by Patlovany showing in Figure 1 that zero {{altitude}} error by pilots obeying the hemispherical <b>cruising</b> <b>altitude</b> rules resulted in six times more mid-air collisions than random <b>cruising</b> <b>altitude</b> non compliance. Similarly, Patlovany’s computer model {{test of the}} Altimeter-Compass <b>Cruising</b> <b>Altitude</b> Rule (ACCAR) with zero piloting altitude error (a linear <b>cruising</b> <b>altitude</b> rule {{similar to the one}} recommended by Paielli), resulted in about 60% of the mid-air collisions counted from random altitude non compliance, or 10 times fewer collisions than the internationally accepted hemispherical <b>cruising</b> <b>altitude</b> rules. In other words, Patlovany’s ACCAR alternative and Paielli’s linear <b>cruising</b> <b>altitude</b> rule would reduce cruising midair collisions between 10 and 33 times, compared to the currently recognized, and internationally required, hemispherical <b>cruising</b> <b>altitude</b> rules, which institutionalize the navigation paradox on a worldwide basis.|$|R

25|$|Flight 185 {{remained}} {{level at}} FL350 until it started a rapid and nearly vertical dive around 16:12. While descending through , {{parts of the}} aircraft, including a great extent of the tail section, started to separate from the aircraft's fuselage due to high forces arising from the nearly supersonic dive. Seconds later, the aircraft impacted the Musi River, near Palembang, Sumatra, killing all 104 people on board. The time it took the aircraft to dive from <b>cruise</b> <b>altitude</b> to the river was less than one minute.

25|$|The APU (auxiliary power unit) {{does not}} need to supply bleed air when the main engines are not operating. Aerodynamics are {{improved}} {{due to the lack of}} bleed air vent holes on the wings. By driving cabin air supply compressors at the minimum required speed, no energy wasting modulating valves are required. High-temperature, high-pressure air cycle machine (ACM) packs can be replaced with low temperature, low-pressure packs to increase efficiency. At <b>cruise</b> <b>altitude,</b> where most aircraft spend the majority of their time and burn the majority of their fuel, the ACM packs can be bypassed entirely, saving even more energy. Since no bleed air is taken from the engines for the cabin, the potential of engine oil contamination of the cabin air supply is eliminated.|$|E

The AI-20s drove four-bladed variable pitch reversible props with a diameter of 4.5 meters (14 feet 9 inches), featuring prominent propeller spinners, and hydraulic actuation for prop pitch. The engines were mounted above the wing and featured integrated fire extinguishers. The engines were started with electric motors, the power for the motors being provided by a ground cart.|$|E
