5|$|During 1960, {{the list}} of {{manufacturers}} planning to build COBOL compilers grew. By September, five more manufacturers had joined CODASYL (Bendix, <b>Control</b> <b>Data</b> Corporation, General Electric (GE), National Cash Register and Philco), and all represented manufacturers had announced COBOL compilers. GE and IBM planned to integrate COBOL into their own languages, GECOM and COMTRAN, respectively. In contrast, International Computers and Tabulators planned to replace their language, CODEL, with COBOL.|$|E
5|$|Minnesota {{became a}} center of {{technology}} after World War II. Engineering Research Associates was formed in 1946 to develop computers for the United States Navy. It later merged with Remington Rand, and then became Sperry Rand. William Norris left Sperry in 1957 to form <b>Control</b> <b>Data</b> Corporation (CDC). Cray Research was formed when Seymour Cray left CDC to form his own company. Medical device maker Medtronic also started business in the Twin Cities in 1949.|$|E

He was a non-executive director of the energy company Centrica from March 2003 until May 2009. He is former chairman of the governors at Henley Management College. He became a council member of the ScotchWhiskyAssociation in 2001 and served as its chairman from 2008 until 2011. During 2012 {{he was a member of}} David Cameron's Business Advisory Group.

5|$|New {{industry}} {{came from}} iron ore, {{discovered in the}} north, mined relatively easily from open pits, and shipped to Great Lakes steel mills from the ports at Duluth and Two Harbors. Economic development and social changes led to an expanded role for state government and a population shift from rural areas to cities. The Great Depression brought layoffs in mining and tension in labor relations but New Deal programs helped the state. After World War II, Minnesota became known for technology, fueled by early computer companies Sperry Rand, <b>Control</b> <b>Data</b> and Cray. The Twin Cities also became a regional center for the arts with cultural {{institutions such as the}} Guthrie Theater, Minnesota Orchestra, and the Walker Art Center.|$|E

Like many commercial timesharing systems, its interface was {{an extension of the}} Dartmouth BASIC operating systems, one of the pioneering efforts in timesharing and programming languages. In the late 1970s, <b>Control</b> <b>Data</b> and the University of Illinois {{developed the}} PLATO operating system, which used plasma panel displays and long-distance time sharing networks.

25|$|Existing {{infrared}} {{remote controls}} {{can be used}} to control PC applications. Any application that supports shortcut keys can be controlled via IR remote controls from other home devices (TV, VCR, AC). This is widely used with multimedia applications for PC based home theatre systems. For this to work, one needs a device that decodes IR remote <b>control</b> <b>data</b> signals and a PC application that communicates to this device connected to PC. Connection can be made via serial port, USB port or motherboard IrDA connector. Such devices are commercially available but can be homemade using low-cost micro controllers. LIRC (Linux IR Remote control) and WinLIRC (for Windows) are software packages developed for the purpose of controlling PC using TV remote and can be also used for homebrew remote with lesser modification.|$|E
