40|$|We take {{advantage}} of a quasi-natural experiment in Peru in which a privatized telecommunications company was required by the government to randomly install and <b>operate</b> public <b>pay</b> <b>phones</b> in small rural towns throughout the country. Using an especially designed household survey for a representative sample of rural towns, we are able to link access to telephone services with household income. We find that, regardless of income measurement, most characteristics of public telephone use are positively linked with income. Remarkably, the benefits are given at both non-farm and farm income levels. The findings hold when using propensity score matching methods.

5000|$|A clear box is an {{amplifier}} used by phreaks to use post-pay <b>pay</b> <b>phones</b> without <b>paying.</b> In some locations, especially {{rural areas}} in the United States and Canada, <b>pay</b> <b>phones</b> were configured for [...] "post-pay" [...] operation. In this mode, the handset microphone is muted until payment is made. The user of a post-pay <b>pay</b> <b>phone</b> would dial first, wait until the called party answered, {{and at that point}} the user would be prompted to insert the coins. Upon receiving the correct payment for the call, the <b>pay</b> <b>phone</b> would then connect the microphone and allow the caller to speak. An artifact of this scheme was that the called party usually heard the ACTS tones produced by the <b>pay</b> <b>phone</b> upon coin deposit.|$|R

40|$|Many times {{technological}} developments add to and improve {{what we already}} have, thereby increasing the welfare of society. There are also examples, both historic and present, where {{technological developments}} imply negative welfare consequences {{for at least some}} part of society. The relative size of that part differs from case to case, as does the relative harm in each situation. This paper outlines some of the historic examples of decreased welfare due to technological improvements, and discusses the concept in relation to the case of the disappearing <b>pay</b> <b>phone,</b> or public telephone. <b>Pay</b> <b>phones</b> have been in use since the late nineteenth century (Oslin, 1992). Inevitably with the invention of cellular phones, the demand for <b>pay</b> <b>phones</b> decreased. In turn, profits decreased, leading phone companies to eradicate millions of <b>pay</b> <b>phones</b> throughout the United States. Many people prefer to use <b>pay</b> <b>phones,</b> but this is becoming increasingly inconvenient and impractical. The second half of this paper presents an economic model that may be useful in evaluating these welfare consequences...|$|R

Toll-free numbers in Brazil can be accessed from any telephone (by default) in Brazil, with many exceptions. They can be accessed from outside Brazil only with a calling service (such as voice-over-Internet services or MCI Worldcom calling service) that accesses numbers from within the called country. Many toll-free numbers are not available from cell phones (usually blocked by the cell phone provider rather than the provider of the toll-free number {{in an effort to}} prevent low-price competition from calling card providers). Some toll-free numbers are not available from phones listed by the owner of the number, including many payphones. For example, the MCI Worldphone calling service blocks usage from the <b>pay</b> <b>phones</b> in international airports (Rio and São Paulo) and many downtown <b>pay</b> <b>phones</b> due to [...] "excessive fraud" [...] from those phones (July 2003). In addition, Brazil has a system of regular and international <b>pay</b> <b>phones</b> (designated with the symbol [...] "DDD"). Toll-free numbers to international calling plans can be reliably used from non-DDD <b>pay</b> <b>phones,</b> as of 2005.|$|R

50|$|These {{toll-free}} numbers can {{normally be}} called from any phone in Canada or the U.S., though the owner (and sometimes the provider) can put restrictions on their use.

Some are not accessible from <b>pay</b> <b>phones.</b> Calls from <b>pay</b> <b>phones</b> assess the toll-free owner {{an additional fee}} in the U.S. as mandated by the FCC.

Examples of these services are the MCI Worldphone international calling card and any US-based Internet telephone gateway.
