On snowy ones they are far more complex: but on rock summits there are three distinct forms of attached cloud in serene weather; the first that of <b>cloud</b> <b>veil</b> laid over them, and falling in folds through their ravines, (the obliquely descending clouds of the entering chorus in Aristophanes); secondly, the ascending cloud, which develops itself loosely and independently as it rises, and does not attach itself to the hill-side, while the falling veil cloud clings to it close all the way down;--and lastly the throned cloud, which rests indeed on the mountain summit, with its base, but rises high above into the sky, continually changing its outlines, but holding its seat perhaps all day long.|$|E

60|$|Hare {{watched the}} glimmering {{lights of the}} village vanish one by one, like Jack-o'-lanterns. The horses kept a steady, even trot on into the huge windy hall of the desert night.

As he crawled under the blankets Naab had spread for him his hand {{came into contact with}} a polished metal surface cold as ice. It was his rifle. Naab had placed it under the blankets. Fingering the rifle Hare found the spring opening {{on the right side of}} the breech, and, pressing it down, he felt the round head of a cartridge. Naab had loaded the weapon, he had placed it where Hare's hand must find it, yet he had not spoken of it. Hare did not stop to reason with his first impulse. Without a word, with silent insistence, disregarding his shattered health, August Naab had given him a man's part to play. The full meaning lifted Hare out of his self-abasement; once more he felt himself a man.|$|R

60|$|The {{mountains}} were a never-ceasing marvel. Sometimes {{they rose}} straight {{up out of}} the lake, and towered aloft and overshadowed our pygmy steamer with their prodigious bulk in the most impressive way. Not snow-clad mountains, these, yet they climbed high enough toward the sky to meet the <b>clouds</b> and <b>veil</b> their foreheads in them. They were not barren and repulsive, but clothed in green, and restful and pleasant to the eye. And they were so almost straight-up-and-down, sometimes, that one could not imagine a man being able to keep his footing upon such a surface, yet there are paths, and the Swiss people go up and down them every day.|$|R
50|$|Immediately {{below the}} <b>cloud</b> sheath <b>veiling</b> the summit, Poilar and his tattered and {{decimated}} team stumble upon an Arcadia-like domain whose inhabitants are not transformed but ageless - they {{have discovered a}} Fountain of Youth.

He reveals that his own son (Poilar's father) did not heed this advice, and together with all his surviving companions had sought obliteration in the Fountain of Youth on the return trip. Indeed, the kingdoms on the highest level of the mountain seem to be populated mostly by those who had been to the summit.|$|R
60|$|AND now let the reader, {{passing over}} some {{short period of}} time, be {{introduced}} to our happy circle. Adrian, Idris and I, were established in Windsor Castle; Lord Raymond and my sister, inhabited a house which the former had built on {{the borders of the}} Great Park, near Perdita's cottage, as was still named the low-roofed abode, where we two, poor even in hope, had each received the assurance of our felicity. We had our separate occupations and our common amusements. Sometimes we passed whole days under the leafy covert of the forest with our books and music. This occurred during those rare days in this country, when the sun mounts his etherial throne in unclouded majesty, and the windless atmosphere is as a bath of pellucid and grateful water, wrapping the senses in tranquillity. When the <b>clouds</b> <b>veiled</b> the sky, and the wind scattered them there and here, rending their woof, and strewing its fragments through the aerial plains--then we rode out, and sought new spots of beauty and repose. When the frequent rains shut us within doors, evening recreation followed morning study, ushered in by music and song. Idris had a natural musical talent; and her voice, which had been carefully cultivated, was full and sweet. Raymond and I made a part of the concert, and Adrian and Perdita were devout listeners. Then we were as gay as summer insects, playful as children; we ever met one another with smiles, and read content and joy in each other's countenances. Our prime festivals were held in Perdita's cottage; nor were we ever weary of talking of the past or dreaming of the future. Jealousy and disquiet were unknown among us; nor did a fear or hope of change ever disturb our tranquillity. Others said, We might be happy--we said--We are.|$|R

60|$|It was toward sunset that evening, and Miss Austerly {{was sitting}} well wrapped up on a locker in the cockpit, when the vapor melted and was blown away, as not {{infrequently}} happens {{about that time}} at sea. The dingy <b>clouds</b> that <b>veiled</b> the sky were rent, and a blaze of weird, coppery radiance smote the tumbling seas, which changed under it to smears of incandescent whiteness with ruddy gleams in them, and ridges of flashing green. It was sudden and bewildering, impelling one to hold one's breath. But a more glorious pageant leaped out of the dimness over the starboard hand. Walls of rock that burned with many colors sprang into being, with somber pines streaming upward behind them, and far aloft there were lifted gleaming heights of never-trodden snow whose stainless purity was intensified by their gray and turquoise shadows.|$|R
60|$|That fable is unjust, {{which gives}} the superiority to the sun over the wind.

Or, when the dun <b>clouds</b> thickly <b>veil</b> the sky, while exhaustless stores of rain are poured down, until, the dank earth refusing to imbibe the superabundant moisture, it lies in pools on the surface; when the torch of day seems like a meteor, to be quenched; who has not seen the cloud-stirring north arise, the streaked blue appear, and soon an opening made in the vapours {{in the eye of}} the wind, through which the bright azure shines?

These are measurements of particle size distributions with a laser optical particle counter of the Forward Scattering Spectrometer Probe (FSSP) - 300 type operated on the Russian M- 55 high-altitude research aircraft Geophysica in the tropical upper troposphere and lower stratosphere up to altitudes of 21 km. On 24 and 27 February 1999, ultrathin layers of cirrus clouds were penetrated by Geophysica directly beneath the tropical tropopause at 17 km pressure altitude and temperatures below 190 K. These layers also were concurrently observed by the Ozone Lidar Experiment (OLEX) lidar operating on the lower-flying German DLR Falcon research aircraft. The encountered ultrathin subvisual cloud layers {{can be characterized as}} (1) horizontally extending over several hundred kilometers, (2) persisting for at least 3 hours (but most likely much longer), and (3) having geometrical thicknesses of 100 – 400 m. These cloud layers belong to the geometrically and optically thinnest ever observed. In situ particle size distributions covering diameters between 0. 4 and 23 μm obtained from these layers are juxtaposed with those obtained inside <b>cloud</b> <b>veils</b> around cumulonimbus (Cb) anvils and also with background aerosol measurements {{in the vicinity of the}} clouds. A significant number of particles with size diameters around 10 μm were detected inside these ultrathin subvisible cloud layers. The cloud particle size distribution closely resembles a background aerosol onto which a modal peak between 2 and 17 μm is superimposed. Measurements of particles with sizes above 23 μm could not be obtained since no suitable instrument was available on Geophysica. During the flight of 6 March 1999, upper tropospheric and lower stratospheric background aerosol was measured in the latitude band between 4 °S and 19 °S latitude. The resulting particle number densities along the 56 th meridian exhibit very little latitudinal variation. The concentrations for particles with sizes above 0. 5 μm encountered under these background conditions varied between 0. 1 and 0. 3 particles/cm 3 of air in altitudes between 17 and 21 km...|$|R
