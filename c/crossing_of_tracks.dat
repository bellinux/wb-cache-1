The road from Lynton to Barnstaple crosses here at a low point of the ridge, as did the former Lynton & Barnstaple Railway.

40|$|AbstractIn Japan {{where large}} {{earthquakes}} frequently occur, {{it is important}} to increase the resistibility of railway structures to earthquakes. The authors performed a shaking table test using a full-scale model to evaluate the lateral resistance force <b>of</b> the ballasted <b>track</b> during earthquakes. In this study, the shaking table test was attempted under test conditions under which the sleeper is given the lateral force to induce track buckling. Two kinds <b>of</b> <b>cross</b> sections <b>of</b> ballasted <b>track</b> for the full-scale model were applied: a straight track and a curved track to evaluate the influence of the difference <b>of</b> the <b>cross</b> section <b>of</b> ballasted <b>track</b> on the lateral resistance force. The results of the shaking table test clarified that the lateral resistance force <b>of</b> the ballasted <b>track</b> decreased during shaking, and the lateral sleeper displacement increased significantly by lateral force smaller than the lateral resistance force <b>of</b> the ballasted <b>track</b> after shaking. In addition, it is considered that the influence <b>of</b> the <b>cross</b> section <b>of</b> ballasted <b>track</b> on the lateral ballast resistance force during shaking and after shaking is small...|$|R

30|$|The {{total number}} <b>of</b> <b>crossed</b> rail <b>tracks</b> during {{transgression}} was significantly different {{according to the}} Moment of transgression, Fisher, p <  0.05, the association between the variables being moderate, V 2  =  0.04. The RDs revealed that the <b>crossing</b> <b>of</b> more than one rail track (i.e. two or three) {{was more likely to}} be observed during the closure of the pedestrian gates (Moment 2), whereas crossing in Moment 3 was associated with crossing one rail track. However, the number <b>of</b> <b>crossed</b> unoccupied <b>tracks</b> was similar independently of the moment of transgression (Fisher, ns.), noting that 11.6  % <b>of</b> the pedestrians <b>crossed</b> one unoccupied track after a first train had passed, taking the potential risk <b>of</b> <b>crossing</b> in front <b>of</b> a second train.|$|R

50|$|It {{was also}} during this era that long {{distance}} rail travel became quite popular. The High Street line faced delays {{of up to}} seven hours per day due to the grade level <b>crossing</b> <b>of</b> 10 <b>tracks</b> across High Street at Union Station. To remedy the problem, subway tunnels were built under the tracks. They were dark, and the smell from the horse droppings made the trip unpleasant. From the period of 1863-1892, {{more than a dozen}} horsecar companies set up shop in the city, and total trackage was expanded to 34.5 mi prior to electrification.|$|R

50|$|During the {{occupation}} of the Ruhr in 1923, Neu Isenburg station was commandeered by French troops {{and could not be}} entered by Germans. As many in Isenburg depended on a railway connection, an emergency station was established by a local railway on a siding only 400 metres away from the station in the district of Frankfurt, which was not occupied. It consisted merely of a wooden hut for the sale of tickets and a plank <b>crossing</b> <b>of</b> the <b>track,</b> which ensured a reasonably safe entry and exit. The provisional station only closed with the withdrawal of French troops in September 1924.|$|R
50|$|The S-Bahn {{station has}} four <b>tracks,</b> one <b>of</b> them has no {{platform}} {{and is used}} by through freight trains and two are used by the S-Bahn. The fourth track, which has a platform, serves as a siding. A special feature of the station is that the line between Munich East station (Ostbahnhof) and the junction at the Perlacher Forst cemetery has traffic running on the left, unlike almost all other Deutsche Bahn lines that run on the right. This is because S-Bahn at Munich East station must reverse, and running on the left avoids a time-consuming <b>crossing</b> <b>of</b> the <b>tracks</b> there.|$|R
