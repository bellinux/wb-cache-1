It also includes the remnants of the defunct QUBE interactive TV service. In 1995, the company launched the Southern Tier On-Line Community, a <b>cable</b> <b>modem</b> service later known as Road Runner High Speed Online.

50|$|To {{manage a}} network {{with one or}} more ComControllers and all {{connected}} <b>cable</b> <b>modems,</b> Com21 offered their network management platform, called NMAPS. NMAPS was a proprietary platform using the HP OpenView platform. A typical feature of a Com21 network was that the <b>cable</b> <b>modems</b> didn't get an IP address. A modem was addressed using its MAC address. ComControllers were configured via NMAPS: setting the frequencies for the downstream and upstream signals, define VLANs and enabling the <b>cable</b> <b>modems</b> in one of the created VLANs. Via NMAPS the network managers could specify the speed of the modems, set filtering (e.g. only allowing a specific IP address that could be used behind that modem), etc. NMAPS was only available to run on a Sun server or workstation.|$|R
