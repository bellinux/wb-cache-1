40|$|The use of {{appropriate}} extraction <b>and</b> amplification <b>controls</b> for acellular specimens is not standardized {{in the clinical}} laboratory community. Extraction <b>controls</b> <b>and</b> <b>checks</b> for inhibitors of amplification in cellular specimens are most often accomplished by amplification of an internal human genomic target. This approach is not feasible for acellular specimens, which may contain little or no amplifiable genomic material. Other specimen types, such as stool, frequently contain amplification inhibitors. Failure to test for these inhibitors can result in the reporting of false-negative results. The goal {{of this study was}} to evaluate the use of a T 4 bacteriophage as an extraction <b>and</b> amplification <b>control</b> for acellular specimens. The T 4 bacteriophage assay was evaluated for use as a control in 290 specimens, including cerebrospinal fluid, serum, and filtered stool. Extraction procedures on two automated instruments were assessed, including the Roche MagNAPure Compact (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) and the QIAGEN BioRobot M 48 (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA), along with the manual QIAGEN extraction method. The T 4 bacteriophage can be extracted reliably and reproducibly from cerebral spinal fluid, serum, and filtered stool and, therefore, is useful as both an extraction <b>control</b> <b>and</b> inhibitor <b>check</b> for these specimen sources...|$|R

Congestion levels are computed endogenously. MOLINO computes costs and benefits over multiple periods and the length of the time horizon is flexible. Outputs include equilibrium values of user and social benefits, financial flows and measures of effectiveness such as congestion delays. ...|$|R
