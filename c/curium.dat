5|$|Sulfides, selenides and tellurides of <b>curium</b> {{have been}} {{obtained}} by treating <b>curium</b> with gaseous sulfur, selenium or tellurium in vacuum at elevated temperature. The pnictides of <b>curium</b> of the type CmX are known for the elements nitrogen, phosphorus, arsenic and antimony. They can be prepared by reacting either curium(III) hydride (CmH3) or metallic <b>curium</b> with these elements at elevated temperatures.|$|E
5|$|<b>Curium</b> has no {{biological}} significance. There {{are a few}} {{reports on}} biosorption of Cm3+ by bacteria and archaea, however no evidence for incorporation of <b>curium</b> into them.|$|E
5|$|<b>Curium</b> is a hard, dense, silvery metal with a {{relatively}} high melting point and boiling point for an actinide. Whereas it is paramagnetic at ambient conditions, it becomes antiferromagnetic upon cooling, and other magnetic transitions are also observed for many <b>curium</b> compounds. In compounds, <b>curium</b> usually exhibits valence +3 and sometimes +4, and the +3 valence is predominant in solutions. <b>Curium</b> readily oxidizes, and its oxides are a dominant form of this element. It forms strongly fluorescent complexes with various organic compounds, {{but there is no}} evidence of its incorporation into bacteria and archaea. When introduced into the human body, <b>curium</b> accumulates in the bones, lungs and liver, where it promotes cancer.|$|E
5|$|<b>Curium</b> is a {{transuranic}} radioactive {{chemical element}} with symbol Cm and atomic number 96. This {{element of the}} actinide series was named after Marie and Pierre Curie – both were known for their research on radioactivity. <b>Curium</b> was first intentionally produced and identified in July 1944 by the group of Glenn T. Seaborg at the University of California, Berkeley. The discovery was kept secret and only {{released to the public}} in November 1945. Most <b>curium</b> is produced by bombarding uranium or plutonium with neutrons in nuclear reactors – one tonne of spent nuclear fuel contains about 20grams of <b>curium.</b>|$|E
5|$|The longest-lived isotope of <b>curium,</b> 247Cm, has a {{half-life}} of 15.6 million years. Therefore, any primordial <b>curium,</b> that is <b>curium</b> {{present on}} the Earth during its formation, should have decayed by now, although some of it would be detectable as an extinct radionuclide as an excess of its nearly stable daughter 235U. <b>Curium</b> is produced artificially, in small quantities for research purposes. Furthermore, it occurs in spent nuclear fuel. <b>Curium</b> is present in nature in certain areas used for the atmospheric nuclear weapons tests, which were conducted between 1945 and 1980. So {{the analysis of the}} debris at the testing site of the first U.S. hydrogen bomb, Ivy Mike, (1 November 1952, Enewetak Atoll), beside einsteinium, fermium, plutonium and americium also revealed isotopes of berkelium, californium and <b>curium,</b> in particular 245Cm, 246Cm and smaller quantities of 247Cm, 248Cm and 249Cm. For reasons of military secrecy, this result was published only in 1956.|$|E
5|$|A synthetic, {{radioactive}} element, <b>curium</b> is a hard, dense metal with a silvery-white {{appearance and}} {{physical and chemical}} properties resembling those of gadolinium. Its melting point of 1340°C is significantly higher than that of the previous transuranic elements neptunium (637°C), plutonium (639°C) and americium (1173°C). In comparison, gadolinium melts at 1312°C. The boiling point of <b>curium</b> is 3110°C. With a density of 13.52 g/cm3, <b>curium</b> is significantly lighter than neptunium (20.45 g/cm3) and plutonium (19.8 g/cm3), but is heavier than most other metals. Between two crystalline forms of <b>curium,</b> the α-Cm is more stable at ambient conditions. It has a hexagonal symmetry, space group P63/mmc, lattice parameters a = 365 pm and c = 1182 pm, and four formula units per unit cell. The crystal consists of a double-hexagonal close packing with the layer sequence ABAC and so is isotypic with α-lanthanum. At pressures above 23 GPa, at room temperature, α-Cm transforms into β-Cm, which has a face-centered cubic symmetry, space group Fmm and the lattice constant a = 493 pm. Upon further compression to 43 GPa, <b>curium</b> transforms to an orthorhombic γ-Cm structure similar to that of α-uranium, with no further transitions observed up to 52 GPa. These three <b>curium</b> phases are also referred to as Cm I, II and III.|$|E
5|$|Atmospheric <b>curium</b> {{compounds}} {{are poorly}} soluble in common solvents and mostly adhere to soil particles. Soil analysis revealed about 4,000 times higher concentration of <b>curium</b> at the sandy soil particles than in water {{present in the}} soil pores. An even higher ratio of about 18,000 was measured in loam soils.|$|E
5|$|Berkelium is a soft, silvery-white, {{radioactive}} actinide metal. In {{the periodic}} table, {{it is located}} {{to the right of}} the actinide <b>curium,</b> to the left of the actinide californium and below the lanthanide terbium with which it shares many similarities in physical and chemical properties. Its density of 14.78g/cm3 lies between those of <b>curium</b> (13.52g/cm3) and californium (15.1g/cm3), as does its melting point of 986°C, below that of <b>curium</b> (1340°C) but higher than that of californium (900°C). Berkelium is relatively soft and has one of the lowest bulk moduli among the actinides, at about 20 GPa (2Pa).|$|E
5|$|<b>Curium</b> has {{peculiar}} magnetic properties. Whereas {{its neighbor}} element americium shows no deviation from Curie-Weiss paramagnetism {{in the entire}} temperature range, α-Cm transforms to an antiferromagnetic state upon cooling to 65–52 K, and β-Cm exhibits a ferrimagnetic transition at about 205 K. Meanwhile, <b>curium</b> pnictides show ferromagnetic transitions upon cooling: 244CmN and 244CmAs at 109 K, 248CmP at 73 K and 248CmSb at 162 K. The lanthanide analogue of <b>curium,</b> gadolinium, {{as well as its}} pnictides, also show magnetic transitions upon cooling, but the transition character is somewhat different: Gd and GdN become ferromagnetic, and GdP, GdAs and GdSb show antiferromagnetic ordering.|$|E
5|$|<b>Curium</b> ions {{are hard}} Lewis acids and thus form most stable {{complexes}} with hard bases. The bonding is mostly ionic, {{with a small}} covalent component. <b>Curium</b> in its complexes commonly exhibits a 9-fold coordination environment, within a tricapped trigonal prismatic geometry.|$|E
5|$|<b>Curium</b> is {{produced}} in small quantities in nuclear reactors, and by now only kilograms of it have been accumulated for the 242Cm and 244Cm and grams or even milligrams for heavier isotopes. This explains {{the high price of}} <b>curium,</b> which has been quoted at 160–185 USD per milligram, with a more recent estimate at 2,000 USD/g for 242Cm and 170 USD/g for 244Cm. In nuclear reactors, <b>curium</b> is formed from 238U in a series of nuclear reactions. In the first chain, 238U captures a neutron and converts into 239U, which via β− decay transforms into 239Np and 239Pu.|$|E
5|$|<b>Curium</b> {{isotopes}} {{are inevitably}} present in {{spent nuclear fuel}} with a concentration of about 20 g/tonne. Among them, the 245Cm–248Cm isotopes have decay times {{of thousands of years}} and need to be removed to neutralize the fuel for disposal. The associated procedure involves several steps, where <b>curium</b> is first separated and then converted by neutron bombardment in special reactors to short-lived nuclides. This procedure, nuclear transmutation, while well documented for other elements, is still being developed for <b>curium.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{accordance}} with magnetic data, electrical resistivity of <b>curium</b> increases with temperature – about twice between 4 and 60 K – and then remains nearly constant up to room temperature. There {{is a significant}} increase in resistivity over time (about 10 µΩ·cm/h) due to self-damage of the crystal lattice by alpha radiation. This makes uncertain the absolute resistivity value for <b>curium</b> (about 125 µΩ·cm). The resistivity of <b>curium</b> {{is similar to that of}} gadolinium and of the actinides plutonium and neptunium, but is significantly higher than that of americium, uranium, polonium and thorium.|$|E
5|$|Most {{synthesis}} routines yield {{a mixture}} of different actinide isotopes as oxides, from which a certain isotope of <b>curium</b> needs to be separated. An example procedure could be to dissolve spent reactor fuel (e.g. MOX fuel) in nitric acid, and remove {{the bulk of the}} uranium and plutonium using a PUREX (Plutonium – URanium EXtraction) type extraction with tributyl phosphate in a hydrocarbon. The lanthanides and the remaining actinides are then separated from the aqueous residue (raffinate) by a diamide-based extraction to give, after stripping, {{a mixture of}} trivalent actinides and lanthanides. A <b>curium</b> compound is then selectively extracted using multi-step chromatographic and centrifugation techniques with an appropriate reagent. Bis-triazinyl bipyridine complex has been recently proposed as such reagent which is highly selective to <b>curium.</b> Separation of <b>curium</b> from a very similar americium can also be achieved by treating a slurry of their hydroxides in aqueous sodium bicarbonate with ozone at elevated temperature. Both americium and <b>curium</b> are present in solutions mostly in the +3 valence state; whereas americium oxidizes to soluble Am(IV) complexes, <b>curium</b> remains unchanged and can thus be isolated by repeated centrifugation.|$|E
5|$|Owing to {{its high}} radioactivity, <b>curium</b> and its {{compounds}} must be handled in appropriate laboratories under special arrangements. Whereas <b>curium</b> itself mostly emits α-particles which are absorbed by thin layers of common materials, some of its decay products emit significant fractions of beta and gamma radiation, which require a more elaborate protection. If consumed, <b>curium</b> is excreted {{within a few days}} and only 0.05% is absorbed in the blood. From there, about 45% goes to the liver, 45% to the bones, and the remaining 10% is excreted. In the bone, <b>curium</b> accumulates {{on the inside of the}} interfaces to the bone marrow and does not significantly redistribute with time; its radiation destroys bone marrow and thus stops red blood cell creation. The biological half-life of <b>curium</b> is about 20 years in the liver and 50 years in the bones. <b>Curium</b> is absorbed in the body much more strongly via inhalation, and the allowed total dose of 244Cm in soluble form is 0.3 μC. Intravenous injection of 242Cm and 244Cm containing solutions to rats increased the incidence of bone tumor, and inhalation promoted pulmonary and liver cancer.|$|E
5|$|Prolonged {{irradiation}} of americium, <b>curium,</b> and plutonium with neutrons produces milligram {{amounts of}} californium-252 and microgram amounts of californium-249. As of 2006, <b>curium</b> isotopes 244 to 248 are irradiated by neutrons in special reactors to produce primarily californium-252 with lesser amounts of isotopes 249 to 255.|$|E
5|$|The first <b>curium</b> {{samples were}} barely visible, and were {{identified}} by their radioactivity. Louis Werner and Isadore Perlman created the first substantial sample of 30µg curium-242 hydroxide at the University of California in 1947 by bombarding americium-241 with neutrons. Macroscopic amounts of curium(III) fluoride were obtained in 1950 by W. W. T. Crane, J. C. Wallmann and B. B. Cunningham. Its magnetic susceptibility {{was very close to}} that of GdF3 providing the first experimental evidence for the +3 valence of <b>curium</b> in its compounds. <b>Curium</b> metal was produced only in 1951 by reduction of CmF3 with barium.|$|E
5|$|Thermal {{oxidation}} of trace {{quantities of}} <b>curium</b> hydride (CmH2–3) {{has been reported}} to produce a volatile form of CmO2 and the volatile trioxide CmO3, one of the two known examples of the very rare +6 state for <b>curium.</b> Another observed species was reported to behave similarly to a supposed plutonium tetroxide and was tentatively characterized as CmO4, with <b>curium</b> in the extremely rare +8 state; |journal=Radiochemistry |volume=55 |issue=1 |pages=46–51 |publisher=SP MAIK Nauka/Interperiodica |doi=10.1134/S1066362213010098 }} however, new experiments seem to indicate that CmO4 does not exist, and have cast doubt on the existence of PuO4 as well.|$|E
5|$|About 20 radioisotopes and 7 {{nuclear isomers}} between 233Cm and 252Cm {{are known for}} <b>curium,</b> and no stable isotopes. The longest half-lives have been {{reported}} for 247Cm (15.6 million years) and 248Cm (348,000 years). Other long-lived isotopes are 245Cm (half-life 8500 years), 250Cm (8,300 years) and 246Cm (4,760 years). Curium-250 is unusual in that it predominantly (about 86%) decays via spontaneous fission. The most commonly used <b>curium</b> isotopes are 242Cm and 244Cm with the half-lives of 162.8 days and 18.1 years, respectively.|$|E
5|$|All {{isotopes}} between 242Cm and 248Cm, {{as well as}} 250Cm, {{undergo a}} self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction and thus in principle {{can act as a}} nuclear fuel in a reactor. As in most transuranic elements, the nuclear fission cross section is especially high for the odd-mass <b>curium</b> isotopes 243Cm, 245Cm and 247Cm. These can be used in thermal-neutron reactors, whereas a mixture of <b>curium</b> isotopes is only suitable for fast breeder reactors since the even-mass isotopes are not fissile in a thermal reactor and accumulate as burn-up increases. The mixed-oxide (MOX) fuel, which is to be used in power reactors, should contain little or no <b>curium</b> because the neutron activation of 248Cm will create californium. This is strong neutron emitter, and would pollute the back end of the fuel cycle and increase the dose to reactor personnel. Hence, if the minor actinides are to be used as fuel in a thermal neutron reactor, the <b>curium</b> should be excluded from the fuel or placed in special fuel rods where it is the only actinide present.|$|E
5|$|All known {{isotopes}} of <b>curium</b> are radioactive {{and have}} a small critical mass for a sustained nuclear chain reaction. They predominantly emit α-particles, and the heat released in this process {{can serve as a}} heat source in radioisotope thermoelectric generators, but this application is hindered by the scarcity, high cost, and radioactivity of <b>curium</b> isotopes. <b>Curium</b> is used in production of heavier actinides and of the 238Pu radionuclide for power sources in artificial pacemakers. It served as the α-source in the alpha particle X-ray spectrometers installed on several space probes, including the Sojourner, Spirit, Opportunity and Curiosity Mars rovers and the Philae lander on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, to analyze the composition and structure of the surface.|$|E
5|$|Among 19 {{isotopes}} of <b>curium,</b> {{the most}} accessible are 242Cm and 244Cm; they are α-emitters, but with much shorter lifetime than the americium isotopes. These isotopes emit almost no γ-radiation, but undergo spontaneous fission {{with the associated}} emission of neutrons. More long-lived isotopes of <b>curium</b> (245–248Cm, all α-emitters) are formed as a mixture during neutron irradiation of plutonium or americium. Upon short irradiation, this mixture is dominated by 246Cm, and then 248Cm begins to accumulate. Both of these isotopes, especially 248Cm, have a longer half-life (3.48 years) and are much more convenient for carrying out chemical research than 242Cm and 244Cm, {{but they also have}} a rather high rate of spontaneous fission. 247Cm has the longest lifetime among isotopes of <b>curium</b> (1.56 years), but is not formed in large quantities because of the strong fission induced by thermal neutrons.|$|E
5|$|In the {{periodic}} table, americium is located {{to the right}} of plutonium, to the left of <b>curium,</b> and below the lanthanide europium, with which it shares many similarities in physical and chemical properties. Americium is a highly radioactive element. When freshly prepared, it has a silvery-white metallic lustre, but then slowly tarnishes in air. With a density of 12g/cm3, americium is less dense than both <b>curium</b> (13.52g/cm3) and plutonium (19.8g/cm3); but has a higher density than europium (5.264g/cm3)—mostly because of its higher atomic mass. Americium is relatively soft and easily deformable and has a significantly lower bulk modulus than the actinides before it: Th, Pa, U, Np and Pu. Its melting point of 1173°C is significantly higher than that of plutonium (639°C) and europium (826°C), but lower than for <b>curium</b> (1340°C).|$|E
5|$|The {{transuranic}} elements from americium to fermium, including <b>curium,</b> occurred naturally {{in the natural}} nuclear fission reactor at Oklo, but no longer do so.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of <b>curium,</b> {{as well as}} americium, in 1944 was {{closely related to the}} Manhattan Project, so the results were confidential and declassified only in 1945. Seaborg leaked the synthesis of the elements 95 and 96 on the U.S. radio show for children, the Quiz Kids, five days before the official presentation at an American Chemical Society meeting on November 11, 1945, when one of the listeners asked whether any new transuranium element beside plutonium and neptunium had been discovered during the war. The {{discovery of}} <b>curium</b> (242Cm and 240Cm), their production and compounds were later patented listing only Seaborg as the inventor.|$|E
5|$|<b>Curium</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{radioactive}} isolable elements. Its two most common isotopes 242Cm and 244Cm are strong alpha emitters (energy 6MeV); they have relatively short half-lives of 162.8 days and 18.1 years, and produce as much as 120 W/g and 3 W/g of thermal energy, respectively. Therefore, <b>curium</b> can be used in its common oxide form in radioisotope thermoelectric generators like those in spacecraft. This application has been studied for the 244Cm isotope, while 242Cm was abandoned due to its prohibitive price of around 2000 USD/g. 243Cm with a ~30 year half-life and good energy yield of ~1.6 W/g could make for a suitable fuel, but it produces significant amounts of harmful gamma and beta radiation from radioactive decay products. Though as an α-emitter, 244Cm requires a much thinner radiation protection shielding, it has a high spontaneous fission rate, and thus the neutron and gamma radiation rate are relatively strong. As compared to a competing thermoelectric generator isotope such as 238Pu, 244Cm emits a 500-fold greater fluence of neutrons, and its higher gamma emission requires a shield that is 20 times thicker — about 2inches of lead for a 1kW source, as compared to 0.1 in for 238Pu. Therefore, this application of <b>curium</b> is currently considered impractical.|$|E
5|$|<b>Curium</b> was {{chemically}} identified at the Metallurgical Laboratory (now Argonne National Laboratory) at the University of Chicago. It was {{the third}} transuranium element to be discovered {{even though it is}} the fourth in the series – the lighter element americium was unknown at the time.|$|E
5|$|Metallic <b>curium</b> is {{obtained}} {{by reduction of}} its compounds. Initially, curium(III) fluoride was used for this purpose. The reaction was conducted in the environment free from water and oxygen, in the apparatus made of tantalum and tungsten, using elemental barium or lithium as reducing agents.|$|E
5|$|Seaborg's {{theoretical}} {{development of}} the actinide concept resulted in a redrawing of the Periodic Table of the Elements into its current configuration with the actinide series appearing below the lanthanide series. Seaborg developed the chemical elements americium and <b>curium</b> while in Chicago. He managed to secure patents for both elements. His patent on <b>curium</b> never proved commercially viable because of the element's short half-life, but americium is commonly used in household smoke detectors and thus provided {{a good source of}} royalty income to Seaborg in later years. Prior to the test of the first nuclear weapon, Seaborg joined with several other leading scientists in a written statement known as the Franck Report (secret at the time but since published) unsuccessfully calling on President Truman to conduct a public demonstration of the atomic bomb witnessed by the Japanese.|$|E
5|$|The second isotope 242Am was {{produced}} upon neutron bombardment of the already-created 241Am. Upon rapid β-decay, 242Am converts into the isotope of <b>curium</b> 242Cm (which {{had been discovered}} previously). The half-life of this decay was initially determined at 17 hours, which {{was close to the}} presently accepted value of 16.02 h.|$|E
5|$|Three {{californium}} isotopes {{with significant}} half-lives are produced, requiring {{a total of}} 15 neutron captures by uranium-238 without nuclear fission or alpha decay occurring during the process. Californium-253 {{is at the end}} of a production chain that starts with uranium-238, includes several isotopes of plutonium, americium, <b>curium,</b> berkelium, and the californium isotopes 249 to 253 (see diagram).|$|E
5|$|Although {{very small}} amounts of {{berkelium}} were possibly produced in previous nuclear experiments, it was first intentionally synthesized, isolated and identified in December 1949 by Glenn T. Seaborg, Albert Ghiorso, Stanley G. Thompson, and Kenneth Street, Jr.. They used the 60-inch cyclotron at the University of California, Berkeley. Similar to the nearly simultaneous discovery of americium (element 95) and <b>curium</b> (element 96) in 1944, the new elements berkelium and californium (element 98) were both produced in 1949–1950.|$|E
5|$|An {{elaborated}} APXS {{setup is}} equipped with a sensor head containing six <b>curium</b> sources having the total radioactive decay rate of several tens of millicuries (roughly a gigabecquerel). The sources are collimated on the sample, and the energy spectra of the alpha particles and protons scattered from the sample are analyzed (the proton analysis is implemented only in some spectrometers). These spectra contain quantitative information on all major elements in the samples except for hydrogen, helium and lithium.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} other actinides, self-damage of the crystal lattice due to alpha-particle {{irradiation}} is intrinsic to americium. It is especially noticeable at low temperatures, where the mobility of the produced lattice defects is relatively low, by broadening of X-ray diffraction peaks. This effect makes somewhat uncertain the temperature of americium {{and some of its}} properties, such as electrical resistivity. So for americium-241, the resistivity at 4.2 K increases with time from about 2µOhm·cm to 10µOhm·cm after 40 hours, and saturates at about 16µOhm·cm after 140 hours. This effect is less pronounced at room temperature, due to annihilation of radiation defects; also heating to room temperature the sample which was kept for hours at low temperatures restores its resistivity. In fresh samples, the resistivity gradually increases with temperature from about 2 µOhm·cm at liquid helium to 69µOhm·cm at room temperature; this behavior {{is similar to that of}} neptunium, uranium, thorium and protactinium, but is different from plutonium and <b>curium</b> which show a rapid rise up to 60K followed by saturation. The room temperature value for americium is lower than that of neptunium, plutonium and <b>curium,</b> but higher than for uranium, thorium and protactinium.|$|E
5|$|Berkelium is a {{transuranic}} radioactive {{chemical element}} with symbolBk and atomic number 97. It {{is a member}} of the actinide and transuranium element series. It is named after the city of Berkeley, California, the location of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (then the University of California Radiation Laboratory) where it was discovered in December 1949. Berkelium was the fifth transuranium element discovered after neptunium, plutonium, <b>curium</b> and americium.|$|E
5|$|Contrary to {{the lighter}} {{actinides}} californium, berkelium, <b>curium</b> and americium which crystallize {{in a double}} hexagonal structure at ambient conditions, einsteinium {{is believed to have}} a face-centered cubic (fcc) symmetry with the space group Fmm and the lattice constant a = 575 pm. However, there is a report of room-temperature hexagonal einsteinium metal with a = 398 pm and c = 650 pm, which converted to the fcc phase upon heating to 300°C.|$|E
