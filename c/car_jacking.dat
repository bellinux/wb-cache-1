40|$|A {{screw jack}} is a device used {{to lift the}} vehicle above the ground level in order to ease repairs. A power screw is {{designed}} to translate radial motion to linear motion. Many users are familiar with manually operated <b>car</b> <b>jack</b> which still included as standard equipment in <b>cars.</b> A <b>car</b> <b>jack</b> is an important device in vehicle to change flat tire in our journey. Every year near about 160 injuries are associated with <b>car</b> <b>jacks.</b> The correct use of jacks can prevent the accidents and injuries. Improvement in Design of <b>car</b> <b>jack</b> is really important to make the tool more efficient and user friendly with high safety features. The objectives of this project work is to critically analyze and compare between ACME and SQUARE threads from stress and strain perspective {{in order to improve}} the performance from safety and durability point of view for developments in the field of thread design. In this project selection of two different types of screw threads namely Square and Acme threads. The square threads are named after their square geometry. They are the most efficient power screw, but also the most difficult to machine, thus most expensive. The Acme threads are machining with multipoint cutting tool on thread milling machine, it is an economical operation. Acme threads have more thickness at core diameter than of Square threads therefore a screw with Acme threads is stronger than equivalent screw with Square threads. Assumptions made in designing a Power screw are the total load is distributed among the threads i. e. of <b>car</b> <b>jack</b> of capacity 1. 5 to 3 tones threads are in direct shear, various stresses in screw like tensile or compressive {{in the body of the}} screw due to an axial load. Thus, the different type of screw threads is designed as per the dimensions, experimental calculations and analyzed using Abaqus FEA software. Model developed is to be validated using experimental and analysis calculatio...|$|R

50|$|A jack, {{screwjack}} or jackscrew is {{a mechanical}} device {{used as a}} lifting device to lift heavy loads or to apply great forces. A mechanical jack employs a screw thread for lifting heavy equipment. A hydraulic jack uses hydraulic power. The most common form is a <b>car</b> <b>jack,</b> floor jack or garage jack, which lifts vehicles so that maintenance can be performed. Jacks are usually rated for a maximum lifting capacity (for example, 1.5 tons or 3 tons). Industrial jacks can be rated for many tons of load.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the {{modification of the}} existing motor screw jack by incorporating an electric motor in the screw {{in order to make}} load lifting easier. In this modified design, the power screw is rotated through its connecting gear with the pinion gear when electrical power flows through the cigarette lighter receptacle connected to the motor, plugged to the automobile 12 V battery source to generate power for the prime mover (motor), which transmits its rotating speed to the pinion gear meshing with the bigger gear connected to the power screw to be rotated with required speed reduction and increased torque to drive the power screw. The significance and purpose of this work is to modify the existing <b>car</b> <b>jack</b> {{in order to make the}} operation easier, safer and more reliable in order to reduce health risks especially back ache problems associated with doing work in a bent or squatting position for a long period of time. The modified <b>car</b> <b>jack</b> is easy to use by pregnant women or whoever had problem with the vehicle tyres along the road. The designed motorised jack will also save time and requires less human energy to operate.
