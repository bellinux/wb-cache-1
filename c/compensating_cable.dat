This is a {{separate}} set of cables or a chain attached {{to the bottom of}} the counterweight and the bottom of the elevator cab. This makes it easier to control the elevator, as it compensates for the differing weight of cable between the hoist and the cab. If the elevator cab is at the top of the hoist-way, there is a short length of hoist cable above the car and a long length of <b>compensating</b> <b>cable</b> below the car and vice versa for the counterweight. If the compensation system uses cables, there will be an additional sheave in the pit below the elevator, to guide the cables. If the compensation system uses chains, the chain is guided by a bar mounted between the counterweight railway lines.|$|E

40|$|Vibration {{phenomena}} {{taking place}} in lifting and hoist installations may influence the dynamic performance of their components. For example, in an elevator system they may affect ride quality of a lift car.

The {{synthesis}} of the active shielding systems by technogenic magnetic field generated by {{the different types of}} high voltage power lines in a given region of space using various cables of controlled magnetic field sources. Methodology. The initial parameters for the {{synthesis of}} active shielding system parameters are the location of the high voltage power lines with respect to the protected transmission line space, geometry and number of cables, operating currents, as well as the size of the protected space and normative value magnetic field induction, which should be achieved as a result of shielding.

40|$|Currently, {{the demand}} for obtaining {{accurate}} and reliable timeinformation is increasing for adjusting the internal clock of PCsand servers. For distributing time information through the Internet,a network time protocol(NTP) is commonly used, and the number ofNTP requests to existing servers is increasing rapidly. However,the time precision obtained with the NTP servers rapidly decreasesunder heavy load. For obtaining precise time information, we can employ variousmethods such as the GPS commonview. However, these methods requireelaborate equipment or outdoor antennas. On the other hand,communication networks can be easily used, and sufficient precisioncan be also expected when using high-speed backbones or throughdirect connections. To realize an easily usable method for obtaining highly precisetime information, the author has carried out research ontime-transfer techniques using communication networks. For enhancing precision associated with the Internet timedistribution, the author has developed a high-precision and high-throughput hardware NTP server using a field-programmable gatearray (FPGA). This hardware has necessary minimum functions for a stratum- 1 NTPserver, which simply adds timestamps based on an accurate externalclock. This server works {{as fast as the}} wire-speed of GigabitEthernet, and has a timestamp accuracy of 8 ns, even under maximumnetwork traffic load. Due to the server 2 ̆ 7 s high performance, noover load protection or crack protection are required.

40|$|The 36 -module Z {{accelerator}} [...] {{designed to}} drive z-pinch loads at currents up to 20 MA [...] {{is contained in}} a 33 -m-diameter tank with oil, water, and vacuum sections. The peak total forward-going power in the 36 water-section bi-plate transmission lines is approximately 63 TW. nine transmission lines deliver power {{to each of the}} four vacuum-section levels (referred to as levels A (the uppermost), B, C, and D). New differential D-dot and B-dot monitors were developed for the Z vacuum section. The D-dots measure voltage at the insulator stack. The B-dots measure current at the stack and in the outer magnetically-insulated transmission lines. Each monitor has two outputs that allow common-mode noise to be canceled to first order. The differential D-dot has one signal and one noise channel; the differential B-dot has two signal channels with opposite polarities. Each of the two B-dot sensors in the differential B-dot monitor has four 3 -mm-diameter loops and is encased in copper to reduce flux penetration. For both types of probes, two 2. 2 -mm-diameter coaxial-cables connect the outputs to a Prodyn balun for common-mode-noise rejection.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a system of differential-output monitors that diagnose current and voltage in the vacuum section of a 20 -MA 3 -MV pulsed-power accelerator. The system includes 62 gauges: 3 current and 6  voltage monitors that are fielded {{on each of the}} accelerator’s 4 vacuum-insulator stacks, 6 current monitors on each of the accelerator’s 4 outer magnetically insulated transmission lines (MITLs), and 2 current monitors on the accelerator’s inner MITL. The inner-MITL monitors are located 6  cm from the axis of the load. Each of the stack and outer-MITL current monitors comprises two separate B-dot sensors, each of which consists of four 3 -mm-diameter wire loops wound in series. The two sensors are separately located within adjacent cavities machined out of a single piece of copper. The high electrical conductivity of copper minimizes penetration of magnetic flux into the cavity walls, which minimizes changes in the sensitivity of the sensors on the 100 -ns time scale of the accelerator’s power pulse. A model of flux penetration has been developed and is used to correct (to first order) the B-dot signals for the penetration that does occur. The two sensors are designed to produce signals with opposite polarities; hence, each current monitor may be regarded as a single detector with differential outputs. Common-mode-noise rejection is achieved by combining these signals in a 50 -Ω balun. The signal cables that connect the B-dot monitors to the balun are chosen to provide reasonable bandwidth and acceptable levels of Compton drive in the bremsstrahlung field of the accelerator. A single 50 -Ω cable transmits the output signal of each balun to a double-wall screen room, where the signals are attenuated, digitized (0. 5 -ns/sample), numerically <b>compensated</b> for <b>cable</b> losses, and numerically integrated. By contrast, each inner-MITL current monitor contains only a single B-dot sensor. These monitors are fielded in opposite-polarity pairs. The two signals from a pair are not combined in a balun; they are instead numerically processed for common-mode-noise rejection after digitization. All the current monitors are calibrated on a 76 -cm-diameter axisymmetric radial transmission line that is driven by a 10 -kA current pulse. The reference current is measured by a current-viewing resistor (CVR). The stack voltage monitors are also differential-output gauges, consisting of one 1. 8 -cm-diameter D-dot sensor and one null sensor. Hence, each voltage monitor is also a differential detector with two output signals, processed as described above. The voltage monitors are calibrated in situ at 1. 5  MV on dedicated accelerator shots with a short-circuit load. Faraday’s law of induction is used to generate the reference voltage: currents are obtained from calibrated outer-MITL B-dot monitors, and inductances from the system geometry. In this way, both current and voltage measurements are traceable to a single CVR. Dependable and consistent measurements are thus obtained with this system of calibrated diagnostics. On accelerator shots that deliver 22  MA to a low-impedance z-pinch load, the peak lineal current densities at the stack, outer-MITL, and inner-MITL monitor locations are 0. 5, 1, and 58 [*][*]MA/m, respectively. On such shots the peak currents measured at these three locations agree to within 1 %...|$|R
40|$|LHCb {{is one of}} {{the four}} large {{experiments}} of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) based at CERN. The LHCb experiment is taking data at its nominal design luminosity. However, in order to distinguish among models of new physics, higher luminosity is needed. So the LHCb collaboration intends to upgrade the detector during the planned long LHC shutdown in 2019 {{in order to be able}} to operate at a luminosity about 10 times the nominal one. The objective the present thesis is the development of an integrated solution for the analog signal processing in the electronic and hadronic calorimeters of the LHCb. The analogue signal processing will be performed by a shaper ASIC in the calorimeters Front End (FE) boards. The signal pulse from a photomultiplier tube is clipped at its base and, then, is transmitted through a 12 m 50 Ω coaxial cable to the FE board located in the crates at the calorimeter platform. In order to reduce the PMT ageing after the increase in luminosity, the gain has to be decreased by a factor 5 with respect to the present operation in order to keep the same average current. Therefore, the preamplifier input noise must be decreased accordingly so that the total input referred noise voltage is smaller than 1 nV/√Hz. Consequently, a 50 Ω termination resistor is not acceptable. The main requirements for the analogue FE of the calorimeter system include a cali- bration of 4 fC/ 2. 5 MeV per ADC count; a dynamic range of 12 bits; noise lower than 1 ADC cnt (ENC < 4 fC); and a spill-over residue level ± 1 % a linearity: < 1 %. The implementation of the ASIC includes: four analog channels with programmable values to control the key parameters and compensate for process variations; a dedicated Delay Locked Loop (DLL) to synchronize each channel signal phase and a digital interface using SPI protocol. The analog channel is designed with an input amplifier that includes an electronically cooled termination input stage. A passive line termination would induce too large a noise and is avoided. Afterwards an alternated switched differential signal paths scheme permits the integration of the signal with no dead time between consecutive events. Each path includes a pole-zero filter in order to <b>compensate</b> for <b>cable</b> effects, a switched integrator with capacitive feedback, a Track-and-Hold for a 12 -bit ADC and a MUX to select the correct sub-channel output signal. A fully differential signal processing is adopted in order to minimize the impact of common mode noise, which is important in a switched system. Each analog channel includes a delay line based on a DLL so the user can set a delay to compensate the delay introduced by PMT voltage settings, cable lengths or particle time of flight from the interaction point to the calorimeter cells. The DLL is adjusted by means of two control voltages to ensure that systematic process or environmental variations will not affect the channel time tuning. The radiation hardness expected from the selected technology (0. 35 µm AMS SiGe BiCMOS) is enough, but design techniques are used to ensure being able to tolerate SEUs, SETs and SELs. The design has been checked at different tests of a total of 30 pieces of the final pro- totype: at the laboratory using a signal obtained with a scope, with electron beams and ECAL channels in a dedicated facility at CERN, and its radiation hardness at Centre de Resources du Cyclotron at Louvain la Neuve. Dedicated boards were developed and the results are positive. L’LHCb és un dels quatre grans experiments del Gran Col·lisionador d’Hadrons al CERN.
