5|$|Main and Hesse {{found that}} most of the mothers of these {{children}} had suffered major losses or other trauma shortly before or after the birth of the infant and had reacted by becoming severely depressed. In fact, 56% of mothers who had lost a parent by death before they <b>completed</b> <b>high</b> <b>school</b> subsequently had children with disorganized attachments. Subsequent studies, whilst emphasising the potential importance of unresolved loss, have qualified these findings. For example, Solomon and George found that unresolved loss in the mother tended to be associated with disorganized attachment in their infant primarily when they had also experienced an unresolved trauma in their life prior to the loss.|$|E
5|$|Tourette {{syndrome}} is a spectrum disorder—its severity ranges over a spectrum from mild to severe. The {{majority of cases}} are mild and require no treatment. In these cases, the impact of symptoms on the individual may be mild, {{to the extent that}} casual observers might not know of their condition. The overall prognosis is positive, but a minority of children with Tourette syndrome have severe symptoms that persist into adulthood. A study of 46 subjects at 19 years of age found that the symptoms of 80% had minimum to mild impact on their overall functioning, and that the other 20% experienced at least a moderate impact on their overall functioning. The rare minority of severe cases can inhibit or prevent individuals from holding a job or having a fulfilling social life. In a follow-up study of thirty-one adults with Tourette's, all patients <b>completed</b> <b>high</b> <b>school,</b> 52% finished at least two years of college, and 71% were full-time employed or were pursuing higher education.|$|E

Children of incarcerated fathers were less likely to <b>complete</b> <b>high</b> <b>school</b> if the father was incarcerated more than once.
