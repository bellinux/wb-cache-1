5|$|The {{expressway}} crosses Taylor-Massey Creek and the East Don River, and <b>climbs</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the valley, swinging northwards toward Eglinton Avenue.

The lanes pass beneath the Gatineau Hydro Corridor and reconnect south of the Eglinton interchange.|$|E
5|$|When {{ready to}} emerge, several {{different}} strategies are used. In some species, {{the transformation of}} the nymph occurs underwater and the subimago swims to the surface and launches itself into the air. In other species, the nymph rises to the surface, bursts out of its skin, remains quiescent {{for a minute or two}} resting on the exuviae (cast skin) and then flies upwards, and in some, the nymph <b>climbs</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the water before transforming.|$|E

5|$|Alex realizes Geiger is {{controlling}} the ship. Armed with skeet guns, he goes with Juliano to Geiger's cabin. Geiger remotely detonates explosives inside the room. Annie and Dante, the ship's photographer, notice the people trapped behind the fire doors, and Annie uses a chainsaw {{to cut the}} door open and let them out. Meanwhile, Alex orders the navigator, Merced, to flood the ship and slow it down by opening the ballast doors. As the ship floods, Alex sees Drew on a monitor after she <b>climbs</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the elevator, and runs to save her. Alex notices Geiger leaving the vault and holds him at gunpoint, but he escapes by closing the fire door in front of him. Using the ship's intercom, Geiger explains that he designed the ship's autopilot system and is taking revenge against the cruise line after being fired when he got sick from copper poisoning. Geiger again escapes from Alex by attaching a grenade to a door.|$|E
5|$|In {{the center}} of the community, NY75 intersects Langford Road, {{designated}} as NY249 west of the junction and County Route39 (CR39) east of NY75. Past NY249, the route exits Langford and heads across another stretch of fields and farms toward the Eden town line. NY75 breaks from its due north routing just south of it, taking on a more westerly heading to avoid a valley surrounding the south branch of Eighteenmile Creek. It ultimately enters the valley, however, winding its way northward down the depression's southwestern side to reach the creek floor. From here, NY75 follows the base of the valley to the northwest for , serving a handful of homes situated along the forested creekside. The route eventually <b>climbs</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the gully and heads due north for a short distance across more fields to a junction with US62.|$|E
5|$|The larvae are {{generally}} whitish grubs, roughly oval and bluntly-pointed at both ends. They have fifteen segments and spiracles in each segment for breathing. They have no legs but {{are able to}} move {{within the confines of}} the cell, helped by tubercles on their sides. They have short horns on the head, jaws for chewing their food and an appendage on either side of the mouth tipped with a bristle. There is a gland under the mouth that secretes a viscous liquid which solidifies into the silk they use to produce their cocoons. The pupa can be seen through the semi-transparent cocoon and over the course of a few days, the insect undergoes metamorphosis into the form of the adult bee. When ready to emerge, it splits its skin dorsally and <b>climbs</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the exuviae as a winged adult and breaks out of the cell.|$|E

5|$|At Gunnison, US-89 turns east before curving {{northeast}} {{into the}} Sanpete Valley, {{formed by the}} San Pitch River, {{a tributary of the}} Sevier River. Along US-89 in this valley are several small cities: Manti, Ephraim, Mount Pleasant, and Fairview. Between Ephraim and Mount Pleasant, US-89 meets the south end of SR-132 at Pigeon Hollow Junction. SR-132 was formerly US-189, connecting US-89 with US-91 in Nephi. Beyond Fairview, where the scenic SR-31 turns east, US-89 <b>climbs</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the valley, reaching a summit at Hill Top (elevation 6400 feet/2000 m). Thistle Creek parallels the next leg of the highway, descending through a canyon to the junction with US-6 near the ghost town of Thistle, flooded by a landslide in 1983. Thistle Creek and Soldier Creek, paralleled by US-89 and US-6, merge near this junction to form Spanish Fork, which the overlapped routes follow northwest through Spanish Fork Canyon into the Utah Valley at Moark Junction. US-89 splits to the north from US-6 there, skirts the west edge of Mapleton, and merges with SR-51 - the old Arrowhead Trail (US-91) - south of downtown Springville.|$|E

None of the men reach the German trenches, and B Company refuse to leave their own trench after sustaining heavy casualties. Mireau, enraged, orders his artillery to open fire on them to force them onto the battlefield. The artillery commander refuses to fire on his own men without written confirmation of the order.

He has flashbacks to the murders, remembering that those responsible were T-Bird and his gang: Tin Tin, Funboy, and Skank. Eric soon discovers that any wounds he receives heal immediately. Guided by the crow, he sets out to avenge his and Shelly's murders by killing the perpetrators.|$|E

25|$|South of Middlewich, having {{passed through}} Wheelock, the T & M <b>climbs</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the Cheshire Plain via the 'Heartbreak Hill' locks (more {{traditionally}} {{known as the}} 'Cheshire Locks') to the summit-level and the junction with the Hall Green Branch, leading to the Macclesfield Canal at Red Bull Kidsgrove. Most of the locks in this flight are doubled, although {{not all of the}} duplicates are still usable. Of particular note was lock 53 where, due to subsidence from brine pumping, the 'spare' lock was replaced by a steel contrivance with guillotine gates. Theoretically, this was adjustable to compensate for further subsidence although, in practice it was less than successful and was ultimately removed altogether. Little evidence of 'Thurlwood Steel Lock' remains today. The boater can use the Macclesfield Canal to head for Marple, and the junction with the Peak Forest Canal (and hence, via the Ashton, Rochdale and Bridgewater canal) to complete the 'Cheshire Ring'.|$|E
25|$|Jealous {{servants}} of Ketil who {{look down on}} slaves, destroy Thorfinn's and Einar's wheat crops. When Thorfinn and Einar confront the jealous servants, they both get into a fight with them where Thorfinn is knocked out and has a gruesome vision. In his dreams, many corpses are seen fighting and clawing at Thorfinn, {{as though they are}} trying to drag him down with them into eternal battle. Thors appears to his son and reveals to Thorfinn that he never wanted him to become a Viking warrior. Thorfinn assumes that this is a nightmarish version of Valhalla, where dead Vikings fight a never ending battle. Askeladd then appears to Thorfinn and reveals that it is not Valhalla nor is it a peaceful afterlife: these are all of the people that Thorfinn has slain. Askeladd further reveals that it is not too late to redeem himself so he will not end up there just like him. He tells Thorfinn to become a real warrior just like his father. Thorfinn's vision makes him regret the sins he has done and weeps for those he has slain while contemplating the lives of those he has killed. He resigns to give up and allow the mass of corpses to pull him down but Askeladd encourages him to continue his life. Thorfinn vows to never hurt anyone again and <b>climbs</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the pile and wakes up next to Einar, who declares that they won the fight. Thorfinn declares that he will never hurt anyone again and the duo contemplates their troubles for the fight that just occurred. Luckily, Ketil found evidence of the jealous servants’ wrongdoing and told them to never bother Thorfinn and Einar again.|$|E
25|$|The cage {{was quickly}} erected {{for the second}} main event and soon after Konnan's La Legión Extranjera came to the ring. Silver King wore his mask as he marched to the ring, {{apparently}} defying a ruling by the Mexican' boxing and wrestling commission. When he reached the cage he took his mask off to reveal that he had his entire head painted to look like his mask, thus avoiding any further legal trouble. El Hijo del Santo was the last wrestler to come out for the match, representing AAA {{for the first time}} in 14 years. La Legión gained the early advantage with their cheating tactics, which included handcuffing La Parka to the cage, both to immobilize him and to ensure that he would not be able to climb out of the cage. After more action Konnan appeared on the Jumbotron, Konnan revealed that he had the key to the handcuffs and that he was not coming near the ring, just to ensure that his team would win. After hearing Konnan's comments special referee Cien Caras went backstage to retrieve the key. Back in the ring Vampiro and Kenzo Suzuki were the first two wrestlers to climb out of the cage, leaving it a four on four match. Moments later Octágon left the cage as well giving Team AAA the advantage. During this time La Hermandad 187 came to ringside to stop anyone from the backstage area from coming to the ring, hired by La Legión to keep the numbers advantage throughout the match. Teddy Hart was the next wrestler to escape, leaving the cage only moments after Cien Caras returned to ringside with the key. La Hermandad tried to stop Caras, but he was able to hand the key to Joaquin Roldan who then freed La Parka. Chessman was the next wrestler to escape, which combined with Konnan coming to ringside meant that La Legión was able to outnumber the wrestlers outside the cage. As La Hermandad and Chessman fought with Octagón and Vampiro Jack Evans climbed up the cage and then leapt off the top with a spectacular somersault splash that knocked everyone down. Inside the ring El Hijo del Santo applied the Camel Clutch on Electroshock, but while Hijo del Santo had the hold locked in Konnan pulled out a fire extinguisher and sprayed white foam in Hijo del Santo's face. Electroshock quickly left the cage, taking advantage of Hijo del Santo being temporarily blinded. La Parka and Silver King fights each other while both try to escape the ring. At one point Konnan tries to climb up and help Silver King escape so his team can win the match but out comes El Zorro, wearing a black mask. Instead of helping out La Legión, Zorro turns on them, handing his kendo stick to Joaquin Roldan, who proceeds to hit Konnan with it. Meanwhile, inside the cage, La Parka takes care of Silver King, helps El Hijo del Santo up and <b>climbs</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the cage. Silver King stops El Hijo del Santo from escaping the cage and the two start to trade punches at the top of the cage wall, ending with Silver King falling down to the mat and Santo climbing up and over the top to win the match for AAA. Following the match El Hijo del Santo hands the urn of Antonio Peña over to Joaquin Roldan and Marisela Peña as the representation of them regaining control of AAA.|$|E
