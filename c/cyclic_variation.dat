Twenty-five anesthetized dogs were studied; coronary blood flow velocity was continuously monitored. Recurrent intracoronary platelet aggregation and dislodgment (indicated by <b>cyclic</b> <b>variations</b> in coronary blood flow) were induced by mechanically injuring and stenosing the left anterior descending coronary artery. Sodium nitroprusside was administered either intrapericardially or intravenously 30 min after <b>cyclic</b> flow <b>variations</b> were established. Intrapericardial administration of saline (control) did not affect <b>cyclic</b> flow <b>variations</b> in any of 6 tested dogs. Sodium nitroprusside abolished <b>cyclic</b> flow <b>variations</b> in all 7 dogs (100 %) when given intrapericardially and in 5 to 7 dogs (71 %) when given intravenously (compared to intrapericardial salines, p < 0. 01). A smaller dose of sodium nitroprusside was required to abolish <b>cyclic</b> flow <b>variations</b> when given intrapericardially than when given intravenously (1. 6 +/- 0. 5 micrograms. kg- 1. min- 1 vs 4. 8 +/- 0. 8 micrograms. kg- 1. min- 1, p < 0. 01). The mean aortic pressure was reduced by 10 to 20 mmHg after intrapericardial sodium nitroprusside administration and by 30 to 40 mmHg after intravenous sodium nitroprusside administration. To investigate the mechanism of protection by sodium nitroprusside, NG-monomethyl-L-arginine, an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthetase, was used to induce <b>cyclic</b> flow <b>variations</b> in mildly injured and stenosed left anterior descending coronary arteries in 5 dogs.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. The {{purpose of}} this study was to test the {{hypothesis}} that free oxygen radicals contribute to platelet aggregation and <b>cyclic</b> flow <b>variations</b> in stenosed and endothelium-injured coronary arteries. Background. Although free oxygen radicals, such as superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide, have been shown to alter platelet function in vitro, the potential role of free oxygen radicals has not been fully described in an in vivo model of coronary artery thrombosis. Methods. <b>Cyclic</b> flow <b>variations</b> were produced in dogs by an external constrictor placed at the site of the left anterior descending coronary artery with injured endothelium. Blood flow in this artery was monitored by a pulsed Doppler flow probe. If <b>cyclic</b> How <b>variations</b> were observed during postoperative days, dogs intravenously received superoxide dismutase plus catalase. In anesthetized dogs that did not develop an episode of <b>cyclic</b> flow <b>variations,</b> the effect of intracoronary infusion of xanthine plus xanthine oxidase or hydrogen peroxide on arterial blood flow velocity was studied. In platelet studies, the effect of free oxygen radicals and radical scavengers on platelet aggregation was examined. Result. In conscious dogs with <b>cyclic</b> flow <b>variations,</b> superoxide dismutase plus catalase significantly reduced <b>cyclic</b> flow <b>variations</b> (n = 7), whereas saline infusion had no effect (n = 7), The infusion of xanthine plus xanthine oxidase or hydrogen peroxide significantly induced <b>cyclic</b> flow <b>variations</b> in four of six dogs or in five of seven dogs, respectively. In vitro platelet studies showed that xanthine plus xanthine oxidase or hydrogen peroxide significantly enhanced platelet aggregation, and superoxide dismutase or catalase significantly inhibited such aggregation. Conclusion. Reduction of free radical formation decreases platelet aggregation and may eliminate <b>cyclic</b> flow <b>variations,</b> whereas promotion of free radical generation enhances platelet aggregation and may induce <b>cyclic</b> flow <b>variations.</b> Thus, free oxygen radicals are an important mediator in this model...|$|R

Three groups of dogs were studied. In Group 1 (n = 7) and Group 2 (n = 6), <b>cyclic</b> coronary flow <b>variations</b> were initiated after placement of a concentric constrictor around the left anterior descending coronary artery and were abolished by administration of either a thromboxane A 2 -prostaglandin H 2 receptor antagonist, SQ 29, 548 (SQ) (Group 1), or a serotonin S 2 receptor antagonist, LY 53, 857 (LY) (Group 2). <b>Cyclic</b> flow <b>variations</b> were restored with an epinephrine infusion and the second antagonist (LY for Group 1; SQ for Group 2) was administered to abolish epinephrine-induced <b>cyclic</b> flow <b>variations.</b> The rate of epinephrine infusion was increased until <b>cyclic</b> coronary flow <b>variations</b> returned (n = 8) or significant hemodynamic changes occurred. Plasma epinephrine concentrations were determined during a control period of <b>cyclic</b> coronary flow <b>variations,</b> after epinephrine restored <b>cyclic</b> flow <b>variations</b> in the presence of either SQ or LY, and again after epinephrine restored <b>cyclic</b> flow <b>variations</b> in the presence of both SQ and LY. A third group of dogs (Group 3, n = 9) required both SQ and LY to eliminate the initial <b>cyclic</b> coronary flow <b>variations</b> and infused epinephrine restored <b>cyclic</b> flow <b>variations</b> (n = 8). Plasma epinephrine concentrations were determined during a control period and after <b>cyclic</b> coronary flow <b>variation</b> restoration with epinephrine. Yohimbine, an alpha 2 -receptor antagonist, eliminated epinephrine-induced <b>cyclic</b> coronary flow <b>variations</b> in the presence of both SQ and LY in most dogs. Plasma epinephrine at control was 0. 03 ± 0. 01 ng/ml plasma (n = 22). Plasma epinephrine concentrations of 3. 11 ± 0. 63 ng/ml (n = 13) were required to restore <b>cyclic</b> coronary flow <b>variations</b> in the presence of either SQ or LY. Restoration of <b>cyclic</b> flow <b>variations</b> in the presence of both SQ and LY required a plasma epinephrine concentration of 13. 9 ± 4. 8 ng/ml (n = 18). <b>Cyclic</b> flow <b>variations</b> could not be restored in the presence of both SQ and LY in four dogs; plasma epinephrine in these dogs was 64. 8 ± 18. 3 ng/ml. Thus, combined serotonin and thromboxane receptor antagonists provide substantial protection against epinephrine-restored <b>cyclic</b> coronary flow <b>variations</b> in this experimental model. In fact, the plasma epinephrine concentrations required to restore <b>cyclic</b> flow <b>variations</b> in the presence of both receptor antagonists were considerably higher than those normally encountered in patients during maximal exercise or with myocardial infarction...|$|R

To determine whether ultrasound tissue characterization can identify viable though stunned myocardium before recovery of regional wall thickening, transient ischemic injury was produced in eight open chest dogs for 15 min followed by reperfusion for 2 h. <b>Cyclic</b> <b>variation</b> and wall thickening were measured before ischemia, at 15 min after the onset of ischemia and at selected intervals after the onset of reperfusion from multiple sites within the ischemic zone with a novel combined two-dimensional and M-mode acquisition system. <b>Cyclic</b> <b>variation</b> and wall thickening were computed from digitized M-mode integrated backscatter images with an algorithm developed and validated for this purpose. Magnitude and “delay” of <b>cyclic</b> <b>variation</b> and wall thickening were compared. Delay represents the degree of synchrony of regional <b>cyclic</b> <b>variation</b> or wall thickening with global ventricular mechanical systole. Baseline <b>cyclic</b> <b>variation</b> and wall thickening magnitudes were 3. 8 ± 0. 2 dB and 37 ± 1. 4 %, respectively. With ischemia, <b>cyclic</b> <b>variation</b> and wall thickening decreased to 1. 7 ± 0. 2 dB and 17 ± 2 %, respectively (p < 0. 05, compared with baseline). <b>Cyclic</b> <b>variation</b> recovered to baseline levels within 20 min after reperfusion (3. 3 ± 0. 4 dB, p = NS). Wall thickening remained depressed for 2 h after the onset of reperfusion (23 ± 2 %, p < 0. 05 compared with baseline). Delay of <b>cyclic</b> <b>variation</b> in a unitless ratio expressed as delay (in milliseconds) divided by the QT interval (in milliseconds) increased from 0. 87 ± 0. 03 at baseline to 1. 10 ± 0. 12 with ischemia, a change consistent with mild asynchrony, and returned to baseline (0. 95 ± 0. 07, p = NS compared with baseline) within 20 min after reperfusion. Delay of wall thickening was 0. 88 ± 0. 02 at baseline, increased to 1. 23 ± 0. 09 with ischemia and remained significantly increased 2 h after reperfusion (1. 07 ± 0. 05, p < 0. 05 compared with baseline). Recovery time constants for <b>cyclic</b> <b>variation</b> and wall thickening with reperfusion reflected earlier restoration of <b>cyclic</b> <b>variation</b> (8. 1 min) than of wall thickening (420. 5 min).
