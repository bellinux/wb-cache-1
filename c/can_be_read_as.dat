In 2014, he traveled to the Alberta Tar Sands with the Sierra Club's Michael Brune and Leonardo DiCaprio. In 2015, he traveled to Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge with Brune, Keri Russell, and the leaders of several veterans groups.|$|E
5|$|Sir John Tenniel drew {{a famous}} {{illustration}} of Alice meeting a caterpillar for Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland, c. 1865. The caterpillar is {{seated on a}} toadstool and is smoking a hookah; the image <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>read</b> <b>as</b> showing either the forelegs of the larva, or as suggesting a face with protruding nose and chin. Eric Carle's children's book The Very Hungry Caterpillar portrays the larva as an extraordinarily hungry animal, while also teaching children how to count (to five) and {{the days of the}} week.|$|E
5|$|This {{contains}} {{the notion of}} a being that cannot be conceived not to exist. He argued that if something can be conceived not to exist, then something greater can be conceived. Consequently, a thing than which nothing greater can be conceived cannot be conceived not to exist and so it must exist. This <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>read</b> <b>as</b> a restatement of the argument in Chapter 2, although Norman Malcolm believed it to be a different, stronger argument.|$|E

5|$|Laozi is {{traditionally}} {{regarded as the}} author of the Daodejing (Tao Te Ching), though the identity of its author(s) or compiler(s) has been debated throughout history. It {{is one of the most}} significant treatises in Chinese cosmogony. As with most other ancient Chinese philosophers, Laozi often explains his ideas by way of paradox, analogy, appropriation of ancient sayings, repetition, symmetry, rhyme, and rhythm. In fact, the whole book <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>read</b> <b>as</b> an analogy – the ruler is the awareness, or self, in meditation and the myriad creatures or empire is the experience of the body, senses and desires.|$|E
5|$|Trollope leapt {{into the}} fray {{somewhat}} belatedly, {{in the pages of}} Saint Paul's in October 1869, with an article on the Formosa controversy that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>read</b> <b>as</b> a defence of and an advertisement for The Vicar. He took exception to several of the arguments in The Times: young women of the 1860s, he wrote, were not unaware of the existence of prostitution; and attempting to keep them in ignorance would not conduce to virtue. Rather than promoting vice, an accurate depiction of the squalid and miserable life of a woman of the streets would arm young people to resist temptation.|$|E

25|$|In {{the field}} of American fiction, William Faulkner's 1930 novel As I Lay Dying <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>read</b> <b>as</b> an {{interaction}} with the cubist mode. The novel features narratives of the diverse experiences of 15 characters which, when taken together, produce a single cohesive body.|$|E
50|$|Although {{these books}} <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>read</b> {{individually}} <b>as</b> discrete adventures, when read in order some continuity of character development and sub-plots is apparent.|$|R
5000|$|... 913 is [...] "kyu ichi san"; but <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> <b>read</b> <b>as</b> [...] "ka-i-sa", as in Kamen Rider Kaixa, {{hence the}} code to {{activate}} the henshin. An anagram of this is 193. {{it was intended to}} <b>be</b> <b>read</b> <b>as</b> [...] "ichi kyu san", but <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> <b>read</b> <b>as</b> [...] "I-Ku-Sa" [...] as in Kamen Rider IXA or Iku-san.

25|$|The bricks have {{indeterminate}} numerals that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>read</b> <b>as</b> 1632 or 1682, and the numerals's style {{does not}} match colonial scripts. The bricks also have a mortar coating indicating {{that they may have}} been re-used as interior bricks in later repairs, alterations, or new construction. The best case scenario is the bricks were part of an earlier church at the same site, then re-used as interior bricks in the 1680 church. However, Upton asserts the bricks are clearly forgeries.|$|E
25|$|Concerning the {{differences}} and similarities in Machiavelli's advice to ruthless and tyrannical princes in The Prince and his more republican exhortations in Discourses on Livy, many {{have concluded that}} The Prince, although written as advice for a monarchical prince, contains arguments for the superiority of republican regimes, {{similar to those found}} in the Discourses. In the 18th century, the work was even called a satire, for example by Jean-Jacques Rousseau. More recently, commentators such as Leo Strauss and Harvey Mansfield have agreed that The Prince <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>read</b> <b>as</b> having a deliberate comical irony.|$|E
25|$|In 1972, {{art critic}} Leo Steinberg {{in his essay}} The Philosophical Brothel posited a wholly {{different}} explanation for {{the wide range of}} stylistic attributes. Using the earlier sketches—which had been ignored by most critics—he argued that far from evidence of an artist undergoing a rapid stylistic metamorphosis, the variety of styles <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>read</b> <b>as</b> a deliberate attempt, a careful plan, to capture the gaze of the viewer. He notes that the five women all seem eerily disconnected, indeed wholly unaware of each other. Rather, they focus solely on the viewer, their divergent styles only furthering the intensity of their glare.|$|E
