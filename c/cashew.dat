5|$|Kerala {{produces}} 97% of {{the national}} output of black pepper and accounts for 85% of the natural rubber in the country. Coconut, tea, coffee, <b>cashew,</b> and spices—including cardamom, vanilla, cinnamon, and nutmeg are the main agricultural products. 80% of India's export quality <b>cashew</b> kernels are prepared in Kollam. The key agricultural staple is rice, with varieties grown in extensive paddy fields. Home gardens made up {{a significant portion of}} the agricultural sector. Related animal husbandry is touted by proponents as a means of alleviating rural poverty and unemployment among women, the marginalised, and the landless. The state government promotes these activities via educational campaigns and the development of new cattle breeds such as the Sunandini.|$|E
5|$|Fishing is {{the primary}} source of income, {{although}} coconut palm, buxa coloring, <b>cashew</b> nuts and fruits are produced for trade. Because of its reef and extensive beaches, the snorkeling industry is gaining in popularity in Msambweni, and holiday cottages and hotels have sprung up in the area, such as the Msambweni Beach House. The town is noted for its leprosarium and contains the Msambweni District Hospital. The Koromojo Dam is immediately north of the town.|$|E

5|$|Before the {{recognition}} {{of more than one}} species, differences in population density were noted between southern forests like Kirindy and northern forests near Ambanja. Later, it was recognized that Coquerel's giant mouse lemur was found in lower densities than the northern giant mouse lemur. The former range between 30 and 210individuals per square kilometer (250acres), with lower densities in open areas of the forest, while the latter has been recorded with 385 to 1,086individuals per km2. However, {{in the case of the}} northern giant mouse lemur, populations were found in more isolated forest fragments and it is thought that their consumption of introduced <b>cashew</b> and mango help sustain these higher populations.|$|E
5|$|Damage was {{heaviest}} in Mozambique, {{estimated at}} about $20million (1994USD). Cyclone Nadia severely affected four provinces in the country, primarily Nampula Province where it moved ashore. There, 85% {{of the houses}} were destroyed, and across its path, the cyclone left 1.5million people homeless. High winds caused widespread power outages, left areas without water, and significantly damaged crops, notably the <b>cashew</b> crop. The storm struck before the harvest, and lack of food resulted in 300deaths {{in the months after}} the storm. Across Mozambique, Nadia directly caused 240deaths and injured thousands. Effects spread as far inland as Malawi.|$|E

5|$|Mangalore {{developed}} as a port on the Arabian Sea—remaining, to this day, a major port of India. Mangalore's port handles 75 per cent of India's coffee and <b>cashew</b> exports. Mangalore {{is used as a}} staging point for sea traffic along the Malabar Coast. Mangalore was ruled by several major powers, including the Kadambas, Alupas, Vijayanagar Empire, Keladi Nayaks and the Portuguese. The city was a source of contention between the British and the Mysore rulers, Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan. Eventually annexed by the British in 1799, Mangalore remained part of the Madras Presidency until India's independence in 1947. The city was unified with the state of Mysore (now called Karnataka) in 1956.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} of pepper and natural rubber contributes {{significantly to the}} total national output. In the agricultural sector, coconut, tea, coffee, <b>cashew</b> and spices are important. The state's coastline extends for , and around 1.1million {{people in the state}} are dependent on the fishery industry which contributes 3% to the state's income. The state has the highest media exposure in India with newspapers publishing in nine languages, mainly English and Malayalam. Kerala is one of the prominent tourist destinations of India, with backwaters, beaches, Ayurvedic tourism and tropical greenery as its major attractions.|$|E
5|$|Both {{species are}} omnivorous, eating fruit, flowers, buds, insect excretions, tree gums, large insects, spiders, frogs, chameleons, snakes, small birds, and eggs. Coquerel's giant mouse lemur {{is thought to}} opportunistically prey on mouse lemurs after an {{individual}} was found with a half-eaten gray mouse lemur (M.murinus) in a trap. During June and July, {{at the peak of}} the dry season, this species relies on sugary excretions from the larvae of hemipteran and cochineal insects as well as tree gums. The sugary excretions are obtained by either licking them from the back of the insect or collecting the crystallized sugars that accumulate beneath the insect colony. During this time of year, feeding on insect secretions can account for 60% of feeding activity. In contrast, the northern giant mouse lemur relies on <b>cashew</b> fruits during the dry season.|$|E

5|$|Msambweni {{grew from}} a small village into a bustling little town. Fishing is {{important}} to the local community of Msambweni and is the primary source of income. The area is mainly Muslim and inhabited by Digo peoples. The Kwake District Development Plan 2002–2008 attempted to improve fish landing sites and beach access for fisherman on the coast of Msambweni. Coconut palm is grown, as are <b>cashew</b> nuts, fruits and buxa coloring. Maize, cassava, cowpeas and rice are grown for domestic consumption. There are numerous stalls along the main road in the town selling fruit and vegetables. Silica sand is mined at Msambweni and transported to Nairobi to make bottle glass. Beekeeping and seaweed farming are also local occupation and its commercialization in the area has been supported by ACT! Kenya with financial assistance from the European Union.|$|E
5|$|The {{leaf spring}} {{industry}} has {{its presence in}} Mangalore, with Canara Workshops Ltd. and Lamina Suspension Products Ltd. in the city. The Old Mangalore Port is a fishing port located at Bunder in Mangalore, where {{a large number of}} mechanised boats anchor. The traffic at this port was 122,000 tonnes during the years 2003–04. Fishing is a traditional occupation, and the products are exported to the surrounding regions. Mangalorean firms have a major presence in the tile, beedi, coffee, and <b>cashew</b> nut industry, although the tile industry has declined due to concrete being preferred in modern construction. The Albuquerque tile factory in Mangalore is one of India's oldest red roof tile manufacturing factories. The Ullal suburb of Mangalore produces hosiery and coir yarns, while beedi rolling is an important source of revenue to many in the city.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture, {{which was}} once a major {{occupation}} {{of the people of}} Dakshina Kannada, has taken a backseat because of the influx of money from natives settled in other cities, states and countries. Significant number of people from this district work in the Gulf (Middle East) countries and other states of India. Farms and fields are being converted into residential plots and commercial (shopping) complexes. Horticulture, though, has made some strides, and measures have been taken to improve the fruit plantation sector. The main crops of Dakshina Kannada are Paddy, Coconut, Arecanut, Black Pepper, <b>Cashew</b> and Cocoa. Rubber, Banana and Vanilla crops are also cultivated in the Sullia taluk. Rice is generally cultivated three seasons in a year, Karthika or Yenel (May–October), Suggi (October to January) and Kolake (January to April). Urad (Black gram) is grown in some areas during the season of Suggi. The Karnataka Milk Federation has a milk processing plant at Kulshekar in Mangalore. This plant processes milk procured from the cattle owned by farmers of the district.|$|E
