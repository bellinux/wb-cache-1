40|$|This paper {{presents}} visual <b>cues</b> for object <b>tracking</b> {{in video}} sequences using particle filtering. A consistent histogram-based framework is {{developed for the}} analysis of colour, edge and texture cues. The visual models for the cues are learnt from the first frame and the tracking can be carried out using {{one or more of the}} cues. A method for online estimation of the noise parameters of the visual models is presented along with a method for adaptively weighting the cues when multiple models are used. A particle filter (PF) is designed for object tracking based on multiple cues with adaptive parameters. Its performance is investigated and evaluated with synthetic and natural sequences and compared with the mean-shift tracker. We show that tracking with multiple weighted cues provides more reliable performance than single <b>cue</b> <b>tracking...</b>|$|R

50|$|In the {{technique}} used in all transverse-scan video tape recorders, the recording heads are mounted {{in a rapidly}} spinning drum which is pressed against the moving tape, so the heads move across the tape in a transverse or nearly vertical path, recording the video signal in consecutive parallel tracks sideways across the tape. This allows use of the entire width of the tape, storing much more data per inch of tape, compared to the fixed head used in audio tape recording, which records a single track down the tape. The heads move across the tape at the high speed necessary to record the high-bandwidth video signal, but the tape moves at a slower speed through the machine. In addition, three ordinary tracks are recorded {{along the edge of}} the tape by stationary recording heads. For correct playback, the motion of the heads has to be precisely synchronized with the motion of the tape through the capstan, so a control track of synchronizing pulses is recorded. The other two tracks are for the audio channel, and a <b>cuing</b> <b>track.</b>|$|R
5000|$|MPEG IMX is a 2001 {{development}} of the Digital Betacam format. Digital video compression uses H.262/MPEG-2 Part 2 encoding at a higher bitrate than Betacam SX: 30 Mbit/s (6:1 compression), 40 Mbit/s (4:1 compression) or 50 Mbit/s (3.3:1 compression). Unlike most other MPEG-2 implementations, IMX uses intraframe compression. Additionally, IMX ensures that each frame has the same exact size in bytes to simplify recording onto video tape. Video recorded in the IMX format is compliant with CCIR 601 specification, with eight channels of audio and timecode track. It lacks an analog audio (<b>cue)</b> <b>track</b> as the Digital Betacam, but will read it as channel 7 if used for playback. This format has been standardized in SMPTE 365M and SMPTE 356M as [...] "MPEG D10 Streaming".|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "quadruplex" [...] {{refers to}} the use of four {{magnetic}} record/reproduce heads mounted on a headwheel spinning transversely (width-wise) across the tape at a rate of 3,600 (for 14,400 recorded stripes per second) rpm for NTSC 525 lines/30fps-standard quad decks, and at 3,750 (for 15,000 stripes) rpm for those using the PAL 625 lines/25fps video standard. This method is called quadrature scanning, as opposed to the helical scan transport used by later videotape formats. The tape ran at a speed of either 7.5 or 15 in per second for NTSC 525/30 video recording, or 15.625 in per second for PAL 625/25 video; the audio, control, and cue tracks were recorded in a standard linear fashion near the edges of the tape. The <b>cue</b> <b>track</b> was used either as a second audio track, or for recording cue tones or time code for linear video editing.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike {{the later}} consumer-marketed 8-track {{cartridge}} developed later in 1964 by Bill Lear {{which had the}} pinch roller integrated in the cartridge, the Fidelipac cartridge had {{a hole in the}} right-hand bottom front corner of the cartridge, where the pinch roller, built into the player instead, would swing up into place to support the tape up against the capstan. While later machines from ATC, ITC, Harris, and others had machines where the pinch roller would automatically engage into the cartridge when the play button was pressed (the capstan motor was already running when the cart was inserted), early machines such as Sparta, Spot-matic, and others made the operator physically push or pull a lever to get the pinch roller in place before playback could begin. However, the 8-track was slower in speed ( [...] ips compared to Fidelipac's [...] ips) and did not have adequate tape support pads, and thus were not [...] "broadcast quality." [...] The lower speed and narrower tracks in 8-track cartridges led to higher noise and poorer frequency response. The 8-track design also lacked a <b>cue</b> <b>track.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Disc jockeys (or DJs) {{in clubs}} still {{rely heavily on}} vinyl records, as <b>cuing</b> <b>tracks</b> from {{cassette}} tapes is too slow and CDs did not allow creative playback options until quite recently. The term [...] "DJ", which had always meant a person who played various pieces of music on the radio (originally 78s, then 45s, then tape cartridges and reels; now cuts from CDs or tracks on a computer) - a play on the horse-racing term [...] "jockey" [...] - has also come to encompass all kinds of skills in [...] "scratching" [...] (record playback manipulation) and mixing dance music, rapping over the music or even playing musical instruments, but the original dance club (non-radio) definition was simply somebody who played records, alternating between two turntables. The skill came in subtly matching beats or instruments from one song to the next, providing a consistent dance tempo. DJs also made occasional announcements and chatted with patrons to take requests while songs were actually playing, similar to what radio disc jockeys have been doing since the 1940s.|$|R

50|$|The Digital Audio Stationary Head or DASH {{standard}} is a reel-to-reel, {{digital audio tape}} format introduced by Sony in early 1982 for high-quality multitrack studio recording and mastering, {{as an alternative to}} analog recording methods. DASH is capable of recording two channels of audio on a quarter-inch tape, and 24 or 48 tracks on 1/2 in tape on open reels of up to 14 inches. The data is recorded on the tape linearly, with a stationary recording head, as opposed to the DAT format, where data is recorded helically with a rotating head, {{in the same manner as}} a VCR. The audio data is encoded as linear PCM and boasts strong cyclic redundancy check (CRC) error correction, allowing the tape to be physically edited with a razor blade as analog tape would, e.g. by cutting and splicing, and played back with no loss of signal. In a two-track DASH recorder, the digital data is recorded onto the tape across nine data tracks: eight for the digital audio data and one for the CRC data; there is also provision for two linear analog <b>cue</b> <b>tracks</b> and one additional linear analog track dedicated to recording time code.|$|R

40|$|Background Impulsivity {{and reward}} {{expectancy}} are commonly inter-related. Waiting impulsivity, measured using the rodent 5 -Choice Serial Reaction Time (5 -CSRT) task, predicts compulsive cocaine seeking and sign (or <b>cue)</b> <b>tracking.</b> Here we assess human waiting impulsivity using a novel translational task, the 4 -CSRT, {{and the relationship}} with reward cues. Methods Healthy volunteers (n= 29) performed the monetary incentive delay task as a functional MRI study where subjects observe a cue predicting reward (cue) and wait to respond for high (£ 5), low (£ 1) or no reward. Waiting impulsivity was tested with the 4 -CSRT. Results For high reward prospects (£ 5 – no reward), greater waiting impulsivity on the 4 -CSRT correlated with greater medial orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and lower supplementary motor area (SMA) activity to cues. In response to high reward cues, greater waiting impulsivity was associated with greater subthalamic nucleus connectivity with OFC and greater subgenual cingulate connectivity with anterior insula but decreased connectivity with regions implicated in action selection and preparation. Conclusion These findings highlight a shift towards regions implicated in reward valuation and a shift towards compulsivity away from higher level motor preparation and action selection and response. We highlight the role of reward sensitivity and impulsivity, mechanisms potentially linking human waiting impulsivity with incentive approach and compulsivity, theories highly relevant to disorders of addiction. status: publishe...|$|R
