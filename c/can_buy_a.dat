5|$|In 2003, a {{congestion}} charge {{was introduced to}} reduce traffic volumes in the city centre. With a few exceptions, motorists are required to pay £10 per day to drive within a defined zone encompassing much of central London. Motorists who are residents of the defined zone <b>can</b> <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> greatly reduced season pass. London government initially expected the Congestion Charge Zone to increase daily peak period Underground and bus users by 20,000 people, reduce road traffic by 10 to 15 per cent, increase traffic speeds by 10 to 15 per cent, and reduce queues by 20 to 30 per cent. Over {{the course of several}} years, the average number of cars entering the centre of London on a weekday was reduced from 195,000 to 125,000 cars– a 35-per-cent reduction of vehicles driven per day.|$|E

5|$|Frog Fractions {{begins with}} a frog sitting on a lily pad. The player {{controls}} the frog, and must use its tongue to attack insects, while collecting and protecting fruit. The game later introduces upgrades that the player may purchase, including lock-on targeting, a cybernetic brain, and a flying dragon. When the player collects enough fruit, they <b>can</b> <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> warp drive, which lets them ride their dragon through an asteroid field to Bug Mars, where the player then battles an alien robot squid. The player is then sent to Bug Court, where they sign their work visa. The player then travels under the water below Bug Mars, while listening to a narrated history {{of the creation of}} boxing. At the end of the maze, the player activates a spaceship, and must complete a text adventure game to return to Bug Mars, where the game appears to end (actually fake credits). Upon returning, the player runs for president in a music simulator game. Regardless of how well they perform, they succeed in being elected president, and must complete a business simulator manufacturing bug pornography to unlock further upgrades. Once all required upgrades are collected the game concludes. The game takes about one hour to complete.|$|E

25|$|A trader who {{expects a}} stock's price to {{increase}} <b>can</b> <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> call {{option to purchase}} the stock at a fixed price ("strike price") at a later date, rather than purchase the stock outright. The cash outlay on the option is the premium. The trader would have no obligation to buy the stock, but only {{has the right to}} do so at or before the expiration date. The risk of loss would be limited to the premium paid, unlike the possible loss had the stock been bought outright.|$|E
25|$|The rivers {{provide the}} most obvious means of {{transporting}} goods and people. A 700-kilometre boat journey from Basankusu to the capital, Kinshasa, can take several weeks. Major barge operators are Transports Fluvial et Commerce de l'Equateur (TFCE) and Office National des Transports (ONATRA). Passengers often travel in cramped conditions, in some cases travelling atop the logs being pushed along the river by the barges. They are victim to high prices for food and other essentials along the way. The frequent breakdown of these river boats puts passengers in a precarious position regarding daily sustenance; a delay of several days can oblige passengers to sell all their belongings so that they <b>can</b> <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> meal. The poor communication within the country, generally, means that passengers cannot be helped by friends or family.|$|E
25|$|A trader who {{expects a}} stock's price to {{decrease}} <b>can</b> <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> put option {{to sell the}} stock at a fixed price ("strike price") at a later date. The trader will be {{under no obligation to}} sell the stock, but only has the right to do so at or before the expiration date. If the stock price at expiration is below the exercise price by more than the premium paid, he will make a profit. If the stock price at expiration is above the exercise price, he will let the put contract expire and only lose the premium paid. In the transaction, the premium also plays a major role as it enhances the break-even point. For example, if exercise price is 100, premium paid is 10, then a spot price of 100 to 90 is not profitable. He would make a profit if the spot price is below 90.|$|E

Kenneth stops by and informs Jenna that actress Mischa Barton is on the phone and wants to speak with her. Jenna, however, tells Kenneth to tell Barton that the deal is off as she has decided to go country. In the second scene, Jack and Lenny go through Kenneth's page desk, while Kenneth is participating in the page strike.

500|$|Millennium Force's {{entrance}} is located behind the Cedar Point & Lake Erie Railroad's Celebration Plaza station. The queue is situated between the ride's last overbanked turn and the station. A DJ booth is provided to entertain waiting visitors; the park's [...] "Jamming DJ's" [...] take requests for family friendly songs {{from people in}} the queue. It was then replaced by Cedar Point's FUNtv, which plays music videos of popular songs, the Gatekeeper/Maverick shuffle, park trivia, sports news, park advertisements, weather forecasts, and popular news headlines. [...] About a month after Millennium's debut, Cedar Point introduced a new queue system known as [...] "Ticket to Ride" [...] (later FreeWay) to reduce the wait time. Visitors could buy tickets then return later and wait in a shorter line. This system was discontinued in 2004 after several people complained it was unfair that others were going ahead of them in line. In 2012, Cedar Point introduced its Fast Lane queue system on the ride; visitors <b>can</b> <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> wristband which enables them to wait in a shorter line. The system was tested at Kings Island the previous year, where it received positive reviews.|$|E

Although {{he does not have}} the money, Tom reveals part-ownership in a nightclub is a longtime dream of his, so he seeks assistance from his fast-talking friend, Jean-Ralphio (Ben Schwartz), who contributes $5,000. Tom has $4,000 of his own but still needs $1,000, so he seeks further help from his co-workers. Donna (Retta) expresses an interest, but decides against it when she meets Jean-Ralphio, of whom she immediately declares, [...] "I hate that guy." [...] Meanwhile, when Andy's (Chris Pratt) band-mate Burly (Andrew Burlinson) tells Andy he can no longer live with him, April (Aubrey Plaza) helps Andy look for an apartment. They find one near her house, prompting a smitten April to note that they can carpool to work together. But when Andy learns Tom needs $1,000, he forgoes the apartment to give Tom the money as a gift. April is surprised by the choice and disappointed with the result. In the episode's final scene, Tom is shown enjoying his nightclub part ownership, until he learns Donna has bought three shares herself.|$|E
500|$|Dissenting, Justice Scalia {{would have}} held that {{although}} Abramski made a false statement by claiming {{that he was the}} buyer/transferee, since Alvarez was lawfully able to buy the gun, the statement is not [...] "with respect to any fact material to the lawfulness of the sale," [...] which is the requirement in §922(a)(6). Additionally, the dissent criticized the government's use of the [...] "agency law" [...] principle to determine that Abramski was a third party’s common-law agent for Alvarez. Instead, the dissent believed that common English should be used to interpret statutes, and therefore, under the statue, Abramski was the [...] "person" [...] buying the gun, not Alvarez. Furthermore, the dissent did not think that the statute is [...] "rendered meaningless" [...] simply because one <b>can</b> <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> gun on behalf of another, just like it is not rendered meaningless when one gifts a gun. The dissent also wondered why the majority wouldn't agree that this is yet another loophole to a statute that has so many loopholes, and argued that perhaps it was congress' intent to only limit the actual person at the counter. The dissent also stated that even if the majority had the proper interpretation of the statute, the ambiguity should be resolved in favor of lenity. Regarding the Section 924 charges, the dissent explained that the statute clearly lists what the dealer is required to maintain on record, and that {{the answer to the question}} of whether he is the actual buyer is not on the list. The dissent stated that the majority's interpretation ultimately carried the text too far. [...] "f the bureaucrats responsible for creating Form 4473 decided to ask about the buyer’s favorite color, a false response would be a federal crime." [...] Justice Scalia concluded with the statement: ...|$|E
