25|$|Meanwhile, on February 24, the Amyotha Hluttaw (the Upper House) invited {{six major}} groups of {{stakeholders}} - the NNER, the ACDE, some 20 political parties, relevant {{members of the}} public, civil society groups and individuals who submitted the suggestions to the parliament - on the <b>current</b> <b>issue</b> to attend public hearings between March 5 – 15. Later that day, the State Sangha Maha Nayaka Committee (SSMNC) – a body of government-appointed monks in charge of regulating Buddhist monks in Burma – issued {{a statement to the}} parliament publicly accusing that the proposed amendment bill that recognized unions will result in confusion between religious and political issues, leading to the demise of the roots of Theravada Buddhism]]. Arkar Moe Thu, a member of NNER, however, pointed out that according to Article 68(a), “schools that only teach religion are not governed by the law”. Meanwhile, the students confirmed that they would continue marching on March 1, accusing the parliament for intentionally delaying the process of passing the amendment bill.|$|E
25|$|The TAIC {{released}} its interim {{report on the}} accident on 10 May 2012. Examination of the wreckage showed electrical arcing on the basket {{and one of the}} four propane cylinders, consistent with a power line strike. Details about the maintenance and record-keeping of the balloon were released. The most recent inspection had occurred on 14 September 2011, with several errors made in the records and inspection. The inspection report erroneously recorded the type certificate as B2GL, which is applicable to Cameron Balloons United States for serial numbers 5000 and higher – ZK-XXF was manufactured in the United Kingdom and was serial number 4300, so the correct type certificate was BB12. It also recorded the basket and burners as being of Cameron Balloons, not as being of Thunder and Colt. Anomalies were also identified in the maintenance logbook, including incorrect identification of the basket and burners, no record of four airworthiness directives, and no entry regarding the use of the gas bottles. The maintenance provider was also found to be using outdated versions of the Flight and Maintenance Manuals, using the 1992-released Issue 7 rather than the <b>current</b> <b>Issue</b> 10, and that the maintainers had tested the strength of the envelope by hand, rather than the prescribed method of using a spring gauge to measure actual strength.|$|E
500|$|Costume {{designer}} Amy Stofsky {{ensured that}} the military wardrobe seen in the film reflected the 2005 time period. According to Stofsky, what the fallen servicemen wore back then is no longer <b>current</b> <b>issue,</b> as the United States Armed Forces stopped manufacturing the uniforms in 2006. While researching the time period, Stofsky met with the fallen servicemen's families, as well as Navy SEAL teammates. Stofsky and the wardrobe department collaborated with the Hollywood-based costume facility Western Costume {{to find the right}} fabric for the military uniforms. She and her team manufactured uniforms for the film's lead actors, extras, stunt and photo doubles, and military personnel who were also acting as extras. Stofksy noted that a total of [...] "36 cookie cutter uniforms" [...] were produced for Mark Wahlberg's character Marcus Luttrell.|$|E

500|$|Around the episode's {{original}} broadcast in early 2005, the same-sex marriage question {{was one of}} the hottest political issues in America. It had been an especially hot topic during the then-recent presidential election in the United States. Marty Kaplan, a professor at Annenberg School for Communication and radio host on Air America Radio, commented that the episode is telling [...] "those who demonize homosexuality, or what [...] call the homosexual agenda," [...] anything from [...] "lighten up" [...] to [...] "get out of town". This {{was not the first time}} that an episode of the show had brought up a <b>current</b> <b>issue.</b> Writing in an article about [...] "There's Something About Marrying" [...] for The New York Times, Sharon Waxman said that [...] "as television's longest-running situation comedy, The Simpsons is no stranger to hot-button social, religious and political issues, mocking wardrobe malfunctions, Hollywood liberals and born-again Christians, among other targets." ...|$|E
500|$|The show's correspondents {{have two}} {{principal}} roles: experts with satirical senior titles that Noah interviews about certain issues, or hosts of field reporting segments which often involve humorous commentary and interviews relating to a <b>current</b> <b>issue.</b> The current team of correspondents collectively known as [...] "The Best [...] News Team Ever" [...] includes Ronny Chieng, Michael Kosta, Desi Lydic, Hasan Minhaj, Dulcé Sloan and Roy Wood, Jr. Contributors {{appear on a}} less frequent basis, often with their own unique recurring segment or topic. Current contributors are Lewis Black, Neal Brennan, Michelle Wolf, and Gina Yashere. Ben Karlin says that the on-air talent contribute in many ways to the material they perform, playing an integral role {{in the creation of}} their field pieces as well as being involved with their scripted studio segments, either taking part early on in the writing process or adding improvised material during the rehearsal.|$|E
500|$|Sam Wollaston of The Guardian {{received}} the series positively, writing: [...] "Holby City has {{everything you want}} from a hospital drama: good–looking staff, a bit of love interest, a dishy doc, the odd <b>current</b> <b>issue</b> (no beds, badly–paid nurses) and bits {{where you have to}} look away", deeming it: [...] "Pretty good, really." [...] Stan Hey of The Mail on Sunday observed that on the strength of the opening episode, the series' success seemed [...] "fairly assured". He noted that: [...] "characters are only skin–deep as yet, being subsidiary to the plot, but a successful graft should be achieved during the series." [...] Kathleen Morgan of the Daily Record praised the casting of French and Griffin, writing: [...] "It will take a couple of episodes before both actors shake off their soapy history, but with some decent plots and good lines, they should make the grade." [...] Morgan deemed Irving the star of the show, and commented: [...] "With Irving in the driving seat, Holby City looks like it is on the right track." ...|$|E

2500|$|A <b>current</b> <b>issue</b> is {{the control}} of bovine tuberculosis, which can also be carried by badgers. [...] It is alleged that the badgers are infecting the cows.

The government is currently consulting on this issue. As of 16 September 2011, a total of 27 online petitions had attracted 65,000 signatures opposing the plan.|$|E
