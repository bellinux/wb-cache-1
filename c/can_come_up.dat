Shenbagapandian wants to find the answer to a {{question}} posed by his wife— whether the fragrance from a woman's hair is natural or artificial— and announces a reward of 1000gold coins to anyone who <b>can</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> with the answer. A poor poet named Dharumi desperately wants the reward and starts to break down in the Meenakshi Amman Temple. Shiva, hearing his cries, {{takes the form of a}} poet and gives Dharumi a poem containing the answer. Overjoyed, Dharumi takes the poem to Shenbagapandian's court and recites it, but Nakkeerar, the court's head poet, claims the poem's meaning is incorrect. On hearing this, Shiva argues with Nakkeerar about the poem's accuracy, burning him to ashes when he refuses to relent. Later, Shiva revives Nakkeerar, and says that he only wanted to test his knowledge. Nakkeerar asks the king to give the reward to Dharumi.|$|E

Several of Chigumi's ideas were included in House such as a reflection in a mirror attacking the viewer, a watermelon being pulled out of a well appearing like a human head, and a house that eats girls. Other themes Chigumi suggested drew upon her own childhood fears. These fears included a pile of futons falling on her that felt like a monster attacking her, a large loud clock at her grandparents home, and getting her fingers caught in between her piano keys. Nobuhiko shared these story ideas with screenwriter Chiho Katsura. These ideas reminded Katsura of a short story by Walter de la Mare about an old woman who is visited by her granddaughters who then puts them in a trunk.|$|E

The Washington Post Tom Shales has described the dream sequence as [...] "the scene that separated the men from the boys", noting that it further polarized the series' audience, attracting loyal viewers and putting off others.

According to Nielsen Soundscan, Napalm Death sold 367,654 units between May 1991 and November 2003, while Carcass sold 220,374 units in the same period. The inclusion of Napalm Death's [...] "Twist the Knife (Slowly)" [...] on the Mortal Kombat soundtrack brought the band much greater visibility, as the compilation scored a Top 10 position in the Billboard 200 chart and went platinum {{in less than a}} year.< The originators of the style have expressed some ambivalence regarding {{the subsequent}} popularity of grindcore. Pete Hurley, the guitarist of Extreme Noise Terror, declared that he had no interest in being remembered as a pioneer of this style: [...] "'grindcore' was a legendarily stupid term coined by a hyperactive kid from the West Midlands, and {{it had nothing to do}} with us whatsoever. ENT were, are, and - I suspect - always will be a hardcore punk band... not a grindcore band, a stenchcore band, a trampcore band, or any other sub-sub-sub-core genre-defining term you <b>can</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> with." [...] Lee Dorian of Napalm Death indicated that [...] "Unfortunately, I think the same thing happened to grindcore, if you want to call it that, as happened to punk rock - all the great original bands were just plagiarised by a billion other bands who just copied their style identically, making it no longer original and no longer extreme." ...|$|E

Francis Dass of the New Straits Times Press referred to it as [...] "one of the weaker episodes" [...] of the fifth season. The A.V.

[...] Furthermore, VanDerWerff felt that [...] "the more Scott and Wollaeger try to continue explaining this and tie it into the idea of child abuse, the less it attains any of the power or tragedy they want it to have." [...] Starpulse, in a run-down of the best and worst episodes and villains of the series, named the killer trees the worst monster-of-the-week and wrote, [...] " [...] proved that even the X-Files writers <b>can</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> completely dry on their scary creeps sometimes." [...] Critical Myth's John Keegan gave the episode 4/10, and, while praising the [...] "interesting concept" [...] of the episode, concluded that it was filled with [...] "odd inconsistencies, [...] is definitely not one of the better episodes of the season." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode three-and-a-half stars out of five. [...] The two wrote positively of {{the first part of the}} episode noting that [...] "director Ralph Hemecker [...] the eeriness to the fore, and [...] this a more honest-to-truth scary slice of X-File than has been offered in ages." [...] Shearman and Pearson, however, argued that the episode's references to Psycho and its [...] "lack of explanation" [...] result in the episode approaching [...] "nonsense." [...] Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four. She wrote that, [...] "the plot of 'Schizogeny' is more tangled than the episode's paranormal root system, but underneath lies some powerful themes." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{reviews for}} Lights and Sounds were mostly mixed upon release, {{particularly}} from mainstream media, but {{some critics have}} stated that the album had fallen well short of the standards of Ocean Avenue, the album's predecessor. Kelefa Sanneh of the New York Times, in review of the album, wrote: [...] "To listeners {{on either side of}} rock's latest generational divide, there's a big difference -- the difference of a decade -- between being a loser and being a twerp... Lights and Sounds is Yellowcard's attempt to split that difference." [...] Sanneh reports that the song [...] "Two Weeks from Twenty", one of the band's anti-war song, [...] "sounds suspiciously like Green Day; the lyrics echo the plot of the video for Green Day's 'Wake Me Up When September Ends'." [...] Despite this, Sanneh {{goes on to say that}} Yellowcard is still [...] "pretty good" [...] at [...] "writing sweeping, upbeat punk-rock love songs". Ben Breier of Kent News wrote: [...] "One thing is certain: The Yellowcard you grew to know and love circa Ocean Avenue is no longer with us. The band has vastly matured when compared to past records, but it comes at a price [...] members forgot what made them occasionally catchy and addictive in the first place. It's clearly the right direction for the band, but Yellowcard needs to further refine its new style before it <b>can</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> with something above average." [...] Mike Schiller of PopMatters, who was somewhat displeased with the album, wrote that the album does not [...] "make up for the overabundance of flaccid mediocrity on display throughout most of the album". Schiller went on to say, [...] "Lights and Sounds may be Yellowcard’s attempt at a big, serious album, but the band doesn’t sound even remotely ready." [...] Nick Cowen from Drowned in Sound wrote: [...] "Those who register for Pop-Punk 101 will receive Yellowcard’s Lights And Sounds as their first set-work; the Jacksonville quintet's new album would be the perfect teaching aid, as it's technically proficient while being boring and forgettable enough not to inspire the temptation to plagiarise." [...] Cowen concluded that the album [...] "is a substandard, second-tier album with some strings thrown in for good measure. It's really not worth the money in your wallet [...] even if that wallet is attached to a very long chain." [...] Now magazine claimed that the band [...] "may be in the right place, it's clear they're simply incapable of realizing this clumsy faux magnum opus." ...|$|E
