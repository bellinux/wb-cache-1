40|$|BACKGROUND: Nerve {{tumors of the}} {{clitoris}} {{and particularly}} neuromas are extremely rare. CASE: A 27 -year-old infibulated African woman suffering from chronic vulvar pain increasing with sexual intercourse presented for gynecologic care. Examination revealed a painful clitoral tumor. The tumor was surgically excised. The diagnosis of amputation neuroma of the clitoris was made by microscopic examination. CONCLUSION: This is the first well-documented case of <b>clitoral</b> <b>amputation</b> neuroma occurring after female genital cutting. Considering {{the high number of}} genital cuttings practiced, these tumors are probably under-reported in the literature. © 2003 by The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

40|$|Vulvar {{basal cell}} {{carcinoma}} (BCC) is rare, accounting for less than 5 % of all vulvar neoplasms and less than 1 % of all BCCs. Vulvar BCCs are usually diagnosed late because they are often asymptomatic and tend to grow at slow rates. They may be invasive and destructive if neglected or improperly treated. Nevertheless, {{they have a very}} low propensity for metastatic spread, but frequently recur after simple excision. We report a 78 year-old woman presenting with the complaint of painful vulvar ulceration and vaginal bleeding. The physical examination revealed a 3 × 2 cm indurated nodulo-ulcerative lesion involving the clitoris, both labia minora and left labium majus. The histopathology was consistent with the “solid type BCC” that invaded the subcutaneous tissue without lymph node metastasis. The patient underwent wide local excision with <b>clitoral</b> <b>amputation</b> and remained disease free at post-surgical follow-up after 18 months...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. 21 α-hydroxylase {{deficiency}} is {{the most}} frequent cause of virilization in patients with female karyotype due to exposure of a female fetus to excess of androgen. We report anatomical and cosmetic results of feminizing genital reconstruction of two related patients (second cousin) with XX karyotype born with urogenital sinus anomalies (UGS) and not treated at birth. Materials and Metods. Patient 1 is 6 -years old with ambiguous genitalia graded as Prader V and never undergone therapy or surgery. Patient 2 is 10 -years old, graded as Prader IV and subjected to hormonal therapy and <b>clitoral</b> <b>amputation</b> {{at the age of}} 6. Mobilization of urogenital sinus, pull-through of vagina and tubulization of urethra was performed in both after placement of Foley chateters in vagina and bladder by cisto-vaginoscopy. Genitoplasty involved refashioning the tissues to create minora and majora labia and, after removal of corpora, partial clitorectomy was carried in patient 1 and clitoridal reconstruction in patient 2. Result. Vaginal introitus was positioned in the vestibule region below urethral meatus. Foley chateters was removed after two weeks in narcosis and the cosmetic and anatomic result was good. Conclusion. Goals of feminizing genitoplasty are to restore, soon as possible, anatomy achieving a more feminine appareance with a vagina for menstruation, to preserve reproductive capacity and to prevent urological sequelae but it’s also important to contribute in a development of a more stable gender identity. This procedure in two stage, based on an accurate diagnosis, is good to create feminine genital appareance in children with female pseudohermaphroditism expecially if not treated at birth...|$|E
