We try to identify if <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> Argentina trade policy toward a set of countries had a differential effect, depending on if goods were already traded, or on the contrary, if tariff changes affected mostly imports of new goods. We distinguish between the effects of changing tariffs and changing trade preferences. The econometric evidence shows that the effect of <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>tariff</b> preferences on the probability of Argentina importing from other ALADI members has been rather small, with most of the effect being explained by <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>tariff</b> <b>rates</b> levied on imports from these countries.

40|$|This paper investigates how {{corruption}} adjusts {{to policy}} reforms that change opportunities for bribe extraction for different agents involved in bribery deals. We exploit an exogenous <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>tariff</b> schedules to identify <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> the incidence, the distribution, {{and in the}} type of bribes paid for clearing cargo through international borders. We find that <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>tariff</b> <b>rates</b> are associated with a reduction in the incidence of tariff evasion: a 1 % reduction <b>in</b> average <b>tariff</b> <b>rates</b> is associated with a 90 % reduction in the probability of paying a bribe for the product that went from a high to a low tariff category. This reduction is however partially offset by significant substitution and income effects. Following the overall reduction <b>in</b> <b>tariffs,</b> customs officials move from colluding with shippers to accept bribes for tariff evasion to other more extortionary types of corruption. We also find suggestive income effects as shippers shift from paying bribes to customs officials to paying bribes to other border officials in charge of other phases of the clearing process. Our results therefore suggest that corruption was displaced from collusive agreements involving tariff evasion to more distortionary, coercive bribery deals. This can have important implications for the overall efficiency costs of corruption and should therefore be considered in the design of anti-corruption policies...|$|R

40|$|The welfare {{analyses}} of preferential trading arrangements have {{been characterized by}} generally inconclusive and messy results. In this paper, I attempt to give order {{to the analysis of}} one important case: a union between two small countries. The analysis has two key advantages over the existing literature. First, the model employed is fully general in that it allows for goods that are exported and imported by both partners as well as those that are exported by one and imported by the other partner. Second, the results are derived for finite <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>tariff</b> <b>rates</b> rather than being limited to infinitesimally small changes. The main results of the paper can be summarized as follows. First, assuming all goods to be normal in consumption, if two small countries form a free trade area or exchange some tariff preferences, their joint welfare falls or rises as their joint output, valued at world prices, rises or falls. Second, if, in addition, the numeraire good uses only labor and all other goods use labor and a sector-specific factor, the exchange of preferences or free trade area necessarily lowers the union’s joint welfare. Third, a union member is necessarily hurt by its own preferential liberalization. The higher are its external tariffs and the larger its imports from the partner, the more it loses from extending the preferences. Fourth, in the specific-factors case just mentioned, a union member necessarily benefits from the tariff preference it receives from the partner. The more it exports to the partner and the higher the latter’s tariffs, the greater the gain. Finally, in the specific-factors case, an FTA benefits a member more the larger its bilateral trade surplus with the partner and the lower its external tariffs relative to the partner. ...|$|R
40|$|Sufficient energy {{availability}} and utilization {{lie at the}} core of not only the mining industry but also the economic growth of South Africa. The mining industry {{is one of the major}} consumers of electricity in South Africa; accounting for approximately 17. 4 percent. The focal point of the research project was on New Denmark Colliery; an Anglo American Thermal Coal operation located in the Mpumalanga Province. The main objective of the research project was to analyse energy consumption, economics and management at the mine. The study provides a framework for understanding significant energy uses in a mining operation; electricity costs and some of the mechanisms, tools and initiatives that can be used to manage energy optimally. This provides the mining industry with a platform to become part of the energy solution in South Africa. The author conducted comparative time series studies to determine energy consumption as a function of production, specific activities at the mine, carbon dioxide emissions, electricity costs; from which the forecasts were made to determine the amount of electricity consumption and costs in the future. It can be submitted from the monthly comparative studies that more electricity is consumed during high demand season (June, July and August); as a result the costs are also very high. It was concluded that mining, ventilation and coal transportation consume relatively more electricity compared to other activities at the mine. It was further submitted that the higher the level of production the higher the quantity of electricity consumption and vice versa. It was further concluded that although the amount of electricity consumption has been fluctuating over the years, electricity costs have been escalating at an alarming <b>rate</b> due to <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>tariff</b> <b>rate,</b> inflation and the structure of the tariff. The cost of power will increase drastically over the next five years, due to uncertainty regarding the magnitude of the pending Eskom tariff increases. It was recommended that mining operations must create energy management models for their mining operations in order to reduce the amount of electricity consumption, minimize the electricity costs and secure long term electricity supply. Models created must be aligned to company vision, organizational structure and also operational practice at the mine...|$|R

This will change when a new 42 -MW hydropower system becomes operational in 2012. According to FEA estimates, diesel-based electricity generation in Fiji is 15 % costlier than hydro-based generation, and in 2010 alone, FEA reported a loss of Fijian $ 17 million ascribed mainly to higher diesel consumption.|$|R

40|$|With the 2009 Treaty of Lisbon, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) was {{inserted}} into {{the framework of the}} existing Common Commercial Policy (CCP) as Article 207 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). Article 207 (1) TFEU provides: 1. The common commercial policy shall be based on uniform principles, particularly with regard to <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>tariff</b> <b>rates,</b> the conclusion of tariff and trade agreements relating to trade in goods and services, and the commercial aspects of intellectual property, foreign direct investment, the achievement of uniformity in measures of liberalisation, export policy and measures to protect trade such as those to be taken in the event of dumping or subsidies. The common commercial policy shall be conducted {{in the context of the}} principles and objectives of the Union 2 ̆ 7 s external action. To many (member states) this new competence came as a surprise since it was not substantially debated during the Lisbon Treaty negotiations but seems to have entered the final text in a rather unnoticed fashion. Immediately after the entry-into-force of the Lisbon Treaty the debate focused on the scope of the new investment power and in particular on the limitation to FDI and its implications for the practice of EU treaty-making, whether the “new” EU investment power was limited to questions of market access or extended to the so-called post-investment phase as well, and whether future EU investment treaties would contain investor-State dispute settlement provisions. Meanwhile the EU Commission has strongly asserted its FDI powers under Article 207 (1) TFEU and plans to conclude treaties that cover the entire range of issues currently addressed in EU Member State BITs. Also the initial reluctance towards investor-State dispute settlement seems to have given way to a more positive attitude in this regard. In July 2010, the Commission issued some preliminary thoughts in a Communication which were taken up by the Council’s Conclusions of October 2010 and the Parliament’s Resolution of April 2011. While the Union is expected to issue more detailed documents by the end of 2012, this paper will discuss the potential shape of future EU investment treaties as far it can be discerned already. It will also address the underlying power struggle between the member states and the Union regarding the control over investment policy. At the same time, calls by various stakeholders for often conflicting goals, such as more protection against the “regulatory chill” of investment protection, more efficient tools to implement investor obligations and more effective enforcement of investment awards, will be addressed.

In an economy with free entry, which affects the product market competition, we show that, even if there is no other tax reform such as a profit tax reform, the market mechanism itself takes care of the loss of government revenue following a tariff reduction if entry is sufficiently costly. A compensatory profit tax to compensate the loss of government revenue following a tariff reduction is required for an intermediate level of entry cost. If the entry cost is very small, the loss of government revenue following a tariff reduction cannot be compensated even with a profit tax reform. Hence, the net effect of a tariff reduction on government revenue therefore depends on how much tariff and tax revenues are created by entry, which is affected by <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> both the <b>tariff</b> <b>rate</b> and the profit tax rate.

This paper addresses theoretically and empirically the influence of variable and fixed export costs in explaining the likely heterogeneity in the trade-cost elasticity. We offer four potential contributions. First, for motivation, we show empirically that the heterogeneity in various economic integration agreements 2 ̆ 019 (EIAs 2 ̆ 019) partial effects on trade flows far exceeds that explained simply by variation in depth of the trade liberalization. Second, we use standard Armington- and Melitz-type general equilibrium trade models to motivate theoretically the roles of variable trade costs and of fixed and variable export costs, respectively, for explaining (endogenous) heterogeneous partial effects of <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> ad valorem <b>tariff</b> <b>rates</b> on trade flows, as well as on intensive and extensive product margins (with or without network effects and with an untruncated Pareto distribution in the Melitz model). Third, we show empirically that the heterogeneity in EIAs 2 ̆ 019 partial effects on the intensive margin is explained well just by distance and adjacency, capturing variable natural trade costs; however, the heterogeneity in EIAs 2 ̆ 019 partial effects on the extensive margin is explained empirically by distance and adjacency, as well as several other cultural and institutional variables, capturing variable and fixed export costs.

Average Nominal <b>Tariff</b> <b>Rates</b> and average Effective <b>Tariff</b> <b>Rates</b> decreased from pre-reform levels of 20 % and 48 % respectively in 1993 to 7 % and 13 % in 2004, with large dispersions across the different sub-industries. The core of this work explores {{the impact of this}} trade reform on the sector's labour and product market. In this dissertation We examine three novel questions regarding the impact of trade policy in SA. In Chapter 1 Do Unions Matter?

This study extends the existing literature in two respects: firstly, we control for the potential effect of labor market institutions, such as collective bargaining power, in assessing the relationship between tariffs and industry wages.

Evidence from South Africa we extend the empirical trade literature examining the effect of trade reform, proxied by the reductions <b>in</b> Nominal <b>Tariff</b> <b>Rates</b> (NTR), on productivity, the latter estimated as the production function residual. We examine the different channels by which tariff cuts affect productivity growth. In the context of the South African trade reform experience, using industry level data for the manufacturing sector and covering the reform period from 1994 to 2004, we disentangle the differential effect of increased foreign competition, proxied by reductions in NTR, and that of the imported technology, proxied by the reductions <b>in</b> Input <b>Tariff</b> <b>Rates</b> (ITR), on productivity growth. Our measure of efficiency growth controls for the effect of tariff reductions on markups. The results suggest that the efficiency difference between foreign and domestic inputs have the major effect on productivity gains. Declines in ITR significantly raise productivity growth compared to an insignificant effect for NTR. Additionally, we find that higher protection rates are associated with higher markups, albeit this finding is not robust across all specifications. In Chapter 3 Heterogenous Trade Barrier Effects: What Can We Learn From a Disaggregated Gravity Model? we relax the unrealistic assumption commonly imposed in gravity model estimations of equal elasticity of trade flows with respect to trade barriers across sectors and regions by using disaggregated industry level trade flows for South Africa's manufacturing sector and we test for heterogenous elasticities due to: (1) variations in the level of firm heterogeneity across sectors, and (2) differences in the size of trading partners. In line with theoretical predictions we find that the negative elasticity of exports to trade barriers increases for sectors with a higher level of firm homogeneity, supporting international trade models with heterogenous firms. Furthermore, we find that the negative elasticity of imports to trade barriers decreases for trading partners with larger export potential, emphasizing the objective of minimizing fixed costs of trading that is related to the number of countries with which South Africa, as an importer, trades.

Given that the average reduction <b>in</b> <b>tariff</b> <b>rates</b> was 10. 4 percent, the authors can conclude that approximately 31. 4 percent {{of the increase in}} agricultural imports from the EU 15 and CEEC was due to elimination of tariffs as Slovakia (and the other CEECs) joined the EU. agricultural trade; EU enlargement; Slovakia; trade liberalization...|$|R

Increased capital controls seem to reflect sanctions mainly against certain individuals and African states (IMF 2005; IMF 2006). Inter alia, prescriptions on the investment of pension account and restrictions for real estate investment by foreigners (the so-called Lex Koller) are counted as restrictive capital controls.|$|R

After {{more than a}} decade of implementation, significant achievements have been attained <b>in</b> terms of <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> the <b>tariff</b> structure. For example, quantitative restrictions on important commodities have been tariffied. The tariff structure has been simplified from a multi-layered one into a structure with fewer <b>tariff</b> <b>rates.</b> Furthermore, <b>tariff</b> <b>rates</b> have been substantially reduced. The objective of the paper is to analyze the effects of the tariff reform program using a computable general equilibrium model calibrated using Philippine data.

According to the HOS model if unskilled labor is the abundant factor, trade liberalization lowers the gender wage gap since women, who are predominantly less skilled, will see a relative increase in their wages.

In equation (9), trade liberalization will have the opposite effect on the sign of β as the demand for unskilled labor rises (β should be negative when the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>tariffs</b> is used as the trade measure, and positive for the trade volume measures).

The concept of a productivity improvement <b>in</b> <b>tariffs</b> and taxes is introduced and conditions for its existence are established. The authors prove that a Pareto-improving <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>tariffs</b> and domestic taxes exists if a productivity-improving <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>tariffs</b> exists and if the Weymark condition on the matrix of household demands holds. Conditions are established for particular tariff reforms, such as proportional reductions and reductions of extreme rates, to yield Pareto improvements in welfare.
