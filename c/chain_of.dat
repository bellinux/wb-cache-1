5|$|Many {{types of}} objects in {{abstract}} algebra can satisfy chain conditions, and usually if they satisfy an ascending chain condition, they are called Noetherian in her honor. By definition, a Noetherian ring satisfies an ascending chain condition on its left and right ideals, whereas a Noetherian group {{is defined as a}} group in which every strictly ascending <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> subgroups is finite. A Noetherian module is a module in which every strictly ascending <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> submodules becomes constant after a finite number of steps. A Noetherian space is a topological space in which every strictly ascending <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> open subspaces becomes constant after a finite number of steps; this definition makes the spectrum of a Noetherian ring a Noetherian topological space.|$|E

40|$|We present {{examples}} of the both types of bursts and show their similarities and differences. Then for <b>chains</b> <b>of</b> type I bursts a similar model as for drifting pulsation structures (DPSs) is proposed. We show that similarly as in the DPS, the <b>chains</b> <b>of</b> type I bursts can be generated by the fragmented magnetic reconnection associated with plasmoids interactions. To support this new model <b>of</b> <b>chains</b> <b>of</b> type I bursts, we present an effect of merging of two plasmoids to one larger plasmoid on the radio spectrum of DPS. This process can also explain the "wavy" appearance <b>of</b> some <b>chains</b> <b>of</b> type I bursts. Then we show that the <b>chains</b> <b>of</b> type I bursts with the "wavy" appearance {{can be used for}} estimation of the magnetic field strength in their sources. We think that differences <b>of</b> <b>chains</b> <b>of</b> type I bursts and DPSs are mainly owing to different regimes of the magnetic field reconnection. While in the case <b>of</b> <b>chains</b> <b>of</b> type I bursts the magnetic reconnection and plasmoid interactions are in the quasi-separatrix layer of the active region in more or less quasi-saturated regime, in the case of DPSs, observed in the impulsive phase of eruptive flares, the magnetic reconnection and plasmoids interactions are in the current sheet formed under the flare magnetic rope, which moves upwards and forces this magnetic reconnection.

40|$|The {{chemical}} {{relations among}} Bence-Jones proteins, myeloma proteins, and normal γ-globulins {{have been investigated}} {{by a variety of}} means. Starch gel electrophoresis in 8 M urea of reduced alkylated Bence-Jones proteins yielded patterns of bands corresponding to those of the light (L) polypeptide <b>chains</b> <b>of</b> the dissociated myeloma protein from the same patient. One instance in which this correspondence was found was chosen for extensive study. Chromatography on carboxymethylcellulose in 6 M urea was employed to isolate the light (L) polypeptide chains and heavy (H) polypeptide <b>chains</b> <b>of</b> the completely reduced and alkylated myeloma protein. Isolation of similarly treated Bence-Jones protein from the same patient corroborated the correspondence to the L <b>chains</b> <b>of</b> the myeloma protein. Amino acid analyses indicated that the compositions of the Bence-Jones protein and the L <b>chains</b> <b>of</b> the myeloma protein were identical. Moreover, the thermosolubility properties and spectrofluorometric behavior of the isolated L chains and Bence-Jones protein were similar. Ultracentrifugal analyses <b>of</b> the L <b>chains</b> <b>of</b> normal human 7 S γ-globulin showed that their molecular weight in 6 M urea was 20, 000. In aqueous solution their molecular weight was 41, 000, suggesting that they exist as dimers under these conditions. The L <b>chains</b> <b>of</b> normal human γ-globulin were found to have reversible thermosolubility properties similar to those of Bence-Jones proteins. The H <b>chains</b> <b>of</b> normal human γ-globulin did not share these properties. Using spectrofluorometric methods, characteristic molecular transitions were found upon heating Bence-Jones proteins and L chains. These transitions were indicated by an increase in the intensity of fluorescence at well defined temperatures as well as by reversible shifts in the wavelength of maximal emission. The findings suggest that Bence-Jones proteins are composed <b>of</b> L <b>chains</b> <b>of</b> the type found in normal and pathological γ-globu]ins...|$|R
40|$|Lipocalin-type {{prostaglandin}} D synthase (L-PGDS) is {{a highly}} glycosylated member of the lipocalin gene family and is secreted into various human body fluids.
