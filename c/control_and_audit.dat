25|$|The sale of Load Balancer {{left the}} company with staff and cash, but no product. Freedman had {{developed}} and marketed a 3-day UNIX security course in 1992, and had developed significant contacts within the banking, defense, and chip-making communities. These customers all had similar problems in managing large UNIX networks, specifically concerning the <b>control</b> <b>and</b> <b>audit</b> {{of the actions of}} the systems' administrators. The problem was that the root account used by systems administrators when reconfiguring parts of the system, was able to edit any of the audit trails created by the system. Freedman designed a new product, PowerBroker, that was similar in concept to today's sudo products, but which allowed centralized control and auditing of an entire network even down to the keystroke level, with the logs stored on a dedicated remote computer to which the system administrators typically did not have access. By vetting all access and logging through this remote machine, a secure log could be maintained. The system was ported to over 22 versions of UNIX to accommodate the newer, larger networks with hundreds or thousands of machines. Dean Huxley was responsible for most of the system-level programming on PowerBroker with Kevin Chmilar and Earle Lowe also contributing.|$|E

40|$|Fiscal {{decentralization}} {{in developing}} countries {{has been at the}} center stage of public sector reforms in the last two decades. Yet, {{a closer look at the}} recent reforms in the developing world indicates that decentralization does not necessarily translate into better outcomes because of waste, corruption, and inefficiencies. The success of decentralization depends on the existence of a framework that keeps local or “subnational ” governments on track and holds local government officials accountable for results—two missing components in most recent decentralization efforts. This paper attempts to close this implementation gap by developing a conceptual framework of internal <b>control</b> <b>and</b> <b>audit</b> at the local level.
