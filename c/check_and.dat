40|$|OBJECTIVE: One {{expression}} of the core psychopathology of eating disorders is the repeated <b>checking</b> <b>and</b> avoidance of shape or weight. Two studies are reported. The {{primary purpose of the}} first was to describe the phenomenology of such body <b>checking</b> <b>and</b> avoidance. The aim of the second was to compare body <b>checking</b> <b>and</b> avoidance in women with and without a clinical eating disorder. METHOD: In Study 1, 64 female patients with clinical eating disorders participated in a semistructured interview assessing the features of body <b>checking</b> <b>and</b> avoidance. In the second study, a self-report questionnaire was used to compare body <b>checking</b> <b>and</b> avoidance in women with and without a clinical eating disorder (n = 110). RESULTS: The majority (92 %) of the patients in Study 1 checked their bodies to assess their shape or weight and this was associated significantly with eating disorder symptoms. In Study 2, the clinical group had significantly more body <b>checking</b> <b>and</b> avoidance than the comparison group, and there was a strong association between eating disorder psychopathology <b>and</b> body <b>checking</b> <b>and</b> avoidance. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the view that body <b>checking</b> <b>and</b> avoidance are direct expressions of the overevaluation of shape and weight. Further work is needed to determine whether these expressions contribute to the maintenance of eating disorders...|$|R
40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{the relationship}} between <b>checks</b> <b>and</b> balances and democracy, focusing on Turkey in comparative perspective. In a large-N setting, the effects of <b>checks</b> <b>and</b> balances {{on the quality of}} democracy are examined. The findings reinforce the essential relationship between democracy <b>and</b> <b>checks</b> <b>and</b> balances. The article then discusses the implications of the the findings for Turkey. It stresses the need for horizontal accountability via <b>checks</b> <b>and</b> balances vested in different state agencies. In addition to state-level <b>checks</b> <b>and</b> balances, the importance of societal actors as sources of accountability is also elaborated. The study identifies the need for vertical accountability, not only through free elections but also by creating a political setting in which pluralistic media and civil society can thrive. In light of findings, the article stresses the need for a new constitutional framework that can embrace both state- <b>and</b> societal-level <b>checks</b> <b>and</b> balances. © 2015 Taylor & Francis...|$|R

40|$|Voters often {{dismantle}} constitutional <b>checks</b> <b>and</b> balances on the executive. If such <b>checks</b> <b>and</b> balances limit presidential {{abuses of}} power and rents, why do voters support their removal? We argue that by reducing politician rents, <b>checks</b> <b>and</b> balances also make it cheaper to bribe or in‡uence politicians through non-electoral means. In weakly-institutionalized polities where such non-electoral in‡uences, particularly by the better organized elite, are a major concern, voters may prefer a political system without <b>checks</b> <b>and</b> balances {{as a way of}} insulating politicians from these in‡uences. When they do so, they are e¤ectively accepting a certain amount of politician (presidential) rents in return for redistribution. We show that <b>checks</b> <b>and</b> balances are less likely to emerge when (equilibrium) politician rents are low; when the elite are better organized {{and are more likely to}} be able to in‡uence or bribe politicians; and when inequality and potential taxes are high (which makes redistribution more valuable to the majority). We show that the main intuition, that <b>checks</b> <b>and</b> balances, by making politicians “cheaper to bribe, ” are potentially costly to the majority, is valid under di¤erent ways of modeling the form of <b>checks</b> <b>and</b> balances...|$|R

It is most likely that the timber with small MFA exhibited high MOE, large tangential shrinkage, and small longitudinal shrinkage [6, 7], and that this caused more surface <b>checks</b> <b>and</b> less bow.|$|R

Weld voiced his intent to place a Resident in Johor, which prompted Abu Bakar to make a trip to England in August 1884 to negotiate new terms with the British Colonial Office. The Assistant Under-Secretary of the Colonial Office, Robert Meade, conceded to Abu Bakar's request for an absence of a British Resident in Johor, although Abu Bakar gave an in-principle acceptance for a British adviser in Johor (though none was appointed until 1914). An agreement was drawn up, and Abu Bakar was promised control over internal affairs in exchange for British control over foreign affairs pertaining to the state.|$|E

5|$|When a king {{is under}} {{immediate}} attack {{by one or}} two of the opponent's pieces, it is said to be in check. A response to a check is a legal move if it results in a position where the king is no longer under direct attack (that is, not in check). This can involve capturing the checking piece; interposing a piece between the checking piece and the king (which is possible only if the attacking piece is a queen, rook, or bishop and there is a square between it and the king); or moving the king to a square where it is not under attack. Castling is not a permissible response to a check. The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent; this occurs when the opponent's king is in <b>check,</b> <b>and</b> there is no legal way to remove it from attack. It is illegal for a player to make a move that would put or leave the player's own king in check.|$|E
5|$|After the British Grand Prix on 15 July, eight teams {{conducted}} mid-season {{testing at}} the Autodromo Nazionale Monza between 17–20 July {{to prepare for}} the upcoming German Grand Prix at the Hockenheimring. Ricardo Zonta set the fastest times on the first day, ahead of McLaren test driver Alexander Wurz. Michael Schumacher lost control of the rear-end of his car at the Seconda Variante chicane, causing him to slide along the barriers and his car rested in the tyre barriers. Testing was suspended for one hour for the barriers to be repaired. Ferrari later found the crash occurred by a broken diffuser from riding on the kerbs which created a loss of downforce under braking. Michael Schumacher took a medical <b>check</b> <b>and</b> was declared fit to race. Ralf Schumacher was fastest on the second day where it was held in wet weather conditions during the afternoon. Sauber and BAR went to Circuit Ricardo Tormo for three days where aerodyamic and set-up testing was undertaken. Coulthard was scheduled to join Wurz during the session but withdrew because of food poisoning. Irvine was quickest on the third and final days of testing. Arrows elected not to perform any testing and concentrated on work on aerodynamics at their headquarters at Leafield.|$|E
