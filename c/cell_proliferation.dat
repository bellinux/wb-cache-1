40|$|AIM: To {{study the}} effect of {{platelet}} derived growth factor ɑ receptor(PDGFR-ɑ) antibody on the rust-induced human retinal pigment epithelial cell(hRPE) proliferation. METHODS: In vitro rust hRPE <b>cells</b> <b>proliferation</b> differentiation model was established. Blank control group, rust group, PDGFR-ɑ antibody(1, 10, 50, and 100 μg/mL) treatment group were established. The effect of anti-PDGFR-ɑ antibody on the growth of RPE was determined by MTT colorimetric assay after 0, 12, 24, 48 h,and the inhibition rates were calculated accordingly. RESULTS: After adding the anti-PDGFR-ɑ antibody, hRPE <b>cells</b> <b>proliferation</b> activity was decreased at certain concentration as the antibody concentration increased, and 50 μg/mL anti-PDGFR-ɑ antibody was the optimum concentration to inhibit hRPE <b>cells</b> <b>proliferation,</b> the inhibitory rate of hRPE was 42. 44 %.

5|$|The {{relationship}} between cellular proliferation and mitochondria {{has been investigated}} using cervical cancer HeLa cells. Tumor cells require an ample amount of ATP (Adenosine triphosphate) in order to synthesize bioactive compounds such as lipids, proteins, and nucleotides for rapid <b>cell</b> <b>proliferation.</b> The majority of ATP in tumor cells is generated via the oxidative phosphorylation pathway (OxPhos). Interference with OxPhos have shown to cause cell cycle arrest suggesting that mitochondria {{play a role in}} <b>cell</b> <b>proliferation.</b> Mitochondrial ATP production is also vital for cell division in addition to other basic functions in the cell including the regulation of cell volume, solute concentration, and cellular architecture. ATP levels differ at various stages of the cell cycle suggesting that there is a {{relationship between}} the abundance of ATP and the cell's ability to enter a new cell cycle. ATP's role in the basic functions of the cell make the cell cycle sensitive to changes in the availability of mitochondrial derived ATP. The variation in ATP levels at different stages of the cell cycle support the hypothesis that mitochondria {{play an important role in}} cell cycle regulation. Although the specific mechanisms between mitochondria and the cell cycle regulation is not well understood, studies have shown that low energy cell cycle checkpoints monitor the energy capability before committing to another round of cell division.|$|E

40|$|Neural {{stem cells}} are self-renewing, {{multipotent}} and undifferentiated precursors that retain the capacity for differentiation into both glial (astrocytes and oligodendrocytes) and neuronal lineages. Neural stem cells offer cell-based therapies for neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease and spinal cord injuries. However, their cellular behavior is poorly understood. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small noncoding RNAs involved in <b>cell</b> development, <b>proliferation</b> and differentiation through regulating gene expression at post-transcriptional level. The role of miR– 381 {{in the development of}} neural stem cells remains unknown. In this study, we showed that overex-pression of miR– 381 promoted neural stem <b>cells</b> <b>proliferation.</b> It induced the neural stem cells differentiation to neurons and inhibited their differentiation to astrocytes. Furthermore, we identified HES 1 as a direct target of miR– 381 in neural stem cells. Moreover, re-expres-sion of HES 1 impaired miR- 381 -induced promotion of neural stem <b>cells</b> <b>proliferation</b> and induce neural stem cells differentiation to neurons.

40|$|Abstract We {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the expression of SPARC (secreted protein, acidic and rich in cysteine) in gastric cancer and its relationship with tumor angiogenesis and cancer <b>cells</b> <b>proliferation.</b> Protein expression of SPARC, VEGF, CD 34 and Ki- 67 in 80 cases of gastric cancer and 30 cases of normal gastric tissue was evaluated by immu-nohistochemistry. CD 34 staining {{was used as an}} indicator of microvessel density (MVD). Ki- 67 labeling Index (LI) indi-cated cancer <b>cells</b> <b>proliferation.</b> Statistical analysis was used to investigate its relationship with clinical characteristics, tumor angiogenesis and cancer <b>cells</b> <b>proliferation.</b> SPARC expression was mainly in the stromal cells surrounding the gastric cancer cells, and was statistically significant differ-ences between gastric cancer and normal gastric tissue (P< 0. 05). Both the expression of SPARC and VEGF were related to differentiation degree, clinical stage, Lauren clas-sification and lymph node metastasis (P< 0. 05). Expression of SPARC was significantly negatively correlated with the expression of VEGF and MVD in gastric cancer tissues. Expression of SPARC was also negatively correlated with Ki- 67 -LI. Our findings suggest that both the expression of SPARC and VEGF are closed to tumor angiogenesis in gastric cancer, SPARC inhibited tumor angiogenesis but VEGF promoted tumor angiogenesis.

The role of ROS in promoting tumor proliferation is further supported by the observation that agents with potential to inhibit ROS generation can also inhibit cancer <b>cell</b> <b>proliferation.</b> Although ROS can promote tumor <b>cell</b> <b>proliferation,</b> a great increase in ROS has been associated with reduced cancer <b>cell</b> <b>proliferation</b> by induction of G2/M cell cycle arrest; increased phosphorylation of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk 1), Chk 2; and reduced cell division cycle 25 homolog c (CDC25).|$|E

40|$|Clonality is a {{frequently}} exploited {{characteristic of}} lymphoid malignancies. However, {{in the natural}} killer (NK) cell subset of large granular lymphocyte proliferations, clonality is difficult to prove {{because of the lack}} of specific genetic markers, such as immunoglobulin or T-cell receptor gene rearrangements. The human androgen receptor (HUMARA) assay, a polymerase chain reaction-based X-chromosome inactivation assay, is a potential diagnostic tool in these disorders. Although there is much experience with X-chromosome inactivation assays in myeloid proliferations, these assays have found only very limited application in clonality assessment of NK <b>cell</b> <b>proliferations.</b> We applied the HUMARA assay in laboratory diagnostics for detection of clonality in NK <b>cell</b> <b>proliferations.</b> We describe its test performance and report three cases in which clonality of INK cell populations was investigated by use of this assay.
