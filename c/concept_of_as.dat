The proposed end-to-end QoS framework fall under three distinct planes: session control plane, network control plane, and data forwarding plane.

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{end-to-end}} Quality of Service (QoS) over Internet can be {{split into two}} parts: The first part is to develop framework for information exchange, signaling, path selection and setup spanning across multiple autonomous systems (ASes). The second part is to find an optimal inter-domain path based on specific QoS requirements and available resources. The traditional QoS mechanisms try to solve the later part under the constraints under existing Internet. We propose a generalized framework that addresses the first and also simplifies the second. This paper discusses modern scenarios that require end-to-end QoS over Internet. It describes the issues Involved with QoS mechanisms using existing BGP-based framework then, proposes evolutionary framework to address them. It introduces a new <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> <b>AS</b> Designated QoS Provider Entities (ADEs) to assist each AS in information exchange, decision making, and signaling. ADE architecture makes it independent of underlying network technologies to support mix of diverse QoS technologies or future changes In them. This framework enables network optimization, connection admission control and aggregation. From commercial perspective, it provides business model to achieve collaboration among different network providers to support end-to-end QoS for premium services...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—It is {{well known}} that the channel {{capacity}} of Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO) system increases as the number of antenna pairs between transmitter and receiver increases but it suffers from multiple expensive RF chains. To reduce the cost of RF chains, Antenna Selection (AS) method can offer a good tradeoff between expense and performance. In a transmitting AS system, Channel State Information (CSI) feedback is necessarily required to choose the best subset of antennas in which the effects of delays and errors occurred in feedback channels are the most dominant factors degrading the performance of the AS method. This paper presents the <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> <b>AS</b> method using CSI from channel reciprocity instead of feedback method. Reciprocity technique can easily archive CSI by utilizing a reverse channel where the forward and reverse channels are symmetrically considered in time, frequency and location. In this work, the capacity performance of MIMO system when using AS method at transmitter with reciprocity channels is investigated by own developing Testbed. The obtained results show that reciprocity technique offers capacity close to a system with a perfect CSI and gains a higher capacity than a system without AS method from 0. 9 to 2. 2 bps/Hz at SNR 10 dB...|$|E

Moreover if ˆ f is the dynamics of a compact manifold, which fibers over f and such that the bundle is normally hyperbolic over the non-wandering set of f |K, then the bundle over K is persistent. This provides non trivial examples of persistent laminations that are not normally hyperbolic. A classical result states that hyperbolic compact sets are C 1 -structurally stable. A compact subset K of a manifold M is hyperbolic for a diffeomorphism f of M if it is invariant (f(K) = K) and the tangent bundle of M restricted to K splits into two Tf-invariant subbundles contracted and expanded respectively. An invariant subset K of a diffeomorphism f is C 1 -structurally stable if every C 1 -perturbation f ′ of f lets invariant a compact set K ′ homeomorphic to K by an embedding C 0 -close to the inclusion K ֒ → M which conjugates the dynamics f |K and f ′ |K ′...|$|E
30|$|Renal cell {{carcinoma}} (RCC) {{is among the}} ten commonest tumours among {{both males and females}} in the western world [1]. The increased incidental detection rate of small asymptomatic renal tumours {{is a result of the}} higher number of cross-section scans that are performed for other reasons [2]. More than 80 % of those small renal masses (SRMs) have proved to be cT 1 a (maximum diameter smaller than 4  cm) renal {{cell carcinoma}}s (RCCs) [3]. The management of such small lesions generates significant controversy; the potential options are active surveillance and nephron-sparing treatments with either surgery or ablation [4, 5]. Indications for treatment may be absolute (i.e. patients with only one anatomical or functional kidney) or relative (i.e. patients with hereditary forms of renal cell carcinoma, functioning opposite kidney that is affected by a disorder that might impair renal function in the future) [6, 7]. Surgery has evolved from open radical to partial nephrectomy (PN) and the latter may be performed as open, conventional laparoscopic or robot-assisted laparoscopic. Nephron-sparing surgery in tertiary care centres may offer a 5 -year survival of up to 90 % with satisfactory preservation of renal function and reduction of the frequency of cardiovascular events in comparison to the radical excision [8 – 11]. Active surveillance (AS), on the other hand, has been historically reserved for those patients who may be unfit for surgery. The <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> <b>AS</b> is based on the fact that the growth rate of the majority of these tumours is relatively slow (2 - 3  mm/year) and the metastatic potential is also, in general, rather low. However, given that there are currently no biomarkers that may predict the natural history of such masses, close monitoring with cross-sectional imaging is required in order to detect those tumours that will grow rapidly [12 – 14]. Furthermore, the Swedish Kidney Cancer Quality Register has highlighted that there is a more significant metastatic potential than what is generally believed, even for tumours that are between 1 and 4  cm [15].|$|E
