While the chemotherapy of cancer, {{in conjunction with}} other treatment modalities, has reached a significant level of maturity, efficacious use of such agents is still restricted by numerous pharmacological deficiencies, such as poor solubility, short serum circulation lifetimes, and low bioavailability resulting from lack of affinity to cancer tissue and inadequate mechanisms of cell entry.

40|$|The multidrug {{resistance}} protein 1 (MRP 1) gene encodes a transporter protein {{that helps to}} protect cells against xenobiotics.

To explore the protective function of the mouse mrp 1 protein during drug treatment, we investigated the toxicity caused by the anticancer drug etoposide-phosphate (ETOPOPHOS) in mice lacking the mrp 1 gene (mrp 1 �/ � mice). We show here that the lack of mrp 1 protein results in increased etoposide-induced damage to the mucosa of the oropharyngeal cavity and to the seminiferous tubules of the testis. The high concentrations of mrp 1 that we find in the basal layers of the oropharyngeal mucosa and in the basal membrane of the Sertoli cells in the testis apparently protect wild-type mice against this tissue damage.
