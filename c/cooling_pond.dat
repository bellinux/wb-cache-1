5|$|The design used a {{thin layer}} of {{aluminum}} to protect the uranium from corrosion by the cooling water. Cylindrical uranium slugs with aluminum jackets would be pushed through channels through the reactor and drop out the other side into a <b>cooling</b> <b>pond.</b> Once the radioactivity subsided, the slugs would be taken away and the plutonium extracted. After reviewing the two designs, the DuPont engineers chose the water-cooled one. In 1959 a patent for the reactor design would be issued in the name of Creutz, Ohlinger, Weinberg, Wigner, and Young.|$|E
25|$|The south part of {{the site}} {{consists}} of a modular administration building, four reactor buildings, turbine hall, maintenance workshops, stores, fuel element <b>cooling</b> <b>pond</b> building, tritium processing plant (CXPP) and new flask handling facility (FHB). The {{part of the}} site referred to as north site consists of legacy buildings including aircraft hangars, a graphite handling laboratory and a large building that originally housed some 10,000 drums of yellow Magnox Depleted Uranium (MDU) trioxide arising from reprocessing at Sellafield.|$|E
25|$|At 16:12 JST, Self Defence Force (SDF) Chinook {{helicopters}} {{were preparing}} to pour water on Unit 3, where white fumes rising from the building {{was believed to be}} water boiling away from the fuel rod <b>cooling</b> <b>pond</b> {{on the top floor of}} the reactor building, and on Unit 4 where the cooling pool was also short of water. The mission was cancelled when helicopter measurements reported radiation levels of 50 mSv. At 21:06 pm JST, the government reported that major damage to Reactor 3 was unlikely but that it nonetheless remained their highest priority.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cooling</b> <b>ponds</b> {{are used}} where {{sufficient}} land is available, {{as an alternative}} to cooling towers or discharging of heated water to a nearby river or coastal bay, a process known as “once-through cooling.” The latter process can cause thermal pollution of the receiving waters. <b>Cooling</b> <b>ponds</b> are also sometimes used with air conditioning systems in large buildings {{as an alternative to}} cooling towers. Cooling towers are not a good choice because their internal surfaces have been coated with a non-approved paint such as bitumen or epoxy, as a result <b>cooling</b> <b>ponds</b> are a better option.|$|R

25|$|The {{refueling}} {{machine is}} mounted on a gantry crane and remotely controlled. The fuel assemblies can be replaced without shutting down the reactor, a factor significant for production of weapon-grade plutonium and, in a civilian context, for better reactor uptime. When a fuel assembly has to be replaced, the machine is positioned above the fuel channel, mates to it, equalizes pressure within, pulls the rod, and inserts a fresh one. The spent rod is then placed in a <b>cooling</b> <b>pond.</b> The capacity of the refueling machine with the reactor at nominal power level is two fuel assemblies per day, with peak capacity of five per day.|$|E
500|$|Standing in {{the grounds}} behind the complex, the <b>cooling</b> <b>pond</b> {{measures}} [...] {{and has a}} leat around three sides; it opens out on the southwest side. [...] It is surrounded by small walls of red brick and terracotta. [...] Pipework connects the leat to the boiler house, from which hot water flows; heat exchange {{takes place in the}} cooling pond; and cold water is returned {{to be used in the}} boilers.|$|E
500|$|The next {{extension}} {{took place}} in 1884. [...] A <b>cooling</b> <b>pond</b> and a leat (an artificial waterway) were built on land behind the pumping station, and a new [...] underground reservoir was built by J.T. Chappell. [...] It ran for [...] westwards from the complex. [...] Brighton Water Corporation spent £11,000 on this work and on the building of two other reservoirs in Brighton, at Dyke Road and Race Hill. [...] All three were built of tile, brick and Portland cement. [...] They were constantly replenished by a -per-minute inflow from numerous natural fissures in the chalk.|$|E

500|$|Cartridges {{of uranium}} were {{irradiated}} in the Windscale reactors to produce plutonium. The cartridges were {{pushed through the}} reactor, and exited on the other side, where they fell into submerged steel skips which were pulled into a deep <b>cooling</b> <b>pond.</b> After being irradiated, each cartridge contained as many as 180 isotopes of 35 different chemical elements. Less than half {{of one percent of}} the feed would have been converted to plutonium, but about 5 percent was now radioactive fission products, the remainder being slightly depleted uranium. After being stored underwater for 150 days, the short-lived isotopes had decayed, leaving significant quantities of about 20 radioactive isotopes. Using remote handling, the cartridges were placed in lead-lined [...] "coffins" [...] and transported to the chemical separation plant.|$|E
500|$|The High Victorian Gothic {{buildings}} are a landmark in Hove, {{and are a}} good example of the 19th-century ethos that [...] "utility definitely does not equal dullness" [...] in industrial buildings. [...] Polychrome brickwork, moulded dressings and facings, decorative gables and elaborate windows characterise all the structures – even the [...] chimney, which stands apart from the main buildings like a campanile. [...] English Heritage has listed the complex for its architectural and historical importance, giving its structures five separate listings: the former boiler house and the chimney are both listed at Grade II* – the second-highest designation – and the former coal shed, the <b>cooling</b> <b>pond</b> and leat and the tall flint and brick wall surrounding the site each have the lower Grade II status.|$|E
500|$|At its {{greatest}} extent, between 1884 and 1952, the complex {{consisted of two}} boiler houses with condensing engines, a chimney, coal cellars, workshop, <b>cooling</b> <b>pond,</b> leat and underground reservoir. [...] Situated {{on top of a}} naturally fissured chalk hollow, it provided vast quantities of water to the rapidly growing towns of Hove and its larger neighbour, the fashionable seaside resort of Brighton, for more than a century. [...] As new sources of water were found elsewhere and more modern equipment installed to exploit them, the pumping station's importance declined, and by 1971 the Brighton Water Department had closed it and threatened the complex with demolition. [...] An industrial archaeologist offered to restore the buildings and machinery in return for a lease from the Brighton Water Corporation, and a charitable trust was formed to enable this. [...] Expertise developed by the Engineerium's employees and volunteers was exploited across the world: they founded museums, undertook restoration projects and trained young people in engineering heritage conservation. Another enthusiast subsequently bought the complex, and as of [...] it is closed to the public while more restoration and extension work takes place.|$|E

40|$|One of the {{frequently}} encountered {{problems of}} power plant small <b>cooling</b> <b>ponds</b> is rapid eutrophication and related intensified development of phytoplankton (“hyperflow”) and overgrowing of ponds by higher aquatic vegetation. As {{a result of}} hyper-flowering, {{an enormous amount of}} detritus settles on the condenser tubes, reducing the efficiency of the power plant operation. The development of higher aquatic vegetation contributes to the appearing of the shoals. As a result the volume, area and other characteristics of the <b>cooling</b> <b>ponds</b> are getting changed. The article describes the environmental problems of small manmade ponds of power plants and coal mines in mining regions. Two approaches to the problem of eutrophication are considered: technological and ecological. The negative effects of herbicides application to aquatic organisms are experimentally proved. An ecological approach to solving the problem by fish-land reclamation method is shown...|$|R
500|$|When Jonathan Minns, {{who later}} bought the complex, found in 1971 {{that it was}} {{threatened}} with demolition, he successfully sought to get it listed by the Historic Buildings Council for England (the predecessor of English Heritage). [...] The organisation granted listed status in five separate parts on 7 June 1971, covering the pumping station's five main structures. [...] The boiler rooms and engine house were jointly listed at Grade II*, as was its free-standing chimney. [...] Three more structures were listed at Grade II: the <b>cooling</b> <b>pond</b> and leat, the coal storage shed and the flint and brick walls surrounding the complex. [...] Grade II* is the second highest of the three designations awarded to listed buildings; such buildings are defined as being [...] "particularly important ... of more than special interest". [...] As of February 2001, the boiler house and chimney represented two of the 70 Grade II*-listed buildings and structures, and 1,218 listed buildings of all grades, {{in the city of}} Brighton and Hove. [...] Grade II is the lowest status, given to [...] "nationally important buildings of special interest". [...] In February 2001, there were 1,124 such buildings in the city.|$|E

40|$|A data {{acquisition}} research program, entitled "Ultimate Heat Sink Performance Field Experiments," {{has been brought}} to completion. The primary objective is to obtain the requisite data to characterize thermal performance and water utilization for <b>cooling</b> <b>ponds</b> and spray ponds at elevated temperature. Such data are useful for modeling purposes, but the work reported here does not contain modeling efforts within its scope. The water bodies which have been studied are indicative of nuclear reactor ultimate heat sinks, components of emergency core cooling systems. The data reflect thermal performance and water utilization for meteorological and solar influences which are representative of worst-case combinations of conditions. Constructed water retention ponds, provided with absolute seals against seepage, have been chosen as facilities for the measurement programs; the first pond was located at Raft River, Idaho, and the second at East Mesa, California. The data illustrate and describe, for both <b>cooling</b> <b>ponds</b> and spray ponds, thermal performance and water utilization as the <b>ponds</b> <b>cool</b> from an initially elevated temperature. To obtain the initial elevated temperature, it has been convenient to conduct the measurements at geothermal sites having large supplies and delivery rates of hot geothermal fluid.
