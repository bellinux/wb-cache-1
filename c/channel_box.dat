40|$|Nuclear fuel {{assemblies}} {{are made}} of Zirconium alloys such as Zircaloy- 2 and Zircoloy- 4 for fuel cladding and fuel <b>channel</b> <b>box</b> structural members. These components are continuously hydrogen charged through interactions with radiation and corrosion processes. To better understand the ageing effect and the remaining service life of these components, it is more cost effective to rely on non-destructive testing techniques to determine the hydrogen content rather than removing samples and performing costly destructive sectioning analyses. The frequency scanning eddy current technique (F-SECT) used since 2001 for quantitative evaluation of high-temperature gas turbine coatings is applied to assess hydrogen content in Zirconium alloys. This paper will present results of this proven eddy current technology to assess hydrogen in non-irradiated fuel cladding and irradiated fuel <b>channel</b> <b>box</b> structures. The {{first part of the}} paper will focus on the technique and the associated eddy current results that were obtained from the hydrogen-charged fuel cladding samples. This will be followed by testing and evaluation of irradiated <b>channel</b> <b>box</b> samples from a hot cell facility...|$|E
40|$|The core of {{a boiling}} water reactor (BWR) {{consists}} of an array of fuel assemblies with cross-shaped control blades located between these assemblies. Each fuel assembly consists of a fuel rod bundle surrounded by a Zircaloy <b>channel</b> <b>box.</b> Each control blade consists of small stainless steel absorber tubes filled with B 4 C powder surrounded by a stainless steel blade sheath. Under severe accident conditions, material interactions between the B 4 C, stainless steel, and Zircaloy {{would have a significant}} impact on the melting and subsequent relocation of the control blade and <b>channel</b> <b>box</b> structures. This paper describes a new BWR control blade/channel box model for the SCDAP/RELAP 5 severe accident analysis code that includes the effects of these material interactions. The phenomena represented by this model and the modeling techniques are derived from ORNL analyses of the BWR severe fuel damage experiments. Two examples of the operation of this new model within SCDAP/RELAP 5 are provided...|$|E

40|$|Even though {{improvements}} in modeling the phenomena {{that occur in}} the lower plenum have been made, the MELCOR user must decide on the physical events that are to be modeled and create the corresponding input. In addition to the standard modeling techniques, the flexibility of MELCOR allows for nontraditional modeling as well. For typical BWR applications, the user establishes concentric radial rings for the COR Package. In theory, each ring should be composed of a channel (within the <b>channel</b> <b>box</b> walls) and a bypass (the volume region outside the <b>channel</b> <b>box</b> walls) with each region containing both fluid and structures. However, in MELCOR 1. 8. 3 and earlier versions, the COR Package allows particulate debris to relocate only inside the <b>channel</b> <b>box</b> walls, using a volume equivalent to the channel and bypass fluid volumes. The consequences of this modeling approach with respect to the combined channel and bypass volumes produces two anomalies in the BWR calculation, particularly for boildown sequences. The first is that the CVH Package will calculate inaccurate channel and bypass water levels for the core region, which can significantly affect predicted metal-water reaction rates. The other is that lack of separation of the channel and bypass volumes will cause an artificially large flow area through the core plate, which can lead to inaccurately determined core plate failure times and unrealistic pressure transients in the lower plenum. In an effort to mitigate the consequences of the current COR package treatment of BWR channel and bypass volumes, an atypical way of modeling the core region by doubling the number of rings so that each ring represents only a channel or bypass region has been developed and {{has been shown to be}} beneficial...|$|E

40|$|The report {{describes}} {{the final results}} of the Phase IIIB Benchmark conducted by the Expert Group on Burnup Credit Criticality Safety {{under the auspices of}} the Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The Benchmark was intended to compare the predictability of current computer code and data library combinations for the atomic number densities of an irradiated BWR fuel assembly model. The fuel assembly was irradiated under specific power of 25. 6 MW/tHM up to 40 GWd/tHM and cooled for five years. The void fraction was assumed to be uniform throughout the <b>channel</b> <b>box</b> and constant, at 0, 40 and 70 %, during burnup. In total, 16 results were submitted from 13 institutes of 7 countries. The calculated atomic number densities of 12 actinides and 20 fission product nuclides were found to be for the most part within a range of ± 10 % relative to the average, although some results, esp. 155 Eu and gadolinium isotopes, exceeded the band, which will require further investigation.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to study and understand {{the behavior of the}} reactivity coefficients (RCs) in a boiling water reactor (BWR) partially within 25 different segments with different void fractions, with enriched oxide fuel (UOX) core, as well as to evaluate the methodologies exposed in [10]. These two normalization  methods (described in chapter 3) are used to analyse the contribution of each segment of the core having different regions (fuel, clad, coolant, moderator and <b>channel</b> <b>box)</b> to the RCs. All the calculations in this work are performed using PSG 2 / Serpent – a Continuous-energy Monte Carlo Reactor Physics Burnup Calculation Code. The overall reactivity coefficient's values are exactly the same for both methodologies, but the partial reactivity coefficients are totally differing from each other. Using the symmetric normalization methodology introduced in chapter 3 section 3. 4. 3 the partial reactivity coefficients become almost the same for both methodologies. Moreover, the overall reactivity coefficients are exactly the same as well. Methodologies for reducing the radiotoxicity of the actinides and fission products produced in nuclear fuels are presently under investigation. Therefore, currently the nuclear reactors are designed not only for power generation, but also are used as transmuters as well, by inserting, for example, the minor actinide to a reactor core the safety parameters can get worse. Moreover, it is wiser to study the partial reactivity coefficients of a reactor core...|$|E

40|$|An {{electron}} beam test facility, {{which consists of}} a precision multidimensional manipulator built into an ultra-high-vacuum bell jar, was designed, fabricated, and operated at Lewis Research Center. The position within the bell jar of a Faraday cup which samples current in the {{electron beam}} under test, {{is controlled by the}} manipulator. Three orthogonal axes of motion are controlled by stepping motors driven by digital indexers, and the positions are displayed on electronic totalizers. In the transverse directions, the limits of travel are approximately + or - 2. 5 cm from the center with a precision of 2. 54 micron (0. 0001 in.); in the axial direction, approximately 15. 0 cm of travel are permitted with an accuracy of 12. 7 micron (0. 0005 in.). In addition, two manually operated motions are provided, the pitch and yaw of the Faraday cup with respect to the electron beam can be adjusted to within a few degrees. The current is sensed by pulse transformers and the data are processed by a dual <b>channel</b> <b>box</b> car averager with a digital output. The beam tester can be operated manually or it can be programmed for automated operation.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a full-scale experimental {{investigation into the}} effects of box gutter geometry on the open channel flow conditions above siphonic roofwater outlets. In particular, the effects of channel width (300, 400, 480 and 600 mm) and length (14. 86 and 32. 00 m) were investigated through measurements of flow rate, water depth and longitudinal velocity in the box gutter. The experimental results showed that for the same outlet flow rate, the depth {{of water in the}} gutter varied by up to 211 % for the two different gutter lengths tested. Generally, the greatest water depths for the different flow rates were recorded in the 400 -mm wide gutter and the lowest water depths were recorded in the 300 -mm wide gutter. It was also found that the maximum flow rate through the single 110 -mm diameter outlet varied depending on the width of the gutter. Practical application: The depth of water in the open <b>channel</b> <b>box</b> gutters above the outlets of siphonic drainage systems is an important design variable and it is imperative to be able to accurately estimate these water depths during all phases of operation to reduce flood damage risk. This research study has found that for the same flow rate, varying the length of gutter on either side of a siphonic outlet strongly influences the depth of water along the gutter and above the outlet. The results suggest that there may be an optimum gutter width and length for which different siphonic outlets may perform more efficiently...|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} of the Boiling Water Reactor Experimental Analysis and Model Development for Severe Accidents (BEAMD) Program at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) are: (1) {{the development of a}} sound quantitative understanding of boiling water reactor (BWR) core melt progression; this includes control blade and <b>channel</b> <b>box</b> effects, metallic melt relocation and possible blockage formation under severe accident conditions, and (2) provision of BWR melt progression modeling capabilities in SCDAP/RELAP 5 (consistent with the BWR experimental data base). This requires the assessment of current modeling of BWR core melt progression against the expanding BWR data base. Emphasis is placed upon data from the BWR tests in the German CORA test facility and from the ex-reactor experiments [Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) ] on metallic melt relocation and blockage formation in BWRs, as well as upon in-reactor data from the Annular Core Research Reactor (ACRR) DF- 4 BWR test (conducted in 1986 at SNL). The BEAMD Program is a derivative of the BWR Severe Accident Technology Programs at ORNL. The ORNL BWR programs have studied postulated severe accidents in BWRs and have developed a set of models specific to boiling water reactor response under severe accident conditions. These models, in an experiment-specific format, have been successfully applied to both pretest and posttest analyses of the DF- 4 experiment, and the BWR severe fuel damage (SFD) experiments performed in the CORA facility at the Kernforschungszentrum Karlsruhe (KfK) in Germany, resulting in excellent agreement between model prediction and experiment. The ORNL BWR models have provided for more precise predictions of the conditions in the BWR experiments than were previously available. This has provided a basis for more accurate interpretation of the phenomena for which the experiments are performed. The experiment-specific models, as used in the ORNL DF- 4 and CORA BWR experimental analyses, also provide a basis for the efficient development of new models for phenomena such as materials interaction; and these validated phenomenological models (from the results of the experiments) then may be incorporated in the systems-level codes (MELCOR and SCDAP/RELAP 5) ...|$|E
