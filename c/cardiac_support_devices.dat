40|$|Heart {{transplantation}} {{in patients}} after implantation of mechanical <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> <b>devices</b> entails an extremely {{high risk for}} perioperative bleeding. Recombinant activated coagulation factor VII is presently used to reduce the volume of bleeding in this patient group. There are parallel data on its administration-induced thromboembolic events in the literature. This paper describes a case of using a prothrombin complex concentrate in a patient during explantation of a left ventricular bypass system and subsequent orthotopic heart transplantation {{in the presence of}} significant hypocoagulation. At the end of a surgery, 1200 IU of the agent was used at a remaining bleeding rate of more than 1000 ml/hour. Within the first 24 hours after surgery, the rate of discharge drainage was less than 100 ml/hour. A control plain chest X-ray study revealed massive left-sided hydrothorax on day 2 postsurgery. The left pleural cavity was revised under thoracoscopic guidance and 1000 ml of blood clots were evacuated. Although the administration of prothrombin complex concentrate did not guard against re-intervention, its use seems a promising strategy in life-threatening bleedings in patients after explantation of mechanical <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> <b>devices.</b> Further multicenter investigations are required to determine the efficacy and safety of prothrom-bin complex concentration in cardiac surgery.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveThis study {{investigated}} the effects on global cardiac function and myocardial energetics of limiting progressive dilatation after infarction {{by means of a}} woven polyester jacket <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> <b>device.</b> We hypothesized that placement of the <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> <b>device</b> results in a decrease in myocardial wall stress and improvement in cardiac function and myocardial energetics. MethodsTo investigate the effect of passive constraint on left ventricular function and mechanics, a total of 10 sheep were studied with pressure-volume analysis and magnetic resonance imaging. A baseline study was followed by the creation of an anterior infarct. After 1 week, the animals underwent a second study. The <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> <b>device</b> was then placed over the epicardium in 5 sheep; the remaining animals served as controls. A terminal study was performed at 2 months after the infarct. ResultsThe <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> <b>device</b> group at the terminal study exhibited a decrease in end-diastolic volume (control 110. 3 ± 19. 8 mL vs <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> <b>device</b> 67. 6 ± 4. 7 mL, P =. 006) and an improved ejection fraction (control 15. 5 % ± 5. 7 % vs <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> <b>device</b> 29. 46 % ± 4. 42 %, P =. 008) relative to the control group. Myocardial energetics were also enhanced in the <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> <b>device</b> group, as evidenced by the significant improvements in potential energy (control 2015 ± 503 mL · mm Hg/beat vs <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> <b>device</b> 885 ± 220 mL · mm Hg/beat, P =. 006), efficiency (control 39. 4 % ± 13. 6 % vs <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> <b>device</b> 59. 8 % ± 8. 5 %, P =. 044), and oxygen consumption (control 0. 072 ± 0. 013 mL O 2 /beat vs <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> <b>device</b> 0. 052 ± 0. 007 mL O 2 /beat, P =. 034). ConclusionPassive constraint with the <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> <b>device</b> after infarct prevents further remodeling and may stimulate reverse remodeling in heart failure secondary to acute myocardial infarction. These results suggest that in human beings placement of the <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> <b>device</b> after a large anterior myocardial infarction may be effective in halting the remodeling process that often leads to end-stage heart failure. If proved effective, placement of a <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> <b>device</b> after large heart attacks has the potential to decrease the incidence of heart failure that results after large myocardial infarctions...|$|R
40|$|Heart {{failure is}} a growing health problem, {{affecting}} {{an increasing number of}} patients with rapidly increasing costs for the health care system. In spite of recent improvements in pharmacological, non-pharmacological and surgical treatments the prognosis for patients with severe heart failure is still poor. Heart failure is associated with numerous processes and changes in left ventricular structure and function often referred to as left ventricular remodelling. The Acorn Cor Cap <b>Cardiac</b> <b>Support</b> <b>Device</b> is a mesh-like polyester device designed to arrest and reverse these processes thereby facilitating left ventricular reversed remodelling in heart failure. We have explored the effect of passive containment surgery using the Acorn Cor Cap <b>Cardiac</b> <b>Support</b> <b>Device</b> in heart failure patients with ischemic or idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Following application of the Acorn Cor Cap <b>Cardiac</b> <b>Support</b> <b>Device</b> reduced <b>cardiac</b> dimensions, increased functional capacity, decreased levels of circulating plasma levels of Endothelin- I and improved quality of life was demonstrated. Furthermore, the possible beneficial effect on reduction on left ventricular dilatation with application of the Acorn Cor Cap <b>Cardiac</b> <b>Support</b> <b>Device</b> concomitant with aortic valve replacement in patients with longstanding aortic regurgitation and left ventricular dilatation was evaluated. No additive beneficial effects of application of the Acorn Cor Cap <b>Cardiac</b> <b>Support</b> <b>Device</b> were found in these patients when compared to patients with chronic aortic regurgitation and left ventricular dilatation undergoing aortic valve replacement as the sole procedure. The acute effects of application of the Acorn Cor Cap <b>Cardiac</b> <b>Support</b> <b>Device</b> in experimental porcine myocardial infarction were investigated. No acute effect on hemodynamics, coronary vasomotor function, Endothelin- I levels or infarction size was demonstrated following application of the Acorn Cor Cap <b>Cardiac</b> <b>Support</b> <b>Device</b> at induction of acute experimental myocardial infarction. Based on the findings in these studies it is concluded that application of the Acorn Cor Cap <b>Cardiac</b> <b>Support</b> <b>Device</b> is safe, simple and without apparent negative effects. In heart failure patients with ventricular dilatation the Acorn Cor Cap <b>Cardiac</b> <b>Support</b> <b>Device</b> represents a novel and interesting amendment to current surgical treatment options with likely beneficial effects...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundThe <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> <b>device</b> <b>supports</b> {{the heart}} and {{mechanically}} reduces left ventricular (LV) diastolic wall stress. Although {{it has been shown}} to halt LV remodeling in dilated cardiomyopathy, its therapeutic efficacy is limited by its lack of biological effects. In contrast, the slow-release synthetic prostacyclin agonist ONO- 1301 enhances reversal of LV remodeling through biological mechanisms such as angiogenesis and attenuation of fibrosis. We therefore hypothesized that ONO- 1301 plus a <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> <b>device</b> might be beneficial for the treatment of ischemic cardiomyopathy. MethodsTwenty-four dogs with induced anterior wall infarction were assigned randomly to 1 of 4 groups at 1  week postinfarction as follows: <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> <b>device</b> alone, <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> <b>device</b> plus ONO- 1301 (hybrid therapy), ONO- 1301 alone, or sham control. ResultsAt 8 weeks post-infarction, LV wall stress was reduced significantly in the hybrid therapy group compared with the other groups. Myocardial blood flow, measured by positron emission tomography, and vascular density were significantly higher in the hybrid therapy group compared with the <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> <b>device</b> alone and sham groups. The hybrid therapy group also showed the least interstitial fibrosis, the greatest recovery of LV systolic and diastolic functions, assessed by multidetector computed tomography and cardiac catheterization, and the lowest plasma N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels (P < . 05). ConclusionsThe combination of a <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> <b>device</b> and the prostacyclin agonist ONO- 1301 elicited a greater reversal of LV remodeling than either treatment alone, suggesting the potential of this hybrid therapy for the clinical treatment of ischemia-induced heart failure...|$|R

30|$|Extracorporeal {{membrane}} oxygenation (ECMO) is {{a highly}} specialised form of advanced life support that can be utilised in critically ill patients who require short-term respiratory and/or cardiac support [1 – 3]. Whilst there are numerous access and cannulation options available for ECMO, they can be classified into two groups: central access and peripheral access [4, 5]. Transthoracic and transoesophageal echocardiography play {{a fundamental role in}} the management of patients supported with mechanical support devices, including ECMO [6 – 10]. Malpositioning of access and return cannulae or inflow/outflow cannulae of any form of mechanical support can have significant adverse consequences. It may cause ineffective delivery of haemodynamic support, haemolysis, increase the risk of ‘suckdown’, acute pulmonary oedema or cardiac trauma. Imaging guidance is important during cannulae insertion and optimal positioning of mechanical <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> <b>devices</b> [11, 12] and especially for peripheral cannulae for VV ECMO. Correct access and return cannulae placement in this form of support is required to prevent recirculation and optimise oxygenation.|$|E
40|$|Out-of-hospital {{cardiac arrest}} (OHCA) {{is a common}} lethal health problem. Despite {{significant}} advances in the {{diagnosis and treatment of}} cardiovascular disease, OHCA continues to be a major challenge with unacceptably high mortality and morbidity. Although most research into OHCA has focused on improving rates of return of circulation, many patients die in the post resuscitative period from a unique set of physiological insults, collectively termed the post cardiac arrest syndrome. Over the last decade several clinical trials have highlighted the importance of post-resuscitative care in optimizing survival and neurological recovery. Recently, there have been significant advances in management including recommendations related to regional systems of care, application of therapeutic hypothermia and the utilization of investigative procedures including emergent coronary angiography, <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> <b>devices</b> and other tools which provide prognostic information.

40|$|ObjectiveCellular and {{mechanical}} treatment to prevent heart failure each holds therapeutic promise but together {{have not been}} reported yet. The goal {{of the present study}} was to determine whether combining a <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> <b>device</b> with cell-based therapy could prevent adverse left ventricular remodeling, more than either therapy alone. MethodsThe present study was completed in 2 parts. In the first part, mesenchymal stem cells were isolated from rodent femurs and seeded on a collagen-based scaffold. In the second part, myocardial infarction was induced in 60 rats. The 24 survivors were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 groups: control, stem cell therapy, <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> <b>device,</b> and a combination of stem cell therapy and <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> <b>device.</b> Left ventricular function was measured with biweekly echocardiography, followed by end-of-life histopathologic analysis at 6 weeks. ResultsAfter myocardial infarction and treatment intervention, the ejection fraction remained preserved (74. 9 - 80. 2 %) in the combination group at an early point (2 weeks) compared with the control group (66. 2 - 82. 8 %). By 6 weeks, the combination therapy group had a significantly greater fractional area of change compared with the control group (69. 2 % ± 6. 7 % and 49. 5 % ± 6. 1 % respectively, P = . 03). Also, at 6 weeks, the left ventricular wall thickness was greater in the combination group than in the stem cell therapy alone group (1. 79  ± 0. 11 and 1. 33  ± 0. 13, respectively, P = . 02). ConclusionsCombining a <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> <b>device</b> with stem cell therapy preserves left ventricular function after myocardial infarction, more than either therapy alone.

This observational study evaluates clinical and echocardiographic outcomes of an individualized medico–surgical approach, focusing on mitral regurgitation recurrence and left ventricular reverse remodeling. MethodsSixty-nine consecutive patients with heart failure (New York Heart Association class III/IV) with functional mitral regurgitation (grade 3 +/ 4 +) and left ventricular remodeling (end-diastolic volume 227 ± 73 mL, ejection fraction 26 % ± 8 %) underwent restrictive mitral annuloplasty (median ring size 26), with (n =  41) or without (n =  28) a <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> <b>device</b> and optimal postoperative medical treatment.

40|$|ObjectiveThe study {{objective}} was to evaluate in a prospective, randomized, multicenter trial the safety and efficacy of mitral valve surgery with and without the CorCap cardiac support device (Acorn Cardiovascular, St Paul, Minn) in patients with New York Heart Association Class II to IV heart failure. BackgroundAlthough mitral valve surgery has been performed successfully in patients with heart failure, the safety and long-term efficacy have not been established in a multicenter prospective trial. <b>Cardiac</b> <b>support</b> <b>devices</b> that reduce ventricular wall stress and promote beneficial reverse remodeling have been proposed as a new treatment option as a stand-alone procedure and {{as an adjunct to}} mitral valve surgery. MethodsA subgroup of 193 patients were enrolled in the mitral valve repair or replacement stratum of the Acorn Clinical Trial; 102 patients were randomized to the mitral valve surgery alone group (control) and 91 patients were randomized to mitral valve surgery with implantation of the CorCap cardiac support device. Patients were followed for a median duration of 22. 9 months. ResultsFor the entire mitral valve surgery group, the 30 -day operative mortality rate was only 1. 6 % at 30 days. Mitral surgery was associated with progressive reductions in left ventricle end-diastolic volume, left ventricle end-systolic volume, and left ventricular mass, and increases in left ventricle ejection fraction and sphericity index, all consistent with reverse remodeling. Recurrence of clinically significant mitral regurgitation was uncommon. Quality of life, exercise performance, and New York Heart Association functional class were all improved. Finally, the addition of the CorCap cardiac support device led to greater decreases in left ventricular end-diastolic volume and left ventricular end-systolic volume, a more elliptical shape, and a trend for a reduction in major cardiac procedures and improvement in quality of life compared with mitral surgery alone. ConclusionsThese findings suggest that there is clear benefit to the surgical elimination of mitral regurgitation and that there is additional benefit with the CorCap cardiac support device. Given the improvement in left ventricle structure and function, along with a low mortality rate, physicians should strongly consider offering mitral valve surgery in combination with the CorCap cardiac support device to patients with heart failure who are on an optimal medical regimen...|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveTo {{assess the}} effect of {{extremity}} vascular complications (EVCs, including ischemia or vessel trauma) on the outcomes of patients receiving <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> <b>devices</b> (CSDs, including ventricular assist device [VAD] and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [ECMO]). MethodsInstitutional Review Board-approved, retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database of all temporary and permanent CSD recipients from 7 / 1 / 10 to 6 / 30 / 12. Patient demographics, procedural data, and outcomes were analyzed. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality at 30 -days post-CSD initiation. ResultsOf 208 patients who received CSDs, 31 (14. 9 %) experienced EVC: 13 (8. 9 %) of the 146 permanent VADs, 10 (26. 3 %) of the 38 temporary VADs, and 8 (33. 3 %) of the 24 ECMO patients. The 30 -day mortality for CSD-EVC patients was not significantly {{higher than that of}} the CSD patients who did not experience EVC for permanent VAD (15. 4 % vs 4. 5 %; P =. 15) and ECMO patients (50. 0 % vs 68. 75 %; P = 1. 00), but was significantly higher for temporary VAD patients (80. 0 % vs 35. 7 %; P =. 03). Within the CSD-EVC cohort, patients who received a temporary VAD had a significantly higher 30 -day mortality and decision to withdraw care after EVC compared with those who received a permanent VAD (P =. 01 and P <. 01, respectively). Looking beyond the 30 -day window, EVC was associated with higher mortality rates in the permanent VAD population (53. 8 % vs 25. 6 %; P =. 025) but not the temporary VAD or ECMO groups. ConclusionsIn temporary VAD recipients, EVCs result in higher 30 -day mortality, more frequent withdrawal of care, and shortened survival time relative to the global temporary VAD group. EVC in permanent VAD recipients did not affect early (30 -day) mortality rates, but strongly predicted a higher cumulative mortality risk for the 2 -year study period. Overall ECMO mortality rates were high, and not significantly impacted by the occurrence of EVC. The nature of the EVC (cannulation site complication vs embolic injury) did not impact mortality.

40|$|Congestive {{heart failure}} {{is one of}} the most common {{diseases}} worldwide with increasing incidence. Although drug therapy is quite effective, the mortality of patients with progressive heart failure is still high. The loss of systolic myocardial function leads to an increase of wall stress and to an activation of the neuroendocrine system with a long term progression. The aim of the study is the radiological evaluation of a new surgical technique, the <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> <b>device</b> (CorCap, <b>Cardiac</b> <b>Support</b> Device; Acorn Cardiovascular Inc., St. Paul, MN). The key goal of this surgical procedure is reduction of the wall stress and reversion of the remodelling effect due to the biocompatible compliant mesh graft which is wrapped around the ventricles. Patients with dilated cardiomyopathy are referred to electron beam computer tomography (EBCT) before surgery and twice after the mesh graft implantation. Analysed parameters are volumes of the left and right ventricles, ejection fraction and the myocardial wall thickening. The advantage of EBCT lies in the short acquisition time per CT section as well as the possibility to examine patients with contraindications for MRI. The analysis indicates a significant decrease of left and right ventricular volumes after surgery with simultaneous increase of ejection fraction and regional contractility.

40|$|ObjectiveThe study {{objective}} was to evaluate the long-term (5 -year) safety and efficacy of mitral valve surgery with and without the CorCap <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> <b>device</b> (Acorn Cardiovascular, St Paul, Minn) in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and New York Heart Association class II–IV heart failure. BackgroundThe Acorn trial provided {{a unique opportunity to}} assess the long-term safety and efficacy of mitral valve surgery because clinical visits and echocardiograms (read by a core laboratory) were completed for 5 years of follow-up. Further, this study provided follow-up data on the long-term effect of the CorCap <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> <b>device</b> as an adjunct to mitral valve surgery. MethodsFrom the original Acorn trial (n =  300 patients), 193 patients were enrolled in the mitral valve repair/replacement stratum. A total of 102 were randomized to mitral valve surgery alone (control group) and 91 were randomized to mitral valve surgery with implantation of the CorCap <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> <b>device</b> (treatment group). Patients were followed up for 5 years. ResultsAs previously reported, 30 -day operative mortality was only 1. 6 %. At 5 years, the total mortality was 30 % with an average annual mortality rate of approximately 6 % per year. The effects of mitral valve surgery led to a progressive decrease in left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes, which were highly significant at all time points. At the end of 5 years, there was an average reduction in left ventricular end-diastolic volume of 75 mL, which represents a 28 % reduction from baseline. During 5 years of follow-up, 29 patients had recurrent mitral regurgitation and 5 patients underwent repeat mitral valve surgery. The addition of the CorCap device led to greater decreases in left ventricular end-diastolic volume (average difference of 16. 5 mL; P = . 05), indicating that the CorCap device had an additive effect to the mitral valve operation. ConclusionsThis study demonstrates long-term improvement in left ventricular structure and function after mitral valve surgery for up to 5 years.

40|$|BackgroundThe CorCap <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> <b>device</b> (Acorn Cardiovascular, Inc, St Paul, Minn) is {{the first}} device that {{specifically}} addresses ventricular remodeling in heart failure by reducing wall stress. We previously reported outcomes from the Acorn randomized trial to a common closing date (22. 9 months of follow-up). This report summarizes results of extended followup to 5 years. MethodsA total of 107 patients {{were enrolled in the}} no–mitral valve repair/replacement stratum including 57 in the CorCap treatment group and 50 in the control (optimal medical therapy alone) group. Patients were assessed every year, until completing 5 years of follow-up, for survival, adverse events, major cardiac procedures, New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional status, and echocardiograms, which were read at a core laboratory. ResultsOverall survivals were similar between the treatment and control groups, demonstrating no late adverse effect on mortality. The treatment group had significant reductions in left ventricular end-diastolic volume (P = . 029) as well as a small increase in sphericity index. More patients in the treatment group improved by at least 1 NYHA functional class (P = . 0005). There was no difference in rates of adverse events. In a subgroup of patients with an intermediate left ventricular end-diastolic dimension, there was a significant reduction in the Kaplan-Meier estimate of the freedom from the composite end point of death and major cardiac procedures (P = . 04).

The objective {{of this study was}} to review the global clinical safety and feasibility experience of this device. MethodsThe Acorn CorCap <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> <b>device</b> (Acorn Cardiovascular, Inc, St Paul, Minn) has been implanted worldwide in more than 130 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy with or without concomitant cardiac surgery. The device is positioned around the ventricles and given a custom fit. A series of 48 patients were implanted with the device in initial safety and feasibility studies, of whom 33 also received concomitant cardiac surgery. ResultsAt implantation, 11 patients were in New York Heart Association class II, 33 were in class III, and 4 were in class IV. The average CorCap implantation time was 27 minutes. The mean intraoperative reduction in left ventricular end-diastolic dimension was 4. 6 % ± 1 %. There were no device-related intraoperative complications. Eight early and 9 late deaths occurred during follow-up extending to 24 months. Actuarial survival was 73 % at 12 months and 68 % at 24 months. There were no device-related adverse events or evidence of constrictive disease, and coronary artery flow reserve was maintained.

40|$|Following {{demographic}} changes and improved treatment options for cardiac diseases {{the incidence of}} congestive heart failure increases. Despite a remarkable progress in medical therapy there is still a need for surgical procedures, while heart transplantation is only available to a limited number of patients. A central issue of disease progression in heart failure is left ventricular dilation and transformation of ventricular shape to a more spherical one. The CorCap <b>Cardiac</b> <b>Support</b> <b>Device,</b> a preformed mesh-like polyester device, is surgically placed around the ventricles and prevents further dilation. As part of an initial safety and feasibility trial the CorCap was implanted in 29 patients. Three patients with concomitant ventriculotomy were excluded, the remaining 26 patients form the cohort for this study. The patients were divided into two subgroups, one with device placement as the only surgical measure, the other with concomitant mitral valve surgery, mainly mitral valve repair. Follow-up visits were scheduled over a period of two years, including echocardiography and assessment of cardiopulmonary functional performance. 30 -day-mortality was 7, 7 %, the survival after 2 years was 77 %. During the follow-up period a decrease of left ventricular size was observed, while the systolic function improved significantly. The functional performance increased in the majority of the patients by at least one NYHA-class. These findings were more marked in the subgroup without mitral valve surgery. The degree of mitral regurgitation improved significantly after surgical correction of moderate to severe mitral regurgitation, additionally the patients without concomitant mitral valve surgery also showed a decrease of mitral regurgitation on follow-up echocardiography.

40|$|Heart failure (HF) is a {{progressive}} degenerative and malignant syndrome {{with a large}} number of aetiologies including coronary artery disease, chronic hypertension, exposure to toxins, bacteria and viruses and in a significant percentage of HF patients, the causal mechanism is unclear. The HF pathway of morbidity and mortality is well documented and is characterised by step-like periods of relative symptomatic stability, compensation, separated by decompensatory episodes. The homeostatic response to the decline in cardiac function is multifactorial and involves most organs. There is an increase in resting rate, intra-cardiac hormone production (catecholamines, aldosterone, etc) and in particular structural changes occur with increased mass and dilatation (dilated cardiomyopathy, DCM). DCM is associated with decreased cardiac output, contractility and energy efficiency and an increase in pro-arrhythmia and conduction defects. Kass et al [1] first demonstrated in patients who had undergone a cardio-myoplasty procedure, that, preventing further dilatation in DCM was beneficial and that the improved cardiovascular status was largely independent of muscle stimulation. We hypothesised that this outcome could be achieved by implanting a fabric <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> <b>device</b> around both ventricles to the AV junction. Subsequently it was shown by us and others [2, 3] (in different animal models of DCM) that passive ventricula...|$|R
40|$|Background—Whether {{mechanical}} restraint of {{the left}} ventricle (LV) can influence remodeling after myocardial infarction (MI) remains poorly understood. This study surgically placed a <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> <b>device</b> (CSD) over the entire LV and examined LV and myocyte geometry and function after MI. Methods and Results—Post-MI sheep (35 to 45 kg; MI size, 232 %) were randomized to placement of the CorCap CSD (Acorn Cardiovascular, Inc) (MICSD; n 6) or remained untreated (MI only; n 5). Uninstrumented sheep (n 10) served as controls. At 3 months after MI, LV end-diastolic volume (by MRI) was increased in the MI only group compared with controls (988 versus 434 mL; P 0. 05). In the MICSD group, LV end-diastolic volume was lower than MI only values (567 mL; P 0. 05) but remained higher than controls (P 0. 05). Isolated LV myocyte shortening velocity was reduced by 35 % from control values (P 0. 05) in both MI groups. LV myocyte -adrenergic response was reduced with MI but normalized in the MICSD group. LV myocyte length increased in the MI group and was reduced in the MICSD group. Relative collagen content was increased and matrix metalloproteinase- 9 was decreased within the MI border region of the CSD group. Conclusions—A CSD beneficially modified LV and myocyte remodeling after MI through both cellular and extracellular mechanisms. These findings provide evidence that nonpharmacological strategies can interrupt adverse LV remodeling after MI. (Circulation. 2005; 112 : 1274 - 1283. ...|$|R
40|$|Background: Myocardial {{function}} deteriorates during ventricular remodeling {{in patients}} with congestive heart failure (HF). Ventricular restraint therapy using a <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> <b>device</b> (CSD) is designed {{to reduce the amount}} of stress inside the dilated ventricles, which in turn halts remodeling. However, as an open mesh surrounding the heart, it is unknown what the mechanical properties of the CSD are in different fiber orientations. Methods: Composite specimens of CorCap (Acorn Cardiovascular, Inc, St. Paul, MN) CSD fabric and silicone were constructed in different fiber orientations and tested on a custom-built biaxial stretcher. Silicone controls were made and stretched to detect the parameters of the matrix. CSD coefficients were calculated using the composite and silicone matrix stress-strain data. Stiffness in different fiber orientations was determined. Results: Silicone specimens exerted a linear behavior, with stiffness of 2. 57 MPa. For the composites with 1 fiber set aligned with respect to the stretch axes, stiffness in the direction of the aligned fiber set was higher than that in the cross-fiber direction (14. 39 MPa versus 5. 66 MPa), indicating greater compliance in the cross-fiber direction. When the orientation of the fiber sets in the composite were matched to the expected clinical orientation of the implanted CorCap, the stiffness in the circumferential axis (with respect to the heart) was greater than in the longitudinal axis (10. 55 MPa versus 9. 70 MPa). Conclusions: The mechanical properties of the CorCap demonstrate directionality with greater stiffness circumferentially than longitudinally. Implantation of the CorCap clinically should take into account the directionality of the biomechanics to optimize ventricular restraint. © 2013 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons...|$|R
40|$|Background: The Acorn CorCap <b>Cardiac</b> <b>Support</b> <b>Device</b> (CSD; Acorn Cardiovascular Inc, St. Paul, MN) is a woven poly ester {{jacket that}} is placed around {{the heart and}} {{designed}} to reverse the progressive remodeling associated with dilated cardiomyopathy. However, {{the effects of the}} Acorn CSD on myofiber stress and ventricular function remain unknown. We tested the hypothesis that the Acorn CSD reduces end-diastolic (ED) myofiber stress. Methods: A previously described weakly coupled biventricular finite element (FE) model and circulatory model based on magnetic resonance images of a dog with dilated cardiomyopathy was used. Virtual applications of the CSD alone (Acorn), CSD with rotated fabric fiber orientation (rotated), CSD with 5 % prestretch (tight), and CSD wrapped only around the left ventricle (LV; LV-only) were performed, and the effect on myofiber stress at ED and pump function was calculated. Results: The Acorn CSD has a large effect on ED myofiber stress in the LV free wall, with reductions of 55 %, 79 %, 92 %, and 40 % in the Acorn, rotated, tight, and LV-only cases, respectively. However, there is a tradeoff in which the Acorn CSD reduces stroke volume at LV end-diastolic pressure of 8 mm Hg by 23 %, 25 %, 30 %, and 7 %, respectively, in the Acorn, rotated, tight, and LV-only cases. Conclusions: The Acorn CSD significantly reduces ED myofiber stress. However, CSD wrapped only around the LV was the only case with minimal negative effect on pump function. Findings suggest that LV-only CSD and Acorn fabric orientation should be optimized to allow maximal myofiber stress reduction with minimal reduction in pump function. © 2013 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectivesWe {{sought to}} test the {{efficacy}} of a passive elastic containment device to reverse chronic chamber remodeling and adrenergic down-regulation in the failing heart, yet still maintaining preload reserve. BackgroundProgressive cardiac remodeling due to heart failure is thought to exacerbate underlying myocardial dysfunction. In a pressure–volume analysis, we tested the impact of limiting progressive cardiac dilation by an externally applied passive containment device on both basal and adrenergic-stimulated function in failing canine hearts. MethodsIschemic dilated cardiomyopathy was induced by repeated intracoronary microembolizations in six dogs. The animals were studied before and {{three to six months}} after surgical implantation of a thin polyester mesh (<b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> <b>device</b> [CSD]) that surrounded both cardiac ventricles. Pressure–volume relations were measured by a conductance micromanometer catheter. ResultsLong-term use of the CSD lowered end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes by − 19 ± 4 % and − 22 ± 8 %, respectively (both p < 0. 0001) and shifted the end-systolic pressure–volume relation to the left (p < 0. 01), compatible with reverse remodeling. End-diastolic pressure and chamber diastolic stiffness did not significantly change. The systolic response to dobutamine markedly improved after CSD implantation (55 ± 8 % rise in ejection fraction after CSD vs. − 10 ± 8 % before CSD, p < 0. 05), in conjunction with a heightened adenylyl cyclase response to isoproterenol. There was no change in the density or affinity of beta-adrenergic receptors. Diastolic compliance was not adversely affected, and preload-recruitable function was preserved with the CSD, consistent with a lack of constriction. ConclusionsReverse remodeling with reduced systolic wall stress and improved adrenergic signaling can be achieved by passive external support that does not generate diastolic constriction. This approach may prove useful in the treatment of chronic heart failure...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a {{frequent}} complication in critically ill patients and may result in increased morbidity and poor outcome. Few data exist on the risk factors and time course of AKI development after cardiac arrest (CA). OBJECTIVES. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the occurrence and time course of AKI in a single-center cohort of CA patients. METHODS. We reviewed all patients consecutively admitted for CA to our ICU from January 2008 to October 2012 who stayed in our Dept. of Intensive Care for at least 48 hours. Demographics, comorbidities, development of sepsis, type, location and duration of arrest, use of vasopressors, mechanical ventilation, renal replacement therapy (RRT) and of potential nephrotoxic agents were recorded. AKI was defined as a daily UO < 0. 5 ml/kg/h and/or an increase in serum creatinine of = 0. 3 mg/dL from baseline levels. Creatinine clearance (CrCl) was calculated on urinary excretion over the first day of ICU stay. Neurological outcome was assessed using the Cerebral Performance Category (CPC, 1 =good recovery; 5 = dead) scale at hospital discharge. RESULTS. Of a total of 253 patients admitted for CA over the study period, 199 patients met the inclusion criteria (median age 62 years; 134 male gender). A total of 88 (44 %) patients developed AKI during the ICU stay, with a median time to AKI of 2 [2 - 3] days since admission. Patients with AKI had higher proportion of witnessed CA (73 / 88 vs. 77 / 114, p = 0. 01) and in-hospital CA (42 / 88 vs. 34 / 114, p< 0. 001) than those without AKI. They also had a lower CrCl on day 1 since admission (23 [8 - 45] vs. 66 [27 - 120] ml/min, p< 0. 001). Patients with AKI were more commonly treated with vasopressors (63 / 88 vs. 43 / 114, p< 0. 001), dobutamine (73 / 88 vs. 40 / 114, p< 0. 001) or a mechanical <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> <b>device</b> (i. e. IABP or ECMO, 24 / 88 vs. 15 / 114, p= 0. 01) and had a greater fluid balance over the first 48 hours of ICU stay (4. 6 [3. 1 - 8. 5] L vs. 3. 3 [1. 9 - 5. 2] L, p< 0. 001). These patients had a trend towards a higher ICU mortality (54 / 88 vs. 55 / 114, p= 0. 06) and CPC score (5 [2 - 5] vs. 4. 5 [1 - 5], p= 0. 07). CONCLUSIONS. AKI is very common after CA, occurring in more than 40 % of patients. These patients had a more severe hemodynamic impairment and needed a more aggressive ICU therapy, which resulted in a poorer brain recovery. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|In {{my thesis}} we devote to {{problems}} {{of patients with}} the implanted system HeartMate II, which is now approved as a support for an indication to bridging the time to heart transplantation and for a destination therapy for patients with a refractory heart failure. We also devote to the access of nurses to these patients. The theoretical part of the thesis is generally devoted to mechanical <b>cardiac</b> <b>supports</b> and indications to their introduction. Next part describes HeartMate II, specifics of the nursing care for a patient who is after implantation mechanical <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> HeartMate II and limitations, which follow for a patient at home. The target {{of the work is}} to: 1. Find out, what the priorities of needs of the patient with a mechanical <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> are in a nursing care. 2. Find out, how the patient with a mechanical <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> perceives himself and his future. 3. Find out possibilities of nursing interventions to a saturation of needs by priorities of patients with mechanical <b>cardiac</b> <b>supports.</b> For the qualitative part of the empirical research the method of questioning with technique a semi-structured interview with opened questions was chosen. The research group consists of four patients after the implantation of left-hand mechanical <b>cardiac</b> <b>supports</b> HeartMate II. In this part we were finding out answers to four research questions. 1. Which damaged needs are predominant by patients with mechanical <b>cardiac</b> <b>supports?</b> 2. Do patients with mechanical <b>cardiac</b> <b>supports</b> have enough information about possible complications related to the life after the implantation of a mechanical support? 3. How does the patient with a mechanical <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> perceive his future? 4. How does the patient with the mechanical <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> HeartMate II perceive himself? Then results of research were analyzed and written into schemes. In the quantitative part of the research four hypotheses were determined. 1. Interventions of nurses during a nursing care which is oriented to monitoring of vital functions are predominant over the orientation of needs that are changed by the life with a mechanical <b>cardiac</b> <b>support.</b> 2. Nurses are available to answer to patients with mechanical <b>cardiac</b> <b>supports</b> questions which are related to a service of the device HeartMate II. 3. Nurses are well informed about possible complications after the implantation of the left-hand mechanical support. 4. Nursing interventions of nurses are predominant over interventions of {{the other members of the}} team during the care of patient after the implantation of the left-hand mechanical <b>cardiac</b> <b>support.</b> The research group of the research consists of nurses, who are working at the department with beds, the intensive care unit of clinic of a cardiovascular surgery and at the resuscitation department of an anaesthesiology and resuscitation in IKEM. 95 respondents were addressed. The returnability of questionnaires was 69 % from the beginning number. On the basis of the result of the research we think that targets were fulfilled. Patients have enough information about complications related with the life with the mechanical <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> HeartMate II. Patients consider a satisfaction of psychical needs, especially the feeling of a safety and a security, as a priority, although they are highly specific problems. In this view a psychotherapeutic access and a therapeutic communication of a nurse with a patient are important. We are going to hand results of the research over to the management of IKEM. A thematic schedule of a tutorial was created. This tutorial engaged in psychic needs of a patient, a psychotherapeutic access of nurses and a therapeutic communication with a patient...|$|R
