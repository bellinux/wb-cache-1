40|$|Objective: To {{examine whether}} self-pacing reduces the {{physiological}} challenge of performing 5000 m rowing ergometry exercise {{in comparison with}} a matched-intensity exercise condition in which a constant effort pacing strategy is enforced. Methods: Nine healthy well-trained male participants volunteered to participate in three 5000 m rowing conditions (two submaximal and one maximal conditions) in an individualised order. In the submaximal conditions, participants were required to (1) perform 5000 m at a <b>constant</b> <b>rating</b> of perceived exertion (RPE 15 -Hard) (SubRPE) or (2) perform 5000 m at an enforced constant pace equivalent to the mean power output (PO) of the SubRPE condition (SubEXT). A maximal condition (MaxTT) was included to disguise {{the purpose of the}} study and to facilitate an element of randomisation in the test sequence. Dynamic intratest responses were assessed every 30 s: PO, Vo 2, iEMG, core (Tc) and skin temperatures (Tsk). Results: There was no difference between performance times of the two submaximal trials. The mean PO represented 83. 83 (SD 8. 88) ...|$|E
40|$|Many {{rehabilitation}} clinics offering aquatic therapy {{have implemented}} programsconsisting of exercise {{in shallow water}} conditions; The majority of studies regarding physiological responses to exercise on land versus in water have focused on deep water running (DWR) conditions and did not include shallow water running (SWR) in the comparison. Heart rates for shallow-water exercise,however, are often prescribed {{based on the results}} of DWR studies. Thus, the purpose of this study was to compare heart rates during water running at two different levels of immersion at a <b>constant</b> <b>rating</b> of perceived exertion (RPE). Forty-two subjects were tested in both deep and shallow waterrunning conditions. A paired t-test was performed to assess heart rate (HR) at the two levels of water immersion. The results revealed a significant difference (p= 0. 0007) of 10 beats/min- 1 between the mean HR during SWR (155. 8 beats·min - 1) and DWR (145. 8 beats·min [...] 1). These findings suggest that shallow water exercise heart rates should not be prescribed using the deep water HR values often recommended by aquatic professionals...|$|E
40|$|Uncertainty in {{discharge}} data must be critically assessed before {{data can}} be used in, e. g. water resources estimation or hydrological modelling. In the alluvial Choluteca River in Honduras, the river-bed characteristics change over time as fill, scour and other processes occur in the channel, leading to a non-stationary stage-discharge relationship and difficulties in deriving consistent rating curves. Few studies have investigated the uncertainties related to non-stationarity in the stage-discharge relationship. We calculated discharge and the associated uncertainty with a weighted fuzzy regression of rating curves applied within a moving time window, based on estimated uncertainties in the observed rating data. An 18 -year-long dataset with unusually frequent ratings (1268 in total) was {{the basis of this}} study. A large temporal variability in the stage-discharge relationship was found especially for low flows. The time-variable rating curve resulted in discharge estimate differences of − 60 to + 90 % for low flows and ± 20 % for medium to high flows when compared to a <b>constant</b> <b>rating</b> curve. The final estimated uncertainty in discharge was substantial and the uncertainty limits varied between − 43 to + 73 % of the best discharge estimate...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} effects of 3 {{contrast}} medium injection techniques on attenuation values for canine adrenal glands during contrast-enhanced CT. ANIMALS 9 healthy Beagles. PROCEDURES: 3 protocols were evaluated in a randomized cross-over design study: 700 mg of iodine/kg at a <b>constant</b> injection <b>rate</b> over 20 seconds (full-dose <b>constant</b> <b>rate),</b> the same dose at a rate following an exponential decay curve over 20 seconds (full-dose decelerated rate), and 350 mg of iodine/kg at a <b>constant</b> injection <b>rate</b> over 10 seconds (half-dose <b>constant</b> <b>rate).</b> Multislice CT images were obtained before and at predetermined time points {{after the start of}} contrast medium injection. RESULTS: Median peak attenuation values were 129, 133, and 87 Hounsfield units with the full-dose <b>constant</b> <b>rate,</b> full-dose decelerated <b>rate,</b> and half-dose <b>constant</b> <b>rate</b> injection protocols, respectively. Peak attenuation differed significantly between the full-dose <b>constant</b> <b>rate</b> and half-dose <b>constant</b> <b>rate</b> injection protocols and between the full-dose decelerated <b>rate</b> and half-dose <b>constant</b> <b>rate</b> injection protocols. Median time to peak attenuation did not differ significantly among injection methods and was 30, 23, and 15 seconds for the full-dose <b>constant</b> <b>rate,</b> full-dose decelerated <b>rate,</b> and half-dose <b>constant</b> <b>rate</b> injections, respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The dose of contrast medium and the timing of postinjection CT scanning were main determinants of peak attenuation for adrenal glands in healthy dogs; effects of the 3 injection protocols on attenuation were minor. The exponentially decelerated injection method was subjectively complex. A constant injection protocol delivering 700 mg of iodine/kg over 20 seconds, with scans obtained approximately 30 seconds after starting contrast medium injection, provided images with maximum adrenal gland attenuation values...|$|R

40|$|The recent boom {{of aquatic}} therapy {{programs}} explore {{the use of}} water exercise for cardiorespiratory fitness and rehabilitation. However, traditional methods such as heart rate (HR) may not accurately reflect {{the amount of work}} done in the water, and may over prescribe intensities. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare HR differences between running on a treadmill and in deep water at a <b>constant</b> <b>rating</b> of perceived exertion (RPE). Twenty-four subjects were tested on a treadmill and in deep water at RPE- 15 (Hard). The differences were statistically analyzed through the use of a repeated measures ANOVA. Results revealed that there was a significant decrease in HR (18. 2 beats/min- 1) for the water mode compared to the treadmill (p 3 ̆e 0. 01). There was no significant difference between RPE for the two modes (p 3 ̆e 0. 01). The results of this study support the need for caution in prescribing target HR zones for aquatic exercise from land HR values. The differences between the two modes may be attributed to the physical properties of water. RPE seemed to provide an excellent alternative for HR measurement as it was easy for the subjects to learn and appeared to be reliable and reproducible...|$|E

40|$|An actual {{account of}} the angle random walk (ARW) {{coefficients}} of gyros in the <b>constant</b> <b>rate</b> biased rate ring laser gyro (RLG) inertial navigation system (INS) {{is very important in}} practical engineering applications. However, no reported experimental work has dealt with the issue of characterizing the ARW of the <b>constant</b> <b>rate</b> biased RLG in the INS. To avoid the need for high cost precise calibration tables and complex measuring set-ups, the objective {{of this study is to}} present a cost-effective experimental approach to characterize the ARW of the gyros in the <b>constant</b> <b>rate</b> biased RLG INS. In the system, turntable dynamics and other external noises would inevitably contaminate the measured RLG data, leading to the question of isolation of such disturbances. A practical observation model of the gyros in the <b>constant</b> <b>rate</b> biased RLG INS was discussed, and an experimental method based on the fast orthogonal search (FOS) for the practical observation model to separate ARW error from the RLG measured data was proposed. Validity of the FOS-based method was checked by estimating the ARW coefficients of the mechanically dithered RLG under stationary and turntable rotation conditions. By utilizing the FOS-based method, the average ARW coefficient of the <b>constant</b> <b>rate</b> biased RLG in the postulate system is estimated. The experimental results show that the FOS-based method can achieve high denoising ability. This method estimate the ARW coefficients of the <b>constant</b> <b>rate</b> biased RLG in the postulate system accurately. The FOS-based method does not need precise calibration table with high cost and complex measuring set-up, and Statistical results of the tests will provide us references in engineering application of the <b>constant</b> <b>rate</b> biased RLG INS...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to study systematically the dynamical properties of a ratio-dependent predator–prey model with nonzero <b>constant</b> <b>rate</b> predator harvesting. It is shown that the model has at most two equilibria in the first quadrant and can exhibit numerous kinds of bifurcation phenomena, including the bifurcation of cusp type of codimension 2 (i. e., Bogdanov–Takens bifurcation), the subcritical and supercritical Hopf bifurcations. These results reveal far richer dynamics compared to the model with no harvesting and different dynamics compared to the model with nonzero <b>constant</b> <b>rate</b> prey harvesting in [D. Xiao, L. Jennings, Bifurcations of a ratio-dependent predator–prey system with <b>constant</b> <b>rate</b> harvesting, SIAM Appl. Math. 65 (2005) 737 – 753]. Biologically, it is shown that nonzero <b>constant</b> <b>rate</b> predator harvesting can prevent mutual extinction as a possible outcome of the predator prey interaction, and remove the singularity of the origin, which was regarded as “pathological behavior” for a ratio-dependent predator prey model in [P.
