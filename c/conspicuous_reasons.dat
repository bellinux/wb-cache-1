40|$|Status and Binding Power of the Denhaag Convention 1954. Armed {{conflict}} between the United States and Iraq indicates that the two parties neglect cultural objects. The disobedient towards the provisions of international law, particularly the 1954 Hague Convention and its additional protocols, {{regarded as one of}} the <b>conspicuous</b> <b>reasons</b> for the fatal damage of cultural objects. The only justification to avoid from the obligation od protecting cultural objects is that one of the party does not bind to the instrument of international law. This has made the position and power of the Hague Convention 1954 becomes a crucial issue to the extent of its effectiveness.   DOI: 10. 15408 /jch. v 1 i 1. 2984 </p...|$|E
40|$|Every {{year since}} 2002, 150 to 200 farmers in Norway have deregistered from {{certified}} organic production. The {{aim of this}} study was to get behind these figures and improve our understanding of the reasoning leading to decisions to opt out. Four cases of deregistered organic farmers with grain, sheep, dairy or vegetable production were selected for in-depth studies. The cases were analysed from the perspective of individual competencies and the competencies available in the networks of the selected organic farmers. Besides the <b>conspicuous</b> <b>reasons</b> to opt out of certified organic farming, such as regulations getting stricter over time and low income, personal reasons such as disappointment and need for acceptance were also important. This shows that hard mechanisms, such as economic support and premium prices, are not sufficient to motivate farmers for sustained organic management. Support and encouragement, for example from people in the local community, politicians and other spokespersons, would likely contribute to increase farmers’ motivation...|$|E
40|$|Consumer {{behaviour}} {{has always}} been the focus of academic marketing research due to its significant managerial implications; even so, various aspects worth analyzing have been neglected. Size heuristics is one of the topics that did not receive sufficient attention so far. Apart from the theoretical contribution to the marketing filed, this topic has practical implications in the buying decision process {{as well as in the}} context of environmental concern. If size does influence the evaluation of a product, would it not lead to a contradiction with the general concern regarding a more sustainable consumption? By identifying this gap in the literature, the present study proposes that there is indeed a link between the size of a product and the perceptions that consumers form upon its quality, desirability and willingness to pay for it. Through a web – based survey using two product categories - apartments and cars - this study examines whether the preferences for larger or smaller stimuli leads to differences in evaluating a product. The analysis shows a positive association between the preference for large items and the impact on desirability. However, this association could not be established for the other two variables. The reasons behind a preference for larger items are also investigated. The authors propose three possible explanatory reasons: utilitarian, conspicuous and hedonic consumption. When the apartments category was investigated, utilitarian reasons were found to be a motivation for purchasing a larger version. On the other hand, <b>conspicuous</b> <b>reasons</b> were found to influence the preference for a larger version in the cars category. Hedonic consumption could not be explored due to the lack of reliable measurement scales. The findings of this study have both theoretical and practical implications and point out essential aspects worth to be further examined. Consequently, the present study will not only contribute to the consumer behaviour literature, but most importantly will enable managers to better understand the purchase behaviour of consumers in terms of emphasizing the preferred physical attributes...|$|E
60|$|That which disconcerted all who had {{dealings}} with Miltoun was the discovery made soon or late, {{that they could}} not be sure how anything would strike him. In his mind, as in his face, there was a certain regularity, and then--impossible to say exactly where--it would, shoot off and twist round a corner. This was the legacy no doubt of the hard-bitten individuality, which had brought to the front so many of his ancestors; for in Miltoun was the blood not only of the Caradocs and Fitz-Harolds, but of most other prominent families in the kingdom, all of whom, in those ages before money made the man, must have had a forbear <b>conspicuous</b> by <b>reason</b> of qualities, not always fine, but always poignant.|$|R
5000|$|A casquette girl, {{originally}} {{known as}} a fille à la cassette (girl with a cassette) but also known historically as a casket girl or a pelican girl, {{was one of the}} women brought from France to the French colonies of Louisiana to marry. The name derives from the small chests, known as casquettes, in which they carried their clothes. [...] They were <b>conspicuous</b> by <b>reason</b> of their virtue. Normally women were supplied to the colonists by raking the streets of Paris for undesirables, or by emptying the houses of correction. The casquette girls, however, were recruited from church charitable institutions, usually orphanages and convents, and, although poor, were practically guaranteed to be virgins. For this reason it later became a matter of pride in Louisiana to show descent from them.|$|R
6000|$|Chief {{among the}} {{remaining}} figures on my childhood's stage were the many servants of our house, the [...] "generals," [...] {{as they were}} termed. So rapid, as a rule, was their transit through our kitchen that only one or two, <b>conspicuous</b> by <b>reason</b> of their lingering, remain upon my view. It was a neighbourhood in which domestic servants were not much required. Those intending {{to take up the}} calling seriously went westward. The local ranks were recruited mainly from the discontented or the disappointed, from those who, unappreciated at home, hoped from the stranger more discernment; or from the love-lorn, the jilted and the jealous, who took the cap and apron as in an earlier age their like would have taken the veil. Maybe, to the comparative seclusion of our basement, as contrasted with the alternative frivolity of shop or factory, they felt in such mood more attuned. With the advent of the new or the recovery of the old young man they would plunge again into the vain world, leaving my poor mother to search afresh amid the legions of the cursed.|$|R
40|$|Crystal {{structures}} of Trögers base (5, 11 -methano- 2, 8 -dimethyl- 5, 6, 11, 12 -tetrahydrodibenzo[b,f][1, 5]diazocine) analogues with the methyl groups replaced by ethyl, iso-propyl and tert-butyl groups were studied. The incidence of Z′ > 1 structures increases to rather <b>conspicuous</b> levels. The <b>reasons</b> behind this trend are expanded upon, {{and a possible}} explanation is given in {{the flexibility of the}} alkyl substituents and van der Waals stabilization. In combination these effects allow for an additional stabilization of the packing by small changes in the molecular conformations, thus expanding the size of the asymmetric unit. © 2010 International Union of Crystallography Printed in Singapore - all rights reserved.

60|$|We {{have now}} {{to deal with}} a class of colours which are the very {{opposite}} of those we have hitherto considered, since, instead of serving to conceal the animals that possess them or as recognition marks to their associates, they are developed {{for the express purpose of}} rendering the species <b>conspicuous.</b> The <b>reason</b> of this is that the animals in question are either the possessors of some deadly weapons, as stings or poison fangs, or they are uneatable, and are thus so disagreeable to the usual enemies of their kind that they are never attacked when their peculiar powers or properties are known. It is, therefore, important that they should not be mistaken for defenceless or eatable species of the same class or order, since in that case they might suffer injury, or even death, before their enemies discovered the danger or the uselessness of the attack. They require some signal or danger-flag which shall serve as a warning to would-be enemies not to attack them, and they have usually obtained this in the form of conspicuous or brilliant coloration, very distinct from the protective tints of the defenceless animals allied to them.|$|R
60|$|If I have {{reported}} the behaviour of the House intelligibly, the reader has {{been surprised by}} it, and has wondered whence these law-makers come {{and what they are}} made of; and he has probably supposed that the conduct exhibited at the Long Sitting was far out of the common, and due to special excitement and irritation. As to the make-up of the House, it is this: the deputies come from all the walks of life and from all the grades of society. There are princes, counts, barons, priests, peasants, mechanics, labourers, lawyers, judges, physicians, professors, merchants, bankers, shopkeepers. They are religious men, they are earnest, sincere, devoted, and they hate the Jews. The title of Doctor is so common in the House that one may almost say that the deputy who does not bear it is by that <b>reason</b> <b>conspicuous.</b> I am assured {{that it is not a}} self-granted title, and not an honorary one, but an earned one; that in Austria it is very seldom conferred as a mere compliment; that in Austria the degrees of Doctor of Music, Doctor of Philosophy, and so on, are not conferred by the seats of learning; and so, when an Austrian is called Doctor, it means that he is either a lawyer or a physician, and that he is not a self-educated man, but is college-bred, and has been diplomaed for merit.|$|R
