40|$|Objectives: This paper {{investigates the}} {{effectiveness}} of sonification, continuous auditory alert mapped {{to the state of}} a monitored task, in supporting unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) supervisory control. Background: UAV supervisory control requires monitoring each UAV across multiple tasks (e. g., course maintenance) via a predominantly visual display, which currently is supported with discrete auditory alerts. Sonification has been shown to enhance monitoring performance in domains such as anesthesiology by allowing an operator to immediately determine an entity's (e. g., patient) current and projected states, and is a promising alternative to discrete alerts in UAV control. However, minimal research compares sonification to discrete alerts, and no research assesses {{the effectiveness of}} sonification for monitoring multiple entities (e. g., multiple UAVs). Method: An experiment was conducted with 39 military personnel, using a simulated setup. Participants controlled single and multiple UAVs, and received sonifications or discrete alerts based on UAV <b>course</b> <b>deviations</b> and late target arrivals. Results: Regardless of the number of UAVs supervised, the <b>course</b> <b>deviation</b> sonification resulted in 1. 9 s faster reactions to <b>course</b> <b>deviations,</b> a 19 % enhancement from discrete alerts...|$|R

Conclusions: Sonifications can outperform discrete alerts when designed to aid operators to predict future states of monitored tasks. However, sonifications may mask other auditory alerts, and interfere with other monitoring tasks that require divided attention.

40|$|Electric {{powertrain}} faults {{that could}} occur during normal driving {{can affect the}} dynamic behaviour of the vehicle and might result in significant <b>course</b> <b>deviations.</b> The severity depends both {{on the characteristics of}} the fault itself as well as on how sensitive the vehicle reacts to this type of fault. In this work, a sensitivity study is conducted on the effects of vehicle design parameters, such as geometries and tyre characteristics, and fault characteristics. The vehicle specifications are based on three different parameter sets representing a small city car, a medium-sized sedan and a large passenger car. The evaluation criteria cover the main motions of the vehicle, i. e. longitudinal velocity difference, lateral offset and side slip angle on the rear axle as indicator of the directional stability. A design of experiments approach is applied and the influence on the <b>course</b> <b>deviation</b> is analysed for each studied parameter separately and for all first order combinations. Vehicle parameters of high sensitivity have been found for each criterion. The mass factor is highly relevant for all three motions, while the additional factors wheel base, track width, yaw inertia and vehicle velocity are mainly influencing the lateral and the yaw motion. Changes in the tyre parameters are in general less significant than the vehicle parameters. Among the tyre parameters, the stiffness factor of the tyres on the rear axle has the major influence resulting in a reduction of the <b>course</b> <b>deviation</b> for a stiffer tyre. The fault amplitude is an important fault parameter, together with the fault starting gradient and number of wheels with fault. In this study, it was found that a larger vehicle representing a SUV is more sensitive to these types of faults. To conclude, the result of an electric powertrain fault can cause significant <b>course</b> <b>deviations</b> for all three vehicle types studied. QC 20140909 </p...|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} types of IAPs: {{precision}} approach (PA), approach with vertical guidance (APV), and nonprecision approach (NPA). A PA uses a navigation system that provides <b>course</b> and glidepath <b>deviation.</b> Examples include precision approach radar (PAR), instrument landing system (ILS), and GBAS landing system (GLS). An APV also uses a navigation system for <b>course</b> and glidepath <b>deviation,</b> just not to the same standards as a PA. Examples include baro-VNAV, localizer type directional aid (LDA) with glidepath, LNAV/VNAV and LPV. An NPA uses a navigation system for <b>course</b> <b>deviation</b> but does not provide glidepath information. These approaches include VOR, NDB and LNAV. NPAs are flown to a minimum descent altitude (MDA).|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} system that uses only vision to land a UAV on a runway. We {{describe}} a method for estimating the relative location of the runway as an image by performing image registration against a stack of images in which {{the location of the}} runway is known. An approximation of the camera projection model for a forward-facing view of a runway is derived, allowing the <b>course</b> <b>deviation</b> of the UAV to be estimated from a registered image. The <b>course</b> <b>deviation</b> is used as input to a linear feedback control loop to maintain the correct flight path. Our method is implemented as a real-time multithreaded application, which is used to control an aircraft in Microsoft Flight Simulator. We also show results of applying the vision component of the system to video recorded from an actual UAV. I...|$|R

40|$|The {{flight path}} of locusts is under {{permanent}} visual and mechanoreceptive control (the latter evaluates changes in wind direction). Involuntary <b>course</b> <b>deviations</b> are compensated immediately by a neuronal feedback system or 'autopilot', which induces corrective steering {{movements of the}} wings, abdomen and legs and which are generally accompanied by compensatory head movements (Taylor, 1981; Hensler and Robert, 1990). During apparently straight flight the flight path is not perfectly straight, but instead the insect oscillates slightly along a mean course (Robert, 1988; Hensler and Robert, 1990). The principal neural events underlying corrective steering have been un-ravelled: sensory information on <b>course</b> <b>deviations</b> (coming from the eyes, ocelli and wind-sensitive hairs on the head) and proprioceptive information caused by head movements are coded {{in a class of}} descending deviation detector neurones (DDNs). 15 DDNs have already been identified.

40|$|Neural {{control of}} optomotor {{responses}} in Locusta migratoria was studied using a newly developed preparation of intact, tethered, flying locusts. The preparation could perform normal flight behaviour and head movements while neurones {{in the neck}} connectives were recorded and stimulated intracellularly. <b>Course</b> <b>deviations</b> simulated by an artificial horizon caused optomotor reac-tions, e. g. steering by the wings (monitored as steering reactions in M 97 and M 127, first basalar muscles of fore- and hindwings, respectively) and compensa-tory head movements. Intracellular recordings were made from two identified descending deviation detector neurones, PI(2) 5 and DNC. Both neurones coded direction specifically for <b>course</b> <b>deviations.</b> Electrical activation of either neurone in tethered flight at frequencies of up to 230 Hz elicited steering in M 97 and M 127 and head rolling with latencies of less than 20 ms. These reactions were of the same quality and strength as compensatory head rolling and steering in M 97 and M 127 following horizon rolling of about 40 °. This demonstrates directly a role of PI(2) 5 and DNC in course control...|$|R
40|$|A future {{implementation}} of {{unmanned aerial vehicle}} (UAV) operations is having a single operator control multiple UAVs. The research presented here explores possible avenues of enhancing audio cues of UAV interfaces for this futuristic control of multiple UAVs by a single operator. This project specifically evaluates the value of continuous and discrete audio cues as indicators of <b>course</b> <b>deviations</b> or late arrivals to targets for UAV missions. It also looks at {{the value of the}} audio cues in single and multiple UAV scenarios. To this end, an experiment was carried out on the Multiple Autonomous Unmanned Vehicle Experimental (MAUVE) test bed developed in the Humans and Automation Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with 44 military participants. Specifically, two continuous audio alerts were mapped to two human supervisory tasks within MAUVE. One of the continuous audio alerts, an oscillating <b>course</b> <b>deviation</b> alert was mapped to UAV <b>course</b> <b>deviations</b> which occurred over a continual scale. The other continuous audio alert tested was a modulated late arrival alert which alerted the operator when a UAV was going to be late to a target. In this case the continuous audio was mapped to a discrete event in that the UAV was either on time or late to a target. The audio was continuous in that it was continually on and alerting the participant to {{the current state of the}} UAV. It either was playing a tone indicating the UAV was on time to a target or playing a tone indicating the UAV was late to a target. These continuous alerts were tested against more traditional single beep alerts which acted as discrete alerts. The beeps were discrete in that when they were used for monitoring <b>course</b> <b>deviations</b> a single beep was played when the UAV got to specific threshold off of the course or for late arrivals a single beep was played when the UAV became late. The results show that the use of the continuous audio alerts enhances a single operator’s performance in monitoring single and multiple semi-autonomous vehicles. However, the results also emphasize the necessity to properly integrate the continuous audio with the other auditory alarms and visual representations in a display, as it is possible for discrete audio alerts to be lost in aural saliency of continuous audio, leaving operators reliant on the visual aspects of the display.
