40|$|Glucocorticoid {{signaling}} regulates {{target genes}} by multiple mechanisms, including {{the repression of}} transcriptional activities of nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) though direct protein-protein interactions and subsequent O-GlcNAcylation of RNA polymerase II (pol II). Recent {{studies have shown that}} overexpression of O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine transferase (OGT), which adds an O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) group to the C-terminal domain of RNA pol II, increases the transrepression effects of glucocorticoids (GC). As O-GlcNAcase (OGA) is an enzyme that removes O-GlcNAc from O-GlcNAcylated proteins, we hypothesized that the potentiation of GC effects following OGT overexpression could be similarly observed via the direct inhibition <b>of</b> <b>OGA,</b> inhibiting O-GlcNAc removal from pol II. Here we show that despite pharmacological evidence of target engagement by a selective small molecule inhibitor <b>of</b> <b>OGA,</b> there is no evidence for a sensitizing effect on glucocorticoid-mediated effects on TNF-α promoter activity, or gene expression generally, in human cells. Furthermore, inhibition <b>of</b> <b>OGA</b> did not potentiate glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis in several cancer cell lines. Thus, despite evidence for O-GlcNAc modification of RNA pol II in GR-mediated transrepression, our data indicate that pharmacological inhibition <b>of</b> <b>OGA</b> does not potentiate or enhance glucocorticoid-mediated transrepression...|$|R

40|$|To probe {{increased}} O-GlcNAc {{levels as}} an independent mechanism governing insulin resistance in 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes, a new class <b>of</b> O-GlcNAcase (<b>OGA)</b> inhibitor was studied. 6 -Acetamido- 6 -deoxy-castanospermine (6 -Ac-Cas) is a potent inhibitor <b>of</b> <b>OGA.</b> The structure <b>of</b> 6 -Ac-Cas bound in the active site <b>of</b> an <b>OGA</b> homolog reveals structural features contributing to its potency. Treatment of 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes with 6 -Ac-Cas increases O-GlcNAc levels in a dose-dependent manner.

40|$|Global {{augmentation}} {{of protein}} O-GlcNAcylation occurs {{in response to}} a myriad of stressors and confers a survival advantage at the cellular level. This protective phenomenon has been demonstrated to mediate cardioprotection through various in vitro and in vivo studies during ischemia-reperfusion, myocardial infarction, and oxidative stress; however, relatively little is known of the regulation of protein O-GlcNAcylation. Protein O-GlcNAcylation is regulated by two antagonistic enzymes, namely, O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and O-GlcNAcase (<b>OGA).</b> Ablation <b>of</b> cardiomyocyte OGT, the enzyme that catalyzes the addition of O-GlcNAc to proteins, exacerbates cardiac dysfunction during infarct-induced heart failure (HF). However, little is known of the enzyme mediating the removal of the O-GlcNAc modification, OGA, in the context of HF. The present study focused on this limitation in the field. We characterized the temporal expression <b>of</b> <b>OGA</b> following myocardial infarction (MI) and found that OGA expression is decreased and remains suppressed for 4 wk post MI. Conversely, OGT expression is augmented early, but normalizes by 4 wk post MI. Despite the normalization of OGT expression, O-GlcNAcylation remains elevated, which may be due to chronic OGA suppression. Furthermore, we observed upregulation of miRNA- 539 in HF. In vitro studies confirmed induction of miRNA- 539 negatively regulated OGA expression. These data indicate that suppression <b>of</b> <b>OGA</b> could be mediated by miRNA- 539. Next, we developed a genetic model <b>of</b> cardiomyocyte specific <b>OGA</b> ablation to test whether ablation <b>of</b> <b>OGA</b> would augment O-GlcNAcylation and attenuate HF. Our model successfully suppressed OGA expression, augmented cardiac protein O-GlcNAcylation, and did not induce cardiac dysfunction; however, genetic ablation <b>of</b> <b>OGA</b> prior to coronary ligation hastened cardiac dysfunction within 1 wk compared to wild-type mice. Hearts from OGA KO mice were more dilated and less efficient, which suggests rejection of our hypothesis. These data indicate that OGA expression may be proadaptive during HF. Because O-GlcNAcylation of mitochondrial complexes has been implicated to depress mitochondrial respiration we hypothesized that augmented O-GlcNAcylation may mediate mitochondrial dysfunction and may help explain the exacerbation in cardiac dysfunction we observed after 1 wk of HF. We virally augmented either OGT or OGA in cardiomyocytes to alter overall protein O-GlcNAcylation. Neither overexpression <b>of</b> <b>OGA</b> nor OGT mediated mitochondrial dysfunction. Though induction of O-GlcNAcylation through hyperglycemia did suppress mitochondrial reserve capacity. This depression in mitochondrial function was recapitulated with an osmotic control. We concluded that modulation of O-GlcNAc alone did not cause mitochondrial dysfunction. These data indicate that suppression <b>of</b> <b>OGA</b> occurs during HF and may be mediated by posttranscriptional regulation by miR- 539. In addition, ablation <b>of</b> <b>OGA</b> expression can hasten HF. Furthermore, the exacerbation in cardiac dysfunction is not likely due to O-GlcNAc-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction. These data indicate that chronic augmentation of O-GlcNAcylation may be detrimental in HF. More specifically they indicate that dynamic cycling of O-GlcNAcylation may be more beneficial in HF than permanently driving O-GlcNAc levels in one direction...|$|R

40|$|Emerging {{evidence}} suggests that aberrant O-GlcNAcylation is associated with tumorigenesis. Many oncogenic factors are O-GlcNAcylated, which modulates their functions. However, it remains unclear how O-GlcNAcylation and O-GlcNAc cycling enzymes, O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and O-GlcNAcase (OGA), affect the development of cancer in animal models. In this study, we show that reduced level <b>of</b> <b>OGA</b> attenuates colorectal tumorigenesis induced by Adenomatous polyposis coli (Apc) mutation. The levels of O-GlcNAcylation and O-GlcNAc cycling enzymes were simultaneously upregulated in intestinal adenomas from mice, and in human patients. In two independent microarray data sets, the expression <b>of</b> <b>OGA</b> and OGT {{was significantly associated with}} poor cancer-specific survival of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. In addition, OGA heterozygosity, which results in increased levels of O-GlcNAcylation, attenuated intestinal tumor formation in the Apc min/+ background. Apc min/+ OGA +/-mice exhibited a significantly increased survival rate compared with Apc min/+ mice. Consistent with this, Apc min/+ OGA +/-mice expressed lower levels of Wnt target genes than Apc min/+. However, the knockout <b>of</b> <b>OGA</b> did not affect Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Overall, these findings suggest that OGA is crucial for tumor growth in CRC independently of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. open 2...|$|R
