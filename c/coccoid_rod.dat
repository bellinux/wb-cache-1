40|$|Bordetella, of {{the family}} Alcaligenaceae, is a genus {{containing}} gram-negative <b>coccoid</b> <b>rod</b> species. To date, nine species have been assigned to the genus Bordetella [1]. Human infections caused by B. petrii have seldom been reported since its first de-tection in 2001 [2 - 8]. Among seven reported cases, four were recovered from respiratory specimens [4 - 6, 8], while three were recovered from pus specimens of patients with bone-related in-fections [2, 3, 7]. A 52 -yr-old man without any medical history was admitted to a tertiary-care hospital (Hospital A) in Seoul, Korea, for tibia and fibula fractures of both legs. He had sus-tained a crush injury to both legs on a riverboat in Thailand. He had undergone surgery and subsequently presented with puru-lent discharge from the muscle flap site of the left leg. The wound culture revealed a gram-negative rod identified as Achro-mobacter denitrificans by using a VITEK 2 GNI card (bioMéri-eux, Marcy l’Etoile, France). After a month of managing the ab-scess site, the patient was transferred to another hospital (Hos-pital B) in Ilsan, Korea. At that hospital, deep tissue and bone cultures revealed the presence of Bordetella bronchiseptica and Alcaligenes species, respectively, using MicroScan (Dade Beh-ring, West Sacramento, CA, USA).

40|$|An {{abundant}} and diverse bacterial community was found within brine channels of annual sea ice {{and at the}} ice-seawater interface in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica, in 1980. The mean bacterial standing crop was 1. 4 × 1011 cells m− 2 (9. 8 mg of C m− 2); bacterial concentrations as high as 1. 02 × 1012 cells m− 3 were observed in ice core melt water. Vertical profiles of ice cores 1. 3 to 2. 5 m long showed that 47 % of the bacterial numbers and 93 % of the bacterial biomass were located in the bottom 20 cm of sea ice. Ice bacterial biomass concentration was more than 10 times higher than bacterioplankton from the water column. Scanning electron micrographs showed a variety of morphologically distinct cell types, including <b>coccoid,</b> <b>rod,</b> fusiform, filamentous, and prosthecate forms; dividing cells were commonly observed. Approximately 70 % of the ice bacteria were free-living, whereas 30 % were attached to either living algal cells or detritus. Interactions between ice bacteria and microalgae were suggested by {{a positive correlation between}} bacterial numbers and chlorophyll a content of the ice. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy revealed a close physical association between epibacteria and a dominant ice alga of the genus Amphiprora. We propose that sea ice microbial communities are not only sources of primary production but also sources of secondary microbial production in polar ecosystems.

40|$|International audienceThe {{evidence}} for early {{life and its}} initial evolution on Earth is linked intimately with the geological evolution of the early Earth. The environment of the early Earth would be considered extreme by modern standards: hot (50 – 80 °C), volcanically and hydrothermally active, anoxic, high UV flux, and a high flux of extraterrestrial impacts. Habitats for life were more limited until continent-building processes resulted {{in the formation of}} stable cratons with wide, shallow, continental platforms in the Mid-Late Archaean. Unfortunately there are no records of the first appearance of life and the earliest isotopic indications of the existence of organisms fractionating carbon in ∼ 3. 8 Ga rocks from the Isua greenstone belt in Greenland are tenuous. Well-preserved microfossils and microbial mats (in the form of tabular and domical stromatolites) occur in 3. 5 – 3. 3 Ga, Early Archaean, sedimentary formations from the Barberton (South Africa) and Pilbara (Australia) greenstone belts. They document life forms that show a relatively advanced level of evolution. Microfossil morphology includes filamentous, <b>coccoid,</b> <b>rod</b> and vibroid shapes. Colonial microorganisms formed biofilms and microbial mats at the surfaces of volcaniclastic and chemical sediments, some of which created (small) macroscopic microbialites such as stromatolites. Anoxygenic photosynthesis may already have developed. Carbon, nitrogen and sulphur isotopes ratios are in the range of those for organisms with anaerobic metabolisms, such as methanogenesis, sulphate reduction and photosynthesis. Life was apparently distributed widely in shallow-water to littoral environments, including exposed, evaporitic basins and regions of hydrothermal activity. Biomass in the early Archaean was restricted owing to the limited amount of energy that could be produced by anaerobic metabolisms. Microfossils resembling oxygenic photosynthesisers, such as cyanobacteria, probably first occurred in the later part of the Mid Archaean (∼ 2. 9 Ga), concurrent with the tectonic development of suitable shallow shelf environments. The development of an oxygenic metabolism allowed a considerable increase in biomass and increased interaction with the geological environment...|$|E

Results 40 isolates were obtained from 27 patients during the last 11 years. The patient's median age was 81 (19 - 101) years, 25 (92. 6 %) had underlying diseases and 12 (44. 4 %) had a genitourinary tract pathology.

40|$|The {{faecal flora}} of {{patients}} with Crohn's disease {{has been found to}} differ from that of healthy subjects in that the numbers of anaerobic gramnegative rods and of gram-positive coccoid anaerobes, belonging to species of Eubacterium and Peptostreptococcus were higher. The flora composition was independent of duration of illness and was not influenced by ileocaecal resection. Serum agglutinins against some strains of <b>coccoid</b> <b>rods</b> were found in a considerable percentage {{of patients with}} Crohn's disease, whereas percentages of positive sera were much lower in healthy subjects and in patients with various diseases. The interpretation of these data established by Wensinck {{and the use of the}} agglutination reactions as a diagnostic test are the subject of this thesis. In Chapter 2 recent microbiological and immunological findings in patients with Crohn's disease are reviewed. They show that in Crohn's disease as well as in other intestinal diseases, like ulcerative colitis, antibodies to dietary and microbial antigens are found frequently. In Chapter 3 results are presented of investigations on the prevalence of agglutinins to four strains of anaerobic <b>coccoid</b> <b>rods</b> in patients with Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, a number of other diseases and in healthy subjects. Antibodies to <b>coccoid</b> <b>rods</b> were found much more frequently in Crohn's disease than in ulcerative colitis and other diseases. Using the interpretation of agglutination reactions as described in Chapter 7, the percentage of false positive results of sera submitted for diagnosis was found to be satisfactorily low.

40|$|Periodontitis is an {{inflammatory}} disease of bacterial aetiology that affects all structures supporting and anchoring the tooth. In the adult population, periodontitis represents {{the most frequent}} cause of tooth loss. The microflora in periodontal lesions forms complex, structurally heterogeneous biofilms on the root surface of affected teeth and comprises a multitude of fastidious and as yet uncultured bacteria. Identification of these organisms was only {{made possible by the}} advent of culture-independent DNA-based techniques. Filifactor alocis is a fastidious, Gram-positive rod and was repeatedly detected in patients suffering from chronic periodontitis (CP) and generalized aggressive periodontitis (GAP) in recent years. For the first study of the present dissertation, a species-specific oligonucleotide probe was designed, and dot blot hybridizations were performed to determine the prevalence of F. alocis in a total of 490 subgingival samples from GAP patients, CP patients and periodontitis-resistant (PR) patients. Furthermore, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and subsequent epifluorescence microscopy were used to analyse the spatial distribution and structural arrangement of F. alocis in subgingival biofilms from GAP patients. In the second study, identical methods were employed to determine the prevalence of oral Selenomonas spp., regarded as candidate periodontal pathogens by some authors, in 742 samples from GAP, CP and PR patients. Moreover, the structural arrangement of these organisms in GAP biofilms was studied. F. alocis proved to be an excellent marker organism for periodontal disease. The species could be detected in the majority of CP and GAP patients and had an extremely low prevalence in the PR group. The microscopic analysis of subgingival biofilms from GAP patients suggested an important role of F. alocis in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease. The organism predominantly colonized the depth of periodontal pockets and contributed to numerous bacterial formations that reflect a structural organization of the biofilms. In contrast, the prevalence of Selenomonas spp. was not correlated with periodontal disease. However, FISH and subsequent microscopic analysis of GAP biofilms showed that, at least in some cases, Selenomonas spp. appeared in large numbers and made a relevant contribution to biofilm architecture. In the third study of the present work, biopsies from digital dermatitis (DD) lesions, an ulcerative inflammatory bovine foot disease, were analysed. With the help of FISH, Guggenheimella bovis, a Gram-positive <b>coccoid</b> <b>rod</b> that is only seldom detected in DD-lesions, could be visualized deep inside the tissue as a pioneer organism way ahead of the advancing bacterial front. The present work clearly demonstrates the advantages of a combined epidemiological and microscopic approach for the study of polymicrobial biofilm diseases...|$|E

40|$|AIM [...] To assess prospectively {{the value}} of three {{serological}} tests for differentiating between ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, used either alone or combined. METHODS [...] Coded serum samples from 63 patients with ulcerative colitis and 67 patients with Crohn's disease were analysed. Detection assays {{for the presence of}} perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (pANCA), serum agglutinating antibodies to anaerobic <b>coccoid</b> <b>rods,</b> and specific IgG antibodies against a Kd- 45 / 48 immunological crossreactive mycobacterial antigen complex (ImCrAC) were studied. Sensitivity, specificity, pre- and post-test probabilities, likelihood ratios, and predictive values of each of these serological tests were determined. RESULTS [...] The sensitivity and specificity of the pANCA test for the diagnosis of ulcerative colitis were 61 and 79 %, respectively. The serum agglutination test for anaerobic <b>coccoid</b> <b>rods</b> had a sensitivity of 42 % and a specificity of 89 % for a diagnosis of Crohn's disease. The sensitivity of specific IgG antibodies against Kd- 45 / 48 ImCrAC in diagnosing Crohn's disease was 70 % and specificity 60 %. Although 100 % specificity was achieved by combining all three tests in a small group of patients with Crohn's disease (n = 20), combining two or more tests had no additive clinical value. No correlation was found between the presence of any one of these antibodies and disease activity, duration, or localisation of disease. Surgery or medical treatment did not influence the presence of antibodies or the antibody titre. CONCLUSIONS [...] The value of these tests in the differential diagnosis between ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease is limited, but the high predictive values and specificities of different tests for both diseases suggest that these tests may be of help in studying disease heterogeneity and in defining different subgroups of patients with different pathogenesis...|$|R

The composition of the flora was neither influenced by duration of the disease nor by ileocaecal resection. In healthy subjects and patients, a chemically defined diet induced only slight changes in the flora. Thus, the flora in terminal ileitis although stable was permanently abnormal. In the patients with Crohn's colitis, abnormally low numbers of anaerobes were found in patients with severe, bloody diarrhoea while aerobic counts were normal. The flora in patients with mild colitis was similar to that in terminal ileitis.

The Z. niveum ectosymbiont is only moderately related to previously identified groups of thiotrophic symbionts within the Gammaproteobacteria, and shows highest 16 S rRNA sequence similarity with the free-living sulfur-oxidizing bacterial strain ODIII 6 from shallow-water hydrothermal vents of the Mediterranean Sea (94. 5 %) and an endosymbiont from a deep-sea hydrothermal vent gastropod of the Indian Ocean Ridge (93. 1 %). A replacement of this specific ectosymbiont by a variety of other bacteria was observed only for senescent basal parts of the host colonies.

In the present paper results of the possibility of biosurfactant (Emulsan) production by microorganisms isolated from Iranian oil reservoirs is presented. Fourthy three gram negative and gram positive, non fermentative, rod bacilli and coccobacilli shaped baceria were isolated from the oil wells of Bibi Hakimeh, Siri, Maroon, Ilam, East Paydar and West Paydar.

We found this ciliate species {{to be associated with}} a novel genus of bacteria, here proposed as "Candidatus Navis piranensis" gen. nov., sp. nov. The descriptions of host and symbiont species are based on morphological and ultrastructural studies, the SSU rRNA sequences, and in situ hybridization with symbiont-specific probes. The host is characterized by alternate microzooids on alternate branches arising from a long, common stalk with an adhesive disc. Three different types of zooids are present: microzooids with a bulgy oral side, roundish to ellipsoid macrozooids, and terminal zooids ellipsoid when dividing or bulgy when undividing. The oral ciliature of the microzooids runs 1 ¼ turns in a clockwise direction around the peristomial disc when viewed from inside the cell and runs into the infundibulum, where it makes another ¾ turn. The ciliature consists of a paroral membrane (haplokinety), three adoral membranelles (polykineties), and one stomatogenic kinety (germinal kinety). One circular row of barren kinetosomes is present aborally (trochal band). Phylogenetic analyses placed Z. ignavum sp. nov. within the clade II of the polyphyletic family Zoothamniidae (Oligohymenophorea).

To determine if other bacteria, {{especially those in the}} same phylum (Firmicutes) or with similar coccoid shapes as S.  aureus, might use a similar mechanically driven strategy for DCS, we used high-resolution video microscopy to examine cytokinesis in a phylogenetically wide range of species with various cell shapes and sizes. We found that fast mechanically driven DCS is rather rare in the Firmicutes (low G+C Gram positives), observed only in Staphylococcus and its closest coccoid relatives in the Macrococcus genus, and we did not observe this division strategy among the Gram-negative Proteobacteria. In contrast, several members of the high-G+C Gram-positive phylum Actinobacteria (Micrococcus luteus, Brachybacterium faecium, Corynebacterium glutamicum, and Mycobacterium smegmatis) with diverse shapes ranging from <b>coccoid</b> to <b>rod</b> all undergo fast mechanical DCS during cell division.

40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{characterize}} the topographical distribution and organization of subgingival plaque in periodontally diseased teeth. 26 extracted teeth were fixed and processed for undecalcified histological evaluation. The sections were cut perpendicular to the long axis of the tooth and analyzed by phase-contrast microscopy. The coronal portion of the analyzed roots showed a dense accumulation of filamentous forms, fusiform <b>rods,</b> <b>coccoid</b> forms and loosely aggregated spirochetes. The middle and apical portions showed a non-uniform distribution of the microflora, with microorganisms representing all the known morphotypes. Furthermore, plaque was detected below undisturbed periodontal fibers, indicating that plaque not only forms apically, but also in a lateral direction, penetrating and colonizing below areas where periodontal fibers are inserted into the root surface...|$|R

40|$|A novel gammaproteobacterium, strain CN 3 T, was {{isolated}} from faeces of wild boar. It is facultative anaerobic and appears <b>coccoid</b> or <b>rod</b> shaped. The determined partial 16 S rRNA gene sequence of strain CN 3 T suggests a distant relationship to Enterobacteriales and Pasteurellales. The sequence shows highest similarity of 90. 3 % with Obesumbacterium proteus DSM 2777 T, {{a member of}} the Enterobacteriaceae. The closest relatives outside the Enterobacteriales according to 16 S rRNA gene sequence analysis are members of the Pasteurellales with 88. 7 % similarity (Mannheimia haemolytica NCTC 9380 T and Actinobacillus lignieresii NCTC 4189 T). In contrast to most members of the Enterobacteriales, strain CN 3 T is oxidase-positive. The pattern of fatty acids, in particular the high relative abundance of C 18 : 1 {omega} 7 c (38. 5 %), is clearly distinct from the conserved pattern of Pasteurellales. EcoRI ribotyping of strain CN 3 T yielded no significant similarity to database entries. Major ubiquinone of strain CN 3 T is Q- 8. The DNA G+C content is 36. 4 mol%. CN 3 T hosts a phage and secretes considerable amounts of three proteins into the culture supernatant. A spontaneous mutant of strain CN 3 T {{was isolated}} forming long filaments. Microscopic studies revealed the presence of a capsule which the mutant strain is unable to partition after cell division. CN 3 T (=DSM 22228 T=CCUG 57622 T) is considered as the type strain of a novel species within a new genus, for which the name Orbus hercynius gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed.

One {{of the most frequently}} observed behaviours in the stress-starvation response of gram-negative bacteria is the size reduction and cell morphology conversion from rod to resistant shape-form. In such framework, we report here on morphology (cell volume and cell shape) variations in psychrophilic strain Oleispira antarctica RB 8 T under different growth temperature and different hydrocarbons mixtures sources. Six different hydrocarbons mixtures (car commercial diesel, commercial crude oil engine; 2 different bilge waters, military jet fuel and crude oil) were used as single carbon source and two different cultivation temperatures (4 ° and 15 °C) were tested for 22 days. During incubation period, sub-aliquots of each bacterial culture were processed to estimate total bacterial abundance (DAPI count), variation of cell volume and morphological diversity (determination from digital photomicrographs using an image analysis program). Total bacterial abundance by DAPI staining showed an increase at both temperatures and in almost all substrates used in the first 18 days of experiment; after, values of bacterial abundance by DAPI counts showed a decrement of almost all cultures at both incubation temperatures. Overall, the mean cell volume decreased with increasing of temperature. Three morphological types of bacteria were identified: spiral bacteria (spirillae and curved rods), cocci and rods. The morphological analysis revealed that the spiral bacteria forms changed significantly in <b>coccoid</b> and <b>rods</b> shapes, in relation with the added substrates, except for the bilge waters, where spiral bacteria were mostly the dominant shape. The study of morphological and physiological variation of hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria is a fundamental topic for the study of their potential use in the mitigation of oil spills phenomenon in cold environment...|$|R

It was noted that, in comparison to natural teeth, the subgingival samples from implants were more frequently too small to provide adequate bacterial counts. In 24 partially edentulous patients (with implants and teeth in the same jaw), {{no significant differences in}} the distribution of bacterial morphotypes could be found between implants and natural teeth. The %s of <b>coccoid</b> cells, motile <b>rods,</b> spirochetes and other bacteria were 65. 8, 2. 3, 2. 1, and 29. 8 for implants and 55. 6, 4. 9, 3. 6, and 34. 9 for teeth, respectively. However, when the plaque composition on the implants of fully edentulous patients was compared with those of teeth or implants of partially edentulous patients (with teeth and implants in the same and/or opposite jaw), significant differences appeared. In fully edentulous patients, more coccoid cells (71. 3 %) and significant fewer motile rods (0. 4 %) and spirochetes (0. 0) were found around the implants.

Cells were non-sporulating, non-motile, straight to slightly curved <b>rods.</b> <b>Coccoid</b> bodies and filaments of varying length developed in older cultures. Growth occurred with 0. 5 - 6 % (w/v) NaCl [optimum, 2 - 3 % (w/v) NaCl], at pH 6. 0 - 10. 0 (optimum, pH 7. 0 - 8. 0) and at 10 - 40 degrees C (optimum, 25 - 30 degrees C). The major cellular fatty acids were anteiso-C- 15 : 0, 3 -OH iso-C- 16 : 0 and anteiso-C- 15 : 1 omega 10 c, and menaquinone 6 was the sole respiratory quinone. Non-diffusible carotenoid pigments were produced. Flexirubin pigments were absent. The genomic DNA G+C content was 35. 8 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16 S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain YIM-C 238 (T) should be assigned to the genus Psychroflexus. The sequence similarities between the isolate and the type strains {{of members of the}} genus Psychroflexus were in the range 95. 5 - 97. 0 %.

40|$|A {{new species}} is {{proposed}} for two facultatively methanotrophic {{representatives of the}} genus Methylocystis, strains H 2 sT and S 284, which were isolated from an acidic (pH 4. 3) Sphagnum peat bog lake (Teufelssee, Germany) and an acidic (pH 3. 8) peat bog (European North Russia), respectively. Cells of strains H 2 sT and S 284 are aerobic, Gram-negative, non-motile, curved <b>coccoids</b> or short <b>rods</b> that contain an intracytoplasmic membrane system typical of type II methanotrophs. They possess both a soluble and a particulate methane monooxygenase (MMO); the latter is represented by two isozymes, pMMO 1 and pMMO 2. The preferred growth substrates are methane and methanol. In the absence of C 1 substrates, however, these methanotrophs are capable of slow growth on acetate. Atmospheric nitrogen is fixed {{by means of an}} aero-tolerant nitrogenase. Strains H 2 sT and S 284 develop between pH 4. 2 and 7. 6 (optimum pH 6. 0 - 6. 5), and at temperatures between 8 and 37 °C (optimum 25 - 30 °C). The major fatty acids are C 18 : 1 w 8 c, C 18 : 1 w 7 c, and C 16 : 1 w 7 c; the major quinone is Q- 8. The DNA G+C content is 62. 0 - 62. 3 mol%. Strains H 2 sT and S 284 share identical 16 S rRNA gene sequences, which displayed 96. 6 - 97. 3 % similarity to sequences of other taxonomically characterized members of the genus Methylocystis. Therefore, strains H 2 sT and S 284 are classified as a novel species, for which the name Methylocystis bryophila sp. nov. is proposed. Strain H 2 sT (=DSM 21852 T = VKM B- 2545 T) is the type strain of Methylocystis bryophila. ...|$|R
40|$|Coral disease {{represents}} one of the many challenges facing coral reefs, and is a contributing factor to the overall decline in coral reef health worldwide. An increase in disease frequency, outbreaks and the emergence of new diseases has fuelled much concern over the impact of coral diseases and subsequently prompted research into their possible causes. Our understanding of putative coral pathogens has lagged behind the emergence of coral disease as a major threat to the health of coral reefs. The Great Barrier Reef (GBR) is the largest contiguous reef in the world, and is still regarded as one the healthiest and best managed coral reef ecosystems in existence today. Despite this, the frequency of coral disease has begun to increase sharply over the past decade, prompting researchers to focus on the aetiology, causal factors and ecological impact of coral disease within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP). This PhD thesis focused on two distinct disease elements: brown band (BrB) and white syndrome (WS). These two diseases affect corals within the GBRMP, yet their microbiology and ecology is largely unknown. The research project investigated the microbiology and ecology of WS and BrB affecting acroporids, using culture-dependent and independent methods to characterise the microbial community associated with healthy and diseased corals and identify putative coral pathogens. The lifecycle and diurnal cycles of BrB ciliates were also explored to gain a greater understanding of the effect of these ciliates on coral health. Ecological surveys were carried out at Heron Island sites commonly used for the collection of corals to ascertain the prevalence and significance of these diseases in the context of laboratory results. Surveys at five sites revealed a mean prevalence of 8. 11 % of tabular acroporids affected by WS, which is consistent with previous studies. BrB revealed a much lower prevalence of less than 0. 04 %. Bacterial 16 S rRNA gene clone libraries were constructed from Acropora hyacinthus samples derived from a healthy control colony, and a healthy section and lesion border of a WS affected colony. Distinct shifts in the microbial community and partitioning between the lesion border and healthy section of the diseased colony were observed. In addition, the healthy section of the diseased colony displayed a different microbial community to the control colony, supporting previous data that a microbial shift occurs preceding visible signs of infection. A number of bacteria from the healthy section of diseased coral shared close sequence affiliations to a number of Vibrio spp., including potentially pathogenic Vibrio species. Sequences retrieved from the lesion border of WS affected Acropora hyacinthus were dominated by Pseudoalteromonas spp., although these species have not been previously implicated in coral disease. The coral disease BrB is characterised by the presence of a brown ciliate band and these ciliates have been identified as a new species belonging to the class Oligohymenophorea, subclass Scuticociliatia. Within BrB-affected Acropora muricata, numerous filamentous, <b>coccoid</b> and <b>rod</b> bacteria were observed to be closely associated with the ciliate band, but absent in coral tissue adjacent to the typical brown band. It is unknown whether the bacteria associated with the mass of ciliates are the primary pathogens, a food source for the ciliates or simply opportunistic pathogens. Several isolates retrieved from BrB corals were tested for their pathogenicity in controlled infection trials using Acropora muricata. The preliminary results identified at least two isolates of interest (CC 1 and HB- 8). However, the results of a replicated infection trial failed to conclusively identify the bacteria as the causative agents of this disease. The findings from the cross-infection trials and ecological surveys suggest that BrB is an infectious but not highly contagious coral disease. This study revealed important aspects of both WS and BrB that were previously unknown. The research carried out has built a greater understanding, and a platform for future research directed at understanding key processes involved in these coral diseases. This research has highlighted the need for ongoing infection trials in diseases, even when a pathogen has been identified. The discovery of possible key bacterial species involved in WS and BrB warrants further research aimed at understanding the mechanisms in which bacteria may affect the coral holobiont. In conclusion, this research has further supported the notion that corals are a complex community with bacterial, animal and protistan partners, which when disturbed may see one or several of the previous benign partners becoming pathogenic. In a rapidly changing climate, this conclusion is consistent with the idea that coral diseases are on the rise due to changing environmental circumstances disturbing the balance between these interdependent partners...|$|R
