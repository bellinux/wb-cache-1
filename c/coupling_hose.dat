50|$|Pipes are {{commonly}} joined by welding, using threaded pipe and fittings; sealing {{the connection with}} a pipe thread compound, Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) Thread seal tape, oakum, or PTFE string, or by using a mechanical coupling. Process piping is usually joined by welding using a TIG or MIG process. The most common process pipe joint is the butt weld. The ends of pipe to be welded must have a certain weld preparation called an End Weld Prep (EWP) which is typically at an angle of 37.5 degrees to accommodate the filler weld metal. The most common pipe thread in North America is the National Pipe Thread (NPT) or the Dryseal (NPTF) version. Other pipe threads include the British standard pipe thread (BSPT), the garden hose thread (GHT), and the fire <b>hose</b> <b>coupling</b> (NST).|$|R
40|$|A {{modification}} {{has been}} made in the mating halves of a cam-and-groove <b>hose</b> <b>coupling</b> to prevent rapid separation of the halves in the event that the cam levers are released while the fluid in the hose is pressurized. The need for this modification arises because commercial off-the-shelf cam-and-groove hose-coupling halves do not incorporate safety features to prevent separation in the pressurized state. Especially when the pressurized fluid is compressible (e. g., steam or compressed air), the separated halves can be propelled with considerable energy, causing personal injury and/or property damage. Therefore, one purpose served by the modification is to provide for venting to release compressive energy in a contained and safe manner while preventing personal injury and/or property damage. Another purpose served by the modification, during the process of connecting the coupling halves, is to ensure that the coupling halves are properly aligned before the cam levers can be locked into position...|$|R

40|$|Although {{nonlinear}} water waves {{have been}} the subject of decades of research, there are many problems that remain unsolved, especially in the cases when one or more of the following factors are involved: high-order nonlinear effects, moving boundaries, wavestructure interactions and complicated geometries. In this dissertation, a high-order spectral-element (HOSE) method is developed to investigate problems about nonlinear waves. An exponentially converging algorithm, it is able to be applied to solve nonlinear interactions between waves and submerged or surface-piercing bodies with high-order nonlinear effects. The HOSE method is applied to investigate dynamics of nonlinear waves and their interactions with obstacles. We first implement it to calculate the hydrodynamic forces and moments on a fixed underwater spheroid, with uniform current, different angles of attack and finite water depth included in the study. Extending this study to wave interaction with tethered bodies, we create an efficient simulation capability of moored buoys. <b>Coupling</b> the <b>HOSE</b> method with a robust implicit finite-difference solver of highly-extensible cables, our results show chaotic buoy motions and the ability for short wave generation. We then focus our attention on the free-surface patterns caused by nonlinear wave-wave and wave-body interactions. Starting with a two-dimensional canonical problem about the wave diffraction and radiation of a submerged circular cylinder, numerical evidences are obtained to corroborate that, for a fixed cylinder, a cylinder undergoing forced circular motion, or free to respond to incident waves, the progressive disturbances are in one direction only. The three-dimensional wave-wave interactions are studied. It is proved both analytically and numerically that new propagating waves could be generated by the resonant interactions between Kelvin ship waves and ambient waves. Another consequence of resonant wave-wave interactions is the instability of free-surface waves. In this dissertation, the three-dimensional unstable modes of plane standing waves and standing waves in a circular basin are identified numerically and then confirmed analytically. These investigations cover a large variety of nonlinear-wave problems and prove that the HOSE method is an efficient tool in studying scientific or practical problems. by Qiang Zhu. Thesis (Ph. D.)

I feel {{the power of}} art is derived from its ability to allow otherness to be addressed, encouraging the viewer to engage with topics that are ignored or difficult for them.

During this journey as a woodworker, I have been trying to push the preconceived notions that I have created about the material. It is my goal to attack the boundaries of wood through the incorporation of varying, unconventional materials, as well as the concept of what wood can be used for.
