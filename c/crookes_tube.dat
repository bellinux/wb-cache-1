5|$|Small scale {{can be done}} on a local X-ray tube source, {{typically}} {{coupled with}} an image plate detector. These {{have the advantage of}} being (relatively) inexpensive and easy to maintain, and allow for quick screening and collection of samples. However, the wavelength light produced is limited by anode material, typically copper. Further, intensity is limited by the power applied and cooling capacity available to avoid melting the anode. In such systems, electrons are boiled off of a cathode and accelerated through a strong electric potential of ~50 kV; having reached a high speed, the electrons collide with a metal plate, emitting bremsstrahlung and some strong spectral lines corresponding to the excitation of inner-shell electrons of the metal. The most common metal used is copper, which can be kept cool easily, due to its high thermal conductivity, and which produces strong Kα and Kβ lines. The Kβ line is sometimes suppressed with a thin (~10 µm) nickel foil. The simplest and cheapest variety of sealed X-ray tube has a stationary anode (the <b>Crookes</b> <b>tube)</b> and run with ~2 kW of electron beam power. The more expensive variety has a rotating-anode type source that run with ~14 kW of e-beam power.|$|E
25|$|Thomson {{constructed}} a <b>Crookes</b> <b>tube</b> {{with a better}} vacuum. At {{the start of the}} tube was the cathode from which the rays projected. The rays were sharpened to a beam by two metal slits – the first of these slits doubled as the anode, the second was connected to the earth. The beam then passed between two parallel aluminium plates, which produced an electric field between them when they were connected to a battery. The end of the tube was a large sphere where the beam would impact on the glass, created a glowing patch. Thomson pasted a scale to the surface of this sphere to measure the deflection of the beam. Note that any electron beam would collide with some residual gas atoms within the <b>Crookes</b> <b>tube,</b> thereby ionizing them and producing electrons and ions in the tube (space charge); in previous experiments this space charge electrically screened the externally applied electric field. However, in Thomson's <b>Crookes</b> <b>tube</b> the density of residual atoms was so low that the space charge from the electrons and ions was insufficient to electrically screen the externally applied electric field, which permitted Thomson to successfully observe electrical deflection.|$|E
25|$|In 1876, Eugen Goldstein {{proved that}} {{they came from the}} cathode, and named them cathode rays (Kathodenstrahlen). Both William Crookes (in the 1880s) and German {{physicist}} Johann Hittorf, a co-inventor and early researcher of the <b>Crookes</b> <b>tube,</b> found that paper wrapped photographic plates placed near the tube became unaccountably fogged or flawed by shadows, although they had not been exposed to light. Neither found the cause nor investigated this effect.|$|E
50|$|In 1895, Wilhelm Röntgen {{discovered}} X-rays {{emanating from}} <b>Crookes</b> <b>tubes.</b> The many uses for X-rays were immediately apparent, the first practical application for <b>Crookes</b> <b>tubes.</b>|$|R
50|$|Historically, X-rays were {{discovered}} radiating from experimental discharge <b>tubes</b> called <b>Crookes</b> <b>tubes</b> invented by British physicist William Crookes and others. As {{the medical and}} other uses of X-rays became apparent, workshops began to manufacture specialized <b>Crookes</b> <b>tubes</b> to produce X-rays. These were the first X-ray tubes. These first generation cold cathode or <b>Crookes</b> X-ray <b>tubes</b> were used until the 1920s.|$|R
25|$|The many {{applications}} of X-rays immediately generated enormous interest. Workshops began making specialized versions of <b>Crookes</b> <b>tubes</b> for generating X-rays and these first-generation cold cathode or <b>Crookes</b> X-ray <b>tubes</b> were used until about 1920.|$|R
25|$|Thomson {{constructed}} a <b>Crookes</b> <b>tube</b> with an electrometer set to one side, {{out of the}} direct path of the cathode rays. Thomson could trace {{the path of the}} ray by observing the phosphorescent patch it created where it hit the surface of the tube. Thomson observed that the electrometer registered a charge only when he deflected the cathode ray to it with a magnet. He concluded that the negative charge and the rays were one and the same.|$|E
25|$|Inquiries {{that began}} with the Geissler tube {{continued}} as even better vacuums were produced. The most famous was the evacuated tube used for scientific research by William Crookes. That tube was evacuated by the highly effective mercury vacuum pump created by Hermann Sprengel. Research conducted by Crookes and others ultimately led to the discovery of the electron in 1897 by J. J. Thomson and X-rays in 1895 by Wilhelm Roentgen. But the <b>Crookes</b> <b>tube,</b> as it came to be known, produced little light because the vacuum in it was too good and thus lacked the trace amounts of gas that are needed for electrically stimulated luminescence.|$|E
25|$|There are {{conflicting}} {{accounts of}} his discovery because Röntgen had his lab notes burned after his death, {{but this is}} a likely reconstruction by his biographers: Röntgen was investigating cathode rays from a <b>Crookes</b> <b>tube</b> which he had wrapped in black cardboard so that the visible light from the tube would not interfere, using a fluorescent screen painted with barium platinocyanide. He noticed a faint green glow from the screen, about 1 meter away. Röntgen realized some invisible rays coming from the tube were passing through the cardboard to make the screen glow. He found they could also pass through books and papers on his desk. Röntgen threw himself into investigating these unknown rays systematically. Two months after his initial discovery, he published his paper.|$|E
25|$|X-rays {{were found}} emanating from <b>Crookes</b> <b>tubes,</b> {{experimental}} discharge tubes invented around 1875, by scientists investigating the cathode rays, that is energetic electron beams, that were first {{created in the}} <b>tubes.</b> <b>Crookes</b> <b>tubes</b> created free electrons by ionization of the residual air in the tube by a high DC voltage of anywhere between a few kilovolts and 100 kV. This voltage accelerated the electrons coming from the cathode to a high enough velocity that they created X-rays when they struck the anode or the glass wall of the tube. Many of the early <b>Crookes</b> <b>tubes</b> undoubtedly radiated X-rays, because early researchers noticed effects that were attributable to them, as detailed below. Wilhelm Röntgen {{was the first to}} systematically study them, in 1895.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Crookes</b> <b>tubes</b> {{are cold}} cathode tubes, {{meaning that they}} do not have a heated {{filament}} in them that releases electrons as the later electronic vacuum tubes usually do. Instead, electrons are generated by the ionization of the residual air by a high DC voltage (from a few kilovolts to about 100 kilovolts) applied between the electrodes, usually by an induction coil (a [...] "Ruhmkorff coil"). The <b>Crookes</b> <b>tubes</b> require a small amount of air in them to function, from about 10−6 to 5×10−8 atmosphere (7×10−4 - 4×10−5 torr or 0.1-0.005 pascal).|$|R
50|$|A more {{reliable}} and controllable method of producing cathode rays was investigated by Hittorf and Goldstein, and rediscovered by Thomas Edison in 1880. A cathode {{made of a}} wire filament heated red hot by a separate current passing through it would release electrons into the tube by a process called thermionic emission. The first true electronic vacuum tubes, invented in 1904, used this hot cathode technique, and they superseded <b>Crookes</b> <b>tubes.</b> These tubes didn't need gas in them to work, so they were evacuated to a lower pressure, around 10−9 atm (10−4 Pa). The ionization method of creating cathode rays used in <b>Crookes</b> <b>tubes</b> is today only used in a few specialized gas discharge tubes such as krytrons.|$|R
500|$|The word plasma {{comes from}} the Ancient Greek , meaning [...] "moldable substance" [...] or [...] "jelly", whose usage {{describes}} the behaviour of the ionised atomic nuclei and the electrons within the surrounding region of the plasma. Very simply, each of these nuclei are suspended in a movable sea of electrons. Plasma was first identified in a <b>Crookes</b> <b>tube,</b> and so described by Sir William Crookes in 1879 (he called it [...] "radiant matter"). The nature of this [...] "cathode ray" [...] matter was subsequently identified by British physicist Sir J.J. Thomson in 1897.|$|E
500|$|A <b>Crookes</b> <b>tube</b> is {{a sealed}} glass {{container}} {{in which two}} electrodes are separated by a vacuum. When a voltage is applied across the electrodes, cathode rays are generated, creating a glowing patch where they strike the glass {{at the opposite end}} of the tube. Through experimentation, Thomson discovered that the rays could be deflected by an electric field (in addition to magnetic fields, which was already known). He concluded that these rays, rather than being a form of light, were composed of very light negatively charged particles he called [...] "corpuscles" [...] (they would later be renamed electrons by other scientists). [...] He measured the mass-to-charge ratio and discovered it was 1800 times smaller than that of hydrogen, the smallest atom. [...] These corpuscles were a particle unlike any other previously known.|$|E
2500|$|Starting in 1888, Philipp Lenard, {{a student}} of Heinrich Hertz, {{conducted}} experiments to see whether cathode rays could pass out of the <b>Crookes</b> <b>tube</b> into the air. He built a <b>Crookes</b> <b>tube</b> (later called a [...] "Lenard tube") with a [...] "window" [...] in the end made of thin aluminum, facing the cathode so the cathode rays would strike it. He found that something came through, that would expose photographic plates and cause fluorescence. He measured the penetrating power of these rays through various materials. It {{has been suggested that}} at least some of these [...] "Lenard rays" [...] were actually X-rays.|$|E
50|$|The {{discovery}} of X-rays came from experimenting with <b>Crookes</b> <b>tubes,</b> an early experimental electrical discharge tube invented by English physicist William Crookes around 1869-1875. In 1895, Wilhelm Röntgen discovered X-rays emanating from <b>Crookes</b> <b>tubes</b> {{and the many}} uses for X-rays were immediately apparent. One of the first X-ray photographs {{was made of the}} hand of Röntgen's wife. The image displayed both her wedding ring and bones. On January 18, 1896 an X-ray machine was formally displayed by H.L. Smith. A fully functioning unit was introduced to the public at the 1904 World's Fair by Clarence Dally.|$|R
50|$|The {{technology}} of manipulating electron beams pioneered in <b>Crookes</b> <b>tubes</b> was applied practically {{in the design}} of vacuum tubes, and particularly in the invention of the cathode ray tube by Ferdinand Braun in 1897.|$|R
50|$|The medical {{applications}} of X-rays {{created the first}} practical use for <b>Crookes</b> <b>tubes,</b> and workshops began manufacturing specialized <b>Crookes</b> <b>tubes</b> to generate X-rays, the first X-ray tubes. The anode was made of a heavy metal, usually platinum, which generated more X-rays, and was tilted {{at an angle to}} the cathode, so the X-rays would radiate through the side of the tube. The cathode had a concave spherical surface which focused the electrons into a small spot around 1 mm in diameter on the anode, in order to approximate a point source of X-rays, which gave the sharpest radiographs. These cold cathode type X-ray tubes were used until about 1920, when they were superseded by the hot cathode Coolidge X-ray tube.|$|R
2500|$|In 1894 Nikola Tesla noticed damaged film {{in his lab}} {{that seemed}} to be {{associated}} with <b>Crookes</b> <b>tube</b> experiments and began investigating this radiant energy of [...] "invisible" [...] kinds. After Röntgen identified the X-ray Tesla began making X-ray images of his own using high voltages and tubes of his own design, as well as Crookes tubes.|$|E
2500|$|In February 1896, news {{reached the}} {{scientific}} community in Australia of Wilhelm Röntgen's discovery of a new electromagnetic radiation. Lyle {{was one of several}} scientists within Australia to attempt to recreate Röntgen's experiments. As the equipment did not exist in the university, Lyle was forced to create it himself. He was an expert glassblower, and was able to make and excavate his own <b>Crookes</b> <b>tube</b> to produce practical X-rays.|$|E
2500|$|Cathode rays were {{discovered}} by Johann Hittorf in 1869 in primitive Crookes tubes. He observed that some unknown rays were emitted from the cathode (Negative electrode) which could cast {{shadows on the}} glowing wall of the tube, indicating the rays were traveling in straight lines. In 1890, Arthur Schuster demonstrated cathode rays could be deflected by electric fields, and William Crookes showed they could be deflected by magnetic fields. In 1897, J. J. Thomson succeeded in measuring the mass of cathode rays, showing that they consisted of negatively charged particles smaller than atoms, the first [...] "subatomic particles", which were later named electrons. The earliest version of the CRT {{was known as the}} [...] "Braun tube", invented by the German physicist Ferdinand Braun in 1897. It was a cold-cathode diode, a modification of the <b>Crookes</b> <b>tube</b> with a phosphor-coated screen.|$|E
5000|$|German {{physicist}} Wilhelm Röntgen {{is usually}} credited as the discoverer of X-rays in 1895, {{because he was}} the first to systematically study them, though he is not the first to have observed their effects. He is also the one who gave them the name [...] "X-rays" [...] (signifying an unknown quantity) though many others referred to these as [...] "Röntgen rays" [...] (and the associated X-ray radiograms as, [...] "Röntgenograms") for several decades after their discovery and even to this day in some languages, including Röntgen's native German.X-rays were found emanating from <b>Crookes</b> <b>tubes,</b> experimental discharge tubes invented around 1875, by scientists investigating the cathode rays, that is energetic electron beams, that were first created in the <b>tubes.</b> <b>Crookes</b> <b>tubes</b> created free electrons by ionization of the residual air in the tube by a high DC voltage of anywhere between a few kilovolts and 100 kV.

50|$|The gas {{ionization}} (or cold cathode) {{method of}} producing cathode rays used in <b>Crookes</b> <b>tubes</b> was unreliable, because it {{depended on the}} pressure of the residual air in the tube. Over time, the air was absorbed by the walls of the tube, and it stopped working.|$|R
25|$|While {{supporters}} of the aetherial theory accepted the possibility that negatively charged particles are produced in <b>Crookes</b> <b>tubes,</b> they believed {{that they are a}} mere by-product and that the cathode rays themselves are immaterial. Thomson set out to investigate whether or not he could actually separate the charge from the rays.|$|R
2500|$|In 1897, J. J. Thomson, an English physicist, in {{his three}} famous {{experiments}} {{was able to}} deflect cathode rays, a fundamental function of the modern Cathode Ray Tube (CRT).

It was a cold-cathode diode, a modification of the <b>Crookes</b> <b>tube</b> with a phosphor-coated screen.A cathode ray tube was successfully demonstrated as a displaying device by the German Professor Max Dieckmann in 1906, his experimental results were published by the journal Scientific American in 1909. In 1908 Alan Archibald Campbell-Swinton, fellow of the Royal Society (UK), published a letter in the scientific journal Nature in which he described how [...] "distant electric vision" [...] could be achieved by using a cathode ray tube (or [...] "Braun" [...] tube) as both a transmitting and receiving device. He expanded on his vision in a speech given in London in 1911 and reported in The Times and the Journal of the Röntgen Society. In a letter to Nature published in October 1926, Campbell-Swinton also announced the results of some [...] "not very successful experiments" [...] he had conducted with G. M. Minchin and J. C. M. Stanton. They had attempted to generate an electrical signal by projecting an image onto a selenium-coated metal plate that was simultaneously scanned by a cathode ray beam. These experiments were conducted before March 1914, when Minchin died. They were later repeated in 1937 by two different teams, H. Miller and J. W. Strange from EMI, and H. Iams and A. Rose from RCA. Both teams succeeded in transmitting [...] "very faint" [...] images with the original Campbell-Swinton's selenium-coated plate. Although others had experimented with using a cathode ray tube as a receiver, the concept of using one as a transmitter was novel. The first cathode ray tube to use a hot cathode was developed by John B. Johnson (who gave his name to the term Johnson noise) and Harry Weiner Weinhart of Western Electric, and became a commercial product in 1922.|$|E
50|$|Wilhelm Röntgen {{discovered}} X-rays {{using the}} <b>Crookes</b> <b>tube</b> in 1895. The term <b>Crookes</b> <b>tube</b> {{is also used}} for the first generation, cold cathode X-ray tubes, which evolved from the experimental Crookes tubes and were used until about 1920.|$|E

50|$|An anode ray (also {{positive}} ray or canal ray) is a beam {{of positive}} ions that is created by certain types of gas discharge tubes.

50|$|In {{the mid-nineteenth}} century, Julius Plücker {{investigated}} the light emitted in discharge <b>tubes</b> (<b>Crookes</b> <b>tubes)</b> {{and the influence}} of magnetic fields on the glow.

50|$|What was {{happening}} was that as more air was pumped {{out of the}} tube, there were fewer gas molecules to obstruct {{the motion of the}} electrons from the cathode, so they could travel a longer distance, on average, before they struck one. By the time the inside of the tube became dark, they were able to travel in straight lines from the cathode to the anode, without a collision. They were accelerated to a high velocity by the electric field between the electrodes, both because they did not lose energy to collisions, and also because <b>Crookes</b> <b>tubes</b> were operated at a higher voltage. By the time they reached the anode end of the tube, they were going so fast that many flew past the anode and hit the glass wall. The electrons themselves were invisible, but when they hit the glass walls of the tube they excited the atoms in the glass, making them give off light or fluoresce, usually yellow-green. Later experimenters painted the back wall of <b>Crookes</b> <b>tubes</b> with fluorescent paint, to make the beams more visible.|$|R
