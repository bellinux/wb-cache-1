He departed from his command of Fort Yamhill, Oregon, by way of San Francisco, across the Isthmus of Panama, and through New York City to home in Somerset for a brief leave. On {{the way to his}} new post, he made a courtesy call to Maj. Gen. Henry W. Halleck in St. Louis, who commandeered his services to audit the financial records of his immediate predecessor, Maj. Gen. John C. Frémont, whose administration of the Department of the Missouri was tainted by <b>charges</b> <b>of</b> wasteful <b>expenditures</b> and fraud that left the status of $12 million in debt. Sheridan sorted out the mess, impressing Halleck in the process. Much to Sheridan's dismay, Halleck's vision for Sheridan consisted of a continuing role as a staff officer. Nevertheless, Sheridan performed the task assigned to him and entrenched himself as an excellent staff officer in Halleck's view.|$|R
25|$|The CCF was {{committed}} to efficiency-oriented planning. Douglas set up an Economic Advisory and Planning Board (EAPB), a cabinet committee with a supporting secretariat, charged with planning economic development strategies for the province and evaluating overall policies and programs. The EAPB evolved into two new agencies: the Budget Bureau and the Government Finance Office. The former was the secretariat for the Treasury Board, the committee <b>of</b> cabinet in <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> allocating budgetary <b>expenditures.</b> In addition, the Budget Bureau had an Organization and Methods unit, which surveyed the operations of various government departments and made recommendations on how they could be managed more effectively. Budgeting became more than the mechanical exercise of allocating money; it became the meeting point of the decision-making process, where all the Douglas government's diverse priorities were integrated.|$|R
50|$|In early 1970, {{the mysterious}} murder of Acap Okoya, the sole rival to Amin among the senior {{military}} officers, led Obote to grow suspicious of Amin. Later that year, Obote escaped another assassination attempt after the attackers mistakenly targeted {{the car of}} the vice-president. However, Obote could take no direct action as he was totally reliant upon the army that Amin led {{to keep him in}} power. In response, Obote increased the recruitment of ethnic Acholi and Langi to counter the recruitment by Amin of soldiers from his home West Nile sub-region. In October 1970, Obote put Amin under house arrest on <b>charges</b> <b>of</b> increasing military <b>expenditure</b> over budget, as well as continuing to support Sudan's Anyanya rebel group in the civil war against the government of Gaafar Nimeiry, after Obote had decided to switch his support to Nimeiry. Amin was close friends with several Israeli military advisors that were helping to train the army and there is much speculation that they had influenced him to continue supporting the Anyanya, which was also the recipient of Israeli military aid.|$|R

40|$|Evolutionarily stable {{strategy}} models {{suggest that}} biparental care will be stable when parents partially compensate {{for changes in}} care by the other parent Previous work has emphasized the relationship between parental expenditure and the current component of fitness (e. g., offspring survival and fecundity) in causing partial compensation. This study shows that partial compensation depends critically on the effect <b>of</b> current parental <b>expenditure</b> on a parent's future fitness (e. g., survival to and fecundity in subsequent breeding seasons). Partial compensation is favored and biparental care is stable when future fitness is a concave-down function <b>of</b> <b>expenditure</b> (i. e., each increment <b>of</b> <b>expenditure</b> is more costly than the previous). However, when future fitness is a convex-down function <b>of</b> <b>expenditure</b> (i. e., each increment <b>of</b> <b>expenditure</b> is less costly) biparental care is unstable.
