While the group explores numerous Christian doctrines and life struggles, every song ties in with the album's theme of the sinfulness and total depravity of humanity, and the endless mercy and grace of God toward sinners and the hope that Christians <b>can</b> <b>find</b> <b>in</b> God.|$|E
25|$|Fr. Pedro Arrupe grew in his {{understanding}} of the world, its struggles for justice and peace, and the way God continued to call people to be involved in this world. Students in the Arrupe program <b>can</b> <b>find</b> <b>in</b> his life a paradigm for their own growth, to be unafraid to be challenged, to learn from cultures not their own, and to gauge their growth not in terms of how much they possess but in terms of how much they can give.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{evidence}} that I <b>can</b> <b>find</b> <b>in</b> Being and Event that the author really understands what he is talking about when he invokes (as he constantly does) Georg Cantor's theory of transfinite cardinals, the axioms of set theory, Gödel's incompleteness proof or Paul Cohen's proof of the independence of the continuum hypothesis. When these things appear in Badiou's texts it is always allusively, with fragments of symbolism detached from the context that endows them with sense, and often with free variables and bound variables colliding randomly. No proof is clearly stated or examined, and the jargon of set theory is waved like a magician's wand, to give authority to bursts of all but unintelligible metaphysics.|$|E

25|$|The {{introduction}} {{of this new}} style coincides with the advance of the Reconquista {{to the south and}} the development of recent Portuguese independence and its territorial changes, reflecting this war paradigm and the need for defense profoundly engraved in the specific kind of Romanesque art we <b>can</b> <b>find</b> <b>in</b> Portugal: thick and menacing crenelated walls, towers, use of battlements, merlons, narrow slits and decorative austerity, like the church of Travanca Monastery with its heavy tower, the Monastery of Cete, the Church of Airães, São Martinho de Mouros, Paço de Sousa Monastery and the Monastery of Rates, one of the most artistically diverse. Almost every religious building has a fortress-like design because in the absence of castles, churches were always considered the best fortresses.|$|E
25|$|The early Romantic composers {{had a major}} {{influence}} on Brahms, particularly Schumann, who encouraged Brahms as a young composer. During his stay in Vienna in 1862–63, Brahms became particularly interested in the music of Franz Schubert. The latter's influence may be identified in works by Brahms dating from the period, such as the two piano quartets Op.25 and Op.26, and the Piano Quintet which alludes to Schubert's String Quintet and Grand Duo for piano four hands. The influence of Chopin and Mendelssohn on Brahms is less obvious, although occasionally one <b>can</b> <b>find</b> <b>in</b> his works what seems to be an allusion to one of theirs (for example, Brahms's Scherzo, Op.4, alludes to Chopin's Scherzo in B-flat minor; the scherzo movement in Brahms's Piano Sonata in F minor, Op.5, alludes to the finale of Mendelssohn's Piano Trio in C minor).|$|E
25|$|In Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World (1978), Girard {{develops}} {{the implications of}} this discovery. The victimary process is the missing link between the animal world and the human world, the principle that explains the humanization of primates. It allows us to understand the need for sacrificial victims, which in turn explains the hunt which is primitively ritual, and the domestication of animals as a fortuitous result of the acclimatization of a reserve of victims, or agriculture. It shows that at the beginning of all culture is archaic religion, which Durkheim had sensed. The elaboration of the rites and taboos by proto-human or human groups would take infinitely varied forms while obeying a rigorous practical sense that we can detect: the prevention of the return of the mimetic crisis. So we <b>can</b> <b>find</b> <b>in</b> archaic religion the origin of all political or cultural institutions.|$|E

The film was screened at many festivals including 2010 Toronto International Film Festival, 67th Venice International Film Festival, Indian Film Festival of Los Angeles and the London Indian Film Festival. Shot in thirteen days, {{the film was}} released on September 2011. Roger Ebert gave it 3.5 out of 4 stars, praising the character-driven film and the portrayal of its lead alongside the city compared to most Hindi films: [...] " [...] a film like this provides a radically different view of India than you <b>can</b> <b>find</b> <b>in</b> the pleasures and excesses of Bollywood".|$|E
500|$|The final {{appearance}} of Jasmine consequently inspired {{the studio to}} redesign Aladdin accordingly because Katzenberg felt that the main character, who was originally depicted as a younger, [...] "scrawny" [...] underdog, did not resemble a suitable leading man for Jasmine, which they feared would result in unconvincing chemistry between the couple. Thus, they ultimately decided to base Aladdin on actor Tom Cruise instead. Henn's favorite sequence to animate was the scene in which Jasmine discovers Aladdin's true identity and gives him [...] "a look". The filmmakers decided to dress Jasmine in blue to symbolically represent water, which is [...] "the most precious substance one <b>can</b> <b>find</b> <b>in</b> a desert". The animators sat the character next to a fountain when she is first introduced in the film to further emphasize this motif and comparison. With her appearance finalized, Jasmine became Disney's first non-white princess {{as opposed to being}} of European heritage.|$|E

2500|$|An {{important}} aspect of Johnson's singing was his use of microtonality. These subtle inflections of pitch help explain why his singing conveys such powerful emotion.

[...] In two takes of [...] "Me and the Devil Blues" [...] he shows {{a high degree of}} precision in the complex vocal delivery of the last verse: [...] "The range of tone he can pack into a few lines is astonishing." [...] The song's [...] "hip humor and sophistication" [...] is often overlooked. [...] "enerations of blues writers in search of wild Delta primitivism," [...] wrote Wald, have been inclined to overlook or undervalue aspects that show Johnson as a polished professional performer.|$|E
