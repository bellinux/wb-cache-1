40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to review {{educational}} objectives for <b>conducting</b> classes for the undergraduate through the doctoral degree. This included one hundred and seventy-three behavioral objectives and three basic methods of evaluation. Specific <b>conducting</b> textbooks were reviewed as were the conclusions from related research. Articles relating to the preparation of the conductor and <b>conducting</b> curricula were also reviewed. The survey instrument designed for this dissertation was mailed to teachers of <b>conducting</b> at the eighteen selected schools where programs were commensurate with this study. FindingsConducting textbooks are used most frequently at the undergraduate level. Equipment most frequently used for evaluation are the tape recorder and videotape (VTR). Compositions of Bach are most frequently used in <b>conducting</b> classes followed by Mozart, Beethoven, Haydn and Handel. Music of Schubert, Tschaikovsky, Brahms, Holst, and Stravinsky are also used frequently. Most teachers provide practical <b>conducting</b> experiences daily or weekly but opportunities to <b>conduct</b> live ensembles are still relatively scarce for undergraduates. All teachers teach <b>conducting</b> techniques and score analysis and memory. Seventy-six percent of the respondents also teach rehearsal techniques. Visual observation of <b>conducting</b> students is the most frequently used method of evaluation. Teachers feel there should be more classes, more class meetings, and a greater variety of <b>conducting</b> classes required [...] especially at the undergraduate level. ConclusionsEducational objectives should be clearly stated for <b>conducting</b> courses at all levels. Evaluation of <b>conducting</b> students should be provided in a variety of forms that are clear and meaningful to the student and be based on stated educational objectives. <b>Conducting</b> courses should be developed for opera, ballet, theater, oratorios, and jazz ensembles.

40|$|Abstract: Over {{the past}} few years, a number of {{computer-based}} orchestral <b>conducting</b> systems have been designed and implemented. However, {{only a few of}} them have been developed to help a user learn and practice musical <b>conducting</b> gestures. This paper is intended to address research related to this area. It utilizes an infrared baton and an acceleration sensor to track the standard <b>conducting</b> gestures. The infrared baton is similar to a <b>conducting</b> baton and has little influence on the <b>conducting.</b> A drill and practice instructional strategy has been applied in this gestural interface. Five options are implemented. Once an option is chosen, users must <b>conduct</b> according to the supported <b>conducting</b> gestures. While a student is <b>conducting,</b> his/her gestures are identified and followed by the system using an accurate and relatively simple process. The <b>conducting</b> is interpreted using a few visual items that clearly show a <b>conducting</b> gesture and reveal its quality. In addition, aural representation informs students of beats or errors when eyes are busy. ...|$|R
