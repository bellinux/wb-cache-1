5|$|On {{a longer}} timescale, animals like the Arctic hare, Arctic fox, stoat, and rock {{ptarmigan}} have snow camouflage, <b>changing</b> <b>their</b> coat colour (by moulting and growing new fur or feathers) from brown or grey {{in the summer}} to white in the winter; the Arctic fox is the only species in the dog family to do so. However, Arctic hares which live in the far north of Canada, where summer is very short, remain white year-round.|$|E

5|$|Race {{stewards}} initially {{imposed a}} 10-place penalty on Coulthard and Barrichello, for <b>changing</b> <b>their</b> engines prior to qualification. Since 2006, the engines of Formula One cars {{are required to}} last for two races. However, after further investigation they rescinded Coulthard's penalty, as he had retired from the previous race and his change had been made {{before the start of}} the race weekend. Barrichello's penalty stood.|$|E
5|$|Troops {{are divided}} into five classes: Scouts, Shocktroopers, Engineers, Lancers and Armored Soldier. Troopers can switch classes by <b>changing</b> <b>their</b> {{assigned}} weapon. Changing class does not greatly affect the stats gained while in a previous class. With victory in battle, experience points are awarded to the squad, which are distributed into five different attributes shared by the entire squad, a feature differing from early games' method of distributing to different unit types.|$|E
5|$|A {{clash between}} local Torajan {{leaders and the}} South Sulawesi provincial {{government}} (as a tourist developer) broke out in 1985. The government designated 18 Toraja villages and burial sites as traditional tourist attractions. Consequently, zoning restrictions were applied to these areas, such that Torajans themselves were barred from <b>changing</b> <b>their</b> tongkonans and burial sites. The plan was opposed by some Torajan leaders, as they felt that their rituals and traditions were being determined by outsiders. As a result, in 1987, the Torajan village of Kété Kesú and several other designated tourist attractions closed their doors to tourists. This closure lasted only a few days, as the villagers found it too difficult to survive without the income from selling souvenirs.|$|E

5|$|A common {{claim of}} creationists is that {{evolution}} {{has never been}} observed. Challenges to such objections often come down to debates over how evolution is defined (see the Defining evolution section above). Under the conventional biological definition of evolution, {{it is a simple}} matter to observe evolution occurring. Evolutionary processes, in the form of populations <b>changing</b> <b>their</b> genetic composition from generation to generation, have been observed in different scientific contexts, including the evolution of fruit flies, mice, and bacteria in the laboratory, and of tilapia in the field. Such studies on experimental evolution, particularly those using microorganisms, are now providing important insights into how evolution occurs, {{especially in the case of}} antibiotic resistance.|$|E

Also while on the plane, Ziva explains her rationale for <b>changing</b> <b>their</b> destination: her father had told her to convert all funds to diamonds with a dealer in Berlin should she ever need to go into hiding. She assumes {{that he would have}} given Bodnar, who he viewed as a son, the same advice.|$|E
5|$|By 1978, {{the band}} had allowed McPherson to return, after filling in {{temporarily}} for Hasler (who {{had taken over}} vocals when McPherson was removed). Thompson returned after patching things up with Barson. Drummer Daniel Woodgate (Woody) and bass player Mark Bedford (Bedders) also joined the band, replacing Garry Dovey and Rodgers, respectively. After briefly <b>changing</b> <b>their</b> name to Morris and the Minors, the band renamed itself as Madness in 1979, paying homage {{to one of their}} favourite songs by ska/reggae artist Prince Buster. The band remained a sextet until late 1979, when Chas Smash rejoined and officially became the seventh member of Madness as a backing vocalist and dancer.|$|E

5|$|Freedom fries was a {{political}} euphemism for French fries in the United States. The term came to prominence in 2003 when the then Republican Chairman of the Committee on House Administration, Bob Ney, renamed the menu item in three Congressional cafeterias in response to France's opposition to the proposed invasion of Iraq. Although originally supported with several restaurants <b>changing</b> <b>their</b> menus as well, the term fell out of use due to declining support for the Iraq War. Following Ney's resignation as Chairman in 2006, it was quietly reverted.|$|E
5|$|In 1990 the March {{team was}} sold, and {{became known as}} Leyton House. Gugelmin was once again partnered by Capelli, but the team's CG901 chassis proved {{troublesome}} and between them they failed to qualify six times, including at the Mexican Grand Prix. However, at the next race, the French Grand Prix, modifications {{had been made to}} the car which improved the performance. Running the whole race without <b>changing</b> <b>their</b> tyres, Capelli and Gugelmin ran first and second during the race. Gugelmin retired mid-race with engine problems and Capelli was passed by Alain Prost for the lead late in the race. Gugelmin also scored a point for finishing sixth in Belgium.|$|E

The game is presented from a first-person perspective, with pre-rendered backgrounds and 2D character portraits accompanying the text. The visuals mostly consist of still images, but with characters often <b>changing</b> <b>their</b> expression while talking.|$|E
5|$|The discography of Iced Earth, an American {{heavy metal}} band, {{consists}} of twelve studio releases, two live albums, three compilations, five singles, three videos, and ten music videos. Originally formed as Purgatory by guitarist Jon Schaffer on January 20, 1985, the band {{spent five years}} playing live locally and went through several line-up changes. After <b>changing</b> <b>their</b> name to Iced Earth, the band recorded the demo Enter the Realm(1989), which landed them {{a deal with the}} German label, Century Media Records. One year later, the band recorded their self-titled album Iced Earth, followed by 1991's Night of the Stormrider, which peaked at number60 on the Japanese Oricon charts. Three years later, Iced Earth released Burnt Offerings, featuring new vocalist Matthew Barlow, followed by The Dark Saga(1996).|$|E
5|$|The duo of Hardcastle and Cage {{were known}} as Hard Impact before <b>changing</b> <b>their</b> name to The Suicide Blondes. They also worked in Japan under the name The Canadian Rockers. Copeland also {{wrestled}} briefly as Damon Striker against Kevin Sullivan and Meng on separate episodes of WCW Pro. In the summer of 1995, he worked a show in Ajax, Ontario, where Bret Hart's business manager, Carl De Marco, was watching. Impressed, he suggested Copeland send an audition tape to the WWF. Copeland did not hear back from WWF, but some time later, De Marco was appointed President of WWF Canada and told Copeland that he'd put in a good word.|$|E

5|$|The {{planetary}} {{exploration of}} the original Mass Effect was completely revamped. Instead of having large barren landscapes, the designers opted to build distinct and interesting places. The goal was to encourage players to keep exploring the galaxy by <b>changing</b> <b>their</b> expectations about what they could find. Originally, developers experimented {{with the idea of}} having a vehicle that could be used to navigate the planetary terrain in a more flexible way than in the original title. However, the vehicle was ultimately removed from the final build of the game. The context-sensitive interrupt system, which was originally meant to be a feature in the original Mass Effect, was introduced in Mass Effect 2 to help blend the dialogue better with the rest of the action.|$|E
5|$|Born {{and raised}} in Los Angeles, California, Levine began his musical career in 1994, when he co-founded the {{alternative}} rock band Kara's Flowers, {{of which he was}} the lead vocalist and guitarist. The band split up after their only album, The Fourth World (released in 1997), which did not gain popularity. In 2001, the group was reformed – with guitarist James Valentine joining the line-up – and began a new musical chapter, <b>changing</b> <b>their</b> name to Maroon 5. In 2002, the band released their first album, Songs About Jane, which went multi-platinum in the US. Since then, they have released five more albums: It Won't Be Soon Before Long (2007), Hands All Over (2010), Overexposed (2012), V (2014) and Red Pill Blues (2017). As part of Maroon 5, Levine has received three Grammy Awards, two Billboard Music Awards, two American Music Awards, an MTV Video Music Award and a World Music Award.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage {{is the use}} of any {{combination}} of materials, coloration, or illumination for concealment, either by making animals or objects hard to see (crypsis), or by disguising them as something else (mimesis). Examples include the leopard's spotted coat, the battledress of a modern soldier, and the leaf-mimic katydid's wings. A third approach, motion dazzle, confuses the observer with a conspicuous pattern, making the object visible but momentarily harder to locate. The majority of camouflage methods aim for crypsis, often through a general resemblance to the background, high contrast disruptive coloration, eliminating shadow, and countershading. In the open ocean, where there is no background, the principal methods of camouflage are transparency, silvering, and countershading, while the ability to produce light is among other things used for counter-illumination on the undersides of cephalopods such as squid. Some animals, such as chameleons and octopuses, are capable of actively <b>changing</b> <b>their</b> skin pattern and colours, whether for camouflage or for signalling.|$|E
