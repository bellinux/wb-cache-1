Decreasing lot sizes, shorter lead times, lower inventories are all characteristics of lean production systems. A good <b>changeover</b> performance of <b>the</b> manufacturing equipment is a key enabler for this. In reality machine designs are not always made with a fast changeover capability in mind. So, production people are often forced to use IE techniques such as SMED (Single Minute Exchange of Die) to address this problem and reduce changeover times after equipment is put on the shop floor. There is clearly a need to incorporate fast <b>changeover</b> capabilities into <b>the</b> design of equipment. An initial set of guidelines has been established.

However, adapting to {{change is not}} always easy, where organizations may experience obstacles and resistance along the way.

Therefore, the aim of the research is to investigate what advantages that can be obtained by implementing a certain change initiative. Furthermore, to determine where resistance occurs and how to eliminate or reduce them. The change initiative in this research is implemented by conducting a case study in a Small Medium Enterprise (SMEs), where the main goal is to reduce <b>the</b> <b>changeover</b> <b>time</b> of a machine, by finding improvement suggestions using the Single Minute Exchange of Die (SMED) methodology.

However, the evidence tells a story where the organization could experience obstacles during the implementation of the improvement suggestions, due to several factors. Surprisingly, the evidence points out that one root problem for resistance is difficulties of describing the underlying reason of the change initiative to the blue-collars.

40|$|This study {{addresses}} {{the question of}} whether the price adjustment process in Austria has changed since <b>the</b> <b>changeover</b> to euro notes and coins at the beginning of 2002. For this purpose, we analyze the frequency and size of price adjustments, sectoral and seasonal differences as well as the structure of prices (notably the share of attractive prices) on the basis of micro price observations underlying the Austrian Consumer Price Index (CPI). A data set spanning the period from 1996 to mid- 2006 was used for the analysis. In addition to confirming known results from previous studies – i. e. that price adjustments occur roughly once per year on average, but with strong sectoral differences – our study reveals an unchanged seasonal pattern of price adjustments, with major peaks in January, also after <b>the</b> cash <b>changeover.</b> At <b>the</b> <b>time</b> of <b>the</b> <b>changeover</b> itself, <b>the</b> observed price changes were more frequent but smaller than usual. As upward and downward price adjustments were also roughly balanced, <b>the</b> cash <b>changeover</b> appears to have had no significant overall inflationary effects, confirming previous studies. The share of attractive prices (i. e. prices ending in 9 or 90, and even prices), which was over 60 % before <b>the</b> cash <b>changeover,</b> plummeted to just over 20 % in early 2002. In the course of the ensuing three to four years, however, this share again approached the level observed prior to the transition.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new mixed integer linear program (MILP) for the optimal short-term scheduling of single stage batch plants with sequence dependent changeovers and optimal {{selection of the}} number of batches to produce. It is a continuous-time formulation employing multiple time grids that is based on the resource-task network (RTN) process representation. The main novelty is that aggregated processing and changeover tasks are considered that account for <b>the</b> <b>time</b> required to produce all batches of the product, plus <b>the</b> <b>changeover</b> <b>time</b> to <b>the</b> next product in the sequence. When compared to the traditional approach of considering a single processing task per batch, fewer event points are needed, which results in significantly lower computational effort as illustrated through the solution of several example problems. The new formulation is further compared to a continuous-time model with global precedence sequencing variables to a bounding model with immediate precedence sequencing variables and to a constraint programming model...|$|R
40|$|The setup {{problem is}} the {{following}} single-machine scheduling problem: There are n jobs with individual processing times, arbitrary precedence relations and sequence-dependent setup costs (or <b>changeover</b> <b>times).</b> <b>The</b> setup cost sef arises in a schedule if job f is processed immediately after job e, e. g., the machine must be cleaned of e and prepared for f. The goal {{is to find a}} schedule minimizing the total setup costs (and thus, for <b>changeover</b> <b>times,</b> <b>the</b> makespan). We consider the case of "precedence-induced" setup costs where a nonzero term sef occurs only if e and f are unrelated with respect to the precedence relations. Moreover, we assume that the setup costs depend only on f, i. e., sef = sf for all e which are unrelated to f. Two special cases of the setup problem with precedence-induced setup costs are the jump numberproblem and the bump number problem. We suggest a new polyhedral model for the precedence-induced setup problem. To every linear extension L = e 1 e 2 en [...] . of a poset P = (P 1 <) with n elements, we associate a 0, 1 -vector x L in R P with xe L = 1 if and only if e starts a chain in L (e = e 1 or e = ei+ 1 | ei). The setup polytope S is the convex hull of the incidence vectors of all linear extensions of P. For N-sparse posets P, i. e., posets whose comparability graph is P 4 -sparse, we give a complete linear description of S.

The purpose of the study is to designing a new materials supply process of surgical material for the operation clinic at Uddevalla hospital which enables for decreased <b>changeover</b> <b>time</b> between surgeries. <b>The</b> study is conducted at Uddevalla hospital, a hospital which provides elective patient care. The flow of surgical material towards the part of the operation clinic that performs hip surgery is investigated. In order to map out the flow of surgical material towards the operation clinic, the project team follows the material from contamination during surgery, to it being back in the operation clinic storage, sterilised and packed. Data is collected through literature search, and a combination of structured observations and semi-structured interviews at Uddevalla hospital, NÄL hospital, and Mölndal hospital. During the data collection and the description of the current situation at Uddevalla hospital, it is made clear that material handling activities take place at the operation clinic which could be performed elsewhere by other personnel. Further, handling of separate disposable articles is identified as <b>time</b> consuming, and <b>the</b> operation table setting is appointed as the activity that effect <b>the</b> <b>changeover</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> most. A new materials supply process is suggested in which the activities operation cart packing and disinfection are externalised from <b>the</b> <b>changeover</b> process at <b>the</b> operation clinic to the central sterilisation department. Further, the project team recommends the introduction of operation table setting rooms. The project team also suggests the introduction of procedure packs, which are packages in which all disposable material needed for a type of surgery are combined in a single package.
