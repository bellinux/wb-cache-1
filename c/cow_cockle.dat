40|$|<b>Cow</b> <b>cockle</b> (Vaccaria hispanica (Mill.) Rauschert) is an {{important}} medicinal weed. Its therapeutic properties are due to present of triterpenoid saponins. Large potential exists to use <b>cow</b> <b>cockle</b> as source of pharmaceutical products or as medicinal plant. <b>Cow</b> <b>cockle</b> seedlings are very cold tolerance. A limiting factor in <b>cow</b> <b>cockle</b> production is weed interference. <b>Cow</b> <b>cockle</b> crop can tolerate clethodim and isoxaflutole herbicides. <b>Cow</b> <b>cockle</b> responds strongly to nitrogen fertilization. Harvest occurred 90 - 100 days after sowing. Moreover, {{a number of different}} genotypes are available. The wild populations from different geographical regions constitute a gene pool that can be utilized for the improvement of <b>cow</b> <b>cockle</b> crop. The basic objective of breeding in <b>cow</b> <b>cockle</b> is the development of a variety with high saponin content. (C) 2012 Elsevier By. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|<b>Cow</b> <b>cockle</b> (Vaccaria hispanica [P. Mill. ] Rauschert) is {{a summer}} annual species {{introduced}} to North America from Europe. It {{has been investigated}} as a potential crop for the Canadian prairies because of its ultra–fine starch, cyclo–peptides, and saponins. However, <b>cow</b> <b>cockle</b> {{has a long history}} of being a weed in Canada and may need additional scrutiny of its weediness potential before initiating commercial production. In addition, cultivating poorly domesticated species may lead to further environmental and weed management risks; hence, an understanding of the domestication status is required. The objectives of this research were to evaluate available <b>cow</b> <b>cockle</b> germplasm i) to identify populations that are best adapted to cultivation as well as the traits responsible for such adaptation, ii) to determine seed dormancy levels in <b>cow</b> <b>cockle</b> populations and to determine how temperature and light affect seed dormancy and germination, and iii) to determine whether <b>cow</b> <b>cockle</b> populations are persistent and form a seed bank. A total of 15 cultivated, weedy, and wild <b>cow</b> <b>cockle</b> populations from different parts of the world were compared for agro–morphological, seed dormancy and seed persistence characters from 2009 to 2011. In the field persistence study, two populations including weedy (Scott weedy) and cultivated (Scott) lines were included. Cluster analysis revealed three main groups among the populations based on the traits studied. Physiological maturity, seed size, plant height and seed yield differed most among populations. The cultivated populations, Pink Beauty, Turkey, PB– 87, Scott and a weedy population, UMan– 89 had higher seed yield, larger seeds, and greater biomass compared to the other populations. Although weedy populations showed some adaptation to cultivation, characters relating to plant architecture, seed size and yield suggested a weedy habit. Freshly matured seeds of all the populations showed high levels of primary conditional dormancy except “Mongolia”. At optimum temperature conditions for germination (10 C), the effect of temperature regime (alternating and constant) and light on seed dormancy were insignificant. The variation in optimum temperature, light, and their interactions among the <b>cow</b> <b>cockle</b> populations may be due to the plants evolving to adapt to their local environments. In the field persistence study, the weedy population had higher seedling emergence at two out of three locations and a larger residual seed bank at all the locations. Despite the differences in seed persistence between the populations, considerable numbers of seed of both weedy and cultivated lines were recovered from the soil seed bank at the end of the study. This concurs with the results of the laboratory persistence study, as both the populations had greater seed longevity (p 50 values > 50 days) which suggests a field persistence of over three years. In conclusion, higher seed yield, larger seeds, and greater biomass in cultivated populations may result from certain pre–adaptation towards domestication, which may have been acquired during the process of pre–domestication cultivation. From a domestication perspective, if <b>cow</b> <b>cockle</b> were grown as a crop, the conditional dormancy may not be considered a barrier to domestication and can be viewed as a physiological mechanism to avoid germination at harvest. The major concern in <b>cow</b> <b>cockle</b> domestication would be seed persistence, as it can form a reasonably long–term seed bank. This may pose some concerns for the production of <b>cow</b> <b>cockle</b> as a crop in the Canadian Prairies. The current research suggests that <b>cow</b> <b>cockle</b> populations from Canada, although they showed some adaptation to cultivation; are largely weedy and can be considered as variants of an early introduced species which might have evolved to adapt to non–native conditions...|$|E
40|$|Weed {{identification}} {{is considered the}} most fundamental task in weed management. It {{would be possible to}} decide on specific methods of weed control through availability of weed information in a particular location, otherwise applying different methods of control will not show satisfactory effects. To evaluate the species diversity and population indices of weeds in dry-land winter chickpea fields at four counties of Kermanshah province, 30 fields were investigated in 2015. The sampling was done based on W method at twenty points in each field. All weed species in each quadrate were identified and counted on the basis of genus and species. The indices of density, frequency, uniformity, abundance index, and relative diversity for each species were calculated and 44 weed species belonging to 22 different families were identified: 18 % of families belonged to Asteraceae, 13 % to Fabaceae, 11 % to Brassicaceae, and 9 % to Poaceae of all the weeds identified 89 percent of belonged to dicotyledons and 11 percent to monocotyledon. The broad leaf weeds of winter dry-land chickpea of Ravansar county based on dominance were common chicory (Cichorium intybus), european bindweed (Convolvulus arvensis), <b>cow</b> <b>cockle</b> (Vaccaria pyramidata) and stichy willie (Galium tricornatum), respectively. In Kermanshah county the european bindweed (Convolvulus arvensis), common chicory (Cichorium intybus), stichy willie (Galium tricornatum) and yellow goatsbeard (Tragopogon major), were the dominant weeds, respectively. Also, at Dalahoo county the common chicory (Cichorium intybus), stichy willie (Galium tricornatum), <b>cow</b> <b>cockle</b> (Vaccaria pyramidata) and wild licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra), were dominant weeds, respectively. In west Islamabad county the dominance was related to common chicory (Cichorium intybus), European bindweed (Convolvulus arvensis), wild mustard (Sinapis arvensis) and yellow goatsbeard (Tragopogon major), respectively...|$|E
30|$|As well-known, {{screening}} of medicinal plants and natural products for their pharmacological activities desired {{for human health}} is an essential step for discovery of novel drug candidates. Since our extensive studies on discovery of new cholinesterase and TYR inhibitors from herbal sources have been conducted since the year of 2000, the current stage, we have aimed to screen randomly selected fourteen plant species [Atriplex lasiantha Boiss. (AL), Ecballium elaterium (L.) A. Rich. (EE), Centaurium erythraea subsp. rhodense (Boiss & Reut.) Melderis (CER), Centaurium erythraea subsp. turcicum (Velen.) Melderis (CET), Centaurium maritimum (L.) Fritsch (CM), Centaurium spicatum L., Centaurium tenuiflorum (Hoffmans. & Link) Fritsch, Ricotia carnosula Boiss. & Heldr. (RC), Conringia grandiflora Boiss. & Heldr. (CG), Vaccaria hispanica (Mill.) Rauschert (VH), Origanum haussknechtii Boiss. (OH), Zostera noltii Hornem. (ZN), Zostera marina L. (ZM), and Posidonia oceanica (L.) Delile (PO) with medicinal and industrial importance for their AChE, BChE, and TYR inhibitory activities by ELISA microtiter assays at 100  μg mL- 1. Among the plant species screened, Atriplex species in Bulgaria [5], Ecballium elaterium (squirting cucumber) in Italy [6], and Centaurium species [7] in southern Italy are consumed as food, while Ricotia carnosula and Conringia grandiflora, the endemic species to Anatolia, along with Vaccaria hispanica (<b>cow</b> <b>cockle)</b> have been recently cultivated {{to be used as}} ingredients in nutraceutical industry in our country and these three species have also potential to be used for ornamental purposes. The marine seagrass (or Neptun grass), Posidonia oceanica, is an endemic species to the Mediterraneaen Sea, which forms wide meadows underwater, while Zostera species (eelgrass) forms dense sea grass beds. All these three marine species are considered to be ecologically imperative species making critical habitat and hunting zones for plentiful fish and invertebrates.|$|E
40|$|In the {{pharmaceutical}} industry uniform flow of powders {{is one of the}} most important considerations in solid dosage manufacture. Improper feeding of powders from storage hoppers into dye-presses can lead to inconsistent product quality, causing economic and health impacts. Investigation into the properties affecting powder flow is crucial. There were four objectives of the current research: 1. To determine the effect of moisture on the flow (Jenike flow index, Hausner Ratio and Carr Index, static and dynamic angle of repose) of selected pharmaceutical powders. 2. To study the effect of particle shape and size on Jenike flow index for selected starch and pharmaceutical powders. 3. To determine the effect of mixture compositions on the Jenike flow index of ordered mixtures of selected pharmaceutical powders. 4. To develop a novel flowability tester based on electrical capacitance tomography (ECT) that measures the dynamic angle of repose of powders. To address the first objective, to determine the effect of moisture content on the flow of four pharmaceutical powders; an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), aspartame, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC), and Respitose® ML 001 were selected. The API and Respitose® powders were found to be nonhygroscopic and were tested at near zero moisture contents only (in this case 0. 31 % and 0. 19 % respectively). Aspartame was tested at moisture contents of 0 %, 2 %, 5 % and 8 % and HPMC at moisture contents of 0 %, 2 %, 5 % and 10 %. Powder flowability was measured using the Jenike shear index, the Hausner Ratio, the Carr Index and the static and dynamic angles of repose. The Jenike flow index of aspartame increased from 0. 885 to 3. 65 with an increase in moisture content, which was attributed to the formation of large, round agglomerates. The Jenike flow index of HPMC decreased from 3. 28 to 2. 65 with an increase in moisture content, which was attributed to the increasing strength of liquid bridges. The Jenike flow index was the only flowability indicator to capture this complex behaviour. In order to address the second objective, five starches (<b>cow</b> <b>cockle,</b> barley, rye, rice and tapioca), as well as four pharmaceutical ingredients (an API, aspartame, HPMC, and Respitose® ML 001), were characterised for size and shape, and then tested for flowability. Powder flowability was measured using the Jenike shear test, the most widely accepted flowability standard in {{the pharmaceutical}} industry. It was found that the Jenike flow index decreased linearly with decreasing aspect ratio and decreasing roundness for the powders investigated. It was also determined that particle shape had a greater impact on flowability than size for powders under 30 microns in diameter. To address the third objective, ordered mixtures of pharmaceutical powders were examined to determine their flowability. Six combinations of Respitose® ML 001, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC), and an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) in varying concentrations were selected for investigation. Powder flowability was measured using the Jenike shear test, the most widely accepted flowability standard in the industry. The Jenike flow indices of the ordered mixtures were indistinguishable from the Jenike flow index of pure Respitose® at the alpha = 0. 1 level. The fourth objective, to develop a novel flowability tester using electrical capacitance tomography to measure the dynamic angle of repose, was investigated at the same time as the effect of moisture content. It was determined that the results of the novel dynamic angle of repose tester did not correlate well with the Jenike shear test. More development is needed before the novel flowability tester is ready for industrial use. The Jenike shear cell remains the only acceptable flow test for complex flow behaviour...|$|E
