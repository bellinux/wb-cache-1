40|$|The acetyl-coenzyme A {{carboxylase}} (ACCase) -inhibiting cyclohexanedione herbicide <b>clethodim</b> is used {{to control}} grass weeds infesting dicot crops. In Australia <b>clethodim</b> is widely used to control the weed Lolium rigidum. However, clethodim-resistant Lolium populations have appeared over the last 5 years and now are present in many populations across the western Australian wheat (Triticum aestivum) belt. An aspartate- 2078 -glycine (Gly) mutation in the plastidic ACCase enzyme {{has been identified as}} the only known mutation endowing <b>clethodim</b> resistance. Here, with 14 clethodim-resistant Lolium populations we revealed diversity and complexity in the molecular basis of resistance to ACCase-inhibiting herbicides (<b>clethodim</b> in particular). Several known ACCase mutations (isoleucine- 1781 -leucine [Leu], tryptophan- 2027 -cysteine [Cys], isoleucine- 2041 -asparagine, and aspartate- 2078 -Gly) and in particular, a new mutation of Cys to arginine at position 2088, were identified in plants surviving the Australian <b>clethodim</b> field rate (60 g ha− 1). Twelve combination patterns of mutant alleles were revealed in relation to <b>clethodim</b> resistance. Through a molecular, biochemical, and biological approach, we established that the mutation 2078 -Gly or 2088 -arginine endows sufficient level of resistance to <b>clethodim</b> at the field rate, and in addition, combinations of two mutant 1781 -Leu alleles, or two different mutant alleles (i. e. 1781 -Leu/ 2027 -Cys, 1781 -Leu/ 2041 -asparagine), also confer <b>clethodim</b> resistance. Plants homozygous for the mutant 1781, 2078, or 2088 alleles were found to be <b>clethodim</b> resistant and cross resistant to a number of other ACCase inhibitor herbicides including clodinafop, diclofop, fluazifop, haloxyfop, butroxydim, sethoxydim, tralkoxydim, and pinoxaden.

40|$|Lolium rigidum {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{troublesome}} herbicide resistant weeds in Australia, which has so far evolved resistance to eleven major herbicide groups. <b>Clethodim,</b> an inhibitor of acetyl–coenzyme A carboxylase (ACCase), is a selective post-emergent herbicide used to control annual and perennial grasses in a wide variety of broadleaf crops and has been used by many farmers to manage L. rigidum in continuous cropping rotations. However, repeated use of this herbicide during the last two decades has resulted in the appearance of L. rigidum populations that are highly resistant to <b>clethodim.</b> Studies on the resistance mechanisms, genetics, and fitness of resistant alleles were undertaken to better understand the evolution of <b>clethodim</b> resistance in L. rigidum. Field studies were also undertaken to investigate the performance of alternative herbicides for the management of clethodim-resistant L. rigidum in faba bean and canola. Dose–response experiments were conducted on twelve populations of L. rigidum collected from different locations in Australia. All the populations were confirmed resistant to <b>clethodim</b> with resistance levels ranging from 3 - 34 -fold as compared to the susceptible control. These resistant populations have also evolved cross-resistance to butroxydim. Sequencing of the target-site ACCase gene identified five known ACCase mutations (Leu- 1781, Asn- 2041, Gly- 2078, Arg- 2088, and Ala- 2096) in these populations. In the highly clethodim-resistant populations, the level of <b>clethodim</b> resistance was influenced by the occurrence of frost close to herbicide application. A significant reduction in the level of <b>clethodim</b> efficacy was observed in resistant populations when plants were exposed to frost for three nights before or after <b>clethodim</b> application. However, there was no effect of frost on the response of the susceptible population suggesting that the mechanism present within the resistant populations interacts with frost to further reduce <b>clethodim</b> efficacy. The inheritance of <b>clethodim</b> resistance was investigated by cross pollinating the susceptible and five resistant populations. The results of the inheritance study showed different patterns of inheritance of <b>clethodim</b> resistance in L. rigidum; which included a single gene, partially dominant, nuclear encoded trait, two different patterns of two-gene inheritance and an example of maternal inheritance of the resistance trait. The fitness of three resistant alleles (Leu- 1781, Asn- 2041, and Gly- 2078) was also studied by determining the change in the frequency of resistant alleles in two generations of L. rigidum in the absence of <b>clethodim</b> use. The results of this experiment showed that there was no significant change in the frequency of Leu- 1781 and Asn- 2041 alleles in L. rigidum populations from one generation to other but the frequency of Gly- 2078 allele increased significantly (7 to 16 %; P ≤ 0. 05). Studies were also undertaken to identify alternative herbicides for the control of <b>clethodim</b> resistant L. rigidum with a range of pre-emergent herbicides in broadleaf crops. In both faba bean and canola crops, pre-emergent herbicides alone were insufficient to effectively manage clethodim-resistant L. rigidum. The application of effective soil residual herbicides followed by the post-emergent tank-mixture of <b>clethodim</b> and butroxydim provided acceptable control of some <b>clethodim</b> resistant L. rigidum populations.

40|$|Chemical {{control with}} herbicides, {{especially}} glyphosate, {{is the main}} method used to control ryegrass. However, the repeated use of glyphosate has selected resistant ryegrass biotypes. Thus, the ACCase inhibitor herbicides have become the main alternative to control glyphosate-resistant biotypes, being widely used by farmers in Rio Grande do Sul. Repeated use of ACCase inhibitors, in turn, have selected ryegrass biotypes resistant to this herbicide mechanism. Thus, {{the objective of this}} study was to evaluate the response of ryegrass biotypes to different <b>clethodim</b> rates by dose-response curves. Increasing doses (0, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 144 and 192 g a. i. ha- 1) of the herbicide <b>clethodim</b> were applied at the 3 - 4 ryegrass leaf stage. The variables control at 14 and 28 days after treatment (DAT) and shoot dry weight were evaluated. The data were fitted by nonlinear regression log-logistic and C 50 and GR 50 were calculated based on the equation. The resistance factor was obtained by the ratio of C 50 or GR 50 of the resistant biotype by matching the susceptible biotype.

40|$|ABSTRACT Ryegrass is a weed {{of annual}} cycle that {{is present in}} winter crops, in {{orchards}} and vineyards of the South region of Brazil. The species is normally controlled by the glyphosate herbicide, but the continuous use of this product caused the selection of resistant biotypes. The use of ACCase inhibitor herbicides is the main alternative for the control of this species, {{but it has not}} been satisfactory in some places, thus causing suspicion of resistance to this action mechanism. Thus, the objective of this paper was to evaluate the occurrence and geographic distribution of ryegrass biotypes that are resistant to the <b>clethodim</b> herbicide in the state of Rio Grande do Sul. For that, seeds of ryegrass plants that survived the application of <b>clethodim</b> were collected in crops from the north region of RS, summing up to a total of 152 samples from 72 cities. The biotypes were submitted to the application of 120 g i. a. ha- 1 (maximum registered dose) and 60 g i. a. ha- 1 de <b>clethodim</b> (half the maximum registered dose). According to the results, among the samples of ryegrass seeds collected, there were no biotypes resistant to the <b>clethodim</b> herbicide when the maximum registered dose was applied and in the stage of three to four leaves.

40|$|In {{dose-response}} {{experiments and}} by molecular analyses {{the reaction of}} a black grass biotype (Alopecurus myosuroides) with target site resistance to ACCase inhibitors (Ile 1781 -Leu) was examined for the response to <b>clethodim</b> and cycloxydim and compared to {{the responses of the}} homozygous and heterozygous subpopulations. To decipher the population into the homo- and heterozygous sub-populations, individual plants of the resistant biotype were analyzed for the haplotype Leu 1781 by means of SNP analytics (pyrosequencing). For the entire population, significant different resistance factors (RF) of 8 and 153 resulted for <b>clethodim</b> and cycloxydim, respectively. For the heterozygous sub-population a RF of 6 was estimated for <b>clethodim</b> and 118 for cycloxydim. For the homozygous sub-population a RF of 10 for <b>clethodim</b> and 136 for cycloxydim was estimated. The RF between the homo- and heterozygous sub-populations for each herbicide were, however, not significantly different. Despite this, a tendency of the heterozygous sub-population being less resistant was indicated. Therefore, it is hypothesized that the selection of resistance depends not only on the herbicide used, but on the frequency of the genotypes in a field population. Furthermore, the significant different reaction of black grass with the haplotype 1781 to both tested herbicides reflects the meaning of the individual constellation of active ingredient, resistance mechanisms and genotype for selection and spread of resistance...|$|E

The photodegradation was characterized by determination of their half-lives (t 1 / 2), dissipation rate constant (k) and identification of degradation products by means of HPLC-Qtof-MS. Photolytic degradation of <b>clethodim</b> and sethoxydim was very rapid. The photodegradation rate was enhanced in leaf model than in water with half-lives that ranged from 6. 3 ± 0. 5 to 10. 1 ± 0. 4 min for <b>clethodim</b> and from 8. 0 ± 0. 3 to 20. 5 ± 0. 5 min for sethoxydim.

Our objective was to evaluate effects of seeding date, <b>clethodim</b> {(E) - 2 -[1 -[[(3 -chloro- 2 -propenyl) oxy]imino] propyl]- 5 -[2 -(ethylthio) propyl]- 3 -hydroxy- 2 -cyclohexen- 1 -one} sod suppression, and seeding rate on initial establishment and stand persistence of Falcata, a predominantly yellow-flowered alfalfa, no-till interseeded into crested wheatgrass. Research was initiated in August 2008 at Newcastle, WY; Hettinger, ND; Fruitdale, SD; and Buffalo, SD. Effects of treatment factors on plant frequency during initial establishment were influenced by site environments. Late summer and spring were suitable seeding dates. <b>Clethodim</b> sod suppression increased seedling frequency in most cases. Seedling frequency increased as seeding rate increased from 0. 56 to 7. 84 kg pure live seed (PLS) ha– 1. Specific seeding dates, <b>clethodim</b> sod suppression, and high seeding rates did not greatly improve initial establishment when site environments were poor. Residual effects of seeding date and sod suppression post establishment were not significant at most locations, but seeding rate effects were evident. Initial establishment and persistence of Falcata alfalfa was successful at Newcastle, indicating that interseeding in late summer or spring using low seeding rates (≤ 3. 36 kg PLS ha– 1) without <b>clethodim</b> can be effective.

40|$|Herbicide {{resistance}} in rigid ryegrass is an escalating problem in grain-cropping fields of southeastern Australia {{due to increased}} reliance on herbicides as the main method for weed control. Weed surveys were conducted between 1998 and 2009 to identify the extent of herbicide-resistant rigid ryegrass across this region to dinitroaniline, and acetolactate synthase- and acetyl coenzyme A (CoA) carboxylase-inhibiting herbicides. Rigid ryegrass was collected from cropped fields chosen at random. Outdoor pot studies were conducted during the normal winter growing season for rigid ryegrass with PRE-applied trifluralin and POST-applied diclofop-methyl, chlorsulfuron, tralkoxydim, pinoxaden, and <b>clethodim.</b> Herbicide resistance to trifluralin in rigid ryegrass was identified in one-third of the fields surveyed from South Australia, whereas less than 5 % of fields in Victoria exhibited resistance. In contrast, resistance to chlorsulfuron was detected in {{at least half of}} the cropped fields across southeastern Australia. Resistance to the cereal-selective aryloxyphenoxypropionate-inhibiting herbicides diclofopmethyl, tralkoxydim, and pinoxaden ranged between 30 and 60 % in most regions, whereas in marginal cropping areas less than 12 % of fields exhibited resistance. Resistance to <b>clethodim</b> varied between 0 and 61 %. Higher levels of resistance to <b>clethodim</b> were identified in the more intensively cropped, higher-rainfall districts where pulse and canola crops are common.

The field experiments were accompanied using molecular analysis leaf samples from the plots to seize the occurrence of black-grass with the Leu 1781 haplotype and to determine {{the frequency of the}} genotypes. The goal of the trials was to correlate the successes of blackgrass control with the occurrence of hetero- and homozygous resistant genotypes. It was shown in greenhouse trials that <b>clethodim</b> selects the haplotype Leu 1781 more weakly (and it shows a higher partial efficacy) than cycloxydim and that heterozygous plants have a lower resistance factor than homozygous plants. The question raised whether the frequency of heterozygous plants has influence on increased efficacy of <b>clethodim</b> under field conditions. At 5 sites target-site resistance was detected. At one location the high proportion of heterozygous plants correlated positive with relative higher control using Select EC 240 (80 %) compared to Focus Ultra (0 %). At two locations with high proportion of homozygous resistant plants Select EC 240 and Focus Ultra treatments without subsequent treatments with Kerb FLO were not sufficient in solo variants. The subsequent treatments with Kerb FLO provided partly, but not sufficient control of black-grass. At one location no resistance was identified. The effect of Select EC 240 and Focus Ultra to control black-grass were comparable high in all variants with and without subsequent treatments of Kerb FLO. The investigations showed clearly a higher degree of control by plants with the haplotype Leu 1781 by the active substance <b>clethodim</b> and pointed out the fact that the frequency of resistant genotypes (homo vs. heterozygous resistant plants) has a clear influence on the resistance selection. The use of DIMs at locations suspected to be resistant should be assured only with the help of propyzamide and nonchemical measurements (e. g. ploughing, crop rotation).

The standard was <b>clethodim</b> at 84 g ha- 1 with 2, 4 -D and fluroxypyr at same rates. The applications of haloxyfop and <b>clethodim</b> both isolated or in a mixture with 2, 4 -D and fluroxypyr at V 5 stage showed total control (100 &# 37;) at 32 and 39 days after the application, except for haloxyfop + 2, 4 -D (25 + 670 g ha- 1) mixture, which did not provided adequate control. At V 8 stage, haloxyfop + 2, 4 -D (50 + 670 g ha- 1) and haloxyfop + 2, 4 -D (62 + 670 g ha- 1) mixtures took up to 6 and 10 days or longer to reach adequate to excellent control, when compared to haloxyfop isolated applications in the same doses, respectively.

40|$|Rapid {{adoption}} of glyphosate-resistant (GR) corn hybrids {{has led to}} the reemergence of volunteer corn as a problematic weed in soybean and corn and has made controlling the initial stand of corn in a replant situation more difficult. <b>Clethodim</b> and glufosinate are often used to control GR corn in corn replant situations and in soybean. The objectives of this research were to evaluate the response of two hybrid corn varieties and their F 2 progeny to <b>clethodim</b> and glufosinate and to evaluate the effect of plant nitrogen (N) concentration on <b>clethodim</b> and glufosinate efficacy. DeKalb 63 - 42 was more tolerant to <b>clethodim</b> than 60 - 18 and 60 - 18 F 2. No {{differences were found between the}} hybrids and their respective F 2 progeny in the response to <b>clethodim</b> or glufosinate. In a second dose-response study assessing the effect of N conditions on herbicide efficacy, both <b>clethodim</b> and glufosinate were less injurious to plants growing in low N than in high N availability. ^ Earlier corn planting dates results in difficult to control GR corn in a replant situation with herbicides labeled for use in corn. In addition, little is known about the effect that a partial initial corn stand has on replanted corn yields. Therefore, the objectives of this research were to evaluate the herbicide options for control of GR corn in a corn replant situation and to determine the effect of replanted corn into various initial corn stands on grain yield. <b>Clethodim</b> (51 g ai ha− 1) applied 6 days prior to replanting, paraquat (700 g ai ha− 1) plus metribuzin (160 g ai ha− 1) applied at replanting, and glufosinate (450 g ai ha− 1) applied at replanting along with a sequential treatment 3 weeks later provided 96 to 100 % control of the initial corn stands and resulted in the highest yield. A second field experiment was conducted to evaluate the influence on grain yield of replanted corn into various initial corn stands. Initial corn stands ≤ 40, 000 plants ha− 1, required a replant with initial stand control to maximize grain yield, while initial stands ≥ 60, 000 plants ha− 1 did not require a replant to maximize yield. The percent yield contribution from an initial stand of 20, 000 plants ha− 1 was 20 % greater than the replant stand indicating a competitive advantage even at the lowest initial corn stand. Due to this competitive advantage an initial stand must be removed to maximize corn yield in a replant situation. ^ Volunteer corn (VC) may interfere with hybrid corn for nitrogen (N), reducing grain yield and the interference may be influenced by N management. Field experiments were established to determine the effects that N fertilizer management and VC interference have on hybrid corn growth and grain yield. Treatments consisted of three VC densities, a control (0 plants m− 2), a low density (1 plant m− 2), a high density (4 plants m− 2), and six N fertilizer treatments (0 kg N ha− 1, 67 kg N ha− 1 at planting, 67 kg N ha− 1 at planting + 133 kg N ha− 1 at V 5 corn growth stage, 67 kg N ha− 1 at planting + 133 kg N ha− 1 at V 10 corn growth stage, 200 kg N ha − 1 at V 5 corn growth stage, and 200 kg N ha− 1 at V 10 corn growth stage). When 200 kg N ha− 1 was applied, regardless of application timing, hybrid corn dry weight, hybrid corn N accumulation, and hybrid corn grain yield were reduced by the high VC density. However, when VC grain yield was added to hybrid corn grain yield VC density did not affect total grain yield. When 0 and 67 kg N ha− 1 were applied, neither hybrid dry weight or hybrid N accumulation were affected by either VC density, but hybrid corn grain yield and total grain yield were both reduced by the high VC density. N fertilizer application timing had no effect on hybrid corn dry weight, N accumulation, or grain yield. Late N fertilizer applications (200 kg N ha− 1 at V 10 and 67 kg N ha − 1 at planting + 133 kg N ha− 1 at V 10) resulted in greater VC N accumulation, VC grain yield, and total yield. However, the potential problems associated with VC should result in management practices to reduce the presence of VC in corn. ...|$|E

Here we have conducted a study on the mechanism of resistance to ACCase inhibiting herbicides in a Lolium multiflorum population (RG 3) from the UK. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Analysis of plant phenotypes and genotypes showed that all the RG 3 plants (72 %) that contained the cysteine to arginine mutation at ACCase codon position 2088 were resistant to ACCase inhibiting herbicides. Whole plant dose response tests on predetermined wild and mutant 2088 genotypes from RG 3 and a standard sensitive population indicated that the C 2088 R mutation is the only factor conferring resistance to all ten ACCase herbicides tested. The associated resistance indices ranged from 13 for <b>clethodim</b> to over 358 for diclofop-methyl. <b>Clethodim,</b> the most potent herbicide was significantly affected even when applied on small mutant plants at the peri-emergence and one leaf stages. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: This study establishes the clear and unambiguous importance of the C 2088 R target site mutation in conferring broad resistance to ten commonly used ACCase inhibiting herbicides. It also demonstrates that low levels "creeping", multigenic, non target site resistance, is not always selected before single gene target site resistance appears in grass weed populations subjected to herbicide selection pressure...|$|E

One field experiment was performed to evaluate the selectivity of herbicides applied in post - emergence of showy crotalaria. The herbicides bentazon (720 and 576 g ha - 1), imazethapyr (106 and 79. 5 g ha - 1), pyrithiobac - sodium (84 g ha - 1), flumiclorac (60 g ha - 1), flumiclorac in sequential application (30 / 30 g ha - 1), imazethapyr + bentazon (106 + 480 g ha - 1), and <b>clethodim</b> + quizalofop (96 + 100 g ha - 1) were applied in plants with four true leaves, also using a control without herbicide application. Pyrithiobac - sodium and flumiclorac isolated and the tankmix of imazethapyr + bentazon provided greater injuries to showy crotalaria, also affecting the final plant height. Pyrithiobac - sodium (84 g ha - 1) was not selective to showy crotalaria. The herbicides imazethapyr (79. 5 g ha - 1), flumiclorac (sequential application), and bentazon (576 g ha - 1), despite the association between <b>clethodim</b> + quizalofop, can be used for weed management in showy crotalaria crop...|$|E
40|$|Small burnet (Sanguisorba minor scop.) Is a hardy, {{relatively}} long lived evergreen forb {{native to}} Eurasia that has potential to improve grazinglands and extend grazing into late fall and winter. Trials evaluating small burnet tolerance to {{spring and fall}} postemergence herbicide applications were conducted at the Utah State University Evans farm in Millville, UT. Two small burnet genotypes were grown in a randomized complete block design with a split-plot arrangement. Twelve treatments, <b>clethodim,</b> clopyralid, imazamox, 2, 4 DB, metribuzin, aminopyralid, pendimethalin, dimethenamid-P, bromoxynil, dicamba, quinclorac, and an untreated were applied at moderate field use rates either spring or fall of the establishment year. Plots were rated for visual injury on a 0 to 100 scale where 0 = no injury and 100 = complete mortality. Ratings were done 7, 14, 60 days after treatment (DAT) and the spring following treatment. Seed yield, seed viability, and dry matter yield (DMY) were determined. Fall treatments of aminopyralid reduced seed yield 65 %, seed germination 43 %, and DMY 67 %. Fall applied imazamox treatments reduced DMY by 36 %, and seed yield by 33 %, but did not impact germination. Visual injury was greatest from spring and fall applied aminopyralid treatments with ratings of 24 % and 79 %. Spring applied treatments did not impact seed yield or seed germination. Results suggest that <b>clethodim,</b> metribuzin, quinclorac, clopyralid, dimethenamid-P, bromoxynil, and pendimethalin cause little or no injury to small burnet...|$|E
40|$|Efficacy of {{the grass}} {{herbicides}} showed that Select (<b>clethodim)</b> and BAS- 620 (BASF Corporation) at rates as low as 0. 1 lb AI/A were nearly comparable in controlling 2 leaf stage of growth watergrass or when applied a week later on 3 - 4 inch tall watergrass. Fusilade DX (fluazifop-p-butyl) was intermediate in controlling grasses and 0. 188 lb AI/A was necessary to give equivalent control of larger grasses {{as compared to the}} 0. 1 lb AI/A rate that gave acceptable control of smaller grasses. Poast (sethoxydim) at 0. 188 lb AI/A gave acceptable control of small grasses but lower rates or later timed applications were not as efficacious...|$|E
40|$|Dentre as causas da ineficácia no controle de plantas daninhas destaca-se a resistência delas aos herbicidas. Os objetivos deste trabalho foram avaliar a suspeita de resistência de Eleusine indica a inibidores de acetil-CoA carboxilase (ACCase) e {{investigar}} a ocorrência de resistência cruzada entre os inibidores de ACCase. Biótipo de Eleusine indica originado do Mato Grosso com suspeita de resistência aos herbicidas inibidores de ACCase foi avaliado em casa de vegetação na sua suscetibilidade para diversos produtos do grupo dos ariloxifenoxipropionatos e cicloexanodionas. Estudos de resposta à dose confirmaram que o biótipo era 18 vezes mais insensível ao sethoxydim do que biótipo suscetível nunca aspergido com herbicidas. Também se constatou resistência cruzada ao fenoxaprop, cyhalofop, propaquizafop e butroxydim. Não se observou resistência cruzada aos produtos fluazifop, haloxyfop, quizalofop e <b>clethodim.</b> Among {{the causes}} for weed control inefficacy, the worst one is resistance to herbicides. The objectives {{of this work}} were to evaluate an Eleusine indica biotype suspected of resistance to ACCase inhibitors and to investigate the occurrence of cross- resistance to several ACCase inhibitors. One biotype of Eleusine indica originated from Mato Grosso with suspected resistance to ACCase inhibitors was evaluated in a greenhouse in relation to its susceptibility to several products of the ariloxyphenoxypropionate and cyclohexanedione groups. Studies on dose response confirmed that the suspected biotype was 18 times more insensitive to sethoxydim than the susceptible biotype {{that had never been}} treated with herbicides. Cross-resistance was confirmed for fenoxaprop, cyhalofop, propaquizafop and butroxydim. No cross-resistance was observed with fluazifop, haloxyfop, quizalofop, and <b>clethodim...</b>|$|E
