50|$|The {{rainy season}} is between June and mid-July. It {{is caused by}} hot and humid high {{pressure}} forming in the Sea of Okhotsk due to the North Pacific anticyclone combining with Asiatic <b>continental</b> <b>high</b> pressure. When the two meteorological events meet they form a long jangmajeonseon (Hanja: 장마前線). Beginning in late-May, the North Pacific high pressure forces the weaker continental anticyclone south of the island of Okinawa. This fall to the south then reverses and gradually strengthens as it moves northwards back towards the Korean peninsula. On landfall, heavy monsoon rains lead to torrential downpours and flooding. By August the system has weakened as the southern systems retreat towards the Filipino archipelago.|$|E

50|$|The Atlantic Ocean to {{the west}} and the Eurasian {{continent}} to the east interact to modify the climate of the country. The warm waters of the Gulf Stream and the North Atlantic Drift Current, play a big role in the climate of Norway, Sweden and Finland which continuously warm the region, if it weren't for these currents the winters in Scandinavia and Fennoscandia would be much colder. Westerly winds bring the warm air currents into the Baltic areas and to the country's shores, moderating winter temperatures, specially in the south and southwest in cities like Helsinki and Turku where winter highs tend to be between 0 and 5 C but a cold snap like the one that occurred in mid-January 2016 can cause temperatures to plunge well below -20 C. These winds, because of clouds associated with weather systems accompanying the westerlies, also decrease the amount of sunshine received during the summer. By contrast, the <b>continental</b> <b>high</b> pressure system situated over the Eurasian continent counteracts the maritime influences, occasionally causing severe winters and high temperatures in the summer.|$|E
5000|$|More {{probable}} is John Earle's {{suggestion that}} the legend comes from a pagan or possibly prehistoric day of augury. In France, [...] St. Medard (8 June), Urban of Langres, and St. Gervase and St. Protais (19 June) are credited with an influence on the weather almost identical with that attributed to St Swithun in England. In Flanders, there is St Godelieve (6 July) and in Germany the Seven Sleepers' Day (27 June). There is a scientific basis to the weather pattern behind the legend of St Swithun's day. Around the middle of July, the jet stream settles into a pattern which, {{in the majority of}} years, holds reasonably steady until the end of August. When the jet stream lies north of the British Isles then <b>continental</b> <b>high</b> pressure is able to move in; when it lies across or south of the British Isles, Arctic air and Atlantic weather systems predominate.A similarly themed proverb exists in Swedish, in which a mild and rainy 30 November (St Andrew's day) means a cold Christmas period, and vice versa.|$|E

40|$|The {{historical}} context and potential causes {{and structure of}} the 1992 / 93 drought in KwaZulu-Natal are analysed using NCEP reanalysis data. The analysis indicates that increased westerly winds with surface marine lows and <b>continental</b> <b>highs</b> prevailed over Southern Africa. Anomalous divergence and subsidence occur over the eastern subcontinent, coupled with reduced tropical moist inflows. Mid-latitude confluence, anticyclonic vorticity and upper level convergence suppressed convection over KwaZulu/Natal. The precipitable water field reflects a SE-NW orientated stationary wave-train pattern over Southern Africa with KwaZulu-Natal anti-phase with the Zambezi valley. A meridional overturning cell is seen as a driving mechanism behind the 1992 / 93 drought over South Africa. The velocity potential shows a dipole between the Zambezi and the SW Indian Ocean, and it appears that the kinematic structure was more important than the thermodynamic. Impacts include a reduction in crop yield and streamflows, and a slowing of economic activity. Keywords...|$|R

I con-struct an azimuthally anisotropic three-dimensional model of the Australian upper mantle from Rayleigh-wave waveforms. I compare Bayesian inverse methods with discretely pa-rameterized regularization methods, and explore the use of regular, tectonic and resolution-dependent tomographic grids. I advocate the use of multitaper spectral estimation tech-niques for coherence analysis of gravity and topography, applied to Australian isostasy.

40|$|The three summer drought {{patterns}} of the middle-lower reaches of the Yangtze River basin (MLRYRB) and their associated atmospheric circulation were investigated before and after 1980. For the whole-basin wide drought pattern during 1961 – 1979, the anomalous high ridge over Japan blocked the northerly flow from Siberia to southern China. Further, the western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH) was weaker than normal and shifted eastward. For the southern drought and northern flood pattern during 1961 – 1979, the zonal circulation was straight and an anomalous anticyclonic circulation was located over Japan. Less moisture was transported to southern China associated with the weakened WPSH. During 1980 – 2013, the WPSH extended westward and controlled {{the southern part of}} the MLRYRB, and an anomalous cyclonic circulation was centered over Japan. For the southern flood and northern drought pattern during 1961 – 1979, the meridional circulation was obvious, and the WPSH was weaker than normal. The anomalous southwesterly moisture transport appeared to southern China. However, during 1980 – 2013 the <b>continental</b> <b>high</b> pressure impacted northern China. The WPSH shifted eastward and the anomalous northeasterly moisture transport presented over eastern China...|$|E

40|$|Potential {{vorticity}} {{diagnosis is}} applied to study the factors contributing to the decrease of the forward motion of Typhoon Sinlaku (2002) and is {{used to evaluate the}} reason why the operational Aviation (AVN) model failed to predict this slowdown and had a southward track bias as Sinlaku approached the area offshore northeastern Taiwan. The analysis indicates that the initial deceleration was mainly associated with the retreat of the Pacific subtropical high (SH) {{under the influence of the}} deepening midlatitude trough (TR). The upper-level cold-core low (CCL) played only a minor role in impeding Sinlaku from moving northward, while the <b>continental</b> <b>high</b> (CH) over mainland China strongly steered Sinlaku westward. Because the steering effect from the above four systems (SH, TR, CCL, and CH) tend to cancel one another out, the subtle interaction therein makes it difficult to make a precise track forecast. The analyses of the AVN model forecasts show that overestimating the CH and underestimating the SH are the main causes for the forecast bias. It is believed that results from this work can provide a useful method to quantitatively determine the key factors affecting the typhoon track. Such an analysis should be able to guide future observing and modeling strategies to improve the forecasts of typhoons. 1...|$|E
40|$|For {{many decades}} {{molluscan}} data {{have been critical}} {{to the establishment of}} the concept of a global-scale increase in species richness from the poles to the equator. Low polar diversity is key to this latitudinal cline in diversity. Here we investigate richness patterns in the two largest classes of molluscs at both local and regional scales throughout the Southern Ocean. We show that biodiversity is very patchy in the Southern Ocean (at the 1000 -km scale) and test the validity of historical biogeographic sub-regions and provinces. We used multivariate analysis of biodiversity patterns at species, genus and family levels to define richness hotspots within the Southern Ocean and transition areas. This process identified the following distinct sub-regions in the Southern Ocean: Antarctic Peninsula, Weddell Sea, East Antarctic—Dronning Maud Land, East Antarctic—Enderby Land, East Antarctic—Wilkes Land, Ross Sea, and the independent Scotia arc and sub Antarctic islands. Patterns of endemism were very different between the bivalves and gastropods. On the basis of distributional ranges and radiation centres of evolutionarily successful families and genera we define three biogeographic provinces in the Southern Ocean: (1) the <b>continental</b> <b>high</b> Antarctic province excluding the Antarctic Peninsula, (2) the Scotia Sea province including the Antarctic Peninsula, and (3) the sub Antarctic province comprising the islands {{in the vicinity of the}} Antarctic Circumpolar Current...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} predictors of dust events. A longitudinal study of dust events that occurred in Taipei and Beijing from 2000 to 2002 was investigated. The events were separated into two groups. Group 1 was the dust events, which affected Beijing, and Group 2 was dust events, which affected Taipei. The separation of dust events by the position and extension of the polar <b>continental</b> <b>high</b> was determined. Composite analysis of geopotential height, 850 hPa vorticity and principal components (PC) were then carried out for these two categories. Comparisons of the East Asian main trough distributions, for high-low and negative-positive vorticity demonstrated differences between both of categories. PC analysis revealed that both geopotential height and wind field, for the first two prin-cipal components (PC 1 and PC 2) of Group 1 and Group 2 were also quite different and that the total variance ratio was greater than 90 %. The re-sults indicated that the position of the polar high in both cases was similar. The extension of the high that influenced Beijing however covered an area to the north of the Yellow River and that which influenced Taipei, covered an area to the south of the Yellow River. The results also indicated that the trough (PC 1) and the cyclonic circulation (PC 2) were stronger in Group 2 than Group 1...|$|E
