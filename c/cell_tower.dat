Trilateration {{can be used as a}} quick, less battery intensive way to provide location-aware applications with the co-ordinates of the user. However, the accuracy of BlackBerry trilateration is less than that of GPS due to a number of factors, including <b>cell</b> <b>tower</b> blockage by large buildings, mountains, or distance.|$|E

In 1984, State Route213 was moved [...] away from Joppenbergh and closer to Rondout Creek to protect motorists. A retaining wall was put up {{at the foot of}} the mountain to prevent falling rocks from rolling onto the street. During the 1980s, Vidacable TV Systems leased part of the mountain from the JMC to set up an antenna. Cellular One considered building a [...] <b>cell</b> <b>tower</b> on top of Joppenbergh in 1992, but decided not to do so. Although there was public opposition to the proposal, Cellular One stated that local sentiment was not a factor in its decision against building the tower. In 1995 the mountain was studied by the New York Public Service Commission to determine a possible route for new transmission lines laid by a local energy utility.|$|E

Specifically, the dataset contains {{the total volume}} (number of calls and SMSs) and duration of calls between each pair of <b>cell</b> <b>towers</b> over the entire period. The total number of <b>cell</b> <b>towers</b> is 1, 238; however, in the pre-processing phase, we have eliminated the <b>cell</b> <b>towers,</b> which are not present during the whole period, ending up with 970 <b>cell</b> <b>towers</b> to analyze. The exact locations of the towers are not provided by Orange Telecom, due to the company’s operational confidentiality. Finally, it is worth noticing that the data consist of the total traffic between <b>cell</b> <b>towers,</b> and hence no individual data are ever accessed.|$|R

2500|$|Mobile phones {{send and}} receive radio signals with any number of cell site base {{stations}} fitted with microwave antennas. These sites are usually mounted on a tower, pole or building, located throughout populated areas, then connected to a cabled communication network and switching system. The phones have a low-power transceiver that transmits voice and data to the nearest cell sites, normally not more than 8 to 13km (approximately 5 to 8 miles) away. [...] In areas of low coverage, a cellular repeater may be used, which uses a long distance high-gain dish antenna or yagi antenna to communicate with a <b>cell</b> <b>tower</b> far outside of normal range, and a repeater to rebroadcast on a small short-range local antenna that allows any cellphone within a few meters to function properly.|$|E
2500|$|The Nissan Leaf employs an {{advanced}} telematics system called CarWings which originally was only available in Japan. The system sends and receives data via a built-in GPRS radio {{similar to the}} connectivity of mobile phones. [...] Carwings is connected any time the car is in range of a <b>cell</b> <b>tower</b> and it makes possible several user functionalities, such as position and possible range on a map and which charging stations are available within range. The system also tracks and compiles statistics about distance traveled and energy consumption and produces daily, monthly and annual reports of these and several other operational parameters. All information {{is available in the}} Leaf's digital screens. [...] Through a smart phone application or secure web page, owners can remotely turn on the air-conditioner or heater as well as reset charging functions even when the vehicle is powered down. This remote functionality can be used to pre-heat or pre-cool the car prior to use while it is still charging so that less energy from the battery is used for climate control. [...] An on-board timer can also be pre-programmed to recharge batteries at a set time such as during off-peak rates. The Leaf's SL trim has a small solar panel {{at the rear of the}} roof/spoiler that can trickle charge the auxiliary battery.|$|E
