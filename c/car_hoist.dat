40|$|Neue Museen is a 16 mm {{film about}} the radical, modernist {{exhibition}} designs of Italian post-war architect Franco Albini and his collaboration with museum director Caterina Marcenaro in the early 1950 s. The film is shot in the galleries of the Palazzo Bianco and Palazzo Rosso, and the Museo di Sant’Agostino, in Genoa. Albini and Marcenaro’s desire was to literally ‘float’ art in the museum, and the film reconstructs Albini’s unprecedented and extraordinary hydraulic lifting and rotating support for Giovanni Pisano’s ‘Fragment from the Tomb of Margaret Of Brabant’ (1313). This device, which now looks utterly eccentric, {{can be seen as}} one of the first examples of interactive museum sculpture display. Along with a range of innovative hinged supports that allowed paintings to be moved horizontally away from the wall, it was installed in the Palazzo Bianco in 1951 as the focal point of the post-war reconstruction of the museum. It was subsequently de-installed and put into storage in the early 1970 s and now resides in the basement of the Museo di Sant’Agostino. The appropriateness of Albini’s device was much commented on at the time of its installation, primarily because it was adapted from a ‘found’ hydraulic <b>car</b> <b>hoist.</b> In defense of Albini’s provocative display system Marcenaro claimed its mobility was central to ‘a new museum concept’ that emphasised truth, serenity and visibility. In his important survey of post-war Museum design Neue Museen, Planung und Einrichtung (1965) Michael Brawne indicates that Albini’s designs “were the first to question accepted methods of display” and “were to prove enormously influential later”. G E Kidder Smith in Italy Builds. L’Italia Costrusce (1954) suggests that the arrangement of the room that housed the Pisano fragment represented “a landmark design” in the presentation of sculpture in a museum context. The film focuses on Albini and Marcenaro’s stated desire to “emphasise the atmosphere of purity and tranquillity that surrounds a real masterpiece” as a particularly explicit example of the modernist ideology of the museum to radically decontextualise art from its surroundings. As Catherine Marcerano suggests in an article from 1954 (Museum vol. 7 no. 4, 1954) : “In the interests of education, the Palace concept was abandoned and the museum criterion strictly adhered to. In other words, the works of art were treated not as the decorative part of a given setting, but as a world in themselves, sufficient to absorb the visitor’s full attention”. It’s this idea of a ‘museum criterion’ that is central to Albini’s designs and exhibition display. In effect his designs propose a certain kind of looking and it’s this form of absorption that the film draws the viewer into. A limited number of black and white photographs of the installed mobile display device exist yet there appear to be no extant accounts or film footage of how it actually operated in the museum. The film also refers to the remarkable relationship between Marcenaro, who also commissioned Albini to design an apartment on the top floor of the adjacent building to the Palazzo Rosso for her own use. The apartment was the subject of a feature in Domus (June 1955) entitled “The Apartment of an Art Lover”...|$|E

500|$|The rammerman's {{position}} was of special concern, as ramming {{was considered the}} most dangerous part of loading the gun. The ram was used to first thrust the projectile and then the powder bags into the gun's breech. The ram speed used for the projectile was much faster ( [...] per second) than that used for the lighter powder bags ( [...] per second), {{but there was no}} safety device on the ram piston to prevent the rammerman from accidentally pushing the powder bags at the faster speed. Overramming the powder bags into the gun could subject the highly flammable powder to excessive friction and compression, with a resulting increased danger of premature combustion. Also, if the bags were pushed too far into the gun, a gap between the last bag and the primer might prevent the powder from igniting when the gun was fired, causing a misfire. None of Iowas rammermen had any training or experience in ramming nonstandard five-bag loads into the guns. Complicating the task, as the rammerman was shoving the powder bags, he was also supposed to simultaneously operate a lever to shut the powder hoist door and lower the powder <b>hoist</b> <b>car.</b> Iowa crewmen later stated that Turret Two's center gun rammer would sometimes [...] "take off" [...] uncontrollably on its own at high speed. Furthermore, Backherms had never operated the ram before during a live fire shoot.|$|R
40|$|This master {{thesis is}} carried out at TTS Marine AB in Gothenburg; a company {{specialized}} in design, engineering and construction of large complex and moveable steel structures for large ships, such as PCTC, RORO and ROPAX. Typical products is equipment and solutions of rolling goods, i. e. large off and on loading ramps, <b>car</b> decks, <b>hoist</b> able decks, quarter stern ramps, etc. The procedure for developing and designing a new product or steel structure is first to create a JavaScript that combined with the software program GeniE generates a computer model. Due {{to the fact that}} no products are identical, these scripts need to be redeveloped and rewritten for each new product is designed, a time consuming and costly process. Utilization of man hours and the duration of the engineering phase is of great importance in the time aspect of weight optimization of the steel structure, this is particularly important in designing and construction of floating vessels. Reduced weight reduces fuel consumption, increases cargo capacity and allows for increased speed, factors that have an impact on company revenue. Calculations related to weight optimization of TTS products is currently performed mainly manually, the result and accuracy is of high quality due to extensive experience, references and large knowledge. By using a developed and sophisticated tailor made software system may man hours and duration be decreased {{and at the same time}} gain traceability and transferable documentation This thesis has two purposes. The first is the modularization of a number of structures. This is achieved by developing a JavaScript that with the right input values can generate a number of different products, (i. e. ramps) thus reducing man hours and duration for weight optimization calculations. The second purpose is to define an optimizing method that can be implemented with GeniE. The optimization method is foreseen to be a part of the basis for the planned development of a new software program that automatically will optimize the steel structure in a ramp. A large number of existing ramps has been studied in order to identify components and features that are common in the different ramps. These features are compiled and described and an explanation of how the script is built is included in the report. The final script has been evaluated and tested by engineers with extensive experience to calculate structures by using the software program GeniE. In preparation for the optimization calculations, a number of different variable parameters in the structure have been reviewed, variables not applicable for optimization has been precluded. A study of optimizing methods has been undertaken and a suitable method is identified. An optimizing algorithm for the structure has been developed...|$|R
40|$|The {{conceptual}} design {{is based on}} a Koepe hoist and is intended for transport of the POLLUX casks with a large hoisting cage and counterweight. The hoisting engine is comprised in a winding tower, with a designed rope load of approx. 214. 2 t in the hoistway, and of approx. 171. 7 t in the balance pit. The hoisting equipment is designed as an 8 -rope system with the ropes measuring approx. 50 mm across. The design was {{to take into account the}} {{conceptual design}} of the planned radwaste repository, characterized by the fact that the upcast shaft (shaft hoisting system shaft 2) is to serve as the transport shaft for radwaste containers, as this function requires additional airlocks in order to avoid shortcircuiting of air. The design comprises all in all the port for the <b>hoisting</b> <b>car</b> receiving the containers from a cross-gate, the shaft emplacement equipment, the hoisting tower, control equipment, the shaft furniture, the hoisting engine, the ropes and materials handling device, the counterweight, communicators, balance rope devices, and the electric system.
