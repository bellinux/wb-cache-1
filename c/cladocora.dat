Mortality events have recurrently affected this species {{during the last}} decade. Thus, knowledge of its genetic structure, population diversity, and connectivity is needed to accomplish suitable conservation plans. In order to obtain {{a better understanding of}} the population genetics of this species, 13 highly variable microsatellites markers were developed from a naturally bleached colony. The developed primers failed to amplify zooxanthella DNA, isolated from C. caespitosa, verifying that these markers were of the coral and not algal symbiont origin. The degree of polymorphism of these loci was tested on tissue samples from 28 colonies. The allele number for each loci ranged from 2 to 13 (mean Na = 5. 4), with an average observed heterozygosity of 0. 42 (He = 0. 43) and all loci were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. These new markers should be useful in future conservation genetic studies and will help to improve the resolution of the individual identification within this coral species.

Bayesian clustering methods, traditional F-statistics and D est statistics {{were used to determine}} the patterns of genetic structure. Likelihood and coalescence approaches were used to infer migration patterns and effective population sizes. The results obtained reveal a high level of connectivity among localities separated by as much as 1 km and moderate levels of genetic differentiation among more distant localities, somewhat corresponding with a stepping-stone model of gene flow and connectivity. These data suggest that connectivity among populations of this coral is mainly driven by the biology of the species, with low dispersal abilities; in addition, hydrodynamic processes, oceanographic fronts and the distribution of rocky substrate along the coastline may influence larval dispersal. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

40|$|In {{the area}} {{comprised}} between {{the villages of}} Riparbella and Casale Marittimo (lower Cecina Valley, Tuscany, Italy) {{a large amount of}} Pleistocene deposits outcrops. Through a detailed geological survey integrated with facies analysis five litostratigraphic units, grouped in three Allostratigraphic Units (UA), have been detected. The oldest (UA 7), lower pleistocenic in age, is formed by two litostratigraphic units (“Conglomerati delle Ginepraie” and “Sabbie ed argille ad Arctica islandica”) showing latero-vertical relationships and are organized in a transgressive-regressive cycle. The “Conglomerati delle Ginepraie” are arranged in a fining upwards trend and were deposited in small coalescent deltaic environments. Three depositional facies are recognized within the “Sabbie ed argille ad Arctica islandica” recording a fining-coarsening and deepening shallowing upward trend. The UA 7 lies in unconformity above pre-quaternary deposits. The second (UA 6), lower pleistocenic in age, is also constituted by two heteropic and transgressive litostratigraphic units (“Conglomerati delle Lame” and “Arenarie e Sabbie di Montescudaio”) lying in angular unconformity on the UA 7. The “Conglomerati delle Lame”, showing a well developed imbrication, were deposited in a foreshore to upper shoreface depositional environment. The “Arenarie e Sabbie di Montescudaio” are characterized by a high to low planar-cross stratification and sometimes by overturned stratification and were deposited in a shallow marine environment. The regressive phase of this UA is not preserved due to erosive processes. The youngest unit (UA 4, “Conglomerati di Serra all’Olio”), was instead deposited in fluvial-braided environment and lies in angular unconformity on the others UA. The middle pleistocenic age of this unit has been inferred {{on the basis of its}} stratigraphic position. This stratigraphic reconstruction strongly conflict from previous interpretations. Important climatic and geological remarks derive from the finding of two taxa (Arctica islandica and the coral <b>Cladocora</b> caespitosa) at different stratigraphic positions within the oldest unit (“Sabbie ed argille ad Arctica islandica”). The Arctica islandica testifying cold temperatures (4 °C to 13 °C) characterizes the first 5 meters of the unit, while beds of <b>Cladocora</b> caespitosa (15 °C to 22 °C the temperature range of this coral) only occur upwards. We retain that the deposition of the “Sabbie ed argille ad Arctica islandica” takes place during a warming phase and that the development of <b>Cladocora</b> caespitosa beds could be related to the maximum flooding conditions at the end of the transgressive phase.

40|$|Marine {{ecosystems}} are declining worldwide threatened by {{an increasing number}} of stressors. Global change-related disturbances have highlighted the need of new complementary conservation measures; for which the knowledge on the affected species, communities and impacts is essential. The species objective of this PhD, the Mediterranean endemic coral <b>Cladocora</b> caespitosa, may serve as a case study of those species that even if seriously threatened, are lacking essential information on key ecological processes and the responses to the rapid environmental changes that are happening globally. <b>Cladocora</b> caespitosa is the only colonial and zooxanthellate scleractinian coral endemic to the Mediterranean Sea. It is a long-lived and ecosystem engineer species, being one of the rare examples of this type of organisms found in shallow Mediterranean communities, and constitutes an invaluable natural patrimony due to its extensive ancient history, its sizeable long-lasting structures and its fragility in the actual context of climate change. Currently, large C. caespitosa bioconstructions are scarce and only a few examples are known, i. e., in Mjlet National Park (Adriatic) or in the Columbretes Islands (NW Mediterranean). The extensive field of colonies and reefs found in the Illa Grossa Bay (Columbretes Islands Marine Reserve) shows a cumulative colony cover of 2900 m 2. This population displays a high degree of geographical isolation and its spatial distribution in the bay is highly aggregated. Our results showed that <b>Cladocora</b> caespitosa is a slow growing species (~ 2. 5 mm yr- 1), with low recruitment and natural mortality rates (~ 0. 30 recruits m- 2 yr- 1 and 1 %, respectively). Strikingly, the obtained results on the reproductive traits of this species differed significantly between Western Mediterranean and Adriatic Seas. <b>Cladocora</b> caespitosa is gonochoric in W Mediterranean, showing a water temperature-associated gonadal cycle that culminates {{at the end of the}} summer in contrast to the findings in the Adriatic, where the coral has described as hermaphroditic with the spawning occurring at the beginning of the summer. Global change is rapidly altering Mediterranean marine habitats, primarily through warming and the invasion of new species. The C. caespitosa population in the Illa Grossa Bay suffered mortalities after 9 summers, separated into 2 mortality periods (2003 - 2006 and 2008 - 2012). The highest necrosis rates were recorded during the first mortality period, after the exceptionally hot summer of 2003. Over 50 % of the area covered by C. caespitosa has suffered necrosis after these recurrent mortalities, which were significantly related to warming (summer warming trend: 0. 06 °C yr- 1). The differences in necrosis found after summers with similar thermal anomalies pointed out to the existence of other acting factors probably related to the interannual temperature context and delayed stress after extreme summers. These results show that while <b>Cladocora</b> caespitosa displays great ecological plasticity, mostly in relation to changing light conditions, it is not adapted to endure the extreme changes in temperature driven by climate change, the most worrying threat for this coral. Regarding to the impact of invasive species, the invasive algae Lophocladia lallemandii and Caulerpa racemosa successfully spread over the Illa Grossa Bay from 2006 to 2012 and overlapped their distribution in the bay with that of C. caespitosa. No lethal effects of the invasive algae were detected on the coral colonies, which showed toxic activity. This may explain the low overgrowth of living colony parts by C. racemosa and the ability of this coral to compete in an algal dominated community. In long-lived corals such as C. caespitosa, recovery from mortalities relies mostly on recruitment, but there are two main obstacles that may compromise recovery. Firstly, the high frequency of mortalities detected during the last decade probably exceed the recovery potential of the low recruitment rates. Secondly, both warming and invasive algae may have delayed and synergetic effects on reproduction, recruitment and juvenile survival. All the results obtained highlight the endangerment of this species facing rapid environmental changes. <b>Cladocora</b> caespitosa is listed in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species as Data Deficient. However, the information obtained in this PhD points out that this species could meet the criteria to fall into a threatened category. Los ecosistemas marinos están siendo amenazados por un número cada vez mayor de impactos. Entre ellos, los impactos derivados del cambio global han puesto en relieve la necesidad de nuevas medidas de conservación que puedan complementar a las ya existentes. Sin embargo, su desarrollo requiere un amplio conocimiento de las especies, procesos e impactos implicados. Esta tesis se centra en la adquisición de nuevos conocimientos sobre la biología y ecología del coral <b>Cladocora</b> caespitosa con el objetivo de aportar información útil para su conservación. Los resultados obtenidos pueden servir como guía para la conservación de aquellas especies de características parecidas sobre las que no se tiene información. Esta especie es el único coral escleractinio, colonial y zooxantelado, endémico del Mediterráneo. Se trata de uno de los pocos ejemplos de especie longeva y estructural que se encuentra en las comunidades mediterráneas de aguas someras. La Bahía de L'Illa Grossa (Reserva Marina de las Islas Columbretes) alberga una de las poblaciones más importantes de este coral, con campos de colonias y arrecifes que muestran una superficie acumulada de 2900 m 2. Los resultados obtenidos muestran que se trata de una especie de lento crecimiento, con bajas tasas de reclutamiento y mortalidad natural y que muestra importantes divergencias en sus características reproductoras entre el Mediterráneo Occidental y el Adriático. La población de C. caespitosa de Columbretes ha sufrido mortalidades recurrentes asociadas al calentamiento del agua, que han afectado a más de la mitad del área ocupada por este coral en la bahía. Por otra parte, las algas invasoras Lophocladia lallemandii y Caulerpa racemosa han invadido exitosamente la Bahía de L'Illa Grossa, solapando su distribución con la de C. caespitosa. De momento, no se han observado efectos letales de estas algas sobre el coral; sin embargo, se ha podido detectar la actividad tóxica de esta especie, que podría explicar el bajo recubrimiento de sus partes vivas por C. racemosa. El potencial de recuperación de esta población es limitado dado el bajo reclutamiento y la frecuencia e intensidad de las mortalidades. Además, no se pueden descartar efectos subletales del calentamiento y las algas invasoras sobre la reproducción, reclutamiento y la supervivencia de los juveniles. A partir de esta información esta especie podría cumplir los criterios de la UICN para ser catalogada como especie en peligro...|$|E

Here, we identify this association in O. patagonica from the Western Mediterranean but not in C. caespitosa, suggesting some differences in symbiotic combinations between the Western and Eastern Mediterranean Basins...|$|E
40|$|Atmospheric CO 2 partial {{pressure}} (p CO 2) {{is expected to}} increase to 700 μatm or more {{by the end of the}} present century. Anthropogenic CO 2 is absorbed by the oceans, leading to decreases in pH and the CaCO 3 saturation state (Ω) of the seawater. Elevated p CO 2 was shown to drastically decrease calcification rates in tropical zooxanthellate corals. Here we show, using the Mediterranean zooxanthellate coral <b>Cladocora</b> caespitosa, that an increase in p CO 2, in the range predicted for 2100, does not reduce its calcification rate. Therefore, the conventional belief that calcification rates will be affected by ocean acidification may not be widespread in temperate corals. Seasonal change in temperature is the predominant factor controlling photosynthesis, respiration, calcification and symbiont density. An increase in p CO 2, alone or in combination with elevated temperature, had no significant effect on photosynthesis, photosynthetic efficiency and calcification. The lack of sensitivity C. caespitosa to elevated p CO 2 might be due to its slow growth rates, which seem to be more dependent on temperature than on the saturation state of calcium carbonate in the range projected for the end of the century...|$|E
40|$|This study {{quantified}} {{variation in}} net photosynthetic carbon gain {{in response to}} natural fluctuations in symbiont density for the Mediterranean coral <b>Cladocora</b> caespitosa, and evaluated which density maximized photosynthetic carbon acquisition. To do this, carbon acquisition was modeled as an explicit function of symbiont density. The model was parameterized using measurements of rates of photosynthesis and respiration for small colonies with {{a broad range of}} zooxanthella concentrations. Results demonstrate that rates of net photosynthesis increase asymptotically with symbiont density, whereas rates of respiration increase linearly. In combination, these functional responses meant that colony energy acquisition decreased at both low and at very high zooxanthella densities. However, there was a wide range of symbiont densities for which net daily photosynthesis was approximately equivalent. Therefore, significant changes in symbiont density do not necessarily cause a change in autotrophic energy acquisition by the colony. Model estimates of the optimal range of cell densities corresponded well with independent observations of symbiont concentrations obtained from field and laboratory studies of healthy colonies. Overall, this study demonstrates that the seasonal fluctuations, in symbiont numbers observed in healthy colonies of the Mediterranean coral investigated, do not have a strong effect on photosynthetic energy acquisition...|$|E

40|$|<b>Cladocora</b> caespitosa (L., 1767) is the {{principal}} endemic bioconstructor coral of the Mediterranean Sea. Despite recent episodes of mortality have been documented all over the Mediterranean and a significant knowledge about the ecology, paleoecology and conservation status of this species exists, no description of its phylogeny and phylogeography is available. In order to supply this information, essential for any conservation plan, the genetic variability of some populations of C. caespitosa, collected in the northern Mediterranean Sea, has been evaluated. A 790 bp fragment of the ribosomal DNA has been amplified and cloned prior to sequencing. The genetic variability has been estimated at intraindividual, intraspecific and interspecific levels. An elevated degree of intraindividual polymorphism has been detected, but {{the presence of a}} clear phylogenetic divergence with the congener species excludes the retention of ancient phylogenetic lines, predating the origin of the species. At the intraspecific level more clades are described, yet the presence of a significant spatial genetic structure is excluded. The data also suggest a recent demographic expansion. Patterns of isolation due to biogeographic barriers within the Mediterranean Sea do not currently appear consistent for C. caespitosa, although the presence of past vicariance events is likely. This can be justified hypothesizing wide phenomena of secondary gene flow, following past divergences in few refugia area...|$|E
40|$|High-resolution {{stable isotope}} {{analysis}} of coral skeletons is an established method to help reconstruct seawater growth temperatures for palaeoenvironmental reconstructions. Here we investigated the temperate, colonial, Mediterranean scleractinian coral <b>Cladocora</b> caespitosa. We first studied modern Adriatic corals from Mljet (Croatia) where growth temperatures were known. A clear sinusoidal cyclicity {{is present in}} the d 18 O of the modern coral skeletons with average cycle minima 3. 3 ‰ and average maxima 1. 6 ‰. Cyclicity approximately matches the number of seasonal growth band pairs in each sample, implying a genetic link between d 18 O cyclicity and factors that determine seasonal growth band development, here mainly water temperature. A derived and calibrated species-specific d 18 O–temperature relationship was then used to reconstruct growth temperatures from fossil C. caespitosa. This was applied to well-preserved material collected from late Pleistocene deposits (MIS 1, 5 and 7) around the Gulf of Corinth, Greece. Clear seasonal d 18 O signals are seen in all the fossil samples. MIS 5 e was the warmest period studied with a lower than modern seasonal temperature range. The Early to mid-Holocene probably experienced the lowest temperatures while conditions in MIS 7 a/c were probably the wettest with most freshwater input into the Gulf...|$|E
40|$|This paper uses a {{combination}} of geomorphological and radiometric data from the northern coast of the Gargano promontory (comprising the Fortore River coastal plain and Punta delle Pietre Nere) to reconstruct Holocene uplift rates. The coastal plain consists of a sandy progradational beach sequence that extends seawards {{from the base of}} a relict cliff. This cliff probably marks the maximum position reached by the Holocene transgression. Altimetric data compared with the age of beach deposits and the available eustatic sea-level curves indicate an average Holocene uplift rate of 1. 5 mm yr(- 1). A similar uplift rate has been estimated by dating a bioherm constituted of calcareous algae, Vermetids and subordinately by <b>Cladocora</b> caespitosa (L.), which crops out in the locality of Punta delle Pietre Nere. This deposit, which was previously assigned an interglacial age, yielded a mid-Holocene age by means of Th/U and C- 14 age determinations. Our observations also reveal evidence for coseismic deformation along the northern coast of the Gargano promontory during the last millennium. Vertical displacements of > 0. 5 m have affected the Punta delle Pietre Nere coastal block, and were preceded by periods of slow coastal subsidence, which increased rapidly shortly before a major earthquake.

40|$|The Mediterranean endemic {{scleractinian coral}} <b>Cladocora</b> caespitosa (L., 1767) has been {{recently}} {{included in the}} IUCN Red List as an endangered species. In this context, information on the species is urgently required to further assess its status and to determine its distribution area. This study reports on the main traits of a recently discovered C. caespitosa population in Formentera (Balearic Islands, W Mediterranean). Here, coral colonies live wrapped in Cystoseira forests thriving on rocky substrata (5 - 13 m depth), thus being a new example of the ability of C. caespitosa to build up extensive populations within algal communities. Even though coral cover reaches ~ 20 % on average, which is a remarkable figure for this species, colonies are generally small (~ 10 cm diameter on average), most probably due to partial exposure to waves and currents. The combination of hydrodynamics {{and the presence of}} algal forests in the studied site could be responsible for the high occurrence of a rare type of colony growth: free-living coral nodules or coralliths. This population is highly interesting for future monitoring owing to its unique traits, the absence of necrosis signs related to past mortality events, and its location inside a marine reserv...|$|E

New morphostratigraphic data from La Marina (eastem Spain) supported by open-system U-series coral ages {{shed light on the}} maximum sea level duríng OIS 7. Fossil corals (<b>Cladocora</b> Caespitosa) underlying an OIS 5 e marine unít yielded U-series ages from 178 ± (0 to 208 ± 1) ka (± 20 σ n= 7) with an outlier al 240 ± 18 ka. Mean open-system limit ages of 170 ± 10 (minimum age after correction for 234 Th- 230 Th uptake) and 237 ± 20 ka (maximum ase after correction for 238 U - 234 U uptake) were calculated to have a probable age closer to the minimum value, for an assignment of OlS 7 a or 7 c. The occurrence of a warn-water "Senegalese" fauna (Strombus bubonius) in OIS 5 e and OIS 7 marine units confirms the arrival of tropical species to the Mediterranean before the last interglacial periodo Morpho-sedimentological and neotectonic studies suggest that the maximum paleo-sea level during OIS 7 c or 7 a was a few melers below that of OlS Se...|$|E
40|$|AbstractDuring an {{expedition}} in 2014 in the Gulf of Gabes that aimed {{to evaluate the}} impact of the pollution of the phosphate industry on the marine environment, numerous dead coral fragments were retrieved from several stations along a 18 km long transect in front of the industry complex of Gabes. Detailed taxonomy of these coral fragments shows clearly that all fragments belong to the species <b>Cladocora</b> caespitosa (Linnaeus, 1758). Quantitative analysis of the coral fragments indicates a positive correlation with stations characterized by positive bathymetric anomalies. We suggest the presence of probable small-scaled (up to 4 m high) biogenic (palaeo-) build-ups composed mainly of coral colonies and bryozoans. Radiocarbon dating of three coral fragments show ages as old as 1897, 1985 and 1986 AD and suggests the presence of living C. caespitosa as close as 6 km to the phosphate treatment industry of Gabes at least until 1986 AD. This latter age coincides with the construction of the ammonium phosphate production plant, in 1979, in the Gulf of Gabes with an increase of the natural phosphate production. The higher impact of pollution on the marine environment in the inner part of the Gulf of Gabes likely induced the decline of C. caespitosa. This is well in agreement with enhanced siltation processes suggested by the sedimentary facies and grain-size analyses presently characterizing the Gulf of Gabes nowadays...|$|E
