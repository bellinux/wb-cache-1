40|$|Abstract__ __Background__ The Camp <b>COOL</b> <b>programme</b> aims to {{help young}} Dutch people with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) develop {{self-management}} skills. Fellow patients already treated in adult care (hereafter referred to as ‘buddies’) organise the day-to-day program, run the camp, counsel the attendees, and also participate in the activities. The attendees are young people who still have to transfer to adult care. This study aimed to explore {{the effects of this}} specific form of peer-to-peer support on the self-management of young people (16 – 25 years) with ESRD who participated in Camp COOL (CC) (hereafter referred to as ‘participants’). __Methods__ A mixed methods research design was employed. Semi-structured interviews (n = 19) with initiators/staff, participants, and healthcare professionals were conducted. These were combined with retrospective and pre-post surveys among participants (n = 62), and observations during two camp weeks. __Results__ Self-reported effects of participants were: increased self-confidence, more disease-related knowledge, feeling capable of being more responsible and open towards others, and daring to stand up for yourself. According to participants, being a buddy or having one positively affected them. Self-efficacy of attendees and independence of buddies increased, while attendees’ sense of social inclusion decreased (measured as domains of health-related quality of life). The buddy role was a pro-active combination of being supervisor, advisor, and leader. __Conclusions__ Camp COOL allowed young people to support each other in adjusting to everyday life with ESRD. Participating in the camp positively influenced self-management in this group. Peerto- peer support through buddies was much appreciated. Support from young adults was not only beneficial for adolescent attendees, but also for young adult buddies. Paediatric nephrologists are encouraged to refer patients to CC and to facilitate such initiatives. Together with nephrologists in adult care, they could take on a role in selecting buddies...|$|R

The group was composed of experts from the Solar Heating and <b>Cooling</b> (SHC) <b>Programme,</b> Task 12 Subtask B, and the Energy Conservation in Buildings and Community Systems (BCS) Programme, Annex 21 Subtask C. Recognizing that the needs for model evaluation were similar in both IEA programmes, the combined Experts Group was approved by the Executive Committees in 1990. This is the first joint group organized by the respective IEA Executive Committees, and it has resulted in significant cost savings for all participating countries. The objective of this subtask has been to develop practical implementation procedures and data for an overall IEA validation methodology which has been under development by NREL since 1981, with refinements contributed by the United Kingdom. The methodology consists of a combination of empirical validation, analytical verification, and comparative analysis techniques. This report documents a comparative testing and diagnostic procedure for thermal models related to the architectural fabric of the building. Other projects (reported elsewhere) conducted by this group include work on empirical validation, analytical verification, and comparative test cases for commercial buildings. In the BESTEST project, a method was developed for systematically testing whole-building energy simulation programs and diagnosing the sources of predictive disagreement. Field trials of the method were conducted with a number of {open_quotes}reference{close_quotes} programs selected by the participants to represent the best state-of-the-art detailed simulation capability available in the United States and Europe.

40|$|Introduction and {{background}} Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is the UK’s most common genetically inherited life limiting condition, which currently affects around 700 people in Scotland (CF Trust 2002). The condition {{is caused by}} a gene defect and affects primarily the lungs and digestive system. Children with CF become aware that they are different from their peers, they can be small and thin as puberty usually comes late, there is often a chronic cough and lung function is substantially reduced causing restricted energy levels. Issues relating to cross infection make peer support problematic for this group. In addition, treatments and self care behaviours are substantial, time consuming and add to social isolation due to regular hospitalisation, and absences from school. Consequently this group often need practical and emotional support that would not normally be required in this age group, (Hodson et al 1993). Rationale for the study The Butterfly Trust was set up in 2002 to support sufferers and families with CF. In November 2004 the Trust was awarded funding to establish a befriending programme for children with CF in Lothian (aged 8 - 18) with the intention of mentoring and supporting, relieving stress and boredom, improving self confidence, and enhancing general well being. The existing programme was developed in partnership with the CF community nurses at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children (RHSC). Aims and Methods The purpose of our study was to evaluate the impact of The Butterfly Trust’s befriending <b>programme</b> (<b>Cool</b> Friends) on: Young people’s self esteem, empowerment and independence Issues such as boredom and social isolation when young people are at home and in hospital.

40|$|Industry {{agree on}} a common {{methodology}} to calculate the installed capacity of solar thermal collectors The International Energy Agency’s Solar Heating and <b>Cooling</b> <b>Programme</b> (IEA SHC) and several major solar thermal trade associations agreed upon a methodology to present the installed capacity of solar collectors in GWth.

The definition that was chosen is similar to that for photovoltaic modules. A detailed description of the method is given in the technical note referenced below. Because the conversion factor is nearly the same for all collector types, it was decided to use one factor that is 0. 7 kWth per m 2 of solar collector area for all collector types.

40|$|The Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment (MICE) is {{the first}} {{technical}} demonstration of muon ionization cooling, using a prototype section of a Neutrino Factory cooling channel. MICE is currently under construction at the Rutherford-Appleton Laboratory in the UK and will make the first cooling measurements in 2015, in Step IV of the experimental <b>programme.</b> <b>Cooling</b> predictions in Monte Carlo simulations of Step IV were found to disagree with the predictions of the 'cooling formula', a widely-used approximation, by up to 30 % in liquid hydrogen (LH 2). This disagreement was shown to originate, largely, from the multiple scattering expression used in the cooling formula. It was necessary {{to go back to}} the fundamental physics of scattering to derive a more accurate expression that includes scattering from atomic electrons. A modified form of the cooling formula was derived using this expression and gave better agreement with the Monte Carlo in LH 2. Predictions are given for the equilibrium emittance, using the new expression, for seven low Z materials at muon momenta of 140, 200 and 240 MeV/ c. Theories which predict the distribution of multiple scattering angles are briefly reviewed, focusing on Moliere theory and its variants, which are the most widely-used theories. The distributions predicted by these theories are used in most Monte Carlo codes but their implementation is not transparent, especially regarding the treatment of scatters with atomic electrons, which are important in low Z materials. A simple Monte Carlo model to predict multiple scattering distributions was developed that correctly treats scatters off electrons. The model gives very good agreement with measurements by the MuScat Experiment. Investigations were made into the possibility of measuring multiple scattering in MICE Step IV, both with and without the magnetic field. Preliminary results suggest that measurements are easier with no magnetic field, where tracks are straight. Corrections to account for the resolution of the scintillating-fibre trackers are required in both cases, but these are substantially smaller when straight tracks are used.

Nonetheless, solar technologies have not been widely used in the built environment, limiting their operation to industrial and macroscale applications. Commercially available products such as building integrated PV panels (BIPV) or building integrated solar thermal collectors (BIST); and novel prototypes and concepts for solar cooling integrated facades are seen as interesting alternatives for the development of new performance based façade components for high-performing commercial buildings. However, there are barriers to overcome in order to promote widespread application of architecturally integrated solar components. The present paper seeks to discuss perceived barriers for widespread façade integration of solar technologies, in order to define the current scenario and generate guidelines for future developments. In order to achieve this, the paper presents the results of a survey addressed to professionals with practical experience in the development of façade systems for office buildings, situated at any stage of the design and construction process. Hence, architects, façade consultants, system suppliers and façade builders were considered.
