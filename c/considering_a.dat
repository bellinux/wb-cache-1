5|$|Governments {{around the}} world are <b>considering</b> <b>a</b> range of waste {{management}} and disposal options, usually involving deep-geologic placement, although there has been limited progress toward implementing long-term waste management solutions. This is partly because the timeframes in question when dealing with radioactive waste range from 10,000 to millions of years, according to studies based on the effect of estimated radiation doses.|$|E
5|$|In 1897, Crowley {{travelled}} to St Petersburg in Russia, later {{claiming that}} he was trying to learn Russian as he was <b>considering</b> <b>a</b> future diplomatic career there.

5|$|In mathematics, {{constructions of}} {{mathematical}} objects are needed, {{which is also}} the case for stochastic processes, to prove that they exist mathematically. There are two main approaches for constructing a stochastic process. One approach involves <b>considering</b> <b>a</b> measurable space of functions, defining a suitable measurable mapping from a probability space to this measurable space of functions, and then deriving the corresponding finite-dimensional distributions.|$|E
5|$|Speaking in 1994, Pintilie {{indicated}} that he was <b>considering</b> <b>a</b> sequel to the film, also based on Dumitriu's writings. Planned for 1996, it was to depict an aging and jealous Marie-Thérèse, who intervenes in her son's love life and chases away women who fancy him.|$|E
5|$|A major {{accomplishment}} of the Johnson administration was {{the passage of}} a legislative redistricting bill. Despite the fact that the U.S. Constitution requires redistricting after every decennial census, Kentucky's legislative districts had remained virtually unchanged between 1893 and 1941. He asked the 1942 legislative session to adjourn early so he could call a special session {{for the sole purpose of}} <b>considering</b> <b>a</b> redistricting bill.

In May 1958, York also began working with Lincoln Labs, MIT's radar research lab, to begin researching ways to distinguish warheads from decoys by radar or other means. This project emerged as the Pacific Range Electromagnetic Signature Studies, or Project PRESS.|$|E

A member of the team's starting lineup, he averaged 17.2 points and 6.0 rebounds and won league MVP accolades although his team finished with a poor record. During the season, he was benched without pay for multiple games for missing practice.|$|E

Archie Cameron, an old wartime friend of Playford's and a federal Coalition MP, influenced Playford {{to run for office}} when he heard of the merger. In 1932 the Liberal and Country League (LCL) was created, and Playford ran for the multi-member constituency of Murray at the 1933 election.|$|E

5|$|Beavers, rodents {{weighing}} up to , have sometimes caused problems along Fanno Creek. In 2014 and 2015, a growing population of beavers gnawed down trees and dammed the creek in Greenway Park in Beaverton. Rising waters have covered {{one of the}} side trails in the park, which has been gated and closed. During heavy rains, water from the beaver pond sometimes covers the main trail. Park officials are <b>considering</b> <b>a</b> variety of options, including re-routing the trails, building a boardwalk over the water, or removing the beaver dams.|$|E

5|$|During his studies, Wheeler had {{developed}} {{his love of}} archaeology, having joined an excavation of Viroconium Cornoviorum, a Romano-British settlement in Wroxeter, in 1913. <b>Considering</b> <b>a</b> profession in the discipline, he won a studentship that had been established jointly by the University of London and the Society of Antiquaries in memory of Augustus Wollaston Franks. The prominent archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans doubled {{the amount of money}} that went with the studentship. Wheeler's proposed project had been to analyse Romano-Rhenish pottery, and with the grant he funded a trip to the Rhineland in Germany, there studying the Roman pottery housed in local museums; his research into this subject was never published.|$|E
5|$|Following the Soviet Union's {{successful}} {{nuclear test}} in August 1949, the U.S. was <b>considering</b> <b>a</b> crash course {{to develop a}} hydrogen bomb. The AEC's nine-member General Advisory Committee, chaired by J.

Smyth urged Truman to endorse international control of nuclear weapons, but Truman decided instead to authorize a hydrogen bomb program. In his autobiography, Smyth's Princeton colleague John Archibald Wheeler recalled that Smyth recruited him to the Ivy Mike hydrogen bomb project and expressed support for the project in response to the Soviet test.|$|E
5|$|Greater Manchester, United Kingdom, was <b>considering</b> <b>a</b> scheme {{with two}} cordons, one {{covering}} the main urban {{core of the}} Greater Manchester Urban Area and another covering the Manchester city centre. The measure {{was supported by the}} government, but three local authorities rejected it (Bury, Trafford and Stockport); the support of two-thirds of Manchester's 10 local councils was needed for it to be implemented. A comprehensive transport investment package for Manchester, which included the congestion pricing element, was released for further public consultation and was to be subject of a referendum in December 2008. On 12 December 2008 the scheme was overwhelmingly rejected by 10 out of 10 councils by a public referendum.|$|E
