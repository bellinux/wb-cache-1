40|$|Register <b>clashes</b> are a {{linguistic}} phenomenon {{that occurs in}} both real and fictional interaction. This study, based on the theory of register as developed by Halliday, examines the functions of register <b>clashes</b> in the television drama series Gilmore Girls. It was hypothesized that the function of register <b>clashes</b> is to create humor, to characterize some characters on the show as sophisticated and witty and some others as lacking in communicative competence, or what is popularly referred to as geeky or nerdy, {{as well as to}} characterize the show. A total of 1, 306 cases of register <b>clashes</b> were identified, of which 761 cases (58. 3 percent) were clear cases and 545 cases (41. 7 percent) were somewhat more doubtful. Nearly all cases of register <b>clashes</b> found were considered to have been used to create humor. Eight out of the ten most productive characters with respect to the utterance of register <b>clashes</b> were found to be characterized as witty; the other two characters produced register <b>clashes</b> in a way that characterized them as geeky. Each of the six episodes examined in this study was found to contain many instances of register <b>clashes,</b> regardless of the fact that each was written by a different author. The results thus suggest that the function of register <b>clashes</b> in Gilmore Girls is indeed to create humor, to characterize the characters, and to characterize the show...|$|R
