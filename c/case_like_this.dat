25|$|It {{may occur}} that systems of {{coordinates}} for two {{different sets of}} geometric figures are equivalent {{in terms of their}} analysis. An example of this is the systems of homogeneous coordinates for points and lines in the projective plane. The two systems in a <b>case</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> are said to be dualistic. Dualistic systems have the property that results from one system can be carried over to the other since these results are only different interpretations of the same analytical result; this is known as the principle of duality.|$|E
25|$|VAM Gremlins {{used the}} updated body {{design of the}} U.S. and Canadian market AMC Spirit two-door sedan, as well as VAM {{versions}} of the Spirit Liftback, called the American GT and the Rally AMX. At the time, cars in Mexico took longer {{to be perceived as}} outdated than in the US and since the VAM Gremlin came to the public until 1974 instead of 1970, it was still relatively fresh among the Mexican buyers. Aside from this, the model kept a positive image throughout its whole run. In fact, it exceeded VAM's sales expectations in its first years. The company originally considered it a temporary low-volume model that would eventually be replaced by the upcoming Pacer model. In the end, the Gremlin stood and became VAM's all-time second best-selling line after the American. For these reasons VAM decided to keep the Gremlin name for the upcoming Spirit sedan model, being a testament of the very favorable image VAM cars in general held in Mexico. This was the third time a <b>case</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> happened within the company with Rebel and Matador models kept the name Rambler Classic and the Hornet the Rambler American name.|$|E

2500|$|A {{legal team}} led by Julian Miles QC, media lawyer Steven Price, and {{barrister}} Felix Geiringer gathered round Nicky Hager, who is seeking a judicial review of the police action. Steven Price said [...] "Our case will be that the police didn't properly consider Nicky Hager's right to protect his confidential sources". Commenting on the case, law professor Ursula Cheer said: [...] "We've never really had a <b>case</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> before and we've never really had any of these (public interest) issues tested." ...|$|E
2500|$|After an {{extensive}} analysis finding that truthful trial testimony was protected speech, which culminating in find a genuine factual dispute {{on the issue}} and thus overturning the summary judgement initially granted by the district court, Flaum echoed one of Scalia's criticisms in a footnote. [...] "Waters provides little direct guidance as to {{the division of labor}} between judge and jury in a <b>case</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> one," [...] he observed. [...] "The critical question that, to this point, remains unanswered requires an assessment of the defendants' subjective motivation, a classic jury issue." ...|$|E
2500|$|Justice Thomas dissented. Justice Thomas {{criticized the}} court's {{determination}} of jurisdiction, arguing that [...] "he {{far more likely}} explanation for the [...] denial of habeas relied is that Foster's claim is procedurally barred ... a question of state law that [...] is powerless to review." [...] Justice Thomas notes that historically the Supreme Court would vacate and remand for clarification before proceeding to the merits of a <b>case</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> and [...] "refuse to presume that the unexplained denial of relief by the Supreme Court of Georgia presents a federal question." [...] Justice Thomas then proceeded to reject the court's analysis of the Batson claim.|$|E

"In {{the final}} analysis," [...] he wrote, [...] "a Justice's {{vote in a}} <b>case</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> depends more {{on his or her}} views about the {{respective}} lawmaking responsibilities of Congress and this Court than on conflicting policy interests. Judges who have confidence in their own ability to fashion public policy are less hesitant to change the law than {{those of us who are}} inclined to give wide latitude to the views of the voters' representatives on nonconstitutional matters." [...] While he had admittedly helped start the discussions about the various interpretations of Wilko in his dissent in Scherk v. Alberto-Culver, Inc. while chief judge of the Seventh Circuit, he said [...] "one of these arguments, however, carries sufficient weight to tip the balance between judicial and legislative authority and overturn an interpretation of an Act of Congress that has been settled for many years." ...|$|E
