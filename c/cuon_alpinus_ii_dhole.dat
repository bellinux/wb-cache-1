40|$|This master thesis {{focuses on}} {{thirteen}} Canidae hemimandibles fished {{from the bottom}} of the North Sea (Southern Bight) of which it remains to be established whether they belong to Canis lupus lupus (Eurasian wolf), Canis lupus familiaris (domestic dog) or <b>Cuon</b> <b>alpinus</b> (dhole). Of one hemimandible in particular (NMR 90, a recently found posterior half of an extremely small jaw (with P 4 and M 1) of estimated Late Pleistocene age) is suspected, due to its apparent small size and dental formula, that it most probably belongs to neither wolf nor dog (nor fox, which is considerably smaller), but to <b>Cuon</b> <b>alpinus</b> (Dick Mol pers. comm.). If this mandible were of <b>Cuon</b> <b>alpinus</b> origin, this would be the westernmost occurrence of <b>Cuon</b> <b>alpinus,</b> which is certainly a novelty for Dutch paleontology. The aim of this study was to identify the thirteen fossil North Sea specimens as wolf, dog or dhole and thereby verifying whether <b>Cuon</b> <b>alpinus</b> was a member of the carnivore guild of Northwestern Europe during the Late Pleistocene. The thirteen fossil North Sea specimens were identified by means of morphological and osteometrical comparison with comparative datasets of Canis lupus lupus (18 specimens), Canis lupus familiaris (42 specimens) and <b>Cuon</b> <b>alpinus</b> (27 specimens). All 100 Canidae specimens were measured for 21 parameters concerning hemimandibular and teeth dimensions. Additionally to all quantitative measurements, the fossil specimens were qualitatively compared to all three comparative (sub) species. Statistics (standard deviations) were applied to add a confidence interval of 97. 7 % to the conclusions that are based on the quantitative parameters. Keeping in mind that results may have been affected by: the representability of this particular comparative dataset for the C. l. lupus, C. l. familiaris and <b>Cuon</b> <b>alpinus</b> populations of Northwestern Europe during the Pleistocene (with respect to subspecies, locality, age and sex), differences between left and right hemimandibles, measuring errors, the normal distribution of parameters, values from literature and possible sexual dimorphism, this morphological and osteometrical study of the comparative Canidae material with the thirteen fossil North Sea specimens has allowed us to identify these fossil hemimandibles as belonging to the genus Canis. So far there is no evidence that <b>Cuon</b> <b>alpinus</b> was a member of the Mammoth Steppe Fauna...|$|R

50|$|Despite {{their great}} strength, the tigers usually did not stand their ground against the dogs unless cornered, much preferring to retreat. It was theorised {{that this is}} due to the tiger mistaking the dogs for dholes (<b>Cuon</b> <b>alpinus),</b> which have been known to kill tigers on rare occasions.|$|R
5000|$|Paleontologist George G. Simpson placed L. pictus in the {{subfamily}} Simocyoninae, {{along with}} <b>Cuon</b> <b>alpinus</b> and Speothos venaticus, {{on the basis}} of all three species having similarly trenchant carnassials. This grouping was disputed by Juliet Clutton-Brock, who argued that, other than dentition, there were too few similarities between the three species to warrant classifying them in a single subfamily. The species' molecular genetics indicate that, although it is far removed from the genus Canis, it is nonetheless more closely related to it than to other canid lineages. Phylogenetic studies place L. pictus and <b>Cuon</b> <b>alpinus</b> into a clade of [...] "wolf-like canids" [...] alongside the extant members of the Canis genus, including C. simensis, C. aureus, C. latrans, C. lupus and the more basal C. adustus and C. mesomelas.|$|R

50|$|The Noisetier {{site has}} yielded more than 10,000 fossils of large animals and an {{additional}} 80,000 determinable remains of small rodents.Dominant are mountain species, especially chamois (Rupicapra pyrenaica) and ibex (Capra pyrenaica pyrenaica) followed by deer and large bovines. Moderate amounts of carnivore fossils of cave bear (Ursus spelaeus), red fox (Vulpes vulpes), leopard and dhole (<b>Cuon</b> <b>alpinus)</b> are documented.|$|R
50|$|The Ussuri dhole (<b>Cuon</b> <b>alpinus</b> alpinus), {{also known}} as the Indian wild dog, Eastern Asiatic dhole or Chinese dhole is a {{subspecies}} of dhole native to East Asia. It is widespread in the Indian subcontinent and the Indochinese Peninsula. The Ussuri dhole is also native to China, however it is probably extinct in most of its ranges in China, as well as in Mongolia and the Russian Far East.|$|R
50|$|Notable {{animals are}} Asian {{elephant}} (Elephas maximus), western hoolock gibbon (Hylobates hoolock), Phayre's leaf monkey (Trachypithecus phayrei), capped leaf monkey (Trachypithecus pileatus), dholes (<b>Cuon</b> <b>alpinus),</b> wild boar (Sus scrofa), sambar (Cervus unicolor), barking deer (Muntiacus muntjak), clouded leopard (Neofelis nebulosa), rock python (Python molurus), etc. Among these, elephants, clouded leopards and dholes are critically endangered species of Bangladesh. Although elephants and gibbons are fairly common, dholes and sambars are very rare.|$|R
50|$|A taphonomic survey {{concluded}} distinct {{types of}} large animal bone accumulations by different agents. Red deer (Cervus elaphus) and bovine fossils with butchery marks are extremely abundant while carnivore marks are rare. No deer bone is digested while {{nearly half of}} the bones show human interference. Neanderthals account for most of the deer and the bovines and a sizable portion of the chamois and ibex fossils, some of them were secondly scavenged by carnivores.. The survey also allows to favor the hypothesis of extraction by Neanderthals of the fat contained in the spongy tissues of deer bones. In chamois assemblages, 482 fossils were investigated and the non-human predation marks interpreted. Bearded vultures (Gypaetus barbatus), that must have occupied the site during Neanderthal's absence accumulated a high percentage of the chamois bones and to a lower degree those of ibex. Dhole (<b>Cuon</b> <b>alpinus)</b> teeth and bones are the most numerous among carnivores. Milk teeth suggest that <b>Cuon</b> <b>alpinus</b> sheltered its offspring at the site. A 2013 study concluded that dholes contributed to the present composition of animal fossils, to which extent remains debated.|$|R
50|$|Flagship species like Bengal tiger (Panthera tigris tigris), Indian bison or gaur (Bos gaurus) and Indian {{elephants}} (Elephas maximus indicus) {{are found}} in large numbers inside the park. A study carried out by Dr. Ullas Karanth of the Wildlife Conservation Society {{has shown that the}} forests of Nagarhole have three species of predators i.e. tiger, Indian leopard (Panthera pardus fusca) and Asiatic wild dogs (<b>Cuon</b> <b>alpinus</b> alpinus) present at an equivalent density (PA Update 2000).|$|R
50|$|Zoogeographically, the Reserve {{falls in}} Oriental region. The {{carnivore}} fauna {{is represented by}} the tiger (Panthera tigris), leopard (Panthera pardus), dhole (<b>Cuon</b> <b>alpinus),</b> jungle cat (Felis chaus), and small Indian civet (Viverricula indica). Wolves (Canis lupus) occur on the fringes and outside the Reserve limits. Striped hyena (Hyaena hyaena), sloth bear (Melursus ursinus), golden jackal (Canis aureus), and common palm civet (Paradoxurus hermaphroditus) make {{up the rest of the}} carnivore fauna of the Reserve.|$|R
50|$|The European dhole (<b>Cuon</b> <b>alpinus</b> europaeus) was a paleosubspecies of dhole which ranged {{throughout}} much of Western and Central Europe during the Middle and Late Pleistocene. Like the modern Asiatic populations, it was a more progressive form than other prehistoric members of the genera Cuon, having transformed its lower molar tooth into a single cusped slicer. It was virtually indistinguishable from its modern counterpart, save for its greater size, which closely approached that of the grey wolf.|$|R
50|$|The {{ecoregion}} {{is home to}} 110 {{species of}} mammals, none of which are endemic.

5000|$|Two canid {{species have}} common names {{specifically}} calling them wild dogs, but are entirely different species from the domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris): the African wild dog (Lycaon pictus), and the Indian wild dog (<b>Cuon</b> <b>alpinus),</b> more {{commonly known as}} the dhole. They are not closely related to each other nor to true dogs, and may be simply called [...] "wild dogs" [...] locally or when the species or geographical location is already known or implied.|$|R
50|$|Charles Darwin in his Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication, when {{discussing}} {{the origin of}} the domestic dog, mentions that Hodgson succeeded in taming the young of the race primaevus of the dhole or Indian wild dog (<b>Cuon</b> <b>alpinus),</b> and in making them as fond of him and as intelligent as ordinary dogs. Darwin also corresponded with Hodgson on the occurrence of dew-claws in the Tibetan mastiff, and obtained details of variations in the cattle, sheep, and goats of India.|$|R
