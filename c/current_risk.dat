40|$|The {{current study}} {{explored}} how Hurricane Katrina and consecutive flooding {{were covered by}} a mainstream news media organization [...] the New York Times. The {{purpose of the study}} was to see and analyze if the natural disaster of such magnitude as Hurricane Katrina increased the New York Times awareness of potential risks faced by the coastal area of the United States? Can the New York Times play a role of a social change agent helping the public realize risks and be more prepared for them in the future?The researcher conducted frame analysis and 3279 paragraphs were coded in the following categories: disaster aftermath, human interest, political, responsiveness, recovery, risk, science, damage, conflict, blame frame, and other. A chi-square test was used to test the hypotheses. The first hypothesis stated: "In disaster news coverage there will be more non-risk oriented stories rather than risk oriented stories" was accepted. The secondhypothesis stated: "In stories that have risk related information there will be more quotes from officials rather than experts" was rejected. The study of the first research question: "What kinds of risks have been covered in risk framed stories?" demonstrated that reporters tend to cover more dramatic risks rather than mundane ones. The study of the second research question: "Were the sources in stories about Hurricane Katrina being quoted on subjects appropriate to their expertise?" showed that sources used in the stories were quoted according to their expertise. The study of the third question: "What kind of <b>risk</b> awareness (<b>current</b> <b>risks)</b> and risk prevention (hypothetical risks) coverage is there in the New York Times?" revealed that reporters tend to provide more information on <b>current</b> <b>risks</b> (risk awareness) rather than information on how to prevent future risks.

5000|$|Risks {{in white}} water rafting stem from both {{environmental}} dangers and from improper behavior. Certain features on rivers are inherently unsafe and have remained consistently so despite {{the passage of}} time. These would include ‘keeper hydraulics’, ‘strainers’ (e.g. fallen trees), dams (especially low-head dams, which tend to produce river-wide keeper hydraulics), undercut rocks, and of course dangerously high waterfalls. Even in safe areas, however, moving water can always present risks—such as when a swimmer attempts to stand up on a rocky riverbed in strong <b>current,</b> <b>risking</b> foot entrapment. Irresponsible behavior related to rafting while intoxicated has also contributed to many accidents.|$|R
