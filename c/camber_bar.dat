40|$|Competitive {{wheelchair}} sport {{performance is}} dependent on three factors: the athlete, the wheelchair, and {{the interaction between the}} athlete and the wheelchair (Goosey-Tolfrey, 2010, "Supporting the Paralympic Athlete: Focus on Wheeled Sports," Disabil Rehabil., 32 (26), pp. 2237 - 2243). In order to effectively refine the user interphase design of the wheelchair, it is essential to narrow down the key dimensions within the design space, which are likely to {{have an effect on the}} performance of an individual athlete. This paper provides a case study analysis of the test data obtained from five elite wheelchair rugby athletes, using a purpose-built adjustable wheelchair on a wheelchair ergometer. Four design factors (wheel diameter, camber angle, seat height, and <b>camber</b> <b>bar</b> depth) were tested at incremental dimensional levels to the athlete's current chair configuration; and tests were performed according to an L 9 Taguchi orthogonal array. The case study analyzes acceleration, velocity, and time in the push phase of the propulsion cycle; as well as recovery time for each of the participating athletes performing a linear sprint task. The Taguchi method is applied to determining the positive/negative contribution of each of the four design factors to the outlined performance variables as well as their combined effect in a specific wheelchair configuration model. A performance ranking system and magnitude-based inferences on the true value of the effect statistic are used to define a high performance design space for individual athlete wheelchairs. Finally, the athlete's preferred ergonomics are considered to assess the narrowed high performance wheelchair options. As such, when adopting the approach presented in this paper, it becomes possible to customize an athlete's wheelchair design to meet the athlete's anthropometric needs as well as their performance requirements...|$|E
40|$|Athlete's biomechanic {{propulsion}} {{is affected}} by the design of the wheelchair. It is possible to improve an individual athlete's performance by varying the key design parameters of the wheelchair to accommodate the athlete's preferences and requirements. This is particularly relevant in elite Paralympics sports. In order to customise the mechanical design of the wheelchair in an effective and informed manner and for the individual user and performance requirements; it is essential that the potential design space encompassing all possible design variations is narrowed down to a near optimal set of design parameters for the individual athlete. In this paper, we approach this problem using the Taguchi method. Primarily, this paper aims to show the considerations involved in applying the Taguchi method to an application involving repetitive tests with human subjects; it also provides an analysis for individual results for the group of athletes tested. A group of five elite wheelchair rugby athletes performed five sets of the 14 m sprint test using a purpose built adjustable wheelchair on a wheelchair ergometer. Four design factors (A: Wheel diameter, B: Camber angle, C: Seat height and D: <b>Camber</b> <b>bar</b> depth) were each tested at different levels according to the standard L 9 orthogonal array. Performance variables of mean acceleration (axp), push velocity (Vp), cumulative velocity (Vc) and times (tp) of the push phase and recovery time (tr) were analysed. The Taguchi method is applied to determine the contribution of each factor to particular performance outputs. The results are used here to define the optimum design space for wheelchairs used by each athlete respectively. A minimum correlation coefficient r of 0. 294 was considered for assessment of significant factor effect on all performance variables. Significant factors levels and their possible combinations are used here to predict optimum performance. Near optimum combinations of design parameters are selected based on a defined performance parameter ranking and mechanistic and practical inferences on the true value of the effect statistic between factor levels. The best wheelchair design combinations are selected and assessed against athlete's feedback on comfort for final selection of the preferred design. By using the approach presented in this paper it is possible to customise the design of the wheelchair for particular performance requirements and athlete attributes...|$|E
40|$|The {{state of}} the art in current {{wheelchair}} sports equipment design, demonstrates a steady progression in the process of wheelchair design improvement and adaptation to purpose in order to suit different sporting disciplines and game roles. However, the process of tuning the design of the wheelchair to suit the particular needs of elite athletes in terms of performance and ergonomic requirements, currently requires a research and evidence-based design methodology. This investigation aims to: i) characterise the sports wheelchair activity, including performance variables and design parameters in relation to the three main classification groups of wheelchair rugby athletes (high, mid and low pointers); ii) investigate the rugby wheelchair performance indicators both under game and laboratory conditions and establish critical relationships between wheelchair design parameters and the performance requirements for elite wheelchair rugby athletes; iii) identify the relevant design space for design customisation of rugby wheelchairs for individual wheelchair rugby athletes and the contribution of each design parameter to athlete’s mobility performance; iv) formulate a systems design methodology for design customisation of rugby wheelchairs {{that can be used to}} determine a high performance wheelchair design that best matches the requirements of the individual athlete. In order to effectively refine the user interphase design of the wheelchair, it is essential to narrow down the key dimensions within the design space, that are likely to have an effect on the performance of an individual athlete. The methods developed and used throughout this thesis are grounded on a number of case studies built on analysis of the test data obtained from elite wheelchair rugby athletes who volunteer for this research project. Initially, the Qualitative Function Deployment (QFD) method is used to systematically analyse data collected through international online surveys, focus groups and questionnaires from elite level wheelchair rugby players. Subsequently, experimental studies conducted on court and in the laboratory yield significant relationships between wheelchair design parameters and task-specific performance functions. Four key design factors (wheel diameter, camber angle, seat height and <b>camber</b> <b>bar</b> depth) are then iterated at incremental dimensional levels to the athlete’s current chair configuration; and tests are performed and analysed through an new extension to the Taguchi method. Subsequent analyses of acceleration, velocity, and time in the push phase of the propulsion cycle, as well as recovery time for each of the participating athletes performing a linear sprint task are correlated to the positive/negative contribution of each of the four design factors to the outlined performance variables as well as their combined effect in a specific wheelchair configuration model. Performance rankings and magnitude-based inferences on the true value of the effect statistic are then used to define a high performance design space for athlete’s wheelchair selection. This process has led to the formulation of a systems design methodology for design customisation of sports wheelchairs, which can be used across the various sporting disciplines to customize wheelchairs that best meet the athlete&# 039;s needs in terms of performance and ergonomic requirements...|$|E

50|$|Simmons {{claims that}} he {{developed}} and invented Special barbell exercises {{that are used to}} target weaknesses in the competition lifts. Upper- and lower-body special exercises are rotated frequently (at least every 3 weeks) on the principle that training the same special exercise for too long will be counterproductive. The training system emphasizes the variety of special exercises. Different lifts can be performed, for example the good-morning instead of the squat. Competition lifts can be altered by increasing or decreasing the range of motion, e.g., squatting to a low or high box, performing partial range-of-motion bench presses, using wooden boards to shorten the stroke, or deadlifting from blocks or pins in a power cage. The conventional barbell can be replaced with specialty bars such as a <b>cambered</b> <b>bar,</b> safety squat bar, or Swiss bar. 'Accommodating' resistance, via equipment such as chains and bands, is also used.|$|R
