40|$|This paper {{presents}} a program analysis for secure information flow. The analysis {{works on a}} simple imperative programming language containing a cryptographic primitive [...] encryption [...] as a possible operation. The analysis captures the intuitive qualities of the (lack of) information flow from a plaintext to its corresponding <b>cryptotext.</b> The analysis is proven correct {{with respect to a}} complexity-theoretical definition of the security of information flow. The analysis does not put any restrictions on the structure of the program, especially on the ways of how the program uses the encryption keys...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA public-key {{cryptosystem}} {{based on}} iterated morphisms and substitutions {{was introduced in}} 1983 by Salomaa and Welzl. The present paper studies this system further. Finding a standard key, that is, finding a decryption key like the secret one used by the designer {{of the system is}} the preprocessing method one first thinks of. This approach is shown to lead to an NP-hard problem. The important aspect of growth of the <b>cryptotext</b> with respect to the plaintext is also discussed. A simple tool to guarantee polynomial growth is given. Finally, a natural extension of the system, intuitively increasing its security, is presented...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{security}} of individual bits in an RSA encrypted message EN (x). We show that given EN (x), predicting any single bit in x with only a non-negligible advantage over the trivial guessing strategy, is (through a polynomial time reduction) as hard as breaking RSA. Moreover, we prove that blocks of O(log log N) bits of x are computationally indistinguishable from random bits. The results carry over to the Rabin encryption scheme. Considering the discrete exponentiation function g x modulo p, with probability 1 -o(1) over random choices of the prime p, the analog results are demonstrated. Finally, we prove that the bits of ax+ b modulo p give hard core predicates for any one-way function f. 1 Introduction What is to be meant by a secure cryptosystem? There are rigorously defined notions, given by Goldwasser and Micali [14], such as semantic security; "whatever can be computed e#ciently from the <b>cryptotext</b> should also be computable without it".

40|$|The {{homomorphic}} {{property of}} the El Gamal cryptosystem is useful {{in the construction of}} efficient protocols. It is believed that only a small class of transformations of <b>cryptotexts</b> are feasible to compute.

40|$|The {{main goal}} of the article is to offer a {{description}} of cryptotexts of theatre staging handbooks and dramatic works created in Poland during the socialist realism period. A <b>cryptotext</b> is a secret text {{which is the result}} of a purposeful act of subterfuge. In the article, I present selected cryptotexts â€“ reviews produced in the Ministry of Culture and Art (MKiS) and censorship reviews of the dramatic works submitted for evaluation to the Voivodship Control Bureau for Press, Main Office of Control of Press, Publications and Shows (WUKPPiW). The archives contain evaluation of works which have been published in subsequent years as well as those which remained only in their draft form. Analysis of the evaluations of ministry officials reveal the mechanisms for allowing and withholding submitted dramatic works and a theatre staging handbook which shows the practices of publishing theatrical works. An analysis of different evaluations of the same text allows for a hypothesis that the main aim of cryptotexts was the evaluation of ideological correctness of submitted works. Despite this main function it is possible to point out specific passages in the statements by the WUKPPiW officials which are similar to statements of Ministry officials. In both cases the evaluation pertains to the content and the planned fulfilment of the work and plays mainly a didactic function...|$|E

There are rigorously definednotions, given by Goldwasser and Micali [14], such as semantic security; &quot;whatever can be computed efficiently from the <b>cryptotext</b> should also be computablewithout it&quot;. Obtaining semantic security requires rather elaborate constructions, and we cannot in general hope to achieve this by simply applying a natu-ral one-way function. In fact, any deterministic, public-key crypto system must leak some information. It is therefore important also to analyze the securityof specific information concerning the plaintext. We here study the question of given the encrypted message E(x), is it feasible to predict even a single bitof x? Now, &quot;feasible &quot; refers {{to the existence of}} probabilistic, polynomial timealgorithms, and we cannot exclude the possibility of &quot;guessing &quot; a bit o...|$|E
