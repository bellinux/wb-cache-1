40|$|Composite {{materials}} are well-renown for their {{strength to weight}} ratios and are widely used in many industries where high strength and low weight is required. Although steel is the traditional material of choice in the mining industry, and particularly for <b>conveyor</b> <b>support</b> structures, the strength and weight advantages offered by composite materials has prompted this investigation into the feasibility of using composite materials in underground mining <b>conveyor</b> <b>support</b> structures. The {{first phase of the}} project centred on establishing and applying selection criteria for the materials and processes which could be used in such a structure. Key concerns include fire performance, electrical conductivity, cost, availability and manufacturability. Based on these considerations, the project identified a phenolic-glass laminate manufactured using the RTM method (for moulded components) or the pultrusion process (for tube sections) as a possible basis for a composite <b>conveyor</b> <b>support</b> structure. The second phase of the project developed a set of design criteria for the use of composite materials in <b>conveyor</b> <b>support</b> structures and a series of preliminary designs based on current conveyor configurations. After analysing each preliminary design against key design criteria, in particular cost, weight, assembly time, susceptibility to damage and torsional loading, the Linestand Suspended - Beam configuration was selected as the preferred option. The third phase of the project used the findings of the preliminary design analysis and the key design criteria to develop a prototype final design. The prototype design is based on a hybrid style of frame. The majority of the structure is constructed from a custom pultruded beam connected with a composite connection piece, while the interface between the rollers and the frame utilises a steel bracket {{to reduce the risk of}} damage to the composite frame. The final design is 12 kg lighter than the current smaller steel design of similar function. The project has demonstrated the feasibility of using composite materials in <b>conveyor</b> <b>support</b> structures and the weight savings that may be achieved...|$|E
40|$|Due {{to aging}} and corrosion, {{large number of}} belt <b>conveyor</b> <b>support</b> {{structures}} in industrial plants has degraded over the past decades. These structures are in damage condition and may cause human injury or death and economy impacts as several structural accidents of belt conveyors {{have been reported in}} Japan and overseas which caused the operation of factories to stop. Therefore, structural condition assessment of these structures is urgent. To overcome the problems of global vibration modes in damage identification (i. e. need of before-and-after comparison, incapable to be applied for structures with large number of damaged elements, considering effects of non-structural elements and environmental conditions), new damage identification methods are proposed based on two specific local vibration modes named Periodic Local Vibration Modes (PLVM) and Isolated Local Vibration Modes (ILVM). These modes are distinguished from other types of local vibration modes. PLVM is a mode in which vibrations of one group of the identical secondary members are much larger than the other members. The idea in damage identification is when one of these identical members is damaged, this member no longer vibrates in PLVM, instead, it has ILVM in a lower frequency. Numerical and experimental results show that PLVM and ILVM are better observed when each secondary member is directly hit. As an alternative method to easily observe PLVM, one of the undamaged members in each identical members set can be hit. By hitting one of the undamaged members in each identical members set, damaged secondary members of the identical members set are localized and the relative severity of damage is identified by comparing PLVM amplitude in the corresponding PLVM range. The existence of PLVM and ILVM in systems consisting of main and secondary members is investigated using mass-spring system. A 3 -DOF system including coupler, main, and secondary members is considered and mode localization phenomenon is mathematically explained. Then, a more complicated lamped mass-spring system which has 21 -DOF is compared with a finite element model of the support structure of a belt-conveyor to find a correspondence between these two models and the existence condition of PLVM and ILVM is numerically discussed. It is found that when main members are much stiffer than secondary members, PLVM and ILVM of secondary members exist and their frequencies are nearly the same as natural frequencies of the corresponding secondary members. Next, the method based on global vibration modes and two damage identification methods based on PLVM and ILVM frequencies comparison and PLVM amplitude comparison are utilized to identify damaged members of a finite element model of the support structure of a typical belt conveyor. Then, based on the sensitivity analyses of frequencies of PLVM and ILVM which show that the appropriate parameters in damage quantification of secondary members are the local internal connections and the properties of the corresponding member, beam theory and its applicability on the quantification of damage degree are discussed and the stiffness of local boundary conditions and the stiffness reduction of damaged members are reliably identified. Likewise, the two damage identification techniques based on PLVM and ILVM are examined for two laboratory models. One has continuous longitudinal members and the other has separated longitudinal members. The method is applicable for all secondary members (i. e. diagonal and lateral members) of the structure with continuous main members, and all damaged and undamaged members almost vibrate in their own natural frequencies; yet, these damage identification methods cannot identify the damaged lateral members of the structure with non-continuous main members since coupling of modes happens for these members. The reason {{is due to the fact}} that the stiffness of the main members is not much larger than the lateral members and no other secondary member is attached to one of the connections of each lateral member. The existence of PLVM and ILVM of the secondary members of a planar full-scale model of a belt conveyor is investigated and the damaged members are identified using the method based on PLVM and ILVM frequencies comparison. Finally, using the method based on PLVM and ILVM frequencies comparison, damaged secondary members of a real belt-conveyor are correctly localized and using beam theory, the equivalent damage degree is quantified for each damaged member while each member is directly hit and the method is experimentally verified. Moreover, using the damage identification method based on PLVM amplitude comparison, the damaged secondary members are localized and the relative severity of the damage is correctly identified. In conclusion, damage identification techniques to identify damages on belt <b>conveyor</b> <b>support</b> structures utilizing local vibration modes taking advantage of the non-contact measurement device have been proposed. These techniques are capable of identifying multiple damages on a structure without the need of before-and-after comparison. The Laser Doppler Vibrometer allows a quick assessment of damages. The applicability to belt conveyors is confirmed through numerical and experimental verifications. Further studies on criteria to distinguish local vibration modes and on the applicability to structures of other types such as truss bridges and towers are considered to advance the techniques toward their full-fledged use. 報告番号:; 学位授与年月日: 2012 - 09 - 27; 学位の種別: 課程博士; 学位の種類: 博士(工学); 学位記番号:; 研究科・専攻: 工学系研究科社会基盤学専...|$|E

40|$|An {{emergency}} {{situation in a}} continuous transport system is an undesirable phenomenon during which the continuity of production or technological processes is seriously endangered. This situation can be brought about by various factors. In technological equipment of environmental continuous belt conveyor systems and pipe conveyors various adverse critical conditions may arise, which may result {{in the creation of}} an {{emergency situation}}. In particular, both <b>conveyor</b> and <b>supporting</b> rollers being the most significant components of the conveyor belt can substantially contribute to the onset of an emergency situation. Any damage to them can lead to a reduction or a complete standstill of the continuous transport process, which impedes upon the subsequent production operations.

The resulting data, with > 1300 TCO 2 data points, have allowed the determination of the TCO 2 signature of the water masses in the northern North Atlantic Ocean in terms of seven water types. The structure of TCO 2 and dissolved phosphate and nitrate appears to be well correlated with the apparent oxygen utilization. This indicates that ageing of the water types, by mineralization of organic matter, is more important for the observed TCO 2 structure than differences in the preformed TCO 2 when the water types were formed.

40|$|Background: This patent {{is based}} on the {{combination}} of caterpillar mechanisms and <b>conveyors.</b> Caterpillar tracks <b>support</b> heavy loads and adapt this support according to the ground conditions. Conveyors displace distributed loads continuously and bidirectionally using the force of friction. This paper describes a revision of previous patents related to this innovative design. Objective: This paper presents an innovative patent to continuously displace heavy structures safely. The mechanism was patented in 2011 as Spanish Patent ES 2367737. The combination of these mechanisms provides the design of this patent to displace heavy structures continuously and bidirectionally, while adapting to the deflection of the structures. Methods: The most important elements of this patent are detailed in the paper. The most innovative component is the load compensation system, which increases the safety of the displacement of heavy structures. This system controls the load applied on the mechanism, and the displacement can be stopped before the collapse of the heavy structure. Results: An application of the patent for launching bridges using the Incremental Launching Method is presented. This mechanism is used to displace heavy structures using the force of friction. Conclusion: The patented mechanism is an original contribution for the displacement of heavy structures continuously and bidirectionally. The patent can be used to launch bridges, improving the efficiency, sustainability, and safety of current systems.
