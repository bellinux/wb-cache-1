25|$|Worldwide, {{there are}} five major coastal {{currents}} associated with upwelling areas: the Canary Current (off Northwest Africa), the Benguela Current (off southern Africa), the California Current (off California and Oregon), the Humboldt Current (off Peru and Chile), and the Somali Current (off Western India). All of these currents support major fisheries. Many forage fish are important <b>commercial</b> <b>species,</b> and the schools can be targeted by spotter planes. The fish are caught by purse seiners—fishing boats that use nets to enclose the fish—and can be overfished.|$|E
25|$|Rainbow runner {{are not a}} major <b>commercial</b> <b>species</b> like tuna or herring, but {{are taken}} in large {{quantities}} as bycatch.

Archaeological evidence from the Kapingamarangi and Nukuoro Atolls in the Caroline Islands of Micronesia suggests the prehistoric people of these islands caught large amounts of rainbow runner as food, thought to have been captured by 'trolling' lure hooks from canoes.|$|E
25|$|Forest land {{is one of}} the state’s {{two main}} natural resources. These forests contain <b>commercial</b> <b>species</b> such as pine, oak, cedar, juniper, {{mesquite}} and more.

Land actively involved in forestry operations equals 9,358m2, most of which is in the municipalities of Landa de Matamoros and Amealco de Bonfil. 20.7% is used for grazing. 24.22% is forest; 3.95% is rainforest and 40.62 is arid scrub brush.|$|E

25|$|A {{schooling}} {{species that}} predominantly inhabits inshore waters, the yellowstripe scad is a predatory fish, taking crustaceans, small fish {{and a variety}} of other planktonic prey. Feeding occurs at different times of the day and night throughout its range. The species reaches sexual maturity at around 8–13cm, with spawning in India shown to occur in two peak periods between January to April and July to October. The yellowstripe scad is an important <b>commercial</b> <b>species,</b> with between 113,000 t and 195,000 t reported worldwide between 1990 and 2010. The species is predominantly harvested with trawls, however is also taken with smaller traditional nets. The yellowstripe scad is marketed fresh, frozen, as a dried fish snack as well as several novel ways including fish powder, surimi and burgers.|$|E
25|$|Jacks, amberjacks, pompanos, horse mackerel, scads, leatherjackets and {{trevally}} are fish of {{the family}} Carangidae. Found in most coastal waters, they are fast predatory fishes that hunt in the waters above reefs and in the open sea; some dig in the sea floor for invertebrates (some can also filter feed, such as the white trevally). The largest fish in the family, the giant trevally, grows up to 1.7m in length; most fish in the family reach a maximum length of 25–100cm. The family contains many important commercial and game fish, notably the Pacific jack mackerel and the other jack mackerels in the genus Trachurus. The type species of this genus is the Atlantic horse mackerel. Jack mackerels are an important inshore <b>commercial</b> <b>species.</b>|$|E
25|$|Traditionally based {{mostly on}} tourism, sport fishing, salt {{production}} and mining, in 2012 the GDP {{of the state}} accounted for only 0.73% of the country’s GDP, but grew 3.13% {{in comparison to the}} year prior. In 2013, this growth increased to 7.8%. Unemployment in 2013 was 5.1% with employment shifting away from agriculture and fishing to mining and industry (up 19.9%) and commerce (up 4.9%). Today, agriculture, fishing and forestry account for only 3.89% of the state GDP. <b>Commercial</b> <b>species</b> include tuna, sardines, anchovies, clams, snails, oysters, shark, lobsters, abalone, shrimp and crabs, which are sold both nationally and internationally.

25|$|Yellow jack are a minor <b>commercial</b> <b>species</b> {{throughout}} their range, taken by seines, trawls and hook and line techniques.

Yellow jack {{are known to be}} carriers of ciguatera around the West Indies, and are classified as a high risk species, with their predatory nature allowing the toxin to accumulate in their flesh. The yellow jack was actually the first species outside of the Pacific Ocean to be confirmed as carrying ciguatera toxins, although these early studies showed that the toxin was biochemically slightly different from the Pacific strain.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the fact}} that of itself Florida Maple is not {{employed}} as a commercial timber species, it is used with associated <b>commercial</b> <b>species</b> when the products are pulpwood, sawtimber, or wood veneer stock. It is considered a hard maple and as high quality individuals are suitable for producing furniture, flooring, paneling, and shoe lasts. However, its relative scarcity, small size, and fairly poor shape generally confine its use to only factory and box lumber, and even this is only an occasional occurrence. It has, however, been experiencing growing popularity as an ornamental or shade tree, especially in the southern United States due to its high heat resistance. It is also a source of maple syrup, though again its size and rarity limit its use in this regard, {{especially in light of}} the Sugar Maple's established popularity within the business.|$|E
