5|$|In March 2002, McCainâ€“Feingold, officially {{known as}} the Bipartisan <b>Campaign</b> <b>Reform</b> Act of 2002, passed in both Houses of Congress and {{was signed into law}} by President Bush. Seven years in the making, it was McCain's {{greatest}} legislative achievement.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Chico {{ran for the}} Democratic {{nomination}} to succeed retiring Republican U.S. Senator Peter Fitzgerald. He was the first Democrat to declare his candidacy, doing so on July 30, 2002, during a rally with Hispanic leaders. His Senate committee preferences included education, transportation, and foreign relations. He also criticized the Bipartisan <b>Campaign</b> <b>Reform</b> Act and the No Child Left Behind Act, but supported gay marriage, abortion rights, stem cell research, the death penalty, and universal healthcare. Chico was the only candidate who supported gay marriage out of all seven Democrats and eight Republicans. Then-State Senator Barack Obama ultimately won the nomination over six other candidates including Chico.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, the ACLU {{filed an}} amicus brief in Citizens United v. FEC, {{arguing that the}} Bipartisan <b>Campaign</b> <b>Reform</b> Act of 2002 {{violated}} the First Amendment {{right to free speech}} by curtailing political speech. This stance on the landmark Citizens United case caused considerable disagreement within the organization, resulting in a discussion about its future stance during a quarterly board meeting in 2010. On March 27, 2012, the ACLU reaffirmed its stance in support of the Supreme Court's Citizens United ruling, at the same time voicing support for expanded public financing of election campaigns and stating the organization would firmly oppose any future constitutional amendment limiting free speech.|$|E

5|$|Prompted by the 2002 Bipartisan <b>Campaign</b> <b>Reform</b> Act, the CRNC officially {{left the}} control of the RNC by reconstituting as a 527 group, {{allowing}} it to operate independently and raise unlimited amount of money for issue-advocacy work. As a 527 group, the organization is prohibited from coordinating directly with a particular campaign and its recent focus has turned towards developing volunteers and other support activities rather than outright campaigning. The shift has allowed the CRNC to vastly expand its fundraising efforts. During its first two years, the CRNC raised $17.3 million, most going to pay fundraising costs and other administrative costs, while leaving more than $2 million to expand the field representative program and to improve pay for the full-time positions.|$|E
25|$|Feingold {{is perhaps}} best known for his work with Senator John McCain on the Bipartisan <b>Campaign</b> <b>Reform</b> Act of 2002, better known as the McCain-Feingold Act. The legislation, which took seven years to pass, became defunct in the wake of several U.S. Supreme Court decisions.|$|E
25|$|With John McCain, he {{received}} the 1999 John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award. Feingold and McCain cosponsored the Bipartisan <b>Campaign</b> <b>Reform</b> Act (McCainFeingold Act), a major piece {{of campaign finance reform}} legislation. He was the only Senator to vote against the Patriot Act during the first vote on the legislation.|$|E

25|$|On January 24, Bush won the Iowa caucus with 41% of the vote. Forbes came {{in second}} with 30% of the vote. Keyes {{received}} 14%, Bauer 9%, McCain 5%, and Hatch 1%. Hatch dropped out. On the national stage, Bush was portrayed in the media as the establishment candidate. McCain, {{with the support of}} many moderate Republicans and Independents, portrayed himself as a crusading insurgent who focused on <b>campaign</b> <b>reform.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1999, Wellstone {{formed an}} {{exploratory}} committee {{to run for}} President of the United States in the 2000 election. After campaigning in the early primary states, he announced he would not seek the presidency because of sustained physical limitations from a college wrestling injury. His condition was later diagnosed as multiple sclerosis. As Senator, Wellstone authored the Wellstone Amendment for the Bipartisan <b>Campaign</b> <b>Reform</b> Act of 2002. His efforts toward campaign finance reform were posthumously overturned in 2010 by the U.S. Supreme Court in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission. In 2002, {{he was the only}} Senator facing reelection to vote against the congressional authorization for the Iraq War.|$|E

25|$|After {{five years}} as {{independent}} counsel, Starr resigned and returned to private practice as an appellate lawyer and a visiting professor at New York University, the Chapman University School of Law, and the George Mason University School of Law. Starr worked as a partner at Kirkland & Ellis, specializing in litigation. He {{was one of the}} lead attorneys in a class-action lawsuit filed by a coalition of liberal and conservative groups (including the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Rifle Association) against the regulations created by the Bipartisan <b>Campaign</b> <b>Reform</b> Act of 2002, known informally as McCain-Feingold Act. In the case, Starr argued that the law was an unconstitutional abridgement of free speech.|$|E
25|$|As {{his second}} term progressed, Roosevelt moved {{to the left of}} his Republican Party base and called for a series of reforms, most of which failed to pass Congress. Roosevelt's {{influence}} waned as he approached the end of {{his second term}}, as his promise to forego a third term made him a lame duck and his concentration of power provoked a backlash from many Congressmen. He sought a national incorporation law (at a time when all corporations had state charters), called for a federal income tax (despite the Supreme Court's ruling in Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co.), and an inheritance tax. In the area of labor legislation, Roosevelt called for limits on the use of court injunctions against labor unions during strikes; injunctions were a powerful weapon that mostly helped business. He wanted an employee liability law for industrial injuries (pre-empting state laws) and an eight-hour work day for federal employees. In other areas he also sought a postal savings system (to provide competition for local banks), and he asked for <b>campaign</b> <b>reform</b> laws.|$|E
500|$|McCain {{traveled}} {{on a campaign}} bus called the Straight Talk Express, whose name capitalized on {{his reputation as a}} political maverick who would speak his mind. In visits to towns he gave a ten-minute talk focused on <b>campaign</b> <b>reform</b> issues, then announced he would stay until he answered every question that everyone had. He pledged that [...] "I will never tell you a lie." [...] He conducted 114 of these town hall meetings, speaking in every town in New Hampshire in an example of [...] "retail politics" [...] that overcame Bush's familiar name. [...] His growing number of supporters became known as [...] "McCainiacs".|$|E

500|$|Hastert {{opposed the}} Bipartisan <b>Campaign</b> <b>Reform</b> Act (McCain-Feingold), the {{landmark}} {{campaign finance reform}} law. In 2001, during {{the debate on the}} bill, Hastert criticized Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona, saying that McCain had [...] "bullied" [...] House Republicans by sending them letters in support of his campaign-finance reform proposals. Hastert called the legislation [...] "the worst {{thing that ever happened to}} Congress" [...] and expressed the view that there were [...] "constitutional flaws" [...] in the legislation. Supporters of campaign-finance reform circumvented Hastert by means of a discharge petition, a seldom-used procedural mechanism in which a measure may be brought to a floor vote (over the objections of the speaker) if an absolute majority of Representatives sign a petition in support of doing so. The discharge petition was not successfully used again until 2015.|$|E
500|$|The court again {{scrutinized}} {{campaign finance}} regulation in McConnell v. Federal Election Commission (2003). The case {{centered on the}} Bipartisan <b>Campaign</b> <b>Reform</b> Act of 2002 (BCRA), a federal law that imposed new restrictions on campaign financing. The Supreme Court upheld provisions which barred the raising of soft money by national parties {{and the use of}} soft money by private organizations to fund certain advertisements related to elections. However, the Court struck down the [...] "choice of expenditure" [...] rule, which required that parties could either make coordinated expenditures for all its candidates, or permit candidates to spend independently, but not both, which the Court agreed [...] "placed an unconstitutional burden on the parties' right to make unlimited independent expenditures." [...] The Court also ruled that the provision preventing minors from making political contributions was unconstitutional, relying on Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District.|$|E
500|$|Barr {{launched}} an exploratory committee {{and created a}} campaign website on April 5, 2008. Within two days, the committee reported that $25,000 had been contributed. Russ Verney, who had served {{as an adviser to}} Ross Perot in the 1992 and 1996 presidential elections, joined the campaign as a volunteer adviser and worked with Barr's consulting firm, Liberty Strategies LLC, to form a campaign team and build an organization. Verney became the campaign manager after Barr officially announced his candidacy. A poll in late April by Barr's exploratory committee showed that Barr had the support of 7% of the electorate before he had officially declared his candidacy. Leading up to Barr's announcement, columnist George Will wrote an article in Newsweek chronicling the Libertarian Party and the potential candidate's run. Will stated that Barr could {{have an effect on the}} election similar to Ralph Nader's in 2000. He described the potential effect as a [...] " [...] punishment" [...] for presumptive Republican Party nominee John McCain for his co-sponsorship of the Bipartisan <b>Campaign</b> <b>Reform</b> Act of 2002, which Barr opposed.|$|E

2500|$|An {{advocate}} of government restrictions on campaign spending and contributions, McCain made {{campaign finance reform}} a central issue in his 2000 presidential bid. With Democratic Sen. Russ Feingold of Wisconsin he pushed the Bipartisan <b>Campaign</b> <b>Reform</b> Act of 2002 which banned unlimited donations to national political parties (soft money) and curtailed issue-advocacy ads. Because of McCain and Feingold's involvement, the law is {{commonly referred to as}} the [...] "McCain-Feingold Act." ...|$|E
2500|$|Because of {{individual}} federal campaign contribution limits {{in the wake}} of the Bipartisan <b>Campaign</b> <b>Reform</b> Act (McCain-Feingold), pay-to-play payments of [...] "soft money" [...] (money not contributed directly to candidate campaigns and that does not [...] "expressly advocate" [...] election or defeat of a candidate) donations to state parties and county committees have come under greater scrutiny. This method refers to money that is donated to an intermediary with a higher contribution limit, which in turn donates money to individual candidates or campaign committees who could not directly accept the payor's funds.|$|E
