40|$|Graduation date: 1979 A {{population}} of Columbian white-tailed deer (CWTD) was studied on a refuge (790 ha) in southwestern Washington during 1972 - 77. Quality of habitat was considered good for these deer and total population size remained between 164 - 230 {{as determined by}} mark-recapture methods during November. Population size declined significantly between the winters of 1974 - 75 and 1975 - 76. All sex-age classes exhibited a <b>contagious</b> <b>dispersion</b> on the study area; the locations of high density areas among these classes differed slightly. Sex ratio at birth {{did not differ significantly}} from 1 : 1, but females outnumbered males 3 : 1 among yearlings and adults. Fawn:doe ratios ranged from 35 - 60 fawns per 100 does in November. From 1972 - 77, yearling and adult males comprised 18 - 21...|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 1255 pitcher plants {{belonging}} to two species were recorded from 11 plots set between 2610 m to 2970 m altitude on Mount Kinabalu, each with {{an area of}} 0. 01 hectare. Of these plants, 1180 (94 %) belonged to Nepenthes villosa, followed by N. kinabaluensis contained 75 (6 %) plants. The density of N. villosa and N. kinabaluensis ranged from 0 to 260 and 0 to 65 plants respectively. Nepenthes villosa was recorded absent in P 5, whereas N. kinabaluensis was recorded in P 2, P 3 and P 11. Differences in density of both species between the study plots is influenced by combination of factors, which include topography, soil, habitat, different light intensities reaching the forest floor and water deficient due to exposure to wind and light intensities at higher altitudes. The I d values were greater than 1 for both species in all plots showing <b>contagious</b> <b>dispersion</b> pattern. Size class distribution and population structure varied for both species between plots. Generally there were more seedlings and juveniles than mature plants of both species at different elevations indicating regenerating populations. In mature plants there were more male than female plants in both species...|$|E
40|$|Studies on subalpine meadow invasions by Abies lasiocarpa (subalpine fir) in the Sierra Nevada and the Rocky Mountain Front Range are abundant, {{yet little}} is {{understood}} about this important {{process in the}} subalpine zone of Glacier National Park (GNP), Montana. This study evaluates spatiotemporal influences of climate on conifer invasions into subalpine meadows. Seedling establishment of A. lasiocarpa show both time and site dependent relationships to interannual variation in climate. Annual and seasonal climate models were constructed for temperature data, and these data were plotted against establishment. Regression analyses between climate data and conifer establishment were performed, and residual statistics show strong positive relationship between fall temperatures, Pacific Decadal Oscillation, and establishment. Correlations between climate and establishment showed significant positive trend between mean maximum temperature in fall, mean minimum temperature in fall and mean temperature in fall, and forest establishment. Both forest and meadow categories showed significant inverse trends in Pacific Decadal Oscillation and establishment. These data indicate warmer fall temperatures and alteration in snowpack lengthen the growing season and provide more moisture for meadows, a limiting resource, {{over the course of}} the growing season. The spatial pattern of tree invasion age and size structure were examined by drawing age class maps based on mapped and aged trees and by drawing size class maps based on mapped tree diameter. A multi-distance spatial analysis was used at tree scale to describe and understand these patterns. The tree age and size structure of A. lasiocarpa invasion showed differences over distance across meadow-forest boundaries attributed to strategies in competition and facilitation and variations in soil depth and topography. One of the small meadows in the study area was distributed in random patterns of tree spatial associations over the extent of the neighborhood. All other meadows showed clumped spatial associations for seedling establishment over the extent of the neighborhood. These meadows showed clustered spatial patterns of tree establishment, with larger trees and seedlings having strong spatial associations over range of the neighborhood at different scales indicating <b>contagious</b> <b>dispersion.</b> Observed spatial differences of conifer invasion in subalpine meadows shows instability in meadow/forest boundaries, and this instability is pronounced along the elevation gradient in erosional and depositional meadows. These results indicate a vegetation dynamic which may result in increased expansion of forests into meadows over time in periods of favorable climate...|$|E
