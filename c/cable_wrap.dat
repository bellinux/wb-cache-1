50|$|The C-H band is a dual {{polarisation}} channel that covers from 3.22 - 3.39 GHzThe receiver {{consists of a}} choke ring axial corrugated horn that was designed by the Antenna Group at the Technical University of Madrid. The horn antenna is coupled to a waveguide to coaxial polariser that separates out the two orthogonal components of the incoming circularly polarised beam. The two linear polarisations are then fed directly to two low noise cryogenically cooled amplifiers. Following 2nd stage amplification, conditioning and filtering the astronomical signal is mixed with a Local Oscillator signal at 2.555 GHz to give a 170 MHz IF bandwidth centred at 750 MHz. This IF is then re-routed to the backends {{in the control room}} some 5 metres below via a <b>cable</b> <b>wrap.</b> A phasecal signal is also injected to the IF module to remove phase errors. This band is important for observing the three Ch molecular lines which are considered extremely important in understanding the chemistry of the interstellar medium.|$|E

The C-Band receiver also consists of a choke ring axial corrugated horn and was designed by the Antenna Group at the University of Navarra. The horn antenna is then coupled to a waveguide to coaxial polariser that separates out the two orthogonal components of the incoming circularly polarised beam.

40|$|Some seven {{different}} configurations of the NSI and other cables {{were tested in}} the NASA-MSFC Hot Gas Facility (HGF). The tests were conducted to study {{what happens to the}} cables when they are exposed to hot flow {{as was the case in}} the first two Shuttle flights, the STS- 1 and STS- 2. Protection of these components is vital for various functions especially to attain proper nozzle separation. The tests in the HGF demonstrated the severity of the aerodynamic forces combined with aero heating environment on the test cables and helped, in general, to evaluate the <b>cable</b> <b>wrap</b> materials and cable mounting hardware and technique.

The PS 2 design has evolved incrementally based on lessons learned from PS 1, but these changes should result in significant improvements in image quality, tracking performance in windy conditions, and reductions in scattered light. The optics for this telescope are finished save for their coatings and the fabrication for the telescope structure itself is well on the way towards completion and installation on-site late this year (2012). The most {{significant differences between the two}} telescopes include the following: secondary mirror support changes, improvements in the optical polishing, changes in the optical coatings to improve throughput and decrease ghosting, removal of heat sources inside the mirror cell, expansion of the primary mirror figure control system, changes in the baffle designs, and an improved <b>cable</b> <b>wrap</b> design.

40|$|Current {{ground-based}} {{tracking systems}} at Air Force test and training ranges require transmission {{of a variety}} of signals from rotating platform to fixed control center. At the moment, the task of signal rotating-to-fixed (RTF) transmission is exclusively handled by <b>cable</b> <b>wrap</b> structures, which provide small angular range, low speed, and are inconvenient to use. To solve this problem, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) has investigated an advanced electro-optic hybrid rotary joint (EOHRJ) technology for multiple channel RTF signal transmission. The developed EOHRJ provides the following features. First, it includes a unique two-layer electrical slip ring. This ring is able to accommodate hundreds of transmission channels, including electrical power, control, feedback, and low speed data signals. Second, it uses a unique optical fiber slip ring. This ring, by incorporating electrical time division mulitplexing (TDM) and optical wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) technologies, is able to provide multiple channel, high data rate (over GBPS), and bi-directional signal transmission. Third, the three-layer overlapped EOHRJ, meets particular military application demands and is designed to be reliable for operation in harsh environments operation, adaptive to stringent size requirements, and accommodating to electrical and mechanical interfaces of current tracker systems...|$|E
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 23 - 26, 2000 / Town & Country Hotel and Conference Center, San Diego, CaliforniaAn {{advanced}} electro-optic hybrid {{rotary joint}} (EOHRJ) {{has been developed}} in Phase II of an AF SBIR effort with Physical Optics Corporation (POC) to replace <b>cable</b> <b>wrap</b> structure for multi-channel rotation-to-fixed (RTF) signal transmission. The EOHRJ meets AFFTC and other range special needs with a generic, high performance, rotary joint solution. At the moment, we have successfully installed and tested the EOHRJ on our KTM tracker system with the following capabilities: 1) able to accommodate hundreds of transmission channels, including electrical power, control, feedback, and low-speed signals; 2) able to accommodate multiple channel, high data rate (over gigabits per second), and bi-directional signal transmission; 3) able to be reliable for harsh environmental operation, adaptive to stringent sized requirement, and accommodating existing electrical and mechanical interfaces. The completed EOHRJ contains three uniquely integrated functional rings. The first and the outmost one is power ring, which provides RTF transmission channels for over 50 high voltage and high current channels. The second and the middle one is low speed electrical signal ring, which provides RTF transmission for over hundred control, feedback, and low speed data signals. The third and the inmost one is optical fiber slip ring, which, incorporating with current advanced signal multiplexing technologies (either time division or wavelength division multiplexing) is able to provide multiple channel, high data rate, and bi-directional signal transmission. At the moment, the prototype module of the tree-layer EOHRJ has been successfully assembled in Air Force’s tracker system, and is providing a satisfactory performance.

40|$|The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) {{project had}} a rapid {{development}} schedule starting with project conception in spring of 2004, instrument and launch vehicle selection late in 2005 and then launch in early 2009. The lunar thermal environment {{is one of}} the harshest in our solar system with the heavy infrared loading of the moon due to low albedo, lack of lunar atmosphere, and low effective regolith conduction. This set of constraints required a thermal design which maximized performance (minimized radiator area and cold control heater power) and minimized thermal hardware build at the orbiter level (blanketing, and heater service). The orbiter design located most of the avionics on an isothermalized heat pipe panel called the IsoThermal Panel (ITP). The ITP was coupled by dual bore heat pipes to an Optical Solar Reflector (OSR) covered heat pipe radiator. By coupling all of the avionics to one system, the hardware was simplified. The seven instruments were mainly heritage instruments which resulted in their desired radiators being located by their heritage design. This minimized instrument redesigns and therefore allowed them to be delivered earlier, though it resulted in a more complex orbiter level blanket and heater service design. Three of the instruments were mounted on a tight pointing M 55 J optical bench that needed to be covered in heaters to maintain pointing. Two were mounted to spacecraft controlled radiators. One was mounted to the ITP Dual Bores. The last was mounted directly to the bus structure on the moon facing panel. The propulsion system utilized four- 20 pound insertion thrusters and eight- 5 pound attitude control thrusters (ACS) in addition to 1000 kg of fuel in two large tanks. The propulsion system had a heater cylinder and a heated mounting deck for the insertion thrusters which coupled most of the propulsion design together simplifying the heater design. The High Gain Antenna System (HGAS) and Solar Array System (SAS) used dual axis actuator gimbal systems. HGAS required additional boom heaters to cool the approximately 10 W of RF losses thru the rotary joints and wave guides from the 40 W Ka system. By design this module needed a fair amount of heater, blanketing, and radiator complexity. The SAS system required a separate <b>cable</b> <b>wrap</b> radiator to help cool the Solar Array harness which dissipated 30 W thru the actuators and cable wraps. This module also was complex...|$|E

50|$|Cyclic {{stress is}} the {{distribution}} of forces (aka stresses) that change over time in a repetitive fashion.
