5|$|The {{single largest}} niche {{industry}} {{is based on}} Latin music. Latin music has long influenced American popular music, and was an especially {{crucial part of the}} development of jazz. Modern pop Latin styles include a wide array of genres imported from across Latin America, including Colombian cumbia, Puerto Rican reggaeton, and Mexican corrido. Latin popular music in the United States began with a wave of dance bands in the 1930s and 1950s. The most popular styles included the conga, rumba, and mambo. In the 1950s Perez Prado made the cha-cha-cha famous, and the rise of Afro-Cuban jazz opened many ears to the harmonic, melodic, and rhythmic possibilities of Latin music. The most famous American form of Latin music, however, is salsa. Salsa incorporates many styles and variations; the term can be used to describe most forms of popular Cuban-derived genres. Most specifically, however, salsa refers to a particular style that was developed by mid-1970s groups of New York City-area Cuban and Puerto Rican immigrants, and stylistic descendants like 1980s salsa romantica. Salsa rhythms are complicated, with several patterns played simultaneously. The <b>clave</b> rhythm forms the basis of salsa songs and is used by the performers as a common rhythmic ground for their own phrases.|$|E
25|$|Concerning {{the role}} of <b>clave</b> in salsa music, Charley Gerard states: “The <b>clave</b> feeling is in the music {{whether or not the}} claves are {{actually}} being played.” Every ostinato part which spans a cycle of four main beats, has a specific alignment with <b>clave,</b> and expresses the rhythmic qualities of <b>clave</b> either explicitly or implicitly. Every salsa musician must know how their particular part fits with <b>clave,</b> and with the other parts of the ensemble.|$|E
25|$|A chord {{progression}} {{can begin}} {{on either side}} of <b>clave.</b> In salsa “one” can be {{on either side of}} <b>clave,</b> because the harmonic progression, rather than the rhythmic progression is the primary referent. When a chord progression begins on the two-side of <b>clave,</b> the music is said to be in two-three <b>clave.</b> The following guajeo is based on the <b>clave</b> motif in a two-three sequence. The cinquillo rhythm is now in the second measure.|$|E

25|$|Mario Bauzá {{developed}} the 3-2 / 2-3 <b>clave</b> concept and terminology. A chord progression can begin {{on either side}} of <b>clave.</b> When the progression begins on the three-side, the song or song section is said to be in 3-2 <b>clave.</b> When the chord progression begins on the two-side, it is in 2-3 <b>clave.</b> In North America, salsa and Latin jazz charts commonly represent <b>clave</b> in two measures of cut-time (2/2); this is most likely the influence of jazz conventions. When <b>clave</b> is written in two measures (above) changing from one <b>clave</b> sequence to the other is a matter of reversing the order of the measures. Bauzá consciously maintained a balance of Latino and jazz musicians in Machito's band, in order to realize his vision of Afro-Cuban jazz. Bauzá had the unique experience of mastering both types of music, but it took time for him to teach the jazz musicians in Machito's band about <b>clave.</b> The first time jazz trumpeter Doc Cheatham joined the band, Machito had to fire him after just two nights because he couldn't cope with <b>clave.</b>|$|E
25|$|Criolla is a {{genre of}} Cuban music which {{is closely related}} to the music of the Cuban Coros de <b>Clave</b> and a genre of Cuban popular music called <b>Clave.</b>|$|E
25|$|The <b>clave</b> rhythmic {{pattern is}} used as a tool for {{temporal}} organization in Afro-Cuban music, such as rumba, conga de comparsa, son, mambo (music), salsa, Latin jazz, songo and timba. The five-stroke <b>clave</b> pattern (distributed in groups of 3 + 2 or 2 + 3 beats) represents the structural core of many Afro-Cuban rhythms. Just as a keystone holds an arch in place, the <b>clave</b> pattern holds the rhythm together in Afro-Cuban music. The <b>clave</b> pattern originated in sub-Saharan African music traditions, where it serves essentially the same function as it does in Cuba. The pattern is also found in the African diaspora musics of Haitian Vodou drumming and Afro-Brazilian music. The <b>clave</b> pattern is used in North American popular music as a rhythmic motif or ostinato, or simply a form of rhythmic decoration.|$|E

25|$|The use of <b>clave</b> in R {{coincided with}} the growing {{dominance}} of the backbeat, and the rising popularity of Cuban music in the U.S. In a sense, <b>clave</b> can be distilled down to tresillo (three-side) answered by the backbeat (two-side).|$|E
25|$|The {{accompaniment of}} the choirs also {{included}} a guitar and the percussion was executed over the sound box of an American banjo from which the strings were removed, {{due to the fact}} that African drums performance was strictly forbidden in Cuban cities. The style of the Coros de <b>Clave</b> music, and particulally its rhythm, originated at a later time a popular song genre called <b>Clave,</b> which most probable served as the original prototype for the creation of the Criolla genre. Both genres, the <b>Clave</b> and the Criolla became very popular within the Cuban vernacular theater repertoire.|$|E

25|$|It was in Havana {{where the}} {{encounter}} {{of the rural}} rumba and the urban rumba, that had been developing separately {{during the second half}} of the 19th century, took place. The guaracheros and rumberos that used to play with the Tiple and the Guiro finally met other Rumberos that sang and danced accompanied by the wooden box (cajón) and the Cuban <b>Clave,</b> and the result was the fusion of both styles in a new genre called Son. Around 1910 the Son most likely adopted the <b>clave</b> rhythm from the Havana-based rumba, which had been developed in the late 19th century in Havana and Matanzas.|$|E

25|$|Bobby Sanabria {{mentions}} several innovations of Machito's Afro-Cubans, citing them as {{the first}} band: to wed big band jazz arranging techniques within an original composition, with jazz oriented soloists utilizing an authentic Afro-Cuban based rhythm section in a successful manner; to explore modal harmony (a concept explored much later by Miles Davis and Gil Evans) from a jazz arranging perspective; and to overtly explore the concept of <b>clave</b> counterpoint from an arranging standpoint (the ability to weave seamlessly {{from one side of}} the <b>clave</b> to the other without breaking its rhythmic integrity within the structure of a musical arrangement). They were also the first band in the United States to publicly utilize the term Afro-Cuban as the band's moniker, thus identifying itself and acknowledging the West African roots of the musical form they were playing. It forced New York City's Latino and African-American communities to deal with their common West African musical roots in a direct way, whether they wanted to acknowledge it publicly or not.|$|E
25|$|Within the Cabildos {{of certain}} neighborhoods from Havana, Matanzas, Sancti Spíritus and Trinidad, some choral groups were founded during the 19th century that {{organized}} competitive activities, {{and in some}} occasions were visited by local authorities and neighbors that gave them money and presents. Those choral societies were called Coros de <b>Clave,</b> probably after the instrument that used to accompany their performances, the Cuban Claves.|$|E
