40|$|Nanosized {{material}} fillers {{are widely}} used to enhance certain properties of polymers. Moreover, the use of nanoclays as a delivery host in pharmaceutical fields has gained a great interest. Sepiolite was incorporated to gelatin-egg white films <b>containing</b> <b>clove</b> essential oil. The effect of the incorporation of both sepiolite and clove essential oil on the physical properties of the resultant films was evaluated. Special attention {{was given to the}} role of this nanoclay in the release of antioxidant and antimicrobial compounds from the film matrix. Sepiolite showed a reinforcement effect of Young's modulus and tensile strength, meanwhile the clove essential oil had a certain plasticizing effect by increasing the elongation at break and water vapour permeability (WVP). When both compounds were added together, a noticeable loss of mechanical properties was observed, related to the loss of gelling capacity (G'), protein self-aggregation and α-helix structure decrease (FTIR). However, the WPV increased, probably due to the presence of cavities in the matrix observed by SEM. The incorporation of sepiolite in these films <b>containing</b> <b>clove</b> essential oil increased the release of both protein components and eugenol from the film matrix, leading to a controlled release of the antioxidant activity measured by ferric reducing ability and radical scavenging capacity, as well as a higher antimicrobial effect. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

We recorded the time of knock down flies after the exposure to soy protein-lignin films incorporated with 3 % food grade clove or citronella essential oils, or control films without bioactive. The vapors of clove released from the film containing 3 % essential oil were efficient to trigger the tumbling of the flies (40 % after 4 h exposition) and after 20 h 90 % of the flies died. However, films containing citronella essential oil had poor insecticidal activity. Citronella oil have a much higher insecticidal activity in a pure form, but probably {{one or both of}} their main bioactive compounds (citronellal and geraniol) were poorly released from the films.

40|$|Garlic is a {{food and}} {{medicinal}} plant {{that has been}} used in folk medicine since ancient times for its beneficial health effects, which include protection against cancer. Crushed garlic <b>cloves</b> <b>contain</b> an array of small sulfur-rich compounds such as ajoene. Ajoene is able to interfere with biological processes and is cytotoxic to cancer cells in the low micromolar range. BisPMB is a synthetic ajoene analogue that has been shown in our laboratory to have superior cytotoxicity to ajoene. In the current study we have performed a DNA microarray analysis of bisPMB-treated WHCO 1 oesophageal cancer cells to identify pathways and processes that are affected by bisPMB. The most significantly enriched biological pathways as assessed by gene ontology, KEGG and ingenuity pathway analysis were those involving protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the unfolded protein response. In support of these pathways, bisPMB was found to inhibit global protein synthesis and lead to increased levels of ubiquitinated proteins. BisPMB also induced alternate splicing of the transcription factor XBP- 1; increased the expression of the ER stress sensor GRP 78 and induced expression of the ER stress marker CHOP/GADD 153. CHOP expression was found to be central to the cytotoxicity of bisPMB as its silencing with siRNA rendered the cells resistant to bisPMB. The MAPK proteins, JNK and ERK 1 / 2 were activated following bisPMB treatment. However JNK activation was not critical in the cytotoxicity of bisPMB, and ERK 1 / 2 activation was found to play a pro-survival role. Overall the ajoene analogue bisPMB appears to induce cytotoxicity in WHCO 1 cells by activating the unfolded protein response through CHOP/GADD 153...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: <b>Clove</b> <b>contains</b> large {{proportion}} of a phenolic compound called eugenol, which has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of hydro-alcoholic clove extract on inflammation and pain response in mice. METHODS: In this experimental study, 48 male mice were classified into six groups of control (saline), positive control (dexamethasone) and treatment (receiving 42, 85, 170 and 340 mg/kg of clove extract) to investigate the effects of clove extract on inflammation. To evaluate pain perception, 160 mice were categorized into 4 groups, divided into 5 subgroups including the control (saline), positive control (morphine), recipients of 200 mg/kg clove extract, recipients of 500 mg/kg of extract, and recipients of 200 mg/kg of combined clove extract and naloxone (4 mg/kg). To assess pain response, the hot plate test was performed on each subgroup at 5, 15, 30 and 60 minutes after the injection of the herbal extract. In addition, two hours after the injection of 0. 03 ml xylene {{into the back of}} the right ears of the mice, the sections obtained from both ears (7 mm) were compared in terms of weight. FINDINGS: In the inflammation test, the most significant difference in the ear sections was observed between the control group and recipients of 42 mg/kg of extract (36 ± 5. 1 and 33 ± 5. 3 µg, respectively), while the least significant difference was observed at doses of 180 and 340 mg/kg (21 ± 2. 1 and 17 ± 1. 5 µg, respectively).
