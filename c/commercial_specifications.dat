40|$|An early {{step for}} most black-box testing methods is to {{identify}} a set of categories and choices (or their equivalents) from the specification. The identification is often performed in an ad hoc manner, thus the quality of categories and choices is in doubt.

In this paper, we describe several comparative studies using three <b>commercial</b> <b>specifications</b> and discuss the major results.

This thesis examines the Federal Government's decision {{to shift from}} almost total reliance on Government Specifications and Standards to a greater reliance on commercial off-the-shelf products and <b>commercial</b> <b>specifications</b> and / standards. The policy is analyzed from a Department of Defense perspective, with special emphasis placed upon the impact that the policy will have on competition, pricing, quality and the small business community. The conclusion is that the "Buy Commercial" policy will {{have a positive effect}} on competition and pri,cing without sacrificing any of the essentials of quality. The effects on the small business community overall will be positive, in that more smali firms will be encouraged to compete for Government contracts. For those small businesses however, that are heavily involved in producing products to meet Government specifications and standards the policy may spell financial disaster unless the Federal Government renders special consideration and assistance to them.

40|$|Ferrovanadium is {{essential}} for the production of many alloy steels. It is made by the aluminothermic reduction of vanadium oxides, together with scrap steel and burnt lime as a flux at very high temperatures. In this work, the theory of aluminothermic reduction is discussed, and then a computational thermodynamics model is described and its input parameters are discussed and justified. The model predicted very satisfactorily the composition of both the ferrovanadium and waste slag from a heat at the Windimurra smelter in Western Australia. Moreover, the modelling revealed that published data on the activity coefficient of VO 1. 5 in slag were likely to be seriously in error. It was shown that increasing the recovery of vanadium to the ferroalloy was accompanied by a rapid increase in its aluminium content, which is limited by <b>commercial</b> <b>specifications.</b> The limit on the silicon content of ferrovanadium can only be met by limiting the input of SiO 2 to the furnace.

40|$|Abstract. The {{relatively}} scant use {{of formal}} techniques in software {{development is the}} result, in part, {{of a lack of}} suitable support tools. Many tools have been developed that provide novel analysis capabilities but lack basic yet commonplace facilities which are essential in production software development. More importantly, many existing tools for the development of formal specifications fail to provide mechanisms for the manipulation of natural language despite the fact that natural language is essential to give meaning to the terms in the formal specification. In this paper, we describe a toolset that has been developed with the specific intent of providing comprehensive facilities for creating for-mal specifications in production software development. The toolset supports a powerful formal notation, Z, but also provides comprehensive and fully integrated support for natu-ral language. As well as describing the toolset we present a preliminary evaluation of its use on a <b>commercial</b> <b>specification...</b>|$|R
30|$|To obtain {{realistic}} {{simulation results}} in this scenario, two crucial concerns {{have been taken}} into account: (i) the desynchronization between nodes and (ii) the intrinsic drift of the nodes’ clock. Both parameters take values based on the study in (Mock 2000). The desynchronization issue is reproduced by introducing a variable synchronization error with values ranging from 0.8 to 2.1 [*]ms. On the other hand, the drift is set to a fixed value of 40 [*]μs/s of simulation, which is obtained from the <b>commercial</b> <b>specifications</b> of a MicaZ mote (MicaZ Datasheet). However, other considerations are determined apart from the IEEE 802.15. 5 standard, but {{they are out of}} the scope of this study. For instance, issues such as message collisions occurring in the access to the transmission medium due to hidden nodes are resolved; thanks to the appropriate layout of directive antennas or the use of additional time multiplexing techniques. In any case, the entire simulation framework with all the aforementioned features has been uploaded on the following website[URL] along with the corresponding user’s manuals in order to be executed by the interested audience, or to fully reproduce our simulation experiments.|$|E

By simulating these processes under realistic conditions we have establish together with the Italian company 'SOL group' a well controlled delivery path which can hold the purity. For the short-lived 222 Rn the initial contamination is less critical, because it decays away.

Dry matter, protein, lipids, and ash were evaluated by proximate analysis. Minerals were determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry and pH was determined by a pH meter. Lake Kariba fish had the highest percentage of dry matter, protein, and ash. These qualities were correlated to low levels of pollutants and high oxygen content in the harvest waters. The phosphorus content of fish from Lake Chivero was very high, in tandem with phosphate levels in the harvest waters.

40|$|The <b>commercial</b> <b>specification</b> of superconducting NbTi and Nb,Sn {{composite}} wires {{is normally}} {{given by a}} few numbers: I,(p,B,T), n, RRR, wire and filament diameter and twist length.

For Nb,Sn composites, depending on the production process, an extra set of parameters describing the stress sensitivity seems to be needed to specify {{the quality of the}} composite. More intriguing is the situation for Nb,Sn. Here the same set of parameters is used as for NbTi, but due to the large difference in production processes, the reaction heat treatment, the mechanical properties of the final product and the higher fields of applications additional specifications seem necessary. Furthermore, it seems that the production method of the wires leads to products with different quality. Whether this is necessarily so is not systematically investigated, but some differences will be outlined below. These variations will add up in reducing the performance of the superconducting composite to those resulting from geometrical sources already present in NbTi, where larger uniformity in the results of the treatment can be achieved...|$|R

30|$|The {{objective}} of this research work {{was to investigate the}} use of steam as a substitute fluid for air in spun-like textured yarn manufacturing. The new substitute product holds the potential for competitive advantage, lower manufacturing costs and streamlined manufacturing capabilities. Generally high-pressure steam is known to be cheaper to produce than compressed air. An existing air-jet texturing machine was modified to supply either air or steam to the texturing nozzle. Using an identical nozzle, both air-jet and steam-jet textured yarns were manufactured. The influence of effect-yarn parameters on the steam-jet texturing performance has been studied. Furthermore, steam-jet texturing was compared with air-jet texturing in terms of the processing parameters and the textured yarn properties. The results show that spun-like textured yarn manufactured using steam has lower loop instability, lower loop density and higher tensile properties than air at comparable fluid pressures. SEM image analysis shows that the entangled structure of the steam-jet textured yarns is comparable to the air-jet textured yarns. To verify the commercial feasibility of the new product, sewing threads were manufactured using both steam-jet and air-jet textured yarns and tested for sewability under <b>commercial</b> <b>specifications.</b> Sewability results indicated that the steam-jet textured sewing threads can withstand sewing at high-speeds like air-jet textured threads and are therefore suitable for manufacture of sewing threads. Therefore, it can be concluded that steam can be used as an alternative fluid for air in making spun-like textured yarns.|$|E
