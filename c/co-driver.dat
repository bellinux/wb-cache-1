5|$|Audi's No. 7 car of André Lotterer, Marcel Fässler and Benoît Tréluyer won {{the pole}} {{position}} and maintained their advantage on the race's first lap. Lotterer initially {{pulled away from}} the field but lost the lead to Mark Webber in Porsche's No. 1 car who remained in the position. <b>Co-driver</b> Brendon Hartley remained in first until he retired following heavy contact with Michael Wainwright in the No. 86 Gulf Racing car. This handed the lead to Neel Jani in the sister No. 2 car, but it switched again to Tréluyer when Jani's <b>co-driver</b> Marc Lieb was delayed by a slower vehicle. Although he was challenged by Lieb after being blocked by slower cars Tréluyer pulled away from him and the No. 7 Audi maintained its advantage over the No. 2 Porsche {{for the majority of the}} remainder of the event to finish the race first. However the No. 7 Audi was disqualified when scrutineers discovered that its front skid block was worn out by more than the regulations allowed for, handing the victory to Lieb, Jani and Romain Dumas. Toyota No. 5 drivers Stéphane Sarrazin, Mike Conway and Kamui Kobayashi finished in second and Dominik Kraihamer, Alexandre Imperatori and Mathéo Tuscher came in third to secure Rebellion Racing's first podium in the series since 2013.|$|E
5|$|Whilst {{playing for}} Tottenham Hotspur Greaves {{took out a}} £1,000 bank loan to start a packing {{business}} with his brother-in-law. By {{the end of his}} playing career this company had an annual turnover of over £1 million. He had a number of different business interests, including a travel agency. Greaves entered the 1970 London to Mexico World Cup Rally. In his first ever rally, alongside <b>co-driver,</b> Tony Fall, Greaves drove a Ford Escort to a sixth-place finish out of the 96 entrants.|$|E
5|$|Andretti {{won three}} 12 Hours of Sebring {{endurance}} races (1967, 1970, 1972), and the 24 Hours of Daytona in 1972. In early sportscar races he competed for the Holman Moody team, but later often drove for Ferrari. He signed with Ferrari in 1971, and won several races with <b>co-driver</b> Jacky Ickx. In 1972 he shared wins {{in the three}} North American rounds of the championship and at Brands Hatch in the UK, contributing to Ferrari's dominant victory in that year's World Championship for Makes. He also competed in the popular North American Can-Am series in the late 1960s and early 1970s.|$|E

5|$|In LMP2, Rast used {{intermediate}} tyres {{before making}} a pit stop for full wet tyres and recorded a lap time of two minutes and 7.374 seconds which gave him and <b>co-driver</b> Roman Rusinov a pole-setting two-lap average time of two minutes and 8.479 seconds. The two drivers were 1.1 seconds faster than the second-place class qualifier, the No. 31 Extreme Speed Motorsports Ligier JS P2 of Pipo Derani and Chris Cumming. Derani set the category's fastest individual lap which was 0.059 second's faster than Rast. The No. 43 RGR Sport team qualified in third with both SMP Racing cars rounding out the top five LMP2 qualifiers. Sam Bird and Davide Rigon, competing in the No. 71 AF Corse Ferrari, were the fastest LMGTE Pro drivers with a two-lap average time of two minutes and 12.440 seconds. They qualified 1.3 seconds in front of Richard Lietz and Michael Christensen in Dempsey-Proton Racing's No. 77 Porsche. Mücke and Pla in Ford Chip Ganassi Racing's No. 66 car took third despite Pla going into the Stowe corner gravel trap late in the session. Their sister No. 67 GT and the KCMG Porsche rounded out the top five class qualifiers. Calado recorded a time of two minutes and 11.589 seconds, and, after Bruni got into the car, {{he was unable to}} record a lap time and returned to a pit lane with an engine bay technical issue and started {{from the back of the}} overall field. Bachler and Khaled Al Qubaisi took the pole position in LMGTE Am, their first in the series, 2.297 seconds ahead of the second-place qualifier, KCMG's No. 78 car. Paolo Ruberti in Larbre Competition's No. 50 Chevrolet Corvette C7.R held the class pole position in the early part of the session but the team fell to third following the handover to <b>co-driver</b> Yutaka Yamagishi.|$|E
5|$|Mouton {{debuted in}} {{rallying}} as a <b>co-driver</b> but quickly {{moved to the}} driver's seat, steering an Alpine-Renault A110 in national rallies. In 1975, she competed in circuit racing and won the two-litre prototype class in the 24 Hours of Le Mans. After being signed by Fiat France for 1977, Mouton finished runner-up to Bernard Darniche in the European Rally Championship. She {{went on to win}} the 1978 Tour de France Automobile and record consistent results in her home events in the WRC; the Tour de Corse and the Monte Carlo Rally. For 1981, Audi Sport signed Mouton to partner Hannu Mikkola. In her first year with the Audi Quattro, she took a surprise victory at the Rallye Sanremo.|$|E
5|$|The tour {{returned}} to Pocono a month later, and Richmond battled for another victory in a fog-shortened event. In the final 8-lap sprint, Richmond competed in a three-car battle with Geoff Bodine and Ricky Rudd. Richmond crossed {{the finish line}} beside Rudd, winning the race by 0.05 seconds. He notched four more victories that season, and over a span of twelve races, Richmond earned three second-place finishes, and six wins. The National Motorsports Press Association named him <b>Co-Driver</b> of the Year with Earnhardt after Richmond accumulated 13 top 5 finishes and 16 in the top 10. He had a career-best third-place finish in points after winning seven events in 1986, in what was his last full NASCAR season.|$|E

5|$|Toivonen {{continued}} with Opel into the 1983 season, now driving the Manta 400, which {{took advantage of}} the new Group B regulations. Although the Manta was a Group B car, it was underpowered against the likes of the Audi Quattro A2 and Lancia 037, which were controlling the world rally scene at the time. Toivonen achieved a win at the Manx International Rally, a round of the British Open Rally Championship and the European Rally Championship, in the Isle of Man, at his first attempt. He also finished first at the Mille Pistes rally in France, but the organisers decided to ban the Group B cars halfway through the event. Toivonen and his <b>co-driver,</b> Ian Grindrod, received only a consolation trophy. In the World Rally Championship, he retired in three rallies, finished sixth at the Monte Carlo Rally and fourth at the Rallye Sanremo. He also drove a Ferrari 308 GTB at the San Marino Rally, where he was co-driven by Juha Piironen for the first time. The pair retired from the event, but Piironen would become his main <b>co-driver</b> for the next two seasons, and later have a long and successful partnership with four-time world champion Juha Kankkunen. In late October, Toivonen again competed on the circuits. This time he entered two sportscar races, driving a Porsche 956 for Richard Lloyd Racing in the World Sportscar Championship. Partnered with Derek Bell and Jonathan Palmer, he finished fourth at Imola and third in the next race at Mugello.|$|E
5|$|Toivonen, {{driving a}} Lancia Delta S4, {{died in a}} crash on 2 May 1986 while leading the Tour de Corse rally in Corsica. His American <b>co-driver,</b> Sergio Cresto, also died when the Lancia plunged down a ravine and exploded. The fatal crash had no close {{witnesses}} and the only remains of the car were the blackened spaceframe, {{making it impossible to}} determine the cause of the crash. Within hours of the crash, Jean-Marie Balestre, then President of the FISA, had banned the powerful Group B rally cars from competing the following season, ending rallying's popular supercar era.|$|E
5|$|Bernhard {{was caught}} by Duval and used his car's hybrid boost system on the Kemmel straight, moving ahead of the German under braking for Les Combes corner. Fässler briefly {{pressured}} Bernhard before entering the pit lane for a scheduled stop and Lotterer took over his seat. Lotterer lapped in the 1:58 second range which allowed him to run 12 seconds behind race leader Dumas. Bonanomi's left-hand window became detached on the Kemmel straight, necessitating an extra pit stop for a replacement window. Patrick Dempsey spun the No. 77 car at the Bus Stop chicane, forcing several drivers to take avoiding action. Trummer drove into his garage with back-end technical problems with his car and retired. Dempsey's <b>co-driver</b> Marco Seefried spun and heavily struck the left-hand turn tyre barrier before Pouhon corner.|$|E

5|$|Caracciola {{was lucky}} to escape from a crash in the Masaryk Grand Prix. He and Chiron were chasing Fagioli when Fagioli crashed into a wooden footbridge, {{bringing}} it crashing down onto the road. Caracciola and Chiron drove into a ditch {{at the side of}} the road to avoid the debris; while Chiron drove out of the ditch and was able to continue, Caracciola drove into a tree and retired. Despite this accident, Caracciola again performed strongly in the Hillclimbing Championship; he won eight climbs in his SSKL to take the title. Perhaps his most significant achievement of 1931 was his win in the Mille Miglia. The local fleet of Alfa Romeos battled for the lead early in the race, but when they fell back Caracciola was able to take control. His win, in record time, made him and his <b>co-driver</b> Wilhelm Sebastian (who allowed Caracciola to drive the entire race) the first foreigners to win the Italian race. The only other foreigners to win the race on the full course were Stirling Moss and Denis Jenkinson in 1955.|$|E
5|$|Colin McRae Rally is {{a racing}} video {{game in which}} players can drive cars in {{point-to-point}} rally events. The game can be played from a behind-the-car perspective or from a bonnet camera view. On mobile devices, cars can be steered using on-screen buttons which provide digital input or using tilt controls which provide analog input. The game's content and driving model are taken directly from the 2000 title Colin McRae Rally 2.0. The game features thirty rally stages from Colin McRae Rally 2.0, located in Australia, Corsica, and Greece. Terrain and surfaces vary between stages ranging from smooth tarmac roads to gravely off-road tracks. Track information is provided through verbal descriptions from the <b>co-driver</b> and icons that appear {{near the top of}} the screen. The icons display the severity and difficulty of turns using colour-coding. A progress indicator is also displayed on screen, so that the player can see how much of the course they have completed and compare their position to the computer drivers.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} leg, on Friday, 2 May, at the seventh {{kilometre}} of the 18th stage, Corte–Taverna, Toivonen's Lancia {{went off the}} side of the road at a tight left corner with no guardrail. The car plunged down a ravine and crashed on its roof. The aluminium fuel tank underneath the driver's seat was ruptured by the trees and exploded. The fuel tank was not protected by a skid plate, an item used mainly on gravel rallies, which was not fitted for the all-asphalt Tour de Corse. The explosion happened within seconds of the crash, and Toivonen and his <b>co-driver,</b> Sergio Cresto would not have time to get out had they still been alive. The fire caused by the explosion was so intense that the Delta S4, built of fast-burning kevlar-reinforced plastic composite, was unidentifiable as a car afterwards. Both Toivonen and Cresto died in their seats. Toivonen left behind wife Erja (married in 1982) and two young children, son Markus and daughter Arla, while Cresto was single with no children.|$|E

5|$|For the 1982 season, Toivonen {{switched}} to the Rothmans-sponsored Opel team, which was co-managed by David Richards. Toivonen's team mates were Ari Vatanen, who had won the previous year's championship (with Richards as his <b>co-driver),</b> the 1980 and 1982 world champion Walter Röhrl and Jimmy McRae, the previous year's British Rally Champion and father of future rally star Colin McRae. In his Ascona 400 debut in Portugal, Toivonen surprised the event favourites by leading the rally before retiring five stages from the finish. He competed in only four more WRC events, but finished on the podium twice, at the Acropolis Rally and at the RAC Rally. In the European Rally Championship, he participated in four rallies, registering three podiums and one retirement. He also made a guest appearance in one round of the British Formula Three circuit racing championship, where he finished tenth driving a Ralt RT3. In his Formula One test for March Grand Prix at the Silverstone Circuit, Toivonen was 1.4 seconds faster than the team's regular driver Raul Boesel.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} {{team had}} access to Codemasters' full audio library, which was composed of sound assets dating from the first Colin McRae Rally (1998) up to Grid 2 (2013). On a case-by-case basis, they decided whether to reuse existing sounds or update them. The result {{was a combination of}} audio from various games; suspensions sounds were taken from Dirt 3, wind, gearbox and mechanical samples from Colin McRae Rally 2005, garage sounds from , and music from Colin McRae Rally 04. One aspect of the audio that was kept intact was the original pacenotes read by professional <b>co-driver</b> Nicky Grist. The team did not want to disrupt the timing and delivery of critical track information so they opted to use the original recordings in this case. Support for custom soundtracks was added so that players could listen to their own music in-game.|$|E
5|$|In LMP2, the No. 26 G-Drive Oreca car of Rast and Roman Rusinov {{took the}} fastest time at {{two minutes and}} 7.363 seconds, which was set {{towards the end of}} {{qualifying}} and was a new class record at the track. The two were half a second quicker than the second-place class qualifier, the No. 36 Singatech Alpine entry. Merhi held the category lead early in the session with a lap of two minutes and 7,920 seconds but his <b>co-driver</b> Matt Rao was unable to match the Spaniard's time and ended as the third fastest qualifier, ahead of G-Drive's No. 38 entry in fourth. Sam Bird and Rigon, competing in the No. 71 AF Corse entry, were the fastest LMGTE Pro qualifiers with a two-lap average lap time of two minutes and 17.644 seconds. Bruni, in the second AF Corse vehicle, improved late in the qualifying session which meant Aston Martin's No. 97 car fell to third, and the two Ford Chip Ganassi Team entries rounded out the top five class qualifiers. The No. 98 Aston Martin of Paul Dalla Lana and Lamy took the pole position in LMGTE AM, 1.8 seconds ahead of second-place qualifier, AF Corse's No. 81 car.|$|E

5|$|In the Safari Rally, a {{rotor arm}} in Mouton's Quattro failed and caused the turbo {{to break down}} as well. She retired after falling victim to the team's ranking order; as the repairs were {{expected}} to take too long, Gumpert ordered championship leader Blomqvist's Quattro to be fixed by using Mouton's sister car as spares. Her debut in the new Sport Quattro at the Acropolis Rally ended with engine overheating problems. In the 1000 Lakes, Mouton placed ninth after the short first day. She later crashed and continued without a windscreen, but the damage to her Quattro could not be repaired in service. Mouton retired and left Finland pointless for the fourth year in a row. In late October, she signed a contract extension with Audi. At the RAC Rally, a slight mistake led to a puncture and Mouton dropped from third to fifth. She went on to narrowly lose the final podium spot to Toyota's Per Eklund. Mouton's results placed her 12th in the drivers' world championship, a point behind Röhrl. Outside the WRC, Mouton debuted in the Pikes Peak International Hill Climb in the United States, driving an Audi Sport Quattro together with her usual <b>co-driver</b> Fabrizia Pons. After her main opponent Martin Schanche got hampered by a flat right front tyre she won the open rally category (now known as unlimited) in a record time and placed second overall, leaving behind several specialised V8 single-seaters that had normally dominated the race.|$|E
5|$|Fässler {{extended}} his lead to 13 seconds when Jani was delayed by a Porsche LMGTE car at Brooklands corner. Jani {{was able to}} reduce the time deficit to ten seconds before Fässler made a pit stop for new tyres. Jani recorded the fastest lap of the race in response, at one minute and 30.303 seconds. Jani made his pit stop for new tyres with over a minute lead with Fässler retaking the first position. After five minutes Jani's front-right tyre was punctured, necessitating an unscheduled pit stop to change the wheel, and for extra fuel. Fässler made his final scheduled pit stop for fuel to {{reach the end of}} the race and remained in the lead with a seven-second lead over Jani. Bachler suffered a front-right suspension issue on his car. Smoke bellowed {{out of the back of}} Richie Stanaway's Aston Martin heading into Copse corner and he retired from the event. Joël Camathias took over the LMGTE Am lead but slowed with a car problem and returned slowly to the pit lane, allowing the No. 83 AF Corse into first place. Pantanici lost sixth place in LMP2 to Merhi at the loop and Rast moved into third place in category at Copse corner. The final period of pit stops began when Bruni made a stop, followed by Filipe Albuquerque who gained the LMP2 lead from <b>co-driver</b> Senna earlier in the race. Jani and Kobayashi both stopped for fuel which enabled the pair to reach the end of the event.|$|E
