25|$|Promoting {{intrinsic}} motivation {{and problem solving}} are two areas where educators <b>can</b> <b>foster</b> creativity in students. Students are more creative {{when they see a}} task as intrinsically motivating, valued for its own sake. To promote creative thinking, educators need to identify what motivates their students and structure teaching around it. Providing students with a choice of activities to complete allows them to become more intrinsically motivated and therefore creative in completing the tasks.|$|E

In September 2014, former European Commissioner Olli Rehn stated that an independent Scotland {{would be unable to}} meet EU membership requirements if it shared sterling informally, as it would not have an independent central bank. Rehn's comment was disputed by Salmond, who restated his belief that a sterling currency union would be formed and pledged to create the necessary financial institutions.|$|E
2500|$|The Greeks were favorably {{impressed}} by the constitution of Carthage; Aristotle had a study of it made which unfortunately is lost. In the brief approving review of it found in his Politica Aristotle saw one fault: that focus on pursuit of wealth led to oligarchy. So it was in Carthage. The people were politically passive; popular rights came late. Being a commercial republic fielding a mercenary army, the people were not conscripted for military service, an experience which <b>can</b> <b>foster</b> the feel for popular political action. On the other hand, Carthage was very stable; there were few openings for tyrants. [...] "The superiority of their constitution is proved {{by the fact that}} the common people remain loyal," [...] noted Aristotle. Only after defeat. by Rome devastated Carthage's imperial ambitions did the people express interest in reform.|$|E

2500|$|Advocates for {{alternative}} uses of an alkaline diet propose {{that since the}} normal pH of the blood is slightly alkaline, the goal of diet should be to mirror this by eating a diet that is alkaline producing as well. [...] These advocates propose that diets high in acid-producing elements will generally lead the body to become acidic, which <b>can</b> <b>foster</b> disease. This proposed mechanism, in which the diet can significantly change the acidity of the blood, goes against [...] "everything {{we know about the}} chemistry of the human body" [...] and has been called a [...] "myth" [...] in a statement by the American Institute for Cancer Research. [...] Unlike the pH level in the urine, a selectively alkaline diet has not been shown to elicit a sustained change in blood pH levels, nor to provide the clinical benefits claimed by its proponents. Because of the body's natural regulatory mechanisms, which do not require a special diet to work, eating an alkaline diet just can, at most, change the blood pH minimally and transiently.|$|E
2500|$|Michel Foucault {{introduced}} {{concepts such}} as 'discursive regime', or re-invoked those of older philosophers like 'episteme' and 'genealogy' in order to explain the relationship between meaning, power, and social behavior within social orders (see The Order of Things, The Archaeology of Knowledge, Discipline and Punish, and The History of Sexuality). In direct contradiction to what have been typified as modernist perspectives on epistemology, Foucault asserted that rational judgment, social practice, and what he called [...] "biopower" [...] are not only inseparable but co-determinant. While Foucault himself was deeply involved {{in a number of}} progressive political causes and maintained close personal ties with members of the far-left, he was also controversial with leftist thinkers of his day, including those associated with various Marxist tendencies, proponents of left-libertarianism (such as Noam Chomsky), and supporters of humanism (like Jürgen Habermas), for his rejection of what he deemed to be Enlightenment concepts of freedom, liberation, self-determination, and human nature. Instead, Foucault focused on the ways in which such constructs <b>can</b> <b>foster</b> cultural hegemony, violence, and exclusion.|$|E
2500|$|Social {{networking}} {{can also}} affect {{the extent to}} which a person feels lonely. In a Newsweek article, Johannah Cornblatt explains [...] "Social-networking sites like Facebook and MySpace may provide people with a false sense of connection that ultimately increases loneliness in people who feel alone." [...] John T. Cacioppo, a neuroscientist at the University of Chicago, claims that social networking <b>can</b> <b>foster</b> feelings of sensitivity to disconnection, which can lead to loneliness. Fabio Sabatini and Francesco Sarracino found that if an individual tends to (a) trust people and (b) have a significant number of face-to-face interactions, the individual is likely to assess their own well-being as relatively high. The researchers found that online social networking plays a positive role in subjective well-being when the networking is used to facilitate physical interactions, but networking activities that do not facilitate face-to-face interactions tend to erode trust, and this erosion can then negatively affect subjective well-being (independent of the online social interaction itself). Sabatini and Sarracino conclude that [...] "The overall effect of networking on individual welfare is significantly negative." [...] However, some scholars have expressed that concerns about social networking are often exaggerated and poorly researched.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} how innovation and corporate entrepreneurship <b>can</b> be <b>fostered</b> in Development Finance Institutions (DFI) {{by means of}} an innovation and corporate entrepreneurship training programme. Problem investigated: Development finance institutions are regarded as catalysts for development that needs to address both the market and public failure that results from underdevelopment. There is a need for an improved understanding of what the current state of entrepreneurial orientation is within the DFI’s as catalyst of development. An investigation into how innovation and corporate entrepreneurship in development finance institutions <b>can</b> be <b>fostered</b> needs to be investigated. Design/methodology/approach: This research is designed as a formal case study. To demonstrate that innovation and corporate entrepreneurship <b>can</b> be <b>fostered</b> in development finance institutions the study employed a pre-test-post-test control group true experimental design in which the innovation and corporate entrepreneurship climate was diagnosed. A comprehensive ICEAI (Innovation and Corporate Entrepreneurship Assessment Instrument, based on the Corporate Entrepreneurship Assessment Instrument of Kuratko, Hornsby & Montagno 1999) was developed to measure the level of innovation and corporate entrepreneurship in a development finance institution.
