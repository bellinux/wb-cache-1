40|$|The {{process of}} laser fusion cutting depends on {{physical}} quantities {{which are not}} adjustable directly, but established by the process itself.

50|$|Several {{methods are}} {{available}} for soft materials like plastic films and paper. Razor blades, straight, or circular blades are being used.

50|$|There {{are many}} {{variants}} of the cylinder mower. Push mowers have no engine {{and are usually}} used on smaller lawn areas where access is a problem, where noise pollution is undesirable and where air pollution is unwanted. As the mower is pushed along, the wheels drive gears which rapidly spin the reel. Typical <b>cutting</b> <b>widths</b> are 10 to 16 in. Advances in materials and engineering have resulted in these mowers being very light and easy to operate and manoeuvre compared with their predecessors while still giving all the cutting advantages of large professional cylinder mowers. Their distinct environmental benefits, both in noise and air pollution, are also strong selling points, something not lost on many international zoos, animal sanctuaries and exclusive hotel groups.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are three}} types of mowers: sickle bar mowers, disc mowers, and drum mowers. Sickle bar mowers use a {{reciprocating}} blade to cut the grass and typically use a reel to fold the grass over the knife. Disc mowers {{have a number of}} hubs across the <b>cutting</b> <b>width,</b> each hub having a small (18") rotating disc with knives. Drum mowers use two or three large plates (called the drums, about 36" [...] across) which ride over the ground as they are spinning. A sickle bar mower's main advantage over disc mowers and drum mowers is the reduced horsepower requirements. Its disadvantage is the extra maintenance required due to the high number of moving parts and wear items. Disc mowers were historically considered an [...] "all the eggs in one basket" [...] kind of mower because all the mower hubs were in one large gearbox. If one blade hit something and a gear tooth broke, the whole gearbox would suffer a catastrophic failure, and there would be nothing worth fixing. If anything broke, everything broke. Drum mowers prevented this by having typically two belt-driven drums compared to six or more gear-driven hubs. Modern disc mowers use isolated gearboxes, and if one fails it can be swapped out without rebuilding the entire machine.|$|E
5000|$|In wire {{electrical}} {{discharge machining}} (WEDM), also known as wire-cut EDM and wire cutting, a thin single-strand metal wire, usually brass, is fed through the workpiece, submerged in a tank of dielectric fluid, typically deionized water. Wire-cut EDM is typically used to cut plates as thick as 300mm and to make punches, tools, and dies from hard metals that are difficult to machine with other methods. The wire, which is constantly fed from a spool, is held between upper and lower diamond guides. The guides, usually CNC-controlled, move in the x-y plane. On most machines, the upper guide can also move independently in the z-u-v axis, giving rise to the ability to cut tapered and transitioning shapes (circle on the bottom, square at the top for example). The upper guide can control axis movements in x-y-u-v-i-j-k-l-. This allows the wire-cut EDM to be programmed to cut very intricate and delicate shapes. The upper and lower diamond guides are usually accurate to 0.004 mm, and can have a cutting path or kerf as small as 0.021 mm using Ø 0.02 mm wire, though the average cutting kerf that achieves the best economic cost and machining time is 0.335 mm using Ø 0.25 mm brass wire. The reason that the <b>cutting</b> <b>width</b> is greater than the width of the wire is because sparking occurs from the sides of the wire to the work piece, causing erosion. This [...] "overcut" [...] is necessary, for many applications it is adequately predictable and therefore can be compensated for (for instance in micro-EDM this is not often the case). Spools of wire are long — an 8 kg spool of 0.25 mm wire is just over 19 kilometers in length. Wire diameter can be as small as [...] and the geometry precision is not far from ± [...] The wire-cut process uses water as its dielectric fluid, controlling its resistivity and other electrical properties with filters and de-ionizer units. The water flushes the cut debris away from the cutting zone. Flushing {{is an important factor in}} determining the maximum feed rate for a given material thickness.Along with tighter tolerances, multi axis EDM wire-cutting machining centers have added features such as multi heads for cutting two parts at the same time, controls for preventing wire breakage, automatic self-threading features in case of wire breakage, and programmable machining strategies to optimize the operation.Wire-cutting EDM is commonly used when low residual stresses are desired, because it does not require high cutting forces for removal of material. If the energy/power per pulse is relatively low (as in finishing operations), little change in the mechanical properties of a material is expected due to these low residual stresses, although material that hasn't been stress-relieved can distort in the machining process.The work piece may undergo a significant thermal cycle, its severity depending on the technological parameters used. Such thermal cycles may cause formation of a recast layer on the part and residual tensile stresses on the work piece. If machining takes place after heat treatment, dimensional accuracy will not be affected by heat treat distortion.|$|E

These lasers are smaller, better, more cost-effective, and offer a processing "on the fly. " Of utmost importance is their excellent beam quality which enables us {{to reduce the size of}} the focussing head including the scanning mirrors. With the reduced mass of the mirrors we can reach scanning frequencies up to 1. 5 kHz and in special configurations up to 4 kHz. Using such mirrors with this high beam quality we can shape the key hole geometry, and thus it is possible to decrease the keyhole spiking, which always occur in the case of deep penetration welding. We can generate very thin and deep welding seams, which we have only experienced with electron beam welding. The excellent beam quality of the fiber lasers offers us a lot of new applications from deep penetration welding to high speed welding. By using beam scanning we are able to easily change the beam and the seam geometry. Furthermore, it is possible to work with this kind of laser from a distance of some meters between focussing/scanning head and the work piece. This technique is called remote processing or processing "on the fly. " The excellent beam quality also enables us to cut very precisely, and due to the small <b>cutting</b> <b>widths</b> with a very high speed.

Micro-grooving and micro-threading tools having <b>cutting</b> <b>widths</b> as small as 13 {micro}m are made by focused ion beam sputtering and used for ultra-precision machining. Tool fabrication involves directing a 20 keV gallium beam at polished cylindrical punches made of cobalt M 42 high-speed steel or C 2 tungsten carbide to create a number of critically aligned facets. Sputtering produces rake facets of desired angle and cutting edges having radii of curvature equal to 0. 4 {micro}m. Clearance for minimizing frictional drag of a tool results from a particular ion beam/target geometry that accounts for the sputter yield dependence on incidence angle. It is believed that geometrically specific cutting tools of this dimension have not been made previously. Numerically controlled, ultra-precision machining with micro-grooving tools results in a close match between tool width and feature size. Microtools are used to machine 13 {micro}m wide, 4 {micro}m deep, helical grooves in polymethyl methacrylate and 6061 Al cylindrical workplaces.

40|$|A {{well known}} phenomenon, the "built-up edge - BUE", {{occurs at the}} chip/tool {{interface}} when multiphase materials are machined at low cutting speeds.

40|$|Graduation date: 1992 The {{moulding}} and millwork industry consumes {{large quantities}} of shop grade lumber which is becoming less plentiful and of a lower quality. This fact has compelled industry to explore the use of new technology to increase product yield. One prospect for increasing yield is the application of thin-kerf sawing technology. This research investigated the effect of rip-kerf width on 5 / 4 Ponderosa pine cutting stock yield by calculating the yields of {{two hundred and fifty}} boards in each of three lumber grades. Each board's yield was calculated using computer sawing simulation for each combination of nine rip-kerf widths, from 0. 050 to 0. 250 inches, and four cutting bills. Analysis of variance and regression techniques were used to determine the relationships between rip-kerf <b>widths,</b> <b>cutting</b> bills and percent yield.
