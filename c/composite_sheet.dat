The {{objective of the}} present study was therefore, to prepare <b>composite</b> <b>sheets</b> by incorporating various plant fibers like enset (Ensete ventricosum), hibiscus (Hibiscus cannabinus), jute (Corchorus trilocularis L.), palm (Phoenix dactylifera) and sisal (Agave sisal) in various proportions into the leather waste. Resin binder (RB) and natural rubber latex (NRL) were used as binding agents for the preparation of the <b>composite</b> <b>sheets.</b> The <b>composite</b> <b>sheets</b> prepared were characterized for their physicochemical properties (tensile strength, elongation at break, stitch tear strength, water absorption, water desorption and flexing strength). <b>Composite</b> <b>sheets</b> prepared using RB having 10 % hibiscus, 20 % palm and 40 % sisal fibers showed better mechanical properties than their respective controls. In <b>composite</b> <b>sheets</b> prepared using NRL having 30 % jute fiber exhibited better mechanical properties than its control. Most of the plant fibers used in this study played a role in increasing the performance of the sheets. However, as seen from the results, the contribution of these plant fibers on performance of the <b>composite</b> <b>sheets</b> prepared is dependent on the ratio used and the nature of binder. The SEM studies have exhibited the composite nature of the sheets and FTIR studies have shown the functional groups of collagen protein, cellulose and binders.

40|$|The {{flexural}} rigidity, EI, {{plays an}} especially {{important role in}} fiber reinforced polymer <b>composite</b> <b>sheet</b> pile wall design. Determination of EI is usually affected {{by the presence of}} the shear either due to the short testing span or to the low shear modulus of composites. To reduce or eliminate the effect of shear on the determination of flexural rigidity of <b>composite</b> <b>sheet</b> pile panels, this paper is to propose a test method that is based on Bank’s multi-span approach and Timoshenko’s beam theory. Tests were performed using three-point and four-point bending set-ups, with single <b>composite</b> <b>sheet</b> pile panel at six different spans, and with connected two panels at eleven spans. The results showed that six EIs determined independently from different set-ups, at different deflection points along the beam and with different cross sections gave values that differed from each other by less than 3 %. The EI so determined was a constant independent from the test span, the test set-up, the location of the deflection point on the beam, or the number of data points used in linear regression. Apparent EIs calculated from single span tests were strongly span-dependent and approached asymptotically to the value determined by multi-span approach. It was likely that the multi-span approach yielded the highest possible flexural rigidity that could be measured. The shear effect was therefore eliminated...|$|E

Our objective was to render polymeric materials based on poly(trimethylene carbonate) (PTMC) osteoinductive, and to evaluate their suitability for use in orbital floor reconstruction. For this purpose, osteoinductive biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP) particles were introduced into a polymeric PTMC matrix. <b>Composite</b> <b>sheets</b> containing 50 wt% BCP particles were prepared. Also laminates with poly(D, L-lactide) (PDLLA) were prepared by compression moulding PDLLA films onto the <b>composite</b> <b>sheets.</b> After sterilisation by gamma irradiation, the sheets were used to reconstruct surgically-created orbital floor defects in sheep. The bone inducing potential of the different implants was assessed upon intramuscular implantation. The performance of the implants in orbital floor reconstruction was assessed by cone beam computed tomography (CBCT).

Each <b>composite</b> <b>sheet</b> structure was composed of four sheets: two core sheets of the same titanium alloy material - Ti 64 or Ti 54 M, and two external sheets of similar titanium alloy material - Ti 64 or Ti 6242.

The wall thickness of each inflated packs was measured via GOM scanning all features of the formed structures. The thickness reduction imposed by SPF to the component surfaces was found to be up to 59 % at some regions of the packs.
