50|$|The Alpha Monocerotids is {{a meteor}} shower with the {{international}} acronym AMO active in November, {{not to be confused}} with the December Monocerotids, international acronym MON. The swarm is visible every year from 15 to 25 November; its peak occurs on 21 or 22 November. The speed of its meteors is 65 km/s. Normally it has a low Zenithal Hourly Rate (ZHR), but occasionally it produces remarkable meteor storms that last less than an hour: such outbursts were observed in 1925, 1935, 1985, and 1995. Peter Jenniskens predicted the 1995 return based on the hypothesis that these outbursts were caused by the dust trail of a long period comet occasionally wandering in Earth's path due to planetary perturbations. During observations in southern Spain, assisted by a team of observers of the Dutch Meteor Society, Jenniskens confirmed that the meteoroids were moving in a long-period <b>comet</b> <b>orbit.</b> The outburst of 1995 allowed researchers to determine the exact radiant of the swarm and the solar longitude of its peak as well as to confirm the brevity of Alpha Monocerotids outbursts as less than one hour.

40|$|Abstract: The secular {{evolution}} of comet nucleus rotation states is studied. The dynamical model {{assumes that the}} nucleus inertia ellipsoid is axially symmetric and prolate. The outgassing torques, acting on the surface, are modeled using standard cometary activity formulae. The general rotational equations of motion are derived and separately averaged over the fast rotational dynamics terms and the <b>comet</b> <b>orbit.</b> Special cases where the averaging assumptions cannot be applied are evaluated separately. The modification of the <b>comet</b> <b>orbit</b> due to comet outgassing is neglected. Resulting from this analysis is a system of secular differential equations that describe {{the dynamics of the}} comet nucleus angular momentum and rotation state. We find that the qualitative secular {{evolution of}} the rotation state is controlled by a single parameter that combines parameters related to the <b>comet</b> <b>orbit</b> and parameters related to the nucleus surface geometry and activity.

The maximum mass M sub max for which this distribution holds uncertain but there are theoretical and observational indications that M sub max is at least approx. 10 (23) g. Chiron, although formally classified as an asteroid, is most likely a giant comet in this mass range. Its present orbit is unstable and {{it is expected to}} evolve into a more typical short period <b>comet</b> <b>orbit</b> on a timescale of approx. 10 (6) to 10 (7) yr. The breakup of a chiron-like comet of mass approx. 10 (23) g could in principle produce approx. 10 (5) Halley-size comets, or a distribution with an even larger number. If a giant comet was in a typical short period <b>comet</b> <b>orbit,</b> such a breakup could result in a relatively brief comet shower (duration approx. less than 10 (6) yr) with some associated terrestrial impacts. However, the most significant climatic effects may not in general be due to the impacts themselves but to the greatly enhanced zodiacal dust cloud in the inner Solar System. (Although this is probably not the case for the unique K-T impact). Researchers used a least Chi square program with error analysis to confirm that the 2 to 5 micrometer excess spectrum of Giclas 29 to 38 can be adequately fitted with either a disk of small inefficient (or efficient) grains or a single temperature black body.

The rough surface has round depressions from resolution limits (similar to 10 m/pixel) up to similar to 1 km across, spanning forms from crisp steep-walled pits, to subtle albedo rings, to topographic rings, with all ranges of morphologic gradation. Three gravitationally low regions of the comet have smoother terrain, parts of which appear to be deposits from minimally modified flows, with other parts likely to be heavily eroded portions of multiple layer piles. Changes observed between the two missions are primarily due to backwasting of scarps bounding one of these probable flow deposits.

40|$|The {{orbits of}} the known short-period comets under the {{influence}} of the Sun and all the planets except Mercury and Pluto are numerically integrated. The calculation was undertaken in order to determine the dynamical lifetimes for these objects as well as explaining the current orbital element distribution. It is found that a comet can move between Jupiter-family and Halley-family comets several times in its dynamical lifetime. The median lifetime {{of the known}} short-period comets from the time they are first injected into a short-period <b>comet</b> <b>orbit</b> to ultimate ejection is approximately 50, 000 years. The very flat inclination distribution of Jupiter-family comets is observed to become more distended as it ages. The only possible explanation for the observed flat distribution is that the comets become extinct before their inclination distribution can change significantly. It is shown that the anomalous concentration of the argument of perihelion of Jupiter-family comets near 0 and 180 deg is a direct result of their aphelion distance being close to 5. 2 AU and the comet being recently perturbed onto a Jupiter-family orbit. Also the concentration of their aphelion near Jupiter's orbit is a result of the conservation of the Tisserand invariant during the capture process...|$|E

This extraordinary event, which was witnessed by numerous casual observers, was recorded {{in the framework of}} the continuous fireball monitoring and meteor spectroscopy campaign performed by the SPanish Meteor Network (SPMN). Thus, because of optimal weather conditions, the bolide was imaged from ten meteor observing stations.

In order to investigate the evolutionary path of comets and asteroids in terms of both dynamical and physical properties, we performed spectroscopic observations of three objects discovered between 1990 and 1995 [...] (6042) 1990 WW_ 2, (6144) 1994 EQ_ 3, and 1995 QY_ 2 [...] and analyzed their orbital evolution.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the past {{evolution of the}} orbital elements of comet 67 P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, target of the Rosetta spacecraft. The gravitational orbit of the comet {{is affected by the}} sublimation of ice from the nucleus that triggers non-gravitational forces. The comet also experienced several close encounters with Jupiter especially in 1959 and 1923 (less than 1 AU). These perturbations cause the chaoticity of the <b>comet</b> <b>orbit</b> at short time scale. The goal {{of this paper is to}} have a precise idea of the comet recent dynamical history. This is done in studying the mean trends of the comet orbital elements and also in characterizing its chaotic motion with the Fast Lyapunov indicator. To compute these mean trends, two sets (considering or not the non-gravitational forces) of 1000 clone orbits of the comet were considered. This paper shows that the last close encounter with Jupiter on February 4 ^th, 1959 drastically modified the orbital elements of the comet (especially the perihelion distance from more than 2. 7 AU prior the encounter to 1. 3 AU after the encounter). The motion of the comet is also shown to be chaotic before the close encounter with Jupiter on October 2 ^nd, 1923. The mean trends of the orbital elements of the comet are also presented in this paper (for two time scales : 275 years in the past and 10, 000 years in the past) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{abundance}} and properties of dust particles {{larger than about}} 60 m emitted by comet 67 P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko are constrained by evaluating astronomical images of its dust trail. Such particles carry the bulk of refractory mass released from comets to interplanetary space. In contrast to smaller particles, they remain on trajectories {{similar to that of}} the parent comet during many revolutions around the Sun. They are observable as a narrow structure along the projected <b>comet</b> <b>orbit,</b> the dust trail. The first observation evaluated in this thesis was carried out in April 2004 in visible light with the Wide Field Imager on the ESO/MPG 2. 2 m telescope on La Silla (Chile), when the comet was at a heliocentric distance of 4. 7 AU. Two observations were performed in August 2005 and April 2006 at mid-infrared wavelengths (24 m) with the MIPS instrument on board the Spitzer Space Telescope. In both instances, the comet was at 5. 7 AU from the Sun, having passed aphelion in November 2005. To interpret the data, simulated images of the cometary dust trail are generated. The adopted model of cometary dust emission has five free parameters: the exponent of the dust size distribution, the particle emission speeds, the radiation pressure efficiency, the dust albedo, and the dust production rates. For these parameters, values are derived that are most suitable to reproduce the observations. The results for the first four parameters are in agreement with expectations.

40|$|By phenomenologically {{assuming}} a slow temporal {{variation of the}} percent acceleration rate S̈ S^- 1 of the cosmic scale factor S(t), it is shown that the orbit of a local binary undergoes a secular expansion. To first order in the power expansion of S̈ S^- 1 around the present epoch t_ 0, a non-vanishing shift per orbit 〈Δ r〉 of the two-body relative distance r occurs for eccentric trajectories. A general relativistic expression, {{which turns out to}} be cubic in the Hubble parameter H_ 0 at the present epoch, is explicitly calculated for it in the case of matter-dominated epochs with Dark Energy. For a highly eccentric Oort <b>comet</b> <b>orbit</b> with period P_ b≈ 31 Myr, the general relativistic distance shift per orbit turns out to be of the order of 〈Δ r〉≈ 70 km. For the Large Magellanic Cloud, assumed on a bound elliptic orbit around the Milky Way, the shift per orbit is of the order of 〈Δ r〉≈ 2 - 4 pc. Our result has a general validity since it holds in any cosmological model admitting the Hubble law and a slowly varying S̈ S^- 1 (t). More generally, it is valid for an arbitrary Hooke-like extra-acceleration whose elastic parameter K is slowly time-dependent, irrespectively of the physical mechanism which may lead to it. The coefficient K_ 1 of the first-order term of the power expansion of K(t) can be preliminarily constrained in a model-independent way down to a K_ 1 ≲ 2 × 10 ^- 13 yr^- 3 level from latest Solar System's planetary observations.

Several researchers have investigated numerous applications of low-thrust EP including a manned Mars mission, scientific missions to the outer planets, and lunar missions.

In response {{to the release of}} NASA's 1994 Announcement of Opportunity (AO) for Discovery class interplanetary exploration missions, a preliminary investigation of a lunar comet rendezvous mission using a solar {{electric propulsion}} (SEP) spacecraft was performed. The Discovery mission (eventually named Diana) was envisioned to be a two-phase scientific exploration mission: the first phase involved exploration of the moon and second phase involved rendezvous with a comet. The initial phase began with a chemical propulsion translunar injection and chemical insertion into a lunar orbit, followed by a low-thrust SEP transfer to a circular, polar, low-lunar orbit (LLO). After scientific data was collected at the moon, the SEP spacecraft performed a spiral lunar escape maneuver to begin the interplanetary leg of the mission. After escape from the Earth-moon system, the SEP spacecraft maneuvered in interplanetary space and performed a rendezvous with a short period comet.
