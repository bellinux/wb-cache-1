(KBR) Transport Gasifier {{train with}} a Siemens Westinghouse Power Corporation (Siemens Westinghouse) particle filter {{system at the}} Power Systems Development Facility (PSDF) located in Wilsonville, Alabama. The Transport Gasifier is an advanced circulating fluidized-bed gasifier designed to operate as either a combustor or a gasifier in air- or oxygen-blown mode of operation using a particulate control device (PCD). The Transport Gasifier was operated as a pressurized gasifier during TC 10 in air- (mainly for transitions and problematic operations) and oxygen-blown mode. Test Run TC 10 was started on November 16, 2002, and completed on December 18, 2002. During oxygen-blown operations, gasifier temperatures varied between 1, 675 and 1, 825 F at pressures from 150 to 180 psig. After initial adjustments were made to reduce the feed rate, operations with the new fluidized coal feeder were stable with {{about half of the}} total coalfeed rate through the new feeder. However, the new fluidized-bed coal feeder proved to be difficult to control at low feed rates. Later the <b>coal</b> <b>mills</b> and original <b>coal</b> feeder experienced difficulties due to a high moisture content in the coal from heavy rains. Additional operational difficulties were experienced when several of the pressure sensing taps in the gasifier plugged. As the run progressed, modifications to the mills (to address processing the wet coal) resulted in a much larger feed size. This eventually resulted in the accumulation of large particles in the circulating solids causing operational instabilities in the standpipe and loop seal. Despite problems with the <b>coal</b> <b>mills,</b> <b>coal</b> feeder, pressure tap nozzles and the standpipe, the gasifier did experience short periods of stability during oxygenblown operations.

40|$|Pulverized {{coal-fired}} power plants are increasingly used in electric grid load compensation. The intermittent electricity production of wind and solar power plants causes sudden load changes in the electric grid which must be balanced by operating steam power plants cyclically. Rapid load changes cause new challenges to plant operators. 	 Dynamic simulation is {{a powerful tool for}} investigating the transient behavior of a power plant that is operated cyclically. Process changes and new control strategies are often needed when base load power plants are used in cyclic operation mode. New solutions can be tested with a computer-aided dynamic simulation software. A dynamic model of pulverized {{coal-fired power}} plant requires a realistic <b>coal</b> <b>mill</b> model. Also it is important to define thermo-mechanical stresses in stress-prone boiler components during the cyclic operation. These features improve the transient simulation of pulverized {{coal-fired power plants}}. 	 This thesis focuses on examining and improving the transient simulation of pulverized coal-fired power plants in dynamic simulation software Apros. The main objectives of this thesis are implementation and validation of a generic <b>coal</b> <b>mill</b> model as well as the verification and validation of Apros thermo-mechanical stress calculation. The <b>coal</b> <b>mill</b> model was implemented by using the user component feature of Apros, whereas the thermo-mechanical stress calculation was implemented with a stress solver component which has been earlier added to Apros component library. 	 Two pulverized coal-fired power plant simulation models were utilized in the validation experiments. Model of reference plant A was received from the plant operator whereas modelling of reference plant B was part of this work. The dynamic validation of the <b>coal</b> <b>mill</b> model was done by simulating the same load change transients that have been measured during cyclic operation of the reference plants. The stress calculation was verified against literary reference and validated against calculation based on standard EN- 12952 - 3 (Water-tube boilers and auxiliary installations.

40|$|Biomass {{combustion}} {{has increasingly}} {{been used in}} pulverised fuel coal fired power stations {{as a way of}} addressing a wide range of emissions reduction targets. The reuse of existing equipment such as <b>coal</b> <b>mills</b> is essential to minimise the costs of conversion. However the fundamental fracture mechanics involved in biomass comminution are completely different to coal. Thus a thorough knowledge of the comminution properties of all biomass types in <b>coal</b> and biomass <b>mills</b> is necessary in order to minimise operational issues and to optimise milling and combustion. This thesis provides extensive novel characterisation on densified biomass before and after milling. The study analysed 9 densified biomasses, 2 non-densified biomasses, and a sample coal in five different mills; planetary ball mill, Hardgrove Grindability Index testing mill, Bond Work Index ball mill, cutting mill, and a ring-roller mill. Milling was found to have little impact on particle shape, even when an order of magnitude change in particle size was observed. Particle shape is inherent to the particles which comprise a pellet, and is determined by the pre-densified comminution processes. Milling had little impact on compositional particles of herbaceous or wood pellets. Olive cake had the most spherical of all the materials. Thermal pre-treatments of woody biomass not only saw a significant improvement in grindability in all mills, but also enhanced shape factors. The Hardgrove Grindability Index is a poor indicator of the grindability of biomass. The Bond Work Index can be used to analyse the choking potential of biomass pellets prior to full scale mill trials. To optimise <b>milling</b> in <b>coal</b> <b>mills,</b> biomass pellets should be composed of particles close to the required size so that only the pellet comminution stage occurs. The milling behaviour of densified biomass in a laboratory scale ring-roller mill with dynamic classification was investigated for the first time. The milling studies showed that knowledge of a materials critical particle size for comminution through compression is essential to understand its milling behaviour in different mills. The results presented in this thesis not only provide new insight and addresses significant gaps in knowledge, they also provide useful and practical guidance for addressing operational issues such as mill choking, as well as ways to optimise biomass comminution in laboratory and full scale mills, such as mill classifier optimisation based on real particle characteristics...|$|R
