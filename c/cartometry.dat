The first part of the paper contains the biography of the cartographer and the summary of his other work. In the second part I completely analyse the map and all the elements of the map's frame. The map is rated also in the view of <b>cartometry.</b> In the following part of the work I accomplish the semiotic analysis of map's key with the comparison with other historical maps of Bohemia. In {{the last part of the}} paper I compare all the publications of Vogt's map. Within the framework of the analysis I create the map based on the Vogt's map in GIS.

40|$|Kartometrická a {{semiotic}}ká analýza Vogtovy mapy Čech Abstrakt Cílem této práce je kompletně analyzovat historickou mapu Čech, kterou vytvořil v roce 1712 Mauritius Vogt. První část práce se zabývá samotnou osobností kartografa a jeho dalšími díly. V druhé části celkově analyzuji mapu i všechny prvky mapového rámu. Mapa je hodnocena i z hlediska kartometrie. Dále následuje semiotická analýza mapového klíče s porovnáním s dalšími historickými mapami Čech. Jako poslední srovnávám všechna vydání Vogtovy mapy. V rámci práce je také na základě Vogtovy mapy vytvořena mapa v prostředí GIS.

40|$|Considerable recent cartographic {{research}} has focussed upon the theory, methods, and <b>cartometry</b> {{associated with the}} generalization of line featuresonmaps. Theinverse of the generalization transformation, enhancement, has received comparatively little attention with afew notable exceptions which use fractal methods. This study implements Dutton's enhancement method and uses the equivalent theory but an alternative method (Fourier Analysis) to present a parallel, but more analytically flexible technique. While the Fourier method requires an initial equidistant resampling of the points along a string, the reduced number of control parameters, and the shape-related metadata evident in the Fourier transform make the method an attractive alternative to the Dutton technique, particularly when further resampling is used. Test data sets from Dutton's work and for the Long Island, New York coastline were used to demonstrate and empirically compare the two methods...|$|E
40|$|The North America in Early Maps Abstract The {{objective}} of this thesis is to analyze selected map works of European cartographers h showing the territory of North America in the period from 16. to 19. century. Using the cartometric and semiotic methods the map attributes are analyzed focusing the detection and description of the cartographic projection. Next, within {{the analysis of the}} topographic content the map symbols and the language of the map are discussed and interesting geographical mistakes of the authors are noticed. On the basis of the partial analyzes the progression of the continent depiction is documented with emphasis on the progression of map symbols and on the change of the shape of the continent in the given period.

40|$|The {{subject of}} this paper is the systematization and precise {{identification}} of the structure of river networks in Montenegro in both planimetric and hypsometric dimensions, using <b>cartometry.</b> This includes the precise determination of the morphometric parameters of river flows, their numerical display, graphical display, and documentation. This allows for a number of analyses, for example, of individual catchments, the mutual relations of individual watercourses within a higher order catchment, and the classification of flows according to river and sea basins and their relationship to the environment. In addition, there is the potential for expanding the database further, with a view to continuous, systematic, scientific and practical follow-up in {{all or part of the}} geographic space. The cartometric analysis of the river network in Montenegro has a special scientific, and also a social value. In the geographical structure of all countries, including Montenegro, rivers occupy a central place as individual elements and integral parts of the whole. There is almost no human activity which is not related to river flows, or related phenomena and processes. The river network as part of a geographic space continues to gain in importance, and therefore studying it must connect with the other structural elements within which it functions. These are the basic relief characteristics, climate, and certain hydrographic characteristics. A complete theoretical and methodological approach to this problem forms the basis for a scientific understanding of the significance of the river network of Montenegro...|$|E
40|$|During {{the summer}} months of July and August 1989, {{approximately}} 23 years after a photogrammetric survey on August 22, 1966, Peyto Glacier, a glacier selected for study during the International Hydrologic Decade (IHD) 1965 - 74, was re-surveyed using terrestrial geodetic surveying techniques. The volumetric and morphologic change of Peyto Glacier, Alberta from 1966 to 1989 is estimated through a combined application of digital <b>cartometry,</b> digital geodetic survey and Triangulated Irregular Network (TIN) digital terrain modeling and analysis. Changes in glacial volume, areal extent, teriminus position, percentage basin glaciation, slope, and aspect for the 23 year interval are shown. Additionally, a 1 : 10000 contour map of the 1989 Peyto Glacier is presented. The volumetric change of Peyto Glacier {{is estimated to be}} - 154. 6 10 ^ 6 m 3 and compares favourably with the figure of - 155. 3 106 m 3 obtained through a directly measured accumulation/ablation stake network. The surface area of Peyto Glacier 1989 is estimated at 12. 04 km 2, a loss of 1. 07 km 2 from the 1966 surface area of 13. 11 km 2. The terminus of Peyto Glacier has retreated 592 m. Significant ablation of the glacier surface below approximately 2600 masl has occurred. A maximum of 86 m vertical loss was measured in the ablation zone. Slope and aspect analysis reveals that although significant ablation has occurred below 2600 masl, surface geometry has remained remarkably similar. This is also true of the hypsometry which, {{with the exception of the}} area below 2100 masl, shows areal distributions have changed little over the twenty-three years. Despite complications encountered with aspects of the surface data sets, examination of the methods applied suggests that in situ digital geodetic surveying in concert with TIN DTM analysis is an efficient, reliable, and relatively inexpensive means of assessing glacial morphologic and volumetric change...|$|E
