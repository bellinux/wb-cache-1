40|$|The {{subject of}} the comment {{is related to the}} recent view {{granting}} the protection provided by article 1168 c. c. to cohabiting partner. The previous prevailing view, which is now outdated, spoke about detention for hospitality reasons, comparing the <b>cohabitee</b> to a guest and denying active legitimation to recovery.

In any case, if we admit that the title justifying co-possession derives from the emotional bond as if by magic, the permanency of that title once the affectio has ceased remains unexplained. It is not clear how – and especially why - the above-mentioned title, by then no longer existing, could then be enforced against the (third) holder, compared to whom the <b>cohabitee</b> is an irrelevant legal entity for the purposes of possession.

40|$|The article {{discusses}} basic {{aspects of}} cohabitation without {{marriage in the}} light of family law. In Poland, the problems of cohabitation without marriage are not dealt with by family law instruments. Most issues are resolved on a civil law basis. Besides, the Supreme Court has several times held that even a mutatis mutandis application of family law provisions to <b>cohabitees</b> is not allowed. However, {{it does not mean that}} family law is entirely excluded from the regulation of relations arising in the marriage-like families. In particular, if the cohabiting couple has their own children, the relations between the children and their parents are regulated by means of family law provisions. It is worth stressing that in Polish law children born out of wedlock enjoy all inheritance and maintenance right towards their unmarried fathers; in turn, such fathers have full parental authority (with some exceptions) over their natural children. The other issue of importance in connection with marriagelike unions is that of the influence of cohabitation on the duty to pay alimony vested in a former spouse of one of the <b>cohabitees.</b> Generally, cohabitation does not lead to an automatic termination of the duty of support. However, it may be considered one of the circumstances the existence of which may lead to the modification of the duty of support, or - in some extreme cases - to the termination of such a duty. Finally, cohabitation does not have any direct influence on the duty of one of the <b>cohabitees</b> to pay alimony to his or her former spouse.

40|$|OBJECTIVE-To {{assess the}} risk of {{cardiorespiratory}} symptoms and mortality in non-smokers who were passively exposed to environmental smoke. DESIGN [...] Prospective study of cohort from general population first screened between 1972 and 1976 and followed up {{for an average of}} 11. 5 years, with linkage of data from participants in the same household. SETTING [...] Renfrew and Paisely, adjacent burghs in urban west Scotland. SUBJECTS [...] 15, 399 Men and women (80 % of all those aged 45 - 64 resident in Renfrew or Paisley) comprised the original cohort; 7997 attended for multiphasic screening with a <b>cohabitee.</b> Passive smoking and control groups were defined {{on the basis of a}} lifelong non-smoking index case and whether the <b>cohabitee</b> had ever smoked or never smoked. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE [...] Cardiorespiratory signs and symptoms and mortality. RESULTS [...] Each of the cardiorespiratory symptoms examined produced relative risks greater than 1. 0 (though none were significant) for passive smokers compared with controls. Adjusted forced expiratory volume in one second was significantly lower in passive smokers than controls. All cause mortality was higher in passive smokers than controls (rate ratio 1. 27 (95 % confidence interval 0. 95 to 1. 70)), as were all causes of death related to smoking (rate ratio 1. 30 (0. 91 to 1. 85] and mortality from lung cancer (rate ratio 2. 41 (0. 45 to 12. 83)) and ischaemic heart disease (rate ratio 2. 01 (1. 21 to 3. 35)). When passive smokers were divided into high and low exposure groups on the basis of the amount smoked by their cohabitees those highly exposed had higher rates of symptoms and death.

40|$|Magister Legum - LLMSouth Africa {{has come}} a long way from the rigid family {{structures}} which existed in the past. This is demonstrated by the recognition afforded to couples in same-sex relationships as well as those in customary marriages. Proposals have also been set forth regarding law reform to protect the rights and interests of those involved in domestic partnerships. The Domestic Partnership Bill was promulgated in 2008 but to date has not been passed into law. The ensuing consequence is that cohabitation relationships are therefore self-regulated. This relationship has no legal status as a union in South Africa. The court have, however, recognised that a universal partnership could be established if certain criteria are met. Furthermore, heterosexual couples are now also recognised as a "dependant" in actions against the Road Accident Fund for loss of support as a result of death of the breadwinner. Unlike South Africa, cohabitation in Sweden is regulated by a dedicated law called the Cohabitees Act 2003. The Act provides comprehensive protection than that afforded to cohabitants in South Africa. It offers a clear definition of cohabitation and criteria in order to qualify as a <b>cohabitee.</b> The Act, further, regulates the proprietary consequences of entering into such a relationship and the effects of termination. Cohabitation has status as a legal union in Sweden. My research will deal with non-formalised cohabitation and a comparison shall be made between the current systems in South Africa and Sweden. My work will suggest that the statutory model of regulation in Sweden may provide a solution for South Africa. In South Africa, cohabiting couples are not afforded the same rights as married couples. In contrast, married couples are afforded rights automatically as a result of the institution. Unmarried partners have no automatic duty of support, to acquire an interest each other's separate property and a <b>cohabitee</b> may not inherit intestate from the estate in the event of death of one of the partners. In Sweden, intimate relationships are treated similarly to married relationships, with the law applying the principle of "neutrality" with regard to its family laws. Several cases have emerged recently in South Africa which will provide a clearer understanding of the current state of the law. The reason for undertaking this study is to illustrate the changing mores of society and the necessity of the law to keep up with these values. As South Africa has not yet passed its domestic partnership law it may be useful to compare it to Sweden in order provide South Africa with a possibly better approach. Sweden has passed laws on cohabitation and these have been in place for years. Thus we might still learn from them prior to our law being passed. Legislative and judicial activity have soared recently and it may be beneficial to look at another jurisdiction more carefully. These observations will be undertaken more comprehensively in the body of the thesis...|$|E
40|$|AbstractContextIncreasing {{numbers of}} people will die from chronic disease. Families {{contribute}} significantly to end-of-life care, but their role may not be recognized. ObjectivesTo 1) establish the proportion of older cohabitees identified in primary care as “carers”; 2) describe demographic and lifestyle characteristics of cohabitees of people terminally ill with cancer, dementia, and {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD); 3) describe their health a year before and after bereavement; and 4) compare health outcomes between cohabitees of people dying with cancer, COPD, or dementia. MethodsRetrospective cohort study using a U. K. primary care database (The Health Improvement Network) of 13, 693 bereaved cohabitees (a proxy marker for being a carer), aged 60  years or older of people dying from cancer, COPD, or dementia. Characteristics were described one year before and after bereavement. We compared cancer, COPD, and dementia <b>cohabitee</b> outcomes using incidence rate ratios one year before and after bereavement and calculated mortality risk after bereavement. ResultsA total of 6. 9 % of cohabitees were recorded as carers. Health outcomes differed little between the three groups of cohabitees in the year before or after bereavement. The proportion of cohabitees with six or more consultations increased the year after bereavement (cancer cohabitees 16. 0 % to 18. 8 %, COPD cohabitees 17. 8 % to 20. 4 %, and dementia cohabitees 15. 5 % to 17. 5 %). At postbereavement (follow-up median 3  years, interquartile range 1. 3 – 5. 4), we found no mortality differences between the three groups.
