30|$|The {{screening}} and <b>confirmatory</b> <b>assay</b> cut points were statistically determined {{based on the}} current industry white papers (Jani et al., 2015; Shankar et al., 2008). A screening cut point was derived from 50 treatment-naive ALL patients (BioreclamationIVT) by targeting a 5 % false-positive rate to minimize potential false-negatives. The assay cut point {{was derived from the}} 95 th percentile of the log-transformed normalized relative light unit (RLU) values from each plate after removal of statistical outliers (Shankar et al., 2008). For the <b>confirmatory</b> <b>assay,</b> confirmatory cut point was calculated by testing serum samples from 50 treatment-naive patients with ALL (BioreclamationIVT). The serum samples were incubated with an excess amount of InO before analysis in a competitive binding format (Jani et al., 2015). For each sample, the percentage inhibition values in the <b>confirmatory</b> <b>assay</b> were calculated. The <b>confirmatory</b> <b>assay</b> cut point was derived from the 99 th percentile of the log-transformed normalized RLU values from each plate.

40|$|AbstractObjective: To {{investigate}} {{the utility of}} a prototype rapid confirmatory HIV assay which offers specific results in 5 min and has applications {{in a variety of}} important testing situations. Methods: The performance of the rapid <b>confirmatory</b> <b>assay</b> was assessed with 849 blood samples, including serum, plasma, venipuncture whole blood, and peripheral blood collected via fingerstick. Included were over 700 HIV Western blot (WB) -confirmed antibody positive sera, and others which were classified as negative or indeterminate by WB. The analytic sensitivity of the rapid <b>confirmatory</b> <b>assay</b> was assessed using 13 HIV- 1 seroconversion panels, and all results were compared to those of an FDA-licensed WB reference test. Results: The rapid test exhibited 100 % concordance with the reference test when testing HIV- 1 W 13 -confirmed positive samples, and 92. 3 % concordance with samples having WB-inconclusive results. The sensitivity for confirming recent seroconversion was as good, or better than, the FDA-licensed HIV- 1 WB in 1013 panels. The rapid assay performed accurately with whole blood collected from fingerstick, and exhibited excellent precision and reproducibility. Conclusion: We conclude that this rapid HIV <b>confirmatory</b> <b>assay,</b> the first of its kind, demonstrates proof of principle for the accurate confirmation of HIV- 1 infection and offers important advantages in public health and clinical testing venues...|$|E

CLSI M 53 -A guideline no longer recommends using Western Blot for confirmation of HIV reactive results due {{to the number of}} false-negative and indeterminate results it yields. The objective of this literature review is to systematically review the performance and operational characteristics of HIV <b>confirmatory</b> <b>assays</b> that meet the CLSI M 53 -A guidelines. Method: “PubMed” and “EMBASE” databases were used to conduct a systematic literature review and identified the potential relevant publications after June 2011. Publications related to the performance and operational characteristics of HIV <b>confirmatory</b> <b>assays</b> applicable to the CLS M 53 -A guideline were retrieved, evidence were compelled and synthesized. Findings: Performance characteristics: sensitivity analysis for individual <b>confirmatory</b> <b>assays</b> were as follow: 100 % for recomLine HIV- 1 /HIV- 2; 100 % for INNO-LIA HIV I/II; 95. 3 %- 100 % for Geenius HIV 1 / 2; 100 % for RIBA HIV- 1 / 2; and 98. 3 %- 100 % for Multispot.

40|$|Although {{screening}} for Trypanosoma cruzi antibodies is mandatory in most South American countries, current tests are insensitive and have poor specificity. A recently optimized line immunoassay (the INNO-LIA Chagas assay) for the serological confirmation of Chagas' disease was evaluated {{at a large}} blood bank in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Sera from blood donors who reacted {{in at least one}} of three serological screening assays (n = 1, 604) and who returned for a follow-up were retested, and the donors were interviewed to assess their epidemiological risk The results obtained by the <b>confirmatory</b> <b>assay</b> evaluated in this study were compared to those obtained by the three different screening assays. Upon consideration of the consensus results obtained by the three different screening assays as a "gold standard," the INNO-LIA Chagas assay showed a sensitivity of 99. 4 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 98. 3 to 99. 9) and a specificity of 98. 1 % (95 % CI, 96. 6 to 99. 0) for positive (n = 503) and negative (n = 577) sera. The INNO-LIA Chagas assay confirmed the results for significantly larger numbers of positive samples of at-risk individuals independent of the number of positive screening tests (P = 0. 017, Mantel-Haenszel test).

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{in detail}} the effect of infection or vaccination on the human immune system, ELISpot assays are used to simultaneously test the immune response to {{a large number of}} peptides of interest. Scientists commonly use "peptide pools", where, instead of an individual peptide, a test well contains a group of peptides. Since the response from a well may be due to any or many of the peptides in the pool, pooled assays usually need to be followed by <b>confirmatory</b> <b>assays</b> of a number of individual peptides. We present a statistical method that enables estimation of individual peptide responses from pool responses using the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm for "incomplete data". We demonstrate the accuracy and precision of these estimates in simulation studies of ELISpot plates with 90 pools of 6 - 7 peptides arranged in three dimensions and three Mock wells for the estimation of background. In analysis of real pooled data from 6 subjects in a HIV- 1 vaccine trial, where 199 peptides were arranged in 80 pools if size 9 or 10, our estimates were in very good agreement with the results from individual-peptide <b>confirmatory</b> <b>assays.</b> Compared to the classical approach, we could identify almost all the same peptides with high or moderate response, with less than half the number of confirmatory tests. Our method facilitates efficient use of the information available in pooled ELISpot data to avoid or reduce the need for confirmatory testing. We provide an easy-to-use free online application for implementing the method, where on uploading two spreadsheets with the pool design and pool responses, the user obtains the estimates of the individual peptide responses...|$|R
40|$|Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) is {{the leading}} cause of community-acquired urinary tract infections (UTIs), with over 100 million UTIs {{occurring}} annually throughout the world. Increasing antimicrobial resistance among UPEC limits ambulatory care options, delays effective treatment, and may increase overall morbidity and mortality from complications such as urosepsis. The polysaccharide capsules of UPEC are an attractive target a therapeutic, based on their importance in defense against the host immune responses; however, the large number of antigenic types has limited their incorporation into vaccine development. The objective of this study was to identify small-molecule inhibitors of UPEC capsule biogenesis. A large-scale screening effort entailing 338, 740 compounds was conducted in a cell-based, phenotypic screen for inhibition of capsule biogenesis in UPEC. The primary and concentration-response assays yielded 29 putative inhibitors of capsule biogenesis, of which 6 were selected for further studies.

40|$|Onchocerciasis, or river blindness, has {{historically}} represented {{one of the}} significant neglected tropical diseases on the planet in terms of socio-economic impact. The discovery that ivermectin was a safe and effective treatment for onchocerciasis, together with {{the decision of the}} manufacturer to donate the drug for the treatment of this disease became the basis for several large international programs to control and eventually eliminate the infection. These programs have managed to virtually eliminate transmission of the parasite causing Onchocerca volvulus from many foci in Africa and the Americas. Verifying that transmission has been halted requires sensitive and specific assays to detect the presence of the parasite. The gold standard to accomplish this has been to employ a PCR assay targeting a specific repeated sequence family encoded in the genome of O. volvulus to screen for the presence of the parasite in pools of vector black flies. While this assay is highly sensitive, obtaining the high specificity required to document an absence of transmission requires an independent <b>confirmatory</b> <b>assay.</b> To meet this need, an independent PCR assay targeting the cytochrome B (cytB) gene of the O. volvulus mitochondrion was developed. This assay could detect O. volvulus mitochondrial DNA purified by magnetic bead capture using the primers for the cytB gene and from the nuclear encoded repeated sequence DNA targeted in the primary assay. These preliminary data suggest that the mitochondrial PCR assay may be employed as a <b>confirmatory</b> <b>assay</b> to detect O. volvulus in pools of vector flies...|$|E

A total of 2780 samples, including 1306 HIV-positive, {{were included in the}} analysis. HIV testing algorithms were designed using Determine as a first test. Second and third rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) were selected based on site-specific performance, adhering where possible to the WHO-recommended minimum requirements of sensitivity and specificity of ≥ 99 %. The threshold for specificity was reduced to 98 % or 96 % if necessary. We also simulated algorithms consisting of one RDT followed by a simple <b>confirmatory</b> <b>assay.</b> The positive predictive values (PPV) of the simulated algorithms varied from 75. 8 %- 100 % using strategies recommended for high-prevalence settings; 98. 7 %- 100 % using strategies recommended for low-prevalence settings; and 98. 1 %- 100 % using a rapid test followed by a simple <b>confirmatory</b> <b>assay.</b> Although we were able to design algorithms that met the recommended PPV of ≥ 99 % in five of six sites using the applicable high prevalence strategy, options were often very limited due to sub-optimal performance of individual RDTs and to shared false-reactive results.

The NsppID assay detected Neisseria spp. in 150 / 181 COBAS-positive specimens (82 %), including six dual infections, and identified N. gonorrhoeae in 102 (56 %) specimens. Sixty-nine of 181 (38 %) specimens were positive for N. gonorrhoeae by porA pseudogene, and 115 / 181 (64 %) were positive for cppB.

A total of 437 specimens, from 10 countries were collected and sent to the WHO Collaborating Center in Sao Paulo and used to evaluate 19 screening assays during 2001 through 2005. Specimens were assigned a positive or negative status based on concordant results in at least three of the four <b>confirmatory</b> <b>assays</b> (indirect immunofluorescence, Western blot, radioimmunoprecipitation assay, and recombinant immunoblot). Of the 437 specimens, 168 (39 %) were characterized as positive, 262 (61 %) were characterized as negative, and 7 (2 %) were judged inconclusive and excluded from the analysis. Sensitivity and specificity varied considerably: 88 to 100 and 60 to 100 percent, respectively. Overall, enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) performed better than the other screening assays. Four EIAs had both parameters higher than 99 percent. Of the four <b>confirmatory</b> <b>assays,</b> only the RIPA gave a 100 percent agreement with the final serologic status of the specimens. The sensitivities and specificities of at least four of the {{commercially available}} EIAs for Chagas disease are probably high enough to justify their use for single-assay screening of blood donations. Our data suggest that the majority of commercially available indirect hemagglutination assays should not be used for blood donor screening and that the RIPA could be considered a gold standard for evaluating the performance of other assays.

Compared with real-time RT-PCR, the new assay had sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 76. 5 % (52 / 68), 99. 7 % (342 / 343), 98. 1 % (52 / 53), and 95. 5 % (342 / 358), respectively. The sensitivity of the assay was 81. 8 % (18 / 22) for GII. 3 and 75. 7 % (28 / 37) for GII. 4. None of the 38 enteric virus-positive specimens (3 for astrovirus, 5 for enteric adenovirus, and 30 for rotavirus) tested positive in the cross-reactivity test performed by using this assay. The new immunochromatographic assay may be a useful screening tool for the rapid detection of norovirus in sporadic and outbreak cases; however, negative results may require <b>confirmatory</b> <b>assays</b> of greater sensitivity...|$|R
40|$|Lupus {{anticoagulants}} (LA) are immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM, IgA or a mixture) that {{interfere with}} in vitro phospholipids (PL) dependent coagulation tests. Variable test results among LA positive individuals are due to the heterogeneous nature of the antibodies and differences in reagent/instrument systems. A laboratory’s ability to differentiate LA from other coagulation abnormalities and to accurately establish PL dependence {{is determined by the}} sensitivity and responsiveness of screening assays and specificity of confirmatory tests. The Third International Survey on Lupus Anticoagulants (ISLA- 3) was organized to assess current protocols for LA testing and determine the sensitivity and specificity of confirmatory tests. A written survey and samples for evaluation were sent to 41 participants from five continents. A majority of laboratories performed 2 screening tests and all performed mixing studies if a screening test was abnormal. Confirmatory tests were done if mixing studies suggested the presence of an inhibitor. New <b>confirmatory</b> <b>assays</b> proved to be more specific than methods previously in place.

40|$|Prompted by reports {{challenging}} {{the validity of}} the low-positive Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis results generated by the APTIMA Combo 2 assay (Gen-Probe, Incorporated) and by a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendation to confirm N. gonorrhoeae- or C. trachomatis-positive screens by using an alternative amplification target, we report on a comparison of this means of confirmation with an in-house algorithm of repeat testing. Primary clinical specimens yielding N. gonorrhoeae- or C. trachomatis-specific luminescent values between 100, 000 and 1, 000, 000 were repeat tested in duplicate. A subset of specimens was forwarded for confirmatory assays (Gen-Probe) individualized for alternative N. gonorrhoeae or C. trachomatis targets. An 18 -month audit revealed that 230 of 29, 977 C. trachomatis screens (0. 8 %) and 41 of 29, 064 N. gonorrhoeae assays (0. 1 %) yielded low-positive data. When a subset of 40 low-positive N. gonorrhoeae screens was repeat tested, 20 (50. 0 %) remained positive; 22 (55. 0 %) of the screens remained positive following performance of the <b>confirmatory</b> <b>assay.</b> In contrast, repeat testing of 153 low-positive C. trachomatis screens yielded a positive result for fewer specimens (n = 97; 63. 4 %) than when commercial confirmatory testing was used (n = 124; 81. 0 %). However, confirmation of the results for additional C. trachomatis screens by use of an alternative target did not translate into significant differences in the calculated overall C. trachomatis-positive screen rates (7. 39 % by repeat testing versus 7. 52 % by the confirmatory assay; P = 0. 53). Furthermore, use of the <b>confirmatory</b> <b>assay</b> raised the positive predictive value only 1. 8 % over that of repeat testing. Molecular confirmatory testing did not significantly enhance the reliability of C. trachomatis- or N. gonorrhoeae-specific nucleic acid amplification testing in this metropolitan setting compared to the reliability of repeat testing...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIntroductionThe CLSI-M 53 -A, Criteria for Laboratory Testing and Diagnosis of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Infection; Approved Guideline {{includes}} an algorithm in which samples that are reactive on a 4 th generation EIA screen proceed to a supplemental assay that {{is able to}} confirm and differentiate between antibodies to HIV- 1 and HIV- 2. The recently CE-marked Bio-Rad Geenius HIV- 1 / 2 <b>Confirmatory</b> <b>Assay</b> was evaluated {{as an alternative to}} the FDA-approved Bio-Rad Multispot HIV- 1 /HIV- 2 Rapid Test which has been previously validated for use in this new algorithm. MethodsThis study used reference samples submitted to the Canadian – NLHRS and samples from commercial sources. Data was tabulated in 2 × 2 tables for statistical analysis; sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, kappa and likelihood ratios. ResultsThe overall performance of the Geenius and Multispot was very high; sensitivity (100 %, 100 %), specificity (96. 3 %, 99. 1 %), positive (45. 3, 181) and negative (0, 0) likelihood ratios respectively, high kappa (0. 96) and low bias index (0. 0068). The ability to differentiate HIV- 1 (99. 2 %, 100 %) and HIV- 2 (98. 1 %, 98. 1 %) Ab was also very high. ConclusionThe Bio-Rad Geenius HIV- 1 / 2 <b>Confirmatory</b> <b>Assay</b> is a suitable alternative to the validated Multispot for use in the second stage of CLSI M 53 algorithm-I. The Geenius has additional features including traceability and sample and cassette barcoding that improve the quality management/assurance of HIV testing. It is anticipated that the CLSI M 53 guideline and assays such as the Geenius will reduce the number of indeterminate test results previously associated with the HIV- 1 WB and improve the ability to differentiate HIV- 2 infections...|$|E

Rabbit (Rb) anti-G 544 and anti-calicheamicin polyclonal antibodies were used as positive controls (PCs). For the screening assay, high and low PCs were prepared using Rb anti-G 544 serum at 1 : 75 and 1 : 750 dilutions, respectively, in the assay matrix. Affinity purified antibodies were used for sensitivity testing during validation. For the <b>confirmatory</b> <b>assay,</b> 2 PCs (Rb anti-G 544 and Rb anti-calicheamicin) were used. For cut point determinations, 50 samples of ALL human serum were procured from BioreclamationIVT (Westbury, NY) and stored at −[*] 70  °C until analysis.

40|$|Bacillus anthracis {{remains a}} serious bioterrorism concern, and the {{currently}} licensed vaccine remains an incomplete solution for population protection from inhalation anthrax {{and has been}} associated with concerns regarding efficacy and safety. Thus, understanding how to generate long-lasting protective immunity with reduced immunizations or provide protection through postexposure immunotherapeutics are long-sought goals. Through evaluation of a large military cohort, we characterized the levels of antibodies against protective antigen and found that over half of anthrax vaccinees had low serum levels of in vitro toxin neutralization capacity. Using solid-phase epitope mapping and <b>confirmatory</b> <b>assays,</b> we identified several neutralization-associated humoral epitopes and demonstrated that select antipeptide responses mediated protection in vitro. Finally, passively transferred antibodies specific for select epitopes provided protection in an in vivo lethal toxin mouse model. Identification of these antigenic regions has important implications for vaccine design and the development of directed immunotherapeutics. Bacillus anthracis has been used for over 60 years as a biological weapon.

40|$|The {{ability to}} detect HIV- 2 and to {{discriminate}} between HIV- 1 and HIV- 2 infections was evaluated in 46 serum samples from Guinea-Bissau (GB) and Guinea-Conakry (GC) using serological tests and commercial (HIV- 1) and in-house (HIV- 2) real-time PCR assays. Samples were first identified as HIV- 2 positive by Genie I/II assay in GB and GC. HIV positivity was detected in 44 of 46 samples by all screening and <b>confirmatory</b> <b>assays.</b> A diagnostic strategy based on Inno-LIA and HIV- 1 / 2 RNA detection assays allowed accurate discrimination between HIV- 1 and HIV- 2 in 84 % of single infections and confirmed 32 % of double infections. In samples with double reactivity in the Inno-LIA test and no detection of both genomes, cross-reactivity likely hampered the identification of true double infections. In conclusion, {{the implementation of a}} diagnostic strategy, based on multiple specific serological tests and highly sensitive quantitative PCR assays, is recommended to ensure accurate HIV- 2 diagnosis and appropriate therapy for individuals from areas in which the virus is endemic...|$|R
40|$|The {{sensitivity}} and specificity of four real-time PCR assays (HPA A(H 1) v, CDC A (H 1) v, HPA A(N 1) v and NVRL S-OIV assays) was evaluated for detection of influenza A(H 1 N 1) v viruses. Nose and throat swab samples containing influenza A(H 1 N 1) v viruses, seasonal influenza AH 3 N 2, AH 1 N 1, influenza B viruses, or negative for influenza viruses were tested by the four assays. Specificity was also analysed using influenza A viruses of different subtypes and non-related respiratory viruses. The sensitivities and specificities of the four assays were in a similar range and suitable for diagnostic use. The HPA (H 1) v and the S-OIV assays were the most sensitive assays {{for use as a}} first line test, but the S-OIV assay was less specific, detecting all avian subtypes of influenza A viruses tested. The results of this study demonstrate that the concurrent use of primary diagnostic and <b>confirmatory</b> <b>assays</b> provides rapid and accurate assessment of confirmed cases, and allows appropriate management of patients...|$|R
