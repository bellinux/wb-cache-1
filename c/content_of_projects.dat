40|$|This paper starts by {{providing}} a generic conceptual framework to improve understanding of critical success factors for the social effectiveness of programmes that promote workplace innovation. Thereafter, the paper shows how this framework can be applied in making choices about the <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>projects</b> in the programmes. A distinction is made between user-oriented, method-based, and learning network types of project. The three types are examined and compared, {{in terms of their}} ability to provide four kinds of outcomes, programme learning and policy learning. The paper also shows how learning networks can be applied to overcome some of the problems involved in the two other types of project. In elaborating the argument, the author makes use of the experiences gained from the implementation of learning network projects in the Finnish Workplace Development Programme TYKES.

40|$|During my {{bachelor}} studies I had {{opportunity to}} become an author of three inter-connected creative projects and {{to work on their}} gradual development. The main principle of these projects lied in an approach of working with kinetic and light objects in a way that classical wooden puppet is used. Final form of the bachelor work as well as <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>projects</b> is based on my individual understanding of theatre. It can be described as the author´s experimentation in the border between theatre and visual arts. In {{the first part of the}} bachelor work a brief historical overview is presented. The main point is to stress important incentives that I follow in my own performances. Particular focus is put on activities of contemporary Czech artist Petr Nikl and his theatre Mehedaha. The second part of the work describes creation and subsequent processes of three performances: The Peacock Complaining To Juno, Sequence 1 and Sequence 2. The conclusion at the end of the work summarizes all my experiences and findings. Illustrated appendix offers the opportunity to make a comparison between performances by looking at photographs taken during the show. There is also a CD with video record of Sequence 1 and a Sequence 2 attached...|$|E
40|$|REDD+ (Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation) {{has been}} {{launched}} by its proponents as a transformative forest management mechanism {{with the potential}} to shift the rationalities of forestry actors towards conservation and non- timber production through financial incentives and carbon trade. A number of recent studies have demonstrated a turn towards non-carbon related objectives and benefits in international discourses on REDD+. There has, however, been a lack of studies examining the logic and articulation of this shift in national and local REDD+ programmes. This study contributes to address this gap in knowledge through a qualitative study of the design and implementation of REDD+ in Indonesia and the Indonesian REDD+ pilot province of Central Kalimantan. The main findings in the study is that the content of the Indonesian and Central Kalimantan have shifted towards non-carbon objectives by introducing socioeconomic development and governance reform as prerequisites for successful programme implementation. This aligns the <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>projects</b> and activities with the interests of local stakeholder groups and increase local support for the project. Due to the lack of financial incentives available trough REDD+, a continued emphasis on non-carbon objectives is necessary for maintaining local support and participation. This restricts the potential for effectively reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and raises questions about the future prospects of the international REDD+ mechanism...|$|E

40|$|The year of Humanitarian Engineering draws our {{attention}} to the need to develop engineers who are not just technically competent but who can effectively address the needs of communities, maintain their ethical responsibilities, and take sustainability into consideration. This is what we understand by inclusive engineering. One approach to introducing such considerations into the curriculum has been the widespread use of Engineers Without Borders (EWB) projects in development settings as first year learning opportunities. We are evaluating different uses of these projects in 13 universities around Australia and New Zealand using a program logic data gathering methodology and a critical realist analytic approach to answer the research question “what works for whom under what circumstances?” In this paper we will concentrate mainly on one of these sites The University of Queensland. Data reveals that the EWB projects have great potential for raising issues of community involvement, ethics and sustainability but that the <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>projects</b> alone cannot guarantee that such objectives are addressed. Contextual factors, including: the focus of the course (e. g. professional development versus design), the attitudes of staff, and the pedagogy used all contribute to the successful pursuit of non-technical objectives. Projects with little obvious humanitarian or inclusive content such as one for long-wall supports in mining were found to foster context-sensitive approaches. In addition to project content, educators who are seeking to develop humanitarian and inclusive engineers need to pay attention to consistently expressed goals and values amongst the teaching team and the alignment of assessment (in style and weighting) with clearly stated learning goals...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{practices}} of religious management used by radical modernizing states, usually labeled 2 ̆ 7 secular. 2 ̆ 7 The method applied is a comparative historical study of institutional and ideological practices, principally legal and educational reforms, as revealed in constitutional and other key legal texts, curricular documents and textbooks, and significant speeches and writings of major regime figures. The cases studied are the French Third Republic, the Turkish Republic of the single-party period, and Arab nationalist republics, principally Tunisia under Bourguiba and Syria under the Ba 2 ̆ 7 th Party. The study finds that these so-called secular states find uses for religion in a particular form. That form reflects Rousseau 2 ̆ 7 s notion of the Civil Religion, and its genealogy leads back to Rousseau via the French Revolution. Latter-day Jacobins follow the early Revolutionary French National Assembly in nationalizing religion, follow Robespierre in seeking to reform it from above, and follow Napoleon in bureaucratizing it into an effective arm of the state 2 ̆ 7 s ideological machinery. In other words, twentieth century revolutionaries such as Atatürk or Arab nationalist regimes have carried out projects of political secularization that do not seek to remove religion from public life, but rather attempt to harness it to their projects of political transformation and state- and nation-building. Even where social conditions {{are very different from}} those facing the first Jacobins in France, for example in terms of which religion is dominant or the degree of religious and other diversity, their ideological descendents have pursued similar strategies with apparently similar ends. By studying both the institutional paths chosen and the ideological <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>projects</b> of political secularization across regions and cultures, this inquiry contributes to the understanding of comparative secularizations and secularisms. The story told here of these particular cases may illuminate projects pursued more broadly among later-developing states. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper reports upon {{articles}} on project management and their contents from the literatures of 9 industry sectors that recognize project management as a theoretical or practical field. The paper answers to: What are the theoretical and theme <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> <b>project</b> management in existing research in various sectors?, and; What are the commonalities and differences across sectors? We use bibliometric and qualitative analysis to identify sector-specific theoretical and theme contents, {{using data from}} the ISI Web of Science journal databases for 1986 - 2009, basing our analysis on 2, 354 project management articles in altogether 564 journals. This work contributes to existing research by recognizing common orientations in 9 different sectors, as well as differences across sectors.
