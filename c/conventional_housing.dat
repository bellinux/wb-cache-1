The houses were identical except one had insulating concrete form (ICF) exterior {{walls and the}} other had conventional wood-framed exterior walls. Monitoring commenced in July 2000 and continued for eleven months. The houses were unoccupied and operated on the same simple schedules. The total energy consumption from July 2000 through June 2001 (estimated for June 2001) showed that the ICF house used 7. 5 % less energy than the <b>conventional</b> <b>house.</b> The monitoring provided data sufficient to validate annual energy usage models of the two houses as they were tested. The validated models for the unoccupied houses on simple schedules were exercised {{for a range of}} climates that included heating dominated and cooling dominated. TMY 2 weather data were used to simulate the different climates. The ICF house used 5. 5 % to 8. 5 % (6. 8 % in the Knoxville climate) less energy annually than the <b>conventional</b> <b>house.</b> In Knoxville, changing from unoccupied houses with simple operation to normal occupancy and operation increased the annual savings for the ICF house relative to the <b>conventional</b> <b>house</b> to 9. 2 %. This advantage of the ICF <b>house</b> over the <b>conventional</b> <b>house</b> decreased only slightly to 9. 0 % when minimal energy usage was postulated for both houses during the swing season in East Tennessee.

40|$|SUMMARY Buildings demand {{energy in}} their life cycle. Energy use is, among others, {{restricted}} by the Energy Performance Standard (EPN), which is a standard determining the quantity of energy that new buildings are allowed to use, compelling them {{to comply with a}} required energy performance. The output of an energy performance calculation is the energy performance coefficient (EPC), which expresses the energy efficiency of a building. In 1996, the EPC for residential buildings was set at 1. 4. Currently, the EPC is set at 0. 6 and expectations are that the EPC will increase even further. To address current building standards, the building practices of <b>conventional</b> <b>houses</b> are adjusted. Meanwhile, the demand for even more sustainable houses rises. A renowned sustainable house is the passive house, which aims at minimizing the building’s operating energy. A more unusual sustainable construction type is an earthship, which is designed to operate on a self-sufficient basis and is largely constructed from recycled and reclaimed materials. This research compares <b>conventional</b> <b>houses,</b> passive houses and earthship based on legislation, environmental impact and operating energy. In this research the environmental impact is calculated based on the energy needed to manufacture all the building materials used in a building. The operating energy is defined as the energy used for heating of a building during is operational phase. First of all, the rules on sustainable building and legislation were researched. Secondly, the most important building materials used in the three construction types are investigated with respect to their availability and recyclability. Subsequently, a SimaPro model is used to assess the environmental impact of the building materials. The results will indicate the environmental impact on human health, ecosystems and resources. Furthermore, an Excel model and a DoMUS model are used to look at the operating energy. The results give the transmission losses of the different construction types. Literature shows that all construction types fit within the Dutch rules and regulations, alt-hough for earthships some adjustments are made. Therefore, based on legislation, it is concluded that all three construction types are sustainable. The SimaPro model shows that the <b>conventional</b> <b>house</b> has the lowest and the earthship the highest environmental impact. It can be concluded that, <b>conventional</b> <b>houses</b> are more sustainable than passive houses and earthships. As the general idea behind passive houses and earthship is that they recover the extra energy used for the production of building materials when the houses are in use, it interesting to look at the operating energy. The Excel and DoMUS model show that passive houses lose significantly less heat than <b>conventional</b> <b>houses.</b> Earthships perform roughly the same as <b>conventional</b> <b>houses,</b> provided that they have insulation in the floor. In general, it can be concluded that passive house are more sustainable than <b>conventional</b> <b>houses</b> and earthship with XPS insulation in the floor. Presumably, an earthship performs better than a <b>conventional</b> <b>house</b> when thermal storage in the earthship walls is taken into account. Based on the results, it can be concluded that in relative terms both <b>conventional</b> <b>houses</b> and passive houses are more sustainable and thus suitable for the Dutch market than earthship. With regard to earthships, this research gives a cautious negative advise. ...|$|R

Many people are {{adapting to the}} concept of living and experiencing the passive house standard compared to the more popular <b>conventional</b> <b>house.</b> The author believes that the two aspects that drive the passive house perception is the owner’s personal interest in wanting to embrace the passive concept and the end results of minimalistic heating bills. This dissertation focuses on the thermal comparison of the building fabric between <b>conventional</b> <b>house</b> construction and passive house construction. The purpose of the research is to give the reader a clear understanding of what is involved within the thermal insulation of the building fabric. An important aspect of this dissertation is to make sure all necessary information in relation to the building fabric is clarified. It is important to give the reader an insight into the comparison between a <b>conventional</b> <b>house</b> and a passive house. An analysis of the buildings methods were compiled into a case study where a comparison of the various elements were carried out. This dissertation has found that when comparing the <b>conventional</b> <b>house</b> against the passive house, not only were the U-values significantly more efficient for the passive house but also elements such as airtightness, heating loads, energy demand and building energy ratings have all been favourable towards the passive house. It also identifies potential heat saving aspects that passive house occupants would benefit from...|$|R

40|$|House price {{modeling}} {{has been}} frequently used {{to investigate the}} dynamics of housing markets, especially competitive markets; yet less {{attention has been given}} to markets that have experienced considerable interventions.

We first describe and classify the <b>conventional</b> <b>house</b> price models into asset-pricing house price model, stock-flow model, multi-period utility model, and repayment model. These models are subsequently applied to the Netherlands, where considerable government interventions took place. As expected, the empirical results are unsatisfactory to explain the Dutch house price development. The degree of mismatch of the repayment model and the multi-period utility model, however, seems to be fairly limited. </p...|$|R
