5|$|In the {{preparation}} of bean dip, various types of beans can be used, including black beans, pinto beans, kidney beans, white beans, fava beans, lima beans and edamame, a preparation of immature soybeans in the pod. Some bean dips incorporate several bean varieties into the dish, such as three-bean dip. Raw beans that are soaked and cooked are used, as are prepared <b>canned</b> beans and refried beans. The use of <b>canned</b> beans {{can result in a}} creamier dip, because beans prepared in canneries are pressure cooked in the can. <b>Canned</b> beans may have a salty flavor, which can be reduced by rinsing and then draining them. Fresh cooked beans may contribute to a more flavorful dish compared to using <b>canned</b> beans. Prepared <b>canned</b> green chili peppers are also sometimes used as a main ingredient.|$|E

5|$|As at Oak Ridge, {{the most}} {{difficulty}} was encountered while canning the uranium slugs, which commenced at Hanford in March 1944. They were pickled to remove dirt and impurities, dipped in molten bronze, tin, and aluminum-silicon alloy, <b>canned</b> using hydraulic presses, and then capped using arc welding under an argon atmosphere. Finally, they {{were subjected to}} a series of tests to detect holes or faulty welds. Disappointingly, most <b>canned</b> slugs initially failed the tests, resulting in an output {{of only a handful of}} <b>canned</b> slugs per day. But steady progress was made and by June 1944 production increased to the point where it appeared that enough <b>canned</b> slugs would be available to start Reactor B on schedule in August 1944.|$|E

5|$|Clam dip is {{typically}} prepared using chopped or minced clams, sour cream or cream cheese, and various seasonings, and usually served chilled. It {{is used as}} a dip for potato chips, bread, crackers, and crudités. It has a creamy texture and mouthfeel. <b>Canned,</b> cooked, and frozen or fresh clams may be used, the latter of which can be cooked by steaming or pan cooking. <b>Canned</b> clams can be drained, or the liquid can be retained and used as an ingredient. After refrigeration, the dip may thicken, and the liquid from <b>canned</b> clams can be used to thin the dip. Milk or cream is also sometimes used to thin clam dip. When refrigerated overnight, the flavors of the ingredients intermingle more greatly, resulting in a more flavorful dip. Smoked clams are sometimes used, which imbues a distinct smoky flavor to the dip. The clams can be smoked in the shell and then minced afterward.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1950s in the United States, the first {{televised}} recipe for clam dip {{appeared on the}} Kraft Music Hall show, a well-known and popular radio and television variety program that ran from 1933 to 1971. After the recipe segment aired, <b>canned</b> clams in New York City sold out within 24 hours. The ingredients used in this recipe were minced <b>canned</b> clams, cream cheese, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, salt and pepper. Clam dip remained popular throughout the 1960s in the U.S., at which time prepared manufactured clam dips were available in U.S. supermarkets. As salsa became more popular among American consumers, the popularity of clam dip declined.|$|E

5|$|Most of {{the food}} eaten by station crews was frozen, {{refrigerated}} or <b>canned.</b> Menus were prepared by the cosmonauts, {{with the help of}} a dietitian, before their flight to the station.

Meals were spaced out through the day to aid assimilation. <b>Canned</b> food such as jellied beef tongue was placed into a niche in the core module's table, where it could be warmed in 5–10 minutes.
