In this paper a histogram based feature extraction technique has been proposed to classify normal images and OSMF affected images using SVM.

40|$|Because {{physicians}} {{have been reluctant}} to accept <b>computerized</b> <b>medical</b> records systems, we sought to identify the barriers to acceptance and redesigned our ambulatory records system accordingly.

We formed a users group to educate users and the group has helped identify solutions to these problems. We equipped the exam room terminals with a user-friendly, patient-specific menu. We created a new physician interface for COSTAR that was organized to function similarly to a patient's chart and features user-friendly menus that provide cues to the unsophisticated user. Physician use of exam room terminals tripled after the installation of the exam room menu. The new physician interface doubled physician use of COSTAR's scheduling features. Acceptance of the new interface as gauged by a user survey was excellent, with the majority stating it improved their patient care...|$|R
