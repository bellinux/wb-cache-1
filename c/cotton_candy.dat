500|$|Written by Perry, Klas Åhlund, Max Martin, Adam Baptiste, and Caméla Leierth, [...] "Walking on Air" [...] {{discusses}} a love [...] "so {{strong that}} even heaven is jealous". Gil Kaufman from MTV {{commented on the}} song's composition: [...] "Between her wailing diva vocals, a gospel choir that kicks in during the final minute and the driving beat, Perry has captured a unique sound that both recalls the classic 1970s disco era {{as well as the}} EDM thump of today's clubs." [...] HitFix writer Melinda Newman opined that the song was [...] "redolent of '90s dance thumpers and is light as <b>cotton</b> <b>candy</b> and just as enjoyable", adding that it would [...] "make you long for C+C Music Factory". The song was also described as evoking the music of Swedish singer Robyn, an artist of whom Perry is a fan.|$|E
500|$|Generally, Joseph's music gets airplay in {{the adult}} contemporary, smooth jazz, easy listening, and {{beautiful}} music radio formats, and while some is classified in the new age genre, he considers contemporary instrumental to fit his style of playing the best. [...] In discussing Rapture, John Blake of The Atlanta Journal notes that often new age music sounds as if it should be played in a supermarket. The songs can sound like musical <b>cotton</b> <b>candy</b> — soft, airy and ultimately uninteresting. [...] "For the most part, Bradley's music doesn't make that mistake." [...] "The music is cinematic, filled with introspective piano solos, swelling violins, and a hypnotic song pacing that allows the listener to daydream." [...] Along the same line, Michael Debbage of Mainly Piano says that Rapture almost single-handedly gave a sense of hope that {{there was much more}} that the New Age genre could offer. [...] Cicily Janus remarks that, [...] "Although Bradley has been, at times, pigeon holed into an offshoot of jazz, his message through his music is universal in its appeal and soothing qualities." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Pink Matter" [...] is a bluesy lament with {{themes of}} sex and betrayal, as its narrator struggles between {{pleasure}} and universal meaning. Its lyrics allude to philosophical conundrums, extraterrestrial life, Japanese manga comics, and <b>cotton</b> <b>candy.</b> The playful [...] "Forrest Gump" [...] likens the titular film character to an adolescent crush, with homoerotic, tongue-in-cheek lyrics, and allusions to scenes in the film. It has a bright, Motown-inspired chorus, a simple rhythmic cadence, gently strummed guitar, wistful vocals, and a perkily whistled coda. The skit [...] "End" [...] depicts an exchange between Ocean and a woman as they make love {{in the backseat of}} a car with his 2012 song [...] "Voodoo" [...] playing over the stereo. She says to him, [...] "You're special. I wish you could see what I see", repurposing a line from the 2006 film ATL, and Ocean leaves the car in response, walks home through the rain, and sets his keys down with a sigh. The lighthearted, lovelorn [...] "Golden Girl" [...] has up-tempo synths, gradual fades, and Tyler, The Creator rapping in a low-pitched, demonic voice. It is about a girl that provides salvation and peace of mind for the narrator, who likens her to an island.|$|E

Soon, [...] coughs up a letter from , urging Twilight {{and her best}} friends to see her in Canterlot. On arrival, Celestia takes them to a grand hall with stained-glass windows, including one heralding the ponies' defeat of Nightmare Moon, and to the vault where the Elements of Harmony are kept. Celestia tells the ponies that the strange phenomena they have noticed is being caused by an old enemy of hers named , the spirit of chaos and disharmony. Celestia tells of how Discord once ruled Equestria in an eternal state of chaos before she and Luna defeated him by turning him into a stone statue (the Draconequus statue that stood in the sculpture garden). But he has recently escaped his prison and Celestia asks Twilight and her best friends to use the Elements of Harmony (as they previously did to defeat Nightmare Moon) to defeat Discord. However, as she offers the Elements to them, they are shocked to find that the box that normally holds the Elements is completely empty.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the music}} video, Perry {{is a game}} piece in Candyfornia, a game based in poker and board games. The {{settings}} are inspired in part by Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and the board game Candy Land, {{with much of the}} set decorated with cupcakes, ice creams, <b>cotton</b> <b>candy,</b> and lollipops. Snoop Dogg appears in the video as a king named [...] "Sugar Daddy" [...] that is holding several young women (Queens of Candyfornia) captive throughout the game, using candy related devices to hold them. Perry moves around, experimenting with objects. She moves through the land, making discoveries and freeing the women. In the chorus, she appears lying down on a <b>cotton</b> <b>candy</b> cloud, naked. Snoop Dogg tries to block her advances in many ways. When all the women are free, Perry leads them in a dance on the beach. Seeing the women freed, [...] "Sugar Daddy" [...] becomes enraged, marching on the women's position with an army of gummy bears. Perry, dressed in a red Wonder Woman like costume, quickly defeats the army with whip cream guns attached to her breasts, after which the stunned king throws down his staff and surrenders. The video ends with [...] "Sugar Daddy" [...] buried up to his neck in the sand by the women, nonetheless admiring their beauty and (in a nod to the Beach Boys song) wishing that women everywhere could be California girls. Various California landmarks appear in the video, such as the Hollywood Walk of Fame, the Hollywood Sign and some West Coast beaches which were all made out of confectionery.|$|E
2500|$|Their debut album, Mr. Bungle, was {{produced}} by jazz experimentalist John Zorn and was released on August 13, 1991. The cover featured artwork by Dan Sweetman, originally published in the story, [...] "A <b>Cotton</b> <b>Candy</b> Autopsy" [...] in the DC Comics/Piranha Press imprint title, Beautiful Stories for Ugly Children. The record mixed metal, funk, ska, carnival music and free jazz, but was normally described as funk metal by music critics. It received mostly positive reviews, with journalist Bill Pahnelas calling it [...] "an incredible musical tour de force". On {{the style of the}} album, critic Steve Huey wrote in AllMusic: [...] "Mr. Bungle is a dizzying, disconcerting, schizophrenic tour through just about any rock style the group can think of, hopping from genre to genre without any apparent rhyme or reason, and sometimes doing so several times in the same song." ...|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the primary}} attractions at the State Fair is {{the wide variety of}} foods to be had. Classic fair foods such as <b>cotton</b> <b>candy</b> and hot dogs are readily available. [...] Many foods reflect Minnesota's agriculture; cheese curds, milk shakes, and corn dogs are popular favorites. [...] Many foods at the fair are deep fried or come on a stick; from the classic corn dog to alligator-on-a-stick, lobster-on-a-stick, and deep fried candy bar on a stick. New to the fair in 2006 was hotdish on a stick, a variant of a classic staple of Minnesotan cuisine. In 2007, one new food was {{spaghetti}} on a stick. 2008's new foods included two types of bacon, one called [...] "Pig Lickers", which is chocolate covered, and the other, called the [...] "Big Fat Bacon", a quarter pound of maple glazed bacon.|$|E
2500|$|A popular Dairy Queen item is the Blizzard, {{which is}} soft-serve {{mechanically}} blended with mix-in ingredients such as sundae toppings and/or pieces of cookies, brownies, or candy.

During the 25th anniversary of the Blizzard, two special flavors were released: Strawberry Golden Oreo Blizzard and Buster Bar Blizzard.

Among the townspeople is Will's 54 year-old father, Charles Holloway who works in the local library, and who broods philosophically about life and the past. Both Mr. Holloway and the boys learn about the carnival that is to start the next day. Will's father sees a sign in a store window that advertises Cooger & Dark's Pandemonium Shadow Show, while Jim and Will find a similar handbill in the street. They are excited that a carnival has come so late in the year, but Charles Holloway has a bad feeling about it.|$|E
2500|$|Steve Juon of RapReviews said, [...] "Not every {{track on}} [...] "Lip Lock {{is a home}} run, but she bats for the cycle here and only strikes out a few times ("Keep Me From You" [...] is just too <b>cotton</b> <b>candy</b> for me). That's pretty {{incredible}} given how long she's been away. Who knows? Maybe she'll end up signing DMX to her imprint. She's got her life together, her businesses are successful, and she's still a bad bitch - but no longer afraid that showing her feminine side will make her come across soft or weak to a misogynistic audience. She can be the pitbull when necessary or the poodle when she feels like it and it's her flawless ability to switch it up that commands your attention." [...] Jim Farber of New York Daily News stated, [...] "To be specific, 11 long {{years have passed since}} the one-time Queen MC of Ruff Ryders Records completed a disc — 2002’s Eve-Olution. For the last six years, she’s been tinkering with tracks, leaking some out while experiencing increasing frustration with her label (Interscope). Small wonder the long-aborning Lip Lock appears on her own label. The lag may also explain why we’re hearing a more mature Eve here, less angry, more open to pop." [...] Elias Leight of PopMatters said, [...] "Eve tries to sound current—Lip Lock is consistently dense with electronics that nod to today’s pop-scape. No Neptunes and Dre here, but plenty of low frequency throbbing and high-pitched glitch noises. Eve doesn’t reach for the dance floor often, but this is hip-hop that acknowledges EDM and dub-step. There are a few songs that sound very different from the rest and instantly seem like outliers." ...|$|E
