40|$|ABSTRACTIn {{the present}} study, the wave {{excitation}} forces acting on {{an array of}} porous <b>circular</b> <b>cylinders</b> are examined based on diffraction problems. To calculate the wave forces, the fluid domain {{is divided into three}} regions i. e. a single exterior region, N interior regions and N beneath regions, and the diffraction in each fluid region is expressed by an eigenfunction expansion method with using 3 -dimension liner potential theory (Williams and Li, 2000). Especially, the present method is extended to the case of an array of truncated porous <b>circular</b> <b>cylinders</b> to calculate the heave forces as well as surge and sway forces. To verify this method, the numerical results obtained by eigenfunction are compared with these results obtained by higher order boundary element method (Choi et al., 2000). The numerical results obtained by this study are in good agreement with those results. By changing the numbers of porous <b>circular</b> <b>cylinders,</b> the angle of incident wave and the porosity rate of <b>circular</b> <b>cylinders,</b> the wave excitation forces such as surge, sway and heave on an array of truncated porous <b>circular</b> <b>cylinders</b> are investigated...|$|R

40|$|Electrochemical {{machining}} {{is widely}} used in the processing of difficult-to-machine metal materials. And through-mask electrochemical machining {{is a very important}} technology in the processing array structure of difficult-to-cut metal materials. Traditional through-mask electrochemical machining always uses a photoresist as the mask. The production process of a mask is complicated, and the mask cannot be reused. In this paper, through-active-mask electrochemical machining to process array structure in difficult-to-machine metal materials was investigated. Compared with traditional electrochemical machining masks, a copper-clad laminate is used to make the mask by mechanical machining in through-active-mask electrochemical machining. Also, the mask does not stick together with the workpiece but covers the workpiece by mechanical compaction, so the mask can be reused. In order to ensure the mask is in close contact with the workpiece, we need to arrange many compaction <b>circular</b> <b>cylinders</b> within the flow channel. The influences on electrolyte flow of compaction <b>circular</b> <b>cylinders</b> were investigated. The distribution of the compaction <b>circular</b> <b>cylinders</b> affects the electrolyte flow state, thereby affecting the processing. By analyzing the electrolyte flow state for the different distributions of compaction <b>circular</b> <b>cylinders,</b> one can find the best distribution of compaction <b>circular</b> <b>cylinders</b> for the required processing...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a brief overview}} of the predicted deformation and failure characteristics of noncircular composite cylinders subjected to torsion. Using a numerical analysis, elliptical cylinders with a minor-to-major diameter ratio of 0. 7 are considered. Counterpart <b>circular</b> <b>cylinders</b> with the same circumference as the elliptical cylinders are included for comparison. The cylinders are constructed of a medium-modulus graphite-epoxy material in a quasi-isotropic lay-up. Imperfections generated from the buckling mode shapes are included in the initial cross-sectional geometry of the cylinders. Deformations until first fiber failure, as predicted using the maximum stress failure criterion and a material degradation scheme, are presented. For increasing levels of torsion, the deformations of the elliptical cylinders, in the form of wrinkling of the cylinder wall, occur primarily in the flatter regions of the cross section. By comparison the wrinkling deformations of the <b>circular</b> <b>cylinders</b> are more uniformly distributed around the circumference. Differences in the initial failure and damage progression and the overall torque vs. twist relationship between the elliptical and <b>circular</b> <b>cylinders</b> are presented. Despite differences in the response as the cylinders are being loaded, at first fiber failure the torque and twist for the elliptical and <b>circular</b> <b>cylinders</b> nearly coincide...|$|R
40|$|The linear water wave {{scattering}} {{and radiation}} by {{an array of}} infinitely long horizontal <b>circular</b> <b>cylinders</b> in a two-layer fluid of infinite depth is investigated by use of the multipole expansion method. The diffracted and radiated potentials are expressed as a linear combination of infinite multipoles placed at the centre of each cylinder with unknown coefficients {{to be determined by}} the cylinder boundary conditions. Analytical expressions for wave forces, hydrodynamic coefficients, reflection and transmission coefficients and energies are derived. Comparisons are made between the present analytical results and those obtained by the boundary element method, and some examples are presented to illustrate the hydrodynamic behavior of multiple horizontal <b>circular</b> <b>cylinders</b> in a two-layer fluid. It is found that for two submerged <b>circular</b> <b>cylinders</b> the influence of the fluid density ratio on internal-mode wave forces is more appreciable than surface-mode wave forces, and the periodic oscillations of hydrodynamic results occur with the increase of the distance between two cylinders; for four submerged <b>circular</b> <b>cylinders</b> the influence of adding two cylinders on the wave forces of the former cylinders is small in low and high wave frequencies, but the influence is appreciable in intermediate wave frequencies.
