5|$|The {{reorganisation}} {{meant the}} number of appliances was reduced, until only three remained at the station. The <b>control</b> <b>room</b> at London Road closed in 1979, replaced by a single computerised <b>control</b> <b>room</b> at brigade headquarters in Swinton.|$|E
5|$|Aboard the Doctor's TARDIS, House {{threatens to}} kill Amy and Rory. He plays with their senses {{as they try}} to flee through the corridors, and then sends Nephew after them. Idris makes a psychic {{connection}} with Rory to give him directions to a secondary <b>control</b> <b>room</b> (identical to the 9th and 10th Doctor's TARDIS), where he and Amy are able to lower the TARDIS's shields without House's interference. This allows the Doctor to land the makeshift TARDIS in the secondary <b>control</b> <b>room,</b> which atomises Nephew. House deletes the secondary <b>control</b> <b>room</b> as he prepares to break through the rift, which the Doctor anticipates. The TARDIS's safety protocols transfer them to the main <b>control</b> <b>room,</b> where the dying Idris releases the TARDIS's matrix back to the TARDIS, destroying House. A remnant of the TARDIS's matrix, in Idris' body, sadly states that she {{will not be able to}} speak to the Doctor again but will be there for him. Idris's body then disappears as the TARDIS matrix is fully restored.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Amy and {{the clerics}} find the Angels {{moving away from}} the primary <b>control</b> <b>room.</b> One cleric goes to investigate, and finds the crack has grown wider, but then is soon {{consumed}} by it. Amy remembers this cleric, but none of the others do, as he had been erased from time. The crack continues to grow, and soon the other clerics are similarly consumed. The Doctor directs Amy to keep her eyes closed and work her way to the secondary <b>control</b> <b>room,</b> hoping that the Angels will not recognise that her eyes are shut. Amy falters and trips, but as the Angels move in, River is able to teleport her to the secondary <b>control</b> <b>room,</b> rescuing her.|$|E

25|$|The three Police Enquiry Centres (PECs) {{were formed}} in 2003, {{following}} {{the closure of}} local <b>control</b> <b>rooms,</b> to support the newly formed <b>control</b> <b>rooms</b> in Abingdon and Milton Keynes. They are located at the force headquarters in Kidlington, and separate teams within the Abingdon and Milton Keynes <b>control</b> <b>rooms.</b> The PECs handle all emergency, non-emergency and enquiry calls from the public.|$|R
50|$|There are 96 {{ambulance}} stations, six {{air ambulance}} bases, three clinical <b>control</b> <b>rooms</b> (999 <b>control</b> <b>rooms),</b> two Hazardous Area Response Team (HART) bases and one boat across the South Western Ambulance Service operational area.|$|R

5|$|Total drew {{attention}} to the unexplained absence from his post of the Gulf employee whose duty it was to supervise the unloading from the on-shore <b>control</b> <b>room.</b> The individual concerned had left the <b>control</b> <b>room</b> some time before the trouble started (see below) and his absence may have contributed to a lack of urgency in responding to events. Exactly what happened that night has never been established beyond doubt.|$|E
5|$|Amy starts {{becoming}} more afflicted {{by the image}} of the Angel in her eye, and the Doctor instructs her to keep her eyes closed, preventing her from seeing it. Octavian has the clerics guard Amy while he, the Doctor, and River make for a secondary <b>control</b> <b>room</b> {{on the other side of}} the oxygen factory. During this, the Doctor learns that River is Octavian's prisoner, promised a full pardon if she helped capture the Angel. Octavian is killed by an Angel but this allows the Doctor and River to enter and secure the <b>control</b> <b>room.</b> They analyze the crack the Doctor saw and confirm that the leaking energy came from an explosion in time, and are able to narrow the date of the explosion's epicenter.|$|E
50|$|A <b>control</b> <b>room's</b> {{purpose is}} {{production}} control, {{and serves as}} a central space where a large physical facility or physically dispersed service can be monitored and <b>controlled.</b> Central <b>control</b> <b>rooms</b> came into general use in factories during the 1920s.|$|R
50|$|As {{part of the}} {{national}} FiReControl project, Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue's <b>control</b> <b>rooms</b> were due switch over to a regional control centre in Taunton. Both <b>control</b> <b>rooms</b> were planned to cutover in May 2011, but the plan was formally scrapped in December 2010 by the Government.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Control</b> <b>rooms</b> for vital {{facilities}} are typically tightly secured and inaccessible {{to the general}} public. Multiple electronic displays and control panels are usually present, and {{there may also be}} a large wall-sized display area visible from all locations within the space. Some <b>control</b> <b>rooms</b> are themselves under continuous video surveillance and recording, for security and personnel accountability purposes. Many <b>control</b> <b>rooms</b> are manned on a [...] "24/7/365" [...] basis, and may have multiple people on duty at all times (such as implementation of a [...] "two-man rule"), to ensure continuous vigilance.|$|R
5|$|Caithness Horizons {{is a small}} {{museum that}} opened in 2008. The museum now houses panels from the <b>control</b> <b>room</b> at the Dounreay Materials Testing Reactor (DMTR), which in 1958 had become Scotland's first {{operation}} nuclear reactor.|$|E

5|$|The Doctor uses Amy's {{communication}} chip {{to track}} her location, and lands the TARDIS in the Silence's <b>control</b> <b>room</b> five days later. As River and Rory hold the Silence at bay, the Doctor shows them the live {{broadcast of the}} moon landing. As they watch, the Doctor uses his modification of the Apollo command module to insert Canton's recording of the wounded Silent into the footage of the landing. Because of this message, humans will now turn upon the Silence whenever they see them. The group frees Amy and departs in the TARDIS, while River kills all the Silence in the <b>control</b> <b>room.</b> Amy reassures Rory that the man he overheard her speaking of loving through the communication chip was him, not the Doctor.|$|E

5|$|The {{music video}} premiered on VEVO on December 14, 2011. Directed by Shane Drake, the video begins with Clarkson {{in a video}} <b>control</b> <b>room,</b> {{watching}} select flash mob videos submitted by various participants in different monitors. Throughout the video, scenes of Clarkson performing the song in three different settings (alone in a stage, with her band in a garden square, and in the <b>control</b> <b>room)</b> alternate with various flash mob videos. Towards {{the end of the}} video, Clarkson, along with the people in the garden square, forms a flash mob featuring a same choreography.|$|E
5|$|There is an {{astronomy}} podcast {{from the}} observatory, named The Jodcast. The BBC television programme Stargazing Live is hosted in the <b>control</b> <b>room</b> of the observatory. The programme has had four series, in January 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{commenced}} on {{the pilot}} separation plant before a chemical process for separating plutonium from uranium had been selected. In May 1943, DuPont managers {{decided to use}} the bismuth-phosphate process. The plant consisted of six cells, separated from each other and the <b>control</b> <b>room</b> by thick concrete walls. The equipment was operated remotely from the <b>control</b> <b>room.</b> Construction work was completed on 26 November, but the plant could not operate until the reactor started producing irradiated uranium slugs. The first batch was received on 20 December, allowing the first plutonium to be produced in early 1944. By February, the reactor was irradiating a ton of uranium every three days. Over the next five months, the efficiency of the separation process was improved, with the percentage of plutonium recovered increasing from 40 to 90 percent. X-10 operated as a plutonium production plant until January 1945, when it was turned over to research activities. By this time, 299 batches of irradiated slugs had been processed.|$|E

5|$|During the Second World War the {{basement}} was converted into an air-raid shelter and an extension {{built in the}} yard to provide more space in the <b>control</b> <b>room.</b> The fire services were nationalised in 1941, and London Road became the headquarters of Division C. In recognition of the fire fighters' efforts King George VI and Queen Elizabeth visited the fire station in 1942.|$|E
