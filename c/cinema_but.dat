25|$|Wood Street {{is home to}} Wood Street Indoor Market. The {{market was}} the site of a cinema from 1912 to 1955, {{operated}} by the Penny Picture Theatre Co. It re-opened under new independent management in 1953 as the Rio <b>Cinema,</b> <b>but</b> this was short lived and it closed in 1955. Now the market is filled with quirky market traders, and was documented in a short documentary made by Mark Windows.|$|E
25|$|The {{need for}} a new theatre had already become {{manifest}} in the artistic community around 1906. At the time the small São Geraldo Theatre (along the Avenida Central with Rua dos Chãos) was the only space used for theatre and <b>cinema,</b> <b>but</b> the larger Portuguese theatre companies could not stage any of their theatrical presentations in the limited stage. Artur José Soares, José António Velosos and Cândido Martins Iiderarm formed the Sociedade do Teatro Circo, and began collecting the materials from the demolished Convent on 16 December 1907.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the role in management of the Employees' Councils (which the workers' committees were transformed into after being properly constituted, with democratic elections supervised by the Elections Commission), commuter organisations were included in an advisory role. The services were expanded and measures were taken to improve efficiency, including rationalising bus types. The CTB started buying buses from the Isuzu Company of Japan, to offset any cartelisation by Tata and Ashok Leyland, the main suppliers, and also purchased Ikarus buses from Hungary. Several new bus stands and bus depots were established. A modern, multi-storied bus station was planned at the CBS, complete with hotel and <b>cinema,</b> <b>but</b> this would never be completed.|$|E

500|$|According {{to local}} film {{archivist}} and author Gary Lacher, the Oregon Theatre's record as the longest continuously operating adult cinema in Portland is [...] "not often acknowledged publicly" [...] and represents [...] "the last holdout of an era", {{referring to the}} prominence of adult film screenings in Portland. In an interview, Lacher expressed his wish that the theater would return to a more traditional <b>cinema,</b> <b>but</b> was thankful that the venue has been spared from closure and demolition to date.|$|E
500|$|The Tempest Anderson Hall is a 300-seat auditorium-style lecture theatre {{built in}} 1912 as an annexe to the Yorkshire Museum. [...] Dr Tempest Anderson, a York surgeon and vulcanologist, {{presented}} {{the hall to}} the Yorkshire Philosophical Society to replace its existing lecture theatre. [...] Designed by E Ridsdale Tate, it is an early example of the use of reinforced concrete and is a Grade I listed building. In the late 20th century it housed a <b>cinema,</b> <b>but</b> it is now used as a conference venue and lecture theatre.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} {{title of the}} film—Bicho de Sete Cabeças—is based on {{the song of the}} same name by Zé Ramalho and Geraldo Azevedo. Bodanzky declared that it was necessary to replace the book title because the film was not exactly the transposition of the book to <b>cinema,</b> <b>but</b> an adaptation inspired on it. This title can be translated to [...] "seven-headed beast;" [...] "fazer um bicho de sete cabeças" [...] ("to make a seven-headed beast") is an expression in Brazil commonly used to describe an overreaction that can be compared to the English expression [...] "to make heavy weather." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1983, Bill Owen {{suggested}} to a newly returned producer Alan J. W. Bell that Roy Clarke's novelisation {{of the show}} should {{be made into a}} feature-length special. Other British sitcoms such as Steptoe and Son and Dad's Army had previously produced films made for the <b>cinema,</b> <b>but</b> the BBC were initially sceptical as they had never before commissioned a film based on a comedy programme for original broadcast on television. They nevertheless commissioned a ninety-minute film named [...] "Getting Sam Home", which was broadcast on 27 December 1983, and started a trend which would continue with other British sitcoms, including Only Fools and Horses.|$|E
500|$|In the United Kingdom, {{the film}} {{shattered}} attendance records at the London Plaza <b>Cinema,</b> <b>but</b> nearly all British critics gave it poor reviews, questioning Hitchcock's taste and judgment. Reasons cited for {{this were the}} critics' late screenings, forcing them to rush their reviews, their dislike of the gimmicky promotion, and Hitchcock's expatriate status. Perhaps thanks to the public's response and Hitchcock's efforts at promoting it, the critics did a re-review, and the film was praised. TIME switched its opinion from [...] "Hitchcock bears down too heavily in this one" [...] to [...] "superlative" [...] and [...] "masterly", and Bosley Crowther put it on his Top Ten list of 1960.|$|E
500|$|Ian Conrich, another {{scholar of}} film studies, {{argues that the}} series marks a key {{departure}} from slasher norms in that death itself becomes the villain. Final Destination films draw influence from slasher <b>cinema,</b> <b>but</b> the franchise's action sequences, including Final Destination 3 roller-coaster derailment, draw from action and disaster cinema. The franchise, for Conrich, thus marks a new slasher-film subgenre: [...] "In relation to the scale and excess of these [...] sequences, the multiplicity of deaths that can occur in one moment, and the inevitability {{of death in the}} context of a wider scheme, I would term these films 'grand slashers'." [...] Other grand slashers include the films in the Saw and Cube franchises.|$|E

500|$|Hoffman took an unflattering role in Todd Solondz's Happiness (1998), a misanthropic {{comedy about}} the lives of three sisters and those around them. He played Allen, a strange loner who makes crude phone calls to women; the {{character}} furiously masturbates during one conversation, producing what film scholar Jerry Mosher calls an [...] "embarrassingly raw performance". Jake Coyle of the Associated Press rated Allen as one of the creepiest characters in American <b>cinema,</b> <b>but</b> critic Xan Brooks highlighted the pathos that Hoffman brought to the role. Happiness was controversial but widely praised, and Hoffman's role has been cited by critics as one of his best. His final 1998 release was more mainstream, as he appeared as a medical graduate in the Robin Williams comedy Patch Adams. The film was critically panned, but one of the highest-grossing of Hoffman's career.|$|E
500|$|Anupama Chopra {{writing for}} Hindustan Times gave it 3 out 5 stars and wrote, [...] "his {{is a film}} made with love, bolstered by wonderfully etched vignettes, Ranbir Kapoor's stupendous {{performance}} and a gorgeous soundtrack by Pritam. And yet, for me, Barfi was a singularly frustrating experience {{there was so much}} to like, but the film never became {{more than the sum of}} its parts". Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave 3 out of 5 stars and said, [...] "Barfi had the potential to be great <b>cinema,</b> <b>but</b> as it stands it's a respectable film that's still better than a lot else you're likely to see." [...] On the contrary, Namrata Joshi of Outlook felt that [...] "The flashback within flashback narrative gets way too clumsy and turgid, the thriller twist absolutely pointless [...] appears much too crafted and self-consciously gorgeous, and feels eminently facile and plastic".|$|E
500|$|As a filmmaker, Chaplin is {{considered}} a pioneer {{and one of the}} most influential figures of the early twentieth century. He is often credited as one of the medium's first artists. Film historian Mark Cousins has written that Chaplin [...] "changed not only the imagery of <b>cinema,</b> <b>but</b> also its sociology and grammar" [...] and claims that Chaplin was as important to the development of comedy as a genre as D.W. Griffith was to drama. He was the first to popularise feature-length comedy and to slow down the pace of action, adding pathos and subtlety to it. Although his work is mostly classified as slapstick, Chaplin's drama A Woman of Paris (1923) was a major influence on Ernst Lubitsch's film The Marriage Circle (1924) and thus played a part in the development of [...] "sophisticated comedy". According to David Robinson, Chaplin's innovations were [...] "rapidly assimilated to become part of the common practice of film craft." [...] Filmmakers who cited Chaplin as an influence include Federico Fellini (who called Chaplin [...] "a sort of Adam, from whom we are all descended"), Jacques Tati ("Without him I would never have made a film"), René Clair ("He inspired practically every filmmaker"), Michael Powell, Billy Wilder, Vittorio De Sica, and Richard Attenborough. Russian filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky praised Chaplin as [...] "the only person to have gone down into cinematic history without any shadow of a doubt. The films he left behind can never grow old." ...|$|E

500|$|That same year, Divine {{decided to}} get back in contact with his estranged parents. His mother had learned of his {{cinematic}} and disco career after reading an article about the films of John Waters in Life magazine, and had gone to see Female Trouble at the <b>cinema,</b> <b>but</b> had not felt emotionally able {{to get back in}} contact with her son until 1981. She got a friend to hand Divine a note at one of his concerts, leading Divine to telephone her, and the family was subsequently reunited. The relationship was mended, and Divine bought them lavish gifts and informed them of how wealthy he was. In fact, according to his manager Bernard Jay, he was already heavily in debt due to his extravagant spending. In 1982, he then joined forces with young American composer Bobby Orlando, who wrote a number of Hi-NRG singles for Divine, including [...] "Native Love (Step By Step)," [...] "Shoot Your Shot", and [...] "Love Reaction". To help publicize these singles, which proved to be successful in many discos across the world, Divine went on television shows like Good Morning America, as well as on a series of tours in which he combined his musical performances with comedic stunts and routines that often played up to his characters' stereotype of being [...] "trashy" [...] and outrageous. Throughout the rest of the 1980s, Divine took his musical performances on tour across the world, attaining a particularly large following in Europe.|$|E
500|$|Mylod {{additionally}} {{spoke about}} filming the final {{scenes of the}} episode, the foot chase between Arya and the Waif, in the behind the scenes featurette published by HBO after the airing of the episode. Mylod stated that he did extensive research {{in order to create}} the foot chase, saying [...] "I devoured every foot chase in the history of <b>cinema,</b> <b>but</b> trying to take from that something that would fit into the blueprint of the Game of Thrones visual style, which is not necessarily the same kind of kinetic, handheld feel that you find in many contemporary thrillers. It's a much more classic frame." [...] He continued, [...] "Everything hinged from finding this very lovely, steep stairwell and thinking 'Wouldn't it be great if she leapt off that, and then tumbled down the stairs?' I had this image in my head that I wanted lots of oranges rolling down, not quite sure where that comes from, but it looked pretty." [...] Mylod also stated in a separate interview that it was a conscious decision not to show the final fight between Arya and the Waif, given that it took place in the dark, noting [...] "when the character dies in the dark, unless we switch on night-vision goggles, we're {{not going to be able}} to see that, and we're not going to stick around to hear a scream in the dark anyway. It was actually a conscious choice in the writing and I think, for me, a very elegant storytelling beat as to get that reveal a few seconds later." ...|$|E
500|$|Rachel Saltz of The New York Times reviewed, [...] "The {{pleasure}} {{principle is}} palpable in the giddy, slick Dhoom 2, a satisfying {{example of the}} new, thoroughly modern Bollywood. It may represent the newfangled Bollywood, but old-fashioned star power is what animates and elevates it above its occasional narrative flaws and longueurs." [...] Film Journal Internationals Ethan Alter said, [...] "Dhoom 2 has all {{of the benefits of}} a big-budget Bollywood production: big-name stars, exotic locales, well-produced musical numbers and elaborate (by Bollywood standards, anyway) action sequences. It makes no lasting contributions to world <b>cinema,</b> <b>but</b> if two-and-a-half hours of disposable entertainment are all you're after, you could do far worse." [...] L.A. Weeklys David Chute stated the film was, [...] "A movie meal as satisfying as this one can make you feel that nothing else matters." [...] Jaspreet Pandohar of the BBC gave it a two-star rating, writing [...] "By roping in acclaimed action director Alan Amin {{to take care of the}} thrills and spills, you'd expect Gadhvi to have spent time crafting out a sophisticated storyline instead of simply sending his cast on a cat-and-mouse chase around the globe. It's only Roshan's charismatic performance as the criminal mastermind, and the sizzling chemistry he shares with Rai's sassy cohort, that rescues this adventure from becoming an elongated tourism commercial." [...] Manish Gajjar, Bollywood Correspondent for BBC Shropshire said, [...] "With its high-powered action sequences matching Hollywood standards, Dhoom 2 is a winner all the way at the box office!" ...|$|E

500|$|The {{effect of}} Caligari was felt {{not just in}} German <b>cinema,</b> <b>but</b> internationally as well. Both Rotha and film {{historian}} William K. Everson wrote that the film probably had {{as much of a}} long-term effect on Hollywood directors as Battleship Potemkin (1925). In his book The Film Til Now, Rotha wrote that Caligari and Potemkin were the [...] "two most momentous advances {{in the development of the}} cinema", and said Caligari [...] "served to attract to the cinema audience many people who had hitherto regarded the film as the low watermark of intelligence". [...] Caligari influenced the style and content of Hollywood films in the 1920s and early 1930s, particularly in films such as The Bells (1926), The Man Who Laughs (1928) and Murders in the Rue Morgue (1932), and had a major influence on American horror films of the 1930s, some of which featured an antagonist using Caligari-like supernatural abilities to control others, such as Dracula (1931), Svengali (1931) and The Mad Genius (1931). Kaes said both Caligaris stylistic elements, and the Cesare character in particular, influenced the Universal Studios horror films of the 1930s, which often prominently featured some sort of monster, such as Frankenstein (1931), The Mummy (1932), The Black Cat (1934), and Bride of Frankenstein (1935). The Expressionism of Caligari also influenced American avant-garde film, particularly those that used fantastic settings to illustrate an inhuman environment overpowering an individual. Early examples include The Fall of the House of Usher (1928), The Last Moment (1928) and [...] (1928). LoBrutto wrote, [...] "Few films throughout motion picture history have had more influence on the avant-garde, art, and student cinema than Caligari".|$|E
