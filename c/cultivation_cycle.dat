On a piece of sloping agricultural land villagers often practice intercropping between different local varieties such as Khao Hay (local upland rice), Mac Duoi (sorghum), Mac Nga (sesame) and Xa Ly (corn). Presently, villagers in Ban Yang also grow Mac Thua Dao (Plukenetia volubilis) as a new crop introduced from outside. These crops are rotationally planted and mixed. A specific crop variety is often never fixed in a plot of farmland but is rotated through a shifting <b>cultivation</b> <b>cycle</b> of 3-4 years or longer.|$|E
50|$|The <b>cultivation</b> <b>cycle</b> {{begins with}} the repair of {{irrigation}} and drainage canals and plowing, which is performed with a longhandled spade or hoe. Manure or fertilizer is then spread over the field. If the supply of manure or artificial fertilizer is limited, only the seedbeds are fertilized. After fertilizing, family and neighbors join in a festive trampling of the fields, using cattle if available. Occasionally, trampling {{takes the place of}} plowing altogether. If the rice is to be sown broadcast, it may be done on the same day as trampling. In the more advanced areas, the seedlings are raised in protected seedbeds and transplanted later.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{regeneration}} of Brazil nut trees {{depends on}} tree-fall {{gaps in the}} forest. However, shifting cultivation fallows also create comparable biotic and abiotic opportunities for the dispersion and establishment of this gap-loving species. At the same time, the ability of Brazil nut trees to resprout enables fallow individuals to survive successive slash-and-burn cycles. Recognizing the importance of shifting cultivation for the food security of forest dwellers, we investigated whether {{the high level of}} Brazil nut regeneration found in cultivation fallows could be explained by the resprouting capability of Brazil nut trees, the number of <b>cultivation</b> <b>cycles,</b> past agricultural use and distance to the nearest conspecific productive adults. We found that the Brazil nut tree population density increased from 8. 86 treesha− 1 to 13. 69 treesha− 1 and 27. 09 treesha− 1 at sites after one, two and three or more shifting <b>cultivation</b> <b>cycles,</b> respectively. As a consequence of resprouting, after a certain number of shifting <b>cultivation</b> <b>cycles,</b> the fallows become dominated by Brazil nut trees, and the landholders may decide to preserve them and to exclude enriched sites from future agricultural use. Protected for their extractive value, the secondary forests spontaneously enriched with Brazil nut trees are allowed to develop into nut-producing forests that have reduced chances of conversion into crops or pastures, thus reversing the classical process of Amazon forest degradation...|$|R
40|$|We {{developed}} {{a method to}} reconstruct land use history from Landsat images time-series. The method uses a breakpoint detection framework derived from the econometrics field and applicable to time-series regression models. The Breaks For Additive Season and Trend (BFAST) framework is used for defining the time-series regression models which may contain trend and phenology, hence appropriately modelling vegetation intra and inter-annual dynamics. All available Landsat data are used for a selected study area, and the time-series are partitioned into segments delimited by breakpoints. Segments can be associated to land use regimes, while the breakpoints then correspond to shifts in land use regimes. In order to further characterize these shifts, we classified the unlabelled breakpoints returned by the algorithm into their corresponding processes. We used a Random Forest classifier, trained from a set of visually interpreted time-series profiles to infer the processes and assign labels to the breakpoints. The whole approach was applied to quantifying the number of <b>cultivation</b> <b>cycles</b> in a swidden agriculture system in Brazil (state of Amazonas). Number and frequency of <b>cultivation</b> <b>cycles</b> is of particular ecological relevance in these systems since they largely affect {{the capacity of the}} forest to regenerate after land abandonment. We applied the method to a Landsat time-series of Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) spanning the 1984 – 2015 period and derived from it the number of <b>cultivation</b> <b>cycles</b> during that period at the individual field scale level. Agricultural fields boundaries used to apply the method were derived using a multi-temporal segmentation approach. We validated the number of <b>cultivation</b> <b>cycles</b> predicted by the method against in-situ information collected from farmers interviews, resulting in a Normalized Residual Mean Squared Error (NRMSE) of 0. 25. Overall the method performed well, producing maps with coherent spatial patterns. We identified various sources of error in the approach, including low data availability in the 90 s and sub-object mixture of land uses. We conclude that the method holds great promise for land use history mapping in the tropics and beyond...|$|R

50|$|Maca (Peruvian Ginseng) {{seedlings}} usually emerge {{about one}} month after sowing {{with the onset of}} the rainy season in October. In the vegetative phase, until May to June, {{the lower part of the}} hypocotyl, as well as the upper part of the tap root, grows in size. After 260 to 280 days, it is formed to the harvestable hypocotyl. If the root is left in the soil, it is dormant for two to three months in the time of the cold, dry season until August. Then it will form a generative shoot on which the seeds ripen five months later. One plant is capable of forming up to 1000 tiny seeds, 1600 of which weigh about one gram. Thus, only relatively few plants are needed for propagation. The plants for cultivation are selected for preferred size and color, then placed 50-100 mm deep in pits with alternate layers of grass and soil to protect them from drying out.

40|$|The {{application}} of inorganic amendments {{has been recognized}} as a valuable technique for increasing soil physic-chemical properties (Colombani et al., 2014). Among them, zeolites {{are known to be}} well suitable {{in a wide range of}} agricultural applications because of their high cation exchange capacity that allow a controlled retention/release of water and nutrients (e. g. NH 4 +) (Reháková et al., 2004). The main aims of this study were to verify if natural zeolites amendments can increase the uptake of N from chemical fertilizers and if the N transfer from NH 4 -enriched zeolites to plants really occurs. The elemental and isotopic composition of plants grown with no zeolite addition (UA) and plants grown on soils amended with natural (NZ) and NH 4 -enriched zeolites (CZ) (the latter obtained after mixing with pig-slurry) were compared for two <b>cultivation</b> <b>cycles.</b> It is well known that plants δ 15 N can reflect with a good approximation the δ 15 N of the main N source in the soil, thus, plants grown under conventional farming (using chemical fertilizers) and plants grown under organic farming (using animal slurry) can be often easily discriminated (Choi et al., 2003). The experimentation was carried out during 2014 (Maize) and 2015 (Wheat) <b>cultivation</b> <b>cycles</b> in the ZeoLIFE experimental field (Codigoro, Ferrara, Italy). Plants were sampled before the harvest, subdivided in stems and grains and analyzed by EA-IRMS in order to determine the δ 15 N and δ 13 C. Plants grown on NZ had significantly lower δ 15 N with respect to UA plants. Considering that the employed chemical fertilizers have a slight negative δ 15 N, it is highly possible that natural zeolites have adsorbed part of NH 4 + ions formed after chemical fertilizers hydrolysis allowing plants to uptake higher amounts of N from this specific source, resulting in a lower tissues δ 15 N. On the other hand, both maize and wheat plants grown on CZ registered a significantly higher δ 15 N, approaching that of the pig slurry employed for enriching the zeolites, confirming that this material can constitute a N pool for plants at least for two <b>cultivation</b> <b>cycles.</b> The distinct agricultural practices seem to be reflected in the plant physiology, as recorded by the carbon discrimination factor (Δ 13 C), which generally increases in plots amended with natural zeolites indicating better water/nutrient conditions...|$|R

A detailed analysis of the carotenogenesis was performed throughout the ripening process, but with special emphasis on the ripe stage, with the aim of selecting the best cultivar for paprika production. The MA 1 cultivar (with grouped ripeness and very short <b>cultivation</b> <b>cycle)</b> showed the highest carotenoid content (12697. 58 mg/kg dwt), followed by DN 5 and RN 2 cultivars with 11086. 88 and 10393. 29 mg/kg dwt, respectively. Most of the cultivars (MA 3, RN 1, LR 2, LR 7, DN 3, DR 6, Datler, and Mulato) showed a total carotenoid content in the range of 7000 - 9700 mg/kg dwt. In general, chlorophyll-retaining character was related to high carotenoid content (cultivars DN 3, DN 5, MA 3, Mulato, RN 1, and RN 2). The general trend of the <b>cultivation</b> <b>cycle</b> was that the shorter the cycle, the higher the total carotenoid content (as exemplified by the cultivar MA 1). The lowest total carotenoid content was found for the RR 1 cultivar (4856. 77 mg/kg dwt), which showed the longest <b>cultivation</b> <b>cycle.</b> Carotenogenic capacity of the cultivars has been discussed relative to total carotenoid content and the R/Y and Caps/Zeax ratios, the main quality traits for breeding cultivars for production of high-quality paprika. The cultivar MA 1, with the highest total carotenoid content, high R/Y (2. 11) ratio, and highest Caps/Zeax (9. 85) ratio, was found to be the most suitable cultivar for paprika production in terms of carotenoid pigment biosynthesis capacity.

Aim is to understand the legacy effect of former cultivation practices in order to optimize slash-and-burn cultivation. Location: Forest corridor of Fianarantsoa, southeast Madagascar. Methods: We examined three study sites to capture the ecological range in the forest corridor of Fianarantsoa. At each site, we selected formerly hand-cultivated parcels since first forest clearing so as to represent up to four classes of age of abandonment, encompassing forest fallow periods after cultivation of 0 - 5, 6 - 10, 11 - 20 and 21 - 30 yrs. These parcels served for selection of 50 plots. Interviews were conducted with each farmer to document former cultivation practices of the parcels, and from these, land-use metrics were calculated. Vegetation was surveyed in the plots and soil samples were taken and analysed for chemical and physical properties of the organo-mineral layer (horizon A). Results: We found that soil properties, such as pH, have higher values with an increasing number of <b>cultivation</b> <b>cycles</b> and duration of cultivation, and that this trend is inversely related to exchangeable P. C/N ratio is correlated to age of abandonment, and inversely related to soil N content. With increasing age of abandonment, species richness and diversity increase due mainly to an increase in ligneous species. The number of herbaceous and fern species increases with duration of cultivation and number of <b>cultivation</b> <b>cycles.</b> Conclusion: Historical land use has had a lasting effect on vegetation and even longer-term effect on soils. Different land-use variables explain soil and vegetation characteristics of the current secondary forest. The ability of soils to recover P appears unrelated to abandonment duration, suggesting that longer periods of time are required to recover P fertility, or that secondary vegetation is shifting the pool of nutrients into biomass. Our results point to the need for a management regime that would maintain both scattered trees and patches of a grass layer, since this might be key to promoting both biodiversity and soil restoration...|$|R

Nevertheless up to now there are no studies that, using the stable isotopes approach, highlighted the interaction between zeolites and plants in agricultural systems. The main aims {{of this study is to}} verify if natural zeolites amendment can enhance chemical fertilization efficiency and if N transfer from NH 4 -enriched zeolites to plants really occurs. Plants grown following traditional cultivation methods (with no zeolite addition) and plants grown on soils amended with natural and NH 4 -enriched zeolites (the latter obtained after mixing with pig-slurry with a very high [U+F 064] 15 N) were compared for two <b>cultivation</b> <b>cycles</b> (maize and wheat). As widely known, plants grown under conventional farming systems (use of chemical fertilizers as urea) and plants grown under organic farming can be discriminated by the isotopic signatures of plant tissues. For both years the main results of the study reveals that plants grown on plots amended with natural zeolites generally have their nitrogen isotopic signature more similar to that of the chemical fertilizers employed during the cultivation with respect to the plants cultivated in the non-amended plot. This suggests an enhanced N uptake by the plant from this specific N source with respect to the non-amended plot. On the other hand, plants grown on NH 4 -enriched zeolites registered a higher [U+F 064] 15 N, approaching the pig-slurry isotopic signature, confirming that this material can constitute an N pool for plants at least for two <b>cultivation</b> <b>cycles.</b> The distinct agricultural practices seem to be reflected in the plant physiology as recorded by the carbon discrimination factor ([U+F 044] 13 C) which generally increases in plots amended with natural zeolites indicating better water/nutrient conditions.

A goal of optimization is to maximize the yield of cells ’ biomass {{at the end of}} <b>cultivation</b> <b>cycle.</b> Two alternative optimization methods, based on the maximum principle of Pontryagin and the finite dimensional optimization approach, are developed for the problem solving. Numerical example illustrating application of the optimization algorithms is presented and discussed. 1...|$|E

The investigations performed show together with the literature data that there is a possibility of obtaining very high yields from a very small surface area if the cultivation cycles are appropriately schemed, and the technical installations and suitable light combinations are applied...|$|E

40|$|A {{conceptual}} {{model of the}} spatio-temporal dynamics of Shifting Agricultural Systems (SAS) in the rainforest region of Southern Cameroon {{made it possible to}} identify five different <b>cultivation</b> <b>cycles,</b> which enabled the quantification of soil dynamics and carbon stocks. Carbon stocks in each pool were evaluated using all chronosequences for land use types, including Virgin forest (PF), Secondary forest (SF), Forest fallow (FF), Chromolaena fallow (CF), Mixed crop field (MC) and Old cocoa plantations (OCP). Under each treatment, biomass measures were conducted on trees, undergrowth, litter and plant roots. Soil samples were analysed for physicochemical determinations. The total carbon (in TC/ha- 1) varies in the following decreasing order: VF (305), SF (251), OCP (184), FF (180), CF (101), and MC (67). Although the average soil carbon stock represents 93 % and 78 % under the MC and CF systems, respectively, it represents only 26 % of total carbon for the VF system. When a PF system is converted into MC, there is a total carbon loss of 97 % from aerial biomass and 17 % from soil. Fallowing and reconversion to SF lead to a carbon re-accumulation of 3. 9 TC/ha- 1. year- 1 (r 2 = 0. 83, p= 0. 001). Several soil parameters have shown major variability within the system. This study has produced quantified data, which can be used to evaluate soil quality according to land use and the cost of the carbon sequestered by these agricultural systems...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{sustainability}} of traditional farming systems {{in many parts}} of Africa is threatened by losses in the variety of species, reduction in land, forest, soil and water resources under demographic pressure. Together with foreign influences these farming system are no longer in equilibrium with local culture and ecology and are therefore disintegrating {{due to the lack of}} local capacity to adjust to these changes. This has led to environmental degradation. The paper employs a combination of qualitative and quantitative techniques to: analyse the farming systems, assess the effect of cropping intensification on the climatic climax vegetation, and to establish the post-cultivation vegetation successions in fallows. It reports four crop fallow rotations: crop 3 years with 1 year bush fallow, crop 5 years with 1 - 2 year bush fallow, crop 10 years with 1 - 3 year bush fallow and continuous cropping. The post-cultivation successions present a plagioclimax dominated by Hyparhenia species with scattered shrubs maintained by <b>cycles</b> of <b>cultivation</b> and burning. The paper concludes that these shifting <b>cultivation</b> <b>cycles</b> involving cropping intensification and post cultivation savannization have deprived the farming system of its ecological benefits, that is, nutrient recycling through a long and mature fallow. The inability of the vegetation to reconstitute itself requires the development of farming systems that combine trees and crops in the field because of proven micro-ecological and ecological benefits. The paper therefore identifies the scope for the development of ecologically sustainable agro-ecosystems as a development path for shifting cultivation systems...|$|R
