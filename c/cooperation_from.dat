5|$|After Arghun's death, he was {{followed}} {{in rapid succession}} by two brief and fairly ineffective leaders, one of whom only held power for a few months. Stability was restored when Arghun's son Ghazan took power in 1295, though to secure <b>cooperation</b> <b>from</b> other influential Mongols, he made a public conversion to Islam {{when he took the}} throne, marking a major turning point in the state religion of the Ilkhanate. Despite being an official Muslim, however, Ghazan remained tolerant of multiple religions, and worked to maintain good relations with his Christian vassal states such as Cilician Armenia and Georgia.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, the Icelandic airline Loftleidir {{was granted}} the {{concession}} to fly from Keflavík Airport outside Reykjavík to New York and Chicago in the United States, and to Oslo, Copenhagen and London. The company established a hub at Keflavík. Braathens SAFE and Loftleidir {{made an agreement}} where Braathens SAFE would lease personnel and mechanical services to Loftleidir, and the two would split profits from the joint venture evenly. This allowed the two airlines to have a continual route between Hong Kong and New York as long as Braathens SAFE's concession lasted. In 1954, another DC-4, LN-HHK, was bought. This aircraft was sold to Loftleidir the following year. In 1956, another DC-4, LN-SUP, was bought, and used for charter and by Loftleidir. In 1959 and 1960, Loftleidir received two new Douglas DC-6B aircraft, with a five-year mechanical agreement with Braathens SAFE. In 1960, the two companies agreed to terminate the <b>cooperation</b> <b>from</b> 1 January 1961.|$|E
5|$|The Kehl {{garrison}} {{consisted of}} one battalion of the 24th Demi-brigade and some detachments of the 104th under command of Balthazar Alexis Henri Schauenburg. This {{was too weak}} a force to defend a position of such importance, or to develop additional extensive works. Moreau reported that some of Scherb's troops had arrived, but it is unclear which ones. Furthermore, the lack of <b>cooperation</b> <b>from</b> local peasant workers and the exhaustion of troops prevented the enhancements of the fortifications from proceeding with any speed. On the evening of 16 September, Petrasch {{and most of his}} column had arrived at Bischofsheim, immediately by Kehl, with three battalions and two squadrons; more troops were not far behind. By 17 September, a small corps of Austrians approached the outskirts of Kehl and vigorously attacked the French sentries there; this was merely a prelude to the more significant action the following day.|$|E

5|$|Development of the PlayStation Vita port began {{shortly before}} the start of the game's service in 2014. The team formed a {{partnership}} with Sony to develop the title, but production ran into difficulties as the team attempted to create an experience of the same quality as the mobile version, along with adjusting the controls from touch-based to the button and joystick controls of the Vita. There was also some resistance from staff surrounding the usage of the Mana franchise and Oyamada's determination to bring Rise of Mana to consoles in the face of suggestions that it would be better to make a completely new game. When the project was proposed to Sony, the Unity technology built into the Vita was fairly new and did not make full use of the platform's processing power. In addition, the staff were unused to the version of Unity for the Vita. The team needed <b>cooperation</b> <b>from</b> both Sony and Unity Technologies to optimize the engine so the game could run on the new platform. By the time of the Vita version's announcement, only the preliminary development work had been completed, but development was proceeding according to plan. Technical troubles related to the game's performance persisted beyond this point, resulting in the release being delayed into the following year.|$|E
