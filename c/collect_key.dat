2500|$|Starting in December 2006, the Michigan Shipwreck Research Association (MSRA) has {{expressed}} a public desire that the Andaste be found. [...] In response to its appeal, the MSRA {{has been able}} to <b>collect</b> <b>key</b> artifacts of the lost vessel, salvaged by rescue workers and beachcombers immediately after the tragedy. [...] An original name board, bearing the name [...] "Andaste", turned up in 2010. [...] The MSRA has also continued the search for the hull of the Andaste, which lies somewhere in the bed of Lake Michigan. [...] MSRA board director Valerie van Heest told a reporter in 2016 that the 1929 inquest, particularly the testimony of the Alabama senior officers, contains valuable clues that may help the organization succeed in uncovering the missing ship's hull. [...] Yet [...] "as with all missing ships," [...] the Association's webpage concludes, [...] "the Andaste may never be found." ...|$|E

40|$|Problem {{determination}} {{remains one}} of the most expensive and time-consuming functions in system management due to the difficulty in automating what is essentially a highly experience-dependent task. In this paper we study the characteristics of problem tickets in an enterprise IT infrastructure and observe that most of the tickets come from very few products and modules, and OS problems present higher resolving duration. We propose PDA, a problem management tool that provides automated problem diagnosis capabilities to assist system administrators in solving realworld problems more efficiently. PDA uses a two-level approach of proactive, high-level system health checks, coupled with rule-based ‘‘drill-down’ ’ probing to automatically collect detailed information related to the problem. Our tool allows system administrators to author and customize probes and rules accordingly and share across the organization. We illustrate the usage and benefits of PDA with a number of UNIX problem scenarios that show PDA is able to quickly <b>collect</b> <b>key</b> information through its rules to aid in problem determination...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Trace-driven {{simulation}} is {{a widely}} practiced simulation method. However, its use has been typically limited to modeling of in-order processors because of accuracy issues. In this work, we propose and explore In-N-Out, a fast approximate simulation method to reproduce the behavior of an out-oforder superscalar processor with a reduced in-order trace. During trace generation, we use a functional cache simulator to capture interesting processor events such as uncore accesses in the program order. We also <b>collect</b> <b>key</b> information about the executed program. The prepared in-order trace then drives a novel simulation algorithm that models an out-of-order processor. Our experimental results demonstrate that In-N-Out produces reasonably accurate absolute performance (7 % difference on average) and fast simulation speeds (115 × on average), compared with detailed execution-driven simulation. Moreover, In-N-Out was shown to preserve a processor’s dynamic uncore access patterns and predict the relative performance change when the processor’s core- or uncore-level parameters are changed. Keywords—Superscalar out-of-order processor, performance modeling, trace-driven simulation. I...|$|E
40|$|Rey Chow {{is arguably}} {{one of the}} most {{prominent}} intellectuals working in the humanities today. Characteristically confronting both entrenched and emergent issues in the interlocking fields of literature, film and visual studies, sexuality and gender, postcolonialism, ethnicity, and cross-cultural politics, her works produce surprising connections among divergent topics at the same time as they compel us to think through the ethical and political ramifications of our academic, epistemic, and cultural practices. This anthology - the first to <b>collect</b> <b>key</b> moments in Chow's engaging thought - provides readers with an ideal introduction to some of her most forceful theoretical explorations. Organized into two sections, each of which begins with a brief statement designed to establish linkages among various discursive fields through Chow's writings, the anthology also contains an extensive Editor's Introduction, which situates Chow's work in the context of contemporary critical debates. For all those pursuing transnational cultural theory and cultural studies, this book is an essential resource...|$|E
