25|$|Distinguishing turbidites, contourites, and bottom-current {{modified}} turbidite deposits {{is essential}} for reconstructing the paleoenvironment in deepwater settings. Traction structures, such as <b>cross-stratification,</b> indicate bottom-current reworking {{because it is more}} likely to have avalanching in clear bottom-currents than it is in sediment saturated turbidity flows. Deposition from suspension in turbidity flows do not generate a sharp upper contact as bottom-current reworked deposits show due to the highly oscillating energy conditions. Stanley (1993) proposes that the transition from a turbidite to a contourite involves a continuous transition from a sandy deposit to lenticular bedding passing through wavy bedding.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to carry out a stratigraphic {{revision}} of the Missão Velha Formation (Araripe Basin, northeastern Brazil) based on detailed facies analysis, architectural elements, depositional systems and palaeofl ow data. The main facies are: 1. coarsegrained conglomeratic sandstones and locally pebbly conglomerates, with abundant silicified fossil trunks, several large-to mediumscale trough cross-stratifi cations and predominantly lenticular geometry; 2. medium-to coarse-grained lenticular sandstones with granules, abundant silicified fossil wood and trunks, and large-to medium-scale trough <b>cross-stratifications,</b> cut-and-fill features and mud drapes on the foreset cross-strata; 3. conglomerates and poorly sorted medium-grained sandstones with sparse pebblesand horizontal stratifi cation; 4. fi ne-to very fine-laminated silty sandstone interlayered with 5. decimetric pelitic layers with parallel stratification and climbing-ripple cross-lamination. Ten architectural elements were identifi ed: CH: Channels, GB: Gravel barsand bedforms, SG: sediment gravity fl ows, SB: Sand bars and bedforms, SB(p) : sand bedform with planar cross-stratifi cation,OFch: Overbank fl ow of channel (levee, crevasse and channel splay), DA: Downstream-accretion macroforms, LS: Laminated sandsheet,LA: Lateral-accretion macroforms and FF: Floodplain fines. Not all of these features were observed at each outcrop. Theseelements, which are defi ned by their geometry and bounding surfaces, form the basis for interpreting depositional environments.

40|$|The Araripe Basin {{has been}} the subject of several {{publications}} in the recent years, notably with respect to the rich paleontological collection of Brejo Santo, Crato and Romualdo Formations. However, papers detailing stratigraphic aspects of Brejo Santo Formation are scarce. The formation (Mesozoic era - Dom João Stage) is represented by a predominantly pelithic succession (up to 450 m thick) outcropping in eastern portion of the basin. The Brejo Santo Formation unconformably overlies the Cariri Formation, presumably of Paleozoic age, and makes gradational contact with the overlying Missão Velha Formation. It consists of pelithes, such as massive to laminated reddish-brown chalks and calciferous shales with decimetric intercalations of white to greenish-grey siltstones and centimetric layers of reddish mottled, speckled and striped shales, with calcareous nodules, and subordinately, muddy limestones and highly fossiliferous calciferous sandstones and fine sandstones with planar <b>cross-stratifications.</b> The measured paleocurrents have a consistent dispersion pattern for SE, SW and S, suggesting the installation of an open wide basin toward the south. The facies and facies associations described were interpreted as generated by (i) lake systems in which periodically the level of the lakes and/or ponds suffered sudden variations, causing changes in coloration related to seasonal fluctuations in the level of the lake (periods of subaerial exposure) and (ii) ephemeral river systems which fed these lakes. The widespread occurrence of fossil organisms, such as non-marine ostracods and conchostracheans suggest that the sediments of Brejo Santo Formation were possibly deposited in lacustrine-fluviatile systems favorable to the formation of redbeds layers, under hot climatic conditions with well-defined dry seasons, corroborating the depositional system interpretation...|$|R
40|$|The seaward end {{of modern}} rivers is {{characterized}} by the interactions of marine and fluvial processes, a tract known as the fluvial to marine transition zone (FMTZ), which varies between systems due to the relative strength of these processes. To understand how fluvial and tidal process interactions and the FMTZ are preserved in the rock record, large-scale outcrops of deltaic deposits of the Middle Jurassic Lajas Formation (Neuquén Basin, Argentina) have been investigated. Fluvial-tidal indicators consist of cyclically distributed carbonaceous drapes in unidirectional, seaward-oriented <b>cross-stratifications,</b> which are interpreted as the result of tidal modulation of the fluvial current in the inner part of the FMTZ. Heterolithic deposits with dm-scale interbedding of coarser- and finer-grained facies with mixed fluvial and tidal affinities are interpreted to indicate fluvial discharge fluctuations (seasonality) and subordinate tidal influence. Many other potential tidal indicators are argued {{to be the result of}} fluvial-tidal interactions with overall fluvial dominance, or of purely fluvial processes. No purely tidal or tide-dominated facies were recognized in the studied deposits. Moreover, fluvial-tidal features are found mainly in deposits interpreted as interflood (forming during low river stage) in distal (delta front) or off-axis (interdistributary) parts of the system. Along major channel axes, the interpreted FMTZ is mainly represented by the fluvial-dominated section, whereas little or no tide-dominated section is identified. The system is interpreted to have been hyposynchronous with a poorly developed turbidity maximum. These conditions and the architectural elements described, including major and minor distributary channels, terminal distributary channels, mouth bars and crevasse mouth bars, are consistent with an interpretation of a fluvial-dominated, tide-influenced delta system and with an estimated short backwater length and inferred microtidal conditions. The improved identification of process interactions, and their preservation in ancient FMTZs, is fundamental to refining interpretations of ancient deltaic successions...|$|R

For this study, samples taken {{from the base of}} the Ipeúna Member, Bairrinho Bed, State of São Paulo, were analyzed and complemented by fossils from the Irati Formation, State of Rio Grande do Sul. The taphonomic spectrum of the pygocephalomorphs includes three main preservational modes: Type 1. Complete pygocephalomorphs (with outstretched or flexed abdomen), which are associated to cream-colored mudstones and more commonly to black shales. In rare cases, molds of soft parts are preserved. They suffered rapid burial (hours to days) by mud blankets associated to storm events in anoxic bottoms, below storm wave base with minimum bottom disruption, followed by low rates of background sedimentation; Type 2. Partly articulated (carapace and abdomen, with or without caudal fan and without appendages) pygocephalomorphs, with extended or flexed abdomen, which are present in cream-colored pelites, associated with hummocky <b>cross-stratifications,</b> intercalated with black shales. These may represent individuals or remains lying in the sediment-water interface preserved by rapid burial associated to episodic sedimentation events; Type 3. Disarticulated pygocephalomorphs, with isolated carapaces, abdomen, or abdominal segments. This is the predominant preservational mode in our samples. The skeletal remains can be found isolated or in dense, bioclast-supported concentrations (micro-coquines), representing proximal to distal tempestites. Finally, the extreme preservational quality seen in crustaceans of the Type 1 recorded in black shales, occasionally with molds of soft parts, indicates that the host rocks may represent Konservat-Lagerstätten deposits, as already suggested to coeval occurrences of the Irati Formation in Uruguay. © 2013 by the Sociedade Brasileira de Paleontologia...|$|R
40|$|The Himmelbaach quarry {{is located}} in the Wiltz Synclinorium in Luxembourg. The rocks {{outcropping}} in this quarry correspond to the mid-Emsian Clervaux Shales Formation. Three different facies have been identified in the quarry. An argillaceous sandstone facies with oblique stratifications, <b>cross-stratifications,</b> herring-bones and erosive bases represent the first facies; the second facies is characterized by lenticular- (with connected lenses) to wavy-bedded sandy argillites, argillaceous sandstones and quartz arenites. The last facies corresponds to a quartz arenite with oblique stratification, planar laminations and mud drapes. The base of this facies shows flaser bedding and sigmoidally curved bed surfaces. The palaeoenvironmental study of this area is rather difficult because of the structural deformation and lateral variation of the facies. Due to this deformation, six partial sections (4 a to 4 f) were sampled here. In order to reconstruct a reliable vertical and lateral succession of the depositional setting, facies analysis and magnetic susceptibility were used. Magnetic susceptibility (MS) is generally applied as a tool for correlation in a deepwater carbonated environment. In this paper we used the MS technique successfully in a siliciclastic proximal setting. Analysis of MS curves as well as the recognition of three marker beds ((1) the last bed of argillaceous sandstones in Facies 1; (2) a thin horizon of carbonated sandstone within Facies 2; (3) the first appearance of the characteristics massive quartzitic beds in Facies 3) allowed the correlation of sections 4 a, 4 b and 4 c. These correlations helped us to reconstruct a vertical and lateral succession of facies, which ultimately led to the recognition of a tide-dominated marginal-marine depositional model composed respectively of tidal channels (Facies 1), a tidal flat (Facies 2) and a tidal sand ridge (Facies 3). This example also shows the usefulness of magnetic susceptibility for small scale correlation, even in a proximal environment such as a marginal-marine setting. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Fossil {{lacustrine}} sediments {{were found}} at about 15 m above sea level, directly above beach deposits dating from Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 11 on a tectonically stable coastline in Eleuthera (Bahamas). This new discovery brings further support to the hypothesis suggesting that a major collapse of polar ice sheets occurred during this interglacial period. Two stratigraphic sections (GW 1 /GW 2), including several carbonate units separated by paleosols, were logged near Glass Window (northern Eleuthera). Both sections comprise a basal unit made of cross-bedded, bio-peloidal limestone, including an early generation of fibrous rim cement of marine origin and a late phase of drusy calcite mosaic. A second unit displays well-defined planar bedding at both sites, whereas faint trough <b>cross-stratifications</b> are also visible at GW 1. It consists of a bio-peloidal grainstone containing Halimeda fragments and lithoclasts derived from the underlying unit, and is further characterized by an early generation of isopachous fibrous cement. The upper part of this second unit shows one thick laminated crust with desiccation polygons and numerous spherulites of cyanobacterial origin, and is capped by a paleosol. The top of the GW 2 section is represented by a karstified oolitic/peloidal grainstone, not found at GW 1, whereas {{the upper part of}} GW 1 includes one bioclastic and one oolitic limestone unit separated by a paleosol. Based on sedimentary structures, petrographic composition, and amino-acid ratios borrowed from previous authors, the basal and upper units exposed at both sections can be identified as eolianites dating from MIS 11, 9, 7 and 5 e, respectively. Occurring between + 12 and + 14. 5 m, the basal part of the second unit can be interpreted as beach deposit, whereas its upper part, at + 15 m, likely corresponds to lacustrine or pond sediments, both dating from MIS 11. Considering the subsidence rate affecting Eleuthera, these beach and pond deposits, and the phreatic cements in the basal eolian units unavoidably imply a sea-level highstand at ca. 20 m during MIS 11. This exceptional event was probably caused by the collapse and melting of polar ice-sheets during this very warm climatic period. In the context of present-day global warming, a similar scenario could be repeated in the near future...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe Dur At Talah {{escarpment}} (150 m {{thick and}} 150 km long) is exposed {{at the southern}} side of the Sirt Basin, central Libya. This outcrop exposes an Upper Eocene succession, composed by highly bioturbated fine grained sandstones to claystones at the base (New Idam Unit; 80 - 100 m thick), overlain by medium grained to microconglomeratic sandstones at the top (Sarir Unit; 60 m thick). The latter is split into two subunits of nearly equal thickness: the lower Sarir subunit, composed of medium to coarse cross-bedded sandstones; and the upper Sarir subunit, composed of very coarse to microconglomeratic sandstones. The whole succession evolves from shallow marine estuarine (the New Idam Unit) to fluvial deposits (the upper Sarir subunit). The sandstone of the lower Sarir subunit, which {{is the focus of}} this article, is previously misinterpreted as being deposited in a purely fluvial environment. However, close observations revealed that the depositional environment is largely tide-influenced. It is notably marked by conspicuous subaqueous dune <b>cross-stratifications</b> that bear a variety of discrete, multi-scale, sedimentary structures evidencing their deposition in tidal rather than fluvial setting. Mud drapes, tidal bundles, and perpendicularly draining and oppositely climbing ripples are largely developed. Among these structures, the most diagnostic are of millimetric to centimetric scale. As a prime aim of this article, all these sedimentary structures are described, interpreted, and discussed for the first time from this outcrop. Their style of association and the quality of their preservation provide an outstanding ancient example of tide-dominated siliciclastic systems. Such structures are rarely found together in one outcrop as they are in Dur At Talah, and they provide a significant indicators in identifying ancient bedforms of tidal origin. Evidences of subtidal and intertidal depositional environments are afforded by these structures. Criteria indicative of semidiurnal regime of the tide are also presented. These criteria are especially well-preserved in the bundled foresets of the spring tides, the neap tide record is also distinguishable but it provides no discernible structures. Moreover, sedimentary features {{that can be used to}} infer a macrotidal range during the depositional time are also afforded by a combination of these structures. Above all, this study also concludes that one of the most reliable sedimentary structures for recognizing the tidal bedforms are the ripple-scale (centimetric) sedimentary structures.
