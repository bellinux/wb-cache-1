And since the definition of Man according to the ordinary connotation of the word, though it would have answered every other purpose of a definition, would not have pointed out the place which the species ought to occupy in that particular classification; he gave the word a special connotation, that he might be able to define it by the kind of attributes on which, for reasons of scientific convenience, he had resolved to found his division of animated nature.|$|E

The Catholic Counter-Reformation's worldview {{played an important role in}} the artist's practice. Central in this worldview was the belief that the earth and its inhabitants were revelations of a god. Artistic representation of, and scientific investigation into, that divine revelation was encouraged and valued. Breughel's friend and patron, the Counter-Reformation Cardinal Federico Borromeo, particularly emphasized the beauty and diversity of the animal world. In his I tre libri delle laudi divine (published only posthumously in 1632) Borromeo wrote: 'Looking then with attentive study at animals' construction and formation, and at their parts, members, and characters, <b>can</b> it <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> how excellently divine wisdom has demonstrated the value of its great works?'

60|$|Thus, man {{is capable}} of being truly affirmed of John, George, Mary, and other persons without {{assignable}} limit; and it is affirmed {{of all of them}} in the same sense; for the word man expresses certain qualities, and when we predicate it of those persons, we assert that they all possess those qualities. But John is only capable of being truly affirmed of one single person, at least in the same sense. For, though there are many persons who bear that name, it is not conferred upon them to indicate any qualities, or any thing which belongs to them in common; and <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> to be affirmed of them in any sense at all, consequently not in the same sense. “The king who succeeded William the Conqueror,” is also an individual name.

Even “the king,” when the occasion or the context defines the individual of whom it is to be understood, may justly be regarded as an individual name.|$|E
6000|$|A remark of {{a similar}} nature may be applied to most of those distinctions among propositions which {{are said to have}} {{reference}} to their modality; as, difference of tense or time; the sun did rise, the sun is rising, the sun will rise. These differences, like that between affirmation and negation, might be glossed over by considering the incident of time as a mere modification of the predicate: thus, The sun is an object having risen, The sun is an object now rising, The sun is an object to rise hereafter. But the simplification would be merely verbal. Past, present, and future, do not constitute so many different kinds of rising; they are designations belonging to the event asserted, to the sun’s rising to-day. They affect, not the predicate, but the applicability of the predicate to the particular subject. That which we affirm to be past, present, or future, is not what the subject signifies, nor what the predicate signifies, but specifically and expressly what the predication signifies; what is expressed only by the proposition as such, and not by either or both of the terms. Therefore the circumstance of time is properly considered as attaching to the copula, which is the sign of predication, and not to the predicate. If the same <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> of such modifications as these, Cæsar may be dead; Cæsar is perhaps dead; it is possible that Cæsar is dead; it is only because these fall altogether under another head, being properly assertions not of any thing relating to the fact itself, but of the state of our own mind in regard to it; namely, our absence of disbelief of it. Thus “Cæsar may be dead” means “I am not sure that Cæsar is alive.” ...|$|E

"The {{proposition}} that the electors, when they compose {{the whole of the}} community, can not have an interest in voting against the interest of the community, will be found, on examination, to have more sound than meaning in it. Though the community, as a whole, can have (as the terms imply) no other interest than its collective interest, any or every individual in it may. A man's interest consists of whatever he takes an interest in. Every body has as many different interests as he has feelings; likings or dislikings, either of a selfish or of a better kind. It <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> that any of these, taken by itself, constitutes 'his interest:' he is a good man or a bad according as he prefers one class of his interests or another. A man who is a tyrant at home will be apt to sympathize with tyranny (when not exercised over himself); he will be almost certain not to sympathize with resistance to tyranny. An envious man will vote against Aristides because he is called the Just. A selfish man will prefer even a trifling individual benefit to his share of the advantage which his country would derive from a good law, because interests peculiar to himself are those which the habits of his mind both dispose him to dwell on and make him best able to estimate. A great number of the electors will have two sets of preferences--those on private and those on public grounds. The last are the only ones which the elector would like to avow. The best side of their character is that which people are anxious to show, even to those who are no better than themselves. People will give dishonest or mean votes from lucre, from malice, from pique, from personal rivalry, even from the interests or prejudices of class or sect, more readily in secret than in public. And cases exist--they may come to be more frequent--in which almost the only restraint upon a majority of knaves consists in their involuntary respect for the opinion of an honest minority. In such a case as that of the repudiating states of North America, is there not some check to the unprincipled voter in the shame of looking an honest man in the face? Since all this good would be sacrificed by the ballot, even in the circumstances most favorable to it, a much stronger case is requisite than can now be made out for its necessity (and the case is continually becoming still weaker) to make its adoption desirable."

60|$|It now {{remains to}} {{complete}} this sketch {{of the growth of}} political economy by a brief account of the writers on the Continent and in the United States, beginning with France. About the time of the founding of the London “Economist” (1844) and “The Statistical Journal” (1839) in England, there was established in Paris the “Journal des Économistes” (1842), which contains many valuable papers. On the whole, the most popular writer since J. B. Say has been Bastiat,(56) who aspired to be the French Cobden. He especially urged a new(57) view of value, which he defined as the relation established by an exchange of services; that nature’s products are gratuitous, so that man can not exact anything except for a given service. Chiefly as a foe of protection, which he regarded as qualified socialism, he has won a reputation for popular and clever writing; and he was led to believe in a general harmony of interests between industrial classes; but in general he <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> to have much influenced the course of French thought. On value, rent, and population, he is undoubtedly unsound. A writer of far greater depth than Bastiat, with uncommon industry and wide knowledge, was Michel Chevalier,(58) easily the first among modern French economists. He has led in the discussion upon the fall of gold, protection, banking, and particularly upon money; an ardent free-trader, he had influence enough to induce France to enter into the commercial treaty of 1860 with England. One of the ablest writers on special topics is Levasseur,(59) who has given us a history of the working-classes before and since the Revolution, and the best existing monograph on John Law. The most industrious and reliable of the recent writers is the well-known statistician, Maurice Block,(60) while less profound economists were J. A. Blanqui(61) and Wolowski.(62) The latter devoted himself enthusiastically to banks of issue, and bimetallism. A small group gave themselves up chiefly to studies on agriculture and land-tenures—H. Passy,(63) Laveleye, and Lavergne.(64) The latter {{is by far the most}} important, as shown by his “L’économie rurale de la France depuis 1789” (1857), which gives a means of comparing recent French agriculture with that before the Revolution, as described in Arthur Young’s “Travels in France” (1789). The best systematic treatise in French is the “Précis de la science économique” (1862), by Antoine-Élise Cherbuliez,(65) a Genevan. The French were the first to produce an alphabetical encyclopædia of economics, by Coquelin and Guillaumin, entitled the “Dictionnaire de l’économie politique” (1851-1853, third edition, 1864). Courcelle-Seneuil,(66) by his “Traité théorique et pratique d’économie politique” (second edition, 1867); and Baudrillart, by a good compendium. Joseph Garnier, Dunoyer,(67) Paul Leroy-Beaulieu,(68) Reybaud,(69) De Parieu,(70) Léon Say,(71) Boiteau, and others, have done excellent work in France, and Walras(72) in Switzerland.|$|E
60|$|Since, {{however, the}} value of money really conforms, like that of other things, though more slowly, to its cost of production, some {{political}} economists have objected altogether to the statement that {{the value of}} money depends on its quantity combined with the rapidity of circulation, which, they think, is assuming a law for money that does not exist for any other commodity, when the truth is that it is governed by the very same laws. To this we may answer, in the first place, that the statement in question assumes no peculiar law. It is simply the law of demand and supply, which is acknowledged to be applicable to all commodities, and which, in the case of money, as of most other things, is controlled, but not set aside, by the law of cost of production, since cost of production would have no effect on value if it could have none on supply. But, secondly, there really is, in one respect, a closer connection between the value of money and its quantity than between the values of other things and their quantity. The value of other things conforms to the changes in the cost of production, without requiring, as a condition, that there should be any actual alteration of the supply: the potential alteration is sufficient; and, if there even be an actual alteration, it is but a temporary one, except in so far as the altered value may {{make a difference in the}} demand, and so require an increase or diminution of supply, as a consequence, not a cause, of the alteration in value. Now, this is also true of gold and silver, considered as articles of expenditure for ornament and luxury; but it is not true of money. If the permanent cost of production of gold were reduced one fourth, it might happen that there would not be more of it bought for plate, gilding, or jewelry, than before; and if so, though the value would fall, the quantity extracted from the mines for these purposes would be no greater than previously. Not so with the portion used as money: that portion could not fall in value one fourth unless actually increased one fourth; for, at prices one fourth higher, one fourth more money would be required to make the accustomed purchases; and, if this were not forthcoming, some of the commodities would be without purchasers, and prices could not be kept up. Alterations, therefore, in the cost of production of the precious metals do not act upon the value of money except just in proportion as they increase or diminish its quantity; which <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> of any other commodity. It would, therefore, I conceive, be an error, both scientifically and practically, to discard the proposition which asserts a connection between the value of money and its quantity.|$|E
6000|$|The case {{in which}} {{election}} by two stages answers well in practice is when the electors are not chosen solely as electors, but have other important functions to discharge, which precludes their being selected solely as delegates to give a particular vote. This combination of circumstances exemplifies itself in another American institution, the Senate of the United States. That assembly, the Upper House, as it were, of Congress, is considered to represent not the people directly, but the States as such, and to be the guardian of that portion of their sovereign rights which they have not alienated. As the internal sovereignty of each state is, {{by the nature of}} an equal federation, equally sacred whatever be the size or importance of the state, each returns to the Senate the same number of members (two), whether it be little Delaware or the [...] "Empire State" [...] of New York. These members are not chosen by the population, but by the State Legislatures, themselves elected by the people of each state; but as the whole ordinary business of a legislative assembly, internal legislation and the control of the executive, devolves upon these bodies, they are elected with a view to those objects more than to the other; and in naming two persons to represent the state in the federal Senate they for the most part exercise their own judgment, with only that general reference to public opinion necessary in all acts of the government of a democracy. The elections thus made have proved eminently successful, and are conspicuously the best of all the elections in the United States, the Senate invariably consisting of the most distinguished men among those who have made themselves sufficiently known in public life. After such an example, it <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> that indirect popular election is never advantageous. Under certain conditions it is the very best system that can be adopted. But those conditions are hardly to be obtained in practice except in a federal government like that of the United States, where the election can be intrusted to local bodies whose other functions extend to the most important concerns of the nation. The only bodies in any analogous position which exist, or are likely to exist, in this country, are the municipalities, or any other boards which have been or may be created for similar local purposes. Few persons, however, would think it any improvement in our Parliamentary constitution if the members for the City of London were chosen by the aldermen and Common Council, and those for the borough of Marylebone avowedly, as they already are virtually, by the vestries of the component parishes. Even if those bodies, considered merely as local boards, were far less objectionable than they are, the qualities that would fit them for the limited and peculiar duties of municipal or parochial ædileship are no guaranty of any special fitness to judge of the comparative qualifications of candidates for a seat in Parliament. They probably would not fulfill this duty any better than it is fulfilled by the inhabitants voting directly; while, on the other hand, if fitness for electing members of Parliament had to be taken into consideration in selecting persons for the office of vestrymen or town councillors, many of those who are fittest for that more limited duty would inevitably be excluded from it, if only by the necessity there would be of choosing persons whose sentiments in general politics agreed with those of the voters who elected them. The mere indirect political influence of town-councils has already led to a considerable perversion of municipal elections from their intended purpose, by making them a matter of party politics. If it were part of the duty of a man's book-keeper or steward to choose his physician, he would not be likely to have a better medical attendant than if he chose one for himself, while he would be restricted in his choice of a steward or book-keeper to such as might, without too great danger to his health, be intrusted with the other office.|$|E

While the [...] so-called wages-fund limits the total amount which the laborers [...] can receive, the employer would try to get his workmen at as [...] much less than that amount as possible, so that the aggregate fund [...] would have no bearing on the actual amount paid in wages. The [...] quantity of work to be done, he asserts, determines the quantity [...] of labor to be employed. About the same time (but unknown to Mr. [...] Longe), W. T. Thornton was studying the same subject, and [...] attracted considerable attention by his publication, “On Labor” [...] (1868), which in Book II, Chap. I, contained an extended argument [...] to show that demand and supply (i.e., the proportion between [...] wages-fund and laborers) did not regulate wages, and denied the [...] existence of a predetermined wages-fund fixed in amount. His [...] attack, however, assumes a very different conception of an [...] economic law from that which we think right to insist upon. The [...] character of mankind being what it is, it will be for their [...] interest to invest so much and no more in labor, and we must [...] believe that in this sense there is a predetermination of wealth [...] to be paid in wages. In order to make good investments, a certain [...] amount must, if capitalists follow their best interests, go to the [...] payment of labor.(162) Mr. Thornton’s argument attracted the more [...] attention because Mr. Mill(163) admitted that Mr. Thornton had [...] induced him to abandon his Wages-Fund Theory. The subject was, [...] however, taken up, re-examined by Mr. Cairnes,(164) and stated in [...] a truer form. (1.) The total wealth of a country (circle A in the [...] diagram) is the outside limit of its capital. How much capital [...] will be saved out of this depends upon the effective desire of [...] accumulation in the community (as set forth in Book I, Chap. [...] VIII). The size of circle B within circle A, therefore, depends on [...] the character of the people. The wages-fund, then, depends [...] ultimately on the extent of A, and proximately on the extent of B. [...] It can never be larger than B. So far, at least, its amount is [...] “predetermined” in the economic sense by general laws regarding [...] the accumulation of capital and the expectation of profit. Circle [...] B contracts and expands under influences which have nothing to do [...] with the immediate bargains between capitalists and laborers. (2.) [...] Another influence now comes in to affect the amount of capital [...] actually paid as wages, one also governed by general causes [...] outside the reach of laborer or capitalist, that is, the state of [...] the arts of production. In production, the particular conditions [...] of each industry will determine how much capital is to be set [...] apart for raw material, how much for machinery, buildings, and all [...] forms of fixed capital, and how many laborers will be assigned to [...] a given machine for a given amount of material. With some kinds of [...] hand-made goods the largest share of capital goes to wages, a less [...] amount for materials, and a very small proportion for machinery [...] and tools. In many branches of agriculture and small farming this [...] holds true. The converse, however, is true in many manufactures, [...] where machinery is largely used. No two industries will maintain [...] the same proportion between the three elements. The nature of the [...] industry, therefore, will determine whether a greater or a less [...] share of capital will be spent in wages. It is needless to say [...] that this condition of things is not one to be changed at the [...] demand of either of the two parties to production, Labor and [...] Capital; it responds only to the advance of mechanical science or [...] general intelligence. It is impossible, then, to escape the [...] conclusion that general causes restrict the amount which will, [...] under any normal investment, go to the payment of wages. Only [...] within the limits set by these forces can any further expansion or [...] contraction take place. (3.) Within these limits, of course, minor [...] changes may take place, so that the fund <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> to be [...] “fixed” or “absolutely predetermined”; but these changes must take [...] place within such narrow limits that they do not much affect the [...] practical side of the question. How these changes act, may be seen [...] {{in a part of the}} following illustration of the above principles: ...|$|E

Since, therefore, the order of our mental phenomena must be studied in those phenomena, and not inferred from the laws of any phenomena more general, there is a distinct and separate Science of Mind.|$|R
60|$|It is obvious, in fact, {{that if we}} {{take any}} two {{correlative}} names, father and son for instance, though the objects denoted by the names are different, they both, in a certain sense, connote the same thing. They <b>can</b> <b>not,</b> indeed, <b>be</b> <b>said</b> to connote the same attribute: to be a father, <b>is</b> <b>not</b> {{the same thing as}} to be a son. But when we call one man a father, another a son, what we mean to affirm is a set of facts, which are exactly the same in both cases. To predicate of A that he is the father of B, and of B that he is the son of A, is to assert one and the same fact in different words. The two propositions are exactly equivalent: neither of them asserts more or asserts less than the other. The paternity of A and the filiety of B <b>are</b> <b>not</b> two facts, but two modes of expressing the same fact. That fact, when analysed, consists of a series of physical events or phenomena, in which both A and B are parties concerned, and from which they both derive names. What those names really connote, is this series of events: that is the meaning, and the whole meaning, which either of them is intended to convey. The series of events may <b>be</b> <b>said</b> to constitute the relation; the schoolmen called it the foundation of the relation, fundamentum relationis.|$|R
