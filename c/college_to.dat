40|$|Abstract. Since college English {{teaching}} that {{is set for}} students upgraded from junior <b>colleges</b> <b>to</b> universities has short period and heavy tasks, its current situations are not optimistic. Especially, its listening teaching has much difficulty. Thus, how to help students break away from time-consuming and inefficient English learning and solve problems according to practical situations is a challenge that teachers face with. By analyzing causes for low listening level of students upgraded from junior <b>colleges</b> <b>to</b> universities, this thesis introduces metacognitive strategy to listening teaching and helps students cultivate metacognitive consciousness to improve listening ability of students upgraded from junior <b>colleges</b> <b>to</b> universities effectively...|$|R

5|$|Most of her {{commissions}} {{were carried}} out during the 12 years or so {{between the end of}} the First World War and the start of the Great Depression. She took on several major projects, including designing the landscape of the University of Delaware campus in 1919 at the recommendation of Sharp, who chaired the college's Buildings and Grounds Committee. From 1918 to 1952, Coffin was appointed the University of Delaware’s landscape architect, a position which required Coffin to unite the university’s two separate campuses (the former Delaware <b>College</b> <b>to</b> the north and the Delaware Women’s <b>College</b> <b>to</b> the south) into one cohesive design. This was a challenge since the linear mall design of each was out of alignment with the other. Coffin solved this problem by linking them via a circle instead of curving the straight paths (the university’s library faces this circle today) which rendered the misalignment unnoticeable to the pedestrian.|$|E

5|$|Nash {{himself was}} asked by the <b>College</b> <b>to</b> design a new {{building}} near fashionable Trafalgar Square but Nash's elaborate plan proved too costly and ambitious for the College. At the same time the College also asked Robert Abraham to submit to them a second plan for the building. When Nash heard that another architect was approached behind his back he reacted vehemently, and attacked the heralds. The College nevertheless continued with their plans. However they were constantly beset by conflicts between the different officers over the amount needed to build a new building. By 1827 the college still had no coherent plan; the Duke of Norfolk ordered the <b>College</b> <b>to</b> drop the matter altogether. By 1842 the heralds were reconciled with their location and once again commissioned Abraham to build a new octagonal-shaped Record Room {{on the site of the}} old Sugar House.|$|E
