5|$|The median house {{price in}} Canberra as of September 2009 was $511,820, lower than only Sydney among capital cities {{of more than}} 100,000 people, having surpassed Melbourne and Perth since 2005. The median weekly rent paid by Canberra {{residents}} is higher than rents in all other states and territories. As at January 2014 the median unit rent in Canberra was $410 per week and median housing rent was $460, making the city the third most expensive in the country. Factors <b>contributing</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> higher weekly rental market include; higher average weekly incomes, restricted land supply, and inflationary clauses in the ACT Residential Tenancies Act.|$|E

25|$|Congenital {{generalized}} hypertrichosis terminalis {{is thought}} to be caused by genetic changes on chromosome 17 resulting in the addition or removal of millions of nucleotides.

25|$|As of late 2015, reports {{suggest the}} Turkish Army (along {{with the rest}} of the Armed Forces) have seen their {{personnel}} strengths increase to similar levels of the 2000s. Factors <b>contributing</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> are further destabilization of Syria and Iraq due to ISIS and the Russian intervention in Syria, as-well as the re-emergence of a PKK insurgency in Turkey's south east.|$|E
25|$|In Russian America, {{work began}} in 1865 but initially, little {{progress}} was made. <b>Contributing</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> {{lack of success}} was the climate, the terrain, supply shortages and the late arrival of the construction teams. Nevertheless, the entire route through Russian America was surveyed {{by the fall of}} 1866. Rather than waiting until spring, as was the usual practice, construction began and continued through that winter.|$|E

Another group of tourists are the elderly on free guided bus tours (Kaffeefahrten), stopping for coffee and wool plaids at a farm before touring Lüneburg for an hour.|$|E
25|$|Rockabilly music enjoyed great {{popularity}} in the United States during 1956 and 1957, but radio play declined after 1960. Factors <b>contributing</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> decline are usually cited as the 1959 death of Buddy Holly in an airplane crash (along with Ritchie Valens and the Big Bopper), the induction of Elvis Presley into the army in 1958, and a general change in American musical tastes. The style remained popular longer in England, where it attracted a fanatical following right up through the mid-1960s.|$|E

Women contribute about 13% of articles, with a focus on chemistry, medical sciences and social sciences. <b>Contributing</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> trend is the fact that PhD programmes in Iran now require students to have publications in the Web of Science.|$|E

25|$|The 1960s {{also saw}} an {{expansion}} of the University of New Brunswick - due to increased post-war university enrolment - as well as the construction of the Fredericton campus of Saint Thomas University. Also <b>contributing</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> expansion was the move of the Law School from Saint John to the Fredericton area. This expansion of the post-secondary sector also contributed to Fredericton's population growth during the 1960s and 1970s. Since then, the city's population has continued to grow though at a slower rate due to slower growth of the government sector - along with hiring freezes and in some cases layoffs - during the Frank McKenna and Bernard Lord governments.|$|E
25|$|Cope's {{description}} promoted hadrosaurids as amphibious, <b>contributing</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> long-time image. His reasoning {{was that}} {{the teeth of the}} lower jaw were weakly connected to the bone and liable to break off if used to consume terrestrial food, and he described the beak as weak as well. However, aside from misidentifying several of the skull bones, by chance the lower jaws were missing the walls supporting the teeth from the inside; the teeth were actually well-supported. Cope intended to describe the skeleton as well as the skull, but his promised paper never appeared. It was purchased for the American Museum of Natural History in 1899, where it acquired its present designation AMNH5730.|$|E
25|$|Murmurs sound {{characterized}} the quieter, introverted {{side of the}} first wave of alternative rock in the United States. The sound was new at the time, though not stepping beyond the constructs of traditional rock music. The guitars have a bright, ring-like chime that brought on comparisons to The Byrds, and the bass guitar has the bright punchy sound of the Rickenbacker favored by Mike Mills. Mills carries much of the melodic element of the music on the bass, contributing to the moody sound of early R.E.M. albums. Also <b>contributing</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> sound is the distant singing of Michael Stipe whose obscure lyrics, sung indistinctly, lend to the mystery and depth of the music.|$|E

25|$|The Yemen {{civil war}} has {{resulted}} in a severe lack of food and vegetation. Agricultural production in the country has suffered substantially leaving Yemen to face the threat of Famine. Yemen is currently under blockade by land, sea and air which has disrupted the delivery of many of the countries resources. In country where 90% of the food requirements are met through imports this blockade has had serious consequences concerning the availability of food to its citizens. It is reported that out of the population of 24 million in Yemen, everyday 13 million are going hungry and 6 million are at risk of starvation. <b>Contributing</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> scarcity in food is the deliberate attack on the country’s agricultural resources. According to reports there is strong evidence suggesting that Yemen’s agricultural sector is being deliberately destroyed, exacerbating the food shortage and leaving the country dependent solely on imports to meet the food requirements of its citizens.|$|E

500|$|The censors {{ended up}} pulling [...] "I'll See You in Court", {{preventing}} it from airing in the United States during the series' original run. Terry Rakolta, a political activist from Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, had launched a letter-writing {{campaign against the}} program after viewing the Season 3 episode [...] "Her Cups Runneth Over" [...] in January 1989. Offended by the episode's content, she urged advertisers to boycott the show, several of whom did or pledged to more carefully screen the episodes for which they provided advertising. The campaign garnered more media attention than she had expected and the advertisers' more careful scrutiny of the individual episodes that they supported was a significant factor {{that led to the}} pulling of [...] "I'll See You in Court". [...] <b>Contributing</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> was that the overall topic, sex, was not seen as a topic to be vocally and openly discussed on television.|$|E
