25|$|When a {{concrete}} structure is designed, it is usual {{to specify the}} <b>concrete</b> <b>cover</b> for the rebar (the depth of the rebar within the object). The minimum <b>concrete</b> <b>cover</b> is normally regulated by design or building codes. If the reinforcement {{is too close to}} the surface, early failure due to corrosion may occur. The <b>concrete</b> <b>cover</b> depth can be measured with a cover meter. However, carbonated concrete incurs a durability problem only when there is also sufficient moisture and oxygen to cause electropotential corrosion of the reinforcing steel.|$|E

25|$|Plastic {{reinforcement}} {{often is}} stronger, {{or at least}} has a better strength to weight ratio than reinforcing steels. Also, because it resists corrosion, it does not need a protective <b>concrete</b> <b>cover</b> as thick as steel reinforcement does (typically 30 to 50mm or more). FRP-reinforced structures therefore can be lighter and last longer. Accordingly, for some applications the whole-life cost will be price-competitive with steel-reinforced concrete.|$|E

25|$|The Fort de Saint-Héribert in May 1940 was {{commanded}} by Captain-Commandant :L'Entrée with about 400 men. It started firing on nearby German forces early on 15 May at an initial rate of 50 shots per hour from the 75mm guns, increasing to 75 shots per hour, then 120. The {{same day the}} supporting infantry was withdrawn and the fort was on its own. The fort came under aerial attack in the afternoon. The 16th and 17th were quiet, but on the 18th the fort came under heavy bombardment, returning harassing fire from the fort's 75mm guns, which had so far been unaffected by the German fire. On the 19th the fort received damage to its <b>concrete</b> <b>cover,</b> but {{was able to use}} direct fire against enemy observation stations in the neighborhood. German fire intensified on the 20th, causing damage. During {{the early hours of the}} 21st German patrols began moving in the woods nearby under the cover of smoke bombs. The fort was encircled during daylight hours, but received supporting fire from the Fort d'Andoy, Fort de Malonne and the Fort de Dave. Nevertheless, German artillery was placed within 500 metres of the fort, destroying each turret in turn. The fort continued to resist with machine guns in the ditches, but the fort lost electric power at midday. After sabotaging their remaining weapons and destroying documents, the garrison surrendered at 12:10. The fort suffered one dead, while the Germans had 129 dead and 602 wounded, primarily from the 317th Infantry Regiment.|$|E
2500|$|One {{drawback}} {{to the use}} of FRP reinforcement is their limited fire resistance. Where fire safety is a consideration, structures employing FRP have to maintain their strength and the anchoring of the forces at temperatures to be expected in the event of fire. For purposes of fireproofing an adequate thickness of cement <b>concrete</b> <b>cover</b> or protective cladding is necessary. The addition of 1kg/m3 of polypropylene fibers to concrete has been shown to reduce spalling during a simulated fire. (The improvement is thought to be due to the formation of pathways out of the bulk of the concrete, allowing steam pressure to dissipate.) ...|$|E
2500|$|While the {{organization}} [...] {{of the overall}} defensive line mimicked the Maginot Line, {{the design of the}} individual forts was conservative. [...] In contrast to the French fortifications, distributed along a single main gallery in the fort palmé concept, the Belgian forts remained a set of powerfully-armed, tightly grouped combat blocks surrounded by a defended ditch. Eben-Emael and Battice featured 120mm gun turrets with a range of , and all four forts were equipped with 75mm gun turrets (...) and French 81mm mortars in pit emplacements. [...] Eben-Emael, with its site along the artificial cliff of the Albert Canal cutting, was the only fort to be equipped with artillery casemates. [...] The sheer face also provided a naturally-defended location for the fort's air intakes. The new forts featured extreme levels of concrete and armour protection, with between [...] and [...] of <b>concrete</b> <b>cover</b> and up to [...] of armour on turrets. Learning from World War I, the intervals between forts were liberally supplied with observation positions and infantry shelters.|$|E

40|$|Different {{behaviour}} {{of diverse}} sections of confined Reinforced Concrete (RC) columns under eccentric load is investigated in this study. Three types of sections are considered, which include square columns, square with rounded corners and modified circular columns. Twelve reinforced square concrete columns {{were made from}} normal strength concrete and subdivided into four groups. The first three columns were the Reference Group and had no modification. The next three columnswere modified with round corners and wrapped with three layers of Carbon Fibre Reinforced Polymer (CFRP), another three were bonded with four pieces of segmental circular <b>concrete</b> <b>covers</b> and wrapped with three layers of CFRP, and the last three were bonded with <b>concrete</b> <b>covers</b> and confined with steel straps. All columns were tested under concentric loading, 15 mm and 25 mm eccentric loading. Results from the study show that all confinement methods increase capacity and ductility of columns, in which segmental circular <b>concrete</b> <b>covers</b> considerably reduce the stress concentration on the corners and increase {{the efficiency of the}} confinement.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a new method for retrofitting reinforced concrete (RC) exterior beamcolumn T joints, using segmental circular <b>concrete</b> <b>covers</b> together with Carbon Fibre Reinforced Polymer (CFRP). Two RC T connections without transverse reinforcement {{at the joints}} were cast and tested. The first connection (Strengthened specimen, TS) was glued with the <b>concrete</b> <b>covers</b> around the column at the joint area to modify it from a square to a circular section {{and then it was}} wrapped with CFRP to strengthen its capacity. A load was first applied on the second connection (Repaired specimen, TR) to cause a serious failure then it was repaired. The repair scheme of the second connection was identical to the first connection. Results of testing the two connections have shown that the performances of both the strengthened and the repaired connections were improved significantly. The glued <b>concrete</b> <b>covers</b> worked well with the existing concrete to resist shear load. Moreover, the wrap on the modified circular sections helped in increasing the effectiveness of CFRP by increasing the confinement effect on the concrete and reduce the possibility of debonding of CFRP at the joints...|$|R
