5|$|Two {{species are}} IUCN Vulnerable: the desert {{tortoise}} (California and Nevada) and the gopher tortoise (Georgia, also the official tortoise of Florida). Three species are Near Threatened: the diamondback terrapin (Maryland), the ornate box turtle (Kansas), {{and the common}} box turtle (Missouri with the three-toed subspecies, North Carolina and Tennessee with the eastern subspecies). All the remaining state reptile species are Least Concern. Interestingly, all the non-turtle reptiles fall into this category, but the only two turtles in relative safety are the <b>common</b> <b>snapping</b> <b>turtle</b> (New York) and the painted turtle (Colorado, Illinois, Michigan, Vermont).|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} turtle species are ambush predators, {{including}} chelydrid snapping turtles. The <b>common</b> <b>snapping</b> <b>turtle</b> (Chelydra serpentinais) is an aquatic ambush hunter, capturing its prey with its beak-like jaws.|$|E
25|$|Typical {{reptiles}} in the Mixed Grassland ecoregion are the horned lizard (Phrynosoma), {{common garter snake}} (Thamnophis sirtalis), <b>common</b> <b>snapping</b> <b>turtle</b> (Chelydra serpentina), and prairie rattlesnake, {{and western}} painted turtle (C. p. bellii). The leopard frogs (Rana pipiens) and chorus frogs (Pseudacris) are typical amphibians of the Grasslands National Park.|$|E
50|$|<b>Common</b> <b>snapping</b> <b>turtles</b> {{have few}} predators when older, but eggs {{are subject to}} {{predation}} by crows, mink, skunks, foxes, and raccoons. As hatchlings and juveniles, most of the same predators will attack {{them as well as}} herons (mostly great blue herons), bitterns, hawks, owls, fishers, bullfrogs, large fish, and snakes. There are records during winter in Canada of hibernating adult <b>common</b> <b>snapping</b> <b>turtles</b> being ambushed and predated by northern river otters. Other natural predators which have reportedly preyed on adults include coyotes, black bears, alligators and their larger cousins, alligator <b>snapping</b> <b>turtles.</b> Large, old male <b>snapping</b> <b>turtles</b> have very few natural threats due to their formidable size and defenses, and tend to have a very low annual mortality rate.|$|R
50|$|Large {{populations of}} turtles inhabit Cootes Paradise, {{including}} Painted <b>Turtles,</b> <b>Common</b> <b>Snapping</b> <b>Turtles,</b> and Northern Map Turtles. Several species of snakes {{are also found}} in the area, including Northern Water Snakes.|$|R
5|$|Chicks may {{be killed}} by <b>common</b> <b>snapping</b> <b>turtles,</b> large gulls, bald eagles and large fish such as {{northern}} pike and largemouth bass. The eagle in particular is a significant predator of chicks.|$|R
25|$|Mammals {{such as the}} white-tailed deer, badger, skunk, beaver, raccoon are {{relatively}} common, while the pronghorn, mule deer and coyote {{are a few of}} the less likely to be observed of the 36 mammal species that have been recorded on the refuge. Lake Ilo NWR is also home to three species of amphibians and six species of reptiles including the tiger salamander, <b>common</b> <b>snapping</b> <b>turtle,</b> bull snake and the chorus frog. Northern pike, yellow perch and black crappie are examples of the 11 fish species that have been documented in the refuge.|$|E
500|$|As of 2010, four U.S. states {{designated}} the painted turtle as official reptile. Vermont honored the reptile in 1994, following {{the suggestion of}} Cornwall Elementary School students. In 1995, Michigan followed, based {{on the recommendation of}} Niles fifth graders, who discovered the state lacked an official reptile. Illinois citizens, in 2004, voted to select the painted turtle as their state reptile and the legislature made it official in 2005. Colorado chose the western painted turtle in 2008, following the efforts of two succeeding years of Jay Biachi's fourth grade classes. [...] In New York, the painted turtle narrowly lost (5,048 to 5,005, versus the <b>common</b> <b>snapping</b> <b>turtle)</b> a 2006 statewide student election for state reptile.|$|E
500|$|Schoolchildren often {{start the}} campaigns for state reptiles. Three {{of the four}} states {{choosing}} the painted turtle credit school classes with initiating the process. The process may require students to be knowledgeable of their selection, {{as was the case}} in Florida when students advocated for the loggerhead sea turtle; [...] "Working with State Representative Curtis Richardson (D-Tallahassee), the students provided information and answered questions regarding the symbols." [...] In New York, students statewide voted to pick one of four turtles; the <b>common</b> <b>snapping</b> <b>turtle</b> edged the painted turtle 5,048 to 5,005. Assemblyman Joel Miller had sponsored the turtle election to interest students in politics and said of the results, [...] "as with every election, every vote is important".|$|E
50|$|Common {{habitats}} are shallow ponds or streams. Some may inhabit brackish environments, such as estuaries. <b>Common</b> <b>snapping</b> <b>turtles</b> sometimes bask—though rarely observed—by {{floating on}} the surface with only their carapaces exposed, though in the northern parts of their range, they also readily bask on fallen logs in early spring. In shallow waters, <b>common</b> <b>snapping</b> <b>turtles</b> may lie beneath a muddy bottom with only their heads exposed, stretching their long necks to the surface for an occasional breath (their nostrils are positioned on the very tip of the snout, effectively functioning as snorkels). <b>Snapping</b> <b>turtles</b> consume both plant and animal matter, and are important aquatic scavengers, {{but they are also}} active hunters that prey on anything they can swallow, including many invertebrates, fish, frogs, reptiles (including snakes and smaller turtles), unwary birds, and small mammals. In some areas, adult <b>snapping</b> <b>turtles</b> can be incidentally detrimental to breeding waterfowl, as they will occasionally take ducklings and goslings but their effect on such prey is frequently exaggerated.|$|R
50|$|Mammals {{found there}} include common opossum, Pallas's long-tongued bat, common vampire bat, tapeti, capybara, and nine-banded armadillo. There are also cane toads and <b>common</b> <b>snapping</b> <b>turtles,</b> {{as well as}} several native and {{introduced}} fish species which provide the basis of a local fishing industry, including the native Prochilodus magdalenae which uses the wetlands for spawning.|$|R

50|$|<b>Common</b> <b>snapping</b> <b>turtles</b> {{generally}} hibernate {{for about}} 6 months from early October to mid April. They live in lakes during their active months, then travel to small offshoot streams to hibernate. Hibernacula are about 100-150 meters {{away from the}} main body of the home lake. Most <b>snapping</b> <b>turtles</b> hibernate by burrowing into the banks of alder streams or vegetated streams, but some use other structures such as abandoned beaver dens. These streams are typically less than 0.3 m deep and 0.7 m wide, covered by sunken alder roots or fallen trees, and not covered by ice in the winter. Many animals return to the same stream to hibernate in subsequent years.|$|R

50|$|It is {{a common}} {{misconception}} that <b>common</b> <b>snapping</b> <b>turtles</b> may be safely {{picked up by the}} tail with no harm to the animal; in fact, this has a high chance of injuring the turtle, especially the tail itself and the vertebral column. Lifting the turtle with the hands is difficult and dangerous. Snappers can stretch their necks back across their own carapace and to their hind feet on either side to bite. When they feel stressed, they release a musky odor from behind their legs.|$|R
50|$|Reptile House was {{refurbished}} {{and most}} of it re-built through much of 2008 through to 2010, to make the improvements required for the growth of the animal collection (from 18 species in 2008 to 46 species at the start of 2011). A wide variety of reptiles, amphibians and invertebrates are housed in the reptile collection including; western diamondback rattlesnake, Gray's monitors, Cuban crocodile, dwarf crocodiles, <b>common</b> <b>snapping</b> <b>turtles,</b> white lipped tree vipers, rhinoceros iguanas, golden mantella frogs (for which Wingham Wildlife Park hold the ESF studbook) and many more.|$|R
50|$|Wildlife include, common otter, mink, bobcats, coyotes, red fox, ducks, raccoons, skunks, opossum, gray squirrels, mice, {{rats and}} eastern cottontails. Where {{the banks are}} muddy, {{crayfish}} make their volcano-shaped homes. Many birds including great blue herons, great egrets and belted kingfishers make their homes among and eat from the creek, and double-crested cormorants, American white pelicans and American coots often visit the lake. Herpetofauna include lizards, water moccasins, salamanders, red-eared sliders and <b>common</b> <b>snapping</b> <b>turtles.</b> The most <b>common</b> fish are sunfish, largemouth bass, white crappie and channel catfish.|$|R
50|$|The <b>common</b> <b>snapping</b> <b>turtle</b> (Chelydra serpentina) {{is a large}} {{freshwater}} turtle of {{the family}} Chelydridae.

50|$|In their environment, {{they are}} {{at the top of the}} food chain, causing them to feel less fear or {{aggression}} in some cases. When they encounter a species unfamiliar to them such as humans, in rare instances, they will become curious and survey the situation and even more rarely may bump their nose on a leg of the person standing in the water. Although <b>snapping</b> <b>turtles</b> have fierce dispositions, when they are encountered in the water or a swimmer approaches, they will slip quietly away from any disturbance or may seek shelter under mud or grass nearby. <b>Common</b> <b>snapping</b> <b>turtles</b> are very aggressive if caught, and have a strong enough bite to easily amputate human fingers.|$|R
