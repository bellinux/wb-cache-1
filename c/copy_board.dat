50|$|Most programs, however, {{use more}} than just the raw board {{information}} to evaluate positions. Data such as which stones are connected in strings, which strings are associated with each other, which groups of stones are in risk of capture and which groups of stones are effectively dead are necessary to make an accurate evaluation of the position. While this information can be extracted from just the stone positions, much of it can be computed more quickly if it is updated in an incremental, per-move basis. This incremental updating requires more information to be stored as the state of the board, which in turn can make <b>copying</b> the <b>board</b> take longer. This kind of trade-off is indicative of the problems involved in making fast computer Go programs.|$|R

40|$|Lockheed Martin Idaho Technologies Company (LMITCO) used {{a systems}} {{engineering}} approach {{to take the}} first step toward defining a requirements baseline for all indirect work at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory. The intent of this effort was to define the requirements for indirect work, identify the activities necessary to meet the requirements, and to produce defensible cost estimates for the work. The result of this effort is a scrubbed-down, defensible budget for all indirect work in FY 1997. Buying power for each dollar of direct work was increased by $. 02. Recommendations are identified for improvements to this process in FY 1998. The purpose of this report is twofold.
