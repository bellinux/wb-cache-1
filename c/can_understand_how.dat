[...] "Fortunately, the sequence was carefully choreographed beforehand. We worked out all the moves by rehearsing in a little studio. It was shot on two Saturdays {{in the heart of}} downtown Chicago. The first day was during a real parade, and John got some very long shots. Then radio stations carried announcements inviting people to take part in 'a John Hughes movie'. The word got around fast and 10,000 people showed up! For the final shot, I turned around and saw a river of people. I put my hands {{up at the end of}} the number and heard this huge roar. I <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> rock stars feel. That kind of reaction feeds you." ...|$|E
500|$|Chapter XI {{deals with}} {{evidence}} from biogeography, {{starting with the}} observation that differences in flora and fauna from separate regions cannot be explained by environmental differences alone; South America, Africa, and Australia all have regions with similar climates at similar latitudes, but those regions have very different plants and animals. The species found in one area of a continent are more closely allied with species found in other regions of that same continent than to species found on other continents. Darwin noted that barriers to migration {{played an important role}} in the differences between the species of different regions. The coastal sea life of the Atlantic and Pacific sides of Central America had almost no species in common even though the Isthmus of Panama was only a few miles wide. His explanation was a combination of migration and descent with modification. He went on to say: [...] "On this principle of inheritance with modification, we <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> it is that sections of genera, whole genera, and even families are confined to the same areas, as is so commonly and notoriously the case." [...] Darwin explained how a volcanic island formed a few hundred miles from a continent might be colonised by a few species from that continent. These species would become modified over time, but would still be related to species found on the continent, and Darwin observed that this was a common pattern. Darwin discussed ways that species could be dispersed across oceans to colonise islands, many of which he had investigated experimentally.|$|E

However, after the death of Pope John Paul in 2005, Paisley expressed sympathy for Catholics, saying [...] "We <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> Roman Catholics feel at the death of the Pope and we would want in no way to interfere with their expression of sorrow and grief at this time." ...|$|E
2500|$|One area of {{research}} featuring nanobiotechnology is the extracellular matrices of cells (ECM). The ECM is primarily composed of interwoven fibers of collagen and elastin that have diameters ranging from 10–300nm. [...] In addition to holding the cell in place, the ECM {{has a variety of}} other functions including providing a point of attachment for the ECM of other cells and transmembrane receptors that are essential for life. Until recently it has been nearly impossible to study the physical forces that help cells maintain their functionality, but nanobiotechnology has given us the ability to learn more about these interactions. Using the unique properties of nanoparticles, it is possible to control how the nanoparticles adhere to certain patterns present in the ECM, and as a result <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> changes in the ECM's shape can affect cell functionality.|$|E

2500|$|Although her {{service was}} marred by her nervousness, and taxed her health, Jane Ely quickly {{became one of the}} Queen's most trusted attendants. The Queen {{referred}} to Jane as “almost one of ourselves”, which indicates the difference that Victoria liked to maintain between herself and non-royals. Jane became the most prominent of ladies that were recognised “agents” of the Queen, the others being Harriet Phipps and Horatia Stopford. The role was exploited, especially in the royal household, where they found in Jane a useful advocate to the Queen when requesting approval for a course of action. The use of Jane as an unofficial secretary was widely acknowledged in society, and references to her are found in many letters from the aristocracy. When the Earl of Beaconsfield fell out with the Queen after he refused to meet Lord Chelmsford, he wrote despairingly to Jane, with the probable intention that she would show it to the Queen, that “I love the Queen — perhaps the only person in this world left to me that I do love; and therefore you <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> much it worries and disquiets me, when there is a cloud between us.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In mid-2002, LucasArts {{announced}} Full Throttle: Hell on Wheels for Windows and, for {{the first}} time in the series, PlayStation 2 and Xbox. The game was to be an action-adventure, with more emphasis on action and fighting than adventure, because the designers wanted the game to feel more physical than the first. Hell on Wheels would have been set in El Nada, Ben's [...] "old stomping ground", whose roads have been mysteriously destroyed. Ben believes that one of the new gangs introduced in the game, the Hound Dogs, are behind this but soon discovers a more sinister and murderous plot. Together with Father Torque and Maureen, he would have thwarted the unnamed villain's plan and protected [...] "the freedom of the open road". Sean Clark was named the project lead of Hell on Wheels and the development progressed smoothly until late 2003, when it was abruptly canceled. Just months prior to that, at E3 2003, a playable demo was shown and a teaser trailer was released by LucasArts. Simon Jeffery (then president of LucasArts) said that [...] "We do not want to disappoint the many fans of Full Throttle, and hope everyone <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> committed we are to delivering the best-quality gaming experience that we possibly can" [...] in the official press release. Critics cited poor graphics compared to other 3D action adventures of the time and Tim Schafer's lack of involvement in the project as possible reasons for its cancellation. Additionally, Roy Conrad, the original voice actor for Ben, died in 2002.|$|E
2500|$|On 24 April, the FA handed Suárez a 10-match ban, after a three-man {{independent}} committee {{agreed that}} the standard three match ban was insufficient. In their written reasons, the FA pointed to Suárez's lackadaisical attitude to the whole incident, citing that he [...] "had not fully appreciated the gravity and seriousness of this truly exceptional incident". They also argued that [...] "these unsavoury pictures would have given a bad image of English football domestically and across the world alike", {{and that it would}} act as a deterrent to further behaviour. Suárez ruled out an appeal, citing recognition of his actions being unacceptable and that it would give [...] "the wrong impression" [...] if he did so. Rodgers launched a strong defence of his player stating that [...] "when you look at it in the cold light of day then it was violent conduct... he made a mistake and he's got a sanction which I don't believe fits with what he did". Rodgers also launched a broadside on the FA and their handling of the case, claiming [...] "prejudices" [...] against the FA led to the lengthy ban, and also pointed out alleged inconsistencies in the prior punishment of players who have bitten another human being, giving the lack of punishment Jermain Defoe received for biting Javier Mascherano in 2006 as an example. After the ban was imposed, Ivanović finally accepted Suárez's apology. Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson was reminded of Eric Cantona's suspension in 1995 for kicking a racist Crystal Palace spectator, and showed empathy toward the situation, saying [...] "I think back to Cantona and I have to say that a nine-month ban doesn't equate to a 10-match, does it? I <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> Liverpool are aggrieved at it, I must say that".|$|E
