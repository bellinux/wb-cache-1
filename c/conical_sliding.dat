50|$|A conical {{rotor brake}} motor {{incorporates}} the brake {{as an integral}} part of the <b>conical</b> <b>sliding</b> rotor. When the motor is at rest, a spring acts on the sliding rotor and forces the brake ring against the brake cap in the motor, holding the rotor stationary. When the motor is energized, its magnetic field generates both an axial and a radial component. The axial component overcomes the spring force, releasing the brake; while the radial component causes the rotor to turn. There is no additional brake control required.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{determine}} the hydrodynamic pressure distribution in oil film and the load carrying capacities of <b>conical</b> <b>slide</b> micro bearings with grooved sleeves. The results for some bearings examples are presented. For the bearings taken into account, the Reynolds equation was solved by the method of Finite Differences. In the calculations, the Reynolds boundary condition was applied. The simulation was performed for the <b>conical</b> <b>slide</b> micro bearings with the groves parallel to the cone generating line. The function of lubrication gap height for the <b>conical</b> <b>slide</b> bearings with sleeves covered with microgrooves was assumed on the basis of existing papers. The results obtained for the analogous bearings without the microgrooves are also shown, therefore the influence of microgrooves on the <b>conical</b> <b>slide</b> micro bearings can be observed. On the basis of the results, one can conclude, that applying microgrooves on the bearing sleeve surface causes the increase of the value of hydrodynamic pressure and longitudinal and transverse components of the load carrying capacity of the bearing. Furthermore, the effect of the microgrooves and their impact is noticeable in graphs of hydrodynamic pressure distribution. The applied method of investigation of the impact of microgrooves on a bearing operation is simpler and less expensive than the experimental studies, however it is necessary to verify that the results obtained with this method are correct and whether in fact applying microgrooves, besides form facilitate lubrication, causes the improvement in bearing operating parameters...|$|R

New, conically surfaced, composite piston-cap structure, passively retained in metallic piston, made from carbon/carbon material, machined to shape. Shape includes conical faces, conical extensions intersect at common vertex on cylindrical axis of piston body, allowing thermal-stress-free retention of cap at all temperatures. When assembly heated or cooled, metal expands or contracts radially from coincident vertex. Where metal makes contact with carbon/carbon cap, snugly fitting <b>conical</b> faces <b>slide</b> without interference. Since metal body free to expand, no thermal stress produced in metal body or carbon/carbon cap...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{concerns}} the derivation of the stochastic modified Reynolds equations describing the hydrodynamic pressure for non-Newtonian, viscoelastic, lubricant inside the curvilinear orthogonal (spherical, <b>conical,</b> cylindrical, parabolic) <b>slide</b> bearing. Non- isothermal, unsteady and random flow conditions and thermal deformations of the bearing and its bearing sleeve {{are taken into}} account. This problem finds application in ship power plants, electric locomotive designing, and precision engineering. In particular case are determined pressure and capacity distributions in spherical bearing...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} determine {{the nature of the}} deformation and fracture of silicon carbide and its effects on friction properties. Friction experiments were conducted with hemispherical and <b>conical</b> diamond riders <b>sliding</b> on the basal plane of silicon carbide. The results indicate that, when deformation is primarily elastic, the friction does not depend on crystallographic orientation and there is no detectable fracture or cracking. When, however, plastic deformation occurs, silicon carbide exhibits anisotropic friction and deformation behavior. Surface fracture crack patterns surrounding wear tracks are observed to be of three types. The crack-geometries of two types are generally independent of orientation, the third crack, however, depends on the orientation. All surface cracks extend into subsurface...|$|R
40|$|Friction is a {{ubiquitous}} {{phenomenon in}} everyday activities spanning from vehicles where efficient brakes are mandatory up to mechanical devices where its minimum effects are pursued for energy efficiency issues. Recently, theoretical models succeed correlating the friction behavior with energy transference via phonons between sliding surfaces. Therefore, {{considering that the}} energy losses by friction are prompted through phonons, the chemical surface structure between sliding surfaces {{is very important to}} determine the friction phenomenon. In this work, we address the issue of friction between a <b>conical</b> diamond tip <b>sliding</b> on different functionalized flat steel surfaces by focusing the influence of the chemical bonds in the outermost layers on the sliding resistance. This geometry allows probing the coupling of the sharp tip with terminator species on the top and underneath material surface at in-depth friction measurements from 20 to 200 nm. Experimentally, the friction coefficient decreases when nitrogen atoms are substituted for oxygen in the iron network. This effect is interpreted as due to energy losses through phonons whilst lower vibrational frequency excitation modes imply lower friction coefficients and a more accurate adjustment is obtained when a theoretical model with longitudinal adsorbate vibration is used...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{simulate}} and determine a hydrodynamic pressure distribution in a lubrication gap of <b>slide</b> <b>conical</b> bearing gap, assuming that the lubricating oil has non-Newtonian properties. Investigations were carried out by using the commercial CFD software ANSYS Academic Research for fluid flow phenomenon (Fluent). Calculations were performed for bearings without misalignment, i. e. where the cone generating line of bearing shaft {{is parallel to the}} cone generating line of bearing sleeve. The Ostwald-de Waele model for non-Newtonian fluids was adopted in this simulation. The coefficients of Ostwald-de Waele relationship were determined by application of the least squares approximation method and fitting curves described by this model to the experimental data, obtained for motor oils. The calculated hydrodynamic pressure distributions were compared with the data obtained for corresponding bearings, but assuming that lubricating oil has Newtonian properties. In this research, the GÃ¼mbel boundary condition (also known as half-Sommerfeld condition) was imposed. Moreover, there was assumed: a steady-state operating conditions of a bearing, laminar, incompressible flow of lubricating oil, no slip on bearing surfaces, negligible heat conduction effect of bearing material, pressure on the side surfaces of bearing gap is equal to atmospheric pressure, no oil supply and oil outflow from bearing gap. This paper presents results for bearings with different rotational speeds and of different bearing gap heights. The results are presented in the form of contours of hydrodynamic pressure values. The tables contain values of maximum oil pressure generated in bearing gap and also bearing load carrying capacities calculated for investigated bearings...|$|R
