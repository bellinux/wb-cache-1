40|$|Abstract: A robust, {{non-contact}} sensor {{that measures}} BOF endpoint bath temperature {{has been developed}} and evaluated over {{a large number of}} industry heats. The optical hardware consists of a radiation <b>collection</b> <b>head</b> and a multi-wavelength detection unit. The radiation <b>collection</b> <b>head</b> aimed at the furnace mouth is used to collect, and thus enhance, the effective radiant energy emitted from the hostile environment adjacent a furnace as well as to reduce spurious radiations from other nearby furnaces. The detection unit separates the collected radiations into spectroscopy and then converts this spectroscopy into digital signals. Finally, the signal information is processed to determine the carbon content of the steel contained in the metallurgical furnace. The Preliminary results after online carbon content sensing are discussed...|$|E

40|$|The {{introduction}} of Free Primary Education in Kenya left {{the government with}} a greater role and burden in financing primary education. The new role encompassed mobilization of resources, paying tuition fees, training, recruitment and paying teachers, {{and the provision of}} infrastructure and instructional materials. Parents on the other hand were required to provide basic needs for their children such as school uniforms, food and transport to school where necessary. This paper sought to establish the funding mechanisms for FPE and examine the sustainability of the FPE initiative. The study was conducted in Kakamega and Kajiado districts (now Counties). From the 59 schools sampled, 59 headteachers and 177 teachers were included in the study. Fourteen Area Education Officers (AEOs), 118 parents, 118 School Management Committee (SMC) members, 2 District Education Officers and 7 senior officers from the Ministry of Education headquarters were also interviewed. The study used questionnaires, interview schedules and Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) for data <b>collection.</b> <b>Head</b> teachers and teachers indicated that no preparation for FPE had been given to them prior to implementation and the training given after {{introduction of}} FPE was inadequate and rushed. Head teachers and teachers revealed that most parents were not actively involved in school management affairs and had misinterpreted the FPE policy. Members of SMC were seen as lacking the necessary capacity to contribute effectively in financial management...|$|E

He has many other things--rifles and revolvers, the handle of a china cup, and an {{excellent}} <b>collection</b> of bushmen's <b>heads.</b> But more precious than the entire <b>collection</b> is another <b>head,</b> perfectly dried and cured, with sandy hair and a yellowish beard, which is kept wrapped in the finest of fibre lava-lavas. When Mauki goes to war with villages beyond his realm, he invariably gets out this head, and alone in his grass palace, contemplates it long and solemnly. At such times the hush of death falls on the village, and not even a pickaninny dares make a noise. The head is esteemed the most powerful devil-devil on Malaita, and to the possession of it is ascribed all of Mauki's greatness.|$|R
