50|$|With the {{exception}} of the L98A1, the SA80 system is a selective fire gas-operated design that uses ignited powder gases bled through a port in the barrel to provide the weapon's automation. The rifle uses a short-stroke gas piston system located above the barrel, which is fed gas through a three-position adjustable gas regulator. The first gas setting is used for normal operation, the second is for use in difficult environmental conditions, while the third setting prevents any gas from reaching the piston and is used to launch rifle grenades. The weapon uses a rotating cylindrical bolt that contains seven radially mounted locking splines, an extractor and casing ejector. The bolt's rotation is controlled by a <b>cam</b> <b>stud</b> that slides inside a helical camming guide machined into the bolt carrier.|$|E
5000|$|The outer {{diameter}} (OD) of the <b>cam</b> follower (<b>stud</b> or yoke) {{can be the}} standard cylindrical shape or be [...] Crowned cam followers are used to keep the load evenly distributed if it deflects or {{if there is any}} misalignment between the follower and the followed surface. They are also used in turntable type applications to reduce skidding. Crowned followers can compensate for up to 0.5° of misalignment, while a cylindrical OD can only tolerate 0.06°. The only disadvantage is that they cannot bear as much load because of higher stresses.|$|R
5000|$|The SG 540 is an air-cooled, gas-operated, {{selective}} fire {{assault rifle}} that fires from a closed bolt position. SIG designers used a long-stroke piston-driven action (with the recoil spring {{wrapped around the}} piston rod itself) and an adjustable gas regulator with three settings: [...] "0"—used to launch rifle grenades, [...] "1"—used in normal operating conditions and [...] "2"—used in extreme environmental conditions or {{in the presence of}} heavy fouling. The firearm is locked into battery by means of a rotating bolt which features two heavy steel locking lugs. The bolt head is rotated by a control cam riding in a helical guide slot machined into the bolt carrier. When a shot is fired, propellant gases from the barrel are fed into the gas cylinder located above the barrel and impart rearward pressure on the piston rod, which drives the bolt carrier back. After a certain amount of free travel built into the system to allow the projectile to depart the barrel, residual gas pressures in the bore drop to a safe level, allowing the breech to be opened. The cam slot in the bolt carrier proceeds to actuate the <b>camming</b> <b>stud</b> in the bolt, rotating the bolt head out of engagement with the locking abutments in the receiver. The spent cartridge casing is extracted by a claw extractor contained in the bolt assembly while a protrusion on one of the internal bolt carrier guide rails in the upper receiver acts as the fixed ejector, removing the casing through a port {{on the right side of}} the receiver housing.|$|R
50|$|The {{faceplate}} may {{be attached}} to the lathe in several ways: the two most common are a thread and a precision cone arrangement or threaded studs and a circular recess fitting a flange {{on the end of the}} spindle. Increasingly common is the camlock arrangement where shaped <b>studs</b> and <b>cams</b> replace threaded <b>studs</b> for rapid exchanging of the faceplate with other accessories, such as three or four jaw chucks.|$|R
50|$|<b>Cam</b> Fella began <b>stud</b> duty in 1984 {{and had an}} illustrious career siring 1,002 foals {{who earned}} $106.7m in prizemoney. His {{offspring}} included such notable horses as Eternal Camnation, Presidential Ball, Precious Bunny, Cam's Card Shark and Camluck {{all of whom have}} been inducted into the Living Hall of Fame or elected as Hall of Fame Immortals as well as $2m earners Goalie Jeff and Camtastic and fastest Standardbred of all time Cambest. He was the leading sire in North America in 1993 and 1995 and his son Camluck and grandson Bettor's Delight (by Cam's Card Shark) have both also been the leading sire.|$|R
5000|$|In 1854 he {{graduated}} from gymnasium in Liepāja and started his studies at the University of Tartu (then Dorpat). His main subject and interest were economics. While studying there he became known with the first public declaration of Latvian nationality. He affixed a carte de visite to his door that read [...] "C. Woldemar <b>stud.</b> <b>cam.</b> Latweetis." [...] At the time, it was almost unheard of for an educated person to call himself a Latvian; education meant Germanisation, and Valdemārs' act has been compared with Martin Luther's posting of the 95 Theses {{at the door of}} the Castle Church in Wittenberg in its importance for the birth of Latvian nationalism. Valdemārs is seen as the spiritual father of the First Awakening. With Juris Alunāns, he led Latvian student gatherings while in Tartu and advocated the study of folklore.|$|R
5000|$|Though the New Latvians {{can be seen}} as part of a {{primarily}} {{cultural and}} literary movement, their cause had significant political ramifications due to the socio-economic conditions then prevailing in Latvia (part of the Russian Empire, it was nonetheless dominated by the Baltic German nobility). 1856 is usually given as the date of the movement's beginning because of the publication of Alunāns' book and the founding of the major Latvian language newspaper Mājas Viesis which provided a counterpoint to the pro-German newspaper Latviešu Avīzes. Another contemporary and seminal event was the public declaration of nationality by a leader of the movement, Krišjānis Valdemārs; a student at the University of Tartu (then Dorpat) from 1854 to 1858, Valdemārs affixed a carte de visite to his door that read [...] "C. Woldemar <b>stud.</b> <b>cam.</b> Latweetis." [...] At the time, it was almost unheard of for an educated person to call himself a Latvian; education meant Germanisation, and Valdemārs' act has been compared to Martin Luther's posting of the 95 Theses {{to the door of the}} Castle Church in Wittenberg in its importance for Latvian nationalism. Just as some scholars consider the posting of the 95 Theses to be apocryphal, Valdemārs' notice {{can be seen as}} less dramatic if taken in context. The historian Arveds Švābe noted that Valdemārs denied being a radical in his own writings; the New Latvians had no political program threatening the Baltic Germans until the 1860s; according to Švābe, their political opposition to the prevailing order was crystallized under the influence of the Slavophiles in connection to the reforms of Alexander II of Russia.|$|R
