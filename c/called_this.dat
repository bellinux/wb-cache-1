5|$|Continuing {{his earlier}} battle with Stevens, Blaine {{led the fight}} in Congress for a strong dollar. After the {{issuance}} of 150 million dollars in greenbacks—non-gold-backed currency—the {{value of the dollar}} stood at a low ebb. A bipartisan group of inflationists, led by Republican Benjamin F. Butler and Democrat George H. Pendleton, wished to preserve the status quo and allow the Treasury to continue to issue greenbacks and even to use them to pay the interest due on pre-war bonds. Blaine <b>called</b> <b>this</b> idea a repudiation of the nation’s promise to investors, which was made when the only currency was gold. Speaking several times on the matter, Blaine said that the greenbacks had only ever been an emergency measure to avoid bankruptcy during the war. Blaine and his hard money allies were successful, but the issue remained alive until 1879, when all remaining greenbacks were made redeemable in gold by the Specie Payment Resumption Act of 1875.|$|E
5|$|In 1836, Walter Savage Landor, an English {{writer and}} poet, {{published}} Pericles and Aspasia, {{one of his}} most famous books. Pericles and Aspasia is a rendering of classical Athens through a series of imaginary letters, which contain numerous poems. The letters are frequently unfaithful to actual history but attempt to capture the spirit of the Age of Pericles. Robert Hamerling is another novelist and poet who was inspired by Aspasia's personality. In 1876 he published his novel Aspasia, a book about the manners and morals of the Age of Pericles and a work of cultural and historical interest. Giacomo Leopardi, an Italian poet influenced by the movement of romanticism, published a group of five poems known as the circle of Aspasia. These Leopardi poems were inspired by his painful experience of desperate and unrequited love for a woman named Fanny Targioni Tozzetti. Leopardi <b>called</b> <b>this</b> person Aspasia, after the companion of Pericles.|$|E

5|$|In 1848, German anatomist Johann Heinrich Meckel {{recorded}} black-brown pigment granules in {{the blood}} and spleen of a patient {{who had died in}} a mental hospital. Meckel was thought to have been looking at malaria parasites without realizing it; he did not mention malaria in his report. He hypothesized that the pigment was melanin. The causal relationship of pigment to the parasite was established in 1880, when French physician Charles Louis Alphonse Laveran, working in the military hospital of Constantine, Algeria, observed pigmented parasites inside the red blood cells of malaria sufferers. He witnessed the events of exflagellation and became convinced that the moving flagella were parasitic microorganisms. He noted that quinine removed the parasites from the blood. Laveran <b>called</b> <b>this</b> microscopic organism Oscillaria malariae and proposed that malaria was caused by this protozoan. This discovery remained controversial until the development of the oil immersion lens in 1884 and of superior staining methods in 1890–1891.|$|E
5|$|In 1854, a Spanish singing teacher named Manuel García (1805–1906) {{became the}} first man to view the {{functioning}} glottis in a living human. In 1858, French pediatrician Eugène Bouchut (1818–1891) developed a new technique for non-surgical orotracheal intubation to bypass laryngeal obstruction resulting from a diphtheria-related pseudomembrane. In 1880, Scottish surgeon William Macewen (1848–1924) reported on his use of orotracheal intubation as an alternative to tracheotomy to allow a patient with glottic edema to breathe, {{as well as in the}} setting of general anesthesia with chloroform. In 1895, Alfred Kirstein (1863–1922) of Berlin first described direct visualization of the vocal cords, using an esophagoscope he had modified for this purpose; he <b>called</b> <b>this</b> device an autoscope.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, the Finnish {{scientist}} Risto Tuomikoski {{observed that}} the well-known Stropharia aeruginosa had a lookalike species that was characterized by a brown spore print, an indistinct, temporary ring on the stipe, and chrysocystidia lining the gill edges. Tuomikoski <b>called</b> <b>this</b> lookalike Stropharia cyanea, a name he based on James Bolton's 1820 taxon Agaricus cyaneus. Later researchers confirmed the existence and widespread European distribution of this taxon. Tuomikoski's use of the name S.cyanea, however, was incorrect as Bolton's type refers to the purple-brown spored species S.aeruginosa. Despite this, the misapplied name S.cyanea has persisted in some contemporary field guides.|$|E

5|$|In 2002 the {{researchers}} Pelham, Mirenberg, and Jones explored Casler's first explanation, arguing {{that people have}} a basic desire {{to feel good about}} themselves and behave according to that desire. These automatic positive associations would influence feelings about almost anything associated with the self. Given the mere ownership effect, which states that people like things more if they own them, {{the researchers}} theorised that people would develop an affection for objects and concepts that are associated with the self, such as their name. They <b>called</b> <b>this</b> unconscious power implicit egotism. Uri Simonsohn suggested that implicit egotism only applies to cases where people are nearly indifferent between options, and therefore it would not apply to major decisions such as career choices. Low-stakes decisions such as choosing a charity would show an effect. Raymond Smeets theorised that if implicit egotism stems from a positive evaluation of the self, then people with low self-esteem would not gravitate towards choices associated with the self, but possibly away from them. A lab experiment confirmed this.|$|E
5|$|In medieval Germany, a red mineral {{was found}} in the Erzgebirge (Ore Mountains) that resembled copper ore. However, when miners were unable to extract any copper from it, they blamed a mischievous sprite of German mythology, Nickel (similar to Old Nick), for besetting the copper. They <b>called</b> <b>this</b> ore Kupfernickel from the German Kupfer for copper. This ore is now known to be nickeline (aka niccolite), a nickel arsenide. In 1751, Baron Axel Fredrik Cronstedt tried to extract copper from {{kupfernickel}} at a cobalt mine in the Swedish village of Los, and instead produced a white metal that he named after the spirit that had given its name to the mineral, nickel. In modern German, Kupfernickel or Kupfer-Nickel designates the alloy cupronickel.|$|E
5|$|Othnielosaurus is a genus of ornithischian dinosaur {{that lived}} about 155to 148million years ago, during the Late Jurassic-age Morrison Formation {{of the western}} United States. It is {{named in honor of}} famed {{paleontologist}} Othniel Charles Marsh, and was formerly assigned to the genus Laosaurus. This genus was coined to hold fossils formerly included in Othnielia, which is based on remains that may be too sparse to hold a name; as such, it is part of decades of research to untangle the taxonomy left behind by Marsh and his rival Edward Drinker Cope from the Bone Wars. Othnielosaurus has usually been classified as a hypsilophodont, a type of generalized small bipedal herbivore or omnivore, although recent research has <b>called</b> <b>this</b> and the existence of a distinct group of hypsilophodonts into question.|$|E

But others say that Constantine made this raid, asking of the king, Malcolm, that the kingship should be given to him for a week's time, so that he could visit the English. In fact, it was Malcolm who made the raid, but Constantine incited him, as I have said. Woolf suggests that the association of Constantine with the raid is a late addition, one derived from a now-lost saga or poem.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent erosion lasting 300million years {{stripped}} much of {{the exposed}} sediments and the mountains away. This reduced the very high mountains to small hills a few tens to hundreds of feet (tens of meters) high. Geologist John Wesley Powell <b>called</b> <b>this</b> major gap in the geologic record, which is also seen {{in other parts of}} the world, the Great Unconformity. Other sediments may have been added but, if they ever existed, were completely removed by erosion. Such gaps in the geologic record are called unconformities by geologists. The Great Unconformity is one of the best examples of an exposed nonconformity, which is a type of unconformity that has bedded rock units above igneous or metamorphic rocks.|$|E
5|$|The {{distinction}} between {{external and internal}} environments, however, is an abstraction parsing life and environment into units or facts that are inseparable in reality. There is an interpenetration {{of cause and effect}} between the environment and life. The laws of thermodynamics, for example, apply to ecology by means of its physical state. With an understanding of metabolic and thermodynamic principles, a complete accounting of energy and material flow can be traced through an ecosystem. In this way, the environmental and ecological relations are studied through reference to conceptually manageable and isolated material parts. After the effective environmental components are understood through reference to their causes; however, they conceptually link back together as an integrated whole, or holocoenotic system as it was once <b>called.</b> <b>This</b> is known as the dialectical approach to ecology. The dialectical approach examines the parts, but integrates the organism and the environment into a dynamic whole (or umwelt). Change in one ecological or environmental factor can concurrently affect the dynamic state of an entire ecosystem.|$|E
