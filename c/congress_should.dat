5|$|Congress tabled {{the draft}} of the {{declaration}} on Monday, July 1 and resolved itself into a committee of the whole, with Benjamin Harrison of Virginia presiding, and they resumed debate on Lee's resolution of independence. John Dickinson made one last effort to delay the decision, arguing that <b>Congress</b> <b>should</b> not declare independence without first securing a foreign alliance and finalizing the Articles of Confederation. John Adams gave a speech in reply to Dickinson, restating the case for an immediate declaration.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{suggested}} that <b>Congress</b> <b>should</b> charter the National Bank with a capitalization of $10million, one-fifth {{of which would}} be handled by the Government. Since the Government did not have the money, it would borrow the money from the bank itself, and repay the loan in ten even annual installments. The rest was to be available to individual investors. The bank was to be governed by a twenty-five member board of directors that was to represent a large majority of the private shareholders, which Hamilton considered essential for his being under a private direction. Hamilton's bank model had many similarities to that of the Bank of England, except Hamilton wanted to exclude the Government from being involved in public debt, but provide a large, firm, and elastic money supply for the functioning of normal businesses and usual economic development, among other differences. For tax revenue to ignite the bank, it was the same as he had previously proposed; increases on imported spirits: rum, liquor, and whiskey.|$|E

In 1937 in Paris a Central Office (CO) was set up, led by newly appointed Secretary General Arnault Tzanck. Only two years later the CO activities had to be suspended in 1939 because of the Second World War (WW2).|$|R

Blood transfusion was a rather new therapeutic option, and therefore it was decided that transfusion-specific <b>congresses</b> <b>should</b> be organised, to highlight the potential importance of transfusion. To organize these congresses, a society was needed.|$|R

50|$|The 1950 {{congress}} {{provided an}} occasion for workers in the radiology industry to meet {{for the first time}} in over a decade and to discuss the direction future <b>congresses</b> <b>should</b> take. At the 1953 congress, under the guidance of Flemming Norgaard in Copenhagen the International Society of Radiology was set up to oversee the organisation of the International Congresses of Radiology rather than the ad hoc arrangement whereby the organisation of the next congress was left entirely in the hands of the host country. A permanent committee would also provide continuity between congresses. Norgard became the first secretary-general of the Society, while the radiologist from the sponsoring society who had been president of a congress was, by that token, president of the ISR until the next meeting.|$|R

5000|$|William Stearn has {{outlined}} {{the origins of}} ICNCP, tracing {{it back to the}} International Horticultural Congress of Brussels in 1864, when a letter from Alphonse de Candolle to Edouard Morren was tabled. This set out de Candolle's view that Latin names should be reserved for species and varieties found in the wild, with non-Latin or [...] "fancy" [...] names used for garden forms. Karl Koch supported this position at the 1865 International Botanical and Horticultural Congress and at the 1866 International Botanical Congress, where he suggested that future <b>congresses</b> <b>should</b> deal with nomenclatural matters. De Candolle, who had a legal background, drew up the Lois de la Nomenclature botanique (rules of botanical nomenclature). When adopted by the International Botanical Congress of Paris in 1867, this became the first version of today's International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN).|$|R

25|$|Federalist No. 70’s {{arguments}} for an energetic, unitary executive are often {{cited in the}} context of national security. After 9/11, executive power and secrecy took on a more central role in the pursuit of national security. In this regard, members of the post 9/11 United States Department of Justice have argued that foreign policy is most effectively conducted with a single hand, meaning that <b>Congress</b> <b>should</b> defer to the president’s authority.|$|E
25|$|John C. Calhoun {{noted that}} the dry and barren West could not support a {{plantation}} system and would remain without slaves. Calhoun proposed that <b>Congress</b> <b>should</b> not exclude slavery from territories but let each state choose for itself whether it would allow slaves within its borders. After Calhoun's death in 1850, however, South Carolina was left without a leader great enough in national standing and character to prevent action by those more militant South Carolinian factions who wanted to secede immediately. Andrew Pickens Butler argued against Charleston publisher Robert Barnwell Rhett, who advocated immediate secession and, if necessary, independence. Butler won the battle, but Rhett outlived him.|$|E

25|$|The {{founding}} manifesto of the Labour Swaraj Party {{stressed that}} the party was organised {{on the basis of}} class struggle, for the liberation of the masses. The party combined demand for full independence with socio-economic demands. In 1927, the WPP of Bombay presented a programme of action to the All India Congress Committee. The programme proposed struggle for full independence combined with active socio-economic policies for the toiling classes. The WPP of Bengal had submitted a manifesto the Madras Congress session, which sought that the <b>Congress</b> <b>should</b> engage in mass struggles for full independence and that a Constituent Assembly should determine the constitution of an independent India. The party also worked for the abolishment of 'zamindari' system in agriculture.|$|E

During the 1952 steel strike, he played a role as a go-between for the United Steelworkers of America and the Board. President Truman appointed him vice chairman of the Board on May 29, 1952. Aaron was deeply critical of congressional efforts to cut the Board's budget, and declared that <b>Congress</b> <b>should</b> either fully fund the Board's activities or have the courage to legislate the Board out of existence.|$|E

Thus, it is necessary that forthcoming congresses are organized in places like Middle East, South America, China and India amongst others. The pull of Globalization requires the adoption of a more international approach to the holding of conferences.

The highest level of participation was 350 people in Madrid while the greatest numbers of papers (114 papers) were discussed at the Congress of St. Louis and Oxford, USA, in 2004.
