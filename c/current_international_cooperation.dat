40|$|Last November, in The Hague, {{international}} cooperation {{on global warming}} came to a grinding halt. But even if this United Nations conference had been an unqualified success, it would still not have made any difference to the world 2 ̆ 019 s climate. Only a radically different approach to international decision-making can save the world from over-heating. This alternative approach would be less statist and formalistic, and would {{focus more on the}} development of cheap forms of energy and technology that do not emit greenhouse gases. In this essay, it is asserted that the <b>current</b> <b>international</b> <b>cooperation</b> on climate change is doomed to fail, and a more realistic solution is described...|$|E
40|$|The {{cooperation}} between the EU Member States for the recovery of public claims has been gradually strengthened through expanding the subjective scope to new categories of public claims, establishing forms of cooperation, most notably the possibility to recover claims arising in one state by authorities of another state, and establishing separate institutional frameworks of cooperation. The EU legislature placed great emphasis on the most transparent development of relationships between the EU Member States, and thus {{the validity of the}} principle of trust. The article analyses the <b>current</b> <b>international</b> <b>cooperation</b> in the recovery of public claims in view of the principle of mutual trust between the Member States that forms the basis for such cooperation...|$|E

40|$|The vast {{majority}} of people living in developing countries are deeply religious, which suggests that they devote {{a good deal of time}} and money to their church. In Latin America, traditionally a Roman Catholic stronghold, other Christian churches have grown explosively over the last two decades. In Guatemala, as much as a quarter of the population now considers itself Pentecostal, Mormon, Adventist, or Jehovah's Witness. Rich among the Poor explores possible social consequences of these religious changes, by focusing on a group of Mormons and Neo-Pentecostals in a low-income neighborhood of Guatemala City. They are all small-scale entrepreneurs, an important target group in <b>current</b> <b>international</b> <b>cooperation.</b> Following an actor-oriented approach, the study deals with the problems they each encounter while starting a small firm and changing to a new church.

40|$|The {{global warming}} is a {{transnational}} issue by definition that no single country cannot effectively solve by itself. However, it has been ironically proved {{that it has been}} facing enormous difficulty to architect the global cooperative system meeting the challenge because it is transnational issue. This paper employs the concept of multilateralism crafted by John Gerald Ruggie to illustrate the current status of the global warming politics because {{global warming is}} too obviously collective good and cannot be a zero-sum issue. This paper assumes that complete cooperation is ultimately inevitable, but also purports to analyze <b>current</b> <b>international</b> <b>cooperation</b> by using Ruggies concept of multilateralism that has shed lights on nature of cooperation rather than liberal institutionalism emphasizing organizational or norm structures. However, this paper then argues that his argument is still ineffective, and, therefore, this paper also utilizes the concept of minilateralism of Miles Kahler as auxiliary. In so doing, this paper can explain the status of divided multilateralism of global warming from the 1990 s onwards...|$|E
40|$|This article explores how Arctic {{policy is}} {{presented}} in Russian political narratives. This is achieved through the discourse analysis of 109 official documents published within seven-year timeframe (2008 - 2015) on the official website of the Russian President. The article argues that Russian leaders emphasise the state’s geographical location and significant contribution to historical exploration and environmental protection of the region to frame Russia as an ‘Arctic Great Power’ which has natural rights to possess and utilise the Arctic’s abundant resources. The logic of ‘our Arctic, our rules’ can justify any necessary sacrifices, and the assertive policy of the state. However, this discursive representation of the Russian Arctic does not correlate {{with the reality of}} the country’s <b>current</b> interests in <b>international</b> <b>cooperation</b> and its willingness to ‘play by the rules’...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. Presently, U. S. border security endeavors are compartmentalized, fragmented, and poorly coordinated. Moreover, international collaborations are extremely limited; success hinges on effective <b>international</b> <b>cooperation.</b> This thesis addresses U. S. border security management using complexity theory and a systems approach, incorporating both borders and all associated border security institutions simultaneously. Border security research has rarely viewed all stakeholders as a holistic unit {{up to this}} point, nor has border security been thoroughly examined using a systems approach. This research scrutinizes the current U. S. border security paradigm {{in an attempt to}} determine the systemic reasons why the system is ineffective in securing U. S. borders. Additionally, the research investigates the <b>current</b> level of <b>international</b> <b>cooperation</b> between the United States, Canada, and Mexico.

40|$|The {{article will}} provide an {{overview}} of <b>current</b> state of <b>international</b> <b>cooperation</b> in Russian émigré ego-documentary scientific study. The conception of ego-documentary includes memories, memoirs, biographies, autobiographies, letters and diaries, and makes reference to the European philological and historical science in the beginning, and gradually accepted by the Russian scientific community. Theoretical base in studying the memoirs was developed in Soviet era. But practical study of ego-documentary was in suspended status there. It is so often that memoirs, and even biographies and autobiographies were biased on committed political nature. In post-Soviet era the reunion of Russian metropolis and émigré literature happened. Interest in the study and analysis of Russian émigré heritage is increasing year by year. At first instance it was dealt with the recognized Russian émigré literature masters, but then the range of scientific research began to cover the “second level” authors, periodicals (serials) publications, and single work authors. However the shortage of the publications exists. We need in the <b>international</b> <b>cooperation</b> between libraries and scientific centres especially in current digital era. Some examples of the cooperation are successful. It is worth to mention the dissertations, conferences and serials research workflow is increasing last years.

40|$|The {{globalization}} {{of economic activity}} imposes the need for all countries to participate intensely in the <b>current</b> <b>international</b> economic <b>cooperation</b> and exchange processes of goods, services, labor and capital. Greater integration into international economic and trade flows is particularly important for small countries, given that the limitation of resources and insufficient domestic production impose the need for greater imports. On the other hand, import imposes a greater need for more exports so that the growing imports could be financed. Adjusting the challenges of globalization is an important task for all countries {{in order to accomplish}} basic economic goal, and that is the growth of living standards of all citizens. In this sense, in this paper, special attention is paid to the state of foreign trade and the analysis of the effects of FDI on export competitiveness and increase exports of the national economy, {{as one of the most}} important conditions of economic progress in the future. The main objective of this paper is to highlight the importance of the impact of foreign direct investments to strengthen the export activities of the Serbian economy, and the importance of intensification of export activity and qualitative changes in the structure of domestic exports...|$|R

40|$|Against the {{background}} of increased human mobility {{over the last three}} decades, resurgent interest in the migration-development nexus has stimulated new lines of academic inquiry and pushed policy considerations in new directions. This paper outlines current discussions around the links between migration, development and conflict. It also considers the complex nature of 2 ̆ 018 mixed flows 2 ̆ 019, the difficulties in distinguishing between forced/political and voluntary/economic migration, and the links to development from these various 2 ̆ 013 and often overlapping 2 ̆ 013 types of flows.

40|$|The {{field of}} {{competition}} (antitrust) policy embodies {{many of the}} dilemmas {{that are at the}} heart of <b>current</b> debates on <b>international</b> <b>cooperation</b> and inter-jurisdictional competition in economic regulation generally. These dilemmas are illustrated in vivid fashion in the Transatlantic context, in which we see both: (i) the existence and regular use of formal cooperation arrangements for the enforcement of competition law that have been in place for a number of years; and (ii) periodic conflicts that nonetheless arise in the enforcement stances taken by the US and the EC in major transnational antitrust cases, which arguably call for deeper forms of co-operation and coordination. At the same time, calls for substantive harmonization of competition law and enforcement approaches have been widely rejected, in part on the ground that this would deprive citizens of the benefits of inter-jurisdictional competition in the antitrust sphere. The case for a deepening of current cooperation arrangements is considered in this light. The significance of EC-US cooperation and coordination is also considered in its wider global context...|$|R

40|$|This article {{builds on}} {{research}} for a two-year project on nanotechnology regulation in the US and Europe (2008 – 09), which {{was funded by}} the European Commission. We are grateful to our collaborators in this project, at the London School of Economics, Chatham House, Environmental Law Institute and Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies, and especially Linda Breggin, Jay Pendergrass and Read Porter. We also received helpful suggestions from three anonymous reviewers and would like to thank them for their advice. Any remaining errors are our own. Nanosciences and nanotechnologies are set to transform the global industrial landscape, but the debate on how to regulate environmental, health and safety risks is lagging behind technological innovation. Current regulatory efforts are primarily focused on the national and regional level, while the international dimensions of nanotechnology governance are still poorly understood and rarely feature on the international agenda. However, with the ongoing globalization of nanosciences and the rapid expansion of international trade in nanomaterials, demand for international coordination and harmonization of regulatory approaches is set to increase. Yet, uncertainty about nanotechnology risk poses a profound dilemma for regulators and policy-makers. Uncertainty both creates demand for and stands in the way of greater <b>international</b> <b>cooperation</b> and harmonization of regulatory approaches. This article reviews the emerging debate on nanotechnology risk and regulatory approaches, investigates the <b>current</b> state of <b>international</b> <b>cooperation</b> and outlines the critical contribution that a global governance approach can make to the safe development of nanotechnologie...|$|R

However, most models of <b>international</b> <b>cooperation</b> are static and thus cannot explain gradualism. I show that when states can implement domestic reforms {{to reduce the cost}} of <b>international</b> <b>cooperation,</b> enforcement concerns prompt gradualism. First, to achieve ambitious <b>international</b> <b>cooperation,</b> states must internationally enforce costly domestic reform. Second, defection at the reform stage is particularly pernicious. When other states reform, their ability to punish the defector by suspending cooperation is reduced. States choose the extent of reform to maximize the benefits of expected <b>international</b> <b>cooperation</b> in the future. As collective enforcement power increases or the number of states decreases, the extent and pace of reform increase. Gradualism is also most probable in international public good provision because excludable benefits mitigate enforcement problems. enforcement, game theory, gradualism, <b>international</b> <b>cooperation...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} argue for the {{development}} of a global and multi-leveled management of cybersecurity. To do so we ﬁrst deﬁne cybersecurity by situating it within the broader framework of the changing concept of security. To this end we look at the evolution of the security concept, mainly since the end of the Cold War, and its relationship to cybersecurity in today’s global affairs. Then we identify the referent object of security, the importance of cyberthreats, and the need for a multileveled management of cybersecurity and cyberthreats. For such a management to be possible and effective, this paper argues that the development of a security culture of multileveled cybersecurity is necessary. To demonstrate how that could happen policy-wise, we brieﬂy look at the <b>current</b> state of <b>international</b> <b>cooperation</b> on cybersecurity and put forward the idea of a framework of multileveled and global cooperation based on a strategy aiming at developing a global security culture of cybersecurity. Moreover, it is suggested that the development of this security culture should be gradual, based on horizontal and vertical multileveled cooperation, by starting with “low-politics” or non-politically sensitive cybersecurity matters. Such a multileveled framework of cybersecurity, with successful communication lines on and between all levels, may even provide a good platform for cooperation in other domains as well...|$|R

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 30 -November 02, 1989 / Town & Country Hotel & Convention Center, San Diego, CaliforniaDuring the <b>current</b> decade, <b>international</b> <b>cooperation</b> {{in space}} {{projects}} {{has become more}} and more popular and this trend is increasing. Initially, this involved only single missions with agencies flying payloads on other agencies' spacecraft. Later, this trend continued with international ventures, involving different agencies. In the immediate future, even more challenging scenarios are foreseen. The best known example and prime driver for such sophisticated missions will be the Space Station Freedom and its participating partners' spacecraft. Some of the international missions (ESA missions) are described briefly in this paper, in order to set the scene for {{a better understanding of the}} complex needs for standards within advanced orbiting systems. These ventures call for efficient means for cooperation and interoperability. Part of these requirements can be met by following international standards for space communications and space data systems. The Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) undertook the task of integrating the space data systems requirements and developing appropriate recommendations for data systems standards for these Advanced Orbiting Systems (AOS). All international partners in the Space Station Freedom Program participated in the definition, development, and review of the AOS recommendations. The need for better cooperation in space communications via data relay satellite prompted the formation of a three party international panel called the Space Network Interoperability Panel (SNIP). An important aspect is the need for verification and validation of the concept and of the detailed technical recommendations. For the immediate future, special compatibility campaigns, involving the international agencies are planned in order to ensure the smooth application and functioning of the AOS recommendations...|$|R
