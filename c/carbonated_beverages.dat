5|$|Ravalomanana {{solicited}} a {{loan from}} the Agence Française de Développement to further expand his business, but this request was denied, souring his view of France. His subsequent request to the World Bank for 1.5 million US dollars was approved, and in 1982 he founded the Tiko company. The representative of the World Bank to Madagascar at the time, José Broffman, secured the loan with exceptionally favorable reimbursement conditions that enabled Ravalomanana to sell his products {{at a lower cost}} than other small dairy producers, which gradually put his most significant competitors out of business. Broffman later left his post at the World Bank to become a principal investor in the company, joined by private investors from South Africa, Germany and the United States. As Tiko continued to grow, the entrepreneur began incorporating imported ingredients such as powdered milk from South Africa (constituting 80 per cent of the composition of Tiko dairy products) and surplus butter from Europe, further improving the profitability of his business and enabling additional diversification. Tiko Group first concentrated exclusively on the production of dairy products before expanding into fruit juices, ice cream, cooking oil and <b>carbonated</b> <b>beverages.</b> The Tiko slogan printed on many of the group's products, Vita Malagasy ("Made in Madagascar"), reflected Ravalomanana's national pride and his vision that Madagascar should develop a larger capacity to produce quality goods for distribution for national and international markets.|$|E

25|$|Such {{copolymers}} are advantageous {{for certain}} molding applications, such as thermoforming, {{which is used}} for example to make tray or blister packaging from co-PET film, or amorphous PET sheet (A-PET/PETA) or PETG sheet. On the other hand, crystallization is important in other applications where mechanical and dimensional stability are important, such as seat belts. For PET bottles, the use of small amounts of isophthalic acid, CHDM, diethylene glycol (DEG) or other comonomers can be useful: if only small amounts of comonomers are used, crystallization is slowed but not prevented entirely. As a result, bottles are obtainable via stretch blow molding ("SBM"), which are both clear and crystalline enough to be an adequate barrier to aromas and even gases, such as carbon dioxide in <b>carbonated</b> <b>beverages.</b>|$|E
25|$|As {{mentioned}} above, {{the normal}} range of volumes of flatus in normal individuals varies hugely (476–1,491ml/24h). All intestinal gas is either swallowed environmental air, present intrinsically in foods and beverages or the result of gut fermentation. Swallowing small amounts of air occurs while eating and drinking. This is emitted from the mouth by eructation (burping) and is normal. Excessive swallowing of environmental air is called aerophagia, and {{has been shown in}} a few case reports to be responsible for increased flatus volume. This is however considered a rare cause of increased flatus volume. Gases contained in food and beverages is likewise emitted largely through eructation, e.g., <b>carbonated</b> <b>beverages.</b> Endogenously produced intestinal gases make up 74 percent of flatus in normal subjects. The volume of gas produced is partially dependent upon the composition of the intestinal microbiota, which is normally very resistant to change, but is also very different in different individuals. Some patients are predisposed to increased endogenous gas production by virtue of their gut microbiota composition. The greatest concentration of gut bacteria is in the colon, while the small intestine is normally near sterile. Fermentation occurs when unabsorbed food residues may arrive in the colon. Therefore, even more than the composition of the microbiota, diet is the primary factor that dictates the volume of flatus produced. Diets that aim {{to reduce the amount of}} undigested fermentable food residues arriving in the colon have been shown to significantly reduce the volume of flatus produced. Again, it is emphasised that increased volume of intestinal gas will not cause bloating and pain in normal subjects. Abnormal intestinal gas dynamics will create pain, distension, and bloating, regardless of whether there is high or low total flatus volume.|$|E

500|$|New Jersey law prohibits strip {{clubs and}} [...] "sexually {{oriented}} business", where stripteases and erotic dances are regularly performed, from offering both full nudity and alcohol sales. Establishments that possess a retail license and serve alcohol can only offer partially clothed {{services such as}} go-go dancing (typically in bikinis or lingerie). Clubs that are not licensed to serve alcohol will work around the restriction by implementing a bring your own bottle (BYOB) policy and operating as a [...] "juice bar". Juice bars have the appointments of full bars but only serve non-alcoholic beverages such as water, fruit juice, and flavored <b>carbonated</b> <b>beverages.</b> Such a bar could double as a service counter for the storage of BYOB material and offer ice and mixing services to create mixed drinks using the customer-purchased ingredients.

500|$|Fermentation of THB beer {{requires}} approximately {{eight hours}} for each mash of 130 hectoliters. The mash is {{a blend of}} malt (sprouted barley) and corn in an 80/20 ratio to which water and hops are added. [...] The mash is heated in a vat for around two hours to support fermentation. The product is filtered and then heated to 100 degrees Celsius to concentrate and sterilize it. The beer is then decanted and cooled for an hour at 10 degrees Celsius. Finally, a type of mushroom is added as a leavening and fermenting agent; the beer is allowed to ferment for a full week, and excess carbon dioxide produced by the process is collected for the production of soft drinks and other <b>carbonated</b> <b>beverages</b> at the factory. The beer is allowed to rest in vats for several more days before being filtered once more and then bottled and pasteurized at 62 degrees Celsius for three minutes. The automated bottling process yields crates of THB that are ready for shipment to regional wholesale distribution points.|$|E

2500|$|Since {{the water}} {{molecule}} is not linear and the oxygen atom {{has a higher}} electronegativity than hydrogen atoms, it is a polar molecule, with an electrical dipole moment: the oxygen atom carries a slight negative charge, whereas the hydrogen atoms are slightly positive.

[...] Most acids dissolve in water to yield the corresponding anions. [...] Many substances in living organisms, such as proteins, DNA and polysaccharides, are dissolved in water.

2500|$|Supposedly, Pepper hired Wade Morrison in 1874, and Morrison {{worked for}} Pepper {{for a few}} years, leaving in 1880 to travel west. In Texas, Morrison {{obtained}} employment as a pharmacist in Austin and then later in Round Rock. Morrison moved around Texas, ending in Waco. In 1882 he bought John W. Castles's drug store in downtown Waco. In 1885, Morrison employed pharmacist Charles C. Alderton. Alderton, of New York State, went to school in England, gaining knowledge of <b>carbonated</b> <b>beverages.</b> Morrison and Alderton mixed carbonated water, fruit juices, and sugar to produce a soft drink that had an unusual taste. It was eventually called a [...] "Waco" [...] the customers at the drug store would order this drink saying, shoot a Waco. The drink's popularity begat {{the need for an}} official name. During the later part of the nineteenth century it was common practice to name a product with the prefix Dr. to make it sound healthful; E.g., Dr. Davis's Liver Pills, Dr. Bell's Never-Failing Wonder Mixture for Chills and Fevers, Dr. Chandler's Hemlock Plaster, and Dr. Able's Compound Honey of Tar and Lemon. Carbonated drinks were considered healthful, so the Waco drink was given a name that sounded medicinal. Based on this tradition, Morrison labeled the drink Dr. Pepper, taking the name from his previous employer in Virginia.|$|E
