In this episode, SpongeBob and his friends — Patrick, Squidward, Mr. Krabs, and Sandy — are swept away by a giant wave. They get separated from each other; SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward find themselves stranded on a remote tropical island. To get back home to Bikini Bottom, they search for Jack Kahuna Laguna, a surf guru who <b>can</b> <b>teach</b> them the gnarly surf moves to hit the elusive wave, The Big One, in order to return home.|$|E
5|$|After Baby {{discovers that}} Johnny's dance partner, Penny Johnson (Cynthia Rhodes), is {{pregnant}} by Robbie Gould (Max Cantor), a womanizing waiter {{who is also}} dating and cheating on Baby's older sister, Lisa (Jane Brucker) and several other female guests, she borrows money from her father {{to pay for an}} illegal abortion for Penny. Jake agrees to give the money to Baby even though she says she can't tell him what it's for. Penny eventually accepts the money, but says there is another issue. Johnny and Penny perform a weekly dance at the Sheldrake, another nearby resort. Penny will miss her performance if she goes for the abortion, and they will forfeit their salary for the season. Billy suggests that Baby fill in for her. Johnny scoffs at this, which overcomes Baby's initial resistance. Billy and Penny insist that Johnny <b>can</b> <b>teach</b> anyone to dance. Johnny begins to teach Baby the mambo, and the two spend several awkward practice sessions together. Baby gradually begins to improve, and a romantic attraction grows between them.|$|E
5|$|A {{cancerous}} patient, Marina Wagner (Amanda Collins), {{is admitted}} {{into the hospital}} and is revealed to have toxic blood - presumably caused by a chemical reaction between an herbal supplement and chemotherapy - making several physicians fall ill. O'Malley is exposed to the neurotoxin, and quickly becomes anxious, fearing that his marriage is the cause of the sickness. Ellis is diagnosed with a heart condition, in which surgery or medication are options. Ellis does not want the surgery, but Meredith fears that she will not be compliant with her medication. Shepherd and Burke try to close up Wagner as the OR was evacuated before her surgery was completed, by entering the operating room with sealed, airtight suits. Ellis agrees to the surgery, but opts to speak with Webber, her former lover. A teenage patient is brought into the clinic by her father, hoping that a doctor <b>can</b> <b>teach</b> her how to use tampons. When her father leaves the room, she explains to Bailey that she had sex, but her pregnancy test is negative. Shepherd and Burke run out of air whilst operating on Wagner, so Yang, Stevens, and Meredith enter holding their breath to close the patient's incision. O'Malley's colleagues act in a rude manner to his new marriage, and displeased, he lectures them, standing up for Torres. Sloan is seen to be having sex with Montgomery, and Yang agrees to marry Burke. At the conclusion of the episode, Ellis' lucidity has vanished, leaving Meredith and Webber distraught.|$|E
40|$|Teaching {{case studies}} are widely {{deployed}} in business schools. They are contextually rich in detail, and students learn by applying and adapting theoretical concepts to specific business situations {{described in the}} case. This article proposes {{a new way to}} use teaching case studies, as research materials for academics.

(2) When <b>can</b> <b>teaching</b> case studies be used as secondary data? and (3) How <b>can</b> <b>teaching</b> case studies be used as secondary data?

On Sundays, the blacksmith, a single father {{after the death of his}} wife, takes his children to church, where his daughter sings in the choir.

25|$|Because {{they are}} easy to keep and breed, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and the {{nematode}} Caenorhabditis elegans have long been the most intensively studied metazoan model organisms, and were among the first life-forms to be genetically sequenced. This was facilitated by the severely reduced state of their genomes, but as many genes, introns, and linkages lost, these ecdysozoans <b>can</b> <b>teach</b> us little about the origins of animals in general. The extent of this type of evolution within the superphylum will be revealed by the crustacean, annelid, and molluscan genome projects currently in progress. Analysis of the starlet sea anemone genome has emphasized the importance of sponges, placozoans, and choanoflagellates, also being sequenced, in explaining the arrival of 1500 ancestral genes unique to the Eumetazoa. An analysis of the homoscleromorph sponge Oscarella carmela also suggests that the last common ancestor of sponges and the eumetazoan animals was more complex than previously assumed. Other model organisms belonging to the animal kingdom include the house mouse (Mus musculus), laboratory rat (Rattus norvegicus) and zebrafish (Danio rerio).|$|E

She feels apprehensive and hesitant about facing Ciaran, but at the same time, has a strange urge to hug him since she has finally found her true father. She refuses to hug the same man that killed her mother Maeve Riordan and Angus, her lover, however. Near the end of the book, she shape shifts into a wolf, with Ciaran, and learns his true name, which can control him.

25|$|Two years {{previous}} to {{the present}} day events, a rider arrives to the Witch's Hut from Brave, and demands to show themselves and asks for magic. The person, King Fergus, is met by a witch who asks what he wants and he says he needs something to ensure the future of his kingdom and says he will pay the price. She says he can pay her later and calls it an IOU and offers him a contract to sign and he stamps it with his signet ring. She says it’s a deal and she blends up a potion using a pluck of his hair. Later on, Fergus and Merida walking among the clans. Fergus says he’ll take the tongue of the next man who disrespects her. She sees the men writing and thinks they’re sending love notes but Fergus says they’re writing their last will and testaments. Fergus also gave Merida his prized bow that she can carry into her first battle, and Merida thanked her father for keeping her safe. Merida pulls a sword and challenges the man who knocks her down, but the person who defeated her was Mulan, who says she <b>can</b> <b>teach</b> her how to fight better than any man there and will teach her honor as well. Some of the men watching mock her and call Mulan her nursemaid, but tells her no one will follow her out of fear and says to ask her father since they already follow him. Later that day, Merida came looking for him by the water. He says the invaders are sailing in and he’s watching for them. She asks if they will win the war and then says she wants to know how he inspired all these men to follow him into battle. He looks at the helm and she asks if everything is all right. Fergus says you have to show you’re the first one willing to die and says that tells them how important it is. He tells her he’s the Bear King and can face anything. She sees her father with the helm and discovers that Mulan had kept Merida from going with him. When she arrived and sees a knight coming towards Fergus, Merida aims an arrow at the knight, but misses as the knight kills Fergus.
