5|$|The {{intersection}} of 7th Street NW and H Street NW {{is the heart}} of D.C.'s Chinatown neighborhood today, but prior to the 1930s it was populated primarily by German immigrants. Before the American Civil War, 7th Street NW was the city's primary commercial district, the street lined with three-story Federal-style townhouses with shops on the ground floor and residences above. Lincoln conspirator Mary Surratt's boarding house (604 H Street NW) has been substantially renovated through the years (and currently houses a Chinese restaurant), but it may also house Mary Surratt's ghost. From the 1870s onward, occupants of the building have claimed that Surratt's spirit is responsible for the incomprehensible mumbling and whispers, footsteps, muffled sobs, and <b>creaking</b> floorboards which have unnerved them.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from its}} greater size, the common raven differs from its cousins, the crows, {{by having a}} larger and heavier black beak, shaggy {{feathers}} around the throat and above the beak, and a wedge-shaped tail. Flying ravens are distinguished from crows by their tail shape, larger wing area, and more stable soaring style, which generally involves less wing flapping. Despite their bulk, ravens are easily as agile in flight as their smaller cousins. In flight the feathers produce a <b>creaking</b> sound that has been likened to the rustle of silk. The voice of ravens is also quite distinct, its usual call being a deep croak of a much more sonorous quality than a crow's call. In North America, the Chihuahuan raven (C. cryptoleucus) is fairly similar to the relatively small common ravens of the American southwest and is best distinguished by the still relatively smaller size of its bill, beard and body and relatively longer tail. All-black carrion crow (C. corone) in Europe may suggest a raven due to their largish bill but are still distinctly smaller and have the wing and tail shapes typical of crows.|$|E

On the ramparts above the wreck strewn harbour, on the Barracca, St Angelo and Senglea, great crowds of Maltese {{men and women}} waved and cheered and a brass band {{on the end of}} the mole was giving a {{spirited}} rendition of Rule Britannia. Captain Mason, however, standing at the salute on the battered bridge of Ohio, could spare not a moment's thought for the pride of bringing the ship to harbour, since the <b>creaking</b> plates showed that Ohio might still go to the bottom of the Grand Harbour.|$|E
25|$|This {{produces}} a joint {{which is much}} stronger than a butt joint without reinforcement. The dowels offer some holding strength even after the glue has deteriorated. Over time, dowels may shrink and become loose. They take on an oval shape in section owing to the different rate at which wood moves with different orientations of the grain. Loose dowels allow the joint to flex, although it may not fall apart. This phenomenon is evident in <b>creaking</b> chairs and wobbling book cases. For this reason, dowel joints are not preferred for high-quality furniture.|$|E
40|$|<b>Creak,</b> also {{referred}} to as vocal fry or glottal fry, is a perceptually distinctive vocal occurrence that is frequently produced in running speech. The presence of <b>creak</b> causes problems in speech processing particularly with f 0 and spectral analysis. However, as <b>creak</b> frequently occurs in natural spoken communication and as it often carries important segmental and paralinguistic information we believe that applying appropriate processing methods for the study of <b>creak</b> in spontaneous conversation is warranted. This preliminary study demonstrates trends in the use of <b>creak</b> by 9 Hungarian speakers talking in both formal and informal settings. Creaky segments are identified and the distributions of these segments were examined in relation to frequency of occurrence in formal versus informal settings. The study shows trends of increased frequency of <b>creak</b> in informal settings and an apparent convergence in speaking style {{on the part of the}} interviewer with interviewees who produced <b>creak</b> frequently...|$|R

In 1860 she and her sister visited their maternal grandmother in Tiflis. It was there that she met up with Metrovitch, and where she reconciled with Nikifor in 1862. Together they adopted a child named Yuri, who would die aged five in 1867, when he was buried under Metrovitch's surname.|$|E
25|$|To gratify {{her passion}} for antique and Neoclassical art, Catherine {{employed}} the Scottish architect Charles Cameron, who not only refurbished the interior of one wing in the Neo-Palladian style then in vogue, but also constructed the personal apartments of the Empress, a rather modest Greek Revival structure known as the Agate Rooms and situated {{to the left of}} the grand palace. Noted for their elaborate jasper decor, the rooms were designed so as to be connected to the Hanging Gardens, the Cold Baths, and the Cameron Gallery (still housing a collection of bronze statuary)—three Neoclassical edifices constructed to Cameron's designs. According to Catherine's wishes, many remarkable structures were erected for her amusement in the Catherine Park. These include the Dutch Admiralty, <b>Creaking</b> Pagoda, Chesme Column, Rumyantsev Obelisk, and Marble Bridge.|$|E
25|$|Philip III's {{approach}} to government {{appears to have}} stemmed from three main drivers. Firstly, he was heavily influenced by the eirenic ideas being circulated in Italian circles {{in reaction to the}} new Humanist theories of governance, typified by Machiavelli. Writers such as Girolamo Frachetta, who became a particular favourite of Philip, had propagated a conservative definition of 'reason of state' which centred on exercising a princely prudence and a strict obedience to the laws and customs of the country that one ruled. Secondly, Philip may have shared Lerma's view that the governmental system of Philip II was fast proving impractical and unnecessarily excluded the great nobles of the kingdoms – it had been <b>creaking</b> badly in the last decades of his father's life. Lastly, Philip's own personality and his friendship with Lerma heavily shaped his {{approach to}} policy-making. The result was a radical shift {{in the role of the}} crown in government from the model of Philip II.|$|E

40|$|During {{foraging}} dives, {{sperm whales}} (Physeter macrocephalus) produce {{long series of}} regular clicks at 0. 5 - 2 s intervals interspersed with rapid-click buzzes called "creaks". Sound, depth and orientation recording Dtags were attached to 23 whales in the Ligurian Sea and Gulf of Mexico to test whether the behaviour of diving sperm whales supports the hypothesis that <b>creaks</b> are produced during prey capture. Sperm whales {{spent most of their}} bottom time within one or two depth bands, apparently feeding in vertically stratified prey layers. <b>Creak</b> rates were highest during the bottom phase: 99. 8 % of <b>creaks</b> were produced in the deepest 50 % of dives, 57 % in the deepest 15 % of dives. Whales swam actively during the bottom phase, producing a mean of 12. 5 depth inflections per dive. A mean of 32 % of <b>creaks</b> produced during the bottom phase occurred within 10 s of an inflection (13 x more than chance). Sperm whales actively altered their body orientation throughout the bottom phase with significantly increased rates of change during <b>creaks,</b> reflecting increased manoeuvring. Sperm whales increased their bottom foraging time when <b>creak</b> rates were higher. These results all strongly support the hypothesis that <b>creaks</b> are an echolocation signal adapted for foraging, analogous to terminal buzzes in taxonomically diverse echolocating species...|$|R

40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to {{investigate}} the use of <b>creak</b> in relation to prosodic constituents. <b>Creak</b> is a phonation type (Laver, 1980) that is easily perceived by listeners (Blomgren et al, 1998). Para linguistically, <b>creak</b> signifies mood, emotions and attitude (Gobl and Ní Chasaide, 2003), extra linguistically, it is a social identifier (Wolk et al, 2012; Stuart-Smith, 1999). Linguistically it is phonemic in some languages (Gordon and Ladefoged, 2001) but also manifests at points of prosodic significance such as utterancefinal position (Redi and Shattuck Hufnagel, 2001). In addition to this, <b>creak</b> may indicate unhealthy vocal habits or an early-stage voice problem (Colton et al, 2011; Mathieson, 2001). The rationale for the study, therefore, was to provide normative information regarding the occurrence of this complex set of phenomena, which may be of use in the decision-making process of speech and language therapists. A pre-existing corpus of 15 female, south-east English speakers was prosodically annotated using the ToBI framework (Beckman and Ayers Elam, 1997; Silverman et al, 1992; Beckman and Pierrehumbert, 1986). The data comprised a reading passage of approximately one minute in length. The speakers were between the ages of 19 and 38 years; English was their native language. Tonal categories were established, based on the tones perceived in each word, its divisibility within the speech signal, and their overall frequency. The data were perceptually analysed for <b>creak.</b> The main findings suggest that <b>creak</b> occurs most often in tonal categories containing boundary tones, particularly when low, and in phrase-initial position. A wide range of speaker variation was also attested in the data. Findings support current literature suggesting that <b>creak</b> occurs in a non random distribution...|$|R
