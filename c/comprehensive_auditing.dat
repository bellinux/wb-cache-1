The proxies are identified and authorized with their recognizable identities, which eliminates complicated certificate management in usual secure distributed computing systems. Second, our IBDO scheme facilitates <b>comprehensive</b> <b>auditing,</b> i. e., our scheme not only permits regular integrity auditing as in existing schemes for securing outsourced data, but also allows to audit the information on data origin, type, and consistence of outsourced files. Security analysis and experimental evaluation indicate that our IBDO scheme provides strong security with desirable efficiency...|$|E
40|$|Trustworthy {{elections}} require <b>comprehensive</b> <b>auditing</b> and {{corrective action}} to eliminate major errors in counting votes. In this paper, we address just {{one component of}} electoral audits: specifying how many randomly selected precincts should undergo hand recounts {{to decide whether the}} winner in the electronic tally should be confirmed. Several pending electoral-integrity bills specify hand audits of between 2 and 10 % of all precincts. However, percentage-based audits are usually inefficient, because they use large samples for large jurisdictions, even though the sample needed to achieve good accuracy is much more affected by the closeness of the race than the size of the population. Percentage-based audits can also be ineffective, since close races may require auditing a large fraction of the total – even a 100 % hand recount – to provide confidence in the outcome. This paper presents the SAFE (Statistically Accurate, Fair and Efficient) alternative to percentage-based sampling, based on the same statistical principles that inform audits in business and finance. In recent federal elections, highly reliable SAFE audits would have required about the same total effort and resources as the percentage-based audits now being considered. However, SAFE audits can ensure equally high confidence in all electoral outcomes by using auditing resources more efficiently and employing large samples only when necessary...|$|E

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) provides more frequent monitoring and more consistent guidance for its federal enforcement activities than for state enforcement activities. More specifically, OSHA regional officials review performance reports on federal activities at least every other week but review reports on state-run program activities quarterly. In addition, OSHA's guidance for audits of its regional and area offices is more consistent than the guidance for its audits of state-run programs. Guidance for audits of its offices requires that regional offices conduct a <b>comprehensive</b> <b>audit</b> with on-site review of inspection case files at least once every 4 years and other audits focused on more specific activities in all other years. In contrast, guidance for regional office audits of state-run programs changes {{from year to year}} and does not include a regular schedule for <b>comprehensive</b> <b>audits</b> with on-site case file reviews. While the frequency of OSHA's monitoring of state-run programs is necessarily different because of the independent enforcement authority of participating states, OSHA's lack of consistent guidance for audits of these state-run programs may allow enforcement deficiencies to go undetected, increasing the risk of worker injuries, illnesses, or death. In addition, there is little participation by OSHA's national office in <b>comprehensive</b> <b>audits</b> of its regional offices despite a 2010 directive to do so.

30|$|Vancouver et al. (2001) found {{a strong}} {{correlation}} between self-efficacy and performance at the personal level of analysis. The strong positive relationship is the result of past performances influence on self-efficacy as described by Bandura (1986). Hoy and Miskel (2001) believed that the past work performance has {{a significant impact on the}} individual’s self-efficacy. The continuous success would definitely enhance individuals’ self-efficacy whereas the constant failures would create personal doubt and reduce personal self-efficacy. Since auditors accumulate knowledge and experience from clients to make professional judgments, auditing experience and professionalization can influence professional awareness. Professional judgment determines auditing procedures, and professionalization provides an advantage in client disputes. Nelson (2009) stated that a knowledgeable auditor can identify errors and process complex evidence. Moriarity (1979) found better performance by experienced auditors at bankruptcy prediction, which reflected superior ability of experienced auditors at auditing tasks. Cervone et al. (1991) observed that individuals with high self-efficacy learn more from feedback, respond more adaptively to decision environment, and overtime, are better able to translate their learning into performance. Therefore, to successfully resolve a challenge and complete an auditing task, the problem solver must draw upon experience, knowledge, and cognitive abilities. As specific knowledge is accumulated and more auditing skills are being developed, auditors become more likely to produce professional and <b>comprehensive</b> <b>auditing</b> reports.|$|E

People with high self-efficacy are more confident in their intellectual ability to allocate resources, control situations, and make critical decisions. Similarly, Cervone et al.

40|$|Introduction: Medical case {{notes are}} the only lasting {{interpretation}} of a patient-physician interaction and are important for good quality patient care. Accurate, legible and contemporaneous note-keeping is important however it can be substandard. This can lead to errors in handover of patients and to medicolegal vulnerability. We present a <b>comprehensive</b> <b>auditing</b> tool for Trauma & Orthopaedics medical case notes and our experience in using it over the last 12 months. 				 					Patients and Methods: The TONK score was developed from a pre-existing system with some additions for Trauma & Orthopaedic case notes, with the incorporation of a legibility scoring system. An initial audit was carried out evaluating the case notes for each team against the TONK score. In order to evaluate the reproducibility of this score, we employed the Cohen’s Kappa coefficient and noted substantial agreement. The individual team scores were analysed and the audit cycle completed four months later with the provision of feedback. 				 					Results: Our first audit revealed a mean of 81 with a range from 70 to 90. Subsequent audits {{over the next two}} quarters revealed mean scores in excess of 90. Significant improvement has been noted in all areas of documentation and it has been decided to conduct this audit every six months in our department. 				 					Conclusions: The TONK score is an easy, quick and reproducible tool, which aims to eliminate the weaknesses in Trauma & Orthopaedic medical note-keeping. It emphasises the medicolegal importance of accurate medical note-keeping to doctors at all levels of training...|$|E

40|$|In {{an effort}} to assure and move beyond {{regulatory}} compliance, Rochester Institute of Technology has begun implementing an environmental management system (EMS) through the RIT Strategic Environmental Management Initiative. As part of this initiative, RIT is considering implementing a <b>comprehensive</b> <b>auditing</b> program to evaluate environmental compliance and management system performance. This thesis evaluates current environmental internal audit program design and implementation practices at other colleges and universities, and compares those to standard environmental audit program implementation and design in the industrial regulated community. The thesis evaluates compliance auditing programs at seven colleges and universities of varying sizes, and environmental management system auditing programs at one ISO 14001 -registered university. From this evaluation and comparison, an audit program design strategy recommendation is offered for RIT. It {{was found that the}} elements being implemented in the university setting closely mirror those recommended by industrially focused literature sources for industrial entities. At this point, these elements are effectively helping colleges and universities manage their environmental issues and ensure compliance, however, it is still too early in the process to evaluate the long-term effectiveness of the industrially focused design and implementation elements being applied in the university setting. As these programs mature, colleges and universities may uncover better ways to organize and manage their audit programs than what is typically recommended for industry. RIT, as it undertakes the task of designing and implementing its internal auditing program, should find mechanisms to keep up with what practices other colleges and universities are implementing to make their internal auditing programs effective. As new design and implementation information becomes available, RIT may decide not to use the recommendations made in this thesis. In the meantime, however, RIT may use these recommendations {{as a starting point for}} its internal auditing program, and can later build upon them to reach its environmental performance goals...|$|E
