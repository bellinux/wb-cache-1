40|$|ABSTRACT: Expression of the PSR 132 protein from Dianthus caryophyllus (<b>carnation,</b> <b>clover</b> pink) is induced in {{response}} to ethylene production associated with petal senescence, and thus the protein is named petal death protein (PDP). Recent work has established that despite the annotation of PDP in sequence databases as carboxyphosphoenolpyruvate mutase, the enzyme is actually a C-C bond cleaving lyase exhibiting a broad substrate profile. The crystal structure of PDP has been determined at 2. 7 Å resolution, revealing a dimer-of-dimers oligomeric association. Consistent with sequence homology, the overall R/â barrel fold of PDP {{is the same as}} that of other isocitrate lyase/PEP mutase superfamily members, including a swapped eighth helix within a dimer. Moreover, Mg 2 + binds in the active site of PDP with a coordination pattern similar to that seen in other superfamily members. A compound, covalently bound to the catalytic residue, Cys 144, was interpreted as a thiohemiacetal adduct resulting from the reaction of glutaraldehyde used to cross-link the crystals. The Cys 144 -carrying flexible loop that gates access to the active site is in the closed conformation. Models of bound substrates and comparison with the closed conformation of isocitrate lyase and 2 -methylisocitrate lyase revealed the structural basis for the broad substrate profile of PDP. The glyoxylate cycle was discovered in bacteria (1) as...|$|E
