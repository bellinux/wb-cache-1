5|$|These {{improvements}} would <b>cost</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of money, however, and this, {{in combination}} with the players' ever-increasing wages, sent the club into a period of financial turmoil. The club was presented with a winding up order in January 1902, and Bank Street was on the brink of being repossessed until they were saved at the eleventh hour by a wealthy local brewer, John Henry Davies. He and four other men, among them club captain Harry Stafford, invested a total of £2,000 in the club, now renamed Manchester United F.C., and Davies himself paid £500 for the erection of a new 1,000-seat stand at Bank Street. Within four years, the stadium had cover on all four sides, as well as the ability to hold approximately 50,000 spectators, some of whom could watch from the viewing gallery atop the Main Stand. The stadium was even deemed worthy enough to host a match between Football League and Scottish Football League representative sides in April 1904, hosting 25,000 spectators as the Football League side won 2–1.|$|E

25|$|At $2 {{trillion}} per year, the U.S. {{health-care system}} suffers much more from inefficiency than lack of funds. The system wastes money on administration, unnecessary tests and marginal medicines that <b>cost</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> for little health benefit. It also provides strong {{financial incentives to}} preserve such inefficiency.|$|E
25|$|The first {{recovery}} boilers had horizontal evaporator surfaces, {{followed by}} superheaters and more evaporation surfaces. These boilers resembled the state-of-the-art boilers of some 30 years earlier. This trend has continued until today.

25|$|On June 9, 1965, {{the brand}} new {{extension}} of the Northern State would be opened to traffic, moving the eastern terminus to {{just north of the}} then-new Suffolk County headquarters and police headquarters. The project cost $4million and removed the automatic turns to the Sunken Meadow and Sagtikos. Also the LISPC announced the widening at the western end would start later in the year. On November 28, 1965, the LISPC announced widening of the congested sections of both the Grand Central and Northern State between the I-295 (the Clearview Expressway) and Old Westbury. While federal funding helped paid the Grand Central portion of the $20million project, the $11.5million for the Northern State came out of the New York State budget. The project would not cost any homes to be taken down, but would <b>cost</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of trees to be taken down along the roadway. The project would also reconstruct the interchange of the Clearview, Grand Central and Hillside Avenue for a future extension of the Clearview to the Nassau Expressway. Robert Moses announced that the project would begin in Spring 1966.|$|E

500|$|Mancuso asked Leonard Nimoy to {{conceive}} {{the new film}} {{to serve as a}} swan song for the original cast. Nimoy, Mark Rosenthal and Lawrence Konner suggested Kirk meeting Jean-Luc Picard, but s producers refused to end their show. Nicholas Meyer, who directed [...] and co-wrote [...] was also approached for an idea for the sixth film, but had none. Ralph Winter was brought on to the project as producer shortly after Bennett's departure, and said Paramount's mandate was to produce a 25th anniversary film that would not <b>cost</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of money.|$|E
500|$|Final Nintendo 64 {{specifications}} {{and development}} workstations were not initially available to Rare: a modified Sega Saturn controller {{was used for}} some early playtesting, and the developers had to estimate what the finalised console's capabilities would be. The final Nintendo 64 hardware could render polygons faster than the SGI Onyx workstations they had been using, but the game's textures had to be cut down by half. Karl Hilton explained one method of improving the game's performance: [...] "A lot of GoldenEye is in black and white. RGB colour textures <b>cost</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> {{more in terms of}} processing power. You could do double the resolution if you used greyscale, so a lot was done like that. If I needed a bit of colour, I'd add it in the vertex." [...] At one time, developers planned to implement the reloading of the weapons by the player unplugging and re-inserting the Rumble Pak on the Nintendo 64 controller, though this idea was discarded at Nintendo's behest.|$|E
500|$|Fowler's next Liverpool goal, against West Bromwich Albion, {{meant he}} overtook Kenny Dalglish in the club's all-time top scorers. His {{resurgence}} continued as he marked his 31st birthday {{with a goal}} against Bolton Wanderers. He made it four goals in five games when he scored the only goal in a 1–0 victory over Blackburn Rovers on 16 April 2006. However, Fowler's fitness remained a concern. In March 2006, manager Rafael Benítez commented on Fowler's work and progress by saying, [...] "to buy a Robbie Fowler who is fit and scoring goals would <b>cost</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot,</b> maybe £10m or more". Despite concerns about his fitness, Fowler finished the 2005–06 season scoring on a more consistent basis than Liverpool's other strikers. In May 2006 he was offered a new one-year contract with the club, and celebrated by scoring the first goal in Liverpool's last league {{game of the season}} in a 3–1 away win at Portsmouth. It was his final game of the season as he was unable {{to take part in the}} club's FA Cup Final success due to being cup-tied.|$|E
50|$|Developers {{no longer}} need to remove the entire test {{database}} {{in order to create a}} new test database from scratch (e.g. using schema creation scripts from DDL generation tools).

5000|$|Attention {{naturally}} focussed {{on where}} the outstanding money had gone. Quoted in Scotland on Sunday, Bill Cleghorn, a forensic accountant appointed by the court, said: [...] "There’s nothing we have come across yet that would indicate there’s anything criminal.

500|$|It was {{not until}} mid-1799 that Southey was able to finish {{composing}} Madoc, and soon after began to work on Thalaba. Afterwards he travelled to Portugal, where he continued to work on Madoc for two more years to polish up the language. After Portugal went to war with France and Spain, Southey returned to England. While there, he travelled to Wales {{to get more information}} for his epic. He continued to travel in 1801, and worked on the epic during this time. In May 1804, Southey took the beginning of the poem to the publisher Longman, and he began to finish the second section in October. It was finished and published in two parts early in 1805, with footnotes and a preface explaining Southey's purpose. The work <b>cost</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of money to publish, which prompted Southey to write [...] "By its high price, one half the edition is condemned to be furniture in expensive libraries, and the other to collect cobwebs in the publisher's warehouses. I foresee that I shall get no solid pudding by it".|$|E
2500|$|ELP's {{record deal}} {{provided}} funds for Emerson {{to buy his}} own Moog modular synthesizer.

There were all these leads and stuff, there was no instruction manual." [...] The patch which had been provided by Mike Vickers produced six distinctive Moog sounds, and these six became the foundation of ELP's sound.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{example is}} that a person may {{illegally}} register their car to a location that would net them cheaper insurance rates than where they actually live, sometimes called [...] "rate evasion". For example, some drivers in Brooklyn drive with Pennsylvania license plates because registering their car in a rural part of Pennsylvania will <b>cost</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> less than registering it in Brooklyn. Another form of automobile insurance fraud, known as [...] "fronting," [...] involves registering someone other than the real primary driver of a car as the primary driver of the car. For example, parents might list themselves as the primary driver of their children's vehicles to avoid young driver premiums.|$|E

30|$|The {{drill and}} blast method is widely adopted in tunnel {{construction}} of high-speed railways. Therefore, improving {{the air quality}} in tunnels is critical to keeping a good working environment in tunnels, especially for a long tunnel with a high gas content.

5000|$|Toward {{the end of}} this time, Bickford {{wanted to}} move up from Quarter Midgets to Bandolero cars, but needed to raise money to {{purchase}} the necessary equipment. In order to raise sufficient funds, he held a fundraiser called the [...] "KGA" [...] (Kids Golf Association) at age eleven. Tom Bickford noted, “It <b>costs</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of money making the step from little cars to big cars. But he definitely has the desire race”.|$|R
2500|$|Between Sterling and Park Places, the Shuttle {{makes its}} upward journey on a ramp that was opened in 1896, {{and that had}} {{connected}} the original line to the old Fulton Street Elevated. Because it would <b>cost</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> to construct a tunnel or open cut, the elevated was rebuilt along its old right-of-way. When the grade crossing was eliminated in 1905, Park Place was depressed to allow traffic to continue uninterrupted. As a result, the roadbed is as much as three feet under the sidewalk, so steps and railings were built to allow entrance and exit to the roadbed. The line then crosses a new bridge over Park Place.|$|E
2500|$|Mobutu {{also was}} {{one of the men who}} was {{instrumental}} in bringing the Rumble in the Jungle boxing match between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman to Zaire on 30 October 1974. According to the documentary When We Were Kings, promoter Don King promised each fighter US$5million for the fight. Mobutu was the only one who was willing to fund such amounts. Mobutu, wanting to expand his country's image, put up the nation's money to do so. According to a quote in the film, Ali supposedly said: [...] "Some countries go to war to get their names out there, and wars <b>cost</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> more than $10 million." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Magical Girl Mii" [...] {{was used}} in the anime, though its origins were changed. In the anime it was a {{specialized}} cosplay costume she had created to mimic a magical girl television show which <b>cost</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of money, but Ai seemed easily able to pay for it. That episode she met a chronically ill girl named Miyuki and attempted to cheer up. After this, she wears it around and pretends to help stop evil and believes she has superpowers. Later during the episode, Miyuki collapsed from overexertion playing with Mii. Mii tried to use powers she thought she had to heal her. The attempt was successful, and Ai revealed to the viewers that Mii's special power was healing. However, Mii remains unaware of this for {{a good portion of the}} season, and continues to believe that she has other powers as well. After the episode, Mii continues to cosplay in the outfit with the same type of antics. Mii is voiced by Toromi in the visual novel; in the anime she is voiced in Japanese by Momoi Haruko and in English by Jocelyne Loewen.|$|E
30|$|There are {{numerous}} ways to clean a surface: from abrasive techniques like sandblasting to laser cleaning and water spraying. Some {{of the factors}} of conventional methods shall be mentioned: Possible damage caused by aggressive cleaning methods that may roughen the surface and the surface is more susceptible to new smudging in the future; as cleaning is an intensive work, therefore <b>costs</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> for labor work; massive use of chemicals in cleaning will cause environmental problems.|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} MIDMRA, communication efficiency simulation analysis is utilized. As introduced previously, {{there are few}} related works on this problem, especially without priori route information. Thus, the disjoint routing mechanism in [9] is selected to compare with MIDMRA, which {{is represented by the}} Closeness mechanism in this paper. Because the closeness mechanism needs priori routing information, an all-path routing algorithm is added before comparison, which <b>costs</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of time and lengthens simulation period enormously.|$|R
50|$|The FEMP ESPC program {{costs about}} $10 million {{annually}} to administer {{and an additional}} $1 million annually to monitor contract performamce. On average, FEMP spends about $500,000 to develop each contract, essentially providing a very generous boost to the ESCOs for project development. Additionally, with interest charges over as many as 25 years per contract, the projects are actually <b>costing</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> more than if Congress would just appropriate funding for them rather than financing them {{over long periods of}} time.|$|R
