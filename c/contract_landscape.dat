40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyse land {{allocation}} between competing agri-environmental contracts taking into account institutional issues and farm household and farm characteristics. We consider a Biodiversity Protection <b>Contract,</b> <b>Landscape</b> Management Contract and a Restriction on Intensive Practises Contract. The paper shows that it is important to study the choice for an agrienvironmental contract in combination with the choice for other agri-environmental contracts. The reasons being that a unit of land can only be allocated to one contract (although a farm can select more than one contract) and perceived relative marginal costs of contracts can change if institutional settings and farm household and farm characteristics alter. The model uses a two stage method. In the first step the probability of contract choice is determined. In the second stage these probabilities are linked to ex ante costs (including transaction costs) and optimal contract choice is determined.

40|$|Landscape {{and related}} {{environmental}} works are discussed {{as an integral}} and essential aspect of most land development projects, whether they are building or civil works, environmental protection, rehabilitation or landscape beautification. Problematic contractual issues that regularly arise in landscape contracting {{from the use of}} standard forms of construction contracts for pre-main contract, in-main contract and post-main <b>contract</b> <b>landscape</b> work are identified and discussed. These forms of contracts have essentially been written for traditional building and engineering works and are shown to be inadequately addressing the unique contractual aspects relating to landscaping works. The study focuses on the issues to be addressed in a contract between an employer and a landscape contractor for work to be undertaken before the main construction contractor has been appointed and on landscape subcontract work undertaken during the construction under the main contract. It addresses the problems surrounding the contractual practical termination of the landscape subcontract, the defects liability period and interim landscape maintenance as well as landscape maintenance work after the landscape installation has reached final completion. The study points towards an appropriate form of contract for use in conjunction with the JBCC contract system to provide for the particular requirements of landscape contracting. It indicates the necessary compatibility between landscape subcontractual requirements and the JBCC Nominated/Selected Subcontract Agreement. This required compatibility warrants a revision of or an addendum to the JBCC document. The requirements for a landscape maintenance contract, for use after termination of the landscape installation (sub) contract, are shown to be sufficiently different from the installation contract to warrant changes or addenda to the standard construction contract form. From a review of literature on the landscape contractual environment in South Africa and a study of contracts commonly used in South Africa, pertinent landscape contractual issues are identified for the three phases in which landscape and related environmental works are performed, i. e. before the main construction contract, during the main construction contract and during the landscape maintenance period after completion of the main contract. These issues are formalised and tested for validity and relevance by means of a survey conducted amongst developers and owners of building and engineering works, contractors and professional consultants. The research is summarised, findings and conclusions {{for each of the three}} landscape works phases are presented and recommendations made to address the confirmed contractual problematic issues. The survey confirms the JBCC suite of contracts as the most widely used for landscaping contracts in South Africa and the recommendations therefore focus thereon. The study concludes with a proposal for an addendum to the JBCC’s Nominated/Selected Subcontract Agreement entitled “General and specific conditions of subcontract for landscape and related works” and recommendations for further study of related issues identified in the survey but which fall outside the focus of this study.

Using a mail questionnaire, we invited <b>landscape</b> <b>contracting</b> decision-makers {{to comment on the}} efficacy of <b>landscape</b> <b>contracting</b> curricula at colleges and universities. The population of Associated Landscape Contractors of America 2003 online member list (2049 companies) was organized into four strata based on company size. A stratified random sample of 400 companies was selected. We received 137 completed questionnaires (35 % response rate). Most of the population was either satisfied or extremely satisfied (52 %) with college graduates recently hired; only 8. 1 % of the population was dissatisfied or extremely dissatisfied. When respondents were asked to consider four knowledge categories, a majority (53 %) said recent graduates were deficient in business knowledge, followed by construction (25. 1 %), horticultural (9. 6 %), and design (5. 1 %) knowledge. When respondents were asked to rate the importance of topics that could be taught in undergraduate <b>landscape</b> <b>contracting</b> programs, business topics (personnel management, estimating and bidding, and clientele management) were identified as their top three choices. The population also named three business-related skills (client relationships, time management, and managing employees) among the five most important skills for <b>landscape</b> <b>contracting</b> professionals.

40|$|Aspects of the Professional Role of the Landscape Architect - {{exemplified}} {{through the}} development of School Grounds The purpose of this thesis is to examine the professional role of the landscape architect. To reach this goal two research approaches were used. The first approach consisted of two case-studies of secondary schools involved in developing their school grounds with <b>contracted</b> <b>landscape</b> architects. The second approach was to bring together landscape architects in a focus group for a series of three discussions. During the case-studies, "Knowledge workshops", a method for participatory planning was applied and developed to include the school ground itself in the process. To understand the complexity of the various roles played by the professional landscape architect, the research questions this study addressed were: How do landscape architects perceive their professional role? How do landscape architects view their role in relation to colleagues, participants and/or clients, public administrators and funders? How does that role relate to school ground development processes? Empirical results from an analysis of data from the case-studies and the focus group provided a means to obtain a picture of the habitus of the landscape architect. It is apparent that the embodied history that the French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu describes plays an important part in determining how landscape architects function in challenging situations. When working under pressure landscape architects often fall back upon the familiar and well proven approaches they developed during their professional training and early practice. Study results indicated an uncertainty {{on the part of the}} landscape architect about how to use input provided by participants in the design process, which could cause problems when it comes to trying out new aesthetical and practical solutions and ideas. The study demonstrates that it may be difficult for a landscape architect to assess results of school ground participatory design processes which were often shown to have been derived from other, non-participatory ideals and role-models. This study suggests that the development of methods for evaluating participatory processes for landscape architects could have positive implications for the development of education in landscape architecture. The results of this study show that developing a working model and a professional consciousness of these dilemmas and of the determinants of decisions taken by landscape architects could lead to a broader understanding of the culture in which their professional values arise and are reproduced...|$|R

40|$|Through two {{projects}} of the Basic Road Network in the Department of Cochabamba, Bolivia, the thesis addresses the paradox intrinsic to the proposals of highways, seeking to link distant points but conflicting between reticulated and adherent conceptions of mobility. That tension {{allows us to}} question the Plurinational State, its development model and autonomic configuration in place since 2009 {{as an alternative to}} the Nation-State. The thesis shows the ratio of cases with long-term history of the road network in Cochabamba, since prehispanic era to date (part 1 : context); analyses in detail the geography and the landscape dimension of territory traversed (part 2 : text); collects a documentary and personal basis, to describe the alliances and confrontations of actors and their discourses on projects (part 3 : texture); finally shows how the territorial literacy of the sections confirms and complexifies the paradox of a road conception as "tunnel" and another as dense mesh of connections (part 4 : text). The analysis explains that innovations such as the "live well" development model and the "autonomies" as state settings do not question Republican limits and vertical exercise of the power in Bolivia. Therefore, highway projects are truncated and generate conflict when their speeches are unable to adapt effectively to the logic of borders not only applied from the central government, but also from the autonomous entities and their articulation with the global "world system". Finally, urban tracks generated in other environments, such as axis <b>contracts</b> and <b>landscape</b> mediation, are resumed. Adaptation and experimentation for Bolivian mobility projects is suggested as guides to enhance interaction between the routes and territories, from a participatory incorporation of various actors, scales, areas and flows.
