40|$|The {{long and}} short term {{behavior}} of light water reactor stainless steel <b>clad</b> <b>fuel</b> has been investigated {{in order to establish}} more adequate or applicable operation/design criteria. The performance record of stainless steel <b>clad</b> <b>fuel</b> used in both the Connecticut Yankee and San Onofre 1 power stations has remained essentially unmarred until the recent past. While the San Onofre 1 plant has maintained this record, the Connecticut Yankee station has experienced a number of fuel element failures since 1977. Consequently, emphasis has been placed on cladding behavior for anomalous operation experienced by the Connecticut Yankee reactor prior to its first observed coolant activity increase. In order to predict <b>cladding</b> behavior, a <b>fuel</b> performance code (STRESS) has been developed with the capabilities of analyzing long term cladding creepdown behavior, cladding conditioning, and behavior during up-power ramping and power maneuvers. The effects of varied fill gas pressure and cladding creep rate on the stress/deformation behavior of stainless steel cladding for these performance areas have been investigated. Similar calculations are also performed for Zircaloy <b>clad</b> <b>fuel</b> so that a comparison can be made between these materials. Code limitations are discussed and some methods which compensate for insufficient modeling are reviewed. Fuel element design and reactor operation recommendations are made for Connecticut Yankee (and San Onofre 1) stainless steel <b>clad</b> <b>fuel.</b> These include fill gas pressurization level, up-power ramp rate limitations, and possible cladding material preference. These recommendations are {{based on the results of}} the STRESS code and the trends which may be inferred from them...|$|R

The tests were performed with sodium chloride – bicarbonate solutions under oxidizing conditions and, for one test, in reducing Ar/H 2 atmosphere. The iodine and cesium release could be partially explained by the differences in sample preparation, leading to different sizes and properties of the exposed surface areas. Iodine and cesium releases tend to correlate with FGR and linear power rating, but the scatter of the data is significant.

Since the middles of the 60 ’s decade the General Atomics, supplier of the TRIGA reactor, discontinued the fabrication of such aluminum <b>clad</b> <b>fuel</b> elements. In order to upgrade the IPR-R 1 reactor power, nine stainless steel <b>clad</b> <b>fuel</b> elements were purchased in 1971. One of these fuel elements was instrumented in the centerline with three type K thermocouples. On December 2000, four of these stainless steel <b>clad</b> <b>fuel</b> elements were placed into the core allowing to uprate the nominal power to 250 kW steady state. In 2004 the instrumented fuel element (IF) was inserted into the core hottest position, predicted by neutronic calculations. The IF stayed in this position up to 2007, allowing heat transfer investigations in several operating powers, including the maximum power of 250 kW. During this time it also monitored the core temperature in all operations. The fuel temperature and other operational parameters were stored in a computer hard disk, with an accessible historical database, {{in order to make}} the chronological information on reactor performance and its behavior available to users. After almost 3 years of monitoring the core temperature, it was noticed that one of the three thermocouples didn't send anymore the correct value of the measures.

These assemblies house <b>clad</b> <b>fuel</b> pellets containing enriched fuel. Irradiation studies of these assemblies in the NASA Plum Brook Reactor will provide data required for the desigi of thermionic converter reactors being considered by NASA. Three major objectives were defined at the initiation of this project at Battelle. These were (1) to provide containment vessel assemblies for irradiation studies, (2) to identify the best fuel dispersion/cladding combination for the fueled pellets, and (3) to identify and optimize the most promising fabrication technique to the extent necessary to provide reproducible specimens. In addition to these major objectives, other goals were defined in relation to supporting studies required for the successful conclusion of this program. The approach for accomplishing these objectives involved the cooperation of various research and research support groups at Battelle. These groups contributed to the overall program by involvement in the following areas: (1) Preparation or procurement of various types of UO{sub 2 } fuel particles; (2) Application of tungsten coating to the fuel particles; (3) Development of various powder-consolidation techniques for the fuel form including use of explosive methods and hot isostatic pressing; (4) Selection and evaluation of high-temperature claddings for the fuel form; (5) Development of techniques for cladding application to the fuel form; (6) Evaluation of candidate systems by thermal cycling; (7) Fabrication of irradiation containment vessels and the associated components; and (8) Conduction of appropriate supporting studies associated with welding and brazing of the containment vessel components. The objectives of this program were accomplished to the extent that two <b>clad</b> <b>fuel</b> pellet containment vessel assemblies were completed and forwarded to NASA for irradiation testing.

40|$|Excessive oxidation, hydriding, and {{extensive}} irradiation damage occur in high-burnup <b>fuel</b> <b>cladding,</b> and as result, mechanical properties of high-burnup fuels are degraded significantly. This {{may influence the}} current <b>fuel</b> <b>cladding</b> failure limits for loss-of- coolant-accident (LOCA) situations, {{which are based on}} <b>fuel</b> <b>cladding</b> behavior for zero burnup. To avoid <b>cladding</b> fragmentation and <b>fuel</b> dispersal during a LOCA, 10 CFR 50. 46 requires that peak cladding temperature shall not exceed 1204 degrees C (2200 degrees F) and that total oxidation of the <b>fuel</b> <b>cladding</b> nowhere exceeds 0. 17 times total cladding thickness before oxidation. Because of the concern, a new experimental program to investigate high-burnup <b>fuel</b> <b>cladding</b> behavior under LOCA situations has been initiated under the sponsorship of the U. S.

40|$|BACKGROUND JAFNPP design {{criteria}} (Ref. 1) requires. and SLs ensure, that specified acceptable fuel design limits are not exceeded during steady state operation. normal operational transients, and abnormal operational transients. The <b>fuel</b> <b>cladding</b> integrity SL is set such that no significant fuel damage is calculated to occur if the limit is not violated. Because fuel damage {{is not directly}} observable, a stepback approach is used to establish an SL. such that the MCPR {{is not less than}} the limit specified in Specification 2. 1. 1. 2. MCPR greater than the specified limit represents a conservative margin relative to the conditions required to maintain <b>fuel</b> <b>cladding</b> integrity. The <b>fuel</b> <b>cladding</b> is one of the physical barriers that separate the radioactive materials from the environs. The integrity of this cladding barrier is related to its relative freedom from perforations or cracking. Although some corrosion or use related cracking may occur during the life of the cladding, fission product migration from this source is incrementally cumulative and continuously measurable. <b>Fuel</b> <b>cladding</b> perforations, however, can result from thermal stresses, which occur from reactor operation significantly above design conditions. While fission product migration from cladding perforation is just as measurable as that from use related cracking, the thermally caused cladding perforations signal a threshold beyond which still greater thermal stresses may cause gross, rather than incremental, cladding deterioration. Therefore, the <b>fuel</b> <b>cladding</b> SL is defined with a margin to the conditions that would produce onset of transition boiling (i. e [...] MCPR = 1. 00). These conditions represent a significant departure from the condition intended by design for planned operation.
