5|$|At Horace Mann Elementary School in Seattle {{during the}} mid-1950s, Hendrix's habit of {{carrying}} a broom {{with him to}} emulate a guitar gained {{the attention of the}} school's social worker. After {{more than a year of}} his <b>clinging</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> broom like a security blanket, she wrote a letter requesting school funding intended for underprivileged children, insisting that leaving him without a guitar might result in psychological damage. Her efforts failed, and Al refused to buy him a guitar.|$|E
5|$|A mountainside, at the magician's cavern. Goffredo and Eustazio {{are told}} by the Magician that Almirena is being held captive in Armida's palace at the mountain-top. Ignoring the magician's warning that they will need special powers, the pair set off for the palace but are quickly driven back by Armida's monsters. The magician then gives them magic wands that transcend Armida's power, and they set off again. This time they {{overcome}} the monsters, but as they reach {{the gates of the}} palace it disappears, leaving them <b>clinging</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> rock {{in the midst of a}} stormy sea. They climb the rock and descend out of sight.|$|E

5|$|American Philo McGiffin, who was {{on board}} Zhenyuan, {{reported}} after the battle {{that there had been}} a variety of stories about the fate of the ship, but one that the survivors agreed on was the tale of the interaction between Captain Deng and his dog. As the ship went down, the captain ended up <b>clinging</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> piece of debris. However, his dog swam to him. Deng released the debris, and unable to swim, he drowned along with the dog. Chinese sources have subsequently stated Captain Deng made the decision to go down with Zhiyuan. In this retelling, the dog attempted to drag him to safety, but he refused to be moved and both died.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} rolling waves and shots of palm tree-lined roads, and gulls. A posse of skateboarders are also pictured in this scene. At first, the clip appears to {{function}} in small, romantic gestures, reminiscent {{to that of a}} fashion magazine advertisement. The singer is pictured in two visually different love affairs. In the first, Del Rey is shown <b>clinging</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> younger, long-haired blond, leather-clad man on a beach, where she narcotically flits around the Pacific Ocean shorefront, and splashes in its waves with him. At the 1:20 mark, the song and its visuals simultaneously switch up, with the singer being pictured donning diamond jewelry, sitting alongside a more mature and svengali-type man who wears sunglasses, as a chauffeured convertible barrels forward in slow motion. Del Rey's love interest in this segment recalls age disparity in sexual relationships, producer Robert Evans, and Scott Weiland. In another scene, the two are depicted nuzzling and smoking {{in the back seat of}} the car. Del Rey depicts a woozy and solemn persona in these segments, while the pair caress each other under passing streetlights. The clip then returns to the scene of Del Rey and her younger love interest on the beach. The aforementioned segments are intercut with scenes that appear to be shot on a low-quality camcorder.|$|E

25|$|Partly {{because of}} the tourist industry, but mainly to the Ridunians' own {{drinking}} culture (there is a common expression elsewhere in the Channel Islands that Alderney is composed of 'two thousand alcoholics, <b>clinging</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> rock'), there are restaurants and public houses. Nightlife includes informal dance music events often taking place in abandoned bunkers ('bunker parties') and more organised events in and around Alderney Week at the Corporation Quarry ('Quarry parties').|$|E
25|$|Both ships sank quickly, and Varangberg {{had no time}} {{to launch}} her {{lifeboats}}. Avoceta sank by the stern, and her bows quickly rose to such an angle that her lifeboats could not be lowered.

Later on, while {{on a trip to}} Algiers, he showed the pocket knife, which had enabled him to survive this ordeal. He was full of gratitude also for the children lodged at an orphanage, and asked the cardinal archbishop of Algiers, Léon-Etienne Duval, to help out the orphanage (or Kasbah).|$|E
25|$|By {{the middle}} of the battle, as dawn was about to break, the allied fleet had the upper hand and half of Shimazu's fleet were either sunk or captured. It was said that Yoshihiro's {{flagship}} was sunk and that he was <b>clinging</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> piece of wood in the icy water. Japanese ships came to his rescue, pulling him to safety. During the course of the battle, the ships fought from the west end of the strait all the way across to the east end, almost to the open water. The Japanese sustained heavy damage and began to retreat along the south coast of Namhae Island, towards Pusan.|$|E
25|$|As {{the team}} closed out August, United {{continued}} to struggle mightily. Bill Hamid {{was back in}} goal as the team made {{a trip to the}} New York Red Bulls home field. Without Espindola though, United's attack remained absolutely toothless. NYRB dominated the midfield, perhaps in part because United was playing without Arnaud, who had suffered a concussion against San Jose. Hamid made some pivotal saves early on, but the floodgates eventually opened as the Red Bulls repeatedly sliced through the United defense, utterly dominating the contest which finished 3–0 in favor of NYRB. The loss left United <b>clinging</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> 2-point lead in the Eastern Conference, but NYRB held 3 games in hand.|$|E

25|$|On 28 February 1999, Oregon II was 25 {{nautical}} miles (46km) off Cape Canaveral, Florida, bound for Pascagoula when she sighted {{two men and}} a woman <b>clinging</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> capsized 25-foot (7.6-meter) fishing boat in growing darkness and 6-to-8-foot (1.8-to-2.4-meter) seas. The three people {{had been unable to}} send any distress signal, had been in the water for about five hours, were beginning to suffer hypothermia, and were in real danger of perishing during the upcoming night when Oregon II rescued them. Oregon II transferred them to a United States Coast Guard cutter, which returned them to shore. For vigilant watchstanding and promptly rescuing the three people, Oregon II received the Department of Commerce Gold Medal in 1999.|$|E
25|$|This psycho-physical {{process is}} further linked with {{psychological}} craving, manas (conceit) and ditthi (dogmas, views). One {{of the most}} problematic views according to the Buddha, {{is the notion of}} a permanent and solid Self or 'pure ego'. This is because in early Buddhist psychology, there is no fixed self (atta; Sanskrit atman) but the delusion of self and <b>clinging</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> self concept affects all one's behaviors and leads to suffering. For the Buddha, there is nothing uniform or substantial about a person, only a constantly changing stream of events or processes categorized under five categories called skandhas (heaps, aggregates), which includes the stream of consciousness (Vijñāna-sotam). False belief and attachment to an abiding ego-entity {{is at the root of}} most negative emotions.|$|E
25|$|Riding an 8-game winning streak, Georgia (10–1) {{was ranked}} No. 2 {{in the country}} when they faced Pittsburgh (also 10–1, ranked No. 10) in the 1982 Sugar Bowl. The Bulldogs came up short in the loss, 20–24. Walker {{finished}} with 25 rushes for 84 yards and led UGA in receptions with 3 catches for 53 yards. He made his presence felt early as he bolted 8 {{yards for a touchdown}} in the 2nd quarter giving Georgia a 7–0 lead. After a 30-yard, Dan Marino touchdown pass lifted Pitt to a 10-7 lead in third quarter, Walker answered, scoring from 10 yards out to give Georgia a 14–10 lead going into the 4th quarter. With Georgia <b>clinging</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> 20–17 lead late in the game, Marino found Pittsburgh's receiver John Brown for a 33-yard touchdown pass with 0:35 left in the game.|$|E

25|$|In the Eastern Conference Finals, a {{match up}} with the 61-win, Carlisle-led Pacers, the Pistons faltered in the final 90 seconds of Game 1, falling 78-74. Prior to Game 2, Rasheed Wallace famously {{guaranteed}} a Detroit victory. With Detroit <b>clinging</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> 69-67 lead with under 30 seconds to play, after Billups recovered the basketball after a Jermaine O'Neal blocked shot of Rasheed Wallace, Jamaal Tinsley stripped Billups and found Reggie Miller open down the court for {{what appeared to be}} the tying lay-up. As Miller approached the basket, Tayshaun Prince ran in from the left wing and blocked Miller's lay-up as it left his fingertips. Richard Hamilton recovered the loose ball before it went out of bounds and was fouled by Tinsley. Hamilton would make three free throws in the game's final 15 seconds to seal the victory and tie the series. The Pistons rode the momentum of Game 2 (including dominant wins in Games 3 and 5) to a 4-2 series victory, advancing to the NBA Finals for the first time in 14 years.|$|E
25|$|ESPN's College GameDay was in State College for the Big Ten opener. The Hawkeyes {{fell behind}} early, 10–0, after a 79-yard pass from Daryll Clark to Chaz Powell on Penn State's first play from {{scrimmage}} {{and then a}} 20-play drive by the Nittany Lions {{that led to a}} Collin Wagner field goal. But Iowa would score 21 unanswered points after that to stun Penn State for the second consecutive year. The defense shut down the Nittany Lions in the final three quarters, forcing four turnovers, and the turning point in the game came when Penn State punted, <b>clinging</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> 10–5 lead in the fourth quarter, Adrian Clayborn blocked a punt and ran it back 53 yards for a touchdown to give the Hawkeyes the lead. With the momentum changed, they were more easily able to move the ball on their final two drives. For many Penn State fans, the way the game played out reminded them of the games from their dismal 3–9 (1–7) season with many close losses in 2003, but for many Iowa fans, the way the game played out also brought back memories of 2003, reminding them of their 2003 season where they finished #8 in the nation and beat Penn State 26–14 at home, during a span of three years (2002, 2003, 2004) where they were #8 for three consecutive years and won a share of the conference championship in two of those years (2002 and 2004).|$|E
25|$|On November 1, in the Bergmann Offensive, Russians {{crossed the}} {{frontier}} first. They planned to capture Doğubeyazıt and Köprüköy. The official Russian {{declaration of war}} on the Ottoman Empire came on November 2. The established force for this goal was 25 infantry battalions, 37 cavalry units and 120 artillery guns. It had two wings. On the right wing, the Russian I Corps crossed the border and moved from Sarikamish toward the direction of Köprüköy. They reached Köprüköy on November 4. On the left wing, the Russian IV Corps moved from Yerevan to Pasinler Plains. The commander of 3rd Army, Hasan Izzet was {{not in favor of}} an offensive action in the harsh winter conditions. His plan was to remain in defense and launch a counterattack at the right time. This was overridden by the War Minister Enver Pasha. On November 7, the Turkish 3rd Army commenced its offensive with the participation of the XI Corps and all cavalry units. This force was supported by a Kurdish Tribal Regiment. The cavalry failed to execute the encirclement and the Kurdish Tribal Regiment proved to be unreliable. The Russians gained territory after the withdrawal of the 18th and the 30th Divisions. Ottoman forces managed to maintain their positions at Köprüköy. By November 12, the Turkish IX Corps with Ahmet Fevzi Pasha had reinforced the XI Corps on the left flank. The 3rd Army began to push the Russians back {{with the support of the}} cavalry. The 3rd Infantry Regiment managed to invade Köprüköy after the Azap Offensive between November 17 and 20. By the end of November, the front had stabilized, with the Russians <b>clinging</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> salient 25 kilometers into the Ottoman Empire along the Erzurum-Sarikamish axis. There was Russian success along the southern shoulders of the offensive where Armenian volunteers were effective and took Karaköse and Doğubeyazıt. Doğubeyazıt was the northern neighbor of Van Province. Ottoman casualties were high: 9000 killed, 3000 taken prisoner and 2800 deserters.|$|E
