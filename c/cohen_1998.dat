In general, {{most of them}} involve finding out students’ prior knowledge about strategies, presenting the strategies selected to be developed and modelling their use, using them, evaluating their effectiveness, and transferring their use to different tasks and situations. Each one of these stages helps students to {{become more aware of}} their strategy use, have a better chance to use and transfer the strategies, as well as self-monitor and self-evaluate their strategy use (<b>Cohen,</b> <b>1998).</b>|$|E

However, it {{is reported to have}} better resistance than other varieties carrying Bph 1 and has good field resistance to the pest, exhibiting antiobiosis, antixenosis and tolerance (Cohen et al. 1997). This is partly attributed to its possessing additional QTLs controlling BPH resistance which confer greater durability of the resistance (Alam and <b>Cohen</b> <b>1998).</b>|$|E

50|$|As was the {{practice}} at the time (and which continued until 1974), only the 11 players in the final received a winners medal.

30|$|In contrast, ocular surface dermoid lesions present {{either as}} limbal dermoids at the infero{{temporal}} corneal limbus or dermolipomas in the conjunctival fornix on the temporal side (Martinez and <b>Cohen</b> <b>1998).</b> All these ocular surface dermoids or dermolipomas are naturally presented to ophthalmologists. In addition, {{the association of}} ocular surface dermoids or dermolipomas with preauricular appendages leads to the referral of children from plastic surgeons to ophthalmologists. Under the circumstances, a consecutive series of patients with ocular surface dermoids or dermolipomas at an eye clinic in a referral-based hospital provides a representative group of patients without bias at the presentation.|$|E

Polyspermic zygotes, which occur in ~ 2 %– 5 % of zygotes during in vitro fertilization (IVF) clinical trials, may generate blastocysts in vitro but invariably fail to develop normally in vivo (Munne and <b>Cohen,</b> <b>1998),</b> providing an ideal model system to examine the targeting efficiency and off-target effects of CRISPR/Cas 9 during early human embryonic development (Bredenoord et al., 2008; Sathananthan et al., 1999).|$|E
40|$|Visual object {{processing}} in infancy {{is often described}} as proceeding from an early stage in which object features are processed independently to a later stage in which relations between features are taken into account (e. g., <b>Cohen,</b> <b>1998).</b> Here we present the Representational Acuity Hypothesis, which argues that this behavioral shift can be explained by a developmental decrease in the size of neural receptive fields in the cortical areas responsible for object representation, together with a tuning to specific object features. We evaluate this hypothesis with a connectionist model of infant perceptual categorization. The model shows a behavioral shift in featural to relational processing consistent with similar results observed in the infant categorization experiments of Younger (1985) and Younger and Cohen (1986) ...|$|E

30|$|Plants can employ various {{resistance}} {{mechanisms to}} reduce insect damage in nature. Plant resistance to insects is generally differentiated in (1) antibiosis: {{a quality that}} reduces insect survival, growth rate, or reproduction following the ingestion of host tissue; (2) antixenosis: a quality that repels or disturbs insects, causing a reduction in colonization or oviposition; and (3) tolerance: a capacity to produce a crop of high quality and yield despite insect infestation (Alam and <b>Cohen</b> <b>1998).</b> BPH resistance genes confer their resistance through one {{or a combination of}} the above-mentioned defense mechanisms. Understanding the mode of gene action leads to better BPH management practices. However, the information on resistance mechanism of most of the identified BPH resistance genes is limited. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze the mechanisms of resistance in resistant cultivars carrying BPH resistance genes, which should favor the BPH resistance breeding programs in rice.|$|E
30|$|In {{daily life}} {{we assume that}} hands belong to us when they are {{connected}} to our bodies in the usual way, and that artificial hands not so connected cannot be ours. But Tastevin (1937) produced {{evidence to suggest that}} artificial hands could be experienced as belonging to self when participants simply look at an artificial hand that is appropriately aligned with body position and posture (cf., Schaefer, Heinze, & Rotte, 2009; Ferri, Chiarelli, Merla, Gallese, & Costantini, 2013). This belonging or ownership illusion was replicated by Botvinick and <b>Cohen</b> (<b>1998)</b> under experimental conditions that incorporated tactile sensation. The phenomenon, {{what has come to be}} known as the rubber hand illusion (RHI), has since been further replicated, by various techniques, multiple times (for reviews, see Ehrsson, 2009, 2012; Makin, Holmes, & Ehrsson, 2008; Tsakiris et al, 2010; Tsakiris 2011), even in non-humans (Wada, Takano, Ora, Ide, & Kansaku, 2016).|$|E
30|$|Test {{validation}} {{methods are}} an important part of language testing research. Validation methods have generally been predisposed in three domains (Rahimi et al. 2016): developments in psychometric and statistical methods in education (Bachman 2004; Bachman and Eignor 1997), qualitative methods in language testing influenced by second language acquisition (Banerjee and Luoma 1997; Bachman & <b>Cohen</b> <b>1998),</b> conversation analysis and discourse analysis (Lazaraton 2002), and cognitive psychology research studies amalgamated into language testing research (Green 1997). The 1950 s and 1960 s witnessed studies on validation of discrete-point language tests while the research shifted attention to communicative language tests during the 1970 s (Clark 1975). This illustrates the fact that validity studies in earlier times was confined to limited concepts such as content and construct validity rather than score interpretations as the basis for predictions (Sackett et al. 2017). Additionally, test-taking processes and strategies and test consequences were ignored.|$|E
