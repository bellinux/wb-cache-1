5|$|Although hot <b>chocolate</b> <b>is</b> {{generally}} consumed for pleasure, {{the beverage}} confers several potential health benefits. A 2003 study from Cornell University found that cocoa contains {{large amounts of}} antioxidants that may help prevent cancer. Also, it has been demonstrated that the cocoa bean helps with digestion. From the 16th to 19th centuries, hot chocolate was valued as a medicine {{as well as a}} drink.|$|E
5|$|Hot chocolate, {{also known}} as hot cocoa, {{drinking}} chocolate or just cocoa is a heated beverage consisting of shaved chocolate, melted chocolate or cocoa powder, heated milk or water, and usually a sweetener. Hot chocolate may be topped with whipped cream.

50|$|One crucial {{distinction}} between the two types of Frango <b>chocolates</b> <b>is</b> the packaging.

40|$|Unfinished {{crystallisation}} in freshly produced <b>chocolates</b> <b>is</b> one of {{the major}} reasons for fat bloom, especially for filled products. Chocolate shells, if insufficiently crystallised, show reduced resistance to oil-migration of fillings. The influence of two production parameters, cooling tunnel time and storage temperature, on the finished state of <b>chocolates</b> <b>is</b> investigated. It is found that the crystallisation in the <b>chocolates</b> <b>is</b> not finished when the products leave the cooling tunnel...|$|R

5|$|A four-part series {{published}} between August and November 1996, Venom: The Hunger {{introduces the}} Venom symbiote's reliance on phenethylamine for survival (which requires it to eat human brains after depleting Brock's {{supply of the}} chemical) and reveals that <b>chocolate</b> <b>is</b> a source of the chemical. Brock refuses to eat human brains; the symbiote abandons him, and he is locked in an asylum {{under the care of}} the deranged Dr. Paine. Brock escapes to hunt the symbiote, which has gone on a killing spree to obtain brains. He reunites with the symbiote (after finding an alternative source of the chemical), but Paine steals the symbiote for himself. Brock frees the symbiote, and again becomes Venom.|$|E
5|$|In the 2010s, hot <b>chocolate</b> <b>is</b> {{consumed}} {{throughout the}} world and comes in multiple variations, including the spiced chocolate para mesa of Latin America, the very thick cioccolata calda served in Italy and chocolate a la taza served in Spain, and the thinner hot cocoa consumed in the United States.

40|$|The Word Association {{technique}} {{was used to}} analyze the perception of 120 Uruguayan consumers concerning the different types of <b>chocolate.</b> Similarly, it <b>was</b> estimated how healthy consumers perceived dark, white and milk <b>chocolate</b> to <b>be.</b> As a generic product, <b>chocolate</b> <b>was</b> associated with good taste, positive feelings, sweetness, feelings of warmth and calories/energy. White, dark and milk <b>chocolate</b> <b>were</b> significantly associated with other concepts (creaminess, bitterness, intense taste, etc.). A cluster analysis was performed on the scores regarding the perceived healthiness as reported by the consumers. 3 clusters were identified: Cluster 1 did not perceive any of the three types of <b>chocolate</b> to <b>be</b> very healthy, Cluster 2 considered dark <b>chocolate</b> to <b>be</b> very healthy but white <b>chocolate</b> to <b>be</b> less healthy and Cluster 3 perceived the three types of chocolate as very healthy.

25|$|<b>Chocolate</b> <b>is</b> sold in {{chocolate}} bars, which come in dark chocolate, milk chocolate and white chocolate varieties. Some bars that are mostly chocolate have other ingredients blended into the chocolate, such as nuts, raisins or crisped rice. <b>Chocolate</b> <b>is</b> {{used as an}} ingredient in a huge variety of candy bars, which typically contain various confectionary ingredients (e.g., nougat, wafers, caramel, nuts, etc.) which are coated {{in chocolate}}. <b>Chocolate</b> <b>is</b> used as a flavouring product in many desserts, such as chocolate cakes, chocolate brownies, chocolate mousse and chocolate chip cookies. Numerous types of candy and snacks contain chocolate, either as a filling (e.g., M's) or as a coating (e.g., chocolate-coated raisins or chocolate-coated peanuts). Some non-alcoholic beverages contain chocolate, such as chocolate milk, hot chocolate and chocolate milkshakes. Some alcoholic liqueurs are flavoured with chocolate, such as chocolate liqueur and creme de cacao. <b>Chocolate</b> <b>is</b> a popular flavour of ice cream and pudding, and chocolate sauce is a commonly added as a topping on ice cream sundaes.|$|E
25|$|<b>Chocolate</b> <b>is</b> {{associated}} with festivals such as Easter, when moulded chocolate rabbits and eggs are traditionally given in Christian communities, and Hanukkah, when chocolate coins {{are given in}} Jewish communities. Chocolate hearts and chocolate in heart-shaped boxes are popular on Valentine's Day and are often presented along with flowers and a greeting card. In 1868, Cadbury created Fancy Boxes – a decorated box of chocolates – {{in the shape of}} a heart for Valentine's Day.

25|$|Excessive {{consumption}} of {{large quantities of}} any energy-rich food, such as chocolate, without a corresponding increase in activity to expend the associated calories, can {{increase the risk of}} weight gain and possibly obesity. Raw <b>chocolate</b> <b>is</b> high in cocoa butter, a fat which is removed during chocolate refining, then added back in varying proportions during the manufacturing process. Manufacturers may add other fats, sugars, and milk as well, all of which increase the caloric content of chocolate.|$|E
25|$|The {{fact that}} mate is so {{prevalent}} in the Southern Cone, however, should not necessarily make visitors think that other infusions are rare in the region; in Argentina especially, given the strong European cultural imprint, the consumption of coffee is very common (141 cups per capita, annually). Chocolate infusions are also popular (the eating of <b>chocolate</b> <b>is</b> a Spanish influence, although the plant originated in Mesoamerica). This consumption grows during autumn and winter, or in the cold regions of the country; there are two dates where consumption of chocolate infusions is traditional in the primary educational centres: 25 May and 9 July, that is, the two national dates of Argentina.|$|E

40|$|The {{material}} properties of four texturally different <b>chocolates</b> <b>were</b> investigated {{with the aim}} of enabling possible future prediction of texture attributes of chocolate through laboratory protocols rather than human subjects. The protein profile of the four <b>chocolates</b> <b>was</b> analysed through SDS-PAGE technique. The hardness and the in-water meltdown behaviour of the four <b>chocolates</b> <b>were</b> measured at room temperature and 37 °C, respectively, using a Texture Analyser (TA HD Plus, Stable Micro Systems). A stress controlled rotational rheometer (MCR 301, Anton Paar) was used to evaluate the apparent viscosity, yield stress and viscoelastic modulus of the chocolates, as well as their friction properties. The <b>chocolates</b> <b>were</b> also emulsified with water to obtain in-vitro boluses and their friction properties were evaluated and compared to the respective in-vivo boluses. The chocolates showed different {{material properties}}. Two <b>chocolates</b> <b>were</b> harder and more viscous than the other two <b>chocolates</b> which may <b>be</b> due to different amounts of milk fat in the continuous fat phase in the chocolates. The chocolates also showed differences in the meltdown and in the friction behaviour, the latter may be affected by the different particle size of the chocolates. The friction behaviour of the <b>chocolate</b> in-vitro boluses <b>was</b> {{different from that of the}} respective in-vivo boluses, this is supposed to depend on differences in the interface structure between the two types of bolus...|$|R
