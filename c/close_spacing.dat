5|$|In 1992, Caltrans {{released}} the first feasibility study detailing {{the possibility of}} electrifying the railroad between San Francisco and San Jose. The 1992 Feasibility Study proposed replacing the existing diesel-electric locomotives with either a fleet of EMD AEM-7 electric locomotives to move the existing gallery passenger cars or Metro North Budd M-2/M-4 EMUs. The primary benefits of an electrified railway would be improvements in air quality, noise, and acceleration, but would also save on other ancillary costs, such as lubricating oil, cooling water, maintenance, and refueling. Because of the relatively <b>close</b> <b>spacing</b> between stops, the improved acceleration using electric locomotives compared to the existing diesel-electric locomotives would cut transit time between San Francisco and San Jose by up to twelve minutes, and using EMUs would cut the time over the same distance by up to 23 minutes, assuming the use of ten-car trainsets. The 1992 Feasibility Study recommended the use of electric locomotives and 25kV AC overhead lines as the most cost-effective alternative, since the gallery cars, which had been built in 1985, were then relatively new and could be reused.|$|E

25|$|An {{efficient}} Tesla turbine requires <b>close</b> <b>spacing</b> of the disks. For example, a steam-powered type {{must maintain}} 0.4 millimeter (.016inch) inter-disk spacing. The disks must be extremely smooth to minimize surface and shear losses. Disks {{must also be}} very thin to prevent drag and turbulence at disk edges. Unfortunately, preventing disks from warping and distorting was a major challenge in Tesla's time. It is thought that this inability to prevent the disks distorting contributed to the commercial failure of the turbines, because metallurgical technology {{at the time was}} not able to produce disks of sufficient quality and rigidity.|$|E

Paired departure to <b>closed</b> <b>spaced</b> {{parallel runways}} can effectively improve capacity of terminal, and also can solve congestion of busy airport, {{but it also}} increases the complexity of air traffic control. For ensuring safety operation of paired departure, the longitudinal collision risk of paired departure to <b>closed</b> <b>spaced</b> parallel runways was studied. Based on the acceleration error distribution and requirements on wake avoidance during paired departure, a longitudinal collision risk safety assessment model of <b>closed</b> <b>spaced</b> parallel runways paired departure was built. The parameters in this model were determined by providing the calculation models. In the end, an example was calculated to verify the model, {{and it turns out}} that this model is feasible. 1 Introduction With the rapid development of the air transport industry, most of the domestic airport, especially hub airports are facing increasingly serious traffic congestion problems. Paired departure to <b>closed</b> <b>spaced</b> parallel runways can effectively improve capacity of terminal, however, due to <b>closed</b> <b>spaced</b> parallel runways distance between the two runways is less than 760 m, it increases the complexity of runway operation.

40|$|I am {{interested}} in two spaces obverse to each other: open and <b>closed.</b> An open <b>space</b> develops organically based on how people inhabit it. Interacting with an open space is a dynamic, sporadic, multisensory, immersive, and subjective experience. In such spaces, we are confronted with an alternative aesthetic, one that is {{in conflict with the}} seamlessness of a <b>closed</b> <b>space.</b> A <b>closed</b> <b>space</b> is anchored on definite variables like structure, use and boundaries. While interaction between people and space is important, the space is tightly controlled and interaction is designed. Through this thesis project, I present a method that metaphorically transforms the experience of a walk through a <b>closed</b> <b>space</b> into an open-ended and immersive experience. When space develops as a response to our actions, it affords intimacy and a sense of belonging. It facilitates deeper expressiveness through engagement. By applying a method that uses fragmentation, recurrence and motion, I am metaphorically transforming an urban <b>closed</b> <b>space</b> to open. Through this transformation I am creating a fresh person-space dialogue that temporarily destabilizes perception and encourages physical sensation which allows for an intimate experience of the space. An immersive interaction with an open space transgresses the urban sterility of a <b>closed</b> <b>space</b> and is capable of creating a diversity of distinct experiences...|$|R
