50|$|The Alfa Romeo 115 {{series of}} engines closely follows the {{original}} de Havilland Gipsy Six engines in having 1-piece Elektron casting crankcases with cover plates, steel cylinders, finned for cooling, and detachable aluminium alloy cylinder heads. The 6-throw 1-piece <b>counterbalanced</b> <b>crankshaft</b> is carried in seven plain journal bearings and the propeller is driven {{directly by the}} crankshaft.|$|E
5000|$|A Sports {{version was}} added in 1923 with a two seater {{body with the}} spare wheel at the rear. The {{aluminium}} wings and bonnet were usually left unpainted. The engine was tuned with a high lift camshaft, special cylinder head and fully <b>counterbalanced</b> <b>crankshaft.</b> Options included an electric starter and a differential. A top speed of 65mph (105 km/hour) and fuel consumption of 45-50 miles per gallon (6.2 to 5.6 L/100km) was claimed.|$|E
5000|$|The M-105, {{designed}} in 1940, drew heavily on Klimov's {{experience with the}} Hispano-Suiza 12Y (license-built as the M-100). In addition to a two-speed supercharger, the M-105 had several improvements like two intake valves per cylinder and a <b>counterbalanced</b> <b>crankshaft.</b> The M-105 was the first Klimov V-12 engine design to place the induction system {{on the outside of}} the cylinder banks, with the exhaust system also exiting from the outboard side, with twin sets of [...] "siamesed" [...] exhaust ports adjacent to each other. About 129,000 M-105 and its variants were built.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Crankshaft</b> <b>Counterbalanced</b> two {{piece with}} 8 plain {{bearings}} & 2 main roller bearings. (Later 10 plain bearings.) ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to design a {{powertrain}} of unconvential V- 6 diesel engine with balancing shift with angel of cylinders’s axis 90 degrees and crank pin ofset of 30 degrees. The thesis provides an analysis of balance of inertial forces and their moments, layout of <b>counterbalances</b> on <b>crankshaft</b> and balancing shaft. It also provides a layout of discrete model of torsional cranksaft mechanism and layout of rubber damper of torsional oscillations...|$|R
50|$|Most radial engines {{have the}} {{cylinders}} arranged evenly around the crankshaft, although some early engines, sometimes called semi-radials or fan configuration engines, had an uneven arrangement. The best known engine {{of this type}} is the Anzani engine, which was fitted to the Bleriot XI used for the first flight across the English Channel in 1909. This arrangement had the drawback of needing a heavy <b>counterbalance</b> for the <b>crankshaft,</b> but was used to avoid the spark plugs oiling up.|$|R
5000|$|It {{is capable}} of {{producing}} [...] @ 2700 rpm. [...] This was Chevrolet's first V8 {{and one of the}} first overhead-valve V8 engines. Chevrolet wouldn't make another V8 until the debut of the small-block in 1955. This design had an exposed valvetrain (you could see the pushrods and lifters from the top) with nickel-plated rocker cover, an aluminum water-cooled intake manifold; the starter is in the valley, as is the gear driven generator with the fan clutch coming off of it. The gear driven generator runs the distributor as well. The belt in the front only drove the water pump. It had a 50 lb flywheel and a <b>counterbalanced</b> <b>crankshaft.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Ratier {{project was}} scrapped, though, {{as the two}} friends became {{involved}} with the first-ever MG record car EX120. With Eyston at the wheel, {{it was the first}} 750cc car in the world to set records at more than 100 mph. Eldridge played an important part {{in the development of the}} pioneering EX120. He designed a <b>counterbalanced</b> <b>crankshaft</b> as part of the tuning work on the engine, before EX120's first visit to Montlhéry in December 1930. It took several records at speeds up to 87 mi/h km/h. Eldridge told Cecil Kimber of MG that the car would have to be supercharged, if it were to have any chance of heading off a rival 100 mph attempt by Malcolm Campbell in a blown Austin Seven.|$|E
50|$|The {{frame was}} all new, with box section longitudinals, and {{independent}} front suspension (ifs) by a transverse leaf spring. It was the first British 8 hp family car to feature ifs. At the same time, an updated Flying Ten and a Flying Twelve were introduced, incorporating the same chassis features. The engine was a development of the previous Flying Nine/Ten, but now with a <b>counterbalanced</b> <b>crankshaft</b> and an aluminium cylinder head. The bore was reduced to 57 mm {{in order to get}} into the 8 hp class, while the stroke remained at 100 mm. At 1,021 cc swept volume, maximum power was quoted to 31 bhp at 4,000 rpm. A 3-speed gearbox was used, as well as Bendix mechanical brakes operated by cables.|$|E
5000|$|While {{there were}} some {{significant}} exterior alterations, the big change was under the bonnet {{where there was a}} result of more than two years technical collaboration between BMC and Rolls-Royce. The aluminium Rolls-Royce FB60 engine was a short-stroke version of the Rolls-Royce Military B: 4, 6 and 8 cylinder units of which more than 30,000 had already been produced. The 6-cylinder engine weighed only 450 lb. Its cubic capacity was 3.909 L. Over-square: bore was 95.25 mm, stroke 91.44 mm; with a 7.8:1 compression ratio its output was [...] @4,800 rpm. Twin SU carburettors were fitted. Both block and head were aluminium, tappets were hydraulic self-adjusting operating on overhead inlet and side exhaust valves. The <b>counterbalanced</b> <b>crankshaft</b> ran in seven bearings.|$|E
5000|$|The Le Mans had {{a higher}} tuned version of the 972 cc inline-four, with higher camshafts, bigger and better cooled oil sump, and a <b>counterbalanced</b> <b>crankshaft.</b> Power climbed to [...] and a {{close-ratio}} gearbox was fitted. The frame was dropped behind the front wheels and thus underslung at the rear. No running boards, a 12 imp gal external fuel tank and twin spare tyres finished the competition appearance. As opposed to the competing MGs, the Singer had more powerful and dependable hydraulic Lockheed brakes. The Nine Le Mans, while not particularly successful at the track which gave it its name, clocked up an impressive number of wins at hillclimbs, trials, and various endurance races such as the Liège-Rome-Liège and the Alpine Cup Rally. In 1935 a four-seater version of the Le Mans was also available, somewhat of a hybrid of the Sports and the regular Le Mans.|$|E
5000|$|Power {{from the}} V8 rose to 75 hp (56 kW) with a revised {{ignition}} system. The four-cylinder engine continued unchanged, but {{was referred to}} (by some) as the Model C, though Ford never referred to its [...] "Improved Four-Cylinder engine" [...] as a [...] "Model C" [...] engine. There is some dispute over this; some sources {{say it was a}} common misconception due to the introduction of a larger <b>counterbalanced</b> <b>crankshaft</b> during the Model B engine production, and the letter [...] "C" [...] casting mark on most, but not all, of the Model B heads. On the other side, this integrally counterweighted crankshaft was first introduced for truck engines only. When they proved superior concerning smoothness and longevity, they were introduced for worldwide four cylinder production. Together with {{the fact that there were}} huge quantities of [...] "B" [...] code engines in stock which needed to be used up, this explains why there are [...] "B" [...] and [...] "C" [...] coded engines in some model years. as Canadian-built cars used the prefix [...] "C" [...] on their identification plates, there is another source for errors. Model Bs start with prefix [...] "AB", V-8s with [...] "18-1". (Model A part number suffix was ‑A, Police Special High Compression head part number suffix was ‑b, and there was a fairly large letter [...] "B" [...] casting mark about the center of the head.) ...|$|E
