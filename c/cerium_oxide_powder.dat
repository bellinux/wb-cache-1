The current work applies the Sonatol process to the decontamination of heterogeneous legacy Pu- 238 waste that exhibits excessive hydrogen gas generation, which prevents transportation of the waste to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant. Bartlett Services, Inc. (BSI) designed and fabricated a prototype decontamination system within a replica of a Savannah River Site glovebox. In Phase I, BSI conducted cold testing with surrogate waste material to verify that the equipment, operating procedures, and test protocols would support testing with Pu- 238 in Phase II. The surrogate waste material is representative of known constituents of legacy job control waste.

The first simulant was an Osram Sylvania Phosphor 2284 C powder that fluoresces under ultraviolet light. The use of the fluorescent simulant allows rapid, inexpensive system startup testing because residuals can be assayed using a digital camera. The results of digital pixel analysis (DPA) are available immediately and do not require use of licensed material. The second simulant, which was used for integrated cold testing, was a <b>cerium</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>powder</b> that was activated in a research reactor neutron flux and assayed by photon spectroscopy. The surrogate transuranic (TRU) waste material was contaminated with Pu- 238 simulants and loaded into the cleaning chamber, where the surrogates were ultrasonically agitated and rinsed.

In particular, there is very limited understanding about the properties of <b>cerium</b> <b>oxide</b> and its potential use as a radical scavenger, and how the catalytic properties of <b>cerium</b> <b>oxide</b> change as the particle size approaches the nanoscale. For example, the involvement of Ce+ 4 and Ce+ 3 cations in reactions such as hydrogen peroxide decomposition have been investigated for both cerium cations and bulk <b>cerium</b> <b>oxide.</b> However, while both are assumed to decompose hydrogen peroxide through the same mechanism, whereby Ce+ 4 is involved in peroxide decomposition while Ce+ 3 is involved in radical scavenging, there has been very little done to address how the selectivity and activity of these reactions are affected by changing the majority cation population, as cerium cations in solution are predominantly in the + 3 oxidation state while cerium cations are predominantly in the + 4 oxidation state in <b>cerium</b> <b>oxide.</b> This matter is further complicated in <b>cerium</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles where the surface concentration of Ce+ 3 cations is increased due to particle curvature effects. Due to the potential of controlling the surface cerium oxidation state using particle size and using this control to change the catalytic properties, this project investigated the effect of particle size and composition and the activity and selectivity of <b>cerium</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles, and has served to expand {{the understanding of the}} properties of pure and mixed nanoparticle <b>cerium</b> <b>oxide.</b> This work explains the metric developed for measuring the catalytic properties of pure and mixed <b>cerium</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles, which is also good at predicting the immediate and long-term behavior of nanoparticles in hydrogen fuel cells.

It was found that the catalysts had significantly lower surface area than the <b>cerium</b> <b>oxide</b> grades they were based on, but that the high surface <b>cerium</b> <b>oxide</b> catalyst had a higher surface area than the one based on low surface <b>cerium</b> <b>oxide.</b> Surface area was also lost for the high surface catalyst from unused to used sample, while for the low surface catalyst the difference was minor. Crystallite sizes followed surface area and the higher the crystallite size, the lower the surface area. Pore structure was virtually wiped out during catalyst creation. SEM indicated differences in structure, with the low surface catalyst more or less retaining structure through use, while the high surface catalyst became more crystalline. Due to there not being a significant difference in deactivation between the high and low surface catalysts, the performance differences probably stems from properties before or after production. The cobalt aluminate phases were similar between the high surface and low surface catalysts, indicating no major difference in cobalt particle size, as confirmed by TEM. The exact reason why the high surface catalyst performs better is still unknown, but could stem from a better contact surface with the <b>cerium</b> <b>oxide,</b> given that the <b>cerium</b> oxide/cobalt <b>oxide</b> interphase itself has significant catalytic activity. Other reasons might be structural in the catalyst pellets themselves...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — An {{experimental}} {{investigation is}} carried out to establish the performance and emission characteristics of a compression ignition engine while using <b>cerium</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles as additive in neat diesel and diesel-biodiesel. In {{the first phase of}} the experiments, stability of neat diesel and diesel-biodiesel blends with the addition of <b>cerium</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles are analyzed. After series of experiments, it is found that the blends subjected to high speed blending followed by ultrasonic bath stabilization improves the stability. In the second phase, performance characteristics are studied using the stable fuel blends in a single cylinder four stroke engine. The <b>cerium</b> <b>oxide</b> acts as an oxygen donating catalyst and provides oxygen for the oxidation of CO or absorbs oxygen for the reduction of NOx. The activation energy of <b>cerium</b> <b>oxide</b> acts to burn off carbon deposits within the engine cylinder at the wall temperature and prevents the deposition of non-polar compounds on the cylinder wall results reduction in HC emissions. The tests revealed that <b>cerium</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles can be used as additive in diesel and diesel-biodiesel to improve complete combustion of the fuel and reduce the exhaust emissions significantly...|$|R
40|$|We exploit a precipitation-redispersion {{mechanism}} for complexation of short chain polyelectrolytes with <b>cerium</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles {{to extend their}} stability ranges. As synthesized, <b>cerium</b> <b>oxide</b> sols at pH 1. 4 consist of monodisperse cationic nanocrystalline particles having a hydrodynamic diameter of 10 nm and a molecular weight 400000 gmol- 1. We show that short chain uncharged poly(acrylic acid) at low pH when added to a <b>cerium</b> <b>oxide</b> sols leads to macroscopic precipitation. As the pH is increased, the solution spontaneously redisperses into a clear solution of single particles with an anionic poly(acrylic acid) corona. The structure and dynamics of <b>cerium</b> <b>oxide</b> nanosols and their hybrid polymer-inorganic complexes in solution are investigated by static and dynamic light scattering, X-ray scattering, and by chemical analysis. Quantitative analysis of the redispersed sol gives rise to an estimate of 40 - 50 polymer chains per particle for stable suspension. This amount represents 20 % {{of the mass of}} the polymer-nanoparticle complexes. This complexation adds utility to the otherwise unstable <b>cerium</b> <b>oxide</b> dispersions by extending the range of stability of the sols in terms of pH, ionic strength and concentration.

40|$|A {{solution}} precursor plasma spray (SPPS) {{technique has}} been used for direct deposition of <b>cerium</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles (CNPs) from various cerium salt solutions as precursors. Solution precursors were injected into the hot zone of a plasma plume to deposit CNP coatings. A numerical study of the droplet injection model has been employed for microstructure development during SPPS. The decomposition of each precursor to <b>cerium</b> <b>oxide</b> was analyzed by thermogravimetric-differential thermal analysis and validated by thermodynamic calculations. The presence of the <b>cerium</b> <b>oxide</b> phase in the coatings was confirmed by X-ray diffraction studies. Transmission electron microscopy studies confirmed nanocrystalline (grain size < 14 nm) characteristic of the coatings. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies indicated the presence of a high concentration of Ce 3 + (up to 0. 32) in the coating prepared by SPPS. The processing and microstructure evolution of <b>cerium</b> <b>oxide</b> coatings with high nonstoichiometry are reported...|$|R
