5|$|Ehlers' {{research}} {{was in the}} field of general relativity. In particular, he made contributions to cosmology, the theory of gravitational lenses and gravitational waves. His principal <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> to clarify general relativity's mathematical structure and its consequences, separating rigorous proofs from heuristic conjectures.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} minor {{problems}} surfaced, but were readily fixed. The yaw damper of the XF-104 {{was found to}} be ineffective and the rudder did not positively center, these problems were corrected by revising the rudder control system. The unpowered rudder did not provide adequate directional control at high air speeds (remedied by using hydraulic power on all subsequent versions of the F-104) and some <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> expressed over poor subsonic maneuverability at higher altitudes.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 800 {{students}} from both Platte Canyon High School {{and the nearby}} Fitzsimmons Middle School were rapidly evacuated. Morrison's demands were unknown, although police confirmed that his primary <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> a request {{for the police to}} back away. All students, except the hostages, were safely evacuated by 12:10 p.m. and by 3:00 p.m. all had been taken to Deer Creek Elementary School. Parents were able to gain little information from authorities, who remained silent regarding the issue while the crisis continued.|$|E

5|$|As governor, Wickliffe's primary <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> the Panic of 1837. He {{advocated}} raising {{property taxes}} to offset spending deficits that had climbed to $42,000 by 1839, but the legislature borrowed money {{to meet the}} current expenses instead. Wickliffe maintained the state's credit by paying the interest due on state securities. The only areas where he called for more spending were improvements in river navigation, preservation of state archives, and public education. Aside from these concerns, he was inundated with requests for clemency.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of McCarthy's speech, {{communism}} was a significant concern in the United States. This <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> exacerbated {{by the actions of}} the Soviet Union in Eastern Europe, the victory of the communists in the Chinese Civil War, the Soviets' development of a nuclear weapon the year before, and by the contemporary controversy surrounding Alger Hiss and the confession of Soviet spy Klaus Fuchs. With this background and due to the sensational nature of McCarthy's charge against the State Department, the Wheeling speech soon attracted a flood of press interest in McCarthy's claim.|$|E
5|$|By 1996 Widerøe had {{undertaken}} {{a series}} of operational amendments after recommendation from the commission, including a reorganization of the aircraft operation division, the quality insurance division and the company's reporting systems. Another <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> that pilots did not follow the company's routines, resulting in the company grounding about ten pilots which did not follow policy or did too many errors during observations. Some would be receive additional training while others would be retired. The company would further invest 40 million Norwegian krone (NOK) to improve safety.|$|E

5|$|Dennis's lack of <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> vindicated on Saturday, with Hamilton {{setting the}} fastest time in {{practice}} with a lap of 1:34.811. Massa finished the session {{a tenth of}} a second behind, with third placed Alonso a further half second behind. Kubica, Räikkönen, Rosberg and Heidfeld followed, with Super Aguri driver Anthony Davidson eighth fastest. Super Aguri are regarded as a sister team to the Honda F1 works team, who set only the 17th and 19th fastest times. The 2007 Super Aguri is widely thought to be an updated version of Honda's 2006 car.|$|E
5|$|Du Bois was bitterly {{disappointed}} {{that many of}} his colleaguesparticularly the NAACPdid not support him during his 1951 PIC trial, whereas working class whites and blacks supported him enthusiastically. After the trial, Du Bois lived in Manhattan, writing and speaking, and continuing to associate primarily with leftist acquaintances. His primary <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> world peace, and he railed against military actions, such as the Korean War, which he viewed as efforts by imperialist whites to maintain colored people in a submissive state.|$|E
5|$|During the Great Depression Flanders {{began to}} write about social policy. His major <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> human {{development}} in a technological era. He addressed employing spiritual guidance with a “program of human values” to achieve a good life. Nevertheless, his underlying goal was to achieve “full employment.” So, he kept himself grounded in economic principles, as understood and debated during that era.|$|E

The other groups are smaller: the Ugandan Lord's Resistance Army, the Ugandan rebel group the Allied Democratic Forces in the remote area of Mt Rwenzori, and the Burundian Parti pour la Libération du Peuple Hutu—Forces Nationales de Liberation (PALIPEHUTU-FNL).|$|E
5|$|Many traditions have {{stressed}} the grief of mothers over deprivation {{of their children}} but little has been said historically about young children's loss of their mothers; {{this may have been}} because loss of the mother in infancy frequently meant death for a breast-fed infant. In the 19th century, French society bureaucratised a system in which infants were breast-fed at the homes of foster mothers, returning to the biological family after weaning, and no <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> evinced at the possible effect of this double separation on the child.|$|E
5|$|Sigmund Freud {{may have}} been among the first to stress the {{potential}} effect of loss of the mother on the developing child, but his <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> less with the actual experience of maternal care than with the anxiety the child might feel about the loss of the nourishing breast. As little of Freud's theory was based on actual observations of infants, little effort was made to consider the effects of real experiences of loss.|$|E

5|$|The Eccles Spinning and Manufacturing Company {{came into}} being {{following}} a meeting called by the Mayor of Eccles, in which <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> expressed at the decline in local industry. Two earlier Eccles mills had been destroyed by fire, resulting in significant local unemployment. Designed by Potts, Son and Hennings of Manchester, Bolton and Oldham, it was opened in 1906. The imposing mill contained a multi-storey spinning mill, engine house and extensive weaving sheds.|$|E
5|$|To {{remedy the}} situation, one of McClellan's first orders upon taking command was to greatly expand the {{defenses}} of Washington. At all {{points of the}} compass, forts and entrenchments would be constructed in sufficient strength to defeat any attack. One area of particular <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> the region of Maryland south of the Anacostia River. Confederate artillery floated across the Potomac in secret and mounted south of the river could threaten the Washington Navy Yard and Washington Arsenal, both of which lay at the junction of the Potomac and Anacostia Rivers.|$|E
40|$|In {{the field}} of {{advanced}} separation of concerns, most researches focus on programming levels. On the other hand, many analysis/design techniques utilize separation of <b>concerns,</b> as it <b>is</b> {{one of the common}} techniques in the software engineering field. Though the utilization of these <b>concerns</b> <b>is</b> slightly different from that in programming level techniques dealing with advanced separation of <b>concerns,</b> it <b>is</b> important to recognize what kinds of <b>concerns</b> <b>are</b> used in the analysis/design field, and to clarify the current issues. In this paper, we analyze the concerns in the analysis/design field, observe the current status of separation of concerns, and discuss issues and future research directions. 1. CONCERNS IN ANALYSIS/DESIGN TECHNIQUES Separation of <b>concerns</b> <b>is</b> one of the basic techniques in software engineering fields, and many analysis/design techniques apply the technique.

Yonekura was aware that the Australians had reached Kaiapit but his main <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> not {{to be caught in}} the open by Allied aircraft. Spotting Australian positions in the pre-dawn light, the Japanese column opened fire. A torrent of fire descended on the Australians, who replied sporadically, attempting to conserve their ammunition. Although he was running low on ammunition, King launched an immediate counter-attack on the Japanese, which took them by surprise.|$|E

The team's main <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> adding new features and refinements to the original gameplay, and improving the story, which had received criticism from fans. To this end, writer Shin Kibayashi was brought in. To show {{all sides of the}} story and provide players with different Fire Emblem experiences, the game was split up into multiple versions. Upon release, it met with highly positive reviews: Birthright was generally seen as a good starting place for new players, Conquest was praised for its challenge, while Revelation was noted as a good middle ground between the two releases.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} how the direct activation of relational versus instrumental concerns affects reactions to {{decisions made by}} an authority. It is demonstrated that when instrumental <b>concerns</b> <b>are</b> experimentally induced, people's evaluations of the authority (Studies 1 and 2) {{as well as their}} intentions to protest (Study 3) are more strongly affected by how the procedures used by the authority affect anticipated outcomes (i. e., whether procedures are favorably or unfavorably inaccurate) than when relational <b>concerns</b> <b>are</b> activated. By contrast, authority evaluations (Study 2) and protest intentions (Study 3) are more strongly affected by whether procedures used are fair (accurate) or unfair (inaccurate) when relational (versus instrumental) <b>concerns</b> <b>are</b> activated. These findings extend previous research where relational versus instrumental <b>concerns</b> <b>were</b> inferred, but not directly examined, to explain differences in responses to authorities' decisions...|$|R
40|$|A {{software}} modification task often addresses several <b>concerns.</b> A <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> anything a stakeholder {{may want}} to consider as a conceptual unit, including features, nonfunctional requirements, and design idioms. In many cases, the source code implementing a <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> not encapsulated in a single programming language module, and is instead scattered and tangled throughout a system. Inadequate separation of concerns increases the difficulty of evolving software in a correct and costeffective manner. To make it easier to modify <b>concerns</b> that <b>are</b> not well modularized, we propose an approach in which the implementation of <b>concerns</b> <b>is</b> documented in artifacts, called concern graphs. <b>Concern</b> graphs <b>are</b> abstract models that describe which parts of the source code are relevant to different concerns. We present a formal model for concern graphs and the tool support we developed to enable software developers to create and use concern graphs during software evolution tasks. We report on five empirical studies, providing evidence that concern graphs support views and operations that facilitate the task of modifying the code implementing scattered <b>concerns,</b> <b>are</b> costeffectiv...|$|R
40|$|Separation of <b>concerns</b> <b>is</b> a {{fundamental}} principle of software engineering. Of course, <b>concerns</b> <b>are</b> modeled {{in a variety}} of guises in contemporary software development, but the modeling approaches used typically depend on the development method, development stage, artifact formalism, and other project-specific factors. Concerns in various representations are also the focus of aspect-oriented software development (AOSD) techniques. However, <b>concerns</b> as such <b>are</b> still not modeled independently, and concernmodeling is still not a distinguished activity in software development. In this chapter we argue that <b>concerns</b> must <b>be</b> first-class entities and <b>concern</b> modeling must <b>be</b> a first-class activity in AOSD. That <b>is,</b> <b>concern</b> modeling should <b>be</b> an explicit and integral part of AOSD methods, and <b>concerns</b> should <b>be</b> modeled in their own appropriate formalisms, separately from their representations in requirements, design, code, and other software artifacts. We discuss the meaning of concern and consider the characteristic...|$|R
