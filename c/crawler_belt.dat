40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} improve the {{technical}} level, perforation efficiency and ability of LWD- 200 B full hydraulic open cut mine drill {{to adapt to the}} complex geological conditions, we developed LWD- 200 B multi-function full hydraulic open cut mine drill, the drill has rotary cutting, impact and roller bit drill three functions. The drill travel use hydraulic motor to drive <b>crawler</b> <b>belt</b> running gear, low speed high torque hydraulic motor to direct top drive drilling rod. Pressure and lifting system use a long stroke hydraulic cylinder, wire rope and pulley mechanism, load sensing constant power variable pump, load sensing electromagnetic proportional multi-way directional valve. The control system uses electronic control handle and PLC controller, design pressure, speed, length, temperature sensors etc. and GPS base station, with real-time data acquisition, display, lithology automatic identification, closed-loop feedback control, GPS precise positioning, the manual and automatic drilling, specified depth or level drilling function. It applies to drilling diameter 150 mm ~ 200 mm blast hole in various types of open pit mine...|$|E
40|$|The article {{offered for}} {{consideration}} provides {{a survey of}} methods to study a tracked vehicle movement over unpaved grounds and obstacles using various software systems. The relevant issue is to optimize chassis elements of a caterpillar at the design stage. The challenges, engineers face using different methods to study the tracked vehicle elements, are given. Advantages of using simulation to study {{a state of the}} various components of the loaded chassis are described. Beside, an important and relevant issue is brought up i. e. modeling a vehicle movement in real time. While writing an article, different modeling methods for an interaction between a tracked vehicle chassis and an underlying subgrade used both in domestic and in foreign practice have been analysed. The applied analytical assumptions in creating these models and their basic elements are described. The way to specify an interaction between the track and road wheels of a caterpillar, <b>crawler</b> <b>belt</b> specification, and interaction between its elements have been analysed in detail as well. Special attention was also paid to the various ways of specifying the subgrade both in planar models and in models enabling us to study all chassis elements of a caterpillar as a whole. In addition to the classical simulation of tracked vehicle movement used to analyse Ride qualities of tracked vehicle and loaded state of various chassis elements, is offered a model used to simulate a movement coil in real time. The article presents advantages and disadvantages of different models of movement in terms of engineering analysis of caterpillar elements. A task to develop a simulation model of caterpillar movement is set. Requirements for a model in case of its use in engineering analysis of chassis elements of a caterpillar are defined. A problem of a lack of the single technique to conduct engineering analysis of tracked vehicle chassis is noted. Â </p...|$|E
