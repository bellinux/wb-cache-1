5|$|Spherical coordinates, {{known as}} {{ecliptic}} longitude and latitude or <b>celestial</b> <b>longitude</b> and latitude, {{are used to}} specify positions of bodies on the celestial sphere {{with respect to the}} ecliptic. Longitude is measured positively eastward 0° to 360° along the ecliptic from the vernal equinox, the same direction in which the Sun appears to move. Latitude is measured perpendicular to the ecliptic, to +90° northward or -90° southward to the poles of the ecliptic, the ecliptic itself being 0° latitude. For a complete spherical position, a distance parameter is also necessary. Different distance units are used for different objects. Within the Solar System, astronomical units are used, and for objects near Earth, Earth radii or kilometers are used. A corresponding right-handed rectangular coordinate system is also used occasionally; the x-axis is directed toward the vernal equinox, the y-axis 90° to the east, and the z-axis toward the north ecliptic pole; the astronomical unit is the unit of measure. Symbols for ecliptic coordinates are somewhat standardized; see the table.|$|E
25|$|This house {{system was}} {{described}} by the English astrologer Charles E. O. Carter (1887-1968) in his Essays on the Foundations of Astrology. The house division starts at the right ascension of the ascendant and to it is added 30º of right ascension for each successive cusp. Those cusps are then restated in terms of <b>celestial</b> <b>longitude</b> by projecting them along great circles containing the North and South celestial poles. The 1st house cusp coincides with the ascendant's longitude, but the 10th house cusp is not identical with the Midheaven.|$|E
25|$|An {{armillary sphere}} (variations {{are known as}} spherical astrolabe, armilla, or armil) {{is a model of}} objects in the sky (in the {{celestial}} sphere), consisting of a spherical framework of rings, centred on Earth or the Sun, that represent lines of <b>celestial</b> <b>longitude</b> and latitude and other astronomically important features such as the ecliptic. As such, it differs from a celestial globe, which is a smooth sphere whose principal purpose is to map the constellations. It was invented separately in ancient Greece and ancient China, with later use in the Islamic world and Medieval Europe.|$|E
50|$|Having {{established}} the relative {{positions of the}} signs in the houses, the astrologer positions the sun, moon, and planets at their proper <b>celestial</b> <b>longitudes.</b> Some astrologers also take note of minor planetary bodies, fixed stars, asteroids (for example, Chiron) and other mathematically calculated points and angles such as the vertex, equatorial ascendant, etc. Many astrologers also use what are {{commonly referred to as}} Arabic parts (or Greek Lots), the most common of which is the Part of Fortune (Pars Fortunae).|$|R
40|$|Astronomical {{observations}} {{were used as}} a marker for time and the Calendar from ancient times. A more subtle calibration of epochs is thrown up by an observation {{of the position of}} the solstices and equinoxes, because these points shift in the sky with the years resulting in the gradual shift of <b>celestial</b> <b>longitudes</b> λ. Chronology based on such observations however needs to be backed up by hard evidence. We match both to take us back to 10, 000 B.

2500|$|Ophiuchus {{is one of}} {{thirteen}} constellations that cross the ecliptic. It has therefore been called the [...] "13th sign of the zodiac". However, this confuses sign with constellation. The signs of the zodiac are a twelve-fold division of the ecliptic, so that each sign spans 30° of <b>celestial</b> <b>longitude,</b> approximately the distance the Sun travels in a month, and (in the Western tradition) are aligned with the seasons so that the March equinox always falls on the boundary between Pisces and Aries.|$|E
2500|$|Pisces (♓) ( [...] , pis'eez; [...] Ikhthyes) is {{the twelfth}} astrological {{sign in the}} Zodiac, {{originating}} from the Pisces constellation. It spans the 330° to 360° of the zodiac, between 332.75° and 360° of <b>celestial</b> <b>longitude.</b> Under the tropical zodiac the sun transits this area on average between February 19 and March 20, and under the sidereal zodiac, the sun transits this area between approximately March 13 and April 13.

2500|$|The aspects are {{the angles}} the planets make {{to each other}} in the horoscope, and also to the ascendant, midheaven, {{descendant}} and nadir.

They indicate focal points in the horoscope where the energies involved are given extra emphasis.

40|$|At {{the end of}} 1992, the Pioneer 10, Pioneer 11, and Voyager 2 {{spacecraft}} were at heliocentric {{distances of}} 56. 0, 37. 3, and 39. 0 AU and heliographic latitudes of 3. 3 deg N, 17. 4 deg N, and 8. 6 deg S, respectively. Pioneer 11 and Voyager 2 are at similar <b>celestial</b> <b>longitudes,</b> while Pioneer 10 is {{on the opposite side}} of the Sun. All three spacecraft have working plasma analyzers, so intercomparison of data from these spacecraft provides important information about the global character of the solar wind in the outer heliosphere. The averaged solar wind speed continued to exhibit its well-known variation with solar cycle: Even at heliocentric distances greater than 50 AU, the average speed is highest during the declining phase of the solar cycle and lowest near solar minimum. There was a strong latitudinal gradient in solar wind speed between 3 deg and 17 deg N during the last solar minimum, but this gradient has since disappeared. The solar wind temperature declined with increasing heliocentric distance out to a heliocentric distance of at least 20 AU; this decline appeared to continue at larger heliocentric distances, but temperatures in the outer heliosphere were suprisingly high. While Pioneer 10 and Voyager 2 observed comparable solar wind temperatures, the temperature at Pioneer 11 was significantly higher, which suggests the existence of a large-scale variation of temperature with heliographic longitude. There was also some suggestion that solar wind temperatures were higher near solar minimum...|$|R

50|$|In <b>celestial</b> mechanics, the <b>longitude</b> of the {{periapsis}} (symbolized ϖ) of an orbiting body is the longitude (measured {{from the}} point of the vernal equinox) at which the periapsis (closest approach to the central body) would occur if the body's inclination were zero. For the motion of a planet around the Sun, this position is called longitude of perihelion ϖ, which is the sum of the longitude of the ascending node Ω, and the argument of perihelion ω. The longitude of periapsis is a compound angle, with part of it being measured in the plane of reference and the rest being measured in the plane of the orbit. Likewise, any angle derived from the longitude of periapsis (e.g. mean longitude and true longitude) will also be compound.|$|R
