40|$|In {{the recent}} years, vehicle-environment {{modeling}} techniques and powerful simulation tools {{have been used}} exhaustively to design wheeled rovers. In spite of that, rover preliminary design is still very dependent on human designer. It is also wellknown that human analysis of a complex vehicle dynamics is very time consuming, which implies in a simplified analysis {{of just a few}} useful operating conditions. It compels strict achievement of requirements without a deeper investigation of performance optimization potential during preliminary design phase. Our in-house developed rover optimization tool allow us to achieve a reasonable configuration having mobility and locomotion requirements and a given suspension concept as inputs. It reduced drastically the time usually devoted to synthesize some rover parametric configuration. We show the result of an optimized ExoMars rover under our scenario-oriented multi-objective optimization concept. The results are assessed through parameter variation studies to evaluate: allowable volume to place the center of mass of the vehicle, sensitivity analysis, Pareto frontier relating important metrics two by two, and figures of merit illustrating mapping of the design parameters into the criteria space. This research generates two branches of special interest: applicability of the current results (other than straight forward construction of the obtained suspension); and further development of the optimization tool. The current results {{can be applied to the}} selection of candidate actuator designs for example. It can be done by observation of the torque profiles of the vehicle's wheels as the vehicle drives on complex terrain in a simulation. This is used to evaluate candidate actuator design concepts which make the vehicle faster but at the same time do not enforce it to underperform in critical scenarios. Currently, our tool is able to perform geometric configuration optimization. But the results have shown that performance improvement is still possible according to the design of wheels, bogies and their mechanical connections (suspension). Optimization of locomotion components individually (e. g. topology optimization) and suspension <b>concept</b> <b>synthesis</b> are also discussed as means to enhance performance. Strategies still have to be investigated in order to define connection constraints in a suspension <b>concept</b> <b>synthesis.</b> This work summarizes results of a four-year research, but it can also be considered as the beginning of a second major step in the development of a fully automatized scenario-oriented tool to achieve complete rover synthesis including suspension <b>concept</b> <b>synthesis,</b> geometric configuration optimization, and component optimization...|$|E

Introduction: Health policy advocates that {{professionals}} involve parents in care and care decisions, yet models advocating involvement are not embedded into practice. Aim: Identify the shared antecedents and key attributes associated with embedding family-centred care (FCC) and partnership-in-care (PiC) into practice. Methods: A <b>concept</b> <b>synthesis</b> was undertaken by searching three databases (Scopus, CINAHL, BNI 1999 - 2014); shared antecedents and attributes were extrapolated from the 30 studies that met defined inclusion criteria. Results: Unclear roles and boundaries, entrenched professional practices and lack of guidelines hinder FCC/PiC implementation. An alternative framework was developed based on the actions and skills required to support parents’ involvement in care and care decisions. Discussion: Greater focus on the skills required to facilitate involvement may negate the challenges of embedding FCC/PiC.

To elucidate the mechanism of the thinking process in creative design, a series of experiments were carried out. Design tasks were selected for two different kinds of <b>concept</b> <b>synthesis,</b> with a high or a low number of associations. Protocol analysis was adopted to analyze how designers conceive other concepts during the design process. Ten design concepts by five subjects were evaluated by nine evaluators from two angles: sense and originality. Nouns, adjectives, and verbs were extracted from the protocols of each subject and divided into seven categories of associative concepts. All subjects except one subject showed higher creativity in Task B, which had a high number of associative concepts, than in Task A, with a low number of associative concepts. Given this, associating many action concepts with connect concepts in thematic relationships leads to design creativity...|$|E

40|$|Synthesis is {{a widely}} applied {{problem-solving}} approach of mature engineering disciplines including the sub-processes of technical problem analysis, identification and composition of solution domain concepts, and alternative-space analysis.

40|$|We {{propose the}} <b>concept,</b> <b>synthesis,</b> analysis, {{and design of}} graphene-based {{plasmonic}} tunable low-pass filters operating in the THz band. The proposed structure is composed of a graphene strip transferred onto a dielectric {{and a set of}} polysilicon DC gating pads located beneath it. This structure implements a stepped impedance low-pass filter for the propagating surface plasmons by adequately controlling the guiding properties of each strip section through graphene's field effect. A synthesis procedure is presented to design filters with desired specifications in terms of cut-off frequency, in-band performance, and rejection characteristics. The electromagnetic modeling of the structure is efficiently performed by combining an electrostatic scaling law to compute the guiding features of each strip section with a transmission line and transfer-matrix framework, approach further validated via full wave simulations. The performance of the proposed filters is evaluated in practical scenarios, taking into account the presence of the gating bias and the influence of graphene's losses. These results, together with the high miniaturization associated with plasmonic propagation, are very promising for the future use and integration of the proposed filters with other graphene and silicon-based elements in innovative THz communication systems.

40|$|Annotation Enrichment Analysis is {{a widely}} used {{analytical}} methodology to process data generated by high-throughput genomic and proteomic experiments such as gene expression microarrays. The analysis uncovers and summarizes discriminating background information for sets of genes identified by the previous processing stages (e. g., a set of differentially expressed genes, a cluster). Enrichment analysis algorithms attach annotations to the genes and then discover statistical fluctuations of individual annotation terms in a given gene subset. The annotation terms represent different aspects of biological knowledge and come from databases such as GO, BIND, KEGG. Typical statistical models used to detect enrichments or depletions of annotation terms are hypergeometric, binomial and X 2. At the end, the discovered information is utilized by human experts to find biological interpretations of the experiments. The main drawback of AEA is that it isolates and tests for overrepresentation of isolated individual annotation terms or groups of similar terms. As a result, AEA is limited {{in its ability to}} uncover complex phenomena involving relationships between multiple annotation terms from various knowledge bases. Also, AEA assumes that annotations describe the whole object of interest, which makes it difficult to apply it to sets of compound objects (e. g., sets of protein-protein interactions) and to sets of objects having an internal structure (e. g., protein complexes). To overcome this shortcoming, we propose a novel logic-based Annotation <b>Concept</b> <b>Synthesis</b> and Enrichment Analysis (ACSEA) approach. In this approach, the source annotation information, experimental data and uncovered enriched annotations are represented as First-Order Logic (FOL) statements. ACSEA uses the fusion of inductive logic reasoning with statistical inference to uncover more complex phenomena captured by the experiments. The proposed paradigm allows a synthesis of enriched annotation concepts that better describe the observed biological processes. The methodological advantage of Annotation <b>Concept</b> <b>Synthesis</b> and Enrichment Analysis is six-fold. Firstly, it is easier to represent complex, structural annotation information. Information already captured and formalized in OWL and RDF knowledge bases can be directly utilized. Secondly, it is possible to synthesize and analyze complex annotation concepts. Thirdly, it is possible to perform the enrichment analysis for sets of aggregate objects (such as sets of genetic interactions, physical protein-protein interactions or sets of protein complexes). Fourthly, annotation concepts are straightforward to interpret by a human expert. Fifthly, the logic data model and logic induction are a common platform that can integrate specialized analytical tools (e. g. tools for numerical, structural and sequential analysis). Sixthly, used statistical inference methods are robust on noisy and incomplete data, scalable and trusted by human experts in the field. In this thesis we developed and implemented the ACSEA approach. We evaluate it on large-scale datasets from several microarray experiments and on a clustered genome-wide genetic interaction network using different biological knowledge bases. Also, we define a statistical model of experimental and annotation data and evaluate ACSEA on synthetic datasets. The discovered interpretations are more enriched in terms of P- and Q-values than the interpretations found by AEA, are highly integrative in nature, and include analysis of quantitative and structured information present in the knowledge bases. The results suggest that ACSEA can significantly boost the effectiveness of the processing of high-throughput experiment data...|$|E

40|$|In this {{research}} program, Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) is collaborating with Texas A and M University {{in the development}} of highly selective inorganic ion exchangers for the removal of cesium and strontium from nuclear tank-waste and from groundwater. Inorganic ion exchangers are developed and characterized at Texas A and M University; ORNL is involved in preparing the powders in engineered forms and testing the performance of the sorbents in actual nuclear waste solutions. The Texas A and M studies are divided into two main categories: (1) exchangers for tank wastes and (2) exchangers for groundwater remediation. These are subdivided into exchangers for use in acid and alkaline solutions for tank wastes and those that can be recycled for use in groundwater remediation. The exchangers will also be considered for in situ immobilization of radionuclides. The approach will involve a combination of exchanger synthesis, structural characterization, and ion exchange behavior. ORNL has developed a technique for preparing inorganic ion exchangers in the form of spherules by a gel-sphere internal gelation process. This technology, which was developed and used for making nuclear fuels, has the potential of greatly enhancing the usability of many other special inorganic materials because of the improved flow dynamics of the spherules. Also, pure inorganic spherules can be made without the use of binders. ORNL also has access to actual nuclear waste in the form of waste tank supernatant solutions for testing the capabilities of the sorbents for removing the cesium and strontium radionuclides from actual waste solutions. The ORNL collaboration will involve the preparation of the powdered ion exchangers, developed and synthesized at Texas A and M, in the form of spherules, and evaluating the performance of the exchangers in real nuclear waste solutions. Selected sorbents will be provided by Texas A and M for potential incorporation into microspheres, and the performance of the sorbents and microspheres will be examined using actual waste supernatant solutions. This collaborative program could potentially take an exchanger from <b>concept,</b> <b>synthesis,</b> structure determination, and elucidation of exchange mechanism, to engineered product and testing on real waste streams. ...|$|E
40|$|A Case-Study Analysis of Design Heuristics in an Upper-Level Cross-Disciplinary Design CourseDesign Heuristics is {{a design}} {{ideation}} tool drawn from empirical evidence including observationsof professional designers and analyses of award-winning products. Design Heuristics cardsprovide strategies for generating alternative designs during concept ideation. The motivation forthis research {{study was to}} investigate how Design Heuristics were utilized by novice designersworking in cross-disciplinary teams. We were interested in exploring the practical elementssupported by heuristic use {{and the degree to which}} heuristic use made an impact throughout thedesign processes of cross-disciplinary design teams. In our investigation, we also saw successesand challenges in the teams’ design processes, including patterns in the way team membersdeveloped, transferred, and synthesized their concepts. These patterns highlight importantfeatures of successful team concept generation and development. Using a case-study framework, we followed the design processes of eight cross-disciplinarystudent design teams enrolled in a semester-long upper-level design course. The teamsindividually chose their design projects based on their interests and preliminary research. In aclass session at the beginning of the term, the teams were taught how to use the DesignHeuristics cards, and were then asked to use the cards in the preliminary concept generationphase of their design projects. We collected copies of these preliminary concepts, and continuedto collect data in the form of reports throughout the semester at the Proposal milestone, theProgress Report milestone, and the Final Report milestone of the course. Using the data collectedat these three stages, we created “timelines” detailing each team’s progression through the designprocess. We analyzed these timelines for evidence of heuristic use that was present in the initialconcepts and carried through the design process to the final design. In performing this analysis,we also noticed patterns in the synthesis of concepts at various phases in the design process. Wealso saw how the teams transferred ideas when moving from one design process phase toanother. Our analysis revealed that all eight teams showed strong evidence of heuristic use in their latterdesigns following their initial heuristic-driven ideation session. Of these, seven teams showedstrong evidence of heuristic use in their final designs and prototypes. Because all eight teamsstudied were working on different design problems, our results demonstrate that heuristics workeffectively across different design contexts. This suggests that the Design Heuristics cardssupport practicality in a variety of design contexts and that heuristics can be utilized by novicedesigners and design teams to generate innovative solutions to a range of design problems. Our analysis also uncovered patterns in the way the teams progressed with their ideas throughthe design process. Seven of the eight teams studied showed evidence of <b>concept</b> <b>synthesis</b> intheir design processes. All eight teams showed evidence of direct transfer between designprocess phases at some point, meaning that they took their ideas, concepts, or prototypes fromone phase of the design process and transferred them directly and without abstraction to anotherphase.
