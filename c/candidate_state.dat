5|$|<b>Candidate</b> <b>state</b> {{reptiles}} are not {{assured of}} making it through the legislative process. In Minnesota, 1998 and 1999 bills proposing the Blanding's turtle were unsuccessful. In Pennsylvania in 2009, the House passed an eastern box turtle bill which died in the Senate without a vote. Virginia proponents of the eastern box turtle have seen 1999 and 2009 bids fail. For the most recent attempt, a legislative opponent of the turtle {{said it was too}} cowardly for the state because of its defensive shell, and suggested the rattlesnake would be a better representative. The turtle also drew scorn for often perishing on roads, but its most serious problem was a too-close association with bordering state, North Carolina.|$|E

Angelle remained {{silent on the}} race and refused to endorse either <b>candidate.</b> <b>State</b> Treasurer John Neely Kennedy, a 2004 Democratic opponent of Vitter, called upon Angelle {{to join him in}} endorsing Vitter. Remaining silent, said Kennedy, is the equivalent of an endorsement of Edwards. Angelle spokesman Ryan Cross responded to Kennedy's accusations saying “John Kennedy is confused. He is the eternal president of the RINO club. He endorsed John Kerry for President , who fought to kill the Keystone pipeline; he’s run statewide as a liberal Democrat twice; and he’s been all over the map on issues like the minimum wage, abortion, and tax increases.” ...|$|E

40|$|Although European shared norms can be {{identified}} through the Copenhagen Criteria, few scholars have examined what methods the European Union employs to ensure norm diffusion. This study examines the impact of EU norm diffusion on both member and <b>candidate</b> <b>states.</b> The European Union faces two different situations when it seeks to diffuse norms: targeting <b>candidate</b> <b>states</b> to ensure the adoption of shared European norms or targeting member states to ensure the adoption of specific norms. This paper argues that by utilizing the accession process, the European Union is actually better able to influence <b>candidate</b> <b>states</b> that wish to become members than current member states...|$|R

The situation that makes this issue important is the influence of membership of the <b>candidate</b> <b>states</b> on the voting power distribution. With the enlargements, European Union decision-making processes were regulated several times. The last regulation to the European Union voting system was brought by the Treaty of Lisbon. In this study, voting power distribution in Council of the European Union is evaluated for <b>candidate</b> <b>states</b> and member states considering the acts adopted by the Treaty of Lisbon and determined as <b>candidate</b> <b>states</b> determined as Turkey, Croatia, Iceland, Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. In the analysis, member states are grouped the according to the enlargement of the EU and the effect of the states that take part in these groups on the decision and changes of voting power are calculated using Banzhaf power index for power measurement...|$|R

40|$|In the European Union (EU) {{accession}} {{process the}} EU tries to transfer EU rules to the <b>candidate</b> <b>states</b> through conditionality. The acquis legislation and laws are {{not hard to}} implement and therefore almost all <b>candidate</b> <b>states</b> did comply with {{this part of the}} acquis. However, there is a second element of the acquis, the democratic conditionality, concerning the fundamental political principles of the EU, the norms of human rights and liberal democracy. According to the EU one of those fundamental political principles is the need to curb corruption. In what way is the EU capable of influencing the anti-corruption policy of the <b>candidate</b> <b>states?</b> Is the EU thereby affecting corruption in the <b>candidate</b> <b>states?</b> In this thesis the role of the EU on the candidate states’ anti-corruption policy is tested. Is there any relation between the role of the EU, compliance of the member states and the real level of corruption? Statistical analysis and five short case studies show that {{there is a difference between}} simple rules, laws on corruption on the one hand and perceived corruption in a state on the other. The two are not related per se and therefore the EU influence in fundamentally curbing corruption is limited. The only way corruption can be stopped is when EU efforts are back upped by national actors...|$|R
40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{disturbance}} by measurements which unambiguously discriminate between given <b>candidate</b> <b>states.</b> We prove {{that such an}} optimal measurement necessarily changes distinguishable states indistinguishable when the inconclusive outcome is obtained. The result was previously shown by Chefles~[Phys. Lett. A 239, 339 (1998) ] under restrictions on the class of quantum measurements and on the definition of optimality. Our theorems remove these restrictions and are also applicable to infinitely many <b>candidate</b> <b>states.</b> Combining with our previous results, one can obtain concrete mathematical conditions for the resulting states. The method may have {{a wide variety of}} applications in contexts other than state discrimination...|$|R

40|$|In this article, {{we assume}} that we can usefully examine the {{emergence}} of party‐based Euroscepticism in the party systems of the <b>candidate</b> <b>states</b> {{and that we can}} account for (some of) the differences between the states by looking at their party systems. In order to do this we begin by offering a definition of Euroscepticism that differentiates between ‘hard’ and ‘soft’ variants. We map these types of Euroscepticism in parties in the <b>candidate</b> <b>states</b> of central and Eastern Europe. Looking at the nature of party systems we suggest {{that there is a need}} to rethink how we conceptualise and categorise them if we are to extend our Western models to central and Eastern Europe, and we offer some suggestions of how this might be done. Using these models of party systems in relation to the <b>candidate</b> <b>states</b> of central and Eastern Europe we examine how this relates to the incidences of party‐based Euroscepticism and reflect on the issues involved in applying West European models to East European cases...|$|R
