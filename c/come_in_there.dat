5|$|In chess a minor {{material}} advantage is important as when material gets exchanged, the relative advantage becomes larger. Because new pieces <b>come</b> <b>in,</b> <b>there</b> is no endgame play in bughouse and material is therefore less important. It {{is common to}} sacrifice pieces in bughouse while attacking, defending or hunting down a certain piece which the partner requires.|$|E
500|$|On the regimental left {{along the}} main Pugong-ni-Changnyong road North Korean {{soldiers}} completely overran C Company by 0300 September 1. Only seven men of C Company could be accounted for, and three days later, after all the stragglers and those cut off behind North Korean lines had <b>come</b> <b>in,</b> <b>there</b> were only 20 men in the company. As the North Korean attack developed during the night, 1st Battalion succeeded in withdrawing {{a large part of}} its force, less C Company, just north of Lake U-p'o and the hills there covering the northern road into Changnyong, [...] east of the river and [...] west of the town. B Company lost heavily in this action.|$|E
500|$|Berkowitz (real name Scott Putesky) later {{claimed to}} have been [...] "shut out" [...] of {{recording}} sessions, and alleged that other band members destroyed much of his equipment—the four-track recorder, which had been used to produce many of the band's early demos, had been microwaved, and his drum machine had been discarded. The latter was subsequently revealed to have been thrown from a second-story window. He was also highly critical of Reznor, whom he alleged destroyed a Fender Jaguar which had been given to him by his father as a child, saying: [...] "I was in the studio, and they were all in the control room, and I'm playing guitar. At the end, Trent says, 'Do it again, but do it more like this.' We went through this three times, and he says, 'Hold on. I'll <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>there.</b> Let me show you what I'm talking about.' So I take my guitar off, hand it to him—and he smashes it, just to fuck with me. Then he laughed and left the room." ...|$|E

60|$|I stirred him {{a little}} to see if I could get him out, and he essayed to get up, but {{was not able to}} raise himself; and I thought with myself, he might even lie there; for if he had frightened me so, he would {{certainly}} fright, any of the savages, if any of them should be so hardy as to <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>there,</b> while he had any life in him.|$|E
