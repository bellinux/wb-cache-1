40|$|Afromosia Pericopsis elata is a timber-producing species {{native to}} <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> west and central Africa {{occurring}} in the Guinean Equatorial forests. It has a disjunct distribution with several isolated sub-populations occurring in Cote d’Ivoire and Ghana; Central African Republic (CAR), eastern Cameroon and Congo; and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Details of {{the ecology of the}} species remain poorly known. Pericopsis elata is currently classified as Endangered by IUCN. Declines as a result of logging in Cote d’Ivoire, Ghana and Nigeria have been marked since international trade began 50 years ago. Significant stocks do however remain in Cameroon, Congo and DRC where the forests are more extensive and logging of this species has been more recent. Legislative and administrative procedures are in place to manage the forests in the countries where Pericopsis elata occurs but problems of implementation and enforcement remain. The extent to which general forestry provisions are used to fulfill CITES Article IV requirements of CITES remains unclear. The development of clear procedures for making CITES non-detriment findings in compliance with Article IV remains a priority in the main <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> <b>export.</b> The establishment <b>of</b> a national <b>export</b> quota for each exporting country based on information on the distributional range of the species combined with information on the abundance or stocks of the species in different areas would be one approach. Such a quota would mean that the country concerned had determined that the <b>export</b> <b>of</b> a certain amount of specimens per year would not be detrimental to the survival of the species. Under such circumstances, the Management Authority would not need to consult the Scientific Authority for each export, although it should have consulted the Scientific Authority before it established an export quota.

Likewise, countervailing measures are imposed on subsidised imports found to be injuring an industry in Australia. Countervailing measures are similar to anti-dumping duties in theirapplication. These measures are founded on the application of international public trade laws, notably Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1947 (GATT), relating to "unfair" trading practices. < The principal question which this paper addresses is: Has the application of these economic laws been "fair" and wealth creating"...|$|E

Most exporters now file the required documents via the Automated Export System. Because of filing options, {{for the majority}} of exporters, we have no information on &quot;low-valued &quot; exports (LVEs), those valued at or below the exemption level of $ 2, 500; for the remainder, we have records for all LVEs. As exporters are not required to report their LVEs, the Census Bureau estimates the low-valued component for any country by multiplying its total of exports valued over $ 2, 500 by a pre-determined factor. This factor, specific to the <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>export,</b> was determined in the late 1980 's based on data collected up to that point in time.

40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{conceptual}} framework and methodology for studying virtual water trade. We utilize complex network theory {{to analyze the}} structure of the global virtual water trade associated with the international food trade. In the global virtual water trade network, the nations that participate in the international food trade correspond to the nodes, and the links represent the flows of virtual water associated with the trade of food from the <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>export</b> to the country of import. We find that the number of trade connections follows an exponential distribution, except for the case of import trade relationships, while the volume of water that each nation trades compares well with a stretched exponential distribution, indicating high heterogeneity of flows between nations. There is a power law relationship between the volume of virtual water traded and the number of trade connections of each nation. Highly connected nations are preferentially linked to poorly connected nations and exhibit low levels of clustering. However, when the volume of virtual water traded is taken into account, this structure breaks down. This indicates a global hierarchy, in which nations that trade large volumes of water are more likely to link to and cluster with other nations that trade large volumes of water, particularly when the direction of trade is considered. Nations that {{play a critical role in}} maintaining the global network architecture are highlighted. Our analysis provides the necessary framework for the development of a model of global virtual water trade aimed at applications ranging from network optimization to climate change impact evaluations...|$|E

Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Includes bibliographical references (page 46). A freight forwarder, forwarder, or forwarding agent is a person or company that organizes shipments for individuals or corporations to get goods from the manufacturer or producer to a market, customer or final point of distribution. Forwarders contract with a carrier to move the goods. A forwarder does not move the goods but acts as an expert in supply chain management. A forwarder contracts with carriers to move cargo ranging from raw agricultural products to manufactured goods. Information typically reviewed by a freight forwarder includes the commercial invoice, shipper's export declaration, bill of lading and other documents required by the carrier or <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>export,</b> import, and/or transhipment. Nowadays, the freight forwarding is not limited within the same geographical limit of any country. Due to globalization and free market economy, this industry is facing severe competition. As the competition among companies are rapidly increasing, many companies are trying to provide distinct services in terms of air freight forwarding, sea freight forwarding, customs brokerage, consolidation, logistics management, Off-Dock services, household removal, transportation and so on. Novo Cargo is totally committed to provide a total transportation services to their clients irrespective {{of the size of}} consignment. They plan, coordinate, supervise, document and monitor the entire movement system of consignment. As Freight forwarding and logistics service sector is gradually developing to be a huge service sector so I am glad {{to have an opportunity to}} work in Novo cargo Services Ltd. to explore their activities and build up an analytical insight regarding their services. As important freight forwarding and logistics services, Off-Dock offers entire item-wise package of service activities for handling the temporary empty/laden container storage, loading/unloading general export/import goods, and containers under custom clearance. It is an equivalent of a seaport located in the hinterland. Novo Cargo uses Esack depot as a part of Off-Dock facilities which is located adjacent to Chittagong port. Novo Cargo’s dynamic approach to household removal business is well supported by the concerned authorities in Bangladesh. The objective of the company is to deliver reliable, cost effective transportation and management of clients’ goods. Novo Cargo also offers other comprehensive services like air and sea freight, surface services, customs brokerages, cargo management, chartering, consolidation, warehousing and distribution, inland transportation and so on. SWOT, PEST and STP analysis of Novo Cargo are done here to identify its competitive advantage through analyzing its strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats, find out macro-environmental factors used in the environmental scanning and use the formula of segmentation, targeting and positioning for strategic marketing. Though Novo Cargo is also facing more or less challenging situations in the current market, but it is well organized and is able to offer a full range of professional logistics services to its customers as well as overseas partners. It operates with a commitment to the global sea and air freight customers through highly qualified and experienced professional team specializing in all international logistics and customs requirements.
