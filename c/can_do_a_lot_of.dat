Coxon was a fan of the series and said [...] "If I'd been told a year ago that I would be playing SpongeBob today I would have loved it, {{although}} I'm not sure I would have believed it." [...] Coxon admitted it was difficult to adapt the show into a musical. He remarked [...] "It is difficult because you are trying to recreate this character that is so fluid on screen.

Each corner was rounded; surfaces were measured for height and size, then padded." [...] Elaborating on this, fight choreographer Matt Mullins stated, [...] "The main fight starts in a hallway, and then we move into a penthouse. Okay, we have a hallway and a penthouse—what can we do with that? Are we going to crash into some walls? Are we {{going to go into}} a kitchen? We see what we would get in terms of props, we take into consideration what the actors can do, move-wise—in our case, Ming-Na is exceptionally talented, so we <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> different martial arts movement with her." ...|$|E
