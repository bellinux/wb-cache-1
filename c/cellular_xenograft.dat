40|$|In the hamster to rat liver {{transplant}} model, we determined {{the efficacy of}} tacrolimus in attenuating natural xenospecific humoral immunity and in abrogating the hyperacute liver rejection that is produced by presensitizing the Lewis rat recipient. Hamster livers, transplanted orthotopically into naive rats (controls), were rejected with animal death after 6. 4 ± 0. 5 (SD) days. The infusion on (day - 6) of 1. 5 x 10 7 hamster hepatocytes, or of 1. 5 x 10 8 nonparenchymal cells (NPC), resulted in hyperacute rejection and death in ≤ 1. 9 days. However, when the rats were pretreated with 1 mg/kg/day tacrolimus from days - 6 to - 1, survival of non-presensitized animals was prolonged to 25 ± 20 days and that of recipients presensitized with hamster hepatocytes to 36 ± 16 days or with NPC to 32 ± 1. 7 days. The tacrolimus pretreatment significantly reduced the hamster-specific complement-dependent cytotoxic antibodies response directed to liver NPC but not to lymph node cell targets. These observations suggest that the prolongation of survival by appropriately timed treatment with this T cell directed drug model {{is caused by the}} inhibition of humoral as well as <b>cellular</b> <b>xenograft</b> rejection...|$|E
40|$|To date, {{the best}} results in life-supporting pig-to-primate renal {{xenotransplantation}} have been obtained in recipients exposed to long-term immunosuppression with cyclophosphamide. As this agent is frequently associated with side-effects, we have explored the potential of a mycophenolate sodium-based maintenance immunosuppression in this model. Human decay-accelerating factor (hDAF) transgenic kidneys were transplanted into splenectomized and bilaterally nephrectomized cynomolgus monkeys immunosuppressed with mycophenolate sodium, cyclosporin A and steroids, and exposed to a brief induction course with cyclophosphamide (up to four doses). After transplantation, the primates were monitored daily for biochemical and haematological evaluations and for the measurements of haemolytic anti-pig antibodies (APA). A detailed histological analysis of each explanted graft was also performed. All the animals showed very poor initial graft function but survived for up to 51 days. In contrast to our previous studies in xenograft recipients on long-term immunosuppression with cyclophosphamide, minimal or no circulating xeno-directed antibodies, {{as measured by the}} evaluation of APA titres, were detected in this series although some degree of acute humoral rejection was observed in all the explanted grafts and was the primary cause of graft failure. Furthermore, in addition to areas of humorally mediated graft damage, we have observed for the first time areas with exclusive and prominent infiltration by CD 2 + and CD 8 + mononuclear cells presenting patterns compatible with tubulitis, glomerulitis and arteritis, which we have called acute <b>cellular</b> <b>xenograft</b> rejection (ACXR). In addition, CD 68 + infiltrating macrophages and CD 20 + B-cells were also present. This study demonstrates that a triple maintenance immunosuppression with mycophenolate sodium, cyclosporin A and steroids is a viable alternative to a cyclophosphamide-based immunosuppression to obtain prolonged survival of porcine organs transplanted into primates. However, a more stringent control of antibody forming cells remains essential to further extend the survival of xenografts in this model. In addition, the use of the immunosuppressive regimen reported here in the primate is associated with the occurrence of a new category of cell-mediated xenograft injury (ACXR) whose significance has yet to be clarified...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Xenograft {{rejection}} can be {{provoked by}} both the innate and adaptive immune compartments and close reciprocal interactions exist between these two systems. We investigated the interdependent roles of T and B lymphocytes in vascularized (heart) and <b>cellular</b> (islet) <b>xenograft</b> rejection in a model with established xeno-nonreactivity of the innate immune system. METHODS: Specific innate xenotolerance was induced in nude rats bearing either a hamster heart or a hamster pancreatic islet graft by a tolerizing regimen consisting of donor antigen infusion, temporary natural killer cell depletion and a 4 -week administration of leflunomide. One month after transplantation, syngeneic CD 4 and CD 8 T cells were adoptively transferred. RESULTS: Both vascular and <b>cellular</b> <b>xenografts</b> were rejected after CD 4 T cell reconstitution, corresponding with production of high IgM and IgG xenoantibody titers. Deposition of xenoantibodies and complement {{was seen in the}} heart but not in the islet xenografts. After infusion of CD 8 T cells, xenohearts underwent a delayed type of rejection without xenoantibody production and xenoislets were not rejected. In xenoislet recipients, CD 8 dependent B cells were not tolerized, resulting in the production of IgG xenoantibodies belonging to Th 2 -dependent isotypes, known not to cause graft rejection, and deposited at the graft implantation site.

Loss of LZAP also increased cellular invasion, and MMP- 9 expression dependent on NF-κB. LZAP directly bound to RelA, impaired serine 536 phosphorylation of RelA, increased HDAC association with RelA, inhibited basal and stimulated NF-κB transcriptional activity, and was found at the promoter of selective NF-κB-responsive genes. LZAP protein levels were markedly decreased in 32 % of primary HNSCCs (n = 28) and decreased LZAP levels in primary HNSCC correlated with increased expression of the NF-κB-regulated genes IL- 8 and IκBα.

40|$|The 4 ’-thio-β-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (T-araC) is a newly {{developed}} nucleoside analog that has shown promising activity against {{a broad spectrum}} of human solid tumors in both <b>cellular</b> and <b>xenograft</b> mice models. TaraC shares similar structure with another anticancer deoxycytidine analog, β-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (araC, cytarabine), which has been used in clinics for the treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia but has a very limited efficacy against solid tumors. T-araC exerts its anticancer activity mainly by inhibiting replicative DNA polymerases from further extension after its incorporation into DNA. DNA lesion bypass polymerases can manage the DNA lesions introduced by therapeutic agents, such as cisplatin and araC, therefore reduce the activity of these compounds. In this study, the potential relationships between the lesion bypass Y-family DNA polymerases η, ι and κ (pol η, pol ι, and pol κ) and T-araC were examined. Biochemical studies indicated that the triphosphate metabolite of T-araC is a less preferred substrate for the Y-family polymerases. In addition, cell viability study indicated that pol η deficient human fibroblast cells were more sensitive to T-araC when compared with the normal human fibroblast cells. Together, these results suggest that bypass polymerases reduced cell sensitivity to T-araC through helping cells to overcome the DNA damages introduced by T-araC...|$|R
40|$|The p 53 tumor {{suppressor}} protein {{plays a key}} {{function in}} the cellular response to stress by activating a subset of genes responsible for cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Activation of the p 53 pathway in tumor cells has been proposed as a novel approach to cancer therapy and substantial efforts have been dedicated {{to the discovery of}} pharmacological p 53 activators. Here, we show that the transforming growth factor-B superfamily cytokine, macrophage inhibitory cytokine- 1 (MIC- 1), can serve as a secreted biomarker for activation of p 53 in both <b>cellular</b> and <b>xenograft</b> models of human cancer. Using doxorubi-cin treatment in the HCT 116 colon cancer cell line, we have shown that MIC- 1 secretion into culture media is correlated with p 53 pathway activation as measured by the up-regulation of its downstream transcriptional target p 21. When transplanted into nude mice, HCT 116 cells continued to secrete human MIC- 1 and mouse plasma levels correlated well with tumor volume. Treatment of these animals with a single dose of doxorubicin led to activation of the p 53 pathway and a nearly 4 -fold elevation of the plasma MIC- 1 level, which was paralleled by p 21 induction in the tumor xenografts. Estimation of MIC- 1 concentration, both in vivo and in vitro, repre-sents a novel tool for the study of p 53 pathway and development of p 53 -activating therapeutics.

40|$|Xeno{{transplantation}} is the transplantation of cells, tissues or organs {{between different}} species {{and is a}} potential alternative to allotransplantation {{because of the lack}} of human donors. The pig is believed to be a suitable donor-species to man for medical, technical, financial and ethical reasons. Porcine vascularized organs transplanted into humans are hyperacutely rejected (HAR) due to xenoreactive natural anti-pig Abs present in man. These Abs arc mainly directed against the Gal(alpha) 1, 3 Gal (alpha-Gal) epitope expressed on most porcine cells, including the endothelium. Following their binding to the endothelium, the complement cascade is activated leading to graft destruction. If HAR is prevented, the vascularized grafts are generally lost in an acute vascular rejection (AVR). AVR is characterized by type 11 (i. e. transcriptional) endothelial cell (EC) activation, thrombosis with fibrin deposition and cellular infiltration dominated by monocytes/macrophages, natural killer (NK) cells and neutrophils. In contrast, <b>cellular</b> <b>xenografts,</b> e. g. isolated islets of Langerhans, are subjected to an instant blood-mediated inflammatory reaction (IBMIR) upon intra-portal transplantation and a subsequent cell-mediated rejection dependent on CD 4 + T cells and macrophages. The aims of the work outlined in this thesis were: (i) to investigate the interaction between human leukocyte subpopulations and porcine endothelium in vitro; and to evaluate the effect of the alpha-Gal epitope and human anti-alpha-Gal Abs in this interaction; (ii) to study the cytokine/chemokine profile of isolated adult porcine islets (APIs) and to examine if these factors could induce activation of human ECs and/or attract human leukocytes in vitro. In the absence of xenoreactive natural anti-pig Abs and complement, human neutrophils and monocytes did not adhere more to porcine than to human non- and TNF-alpha-stimulated endothelium, as assessed under static and dynamic conditions. The adhesion of human neutrophils increased significantly after antialpha-Gal Ab-mediated activation of porcine endothelium. Porcine EC activation was demonstrated by an increase in E-selectin and VCAM- 1 expression, and by the production of soluble factors such as IL- 8 and PAF. These factors induced migration of human neutrophils. Aberrant expression of the alpha-Gal epitope on human endothelium using recombinant lentiviruses did not confer susceptibility to human NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity or increased NK cell adhesion. NK cells did not produce IFN-gamma upon interaction with the alpha-Gal-expressing human endothelium. In addition, aberrantly expressed alphaGal epitopes did not increase the adhesion, under static or dynamic conditions, of human monocytes to human endothelium. Neither did it increase monocyte transendothelial migration. Recombinant lentiviruses proved to be effective vehicles for gene transfer into primary human ECs. Cultured APIs expressed mRNAs for MCP- 1, IL- 1 beta and TNF-alpha. Supernatants from cultured APIs induced migration of human monocytes, which could be blocked by an anti-MCP- 1 Ab. Isolated islets and islets in situ produced MCP- 1 as detected by immunohistochemistry. Recombinant porcine IL- 1 beta and TNF-alpha induced the expression of E-selectin and VCAM- 1 on human endothelium. With regard to novel therapeutic strategies to disrupt the infiltration of human leukocytes into organ xenografts, our data suggest that efforts should be focused on adhesion receptor-ligand interactions rather than on carbohydrate remodeling of donor pigs. Induced Abs of alpha-Gal or non-alpha-Gal specificity may increase the adhesion and infiltration of, not only human neutrophils, but also of other human leukocyte subpopulations. Indeed, preventing the induced anti-porcine Ab response will be an important factor to prevent AVR. The work on isolated porcine islets highlighted the importance of proinflammatory and chemotactic factors produced by the graft itself, and that these factors may have profound effects on the rejection process in vivo...|$|R
40|$|Human {{allotransplantation}} is nowadays {{the generally}} accepted {{treatment of choice}} for several illnesses leading to organ failure. A major problem facing clinical organ transplantation {{is the lack of}} human donor organs and tissues. Xenotransplantation from pig to man is considered a plausible solution to this problem. However, several hurdles, the hyperacute rejection (HAR) being the most immediate, need to be overcome before xenotransplantation will become a clinical reality. HAR is initiated by complement, activated by naturally occuring antibodies in man binding the Galalpha 1, 3 Gal (cc-Gal) carbohydrate epitope on pig tissues. Although <b>cellular</b> <b>xenografts</b> are not lost in a HAR, antibodies have been shown to decrease graft survival in pig to mouse models of neural and islet cell xenotransplantation. Various methods, including plasmapheresis and extracorporeal immunoabsorption, have been used in order to remove anti- Gal antibodies from human serum. The main aims of this thesis have been to: (i) construct, produce and characterize a novel anti-pig antibody absorber based on an alpha-Gal-substituted mucin-like immunoglobulin chimera, (ii) compare its anti-pig antibody absorption efficacy with that of porcine thyroglobulin and Galalpha 1, 3 Gal disaccharides, and to (iii) analyze the relationship between the expression of alpha-Gal epitopes in individual pig embryonic brain cells and their susceptibility to the cytotoxicity of human blood group AB serum depleted of anti-alpha-Gal antibodies by absorption on the a-Gal substituted chimera. The secreted P-selectin glycoprotein ligand- 1 /mouse IgG 2 b (PSGL- 17 mIgG 2 b) fusion protein had an apparent MW under reducing conditions of around 145 kDa with a wide size distribution characteristic of a heavily glycosylated protein. Following coexpression of the porcine alpha 1, 3 galactosyltransferase, the mucin/Ig stained strongly with the alpha-Gal specific lectin Griffonia simplicifolia 1 IB 4 in Western blot experiments. The carbohydrate portion of the mucin/lg constituted 43 % of its molecular weight and the majority of the a-Gal epitopes were O-linked. The fusion protein carried approximately 140 mol of terming alpha- linked galactose per mol protein, and was on a carbohydrate molar basis a much more efficient anti-pig antibody absorber than pig thyroglobulin and Galalpha 1, 3 Gal disaccharides. CHO-K 1, 293 T, COS 7 m 6, Sp 2 / 0 and High-Five cells stably expressing PSGL- 1 /mIgG 2 b with and without the porcine alpha 1, 3 galactosyltransferase were established. The alpha-Gal epitope density on PSGL- 1 /mIgG 2 b was dependent on the host cell used for its production, and was highest on the mucin/lg made in COS and 293 T cells and lowest on CHO cells. The anti-pig antibody absorption efficacy correlated to the cc-Gal epitope density. Transfection of CHO cells producing alpha-Gal-substituted mucin/lgs with plasmids encoding a core 2 beta 1, 6 GIcNAc transferase led to the production of a mucin chimera with higher alpha-Gal epitope density and anti-pig antibody absorption capacity. The level of cc-Gal expression on neurons and astrocytes of porcine embryonic brain tissue was much lower than the level of expression on brain microvascular endothelial cells and microglia. Both non-depleted and anti-alpha-Gal- depleted human AB serum was cytotoxic to pig embryonic brain cells, suggesting that also non- alpha-Galspecific antibodies may contribute to the rejection of pig brain cell xenografts. In conclusion, we have described the construction, production and characterization of a novel type of anti-pig antibody absorber based on a recombinant mucin-type fusion protein with rich Galalpha 1, 3 Gal substitution on O-linked. glycans. Provided production costs can be kept low, this fusion protein may be used in extracorporeal absorption columns aimed at anti- pig antibody removal prior to future pigto-human organ transplantations...|$|R

MATERIALS: Specific innate xenotolerance was induced in xenoheart (hamster) recipients (nude rats) by a tolerizing regimen (TR), consisting of donor antigen infusion, temporary natural killer (NK) -cell depletion and a 4 -week administration of leflunomide. Hamster pancreatic islets were transplanted either 1 week after heart transplantation or alone and syngeneic T-cell adoptive transfer was performed 10 days later. Purified CD 3 (+), CD 4 (+), and CD 8 (+) T cells were given 2 weeks after withdrawal of all drugs. At the day of rejection, xenografts were removed for histology. Serum was taken and IgM and IgG xenoantibody titers were measured by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Both heart and islet grafts were rejected after CD 4 (+) reconstitution. After CD 8 (+) T-cell adoptive transfer, cellular grafts were not rejected but vascularized grafts were rejected, although only after several months. Rejection in CD 4 (+) reconstituted nude rats was accompanied by the generation of predominantly IgG xenoantibodies. CONCLUSION: CD 4 (+) T lymphocytes are able to rapidly initiate the rejection of islet xenografts {{in the presence of}} a xenotolerant innate immune system either by breaking the "innate tolerance" (e. g., by activating macrophages and NK-cells) or through a mechanism without any involvement of the innate tolerance (e. g., T-dependent IgG antibody production).

This study was performed to investigate the role of natural killer cells (NK cells) and NK 1. 1 + T cells (NK T cells) in the rejection of neural xenografts. A cell suspension was prepared from the ventral mesencephalon of 26 - 27 -day-old pig embryos, and 2 microl was implanted in the right striata of mutant CD 1 d 1 null (CD 1. 1 -/-) mice, NK 1. 1 -depleted mice, and controls. The CD 1. 1 -/- mice are deficient in NK T cells and the antigen-presenting molecule CD 1 d 1. Graft survival and host responses were determined immunohistochemically using markers for dopamine neurons, CD 4 -, CD 8 - cells, microglia, and macrophages. At 2 weeks, the grafts were significantly larger in CD 1. 1 -/- mice, 0. 09 +/- 0. 02 microl (mean +/- SEM), compared with controls, 0. 05 +/- 0. 01 microl. There {{was no significant difference}} between NK 1. 1 -depleted mice, 0. 02 +/- 0. 01 microl, and controls. At 5 weeks, two grafts were still present in the CD 1 -/- mice, whereas only scars remained in the controls and in the NK 1. 1 -depleted mice. Immune reactions were strong at 2 weeks and less pronounced at 5 weeks in all groups. Microglial activation was lower in NK-depleted mice than in the controls at 2 weeks. In contrast to organ xenografting, NK 1. 1 + cells do not seem to be important mediators of the rejection of discordant <b>cellular</b> neural <b>xenografts.</b> However, our results suggest that the antigen-presenting molecule CD 1 d 1 may be involved in the rejection process...|$|R
40|$|Ewing's sarcoma is a {{pediatric}} {{cancer of the}} bone that {{is characterized by the}} expression of the chimeric transcription factor EWS-FLI 1 that confers a highly malignant phenotype and results from the chromosomal translocation t(11; 22) (q 24;q 12). Poor overall survival and pronounced long-term side effects associated with traditional chemotherapy necessitate the development of novel, targeted, therapeutic strategies. We therefore conducted a focused viability screen with 200 small molecule kinase inhibitors in 2 different Ewing's sarcoma cell lines. This resulted in the identification of several potential molecular intervention points. Most notably, tozasertib (VX- 680, MK- 0457) displayed unique nanomolar efficacy, which extended to other cell lines, but was specific for Ewing's sarcoma. Furthermore, tozasertib showed strong synergies with the chemotherapeutic drugs etoposide and doxorubicin, the current standard agents for Ewing's sarcoma. To identify the relevant targets underlying the specific vulnerability toward tozasertib, we determined its cellular target profile by chemical proteomics. We identified 20 known and unknown serine/threonine and tyrosine protein kinase targets. Additional target deconvolution and functional validation by RNAi showed simultaneous inhibition of Aurora kinases A and B to be responsible for the observed tozasertib sensitivity, thereby revealing a new mechanism for targeting Ewing's sarcoma. We further corroborated our <b>cellular</b> observations with <b>xenograft</b> mouse models. In summary, the multilayered chemical biology approach presented here identified a specific vulnerability of Ewing's sarcoma to concomitant inhibition of Aurora kinases A and B by tozasertib and danusertib, which has the potential to become a new therapeutic option...|$|R
40|$|The {{androgen}} receptor (AR) signaling axis is a well-established therapeutic target in prostate cancer, {{due to its}} central role in tumor maintenance and progression. Although patients respond initially to androgen deprivation therapies and AR antagonists, they invariably progress to a castration-resistant state. Consequently, there is an unmet need for agents that target the AR signaling axis in a unique manner. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors repress AR signaling and prostate cancer growth in <b>cellular</b> and <b>xenograft</b> models. However, HDAC inhibitors also induce epithelial to mesenchymal (EMT) and neuroendocrine differentiation, {{both of which are}} associated with prostate cancer progression and aggressiveness. Given that 18 different HDAC isoforms have been identified in humans, and non-selective or Class I (HDAC 1, 2, 3, and 8) HDAC inhibitors have been used in most of these studies, the relative contribution of individual HDAC isoforms to AR transcriptional activity and prostate cancer pathophysiology remains to be elucidated. The overarching goals of this study were to (1) determine the role of individual Class I HDACs in AR transcriptional activity and prostate cancer growth, (2) identify selective HDAC inhibitors that have reduced adverse profiles to the treatment of prostate cancer, and (3) identify potential HDAC-interacting proteins that regulate AR target gene transcription and prostate cancer growth. Using genetic knockdown studies and pharmacological inhibitors with isoform selectivity, we identified that HDAC 3 was required for AR transcriptional activity and proliferation in cellular models of androgen-sensitive and castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Additionally, we found that RGFP 966, an HDAC 3 -selective inhibitor, attenuated the growth of a xenograft model of CRPC. Furthermore, non-selective HDAC inhibitors induced EMT and neuroendocrine markers in prostate cancer cells, but RGFP 966 treatment did not. These studies provide rationale for selective inhibition of HDAC 3 for the treatment of CRPC, and could provide an explanation for the lack of success using non-selective HDAC inhibitors in clinical trials for prostate cancer. We also assessed the role of REV-ERB alpha, an HDAC 3 -interacting protein, in the regulation of AR transcriptional activity and prostate cancer growth. Using siRNA knockdown studies, REV-ERB inhibitors, and overexpression studies, we concluded that REV-ERB alpha; was required for AR target gene induction and prostate cancer growth, including models of CRPC. These studies also provide rational for targeting REV-ERB alpha; for the treatment of CRPC. Taken together, these studies identify two novel targets in the HDAC signaling axis for the treatment of prostate cancer: HDAC 3 and REV-ERB alpha. Our studies provide greater insight into AR transcriptional regulation and prostate cancer pathophysiology. Dissertatio...|$|R

Genetic mutations underlying prostate tumorigenesis include alterations of tumor suppressor genes. We tested the tumor suppressor hypothesis for ABI 1 /hSSH 3 BP 1 by searching for gene mutations in primary prostate tumors from patients, and by analyzing the consequences of prostate-specific disruption of the mouse Abi 1 /Hssh 3 bp 1 ortholog. We sequenced the ABI 1 / hSSH 3 BP 1 gene and identified recurring mutations in 6 out of 35 prostate tumors. Moreover, complementation and anchorage-independent growth, proliferation, <b>cellular</b> adhesion and <b>xenograft</b> assays using the LNCaP cell line, which contains a loss-of-function Abi 1 mutation, and a stably expressed wild-type or mutated ABI gene, were consistent with the tumor suppressor hypothesis. To test the hypothesis further, we disrupted the gene in the mouse prostate by breeding the Abi 1 floxed strain with the probasin promoter-driven Cre recombinase strain. Histopathological evaluation of mice indicated development of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) in Abi 1 /Hssh 3 bp 1 knockout mouse as early as the eighth month, but no progression beyond PIN was observed in mice as old as 12 months. Observed decreased levels of E-cadherin, b-catenin and WAVE 2 in mouse prostate suggest abnormal cellular adhesion as the mechanism underlying PIN development owing to Abi 1 disruption.

40|$|Long-term {{survival}} of discordant xenografts will require {{control of both}} humoral and cellular aspects of the immune response. Because <b>cellular</b> responses to <b>xenografts</b> {{appear to be more}} potent than those encountered by allografts, recipients of xenogeneic tissues are likely to require more immunosuppression, with potential for unacceptably high complication rates. We have therefore directed our attention toward the induction of tolerance to {{some or all of the}} xenogeneic antigens recognized in the primate anti-pig cellular immune response, utilizing mixed lymphohematopoietic chimerism as the means for tolerance induction. We report here our initial series of 16 animals in which the conditions for application of this treatment regimen were established. In 14 cynomolgus monkey recipients, induction therapy consisted of low dose whole body irradiation, thymic irradiation, and ATG, followed by infusion of pig bone marrow and a pig kidney transplant. Other aspects of the regimen included splenectomy and removal of monkey anti-porcine natural antibodies by extracorporeal perfusion of the recipient's blood through a pig liver. Two control animals received either no treatment or extracorporeal perfusion but no additional induction therapy. Five of the experimental animals were treated posttransplant with an anti-IgM monoclonal antibody, five with Cyclosporin A, and two with a combination of both immunosuppressants. Both IgM and IgG natural antibodies were removed effectively by liver perfusion in all but one monkey, as determined by flow cytometry. Antibody liters remained low for 5 – 7 days, but increased progressively thereafter. The longest kidney survival in this series was 13 days, in an animal which maintained excellent kidney function for the first 11 days posttransplant. Peripheral chimerism was detected only transiently on day 10 in the peripheral blood of this recipient. We conclude that extracorporeal perfusion by this technique removes natural antibodies and prevents hyperacute rejection, permitting maintenance of excellent renal xenograft function for at least 11 days. Additional manipulations appear to be required to achieve mixed chimerism and tolerance of the cellular immune system in this model...|$|R
40|$|Fibrinogen-like 2 (FGL 2) {{encompasses}} a transmembrane (mFGL 2) and a soluble (sFGL 2) form with differential tertiary structure and biological activities. Typically, mFGL 2 functions as prothrombinase that {{is capable of}} initiating coagulation in tissue without activation of the blood clotting cascade, whereas sFGL 2 largely acts as an immunosuppressor that can repress proliferation of alloreactive T lymphocytes and maturation of bone marrow dendritic cells. Protein sequences of FGL 2 exhibit evolutionary conservation across wide variety of species, especially at the carboxyl terminus that contains fibrinogen related domain (FRED). The FRED of FGL 2 confers specificity and complexity in the action of FGL 2, including receptor recognition, calcium affiliation, and substrate binding. Constitutive expression of FGL 2 during embryogenesis and in mature tissues suggests FGL 2 might be physiologically important. However, excessive induction of FGL 2 under certain medical conditions (e. g., pathogen invasion) could trigger complement activation, inflammatory response, cellular apoptosis, and immune dysfunctions. On the other hand, complete absence of FGL 2 is also detrimental as lack of FGL 2 can cause autoimmune glomerulonephritis and acute <b>cellular</b> rejection of <b>xenografts.</b> All these roles involve mFGL 2, sFGL 2, or their combination. Although {{it is not clear how}} mFGL 2 is cleaved off its host cells and secreted into the blood, circulating sFGL 2 has been found correlated with disease severity and viral loading among patients with human hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus infection. Further studies are warranted to understand how FGL 2 expression is regulated under physiological and pathological conditions. Even more interesting is to determine whether mFGL 2 can fulfill an immunoregulatory role through its FRED at carboxyl end of the molecule and, and vice versa, whether sFGL 2 is procoagulant upon binding to a target cell. Knowledge in this area should shed light on development of sFGL 2 as an alternative immunosuppressive agent for organ transplantation or as a biomarker for predicting disease progression, monitoring therapeutic effects, and targeting FGL 2 for repression in ameliorating fulminant viral hepatitis.
