40|$|The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) run {{under the}} United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Food and Nutrition Service {{is the largest}} program aimed at {{addressing}} food access and hunger in the country. Since the <b>conversion</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefit</b> provision from physical 2 ̆ 2 stamps 2 ̆ 2 to Electronic Benefit Transfer cards (EBT cards), tracking and administering <b>of</b> <b>benefits</b> has become more efficient, but the change has also placed limits on farmers’ and farmers markets’ ability to accept these benefits as payment in exchange for affordable and nutritious food products. Within the past few decades, the federal government, states, cities, and farmers markets across the country themselves have been implementing and improving programs to facilitate EBT transactions while simultaneously attempting to spread awareness of such initiatives and the <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> farmers markets to SNAP customers.

40|$|Cash balance {{plans are}} hybrid plans {{designed}} {{to offer the}} best characteristics <b>of</b> both defined <b>benefit</b> and defined contribution plans. However, <b>conversions</b> <b>of</b> existing defined <b>benefit</b> plans into cash balance plans are highly controversial because they can significantly reduce the expected retirement <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> older workers. Because future plan costs are reduced and plan surpluses are often created, the use of surplus plan assets by employers has raised serious concerns. This article describes and analyzes {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of using cash balance plans as primary retirement savings vehicles. It argues that the controversy over conversions is really about the extent to which the rights and expectations of plan participants should be protected. It proposes striking a balance between the rights of employers and employees in a plan conversion by 1) requiring employers to provide sufficient notice to affected participants about changes in their projected retirement benefits; and 2) limiting the amounts by which retirement benefits can be reduced...|$|R

40|$|In {{light of}} the recent {{concerns}} regarding the solvency of Social Security’s Old-Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance (OASDI), private pensions may play an increasingly important role in retirement welfare of US retirees. However, the private pension landscape has evolved in ways that may result in lower private pension wealth for retirees. One recent such phenomenon involves the <b>conversion</b> <b>of</b> traditional defined <b>benefit</b> pension plans to cash balance plans, which resulted in lower pension benefits for many workers. In this study, I investigate how characteristics of the firm’s workforce influenced whether the firm converted their traditional pension plan to a cash balance plan and how these characteristics related to the firm’s pension plan policy more generally. Using the Longitudinal Employer-Household Data and pension plan data from the Department of Labor/Internal Revenue Service and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, I found little evidence of workforce age distribution effects on the likelihood <b>of</b> DB plan <b>conversion</b> to a cash balance plan in the 1990 s. More generally, I consistently find positive associations between firms with older and more female workforces and defined contribution plans during the same time. ...|$|R
