5|$|For the {{constitution}} to be ratified, however, nine of the thirteen states were required to approve it in state <b>conventions.</b> Opposition to ratification ("Anti-Federalism") was partly based on the Constitution's lack of adequate guarantees for civil liberties.

Four state <b>conventions</b> proposed some form of restriction on the authority of the new federal government to conduct searches.|$|E
