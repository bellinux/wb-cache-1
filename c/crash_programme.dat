40|$|Paper Number 175 New car <b>crash</b> testing <b>programmes</b> promote car manufacturers, {{by the way}} of {{consumer}} choice, to improve the occupant protection of new car mod-els. It is also possible to produce an assessment of relative car occupant protection {{on the basis of}} real world accidents. NCAPs and safety ratings based on real-world ac-cidents are complementary.

Therefore, the European Project “Quality Criteria for the Safety Assessment of Cars based on Real World Crashes ” was established, with three major objectives:- description of existing rating methods and identification of problem areas;- inter-relationship between retrospective (acci-dent-based ratings) and prospective barrier-test rating systems;- consideration of vehicle compatibility and ag-gressivity ratings.

40|$|Most of the {{construction}} works in the Mahaweli Development Project {{have been carried out}} through <b>crash</b> <b>programmes.</b> Even though, the project planning is vital for the economical and successful completion of any construction project this important aspect has not been given due recognition during the execution of downstream development works of the Mahaweli project. Instead of the proper project planning, the experience and knowledge of the Engineering staff with regard to the works and the performance of the contractors have been used for allocating works for the contractors. Although, this has resulted in achieving the targets of the scheduled programme, in many cases there have been failures too. Three models were developed for selecting and assigning contractors for three types of contracts used in the Mahaweli Development Project namely, Tendered Contracts, Fixed Rate Contracts and Labour Contracts. So far, no action has been taken to measure the performance level of the contractors and the performance standards to be maintained in respect of construction works in achieving the targets which are the main factors considered in the above models. As these are the most significant factors used in planning a construction project, this study reveals that the collection of performance data of contractors will be very useful in carring out future projects of similar nature. This research project also investigates the ways and means of determining the performance standards of different contractors as well as the standards of performance required by different construction activities for timely completion of the completion of the projects. Furthermore, recommendations are made regarding techniques that could be adopted for various types of contracts encountered in projects of a similar nature...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the political and}} economic processes governing Ethiopian cereal seed systems by analysing the overall policy context, as well as the main interests driving seed policy formulation and implementation and the roles and interaction of the different public and private actors. It also examines how these interests and interactions are related to the performance of the system on the ground. The nature of the Ethiopian agricultural sector, the historical evolution of the seed system and the seed specificities for each cereal crops has resulted {{in a wide range of}} actors with diverse linkages and policy processes. The analysis of these processes has identified a number of constraints faced by the Ethiopian cereal seed system. These constraints are a result of a economic and political drivers, including top-down state driven initiatives, agricultural liberalisation and the private sector and political-administrative decentralisation, all of which pull in different directions. While contrasting interests in federal and decentralised state level activities exist, ultimately it is the state-driven imperatives that define what private sector activity is possible. Centrallydirected, state-supported efforts, including numerous campaigns, special projects and programmes along with ad hoc <b>crash</b> <b>programmes,</b> create numerous blockages in the supply and distribution of seed. These ‘pull-push’ factors have brought about severe strains within the system. Thus, it is important that the technocrats, politicians, international donors and supporters understand these political economic drivers of change in the Ethiopian cereal seed system. By addressing these conflicts and contradictions, they may improve their chances of designing and implementing more technically effective and socially appropriate policies. This in turn will help establish a vibrant seed system which offers real choices for farmers in terms of seed type, quantity, and quality and delivery time at reasonable prices. DfI...|$|R

40|$|AbstractFor the {{assessment}} of vehicle safety in frontal collisions, the crash compatibility between the colliding vehicles is crucial. Compatibility compromises both the self protection and the partner protection properties of vehicles. Although compatibility has received worldwide attention for many years, no final assessment approach has been defined. Within the FIMCAR project, different frontal impact test procedures are analysed regarding their potential for future frontal impact legislation. The research activities focus on car-to-car frontal impact accidents based on accident investigations involving newer cars. Test procedures were developed with both a <b>crash</b> test <b>programme</b> and numerical simulations. The proposal from FIMCAR {{is to use a}} full width test procedure with deformable element and compatibility metrics in combination with the current ECE R 94 off-set procedure as a frontal impact assessment approach which also addresses compatibility...|$|R

His proposal, presented in 1994, outlined to the UK department of Transport the concept of a consumer information programme based on the EEVC proposed frontal impact, side impact and pedestrian protection crash test procedures. His reason for a consumer-based information car-testing programme was clear. He cited the New Car Assessment Programme in the US that had had a more significant effect on changing car design than any US legislative test. He also cited the magazine Auto Motor und Sport and the ADAC, in Germany, whose published car crash tests results were already influencing how manufacturers designed their cars, as they endeavoured to obtain good ratings in the published tests.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} was to study the influence of various types of car seats aimed at protecting whiplash injuries on real-life injury outcome.

Since 1997 various seats aimed at lowering the risk of whiplash injuries have been introduced in cars. The cars were divided into groups according to the safety technology used. Since 2003 consumer <b>crash</b> test <b>programmes</b> have been running. The correlation on group level between whiplash injury outcome in real-life crashes and the test results of consumer crash tests both in Sweden by Folksam and the Swedish Road Administration and by IIWPG were studied.

5000|$|In the 1890s, under Finance Minister Sergei Witte, a <b>crash</b> {{governmental}} <b>programme</b> {{was proposed}} to promote industrialization. His policies included heavy government expenditures for railroad building and operations, subsidies and supporting services for private industrialists, high protective tariffs for Russian industries (especially heavy industry), {{an increase in}} exports, currency stabilization, and encouragement of foreign investments. His plan was successful and during the 1890s [...] "Russian industrial growth averaged 8 percent per year. Railroad mileage grew from a very substantial base by 40 percent between 1892 and 1902." [...] Ironically, Witte's success in implementing this program helped spur the 1905 revolution and eventually the 1917 revolution because it exacerbated social tensions. [...] "Besides dangerously concentrating a proletariat, a professional and a rebellious student body in centers of political power, industrialization infuriated both these new forces and the traditional rural classes." [...] The government policy of financing industrialization through taxing peasants forced millions of peasants to work in towns. The [...] "peasant worker" [...] saw his labour in the factory as the means to consolidate his family's economic position {{in the village and}} played a role in determining the social consciousness of the urban proletariat. The new concentrations and flows of peasants spread urban ideas to the countryside, breaking down isolation of peasants on communes.|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of the}} FIMCAR (Frontal Impact and Compatibility Assessment Research) {{project was}} to propose a frontal impact {{assessment}} approach addressing self- and partner protection. Research strategies and priorities were based on earlier research programs and the FIMCAR accident data analysis looking at modern cars. The identified real world safety issues – such as structural interaction (especially under-/override), high acceleration loading of the occupant especially in large overlap accidents and insufficient horizontal and vertical load spreading were used for evaluating the different test candidates. In addition to the issues mentioned above, the FIMCAR accident analysis suggested that frontal force compartment integrity matching is less of an issue as originally expected. FIMCAR developed a car-to-car test program that investigated the performance of vehicle structures. Results of the test program show {{that the presence of}} a lower load path contributes to a more robust performance of the vehicle. The rearward offset of a lower load path could be reviewed and used to quantify when a lower structure design can contribute to structural interaction in both frontal and side impact configurations. In addition to the car <b>crash</b> test <b>programme,</b> numerical models of actual cars and barriers were developed and used. As car-to-car simulations with models of different car manufacturers are almost impossible because of confidentiality, Parametric Car Models (PCM) and Generic Car Models (GCM) were developed. Due to the parametric design of the PCMs it is possible to modify the models in an easy and fast way. The GCMs model virtual cars which represent an average real car of the respective category in a comparable way to the OEM models. Within the FIMCAR project, different frontal impact test candidates were analysed regarding their potential for future frontal impact legislation. The research activities focused on car-to-car frontal impact. Test procedures were developed with both a <b>crash</b> test <b>programme</b> and numerical simulations. This analysis resulted in the combination of the Full Width Deformable Barrier test (FWDB) with compatibility metrics and the existing Offset Deformable Barrier (ODB) as described in UN-ECE Regulation 94 with additional cabin integrity requirement as being proposed as the FIMCAR assessment approach. The advantages of the FWDB compared to the rigid wall are the more representative pulse and deformation pattern as well as the better assessment of load paths. The introduction of a (M) PDB without compatibility metrics (that FIMCAR was unable to deliver in time) was considered as not being appropriate. The proposed frontal impact assessment approach addresses many of the issues identified by the FIMCAR consortium (impact alignment, high acceleration pulse loading, maintenance of compartment strength requirements, etc.) but not all frontal impact and compatibility issues could be addressed (load spreading). A benefit analysis estimated the benefit of the following three options: no change, introduction of full width test with compatibility assessment in addition to current ECE R 94 and introduction of full width test with compatibility assessment and replacement of current ODB test by PDB test with load spreading metric. The comparison of calculated break even costs for option 2 with estimated costs for achieving the benefit from previous projects suggests a positive cost benefit ratio.
