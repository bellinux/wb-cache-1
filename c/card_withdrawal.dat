30|$|This paper {{analyses}} the {{determinants of}} POS and ATM debit card transactions volumes in Spain, their interactions and their overall impact on the demand for currency. To our knowledge, {{this is the first}} paper simultaneously exploring both usages of debit cards and the effects on the demand for money. From a policy point of view, the use of debit cards has been identified as one of the main examples of the transition from paper-based to electronic-based systems. 18 However, ATM transactions and POS transactions have opposite effects since the use of debit cards at ATMs increases cash withdrawals while the use of debit cards at POS reduces cash holdings for purchasing purposes. In this paper, we use a unique bank-level database for Spain that allows us to identify the issuer (consumer) and acquirer (merchant) sides of the use of debit cards at POS as well as the number of debit <b>card</b> <b>withdrawals</b> at a bank.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of consumers' safety {{perception}} on debit card and cash usage. A conceptual framework of safety perception and payment behaviour is introduced and tested with 2008 consumer survey data. The results demonstrate that consumers' payment preferences for cash and debit cards are strongly affected by how consumers assess the likelihood and seriousness of safety incidents related to cash, debit <b>cards</b> and ATM <b>withdrawals.</b> Risk aversion, personal characteristics and personal experiences all play a significant role. This study underlines the importance of effective safety measures, which minimise the risks inherent in the payment system, and of clear communication towards consumers, {{so that they may}} continue to pay efficiently and safely in all circumstances. debit card; cash; fraud; safety; payment behaviour; risk perception; risk aversion...|$|R

5000|$|Some German banks such as Deutsche Kreditbank, ING-DiBa and Consorsbank {{have started}} issuing {{complementary}} Visa <b>cards</b> for cash <b>withdrawals</b> to their customers, {{in addition to}} the traditional Girocard. Those issuing banks will absorb the interbank fee that they are obliged to pay to the ATM operator under Visa regulations. Although the cards use the Visa credit card protocols, the funds are taken directly from a linked bank account just as with debit cards, and there are no cash advance fees. As surcharges for cash withdrawals are uncommon in Germany, almost any ATM in Germany can be used for free cash withdrawals with such a Visa card. This is however not the case of the ATMs of IC Cash, that as of July 2016 charges 6,50 EUR without informing their foreign customers.|$|R

50|$|In January 1995, Frank Riolfo, {{a former}} member of the Royal Army Medical Corps, {{attempted}} to blackmail Tesco, forcing the introduction of the previously trialed discount card. Threatening to inject AIDS-infected blood into stock, Riolfo demanded the company make loyalty cards available to customers. The cards, he specified, were to contain magnetic strips allowing them to secretly function as ATM cash <b>withdrawal</b> <b>cards.</b> Coded copies of the PIN code were published under his instruction in National newspapers. Clubcard was subsequently launched nationally with a Direct Marketing campaign by Evans Hunt Scott, Terry Hunt's advertising agency. Hundreds of customers, including Riolfo's wife, signed up to the scheme and collected a card. Riolfo and his wife then toured the country withdrawing cash until they were eventually caught on 22 April 1995. Frank Riolfo pleaded guilty and was jailed for six years, after appeal. Little coverage of these events remains online, although they were fictionalised by performance poet Alexander Velky as The Marketing Genius of Frank Riolfo. The loyalty card scheme was not discontinued.|$|R
30|$|In {{the related}} literature, to our knowledge, {{the impact of}} {{transactions}} at POS terminals on the substitution of cash for electronic payment {{has not yet been}} specifically explored and its relationship with ATM adoption remains largely unknown. The consumer adoption and merchant acceptance patterns of cards have been relatively slow in many countries and the usage and diffusion of cards at the ATM and at the POS have somehow overlapped. Humphrey et al. (1996) estimated a system of demand equations for five payment instruments (check, electronic or paper giro, credit card, and debit card) for 14 countries between 1987 and 1993 and found that although all payment instruments except debit cards substitute for cash. This result suggests that the use of debit <b>cards</b> for ATM <b>withdrawals</b> and POS transactions may impose some restrictions on the substitution of cash for cards. Similarly, Amromin and Chakravorti (2009) study changes in transactional demand for cash in 13 OECD countries from 1988 to 2007, showing that ATM withdrawals decrease with greater debit card usage at the POS. Studies by Humphrey and Berger (1990) or Humphrey et al. (2000) have also shown that efficient payment instrument pricing induces greater use of electronic payments, as it is cheaper than paper-based alternatives.|$|R

40|$|The goal of my {{bachelor}} work is {{the analysis}} of utilization of pay cards in the Czech Republic with the aim to identify the most advantageous product for a client. The partial goal {{of the work is}} general characterization of pay cards. The work is divided into two principal parts. The first part is a literary exploration of history and evolution of pay cards in the world and in the Czech Republic. In this part there is also a general characteristic of cards, definition of their types according to different criteria and options for their use. The second part deals with the task of analysing utilization of pay cards in the Czech Republic to eventually find the best product for predefined clientele. To attain this goal, questionnaires were distributed. Acquired data were transferred into graphs, tables and short commentaries. Lastly, the questionnaire outcome, from which was determined the target age group (age group 15 - 26 years) and specific orientation for the following comparison of chosen pay cards. We can conclude from this analysis, that for the age group 15 - 26 years is the most advantageous product the pay card form UniCredit Bank that belongs to U konto pro mladÃ©.

40|$|This thesis studies Kenyan households' use {{of savings}} {{accounts}} and malaria testing and treatment technologies. The first chapter studies {{whether or not}} married couples use savings accounts strategically. In the absence of commitment, {{the availability of a}} "private" savings technology (a device that is only accessible by a single owner) may incite individuals to take costly strategic savings action in order to manipulate the time path of consumption. This chapter presents a model that formalizes this idea and derives several testable theoretical implications. In particular, households where husbands and wives are well matched in terms of time preference should make greater use of joint (public) accounts, less use of individual (private) accounts, and make more efficient investment choices as compared to their poorly matched peers. The model informed the design of a field experiment where married couples in rural Kenya were given the opportunity to open joint and individual bank accounts at randomly assigned interest rates. The behavior of individuals in the experiment is inconsistent with ex-ante Pareto efficiency and a variety of alternative models of intrahousehold resource allocation, but consistent with the proposed model of strategic savings. Savings misallocation due to strategic behavior may be substantial: in the experiment poorly matched couples forgo at least 64 percent more interest than well matched couples. The second chapter studies the impact of reducing bank account transaction costs. Free ATM cards were offered to a randomly selected subset of newly opened formal bank accounts in Western Kenya. The ATM <b>card</b> reduced <b>withdrawal</b> fees by over 50 percent (from $ 0. 78 to $ 0. 38) and enabled account holders to make withdrawals from their accounts at any time of the day. The cards also enabled accounts to be accessed without the in-person verification of a national identity card. Targeting ATM cards to joint accounts and accounts owned by men substantially increased savings rates (by 39 percent) and average daily balances (by 16 percent) in the bank accounts. In contrast, the intervention had a negative impact when targeted to individual accounts owned by women. This gender difference appears to be driven by differences in bargaining power within the household: the positive treatment effect for men is concentrated in households where men have above median bargaining power, whereas the negative treatment effect for women is concentrated in households where women have below median bargaining power. The final chapter (co-authored with Jessica Cohen and Pascaline Dupas) uses data from a randomized controlled trial conducted with over 2, 900 households in rural Kenya to study the tradeoffs between the affordability of effective antimalarials (ACTs) and overuse. We compare a 95 -percent ACT subsidy (currently under consideration by the global health community) to an alternative policy regime that explicitly acknowledges the problem of overuse by providing access to a subsidized rapid diagnostic test for malaria (RDT) in tandem with subsidized ACTs. We find that ACT access increases by 60 percent in the presence of an ACT subsidy of 80 percent of more. Under the proposed 95 -percent ACT subsidy, however, only 56 percent of those buying an ACT at the drug shop test positive for malaria. We show that targeting could be substantially increased (without compromising access) when the ACT subsidy is reduced to 80 percent but accompanied by an RDT subsidy. by Simone Gabrielle Schaner.
