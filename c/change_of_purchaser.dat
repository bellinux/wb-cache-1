Besides, we examine the stock price <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>purchasers</b> and responding bargainors when the acquisitions occur and find that among acquisitions inside groups while the stock price <b>of</b> <b>purchasers</b> decrease significantly, the stock price of bargainors increase significantly,but among acquisitions outside groups the stock prices <b>of</b> <b>purchasers</b> and responding bargainors do not change significantly.

40|$|I examine price markups in monopolisticly-competitive {{markets that}} {{experience}} fluctuations in demand {{because the economy}} experiences cyclical fluctuations in productivity. Markups depend positively on the average income <b>of</b> <b>purchasers</b> in the market. For a nondurable good average income <b>of</b> <b>purchasers</b> is procyclical; so the markup is procyclical. For a durable good. however. the average income <b>of</b> <b>purchasers</b> is likely to decrease in booms because low income consumers of the good concentrate their purchases in boom periods; so the markup is likely countercyclical. This is particularly true for growing markets. I find markups make the aggregate economy fluctuate more in response to productivity if goods are sufficiently durable. ...|$|R

40|$|Nine-ending {{price and}} {{consumer}} behavior: An evaluation in a door-to-door buying context - The effect of nine-ending prices on consumer’s behavior was little studied whereas its practice is largely used.

The prices, given verbally, were either with a 9 -ending termination (1. 99 € an half-dozen of crepes) or with a "full" termination (2. 00 € the crepe half-dozen). The results show a positive effect of the " 9 -ending" prices on the rate <b>of</b> <b>purchasers</b> but not on the average basket.
