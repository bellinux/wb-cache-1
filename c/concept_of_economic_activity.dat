5000|$|The natural rate of {{unemployment}} is a <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>activity</b> developed in particular by Milton Friedman and Edmund Phelps in the 1960s, both {{recipients of the}} Nobel prize in economics. In both cases, {{the development of the}} concept is cited as a main motivation behind the prize.It represents the hypothetical unemployment rate consistent with aggregate production being at the [...] "long-run" [...] level. This level is consistent with aggregate production in the absence of various temporary frictions such as incomplete price adjustment in labor and goods markets. The natural rate {{of unemployment}} therefore corresponds to the unemployment rate prevailing under a classical view of determination of activity. It is mainly determined by the economy's supply side, and hence production possibilities and economic institutions. If these institutional features involve permanent mismatches in the labor market or real wage rigidities, the natural rate of unemployment may feature involuntary unemployment. The natural rate of unemployment is a combination of frictional and structural unemployment that persists in an efficient, expanding economy when labor and resource markets are in equilibrium.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{some problems}} which reduce {{the usefulness of}} Irish labour statistics as measures of women 2 ̆ 7 s, particularly married women 2 ̆ 7 s, labour activities. These problems arise both at a conceptual level ? principally {{in connection with the}} definition of the <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>activity</b> ? and at an operational level in the procedural bases of Census of Population and Labour Force Survey statistics. An examination of data on the female labour supply from these and other sources since the 1920 s shows that their meaning is often ambiguous, particularly up until the last two decades or so, and that in general they provide only partial coverage of women 2 ̆ 7 s role in the labour force. As a result much of our conventional understanding of female labour supply trends may need to be revised. The paper concludes by summarising what can and cannot be said from available statistics in this area and what precautions should be taken in using them in the future...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to show how T. M. Knox sought to conceptualise {{economic}} activity in the context of his philosophical background and in relation to the analysis of the nature of economics offered by Lionel Robbins. Design/methodology/approach – The paper presents an historical account of the development of Knox's thought, an exposition of his position in relation to that of Robbins and an analysis of the <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>activity.</b> Findings – The paper demonstrates the profound differences between an idealist conception of economics and a scientific conception of economics. It also shows the extent to which scientific conceptions are only one among a number of possible conceptions, and that they suffer from deep and perhaps unresolvable ambiguities. Originality/value – Lionel Robbins' work receives a certain amount of attention in the literature on the history of economic thought, whereas contemporary commentary by philosophers such as T. M. Knox is ignored by the histories of economic thought. This paper is unique in bringing the two together and in showing that the debate in the 1930 s about the foundations of economics goes beyond the discussions and advocates typically associated with it.

40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis {{is the study of}} a {{pastoral}} community in its regional context. The research was undertaken in 1979 - 1980 in the peasant community of Tomas in the central highlands of Peru. It focussed on four main areas: the domestic economy, levels of cash income and expenditure, the historical context and the networks involved in the wool economy. The body of theory which has been used in the present work concerns peasant economy and its relationship with capitalist development. The <b>concepts</b> <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>activity</b> fields and linkage analysis have been employed to form a framework for the analysis <b>of</b> the <b>economic</b> role <b>of</b> the household and its relationship with the peasant community and the regional economy. The research was undertaken by means of general participant observation and open-ended interviews with members of the community. In addition, a detailed study of the economies of 20 households was made through the medium of questionnaires on domestic production and consumption. Wider economic networks were followed up in order to investigate the relationships which all households have with the regional economy. Finally, historical depth was given to the research through the collection of personal life histories and case studies, {{as well as by the}} investigation of local, regional and national archives. The main conclusions of the thesis concern the recent orientation of domestic economy in Tomas. The commoditisation of pastoral products over many years has meant that almost all households have had long-term involvement in the cash economy. Lately, too, the diversification of the domestic economy in the face of communal and ecological constraints on pastoralism has led, for a growing number of households, to a decreasing reliance on communally controlled resources and a greater involvement in the wider regional economy. These tendencies indicate that, despite their physical isolation, the pastoralists of Tomas are fully integrated into the national economy of Peru...|$|R
40|$|Cultural {{diversity}} {{and human rights}} are mutually linked: human rights protect and promote cultural diversity while cultural diversity also forms {{an important aspect of}} the enjoyment of human rights. Cultural {{diversity and}} the economy are also increasingly connected, for example through cultural industries, trade in cultural goods, but also the protection of cultural heritage. The relationship between the three - human rights, cultural diversity and the economy - is, however, not fully clear. For instance, while cultural expressions such as paintings, books and films, fall within the scope of the right to freedom of expression, the trade in these products is not necessarily part of this human right. While the right to access to cultural heritage is considered part of the right to take part in cultural life, the economic issues related to the management of cultural heritage are not necessarily part of the human rights dimension. One of the areas in international human rights law where the link between human rights, culture and economy has been recognised and elaborated is the protection of rights of indigenous peoples against state-authorized <b>economic</b> <b>activities,</b> such as mining and logging operations. Several states have authorised (semi-) private companies to carry out <b>economic</b> <b>activities</b> on land where indigenous peoples live and where those peoples carry out their own <b>economic</b> <b>activities.</b> Precisely because these <b>economic</b> <b>activities</b> <b>of</b> indigenous peoples have a strong cultural dimension, they may fall within the realm of the protection of international human rights law. The uses to which such land is put by indigenous peoples, for example fishing, hunting or herding and breeding <b>activities,</b> have an <b>economic</b> dimension in that they provide labour, income and trade possibilities, but the way these <b>economic</b> <b>activities</b> are carried out has a strong cultural dimension. The use of the land and the ways animals are kept, killed and used, are firmly connected to the cultural identity of the community concerned, which triggers human rights protection. These rights of indigenous peoples have to be balanced against the interest of the state to promote economic development. This chapter explores how international supervisory bodies have dealt with this balance and which criteria they have set down to assess the interference by states with the rights of indigenous peoples to the protection <b>of</b> their <b>economic</b> <b>activities.</b> Section 1 examines the <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>activities</b> with a cultural dimension. Section 2 scrutinizes the jurisprudence of the UN Human Rights Committee. Section 3 critically assesses the jurisprudence of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights and the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights. The conclusion summarizes the findings and sums up the various criteria...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> embeddedness <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>activity</b> {{in relation to}} agriculture. In this perspective, <b>economic</b> <b>activity</b> can be considered dependent on cognitive structures, structures of social relations, culture, and political institutions. It has been concluded {{that the idea of}} embeddedness can be an interesting and useful analytical tool for the analysis <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>activity</b> undertaken by farmers. The article presents an analysis {{of the state of the}} art, as well uses selected information and data on the methodology of panel surveys carried out by the Institute of Agricultural and Food Economics - National Research Institute. Based on the analysis of the embeddedness theory, it is argued that embeddedness is not a coherent theoretical concept but rather a potential framework for investigating various <b>economic</b> issues. One <b>of</b> these issues is agricultural activity. Embeddedness framework constitutes a scheme which could organize an alternative approach to economic actions to mainstream agriculture economics...|$|R
40|$|The {{core of this}} {{dissertation}} analyses the compatibility of {{the limitation}} on benefits (LOB) clause in European Community (EC) Member State tax treaties with the United States (US) with EC law. This dissertation argues that the LOB clause is generally incompatible with the fundamental freedoms in the EC Treaty. In order to adequately remove the defects of the LOB clause, any anti-treaty shopping clause {{should be based on}} the theory <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> allegiance and should accurately assess a corporate taxpayer’s economic attachment to a contracting State. The most appropriate method to assess this economic attachment is to develop subjective economic criteria based on the theory of formulary apportionment. The LOB clause has a number of obtrusive defects in both its goal and its compatibility with the aims and objectives of a community of States such as the EC. This dissertation focuses {{on the question of whether}} the LOB clause is compatible with the fundamental freedoms of the EC Treaty. Answering this question involves considering complex legal issues in EC law such as the internal and external scope of EC law, the <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> an <b>economic</b> <b>activity,</b> the evolution <b>of</b> EC law and the exercise of discrimination by a non-Member State. This dissertation claims that EC law has not yet evolved to a stage where it will apply to a situation lacking a cross-border intra-Community <b>economic</b> <b>activity.</b> Consequently, a Member State may appropriately exclude certain non-active corporate residents from the benefits of its double tax treaties without infringing its obligations under the EC Treaty. This dissertation also evaluates the potential liability in damages of the Member States for concluding a tax treaty with the US that includes a LOB clause. This dissertation claims that the Member States will not be found liable for including the clause in their tax treaties due to the lack of incentive for a taxpayer to challenge the clause, and further due to the inability of a taxpayer to establish causation in any claim for damages. The LOB clause is a creature of bilateral tax treaties. The US government developed the clause in an aim to restrict treaty shopping, reduce the erosion of it tax base and preserve its balance of payments as the <b>economic</b> position <b>of</b> the US changed substantially from the 1960 s to the 1980 s. This significant economic change prompted the US Treasury Department to develop the LOB clause in its modern form. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
