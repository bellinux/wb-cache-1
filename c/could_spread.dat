5|$|As {{public concern}} over the {{accident}} grew while information and education was limited, misconceptions arose {{about the nature of}} radiation hazards. Residents near a Buddhist temple protested and prevented the cremation of one of the victims, believing that the body <b>could</b> <b>spread</b> radiation, despite assurances by the OAEP to the contrary.|$|E
5|$|The {{prevailing}} {{thought in}} Victorian healthcare concerning {{the transmission of}} contagious diseases was the miasma theory, which held that most communicable diseases were caused by the inhalation of contaminated air. This contamination could {{take the form of}} the odour of rotting corpses or sewage, but also rotting vegetation, or the exhaled breath of someone already diseased. Miasma was believed by most to be the vector of transmission of cholera, which was on the rise in 19th-century Europe. The disease was deeply feared by all, because of the speed with which it <b>could</b> <b>spread,</b> and its high fatality rates.|$|E
5|$|The state {{government}} {{have tried to}} proposed a new ferry terminal in the town to attract more tourist particularly from the Philippines and also from Indonesia. But the proposal was turned down due to the trouble in the southern Philippines which <b>could</b> <b>spread</b> {{to the state and}} there is a call from the former Chief Minister of Sabah and the Current President of Sabah Progressive Party Yong Teck Lee to suspend the ferry service to counter the high level of people migration from the Philippines which now has become the major problem to Sabah as they are overstaying in the state and becoming an illegal immigrants.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{similarities}} between the perpetrators, the murders were compared by Czech media and experts to a mass murder that took place two years before in Frenštát pod Radhoštěm, another Moravian town lying 90km northwards. In the attack, a 57-year-old man, Antonín Blažek, attempted {{to blow up a}} block of flats after having been ordered to vacate his flat that had been foreclosed by creditors. He first blocked both exits from the building, and then removed and opened the main gas supply into the building's corridor. Interrupted, Blažek set the gas on fire before the gas <b>could</b> <b>spread</b> throughout the whole building. The explosion and subsequent fire, however, were large enough to demolish part of the building, killing Blažek and five other people immediately and wounding eleven others, one of whom died on 17 February 2015.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the {{agreement}} between Salih and Mansur fell through {{as the latter}} abandoned most of his promises to Salih, including giving his daughter's hand in marriage and according the Kilab their share of Aleppo's revenues. Salih retaliated by besieging Aleppo, while the Kilab and their Bedouin allies plundered the countryside. Mansur appealed for Byzantine intervention and warned Emperor Basil II that if left unchecked, the Bedouin uprising <b>could</b> <b>spread</b> to his territory. Basil dispatched 1,000 Armenian relief troops in response, but withdrew them after Salih informed him of Mansur's treachery and pledged his goodwill to the Byzantines. Basil may have also acquiesced to Salih to avoid provoking Bedouin raids against his territory as the emirates of both the Kilab and their Numayri kinsmen bordered the Byzantines. The withdrawal of Byzantine troops weakened Mansur's position further and strengthened Salih, who dispatched {{one of his sons}} to Constantinople to pay allegiance to Basil.|$|E
5|$|Scully {{learns that}} the {{lockdown}} population is infected with an exceedingly deadly contagion, finding {{a pile of}} body bags stored for incineration in the prison's boiler room. Scully cuts open Torrance's body bag and examines his corpse, but Dr. Osbourne, {{a member of the}} CDC team, tries to stop her. A pustule on Torrance's body erupts in Osbourne's face, causing him to flee the room. Meanwhile, the fugitives steal an RV and stop at a gas station, where Paul calls his girlfriend, Elizabeth, looking for shelter. The station's clerk finds an infected Steve in the restroom; he is knocked unconscious by Paul. Scully calls Mulder after the Marshals raid the gas station, telling him that the contagion <b>could</b> <b>spread</b> into the population if the fugitives are not captured. Mulder sees a CDC biohazard team arrive at the scene, forcibly taking away the clerk in a helicopter.|$|E

5|$|Initially, Hananu logistically {{supported}} the guerrilla operations of Barakat against the French in the Antioch region. He later decided {{to organize a}} rebellion in Aleppo and its countryside. Hananu was motivated to act {{by what he saw}} as the ineffectiveness of the Syrian National Congress, the legislative body of Faisal's state of which Hananu was a member, in preventing French rule. He may also have been encouraged by Rashid al-Tali'a, the Arab government's district governor of Hama, who had been supporting Saleh al-Ali and the Alawite-dominated revolt he was leading against the French in the Syrian coastal mountains. Meanwhile, the Syrian National Congress proclaimed the establishment of the Arab Kingdom of Syria in March 1920. France was wary that a popular nationalist movement emanating from Faisal's kingdom <b>could</b> <b>spread</b> to Lebanon and French territories in North Africa, and moved {{to put an end to}} Faisal's state. Anti-French resistance manifested at local level as the Committees of National Defense, which began springing up in Aleppo and its hinterland. The committees were founded by members of the local elite, many of whom were sympathetic to Ottoman rule, but the committees quickly became fueled by populist agitation against French colonialism.|$|E
5|$|RNA {{interference}} is a {{vital part}} of the immune response to viruses and other foreign genetic material, especially in plants where it may also prevent the self-propagation of transposons. Plants such as Arabidopsis thaliana express multiple dicer homologs that are specialized to react differently when the plant is exposed to different viruses. Even before the RNAi pathway was fully understood, it was known that induced gene silencing in plants <b>could</b> <b>spread</b> throughout the plant in a systemic effect and could be transferred from stock to scion plants via grafting. This phenomenon has since been recognized as a feature of the plant adaptive immune system and allows the entire plant to respond to a virus after an initial localized encounter. In response, many plant viruses have evolved elaborate mechanisms to suppress the RNAi response. These include viral proteins that bind short double-stranded RNA fragments with single-stranded overhang ends, such as those produced by dicer. Some plant genomes also express endogenous siRNAs in response to infection by specific types of bacteria. These effects may be part of a generalized response to pathogens that downregulates any metabolic process in the host that aids the infection process.|$|E

25|$|The massacres {{began with}} {{incidents}} in the Ottoman interior in 1894, gained full force in 1894–96, and tapered off in 1897, as international condemnation brought pressure to bear on Abdul Hamid. Although the Ottomans had previously suppressed other revolts, the harshest measures were directed against the Armenian community. They observed no distinction between ages or genders, and massacred them with brutal force. This occurred {{at a time when}} the telegraph <b>could</b> <b>spread</b> news around the world, and the massacres received extensive coverage in the media of Western Europe and the United States.|$|E
25|$|Space {{disposal}} {{is attractive}} because it removes nuclear waste from the planet.

25|$|Plague of Athens, 430 BC. Possibly {{typhoid fever}} killed {{a quarter of}} the Athenian troops, and {{a quarter of the}} {{population}} over four years. This disease fatally weakened the dominance of Athens, but the sheer virulence of the disease prevented its wider spread; i.e. it killed off its hosts at a rate faster than they <b>could</b> <b>spread</b> it. The exact cause of the plague was unknown for many years. In January 2006, researchers from the University of Athens analyzed teeth recovered from a mass grave underneath the city, and confirmed the presence of bacteria responsible for typhoid.|$|E

25|$|In the past, grain {{elevators}} sometimes experienced silo explosions. Fine powder {{from the}} millions of grains passing through the facility would accumulate and mix with the oxygen in the air. A spark <b>could</b> <b>spread</b> from one floating particle to the other creating a chain reaction that would destroy the entire structure. (This dispersed-fuel explosion is the mechanism behind fuel-air bombs.) To prevent this, elevators have very rigorous rules against smoking or any other open flame. Many elevators also have various devices installed to maximize ventilation, safeguards against overheating in belt conveyors, legs, bearing, and explosion-proof electrical devices such as electric motors, switches, and lighting.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the impacts}} of deep sea mining, {{sediment}} plumes could have the greatest impact. Plumes are caused when the tailings from mining (usually fine particles) are dumped back into the ocean, creating a cloud of particles floating in the water. Two types of plumes occur: near-bottom plumes and surface plumes. Near-bottom plumes occur when the tailings are pumped {{back down to the}} mining site. The floating particles increase the turbidity, or cloudiness, of the water, clogging filter-feeding apparatuses used by benthic organisms. Surface plumes cause a more serious problem. Depending {{on the size of the}} particles and water currents the plumes <b>could</b> <b>spread</b> over vast areas. The plumes could impact zooplankton and light penetration, in turn affecting the food web of the area.|$|E
25|$|The {{sweet potato}} was grown in Polynesia before western exploration. Sweet potato has been radiocarbon-dated in the Cook Islands to 1000 AD, and current {{thinking}} {{is that it was}} brought to central Polynesia around 700 AD, possibly by Polynesians who had traveled to South America and back, and spread across Polynesia to Hawaii and New Zealand from there. It is possible, however, that South Americans brought it to the Pacific, although this is unlikely as it was the Polynesians who had a strong maritime tradition and not the native South Americans. The theory that the plant <b>could</b> <b>spread</b> by floating seeds across the ocean is not supported by evidence. Another point is that the sweet potato in Polynesia is the cultivated Ipomoea batatas, which is generally spread by vine cuttings and not by seeds.|$|E
