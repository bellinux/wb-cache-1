5000|$|Thromboelastography (TEG) is {{a method}} of testing the {{efficiency}} of blood coagulation. It is a test mainly used in surgery and anesthesiology, although few centers are capable of performing it. More common tests of blood coagulation include prothrombin time (PT,INR) and partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) which measure coagulation factor function, but TEG also can assess platelet function, <b>clot</b> <b>strength,</b> and fibrinolysis which these other tests cannot.|$|E
50|$|Cytochalasin {{has found}} {{practical}} application in thromboelastometry (TEM) whole blood assays {{for the assessment}} of fibrinogen and fibrin polymerization disorders in the FIBTEM assay on ROTEM. This test is based on the principle that cytochalasin D very effectively inhibits platelet function by inhibition of the contractile elements. The platelet inhibition is more effective than when platelets are blocked by GPIIb/IIIa antagonists. In vitro and clinical data indicate that the <b>clot</b> <b>strength</b> in FIBTEM increases in a fibrinogen concentration-dependent manner independent of platelet count. Therefore, fibrinogen deficiency or fibrin polymerization disorders can be rapidly detected.|$|E
5000|$|Four {{values that}} {{represent}} clot formation {{are determined by}} this test: the reaction time (R value), the K value, the angle and the maximum amplitude (MA). The R value represents the time until the first evidence of a clot is detected. The K value is the time {{from the end of}} R until the clot reaches 20mm and this represents the speed of clot formation. The angle is the tangent of the curve made as the K is reached and offers similar information to K. The MA is a reflection of <b>clot</b> <b>strength.</b> A mathematical formula determined by the manufacturer can be used to determine a Coagulation Index (CI) (or overall assessment of coagulability) which takes into account the relative contribution of each of these 4 values into 1 equation.The G-value is a log-derivation of the MA and is meant to also represent the <b>clot</b> <b>strength</b> using dynes/sec as its units. There are some studies which suggest that an elevated G-value is associated with a hypercoagulable state and therefore increases the risk for venous thromboembolic disease. However, there are no studies dosing of prophylactic heparin products based on the G-value. TEG also measures clot lysis which is reported as both the estimated percent lysis (EPL) and the percentage of clot which has actually lysed after 30 minutes (LY 30,%). Although a normal EPL can be as high as 15% and a normal LY 30 can be has high as 8%, some studies in the trauma population suggest that a LY30 greater than 3% is associated with risk of hemorrhage.|$|E

40|$|Current {{commercial}} tubes {{have difficulties}} in producing "true" serum from all blood samples {{even within the}} recommended clotting times. Hence, Becton Dickinson (BD) and now Greiner have produced tubes containing thrombin as the procoagulant to reduce the clotting time and increase the possibility of producing serum from anticoagulated blood samples. The Greiner BCA Fast Clot (GBBCAFC) tube was evaluated in a hospital environment using 40 participants, (30 healthy and 10 undergoing renal dialysis) for 32 analytes against the Greiner lithium heparin tube and the BD Rapid Serum Tubes (BD RST) tube measured on Beckman DxC 800 and DxI 800 analyzers. <b>Clotting</b> <b>strength</b> was also examined using thromboelastography (TEG). The analytes results showed {{there was a very}} close agreement between the BD RST tube and GBBCAFC tube in comparison with lithium heparin plasma. The result comparison data showed equivalent performance with lower levels of hemolysis. The prolonged storage study also showed very similar agreement between the BD RST and the GBBCAFC tubes. Likewise, the TEG data showed there was very little difference in clotting ability between the tubes, and neither was capable of producing true serum from blood spiked with 2 U heparin/mL of blood. The study showed the GBBCAFC tube with the combination of the two procoagulants blood clotting activator and thrombin produced comparable performance with the lithium heparin plasma and the BD RST serum samples...|$|R

This study compared the Thrombelastography (TEG) and biomarker profiles upon admission in trauma patients. Methods Prospective observational study of 80 trauma patients admitted to a Level I Trauma Centre. Data on demography, biochemistry including standard coagulation tests, hematology, transfusions, Injury Severity Score (ISS) and TEG were recorded. Retrospective analysis of thawed plasma/serum for biomarkers reflecting tissue injury (histone-complexed DNA fragments), sympathoadrenal activation (adrenaline, noradrenaline), coagulation activation/inhibition and fibrinolysis (sCD 40 L, protein C, activated Protein C, tissue-type plasminogen activator, plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1, D-dimer, prothrombinfragment 1 + 2, plasmin/α 2 -antiplasmin complex, thrombin/antithrombin complex, tissue factor pathway inhibitor, antithrombin, von willebrand factor, factor XIII). Comparison of patients stratified according to ISS/TEG maximum <b>clot</b> <b>strength.</b> Linear regression analysis of variables associated with <b>clot</b> <b>strength.</b> Results Trauma patients had normal (86 %), hypercoagulable (11 %) or hypocoagulable (1 %) TEG clot strength; one had primary hyperfibrinolysis. Hypercoagulable patients had higher age, fibrinogen and platelet count (all p 10 red blood cells the initial 24 h). Patients with normal or hypercoagulable TEG <b>clot</b> <b>strength</b> had comparable biomarker profiles, but the few patients with hypocoagulable TEG <b>clot</b> <b>strength</b> and/or hyperfibrinolysis had very different biomarker profiles.

40|$|Objectives: Patients with {{peripheral}} {{artery disease}} have walking impairment, greater thrombotic risk, {{and are often}} treated with exercise training. We sought {{to determine the effect}} of a 3 -month-long exercise program on <b>clot</b> <b>strength</b> among patients with peripheral artery disease and intermittent claudication. Methods: Twenty-three symptomatic peripheral artery disease patients were randomly assigned to a walking exercise program or to an attention control group who performed light resistance exercise. We investigated the effect of exercise training on <b>clot</b> <b>strength</b> and time to clot formation was assessed by thromboelastography. Results: After 3 [*]months of exercise, <b>clot</b> <b>strength</b> (maximal amplitude) and time to clot formation (R) did not change significantly from baseline, even after improvements in claudication onset time (p[*]<[*] 0. 01) and peak walking time (p[*]<[*] 0. 05). Furthermore, changes in clot formation parameters were not significantly different between groups. Among the 10 individuals demonstrating a reduction in <b>clot</b> <b>strength</b> (reduced maximal amplitude), one was a smoker (10 %) compared to 9 of 13 non-responders (69 %) whose maximal amplitude was unchanged or increased (p[*]=[*] 0. 0097). Conclusion: In this ancillary study, a 12 -week walking program improved ambulatory function in peripheral artery disease patients with claudication, but does not modify <b>clot</b> <b>strength</b> or time to clot formation. Larger studies are needed to confirm these hypothesis generating findings and to determine whether a different amount or type of exercise may induce a change in clotting in this patient population...|$|E
40|$|SummaryObjectiveChitosan–glycerol {{phosphate}} (chitosan-GP) is {{a unique}} polymer solution that is mixed with whole blood and solidified over microfractured or drilled articular cartilage defects in order to elicit a more hyaline repair cartilage. For clinical ease-of-use, a faster in situ solidification is preferred. Therefore, we investigated the mechanisms underlying chitosan–GP/blood implant solidification. MethodsIn vitro solidification of chitosan–GP/blood mixtures, with or without added clotting factors, was evaluated by thromboelastography. Serum was analyzed for the onset of thrombin, platelet, and FXIII activation. In vivo solidification of chitosan–GP/blood mixtures, with and without clotting factors, was evaluated in microdrilled cartilage defects of adult rabbits (N= 41 defects). ResultsChitosan–GP/blood clots solidified in an atypical biphasic manner, with higher initial viscosity and minor platelet activation followed {{by the development of}} <b>clot</b> tensile <b>strength</b> concomitant with thrombin generation, burst platelet and FXIII activation. Whole blood and chitosan–GP/blood clots developed a similar final <b>clot</b> tensile <b>strength,</b> while polymer–blood <b>clots</b> showed a unique, sustained platelet factor release and greater resistance to lysis by tissue plasminogen activator. Thrombin, tissue factor (TF), and recombinant human activated factor VII (rhFVIIa) accelerated chitosan–GP/blood solidification in vitro (P< 0. 05). Pre-application of thrombin or rhFVIIa+TF to the surface of drilled cartilage defects accelerated implant solidification in vivo (P< 0. 05). ConclusionsChitosan–GP/blood implants solidify through coagulation mechanisms involving thrombin generation, platelet activation and fibrin polymerization, leading to a dual fibrin–polysaccharide clot scaffold that resists lysis and is physically more stable than normal blood clots. Clotting factors have the potential to enhance the practical use, the residency, and therapeutic activity of polymer–blood implants...|$|R

Methods: 29 menopausal {{women with a}} history of venous thromboembolic disease were included. Nine patients composed the treatment (HT) group and 20 the control group. Coagulation was assessed by thromboelastography in samples of whole blood and platelet-poor plasma (PPP). The following thromboelastographic variables were measured: time for initial coagulation (R), blood clotting speed (K and the a angle), <b>clot</b> tensile <b>strength</b> (MA and G), global index of coagulation (Cl) and fibrinolysis (LY 30) and fibrinogen levels.

40|$|A fibrinogen-fibronectin complex (γγ’pdFI-pdFN) was {{purified}} {{from normal}} human plasma using {{a sequence of}} cryoprecipitation, ammonium sulfate fractionation, and DEAE Sepharose chromatography. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) under reducing condition showed both a 1 : 1 stoichiometric ratio of fibrinogen (FI) to fibronectin (FN) {{as well as a}} stoichiometric ratio of 1 : 1 of γg to gγ’. The γγ’pdFI-pdFN complex was non-covalent in nature as it was disrupted by affinity adsorption to Gelatin Sepharose where pdFN bound strongly and the disrupted γγ’pdFI fell through the chromatographic column. Surprisingly, the purified γγ’pdFI-pdFN complex was more broadly thermally stable than plasma FI (pdFI) preparations not containing plasma FN (pdFN) and was stable at physiologic pH, ionic strength and temperature. The complex appeared as a compact species that was distinctly larger than pdFN alone when analyzed by high pressure size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC). Dynamic light scattering (DLS) showed that the native γγ’pdFI-pdFN complex is a more compact form at low ionic strength but adopt and extended conformation in high salt and denaturing conditions. DLS also showed that FN decreased the degree of polydispersity and hydrodynamic radius of both gg and gg’ FI, indicating that FN interact with both subspecies. The clottability of the native γγ’pdFI-pdFN complex and mixtures of FN with unfractionated FI and FI subspecies was evaluated by Thromboelastography (TEG) assay. The γγ’pdFI-pdFN complex had appreciably enhanced <b>clotting</b> <b>strength</b> than comparable mixtures of FI and FN. FN had not effect on the polymerization rates of fibrin clots. FN, however, showed greater influence on the shear <b>strength</b> of fibrin <b>clots</b> {{even in the absence of}} factor FXIII mediated crosslinking. The maximal amplitude and shear strength increased over the entire range of FN concentrations for clots made from unfractionated FI and gg’FI. FN had mixed effect on the rigidity of clots made from ggFI. While high concentrations of FN enhanced the maximal amplitude and shear modulus, low concentrations decreased both factors.

40|$|ObjectivesWe {{investigated}} {{the relation of}} high ex vivo platelet reactivity, rapid fibrin generation, and high thrombin-induced <b>clot</b> <b>strength</b> to postdischarge ischemic events in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). BackgroundHigh platelet reactivity and rapid fibrin generation may affect the incidence of ischemic events after PCI. However, limited data is available to link these ex vivo markers to the occurrence of events. MethodsWe measured platelet reactivity to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) by light transmittance aggregometry (LTA) in patients undergoing PCI (n = 192). <b>Clot</b> <b>strength,</b> a measure of thrombin-induced fibrin and platelet interactions, and the time to initial fibrin generation, a marker of thrombin activity, were measured by thrombelastography. The relation of these measurements to ischemic event occurrence was prospectively examined over six months. ResultsA total of 100 % and 84 % of patients were on aspirin and clopidogrel therapy, respectively, {{at the time of}} the initial event. Posttreatment ADP-induced aggregation by LTA (63 ± 12 % vs. 56 ± 15 %, p = 0. 02) and <b>clot</b> <b>strength</b> (MA) were higher (74 ± 5 mm vs. 65 ± 4 mm, p < 0. 001) and time to initial fibrin generation was shorter (4. 3 ± 1. 3 min vs. 5. 9 ± 1. 5 min, p < 0. 001) in patients with events (n = 38). The event rates in the highest quartiles of LTA and MA were 32 % and 58 %, respectively. ConclusionsHigh platelet reactivity and <b>clot</b> <b>strength,</b> and rapid fibrin formation are novel risk factors for ischemic events after PCI. <b>Clot</b> <b>strength</b> is more predictive than ADP-induced platelet aggregation and may explain the occurrence of events despite treatment with cyclooxygenase- 1 and P 2 Y 12 inhibitors...|$|E
40|$|Background. Colloids {{are often}} used after cardiac surgery as {{intravascular}} volume replace-ment therapy. Cardiac surgical patients have {{an increased risk of}} bleeding. Both hydroxyethyl-starch (HES) and gelatin solutions impair haemostasis. We examined the impact and dose effect on coagulation of HES 130 / 0. 4, gelatin, or Ringer’s acetate solutions after cardiac surgery. Methods. Forty-five patients received three boluses (each 7 ml kg 21) of either 6 % HES 130 / 0. 4, 4 % gelatin, or Ringer’s acetate solution after elective cardiac surgery. The infusion of study solution was continued in the dose 7 ml kg 21 over the following 12 h. The total dose of study solution was 28 ml kg 21. Hypovolaemia was treated with Ringer’s acetate.

Martini et al. concluded from their studies that the functional changes of the coagulation cascade are due to platelet dysfunction from hypothermia and depletion of fibrinogen and platelets from haemorrhage and resuscitation. When hypothermia and haemorrhage were combined, all abovementioned parameters were impaired [34, 36].|$|E
40|$|Background: Patients with cyanotic {{congenital}} {{heart disease}} (CCHD) have haemostatic abnormities associated with bleeding and thrombo-embolic events. The haemostatic abnormalities are not fully understood, but recent studies indicate that elevated haematocrit and fibrinogen function may be of importance. The {{aim of this study}} was to characterise the haemostatic profile and examine the potential role of haematocrit on <b>clot</b> formation and <b>strength</b> in CCHD patients. Furthermore to examine whether CCHD patients with history of haemoptysis have diminished fibrinogen function compared to those without haemoptysis. Methods: In a prospective study 75 adult CCHD patients had haematocrit, platelet count, and plasma fibrinogen concentration examined. Furthermore thrombelastography(TEG) as well as TEG Functional Fibrinogen(TEG FF) assay evaluating fibrinogen function(FLEV) was performed. Data were compared with historical data regarding previous haemoptysis in CCHD patients. Results: Haematocrit was 57 +/- 8 % and platelet counts in the lower normal range. TEG revealed a hypocoagulable condition with impaired clot formation. TEG values were correlated to haematocrit, indicating that elevated haematocrit causes impaired <b>clot</b> formation and <b>strength.</b> Despite high levels of plasma fibrinogen, TEG FF demonstrated that FLEV was diminished and negatively correlated to haematocrit. Furthermore CCHD patients with previous history of haemoptysis had significantly lower FLEV compared to CCHD patients without haemoptysis. Conclusion: Patients with CCHD are hypocoagulable mainly due to impaired fibrinogen function. Despite a low platelet count, platelet function does not seem to be severely affected in CCHD patients. Haemostasis, and especially fibrinogen function, is negatively affected by elevated haematocrit, and fibrinogen function is diminished in CCHD patients with haemoptysis.

40|$|Genetic {{fibrinogen}} (FGN) variants {{that are}} associated with bleeding or thrombosis may be informative about fibrin polymerisation, structure and fibrinolysis. We report a four generation family with thrombosis and heritable dysfibrinogenaemia segregating with a c. [1541 delC];[=] variation in FGA (FGN-Perth). This deletion predicts a truncated FGN αC-domain with an unpaired terminal Cys at residue 517 of FGN-Aα. In keeping with this, SDS-PAGE of purified FGN-Perth identified a truncated FGN-Aα chain with increased co-purification of albumin, consistent with disulphide bonding to the terminal Cys of the variant FGN-Aα. <b>Clot</b> visco-elastic <b>strength</b> in whole blood containing FGN-Perth was greater than controls and tPA-mediated fibrinolysis was delayed. In FGN-Perth plasma and in purified FGN-Perth, there was markedly reduced final turbidity after thrombin-mediated clot generation. Consistent with this, FGN-Perth formed tighter, thinner fibrin fibres than controls indicating defective lateral aggregation of protofibrils. Clots generated with thrombin in FGN-Perth plasma were resistant to tPA-mediated fibrinolysis. FGN-Perth clot also displayed impaired tPA-mediated plasmin generation but incorporated α 2 -antiplasmin at a similar rate to control. Impaired fibrinolysis because of defective plasmin generation potentially explains the FGN-Perth clinical phenotype. These findings highlight the importance of the FGN αC-domain in the regulation of clot formation and fibrinolysis...|$|R
40|$|Objective. Increased {{fibrinolysis}} {{with the}} risk of bleeding {{is a consequence of}} thrombolytic therapy and can also be seen in clinical situations such as acute trauma. Thrombelastography and thrombelastometry are viscoelastic coagulation instruments that can detect higher degrees of fibrinolysis; hyperfibrinolysis. A newer viscoelastic instrument is the ReoRox, which uses free oscillation rheometry to detect <b>clot</b> formation, <b>strength</b> and fibrinolysis. The ReoRox has a new test for detection of fibrinolysis, called ReoLyse. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare ReoRox with its new ReoLyse test with rotational thrombelastometry (ROTEM) in the monitoring of in vitro-induced fibrinolysis. Methods. Whole blood from 10 healthy volunteers was mixed with tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) to obtain seven different plasma concentrations (0, 0. 25, 0. 5, 0. 75, 1, 3 and 5 μg/mL). Whole blood samples with the different t-PA plasma concentrations were analyzed with ROTEM EXTEM and FIBTEM tests, ReoRox standard test Fib 1 (clot formation/strength) and ReoLyse (fibrinolysis) tests. Results. The fibrinolysis variables with the best dose-response effect were the ReoRox ReoLyse lysis variables and ROTEM EXTEM Time to complete lysis. However, these variables only detected high t-PA levels (> 1 μg/mL). Conclusions. The new ReoRox ReoLyse test provides more information on fibrinolysis compared to the ReoRox Fib 1 program. Neither ReoRox nor ROTEM could detect lower degrees of fibrinolysis. ReoRox is a valuable alternative to ROTEM to study high degrees of fibrinolysis and should be evaluated in clinical situations with increased fibrinolysis and during therapeutic thrombolysis...|$|R
30|$|Early {{monitoring}} of coagulation {{is essential to}} identify coagulopathy during trauma and to facilitate goal-directed transfusion. However, conventional plasma-based coagulation tests, such as prothrombin time (PT), {{activated partial thromboplastin time}} (APTT), international normalized ratio (INR), fibrinogen, and platelet number, only reflect the initiation of the hemostatic process; the tests cannot be used to evaluate the amplification of propagation or increased fibrinolysis. Whole blood assays, such as TEG or ROTEM, provide rapid evaluation of <b>clot</b> formation, <b>strength,</b> and lysis, which reflect the entire hemostatic process [36, 37]. There is emerging evidence for the clinical application of these bedside techniques during trauma. The use of these techniques has profoundly modified the transfusion strategy of some clinical teams. For instance, Schöchl et al. [27, 28] explored goal-directed coagulation management using fibrinogen concentrate and prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), administered according to ROTEM measurements. In a retrospective analysis, these authors compared patients from their trauma center and patients from a trauma register and reported that this goal-directed coagulation management strategy could reduce the need for RBC or platelet concentrate transfusion, in relation to FFP-based hemostatic therapy. RBC transfusion was avoided in 29 % of the patients in the fibrinogen-PCC group compared with only 3 % of the patients in the FFP group; there was a comparable mortality rate in both groups. This approach is interesting, especially with respect to the potential risks of transfusion. The transfusions of FFP and platelet concentrates have been associated with an increased risk of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and acute respiratory distress syndrome [38 – 40]. However, the issue of an increased risk of venous thromboembolism with a fibrinogen concentrate-PCC strategy has not been addressed.|$|R
40|$|The {{contribution}} of fibrin stabilization to <b>clot</b> <b>strength,</b> measured as the static elastic modulus, was evaluated in human plasma by two independent procedures. In the first approach, amine inhibitors of fibrin stabilization were examined for {{their effects on}} the rigidity of normal plasma clots.

Though the compounds tested were of different chemical structures and potencies, a fivefold reduction in <b>clot</b> <b>strength</b> was obtained in each instance. This value of 20 % of normal seems to correspond to the rigidity of the Factor XIII-deficient plasma clot because, as demonstrated by the second approach, when a plasma specimen that genetically lacked the fibrin stabilizing factor was supplemented by the addition of measured amounts of the purified zymogen, a fivefold increase in <b>clot</b> <b>strength</b> could be achieved. The described procedure of evaluating Factor XIII in terms of correcting the elastic modulus of a deficient plasma clot is considered an important assay for the functional competence of purified preparations of the zymogen for the purpose of therapeutic application...|$|E

We hypothesize that oxygen transport measurements will be associated with <b>clot</b> <b>strength</b> during traumatic shock, and test this hypothesis using a swine model of controlled traumatic shock. Methods N = 33 swine were subjected to femur fracture and hemorrhagic shock by controlled arterial bleeding to a predetermined level of oxygen debt measured by continuous indirect calorimetry. Hemodynamics, oxygen consumption, systemic central venous oxygenation (ScvO 2), base excess, lactate, and clot maximal amplitude by TEG (TEG-MA) as <b>clot</b> <b>strength</b> were measured at baseline and again when oxygen debt = 80 ml/kg during shock. Oxygen transport and metabolic markers of tissue perfusion were then evaluated for significant associations with TEG-MA. Forward stepwise selection was then used to create regression models identifying the strongest associations between oxygen transport and TEG-MA independent of other known determinants of <b>clot</b> <b>strength.</b> Results Multiple markers of tissue perfusion, oxygen transport, and TEG-MA were all significantly altered during shock compared to baseline measurements (p 2 demonstrated a strong bivariate association with TEG-MA measured during shock (R = 0. 7, p 2 measured during shock was also selected by forward stepwise selection as an important covariate in linear regression models of TEG-MA after adjusting for the covariates fibrinogen, pH, platelet count, and hematocrit (Whole model R 2 = 0. 99, p ≤ 0. 032). Conclusions Among multiple measurements of oxygen transport, only ScvO 2 was found to retain a significant association with TEG-MA during shock after adjusting for multiple covariates. ScvO 2 should be further studied for its utility as a clinical marker of both tissue hypoxia and clot formation during traumatic shock. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background Haemodilution and {{hypothermia}} induce coagulopathy separately, {{but their}} combined effect on coagulation {{has not been}} widely studied. Fibrinogen concentrate can correct dilutional coagulopathy and has an additional effect when combined with factor XIII concentrate. However, their effect on dilutional coagulopathy concomitant with hypothermia has not been studied previously. Free oscillation rheometry – FOR (Reorox®) – is a novel viscoelastic haemostatic assay {{that has not been}} studied in this context before. Methods Blood from 10 healthy volunteers was diluted by 33 % with hydroxyethyl starch or Ringer’s acetate solutions. Effects of fibrinogen added in vitro with and without factor XIII were studied at 33 °C and 37 °C. Coagulation velocity (coagulation time) and <b>clot</b> <b>strength</b> (elasticity) were assessed with FOR. Coagulation was initiated in vitro with thromboplastin alone, or thromboplastin plus a platelet inhibitor. Results Hydroxyethyl starch increased the coagulation time and decreased <b>clot</b> <b>strength</b> significantly more than Ringer’s acetate solution, both in the presence and absence of a platelet inhibitor. There was a significant interaction between haemodilution with hydroxyethyl starch and hypothermia, resulting in increased coagulation time. After addition of fibrinogen, coagulation time shortened and elasticity increased, with the exception of fibrinogen-dependent <b>clot</b> <b>strength</b> (i. e., elasticity {{in the presence of a}} platelet inhibitor) after hydroxyethyl starch haemodilution. Factor XIII had an additional effect with fibrinogen on fibrinogen-dependent <b>clot</b> <b>strength</b> in blood diluted with Ringer’s acetate solution. Hypothermia did not influence any of the coagulation factor effects. Conclusions Both haemodilution and mild hypothermia impaired coagulation. Coagulopathy was more pronounced after haemodilution with hydroxyethyl starch than with Ringer’s acetate. Addition of fibrinogen with factor XIII was unable to reverse hydroxyethyl starch induced clot instability, but improved coagulation in blood diluted with Ringer’s acetate solution. Fibrinogen improved coagulation irrespective of hypothermia. Funding Agencies|Region Skane (Sweden) ||CSL Beehring||</p...|$|E
40|$|In {{the course}} of {{experimental}} work on the prob-lem of autologous plasma clot suture of nerves (1), the desirability of in vitro tests of plasma clots became apparent and an instrument and method which might serve the purpose were de-vised. Since the procedure seemed likely to be useful to other workers, it was reported (2) while we were still accumulating the data now pre-sented. Methods for measuring the tensile <b>strength</b> of <b>clots</b> have been used previously. Fonio (3) cen-trifuged 6 cc. quantities of blood mixed with 2 cc. of 0. 75 per cent MgSO, to retard clotting, al-lowed spontaneous clotting of the supernatant,plasma, then cut the plasma clot free of the cellular portion below. After compressing the clot in a special press to a 0. 5 X 1. 0 cm. disc, it was fixed in ether and then clipped above and below in its shorter dimension. Weights were then added until the clot broke and the maximal weight held recorded. The tensile strength of such fibrin discs was found to vary in individuals, the normal range being from about 250 to 350 grams. In diseased individuals, {{he found that the}} values ob-tained were often greater or less than the normal (4). He did not attempt to correlate this varia-tion with any property or constituent of the blood. Kristenson (5) used a slightly different tech-nique; he did not add any anticoagulant and al-lowed the clot to retain its natural shape. Clots were formed from chilled plasma, in test-tubes of uniform bore, and fixed in ether. He suggested that variations in <b>clot</b> tensile <b>strength</b> are de-pendent on varying amounts of fibrinogen present as well as on other factors.

40|$|Central to the {{pathogenesis}} of ischaemic stroke are the normally protective processes of platelet adhesion and activation. Experimental evidence {{has shown that the}} ligand-receptor interactions in ischaemic stroke represent a thrombo-inflammatory cascade, which presents research opportunities into new treatment. However, as anti-platelet drugs have the potential to cause severe side effects in ischaemic stroke patients (as well as other vascular disease patients), it is important to carefully monitor the risk of bleeding and risk of thrombus in patients receiving treatment. Because thrombo-embolic ischaemic stroke is a major health issue, we suggest that the answer to adequate treatment is based on an individualized patient-centered approach, inline with the latest NIH precision medicine approach. A combination of viscoelastic methodologies may be used in a personalized patient-centered regime, including thromboelastography (TEG®) and the lesser used scanning electron microscopy approach (SEM). Thromboelastography provides a dynamic measure of <b>clot</b> formation, <b>strength,</b> and lysis, whereas SEM is a visual structural tool to study patient fibrin structure in great detail. Therefore, we consider the evidence for TEG® and SEM as unique means to confirm stroke diagnosis, screen at-risk patients, and monitor treatment efficacy. Here we argue that the current approach to stroke treatment needs to be restructured and new innovative thought patterns need to be applied, as even approved therapies require close patient monitoring to determine efficacy, match treatment regimens to each patient's individual needs, and assess the risk of dangerous adverse effects. TEG® and SEM have {{the potential to be a}} useful tool and could potentially alter the clinical approach to managing ischaemic stroke. As envisaged in the NIH precision medicine approach, this will involve a number of role players and innovative new research ideas, with benefits that will ultimately only be realized in a few years. Therefore, with this ultimate goal in mind, we suggest that an individualized patient-orientated approach is now available and therefore already within our ability to use.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Recombinant {{activated}} factor VII (rFVIIa) {{is increasingly}} {{being given to}} treat massive bleeding. However, {{there is no clear}} guidance on which patients are suitable for treatment and how the effects of treatment should be monitored. The aim of this in vitro study was to assess the coagulation status of severely hemodiluted blood samples before and after treatment with therapeutic doses of rFVIIa and/or fibrinogen with 2 viscoelastic point-of-care coagulation analyzers: ROTEM (Pentapharm GmbH, Munich, Germany) and Sonoclot (Sienco Inc, Arvada, CO). DESIGN: Laboratory study. SETTING: Research coagulation laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: Ten healthy male volunteers without hereditary or acquired coagulation disorders. INTERVENTIONS: Blood samples were obtained. After severe hemodilution with albumin 5 %, therapeutic doses of rFVIIa and/or fibrinogen were added, and the coagulation status was assessed with new 1 : 1, 000 diluted tissue factor-activated tests from ROTEM and Sonoclot. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The administration of therapeutic doses of rFVIIa to hemodiluted samples shortened the initiation phase of coagulation only. Isolated fibrinogen administration to physiologic levels improved both the initiation of coagulation as well as <b>clot</b> formation and <b>strength.</b> Combined fibrinogen and rFVIIa administration further improved both effects. CONCLUSIONS: ROTEM and Sonoclot were able to monitor the effects of rFVIIa and fibrinogen administration with 1 : 1, 000 diluted tissue factor-activated tests. The efficacy of rFVIIa was largely dependent on the presence of high levels of fibrinogen in reversing this severe dilutional coagulopathy...|$|R
40|$|Background. Emerging {{evidence}} has linked {{the presence of}} non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) with an increased risk for cardiovascular events. We hypothesised that altered clot kinetics and platelet function may contribute to this increased risk. This study compared whole blood clotting kinetics in patients with 1) non-cirrhotic NAFLD (n = 28) and 2) healthy control subjects (n = 22). Methods. Clotting kinetics were assessed in whole Wood using thromboelastography (TEG) and assessed for correlations with cardiovascular risk factors. Results. Clot kinetics in patients with NAFLD showed significantly stronger clot development (maximum amplitude (MA); 58. 3 6. 3 mm vs. 52. 0 10. 1 mm, p = 0. 01) and reduced clot lysis {{in the presence of}} thrombin (35 30 % vs. 51 26 % clot lysis 30 minutes after MA, p = 0. 03) compared to control subjects. <b>Clot</b> <b>strength</b> was independently positively associated with body mass index in NAFLD, but not in control subjects. There was a greater platelet contribution to <b>clot</b> <b>strength</b> in patients with NAFLD compared to controls despite similar platelet counts. There was no association between clot kinetics and features of the metabolic syndrome or presence of type 2 diabetes. Conclusion. Patients with NAFLD have disturbances in ex-vivo clot kinetics including increased <b>clot</b> <b>strength</b> and clots that are more resistant to thrombin-stimulated lysi...|$|E
40|$|Peripheral {{artery disease}} (PAD) is {{associated}} with exercise impairment and greater thrombotic risk. We investigated whether clot formation and platelet aggregation assessed by thromboelastography and light-transmission aggregometry correlate with the severity of symptomatic PAD assessed by ambulatory function measures. We studied 40 symptomatic patients with PAD in whom severity of disease was assessed using ankle–brachial index, peak walking time (PWT), claudication onset time, peak oxygen uptake, daily ambulatory activity, and walking impairment questionnaire (WIQ) scores. <b>Clot</b> <b>strength</b> correlated negatively with peak oxygen uptake, PWT, WIQ distance, and stair-climbing scores. Time to clot formation did not correlate with exercise para-meters. Platelet aggregation was negatively correlated withWIQ distance score and {{was positively correlated with}} PWT and peak oxygen uptake. In conclusion, <b>clot</b> <b>strength</b> and platelet aggregation correlated with objective and self-perceived ambulatory mea-sures. Patients with PAD having more severe walking impairment may be likely to form stronger clots...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: We {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} progressive haemodilution on the dynamics of fibrin clot formation and clot microstructure using a novel rheological method. The technique measures clotting time (T_GP), <b>clot</b> <b>strength</b> (G'_GP), and quantifies clot microstructure (d_f) at the incipient stages of fibrin formation. We use computational modelling {{to examine the relationship}} between structure and mass, as well as helium ion microscopy (HIM) to compare morphological changes in the fully formed clot to that of the incipient clot. Methods: This is an in vitro study; 90 healthy volunteers were recruited with informed consent and a 20 ml sample of whole blood obtained from each volunteer. Five clinically relevant dilutions were investigated using 0. 9 w. v isotonic saline (0, 10, 20, 40 and 60 %, n = 18 for each dilution). The rheological method of assessing structural clot changes was compared against conventional coagulation screen and fibrinogen estimation. Results: Fractal dimension (df) and final clot microstructure both decreased with progressive dilution (significant at a dilution of 20 %) with similar relationships observed for final clot characteristics in HIM images. Significant correlations were observed between d_f and G'_GP (<b>clot</b> <b>strength)</b> (0. 345, p = 0. 02), as well as clotting time (PT: - 0. 690, p > 0. 001; APTT: - 0. 672, p > 0. 001; T_GP: - 0. 385, p = 0. 006). Conclusions: This study provides new insight into the effects of haemodilution by isotonic saline on clotting time (T_GP), <b>clot</b> <b>strength</b> (G'_GP) and clot microstructure (d_f). Previous studies have attempted to link clot microstructure to clot quality/strength, however this study provides a significant step in quantifying these relationships...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown effects of {{thrombin}} and fibrinogen γ' on clot structure. However, structural information was obtained using electron microscopy, which requires sample dehydration. Our aim {{was to investigate the}} role of thrombin and fibrinogen γ' in modulating fibrin structure under fully hydrated conditions. Fibrin fibers were studied using turbidimetry, atomic force microscopy, electron microscopy, and magnetic tweezers in purified and plasma solutions. Increased thrombin induced a pronounced decrease in average protofibril content per fiber, with a relatively minor decrease in fiber size, leading to the formation of less compact fiber structures. Atomic force microscopy under fully hydrated conditions confirmed that fiber diameter was only marginally decreased. Decreased protofibril content of the fibers produced by high thrombin resulted in weakened clot architecture as analyzed by magnetic tweezers in purified systems and by thromboelastometry in plasma and whole blood. Fibers produced with fibrinogen γ' showed reduced protofibril packing over a range of thrombin concentrations. High-magnification electron microscopy demonstrated reduced protofibril packing in γ' fibers and unraveling of fibers into separate protofibrils. Decreased protofibril packing was confirmed in plasma for high thrombin concentrations and fibrinogendeficient plasma reconstituted with γ' fibrinogen. These findings demonstrate that, in fully hydrated conditions, thrombin and fibrinogen γ' have dramatic effects on protofibril content and that protein density within fibers correlates with strength of the fibrin network. We conclude that regulation of protofibril content of fibers is an important mechanism by which thrombin and fibrinogen γ' modulate fibrin <b>clot</b> structure and <b>strength...</b>|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Despite recent advancements {{in the use}} of thrombelastography (TEG) in the {{surgical}} setting, adequate technology to accurately predict bleeding phenotypes for patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass on the basis of non-mechanical parameters is lacking. While basic science and translational studies have provided key mechanistic insights about the protein components of coagulation cascades and regulatory mediators of hemostasis and fibrinolysis, targeted protein assays are still missing and the association of protein profiles to bleeding phenotypes and TEG readouts have yet to be discovered. Objective: To identify protein biomarkers of bleeding phenotypes of cardiopulmonary bypass patients in pre-operative plasma. Experimental design: We applied a targeted proteomics approach to quantify 123 plasma proteins from 23 patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and sternotomy. We then correlated these measurements to bleeding outcomes and TEG parameters, associated with speed of <b>clot</b> formation and <b>strength.</b> Results: In this pilot study, we demonstrate the feasibility of protein quantitation as a viable strategy to predict low versus high bleeding phenotypes (loss of than 20 % of estimated blood volume, calculated as 70 mL/kg for BMI 40. Statistical elaborations highlighted a core set of proteins showing significant correlations to either total blood loss or TEG R/MA parameters.

40|$|Background: Patients with cyanotic {{congenital}} heart disease(CCHD) have haemostatic abnormalities, which {{result in}} {{an increased risk of}} bleeding. The cause is unknown, but recent studies have indicated that an elevated haematocrit, which is present in cyanotic patients, could be an important factor. The aim {{of this study was to}} characterize the haemostatic profile, examine how changes in haematocrit affect the haemostatic profile, and whether a haematocrit reduction could terminate bleeding in CCHD patients. Methods: This was a prospective, multicenter study. The haemostatic profile consisting of haematocrit, platelet count and thrombelastography(TEG) was characterized in ninety-eight CCHD patients. To evaluate the influence of haematocrit on the haemostatic profile, 21 of the patients underwent phlebotomy and 16 patients received treatment with an iron supplement. Furthermore ten patients with haemoptysis underwent phlebotomy. The haemostatic profile was reevaluated after interventions. Results: TEG revealed that patients with CCHD and elevated haematocrit were hypocoagulable due to reduced <b>clot</b> formation and <b>strength.</b> Furthermore a positive correlation between elevated haematocrit and hypocoagulability was present. Interventions such as phlebotomy and treatment with supplemental iron causing significant haematocrit changes confirmed the correlation between haematocrit and the haemostatic profile. Finally a haematocrit reduction by phlebotomy successfully terminated haemoptysis in ten CCHD patients. Conclusion: Patients with CCHD and elevated haematocrit are hypocoagulable. The hypocoagulable haemostatic profile is positively correlated to increasing haematocrit. An intervention, which increases or decreases haematocrit, changes the haemostatic profile. A haematocrit reduction seems to improve the haemostatic profile, and may thereby terminate bleeding. However, these results warrant further studies. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
