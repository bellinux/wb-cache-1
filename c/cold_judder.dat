40|$|Judder {{may fall}} under the {{headings}} of <b>cold</b> or hot <b>judder</b> but {{by far the most}} complex to understand is hot judder. This may result from rotor deformation or an effect referred to as "hot spotting". It is clear that to minimise the occurrence of thermal judder it is necessary to avoid excessive heating of the rotor {{and at the same time}} avoid significant variation in temperature across the rotor. To this end the designer must ensure uniform heat dissipation from the rotor. In high performance braking applications vented discs are normally used as these provide a greater cooling surface. These discs increase cooling efficiency by employing braking surfaces (blades) separated by a number of "ribs" or "vanes" which allow air to pass between the two blades. To increase cooling efficiency some vented discs use pins to separate the braking surfaces as this arrangement increases the available area to dissipate the heat. The cooling efficiency of the brake discs depends on two parameters; the mass flow rate of air through the disc and the effective heat transfer coefficient on the surface of the disc blades and vent vanes/pins. "Pin" type vented discs have been found to be good at increasing heat transfer coefficient but mass flow rates through such discs are generally smaller when compared to vane type discs. This paper attempts to define a plausible way of controlling the shape of the columns within a pin vented disc with a view to finding an optimised configuration for a disc consisting of three rows of 36 "pins" positioned so that their centre lines are separated by ten degrees, with the central row of pins offset by five degrees to the outer and inner rows. The optimisation of this "pin" arrangement attempts to increase the average heat transfer coefficient and the wetted area in order to enhance the aero-thermal characteristics of the disc to increase heat dissipation from the rotor in a uniform manner and hence decrease the discs tendency to judder. The results presented within clearly show the advantages of increasing the pumping efficiency of the brake rotor; this is demonstrated by the "high mass flow rate" design. It has also been shown that increasing the width of the second an third rows of pins produces a decrease in the flow rate through the disc whereas the first row has an optimal width that creates a venturi at the inlet which aids inlet velocities. A reasonable correlation has been demonstrated between the results from the computational fluid dynamic analysis and those gained from empirical formulas as well as previous computational studies...|$|R

40|$|Brake judder is a {{phenomenon}} of noise which its vibration can be felt physically by the driver of a vehicle. If this vibration is exposed to the driver {{for a long period}} it can lead to tiredness during driving. There are two types of judder which is <b>cold</b> <b>judder</b> and hot judder. This paper will be focusing on the hot judder. As a disc surface heats up during braking it causes both sides of the disc distort and hence produce a sinusoidal waviness around its edges. In this paper finite element analysis of hot judder is performed using a commercial software package, ABAQUS. An existing brake disc design is simulated and will be used as a baseline model. Various structural modifications made on the disc are proposed in an attempt to reduce brake judder in a disc brake assembly...|$|E
40|$|Brake judder is a braking induced, forced {{vibration}} that typically occurs in vehicles. The judder frequency is {{directly proportional to}} the revolution speed of the wheel and therefore also to the velocity of the vehicle. The driver experiences judder as vibrations in the steering wheel, brake pedal and structure floor. Brake judder can be split into two distinct groups – “hot” and “cold” judder, both {{of which can be}} classified as a mechanically induced vibration. Until recently research efforts regarding brake judder have been overshadowed by other brake related issues such as brake noise for example squeal and groan. This research studies the <b>cold</b> <b>judder</b> by using brake judder test rig (half vehicle). After applying three different pressures (5 bar, 10 bar, 16 bar) for each speed (420 rpm, 330 rpm, 250 rpm and 165 rpm), the results show that at 10 bar and 16 bar give a high vibration amplitude that leads to uncomfortable feeling. The result of non-contact displacement sensors show that the disc thickness variation (DTV), disc surface waviness and side run-out (SRO) combination is the cause of brake judder. After inserting a 3 mm thick round rubber between the pad and the caliper the magnitude of vibration atthe axial steering direction for velocity of 250 rpm and 420 rpm, and brake pressure of 16 bar changed from fairly uncomfortable region to little uncomfortable region and the magnitude of vibration of brake pedal changed from uncomfortable region to fairly uncomfortable region...|$|E
40|$|Until {{recently}} {{research efforts}} regarding brake judder has been overshadowed by other brake related {{issues such as}} brake noise for example squeal and groan. Although brake noise still remains a problem for vehicle manufacturers, past research effort {{has led to a}} greater understanding of its mechanism and solutions are now more readily available. This is not the case with brake "judder" as past research has been less focussed towards its occurrence or cause. As brake performance and reduced packaging demands increase then the thermal issues of braking become more of an issue. It is this aspect of thermal judder, rather than <b>cold</b> <b>judder,</b> which is most difficult to investigate as this can manifest itself as high frequency (often referred to as drone) or low frequency excitation, the latter causing excessive vibration in the suspension and steering systems. The focus of this research is the analysis of thermo-elastic instability after both high energy braking and prolonged drag braking. Both types of braking result in high energy input into the brake rotor. The principal issue is that the rise in temperature, under some conditions, is localised with temperatures exceeding 730 ºC. If this is followed by rapid cooling, then a phase change in the brake rotor material results. This phase change in the metallurgical structure of the rotor may be seen {{on the surface of the}} rotor as dark areas which are referred to as "hot spots" or `blue spots´. The resulting increase in grain growth associated with these localised areas causes a further increase in temperature and so the process continues. The disc surface becomes a series of raised areas giving localised disc thickness variation. It is during a subsequent light braking application that judder occurs due to the DTV with a high order of vibration - or "drone". The paper is aimed at detailing the preliminary vehicle testing which has been performed which will allow for accurate validation of dynamometer testing and computational analysis. Promising results have been obtained and are presented and discussed. Conclusions have been drawn with recommendations for further work...|$|E
40|$|As {{one of the}} brake-induced {{noises and}} vibrations, hot judder is forced vibration, which is caused by {{unevenness}} of the brake disc due to the thermal mechanical interactions in wheel brakes. Brake disc unevenness is normally described and evaluated as the Disc Thickness Variation (DTV) and the disc’ Lateral Run-Out (LRO). DTV and LRO gener-ate Brake Pressure Variation (BPV) and Brake Torque Variation (BTV) in wheel brakes, which are transmitted to the driver and perceived by the driver as the brake pedal pulsa-tion, the steering wheel oscillation, the car body vibrations, and low-frequency drone noises inside a vehicle. Hot judder is characterized by hot spots on the disc surfaces. The frequency of hot judder {{is dependent on the}} wheel rotational speed, showing order behaviors. The num-ber of hot spots generally corresponds to the dominant order of hot judder. In the last decades, most of the hot judder tests have been carried out with brake dynamometers, and high numbers (typically around 10) of hot spots were found in the majority of the tests. The generation and development mechanisms of the high dominant order have been almost the exclusive focus of current hot judder researches. However, the influ-ences of the vibrations and noises (with higher frequencies compared with the low-order <b>cold</b> <b>judder)</b> caused by high-order hot judder on the driver’s subjective perception have been still not clarified. That is to say, it is still unknown in which form and under which conditions, the high-order hot judder can be transmitted to and perceived by the driver, and thus causing customer complaints. A top-down approach is used in order to investigate the influences of high-order judder on driver’s perception with respect to two aspects: the incidence of high-order hot jud-der in vehicle tests and the drivers’ perception of high-order hot judder. The first aspect is mainly investigated by studying the transferability of dynamometer tests to vehicle tests and by identifying the incidence of high-order hot judder in production brakes. Specifically, identical brakes from one front brake and one rear brake are separately tested with a brake dynamometer and through vehicle tests by means of road tests and chassis dynamometer tests, and all brakes of four production passengers are identified with accelerometers attached on the brake caliper and the caliper bracket. The perception of high-order hot judder is chiefly studied by investigating its transfer behaviors. Global transfer functions from BPV/BTV to the selected driver interface quantities (brake pedal pulsation, steering wheel oscillation, seat track vibrations, and vehicle interior drone noise) are defined, which establish the links between the hot judder intensity in the wheel brake and the intensity at the driver interface. In order to identify the transfer functions with a high signal-noise-ratio and better reproducibility, a novel testing method is adopted: vehicle tests with brake discs that are artificially modi-fied with the desired surface shapes simulating the high-order DTV/LRO. Altogether three vehicles with seven different modified discs are tested. Two critical levels of drone noise (60 and 80 dB(A)) are selected according to the general vehicle total noise level and the human’s perception characteristics of sound. The perception threshold values of the driver interface vibrations are obtained through regression analysis between their subjective ratings and objective measurements. Based on the critical drone noise levels and the threshold values of vibrations, as well as the global transfer functions, threshold values of BPV and BTV for perceiving the high-order judder are computed. Concerning the incidence of high-order judder, both the dominant order and the thermal increases of BTV and BPV for the dominant order showed great discrepancies in differ-ent test types (e. g. brake dynamometer or vehicle, drag braking application with con-stant velocity and constant pressure/torque or stop braking application with decreasing velocity and constant deceleration/pressure). Hot judder behaviors in the brake dyna-mometer test were not transferable to the vehicle tests. Besides, no evident high-order hot judder has been identified in all the brakes of the four passenger cars. Generally, hot judder seems to be more likely to be excited at the brake dynamometer than in the vehi-cles. Therefore, brake dynamometer test is still appropriate for detecting hot judder in the early phase of brake development, and thus preventing its occurrence in the vehicle. Regarding the driver’s perception, the drone noise is the most probable reason leading to customer complaints, since higher than 100 Hz less than 10 Nm BTV is required to perceive the drone noise and 50 Nm BTV can already result in unacceptable drone noise. The driver is less sensitive to the vibrations caused by high-order judder. Roughly at least 20 Nm BTV or 2. 5 bar BPV is needed for perceiving the vibrations, and the perception is most possibly due to the steering wheel oscillation or the vertical vehicle vibration. Moreover, some resonances in the transfer paths {{play a significant role in}} the high-order judder transmission. Although the investigations in this work are limited to three vehicles, the practical significance of high-order hot judder on the driver’s percep-tion is revealed for the first time. With these results, the impact of the measured BTV and BPV of hot judder, e. g. in the brake dynamometer tests, can be assessed. Combining these results, the most effective and efficient way to mitigate the high-order hot judder would be reducing its occurrences in the wheel brakes and diminishing the prominent resonances in the transfer paths...|$|E
