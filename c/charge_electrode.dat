40|$|The {{influence}} of the diffuse double layer on the passage of Faradaic current is investigated for steady-state voltammetry. Both mathematical analysis and numerical solution with the Nernst-Planck-Poisson equations are employed. We report a comprehensive study {{of the effects of}} reactant <b>charge,</b> <b>electrode</b> <b>charge,</b> <b>electrode</b> size and quantity of supporting electrolyte. Both infinite and finite electrode kinetics are investigated, as well as distance-dependent electron transfer (tunnelling) and activity effects. Certain combinations of reactant and electrode charge are shown to profoundly alter the predicted current by exclusion of the reactant (Levich effect) or deceleration of apparent kinetics (Frumkin effect), although tunnelling can overcome both effects by moving the plane of electron transfer. The structurally altered double layer at nanoelectrodes is shown to either increase or decrease the predicted current depending on the electrode charge, due to an unscreened electric field. © 2011 Elsevier B.

40|$|To {{report the}} audiological {{outcomes}} of cochlear implantation in two patients with severe to profound {{sensorineural hearing loss}} secondary to superficial siderosis of the CNS and discuss some programming peculiarities that were found in these cases. Retrospective review. Data concerning clinical presentation, diagnosis and audiological assessment pre- and post-implantation were collected of two patients with superficial siderosis of the CNS. Both patients showed good hearing thresholds but variable speech perception outcomes. One patient did not achieve open-set speech recognition, but the other achieved 70 % speech recognition in quiet. Electrical compound action potentials could not be elicited in either patient. Map parameters showed the need for increased <b>charge.</b> <b>Electrode</b> impedances showed high longitudinal variability. The implants were fairly beneficial in restoring hearing and improving communication abilities although many reprogramming sessions have been required. The hurdle in programming was the need of frequent adjustments due to the physiologic variations in electrical discharges and neural conduction, besides {{the changes in the}} impedances. Patients diagnosed with superficial siderosis may achieve limited results in speech perception scores due to both cochlear and retrocochlear reasons. Careful counseling about the results must be given to the patients and their families before the cochlear implantation indication...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} of using electrophoretic deposition (EPD) technique to deposit negatively charge fine iron oxide particles in tap water samples on a counter <b>charge</b> <b>electrode</b> (anode) was conducted. Characterizations of fine iron oxide particles in tap water {{from two different}} locations i. e. commercial and residential areas, were identified. After centrifuging the tap water samples, particle analyzer was used to analyze particles sizes and zeta potential values. The average particle sizes for supernatant region from the commercial and residential areas were 230 ± 22. 30 and 260 ± 3. 68 nm respectively. The zeta potential value from residential area was higher than commercial area, i. e. - 42. 27 ± 0. 12 and - 34. 83 ± 0. 23 mV, respectively. X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis indicated that the tap water samples consisted of iron oxide polymorphs, namely goethite (α-FeOOH), hematite (α-Fe₂O₃), magnetite (Fe₃O₄у), and maghemite (y- Fe₂O₃),). During the removal of fine iron oxide particles using EPD technique, direct current (DC) voltage was varied from 5 to 25 V at a constant electrode distance of 30 mm. Higher deposition of fine iron oxide particles was achieved using the carbon fibre electrode with a percentage removal of (96 % ± 1. 42) than using the carbon plate electrode (58 % ± 2. 17) at 5 V due to the greater surface area of the carbon fibre electrode. The percentage of fine iron oxide particle deposition decreased as the applied voltage increased from 5 to 25 V. High amount of bubbles were formed on electrodes during EPD technique due to electrolysis of water as the applied voltage increased. The percentage removal of Fe from tap water samples from both areas was higher than the removal of Fe from the synthesized iron oxide suspension due to high zeta potential values in the water samples after centrifugation (supernatant). EPD techniques also manage to remove other element (arsenic) in tap water samples which had adsorbed onto fine iron oxide particles with percentage removal 26 % ± 1. 05. EDX analysis confirmed that fine iron oxide particles were deposited on anode electrode. The results proved that EPD was effective to remove fine iron oxide particles and other element such as arsenic in tap water...|$|E

40|$|Butanol is a {{potential}} alternative to ethanol and offers many benefits including a much higher heating value and lower latent heat of vaporization. It also has a higher cetane number than ethanol and improved miscibility in diesel fuel. Additionally, butanol is less corrosive and less prone to water absorption than ethanol, which allows it to be transported using the existing fuel supply pipelines. However, while some previous research on the emissions of butanol-gasoline blends is available, little research exists on the emissions of neat butanol. This thesis focuses on two areas of study. The first area relates to on the comparison of UHC, NOx, and CO emissions of several butanol-gasoline and ethanol-gasoline blended fuels during combustion in an SI engine. The objective was to compare the emissions of butanol combustion to the ones of ethanol and gasoline. The {{second part of the}} study relates to the use of electrostatically assisted injection as a means of reducing the UHC emissions of butanol by decreasing the fuel droplet size using a <b>charge</b> <b>electrode</b> and extraction ring designed for a port fuel injector. Emissions measurements taken with and without a charge applied to the injector were used to determine the effect of applying a voltage to the fuel spray on engine emissions. It was established that the UHC emissions of neat butanol were approximately double the UHC emissions of gasoline and were appreciably higher than ethanol. CO emissions decreased and NOx emissions increased as the amount of butanol in gasoline was increased. Additionally, the CO emissions of butanol were lower than ethanol while it was not clear whether butanol had increased or decreased NOx emissions. It was also established that addition of 25 % ethanol to butanol resulted in UHC emissions that were approximately 33 % higher than those of neat butanol despite ethanol producing approximately 33 % less UHC emissions than butanol. The results of the electrostatically assisted injection tests showed that, at certain engine operating conditions, application of 2000 V to the fuel spray resulted in a 10 % increase in peak cylinder pressure, 4 % reduction in UHC emissions, a 13. 5 % increase in NOx emissions, and a 13. 5 % reduction in CO emissions, which is consistent with the hypothesis that the voltage increased fuel atomization. However, tests at lower engine loads showed results contradictory to those at the higher engine load which suggested that the fuel droplet size may vary depending on engine operating conditions...|$|E

As the electrons flow toward the electrode, ionized shielding gas flows back toward the base material, cleaning the weld by removing oxides and other impurities and thereby improving its quality and appearance.|$|R
