40|$|Abstract: Based on the {{assumption}} of related parameters in <b>compressible</b> <b>packing</b> model, the <b>compressible</b> <b>packing</b> model {{was used for the}} calculation of the explosives packing efficiency. The accuracy of the calculation was verified by experiments and the relative error was 2. 49 %. Besides, the influence of content offine particles and particle size distribution in explosives on stacking efficiency was discussed. The results show that the stacking efficiency was increasing with the particle size distribution increasing from 0 ~ 300 µm to 0 ~ 700 µm. The packing efficiency reached it’s maximum value when we only increased the content of fine particles to 40 %. Therefore, the packing efficiency has a relation with particle size distribution of raw materials. 1...|$|R

In this study, the n-pentane/dry-biomass {{partition coefficient}} (KDP/B) was determined in microcosms for the filamentous fungus Fusarium solani, it was grown in four <b>packing</b> <b>materials</b> (compost, peat, perlite and vermiculite) at different temperatures (15 °C, 25 °C and 35 °C). The results show that the n-pentane/wet-biomass partition coefficients (KWP/B) for all experiments in organic <b>packing</b> <b>material</b> were on average 160 -fold lower (0. 21 ± 0. 09) than those in water (33. 2 ± 9. 4), while for inorganic <b>packing</b> <b>material</b> on average 700 -fold lower (0. 05 ± 0. 04). On the other hand, it was observed that the KWP/B for the fungus grown in an inorganic <b>packing</b> <b>material</b> was on average 4 -fold lower than when grown in organic <b>packing</b> <b>material.</b> In conclusion, the use of inorganic <b>packing</b> <b>material</b> increases the solubility (lower KWP/B) of n-pentane, increasing the elimination capacity in fungal biofilter...|$|R
40|$|An {{extraction}} device is disclosed comprising a tube containing a substantially inert, chemically non-reactive <b>packing</b> <b>material</b> {{with a large}} surface area to volume ratio. A sample which consists of organic compounds dissolved in a liquid, is introduced into the tube. As the sample passes through the <b>packing</b> <b>material</b> it spreads over the material's large surface area to form a thin liquid film which is held on the <b>packing</b> <b>material</b> in a stationary state. A particular group or family of compounds is extractable from the sample by passing a particular solvent system consisting of a solvent and selected reagents through the <b>packing</b> <b>material.</b> The reagents cause optimum conditions to exist for the compounds of the particular family {{to pass through the}} phase boundary between the sample liquid and the solvent of the solvent system. Thus, the compounds of the particular family are separated from the sample liquid and become dissolved in the solvent of the solvent system. The particular family of compounds dissolved in the solvent, representing an extract, exits the tube together with the solvent through the tube's nozzle, {{while the rest of the}} sample remains on the <b>packing</b> <b>material</b> in a stationary state.

In an initial evaluation, after a reactor startup phase of 40 days, the average TOC removal for six replicate reactors packed with Tri-packs <b>packing</b> <b>material</b> was 65 %. A {{second set of}} experiments was designed to assess TOC removal using several types of <b>packing</b> <b>material</b> (B-cell and Biobale).

Therefore, a partial characterization of reactor effluent was conducted to determine if the plateau in TOC removal was a result of mass transfer limitations from inefficient lateral dispersion of water through the <b>packing</b> <b>material.</b> The results indicate that degradation by-products may not be readily biodegradable in this system.
