Left unchecked, urchins devastate their environments, creating what biologists call an urchin barren, devoid of macroalgae and associated fauna.

The 1992 moratorium was initially meant to last two years, with the hopes that the Northern Cod population would recover, and along with it, the fishery. Unfortunately, {{the damage done to}} Newfoundland's <b>coastal</b> <b>ecosystem</b> was indelible, and even after sixteen years, the Northern Cod population has failed to rebound and the cod fishery remains closed.|$|E
25|$|A {{salt marsh}} or saltmarsh, {{also known as}} a coastal salt marsh or a tidal marsh, is a <b>coastal</b> <b>ecosystem</b> in the upper coastal {{intertidal}} zone between land and open saltwater or brackish water that is regularly flooded by the tides. It is dominated by dense stands of salt-tolerant plants such as herbs, grasses, or low shrubs. These plants are terrestrial in origin and are essential to the stability of the salt marsh in trapping and binding sediments. Salt marshes play a large role in the aquatic food web and the delivery of nutrients to coastal waters. They also support terrestrial animals and provide coastal protection.|$|E
40|$|Amongst {{the various}} {{functions}} of European <b>coastal</b> <b>ecosystems</b> the information functions {{are by far}} the most important. Information is provided mainly through the various aspects of biodiversity: taxon diversity, genetic diversity, community (P) diversity, phylogentic distinctiveness, rarity and endemism. <b>Coastal</b> <b>ecosystems</b> are relatively rich in coastal ecotypes of species with a broader amplitude and in endemic species. Phylogenetically distinctive taxa occur in saline waters, and some on beaches and in foredunes. These particular features of <b>coastal</b> <b>ecosystems</b> are related to the long geological history of European, especially eastern Mediterranean, coasts. Information functions are threatened through the use of European <b>coastal</b> <b>ecosystems</b> for other purposes, notably urbanization and recreational development...|$|R
40|$|This essay {{shows that}} there is a timely {{convergence}} of ideas and demand for empirical evidence for understanding the relationship between migration and <b>coastal</b> <b>ecosystems.</b> It explores a limited set of theoretical pathways from which hypotheses might be derived about the positive and negative impacts of migration upon the environment. These pathways are derived from a discussion about property relations in <b>coastal</b> <b>ecosystems</b> and current theory about migration processes. Social capital emerges as a key concept in both literatures enabling a productive, theoretical synthesis. In conclusion, some examples from recent research about <b>coastal</b> <b>ecosystems</b> are used to generate a future research agenda that systematically addresses measurement, methods, and modeling approaches for refining our understanding of the possible impact of migration upon <b>coastal</b> <b>ecosystems.</b> ...|$|R

Climate change will only add to this complexity, underscoring the necessity of finding new ways to govern for these ecosystems’ sustainable use. After reviewing the problems facing <b>coastal</b> <b>ecosystems</b> and innovations in their governance, this article argues that governance of <b>coastal</b> <b>ecosystems</b> must move to place-based adaptive management regimes that incorporate innovative and flexible regulatory mechanisms, such as market-based incentives. coastal ecosystems; sustainability; governance; adaptive management; place-based management; ecosystem-based management; market-based regulation; ecosystem services...|$|R

40|$|Extract] Estuaries and <b>coastal</b> <b>ecosystems</b> are {{transitional}} between terrestrial {{and ocean}} environments, {{and this is}} the reason why they are highly dynamic ecosystems. Being situated at the lower point of the river basins, estuaries and <b>coastal</b> <b>ecosystems</b> are highly dependent on all the factors, processes, and uses directly or indirectly related with water over the entire river basin. Finding sustainable solutions to reverse the degradation and restore estuarine and <b>coastal</b> <b>ecosystems</b> requires a profound knowledge about the processes occurring at different spatial and temporal levels, and understanding of the need for a transdisciplinary approach to water issues in estuarine and coastal environments...|$|R
