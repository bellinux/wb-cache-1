A centralised electronic health record repository of all citizens which is the ultimate goal of the authority will ensure that the health history and status of all patients would always be available to all health institutions.

50|$|A urine sensor is a {{necessary}} part of any bedwetting alarm. A basic urine sensor consists of two electricity conductors separated by moisture absorbing insulating material. A low DC electric voltage, provided by batteries, is applied across these conductors. This low voltage is usually about 3 volts, {{so as not to be}} dangerous to the user. When this insulating material (frequently cotton cloth as in common briefs) absorbs urine, it allows electricity to pass through it and between the conductors, resulting in a small electric current in the conductors. The conductors are attached to an alarm device, which triggers an alarm when it senses this current. Most sensors and alarms are engineered based on this <b>concept.</b> <b>Note</b> that unless the urine reaches the sensor mechanism and adequately wets the briefs (or insulator between the conductors), the urine may not be sensed and the alarm will not activate. Sensors are usually classified in terms of their attachment mechanisms to the briefs or other urine absorbing medium. The major sensor attachment categories are mechanical clips, sticky tape or pads for flat surface sensors, magnetic attachment, and wiring sewed into special briefs.|$|E

5000|$|Such uses of {{the term}} have been criticized, {{primarily}} due to its assumption that if illegal (pirated) copies were not available, the consumers of such a pirated copy would instead purchase the product at an average market rate. Critics of the [...] "lost sales" [...] <b>concept</b> <b>note</b> that some consumers, for example those in developing countries, or those with lower income such as students, {{may not be able}} to afford the market price of certain products and if there were no pirated copies available, it is likely they would simply not purchase the ones available at the market price. Others may treat pirated goods as samples that entice them to buy the product later on. It has been suggested that the better term would be [...] "retail value of pirated goods", and that equating such a concept with financial loss is fallacious. Treating each pirated copy as a lost sale, and using an estimate for the number of pirated copies in existence, multiplied by their retail value, as tangible loss of profits by the industry has been called disparagingly [...] "copyright math" [...] (a term coined by writer Robert Reid) that leads to overestimation of the content industry losses. In academic literature there is no consensus that the concept of piracy is clearly correlated with reduction of revenue of sales of the pirated product, and estimates of lost sales have been similarly criticized, with a 2010 U.S. government report noting that many commonly cited figures cannot be substantiated. Similarly, estimates of lost sales translated to concepts such as lost jobs or reduction in individual or national incomes have been shown to be highly problematic.|$|E

The importance of collaboration is closely linked to the ability of organizations to collectively learn from each other, a <b>concept</b> <b>noted</b> in the literature on learning organizations.|$|R
