Following a conference in Moscow in October 1981, Hawking and Gary Gibbons organised a three-week Nuffield Workshop {{in the summer of}} 1982 on [...] "The Very Early Universe" [...] at Cambridge University, which focused mainly on inflation theory. Hawking also began a new line of quantum theory research into the origin of the universe. In 1981 at a Vatican conference, he presented work suggesting that there might be no boundaryor beginning or endingto the universe. He subsequently developed the research in collaboration with Jim Hartle, and in 1983 they published a model, known as the Hartle–Hawking state. It proposed that prior to the Planck epoch, the universe had no boundary in space-time; before the Big Bang, time did not exist and the concept of the beginning of the universe is meaningless. The initial singularity of the classical Big Bang models was replaced with a region akin to the North Pole. One cannot travel north of the North Pole, but there is no boundary thereit is simply the point where all north-running lines meet and end. Initially, the no-boundary proposal predicted a <b>closed</b> <b>universe,</b> which had implications about the existence of God. As Hawking explained, [...] "If the universe has no boundaries but is self-contained... then God would not have had any freedom to choose how the universe began." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{most radical}} {{version of the}} {{holographic}} principle asserts that all information about physical processes {{in the world can}} be stored on its surface. This formulation is at odds with inflationary cosmology, which implies that physical processes in our part of the universe do not depend on the boundary conditions. Also, there are some indications that the radical version of the holographic theory in the context of cosmology may have problems with unitarity and causality. Another formulation of the holographic principle, due to Fischler and Susskind, implies that the entropy of matter inside the post-inflationary particle horizon must be smaller than the area of the horizon. Their conjecture was very successful for a wide class of open and flat universes, but it did not apply to <b>closed</b> <b>universes.</b> Bak and Rey proposed a different holographic bound on entropy which was valid for <b>closed</b> <b>universes</b> of a certain type. However, as we will show, neither proposal applies to open, flat and <b>closed</b> <b>universes</b> with matter and a small negative cosmological constant. We will argue, in agreement with Easther, Lowe, and Veneziano, that whenever the holographic constraint on the entropy inside the horizon is valid, it follows from the Bekenstein-Hawking bound on the black hole entropy. These constraints do not allow one to rule out <b>closed</b> <b>universes</b> and other universes which may experience gravitational collapse, and do not impose any constraints on inflationary cosmology.

To this end, we suggested the decomposition of the EGB equations {{in such a way that}} the first chiral field is responsible for the Einstein part of the model, while the second field, together with kinetic interaction term, is connected with the Gauss [...] Bonnet part of the theory. We proved that both fields are phantom ones under this decomposition, and that the model has a solution if the kinetic interaction between the fields equals a constant. We have presented the exact solution in terms of cosmic time. This was done for a spatially flat universe. In the case of open and <b>closed</b> <b>universes</b> we introduced the third chiral field (canonical for closed and phantom for open universe) which is responsible for the EGB and curvature parts.
