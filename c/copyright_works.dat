They cite Rufus Pollock's study on optimal copyright term length. He found that <b>copyright</b> <b>works</b> best only when the amount of time protected is fourteen years. The EFF also makes the argument that all the side effects of the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act are negative for all parties except media companies. Therefore, it only helps the big media companies.|$|E

50|$|In {{determining}} whether art. 35-3(1) above applies to a use of <b>copyrighted</b> <b>work,</b> the following factors must be considered: {{the purpose and}} character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is of a non profit nature; the type or purpose of the copyrighted work; the amount and importance of the portion used {{in relation to the}} <b>copyrighted</b> <b>work</b> as a whole; the effect of the use of the <b>copyrighted</b> <b>work</b> upon the current market or the current value of the <b>copyrighted</b> <b>work</b> or on the potential market or the potential value of the <b>copyrighted</b> <b>work.</b>|$|R

This thesis is divided into five chapters and other subchapters designed to cover the above mentioned extent. The first chapter is an introductory one as it provides the fundamental information on copyright law, its' term, principles and a catalogue of various sources of law, too. Chapter number two, puts stress on <b>copyrighted</b> <b>work.</b> Specifically, the definition of <b>copyrighted</b> <b>work</b> and content of author's rights are analyzed there. The third chapter is dedicated to right to use a <b>copyrighted</b> <b>work</b> and it includes a list of ways to use a <b>copyrighted</b> <b>work</b> and concerns users plus the role of internet service providers. The penultimate chapter deals with the lawful use of a <b>copyrighted</b> <b>work.</b> License agreement, author's fee, fair use and other exceptions and limitations of author's exclusive rights are mentioned there. In contrast to the fourth chapter, the final chapter refers to the {{unlawful use}} of a <b>copyrighted</b> <b>work.</b> It defines author's entitlement within civil law and also the public law sanctions. The whole work keeps an eye on new civil code changes by [...] ...|$|R

Members of the {{opposition}} such as Patrick Bloche {{have argued that the}} Berne three-step test may be imposed onto states, so that their legislation conforms to the test, but not onto individual citizens.

2500|$|In summary, {{the issues}} are as follows. Navitaire contend that {{copyright}} subsists in the command set as a copyright work distinct from the source code. This claim {{has a number of}} aspects: (i) the collection of commands as a whole is entitled to copyright as a 'compilation'; (ii) each of the commands is a copyright work in its own right; (iii) alternatively, each of the 'complex' commands is a work in its own right. As to the displays, Navitaire contend that (i) in respect of the VT100 screen displays, the 'template' (fixed data and layout of variable data) is a separate copyright work for each display and (ii) certain GUI screens on the separate Schedule Maintenance module are <b>copyright</b> <b>works</b> as they stand and have been copied. Then it is said (and this is a quite distinct allegation) that the similarity exhibited by eRes to OpenRes {{in the eye of the}} user is such that there has been 'non-textual copying' of the whole of the source code. This is said to be strictly analogous to taking the plot of a book: an author who takes the plot of another work and copies nothing else will still infringe copyright if a substantial part of the earlier author's work is represented by that plot, and the same goes for computer programs: John Richardson Computers v Flanders [...] FSR 497 (Ferris J).|$|E
2500|$|Caine {{arrived in}} New York 25 September 1895, {{accompanied}} by his wife Mary and eldest son Ralph, where they were met by his New York publisher William Appleton, an active {{in the struggle for}} an international copyright. He carried with him a letter of introduction to the Government of Canada from Chamberlain. On the street he was mobbed by fans. The following month Caine reached Canada, where he met with leading members of the publishing trade. He had long discussions with the Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie Bowell and the Canadian Minister of Justice Charles Tupper in Ottawa. At the request of the Canadian Copyright Association Caine went to Toronto where he had talks with the Toronto publishers. [...] Caine resolved the dispute between the Canadian publishers, the Canadian Copyright Association and English authors. The proposed solution, that Canadian publishers would have the right to republish <b>copyright</b> <b>works</b> that had not been published in Canada within sixty days of publication elsewhere, was incorporated into the draft copyright bill. On 25 November 1895 Caine presented the draft bill at the Ottawa copyright conference where all parties agreed to it. The Canadian authorities and publishers were satisfied with the proposal put forward from England as were the American authors and publishers. The bill never became law, the 1889 Act was abandoned and a more flexible solution was found by 1900.|$|E
40|$|Digitisation of <b>Copyrighted</b> <b>Works</b> The thesis {{deals with}} the issue of {{digitisation}} of <b>copyrighted</b> <b>works.</b> The aim of this work is to provide a comprehensive account of the digitisation phenomenon in relation to <b>copyrighted</b> <b>works</b> {{from the point of view}} of the Czech Copyright Act and to analyse two digitisation projects to identify practical issues and, if possible, solutions to these. The text is divided into five chapters, each of them dedicated to a different aspect of the topic presented. The first of the two introductory chapters focuses on the legal institute of <b>copyrighted</b> <b>work</b> as defined by the Copyright Act of the Czech Republic. The five subchapters analyse the concept of <b>copyrighted</b> <b>work,</b> examine legal fiction expanding the set of protected objects and specify the respective protected objects within the category of <b>copyrighted</b> <b>works.</b> The two subchapters comprising the following chapter study the phenomenon of digitisation from the factual point of view. The first subchapter describes the concept of digitisation, focusing on technical aspects, while the second one makes distinction between the digitisation and born-digital materials. The third chapter provides ground for merging the legal aspects of <b>copyrighted</b> <b>works</b> and the factual aspects of digitisation into the key issue of digitisation of [...] ...|$|R

Currently the issue of unlawful use of <b>copyrighted</b> <b>work</b> as well as legal protection of that work is becoming much more interesting than approximately twenty / thirty years ago. This situation is caused by three main circumstances - the growth of piracy (<b>copyrighted</b> <b>works</b> like books, films, sound recordings, computer programmes and so on are widely used now, and in some states it is even very important business), the advent of satellite communication (increasingly entertainment and information services are more available) and the advent of the Internet (because of the worldwide linking of the millions of computers it is very easy to access to, copy and distribute <b>copyrighted</b> <b>works).</b> Thanks to that development the current society is going to resolve the question whether it is possible to maintain the established protection and the sources of renumeration for rightowners, or whether copyright will be engulfed in the ever-increasing electronic use of protected material. Having in mind this question the goal of this thesis is to map the system of possible legal means of protection against the unlawful use of <b>copyrighted</b> <b>works</b> in the Czech [...] ...|$|R
