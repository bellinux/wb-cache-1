6000|$|But this man, in {{one respect}} like the last, though {{seemingly}} hard at it with a great show of brown paper and rubbers, was only really fattening the down-stroke of a letter here and there, or blowing the loose <b>chalk</b> <b>off</b> the rainbow, or toning the outside edge of the shoulder of mutton. Though he did this with the greatest confidence, he did it (as it struck me) in so ignorant a manner, and so spoilt everything he touched, that when he began upon the purple smoke from the chimney of the distant cottage of the proprietor of the golden harvest (which smoke was beautifully soft), I found myself saying aloud, without considering of it: ...|$|E
60|$|And I have {{a better}} proof of this--at least I should have in every gravel-pit at Eversley--in {{a few pieces of}} a stone which is not chalk-flint at all; flattish and oblong, not {{more than two or three}} inches in diameter; of a grayish colour, and a porous {{worm-eaten}} surface, which no chalk-flint ever has. They are chert, which abound in the greensand formation; and insignificant as they look, are a great token of a most important fact; that the currents which formed our sands and gravels set from the south during a long series of ages, first till they had washed away all the <b>chalk</b> <b>off</b> the Weald, and next till they had washed away a great part of the sands, which then became exposed, the remains whereof form great commons over a wide tract of Surrey.|$|E
60|$|But I {{appealed to}} the king. I begged that my {{candidate}} might be examined. The king was willing, but the Board, who were all well-born folk, implored the king to spare them the indignity of examining the weaver's son. I knew they didn't know enough to examine him anyway, so I joined my prayers to theirs and the king turned the duty over to my professors. I had had a blackboard prepared, and it was put up now, and the circus began. It was beautiful to hear the lad lay out the science of war, and wallow in details of battle and siege, of supply, transportation, mining and countermining, grand tactics, big strategy and little strategy, signal service, infantry, cavalry, artillery, and all about siege guns, field guns, gatling guns, rifled guns, smooth bores, musket practice, revolver practice--and not a solitary word of it all could these catfish make head or tail of, you understand--and it was handsome to see him <b>chalk</b> <b>off</b> mathematical nightmares on the blackboard that would stump the angels themselves, and do it like nothing, too--all about eclipses, and comets, and solstices, and constellations, and mean time, and sidereal time, and dinner time, and bedtime, and every other imaginable thing above the clouds or under them that you could harry or bullyrag an enemy with and make him wish he hadn't come--and when the boy made his military salute and stood aside at last, I was proud enough to hug him, {{and all those other}} people were so dazed they looked partly petrified, partly drunk, and wholly caught out and snowed under. I judged that the cake was ours, and by a large majority.|$|E

50|$|On 23 April 1977, the {{two sides}} met in the semi-final of the FA Cup at Maine Road, Manchester. Although Liverpool took the lead twice, Everton fought back twice and {{appeared}} to have scored a winner when, with three minutes to play, Bryan Hamilton turned in a cross from Ronnie Goodlass, only to see the goal <b>chalked</b> <b>off</b> by referee Clive Thomas.|$|R

50|$|The {{biggest threat}} to white horses and other hill figures is natural {{vegetation}} covering the figures. In the case of chalk figures, natural vegetation encroaches from the edges and can grow on soil washed onto the figure by rain. Water erosion {{can also be a}} problem on steep or gentle slopes, because rain can wash the <b>chalk</b> <b>off</b> the horse, or soil onto the horse. Larger horses are more susceptible to this. If chalk is washed off the horse, the horse gradually creeps down the slope; or if soil is washed onto the horse, it collects onto the lower edges and the horse gradually climbs up the slope. A solution is to provide drainage, either using run-off drains, as at Uffington White Horse, or a french ditch.|$|E

She {{then took a}} break from {{competing}} to train in preparation for qualifying for the 2012 Summer Paralympics. With a personal best of 88 kg at Cardiff, Newson only entered the events that would ensure her position in the Great Britain team was secure. In February she qualified for the team taking the only position in the women's under 40 kg category. On 30 August, despite having her second lift <b>chalked</b> <b>off,</b> she equalled her personal best lifting 88 kg to take the bronze medal.|$|R

50|$|In {{the second}} {{leg of the}} final, Singapore had a goal {{controversially}} <b>chalked</b> <b>off</b> for being offside, but finally drew 1-1 to fellow co-host Thailand, with Khairul Amri scoring the decisive goal in the closing stages of the match, thus giving Singapore their 2nd title in succession, winning with an aggregate score of 3-2, and successfully defending the title. While Thailand can point to the controversial penalty for their defeat in the first leg, they failed to defeat Singapore in the Bangkok second-leg. It {{could have been worse}} for Thailand had the match officials seen Thai midfielder Datsakorn Thonglao head-butt Singapore's Khairul Amri to vent his anger after the equaliser.|$|R
50|$|Notably, a 10-0 {{win over}} Abertillery on 28 November 1914 {{set a new}} club record victory, but the result was {{declared}} void two days later when Abertillery resigned from the Southern League. Earlier wins over Leyton and Mardy were also <b>chalked</b> <b>off</b> when those clubs also left the league. Brentford won just three of the final 15 matches of the season, the one bright spot being the emergence of inside right Henry White. Low attendances meant the Bees finished a mid-table season £7,000 in debt and 1914-15 would become the final season of competitive football until 1919-20, {{after the war ended}} in November 1918.|$|R
50|$|The Cromer Shoal Chalk Beds are a <b>chalk</b> reef <b>off</b> {{the coast}} of Cromer, Norfolk in the United Kingdom, {{believed}} to be the largest chalk reef in Europe. Since January 2016, it has been designated as a Marine Conservation Zone.|$|R
50|$|Stoke had not won at Everton since 1981, {{with that}} run {{continuing}} with a 1-0 defeat. After an uneventful first half, {{the second half}} {{proved to be a}} better spectacle. Begović made his first start of the season and Stoke thought they should have gone into the lead through Tuncay. The Turkish international thought he had put the Potters ahead midway through the second half after capitalising on a defensive mistake from Toffees defender Leighton Baines, however his strike was harshly <b>chalked</b> <b>off</b> for an apparent foul on Baines. Despite that, chances continued to come for both sides in what was an exciting second 45 minutes, but it was the hosts who stole all three points thanks to Yakubu, who rifled home from eight-yards after a defensive mistake from Abdoulaye Faye.|$|R

50|$|In {{the final}} home match {{of the season}} Stoke picked up a well-earned point against in-form Everton. Neither side {{were able to find}} a {{breakthrough}} throughout the clash as Delap missed City's best opportunity in the second half whilst the Toffees thought they had won it through Phil Jagielka, only for Howard Webb to <b>chalk</b> it <b>off</b> for an infringement by Victor Anichebe late on.|$|R
5000|$|Arbroath were 15-0 up by half time, {{and scored}} another 21 {{goals in the}} second half. The Scottish Athletic Journal at the time wrote The leather was landed between the posts 41 times, but five of the times were disallowed. Here and there, enthusiasts would be seen scoring sheet and pencil in hand, taking note of the goals as one would score runs at a cricket match." [...] Referee Dave Stormont later claimed that had he taken a harder line with the Aberdeen team, Arbroath could have won 43-0. Stormont said: My only regret was that I <b>chalked</b> <b>off</b> seven goals, for while they may have looked {{doubtful}} from an offside point of view, so quickly did the Maroons carry the ball from midfield, and so close and rapid was their passing, {{that it was very}} doubtful whether they could be offside. It was claimed that Arbroath goalkeeper Jim Milne Sr did not touch the ball in the entire game and spent some of the match sheltering from the rain under a spectator's umbrella.|$|R

The draw saw them in the televised draw for the first round proper of the Cup, the stage where the Football League clubs join. Coalville won the replay 2-0 to face Wycombe Wanderers [...]That season saw Sedge finish the highest they have ever finished in the NCEL, finishing second behind high paying Buxton.

50|$|Wave action {{contributes}} {{towards the}} erosion of cliffs around Beachy Head, which experience frequent small rock falls. Since chalk forms in layers separated by contiguous bands of flints, the physical structure affects how the cliffs erode. Wave action undermines the lower cliffs, causing frequent slab failures - slabs from layers of <b>chalk</b> break <b>off,</b> undermining the upper parts of the cliffs, which eventually collapse. In contrast to small rock falls, mass movements are less common. A mass movement happened in 2001 when, after a winter of heavy rain, the water had begun to seep into the cracks which had frozen and caused the cracks to widen. This then made the cliff edge erode and collapse into the sea, destroying a well-known chalk stack called the Devil's Chimney.|$|R
50|$|Felt chalkboard erasers or {{blackboard}} dusters {{are used}} to erase chalk markings on a chalkboard. Chalk writing leaves light-coloured particles weakly adhering to a dark surface (e.g., white on black, or yellow on green); it can be rubbed off with a soft material, such as a rag. Erasers for chalkboards are made, with a block of plastic or wood, much larger than an eraser for pen or pencil, {{with a layer of}} felt on one side. The block is held in the hand and the felt rubbed against the writing, which it easily wipes <b>off.</b> <b>Chalk</b> dust is released, some of which sticks to the eraser until it is cleaned, usually by hitting it against a hard surface.|$|R
5000|$|To {{support the}} {{activities}} of the United States Bureau of Immigration, the United States Public Health Service operated an extensive medical service at the immigrant station, called U.S. Marine Hospital Number 43, more widely known as the Ellis Island Immigrant Hospital. It was the largest marine hospital in the nation. The medical division, which was active in the hospital wards, the Barge Office at the Battery and the Main Building, was staffed by uniformed military surgeons. They are best known for the role they played during the line inspection, in which they employed unusual techniques {{such as the use of}} the [...] to examine immigrants for signs of eye diseases (particularly, trachoma) and the use of a chalk mark code. Symbols were chalked on the clothing of potentially sick immigrants following the six-second medical examination. The doctors would look at the immigrants as they climbed the stairs from the baggage area to the Great Hall. Immigrants' behavior would be studied for difficulties in getting up the staircase. Some immigrants supposedly entered the country only by surreptitiously wiping the <b>chalk</b> marks <b>off,</b> or by turning their clothes inside out.|$|R
5000|$|Cacoma Knight is {{a hybrid}} of action and puzzle elements. Each level is a single screen. The first image that the player sees is a landscape, for example, a forest or a town. The image will then fade into a [...] "corrupt" [...] version of the landscape, for example, the trees become rotten and {{buildings}} become ruined. Each screen has a [...] "Qualify" [...] target that shows {{how much of the}} screen must be cleared before the game continues to the next level. The player can then use the Magical <b>Chalk</b> to section <b>off</b> an area of the landscape, using either the borders of existing cleared sections or the borders of the screen. When a full shape is completed with no holes in its borders, the smaller of the two sections created is [...] "purified" [...] and returned to the original state shown {{at the beginning of the}} level. In the cleared section, there may be power-ups or items that increase the point score of the player. Therefore, a greater [...] "% Cleared" [...] score means more points and power-ups will be rewarded, so it is beneficial to the player to attempt to clear as much of the screen as possible before exceeding the Qualify target.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Powers {{gave some}} amusing anecdotes {{of his early}} life, {{when he was a}} clerk in a store in Cincinnati. There was a museum opposite, the {{proprietor}} of which had a peculiar physiognomy that struck Powers, insomuch that he felt impelled to make continual caricatures of it. He used to draw them upon the door of the museum, and became so familiar with the face, that he could draw them in the dark; so that, every morning, here was this absurd profile of himself, greeting the museum-man when he came to open his establishment. Often, too, it would reappear within an hour after it was rubbed out. The man was infinitely annoyed, and made all possible efforts to discover the unknown artist, but in vain; and finally concluded, I suppose, that the likeness broke out upon the door of its own accord, like the nettle-rash. Some years afterwards, the proprietor of the museum engaged Powers himself as an assistant; and one day Powers asked him if he remembered this mysterious profile. [...] "Yes," [...] said he, [...] "did you know who drew them?" [...] Powers took a piece of <b>chalk,</b> and touched <b>off</b> the very profile again, before the man's eyes. [...] "Ah," [...] said he, [...] "if I had known it at the time, I would have broken every bone in your body!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Nothing, again, {{could be}} more prosaic and impenetrable than the {{domestic}} energies of Miss Diana Duke. But Innocent had somehow blundered on the discovery that her thrifty dressmaking went with a considerable feminine care for dress--the one feminine thing that had never failed her solitary self-respect. In consequence Smith pestered her with a theory (which he really seemed to take seriously) that ladies might combine economy with magnificence if they would draw light chalk patterns on a plain dress and then dust them off again. He set up [...] "Smith's Lightning Dressmaking Company," [...] with two screens, a cardboard placard, and box of bright soft crayons; and Miss Diana actually threw him an abandoned black overall or working dress on which to exercise the talents of a modiste. He promptly produced for her a garment aflame with red and gold sunflowers; she held it up an instant to her shoulders, and looked like an empress. And Arthur Inglewood, some hours afterwards cleaning his bicycle (with his usual air of being inextricably hidden in it), glanced up; and his hot face grew hotter, for Diana stood laughing for one flash in the doorway, and her dark robe was rich with the green and purple of great decorative peacocks, like a secret garden in the [...] "Arabian Nights." [...] A pang too swift to be named pain or pleasure went through his heart like an old-world rapier. He remembered how pretty he thought her years ago, when {{he was ready to}} fall in love with anybody; but it was like remembering a worship of some Babylonian princess in some previous existence. At his next glimpse of her (and he caught himself awaiting it) the purple and green <b>chalk</b> was dusted <b>off,</b> and she went by quickly in her working clothes.|$|R
