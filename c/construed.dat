Lexicalization patterns were explored by Talmy (1985), and since his seminal contribution he and others have developed his original study further as a contribution to linguistic comparison and typology (e. g.

Since section 10 should be strictly <b>construed</b> in favour of the detainees' liberty, the court could not imply a power of arrest and detention into section 10 when Parliament had not provided for it. The Court of Appeal took the view that once a suspension direction under section 10 is revoked, the original detention order becomes operative again. The power to arrest and detain is conferred by the detention order itself.|$|E

Furthermore, this impractical solution did not reflect the new status of Prussia in the overall scheme.

Consequently, Prussian leaders expected to play a pivotal role in German politics.|$|E
5|$|Points {{and lines}} {{may be viewed}} as special cases of circles; a point can be {{considered}} as a circle of infinitely small radius, and a line may be thought of an infinitely large circle whose center is also at infinity.

The nine other cases involving points and lines {{may be viewed as}} limiting cases of the general problem. These limiting cases often have fewer solutions than the general problem; for example, the replacement of a given circle by a given point halves the number of solutions, since a point can be <b>construed</b> as an infinitesimal circle that is either internally or externally tangent.|$|E

30|$|Because {{processes}} and entities inhabit different semiotic realms, they subcategorise in different ways. Verbal words are: (i) lexical verbs (including adjectives, which in Chinese are {{a kind of}} verb, not a kind of noun as in English); (ii) modal auxiliary verbs, which <b>construe</b> the likelihood and the desirability of the process; (iii) postpositive verbs, which show phases of the process, and (iv) prepositive verbs, which <b>construe</b> the relation between the process and some particular entity. (For comparison with English, prepositive verbs are similar to prepositions and postpositive verbs are similar to post-verbal adverbs.) Nominal words are: (i) lexical nouns; (ii) determiners (personals and demonstratives), which <b>construe</b> the identity of the thing and create cohesion with others; (iii) numeratives (numerals and “classifiers”), which itemize and <b>construe</b> quantity, and (iv) postpositive nouns, which indicate the facet of the thing.
