5|$|In the 1980s, a {{minority}} of the club's supporters had {{a reputation as one of}} Britain's most prominent <b>casuals</b> groups, the Aberdeen Soccer <b>Casuals.</b> The rise of the Aberdeen <b>Casuals</b> coincided with the most successful period in the club's history, and has been chronicled in more than one published account. Whilst numbers have steadily declined with the introduction of Football Banning Orders preventing hooligans from travelling to games, the Aberdeen <b>Casuals</b> still appear at big fixtures often away from home and in the UEFA Europa League. There were clashes at both fixtures against FC Groningen in 2014, as well as 13 arrests after violent clashes with Dundee United fans at a game in December 2015.|$|E

In the period after the Second World War, Hibs attracted average attendances in excess of 20,000, peaking at 31,567 in the 1951–52 season. Since Easter Road was redeveloped into an all-seater stadium in the mid-1990s, average attendance has varied between a high of 15,394 in 2016–17 and a low of 9,150 in 2003–04. In the 1980s and 1990s, a minority of the club's supporters had {{a reputation as one of}} Britain's most prominent <b>casuals</b> groups, known as the Capital City Service.|$|E

40|$|<b>Casual</b> sex {{has become}} {{culturally}} normative. A {{lot of research}} has been done in the US, but research in the Dutch population is scarce. The present study consists of two parts. The first part focuses on <b>casual</b> sex among Dutch university students. The second part focuses on selfesteem in relation to <b>casual</b> sex, and attitudes towards <b>casual</b> sex as a possible moderating factor. A sample of 108 Dutch female university students completed an online questionnaire. This questionnaire included the Dutch version of the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, the Dutch version of the Brief Sexual Attitudes Scale and a set of additional questions about <b>casual</b> sex. Results revealed that 88 % of the students engaged in <b>casual</b> sex and thus, having <b>casual</b> sex is very common. Overall, these females were very positive about their <b>casual</b> sex experience. Nevertheless, no relation was found between self-esteem and <b>casual</b> sex. In addition, attitudes towards <b>casual</b> sex {{turned out not to be}} a predictor for this relationship...|$|R

League football returned in August 1919, but Johnson did not play for the first team until much later in the season. He made his league debut against Middlesbrough on 18 February 1920 scoring both goals in a 2–0 win, playing in the position previously occupied by Tommy Browell. He kept his place for a further six matches, scoring one more goal.

40|$|Over {{the last}} few decades there has been a growing number of <b>casual</b> workers in New Zealand. Many of these workers are not {{adequately}} counted in statistics and {{little is known about the}} nature of their work or the impact this has on their lives. It is assumed that the majority of these <b>casual</b> workers are women (Davidson and Bray, 1994, Else, 1996, Shirley, 1996) This thesis examines the experiences of women in <b>casual</b> work. The primary source of data for this thesis is twelve indepth interviews with women involved in <b>casual</b> work. The women were encouraged to tell their own stories and relate their experiences. The thesis examines why these women are in <b>casual</b> work and examines what, if any, choice was available to the women. The research investigates the working conditions of the women's <b>casual</b> work. It then looks at the impact that <b>casual</b> work has on the women's personal lives. The women relate experiences which show how <b>casual</b> work has affected their finances, their health and their families. The thesis highlights how the different circumstances of each woman governs the extent to which <b>casual</b> work affects them. The results showed that while <b>casual</b> work was a positive experience for some women, it was a negative experience for others who were more vulnerable to the insecurity <b>casual</b> work can bring. Generally those women who were not reliant on the income from their <b>casual</b> work to provide for the needs of themselves and their family had more power to negotiate better conditions of work than women who relied on the <b>casual</b> work to provide a basic household income. The degree of need was also a predicator of the negative impact <b>casual</b> work had on the personal life of some women...|$|R
