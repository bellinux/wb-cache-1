40|$|In {{this article}} we propose a {{calculus}} of qualitative geographic coordinates which allows reasoning about cardinal directions on grid-based <b>reference</b> <b>systems</b> in maps. Grids in maps {{can be considered as}} absolute <b>reference</b> <b>systems.</b> The analysis reveals that the basic information <b>coded</b> in these <b>reference</b> <b>systems</b> is ordering information. Therefore, no metric information is required. We show that it is unnecessary to assume a coordinate system based on numbers in order to extract information like a point P is further north than a point Q. We investigate several grids in maps resulting from different types of projections. In addition, a detailed examination of the north arrow is given since it supplies a grid with ordering information. On this basis, we provide a general account on grids, their formalization and the inferences about cardinal directions drawn using qualitative geographic coordinates...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{principle}} of least effort in communications has been shown, by Ferrer i Cancho and Solé, to explain emergence of power laws (e. g., Zipf’s law) in human languages. This paper applies the principle and the information-theoretic model of Ferrer i Cancho and Solé to genetic coding. The {{application of the}} principle is achieved via equating the ambiguity of signals used by “speakers ” with codon usage, on the one hand, and the effort of “hearers ” with needs of amino acid translation mechanics, on the other hand. The re-interpreted model captures {{the case of the}} typical (vertical) gene transfer, and confirms that Zipf’s law {{can be found in the}} transition between referentially useless systems (i. e., ambiguous genetic <b>coding)</b> and indexical <b>reference</b> <b>systems</b> (i. e., zero-redundancy genetic coding). As with linguistic symbols, arranging genetic codes according to Zipf’s law is observed to be the optimal solution for maximising the referential power under the effort constraints. Thus, the model identifies the origins of scaling in genetic coding — via a trade-off between codon usage and needs of amino acid translation. Furthermore, the paper extends Ferrer i Cancho – Solé model to multiple inputs, reaching out toward the case of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) where multiple contributors may share the same genetic coding. Importantly, the extended model also leads to a sharp transition between referentially useless systems (ambiguous HGT) and indexical <b>reference</b> <b>systems</b> (zero-redundancy HGT). Zipf’s law is also observed to be the optimal solution in the HGT case. Preprin...|$|R

40|$|Background The {{burden of}} chronic disease is increasing, and {{research}} and quality improvement will be less effective if case finding strategies are suboptimal. Objective To describe an ontology-driven approach to case finding in chronic disease and how this approach {{can be used to}} create a data dictionary and make the codes used in case finding transparent. Method A five-step process: (1) identifying a <b>reference</b> <b>coding</b> <b>system</b> or terminology; (2) using an ontology-driven approach to identify cases; (3) developing metadata {{that can be used to}} identify the extracted data; (4) mapping the extracted data to the reference terminology; and (5) creating the data dictionary. Results Hypertension is presented as an exemplar. A patient with hypertension can be represented by a range of codes including diagnostic, history and administrative. Metadata can link the coding system and data extraction queries to the correct data mapping and translation tool, which then maps it to the equivalent <b>code</b> in the <b>reference</b> terminology. The <b>code</b> extracted, the term, its domain and subdomain, and the name of the data extraction query can then be automatically grouped and published online as a readily searchable data dictionary. An exemplar online is: www. clininf. eu/qickd-data-dictionary. html Conclusion Adopting an ontology-driven approach to case finding could improve the quality of disease registers and of research based on routine data. It would offer considerable advantages over using limited datasets to define cases.

40|$|The {{free energy}} of a {{molecular}} system can, at least in principle, be computed by thermodynamic perturbation from a <b>reference</b> <b>system</b> whose free energy is known. The convergence of such a calculation depends critically on the conformational overlap between the reference and the physical systems. One approach to defining a suitable <b>reference</b> <b>system</b> is to construct it from the one-dimensional marginal probability distribution functions (PDFs) of internal coordinates observed in a molecular simulation. However, the conformational overlap of this <b>reference</b> <b>system</b> tends to decline steeply with increasing dimensionality, due {{to the neglect of}} correlations among the coordinates. Here, we test a <b>reference</b> <b>system</b> that can account for pairwise correlations among the internal coordinates, as captured by their two-dimensional marginal PDFs derived from a molecular simulation. Incorporating pairwise correlations in the <b>reference</b> <b>system</b> is found to dramatically improve the convergence of the free energy estimates relative to the first-order <b>reference</b> <b>system,</b> due to increased conformational overlap with the physical distribution...|$|R
