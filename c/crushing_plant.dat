5|$|Limestone traffic {{continued}} on the Tiverton section. Only two boats were working the canal by 1904, {{and the last}} commercial traffic was roadstone from Whipcott quarry to Tiverton, {{where there was a}} <b>crushing</b> <b>plant.</b> Around 7,000tons per year were transported up to 1925. After this the only income was from the washing of sheep, for which a charge was made for every 20 sheep, and the sale of water lilies which grew in the canal. In the 1930s, dams were built at both ends of a section near Halberton, where persistent leakage could not be cured.|$|E
5|$|An {{ironstone}} {{mine was}} opened {{to work on}} a rock outcrop in 1853. The mine was to supply flux for the Port Adelaide copper smelting works, but it apparently closed within a year. It was reopened in 1861 and operated until 1862. The Tea Tree Gully Silver Mining Company began work in the area in 1888, constructing a tramway, blacksmith shop and a new road. With no economic finds, the company closed in July 1889. The quarry, in Water Gully adjacent to the nursery's ruins, has been mined for blue dolomite, some of which was used for the nursery's buildings. Quarries elsewhere in Water Gully were opened in the 1880s and intermittently supplied quartzite road metal for the District Council of Tea Tree Gully. A <b>crushing</b> <b>plant</b> was erected {{on the north side of}} the gully in 1912 to create this road material.|$|E
5|$|The {{skull of}} Plateosaurus {{is small and}} narrow, {{rectangular}} in side view, and nearly three times {{as long as it}} is high. There is an almost rectangular lateral temporal foramen at the back. The large, round orbit (eye socket), the sub-triangular antorbital fenestra and the oval naris (nostril) are of almost equal size. The jaws carried many small, leaf-shaped, socketed teeth: 5 to 6 per premaxilla, 24 to 30 per maxilla, and 21 to 28 per dentary (lower jaw). The thick, leaf-shaped, bluntly serrated tooth crowns were suitable for <b>crushing</b> <b>plant</b> material. The low position of the jaw joint gave the chewing muscles great leverage, so that Plateosaurus could deliver a powerful bite. These features suggest that it fed primarily to exclusively on plants. Its eyes were directed to the sides, rather than the front, providing all-round vision to watch for predators. Some fossil skeletons have preserved sclerotic rings (rings of bone plates that protect the eye).|$|E

40|$|Waiting line {{problems}} arise {{because there is}} too much demand on the facilities so that we can say that there is an excess of waiting time or inadequate number of service facilities. At the stone <b>crusher</b> <b>plant</b> mine the dumpers come to load from the loader. The <b>crusher</b> <b>plant</b> has 11 dumpers and these 11 dumpers make 88 trips during 8 -hour day. The company has one loader to load all the dumpers, which results in a formation of long waiting line or queue. Due to this queue there is a long waiting time in queue of dumpers and cost associated with waiting time of dumpers. Queuing theory can quite effectively analyze such queuing phenomenon. In this research paper I have applied the queuing theory to the stone <b>crusher</b> <b>plant</b> mine, where the queue of dumpers formed at the loading station. By applying the single channel queuing theory I analyzed the current situation of the stone <b>crusher</b> <b>plant</b> mine and find the problems of the current system. To overcome the above problems I have applied the multi-channel queuing theory to minimize the waiting time in queue of dumpers and very high cost associated with waiting time of dumpers. In the new system not only waiting time in queue of dumpers and very high cost associated with waiting time of dumpers is reduced but also there is an efficient utilization of dumpers and loaders along with provide the profitable situation to the <b>crusher</b> <b>plant...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{impact of}} {{salmonella}} contaminated feed ingredients on {{the risk for}} spreading salmonella to pigs was assessed in response to two incidences when salmonella was spread by feed from two feed mills to 78 swine producing herds. Methods The assessment was based on results from the salmonella surveillance of feed ingredients before introduction to feed mills and from HACCP - based surveillance of the feed mills. Results from the mills of the Company (A) that produced the salmonella contaminated feed, were by the Chi. Square test compared to the results {{from all the other}} (B - E) feed producers registered in Sweden. Isolated serovars were compared to serovars from human cases of salmonellosis. Results Salmonella (28 serovars) was frequently isolated from imported consignments of soybean meal (14. 6 %) and rape seed meal (10. 0 %). Company A largely imported soybean meal from <b>crushing</b> <b>plants</b> with a history of unknown or frequent salmonella contamination. The risk for consignments of vegetable proteins to be salmonella contaminated was 2. 4 times (P Conclusions Salmonella contaminated feed ingredients are an important source for introducing salmonella into the feed and food chain. Effective HACCP-based control and associated corrective actions are required to prevent salmonella contamination of feed. Efforts should be taken to prevent salmonella contamination already at the <b>crushing</b> <b>plants.</b> This is challenge for the EU - feed industry {{due to the fact that}} 98 % of the use of soybean/meal, an essential feed ingredient, is imported from <b>crushing</b> <b>plants</b> of third countries usually with an unknown salmonella status. </p...|$|R
