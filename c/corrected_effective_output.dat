This information {{can be used to}} supervise or improve the forming process. Measurements of acoustic emission in manufacturing machines in production lines shows that different events such as, galling, tool wear, lubricating failure, different viscosity of lubricants, stick-slip, necking and cracking of the sheet metal can be separated in time- and frequency domain. Laboratory tests show that proportionality exists between the <b>effective</b> <b>output</b> of the friction surfaces and the measured <b>effective</b> <b>output</b> of the AE-sensor in drawing a sheet metal between flat dies. The measured acoustic emission has been influenced by the smoothness, lubricants, relative speeds between the friction surfaces, the contact pressure between the surfaces, galling, changed geometry's of friction surfaces and different types of material in contact.

The buffers consisted of 90 mM berate set at pH 8. 4 (CZE) and 20 mM phosphate and 50 mM sodium dodecyl sulfate set at pH 7. 5 (MEKC).

5000|$|Qualitatively, this {{basically}} {{states that}} the relative amount of non-renewable resources decreases, the amount capital required to extract the resources increases. To more deeply examine this table requires examining the equation that it comes from, effective_output = industrial_capital*other_factors*(1-fcaor) So, if industrial capital and the other factors (described in the capital sector) are the same, then 1 unit of the effective capital when nrfr is 1.0 the <b>effective</b> <b>output</b> is 0.95 (= 1.0 * ( [...] 1 - 0.05)). So, when nrfr is 0.5, the <b>effective</b> <b>output</b> is 0.90 (= 1.0 * (1 - 0.10)). Another useful {{way to look at}} this equation is to reverse it and see how much effective capital is required to get 1 unit of <b>effective</b> <b>output</b> (i.e. effective_output / (1 - fcaor) = effective_capital). So, when nrfr is 1.0, the effective capital required for 1 unit of <b>effective</b> <b>output</b> is 1.053 (=1.0/(1-0.05)), and when nrfr is 0.3, the effective capital required is 2 (=1.0/(1-0.5)). Lastly is looking at the relative cost required for obtaining the resources. This {{based on the fact that}} it requires 1/19 of a unit of effective capital extra when the nrfr is 1.0. So, (effective capital required - 1.0) / (1 / 19) will give the relative cost of obtaining the resources compared to the cost of obtaining them when nrfr was 1.0. For example, when nrfr is 0.3, the effective capital required is 2.0, and 1.0 of that is for obtaining resources. So, the cost of obtaining the resources is (2.0 - 1.0) / ( [...] 1 / 19) or 1.0*19 or 19 times the cost when nrfr was 1.0. Here is a table showing these calculations for all the values: ...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} non-thermal {{radiation}} spectrum by tunnelling mechanism with correction {{due to the}} generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) {{in the background of}} non-commutative geometry. Considering the reformulation of the tunnelling mechanism by Banerjee and Majhi, the Hawking radiation spectrum is evaluated through the density matrix for the outgoing modes. The GUP <b>corrected</b> <b>effective</b> temperature and the corresponding GUP <b>corrected</b> <b>effective</b> metric in non-commutative geometry are determined using Hawking's periodicity arguments. Thus, we obtain further corrections to the non-strictly thermal black hole (BH) radiation spectrum which give new final distributions. Then, we show that the GUP and the non-commutative geometry modify the Bohr-like BH recently discussed in a series of papers in the literature. In particular, we find the intriguing result that the famous law of Bekenstein on the area quantization is affected neither by non-commutative geometry nor by the GUP. This is a clear indication of the universality of Bekenstein's result. In addition, we find that both the Bekentsein-Hawking entropy and the total BH entropy to third order approximation are still functions of the BH quantum level. Comment: 16 page...|$|R

However, {{in relation to}} black hole (BH) emission, this mechanism is mostly used to obtain the Hawking temperature by comparing the probability of emission of an outgoing particle with the Boltzmann factor. On the other hand, Banerjee and Majhi reformulated the tunnelling framework deriving a black body spectrum through the density matrix for the outgoing modes for both the Bose-Einstein distribution and the Fermi-Dirac distribution. In contrast, Parikh and Wilczek introduced a correction term performing an exact calculation of the action for a tunnelling spherically symmetric particle and, as a result, the probability of emission of an outgoing particle corresponds to a non-strictly thermal radiation spectrum. Recently, one of us (C.
