40|$|Since {{diabetes}} mellitus predisposes adults to group B streptococcal (GBS) bacteremia, a murine model of streptozotocin-induced diabetes and type II GBS bacteremia {{was developed to}} assess certain immune factors which might influence susceptibility to infection. In diabetic mice, the 50 % lethal dose for two strains of type II GBS was significantly lower (greater than 1 log 10 decrease in CFU per milliliter) than in control animals. This enhanced virulence of GBS for diabetic animals was associated with prolonged bacteremia, persistent sequestration of organisms in the splanchnic reticuloendothelial system, and a shift from splenic to hepatic clearance. Although immunization of control and diabetic animals resulted in high concentrations of type-specific serum antibody, it {{had no effect on}} late reticuloendothelial system sequestration in diabetics. In contrast, depletion of complement by treatment of mice with cobra venom factor blocked reticuloendothelial system clearance and resulted in fatal infection in both diabetic and control mice. These results indicate that neither type-specific antibody nor an intact complement system is adequate for effective clearance of type II GBS bacteremia in mice with experimentally induced diabetes. This <b>clearance</b> <b>deficit</b> could be the result of a defect in hepatocyte membrane receptors necessary for removal of this encapsulated microorganism...|$|E
40|$|Measurement of {{the plasma}} {{free amino acids}} by column {{chromatography}} (AutoAnalyzer) in 32 patients with primary gout showed statistically significant increases or decreases in several components {{when compared with the}} spectrum in 18 control subjects, but the absolute amounts involved were small and the mean total plasma amino acid concentrations in both groups were the same. In the urine all major amino acid components, notably glutamine, serine, threonine, and leucine, were lower in our gouty than in our nongouty subjects, as were also the corresponding renal <b>clearance</b> ratios. These <b>deficits</b> could be reproduced by restricting dietary protein, so appear to be due largely to the some-what reduced mean dietary protein intake of our gouty subjects. However, the low renal clearance of glutamine, the most striking and consistent of the deficits in urinary amino acids noted, could not be accounted for by dietary or other relevant factors, and is interpreted as indicating increased tubular reabsorption of glutamine in primary gout. This interpretation was supported by the results of glutamine loading. The possible compensatory relationship of the abnormality in renal handling of glutamine to the deficiency in renal production of ammonia previously reported is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Paediatric {{subdural}} empyema is frequently seen in developing Asean countries secondary to rinosinusogenic origins. A cross-sectional {{analysis on the}} surgical treatment of intracranial {{subdural empyema}} in Hospital Kuala Lumpur (HKL), a major referral center, was done in 2004. A total number of 44 children who fulfilled the inclusion criteria were included into this study. The methods of first surgery, volume of empyema on contrasted CT brain, improvement of neurological status, re-surgery, mortality and morbidity, {{as well as the}} demographic data such as age, gender, sex, duration of illness, clinical presentation, probable origin of empyema, cultures and follow-up were studied. Chi-square test was performed to determine the association between surgical methods and the survival of the patients, neurological improvement, clearance of empyema on CT brain, re-surgery and long morbidity among the survivors. If the 20 % or more of the cells were having expected frequency less than five, then Fisher’s Exact test was applied. The level of significance was set at 0. 05. SPSS version 12. 0 was used for data entry and data analysis. There were 44 patients who were less than 18 years. Their mean age was 5. 90 ± 6. 01 years. There were 30 males (68. 2 %) and 14 females (31. 8 %) involved in the study. Malays were majority with 28 (63. 6 %) followed by Indian 8 (18. 2 %), Chinese 5 (11. 4 %) and others 3 (6. 8 %). The variables which were under interest were gender, race, headache, vomiting, seizures, sign of meningism, cranial nerve palsy, thickness site of abscess, first surgical treatment, improvement in neurological <b>deficit,</b> <b>clearance</b> of CT and whether re-surgery was necessary. All variables were found not to be associated with Henk W Mauser Score for PISDE grading. Comparison between this urban study and a rural setting study by the same corresponding author in the same period on subdural empyema was done. Common parameters were compared and it was found out that seizures were more prevalent in urban study where the patients are more than one year old (p= 0. 005). Mortality was much higher in urban study than the rural one (p= 0. 040). The larger proportion of urban group had volume of abscess {{less than or equal to}} 50 ml (p=< 0. 001) ...|$|R
