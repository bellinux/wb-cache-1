40|$|Abstractâ€”GPUs employ massive {{multithreading}} {{and fast}} con-text switching to provide high throughput and hide memory latency. Multithreading can increase contention for various sys-tem resources, however, {{that may result}} in suboptimal utilization of shared resources. Previous research has proposed variants of throttling thread-level parallelism to reduce cache contention and improve performance. Throttling approaches can, however, lead to under-utilizing thread contexts, on-chip interconnect, and off-chip memory bandwidth. This paper proposes to tightly <b>couple</b> the <b>thread</b> scheduling mechanism with the cache management algorithms such that GPU cache pollution is minimized while off-chip memory throughput is enhanced. We propose priority-based cache allocation (PCAL) that provides preferential cache capacity to a subset of high-priority threads while simultaneously allowing lower priority threads to execute without contending for the cache. By tuning thread-level parallelism while both optimizing caching efficiency {{as well as other}} shared resource usage, PCAL builds upon previous thread throttling approaches, improving overall performance by an average 17 % with maximum 51 %.

40|$|Abstractâ€”We {{present a}} {{lightweight}} hardware framework for providing high assurance detection {{and prevention of}} code injection attacks using a lockstep diversified shadow execution. Recent studies show that hardware diversification can detect software attacks by checking the consistency of their behavior si-multaneously. Unfortunately, the severe performance degradation and extra system costs caused by these methods are unacceptable in many applications. This paper presents a hardware-level, lockstep shadow thread framework to enrich {{the diversity of the}} software execution, with the facilitation from programmable hardware decoder and novel CPU support of tightly <b>coupled</b> shadow <b>thread</b> technique. Specifically, given a piece of (legacy) binary code, we first generate diversified binary versions using an offline binary rewriter and programmable hardware binary translator at runtime. Two diversified binary code images are launched as dual simultaneous threads in the hardware layer with one as the primary thread and the other one as shadow thread. Instructions from the shadow thread are not executed but just compared, and thus incur no OS side-effects. The extended CPU is able to decode instructions from both threads, and dispatch them to the next stage pipeline for a lockstep comparison. Any mismatch of the decoded instructions from the two threads caused by remotely injected binary code will be detected. Our design provides instruction set randomization (ISR) with minimal cost in performance, when compared with straight-forward ISR implementation. The simulation results indicate that our framework incurs very small overheads and provides a protection against code injection attacks. I...|$|R

40|$|Supporting dynamic {{parallelism}} {{is important}} for GPU to benefit {{a broad range of}} applications. There are cur-rently two fundamental ways for programs to exploit dy-namic parallelism on GPU: a software-based approach with software-managed worklists, and a hardware-based approach through dynamic subkernel launches. Neither is satisfactory. The former is complicated to program and is often subject to some load imbalance; the latter suâ†µers large runtime overhead. In this work, we propose free launch, a new software approach to overcoming the shortcomings of both meth-ods. It allows programmers to use subkernel launches to express dynamic parallelism. It employs a novel compiler-based code transformation named subkernel launch removal to replace the subkernel launches with the reuse of parent <b>threads.</b> <b>Coupled</b> with an adaptive task assignment mechanism, the transformation reas-signs the tasks in the subkernels to the parent threads with a good load balance.

40|$|A {{system for}} {{coupling}} a vascular overflow graft or cannula to a heart pump. A pump pipe outlet {{is provided with}} an external tapered surface which receives {{the end of a}} compressible connula. An annular compression ring with a tapered internal bore surface is arranged about the cannula with the tapered internal surface in a facing relationship to the external tapered surface. The angle of inclination of the tapered surfaces is converging such that the spacing between the tapered surfaces decreases {{from one end of the}} external tapered surface to the other end thereby providing a clamping action of the tapered surface on a cannula which increases as a function of the length of cannula segment between the tapered surfaces. The annular compression ring is disposed within a tubular locking nut which threadedly couples to the pump and provides a compression force for urging the annular ring onto the cannula between the tapered surfaces. The nut has a threaded connection to the pump body. The <b>threaded</b> <b>coupling</b> to the pump body provides a compression force for the annular ring. The annular ring has an annular enclosure space in which excess cannula material from the compression between the tapered surfaces to "bunch up" in the space and serve as an enlarged annular ring segment to assist holding the cannula in place.

The calculations investigated three sucker rod sizes and various combinations of the slimhole, Spiralock, and Flexbar modifications to the coupling. In addition, the effect of various make-ups (assembly tightness) on the performance of coupling was investigated. An axial load was applied to the sucker rod ranging from {minus} 5 ksi to 40 ksi, encompassing three load cycles identified on a modified Goodman diagram as acceptable for indefinite service life of the sucker rods. The simulations of the various coupling geometries and make-ups were evaluated with respect to how well they accomplish the two primary objectives of preloading threaded couplings: (1) to lock the <b>threaded</b> <b>coupling</b> together so that it will not loosen and eventually uncouple, and (2) to improve the fatigue resistance of the threaded connection by reducing the stress amplitude in the coupling when subjected to cyclic loading. Perhaps the most significant finding in this study was the characterization of the coupling parameters which affect two stress measures. The mean hydrostatic stress, which determines the permissible effective alternating stress, {{is a function of the}} coupling make-up. Whereas, the alternating effective stress is a function of the relative stiffnesses of the pin and box sections of the coupling and, as long as the coupling does not separate, is unaffected by the amount of circumferential displacement applied during make-up.

40|$|Rings and gaps {{are being}} {{observed}} in {{an increasing number}} of disks around young stellar objects. We illustrate the formation of such radial structures through idealized, 2 D (axisymmetric) resistive MHD simulations of <b>coupled</b> disk-wind systems <b>threaded</b> by a relatively weak poloidal magnetic field (plasma-Î²âˆ¼ 10 ^ 3). We find two distinct modes of accretion depending on the resistivity and field strength. A small resistivity or high field strength promotes the development of rapidly infalling `avalanche accretion streams' in a vertically extended disk envelope that dominates the dynamics of the system, especially the mass accretion. The streams are suppressed in simulations with larger resistivities or lower field strengths, where most of the accretion instead occurs through a laminar disk. In these simulations, the disk accretion is driven mainly by a slow wind that is typically accelerated by the pressure gradient from a predominantly toroidal magnetic field. Both wind-dominated and stream-dominated modes of accretion create prominent features in the surface density distribution of the disk, including rings and gaps, with a strong spatial variation of the magnetic flux relative to the mass. Regions with low mass-to-flux ratios accrete quickly, leading to the development of gaps, whereas regions with higher mass-to-flux ratios tend to accrete more slowly, allowing matter to accumulate and form dense rings. In some cases, avalanche accretion streams are observed to produce dense rings directly through continuous feeding. We discuss the implications of ring and gap formation driven by winds and streams on grain growth and planet formation. Comment: 23 pages, 10 figures, accepted by MNRA...|$|R
