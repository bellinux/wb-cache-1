40|$|This article {{offers the}} first {{detailed}} scholarly {{account of the}} role of the continuity supervisor, also known as script supervisor, in film production. After examining in more general terms its attendant duties and responsibilities, the typical career trajectories of a number of ‘continuity girls’ working in British cinema and the deeply gendered nature of this section of film production labour, the article goes on to examine <b>continuity</b> <b>supervision</b> in more depth through looking at two specific case studies: two continuity supervisors who worked on several productions directed by David Lean, Maggie Unsworth and Barbara Cole. The work of Unsworth and Cole provides a starting point for reconsidering the significance of the hitherto critically marginalised ‘continuity girl’, and the article concludes with suggestions for further study in this area...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} is to examine the <b>continuity</b> of <b>supervision</b> and how it is done. It is thought that the study is {{important}} because it brings out the ideas of supervisors about the <b>continuity</b> of <b>supervision.</b> This study is a qualitative research and a semi structured interview is used. Participants are composed of education supervisors in İzmir. Purposive sampling method is used in the study. At the end, the importance of <b>continuity</b> in educational <b>supervision</b> is emphasized...|$|R

This presents a huge challenge to rural and remote health services where crisis management of chronic problems is all too common.

40|$|One of {{the central}} {{problems}} in studies of patient satisfaction with health care {{is the development of}} reliable and valid methods to determine the relative importance of different aspects of health care. Two techniques, paired comparisons and rating on a visual analogue scale, were compared in terms of their consistency with logical assumptions, test-retest reliability, and convergent validity. Thirty women with breast cancer were asked to assess brief hypothetical scenarios describing out-patient clinic visits to a tertiary cancer care centre. Each scenario incorporated three variables related to satisfaction with care: staff attitude, control over treatment decisions, and <b>continuity</b> of medical <b>supervision.</b> The paired choice method showed marginally better reliability and logical consistency than the rating method. Of the three variables assessed, <b>continuity</b> of medical <b>supervision</b> was consistently ranked highest in importance, and control over treatment decisions lowest. These preference assessment techniques appear to be suitable for use in the development of patient satisfaction indices, and for studies designed to examine variations in the priority given to different aspects of satisfaction with care. paired comparisons rating scales health care patient satisfaction...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Self-directed {{learning}} is an educational concept {{that has received}} increasing attention. The recent workplace literature, however, reports problems with the facilitation of self-directed learning in clinical practice. We developed the Midwifery Assessment and Feedback Instrument (MAFI) as a framework to facilitate self-directed learning. In the present study, we sought clinical supervisors' perceptions of the usefulness of MAFI. METHODS: Interviews with fifteen clinical supervisors were audio taped, transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically using Atlas-Ti software for qualitative data analysis. RESULTS: Four themes emerged from the analysis. (1) The competency-based educational structure promotes the setting of realistic learning outcomes and a focus on competency development, (2) instructing students to write reflections facilitates student-centred supervision, (3) creating a feedback culture is necessary to achieve <b>continuity</b> in <b>supervision</b> and (4) integrating feedback and assessment might facilitate competency development {{under the condition that}} evidence is discussed during assessment meetings. Supervisors stressed the need for direct observation, and instruction how to facilitate a self-directed learning process. CONCLUSION: The MAFI appears to be a useful framework to promote self-directed learning in clinical practice. The effect can be advanced by creating a feedback and assessment culture where learners and supervisors share the responsibility for developing self-directed learning...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Changes {{to health}} care systems and working hours have {{fragmented}} residents 2 ̆ 7 clinical experiences with potentially negative effects on their development as professionals. Investigation of off-site supervision, which has been implemented in isolated rural practice, could reveal important but less overt components of residency education. Method: Insights from sociocultural learning theory and work-based learning provided a theoretical framework. In 2011 - 2012, 16 family physicians in Australia and Canada were asked in-depth how they remotely supervised residents 2 ̆ 7 work and learning, and for their reflections on this experience. The verbatim interview transcripts and researchers 2 ̆ 7 memos formed the data set. Template analysis produced a description and interpretation of remote supervision. Results: Thirteen Australian family physicians from five states and one territory, and three Canadians from one province, participated. The main themes were how remoteness changed the dynamics of care and supervision; the importance of ongoing, holistic, nonhierarchical, supportive supervisory relationships; and that residents learned "clinical courage" through responsibility for patients 2 ̆ 7 care over time. Distance required supervisors to articulate and pass on their expertise to residents but made monitoring difficult. Supervisory continuity encouraged residents to build on past experiences and confront deficiencies. Conclusions: Remote supervision enabled residents to develop as clinicians and professionals. This questions the supremacy of co-location as an organizing principle for residency education. Future specialists may benefit from programs that give them ongoing and increasing responsibility {{for a group of}} patients and supportive <b>continuity</b> of <b>supervision</b> as resident...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background In {{keeping with}} its mission to produce doctors for rural and {{regional}} Australia, the University of Wollongong, Graduate School of Medicine has established an innovative model of clinical education. This includes a 12 -month integrated community-based clerkship in a regional or rural setting, offering senior students longitudinal {{participation in a}} 'community of practice' with access to continuity of patient care experiences, <b>continuity</b> of <b>supervision</b> and curriculum, and individualised personal and professional development. This required developing new teaching sites, based on attracting preceptors and providing them with educational and physical infrastructure. A major challenge was severe health workforce shortages. Methods Before the new clerkship started, we interviewed 28 general practitioners to determine why they engaged as clerkship preceptors. Independent researchers conducted semi-structured interviews. Responses were transcribed for inductive qualitative content analysis. Results The new model motivated preceptors to engage because it enhanced their opportunities to contribute to authentic learning {{when compared with the}} perceived limitations of short-term attachments. Preceptors appreciated the significant recognition of the value of general practice teaching and the honour of major involvement in the university. They predicted that the initiative would have positive effects on general practitioner morale and improve the quality of their practice. Other themes included the doctors' commitment to their profession, 'handing on' to the next generation and helping their community to attract doctors in the future. Conclusions Supervisors perceive that new models of clinical education offer alternative solutions to health care education, delivery and workforce. The longitudinal relationship between preceptor, student and community was seen as offering reciprocal benefits. General practitioners are committed to refining practice and ensuring generation of new members in their profession. They are motivated to engage in novel regional and rural longitudinal clinical clerkships as they perceive that they offer students an authentic learning experience and are a potential strategy to help address workforce shortages and maldistribution. </p...|$|R
40|$|CONTEXT Longitudinal {{integrated}} clerkships (LICs) {{have been}} widely implemented in both rural and urban contexts, as is now evident in the wealth of studies published internationally. This narrative literature review aims to summarise current evidence regarding the outcomes of LICs for student, clinician and community stakeholders. METHODS Recent literature was examined for original research articles pertaining to outcomes of LICs. RESULTS Students in LICs achieve academic results equivalent to {{and in some cases}} better than those of their counterparts who receive clinical education in block rotations. Students in LICs are reported to have well-developed patient-centred communication skills, demonstrate understanding of the psychosocial contributions to medicine, and report more preparedness in higher-order clinical and cognitive skills in comparison with students in traditional block rotations (TBRs). Students in LICs take on increased responsibility with patients and describe having more confidence in dealing with ethical dilemmas. <b>Continuity</b> of <b>supervision</b> reportedly facilitates incremental knowledge acquisition, and supervisors provide incrementally progressive feedback. Despite early disorientation regarding the organising of their learning, students feel well supported by the continuity of student–preceptor relationships and value the contributions made by these. Students in LICs living and working in rural areas are positively influenced towards primary care and rural career choices. DISCUSSION A sound body of knowledge in the field of LIC research suggests it is time to move beyond descriptive or exploratory research that is designed to justify this new educational approach by comparing academic results. As the attributes of LIC alumni are better understood, it is important to conduct explanatory research to develop a more complete understanding of these findings and a foundation for new theoretical frameworks that underpin educational change. CONCLUSIONS Longitudinal integrated clerkships are now recognised as representing credible and effective pedagogical alternatives to TBRs in medical education.

40|$|Context: During clerkships, {{teaching}} and learning in day-to-day activities occur in many moments of interaction among doctors, patients, peers and other co-workers. How people talk with one another influences their identity, their position {{and what they are}} allowed to do. This paper focuses on the opportunities and challenges of such moments of interaction between doctors and students during a clerkship characterised by short supervisory relationships. Methods: This study was conducted in a 10 -week internal medicine clerkship. Nine students and 10 doctors who worked with these nine students participated by regularly describing moments of interaction, using dictaphones. We performed critical discourse analysis of material sourced from a total of 184 audio diary entries and seven student debriefing interviews to reveal how participants discursively shaped the way they could think, speak and conduct themselves. Results: The ways in which doctors and students posed and answered questions represented a recurrent and influential feature in the diaries. This Question and Answer dynamic revealed six discourses of Basic Learning Need, Care and Attention, Power Game, Exchange of Currency, Distance, and Equality and Reciprocity. These discourses and the interplay among them revealed both students' and doctors' frameworks of needs and expectations in a culturally defined power structure. The interplay among the discourses reflected the ways in which doctor-student interactions afforded meaningful contributions to their medical or educational practice such as in the exchange of authentic professional or personal experience. Conclusions: By purposefully bringing power structures to the surface, we have addressed the complexity of learning and teaching as it occurs in day-to-day moments of interaction in a clerkship with little <b>continuity</b> in <b>supervision.</b> Both doctors and students should be supported to reflect critically on how they contribute to supervisory relationships with reference to, for example, {{the ways in which they}} ask or answer questions. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Hot {{beverage}} scalds are {{a leading}} cause of burns in young children. The aim {{of this study was to}} look at the circumstances surrounding these injuries in terms of setting, mechanism, supervision and first aid to inform a prevention campaign. Methods: A cross-sectional study was delivered via iPad to parents and caregivers presenting with a child aged 0 – 36 months with a hot beverage scald at a major paediatric burns centre. Results: Of the 101 children aged 0 – 36 months that presented with a hot beverage scald over a 12 -month period, 54 participants were included. The scald aetiology was as expected with the peak prevalence in children aged 6 – 24 months, pulling a cup of hot liquid down over themselves. The majority of injuries occurred in the child’s home and were witnessed by the caregiver or parent. The supervising adult was often in close proximity when the scald occurred. Less than a third (28 %) of participants received recommended first aid treatment at the scene, with an additional 18 % receiving this treatment with three hours of the injury— usually at an emergency department. Conclusions: While the aetiology of these scalds were as expected, the low use of recommended burn first aid was of concern. Although supervision was present in almost all cases, with the parent/caregiver close-by, this proximity still permitted injury. Attentiveness and <b>continuity</b> of <b>supervision,</b> which can be difficult with competing parental demands, appear to play a more important role role; as do considerations of other safety mechanisms such as hazard reduction through keeping hot drinks out of reach and engineering factors such as improved cup design. By incorporating the findings from this study and other research into a hot beverage scald prevention campaign, we hope to see a change in knowledge and behaviour in parents and caregivers of young children, and ultimately a reduction in the incidence of hot beverage scalds.

40|$|Summary {{objectives}} To synthesise {{data from}} four recent studies in Tanzania examining maternal syphilis screening and its operational implementation in routine antenatal clinics (ANC), drawing lessons for strengthened antenatal {{services for the}} prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV. methods The impact of untreated maternal syphilis was examined in a retrospective cohort of 380 Tanzanian women. Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of screening and single dose benzathine penicillin treatment were prospectively examined in 1688 pregnant women. Observation, interviews and facility audits were carried out in health facilities within nine districts to determine the operational reality of syphilis screening. results Overall, 49 % of women with untreated high titre syphilis experienced an adverse pregnancy outcome compared with 11 % of uninfected women. Stillbirth and low birthweight rates among those treated for high- or low-titre syphilis were reduced to rates similar to those for uninfected women. The economic cost was $ 1. 44 per woman screened and $ 10. 56 per disability-adjusted life year saved. In the operational study, only 43 % of 2256 ANC attenders observed were screened and only 61 % of sero-reactive women and 37 % of their partners were treated. Adequate training, <b>continuity</b> of supplies, <b>supervision</b> and quality control are critical elements for strengthened antenatal services, but are fre...|$|R
