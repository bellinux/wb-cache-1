25|$|OSA {{also appears}} to have a genetic component; those with a family history of it are more likely to develop it themselves. Lifestyle factors such as smoking may also {{increase}} the chances of developing OSA as the <b>chemical</b> <b>irritants</b> in smoke tend to inflame the soft tissue of the upper airway and promote fluid retention, both of which can result in narrowing of the upper airway. An individual may also experience or exacerbate OSA with the consumption of alcohol, sedatives, or any other medication that increases sleepiness as most of these drugs are also muscle relaxants.|$|E
25|$|Police {{brutality}} in Greece today predominantly {{manifests itself}} {{in the form of}} unjustified and extreme physical violence towards protesters and journalists. Amnesty International highlights that the continued targeting of journalists is very concerning as it infringes on the right to freedom of expression. According to a recent Amnesty International report there have been multiple instances in which police have used excessive brutal force, have misused less-lethal weapons against protesters, have attacked journalists, and have subjected bystanders to ill treatment, particularly {{over the course of the}} anniversary of the 1973 student uprising against the Military Junta, as mentioned previously, which took place on November 17, 2014. Allegations against police have emerged specifically in relation to their use of brutal force, completely unprovoked, towards journalists documenting the demonstration, and against many students who partook in a peaceful protest. Allegedly police sprayed protesters with <b>chemical</b> <b>irritants</b> from close range – in one instance a 17 year old girl with asthma had been treated in hospital after this attack and when she informed police of her condition they merely laughed.|$|E

Recent progress in understanding the mediators, triggers, and regulation of neurogenic inflammation is reviewed. Evidence for and speculations about a role for neurogenic inflammation in established disorders such as asthma, rhinitis, contact dermatitis, migraine headache, and rheumatoid arthritis are presented. The sick building syndrome and multiple chemical sensitivity syndrome have been defined as clinical entities in which exposure to chemical inhalants gives rise to disease. Current data on the existence of <b>chemical</b> <b>irritant</b> receptors in the airway and skin are discussed; neurogenic inflammation arising from stimulation of <b>chemical</b> <b>irritant</b> receptors is a possible model to explain many of the aspects of chemical sensitivities.

However, it is possible for newborns to suffer from neonatal conjunctivitis due to reactions with chemicals in these common eye drops. Additionally, a blocked tear duct may be another non-infectious cause of neonatal conjunctivitis.|$|E

50|$|Model studies {{indicate}} that PG2 (but not specific antigens or IgE cross-linkage) stimulates mouse and human mast cells to release histamine by an EP3-dependent mechanism. Furthermore, EP3-deficient mice fail to develop increased capillary permeability and tissue swelling in response to EP3 receptor agonists and the metabolic precursor to PGE2, arachidonic acid. It is suggested, based on these and other less direct studies, that PGE2-EP3 signaling {{may be responsible for}} the skin swelling and edema provoked by topical 5-aminolaevulinic acid photodynamic therapy, contact with <b>chemical</b> <b>irritants,</b> infection with pathogens, and various skin disorders in humans.|$|E
40|$|Individuals {{may develop}} {{symptoms}} {{in response to}} inhaled odors, <b>chemicals,</b> and <b>irritants.</b> This may affect their quality of life. Little {{is known about the}} prevalence and severity of symptoms that result from exposure to odors, <b>chemicals</b> and <b>irritants.</b> This study demonstrates {{the development of a new}} respiratory questionnaire to detect the prevalence and severity of symptoms experienced upon exposure to <b>chemicals,</b> odors, and <b>irritants,</b> and relates these symptoms to quality of life. This questionnaire was submitted to 96 volunteers at the University of South Florida College of Public Health who responded to items regarding symptoms developed in response to exposure to automobile exhaust, cigarette smoke, strong smells, cologne, perfumes or scented candles, or fresh paint vapors or fumes. Health-related quality of life was assessed using a subscale included with the questionnaire. The number and severity of symptoms developed in response to exposure to odors, <b>chemicals,</b> and <b>irritants</b> showed a strong negative correlation with health-related quality of life, consistent with intuitive estimates of the direction of this relationship. Also, it was shown that in normal populations, males and females develop statistically similar prevalence and severity of symptoms in response to exposure to odors, <b>chemicals,</b> and <b>irritants...</b>|$|R

5000|$|The {{black and}} white pattern of adults is {{believed}} to have evolved to mimic the pattern of the aggressive ground beetle Anthia sexguttata that has strong defenses, including the ability to spray <b>chemical</b> <b>irritants.</b> The upperside of the abdomen is orange-yellow, but is hidden by the tegmina. The spots on the asymmetrical tegmina are placed so that when closed, the spots appear symmetrical. The right tegmen lobe is bright orange-yellow. The species has been said {{to be one of the}} few cockroaches with [...] "grace and beauty". The head is bent back underneath the pronotal shield (hypognathous) and the ocelli (simple eyes) face forward, helping sense light and thereby time foraging activity during early morning and late evening.|$|E
