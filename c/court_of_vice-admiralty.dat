[...] Howard was sent to await trial before a <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> <b>Vice-Admiralty,</b> on the charge of piracy, but Brand and his colleague, Captain Gordon (of [...] ) refused to serve with Holloway present. [...] Incensed, Holloway had no option but to stand down, and was replaced by the Attorney General of Virginia, John Clayton, whom Spotswood described as [...] "an honester man [...] ".

2500|$|Whilst the British {{admiralty}} court had jurisdiction over criminal offenses committed upon the high seas, {{the jurisdiction of}} the court was rarely invoked. [...] The civil law was well suited to dealing with commercial transactions. [...] However, it could not cope adequately with criminal offenses. [...] The court needed to rely upon the old Roman civil law to establish any breaches. [...] Former Chief Justice Frederick Jordan noted that criminal cases often fell through because sailors weren’t available to give evidence (whether by malice or design). [...] A sentence of death could only not be imposed unless two witnesses could be produced. [...] To deal with this problem, the British Parliament passed the Piracy Act 1698 (UK). [...] This enabled the Crown to appoint seven commissioners to try offenses of piracy under that Act. [...] Whilst that latter court was often called a vice-{{admiralty court}}, Australian legal historian John Bennett has shown that that court {{should not be confused with}} the present court. [...] The latter court [...] was legally distinct as it was constituted under a separate letters patent dated 12 May 1787 as the <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> <b>Vice-Admiralty</b> and it was constituted by commissioners rather than a judge.|$|E

5000|$|Due to a {{high degree}} of tension amongst the colonial powers, most of the ships {{stationed}} in the Caribbean were more concerned with engaging each other than they were with engaging the pirates of the time. However, this same time period saw a resurgence of piracy in the Caribbean due to the growth of the slave trade. Pirates saw the slave trade as a new lucrative source of income. They could easily capture a crew and ransom the valuable slaves that were their cargo. [...] As the piracy increasingly interfered with the lucrative slave trade come from the Caribbean, colonial powers had a changing attitude towards piracy. Military presence had been growing in Caribbean waters for some time, but now the Royal Navy especially was more concerned with the growing issue of slavery, increasing the number of ships dedicated to policing slavery from two in 1670 to twenty-four by 1700. Despite increasing military power, Piracy saw a brief resurgence between the end of the War of the Spanish Succession in 1713 and around 1720, as many unemployed seafarers took to piracy as a way to make ends meet when a surplus of sailors after the war led to a decline in wages and working conditions. At the same time, one of the terms of the Treaty of Utrecht that ended the war gave to Great Britains Royal African Company and other British slavers a thirty-year asiento, or contract, to furnish African slaves to the Spanish colonies, providing British merchants and smugglers potential inroads into the traditionally closed Spanish markets in America and leading to an economic revival for the whole region. This revived Caribbean trade provided rich new pickings for a wave of piracy. Also contributing to the increase of Caribbean piracy at this time was Spains breakup of the English logwood settlement at Campeche and the attractions of a freshly sunken silver fleet off the southern Bahamas in 1715. This last large resurgence of piracy saw a change in attitude of the colonial powers towards piracy. It had once been seen as a somewhat minor offense only punishable if suspects and evidence were taken back to Europe for formal proceedings. Now, the English Parliament set the system <b>of</b> <b>courts</b> <b>of</b> <b>Vice-Admiralty,</b> appointing seven commissioners in the colonies to carry out the legal proceedings. These commissioners were chosen from naval and colonial officers who already contained a certain amount of bias towards the local pirates, instead of civilian judges. Pirates were given no representation in the new courts and were, therefore, often sentenced to hang. Between 1716 and 1726 approximately 400 to 600 pirates were executed. [...] Another major attitude change was the policy that if ones ship was attacked by pirates, then one must fight back and attempt to resist to the capture of their ship lest they receive six months imprisonment.|$|R
500|$|Nonetheless, Villiers {{continued}} to press his claims to office on Perceval, {{in a letter}} of 18 October 1809.

In fact, that office was about to become the engine of Villiers' political destruction.

50|$|He {{was born}} in Belville, County Westmeath, Ireland on 21 May 1806, the eldest son of Charles Baggs and Eleanor Kyan.

50|$|The courts became quickly unpopular. This was {{not only}} because of the express {{prohibition}} of jury trials or the fact that vice-admiralty judges tended to believe that common law courts did not have superior status. It was also because a whole range of technical issues confused the legal system. It was often not clear whether vice-admiralty courts had jurisdiction over creeks or bays, or whether the governor could create vice-admiralty courts through vice-regal powers, or whether or not there was a clear method of separating the jurisdictions and procedures <b>of</b> <b>vice-admiralty</b> and common law jurisdiction. As a consequence <b>of</b> this, <b>vice-admiralty</b> <b>courts</b> became ineffective and, as many colonists perceived, unjust.|$|R

25|$|It is {{said that}} William III showed his {{appreciation}} of Shaftesbury's services on this latter occasion by offering him a secretaryship of state, which, however, his worsening health compelled him to decline.

50|$|Moving into seal hunting, {{despite the}} decline of the industry, Underwood {{purchased}} a 186-ton hunting vessel and partook in whaling and acquiring seal oil. He expanded his fleet, importing pork from Tahiti and cedar and coal from Hunter River, sold seal skin in China, and imported tea from Bengal. On the return journey from Bengal he came across a derelict, the Seringapatam. The United States Navy had captured Seringapatam during the War of 1812, but mutineers and prisoners of war had recaptured her. Underwood acted as the crew's agent in claiming salvage from the <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> <b>Vice-Admiralty</b> at Sydney, but the court referred the matter to London. Macquarie eventually requested Captain Eber Bunker to sail Seringapatam to England, where she was returned to her owner. Underwood's other vessels continued to range across vast trading routes, reaching Batavia and Mauritius by the early 1820s.|$|E
50|$|He {{decided to}} stay on in England to improve his {{credentials}} and reputation. In 1773 a gift of elk horns to the Royal Society got him elected as a Fellow.

He then managed to secure the position of judge of the Court of Common Pleas and judge of the <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> <b>Vice-Admiralty</b> in Montreal. He arrived in Quebec {{just prior to the}} American siege of the town in 1775 and was rewarded for his defensive activities in August 1776 with the post of Chief Justice of Quebec and an ex-officio place on the Council. However, a secret letter from Livius to the enemy commander was intercepted and resulted in Livius being deprived of his estates. After further clashes with Governor Guy Carleton he was dismissed from his post by the Governor in 1778.|$|E

The American Department consulted the Solicitor and Attorneys General, who investigated and advised the Privy Council on the legal and constitutional options available. The Crown turned to a centuries-old institution of investigation, the Royal Commission of Inquiry. This commission would be made up of the chiefs <b>of</b> the supreme <b>courts</b> <b>of</b> Massachusetts, New York, and New Jersey, the judge <b>of</b> the <b>vice-admiralty</b> <b>of</b> Boston, and the Governor Joseph Wanton of Rhode Island.
