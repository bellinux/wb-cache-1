5|$|Black's {{contact in}} the Seattle Police Department, Bob Bletcher (Bill Smitrovich), insists that Black should not get {{involved}} in the case as he is too close to the victims. However, Black insists he <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>of</b> assistance, and reviews security footage of a stranger investigating Tom's luggage after their flight. Bletcher reports that a stolen car has been found abandoned, with Helen's blood inside. Fellow Millennium Group member Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) helps Black identify the kidnapper from a set pictures of sex offenders in the Seattle area—Black recognizes Richard Green (Dylan Haggerty) as the man from the airport footage.|$|E
5|$|Busch biographer Joseph Kraus divided {{his work}} into three periods. He points out, however, that this {{classification}} is a simplification, as some works by their nature <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>of</b> a later or earlier period. All three periods show Busch's obsession with German middle class life. His peasants are devoid of sensitivity and village life {{is marked by}} a vivid lack of sentiment.|$|E

5|$|In Tibetan Buddhism, sharabha is {{represented}} as a beast with a goat's head and horns, a lion's mane and horse's body and legs. It symbolizes determination, strength and speed. Sometimes, it {{is represented}} additionally with horns of an antelope and claws of an eagle. Sometimes, the goat head {{is replaced by a}} lion's, horse's feet by a lion's and horns <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>of</b> a ram. A common feature of all representations is the horse's body. It is often depicted as mounts of young Devas or dwarfs in a Torana – a six-level archway behind an enlightenment throne of a Buddha or Boddhisattva. Together with the devas, they symbolize the perfection of effort (virya).|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} stage {{the aim is to}} reduce PD {{symptoms}} while controlling fluctuations in the effect of the medication. Sudden withdrawals from medication or overuse have to be managed. When oral medications are not enough to control symptoms, surgery, deep brain stimulation, subcutaneous waking day apomorphine infusion and enteral dopa pumps <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>of</b> use. The third stage presents many challenging problems requiring a variety of treatments for psychiatric symptoms, orthostatic hypotension, bladder dysfunction, etc. In the final stages of the disease, palliative care is provided to improve quality of life.|$|E

5|$|Intensity of {{precipitation}} is primarily measured for meteorological concerns. However, it <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>of</b> concern to aviation as heavy precipitation can limit visibility. Also, intensity of freezing rain can determine how hazardous {{it is for}} pilots to fly nearby certain locations since {{it can be an}} in-flight hazard by depositing ice on the wings of aircraft, which can be detrimental to flight.|$|E
5|$|Management of {{the site}} {{requires}} moderate grazing {{during the summer and}} autumn to help maintain the species diversity. This is because grazing removes each year's new growth which helps stop the site becoming dominated by vigorously growing grasses. Such grasses would allow a buildup of dead organic matter, which together with the increased growth, would reduce the growth of less vigorous species. The overall effect would be a reduction in species diversity, {{which was one of the}} reasons for the SSSI designation. Trampling <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>of</b> benefit because it breaks up accumulated dead organic matter.|$|E
5|$|Mares <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>of</b> several {{origins and}} be listed as facteur de selle français. Thoroughbred, AQPS, pure or {{crossbred}} Anglo-Arabians and French Trotting horses may also qualify under this designation, as do mares {{that are the}} product of two facteur de selle français horses. Mares belonging to other saddle horse breeds recognized by the European Union (EU) are also listed in this category. Pure and crossbred Arabians, saddle breeds not recognized by the EU and some other mares may be listed on an individual basis by performing at a high level in show jumping, three-day eventing or dressage competition. If mares come from countries or territories that {{do not have access to}} high-level competitions, they may be granted special listing status.|$|E

For {{complete}} spherical {{concentration of}} light the maximum theoretically possible {{total energy density}} for a given power input <b>can</b> <b>be,</b> in principle, achieved by appropriate choice of polarization and angular amplitude variation. Illumination of a focusing system with a plane-polarized wave creates at the focus equal electric and magnetic energy densities. By appropriate choice of radial variation this energy density <b>can</b> <b>be</b> maximized. For hemispherical concentration the electric energy density <b>can</b> <b>be</b> seven sixteenths <b>of</b> the maximum possible for a given power input, and the total energy density <b>can</b> <b>be</b> seven eighths <b>of</b> the maximum possible. Focusing by optical systems satisfying the sine condition amongst others is also considered.

5|$|Diamonds are {{extremely}} hard, but also brittle {{and can be}} split up by a single blow. Therefore, diamond cutting is traditionally considered as a delicate procedure requiring skills, scientific knowledge, tools and experience. Its final goal is to produce a faceted jewel where the specific angles between the facets would optimize the diamond luster, that is dispersion of white light, whereas the number and area of facets would determine {{the weight of the}} final product. The weight reduction upon cutting is significant and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>of</b> the order of 50%. Several possible shapes are considered, but the final decision is often determined not only by scientific, but also practical considerations. For example, the diamond might be intended for display or for wear, in a ring or a necklace, singled or surrounded by other gems of certain color and shape. Some of them may be considered as classical, such as round, pear, marquise, oval, hearts and arrows diamonds, etc. Some of them are special, produced by certain companies, for example, Phoenix, Cushion, Sole Mio diamonds, etc.|$|E
5|$|Injection {{moulding}} {{consists of}} the high pressure injection of the raw material into a mould which shapes the polymer into the desired shape. Moulds <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>of</b> a single cavity or multiple cavities. In multiple cavity moulds, each cavity can be identical and form the same parts or can be unique and form multiple different geometries during a single cycle. Moulds are generally made from tool steels, but stainless steels and aluminium moulds are suitable for certain applications. Aluminium moulds are typically ill-suited for high volume production or parts with narrow dimensional tolerances, as they have inferior mechanical properties and {{are more prone to}} wear, damage, and deformation during the injection and clamping cycles; however, aluminium moulds are cost-effective in low-volume applications, as mould fabrication costs and time are considerably reduced. Many steel moulds are designed to process well over a million parts during their lifetime and can cost {{hundreds of thousands of dollars}} to fabricate.|$|E

5|$|Scaly-tailed {{squirrels}} {{and flying}} squirrels, although not closely related, can both glide {{from tree to}} tree using parachute-like membranes that stretch from the fore to the hind limbs. The agouti is fleet-footed and antelope-like, being digitigrade and having hoof-like nails. The majority of rodents have tails, which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>of</b> many shapes and sizes. Some tails are prehensile, as in the Eurasian harvest mouse, and the fur on the tails can vary from bushy to completely bald. The tail is sometimes used for communication, as when beavers slap their tails on the water surface or house mice rattle their tails to indicate alarm. Some species have vestigial tails or no tails at all. In some species, the tail is capable of regeneration if a part is broken off.|$|E

When the Syndicate suspect {{that one of their}} members is passing {{information}} to Mulder and Scully, they organize a canary trap to find the leak, using information about the safety of Mulder's mother as bait. X's (Steven Williams) role as an informant is discovered, and he is shot dead, although he is able to pass along the name of another informant who <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>of</b> use to Mulder—Marita Covarrubias (Laurie Holden), the Special Representative to the Secretary-General of the United Nations. Covarrubias' aid is sought when Mulder attempts to reach Tunguska in Russia to investigate the source of a further black oil contamination. Whilst there, Mulder is held in a gulag and used as a successful test subject for a black oil vaccine. He escapes and is able to return to America, having found that Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea) is working with the Russians.|$|E
5|$|Transvaginal {{ultrasound}} {{to examine}} the endometrial thickness in women with postmenopausal bleeding is increasingly being used {{to aid in the}} diagnosis of endometrial cancer in the United States. In the United Kingdom, both an endometrial biopsy and a transvaginal ultrasound used in conjunction are the standard of care for diagnosing endometrial cancer. The homogeneity of the tissue visible on transvaginal ultrasound can help to indicate whether the thickness is cancerous. Ultrasound findings alone are not conclusive in cases of endometrial cancer, so another screening method (for example endometrial biopsy) must be used in conjunction. Other imaging studies are of limited use. CT scans are used for preoperative imaging of tumors that appear advanced on physical exam or have a high-risk subtype (at high risk of metastasis). They {{can also be used to}} investigate extrapelvic disease. An MRI <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>of</b> some use in determining if the cancer has spread to the cervix or if it is an endocervical adenocarcinoma. MRI is also useful for examining the nearby lymph nodes.|$|E
