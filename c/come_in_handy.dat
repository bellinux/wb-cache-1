Reportedly, King Philip VI of France wanted to execute Salisbury and Robert Ufford, Earl of Suffolk, who {{was captured}} with him. Philip was, however, dissuaded by John of Bohemia, who argued that the earls could <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>handy</b> in an exchange, should any French noblemen be captured. Though released on parole in September, {{it was not until}} May 1342 that he reached a final settlement with the French. Salisbury was freed in a prisoner exchange, but only on the condition that he never fight in France again.|$|E
25|$|In May 1873, {{with the}} Third Anglo-Ashanti War brewing, he met Wolseley by {{chance in the}} War Office and joked that his naval {{experience}} might <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>handy</b> for West African waterways. On 12 September 1873 he was appointed to Wolseley’s staff for special services. He commanded a flank at the Battle of Amoaful (31 January 1874) where he was wounded. and at the Battle of Esaman. He helped recruit a regiment from among the coastal African tribes, although he wrote of the Fantis that “it {{would be difficult to}} imagine a more cowardly, useless lot of men”. He did, however, discourage British officers from using physical abuse on them.|$|E
25|$|The {{sequence}} of steps {{in which the}} reorganization of chemical bonds may be {{taking place in the}} course of a chemical reaction is called its mechanism. A chemical reaction can be envisioned to take place in a number of steps, each of which may have a different speed. Many reaction intermediates with variable stability can thus be envisaged during the course of a reaction. Reaction mechanisms are proposed to explain the kinetics and the relative product mix of a reaction. Many physical chemists specialize in exploring and proposing the mechanisms of various chemical reactions. Several empirical rules, like the Woodward–Hoffmann rules often <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>handy</b> while proposing a mechanism for a chemical reaction.|$|E

25|$|Policarpa's {{operations}} ran {{smoothly and}} undetected until the Almeyda brothers were apprehended while carrying information {{back to the}} insurgents outside Bogotá. Their information directly linked La Pola to the Revolution. The Almeyda brothers and La Pola were implicated in helping soldiers desert the Royal Army and join the Revolution; transporting weapons, ammunitions and supplies to the insurgents; in helping the Almeydas escape from prison when they were captured in September of the same year, and finding them refuge in Machetá. They had hoped their connection with La Pola could <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>handy</b> {{in the event of}} a revolt in the city. The loyalists now suspected her of treason, but lacked solid evidence to accuse a seamstress of espionage and treason.|$|E
25|$|These rural {{appliances}} {{are extremely}} important for keeping South Australia protected from fires. Almost every town in South Australia would {{have at least}} two of these rural fire trucks. The reason that there are many different types of rural trucks, is because the terrain changes a lot in South Australia. A 14 appliance, only carries 1000 litres nominally but is extremely useful for getting into small tracks which larger appliances can not. Large 34s often have trouble in getting into smaller areas. 24s are the most common, because they are not too heavy and big, but carry a reasonable amount of water, which can last a good time before having to fill up. In most parts of South Australia outside major centres there is no water mains, so this is where Bulk Water Carriers <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>handy.</b> These BWCs, often at a rural fire, will be stationary at the edge of it, for smaller trucks to fill up from. when empty it is their job to go and find water in places including, rivers, dams, swimming pools and water tanks.|$|E
500|$|Adler {{managed to}} {{leverage}} a recommendation from Prince Meshersky and another from Avrom Markovich Brodsky—a businessman so successful {{as to have}} earned the nickname [...] "the Jewish Tsar"—to get {{a job as a}} marketplace inspector for the Department of Weights and Measures, rather unusual for a Jew at that time. His mildly corrupt tenure there gave him good contacts with the police. These would soon <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>handy</b> for smoothing over certain problems of a young and unlicensed theater troupe when Rosenberg and Spivakofsky returned from Romania, penniless because {{the end of the war}} had meant the collapse of Yiddish theater in the provinces, and ready to start a troupe in Odessa.|$|E

In Norway, [...] "trick-or-treat" [...] is called [...] "knask eller knep", which means almost the same thing, although with the word order reversed, and the practice is quite common among children, who come dressed up to people's doors asking for, mainly, candy. Many Norwegians prepare for the event by consciously buying a small stock of sweets prior to it, to <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>handy</b> should any kids come knocking on the door, which is very probable in most areas. The Easter witch tradition is done on Palm Sunday in Finland.|$|E
2500|$|The Communist Party of Canada, {{at least}} in the 1930s and 40s lacked a {{connection}} to the Canadian middle class as well as intellectuals; with his return to Canada, Ryerson would become a symbol of the party's appeal to this segment of society. Ryerson [...] "was not the only traditional intellectual to join the CPC, but {{he was one of the}} first and undoubtedly was to become the most important." [...] The Communist parties of Great Britain and the United States of America, as well as many other nations, could count numerous artists and intellectuals as members from the 1930s on; but in Canada, Ryerson was a lonely figure. His position within the CPC, including his rapid rise in the party hierarchy and his presence on the Central Committee (CC) until 1969, was assured by his unique position; a position that allowed him to play a role within the [...] "political history of Canadian Communism unlike that of his American and British counterparts." [...] He was a middle class school boy from a privileged background in an overwhelmingly proletarian organisation, and as such his presence within the CPC did not always meet with approval. But, his education made him an asset for the party, one that would <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>handy</b> in the years to come.|$|E
