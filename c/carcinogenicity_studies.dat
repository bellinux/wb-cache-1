40|$|There {{is general}} {{agreement}} {{in the scientific community}} on the need to improve carcinogenicity testing and the assessment of human carcinogenic risk and to incorporate more information on mechanisms and modes of action into the risk assessment process. Advances in molecular biology have identified a growing number of genes such as protooncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes that are highly conserved across species and are associated {{with a wide variety of}} human and animal cancers. In vivo transgenic rodent models incorporating such mechanisms are used to identify mechanisms involved in tumor formation and as selective tests for carcinogens. Transgenic methods can be considered an extension of genetic manipulation by selective breeding, which long has been employed in science and agriculture. The use of two rodent species in carcinogenicity testing is especially important for identifying transspecies carcinogens. The capacity of a substance to induce neoplasia across species suggests that the mechanism(s) involved in the induction of the neoplasia are conserved and therefore may have significance for humans. Based on available information there is sufficient experience with some in vivo transgenic rodent carcinogenicity models to support their application as complementary second species studies in conjunction with a single 2 -year rodent <b>carcinogenicity</b> <b>study.</b> The optional substitution of a second 2 -year rodent <b>carcinogenicity</b> <b>study</b> with an alternative study such as an in vivo transgenic <b>carcinogenicity</b> <b>study</b> is part of the International Conference on Harmonization guidance S 1 B: Testing for Carcinogenicity of Pharmaceuticals. This guidance is intended to be flexible enough to accommodate a wide range of possible carcinogenicity assessment models currently under consideration or models that may be developed in the future. The use of an in vivo transgenic mouse model in place of a second 2 -year mouse study will improve the assessment of carcinogenic risk by contributing insights into the mechanisms of tumorigenesis and potential human relevance not available from a standard 2 -year bioassay. It is envisioned that this will stimulate the further development of more efficient and relevant methods for identifying and assessing potential human carcinogenic risk, which will benefit public health...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{discovery}} of the excellent features of MWCNT, there has been an increase in potential applications, {{despite the fact that they}} have been discussed to have a toxic potential depending on their length and fiber-like shape. For this reason, potential adverse biological effects of MWCNT have been investigated in vivo (rat) in a project funded by the German BMBF (contract No. 03 X 0109 A). Tailor-made MWCNT with different lengths and diameters were produced, suspended in artificial lung medium and injected intraperitoneally in rats in two dose groups (low: 1 x 109 WHO fibers; high: 5 x 109 WHO fibers) in a BrdU screening test (MWCNT 1, 2, 3) and a <b>carcinogenicity</b> <b>study</b> (MWCNT 1, 2, 3, 3 a). Long amosite asbestos (0. 1 x 109 WHO fibers) served as positive control, ground MWCNT and Printex 90 (5 mg/rat) as negative control. Suspension and length/ diameter distribution were measured in SEM. Proliferation of cells in the diaphragmatic peritoneum was investigated as a shorttime screening test 3 and 6 months after i. p. injection of fibers in rats, using the BrdU method and measurement of peritoneal thickness. Furthermore, animal mortality and tumor development were monitored over two years in a <b>carcinogenicity</b> <b>study.</b> There was a time-independent significant increase in cell proliferation after injection of MWCNT 1 (high) (L= 7. 9 m; D= 0. 037 m), MWCNT 2 (low/high) (L= 10. 24 m; D= 0. 04 m), and MWCNT 3 (low/high) (L= 8. 57 m; D= 0. 085 m), like after exposure to long amosite asbestos (L= 13. 95 m; D= 0. 39 m) as positive control. MWCNT 2 (high) and 3 (low/high) induced significant dose-dependent thickening of the peritoneum after i. p. injection, independently of time. In the <b>carcinogenicity</b> <b>study,</b> MWCNT 2, 3 and 3 a (L= 9. 3 m; D= 0. 062 m) showed a higher mesothelioma incidence than MWCNT 1. In conclusion, some MWCNT (MWCNT 2, 3) mediate enhanced proliferation of peritoneal cells in the diaphragm in rats, which may result in mesothelioma development...|$|R

5000|$|Many {{said that}} Séralini's {{conclusions}} were impossible to justify given the statistical {{power of the}} study. Sprague-Dawley rats have a lifespan of about two years and have {{a high risk of}} cancer over their lifespan (one study concluded that over eighty percent of males and over seventy percent of females developed cancer under normal conditions). The Séralini experiment covered the normal lifespan of these rats. The longer an experiment continues, the more rats get cancer naturally, that makes it harder to separate statistical [...] "noise" [...] from the hypothetical signal. For the study to achieve such separation (statistical power), each control and test group would have to include sufficiently many subjects.

40|$|The {{consumption}} {{of fish and}} nitrate-rich vegetables {{may lead to the}} formation of the genotoxic carcinogen N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) in the stomach. To assess human cancer risk associated with this formation, a dynamic in vitro gastrointestinal model was used to simulate NDMA formation in the stomach after a fish + vegetable meal. The experimental results were combined with statistical modeling of Dutch food consumption data resulting in predicted exposures to endogenously formed NDMA in the population. The 95 th percentile of the long-term exposure distribution was around 4 ng/kg-bw in young children and 0. 4 ng/kg-bw in adults. By comparing this exposure with the Benchmark Dose Lower bound (BMDL) 10 for liver cancer in a chronic <b>carcinogenicity</b> <b>study,</b> a chronic margin of exposure (MOE) was calculated of 7000 and 73, 000 for young children and adults. Furthermore, the long-term exposure distribution was combined with a dose-response analysis of the liver cancer incidence data to obtain a cancer risk distribution for the human population. The 95 th percentile of that distribution was 6 x 10 (- 6) extra risk for 5 -year-old children and 8 x 10 (- 7) for adults. The liver cancer data allowed for the analysis of the relationship between tumor incidence and time to tumor. For an extra risk of 10 (- 6), the decrease in time to tumor was conservatively estimated at 3. 8 min in the rat, equivalent to 0. 1 days in humans. We also combined acute exposure estimates with the BMDL 10 from an acute <b>carcinogenicity</b> <b>study</b> for NDMA, resulting in an acute MOE of 110, 000.
