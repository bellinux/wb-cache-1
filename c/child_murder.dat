5|$|Eastwood {{composed}} Changelings jazz-influenced score. Featuring lilting {{guitars and}} strings, it remains largely low-key throughout. The introduction of brass instruments evokes film noir, {{playing to the}} film's setting in a city controlled by corrupt police. The theme shifts from piano to a full orchestra, and as the story develops, the strings become more imposing, with {{an increasing number of}} sustains and rises. Eastwood introduces voices reminiscent of those in a horror film score during the <b>child</b> <b>murder</b> flashbacks. The score was orchestrated and conducted by Lennie Niehaus. It was released on CD in North America on , 2008, through record label Varèse Sarabande.|$|E
5|$|Early modern Scotland was a {{theoretically}} patriarchal society, {{in which}} men had total authority over women, but how this worked is practice is difficult to discern. Marriages, particularly higher in society, were often political in nature {{and the subject of}} complex negotiations over the tocher (dowry). Some mothers took a leading role in negotiating and finding marriages, as Lady Glenorchy did for her children in the 1560s and 1570s, or as matchmakers, finding suitable and compatible partners. Before the Reformation, the extensive marriage bars for kinship meant that most marriages necessitated a papal dispensation, which could later be used as grounds for annulment if the marriage proved politically or personally inconvenient. At the beginning of the period, women had a very limited legal status. The criminal courts refused to recognise them as witnesses or independent criminals, and responsibly for their actions was assumed to lie with their husbands, fathers and kin. In the post-Reformation period there was a criminalisation of women, partly evident in witchcraft prosecutions from 1563. Through the 1640s, independent commissions were set up to try women for <b>child</b> <b>murder,</b> and after pressure from the kirk a law of 1690 placed the presumption of guilt on a woman if she concealed a pregnancy and birth, and her child later died.|$|E

5|$|The Jewish {{community}} {{played an}} important role in England throughout much of the period. The first Jews arrived in England in the aftermath of the Norman invasion, when William the Conqueror brought over wealthy members of the Rouen community in Normandy to settle in London. The Jewish community expanded out across England and provided essential money-lending and banking services that were otherwise banned by the usury laws. During the 12th century, the Jewish financial community grew richer still, operating under royal protection and providing the king with a source of ready credit. All major towns had Jewish centres, and even the smaller towns saw visits by travelling Jewish merchants. Towards the end of Henry II's reign, however, the king ceased to borrow from the Jewish community and instead turned to extracting money from them through arbitrary taxation and fines. The Jews became vilified and accusations were made that they conducted ritual <b>child</b> <b>murder,</b> encouraging the pogroms carried out against Jewish communities in the reign of Richard I. After an initially peaceful start to John's reign, the king again began to extort money from the Jewish community and, with the breakdown in order in 1215, the Jews were subject to fresh attacks. HenryIII restored some protection and Jewish money-lending began to recover. Despite this, the Jewish community became increasingly impoverished and was finally expelled from England in 1290 by EdwardI, being replaced by foreign merchants.|$|E

However, respondents only favoured capital punishment for adult murder, the polling question asked by other organisations such as Gallup, by small majorities or pluralities: overall, 51% favoured the death penalty for adult murder, while 56% in Wales did, 55% in Scotland, and only 49% in England.|$|E
25|$|The {{murder of}} Mona Tinsley is a British <b>child</b> <b>murder</b> case from 1937. On 5 January 1937, 10-year-old Mona Lilian Tinsley {{disappeared}} after leaving her Newark-on-Trent school. A former lodger of Mona's parents, Frederick Nodder, became {{the prime suspect}} in her abduction. However, despite the fact both strong physical and circumstantial evidence existed attesting to his guilt, because no body could be found, Nodder could not be tried for her murder, but was instead convicted of Mona's abduction and sentenced to seven years in gaol.|$|E

25|$|The second {{series of}} the British crime drama Broadchurch began airing on the ITV {{broadcast}} network in the United Kingdom on 5 January 2015. The eight-episode series focused on the continuing fallout {{of the murder of}} 11-year-old Danny Latimer in the fictional, close-knit coastal town of Broadchurch in Dorset, England. The series focused on the effect of Joe Miller's trial on his wife, former DS Ellie Miller (now a uniformed police officer in Devon); the Latimer family's struggle to achieve a normal life during Joe's trial; and new revelations that former DI Alec Hardy is protecting a witness in the failed Sandbrook <b>child</b> <b>murder</b> case.|$|E
25|$|In September 2008, the Swedish media {{reported}} that the public preliminary investigation protocols concerning a <b>child</b> <b>murder</b> case known as the Arboga case had been made available through a torrent on The Pirate Bay. In Sweden, preliminary investigations become publicly available the moment a lawsuit is filed and can be ordered from the court by any individual. The document included pictures from the autopsy of the two murdered children, which caused their father Nicklas Jangestig to urge the website to have the pictures removed. The Pirate Bay refused to remove the torrent. The number of downloads increased to about 50,000 a few days later. On 11 September 2008, the website's press contact Peter Sunde participated in the debate program Debatt on the public broadcaster SVT. Sunde had agreed to participate {{on the condition that}} the father Nicklas Jangestig would not take part in the debate. Jangestig ultimately did participate in the program by telephone, which made Sunde feel betrayed by SVT. This caused The Pirate Bay to suspend all of its press contacts the following day.|$|E

500|$|In 1975 Pina Bausch, who {{had taken}} over the Wuppertal ballet company, caused a stir in the ballet world with her stark depiction, played out on an earth-covered stage, in which the Chosen One is sacrificed to gratify the {{misogyny}} of the surrounding men. At the end, according to The Guardians Luke Jennings, [...] "the cast is sweat-streaked, filthy and audibly panting". Part of this dance appears in the movie Pina. In America, in 1980, Paul Taylor used Stravinsky's four-hand piano version of the score as the background for a scenario based on <b>child</b> <b>murder</b> and gangster film images. In February 1984 Martha Graham, in her 90th year, resumed her association with The Rite by choreographing a new production at New York's State Theater. The New York Times critic declared the performance [...] "a triumph... totally elemental, as primal in expression of basic emotion as any tribal ceremony, as hauntingly staged in its deliberate bleakness as it is rich in implication".|$|E
500|$|Gjems-Onstad made news in 2008 {{when he had}} {{talks with}} the {{disturbed}} man who fired a gun towards a refugee centre. He was also involved in an heritage distribution controversy. In her will, millionaire Clara Westin declared that [...] be given to anti-immigration activists, and that the distribution be decided by a board consisting of four people. Egil Karlsen backed out and gave up his vote to Gjems-Onstad, {{and the other three}} were Gjems-Onstad, Norvald Aasen of Folkebevegelsen mot innvandring and Bjarne Pettersen. It surfaced that suggestions by board members included the mother of <b>child</b> <b>murder</b> convict Ole Nicolai Kvisler. While the background for involving Kvisler was his anti-immigration views, the pressing issue was the matter of his court ruling. Having followed the case closely as a former lawyer, Gjems-Onstad had disputed the court ruling as he believed there was not evidence to conclude that Kvisler had any more than possibly a subsidiary role in the murder; he thus explained the suggestion with providing funds for reopening his case. Gjems-Onstad maintained that it was only the other convict, Joe Erling Jahr, who had committed the murder. Pettersen had in addition wanted to distribute money to people from his circle around Vigrid (a group Gjems-Onstad loathed), such as Tore Tvedt and Øyvind Heian, but was squeezed out of the board after this was opposed by Gjems-Onstad and Aasen. The left-wing anti-racist organization SOS Rasisme petitioned the Norwegian state to confiscate Gjems-Onstad's war decorations, but to no avail. After all disputes were resolved, it was not made public who actually received any money.|$|E
500|$|In the post-Reformation period {{there was}} a {{criminalisation}} of women. Women were disciplined in kirk sessions and civil courts for stereotypical offenses including scolding and prostitution, which were seen as deviant, rather than criminal. Through the 1640s there were independent commissions set up to try women for <b>child</b> <b>murder</b> and, after pressure from the kirk, a law of 1690 placed the presumption of guilt on a woman who concealed a pregnancy and birth and whose child later died. In {{the aftermath of the}} initial Reformation settlement, Parliament passed the Witchcraft Act 1563, similar to that passed in England one year earlier, which made the practice of witchcraft itself and consulting with witches capital crimes. Between the passing of the act and its repeal in 1736, an estimated 6,000 persons were tried for witchcraft in Scotland. Most of the accused, some 75 per cent, were women, with over 1,500 executed, and the witch hunt in Scotland has been seen as a means of controlling women. Various reasons for the Scottish witch-hunt, and its more intense nature than that in England, have been advanced by historians. Many of the major periods of prosecution coincided with periods of intense economic distress and some accusations may have followed the withdrawal of charity from marginal figures, particularly the single women that made up many of the accused. Changing attitudes to women, particularly in the reformed kirk, which may have perceived women as more of a moral threat, have also been noted. The proliferation of partial explanations for the witch hunt has led some historians to proffer the concept of [...] "associated circumstances", rather than one single significant cause.|$|E
