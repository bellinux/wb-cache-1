Sulforaphane, a phytochemical constituent of cruciferous vegetables, has received much attention as a potential cancer <b>chemopreventive</b> <b>compound.</b> Recent advances in the cellular and molecular biology of cancer have shed light on components of intracellular signaling cascades that can be molecular targets of chemoprevention by various anti-cancer agents. Metallothionein (MT), a primary antioxidant enzyme involved in the metabolism and detoxification of heavy metal, has been recognized as a molecular target for chemoprevention by natural anti-cancer agents, but the cellular signaling mechanisms that associate MT gene regulation are not yet clearly understood. Recent studies suggest that Nrf 2 -mediated signaling, which controls the expression of many of genes responsible for carcinogen detoxification and protection against oxidative stress, is regulated by sulforaphane. This contribution focuses on Nrf 2 -mediated signaling pathways, particularly in relation to MT gene induction and the apoptosis-inducing effects of sulforaphane. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Prague 2010 Introduction 1 Introduction According to the World Health Organization statistics, {{cancer is}} one of the leading causes of death in the human population worldwide for more than 50 years. Moreover, colorectal and gastrointestinal tract cancers are one of the main types of cancer leading to overall cancer mortality. Prevention consisting in a healthy lifestyle and a natural diet is suggested to be one of the main approaches to reduce cancer risk. In recent years, the consumption and use of dietary supplements containing concentrated chemopreventive phytochemicals increased dramatically. Flavonoids, as the most popular representatives of <b>chemopreventive</b> <b>compounds,</b> present in foods (fruits, vegetables, herbs, beverages) and dietary supplements have the potential to modulate the activity of xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes [Hodek et al., 2002]. Among proteins interacting with flavonoids, cytochrome P 450 s (CYPs), monooxygenases metabolizing xenobiotics (e. g. drugs, carcinogens), play the most prominent role.

A large group of <b>chemopreventive</b> <b>compounds</b> are represented by flavonoids contained in many dietary supplements. One of the representatives of this group is dihydromyricetin, which is attributed to positive impact on human organism, in particular by its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and hepatoprotective effects. Some flavonoids can act as modulators of enzymes of phase I and phase II metabolism of xenobiotics biotransformation by their inhibition or induction which can causean interference with endogenous metabolism.

The current study aimed to identify molecular alterations in the normal mucosa in the proximity of adenomatous polyps and to assess the modulating effect of butyrate, a <b>chemopreventive</b> <b>compound</b> produced by fermentation of dietary residues. Methods A cross-sectional study was undertaken in patients with adenomatous polyps: biopsy samples were taken from the adenoma, and from macroscopically normal mucosa on the contralateral wall to the adenoma and from the mid-sigmoid colon. In normal subjects biopsies were taken from the mid-sigmoid colon. Biopsies were frozen for proteomic analysis or formalin-fixed for immunohistochemistry. Proteomic analysis was undertaken using iTRAQ workflows followed by bioinformatics analyses. A second dietary fibre intervention study arm used the same endpoints and sampling strategy {{at the beginning and end}} of a high-fibre intervention. Results Key findings were that keratins 8, 18 and 19 were reduced in expression level with progressive proximity to the lesion. Lesional tissue exhibited multiple K 8 immunoreactive bands and overall reduced levels of keratin. Biopsies from normal subjects with low faecal butyrate also showed depressed keratin expression.

Using natural compounds to subvert the detrimental effects of arsenic represents an attractive strategy. The transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2 -related factor 2 (Nrf 2) is a critical regulator of the cellular antioxidant response and xenobiotic metabolism. Recently, activation of the Nrf 2 signaling pathway {{has been reported to}} confer protection against arsenic-induced toxicity in a cell culture model. OBJECTIVES: The goal of the present work was to identify a potent Nrf 2 activator from plants as a <b>chemopreventive</b> <b>compound</b> and to demonstrate the efficacy of the compound in battling arsenicinduced toxicity. RESULTS: Oridonin activated the Nrf 2 signaling pathway at a low subtoxic dose and was able to stabilize Nrf 2 by blocking Nrf 2 ubiquitination and degradation, leading to accumulation of the Nrf 2 protein and activation of the Nrf 2 -dependent cytoprotective response. Pretreatment of UROtsa cells with 1. 4 µM oridonin significantly enhanced the cellular redox capacity, reduced formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and improved cell survival after arsenic challenge. CONCLUSIONS: We identified oridonin as representing a novel class of Nrf 2 activators and illustrated the mechanism by which the Nrf 2 pathway is activated. Furthermore, we demonstrated the feasibility of using natural compounds targeting Nrf 2 as a therapeutic approach to protect humans from various environmental insults that may occur daily...|$|E

Two different types of animal models were utilized to determine the efficacy of combinational treatment of common antineoplastic drugs and the new class of primaquines that act as gap junction enhancers (PQs) at attenuating mammary tumor growth. The classic xenograft mouse model was used to show that PQs could increase the efficacy of cisplatin and paclitaxel. Combinational treatment induced an upregulation of connexin and caspase expression in the isolated tumor. Next the transgenic PyVT mouse model was characterized by multiple factors, including hormone receptor status, molecular markers for survival and proliferation, tissue histopathology, and secondary metastases during multiple stages of tumor development. This model showed limited therapeutic response to the antineoplastic drugs tested. PQ 1 effectively attenuated tumor growth at all stages of tumorigenesis in the PyVT model, while PQ 7 was determined to be an effective <b>chemopreventive</b> <b>compound</b> rather than chemotherapeutic. The PQs altered the expression profiles of connexins during tumorigenesis. Together the results indicate that PQs have an anticancer effect that is more efficient at attenuating tumor growth than the common antineoplastic compounds. Lastly the PyVT mouse model was used to determine the efficacy of antineoplastic compounds on male mammary carcinoma development. Interestingly, the antineoplastic compound that attenuated female mammary carcinoma growth did not produce a therapeutic response in the males and vice versa, suggesting a need for further studies into the male response to therapy...|$|E
40|$|The use of food {{supplements}} containing natural <b>chemopreventive</b> <b>compounds</b> increased in recent years. Some {{of the most}} popular <b>chemopreventive</b> <b>compounds</b> are flavonoids. Due to their natural origin, flavonoids are generally accepted as safe compounds. They exert antioxidant, anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory properties. However, flavonoids should be considered as foreign compounds (xenobiotics). Flavonoids interact with many enzymes, among the most important belong cytochromes P 450 (CYPs), key enzymes of the first phase of biotransformation of xenobiotics (e. g. drugs, carcinogens). CYPs catalyze reactions leading mainly to detoxification of xenobiotics. However, some CYPs are involved in the activation of carcinogens, particularly CYP 1 A 1 and CYP 1 A 2 activate e. g. heterocyclic amines. Flavonoids might enhance the activation of carcinogens via induction of these CYPs or stimulation of their activities and hence, increase the risk of a cancer development. The thesis is focused on the influence of flavonoids and food carcinogens on the induction and activity of CYP 1 A 1 and CYP 1 A 2 in liver and small intestine of rats.

Thus, studying {{of the effect of}} the <b>chemopreventive</b> <b>compounds</b> on cytochromes P 450 induction and cancer development is of a high clinical importance. The CYPs are most commonly found in the liver. However, there are forms that have not been detected in any human healthy tissue but their overexpression was observed in tumors.

Therefore, it would be opportune to have some tools for these enzyme detection. One option is immunodetection of cytochromes P 450 by Western blot using the specific antibodies. Today mammalian antibodies (IgG) are the most widely used but antibodies isolated from egg yolk (IgY) become popular mainly due to the large number of undisputed advantages.

40|$|Dyshomeostasis of {{transition}} metals iron and copper {{as well as}} accumulation of oxidative DNA damage have been implicated in multitude of human neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer disease and Parkinson disease. These metals oxidize DNA bases by generating reactive oxygen species. Most oxidized bases in mammalian genomes are repaired via the base excision repair pathway, initiated with one of four major DNA glycosylases: NTH 1 or OGG 1 (of the Nth family) or NEIL 1 or NEIL 2 (of the Nei family). Here we show that Fe(II/III) and Cu(II) at physiological levels bind to NEIL 1 and NEIL 2 to alter their secondary structure and strongly inhibit repair of mutagenic 5 -hydroxyuracil, a common cytosine oxidation product, both in vitro and in neuroblastoma (SH-SY 5 Y) cell extract by affecting the base excision and AP lyase activities of NEILs. The specificity of iron/copper inhibition of NEILs is indicated {{by a lack of}} similar inhibition of OGG 1, which also indicated that the inhibition is due to metal binding to the enzymes and not DNA. Fluorescence and surface plasmon resonance studies show submicromolar binding of copper/iron to NEILs but not OGG 1. Furthermore, Fe(II) inhibits the interaction of NEIL 1 with downstream base excision repair proteins DNA polymerase β and flap endonuclease- 1 by 4 – 6 -fold. These results indicate that iron/copper overload in the neurodegenerative diseases could act as a double-edged sword by both increasing oxidative genome damage and preventing their repair. Interestingly, specific chelators, including the natural <b>chemopreventive</b> <b>compound</b> curcumin, reverse the inhibition of NEILs both in vitro and in cells, suggesting their therapeutic potential...|$|E
40|$|Abstract 				 				 					 						Background 					 					Osteosarcoma (OS) is {{the most}} common primary bone {{malignancy}} with a high propensity for local invasion and distant metastasis. Limited by the severe toxicity of conventional agents, the therapeutic bottleneck of osteosarcoma still remains unconquered. Flavokawain B (FKB), a kava extract, has been reported to have significant anti-tumor effects on several carcinoma cell lines both in vitro and in vivo. Its efficacy and low toxicity profile make FKB a promising agent for use as a novel chemotherapeutic agent. 				 				 					 						Results 					 					In the current study, we investigated the anti-proliferative and apoptotic effects of FKB against human osteosarcomas. Exposure of OS cells to FKB resulted in apoptosis, evidenced by loss of cell viability, morphological changes and the externalization of phosphatidylserine. Apoptosis induced by FKB resulted in activation of Caspase- 3 / 7, - 8 and &# 8722; 9 in OS cell lines, 143 B and Saos- 2. FKB also down-regulated inhibitory apoptotic markers, including Bcl- 2 and Survivin and led to concomitant increases in apoptotic proteins, Bax, Puma and Fas. Therefore, the induction of apoptosis by FKB involved both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. FKB also caused G 2 /M phase cell cycle arrest, which was observed through reductions in the levels of cyclin B 1, cdc 2 and cdc 25 c and increases in Myt 1 levels. Furthermore, migration and invasion ability was decreased by FKB in a dose-dependent manner. The cytotoxicity profile showed FKB had significant lower side effects on bone marrow cells and small intestinal epithelial cells compared with Adriamycin. 				 				 					 						Conclusions 					 					Taken together, our evidence of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest by FKB treatment with less toxicity than the standard treatments provides an innovative argument for the use of FKB as a chemotherapeutic and <b>chemopreventive</b> <b>compound.</b> In vivo experiments utilizing FKB to reduce tumorigenesis and metastatic potential will be crucial to further justify clinical application...|$|E

Signalling pathways, linking these events were investigated in detail. I 3 C modulated tyrosine phosphorylation from 30 min in four cell lines. In MDA-MB- 468 and HBL 100 cells, it induced Src activation after 5 h. In MDA-MB- 468 cells, I 3 C induced signalling between 4. 5 and 7 h, which involved sequential activation of Src, EGFR, STAT- 1 and STAT- 3, followed by EGFR degradation. It also induced physical association between activated Src and EGFR. In MCF 7 and MDA-MB- 231 cells, I 3 C modulated expression of cell cycle-related proteins, p 21 Cip 1, p 27 Kip 1, cyclin E, cyclin D 1 and CDK 6, with upregulation of p 21 Cip 1 and cyclin E being dependent on Src. Inhibition of EGFR by specific inhibitors PD 153035 or ZD 1839 increased susceptibility to I 3 C-induced apoptosis of MCF 7, MDA-MB- 468 and MDA-MB- 231 cells. Inhibition of Src sensitized MDA-MB- 468 and MDA-MB- 231 cells to I 3 C, whereas overexpression of c-Src increased resistance to I 3 C in MDA-MB- 468 and HBL 100 cells. Modulation of Src in MDA-MB- 468 cells influenced the basal level of EGFR expression and cell viability; the latter being positively correlated with EGFR activation levels. Therefore, EGFR and Src activities are essential for I 3 C-induced cell cycle arrest and death; however, I 3 C-induced pathways depend on specific features of breast cancer cells. The cancer types, which rely on ‘EGFR addiction’ or Src deregulation, {{are likely to be}} susceptible to I 3 C. Peer reviewedPost prin...|$|E

40|$|Introduction – Beta vulgaris var. cicla (BV) leaves contain chemopreventive {{compounds}} {{that have been}} investigated for new drug discovery. These compounds belong {{to the family of}} the apigenin-glycosides. Since the leaves are seasonal products containing high percentages of water, they are easily degradable during storage in fresh conditions. To be stored they require a drying process, consuming time and a large amount of energy. The extraction of apigenin-glycosides may also be conveniently performed from BV seeds, which represent a stable and year-long available biomass. Objectives – The present reportwas undertaken to find a strategy of purification of bioactive flavonoids fromBV seeds and test their ability to inhibit proliferation both on human colon cancer (RKO) cells and normal human fibroblasts (HF). Materials and methods – The ethyl-acetate extract of BV seedswas fractionated on a Sephadex LH 20 column. A fraction of this extract, labeled as P 4, exploited amarked antiproliferative activity on RKOcells. The components of P 4 were purified on an RP 18 column chromatography and identified by HPLC-ESI-MS as 2, 4, 5 -trihydroxybenzaldehyde, 2, 5 -dihydroxybenzaldehyde, vanillic acid, xylosylvitexin, glucopyranosyl-glucopyrasyl-rhamnetin and glucopyranosyl-xylosyl-rhamnetin. All of them were tested for cytostatic and cytotoxic activity on RKO and HF cells. Results – Xylosylvitexin exhibited the strongest antiproliferative activity on RKO cells, together with an enhancement of the apoptosis, an increase of cells in the G 1 phase and a reduction of cells in the S phase; on the contrary, the proliferation of HFwas significantly stimulated.

This study systematically investigated the preparation, characterization, {{and application of}} protein-based nanoparticles as effective nutraceutical/drug carriers. Soy protein, {{one of the most}} widely utilized proteins, was firstly employed for preparing nanoparticles. The particle formation involved partial unfolding of protein molecules, limited aggregation in the presence of the antisolvent, crosslinking via chemical bonds, and refolding of the constituent monomers. Satisfactory encapsulation efficiency (EE) and time-dependent release of curcumin, a <b>chemopreventive</b> <b>compound,</b> were observed. The nanoparticles were further subjected to conjugation with folic acid, a cancer cell-targeting ligand. A pronounced increase in the accumulation in tumor cells such as Caco- 2 was achieved upon folic acid conjugation, which demonstrated the potential of this technique for the targeted delivery of anti-cancer drugs. To overcome the rapid digestion of soy protein nanoparticles in the gastrointestinal tract, carboxymethyl chitosan was employed as a second coating layer by a simple ionic gelation method. The formed particles exhibited satisfactory EE for vitamin D 3 and controlled releasing profile in vitro. Beta lactoglobulin (BLG) as another protein of interest is a major component of whey protein, serving as a natural carrier for lipophilic nutrients. Our study suggested that the interaction between BLG and curcumin could be promoted by tuning the antisolvent content. A loading capacity (LC) and EE of up to 11 % and 98 % respectively could be achieved under the optimal conditions. Moreover, nanoparticles prepared with cationic beta-lactoglobulin (CBLG) were able to transport most of the encapsulated drug intact through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract owing to its desirable particle integrity. Other advantages of CBLG-based systems included superior mucoadhesion, permeation across the small intestine epithelia, and cellular uptake. Finally, as CBLG molecules/nanoparticles absorbed the negatively charged serum proteins in the cell culturing medium, their surface properties, cytotoxicity, and cellular uptake were significantly altered. This series of studies not only demonstrated the efficiency and versatility of protein-based nanoparticles as bioavailability enhancers but also shed some light on the mechanisms for the encapsulation, transport, and delivery of nutraceuticals or drugs...|$|E

The final published version is available on www. springerlink. com, DOI: 10. 1007 /s 10549 - 007 - 9669 - 6 Indole- 3 -carbinol (I 3 C), a dietary <b>chemopreventive</b> <b>compound,</b> induces cell death in human breast cancer cells by modulating activities of Src and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). The effect of I 3 C on NF-κB, constitutively activated in breast cancer cells, was investigated. Nuclear extracts of MDA-MB- 468, MDA-MB- 231 and HBL 100 cells contained all of the Rel proteins with similar expression patterns in the latter two. The level of NF-κB-regulated reporter gene expression was in the order HBL 100 << MDA-MB- 468 << MDA-MB- 231. Upstream inhibition, using PI 3 K, EGFR or IKKβ inhibitors, resulted in cell-specific effects on expression of the NF-κB-regulated reporter gene and endogenous genes Bcl-xL, IκBα and IL- 6, {{as well as on}} cell viability. The expression patterns of Rel and several NF-κB-regulated genes and the response to LY 249002 in MDA-MB- 468 cells contrasted with those in other cells. I 3 C induced NF-κB-regulated reporter gene expression at 12 h in MDA-MB- 468 cells. Conversely, it was reduced at 24 h in HBL 100 cells. I 3 C treatment for 6 h alone or in combination with TNFα induced NF-κB-regulated reporter gene expression, detected 5 h later, in MDA-MB- 468, but not HBL 100 cells. I 3 C induced NF-κB p 65 /p 50 DNA binding at 6. 5 h, preceded by association of IKKβ with the Src/EGFR complex and increased phospho-IκBα in MDA-MB 468 cells. TNFα increased I 3 C-induced apoptosis in MDA-MB- 468 and MDA-MB- 231 cells. It also induced apoptosis, enhanced by I 3 C, in HBL 100 cells. Hence, regulation of constitutive NF-κB was cell-specific. I 3 C influenced the NF-κB pathway in a cell-specific manner, which was not related to apoptosis. However, the combination of I 3 C and TNFα increased apoptosis in all cell lines...|$|E
30|$|Identification of obacunone as a novel Nrf 2 {{activator}} broadens {{the choice}} for new <b>chemopreventive</b> <b>compounds</b> against tissue damage or disease caused by various environmental insults. Compared with other small molecule Nrf 2 activators, obacunone {{is a natural}} product with an advantage in its safety. In support of this notion, obacunone exhibits no apparent cytotoxicity in vitro and in vivo for the limited time duration tested (Fig. S 3). Taken together, our experiments demonstrate the feasibility of preventing bleomycin-induced lung injury by systemic administration of obacunone, a novel potent Nrf 2 activator. The obacunone-mediated intervention may also be efficacious for other types of environmental insults and confer protection against tissue damage in other organs.|$|R
40|$|Various <b>chemopreventive</b> <b>compounds</b> alter gene expression, {{possibly}} explaining {{their biological}} activity. One gene induced {{by a variety}} of <b>chemopreventive</b> <b>compounds</b> is the one coding for the transcription factor activating transcription factor 3 (ATF 3). In this study, we performed microarray analysis on mRNA isolated from human colorectal cancer cells overexpressing ATF 3 to ascertain the biological activity of this gene in cancer. As a result, 64 genes were induced or repressed. One gene identified by microarray analysis as repressed by overexpression of ATF 3 was inhibitor of DNA binding/differentiation- 1 (Id 1). Id 1 is important to cell growth and proliferation and therefore may represent an important downstream target of ATF 3 responsible for the biological activity of ATF 3. Id 1 interacts with ATF 3, thereby sequestering its activity, making it an ideal candidate for further study. The induction of ATF 3 and repression of Id 1 in these cells were confirmed at the mRNA and protein levels by semiquantitative real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis, respectively. To determine if the repression of Id 1 seen following microarray analysis of these cells occurred following treatment with dietary compounds with known chemotherapeutic activity, human colorectal cancer cells were treated with resveratrol and genistein, and their expression was determined. As a result, ATF 3 was induced, and Id 1 was repressed, by these compounds and by sulindac sulfide, a positive control, at the mRNA and protein level. Further work is needed to determine the molecular mechanism(s) responsible for the regulation of Id 1 and to determine if biological activity of ATF 3 overexpression is mediated by repression of Id 1 by these compounds...|$|R

Research on functional foods is addressing the physiologic effects and health benefits of foods and food components, with the aim of authorizing specific health claims. The recognition that oxidative stress {{plays a major role in}} the pathophysiology of cardiac disorders has led to extensive investigations of the protective effects of exogenous antioxidants, but results are controversial. A promising strategy for protecting cardiac cells against oxidative damage may be through the induction of endogenous phase 2 enzymes with the enhancement of cellular antioxidant capacity. Sulforaphane (SF), a naturally occurring isothiocyanate abundant in Cruciferous vegetables, has gained attention as a potential <b>chemopreventive</b> <b>compound</b> thanks to its ability to induce several classes of genes implicated in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and electrophiles detoxification. Antioxidant responsive element (ARE) -mediated gene induction is a pivotal mechanism of cellular defence against the toxicity of electrophiles and ROS. The transcription factor NF-E 2 -related factor- 2 (Nrf 2), is essential for the up-regulation of these genes. We investigated whether SF could exert cardioprotective effects against oxidative stress and elucidated the mechanisms underpinning these effects. Accordingly, using cultured rat neonatal cardiomyocytes as a model system, we evaluated the time-dependent induction of gene transcription, the corresponding protein expression and activity of various antioxidant and phase 2 enzymes (catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione and related enzymes glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione S-transferase, NAD(P) H: quinone oxidoreductase 1 and thioredoxine reductase) elicited by SF. The results were correlated to intracellular ROS production and cell viability after oxidative stress generated by H 2 O 2, and confirmed the ability of SF to exert cytoprotective effects acting as an indirect antioxidant. Furthermore, to get better insight into SF mechanism of action, we investigated the effect of SF treatment on Nrf 2 and the upstream signalling pathways MAPK ERK 1 / 2 and PI 3 K/Akt, known to mediate a pro survival signal in the heart. The use of specific inhibitors of ERK 1 / 2 and Akt phosphorylation demonstrated their involvement in phase 2 enzymes induction. The concentration of SF tested in this study is comparable to peak plasma concentration achieved after dietary exposure giving clear relevance to our data to support dietary intake of Cruciferous vegetables in cytoprotection against oxidative stress, a common determinant of many cardiovascular diseases. ...|$|E
40|$|Keap 1 is a BTB-Kelch {{substrate}} adaptor protein for a Cul 3 dependent ubiquitin ligase {{complex that}} {{functions as a}} sensor for thiol-reactive <b>chemopreventive</b> <b>compounds</b> and oxidative stress. Inhibition of Keap 1 -dependent ubiquitination of the bZIP transcription factor Nrf 2 enables Nrf 2 to activate a cytoprotective transcriptional program that counters the damaging effects of oxidative stress. In this report we have identified {{a member of the}} phosphoglycerate mutase family, PGAM 5, as a novel substrate for Keap 1. The N terminus of the PGAM 5 protein contains a conserved NXESGE motif that binds to the substrate binding pocket in the Kelch domain of Keap 1, whereas the C-terminal PGAM domain binds Bcl-X L.

Chemopreventive block-ing and/or suppressing agents disrupt the molecular mechanisms that drive carcinogenesis such as DNA damage by reactive oxygen species, increased signal transduction to NF-kB, epigenomic deregulation, and the epithelial mesenchymal transition that leads to metastatic progression.
