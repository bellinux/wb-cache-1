40|$|Since {{the early}} 1990 s the European Union has {{struggled}} to increase integration in the sovereignty sensitive areas of justice and home affairs and foreign policy. The aim {{of this paper is}} to enhance our understanding of what patterns of cooperation have been established between the member states, and why. I do so by analysing the case of short-stay visa policy. Visas are a corner stone of EU’s border control, regulating access to the Union’s area of freedom, security and justice. It is moreover an instrument used in foreign and diplomatic relations. As a field where the member states’ cooperation is particularly intense it is an ‘extreme case’ well-suited for drawing out empirical patterns and developing theoretical concepts. The paper is based on a network analytical approach and a new dataset of all the EU/Schengen member states’ mutual <b>consular</b> <b>visa</b> assistance agreements. This I use to document the extent and pattern of cooperation from 2005 to 2010. I show that the member states rely intensively on each other’s consular services. They mainly share sovereignty in four distinct regional clusters – a Nordic, Benelux, Southern European and an emerging Central Eastern. France and Germany are at the centre of the network. To explain this structure of cooperation I discuss the relative merits of realist, liberal intergovernmentalist and constructivist approaches. I show how they each identify important dynamics but emphasise the relative merits of a constructivist perspective. I put forward a new concept of ‘regional imagined communities’ which explains cooperation by the existence of shared identities owing to regional commonalities in language and state-building histories. I argue that the concept improves our understanding of European integration in visa policy, and suggest it might hold wider potential for explaining dynamics of collaboration in other sovereignty sensitive policy areas.

40|$|Before {{entering}} the United States for permanent or temporary residence, most noncitizens must complete {{a series of}} administrative procedures and background checks. The final {{step in the process}} is an interview with a consular officer in the noncitizen’s home country. That step, in most cases, determines whether a spouse can permanently rejoin her U. S. -citizen husband or wife in the United States or whether another immediate family member can permanently reside in the same home as her U. S. -citizen family member. After a consular officer decides to admit or deny entry to a noncitizen family member, there are limited opportunities for administrative or judicial review of the consular officer’s decision. For decades, federal courts have adhered to the doctrine of consular nonreviewability to limit judicial review of a <b>consular</b> officer’s <b>visa</b> decision. This doctrine, rooted in the legislative and the executive branches’ plenary power over immigration matters, first emerged in Kleindienst v. Mandel. Since then, federal courts have interpreted the doctrine—in some instances limiting the doctrine’s reach, and in others, allowing for more judicial review. In 2014, the U. S. Supreme Court granted certiorari in Din v. Kerry, a U. S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit decision, which held that a visa denial impinges on a U. S. citizen’s constitutionally protected interest in her marriage to a noncitizen spouse. Without the opportunity for either an administrative appeal or judicial review of a visa denial, a single consular officer can force a U. S. citizen, like Mrs. Din, to live apart from her closest family member or to relinquish a stable life and employment in the United States to move abroad with her noncitizen family member. This Comment argues that the visa denial of a U. S. citizen’s family member implicates that citizen’s fundamental Fifth Amendment due process rights—therefore allowing judicial review of the denial—because the Supreme Court has long recognized the liberty interests involved in marriage and in living with one’s immediate and extended family...|$|R
50|$|Prior to World War I, {{passports}} and visas {{were not}} necessary to enter the United States at a designated port of entry. In 1917 (during World War I), the United States Department of State and United States Department of Labor issued a joint order to diplomatic, consular, and immigration officers requiring that noncitizens have a passport and visa before seeking entry to the United States. In 1918, these requirements were made long-term by the United States Congress. Initially, <b>consular</b> officers issuing <b>visas</b> did not check for grounds of inadmissibility; rather, they simply issued the visa and informed the applicant of potential grounds for inadmissibility, leaving the task of determining inadmissibility to the officer {{at the port of}} entry. This led to the problem of people undertaking an expensive journey and then being rejected at the port of entry. In 1924, Congress enacted a provision requiring consular officers to make a determination of admissibility and issue the visa only if they were satisfied. While the officer at the border still had final say on whether to admit the alien (i.e., the alien could be denied entry despite having a valid visa), the visa served an important prior screening and filtering role.|$|R
