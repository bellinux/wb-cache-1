Wondrous, indeed! There before him were the walls of Jerusalem, standing up erect from the hill-side--for the city is still all fenced up--stretching from hill to hill in varying but ever continued line: on the left was the Hill of Sion, David's hill, a hill still inhabited, and mainly by Jews. Here is still the Jews' quarters, and the Jews' hospital too, tended by English doctors, nurtured also by English money; and here, too, close to David's Gate, close also to that new huge Armenian convent, shall one, somewhat closely scrutinizing among heaps of rubbish, come upon a colony of lepers. In the town, but not of it, within the walls, but forbidden all ingress to the streets, there they dwell, a race of mournfullest Pariahs.

To them no happy daily labour brings rest and appetite; their lot forbids them work, as it forbids all other blessings. No; on their dunghills outside their cabins there they sit in the sun, the mournfullest sight one might look on, the leper parents with their leper children, beggars by inheritance, paupers, outcasts, mutilated victims,--but still with souls, if they or any round them did but know it.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2002 Families stay {{connected}} over time through the intergenerational transmission of legacies. Legacies help {{family members to}} articulate family identity, learn more about family history, and provide succeeding generations with information about family culture and ethnicity. This qualitative study examines how older mothers transmit family meanings, history, and culture to family members through legacies and how ethnic histories influenced this process. Thirty older Armenian American mothers residing in California were interviewed. A life course perspective provides the overarching framework for analysis. Participants described the legacies they received and those they planned {{to pass on to}} family members. Emphasis was given to those legacies that symbolized connection to family, underscored family cohesion, and accentuated Armenian cultural roots. Individual age, larger historical events, and the gendered construction of family life influenced both the receipt of legacies and those that were passed on to family members. During the late 19 th and early 20 th centuries, Armenian families were forced to leave their native homeland. Because of these events, Armenian families passed few physical legacies on to family members. Legacies took on other forms such as stories, rituals, family gatherings, religious participation, cooking, and service to others. Women viewed their legacies within the context of motherhood and worked to ensure that <b>certain</b> <b>legacies</b> would be valued and remembered by future generations. Shaped by age, generational position, and ethnic identity, women expressed variation in types of legacies and the ways they planned to share them with family members. Women reported tension when <b>certain</b> <b>legacies</b> lacked meaning for their children (in-law) and grandchildren due to the influences of assimilation, intermarriage, changes in family and paid work patterns, and the characteristics and interests of adult children. A focus on legacies provides a useful lens for understanding how families transmit family identity, culture, and ethnicity to succeeding generations...|$|R

In intensive field studies in the central area of the Gulf of Finland, roughly 65 – 70 % of chicks died in their nest in the 1980 s and 1990 s due to innate diseases. In the 1990 s, the fledging rate was only 0. 02. The diseases consisted mainly of liver degeneration and various inflammations, and most chicks died of sepsis.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} contemporary {{discourses of}} forgetting, {{and in particular}} the notion of `cultural amnesia'. I take as the object of my research the mobilization of amnesia in the humanities and social sciences during the last two decades, arguing that this concept does not have a consistent relation to cultural phenomena but rather names a perceived loss, absence or deficiency, and sometimes excess or surfeit, in knowledge and the articulation of knowledge. I explore what is at stake in these rulings of cultural and social deficiency, the values and frameworks that are invoked to authorize them, and the specific fact of their being set out in terms of memory. My method of historicizing the emergence of the concept of amnesia as a preferred means of figuring cultural deficiency is to trace in contemporary discourses of forgetting <b>certain</b> <b>legacies</b> of Critical Theory of the Frankfurt School. I submit that Theodor W. Adorno's thought is construed by theorists working on the subject of memory as a significant antecedent for contemporary debates; specifically, he is regarded as having anticipated late twentieth-century anxieties about amnesia. I attend to such characterizations both by offering a fresh consideration of the function of memory-related concepts in Critical Theory and by questioning what is at stake in contemporary claims of a relationship to - as well as in frequent disavowals of - aspects of this current of thought. The chapters that follow examine: the discursive functions of the concept of amnesia in cultural and social theory; the relationship between the concepts of reification and forgetting; the processes through which the postwar period became recognized as a period of amnesia for the Holocaust; the place of the concept of amnesia in Fredric Jameson's thesis on postmodernism and in today's recollection of his contribution; and the return of the notion of `the forgotten' in the turn to ethics in poststructuralist literary theory.

These low levels of trust have not changed across different generations, an attitudinal continuity that seems to be due to a <b>certain</b> cultural <b>legacy</b> transmitted from generation to generation and has proved resistant to the major economic, social, and political changes of the last few decades. The authors maintain that this transmission might be explained by the political events most Spaniards experienced and/or received from their elders during their processes of socialization.

30|$|It is also {{important}} that appropriate guidance is given to those in decision-making positions to ensure that new technologies are implemented appropriately; this was notably {{not the case in}} Ottawa, Canada, whereby the publicly owned urban transport service (OC Transpo) purchased 177 hybrid buses in the belief that they would produce the stated achievable fuel savings when operated in any manner [13]. Many of these buses were then operated on long expressways, with minimal braking and accelerations where the benefits of the hybrid engine were exploited very little and fuel consumption was notably greater than comparable journeys in diesel-powered buses [13]. A retrofit programme to then convert all these to diesel-powered engines was then implemented, expecting to cost over £ 7 million, proving extremely wasteful and time consuming, simply because insufficient guidance was given to those in charge of procurement. It can also be more difficult to make decision-makers aware of the current situation; in, for example, <b>certain</b> <b>legacy</b> urban rail systems, it has been found that {{there is a lack of}} accurate knowledge on the energy flows within the system itself, which can obstruct efforts to implement energy efficiency measures [6]. However, in certain cases, the modelled energy savings have actually been inferior to the energy savings achieved in real measurements of the system; it was reported that in Bielefeld, Germany, energy savings from a newly installed flywheel delivered annual savings of 360  MWh— 63  % greater than the expected 220  MWh [14].|$|E

The Marshall Space Flight Center s (MSFC) Payload Operations Integration Center (POIC) ground system provides command, telemetry, and payload planning systems in support of the International Space Station.

40|$|The Subaltern Clinic explores a <b>certain</b> <b>legacy</b> of unreason that Sigmund Freud {{identified}} {{throughout the}} course of his writings as the "death drive," or the compulsion to repeat. In Freud's work, the death drive is often thought as the opposite of the pleasure principle, which situates the pleasure-unpleasure binary at the center of psychoanalytical thinking and Freud's conceptualization of the psyche as well as morality, ethics, and civilization. The Subaltern Clinic traces a legacy of the death drive and a series of thematic concerns that emerge from it, specifically the instability of the pleasure-unpleasure binary that ostensibly upholds the "principle of reason," through a colonial-postcolonial archive. In doing so, the dissertation attends to those subaltern figures who are constituted as the "unreason" of society, particularly the mentally ill, women, and homosexuals. In particular, the dissertation looks to the intersection of psychoanalysis and deconstruction, specifically to Jacques Derrida's engagements with Freud's "Beyond the Pleasure Principle," to argue that deconstruction needs {{to be thought of as}} a marginal and politicized form of psychoanalytic thinking, the stakes of which emerge through Derrida's readings of Freud's death drive. The dissertation follows the thread of these readings to consider the problems of difference, violence, sadism and masochism, and anxiety in the work of colonial and postcolonial practitioners of psychoanalysis as well as postcolonial artists and novelists. The Subaltern Clinic makes the argument that an attention to the legacy of the death drive in the postcolonial archive allows for a more robust critique of postcolonial reason, which would attend to questions of ethics and aesthetics.

40|$|Within some organizations, certain {{individuals}} seem to “live on” {{after they are}} gone. We often refer to these individuals as having a legacy, or a representation that endures in the collective memory of the group after their departure. In this dissertation, I examine the role of legacies in organizations, providing {{a deeper understanding of}} the selection mechanisms that determine who gets remembered in an organization’s collective memory, the mnemonics or memory aids that contribute to their endurance, and the important role they play in the life of the organization. I accomplish this goal through a qualitative study of two organizations in the early stages of merging together. My findings suggest that the selection mechanisms governing who gets remembered reflect evolutionary pressures facing the organization as a for-profit entity and as a community of members. Thus legacies are greatly influenced by one’s impact on the trajectory of the organization as well as one’s impact on relationships within the organizational community. My findings also suggest that these legacies endure in three domains within organizations: 1) cognitive space, in the form of first and second-hand memories, 2) social space in the form of communicative acts, and 3) material space in the form of material artifacts. Individual memories supply the content of legacies, and material artifacts give the legacy physical form, but the legacy is granted social life through communicative acts. As communicative acts die off, so does the social life of the legacy. My findings also suggest that legacies influence social identity processes in organizations, giving clarity to the organizational identity, providing continuity to the organizational identity, enhancing the stability of the organizational identity, and enhancing the attractiveness of the organizational identity. Finally, my findings suggest that <b>certain</b> <b>legacies</b> become institutionalized as they come to embody the identity of the organization, infusing the legacy with moral power, and enabling the legacy to have an enduring influence on the attitudes and behaviors of current members. As a whole, this study illuminates the importance of collective memory processes for organizational studies and opens new avenues for the study of organizational memory, identity and culture...|$|R

40|$|Rome, {{before the}} State is a {{historical}} exploration of the role architecture has played in constructing affective relations of power. It {{is an attempt to}} trace the transformation of the city of Rome against the background of shifting state–church relations between the mid-fifteenth and mid-seventeenth centuries. This period is framed by two events: the struggle of the papacy to establish its seat of temporal power in Rome in the quattrocento and the convoluted context of the Thirty Years’ War in the mid-seventeenth century. This is the period in which an increasingly polycentric and rational, political world was emerging. Central to this work is Paolo Prodi’s critical exposé of papal power over this period, which he elaborated in Il Soverano Pontefice. While Prodi closely follows the legal, administrative, and organizational attempts by which papal power was transformed and centralized, here I will entangle this history with its spatial and sensorial correlates, which mark out a particular history of architecture. If Paolo Prodi argued that, during the period explored here, Rome became a political laboratory that influenced the process of state-building in Europe, my contention is that Rome’s contribution to modern statecraft was not restricted to its administrative practices, as Prodi emphasizes. Rather, I will argue that it was in the affective and spatial techniques of persuasion that were discovered throughout this period that a <b>certain</b> <b>legacy</b> of modern western European power could be observed. In other words, it is in early modern Rome that a new form of modern power emerged that was characterized not only by the rationalization of its practices and development of early governmental mechanisms but also by the embracement of a spatial and affective dimension to cultivate relations of allegiance through the city itself. This thesis is thus an examination of the correlation between the spatial, affective and administrative means by which the papacy began to fashion the pope as a sovereign, and Rome as the capital of the Papal States. I argue that it is in Rome during this period that the simultaneous transformations of the space of the city and of power became indistinguishable from one another. The papacy’s continuous intervention to the city of Rome set in motion over the course of these two centuries not only harnessed allegiance through the traditional means of legal and military force, but also through the cultivation of an affective grip on the life of the city’s citizens. Over this period, the papal court, I will argue, began to develop sensory and spatial techniques that subsequently became instrumental to the formation of modern state machinery. In this way, Rome, before the State, has two aims: on the one hand, it seeks to achieve a spatial extension of Prodi’s argument; and on the other hand, it is an attempt to construct a history of the spatial techniques of persuasion that the papacy developed as a means of transforming its power. In this way, the thesis is an effort to understand the affective dimensions of power which arguably precedes the emergence of the modern state, but nonetheless contributes to it. More specifically, the thesis follows three distinct spatial moments {{in the history of the}} papacy during the period that Prodi examines. I will question how three distinct popes – Eugenius IV, ruling from 1431 to 1447, Sixtus V, ruling from 1585 to 1590, and Urban VIII, pope from 1623 to 1644 – each enabled a series of transformations of the space of Rome whose resulting organizations and architectures had indirect, but nevertheless real consequences in the sphere of power. In investigating these three popes and the Rome they shaped, I will not restrict my reading to the works that they directly authored, but will also include those that they strategically enabled. In this way, what will be emphasized is the predominance of three conceptual categories that, under their respective papacies, became crucial frameworks through which to reconsider the coupling of each pope’s temporal power with the realm of spatial experience: magnificence, liturgy, and admiratio (wonder). In each case, I will provide a brief conceptual history of the concept, the historical context in which they acquired specificity, and a series of architectural and urban vignettes that collectively illustrate their broader spatialization. In tracing the theological and philosophical histories of these concepts, as well as the distinct manner in which a set of spatial interventions were deployed by the papal court, I will attempt to frame a certain relation between the secular and the theological from an architectural perspective. Throughout this work, Carl Schmitt’s famous words, “all significant concepts of the modern theory of the state are secularized theological concepts” resonate. This argument was not foreign to Walter Benjamin, nor to Max Weber, Ernst Kantorowicz and, more recently, Giorgio Agamben. In these scholars’ writings, the relation between the secular and the theological acquired a specificity through the understanding of liturgical acclamation, canon law or biblical exegesis, among other things. Yet here, this thesis proposes to contribute to our understanding of such convoluted relations by instead following the continuous interest the papal court maintained in transforming the space of the city in early modern Rome. In doing so, I underline certain persuasive techniques that lay at the heart of papal power, which were instrumental in imagining an early modern power that constituted itself through the affective and, we could say, sensual dimensions through which it operated.  In following the spatialization of these categories, I begin to distance my reading of papal power from that of Prodi, to frame instead the historical basis on which I can contribute to an architectural understanding of the relation between secular and theological concepts. That is to say, what we will find in this study is that architecture and city space, more broadly, takes on the role of a conduit between the theological and the secular. In doing this, the transformation of city space becomes a crucial lens by which to understand the conditions of emergence of an early form of modern western power. While clearly attempting to contribute to a political understanding of the affective dimension of architecture, this thesis is nonetheless shaped by the intersection of architectural historiography, political theory and philosophy. It is only as such that in each moment we can ask what the role of space is in the assertion of the temporal power of the papacy. Or, to put it differently, how can our understanding of the papacy’s temporal power shed light on the political role of the experience of space? And, finally, it is in this way that we can advance conjectures as to how this period provides an image of the manner in which space, architecture, and artifacts have contributed to the early formation of modern subjectivity...|$|E

The direct result of the protests is not <b>certain,</b> but their <b>legacy</b> was a reinvigoration of the nuclear disarmament movement. Since then, unrelated protest actions have also referenced this event, such as Cesar Chavez' hunger strike that he called a [...] "Fast For Life" [...] in 1988, intended {{to draw attention to the}} harmful affects of pesticides on farm workers. The 1986 Veterans' Fast For Life protested U.S. President Ronald Reagan's pro-Contra policies in Central America. A more recent, similarly-titled event was the 2011 Darfur Fast For Life that called for a re-invigoration of international intervention against genocide in Darfur.|$|R

Scientists have {{become one of the most}} important legacy code producers for many reasons. One of these is long-lived field (about 50 years old) they have been working in. Another reason is the amount of code produced through years and the lack of a well-defined software development process. Even though refactoring concept was born within the pale of object oriented programming we think that this concept is a paramount tool to be applied on Fortran source code. Since it has been successfully used in C language, our objective was to build a reference catalog which will serve as a guide to Fortran programmers. In thesis we discussed and proposed a detailed catalog of Fortran source transformation...|$|R

This dissertation uses a case study of the FIFA World Cup 2010 in South Africa to analyse the question of how perceptions and interpretations of mega-event legacies change over time, from the bid process, through preparation, the event itself, and postevent reckonings of event legacies. As a wide spectrum of stakeholders were involved in the 2010 World Cup, the conclusions drawn in this dissertation reflect these differences of interestand how their perceptions of the World Cup legacies have changed during the various event phases. A <b>certain</b> trend towards <b>legacies</b> that need to be managed has also become visible. This dissertation shows that the World Cup leaves both positive and negative legacies behind, and, moreover, has had ambiguous and complex implications for actors involved...|$|R
50|$|In the United States, {{state law}} determines which {{lifetime}} gifts {{are treated as}} gifts in satisfaction of a bequest. Under the Uniform Probate Code, § 2-609, a lifetime gift is treated as satisfaction of a legacy only if (i) the will provides for deduction of the gift, (ii) the testator indicated in a contemporaneous writing that the lifetime gift was intended to satisfy a legacy in the will, or (iii) the gift recipient acknowledged in writing that the gift was intended to satisfy a legacy in the will. Courts may presume that gifts of money from a parent to a child after {{the execution of the}} parent's will are gifts in satisfaction of the child's legacy under the will, even without a written indication of intent to satisfy the provision under the will. Courts are reluctant to apply the doctrine to <b>certain</b> kinds of <b>legacies,</b> for example, devises of specific real estate or bequests of personal property. These specific legacies are viewed by courts as unique and not able to be replaced with a lifetime gift of money or other property.|$|R
