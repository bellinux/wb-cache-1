40|$|The {{study of}} {{compound}} verbs in English poses numerous problems, among which even their recognition as compounds {{on grounds of}} their derivation. Resulting from at least three different word-formation patterns, compound verbs constitute a heterogeneous class of complex lexemes. Their status as actual compound lexemes invites the differentiation between compounding as a word-formation process and compounds as a special class of lexemes. Even within the latter, compound verbs display marked properties at least {{in relation to the}} inability of standard classifications of compounds to capture and compromise their lexical uniformity and their heterogeneous origin. The adoption of a position in which it is argued that compound verbs in English constitute a constructional idiom and the application of scalar analytical notions which combine word-formationist and lexical-semantic accounts cast in the general framework of the cognitive linguistic enterprise yield informative generalizations concerning the linguistic and conceptual properties of compound verbs in English. In view of Radden and Dirven's (2007 : 41 - 46) claim that we do not need "more than two basic types of conceptual units things and relations" in order to establish linguistically relevant conceptual distinctions, compound verbs pose a problem for neat dichotomous treatment as they very often both conceptually and in terms of form include a "thing" (e. g. to flat-hunt, to house-sit, to fellow-feel, to <b>case-harden,</b> etc.) and thus come closer to a "situation" than to a "relation". Exactly {{because of the fact that}} compound verbs profile/perspectivize "situations" as "relations", they function as special construal mechanisms and as such do not fit the subordinate/coordinate distinction, because they name situations. In view of the above the paper treats compound verbs as a constructional idiom whose analysis necessitates the recognition of the role of conceptual conversion mechanisms, scalar classificatory and interpretative criteria and uniform lexico-semantic treatment...|$|R
25|$|It is {{a common}} {{knowledge}} fallacy that <b>case-hardening</b> was done with bone but this is misleading. Although bone was used, the main carbon donor was hoof and horn.

25|$|Firearms were {{a common}} item {{case-hardened}} in the past, as they required precision machining best done on low carbon alloys, yet needed the hardness and wear resistance {{of a higher}} carbon alloy.

25|$|<b>Case-hardening</b> {{involves}} {{packing the}} low-carbon iron within a substance high in carbon, then heating this pack to encourage carbon migration into {{the surface of}} the iron. This forms a thin surface layer of higher carbon steel, with the carbon content gradually decreasing deeper from the surface. The resulting product combines much of the toughness of a low-carbon steel core, with the hardness and wear resistance of the outer high-carbon steel.|$|E
25|$|Because {{hardened}} metal {{is usually}} more brittle than softer metal, through-hardening (that is, hardening the metal uniformly throughout the piece) {{is not always}} a suitable choice for uses where the metal part is subject to sliding contact with hard or abrasive materials. In such circumstances, <b>case-hardening</b> can provide a part that will not fracture (because of the soft core that can absorb stresses without cracking) but also provides adequate wear resistance on the surface.|$|E
25|$|Carbon {{itself is}} solid at <b>case-hardening</b> {{temperatures}} {{and so is}} immobile. Transport {{to the surface of}} the steel was as gaseous carbon monoxide, generated by the breakdown of the carburising compound and the oxygen packed into the sealed box. This takes place with pure carbon but too slowly to be workable. Although oxygen is required for this process it is re-circulated through the CO cycle and so can be carried out inside a sealed box. The sealing is necessary to stop the CO either leaking out or being oxidised to CO2 by excess outside air.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Case-{{hardening}}</b> or {{surface hardening}} {{is the process}} of hardening the surface of a metal object while allowing the metal deeper underneath to remain soft, thus forming a thin layer of harder metal (called the [...] "case") at the surface. For iron or steel with low carbon content, which has poor to no hardenability of its own, the <b>case-hardening</b> process involves infusing additional carbon into the surface layer. <b>Case-hardening</b> is usually done after the part has been formed into its final shape, but can also be done to increase the hardening element content of bars to be used in a pattern welding or similar process. The term face hardening is also used to describe this technique, when discussing modern armour.|$|E
2500|$|The term <b>case-hardening</b> {{is derived}} from the practicalities of the {{carburization}} process itself, which is essentially the same as the ancient process. The steel work piece is placed inside a case packed tight with a carbon-based <b>case-hardening</b> compound. This is collectively known as a carburizing pack. The pack is put inside a hot furnace for a variable length of time. Time and temperature determines how deep into the surface the hardening extends. However, the depth of hardening is ultimately limited by the inability of carbon to diffuse deeply into solid steel, and a typical depth of surface hardening with this method is up to 1.5mm. Other techniques are also used in modern carburizing, such as heating in a carbon-rich atmosphere. Small items may be case-hardened by repeated heating with a torch and quenching in a carbon rich medium, such as the commercial products Kasenit / Casenite or [...] "Cherry Red". Older formulations of these compounds contain potentially toxic cyanide compounds, while the more recent types such as Cherry Red do not.|$|E
60|$|<b>Case-hardening</b> is {{the name}} given to a simple process, by which the outside of iron may be turned into steel. Small tools, fish-hooks, and keys, etc., are usually made of iron; they are {{fashioned}} first, and case-hardened afterwards. There are good reasons for this: first, {{because it is the}} cheapest way of making them; and secondly, because while steel is hard, iron is tough; and anything made of iron and coated with steel, combines some of the advantages of both metals. The civilised method of <b>case-hardening,</b> is to brighten up the iron and to cover it with prussiate of potash, either powdered or made into a paste. The iron is then heated, until the prussiate of potash has burned away: this operation is repeated three or four times. Finally, the iron, now covered with a thin layer of steel, is hardened by quenching it in water. In default of prussiate of potash, animal or even vegetable charcoal may be used, but the latter is a very imperfect substitute. To make animal charcoal, take a scrap of leather, hide, hoof, horn, flesh, blood--anything, in fact, that has animal matter in it; dry it into hard chips like charcoal, before a fire, and powder it. Put the iron that is to be case-hardened, with some of this charcoal round it, into the midst of a lump of loam. This is first placed near the fire to harden, and then quite into it, where it should be allowed to slowly attain a blood-red heat, but no higher. Then, break open the lump, take out the iron, and drop it into water to harden.|$|E

50|$|During the Iron Age, {{the best}} tools and weapons {{were made from}} steel, {{particularly}} alloys which were produced with a carbon content between approximately 0.30% and 1.2% by weight.
