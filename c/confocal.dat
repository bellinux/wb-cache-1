5|$|Once the {{developing}} neurons reach {{the core of}} the olfactory bulb, they detach from the RMS, which is initiated by Reelin and tenascin and move radially toward glomeruli, this migration is dependent on tenascin-R, and differentiate into subtypes of interneurons. These neurons have been studied in vivo via electrophysiology and <b>confocal</b> imaging.|$|E
25|$|<b>Confocal</b> {{microscopy}} uses a scanning {{point of}} light and a pinhole to prevent out of focus light from reaching the detector. Compared to full sample illumination, <b>confocal</b> microscopy gives slightly higher resolution, and significantly improves optical sectioning. <b>Confocal</b> microscopy is, therefore, commonly used where 3D structure is important.|$|E
25|$|<b>Confocal</b> {{microscopy}} is {{an optical}} imaging technique used to increase micrograph contrast and to reconstruct three-dimensional images {{by using a}} spatial pinhole to eliminate out-of-focus light or flare in specimens that are thicker than the focal plane. This technique has gained popularity in the scientific and industrial communities. Typical applications include life sciences and semiconductor inspection. The principle of <b>confocal</b> imaging was invented and patented by Marvin Minsky in 1957.|$|E
25|$|The {{distance}} between the two points z = ±zR is called the <b>confocal</b> parameter or depth of focus of the beam.|$|E

25|$|<b>Confocal</b> {{microscopy}} X-ray {{fluorescence imaging}} is a newer technique that allows control over depth, {{in addition to}} horizontal and vertical aiming, for example, when analysing buried layers in a painting.|$|E
25|$|As {{previously}} described, enzymes such as {{horseradish peroxidase}} or alkaline phosphatase {{are commonly used}} to catalyse reactions that give a coloured or chemiluminescent product. Fluorescent molecules can be visualised using fluorescence microscopy or <b>confocal</b> microscopy.|$|E
25|$|Because {{of these}} properties, the ideal {{technique}} {{to address the}} N-V centers is <b>confocal</b> microscopy, both at room temperature and at low temperature. In particular, low temperature operation is required to specifically address only the zero-phonon line (ZPL).|$|E
25|$|Flap {{interface}} {{particles are}} a finding whose clinical significance is undetermined. Particles {{of various sizes}} and reflectivity are clinically visible in about 38.7% of eyes examined via slit lamp biomicroscopy and in 100% of eyes examined by <b>confocal</b> microscopy.|$|E
25|$|Dendritic spines {{were first}} {{described}} {{at the end}} of the 19th century by Santiago Ramón y Cajal on cerebellar neurons. Ramón y Cajal then proposed that dendritic spines could serve as contacting sites between neurons. This was demonstrated more than 50 years later thanks to the emergence of electron microscopy. Until the development of <b>confocal</b> microscopy on living tissues, it was commonly admitted that spines were formed during embryonic development and then would remain stable after birth. In this paradigm, variations of synaptic weight were considered as sufficient to explain memory processes at the cellular level. But since about a decade ago, new techniques of <b>confocal</b> microscopy demonstrated that dendritic spines are indeed motile and dynamic structures that undergo a constant turnover, even after birth.|$|E
25|$|Monochlorobimane {{can be used}} to {{quantify}} glutathione in vivo. The quantification is done by <b>confocal</b> laser scanning microscopy after application of the dye to living cells. This quantification process relies on measuring the rates of fluorescence changes and is limited to plant cells.|$|E
25|$|For spatial simulations, {{geometries}} can be {{specified by}} analytic geometry equations, derived from combination of simple shapes or derived from imported images, such as 3D <b>confocal</b> microscope stacks. Utilities for segmenting image data into regions such as nucleus, cytosol and extracellular are provided.|$|E
25|$|Urea in {{concentrations}} up to 8 M {{can be used}} to make fixed {{brain tissue}} transparent to visible light while still preserving fluorescent signals from labeled cells. This allows for much deeper imaging of neuronal processes than previously obtainable using conventional one photon or two photon <b>confocal</b> microscopes.|$|E
25|$|Electron microscopes are {{expensive}} {{to build and}} maintain, but the capital and running costs of <b>confocal</b> light microscope systems now overlaps with those of basic electron microscopes. Microscopes designed to achieve high resolutions must be housed in stable buildings (sometimes underground) with special services such as magnetic field cancelling systems.|$|E
25|$|A {{common and}} {{important}} design is the <b>confocal</b> resonator, with equal curvature mirrors {{equal to the}} cavity length (R1 = R2 = L). This design produces the smallest possible beam diameter at the cavity mirrors for a given cavity length, and is often used in lasers where {{the purity of the}} transverse mode pattern is important.|$|E
25|$|An {{offshoot}} of IRENE, the <b>Confocal</b> Microscope Cylinder Project, can capture a high-resolution three-dimensional {{image of the}} surface, down to 200µm. In order to convert to a digital sound file, this is then played by {{a version of the}} same 'virtual stylus' program developed by the research team in real-time, converted to digital and, if desired, processed through sound-restoration programs.|$|E
25|$|Spine {{maintenance}} and plasticity is activity-dependent and activity-independent. BDNF partially determines spine levels, and {{low levels of}} AMPA receptor activity is necessary to maintain spine survival, and synaptic activity involving NMDA receptors encourages spine growth. Furthermore, two-photon laser scanning microscopy and <b>confocal</b> microscopy have shown that spine volume changes depending on the types of stimuli that are presented to a synapse.|$|E
25|$|Systems {{based on}} single point, <b>confocal,</b> or flying-spot time domain OCT, must scan the sample in two lateral {{dimensions}} and reconstruct a three-dimensional image using depth information obtained by coherence-gating through an axially scanning reference arm (Fig. 2). Two-dimensional lateral scanning has been electromechanically implemented {{by moving the}} sample using a translation stage, and using a novel micro-electro-mechanical system scanner.|$|E
25|$|Optical {{coherence}} tomography (OCT) is {{an established}} {{medical imaging technique}} that uses light to capture micrometer-resolution, three-dimensional images from within optical scattering media (e.g., biological tissue). Optical coherence tomography is based on low-coherence interferometry, typically employing near-infrared light. The use of relatively long wavelength light allows it to penetrate into the scattering medium. <b>Confocal</b> microscopy, another optical technique, typically penetrates less deeply into the sample but with higher resolution.|$|E
25|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{preserve}} the historic content of the recordings, cylinders can be read with a <b>confocal</b> microscope and converted to a digital audio format. The resulting sound clip in most cases sounds better than stylus playback from the original cylinder. Having an electronic version of the original recordings enables archivists to open access to the recordings to a wider audience. This technique also {{has the potential to}} allow for reconstruction of damaged or broken cylinders.|$|E
25|$|The major {{limitation}} of these bimane based probes {{and many other}} reported probes is that these probes are based on irreversible chemical reactions with glutathione, which renders these probes incapable of monitoring the real-time glutathione dynamics. Recently, the first reversible reaction based fluorescent probe-ThiolQuant Green (TQG)-for glutathione was reported. ThiolQuant Green can not only perform high resolution measurements of glutathione levels in single cells using a <b>confocal</b> microscope, but also be applied in flow cytometry to perform bulk measurements.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the surface}} tension, the shape is {{smoothed}} during the drawing process, and {{the shape of the}} resulting fiber does not reproduce the sharp edges of the preform. Nevertheless, careful polishing of the preform is important, since any defects of the preform surface affect the optical and mechanical properties of the resulting fiber. In particular, the preform for the test-fiber shown in the figure was not polished well, and cracks are seen with the <b>confocal</b> optical microscope.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{important}} modern developments. The {{atomic force microscope}} (AFM) and the Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM) are two early versions of scanning probes that launched nanotechnology. There are other types of scanning probe microscopy. Although conceptually similar to the scanning <b>confocal</b> microscope developed by Marvin Minsky in 1961 and the scanning acoustic microscope (SAM) developed by Calvin Quate and coworkers in the 1970s, newer scanning probe microscopes have much higher resolution, since they are not limited by the wavelength of sound or light.|$|E
25|$|Recently, an {{association}} between biofilms and tonsilloliths was shown. Central to the biofilm concept {{is the assumption that}} bacteria form a three dimensional structure, dormant bacteria being in the center to serve as a constant nidus of infection. This impermeable structure renders the biofilm immune to antibiotic treatment. By use of <b>confocal</b> microscopy and microelectrodes, biofilms similar to dental biofilms were shown to be present in the tonsillolith, with oxygen respiration at the outer layer of tonsillolith, denitrification toward the middle, and acidification toward the bottom.|$|E
25|$|Medical ultrasonography, {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (MRI), <b>confocal</b> microscopy, and OCT are differently suited to morphological tissue imaging: while the first two have whole body but low resolution imaging capability (typically {{a fraction of a}} millimeter), the third one can provide images with resolutions well below 1 micrometer (i.e. sub-cellular), between 0 and 100 micrometers in depth, and the fourth can probe as deep as 500 micrometers, but with a lower (i.e. architectural) resolution (around 10 micrometers in lateral and a few micrometers in depth in ophthalmology, for instance, and 20 micrometers in lateral in endoscopy).|$|E
25|$|A. thaliana is {{well suited}} for light {{microscopy}} analysis. Young seedlings on the whole, and their roots in particular, are relatively translucent. This, together with their small size, facilitates live cell imaging using both fluorescence and <b>confocal</b> laser scanning microscopy. By wet-mounting seedlings in water or in culture media, plants may be imaged uninvasively, obviating the need for fixation and sectioning and allowing time-lapse measurements. Fluorescent protein constructs can be introduced through transformation. The developmental stage of each cell can be inferred from its location in the plant or by using fluorescent protein markers, allowing detailed developmental analysis.|$|E
25|$|Following {{a visual}} {{examination}} and a dermatoscopic exam, or in vivo diagnostic {{tools such as}} a <b>confocal</b> microscope, the doctor may biopsy the suspicious mole. A skin biopsy performed under local anesthesia is often required to assist in making or confirming the diagnosis and in defining severity. Elliptical excisional biopsies may remove the tumor, followed by histological analysis and Breslow scoring. Incisional biopsies such as punch biopsies are usually contraindicated in suspected melanomas, because {{of the possibility of}} sampling error or local implantation causing misestimation of tumour thickness. However, fears that such biopsies may increase the risk of metastatic disease seem unfounded.|$|E
25|$|In physics, colloids are an {{interesting}} model system for atoms. Micrometre-scale colloidal particles are {{large enough to be}} observed by optical techniques such as <b>confocal</b> microscopy. Many of the forces that govern the structure and behavior of matter, such as excluded volume interactions or electrostatic forces, govern the structure and behavior of colloidal suspensions. For example, the same techniques used to model ideal gases can be applied to model the behavior of a hard sphere colloidal suspension. In addition, phase transitions in colloidal suspensions can be studied in real time using optical techniques, and are analogous to phase transitions in liquids. In many interesting cases optical fluidity is used to control colloid suspensions.|$|E
25|$|Optical {{microscopy}} and {{electron microscopy}} involve the diffraction, reflection, or refraction of electromagnetic radiation/electron beams {{interacting with the}} specimen, and {{the collection of the}} scattered radiation or another signal in order to create an image. This process may be carried out by wide-field irradiation of the sample (for example standard light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy) or by scanning a fine beam over the sample (for example <b>confocal</b> laser scanning microscopy and scanning electron microscopy). Scanning probe microscopy involves the interaction of a scanning probe with the surface of the object of interest. The development of microscopy revolutionized biology, gave rise to the field of histology and so remains an essential technique in the life and physical sciences.|$|E
25|$|Optical {{cavities}} {{can also}} be used as multipass optical delay lines, folding a light beam so that a long path-length may be achieved in a small space. A plane-parallel cavity with flat mirrors produces a flat zigzag light path, but as discussed above, these designs are very sensitive to mechanical disturbances and walk-off. When curved mirrors are used in a nearly <b>confocal</b> configuration, the beam travels on a circular zigzag path. The latter is called a Herriott-type delay line. A fixed insertion mirror is placed off-axis near one of the curved mirrors, and a mobile pickup mirror is similarly placed near the other curved mirror. A flat linear stage with one pickup mirror is used in case of flat mirrors and a rotational stage with two mirrors is used for the Herriott-type delay line.|$|E
25|$|The RealThiol (RT) probe is {{the second}} {{generation}} reversible reaction-based GSH probe developed by the Wang group. A few key features of RealThiol: 1) it has a much faster forward and backward reaction kinetics compared to ThiolQuant Green, which enables real time monitoring of GSH dynamics in live cells. 2) only micromolar to sub-micromolar RealThiol is needed for staining in cell based experiments, which induces minimal perturbation to GSH level in cells. 3) a high quantum yield coumarin fluorophore was implemented so that background noise can be minimized 4) equilibrium constant of the reaction between RealThiol and GSH has been fine tuned to respond to physiologically relevant concentration of GSH. RealThiol {{can be used to}} perform measurements of glutathione levels in single cells using a high resolution <b>confocal</b> microscope, as well as be applied in flow cytometry to perform bulk measurements in high throughput manner.|$|E
25|$|There are {{uncertainties}} {{with this}} approach using current microscopy techniques. If {{it is possible to}} replicate neuron function from its visible structure alone, then the resolution afforded by a scanning electron microscope would suffice for such a technique. However, as the function of brain tissue is partially determined by molecular events (particularly at synapses, but also at other places on the neuron's cell membrane), this may not suffice for capturing and simulating neuron functions. It may be possible to extend the techniques of serial sectioning and to capture the internal molecular makeup of neurons, through the use of sophisticated immunohistochemistry staining methods that could then be read via <b>confocal</b> laser scanning microscopy. However, as the physiological genesis of 'mind' is not currently known, this method {{may not be able to}} access all of the necessary biochemical information to recreate a human brain with sufficient fidelity.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of the {{invention}} of his revolutionary illumination scheme as {{a graduate student at the}} University of Giessen, Köhler was working on overcoming problems with microphotography. Microscopes were illuminated by gas lamps, mirrors or other primitive light sources, resulting in an uneven specimen illumination unsuited for producing good quality photomicrographs using the slow-speed emulsions available at the time. Over the course of his work for his doctorate degree, Köhler developed a microscope configuration that allowed for an evenly illuminated field of view and reduced optical glare from the light source. It involved a collector lens for the lamp that allowed the light source to be focused on the front aperture of the condenser. This in turn allowed the condenser to be focused on the specimen using a field diaphragm and condenser focus control. This superior illumination scheme is still widely used in modern microscopes and forms the basis for phase contrast, differential interference contrast, epifluorescence, and <b>confocal</b> microscopy.|$|E
