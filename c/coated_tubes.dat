50|$|The CuproBraze {{technology}} uses brazing {{instead of}} soldering to join copper and brass radiator components. The heat exchangers {{are made with}} anneal-resistant copper and brass alloys. The tubes are fabricated from brass strip and coated with a brazing filler material in form of a powder based paste or an amorphous brazing foil is laid between the tube and fin. There is another method of coating the tube in-line on the tube mill.

40|$|Summary: Using two new immunoradiometric assays for thyrotropin, we {{measured}} thyrotropin levels in serum of patients suffering from various clinically and biochemically diagnosed thyroid disorders, and in healthy controls. A thyroliberin Stimulation test {{was performed in}} all patients and controls. Thyrotropin levels were measured using a solid phase IRMA in 339 patients and a <b>coated</b> <b>tube</b> sandwich assay in 152 patients. The lower limits of detection of 0. 1 mU/ 1 (solid phase IRMA) and 0. 02 mU/ 1 (<b>coated</b> <b>tube</b> sandwich assay) äs well äs the specificity of these two assays were superior to those of conventional thyrotropin assays. Basal thyrotropin values were clearly different between euthyroid controls and patients non responding to thyroliberin Stimulation. However, the values for these two groups overlapped those for patients showing a subnormal increase upon Stimulation with thyroliberin. The thyroliberin Stimulation test in patients with autonomous adenomas, together with the measurement of thyrotropin using these sensitive assays, provides additional Information in the low ränge below 1. 0 mU/ 1, i. e. below the lower limit of detection of conventional double antibody radioimmunoassays.

50|$|Molecular ‘switches’ {{peptides}} can be {{made into}} nanoswitches when an electronic component is incorporated. Metal nanocrystals can be covalently linked to the peptides to make them electronically responsive; research is currently being conducted on how to develop electronically controlled molecules and molecular ‘machines’ using these molecular ‘switches’.Peptide nanofibers {{can also be used}} as growth templates for a range of inorganic materials such as silver, gold, platinum, cobalt, nickel and various semiconducting materials. Electrons transferring aromatic moieties can also be attached to the side chains of peptides to form conducting nanostructures which can able to transfer electrons in a certain direction.Metal and semiconductor binding peptides has been used for the fabrication of nanowires. Peptides self-assemble into hollow nanotubes to act as casting molds; metal ions that migrates inside the tube undergoes reduction to metallic form. The peptide ‘ mold’ can then be enzymatically destroyed to produce metal nanowires of about 20 nm diameter. This has been done making gold nanowires and this application is especially significant {{in light of the fact}} that nanowires of this scale cannot be made by lithography. Researchers has also successfully developed multi layer nanocables with a silver core nanowire, a peptide insulation layer and a gold outer coat, This is done by reducing AgNO3 inside nanotubes, and then bounding a layer of thiol containing peptides with gold particles attached. This layer acts as a nucleation site during the next step where process of electroless deposition layers a coating of gold on the nanotubes to form metal-insulator-metal trilayer coaxial nanocables. Peptide nanotubes are able to produce nanowires of uniform size and this is particularly useful in the nanoelectric applications as electrical and magnetic properties are sensitive to size.Nanotube’s exceptional mechanical strength and stability makes them excellent materials for application in this area.Nanotubes has also been used in the developments of electrochemical biosensing platforms and has proved to have great potential. Dipeptide Nanotubes deposited on graphite electrodes improved electrode sensitivity; thiol-modified nanotubes deposited on gold with a coating of enzymes improved sensitivity and reproducibility for the detection of glucose and ethanol, as well as a shortened detection time, large current density and improved stability. Nanotubes have also been successfully coated with proteins, nanocrystals, and metalloporphyrin through hydrogen bonding and these <b>coated</b> <b>tubes</b> have great potentials in the areas of chemical sensors.Designed peptides with a known structure that would self-assemble into a regular growth template would enable the self-assembly of nanoscale electronic circuits and devices. However, one issue that has yet to be resolved is the ability to control the positioning of the nanostructures. This positioning relative to substrates, to each other and to other functional component is crucial and although progress has been made in this domain, more work has to be completed before this control can be established.|$|E

Commercially available stainless steel tubes having 10 mm outside diameter and 0. 6 mm wall thickness {{were used to}} fabricate the test heater. The tube surface was roughed with emery paper 360 or polished with abrasive compound. Aluminium porous coatings of 0. 15 mm thick with porosity of about 40 % were produced by plasma spraying. The experiments were conducted under different absolute operating pressures, i. e., 200, 100, and 10 kPa. Nanoparticles were tested at the concentration of 0. 01, 0. 1, and 1 % by weight. Ultrasonic vibration was used in order to stabilize the dispersion of the nanoparticles. It was observed that independent of operating pressure and roughness of the stainless steel tubes addition of even small amount of nanoparticles augments heat transfer in comparison to boiling of distilled water. Contrary to rough tubes boiling heat transfer coefficient of tested nanofluids on porous <b>coated</b> <b>tubes</b> was lower compared to that for distilled water while boiling on porous <b>coated</b> <b>tubes.</b> A correlation equation for prediction of the average heat transfer coefficient during boiling of nanofluids on smooth, rough and porous <b>coated</b> <b>tubes</b> is proposed.

40|$|The results {{refer to}} changes of {{mechanical}} properties of thin-walled nickel-chromium alloy tube specimens after multistage cold drawing. The {{goal was to}} analyze the possibilities of changing the kinetics of hardening and destruction under influence of deposited metal oxide films. It has been noticed that under ultimate strain by drawing strength of <b>coated</b> <b>tube</b> specimens {{is much more than}} that of specimens without films. Specifically, the ultimate value of strain for <b>coated</b> <b>tube</b> specimens increases. At the same time the coated specimens have relatively high plasticity.

In addition, there are the technological advantages of using the films under drawing. These advantages are the better quality of surface and decrease of drawing force. The possibility of effective application of plasticizing films to machining tools has been noted. The plasticity effect in this case is 50 – 70 % of that when films are deposited on material. Besides, they work as solid lubricants, decreasing power consumption for working and wear of tool.
