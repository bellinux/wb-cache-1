5|$|Andrew Peck also {{considers}} the Slender Man {{to be an}} authentic form of folklore and notes its similarity to emergent forms of offline legend performance.

He concludes that the Slender Man represents a digital legend cycle that combines the generic <b>conventions</b> <b>and</b> emergent qualities of oral and visual performance with the collaborative potential of networked communication.|$|E
