5|$|Killer whales {{have helped}} humans hunting other whales. One {{well-known}} example was the killer whales of Eden, Australia, including the male known as Old Tom. Whalers more often <b>considered</b> <b>them</b> a nuisance, however, as orcas would gather to scavenge {{meat from the}} whalers' catch. Some populations, such as in Alaska's Prince William Sound, may have been reduced significantly by whalers shooting them in retaliation.|$|E
5|$|Lacaille charted and {{designated}} ten {{stars with}} the Bayer designations Alpha through to Kappa in 1756. He catalogued stars that became Lambda and Mu {{but did not}} designate them as he <b>considered</b> <b>them</b> informes as they lay outside the asterism proper. Baily <b>considered</b> <b>them</b> part of Musca, and Gould gave them their Bayer designations. Francis Baily also dropped Kappa, which he felt was too faint to warrant a name, and designated two adjacent stars as Zeta1 and Zeta2. These last two stars are 1° apart, quite far to be sharing a Bayer designation. Lacaille had originally labelled the fainter one as Zeta, while Baily presupposed he'd meant to label the brighter one. Reluctant to remove Lacaille's designation, he gave them both the Zeta designation. Altogether there are 62 stars brighter than magnitude 6.5 in the constellation.|$|E

5000|$|Sons of Jacob: These men are {{sometimes}} {{not considered to}} be prophets, although most exegesis scholars <b>consider</b> <b>them</b> to be prophets, citing the hadith of Muhammad and their status as prophets in Judaism. The reason that some do not <b>consider</b> <b>them</b> as prophets is because of their behaviour with Yusuf (Joseph) and that they lied to their father.|$|R

5|$|Sculptural {{fragments}} to Rodin were autonomous works, and he <b>considered</b> <b>them</b> {{the essence}} of his artistic statement. His fragments– perhaps lacking arms, legs, or a head– took sculpture further from its traditional role of portraying likenesses, and into a realm where forms existed for their own sake. Notable examples are The Walking Man, Meditation without Arms, and Iris, Messenger of the Gods.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day the Spanish entered Tecpan Atitlan, the Tz'utujil capital, but found it deserted. The Tz'utujil leaders responded to Alvarado's messengers by surrendering to Pedro de Alvarado and swearing loyalty to Spain, {{at which point}} Alvarado <b>considered</b> <b>them</b> pacified and returned to Iximche; three days later, the lords of the Tz'utujil arrived there to pledge their loyalty and offer tribute to the conquistadors.|$|E
5|$|After the Second World War, {{there was}} a large {{increase}} in the number of gangs in Sophiatown. Part of the reason for this was that there were about 20000 African teenagers in the city who were not at school and did not have jobs. Township youths were unable to find jobs easily. Employers were reluctant to employ teenagers as they did not have any work experience, and many of them were not able to read or write. They also <b>considered</b> <b>them</b> to be undisciplined and weak.|$|E

5|$|All {{thirteen}} known Ruisdael etchings {{come from}} his early period, {{with the first}} one dated 1646. It is unknown who taught him the art of etching. No etchings exist signed by his father, his uncle, or his fellow Haarlem landscapist Cornelis Vroom, who influenced his other work. His etchings show little influence from Rembrandt, either in style or technique. Few original impressions exist; five etchings survive in only a single impression. The rarity of prints suggests that Ruisdael <b>considered</b> <b>them</b> trial essays, which did not warrant large editions. The etching expert Georges Duplessis singled out Grainfield at the Edge of a Wood and The Travellers as unrivalled illustrations of Ruisdael's genius.|$|E
5|$|English {{biologist}} Thomas Henry Huxley reconsidered {{the fish}} scales described by Agassiz and <b>considered</b> <b>them</b> {{to belong to}} a crocodilian. He first proposed this to the Geological Society of London in 1858, and went into more detail in an 1875 paper in the society's quarterly journal. By this time, new material had been uncovered from Elgin that indicated that Stagonolepis was not a fish, but a reptile. However, Stagonolepis was still known primarily by scutes and imprints of scutes, many of which were not well preserved.|$|E
5|$|In 1911, when Bauer {{again was}} asked to {{illustrate}} the book, {{he made it clear}} to the publisher that he wanted to retain his pictures along with the copyrights after publication. The publishing house had kept the original illustrations for the previous editions and <b>considered</b> <b>them</b> their property. Bauer was backed up in his request by other artists facing the same problem. The publishers did not budge from their position and without Bauer's illustrations, book sales dropped.|$|E

5|$|John J. Thorpe, vice {{president}} of AASEREA led the renewed unionization effort, and he {{and a group of}} men traveled to Indianapolis. Drawing support from union employees of the Indianapolis Street Railway Company, Thorpe began a campaign to unionize the employees of the Traction and Terminal Company in August 1913. The 900 non-union employees of the Traction and Terminal Company were generally paid much less and worked longer hours than the union workers of the smaller transportation company, and Thorpe <b>considered</b> <b>them</b> to be a prime target for the union organizing attempt.|$|E
5|$|Keyser and de Houtman {{assigned}} {{twelve stars}} to the constellation. Bayer depicted Grus on his chart, {{but did not}} assign its stars Bayer designations. French explorer and astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille labelled them Alpha to Phi in 1756 with some omissions. In 1879, American astronomer Benjamin Gould added Kappa, Nu, Omicron and Xi, which had all been catalogued by Lacaille but not given Bayer designations. Lacaille <b>considered</b> <b>them</b> too faint, while Gould thought otherwise. Xi Gruis had originally been placed in Microscopium. Conversely, Gould dropped Lacaille's Sigma as {{he thought it was}} too dim.|$|E
5|$|Lobengula {{refused to}} allow any of the izinDuna to sign the document. Exactly why he did this is not clear. Rudd's {{interpretation}} was that the king <b>considered</b> <b>them</b> to have already been consulted at the day's indaba, and so {{did not think it}} necessary for them to also sign. Keppel-Jones comments that Lobengula might have felt that it would be harder to repudiate the document later if it bore the marks of his izinDuna alongside his own.|$|E

In contrast, the American public was clearly in favour of the marriage, as was most of the American press.|$|E
5|$|Some {{sources such}} as the Mammal Species of the World {{recognize}} nine subspecies and list both P. o. palustris or P. o. paraguensis separately. However, both Pocock and Seymour <b>considered</b> <b>them</b> as synonyms for the same subspecies. The latter preferred P. o. paraguensis because the description of P. o. palustris {{was based on a}} fossil skull. In addition, extinct subspecies P. o. augusta and P. o. mesembrina lived throughout the Americas during the Pleistocene.|$|E

Occasionally and rarely, members of the Palmyrene families took Greek names while ethnic Greeks were few; {{the majority of people}} with Greek names, who did not belong to one of the city's families, were freed slaves. The Palmyrenes seem to have disliked the Greeks, <b>considered</b> <b>them</b> foreigners, and restricted their settlement in the city.|$|E
