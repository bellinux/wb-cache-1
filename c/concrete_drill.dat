However, this was met {{by a lot of}} opposition from the surrounding communities and eventually the proposals were overruled and {{the decision was made to}} build a school instead. The school cost £93,000 to build and originally accommodated 240 pupils. The school consisted of six classrooms, stores, a handicraft room, a science laboratory, a kitchen, a general practical room, a library, a gymnasium, changing rooms, cloakrooms, offices, staff rooms, and an assembly hall complete with a stage. The school sat in nine acres of grounds, complete with three tennis courts, a large <b>concrete</b> <b>drill</b> area, and provision for two soccer pitches, two hockey pitches and two cricket pitches. The school was officially opened on 6 November 1957 by Dowager Lady Kenyon.|$|E
40|$|The {{reduction}} of EOL concrete disposal in landfills, {{together with a}} lower exploitation of primary raw materials, generates a strong interest to develop, set-up and apply innovative technologies to maximize Construction and Demolition Waste (C&DW) conversion into useful secondary raw materials. Such a goal can be reached starting from a punctual in-situ efficient characterization of the objects to dismantle {{in order to develop}} demolition actions aimed to set up innovative mechanical-physical processes to recover the different materials and products to recycle. In this paper an innovative recycling-oriented characterization strategy based on HyperSpectral Imaging (HSI) is described in order to identify aggregates and mortar in drill core samples from end-of-life concrete. To reach this goal, <b>concrete</b> <b>drill</b> cores from a demolition site were systematically investigated by HSI in the short wave infrared field (1000 - 2500 nm). Results obtained by the adoption of the HSI approach showed as this technology can be successfully applied to analyze quality and characteristics of C& DW before dismantling and as final product to re-utilise after demolition-milling-classification actions. The proposed technique and the related recognition logics, through the spectral signature detection of finite physical domains (i. e. concrete slice and/or particle) of different nature and composition, allows; i) to develop characterization procedures able to quantitatively assess end-of-life concrete compositional/textural characteristics and ii) to set up innovative sorting strategies to qualify the different materials constituting drill core samples...|$|E
40|$|Construction dust {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{concerned}} pollutants presenting risks to human health. Dust generated from <b>concrete</b> <b>drilling,</b> particularly true for silica dust, have an adverse effect on the health of workers. There is a long-term concern about the overexposure of construction workers to respirable crystalline silica. The high exposure to silica, even over a short period, can lead to silicosis. In order to control the dust generated during the process of <b>concrete</b> <b>drilling,</b> a local Hong Kong contractor has implemented DustBubble during the <b>concrete</b> <b>drilling</b> works. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of this new dust control measure, an experimental study has been designed and conducted. The respirable dust and silica dust concentrations of the following two situations were compared: workers <b>drilling</b> <b>concrete</b> with and without the use of DustBubble. Personal respirable samples were collected and analysed based on NIOSH 0600 and 7500 methods. The results revealed that DustBubble could significantly reduce the respirable dust exposure by 63 %. However, there was no evidence that the use of DustBubble could reduce the respirable quartz exposure. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

50|$|There {{are three}} ways to place piles for a deep foundation. They can be driven, drilled, or {{installed}} {{by use of}} an auger. Driven piles are extended to their necessary depths with the application of external energy {{in the same way}} a nail is hammered. There are four typical hammers used to drive such piles: drop hammers, diesel hammers, hydraulic hammers, and air hammers. Drop hammers simply drop a heavy weight onto the pile to drive it, while diesel hammers use a single cylinder diesel engine to force piles through the Earth. Similarly, hydraulic and air hammers supply energy to piles through hydraulic and air forces. Energy imparted from a hammer head varies with type of hammer chosen, and can be as high as a million foot pounds for large scale diesel hammers, a very common hammer head used in practice. Piles are made of a variety of material including steel, timber, and <b>concrete.</b> <b>Drilled</b> piles are created by first drilling a hole to the appropriate depth, and filling it with <b>concrete.</b> <b>Drilled</b> piles can typically carry more load than driven piles, simply due to a larger diameter pile. The auger method of pile installation is similar to drilled pile installation, but concrete is pumped into the hole as the auger is being removed.|$|R

40|$|Dense {{suspensions}} are {{materials with}} broad applications both in industrial processes (e. g. waste disposal, <b>concrete,</b> <b>drilling</b> muds, metalworking chip transport, and food processing) and in natural phenomena (e. g. flows of slurries, debris, and lava). Despite its long research history and its practical relevance, {{the mechanics of}} dense suspensions remain poorly understood. The major difficulty is that the grains interact both by hydrodynamic interactions through the liquid and by mechanical contact. These systems thus belong to an intermediate regime between pure suspensions and granular flows. We show that we can unify suspension and granular rheology under a common framework by transferring the frictional approach of dry granular media to wet suspensions of spherical particles. We also discuss non-Newtonian behavior such as normal-stress differences and shear-induced migration. Beyond the classical problem of dense suspension of hard spheres which {{is far from being}} completely resolved, there are also entirely novel avenues of study concerning more complex mixtures of particles and fluids such as those involving other types of particles (e. g. fibers) or non-Newtonian fluids that we will also address...|$|R
40|$|This report aims {{to outline}} {{a number of}} {{attachment}} methods for the geophones used in vibration measurements. On behalf of Bjerking AB and their department for environmental control and vibration, a new attachment method has been developed that works on today’s building designs. Suggested mounting methods include some methods with their main stronghold in the foundation’s outermost layer and some with mounting in the concrete inside the foam. The best method is to drill through the foam and with a concrete screw - suitable for <b>concrete</b> <b>drilling</b> without plug - and anchor the geophone in the concrete. Due to the difficulty {{to get a hold}} of these screws with the required length and diameter for the current case, a similar approach with available material has been developed. This method includes a hammer drill, a threaded rod, an expander and two nuts. The conclusion drawn is that the attachment of the concrete is preferable and that this can be achieved with relatively simple means. Other methods require extensive knowledge of the building’s design as well as advanced and time-consuming tools...|$|R

50|$|Tyrolit was co-founded on the 13th of February 1919 by Daniel Swarovski to {{manufacture}} grinding wheels {{for the production}} of Swarovski-Crystals. During World War I, the Swarovski Group was cut off from supplies of grinding wheels and was forced to develop and produce its own grinding wheels. After the war, it was decided to commercialize this activity and to start a separate company: Tyrolit was born.In 1950, the company relocated from the Swarovski Headquarters in Wattens to a new location in Schwaz. One of the largest drivers of growth of the company was the market launch of the glass fibre reinforced cut-off and grinding wheel SECUR in 1952. The glass fibre reinforcement greatly improved the security of the tools against centrifugal breakage.In 1991 Tyrolit acquired the US company Diamond Products and the Swiss company Hydrostress. These acquisitions added significant presence in the market for <b>concrete</b> <b>drilling</b> and sawing systems.Further major acquisitions took place in 2004 with the purchasing of the Czech company Carborundum Electrite, in 2009 with the purchasing of the US company Radiac and in 2014 with the purchasing of the South African company Grinding Techniques.|$|R

40|$|Dam break wave of {{bentonite}} suspension (17 % mass concentration) down 15 º slope ii Thixotropic fluids {{are commonly}} used {{in the construction industry}} (e. g. liquid cements, liquid <b>concrete,</b> <b>drilling</b> fluids), industrial applications (e. g. muds, paints) and the food industry (e. g. liquid dairy products, ketchup). Related applications include some forms of mud flows and debris flows, pasty sewage sludges and some wastewater treatment residues. Thixotropy is the characteristic of a fluid to form a gelled structure over time when it is not subjected to shearing and to liquefy when agitated. A thixotropic fluid is a non-Newtonian fluid with a viscosity that is a function of both shear rate ∂V/∂y and instantaneous state(s) of structure of the material. Such a fluid exhibits a reversible time-dependent decrease in apparent viscosity under shear rate and a gradual recovery when the shear stress is removed. This report describes a basic study of dam break wave with thixotropic fluid. A dam break wave is a sudden release of a mass of fluid in a channel. This type of flows has not been studied to date with thixotropic fluid, despite its practical applications: e. g., mudflow release, concrete tests including L-Box and J-Ring for self-consolidating concret...|$|R

40|$|Over 2 {{million workers}} are {{potentially}} exposed to respirable crystalline silica with {{the overwhelming majority}} in the construction industry. Occupational exposure to respirable crystalline silica can lead to silicosis, lung cancer, and other adverse diseases. The present research evaluated novel designs in both traditional ventilation and local exhaust ventilation for a <b>concrete</b> dowel <b>drill</b> to reduce occupational exposures such as silica. The first study investigated traditional ventilation novel designs to increase capture velocities without increasing fan speeds or power consumption. The second and third study focused on improving a <b>concrete</b> dowel <b>drill</b> local exhaust ventilation design to reduce potential respirable crystalline silica exposures during large concrete construction project such as airport runways. Previous research indicated that the manufacturer’s local exhaust ventilation system reduced respirable crystalline silica exposures by over 90 percent but the system was susceptible to filter and hose clogging which reduced performance. In the second study, a laboratory study evaluated two novel local exhaust ventilation hoods, one commercially available hood, and the dowel drill manufacturer’s hood for hood efficiency and airflow characteristics. The novel design hoods increased hood coefficient of entry from 0. 59 for the manufacturer’s hood to 0. 64 indicating increased efficiency. Novel simple hood analysis found an average hood coefficient of entry of 0. 81 indicating further improvements can be made. In the third study, simulated workplace conditions were {{used to evaluate the}} best performance hood identified in laboratory testing along with other local exhaust ventilation modifications such as replacing the manufacturer’s corrugated hose with smooth-bore hose and including a cyclone pre-separator to reduce the dust transport burden within the exhaust system. The most effective local exhaust ventilation configuration consisted of the novel design hood, smooth-bore hose, and cyclone which reduced average accumulated hose weight (manufacturer’s configuration = 0. 3 pounds per trial vs. most effective configuration = 0. 05 pounds per trial) and increased average cleanout bucket capture (0. 95 pounds per trial to 6. 30 pounds per trial).

The aim of this study was to (1) use a participatory process to develop a rig to support pneumatic rock drills or large electric hammer drills in order to reduce the health risks and (2) evaluate the usability of the rig. Seven prototype rigs for supporting large hammer drills were developed and modified with feedback from commercial contractors and construction workers.

Subjective regional fatigue was significantly less in the neck, shoulders, hands and arms, and lower back) when using the universal rig compared to the usual manual method. Usability ratings for the rig were significantly better than the usual method on stability, control, drilling, accuracy, and vibration. Drilling time was reduced by approximately 50 % with the rig. Commercial construction contractors, laborers and electricians who use large hammer drills for drilling many holes should consider using such a rig to prevent musculoskeletal disorders, fatigue, and silicosis.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} cost {{implications}} of contractual incompleteness {{and its effect}} on subcontracting decisions in the bridge construction industry. Construction contracts are incomplete because the original blueprints and specifications may require modifications during construction. According to the transactions cost theory of the firm—Coase (1937), Williamson (1985) —such contract revisions can lead to significant bargaining and renegotiation costs. Furthermore, theory predicts these costs are larger if a subcontractor performs the work. Forward looking contractors anticipate these costs and incorporate them in their bids. I develop an empirical framework to quan-tify the impact of incompleteness on cost for {{both in and out of}} house transactions and apply it to 32 bridge contracts procured by the California Department of Trans-portation. Contracts contain many work items (e. g. casting <b>concrete,</b> <b>drilling,</b> traffic striping). For each item, contractors decide whether to perform work themselves or hire a subcontractor and submit a bid. The difference between the work item quantity in the original contract and the quantity actually installed after revisions proxies for incompleteness. In estimation, I account for the strategic aspects of bidding to recover cost from bids and exploit the panel data structure to account for the endogeneity of subcontracting decisions. On average, incompleteness explains a small portion of cost, 2 %, for in-house transactions and a large portion, 13 %, for subcontracted transactions. The results provide quantitative evidence in support of incomplete contracting theories of the firm and have practical significance for evaluating procurement practices...|$|R

50|$|Cinderella Castle is {{designed}} to reflect the late-Gothic, flamboyant style of the 1400s. Unlike Disneyland's castle, no gold is used on the exterior; all gold colors are anodized aluminum. Despite appearances, no bricks were used in its construction; the inner structure is constructed of six hundred tons of steelbraced frame construction, and a 10 in reinforced concrete wall encircles the structure to the full height of the outermost stone-like walls. All of the steel and concrete works are supported on a <b>concrete</b> <b>drilled</b> caisson foundation. Much less fiberglass is used than is popularly supposed. Rather, most of the exterior is a thick, very hard fiber-reinforced gypsum plaster that is supported by light-gauge metal studs. Most fiberglass work is reserved for the exterior walls of more ornate upper towers. The roofs are not fiberglass, either. They are shingled in {{the same type of}} plastic that computer monitor shells are made from, attached to a cone of light gauge steel sheeting over the steel sub-frame. These towers were lifted by crane, then welded and bolted permanently to the main structure.

It would take months to disassemble, it would be too dangerous to operate the 300 ft crane required in windy conditions, and there would have to be a safer building to keep it in.
