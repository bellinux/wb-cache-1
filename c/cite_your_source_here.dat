WHAT TO DOCUMENT In order to avoid plagiarism, you must cite sources for all borrowed information and ideas. You do not need to document statements that are common knowledge or generally known facts (i. e., “The boiling point of water is 212 degrees”). However, when in doubt, always <b>cite</b> <b>your</b> <b>source...</b>|$|R

Source templates based upon Wholly Genes' interpretation of the source types in Richard S. Lackey's <b>Cite</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Sources</b> are also provided. The source templates in the UK edition are based on designs by Caroline Gurney for sources commonly encountered in the United Kingdom.|$|R
40|$|What is {{plagiarism}}? Plagiarism {{is using}} the work of other people without acknowledgement. Rules about plagiarism apply {{to the use of}} all text, including written information, pictures/images, maps, tables and figures from all sources (e. g. books, journal articles, the Internet and magazines). Plagiarism can also apply to spoken words (e. g. a radio broadcast or a lecture). All students should know that plagiarism is a serious violation of academic values, with potentially serious consequences, which are outlined in the UNE Policy documents. You should know how to: 1. <b>Cite</b> <b>your</b> <b>source</b> 2. Paraphrase or use direct quotes 3. Check your understanding of paraphrasin...|$|R
40|$|When {{you refer}} {{to the work of}} other authors or researchers, you need to <b>cite</b> <b>your</b> <b>sources.</b> In addition, you need to work the {{citation}} into the text of your paper clearly and concisely. There are basically three ways to do this: 1. Quote the exact words from the source. Do this only if the words are particularly memorable or expressive. 2. Name the author or source, and then state the information from that <b>source</b> in <b>your</b> own words (paraphrase). This is an effective way to state the results of specific studies or experiments. 3. Simply state the information, and then note the source of the information. This is the most common way to cite general information rather than specific studies. The following examples and pointers illustrate how each of these citation methods can be used effectively...|$|R
40|$|MLA style {{documentation}} is used widely {{to document}} sources of research. This handout {{will show you}} how to <b>cite</b> <b>your</b> <b>sources</b> of research both in the text, as you summarize, paraphrase, or quote directly material from sources, {{and at the end of}} your document when you create a list of sources that you have <b>cited</b> within <b>your</b> paper. Please note that this handout may not answer all of your questions regarding documenting and citation. More detailed information can be found in the sixth edition of the MLA Handbook for Writers of Research Papers. CITING PRINT and ELECTRONIC SOURCE MATERIAL in the TEXT Use a parenthetical citation (in-text citation) to acknowledge a quotation (including an indented one), summary, paraphrase, or the source of an idea or fact. A citation is incorporated within the text and enables the reader to locate the source of the information in the alphabetical Works Cited list at the end of the paper. Placement and Punctuation The parenthetical citation is placed in the text as near as possible to the information being cited, usually – but not always – at the end of a sentence...|$|R

All assignments must be submitted to possibly earn passing grade) On the back is the grading rubric {{that will be used}} for your paper. Also, attached {{is an example of a}} previously submitted strong paper – you may find it helpful to see what it was like. Notice some of its strong features: • Good summary of the problem • Doesn’t just rehash what others say, but adds some personal assessment and analysis • Considers multiple points of view • Relates the specific problem to computing in general This paper assignment was previously announced. Attached is a copy of the instructions. Some reminders: 1. Please do not place your name on the paper – only on this coversheet, stapled to your paper. 2. Be sure to <b>cite</b> <b>your</b> <b>sources</b> (you can use footnotes or parenthetical citations) 3. Use your own words. Use quotations where necessary, but this should be infrequent and brief.
