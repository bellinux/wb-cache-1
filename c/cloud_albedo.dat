The updated parameterization includes the impact of surface albedo on the retrievals of stratus cloud microphysical and radiative properties, and has a significant improvement over D 98 when surface albedo is high. Comparing the retrievals, the cloud-droplet effective radii (r(sub e)) calculated from the updated parameterization have a higher correlation coefficient (0. 733) and lower Root-Mean-Square (RMS) error (1. 74 m or 17. 4 %) than those (0. 602, 4. 0 m or 40 %) from the D 98.

These would then act as cloud condensation nuclei, increasing the <b>cloud</b> <b>albedo.</b>|$|E
40|$|This talk {{provides}} an overview of the subject of absorption of solar radiation by clouds in the earth's atmosphere. The paper summarizes the available evidence which points to disagreements between theoretical and observed values of cloud absorption (and reflections). The importance of these discrepancies, particularly to remote sensing of clouds as well as to studies of cloud physics and earth radiation budgets, is emphasized. Existing cloud absorption and reflection measurements are reviewed and the persistent differences that exist between calculated and measured near-infrared <b>cloud</b> <b>albedos</b> are highlighted. Various explanations for these reflection and absorption discrepancies are discussed under two separate paths: a theoretician's approach and an experimentalist's approach. Examples for the former approach include model accuracy tests, large-droplet hypothesis, excess absorbing aerosol, enhanced water vapor continuum absorption, and effects of cloud inhomogeneity. The latter approach focuses on discussions of instrumental device, calibration, operational strategy, and signal/noise separation. A recommendation for future activities on this subject will be given...|$|R

40|$|The diurnal {{cycle and}} the daily mean at the land-surface result from the {{coupling}} of many physical processes. The framework of this review is largely conceptual; looking for relationships and information in the coupling of processes in models and observations. Starting from the surface energy balance, {{the role of the}} surface and <b>cloud</b> <b>albedos</b> in the shortwave and longwave fluxes is discussed. A long-wave radiative scaling of the diurnal temperature range and the night-time boundary layer is summarized. Several aspects of the local surface energy partition are presented: the role of soilwater availability and clouds; vector methods for understanding mixed layer evolution, and the coupling between surface and boundary layer that determines the lifting condensation level. Moving to larger scales, evaporation-precipitation feedback in models is discussed; and the coupling of column water vapor, clouds and precipitation to vertical motion and moisture convergence over the Amazon. The final topic is a comparison of the ratio of surface shortwave cloud forcing to the diabatic precipitation forcing of the atmosphere in ERA- 40 with observa-tions.

40|$|The {{projected}} {{response of}} the atmospheric circulation to the radiative changes induced by CO 2 forcing and climate feedbacks is currently uncertain. In this modelling study, the impact of CO 2 -induced climate feedbacks on changes in jet latitude and speed is assessed by imposing surface <b>albedo,</b> <b>cloud,</b> and water vapor feedbacks {{as if they were}} forcings in two climate models, CAM 4 and ECHAM 6. The jet response to radiative feedbacks can be broadly interpreted through changes in midlatitude baroclinicity. Clouds enhance baroclinicity, favoring a strengthened, poleward shifted jet; this is mitigated by surface albedo changes which have the opposite effect on baroclinicity and the jet, while water vapor has opposing effects on upper- and lower-level baroclinicity with little net impact on the jet. Large differences between the CAM 4 and ECHAM 6 responses illustrate how model uncertainty in radiative feedbacks causes a large spread in the baroclinicity response to CO 2 forcing. Across the CMIP 5 models, differences in shortwave feedbacks by <b>clouds</b> and <b>albedo</b> are a dominant contribution to this spread. Forcing CAM 4 with shortwave <b>cloud</b> and <b>albedo</b> feedbacks from a representative set of CMIP 5 models yields a wide range of jet responses that strongly correlate with the meridional gradient of the anomalous shortwave heating and the associated baroclinicity response. Differences in shortwave feedbacks statistically explain about 50 % of the inter-model spread in CMIP 5 jet shifts for our set of models, demonstrating the importance of constraining radiative feedbacks for accurate projections of circulation changes...|$|R
