[...] He reported before taking off that he would fly towards Washington and then steer a <b>compass</b> <b>course</b> from there. While flying over the Pinelands of southern New Jersey amidst thunderstorms, he crashed into the woods. [...] Investigators from Fort Monmouth conducted the accident probe to determine what happened.

2500|$|Nolan {{figured they}} had missed Silver Lake {{and they had}} no choice but the set a <b>compass</b> <b>course</b> back to Double Lakes. There was no sign of the men sent out for water. Nolan figured his {{position}} some [...] north-west of Double Lakes. He knew for a fact that water was there. Now the Comanche were forgotten and the primary struggle was for survival. The hunters disagreed and the expedition began to break up. Nolan argued the best course was to stay together. The hunters strode off then went their different ways focusing on their own goals for survival. Amazingly the hunters still had two quart bottles of [...] "high-proof brandy." [...] They divided it and went their ways. The smartest ones dipped a cloth to moisten the lips and to inhale its vapors and so refreshed they moved onward into the wilderness.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{researchers}} believe that the Electra ran out of fuel while searching for Howland Island and that Earhart and Noonan ditched at sea. The plane would have carried enough fuel to reach Howland with some extra to spare. The extra fuel would cover some contingencies such as headwinds and searching for Howland. The plane could fly a <b>compass</b> <b>course</b> toward Howland through the night. In the morning, the time of apparent sunrise would allow the plane to determine its line of position (a sun line that ran 157–337). From that line, the plane could determine how much further it must travel before reaching a parallel sun line that ran through Howland. At 6:14 AM Itasca time, Earhart estimated they were 200 miles away from Howland. As the plane closed with Howland, it {{expected to be in}} radio contact with Itasca. With the radio contact, the plane should be able to use radio direction finding (RDF) to head directly for the Itasca and Howland. Unfortunately, the plane was not receiving a radio signal from Itasca, so it would be unable to determine an RDF bearing to the ship. Although Itasca was receiving HF radio signals from the plane, it did not have HF RDF equipment, so it could not determine a bearing to the plane. The communications going to the plane were almost non-existent. Consequently, the plane was not directed to Howland; it was left on its own with little fuel. Presumably, the plane reached the parallel sun line and started searching for Howland on that line of position. At 7:42 AM, Earhart reported, [...] "We must be on you, but cannot see you – but gas is running low. Have been unable to reach you by radio. We are flying at 1,000 feet." [...] At 8:43 AM, Earhart reported, [...] "We are on the line 157 337. We will repeat this message. We will repeat this on 6210 kilocycles. Wait." ...|$|E

60|$|Now Deviation is the {{variation}} in the needle caused by the distribution of iron on board of ship. This purely local variation I derived from the deviation card of my standard compass and then applied to the Correct Magnetic Course. The result was the <b>Compass</b> <b>Course.</b> And yet, not yet. My standard compass was amidships on the companionway. My steering compass was aft, in the cockpit, near the wheel. When the steering compass pointed west-by-south three- quarters-south (the steering course), the standard compass pointed west-one-half-north, which was certainly not the steering course. I kept the Snark up till she was heading west-by-south-three-quarters- south on the standard compass, which gave, on the steering compass, south-west-by-west.|$|E
60|$|In {{signalling}} by {{the navy}} code, the sentence {{to be sent}} is looked up in the code-book and its corresponding number is obtained. This number is never more than four figures, {{on account of the}} necessity of setting the signal with the least delay. The number having been obtained, the quartermaster in charge of the signal-chest proceeds to bend the flags representing the numerals to the signal halliards, so as to read from the top down. These flags represent the numerals from one to nine and cipher, and there is a triangular pennant termed a repeater, which is used in a combination where one or more numerals recur. The numbers refer to those found in the general signal-book, in which are printed all the words, phrases, and sentences necessary to frame an order, make an inquiry, indicate a geographical position, or signal a <b>compass</b> <b>course.</b> Answering, interrogatory, preparatory, and geographical pennants form part of this code; also telegraph, danger, despatch, and quarantine flags.|$|E
60|$|But {{the immense}} {{thing about him}} was the power with which he ruled. Oolong Atoll was one hundred and forty miles in circumference. One steered by <b>compass</b> <b>course</b> in its lagoon. It was {{populated}} by five thousand Polynesians, all strapping men and women, many of them standing six feet in height and weighing {{a couple of hundred}} pounds. Oolong was two hundred and fifty miles from the nearest land. Twice a year a little schooner called to collect copra. The one white man on Oolong was McAllister, petty trader and unintermittent guzzler; and he ruled Oolong and its six thousand savages with an iron hand. He said come, and they came, go, and they went. They never questioned his will nor judgment. He was cantankerous as only an aged Scotchman can be, and interfered continually in their personal affairs. When Nugu, the king's daughter, wanted to marry Haunau {{from the other end of}} the atoll, her father said yes; but McAllister said no, and the marriage never came off. When the king wanted to buy a certain islet in the lagoon from the chief priest, McAllister said no. The king was in debt to the Company to the tune of 180,000 cocoanuts, and until that was paid he was not to spend a single cocoanut on anything else.|$|E

40|$|Bird {{migration}} and orientation at high latitudes are {{of special interest}} because of the difficulties associated with different compass systems in polar areas {{and because of the}} considerable differences between flight routes conforming to loxodromes (rhumblines) or orthodromes (great circle routes). Regular and widespread east-north-east migration of birds from the northern tundra of Siberia towards North America across the Arctic Ocean (without landmark influences) were recorded by ship-based tracking radar studies in July and August. Field observations indicated that waders, including species such as Phalaropusfulicarius and Calidris melanotos, dominated, but also terns and skuas may have been involved. Analysis of flight directions in relation to the wind showed that these movements are not caused by wind drift. Assuming possible orientation principles based on celestial or geomagnetic cues, different flight trajectories across the Arctic Ocean were calculated: geographical loxodromes, sun compass routes, magnetic loxodromes and magnetoclinic routes. The probabilities of these four alternatives are evaluated on the basis of both the availability of required orientation cues and the predicted flight paths. This evaluation supports orientation along sun compass routes. Because of the longitudinal time displacement sun compass routes show gradually changing <b>compass</b> <b>courses</b> in close agreement with orthodromes. It is suggested that an important migration link between Siberia and North American stopover sites 1000 - 2500 km apart across the Arctic Ocean has evolved based on sun compass orientation along orthodrome-like routes...|$|R

5000|$|The {{concept of}} the {{position}} angle is inherited from nautical navigation on the oceans, where the optimum <b>compass</b> <b>course</b> is the course from a known position [...] to a target position [...] with minimum effort.

A more complete picture of the events could be obtained by Voyage Data Recorder (VDR) data if available and maintained on board for details of {{the movement of the}} ship, voice communication and radar pictures during the accidents. However, VDR data are not maintained due to the limited twelve hours storage by IMO requirement.|$|R
5000|$|With the {{stand-up}} of Air Combat Command in 1992, {{the school}} {{embarked on a}} dramatic shift from its 43-year focus exclusively on fighter aviation, dropping the [...] "fighter" [...] from its title and becoming the [...] "Air Force Weapons School." [...] The change {{was much more than}} symbolic with the activation of the B-52 and B-1 Divisions that year. Rescue helicopters joined the school with the HH-60 Division in 1995 while the F-111 retired. That year also saw the addition of RC-135 RIVET JOINT and EC-130 <b>COMPASS</b> CALL <b>courses</b> to the CCO Division.

40|$|The use of {{celestial}} or geomagnetic orientation cues can lead migratory birds along different migration routes during the migratory journeys, e. g. great circle routes (approximate), geographic or magnetic loxodromes. Orientation cage experiments {{have indicated that}} migrating birds are capable of detecting magnetic compass information at high northern latitudes even at very steep angles of inclination. However, starting a migratory journey at high latitudes and following a constant magnetic course often leads towards the North Magnetic Pole, {{which means that the}} usefulness of magnetic compass orientation at high latitudes may be questioned. Here, we compare possible long-distance migration routes of three species of passerine migrants breeding at high northern latitudes. The initial directions were based on orientation cage experiments performed under clear skies and simulated overcast and from release experiments under natural overcast skies. For each species we simulated possible migration routes (geographic loxodrome, magnetic loxodrome and sun compass route) by extrapolating from the initial directions and assessing a fixed orientation according to different compass mechanisms in order to investigate what orientation cues the birds most likely use when migrating southward in autumn. Our calculations show that none of the compass mechanisms (assuming fixed orientation) can explain the migration routes followed by night-migrating birds from their high Nearctic breeding areas to the wintering sites further south. This demonstrates that orientation along the migratory routes of arctic birds (and possibly other birds as well) must be a complex process, involving different orientation mechanisms as well as changing <b>compass</b> <b>courses.</b> We propose that birds use a combination of several compass mechanisms during a migratory journey with each of them being of a greater or smaller importance {{in different parts of the}} journey, depending on environmental conditions. We discuss reasons why birds developed the capability to use magnetic compass information at high northern latitudes even though following these magnetic courses for any longer distance will lead them along totally wrong routes. Frequent changes and recalibrations of the magnetic compass direction during the migratory journey are suggested as a possible solution...|$|R
60|$|In {{a minute}} or so the {{drumming}} in my ears grew less violent. Dalmahoy bent over the aëronaut, who was bleeding at the nose and now began to breathe stertorously. Sheepshanks had fallen into placid slumber. I kept the valve open until we descended into a stratum of fog--from which, no doubt, the Lunardi had lately risen: the moisture collected here would account for its congelated coat of silver. By and by, still without rising, we were quit of the fog, and the moon swept the hollow beneath us, rescuing solitary scraps and sheets of water and letting them slip again like imprehensible ghosts. Small fiery eyes opened and shut on us; cressets of flame on factory chimneys, more and more frequent. I studied the <b>compass.</b> Our <b>course</b> lay south-by-west. But our whereabouts? Dalmahoy, being appealed to, suggested Glasgow: and thenceforward I let him alone. Byfield snored on.|$|R
50|$|Controls {{should be}} {{moderately}} difficult. Navigation {{should not be}} primarily along paths. A <b>compass</b> is necessary. <b>Course</b> choice is actively encouraged. However, every control should be within 100m of an attack point, or obvious feature, and beyond the control should be a linear catch feature, so that the runner knows when s/he has gone too far. On {{no more than two}} legs should navigation rely solely on compass and counting paces. Orange course are often perceived as much more difficult than yellow. Once you can reliably complete orange courses, you have learned the basic skill.|$|R

Cadets learn to use and plot grid and magnetic bearings to understand the three different types of north, to account for deviation of the grid-magnetic angle, to understand contour lines and more advanced conventional signs and the preparation of route cards. Once cadets are experienced in Map and Compass, they are taught how to lead expeditions, which also included their knowledge of fieldcraft.|$|E

6000|$|To THE EDITOR: Only last week, while {{crossing}} the Equator (W. 26-15), I {{became aware of}} a furious and irregular cannonading some fifteen or twenty knots S. 4 E. Descending to the 500 ft. level, I found a party of Transylvanian tourists engaged in exploding scores of the largest pattern atmospheric bombs (A. B. C. standard) and, in the intervals of their pleasing labours, firing bow and stern smoke-ring swivels. This orgie--I can give it no other name--went on {{for at least two}} hours, and naturally produced violent electric derangements. My <b>compasses,</b> of <b>course,</b> were thrown out, my bow was struck twice, and I received two brisk shocks from the lower platform-rail. On remonstrating, I was told that these [...] "professors" [...] were engaged in scientific experiments. The extent of their [...] "scientific" [...] knowledge, may be judged {{by the fact that they}} expected to produce (I give their own words) [...] "a little blue sky" [...] if [...] "they went on long enough." [...] This in the heart of the Doldrums at 450 feet! I have no objection to any amount of blue sky in its proper place (it can be found at the 4000 level for practically twelve months out of the year), but I submit, with all deference to the educational needs of Transylvania, that [...] "skylarking" [...] in the centre of a main-travelled road where, at the best of times, electricity literally drips off one's stanchions and screw blades, is unnecessary. When my friends had finished, the road was seared, and blown, and pitted with unequal pressure layers, spirals, vortices, and readjustments for at least an hour. I pitched badly twice in an upward rush--solely due to these diabolical throw-downs--that came near to wrecking my propeller. Equatorial work at low levels is trying enough in all conscience without the added terrors of scientific hooliganism in the Doldrums.|$|R
40|$|A {{mathematical}} instrument {{can sometimes}} {{be turned into a}} weapon, as will be argued here with the particular way Cardano and Ferrari used a compass {{in the context of the}} well-known polemic pitting Tartaglia against Cardano (1546 - 1548). Scholarship on Cardano’s mathematics is centred above all on diverse approaches to algebra; in this paper, however, an examination of the role of instruments in geometry offers a novel perspective on the divergence between the autodidact Tartaglia and his university-trained opponents. In fact, Tartaglia proposed the challenge of solving a number of Euclidean propositions by means of straight-edge and ‘fixed compass’ – that is, a compass set to a single, fixed opening. The use of such a fixed compass would likely have been most familiar to Tartaglia given his awareness of the techniques used by artisans and painters. In response to this challenge, Cardano and his pupil Ferrari showed how to reconstruct what they claimed to be all of Euclidean geometry (‘E così è provato tutto Euclide’ according to Ferrari) by invoking only a single fixed opening of the <b>compass.</b> Of <b>course,</b> their argument (in the Cartelli di matematica disfida and De subtilitate) offered a lot more mathematics than what was strictly ‘necessary’ for artisans. How should this type of answer be interpreted in a polemic context? In what way could it be seen as an attempt by Cardano and Ferrari to humiliate Tartaglia and deliberately show off their academic superiority? On the other hand, why did they label their work a ‘useless subtlety’? Apparently, neither Cardano nor his contemporaries were aware of having reached a very interesting result, at least seen from a retrospective mathematical point of view, because actually this research was appreciated anew only by 18 th- and 19 th-century geometers such as Mascheroni, Steiner and Poncelet...|$|R
