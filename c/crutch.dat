5|$|Wail al-Shehri, {{his brother}} Waleed, and Satam al-Suqami arrived {{together}} at Logan Airport at 06:45 {{on the morning}} of September 11, 2001. Upon check-in, all three men were selected by the Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System (CAPPS) for further screening of their checked baggage. As the CAPPS was only for luggage, the three hijackers did not undergo any extra scrutiny at the passenger security checkpoint. One of the five Globe Aviation security screeners on-duty later reported that either Wail or Waleed had been using a <b>crutch</b> when they passed through security, and that the <b>crutch</b> had been X-rayed as per regulations.|$|E
5|$|Daniel Sousa (portrayed by Enver Gjokaj) is a {{war veteran}} and agent with the SSR who {{experiences}} prejudice due to his crippled leg, for which he uses a <b>crutch</b> to support himself. Sousa's own investigation leads to him discovering Carter's status as a traitor. His relationship with Carter becoming complicated, Sousa accepts the position of chief of the Los Angeles SSR office to get some distance from her, and eventually begins a new relationship with Violet. However, Violet leaves Sousa when she discovers that he still has feelings for Carter; Sousa eventually begins a relationship with Carter, once they defeat Whitney Frost together.|$|E
5|$|Mason {{had long}} battled against Alexandria merchants who he felt unfairly {{dominated}} the county court, {{if only because}} they could more easily get to the courthouse. In 1789, he drafted legislation to move the courthouse {{to the center of}} the county, though it did not pass in his lifetime. In 1798, the legislature passed an authorizing act, and the courthouse opened in 1801. Most of those at Gunston Hall, both family and slaves, fell ill during the summer of 1792, experiencing chills and fever; when those subsided, Mason caught a chest cold. When Jefferson visited Gunston Hall on October 1, 1792, he found Mason, long a martyr to gout, needing a <b>crutch</b> to walk, though still sound in mind and memory. Additional ailments, possibly pneumonia, set in. Less than a week after Jefferson's visit, on October 7, George Mason died at Gunston Hall, and was subsequently buried on the estate, within sight of the house he had built and of the Potomac River.|$|E
5000|$|A {{person with}} a non-weight bearing injury {{generally}} performs a [...] "swing-to" [...] gait: lifting the affected leg, the user places both <b>crutches</b> in front of himself, and then swings his uninjured leg to meet the <b>crutches.</b> A similar [...] "swing-through" [...] gait is when the both legs are advanced {{in front of the}} <b>crutches</b> rather than at the next to the <b>crutches.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In {{comparison}} to axillary <b>crutches,</b> forearm <b>crutches</b> have many advantages. Prescribed to both younger patients {{as well as}} adults, they spread {{the burden of the}} weight across the entire forearm rather than concentrating it in the wrist, which is beneficial for those with weak wrists or arthritis. Forearm <b>crutches</b> have a greater initial learning curve but they also allow for greater control of movement. [...] "They also allow for a greater variety of walking styles and gaits, and are more stable on rough or uneven terrain." [...] Forearm <b>crutches</b> also encourage good posture in users in {{comparison to}} axillary <b>crutches.</b> Forearm <b>crutches</b> require more upper body strength than typical axillary crutches; they are a great prescription for patients who will need an assistive device for a long-term period due to the upper body strength needed. Therefore, as the patient uses the forearm <b>crutches,</b> upper body strength is continually strengthened. They are also more convenient than other types of <b>crutches</b> due to the smaller size.|$|R
5000|$|... "Evidence from an Egyptian carving {{dating back}} to 2830 BC {{suggests}} that <b>crutches</b> have been used {{at least since the}} pharaohs ruled Egypt 5,000 years ago." [...] In 1917, Emile Schlick patented the first commercially produced crutch; the design consisted of a walking stick with an upper arm support. Later, A.R. Lofstrand, Jr. developed the first <b>crutches</b> with a height-adjustable feature making the <b>crutches</b> customizable. Through time, the design of <b>crutches</b> haven't changed much such that the classic design still is most commonly used. However, some modern inventor's have worked to develop innovative designs of this ancient assistive device in hopes to better address different types of patients.In 1997, forearm <b>crutches</b> got a boost when President Bill Clinton started wearing them after tearing his right quadriceps tendon. He called the forearm <b>crutches</b> his [...] "Stealth" [...] <b>crutches.</b> In a news conference, Clinton said, [...] "I think they were developed as an offshoot of B-2 technology... I like them quite a lot." ...|$|R

25|$|In many yeshivas {{students}} are discouraged {{from using the}} Schottenstein elucidation of the Talmud because it {{is viewed as a}} <b>crutch</b> for students who wish to avoid in depth study of the original texts (as ArtScroll warns in the introduction to the work).|$|E
40|$|Leg amputees who can’t use {{prostheses}} {{and patients}} with arthritis are often dependent on <b>crutches.</b> Their chronic use can exert significant friction forces. The palmar skin will respond by forming a hyperkeratotic callus. We {{report for the}} first time unilateral palmar callus formation caused by friction from using <b>crutches.</b> Another possible adverse effect is the triggering of irritant contact dermatitis by the handholes of <b>crutches.</b> We report two cases with hand dermatitis due to the chronic dependence on <b>crutches</b> and discuss treatment options...|$|R
50|$|Plastic Frames: Plastic frames must be {{thick enough}} for <b>crutches</b> to be {{attached}} or embedded into the frame. Too-thin plastic frames {{will not work}} for Ptosis <b>crutches.</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>Crutching</b> {{has to be}} {{repeated}} at regular intervals as the wool grows continuously. Frequent <b>crutching</b> of Merinos reduces the incidence of flystrike, {{but not as much}} as mulesing.|$|R
25|$|In 2008 Tate starred as Michelle, a {{promiscuous}} mathematics teacher, in David Eldridge's Under The Blue Sky at the Duke of York's Theatre, London, alongside Francesca Annis and Nigel Lindsay.

25|$|After {{the neighbors}} have {{left and the}} kings are resting, the mother {{attempts}} to steal for her son some of the kings' gold that was meant for the Christ Child ("All That Gold"). She is thwarted by the kings' page ("Thief! Thief!"). When Amahl wakes to find the page grabbing his mother, he attacks him ("Don't You Dare!"). Seeing Amahl's defense {{of his mother and}} understanding the motives for the attempted theft, King Melchior says she may keep the gold as the Holy Child will not need earthly power or wealth to build his kingdom ("Oh, Woman, You Can Keep That Gold"). The mother says she has waited all her life for such a king and asks the kings to take back the gold. She wishes to send a gift but has nothing to send. Amahl, too, has nothing to give the Child except his <b>crutch</b> ("Oh, No, Wait"). When he offers it to the kings, his leg is miraculously healed ("I Walk, Mother"). With permission from his mother, he leaves with the kings to see the Child and give his <b>crutch</b> in thanks for being healed.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} options {{available}} to prevent infestation. Many of the precursors drawing the flies initially are sanitary problems which is where control measures are directed. Drenching, shearing or <b>crutching</b> are some basic procedures that can be done. <b>Crutching</b> is the trimming of excess wool from the breech area, and the timing of both shearing and <b>crutching</b> is critical in {{reducing the amount of}} flystrike.|$|R
25|$|Cerebral palsy has {{affected}} humans since antiquity. A decorated grave marker dating {{from around the}} 15th to 14th century BCE shows a figure with one small leg and using a <b>crutch,</b> possibly due to cerebral palsy. The oldest likely physical evidence of the condition comes from the mummy of Siptah, an Egyptian Pharaoh who ruled from about 1196 to 1190BCE and died at about 20 years of age. The presence of cerebral palsy has been suspected due to his deformed foot and hands.|$|E
25|$|Shortly before {{ordering}} the XF11C-1, the Navy {{had bought a}} company-owned Model 64A demonstrator. This had a Wright R-1820-78 Cyclone engine, slightly longer main landing-gear legs carrying wheels with low-pressure tires, a tailwheel {{in place of the}} tailskid, fabric-covered control surfaces on the tail, and external provision for underwing racks for light bombs as well as an under-fuselage hardpoint for either a 50gal (189l) fuel tank or the <b>crutch</b> that would swing a bomb clear of the propeller disc before release in a dive-bombing attack.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fourth}} match, Kane (accompanied by Lita) faced Viscera (accompanied by the WWE Women's Champion Trish Stratus). Kane's early {{attempts}} to take Viscera {{off his feet}} resulted in Kane being knocked down. Viscera then was clotheslined {{out of the ring}} by Kane. Trish tried to hit Kane with a steel chair, but Lita hit her with a <b>crutch.</b> Viscera then executed a Chokebomb on Kane, but only got a two count. Kane then came back and hit a big boot and a chokeslam to get the pinfall. Trish then verbally slammed Viscera, who responded by bear hugging and splashing Trish, who was then taken out on a stretcher.|$|E
50|$|<b>Crutches</b> {{are limited}} to what type of frames they can be placed on. Both metal and plastic frames can be used, but may have limitations. A skilled {{craftsman}} can successfully install Ptosis eye <b>crutches</b> to almost any frame. The upper eyewire must {{be close to the}} orbit of the eyelid. Frames with large or small B measurements may be difficult to work with for Ptosis <b>crutches.</b>|$|R

25|$|On May 8, 1911 at New York, Cleghorn married Evelyn Irene Mabie, {{whom he had}} met whilst {{playing with}} the Wanderers. He was arrested in 1918 for beating his wife with a <b>crutch</b> while he was {{recovering}} from his ankle injuries. The couple divorced in 1921, after Sprague was found by his wife with another woman after she had reported him as missing. Cleghorn was also ordered by a judge to pay an alimony of $1000 per month to his ex-wife. Cleghorn later remarried twice, with his second marriage also ending in divorce. His third wife, Vivian Goudreau, predeceased him on December 18, 1943.|$|E
25|$|In 1951, NBC {{commissioned}} Italian-American composer Gian Carlo Menotti {{to compose}} the first opera ever written for television; Menotti {{came up with}} Amahl and the Night Visitors, a 45-minute work for which he wrote both music and libretto, about a disabled shepherd boy who meets the Three Wise Men and is miraculously cured when he offers his <b>crutch</b> to the newborn Christ Child. It was such a stunning success that it was repeated every year on NBC from 1951 to 1966, when a dispute between Menotti and NBC ended the broadcasts. However, by 1978, Menotti and NBC had patched things up, and an all-new production of the opera, filmed partly on location in the Middle East, was telecast that year.|$|E
25|$|When Rose {{returned}} to the company perimeter with the wounded soldier, he was sprayed with shrapnel from a B-40 rocket propelled grenade (RPG) in his back and leg, severely crippling his foot. For {{the rest of the}} mission, he used a stick as a <b>crutch,</b> continuing to treat the wounded while ignoring his own wounds. A MEDEVAC helicopter was later called in to evacuate the company's many wounded, but was unable to land in the small opening where the company was located. Rose stood up, fully exposed to the heavy enemy fire, and attempted to pass the wounded up to the hovering helicopter's crew. However, the intensity of the enemy fire forced the pilot to abort the mission, and the helicopter, severely damaged, crashed a few kilometers away.|$|E

50|$|Ptosis <b>crutches</b> (also {{known as}} eye <b>crutches)</b> are a non-surgical {{solution}} to Ptosis, {{also known as}} drooping eyelid syndrome. Affected eyes {{do not have the}} ability to open and close properly. In severe cases, a person is not able to open the affected eyelid. Ptosis eye <b>crutches</b> are tools installed to existing eyewear that support the affected eyelid, enabling the eyelid to stay open and allowing an individual to see.|$|R
5000|$|After {{her legs}} were {{crippled}} due to injuries inflicted by gunfire, Night Thrasher designed and built a special pair of combat-capable <b>crutches</b> and leg braces for her. Thrash designed the <b>crutches</b> to include both a hidden electric taser that can emit electrical charges to stun an adversary, and a slim anesthetic needle injector that delivered paralytic chemicals. The <b>crutches</b> are also equipped with [...] "smoke gas" [...] and metal firing pellets.|$|R
25|$|The eighth {{match was}} between the team of Tommy Rich and Ricky Morton (accompanied by Robert Gibson) and The Fabulous Freebirds (Jimmy Garvin and Michael Hayes) (accompanied by Little Richard Marley). Morton and Rich had the early advantage. Morton sent Hayes outside the ring, where Gibson {{attacked}} him, and Morton sent him into the ringpost. Morton applied the figure four leglock on Hayes as Rich applied the figure four leglock on Garvin. Morton and Rich had the advantage until Hayes performed a bulldog to Morton. Rich and Garvin fought as Marley was about to attack Morton's knee from the top turnbuckle. Gibson hit Marley with his <b>crutch,</b> and Marley fell on Garvin. Morton then pinned Garvin with a roll-up to win the match. After the match, the Fabulous Freebirds attacked Marley and Gibson.|$|E
25|$|Breathing during {{locomotion}} {{has been}} studied in three species, and they show different patterns. Adult female green sea turtles do not breathe as they <b>crutch</b> along their nesting beaches. They hold their breath during terrestrial locomotion and breathe in bouts as they rest. North American box turtles breathe continuously during locomotion, and the ventilation cycle is not coordinated with the limb movements. This is because they use their abdominal muscles to breathe during locomotion. The last species to have been studied is the red-eared slider, which also breathes during locomotion, but takes smaller breaths during locomotion than during small pauses between locomotor bouts, indicating {{that there may be}} mechanical interference between the limb movements and the breathing apparatus. Box turtles have also been observed to breathe while completely sealed up inside their shells.|$|E
25|$|A Tianjin Airlines Embraer 190 jet {{was leaving}} on its daily route from Hotan Airport to Ürümqi Diwopu International Airport at 12:25 pm (04:25 Greenwich Mean Time) with 92 {{passengers}} and nine crew. The suspected hijackers, six Uyghur men aged 20–36 {{from the city}} of Kashgar, boarded the aircraft without notice. Surveillance video showed the suspects feigning disability to bypass airport security; one suspect hid his aluminum pipe weapon inside his <b>crutch.</b> The hijackers donned staff uniforms and split into two parties of three in the front and back of the plane. One of the suspects said they aimed to fly the aircraft out of the country to wage holy war; China has previously raised concerns that Uyghur militants are linking up to their Islamist counterparts in Pakistan.|$|E
50|$|Docking (removing) sheep's tails {{has much}} the same {{benefits}} for the sheep as <b>crutching.</b> While this procedure reduces the care needed to keep wool clean, regular <b>crutching</b> is still required for the reasons outlined above.|$|R

50|$|<b>Crutching</b> is {{generally}} {{carried out in}} shearing sheds, using shearers and the same tools as for shearing the entire fleece, as <b>crutching</b> is simply shearing {{only a portion of}} the animal. Blade shears may be used, especially where an individual sheep is particularly dirty, or flystruck. Generally, whole flocks are treated together. A mechanical shearing handpiece is used, and the crutchers sit the sheep between their legs and shear the required portion of the sheep, leaving the main fleece to continue growing. There are also many varieties of <b>crutching</b> cradles which allow the sheep to be <b>crutched</b> with less physical strain to the operator.|$|R
