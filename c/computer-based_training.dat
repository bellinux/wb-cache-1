The aircraft are generally crewed by two pilots and a loadmaster, and are tasked with medium tactical airlift in Australia and overseas, transporting troops and cargo, and conducting medical evacuation, search-and-rescue, and airdrop missions. No.285 Squadron manages the full-flight mission simulator (FFMS) used to convert aircrew to the C-130J, {{as well as}} decommissioned Hercules airframes used for loadmaster training. It also employs <b>computer-based</b> <b>training</b> tools and is allocated flying aircraft from No.37 Squadron when required. As well as training aircrew new to the C-130J, the FFMS (maintained by CAE Australia) is employed for existing aircrew to maintain their currency.|$|E

40|$|Auditory {{training}} involves active {{listening to}} auditory stimuli and aims {{to improve performance}} in auditory tasks. As such, auditory training is a potential intervention {{for the management of}} people with hearing loss. Objective This systematic review (PROSPERO 2011 : CRD 42011001406) evaluated the published evidence-base for the efficacy of individual <b>computer-based</b> auditory <b>training</b> to improve speech intelligibility, cognition and communication abilities in adults with hearing loss, with or without hearing aids or cochlear implants. Methods A systematic search of eight databases and key journals identified 229 articles published since 1996, 13 of which met the inclusion criteria. Data were independently extracted and reviewed by the two authors. Study quality was assessed using ten pre-defined scientific and intervention-specific measures. Results Auditory training resulted in improved performance for trained tasks in 9 / 10 articles that reported on-task outcomes. Although significant generalisation of learning was shown to untrained measures of speech intelligibility (11 / 13 articles), cognition (1 / 1 articles) and self-reported hearing abilities (1 / 2 articles), improvements were small and not robust. Where reported, compliance with <b>computer-based</b> auditory <b>training</b> was high, and retention of learning was shown at post-training follow-ups. Published evidence was of very-low to moderate study quality. Conclusions Our findings demonstrate that published evidence for the efficacy of individual <b>computer-based</b> auditory <b>training</b> for adults with hearing loss is not robust and therefore cannot be reliably used to guide intervention at this time. We identify a need for high-quality evidence to further examine the efficacy of <b>computer-based</b> auditory <b>training</b> for people with hearing loss...|$|R

Outside the Southern Region blinds were set to 00 or 0000, and discs/lamps to the former express passenger code. Roller blinds were later blanked or plated over to show two dots and new trains introduced for service outside the Southern Region after this time usually had no train reporting number display equipment. Many trains intended to run over Southern Region lines were designed to display the numeric route-code portion of the train reporting number, which they still display, usually as a dot-matrix display.|$|R

A good CBST system includes not only good training strategies but also effective feedback design. Feedback in the motor skill domain via CBST may be synthetically designed to allow athletes to practise in a more effective way, and enhance their skill acquisition. Existing designs lack pedagogical elements. To bridge the gap, we propose a framework for the design of pedagogically-informed feedback based on; learning transactions, competence, cybernetics, and behaviourism. We present the design of effective feedback in the motor skill domain which focuses on the requirements and analysis stage...|$|R
