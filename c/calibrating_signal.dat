The compressive sensing paradigm requires an accurate model of the analog front-end to enable correct signal reconstruction in the digital domain. In practice, hardware devices such as filters deviate from their desired design behavior due to component variations. Existing reconstruction algorithms are sensitive to such deviations, which fall into the more general category of measurement matrix perturbations. This paper proposes a model-based technique that aims to calibrate filter model mismatches to facilitate improved signal reconstruction quality. The mismatch {{is considered to be}} an additive error in the discretized impulse response. We identify the error by sampling a known <b>calibrating</b> <b>signal,</b> enabling least-squares estimation of the impulse response error. The error estimate and the known system model are used to calibrate the measurement matrix.

30|$|While satellite-based {{navigation}} is well consolidated {{for open}} sky scenarios, localization in harsh environments (e.g., indoor or in urban canyons) {{is still an}} open issue that requires complementary wireless networks. Cellular systems, local/personal area networks, ad hoc, and wireless-sensor networks can be configured to support localization functionality. Indoor environments, however, are particularly challenging because of severe multipath and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation. In this context, advanced signal processing algorithms must be employed in order to guarantee positioning robustness, such as NLOS identification and mitigation, fusion of data from different sources, and Bayesian methods to enclose any a priori information (e.g., dynamic models for mobile positioning). An important area of research is cooperative localization, {{which is expected to}} significantly improve both accuracy and coverage by exploiting all the available measurements on a peer-to-peer basis; efficient protocols and procedures have to be designed to minimize communication overheads and energy consumption. Measurement campaigns are essential for <b>calibrating</b> <b>signal</b> models and testing localization algorithms. A valuable tool for benchmarking algorithms is also provided by fundamental performance bounds, which are being actively analyzed as guidelines for the design of efficient positioning systems.|$|E

The radio wave reflectivity of soil is strongly correlated to soil moisture content. Therefore, if {{we were able to}} measure the reflectivity, {{we might be able to}} estimate the soil moisture content. In this preliminary study, we analyze direct signal data from the satellites to investigate and verify communication channels in frequency range of interest and their characteristics (bandwidth, pattern, etc.). The analysis of direct signal data is also used for <b>calibrating</b> <b>signal</b> collection systems and compensating for the subtle differences of systems. After comparing the satellite geometry and spectrum from raw signal, we verified that ORBCOMM has 13 channels in our frequency range of interest. It was also verified that among these 13 channels, the channel with center frequency at 137. 56 MHz is a public channel shared by all satellites and is not suitable for reflectivity computation in that multiple satellites could be in sight by our antenna and the signal reflecting region cannot be determined. In our long duration (~ 12 hours) analysis, we observed the visible duration and period of the satellites. Conclusively, using ORBCOMM communication signal for sensing the soil moisture is viable.

By using thresholds obtained from multiyear, multisite EARLINET (European Aerosol Research Lidar Network) measurements, four aerosol classes (small; large, spherical; large, non-spherical; mixed, partly non-spherical) and several cloud classes (liquid, ice) are defined. Thus, particles are classified by their physical features (shape and size) instead of by source. The methodology is applied to 2 months of continuous observations (24  h a day, 7 days a week) with the multiwavelength-Raman-polarization lidar PollyXT during the High-Definition Clouds and Precipitation for advancing Climate Prediction (HD(CP) 2) Observational Prototype Experiment (HOPE) in spring 2013.

50|$|A {{hot wire}} {{mass airflow sensor}} determines the mass of air flowing into the engine’s air intake system. The theory of {{operation}} of the hot wire mass airflow sensor {{is similar to that}} of the hot wire anemometer (which determines air velocity). This is achieved by heating a wire suspended in the engine’s air stream, like a toaster wire, with either a constant voltage over the wire or a constant current through the wire. The wire's electrical resistance increases as the wire’s temperature increases, which varies the electrical current flowing through the circuit, according to Ohm's law. When air flows past the wire, the wire cools, decreasing its resistance, which in turn allows more current to flow through the circuit, since the supply voltage is a constant. As more current flows, the wire’s temperature increases until the resistance reaches equilibrium again. The current increase or decrease is proportional to the mass of air flowing past the wire. The integrated electronic circuit converts the proportional measurement into a <b>calibrated</b> <b>signal</b> which is sent to the ECU.|$|R
