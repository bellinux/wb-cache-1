500|$|The {{heart of}} the poem depicts events [...] "if poetry <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>it</b> backwards"– {{soldiers}} {{who died in the}} war coming back to life, [...] "lines and lines of British boys rewind / back to their trenches". [...] The poem imagines [...] "all those thousands dead / are shaking dried mud from their hair / and queuing up for home". [...] Duffy pictures what would have happened to them if they had not died: ...|$|E
500|$|Mark Kirkland was the {{director}} of [...] "The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace". He recalls that when he attended the table-read for the episode, the staff thought it was [...] "hilarious" [...] and they <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>it</b> was [...] "going to be a good one." [...] It was the last episode to be produced during the season nine production run and because it takes several months to complete the production of a single episode, it had to air as a hold-over in the upcoming tenth season. It was decided that [...] "The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace" [...] would be the premiere episode of season ten. As a result, the annual premiere party was held at the Museum of Science and Technology in Los Angeles – it was a tradition for the premiere party {{to be related to the}} premiere episode.|$|E
2500|$|Dyer {{was arrested}} on 4 April and charged with murder. Her {{son-in-law}} Arthur Palmer was charged as an accessory. During April, the Thames was dredged and six more bodies were discovered, including Doris Marmon and Harry Simmons—Dyer's last victims. Each baby had been strangled with white tape, which as she later told the police [...] "was how you <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>it</b> was one of mine".|$|E

2500|$|The video {{opens in}} a Mad Max-esque desert setting, where a posse of {{well-muscled}} girls stands before {{a group of}} somewhat nonplussed boys. At first, they look like they're going to perform for the boys, like the Spice Girls in [...] "Say You'll Be There" [...] or maybe taunt them a bit, like Janet Jackson and her crew in [...] "You Want This". But there's another story here, {{having to do with}} the juxtapositions of the post-apocalyptic environment, the athletic survivor-girls wielding their martial-arts sticks, and the song's lyrics. The lyrics concern Mýa's query to her man, wondering why another girl is calling his phone [...] "after midnight". This caller, narrates Mýa, is [...] "Saying come over / Cause she's all alone / I <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>it</b> was your ex / By your tone." ...|$|E
2500|$|On February 5, 1985, twin {{brothers}} Bill and Bob Clark sighted a 60+ {{foot long}} sea serpent in San Francisco Bay that crashed onto a submerged rocky ledge only 20 {{yards away from}} where {{they were sitting in}} their car. It was around 7:45 a.m. and the water was calm. The Clark brothers were sitting in their car drinking coffee when they noticed a group of seals in the water. Then they noticed what they thought was another seal approach the group. The group of seals began to swim away and one of them headed for the seawall where the Clarks were parked. The seals were followed by the creature and according to Bob, [...] "Bill started saying it was moving strange. He said it was not a seal, it's a snake." [...] Bob continued, [...] "We watched it coming in, undulating in a vertical manner. Where most snakes undulate side to side, this was up and down, creating humps in the water. Bob said, [...] "The seals were leaping through the water in front of it. I think it was going to eat them. It was behind the seals arched above the water line and I <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>it</b> was a large animal when the arch appeared to stay in one spot. I could see the body moving through the arch." [...] The Clarks said the water was so clear that morning they could easily see the creature as it undulated at amazing speed like an uncoiling whip. [...] They both estimated the length of the creature to be at least 60 feet. As it swam over the submerged rocky ledge it stopped dead in its tracks then it appeared to slide a few feet across the water creating a light spray. It apparently got stuck on the rocks. Bob said the animal turned clockwise and exposed its midsection. [...] "It turned over like a corkscrew in midsection. We could see the belly of the animal. It reminded me of an alligator stomach, creamy white, soft leathery looking, but with a tint of yellow in it." [...] He continued saying, [...] "After it twisted over and showed the underbelly, another section behind the underbelly came up about three feet out of the water. I got an excellent view of a fin-type appendage, which opened up like an accordion fan. It stayed up about five seconds, long enough for me to tell my brother, 'Bill, I'm going to look at it as long as I can so I can remember it.' [...] " [...] After it twisted the midsection off of the submerged rocky ledge, Bill said they watched the creature sit [...] "motionless in the water for five or ten seconds". Then it began to swim away, using a [...] "violent, downward thrust of its upper neck which sent a pack of coils backwards towards the midsection. After a few seconds of undulations, the creature moved rapidly, just {{below the surface of the}} water northward toward deeper water in the middle of the Bay." [...] Bill concluded his account by saying, [...] "I don't care if anyone believes me. I know what I saw. It was too mind-blowing and close to me not to say something about it." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "My dear child, if {{you only}} <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> me! <b>It</b> would be, wouldn't it?--it must have been--the subject of some fairy-tale, if fairy-tales were made now, or better still of some Christmas pantomime: 'The Gnome and the Giant.'" ...|$|R
60|$|I was not minded {{to close}} my eyes in slumber until after having heard from the old sailor all he <b>could</b> <b>tell,</b> {{although}} <b>it</b> {{goes without saying that}} I was tired {{enough to be able to}} sleep standing up.|$|R
60|$|So for a {{while the}} battle was toward and yet {{no one could see}} how it went. For what with all that dust and the contending of single champions, no one <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> whether <b>it</b> {{inclined}} to this side or to that.|$|R

60|$|This was {{all that}} the Indian <b>could</b> <b>tell,</b> but <b>it</b> was enough, and Joseph Morris ran back to inform Captain Tanner and the others. Those who were {{sleeping}} were aroused, and each man and boy was assigned to his place of duty.|$|R
5000|$|Their sixth album, Permission to Rock... Denied was {{completed}} but never officially released. In a March 2013 interview with online music zine Punk Globe, Strub {{commented on the}} record stating, [...] "You <b>could</b> still <b>tell</b> <b>it</b> was us, but different." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I don't know. I never <b>could</b> <b>tell.</b> <b>It</b> wasn't that I didn't dote upon you, {{and think}} about you, and feel quite sure that there never could be any other one than you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dearest Clara," [...] he said, {{looking at}} her with more {{tenderness}} than had ever been usual with him, [...] "I think that you had better leave us. I <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>it</b> better to your mother alone." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] the Story Girl {{looked at}} Cecily half reproachfully. [...] "Why couldn't you tell {{it better than}} that? If I had such a dream I <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>it</b> so that {{everybody}} else would {{feel as if they}} had dreamed it, too." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{has been}} in the English army, but he is not an Englishman. He has had a very unfortunate history. I wish that I <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>it</b> to you, but the time is too short, and he does not like to be talked about." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's the truth, sir," [...] said Barrymore. [...] "I {{said that}} it was not my secret and that I <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>it</b> to you. But now you have heard it, and you will see that if there was a plot it was not against you." ...|$|R

60|$|It is {{difficult}} to pass from the enchanted childhood of this eternal child, with its imaginative playing at everything, broken only by fevers whereof the dreams were the nightmares of unconscious genius. He has told of all this as only he <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "And who <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>it,</b> or {{how could}} it be told?

6000|$|... "There {{were two}} other girls with us, both very pretty," [...] replied Abigail, [...] "and {{he was as}} courteous and kindly to them as a man could be to a woman.

6000|$|... "That will do," [...] {{said the}} latter, stiffly.

60|$|There was {{a council}} of war held to {{consider}} what {{it was best to}} do. It was a council of perplexity and despair. Nobody <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> what <b>it</b> was best to do.
