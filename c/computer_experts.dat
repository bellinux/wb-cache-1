25|$|Digital {{documents}} linking to the Ergenekon conspiracy are {{the basis}} of the case against Barış Terkoğlu, Ahmet Şık, Nedim Şener and the other detainees in the OdaTV case. Examinations of the documents conducted by <b>computer</b> <b>experts</b> at Boğaziçi University, Yıldız Technical University, Middle East Technical University and the American data processing company DataDevastation have refuted the validity of the documents and concluded that outside sources targeted the journalists’ computers. Rare and malicious computer viruses, including Autorun-BJ and , allowed the placement of the documents to go unnoticed by the defendants. Another judicial report prepared by the governmental agency Tübitak also confirmed the infection by malicious viruses but couldn't neither confirm nor reject any outside intervention. A second report rejected the journalists' claims on the basis that the documents had been created before the computers were infected. Yet another review of the OdaTV evidence by digital forensics company Arsenal Consulting revealed that local attacks, which required physical access, were responsible for delivery of the incriminating documents to Barış Pehlivan’s OdaTV computer.|$|E

500|$|While {{markedly}} {{different from his}} previous writing, {{in that it is}} not set in an imaginary future with imaginary technologies, Pattern Recognition includes many of his previous elements, including impacts of technology shifts on society, Japanese <b>computer</b> <b>experts</b> and Russian mafia figures. In common with Gibson's previous work, Paul Di Filippo found the following in Pattern Recognition: [...] "the close observation of the culture's bleeding edge; an analysis of the ways technology molds our every moment; the contrasting of boardroom with street; the impossibility and dire necessity of making art in the face of instant co-optation; the damaged loner facing the powers-that-be, for both principle and profit".|$|E

A particular search at 11:33a.m. was for information about Rock Creek Park in The Washington Post [...] "Entertainment Guide," [...] then at 11:34 she clicked a link to bring up a map of the park. Detectives later theorized that she might have met someone at the Pierce-Klingle Mansion which houses the park headquarters. On July 25, 2001, three D.C. police sergeants and 28 police cadets searched along Glover Road in the park but failed to find evidence related to Levy. Later, a second attempt found nothing.|$|E

2500|$|After {{stealing}} the customers' data, cyber-thieves also accessed Adobe's source code repository, likely in mid-August 2013. Because hackers acquired {{copies of the}} source code of Adobe proprietary products, they could find and exploit any potential weaknesses in its security, <b>computer</b> <b>experts</b> warned. Security researcher Alex Holden, chief information security officer of Hold Security, characterized this Adobe breach, which affected Acrobat, ColdFusion and numerous other applications, as [...] "one of the worst in US history". Adobe also announced that hackers stole parts of the source code of Photoshop, which according to commentators could allow programmers to copy its engineering techniques and {{would make it easier}} to pirate Adobe's expensive products.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1959, <b>computer</b> <b>experts</b> from {{industry}} and government were brought together in a two-day conference known as the Conference on Data Systems Languages (CODASYL). Hopper served as a technical consultant to the committee, and many of her former employees served on the short-term committee that defined the new language COBOL (an acronym for COmmon Business-Oriented Language). The new language extended Hopper's FLOW-MATIC language with some ideas from the IBM equivalent, COMTRAN. [...] Hopper's belief that programs should be written in a language that was close to English (rather than in machine code or in languages close to machine code, such as assembly languages) was captured in the new business language, and COBOL went on {{to be the most}} ubiquitous business language to date. Among the members of the committee that worked on COBOL was Mount Holyoke College alumni Jean E. Sammet.|$|E
