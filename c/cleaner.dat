5|$|Cheating, where {{either a}} <b>cleaner</b> {{sometimes}} harms its client, or a predatory species mimics a <b>cleaner,</b> also occurs. Predatory cheating {{is analogous to}} Batesian mimicry, as where a harmless hoverfly mimics a stinging wasp, though with the tables turned. Some genuine <b>cleaner</b> fish, such as gobies and wrasse, have the same colours and patterns, in an example of convergent evolution. Mutual resemblance among <b>cleaner</b> fish is analogous to Mullerian mimicry, as where stinging bees and wasps mimic each other.|$|E
5|$|Cleaning {{symbiosis}} is {{a mutually}} beneficial association between individuals of two species, where one (the <b>cleaner)</b> removes and eats parasites {{and other materials}} {{from the surface of}} the other (the client). Cleaning symbiosis is well-known among marine fish, where some small species of <b>cleaner</b> fish, notably wrasses but also species in other genera, are specialised to feed almost exclusively by cleaning larger fish and other marine animals. Other cleaning symbioses exist between birds and mammals, and in other groups.|$|E

5|$|Mimicry of mutualistic {{species is}} seen in coral reef fish, where the models, certain <b>cleaner</b> fish, are greatly {{disadvantaged}} {{by the presence of}} the mimic. <b>Cleaner</b> fish are the allies of many other species, which allow them to eat their parasites and dead skin in a mutually beneficial cleaning symbiosis. Some allow the <b>cleaner</b> to venture inside their mouths and gill cavities to hunt these parasites. However, one species of <b>cleaner,</b> the bluestreak <b>cleaner</b> wrasse (Labroides dimidiatus), is the unknowing model of a mimetic species, the sabre-toothed blenny (Aspidontus taeniatus). This wrasse, shown in the image cleaning a grouper of the genus Epinephelus, resides in coral reefs in the Indian and the Pacific Oceans, and is recognized by other fishes who then allow it to clean them. Its imposter, a species of blenny, lives in the Indian Ocean and not only looks like it in terms of size and coloration, but even mimics the cleaner's 'dance'. Having fooled its prey into letting its guard down, it then bites it, tearing off scales or a piece of fin before fleeing the scene. Fish grazed upon in this fashion soon learn to distinguish mimic from model, but because the similarity is close between the two they become much more cautious of the model as well, such that both are affected. Due to victims' ability to discriminate between foe and helper, the blennies have evolved close similarity, right down to the regional level.|$|E

5|$|The {{best known}} {{cleaning}} symbioses are among marine fishes, where {{several species of}} small fish, notably of wrasse, are specialised in colour, pattern and behaviour as cleaners, providing a cleaning and ectoparasite removal service to larger, often predatory fish. <b>Cleaner</b> species, {{as shown in the}} table, vary widely in their degree of dependence on their clients. Some are essentially pure obligate symbionts like the <b>cleaner</b> wrasse; some are opportunistic or facultative symbionts, like the orange chromide or some <b>cleaner</b> shrimps; and some, like the oxpeckers, combine a little eating of parasites (beneficial to client) with taking of blood (harmful to client), their favoured food.|$|E

5000|$|Enzyme-based <b>cleaners</b> are {{especially}} useful for biofilm removal. Bacteria are somewhat difficult to remove with traditional alkaline or acid <b>cleaners.</b> [...] Enzyme <b>cleaners</b> {{are more effective}} on biofilms since they work as proteases by breaking down proteins at bacterial attachment sites. They work at maximum efficiency at high pH and at temperatures below 60°C. [...] Enzyme <b>cleaners</b> are an increasingly attractive alternative to traditional chemical <b>cleaners</b> because of biodegradability and other environmental factors, such as reduced wastewater generation and energy savings from using cold water. [...] However, they are typically more expensive than alkaline or acid <b>cleaners.</b>|$|R
5|$|The sabre-toothed blenny (Aspidontus taeniatus) is a predatory blenny, an {{aggressive}} mimic which accurately resembles the bluestreak <b>cleaner</b> wrasse, {{not only in}} colour and pattern, {{but also in the}} ritualised dance the <b>cleaner</b> wrasse makes when potential client fish swim nearby. However, instead of providing the cleaning service that it signals, it bites off pieces of healthy skin, scales and mucus from the host and then swims rapidly away to safety.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In this study, {{performance}} and environmental characteristics of cyclone vacuum <b>cleaners</b> are analyzed and product improvement methods are investigated to minimize environmental {{effect of the}} <b>cleaners</b> using the result. A simplified LCA method is used to analyze environmental characteristics of the cyclone vacuum <b>cleaners.</b> Two cyclone vacuum <b>cleaners</b> with similar specifications are chosen for the experiment. Typical characteristics of cyclone vacuum <b>cleaners</b> such as energy consumption, suction force, noise and temperature are measured and compared. Most environmental effect {{was caused by the}} energy consumption in use phase of life cycle.

40|$|Humans {{are more}} likely to help those who they have {{observed}} helping others previously. Individuals may thus benefit from being altruistic without direct reciprocity of recipients but due to gains in 'image' and associated indirect reciprocity. I suggest, however, that image-scoring individuals may be exploitable by cheaters if pay-offs vary between interactions. I illustrate this point with data on cleaner-client reef fish interactions. I show the following: (i) there is strong variation between <b>cleaners</b> with respect to cheating of clients (i. e. feeding on client tissue instead of parasites); (ii) clients approach <b>cleaners,</b> that they observe cooperating with their current client and avoid <b>cleaners</b> that they observe cheating; (iii) <b>cleaners</b> that cheat frequently are avoided more frequently than more cooperative <b>cleaners</b> (iv) <b>cleaners</b> that cheat frequently behave altruistically towards their smallest client species; (v) altruistic acts are followed by exploitative interactions. Thus, it appears that <b>cleaners</b> indeed have an image score, which selects for cooperative <b>cleaners.</b> However, cheating <b>cleaners</b> use altruism in potentially low-pay-off interactions to deceive and attract image-scoring clients that will be exploited...|$|R
