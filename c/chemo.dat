25|$|Chemotherapy (often {{abbreviated}} to <b>chemo</b> and sometimes CTX or CTx) is {{a category of}} cancer treatment that uses one or more anti-cancer drugs (chemotherapeutic agents) {{as part of a}} standardized chemotherapy regimen.

Chemotherapy {{is one of the major}} categories of the medical discipline specifically devoted to pharmacotherapy for cancer, which is called medical oncology.|$|E

50|$|No Kenyan or Ethiopian {{had won the}} Women's Steeplechase at the World Championships. It became quickly {{obvious that}} was going to change.

She got back up and tried to catch back up to the pack. Hyvin Kiyeng Jepkemoi was the first to fall out the back, passed by Assefa. But Milcah <b>Chemos</b> Cheywa and Lydiah Chepkurui were on the front of train, stringing out the Ethiopians. <b>Chemos,</b> running determined after two successive bronze medals, led out the final lap, with Assefa chasing her teammates. <b>Chemos</b> held her slight lead all the way to the finish. Assefa caught Hiwot Alayew just before the water jump and continued to gain on Chepkurui.

[...] Chemotherapy resistance sometimes develops over time as the tumors adapt and can overcome the toxicity of the <b>chemo</b> medication. [...] "Overcoming chemoresistance has been extensively studied within the past, especially using CDDP-resistant cells. In regard to the potential benefit that drug-resistant cells can be recruited for effective therapy by combining chemotherapy with hyperthermia, it was important to show that chemoresistance against several anticancer drugs (e.g. mitomycin C, anthracyclines, BCNU, melphalan) including CDDP could be reversed at least partially by the addition of heat.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{recipients}} of HSCTs are multiple myeloma or leukemia patients {{who would not}} benefit from prolonged treatment with, or are already resistant to, chemotherapy.

Other conditions treated with stem cell transplants include sickle-cell disease, myelodysplastic syndrome, neuroblastoma, lymphoma, Ewing's sarcoma, desmoplastic small round cell tumor, chronic granulomatous disease and Hodgkin's disease. More recently non-myeloablative, [...] "mini transplant(microtransplantation)," [...] procedures have been developed that require smaller doses of preparative <b>chemo</b> and radiation. This has allowed HSCT to be conducted in the elderly and other patients who would otherwise be considered too weak to withstand a conventional treatment regimen.|$|E
2500|$|Hello Folks, Donna Deegan here. For {{those of}} you who haven't been {{watching}} this past week, where've you been? Seriously, if you haven't had the time to tune in, I have changed my name to, well, my name. So many of you have e-mailed to say [...] "Hey Donna, it's about time!" [...] Well, fortunately the station thought so too. Tim and I have been married for more than five years, and I have been Deegan everywhere but on the air since then. So why now? Well, there is no great strategy here. For some time now the station has been putting together a new look for our news opens, graphics etc. That's a big deal and very expensive so it's not done very often. While making those plans they very graciously asked if I would like to change my on-air name. I talked it over with my kids and with Tim and everyone said [...] "go for it" [...] so I did. That simple. The decision {{had nothing to do with}} my recent recurrence. It will be fun to see if I can actually call myself the correct name every day. Between <b>chemo</b> and my normal space cadet nature, I think the betting pool is in full swing.|$|E
