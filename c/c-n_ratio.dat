30|$|Figure  4 {{also shows}} a {{relationship}} (R 2 [*]=[*] 0.99) between the <b>C-N</b> <b>ratio</b> of food eaten (leaf discs excluding the veins) and feeding rate. The feeding rate decreased with increasing <b>C-N</b> <b>ratio.</b> The {{decline in the}} <b>C-N</b> <b>ratio</b> with decomposition time of the leaf discs is caused by microbial activity and was also observed for alder and beech leaves in the field [[33]]. This microbial activity, called conditioning, {{is an important part}} of leaf litter processing in aquatic ecosystems which increases the palatability of detritus for shredding organisms [[8]]. The literature suggests that aquatic shredders prefer food of lower C-N ratios because the quality is higher resulting in better nutritional status (original reference in [[34]]). However, whether food preference really depends on <b>C-N</b> <b>ratio</b> is unclear, as information in the literature range from no relationship between those two factors at all [[34],[35]] to a strong relationship [[36]]. Nutritional composition is a determining factor of food quality [[37]], and adaptation in feeding activity provides a compensation for sub-optimal composition of available food [[32],[38]].|$|E
40|$|Peepoo, self-sanitising, {{biodegradable}} toilet {{is characterized}} by low carbon to nitrogen (<b>C-N)</b> <b>ratio</b> and low dry matter (DM) content. Principal nutrients (nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P) and potassium (K)) are also not in a balance as required by most crops. It was expected that the mixing of used Peepoos with other organic materials might balance its chemical characteristics. In this thesis, availability and suitability of common organic materials produced in Kenya has been investigated for mixing with used Peepoo bags to obtain a balanced fertilizer product from the crop nutrition aspect. Seven organic residues were selected {{from the list of}} 13 {{on the basis of their}} availability near the processing site in Nairobi. The selected residues were then chemically analyzed for their individual plant nutrient content. The analysis results were used subsequently to simulate the chemical composition of a wide range of Peepoo-Residue mixtures. The evaluation of the theoretical mixtures based on DM content, <b>C-N</b> <b>ratio</b> and NPK ratio showed that the majority of investigated mixtures had DM content below 60 %. Majority of the mixtures showed <b>C-N</b> <b>ratio</b> between 10 - 1 : 1. All the mixtures deviated from the common nutrient uptake ratio of crops (1 : 0. 5 : 1. 4). Composite mixtures with more than 2 ingredients resulted in a balanced fertilizer product. The study concludes and recommends that the composite mixtures with more than two ingredients should be considered for practical processing of Peepoos into a commercial fertilizer product...|$|E

Grain yield per plant of winter wheat and rice declined in both years. The N and S concentrations increased under elevated O- 3 exposure in both years and <b>C-N</b> <b>ratios</b> decreased significantly. The concentrations of K, Ca, Mg, P, Mn, Cu and Zn in winter wheat and the concentrations of Mg, K, Mn and Cu in rice increased. The concentrations of protein, amino acid and lysine in winter wheat and rice increased and the concentration of amylose decreased. The increase in the nutrient concentration was less than the reduction of grain yield in both winter wheat and rice, and, hence, the absolute amount of the nutrients was reduced by elevated O- 3. 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Anaerobic digestion was phase separated in solid state anaerobic digestion reactor, where mostly microbiological hydrolysis and acidogenesis and granular biomass reactor where mostly methanogenesis was performed. The overall process exhibited total solids degradation efficiency between 73. 6 and 80. 4 %. Average specific biogas production was 424 ± 36 L/kg, whereas biomethane production was 230 ± 34 L/kg of brewery spent grain total solids. Granular biomass after adaptation exhibited stabile operation at <b>C-N</b> <b>ratios</b> {{as low as}} 0. 2 – 0. 3, which is rare in anaerobic digestion.

40|$|Climate change {{factors such}} as {{elevated}} carbon dioxide (CO 2) and temperature typically affect carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) dynamics of crop plants {{and the performance of}} insect herbivores. Insect-resistant transgenic plants invest some nutrients to the production of specific toxic proteins [i. e. endotoxins from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) ], which could alter the C–N balance of these plants, especially under changed abiotic conditions. Aphids are nonsusceptible to Lepidoptera-targeted Bt Cry 1 Ac toxin and they typically show response to abiotic conditions, and here we sought to discover whether they might perform differently on compositionally changed Bt oilseed rape. Bt oilseed rape had increased N content in the leaves coupled with reduced total C compared with its nontransgenic counterpart, but in general the C : N responses of both plant types to elevated CO 2 and temperature were similar. Elevated CO 2 decreased N content and increased C : N ratio of both plant types. Elevated temperature increased C and N contents, total chlorophyll and carotenoid concentrations under ambient CO 2, but decreased these under elevated CO 2. In addition, soluble sugars were increased and starch decreased by elevated temperature under ambient but not under elevated CO 2, whereas photosynthesis was decreased in plants grown under elevated temperature in both CO 2 levels. Myzus persicae, a generalist aphid species, responded directly to elevated temperature with reduced developmental time and decreased adult and progeny weights, whereas the development of the Brassica specialist Brevicoryne brassicae was less affected. Feeding by M. persicae resulted in an increase in the N content of oilseed rape leaves under ambient CO 2, indicating the potential of herbivore feeding itself to cause allocation changes. The aphids performed equally well on both plant types despite the differences between <b>C–N</b> <b>ratios</b> of Bt and non-Bt oilseed rape, revealing the absence of plant composition-related effects on these pests under elevated CO 2, elevated temperature or combined elevated CO 2 and temperature conditions...|$|R

40|$|Productivity {{and quality}} of {{mangosteen}} fruit is markedly affected by tree age and sector (position in canopy). The objective {{of this study was}} to make clear seasonal changes in meteorological conditions of mangosteen orchard, and <b>C-N</b> <b>ratio</b> of leaves in relation to tree age and sector. The experiment was conducted using mangosteen trees grown in commercial orchard in Bogor, Indonesia during May to October 2010. Mangosteen trees of 3 different ages, young (20 -year-old), middle (35 -year-old), and old (50 -year-old), each of five trees, were selected for study, and the canopy of each tree was divided into 9 sectors based on height (bottom, middle, top) and width (inner, center, outer). The light intensity on sunny days was higher in Sector 9, it was 8. 1, 7. 5, and 7. 7 μmol・M(− 2) ・s(− 1) in young, middle-aged and old trees, respectively, whereas in Sector 1 it was low, resulting 0. 5, 0. 4, and 0. 5 μmol・M(− 2) ・s(− 1) in young, middle-aged and old trees, respectively. Regardless of tree age, light intensity in outer position in canopy was higher than in the inner, and also it was higher in taller than in lower positions in canopy. In 2010, the phenological aspects of mangosteen orchard markedly changed because of irregular rainfall. In spite of tree age, SPAD value of leaves in upper parts such as Sectors 5 - 9 was high comparing with lower ones such as Sectors 1 - 4. In young trees, carbohydrate content of leaves was higher in top positions such as Sectors 7 - 9 than in bottom ones such as Sectors 1 - 3, whereas in middle-aged and old trees, no significant difference of carbohydrate content was observed among sectors. Regardless of month and tree age measured, nitrogen content of leaves was higher in lower positions in canopy such as Sectors 1 - 4 than in upper ones such as Sectors 5 - 9. Consequently, the <b>C-N</b> <b>ratio</b> of leaves was higher in the upper part of canopy compared to the lower. Based on the results, the relationships between meteorological status and <b>C-N</b> <b>ratio</b> of leaves and fruit productivity {{and quality of}} mangosteen are discussed in relation to position in canopy and tree age. マンゴスチンの果実生産性や果実品質が樹冠部位や樹齢によって異なる点について，インドネシア西ジャワの商業的マンゴスチン園で照度と降雨量を調査するとともに， 20 ， 35 および 50 年生樹を５個体ずつ選び，各個体樹冠の高さと幅から 9 つのセクター（樹冠部位）に分け，葉の葉色値（SPAD値），クロロフィル含量，炭水化物含量，窒素含量およびC-N率を比較した．晴天日の照度は，樹齢による差は小さくセクター 9 （各樹齢 7. 5 ～ 8. 1 μmol・M(- 2) ・S(- 1) ）が最も高く，一方セクター 1 （各樹齢 0. 4 ～ 0. 5 μmol・M(- 2) ・S(- 1) ）で最も低かった．樹冠外部の照度はいずれの樹齢も樹冠内部よりも高く，またセクター 1 ， 2 ， 3 のような下部よりも 7 ， 8 ， 9 のような上部で高かった．調査を行った 2010 年は雨季の開始が例年よりも 2 ～ 3 か月早く，このため樹体の生育相が例年とは大きく異なった．葉色値は樹齢に関係なくセクター 1 ～ 4 のような下部の葉よりもセクター 5 ～ 9 のような上部の葉で高かった．葉の炭水化物含量は， 20 年生樹ではセクター 1 ～ 3 の下部よりも 7 ～ 9 の上部で高かったが， 35 年生と 50 年生樹ではそれぞれ 50. 7 ～ 53. 0 %と 51. 3 ～ 52. 6 %で大差なかった．一方，葉の窒素含量は樹齢や測定時期に関係なくセクター 5 ～ 9 の上部よりもセクター 1 ～ 4 の下部で高かった．このため，葉のC-N率は樹冠の下部よりも上部で高かった．この結果をもとにマンゴスチンの果実生産性と品質および樹冠部位と樹齢との関係を考察した...|$|E
40|$|We report {{measurements}} of seasonal {{variability in the}} <b>C-N</b> stable isotope <b>ratios</b> of plants collected across the habitat mosaic of San Francisco Bay, its marshes, and its tributary river system. Analyses of 868 plant samples were binned into 10 groups (e. g., terrestrial riparian, freshwater phytoplankton, salt marsh) to determine whether C-N isotopes {{can be used as}} biomarkers for tracing the origins of organic matter in this river–marsh–estuary complex. Variability of d 13 C and d 15 N was high (; 5 – 10 ‰) within each plant group, and we identified three modes of variability: (1) between species and their microhabitats, (2) over annual cycles of plant growth and senescence, and (3) between living and decomposing biomass. These modes of within-group variability obscure any source-specific isotopic signatures, confounding the application of C-N isotopes for identifying the origins of organic matter. A second confounding factor was large dissimilarity between the d 13 C-d 15 N of primary producers and the organic-matter pools in the seston and sediments. Both confounding factors impede the application of C-N isotopes to reveal the food supply to primary consumers in ecosystems supporting diverse autotrophs and where the isotopic com-position of organic matter has been transformed and become distinct from that of its parent plant sources. Our results support the advice of others: variability of C-N stable isotopes within all organic-matter pools is high and must be considered in applications of these isotopes to trace trophic linkages from primary producers to primar...|$|R

40|$|No single {{hypothesis}} or {{theory has}} been widely accepted for explaining the functional mechanism of global alpine/arctic treeline formation. The present study tested whether the alpine treeline is determined by (1) the needle nitrogen content associated with photosynthesis (carbon gain); (2) a sufficient source-sink ratio of carbon; or (3) a sufficient <b>C-N</b> <b>ratio.</b> Nitrogen does not limit the growth and development of trees studied at the Himalayan treelines. Levels of non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) in trees were species-specific and site-dependent; therefore, the treeline cases studied did not show consistent evidence of source/carbon limitation or sink/growth limitation in treeline trees. However, results of the combined three treelines showed that the treeline trees may suffer from a winter carbon shortage. The source capacity and the sink capacity of a tree influence its tissue NSC concentrations and the carbon balance; therefore, we suggest that the persistence and development of treeline trees in a harsh alpine environment may require a minimum level of the total NSC concentration, a sufficiently high sugar:starch ratio, and a balanced carbon source-sink relationship...|$|E
30|$|Under the {{assumption}} that G. pulex only eats {{the amount of food}} needed to sustain the energy budget and nitrogen is the limiting factor, food consumption would increase as nitrogen content of the food decreased. However, the opposite relationship was observed (Figure  4). An explanation could be that the content of other important nutrients (e.g. phosphorus) might have been decreased during the decomposition by microbial activity and was then limiting. The compensation for this limitation then forced the gammarids to increase their feeding rate. For G. fossarum, another aquatic shredder, it has recently been shown that their growth, which is influenced by feeding, is negatively correlated to the C-P ratio of the food source [[39]]. Our results show that a comparison of feeding activity data generated in experiments using differing leaf species decomposed using different methods might be possible when the <b>C-N</b> <b>ratio</b> of the provided food is measured. However, it is advisable to include phosphorus into the testing of nutritional status of food sources; phosphorus is an essential component of food quality alongside carbon and nitrogen [[37]], and which nutrient is limiting depends on the actual content of the nutrient rather than the ratio.|$|E

We provide esti-mates of net N mineralization and nitrification rates for old-growth forests from the northeastern United States, a region in which few old-growth forests remain and for which few published accounts of mineralization rates exist. At the plot level, no ef-fects of the dominant tree species were observed on any measured soil properties or N-cycling rates. Effects of alternate disturbance histories were de-tected in soil carbon (C) and N pools. Old-growth forest soils had higher total C (67 Mgha 1) and N capital (3. 3 Mgha 1) than that of historically logged then burned soils (C 50 Mgha 1 and N Mgha 1), with intermediate values (C 54 Mgha 1 and N 2. 7 Mgha 1) in the stands that were historically logged. Despite these differences in C and N content, corresponding differences in <b>C–N</b> <b>ratio,</b> net N mineralization rates, and net nitri-fication rates were not observed. The N concentra-tion in the green foliage of American beech trees (Fagus grandifolia) was also highest from canopy trees growing in old-growth stands (3. 0 %), fol-lowed by logged stands (2. 6 %), and lowest in the logged/burned stands (2. 2 %).

40|$|Topography is a {{major factor}} {{controlling}} both hydrological and soil processes at the landscape scale. This is well-known qualitatively in that topography, along with parent material, climate, biota, and time, is one of the fundamental soil forming factors. The topographic influence is also apparent in the soil catena concept. Digital elevation models (DEMs) and topographic indices calculated from these DEMs allow the relationship between topography and soil characteristics to be measured quantitatively as well. In this study we use data from the Swedish National Forest Soil Inventory, which is a long-term inventory of permanent sample plots from the Swedish National Forest Inventory. It includes a description of soil types and soil horizons as well as sampling of organic and mineral soil horizons for subsequent chemical analyses. We focused on Podzols and Histosols, which provided 4000 sample plots distributed over almost all of Sweden. Plot locations were determined accurately by GPS, which allowed the overlaying of plot data and the DEM. Topographic indices such as the topographic wetness index, TWI (ln(a/tanβ)), were computed from gridded digital elevation data for all sample plots. We found several significant correlations between topographic indices and soil properties. The thickness of the organic layer increased with TWI and the thickness of the leached E-horizon increased with upslope area. Soil pH in the organic layer increased with TWI, while the <b>C–N</b> <b>ratio</b> decreased. Soil pH in the organic layer was also found to be higher for south facing slopes than for north facing slopes. The ratio between the divalent base cation (Ca and Mg) and the monovalent base cation (K and Na) concentrations in the O-horizon increased with TWI. These correlations confirmed the importance of topography on soil properties, although there was considerable scatter, which could be attributed to heterogeneity in the large data set...|$|E
40|$|The {{functional}} grouping hypothesis, {{which suggests}} that complexity in ecosystem function can be simplified by grouping species with similar responses, was tested in the Florida scrub habitat. Functional groups were identified based on how species in fire maintained Florida scrub regulate exchange of carbon and water with the atmosphere as indicated by both instantaneous gas exchange measurements and integrated measures of function (%N, delta C- 13, delta N- 15, <b>C-N</b> <b>ratio).</b> Using cluster analysis, five distinct physiologically-based functional groups were identified in the fire maintained scrub. These functional groups were tested {{to determine if they}} were robust spatially, temporally, and with management regime. Analysis of Similarities (ANOSIM), a non-parametric multivariate analysis, indicated that these five physiologically-based groupings were not altered by plot differences (R = - 0. 115, p = 0. 893) or by the three different management regimes; prescribed burn, mechanically treated and burn, and fire-suppressed (R = 0. 018, p = 0. 349). The physiological groupings also remained robust between the two climatically different years 1999 and 2000 (R = - 0. 027, p = 0. 725). Easy-to-measure morphological characteristics indicating functional groups would be more practical for scaling and modeling ecosystem processes than detailed gas-exchange measurements, therefore we tested a variety of morphological characteristics as functional indicators. A combination of non-parametric multivariate techniques (Hierarchical cluster analysis, non-metric Multi-Dimensional Scaling, and ANOSIM) were used to compare the ability of life form, leaf thickness, and specific leaf area classifications to identify the physiologically-based functional groups. Life form classifications (ANOSIM; R = 0. 629, p 0. 001) were able to depict the physiological groupings more adequately than either specific leaf area (ANOSIM; R = 0. 426, p = 0. 001) or leaf thickness (ANOSIM; R 0. 344, p 0. 001). The ability of life forms to depict the physiological groupings was improved by separating the parasitic Ximenia americana from the shrub category (ANOSIM; R = 0. 794, p = 0. 001).
