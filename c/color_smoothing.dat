40|$|General {{principles}} are presented which modify image processing techniques to give results {{in agreement with}} the visual perception of color images. To keep these principles and therefore the modified operations as simple as possible, the characteristics of the human visual system employed are limited to some psychophysical and uniformity features. This is done by making use of additive and uniform color spaces. In contrast with additive spaces, we have found that the uniform spaces introduce some problems in certain image processing techniques. A detailed study of three uniform color spaces indicated that the main problems are due to the increase in quantization error by the transformation from additive to uniform spaces. There is also an incorrect weighting in the distance function of the chromatic signals compared to the luminance contribution. Based on this study, solutions are presented to overcome these problems. Results of <b>color</b> <b>smoothing</b> operations and color edge detection are also given. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Web enabled <b>color</b> <b>smoothing</b> schemes, {{employed}} in {{applications such as}} VRML, cooperative design tools and online 3 D game rendering engines, rely on constant color triangulation. This artifact is unsuitable for high quality medical and microelectronic images. For convex polygonal image-subsets Wachspress' rational polynomial shape functions provide the best continuous coloring. It is available only via symbolic computer algebra. A numerical finite difference or boundary element code, which can simulate potentials in anisotropic media, furnishes an e#cient alternative. This chromatic anisotropy emerges from projective geometry and perspective transformations between changing images for which the analogous kinematics can best be modeled by boundary elements. Color mixing depends on the RGB, HSB and CMYK representations, moreover there is no unique notion of a `linear color distribution' along the boundary. In monitoring medical images or controlling remote experiments, the algorithm to determine the dynamic anisotropic factor can be codified and then compiled for any web browser, which can launch a boundary element code (e. g., BEASY), to display time series data in color...|$|E
40|$|The {{reconstruction}} of high-quality 3 D models sampling both {{the shape and}} the surface reflection attribute is still a complex task. This papers contains new algorithms to integrate in a single texturemapped mesh the color info contained in either standard digital photos or RGB-enhanced range maps, minimizing redundancy and optimizing the color attribute representation. We enhance a previous solution [12] with: improved use of the available images, better color matching and computational efficiency. According to visibility computations and some heuristics, we subdivide the mesh in patches and assign to each patch a section {{of one of the}} input images. These image sections are packed in a texture image minimizing space but maintaining image coherence. Finally, we eliminate most of the color difference or discontinuity which exist in input images (applying a cross-correlation and interpolation between adjoining sections of the input images, directly on the texture image space). Note that this last step is performed on the whole texture, in contrast to others approaches that apply <b>color</b> <b>smoothing</b> just on small transition zones. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{production}} of quality color prints requires that color accuracy and reproducibility be maintained to within very tight tolerances when transferred to different media. Variations in the printing process commonly produce color shifts {{that result in}} poor color reproduction. The primary function of a color management system is maintaining color quality and consistency. Currently these systems are tuned in the factory by printing a large set of test color patches, measuring them, and making necessary adjustments. This time-consuming procedure should be repeated as needed once the printer leaves the factory. In this work, a color management system that compensates for print color shifts in real-time using feedback from an in-line full-width sensor is proposed. Instead of printing test patches, this novel attempt at color management utilizes the output pixels already rendered in production pages, for a continuous printer characterization. The printed pages are scanned in-line {{and the results are}} utilized to update the process by which colorimetric image content is translated into engine specific color separations (e. g. CIELAB- 3 ̆eCMYK). The proposed system provides a means to perform automatic printer characterization, by simply printing a set of images that cover the gamut of the printer. Moreover, all of the color conversion features currently utilized in production systems (such as Gray Component Replacement, Gamut Mapping, and <b>Color</b> <b>Smoothing)</b> can be achieved with the proposed system...|$|E

50|$|A {{common and}} unfortunate {{artifact}} of Color Filter Array (CFA) interpolation or demosaicing {{is what is}} known and seen as false coloring.

Various methods exist for preventing and removing this false <b>coloring.</b> <b>Smooth</b> hue transition interpolation is used during the demosaicing to prevent false colors from manifesting themselves in the final image. However, there are other algorithms that can remove false colors after demosaicing.

50|$|Extracting {{contrast}} involves eliminating {{redundant information}} and focusing attention. Cells in the retina, the lateral geniculate body or relay {{station in the}} brain, and in the visual cortex respond predominantly to step changes in luminance rather than homogeneous surface <b>colors.</b> <b>Smooth</b> gradients are much harder for the visual system to detect rather than segmented divisions of shades resulting in easily detectable edges. Contrasts due {{to the formation of}} edges may be pleasing to the eye. The importance of the visual neuron's varying responses to the orientation and presence of edges has previously been proven by David H. Hubel and Torsten Wiesel. This may hold evolutionary significance since regions of contrast are information rich requiring reinforcement and the allocation of attention. In contrast to the principle of grouping, contrasting features are typically in close proximity eliminating the need to link distant, but similar features.|$|R

40|$|A {{non-parametric}} {{smoothing method}} is presented that reduces noise in multi-wavelength imaging data sets. Using Principle Component Analysis (hereafter PCA) to associate pixels {{according to their}} $ugriz$-band <b>colors,</b> <b>smoothing</b> is done over pixels with a similar location in PCA space. This method smoothes over pixels with similar color, which reduces the amount of mixing of different <b>colors</b> within the <b>smoothing</b> region. The method is tested using a mock galaxy with signal-to-noise levels and color characteristics of SDSS data. When comparing this method to smoothing methods using a fixed radial profile or an adaptive radial profile, the chi^ 2 -like statistic for the method presented here is smaller. The method shows a small dependence on input parameters. Running this method on SDSS data and fitting theoretical stellar population models to the smoothed data of the mock galaxy and SDSS data, shows that the method reduces scatter in the best-fit stellar population analysis parameters, when compared to cases where no smoothing is done. For an area centered on the star forming region of the mock galaxy, the median and standard deviation of the PCA-smoothed data is 7 Myr (+/- 3 Myr), as compared to 10 Myr (+/- 1 Myr) for a simple radial average, where the noise-free true value is 7. 5 Myr (+/- 3. 7 Myr).
