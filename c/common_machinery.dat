40|$|AbstractIn Xenopus, {{an early}} and a late pathway {{exist for the}} {{selective}} localization of RNAs to the vegetal cortex during oogenesis. Previous work has suggested that distinct cellular mechanisms mediate localization during these pathways. Here, we provide several independent lines of evidence supporting the existence of <b>common</b> <b>machinery</b> for RNA localization during the early and late pathways. Data from RNA microinjection assays show that early and late pathway RNAs compete for common localization factors in vivo, and that the same short RNA sequence motifs are required for localization during both pathways. In addition, quantitative filter binding assays demonstrate that the late localization factor Vg RBP/Vera binds specifically to several early pathway RNA localization elements. Finally, confocal imaging shows that early pathway RNAs associate with a perinuclear microtubule network that connects to the mitochondrial cloud of stage I oocytes suggesting that motor driven transport plays a role during the early pathway as it does during the late pathway. Taken together, our data indicate that <b>common</b> <b>machinery</b> functions during the early and late pathways. Thus, RNA localization to the vegetal cortex may be a regulated process such that differential interactions with basal factors determine when distinct RNAs are localized during oogenesis...|$|E

40|$|Group A {{streptococcus}} (GAS; Streptococcus pyogenes) is {{a common}} pathogen that invades non-phagocytic human cells via endocytosis. Once taken up by cells, it escapes from the endocytic pathway to the cytoplasm, but here it is contained within a membrane-bound structure termed GAS-containing autophagosome-like vacuoles (GcAVs). The autophagosome marker GFP-LC 3 associates with GcAVs, and other components of the autophagosomal pathway are involved in GcAV formation. However, the mechanistic relationship between GcAV and canonical autophagy is largely unknown. Here, we morphologically analyzed GcAV formation in detail. Initially, a small, GFP-LC 3 -positive GcAV sequesters each streptococcal chain, and these then coalesce into a single, large GcAV. Expression of a dominant-negative form of Rab 7 or RNAi-mediated knockdown of Rab 7 prevented the initial formation of small GcAV structures.

40|$|We {{performed}} a comprehensive {{analysis of a}} literature-mined human signaling network by integrating data on ubiquitin-mediated protein half-lives. We found that proteins with very long half-lives are connected to form a network backbone, while proteins with short and medium half-lives preferentially attach to the network backbone and scatter throughout the network. Furthermore, proteins with short and medium half-lives are mutually exclusive in network neighbors. Short half-life proteins are enriched in the upstream portion of the network, suggesting that ubiquitination might help initiate signal processing and specificity. We also discovered that ubiquitination preferentially occurs in positive regulatory loops. Furthermore, these loops predominately induce or positively regulate apoptosis, a major component in cancer signaling. These results lead us {{to discover that the}} highly expressed genes involved in the <b>common</b> <b>machinery</b> of ubiquitination, the 26 S proteasome genes, are significantly correlated with tumor progression and metastasis.

Using the spermatogonial transplantation technique, we examined expression of the CD 9 molecule, which is commonly expressed on stem cells of other tissues. Selection of both mouse and rat testis cells with anti-CD 9 antibody re-sulted in 5 - to 7 -fold enrichment of spermatogonial stem cells from intact testis cells, indicating that CD 9 is commonly ex-pressed on spermatogonial stem cells of both species.

40|$|Proteins {{destined for}} the {{secretory}} pathway must first fold and assemble in the lumen of endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The pathway maintains a quality control mechanism to assure that aberrantly processed proteins are not delivered to their sites of function. As part of this mechanism, misfolded proteins are returned to the cytosol via the ER protein translocation pore where they are ubiquitinated and degraded by the 26 S proteasome. Previously, little was known regarding the recognition and targeting of proteins before degradation. By tracking the fate of several mutant proteins subject to quality control, we demonstrate the existence of two distinct sorting mechanisms. In the ER, substrates are either sorted for retention in the ER or are transported to the Golgi apparatus via COPII–coated vesicles. Proteins transported to the Golgi are retrieved to the ER via the retrograde transport system. Ultimately, both retained and retrieved proteins converge at a <b>common</b> <b>machinery</b> at the ER for degradation. Furthermore, we report the identification of a gene playing a novel role specific to the retrieval pathway. The gene, BST 1, {{is required for the}} transport of misfolded proteins to the Golgi, although dispensable for the transport of many normal cargo proteins...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{application}} of wavelet analysis {{for the detection of}} early changes in rotor dynamics caused by <b>common</b> <b>machinery</b> faults namely, rotor unbalance and minor blade rubbing conditions. In this paper, the time synchronised wavelet analysis method was formulated and its effectiveness to detect machinery faults at the early stage was evaluated based on signal simulation and experimental study. The proposed method provides a more standardised approach to visualise the current state of rotor dynamics of a rotating machinery by taking into account the effects of time-shift, wavelet edge distortion, and system noise suppression. The experimental results showed that this method is able to reveal subtle changes of the vibration signal characteristics in both the frequency content distribution and the amplitude distortion caused by minor rotor unbalance and blade rubbing conditions. Besides, this method also appeared to be an effective tool to diagnose and to discriminate the different types of machinery faults based on the unique pattern of the wavelet contours. This study shows that the proposed wavelet analysis method is promising to reveal machinery faults at early stage as compared to vibration spectrum analysis...|$|E
40|$|Results of {{in vitro}} {{experiments}} have suggested {{the existence of}} at least three pathways by which nuclear-encoded proteins are targeted to the chloroplast thylakoid membrane. However, few components of the targeting machinery have been identified and the relationship between the three pathways is not clear. To investigate mechanisms underlying thylakoid protein targeting, we identified nuclear mutations in maize that cause targeting defects. We found two mutations, tha 1 and hcf 106, that disrupt the localization of different sets of proteins to the thylakoid lumen. The tha 1 mutation interferes with the targeting of one chloroplast-encoded protein, cytochrome f, and three nuclear-encoded proteins, plastocyanin, the psaF gene product and the 33 kDa subunit of the oxygen-evolving complex. The hcf 106 mutation interferes with the targeting of the 16 and 23 kDa subunits of the oxygen-evolving complex. The tha 1 and hcf 106 phenotypes provide the first in vivo evidence supporting the existence of two distinct thylakoid-targeting pathways. Their phenotypes also provide evidence that one chloroplast-encoded protein, cytochrome f, engages the 'tha 1 ' pathway, indicating that nuclear- and chloroplast-encoded proteins can be targeted via <b>common</b> <b>machinery...</b>|$|E

We demonstrate that inactivation of Fbxw 7 in hematopoietic cells causes premature depletion of HSCs due to active cell cycling and p 53 -dependent apoptosis. Interestingly, Fbxw 7 deletion also confers a selective advantage to cells with suppressed p 53 function, eventually leading to development of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Thus, Fbxw 7 functions as a fail-safe mechanism against both premature HSC loss and leukemogenesis...|$|R

Despite the importance of engulfment by epithelial cells, {{little is known about the}} molecular changes that are required within these cells. The misregulation of integrins has previously been associated with disease states, suggesting that a better understanding of the regulation of receptor trafficking could be key to treating diseases caused by defects in phagocytosis. Here, we demonstrate that the integrin heterodimer αPS 3 /βPS becomes apically enriched and is required for engulfment by the epithelial follicle cells of the Drosophila ovary. We found that integrin heterodimer localization and function is largely directed by the α-subunit. Moreover, proper cell polarity promotes asymmetric integrin enrichment, suggesting that αPS 3 /βPS trafficking occurs in a polarized fashion. We show that several genes previously known for their roles in trafficking and cell migration are also required for engulfment. Moreover, as in mammals, the same α-integrin subunit is required by professional and non-professional phagocytes and migrating cells in Drosophila. Our findings suggest that migrating and engulfing cells use <b>common</b> <b>machinery,</b> and demonstrate a crucial role for integrin function and polarized trafficking of integrin subunits during engulfment. This study also establishes the epithelial follicle cells of the Drosophila ovary as a powerful model for understanding the molecular changes required for engulfment by a polarized epithelium...|$|E

Hydrogen peroxide, salicylates and jasmonates act as signal molecules in plants employing <b>common</b> <b>machinery</b> to manage abiotic stress. The present work is primarily focused to assign a structurefunction relationship by modeling of the hypothetical proteins of SA-JA signaling pathway known in Arabidopsis thaliana and compare them with corresponding proteins in rice in silico. Thirteen known gene sequences with their encoded proteins for SA/JA pathway in model plant A. thaliana were obtained and similar gene sequences from rice were retrieved at NCBI. Five rice gene sequences Os 09 g 0392100, Os 03 g 0233200, OsJ_ 33269, OsJ_ 23610 and Os 01 g 0194300 resulted in hypothetical protein products with unknown structure and function. Modeling and comparison of 5 proteins from rice and Arabidopsis showed 73 - 98 % identity with acceptable RMSD values of 0. 6 - 1. 7 upon superimposition. Results suggest conserved nature of these proteins during evolution. The hypothetical protein from rice contains similar functional protein domain as that in A. thaliana and therefore are likely to perform similar functions in rice. There is a cross talk between the genes in SA/JA pathway wherein Os 09 g 0392100 or EDS 1, Os 03 g 0233200 or PR 5, OsJ_ 33269 or PAD 4 and OsJ_ 23610 or SFD- 1 activates the pathway and Os 01 g 0194300 or NPR 1 inhibit the pathway.

40|$|During {{the blood}} stages of malaria, several hundred parasite-encoded {{proteins}} are exported beyond the double-membrane barrier {{that separates the}} parasite from the host cell cytosol. These proteins {{have a variety of}} roles that are essential to virulence or parasite growth. There is keen interest in understanding how proteins are exported and whether <b>common</b> <b>machineries</b> are involved in trafficking the different classes of exported proteins. One potential trafficking machine is a protein complex known as the Plasmodium translocon of exported proteins (PTEX). Although PTEX has been linked to the export of one class of exported proteins, there has been no direct evidence for its role and scope in protein translocation. Here we show, through the generation of two parasite lines defective for essential PTEX components (HSP 101 or PTEX 150), and analysis of a line lacking the non-essential component TRX 2 (ref. 12), greatly reduced trafficking of all classes of exported proteins beyond the double membrane barrier enveloping the parasite. This includes proteins containing the PEXEL motif (RxLxE/Q/D) and PEXEL-negative exported proteins (PNEPs). Moreover, the export of proteins destined for expression on the infected erythrocyte surface, including the major virulence factor PfEMP 1 in Plasmodium falciparum, was significantly reduced in PTEX knockdown parasites. PTEX function was also essential for blood-stage growth, because even a modest knockdown of PTEX components had a strong effect on the parasite 2 ̆ 7 s capacity to complete the erythrocytic cycle both in vitro and in vivo.
