40|$|The country {{policy review}} paper on policy {{developments}} in Canadian agriculture gives a concise listing of program changes for agriculture and food {{that have occurred}} since the mid- 1980 s. A major focus {{of many of the}} changes, as noted in that paper, is to orient agricultural programs to be consistent with the Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture (URA). The related, and even more compelling, focus underlying the reorientation of Canadian agricultural policy in {{the last half of the}} 1990 s, has been reduction of budget outlays. A further motivation for changes in farm programs has been the high levels of costs associated with trade disputes. However, the need for expenditure reduc-tions reinforced political will for action on a number of the policy changes highlighted in the country policy review paper for Canada. IMPACTS ON THE CANADIAN FOOD INDUSTRY The changes in Canadian agri-food policy that are outlined in the <b>country</b> <b>review</b> <b>paper</b> have accompanied considerable transformation of the Canadian food processing and distributing industry.

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade the World Management Survey (WMS) has {{collected}} firm-level management practices data across multiple sectors and countries. We developed the survey {{to try to explain}} the large and persistent TFP differences across firms and <b>countries.</b> This <b>review</b> <b>paper</b> discusses what has been learned empirically and theoretically from the WMS and other recent work on management practices. Our preliminary results suggest that about a quarter of cross-country and within-country TFP gaps can be accounted for by management practices. Management seems to matter both qualitatively and quantitatively. Competition, governance, human capital and informational frictions help account for the variation in management. We make some suggestions for both policy and future research...|$|R

30|$|Finally, the {{robustness}} of previous findings is checked using levels instead of percentage changes, since using percentage changes could be misleading given the great heterogeneity of the pre-crisis coefficients. The relationship is still significant although {{now at the}} 5 per cent level and explains only thirteen per cent {{of the variation in}} the data. Using the level version makes it clear that Spain is an outlier. This may be explained by the fact that, already from the early 2000 s, unemployment was becoming more and more sensitive to output growth (largely driven by the boom in the construction sector prior to the onset of the crisis). The coefficient reached almost 0.6 just before the crisis, a level by far above all others <b>countries</b> <b>reviewed</b> in this <b>paper.</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{significant}} proportion of developing countries have {{expressed an interest in}} greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation in the agriculture sector. However, compared to mitigation planning in some other sectors, progress with developing agricultural mitigation plans and the allocation of climate finance to the agriculture sector have been limited. The purpose of this guide is to provide national policy makers, advisors and other stakeholders in the agriculture sector with an introduction to the main mitigation planning approaches and the key elements that may need to be considered in the planning process. This guide describes two of the main approaches to GHG mitigation planning in developing countries: Low-Emission Development Strategies (LEDS) and Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs). It explains the possible relationships between them and their status within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). National mitigation planning processes have policy, technical and institutional dimensions {{that need to be addressed}} in an integrated and iterative manner. For each of these dimensions four key elements are outlined. Examples from mitigation planning processes in developing countries are provided to illustrate the range of options for addressing these key elements in country-specific ways. Special considerations for including smallholder farmers in the planning process are highlighted. This guide may be read as a companion document to the recent publication, National integrated mitigation planning in agriculture: A <b>review</b> <b>paper,</b> which <b>reviewed</b> LEDS in 18 developing countries and agricultural NAMAs in 30 <b>countries.</b> The <b>Review</b> <b>Paper,</b> prepared with support of CCAFS and FAO, can be accessed here: [URL]...|$|R

Within the last decade, there has been a shift from emphasis on 'hard laws' regulating fisheries in sovereign-states' territorial waters, towards governance through 'soft' global voluntary codes of conduct, market incentives and partnerships between fisherfolk and governments. The new governance regime inherits daunting problems and will require sustained international political commitment to succeed. Given this political will, new enabling institutions and the ecological resilience of many marine species could restore and sustain the fisheries. Copyright © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. ...|$|R
