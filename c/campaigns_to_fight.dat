50|$|The Church has put {{pressure}} upon {{the government to}} outlaw and disband Voodoo.

In addition to the more common French and British the missionaries, Canadian missionaries began to move into Haiti in 1942. A Jesuit seminary was also opened in 1948. Up to this time, the church remains a major political power; this can cause major problems in country and has greatly limited its pastoral work. In the past decade the Catholic Church has taken a much more liberal stand towards Vodou, even including some minor Vodou elements in the Haitian mass.|$|E

From 1956 to 1959 he {{simultaneously}} served as the senior pastor at both Mount Olive and Providence Baptist Church in Atlanta. He then moved to pastor Mount Zion Baptist Church in Lockland, Ohio from 1961 to 1975. While at the church he was regional director of Martin Luther King Jr.'s Southern Christian Leadership Conference, leading several <b>campaigns</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> various forms of discrimination and segregation. He also participated in the Selma, Alabama civil rights march with King, whom he became close friends with. King also married Moss and his wife. In 1971 he spent one year away from the church to co-pastor Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta with Martin Luther King Sr. After leaving Mount Zion Baptist Church in 1975 he left to pastor the Olivet Institutional Baptist Church in Cleveland, which was then the largest black church {{in the state of}} Ohio. He led the church for 33 years before retiring in 2008. During his time at the church, besides continuing to be a sought-after speaker and influential figure in social justice movements, he was an advisor to President Jimmy Carter and also befriended such figures as Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, Oprah Winfrey, and Jesse Jackson. In 1997 Moss partnered with University Hospitals to create the Otis Moss Jr. Medical Center. He was also repeatedly named one of American's most influential black preachers by Ebony Magazine.|$|E
50|$|With such {{a limited}} force of men, Hunter had orders to {{establish}} an alliance with the Native Americans in the region, particularly the Pimas. He also was directed to observe the advance of the California Column under James H. Carleton which had already begun their invasion of Confederate Arizona. Hunter dispatched several parties on foraging missions, they skirmished with Apaches twice in the Dragoon Mountains, and he sent a request to his superiors for more reinforcements. Other squads were sent to burn the Butterfield Overland Mail stations along the trail west where the Californians were advancing from. Before the Californian advance, a Union spy purchased several thousand pounds of grain and food. It was stored in the abandoned mail stations and {{was intended to be}} used by the California Column. A rebel squad under First Lieutenant Jack Swilling burned Union supplies at Stanwix Station on March 30, 1862, and skirmished with the Californians. At this time, Swilling had founded what later became Arizona's state capital of Phoenix. Rebels later fought the Battle of Picacho Pass just north of Tucson as the Union army approached the presidio. The Picacho Pass skirmish delayed Union forces for weeks after they retreated north. Finally, Union troops captured the undefended Fort Breckenridge to the northeast of Tucson and then attacked the city. The same day, the Union began their advance on Tucson. Sherod Hunter, with only about 100 men withdrew from Tucson {{due to the lack of}} reinforcements which never arrived. He left ten militiamen and Lieutenant James Henry Tevis behind to observe the Union attack. Confederate Tucson was captured without a shot fired, on May 20, 1862. James H. Carleton and his 2,000 men took command of the presidio, and the Confederates escaped to Mesilla. The Union column moved on a week or so later, and Carleton left a small garrison behind to occupy the rebel city. In 1863, with the help of Arizona's founding father, Charles D. Poston, Union Arizona Territory was created and Tucson became the capital. After the Civil War, the fortress would no longer play a direct role in warfare, though the presidio walls would continue to serve as sought-out refuge by settlers until Geronimo's surrender in 1886. Fort Lowell was built adjacent to Tucson in 1873 and became a major army post. With the end of the Apache threat, the Tucson area was rendered peaceful and the fort unnecessary. From the 1860s to 1890s Tucson would become a major stop for United States armies on <b>campaigns</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> the Apache, hundreds of Tucson militia served in the expeditions. By the Mexican Revolution of 1910, the next war fought in southern Arizona, only one portion of the remaining four presidio walls still stood, the others were apparently buried or demolished for new development around the turn of the 20th century. The wall was three feet thick and a few feet tall. It stood in between two later American buildings and was finally destroyed in 1918. A pair of local women made a plaque which marked the location of the wall. In December 1954, a two-story boarding house was torn down to make way for a parking lot. A local business man convinced the University of Arizona to conduct an archaeological excavation. They located a 3 ft portion of the northeastern bastion. Attempts to have the area made into a park failed, and the parking lot was constructed. The area was explored again by archaeologists between 2001 and 2006. Presidio-era features located included the northeastern bastion, the east wall, soil mining pits, and trash-filled pits. Following the work, the northeastern corner of the fort was recreated as a park, opening in 2007. Other surviving portions of the Presidio have been located in the Pima County Courthouse courtyard and in the lawn west of Tucson City Hall.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{argue that}} current funding <b>campaigns</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> AIDS in {{developing}} countries fail to recognize significant losses associated {{with the introduction of}} innovative treatment technologies. For instance, the future albeit uncertain appearance and widespread use of a therapeutic vaccine will trigger significant and unrecoverable losses in current drugs treatment investments. Our objective is then two-fold. We first document losses associated with the transition to better treatment technologies and we show that failure to hedge against such losses leads to sub-optimal policies. Our second objective is to provide policy recommendations to alleviate this problem. We show how to transform some cutting-hedge financial products to generate full insurance coverage against such losses, and in some cases how to achieve full risk-sharing with agencies developing innovative treatments. We recommend that every funding campaign in current AIDS treatments be accompanied with the provision of such insurance against the cost of switching to future albeit uncertain innovative treatments...|$|E
40|$|In this study, we show how a Dutch {{pharmaceutical}} {{consortium of}} cinchona producers and quinine manufacturers {{was able to}} capitalize {{on one of the}} first international public health <b>campaigns</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> malaria, thereby promoting the sale of quinine, an antimalarial medicine. During the 1920 s and 1930 s, the international markets for quinine were controlled by this Dutch consortium, which was a transoceanic cinchona-quinine enterprise centered in the Cinchona Bureau in the Netherlands. We argue that during the interwar period, the Cinchona Bureau became the decision-making center of this Dutch cinchona-quinine pharmaceutical enterprise and monopolized the production and trade of an essential medicine. In addition, we argue that capitalizing on the international public health campaign in the fight against malaria by the Dutch cinchona-quinine enterprise via the Cinchona Bureau can be regarded as an early example of corporate colonization of public health by a private pharmaceutical consortium. Furthermore, we show how commercial interests prevailed over ientific interests within the Dutch cinchona-quinine consortium, thus interfering with and ultimately curtailing the transoceanic circulation of knowledge in the Dutch empire...|$|E

This was particularly true for those in counties with {{the highest levels of}} obesity. Support for policies related to healthy eating and activity was highest for: Requiring at least 30 minutes of physical activity or physical education everyday for children in kindergarten through 12 th grade (93 %) and lowest for: Taxing soda and soft drinks and using the money for public education <b>campaigns</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> obesity in children (65 %). Support for the use of local government funds to build and maintain infrastructure for physical activity was high across all categories, ranging from 86 % (recreation centers) to 74 % (swimming pools). The levels of support for each policy, varied according to several demographic characteristics; in general, support for nearly every policy was greater among African Americans, females, and those in counties with higher levels of obesity. Logistic models predicting level of support for healthy eating and physical activity found significant associations with several demographic factors. 5 R 18 DP 001139 - 02 /DP/NCCDPHP CDC HHS/United StatesP 30 DK 092950 /DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United StatesU 48 /DP 001903 /DP/NCCDPHP CDC HHS/United States 2016 - 02 - 18 T 00 : 00 : 00 Z 23399933 PMC 475811...|$|E
40|$|Excerpt] Over {{the past}} decade, German {{hospitals}} have been privatised {{at a rate}} not seen in any other country. In response to massive public-sector debt and the resulting investment backlog, many {{state and local governments}} have been privatising hospitals. The most common arguments for privatisation are repeated in a recent study commissioned by the association of private hospital owners (Bundesverband Deutscher Privatkliniken - BDPK) namely that private hospitals manage in a more efficient manner and are economically more successful (Augurzky, Beivers et al., 2009). Indeed, in some cases, private for-profit hospital companies have invested generously and turned inefficient public hospitals into profitable private ones. Of interest to us is the cost of this trend, to workers and patients. Assertions that privatisation has not undermined the quality of care are highly dubious. In German public opinion, there is broad scepticism about the privatisation of hospitals. While there are very few scientific studies on the effects of privatisation on patients, there are a growing number of local ballot initiatives and other <b>campaigns</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> it. There are widespread fears that for-profit health-care provision would undermine the existing system, which provides universally accessible medical treatment at a relatively high level of quality. Even among physicians, often considered the winners of privatisation, there is scepticism (Bundesärztekammer, 2007). We will argue below that one reason for these problems is the effect of privatisation on employees. Trade unionists and works councils in privatised hospitals have seen a severe deterioration in working conditions (Ver. di Vertrauensleute und Vorsitzende und Mitglieder von Konzernbetriebsräten und Konzern-Jugend- und Auszubildenden-Vertretungen privater Krankenhauskonzern, 2008). Since personnel accounts for about 60 per cent of hospitals’ overall costs (Statistisches Bundesamt, 2008 b), private for-profit hospitals can only make profits at the expense of employees. These perceptions are supported by the statistics presented in this paper, and trade unions and employees protest — in cooperation with other parts of civil society - almost every planned privatisation. Drawing on publicly available quantitative data and qualitative interviews, we map out in this paper the trend toward the privatisation of German hospitals. We begin by showing how and why privatisation has proceeded in Germany despite the controversy. Then we examine the effects of privatisation on workers and patients. We will conclude with some implications for policy and practice...|$|E
