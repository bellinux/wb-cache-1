50|$|Later, in 1947, {{enquiries}} {{were made}} with the <b>Chief</b> <b>Postmaster</b> {{as to whether or}} not the Post Office would continue to require accommodation in the station building. Consideration was given to both the option of replacing the station building with one having sufficient room for the business of both the Railways Department and the Post & Telegraph Department, and to the option of the department discontinuing post office duties and the establishment of a separate post office staffed by members of that department. The District Traffic Manager noted on 25 July 1947 that an inquiry had recently been received from the Post & Telegraph Department as to whether additional space could be provided in the station building to accommodate their requirements. When the Railways Department declined the request the Post & Telegraph Department asked on 1 August for a lease on a small area of land at the north end of the station for the erection and operation of a temporary post office pending the acquisition of a more suitable site for a permanent building. The Railways Department agreed to lease the land requested for £5 per annum with the change effective from 10 April 1948.
