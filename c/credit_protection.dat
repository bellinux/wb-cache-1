25|$|Prior to 2009 {{regulation}} of consumer credit was primarily {{conducted by the}} states and territories. Some states such as New South Wales and Queensland legislated effective annual interest rate caps of 48%. In 2008 the Australian states and territories referred powers of consumer credit to the Commonwealth. In 2009 the National Consumer <b>Credit</b> <b>Protection</b> Act 2009 (Cth) was introduced, which initially treated payday lenders no differently from all other lenders. In 2013 Parliament tightened regulation on the payday lending further introducing the Consumer Credit and Corporations Legislation Amendment (Enhancements) Act 2012 (Cth) which imposed an effective APR cap of 48% for all consumer credit contracts (inclusive of all fees and charges). Payday lenders who provided a loan falling within {{the definition of a}} small amount credit contract (SACC), defined as a contract provided by a non authorised-deposit taking institution for less than $2,000 for a term between 16 days and 1 year, are permitted to charge a 20% establishment fee in addition to monthly (or part thereof) fee of 4% (effective 48% p.a.). Payday lenders who provide a loan falling within the definition of a medium amount credit contract (MACC), defined as a credit contract provided by a non-deposit taking institution for between $2,000–$5,000 may charge a $400 establishment fee in addition to the statutory interest rate cap of 48%. Payday lenders are still required to comply with Responsible lending obligations applying to all creditors. Unlike other jurisdictions Australian payday lenders providing SACC or MACC products are not required to display their fees as an effective annual interest rate percentage.|$|E

2500|$|Considerable {{speculation}} {{remains that}} Goldman's hedges against its AIG exposure {{would not have}} paid out if AIG was allowed to fail.

[...] Finally, the report said, an AIG default would have forced Goldman Sachs to bear the risk of declines in the value {{of billions of dollars in}} collateral debt obligations.|$|E

2500|$|The issued {{securities}} {{are often}} split into tranches, or categorized into {{varying degrees of}} subordination. Each tranche has a different level of <b>credit</b> <b>protection</b> or risk exposure: there is generally a senior ("A") class of securities and one or more junior subordinated ("B", [...] "C", etc.) classes that function as protective layers for the [...] "A" [...] class. The senior classes have first claim on the cash that the SPV receives, and the more junior classes only start receiving repayment after the more senior classes have been repaid. Because of the cascading effect between classes, this arrangement {{is often referred to}} as a cash flow waterfall. If the underlying asset pool becomes insufficient to make payments on the securities (e.g. when loans default within a portfolio of loan claims), the loss is absorbed first by the subordinated tranches, and the upper-level tranches remain unaffected until the losses exceed the entire amount of the subordinated tranches. The senior securities might be AAA or AA rated, signifying a lower risk, while the lower-credit quality subordinated classes receive a lower credit rating, signifying a higher risk.|$|E
2500|$|Second, because §206(a)(1)(C) {{says the}} minimum wage is $7.25 per hour, courts have grappled with which hours count as [...] "working". Early cases {{established}} that time traveling to work did not count as work, unless it was controlled by, required by, and {{for the benefit of}} an employer, like traveling through a coal mine. For example, in, Anderson v Mount Clemens Pottery Co a majority of five to two justices held that employees had to be paid for the long walk to work through an employer's Mount Clemens Pottery Co facility. According to Murphy J this time, and time setting up workstations, involved [...] "exertion of a physical nature, controlled or required by the employer and pursued necessarily and primarily for the employer's benefit." [...] In Armour & Co v Wantock firefighters claimed they should be fully paid while on call at their station for fires. The Supreme Court held that, even though the firefighters could sleep or play cards, because [...] "eadiness to serve may be hired quite as much as service itself" [...] and time waiting on call was [...] "a benefit to the employer". By contrast, in 1992 the Sixth Circuit controversially held that needing to be infrequently available by phone or pager, where movement was not restricted, was not working time. Time spent doing unusual cleaning, for instance showering off toxic substances, does count as working time, and so does time putting on special protective gear. Under §207(e) pay for overtime should be one and a half times the regular pay. In Walling v Helmerich and Payne Inc, the Supreme Court held that an employer's scheme of paying lower wages in the morning, and higher wages in the afternoon, to argue that overtime only needed to be calculated on top of (lower) morning wages was unlawful. Overtime has to be calculated based on the average regular pay. However, in Christensen v Harris County six Supreme Court judges held that police in Harris County, Texas could be forced to use up their accumulated [...] "compensatory time" [...] (allowing time off with full pay) before claiming overtime. Writing for the dissent, Stevens J said the majority had misconstrued §207(o)(2), which requires an [...] "agreement" [...] between employers, unions or employees on the applicable rules, and the Texas police had not agreed. Third, §203(m) allows employers to deduct sums from wages for food or housing that is [...] "customarily furnished" [...] for employees. The Secretary of Labor may determine what counts as fair value. Most problematically, outside states that have banned the practice, they may deduct money from a [...] "tipped employee" [...] for money over the [...] "cash wage required to be paid such an employee on August 20, 1996" [...] – and this was $2.13 per hour. If an employee does not earn enough in tips, the employer must still pay the $7.25 minimum wage. But this means in many states tips do not go to workers: tips are taken by employers to subsidize low pay. Under FLSA 1938 §216(b)-(c) the Secretary of State can enforce the law, or individuals can claim on their own behalf. Federal enforcement is rare, so most employees are successful if they are in a labor union. The Consumer <b>Credit</b> <b>Protection</b> Act of 1968 limits deductions or [...] "garnishments" [...] by employers to 25 per cent of wages, though many states are considerably more protective. Finally, under the Portal to Portal Act of 1947, where Congress limited {{the minimum wage}} laws in a range of ways, §254 puts a two-year time limit on enforcing claims, or three years if an employing entity is guilty of a willful violation.|$|E

40|$|The {{success of}} Commercial Mortgage Backed Securitization (CMBS) {{market in the}} US and the {{internationalization}} of CMBS have {{significant impact on the}} real estate financing landscape in many Asian markets. Innovative structuring of real estate financing via the CMBS framework has been adopted by real estate investment trusts (REITs) in Singapore. In a mailed questionnaire conducted by this study to evaluate the feasibility of CMBS in Singapore, the results showed that 86 % of the respondents were positive on the potential of establishing a CMBS market in Singapore. Banks and finance companies are reluctant to sell the valuable commercial mortgage assets through CMBS because of the current excess liquidity in the market. The fear of disrupting the good relationships with their preferred clients is also another factor that hinders the sale of mortgages by the banks. On the demand side, investors would like to see better supporting services in <b>credit</b> <b>protections,</b> if they were to include CMBS in their portfolio. 83 % of the respondents were in favor of setting up a government sponsored secondary mortgage institution (SMI) to jumpstart a sustainable CMBS market...|$|R
