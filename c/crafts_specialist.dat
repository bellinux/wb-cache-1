40|$|The Pre-Aksumite {{period in}} Eastern Tigrai, {{northern}} Ethiopia witnessed great {{social and economic}} changes in part propelled by expanding of trade relations across the Mediterranean, Red Sea, and extending to South Asia. While past archaeological research has {{tended to focus on}} the external influences driving changes within communities, more recent work has started to explore the local, indigenous aspects, including the formation of <b>craft</b> <b>specialists</b> to cope with the growing economy. Findings of large quantities of stone scrapers at many Pre-Aksumite and Aksumite sites throughout Tigrai, suggests hide processing to be a local tradition forming as a craft specialization. Stone scrapers are traditionally associated with hideworking activities and are still used by many modern hideworker artisans living in southern Ethiopia. Drawing upon ethnoarchaeological and archaeological studies, this dissertation explores the use of stone scrapers as hideworking tools in order to identify and track the formation of <b>craft</b> <b>specialists</b> at the Pre-Aksumite site of Mezber (> 800 BCE-CE 100) and the Pre-Aksumite/Aksumite site of Ona Adi (ca. 50 BCE-CE 700).

Camp Tawonga moved to its current site on the middle fork of the Tuolumne River in 1963. During 2003-2007, Camp Tawonga ran the Oseh Shalom-Sanea al Salam—the Palestinian-Jewish Family Peacemakers Camp—in cooperation with the Jewish-Palestinian Living Room Dialogue. [...] On July 3, 2013, a tree fell at the camp, killing an Arts and <b>Crafts</b> <b>specialist</b> and injuring several others as terrified campers were evacuated to the girl's side field.

50|$|Cardiganshire had a {{substantial}} {{population in the}} early modern period but this declined {{during the nineteenth century}} as wider social and economic developments affected all aspects of Cardiganshire life. Traditional industries were in decline, agriculture was in decline and it was becoming increasingly difficult for a still-rising population to earn a living within their native parishes and communities. By {{the first half of the}} twentieth century, falling livestock prices and greater world competition made farming unprofitable and many residents of Cardiganshire moved to other parts of South Wales, where there were better employment opportunities, and many more emigrated to the United States, Canada, Patagonia and Australia. Another factor was that the owners of the great landed estates, who had for so long dominated the politics of the county, were in many cases heavily in debt. This second factor contributed to the loss of landowner influence in the running of the county, a trend that became very apparent at the first elections to the Cardiganshire County Council in 1889. By the second half of the twentieth century, the declining population trend had gone into reverse. Increasing numbers of retired people were arriving to make their home in the tranquil surroundings, and after the Beacham Commission in the 1960s, the British government realised that the rural way of life in parts of Wales was in crisis, and started to react.

Six statistical tests are employed to determine if historical lineages can be reliably reconstructed using cladistic methods.

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{identify}} craft specialization in the archaeological record has wider ramifications {{for the study of}} prehistoric society, since it is apparent that there is a certain relationship between the organization of craft specialization and social complexity.

We should expect a lack of craft specialization in egalitarian societies, attached specialist production of hypertrophic (i. e., not practically useful) goods in ranked societies, and independent specialist production of labor-cheap (mainly utilitarian) goods in state-level societies. The paper presents the author’s attempts to explore craft specialization in the Swedish Neolithic. Artifact types which are studied include flint axes and flint daggers as well as several groundstone artifact types. Studies of the ease and speed of manufacture, possible manufacturing loci, and standardization are among the means used to identify possible specialization in the Swedish Neolithic...|$|R

Childe also believed that the Urban Revolution had a negative side, in that it led to increased social stratification into classes and the oppression of the majority by a power elite. Childe's concept of [...] "revolutions" [...] were not universally adopted in archaeology, with many believing that the term [...] "revolution" [...] was misleading because the processes of agricultural and urban development were gradual transformations.|$|R

40|$|The visceral {{nature of}} fire was {{exploited}} in the Neolithic and Bronze Age periods in Britain by the burning down of timber buildings and monuments, {{as well as}} the cremation of the dead. These big fires would have created memories, perhaps even ‘flashbulb memories’, and this powerful mnemonic aspect of fire was likely of significance to the social and religious lives of individuals, families and communities. This article introduces the Build N Burn concept, where fires are recreated and deployed alongside public talks, performances, experimental archaeology activities and demonstrations by <b>craft</b> <b>specialists</b> to create memorable and informative public events. Three public engagements to date, two on the island of Arran and one in Caithness, both Scotland, are described here. In each case, we constructed replica timber structures inspired by local prehistoric sites, and then burned these down in a free-to-attend public event at dusk, evoking the culmination of a prehistoric festival. Build N Burn has, at its core, the principle of delivering memorable experiences for the public inspired by prehistory, underpinned by research and experiment, using events which draw on cross-sectoral collaboration and working with local communities. This article offers a critical reflection on work to date, and discusses future potential for such activities, utilizing the mnemonic power and transformational potential of fire for public engagement and experimental archaeology...|$|R

The potters of Paradijon have been drawn into political competition between elite members of the community, which has led to factionalism among the potting community. This research uses a case study approach to identify how traditional, independent potters become involved in elite competition, and the effect such involvement has on traditional pottery manufacture and its material record. The organization of ceramic production has become a mainstay in archaeological investigation. Within the case study context, this research seeks to contribute to the field along several fronts. First, this research re-examines the topic {{of the organization of}} production and suggests that the use of Contingency Theory will advance archaeological understanding of organizational behavior. Second, the participation of independent <b>craft</b> <b>specialists</b> in elite competition is described and explained. Third, a detailed analysis of the traditional technology of production in Paradijon is provided and the rejection of modern pottery technology introduced by the Philippine federal government is examined.

And fifth, this research tests the ability of Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis for discerning factional competition in the material record, and illustrates the ways in which sociopolitical behavior creates patterning in material culture...|$|R
40|$|The {{origin of}} cities {{is a subject}} of major {{interest}} to geographers, economic historians, and archaeologists. One view of their development stipulates that cities are built on a rural economic base. In other words, the process is from the bottom up, with centers ultimately emerging to provide a variety {{of goods and services}} to a population of rural consumers distributed around them. An alternative view is that the development was from the top down. Centers emerged for any num~er of social and political, but once present nascient <b>craft</b> <b>specialists</b> manipulated the economic environment, making the rural countryside increasingly dependent on their goods. This paper utilizes information from the Tuxtla Mountains in southern Veracruz, Meiico, as a basis for looking at early city development. In particular, evidence on obsidian working from the archaeological site of Ranchoapan is applied to evaluate the "countryside first" and "city first" hypotheses. In the Tuxtlas Region it appears that the specialized obsidian working arose from a substratum involving the generalized manufacture of tools by households situated at small sites. The countryside first hypothesis thus has greater explanatory utility in the Tuxtlas than its conceptual alternative. Other crafts such as ceramics production, however, show a better fit to the city first model. The Latin American and Iberian Institute of the University of New Mexic...|$|R

Gamo potters are predominately women, husbands and other male family members occasionally may help with certain aspects of pottery production and distribution. The potter's social standing in Gamo society determines that they have limited farmland, which forces potters to work as full-time <b>craft</b> <b>specialists.</b> Since Gamo society is virilocal, women potters will typically learn their craft in their natal community but then will have to relearn the complex production and distribution sequences once they move to their husband's community. A potter will also encounter a new set of economic conditions at her husband's house that may influence the degree to which family members are dependent upon her skill. A potter's skill can be tested if resources are not available, such as proper clays, room to store and dry her pots, and finding materials for firing. Thus, she has to use her skill to transform the clays into pots that will be economically viable for her family. Furthermore, she will need to forge new relationships with non-potter community members in order for her to trade her pots for money or food. This larger interplay between gender and caste is countered by the individual potter's skill and how potters manage their limited resources as Gamo artisans...|$|R

50|$|The {{founding}} date of {{the city}} of Tzintzuntzan is most likely 1450, during the late post-classic period. The traditional history of the Empire for the 14th and 15th centuries is unclear because {{if it is to be}} believed, both Tarícuri and his nephews ruled for more than ninety years. Records are fairly clear that the consolidation of the empire began in the mid 15th century, producing a tributary state. The bureaucracy was centered in Tzintzuntzan and the empire expanded outside the Lake Pátzcuaro area from 1440 to 1500. This led to a very mixed ethnic composition for the empire, including the capital itself with only ten percent of the population of the lake area was ethnically Purépecha. About 25 to 35 percent of the population consisted of elites, their servants, and resident <b>craft</b> <b>specialists.</b> Political, economic and religious life was controlled from Tzintzuntzan. The site is located on the side of the Yauarato hill which permits a view of most of Lake Pátzcuaro and its shores. The hill protected this site from attack. The pre-Hispanic city of Tzintzuntzan extended from Lake Pátzcuaro to the hills just to the east and had a population of between 25,000 and 30,000 when the Spanish arrived in the 1520s. Purépecha power extended over a wide section of what is now central-west Mexico, encompassing what is now the state of Michoacán and parts of modern Guanajuato, Guerrero and Jalisco states. Despite being the capital of the second largest empire in Mesoamerica when the Spanish conquered Tenochtitlan, the city surrendered to the Spanish without a fight. There are two probable reasons for this. Even before the Spanish themselves arrived, epidemics of their diseases such as smallpox and measles had severely affected the Purépecha population, and likely killed the emperor. A new, young emperor was hastily installed, who had little political experience and hoped to work around Spanish rule, and avoid Tenochtitlán’s fate of utter destruction. This hope ended when the Spanish burned him at the stake.|$|R
