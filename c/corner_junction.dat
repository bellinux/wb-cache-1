25|$|A revised proposal, {{of closing}} the A344 road between Stonehenge Bottom and Byway 12, and closing {{part of the}} B3086 was put forward in 2010.

25|$|The {{final section}} of the M1 was opened to Junction 1 at Staples Corner in 1977. There the {{motorway}} meets the North Circular Road (A406) at a grade separated junction and roundabout. Unrealised plans made in the 1960s {{would have seen the}} motorway continue through the junction on an elevated roadway to end at West Hampstead where it would have met the North Cross Route, the northern {{section of the}} London Motorway Box, a proposed ring of urban motorway around the central area. The layout of the Staples <b>Corner</b> <b>junction</b> was originally built in accordance with these plans although most of the London Ringways Plan had been cancelled by 1973. Around the same time the section between the M10 and Junction 5 was widened from the original two lanes to three.|$|E
2500|$|Ravensworth is {{situated}} {{near to the}} A66 and is 5 miles from the Scotch <b>Corner</b> <b>junction</b> on the A1(M) motorway. Its nearest railway station is Darlington railway station, [...] away. Bus services which operate throughout the day connect the village to the nearby towns of Richmond and Barnard Castle. The village {{is situated}} close to the Yorkshire Dales national park, and is also only one hour from the North Yorkshire Moors and the Lake District national parks. Newcastle and York are one hour's drive away, and Leeds is just over one hour away. A bus service runs between Barnard Castle and Richmond (and vice versa) and runs {{several times a day}} on weekdays; it is operated by Hodgson's Buses of Barnard Castle.|$|E

2500|$|The A3 {{starts at}} King William Street at its {{junction}} with Gracechurch Street in the City of London, crosses London Bridge while entering the London Borough of Southwark, and goes south-west along Borough High Street and Newington Causeway to the Elephant and Castle roundabout. It continues along Newington Butts, and bounds then enters the London Borough of Lambeth on Kennington Park Road which becomes Clapham Road and Clapham High Street. The A3 then turns west (leaving as its straight continuation the A24) as Clapham Common North Side. [...] Along this road, {{it enters the}} London Borough of Wandsworth, after which it runs concurrently with the A205 'South Circular' along Battersea Rise, Wandsworth Common North Side and East Hill, and goes through Wandsworth, and then the A205 carries on west towards Richmond. On West Hill, {{just east of the}} Tibbets <b>Corner</b> <b>junction</b> with the A219 near Putney Heath, the road increases from one lane each way to a three-lanes-each-way dual-carriageway and the speed limit increases from 30mph (48km/h) to 40mph (64km/h). The A3 then continues south-west between Richmond Park and Wimbledon Common, as Kingston Road before beginning to bypass Kingston upon Thames while going through Roehampton Vale. The A3 enters The Royal Borough of Kingston Upon Thames just before Kingston Vale where there is a junction with the A308 for Kingston upon Thames and Richmond Park. The speed limit then increases to 50mph (80km/h) before going under the Coombe Flyover. The A3 then goes on a flyover by Shannon Corner in Raynes Park, before having junctions for New Malden, Tolworth and Hook along the Kingston By-pass.|$|E

40|$|Structure tensors are {{a common}} tool for {{orientation}} estimation in image processing and computer vision. We present a generalization of the traditional second-order model to a higher-order structure tensor (HOST), which is able to model more than one significant orientation, as found in <b>corners,</b> <b>junctions,</b> and multi-channel images. We provide a theoretical analysis {{and a number of}} mathematical tools that facilitate practical use of the HOST, visualize it using a novel glyph for higher-order tensors, and demonstrate how it can be applied in an improved integrated edge, corner, and junctio...|$|R
50|$|The {{church is}} {{elevated}} {{above ground level}} and is constructed of timber with a steeply pitched corrugated metal roof. The roof pitch flattens slightly at the eaves creating a semi bell cast profile. Externally the building is clad with timber weatherboards which extend below the floor level to create a solid skirt to the building. At the <b>corner</b> <b>junctions,</b> the boards are mitred and at the gable ends the weatherboards are slightly separated to create a vent to the roof space. Both the roof and weather board details are typical of Dod's work.|$|R
40|$|When {{visually}} {{exploring the}} environment, humans sequentially direct their gaze to distinct points in that scene. Thus, vision happens by taking {{samples from the}} visual environment. Bottom-up approaches of vision hold low-level im-age features responsible for the selection of fixation points. Occurrences of edges, <b>corners</b> and <b>junctions</b> have shown to correlate with fixation. Intrin-sic dimensionality (iD) is a natural and general measure {{of the complexity of}} image content incorporating previous measures into a coherent approach. Zero-dimensional (i 0 D) image patches correspond to homogeneous surfaces, one-dimensional (i 1 D) ones to edges and parallel lines, while intrinsically two-dimensional (i 2 D) neighborhoods contain <b>corners,</b> <b>junctions</b> and the like. In this thesis, we use eye-tracking on free-viewing subjects. A total of 64 images from four different categories (fractals, man-made objects, natural scenes and faces) are shown to 14 subjects, while eye fixations are recorded. Stimulus pictures are converted into iD feature maps for analysis. The iD algorith...|$|R

It criticised the Department for Transport for what it saw as a 'do-nothing' attitude to the problem and said that the government [...] "must grip the problem of pavement parking once and for all and ensure that it is outlawed throughout the country".|$|R

40|$|Evidence from visual-search {{experiments}} {{is discussed}} {{that indicates that}} there is spatially parallel encoding based on three-dimensional (3 -D) spatial relations between complex image features. In one paradigm, subjects had to detect an odd part of cube-like figures, formed by grouping of <b>corner</b> <b>junctions.</b> Performance with cube-like figures was unaffected {{by the number of}} <b>corner</b> <b>junctions</b> present, though performance was affected when the corners did not configure into a cube. It is suggested from the data that junctions can be grouped to form 3 -D shapes in a spatially parallel manner. Further, performance with cube-like figures was more robust to noncollinearity between junctions than was performance when junctions grouped to form two-dimensional planes. In the second paradigm, subjects searched for targets defined by their size. Performance was affected by a size illusion, induced by linear-perspective cues from local background neighbourhoods. Search was made more efficient when the size illusion was consistent with the real size difference between targets and nontargets, and it was made less efficient when the size illusion was inconsistent with the real size difference. This last result occurred even though search was little affected by the display size in a control condition. We suggest that early, parallel visual processes are influenced by 3 -D spatial relations between visual elements, that grouping based on 3 -D spatial relations is relatively robust to noncollinearity between junctions, and that, at least in some circumstances, 3 -D relations dominate those coded in two-dimensions...|$|R
