40|$|BACKGROUND: Due {{to recent}} {{industrialization}} and inadequately protected workers {{or in other}} words poor supervision on constructive workers habits in our large city of Isfahan <b>cement</b> <b>contact</b> dermatitis is relatively high especially among cement factory workers and constructive personnel. PURPOSES: To investigate the prevalence rate of <b>cement</b> <b>contact</b> dermatitis in <b>cement</b> factory workers in Isfahan. METHODS: A case-control clinical study {{was carried out by}} randomly selecing 150 factory workders and 150 official clerks in a cement factory in Isfahan in 2001. After a complete physical examination, data was recorded in observational checklists. FINDINGS: The percentages of contact dermatitis prevalences in the first and the second groups were 22 &#x 0025; and 5. 3 &#x 0025; respectively. About 60 &#x 0025; of <b>cement</b> workers with <b>contact</b> dermatitis were between 30 - 40 years of age. There was a direct relationship with age in both groups of the workers. In the high-exposure group, the hand eczema along was 70 &#x 0025; but in the other group the percentage of involvement was the same in exposed and unexposed anatomical areas. CONCLUSIONS: There was a direct relationship between occurrence and the severity of involvement and duration of contact in the first group.

40|$|Occupational {{dermatitis}} among cement {{workers is}} a major occupational health concern. The two most important occupational hazards for cement workers are irritant and allergic <b>cement</b> <b>contact</b> dermatitis. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the severity of occupational <b>cement</b> <b>contact</b> dermatitis and the common allergens among cement workers in Taiwan. Methods: A total of 97 cement workers from the Cement Workers’ Association of Tainan City and County participated in this study. A structured questionnaire was used to evaluate the demographic data and work-related activities of these cement workers. A complete skin examination was conducted, and skin manifestations were assessed by a dermatologist. Allergens from European Standard Tray (Chemotechnique Diagnostic AB, Sweden) with a total of 25 substances were used for patch testing. Results: Our results showed that 65 out of 97 cement workers were suffering from occupational <b>cement</b> hand <b>contact</b> dermatitis. The most affected skin area was the hand. Thickening of the dorsal surface of the hand, especially around the metacarpophalangeal joint area, and hyperkeratosis of the palm were the major skin manifestations. The results of the patch test showed that 24 out of 97 were allergic to potassium dichromate, nine were allergic to thiuram mix, nine were allergic to fragrance mix and seven were allergic to cobalt chloride. The final diagnosis, based on the results of the skin examination and the patch test, showed that 43 of 97 cement workers had irritant <b>cement</b> <b>contact</b> dermatitis and 22 had allergic <b>cement</b> <b>contact</b> dermatitis. Conclusion: We conclude that occupational cement hand dermatitis among cement workers is an important and severe issue in Taiwan, and the most common allergens among cement workers are potassium dichromate, thiuram mix, fragrance mix and cobalt chloride. The high positive rate of chromium hypersensitivity among cement workers reflects the urgency to regulate the addition of ferrous sulfate to cement in Taiwan...|$|R
40|$|The Oxford Unicompartmental Knee Replacement (UKR) is a {{commonly}} performed procedure, {{with a good}} clinical outcome at 15 years, however, radiolucent lines are commonly found beneath the tibial tray. With the projected increase in knee arthroplasty, particularly in younger patients, implant longevity is of paramount importance. The aim of this thesis is to understand how fixation is achieved with the Oxford UKR {{and how it can}} be improved. A histological study demonstrated that {{in the presence of a}} radiolucent line the tibial bone-cement interface is made up of a combination of direct bony contact, fibrocartilage and fibrous tissue. The radiolucency is more marked when there is more soft tissue. However in all cases there is some direct bony <b>contact.</b> <b>Cemented</b> and cementless fixation was compared in a randomised controlled study using radiostereometric analysis and fluoroscopic imaging of the interfaces. In the first year the cementless tibial component subsided on average 0. 28 mm and had an increased posterior slope of 0. 40 °, whereas the cemented component only subsided 0. 09 mm, with a 0. 10 ° increase in slope. In the second year both components had very little further subsidence (mean Two designs of lateral UKR were also compared. These had a flat tibial component that predominantly transmits compressive loading, and a domed component that also transmits shear. There was a lower prevalence of radiolucency in the domed tibia (13 % v 60 %), even though there was a similar amount of migration as the cemented medial tibial component. In conclusion radiolucent lines, both partial and complete, are common with cemented components, and may, in part, be a result of compressive loading. They are associated with good long-term results and direct bone <b>cement</b> <b>contact</b> indicating satisfactory fixation. However, they are also associated with increased migration and soft tissue at the interface suggesting that the fixation, although satisfactory, is suboptimal. The cementless components had no complete radiolucencies and low levels of migration in the second year. This suggests that bone ingrowth and secure fixation occurs reliably, and therefore that cementless fixation may be better than cemented for the Oxford UKR.

40|$|Despite the {{widespread}} use of cement as a means of fixation of implants to bone, surprisingly {{little is known about the}} micromechanical behavior in terms of the local interfacial motion. In this work, we utilized digital image correlation techniques to quantify the micromechanics of the cement-bone interface of laboratory-prepared cemented total hip replacements subjected to nondestructive, quasistatic tensile and compressive loading. Upon loading, the majority of the displacement response localized at the contact interface region between cement and bone. The contact interface was more compliant (p = 0. 0001) in tension (0. 0067 +/- 0. 0039 mm/MPa) than compression (0. 0051 +/- 0. 0031 mm/MPa), and substantial hysteresis occurred due to sliding <b>contact</b> between <b>cement</b> and bone. The tensile strength of the cement-bone interface was inversely proportional to the compliance of the interface and proportional to the cement/bone contact area. When loaded beyond the ultimate strength, the strain localization process continued at the <b>contact</b> interface between <b>cement</b> and bone with microcracking (damage) to both. More overall damage occurred to the cement than to the bone. The opening and closing at the contact interface from loading could serve as a conduit for submicron size particles. In addition, the cement mantle is not mechanically supported by surrounding bone as optimally as is commonly assumed. Both effects may influence the longevity of the reconstruction and could be considered in preclinical tests...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{survival}} rate of cemented knee prosthesis depends among other factors on optimal cement-bone contact, nevertheless no standard exists for cementing technique of tibial components. The {{aim of this}} study was to determine which tibial surface preparation technique leads to the best bone-cement contact. Materials and Methods: Human tibial plateau specimens were cleaned in four different ways before cementing: a) no cleaning, b) manual syringe irrigation, c) fracture brush cleaning, and d) pulsatile jet-lavage. The specimens were cut into transverse sections and the bone <b>cement</b> <b>contact</b> distance was calculated for every 10 mm and the cement penetration depth was measured.

The deepest cement penetration (4. 1 mm) again was seen after PJL, the least (0. 7 mm) after no cleaning.
