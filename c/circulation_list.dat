50|$|The daily, {{and later}} weekly, reports {{produced}} by the Home Intelligence Division were circulated within the Ministry of Information and other government departments. The <b>circulation</b> <b>list</b> form summer 1940 stood at around 100 copies. The director of Home Intelligence maintained that their work ‘provided a rapid and effective link between {{the people of the}} country and the machine of Government’. Their work helped to promote an understanding of morale as something which was expressed by a mixture of attitudes and behaviour.The special reports conducted by Home Intelligence after 1941 were used by the Ministry of Information to plan and assess publicity campaigns. Over 60 reports were undertaken on campaigns including ‘Careless Talk Costs Lives’ and Paper Salvage 1939-50.Home Intelligence reports are now used as a primary source by historians researching the ‘Home Front’.|$|E

The Notes frequently included maps. The pressure of work led to the suspension of the weekly and the Outpost began irregular publication of Special Intelligence Reports Each report covered one topic, was concerned with Military Government problems in the Far East and was issued at intervals of ten days to two weeks. As {{in the case of}} the Far East Intelligence Notes, information was drawn from classified sources. The <b>circulation</b> <b>list</b> of the Notes was small but impressive. Copies were sent to all Civil Affairs Training Schools, to the School of Military Government, Charlottesville, Virginia, to the OSS Washington, to the Civil Affairs Division, Washington, to the Provost Marshal General's Office, Washington to CinCPAC (Commander in Chief Pacific), CinCPOA (Commander in Chief Pacific Ocean Areas) and to various OSS outposts.

40|$|Academic medical librarians {{responsible}} for monograph acquisition face a challenging task. From {{the plethora of}} medical monographs published each year, academic medical librarians must select those most useful to their patrons. Unfortunately, none of the selection tools available to medical librarians are specifically intended to assist academic librarians with medical monograph selection. The few short core collection lists that are available are intended {{for use in the}} small hospital or internal medicine department library. As these are the only selection tools available, however, many academic medical librarians spend considerable time reviewing these collection lists and place heavy emphasis on the acquisition of listed books. The study reported here was initiated to determine whether the <b>circulation</b> of <b>listed</b> books in an academic library justified the emphasis placed on the acquisition of these books. Circulation statistics for “listed” and “nonlisted” books in the hematology (WH) section of Indiana University School of Medicine's Ruth Lilly Medical Library were studied.

40|$|Configurations and Software: A Tutorial This paper, {{together}} with the preceding paper by Divilbiss, is intended to provide a background for the characteristics of minicomputers {{and the ways in}} which they can be configured to tackle library problems. As part of the discussion of minicomputer features, an attempt is made to compare and contrast them with larger, general purpose computers. An acquaintance with basic computer concepts is assumed. Concepts of a more technical nature are explained as they are introduced. The first section below discusses configurations; the second section covers minicomputer software. Hardware and architectural features are covered in the paper by Divilbiss. MINICOMPUTER CONFIGURATIONS Minicomputers and their associated peripheral devices can be combined in a great variety of ways, but this variety can be categorized into four basic configuration types: (1) stand-alone batch, (2) stand-alone on-line, (3) front end, and (4) remote concentrator. The first type, stand-alone batch, is the most familiar (see figure 1). In this configuration, the mini looks like and performs like larger batch computers. In most cases the mini will have a card reader and punch, a line printer, tape drives and disks. (The minis in all four configuration types will have operator consoles, but to avoid cluttering the figures, the consoles have been omitted.) The term stand-alone is part of the name of this configuration in order to stress the fact that the mini is not connected to a larger computer. The mini stands alone. The main use of the stand-alone batch configuration is the generation of printed products, e. g., serials <b>lists,</b> purchase orders, <b>circulation</b> <b>lists</b> and overdue notices.
