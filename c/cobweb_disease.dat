40|$|Symptoms {{similar to}} the <b>cobweb</b> <b>disease</b> were {{observed}} on beech mushrooms (Hypsizygus marmoreus) growing in Cheongdo–gun, Gyeongbuk Province, Korea, in May 2013. The causal agent was collected and cultured on potato dextrose agar media at different temperatures (5 – 30 °C). The growth of the isolated fungus, characterized by the production of numerous sclerotia and red pigments, was temperature dependent, with minimum growth at 5 °C and maximum growth at 25 °C. A pathogenicity test revealed that the isolated fungus causes <b>cobweb</b> <b>disease</b> in the host mushroom H. marmoreus (white) {{as well as in}} three other mushrooms–H. marmoreus (brown), Flammulina velutipes, and Pleurotus eryngii–with massive mycelia and few conidia. Phylogenetic analysis of four genes (ITS, RPB 1, RPB 2, and TEF) showed that this isolate has a unique lineage and is distantly related to other species of Cladobotryum that cause the <b>cobweb</b> <b>disease.</b> The results showed that the isolated fungus is a new species, herein named Cladobotryum hypsigum, which causes <b>cobweb</b> <b>disease</b> in H. marmoreus in Korea...|$|E
40|$|<b>Cobweb</b> <b>disease</b> {{symptoms}} {{had been}} found on Hypsizigus marmoreus (Beech mushroom) in Cheongdo–gun, Gyeongbuk province, Korea. The symptoms were white mycelium covered fruit bodies of the mushroom and later, rotten the mushrooms.

This is the first occurrence of <b>cobweb</b> <b>disease</b> on H. marmoreus caused by C. varium in Korea...|$|E
40|$|Cladobotryum spp. are causal {{agents of}} <b>cobweb</b> <b>disease,</b> {{one of the}} most serious {{diseases}} of cultivated mushroom (Agaricus bisporus (Lange) Imbach) in Serbia and worldwide, which affects product quality and yield. The disease symptoms are: cottony fluffy white oryellowish to pink colonies on mushroom casing, rapid colonization of casing surface, covering of host basidiomata by mycelia, and their decay. Prochloraz-Mn has been officially recommended for mushroom cultivation in EU countries. However, inefficiency of prochloraz-Mn has been noted at a level of spotting symptoms of <b>cobweb</b> <b>disease.</b> With regard to cases of resistance evolution and a general threat to the environment and human health, special attention should be focused on good programmes of hygiene, and inventing and developing alternative methods of disease control...|$|E
40|$|From the nineteen-nineties, <b>cobweb</b> <b>disease</b> caused serious {{losses for}} the {{mushroom}} sector in Europe, in the USA, and in Australia (Fletcher & Gaze, 2008), {{so it is}} one of the most notable fungal infections of cultivated white button mushroom (Agaricus bisporus). The aim of this study was to identify <b>cobweb</b> <b>disease</b> (Cladobortyum dendroides) caused cap spotting and brownish rot on the mushroom sporocarp, and to find a proper discrimination method in the case of this infection. Fruiting body samples were divided into 4 groups, a control one and three others treated with different chemicals that are tested against fungal infections. The groups were subdivided into 2 portions and the first was infected with <b>cobweb</b> <b>disease.</b> Images of the caps were recorded and their hyperspectral images were acquired in the wavelength range of 900 – 1700 nm. On the hyperspectral images infected and healthy areas were selected, on these average spectra differences were found around the known water peaks (1200 and 1450 nm). The spatial distribution of the water content can be used for the detection of the spoilage, because the infected areas showed different reflection values at these water absorption peaks. Support Vector Machine method was applied successfully to discriminate between the infected and control groups and Monte Carlo cross-validation was carried out...|$|E
40|$|Cladobotryum dendroides (= Dactylium dendroides) has {{hitherto}} {{been regarded}} as the major causal agent of <b>cobweb</b> <b>disease</b> of the cultivated mushroom, Agaricus bisporus. Nucleotide sequence data for the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of four Cladobotryum/Hypomyces species reported {{to be associated with}} <b>cobweb</b> <b>disease,</b> however, indicate that the most common pathogen is now C. mycophilum. This cobweb pathogen varies somewhat in conidial septation from published descriptions of C. mycophilum and lacks the distinctive colony odor. ITS sequencing revealed minor nucleotide variation which split isolates of the pathogen into three subgroups, two comprising isolates that were sensitive to methylbenzimidazole carbamate (MBC) fungicides and one comprising MBC-resistant isolates. The MBC-resistant isolates, which were only obtained from Ireland and Great Britain, clustered together strongly in randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) PCR analysis, suggesting that they may be clonal. The MBC-sensitive isolates were more diverse. A RAPD fragment of 800 to 900 bp, containing a microsatellite and found in the MBC-resistant isolates, also indicated their clonal nature; the microsatellites of these isolates contained the same number of GA repeats. Smaller, polymorphic microsatellites, similarly comprising GA repeats, in the MBC-sensitive isolates in general correlated with their geographic origin...|$|E

In two commercial and one experimental mushroom-growing room, Cladobotryum conidia were released into the air in direct response to physical disturbance of disease colonies during either crop watering or treatment by covering with salt to 10 mm. Conidia were detected using a Burkard spore trap or agar-based trap plates. A maximum concentration of similar to 25, 000 conidia m(- 3) was recorded in a small (75 -m(3)) experimental growing room in the hour following the salting of 16 cobweb patches (0. 55 m(2)). Concentrations of 100 and 40 conidia m(- 3) were recorded in the two larger commercial growing rooms in the hour following the salting of 18 and 11 patches of cobweb (diameter, approximately 50 to 200 mm), respectively.

40|$|In 2009 - 2010, unusual {{symptoms}} were observed on Pleurotus eryngii grown in mushroom farms in Gyeongnam Province, Republic of Korea. One {{of the main}} symptoms was a cobweb-like growth of fungal mycelia {{over the surface of}} the mushroom. The colonies on the surface rapidly overwhelmed the mushrooms and developed several spores within 3 - 4 days. The colonized surface turned pale brown or yellow. The fruit body eventually turned dark brown and became rancid. Koch’s postulates were completed by spraying and spotting using isolated strains. The phylogenetic tree obtained from the internal transcribed spacer sequence analysis showed that the isolated fungal pathogen corresponded to Cladobotryum mycophilum (99. 5 %). In the fungicide sensitivity tests, the ED 50 values for the isolate with respect to benomyl and carbendazim were from 0. 29 to 0. 31 ppm.

40|$|Four Cladobotryum {{isolates}} {{were collected}} from four different commercially grown mushroom types infected with <b>cobweb</b> <b>disease</b> in Cheongdo-gun and Chilgok-gun of Gyeongbuk Province, Korea in 2010. The isolates were identified as C. myco-philum from Agaricus bisporus and Pleurotus eryngii, C. varium from Flammulina velutipes and Hypsizygus marmoreus. The cultural characteristics of the four isolates were investigated using potato dextrose agar (PDA) media under nine different temperatures ranging from 5 ~ 32 oC. Rapid growth of the isolates to colony diameters of 47 ~ 82 mm was observed at conditions of 18 ~ 22 oC. No growth was observed at 32 oC. C. mycophilum produced a yellowish red pigment while C. varium produced a cream colored pigment after cultivation for 25 days on PDA. Phylogenetic analysis of the internal transcribed spacer region and partial 28 S rDNA from the four isolates confirmed they were C. mycophilum and C. varium. Cross pathogenicity tests revealed that the two isolates of C. mycophilum were highly pathogenic toward three mushroom types, but not toward H. marmoreus. The two isolates of C. varium were less pathogenic than those of C. mycophilum, but were pathogenic toward all mushroom types evaluated...|$|E
40|$|The soil-borne {{pathogen}} Cladobotryum dendroides causes <b>cobweb</b> <b>disease</b> of {{button mushroom}} (Agaricus bisporus) and its significant yield losses. Casing soil disinfection by toxic formaldehyde {{is a widespread}} practice. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the potential of two environmentally friendly substances, colloidal silver and peracetic acid, against C. dendroides. Their biological efficacy (impact on mushroom yield), effectiveness (disease control) and type of interactions between them and the fungicide prochloraz-manganese were evaluated. Black peat/lime casing soil was applied to a colonized substrate with the white button mushroom strain 737, then inoculated with C. dendroides and treated with the fungicide prochloraz-manganse and two environmentally friendly disinfectants based on peracetic acid and colloidal silver. The effects of fungicides on mushroom productivity were evaluated as biological efficacy and calculated as a ratio of fresh weight of total mushroom yield to the weight of dry substrate. Fungicide effectiveness and synergy factor were calculated by Abbott’s (1925) formula. Tests for synergism between prochloraz-manganese and both other substances were performed using Limpel’s formula. The highest biolgical efficacy, exceeding 92. 00, was achieved in treatments with prochlorazmanganese, applied alone or in combination with both other disinfectants.

40|$|Cladobotryum spp. is a {{mushroom}} parasite fungus. Its occurrence in white button mushroom (Agaricus bisporus (Lange) Imbach) commercial crops generates the pathology known as cobweb. This name is associated {{to the white}} fluffy mycelium that grows over the casing and the infected mushrooms; {{in the first stage}} it resembles a spider web that quickly evolves towards a dense mass of sporulation. Another disease symptom is the cap spotting on the mushroom which provokes loss of quality and a significant drop in profitability during the crop cycle. Recent years have seen the widespread occurrence of <b>cobweb</b> <b>disease</b> in Spanish button mushroom crops. Indeed, the presence of the disease has increased notably, resulting in serious economic losses. To provide a global perspective on the impact of the disease, A. bisporus mushroom crops were surveyed over a two year period to estimate the incidence and severity of cobweb along the crop cycle and the season, analyzing the casing material used. <b>Cobweb</b> <b>disease</b> usually appears in Spanish button mushroom crops when they age. Crops in the third flush {{are much more likely to}} be infected than those of the second and first. An early occurrence can lead to widespread infection by the end of the crop cycle. The pathology may appear at any time during the year although its presence and severity is greater in autumn and winter than in spring and summer. No significant differences were observed concerning disease emergence through the casing materials analyzed during the field sampling. Twenty-five Cladobotryum spp. colonies were isolated from commercial crops showing disease symptoms, plated on PDA and preserved. Their evolution and growth in vitro, taxonomic characters and genetic material were studied. The colonies secrete a pigment that becomes deep red and lack the characteristic camphor odour associated to C. mycophilum. Their conidia are big, bacillus in shape and mainly uniseptated while the phyalides are tapered to the tip which is simple and regular. At room temperature, spores germinated two hours after plating on PDA, and the germinative tubes showed a high growth rate. BLAST analysis of the sequenced amplicons revealed the closest degree of similarity to four Cladobotryum mycophilum sequences deposited in the GenBank database. Phylogenetic analysis showed the highest evolutive proximity to several sequences of Cladobotryum mycophilum. Therefore, the causal agent of <b>cobweb</b> <b>disease</b> in Spanish button mushroom crops is Cladobotryum mycophilum (Oudem.) W. Gams&Hoozem. The pathogenicity of Cladobotryum mycophilum was evaluated by applying a conidial solution over several casing types of an Agaricus bisporus germinated crop. Three different peat cased blocks and one mineral cased were checked. The pathology appeared in the inoculated blocks, while control blocks remained healthy. The cultural practices carried out during the crop cycle were those suited to a peat-lime casing, and so it can be affirmed that mineral casing blocks suffered yield reductions that were not directly attributable to the disease. Of note is the fact that all the casing materials used showed infection. Disease-inoculated blocks suffered losses of between 1 % and 13 % due to cobweb. The sooner the pathology appeared, the greater the yield losses registered. The cropping surface colonized by the disease increased as the cycle proceeded, and the eralier the infection appeared, the larger the crop area colonized. Once an outbreak of cobweb is located within the facilities, the individual outbreaks must be controlled. Indeed, it is necessary to treat them prior to sporulation. When not properly treated, conidia spread within crops and will disseminate the infection resulting in higher losses. A thick damp paper splaced over the isolated patches is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease. The response of the colonies to selected fungicides (chlorothalonil, thiophanate-methyl, prochloraz-Mn and thiabendazole) was analyzed in vitro and in vivo. Two of the analyzed strains showed resistant symptoms in vitro towards the benzimidazole fungicides employed. A couple of isolates also exhibited some tolerance to prochloraz-Mn, while all of them were sensitive to chlorothalonil. Prochloraz-Mn was the active substance with the highest selectivity between pathogen and host. On the other hand, chlorothalonil showed the worst selectivity among the evaluated substances. Cobweb control by fungicides was also studied in crop trials cased with peat based material, treated with the selected fungicides and subsequently inoculated with Cladobotryum mycophilum. Cobweb was responsible for yield reductions of up to 17 %. Very poor control was achieved by using thiabendazole. Thiophanate-methyl also proved to be ineffective in coping with <b>cobweb</b> <b>disease,</b> as did chlorothalonil. Prochloraz-Mn was, on the basis of the results, the most effective fungicide among those evaluated for cobweb control. It showed the lowest ED 50, as well as the highest selectivity towards the pathogen. Prochloraz-Mn was likewise the best treatment to prevent the colonization of casing surface by the disease, providing an accurate BE of the crop. In conclusion, mushroom cobweb caused by Cladobotryum mycophilum is a common pathology within Spanish mushroom crops. Isolates of C. mycophilum Type II, resistant to the bencimidazole fungicides, have been detected. Cobweb provokes yield losses in the infected crops. Its presence and severity are more pronounced in autumn and winter, with a higher incidence as the crop cycle progresses. Although prochloraz-Mn is the most efficient fungicide to cope with this pathology, evidences concerning a potential threat to the appearance of resistant strains to this chemical agent are presented in this thesis...|$|E
40|$|The {{benzimidazole}} fungicides thiabendazole and carbendazim, and the imidazole fungicide prochloraz-Mn, {{were tested}} for their efficacy in controlling <b>cobweb</b> <b>disease</b> of mushrooms caused by two Cladobotryum isolates. Isolate 202 A was benzimidazole-sensitive in vitro and cobweb growth on the casing was well controlled by both benzimidazole fungicides in cropping experiments. Carbendazim also controlled {{the development of}} spotting symptoms much more effectively than thiabendazole. A second isolate (192131) was benzimidazole-resistant and was highly resistant to thiabendazole in vitro but it showed some sensitivity to carbendazim in vitro at moderate to high concentrations. Despite this, carbendazim did not control disease symptoms in cropping experiments, confirming that isolate 192 B 1 is cross-resistant to other benzimidazole fungicides. Both isolates showed some sensitivity to prochloraz-Mn in vitro. This fungicide gave between 45 % and 65 % control of cobweb growth on the casing caused by either 202 A or 192 B 1 but gave no control of spotting symptoms. Reducing the fungicide application volume did not give enhanced disease control. The emergence of benzimidazole resistance reduces the value of benzimidazoles in the control of mushroom pathogens. However, the lack of effective alternatives means they continue to have utility in cases where pathogens are still sensitive but this requires regular monitoring of pathogen populations for resistance.

In two commercial and one experimental mushroom-growing room, Cladobotryum conidia were released into the air in direct response to physical disturbance of disease colonies during either crop watering or treatment by covering with salt to 10 mm. Conidia were detected using a Burkard spore trap or agar-based trap plates. A maximum concentration of ∼ 25, 000 conidia m− 3 was recorded in a small (75 -m 3) experimental growing room in the hour following the salting of 16 cobweb patches (0. 55 m 2). Concentrations of 100 and 40 conidia m− 3 were recorded in the two larger commercial growing rooms in the hour following the salting of 18 and 11 patches of cobweb (diameter, approximately 50 to 200 mm), respectively. In controlled experiments, disturbed conidia were dispersed rapidly throughout a small growing room, with 91 to 97 % of conidia settling out within 15 min. Eighty-five percent of conidia settled out within a 0. 5 -m radius when air-conditioning fans were switched off, consistent with airborne spore dispersal. Alternative methods for treating diseased areas to minimize conidial release and distribution were investigated and included covering disease colonies with damp paper tissue prior to salt application (tissue salting) and holding a dust extractor above disease colonies during salt application. Both methods resulted in no detectable airborne conidia, but the tissue paper salting technique was more convenient. Prevention of airborne conidial release and distribution is essential to avoid mushroom spotting symptoms, secondary colonies, and early crop termination...|$|E
40|$|Hypomyces aurantius is a mycoparasite {{that causes}} <b>cobweb</b> <b>disease,</b> a most serious disease of {{cultivated}} mushrooms. Intra-species identification {{is vital for}} disease control, however the lack of genomic data makes development of molecular markers challenging. Small size, high copy number, and high mutation rate of fungal mitochondrial genome makes it {{a good candidate for}} intra and inter species differentiation. In this study, the mitochondrial genome of H. H. a 0001 was determined from genomic DNA using Illumina sequencing. The roughly 72 kb genome shows all major features found in other Hypocreales: 14 common protein genes, large and small subunit rRNAs genes and 27 tRNAs genes. Gene arrangement comparison showed conserved gene orders in Hypocreales mitochondria are relatively conserved, with the exception of Acremonium chrysogenum and Acremonium implicatum. Mitochondrial genome comparison also revealed that intron length primarily contributes to mitogenome size variation. Seventeen introns were detected in six conserved genes: five in cox 1, four in rnl, three in cob, two each in atp 6 and cox 3, and one in cox 2. Four introns were found to contain two introns or open reading frames: cox 3 -i 2 is a twintron containing two group IA type introns; cox 2 -i 1 is a group IB intron encoding two homing endonucleases; and cox 1 -i 4 and cox 1 -i 3 both contain two open reading frame (ORFs).

40|$|The most {{commonly}} cultivated basidiomycetes worldwide and in Serbia are button mushroom (Agaricus bisporus), oyster mushroom (Pleurotus sp.) and shiitake (Lentinus edodes). Production of their fruiting bodies is severely afflicted by fungal, bacterial, and viral pathogens that {{are able to}} cause diseases which affect yield and quality. Major A. bisporus fungal pathogens include Mycogone perniciosa, Lecanicillium fungicola, and Cladobotryum spp., the causal agents of dry bubble, wet bubble, and <b>cobweb</b> <b>disease,</b> respectively. Various Trichoderma species, the causal agents of green mould, also affect all three kinds of edible mushrooms. Over the past two decades, green mould caused by T. aggressivum has been the most serious disease of button mushroom. Oyster mushroom is susceptible to T. pleurotum and shiitake to T. harzianum. The bacterial brawn blotch disease, caused by Pseudomonas tolaasii, is distributed globally. Disease control on mushroom farms worldwide is commonly based on the use of fungicides. However, evolution of pathogen resistance to fungicides after frequent application, and host sensitivity to fungicides are serious problems. Only a few fungicides are officially recommended in mushroom production: chlorothalonil and thiabendazol in North America and prochloraz in the EU and some other countries. Even though decreased sensitivity levels of L. fungicola and Cladobotryum mycophilum to prochloraz have been detected, disease control is still mainly provided by that chemical fungicide. Considering such resistance evolution, harmful impact to the environment and human health, special attention should be focused on biofungicides, both microbiological products based on Bacillus species and various natural substances of biological origin, together with good programs of hygiene. Introduction of biofungicides has created new possibilities for crop protection with reduced application of chemicals...|$|E
