40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was made to {{establish}} a system which could calculate ice cream formulation online and is available on the Internet to ice cream manufacturer and education. The revised simplex method of linear programming model was applied in this system. This system was designed by adopting Microsoft Windows Server 2003 as operation system and was written with ASP. NET coordinated with Microsoft Access database. The system includes seven segments in terms of setting up basic data (user personal information, ingredients, composition items, ingredient composition and price), formulation calculation, least cost ice cream formulation, reports (ingredient composition, formulation calculation and least cost ice cream formulation), user's help manual, supplementary booklet and contact programmer. Users must go through registration before login this system and could input data on the forms of active pages directly. By choosing or editing usage of ice cream ingredients, ice cream formulation calculation was then processed and related mix composition and unit price was then provided. By choosing <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>ingredient</b> and its limited usage, formulation requirement and total amount of mix, the least cost ice cream formulation was therefore derived. Shadow price and opportunity cost are also provided in this system for sensitivity analysis and help users to make decision as a reference source. 本研究之目的在建立一套可於線上計算冰淇淋配方之系統，以提供產業界與學界於網際網路上使用。本系統之數學運算模式為線性規劃法（LP；Linear Programming）中之修正單純法（Revised simplex method），採用Microsoft Windows Server 2003 作業系統，以動態網頁程式ASP.

40|$|Here {{we present}} an {{analytical}} technique for the measurement {{and evaluation of}} changes in chronologically sequenced assemblages. To illustrate the method, we studied the cultural evolution of European cooking as revealed in seven cook books dispersed over the past 800 years. We investigated if changes in the set <b>of</b> commonly used <b>ingredients</b> were mainly gradual or subject to fashion fluctuations. Applying our method to {{the data from the}} cook books revealed that overall, there is a clear continuity in cooking over the ages – cooking is knowledge that is passed down through generations, not something (re-) invented by each generation on its own. Looking at three main <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>ingredients</b> separately (spices, animal products and vegetables), however, disclosed that all ingredients do not change ac-cording to the same pattern. While choice of animal products was very conservative, chang-ing completely sequentially, changes in the choices of spices, but also of vegetables, were more unbounded. We hypothesize that this may be due a combination of fashion fluctua-tions and changes in availability due to contact with the Americas during our study time peri-od. The presented method is also usable on other assemblage type data, and can thus be of utility for analyzing sequential archaeological data from the same area or other similarly organized material...|$|R

The {{purpose of this}} commentary is to provide guidelines to authors and reviewers for articles on one <b>category</b> <b>of</b> supple-ment <b>ingredients,</b> botanicals. The botanicals in the studies pub-lished by the AJCN tend to fall into 1 of 2 groups: 1) plants as foods containing nonessential bioactive constituents that may provide health benefits beyond basic nutrition, and 2) plants as herbs, specifically those used as phytomedicines. Research in these areas is relevant to clinical nutrition, but both topics repre-sent relatively new territory to many AJCN reviewers, readers, and contributors. Although studies of botanicals are unique in many respects, the research should be evaluated with the same basic criteria applied to other types of investigations. For exam-ple, a study cannot be evaluated or replicated unless the test materials are properly identified and characterized. Investigators must provide an accurate and complete description of the botan-ical test material {{regardless of whether it}} is a finished product, commercial ingredient, extract, or single chemical constituent. For herbal preparations, investigators are advised to follow the criteria used by researchers in the field of pharmacognosy. Finally, the quality of research related to botanical dietary sup-plements would be improved and cross-study comparisons facil-itated if standard reference materials and certified methods of analysis were more broadly available.

40|$|Graduation date: 2002 Linear oligosacchardies of 1, 4 linked β-D-glucopyranose are {{commonly}} referred to as cellodextrins (CD) or cellooligosaccharides (CO). They are of interest to those working in disciplines involving cellulose chemistry because they are often used as model substrates for cellulose itself. They are of interest to food scientists and nutritionists because they are easily incorporated into foods as non-digestible oligosaccharides, a <b>category</b> <b>of</b> food <b>ingredients</b> that is thought to be beneficial lo human health. The intent of the research presented in this thesis was to evaluate the potential of using cellulose supports for the chromatographic separation of soluble CDs differing in their degree of polymerization (DP; a numerical value indicating the number of glucose substituents per molecule). Soluble CDs range in DP from 2 to 8. Thin layer chromatography (TLC), using cellulose-coated TLC plates, was used as a model chromatographic system. Mixed CD preparations, containing CDs ranging in DP from 2 to 8 were prepared by incomplete acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of cellulose. The DP profiles of the different CD preparations were qualitatively demonstrated by TLC using silica-coated plates, an organic solvent-based mobile phase, and a standard carbohydrate visualizing reagent (p-anisaldehye in sulfuric acid). CD-preparations were then chromatographed on cellulose-coated TLC plates. Visualization of the chromatographed CDs was accomplished using a silver nitrate-sodium hydroxide reagent system, a reducing-sugar visualizing reagent. The silver nitrate-sodium hydroxide system was found to be the most appropriate, based on detection limits, simplicity and safety, of the several visualization reagents tested. Eight different mobile phases, all aqueous-based, were tested as potential solvents for the resolution of CDs, differing in DP, on cellulose-coated tlc plates at room temperature. The optimum solvent was found to be 60...|$|R

40|$|The present review {{focuses on}} the {{mechanisms}} of mutagenic action and the carcinogenic risk <b>of</b> two <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> botanical <b>ingredients,</b> namely the flavonoids with quercetin as an important bioactive representative, and the alkenylbenzenes, namely safrole, methyleugenol and estragole. For quercetin a metabolic pathway for activation to DNA-reactive species may include enzymatic and/or chemical oxidation of quercetin to quercetin ortho-quinone, followed by isomerisation of the ortho-quinone to quinone methides. These quinone methides are suggested to be the active alkylating DNA-reactive intermediates. Recent results have demonstrated the formation of quercetin DNA adducts in exposed cells in vitro. The question {{that remains to be}} answered is why these genotoxic characteristics of quercetin are not reflected by carcinogenicity. This might in part be related to the transient nature of quercetin quinone methide adducts, and suggests that stability and/or repair of DNA adducts may need increased attention in in vitro genotoxicity studies. Thus, in vitro mutagenicity studies should put more emphasis on the transient nature of the DNA adducts responsible for the mutagenicity in vitro, since this transient nature of the formed DNA adducts may play an essential role in whether the genotoxicity observed in vitro will have any impact in vivo. For alkenylbenzenes the ultimate electrophilic and carcinogenic metabolites are the carbocations formed upon degradation of their 1 '-sulfooxy derivatives, so bioactivation of the alkenylbenzenes to their ultimate carcinogens requires the involvement of cytochromes P 450 and sulfotransferases. Identification of the cytochrome P 450 isoenzymes involved in bioactivation of the alkenylbenzenes identifies the groups within the population possibly at increased risk, due to life style factors or genetic polymorphisms leading to rapid metaboliser phenotypes. Furthermore, toxicokinetics for conversion of the alkenylbenzenes to their carcinogenic metabolites and kinetics for repair of the DNA adducts formed provide other important aspects that have {{to be taken into account}} in the high to low dose risk extrapolation in the risk assessment on alkenylbenzenes. Altogether the present review stresses that species differences and mechanistic data have to be taken into account and that new mechanism- and toxicokinetic-based methods and models are required for cancer risk extrapolation from high dose experimental animal data to low dose carcinogenic risks for man...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MTech (Consumer Science: Food and Nutrition)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2007 Labels are {{the source}} of {{information}} about the contents of food products and must be correct so that consumers are not misled and can make informed product choices. However, food label information is often incorrect, misleading or just insufficient. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the labelling errors and concerns that occurred in specific <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> the South African processed food market. Randomly selected food product labels (N= 246) were evaluated that represented the selected <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> processed foods (N= 7), namely: breakfast cereal (9 %), savoury snacks (13 %), sweet snacks (29 %), non-refrigerated meals (7 %), refrigerated meals (9 %), soups and sauces (25 %) and convenience desserts and baked goods (8 %). A pre-tested labelling checklist was used to evaluate each food label according to the food labelling areas that could impact consumer health considering the current South African labelling regulations published in 1993, the draft of these regulations published in 2002, and the further new proposed draft regulations. Labelling errors found induded the use of prohibited statements and not identifying compound ingredients (19 % and 12 % of the products respectively). A labelling concern was also the lack of identification of the fatsloils used (61 % of the products). Further concerns identified included the lack of additive-free and allergen-free claims. For example, significant differences (p<O. 05) were found between the number of products claiming to be aclditive-free and those that could have made such ctaims but did not. A real concern was the listing <b>of</b> <b>ingredients</b> <b>of</b> unknown origin with allergenicity potential (80 % of the products). The breakfast cereal category contained the most eneigy and nutrient claims and nutritional education information, with most errors identified in the categories refrigerated meals and soups and sauces, and most concerns in the category savoury snacks.
