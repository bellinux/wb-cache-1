40|$|Effects of salt, <b>chili</b> and {{turmeric}} <b>powder</b> on {{the production}} of high quality dried fish products from Bombay duck (Harpodon nehereus) under open sun drying was investigated. Five different types of dried products (T 1 -T 5) were produced and studied. Moisture content in T 3 decreased more rapidly to below 16 % within 28 hrs of drying compared to those treated with other treatments (temperature varied from 24. 6 °C to 34 °C and relative humidity varied between 60 % and 48 %). Drying process was very slow in control samples where it took 32 hrs for reaching the moisture level to 18. 75 %.

40|$|The {{study of}} fungal {{contamination}} {{in food and}} mycotoxicoses is a priority today, both internationally and nationally. The {{purpose of this study}} is to have a general view over the quality of the most common spices that are sold in Romanian markets, by assessing the degree of fungal, bacterial and mycotoxin contamination in pepper and <b>chili</b> <b>powders.</b> Methods: we tested four types of spices: white pepper, black pepper, sweet and hot <b>chili</b> <b>powders</b> from 12 different distributing companies, summing a total of 35 sample types. The fungal and bacterial load was assessed by Standard Plate Count, while the mycotoxin content by High-performance liquid chromatography. Environmental conditions (humidity, pH) and the selling price for each product were also followed. Results: Fungi were observed in 72. 7 % of black pepper samples, 33. 3 % in white pepper, 30 % in sweet chili and 25 % in hot chili products. The most common isolated fungus was Aspergillus spp., while Rhizopus, Mucor, Fusarium, Penicillium, Absidia species were found, in smaller percent. Four producers (44. 4 %) presented fungal contamination of over 10 3 CFU/g and two producers (22. 2 %) presented no fungal contamination in their products. Bacterial contamination was found in 85. 7 % of the tested products, consisting mostly in Bacillus spp. Aflatoxin B 1 was present in all the tested products, mostly in black pepper (mean value 126. 3 ng/g); Ochratoxin A was present in sweet chili (mean value 328 ng/g) and Zearalenone in hot chili (mean value 604 ng/g) and sweet chili (mean value 382 ng/g). Conclusions: all spices presented either fungal contamination, mycotoxin contamination, or both. The high humidity and the high pH of spices represent favorable conditions for fungal growth. The selling price was partly related to the physic-chemical conditions and microbiological quality of the spices...|$|R

A member's testicles might be fried in oil, or melted plastic dripped onto his skin. Between interrogations, prisoners would be tied up in tiny cells. If the cells were full, Seale writes, they might be buried with a pipe in their mouths for air and water; if Abu Nidal wanted them dead, a bullet would be fired down the pipe instead.|$|E
