50|$|Rapid {{advances}} {{in the implementation of}} digital signal processing allowed echo cancellers to be made smaller and more cost-effective. In the 1990s, echo cancellers were implemented within voice switches for the first time (in the Northern Telecom DMS-250) rather than as standalone devices. The integration of echo cancellation directly into the switch meant that echo cancellers could be reliably turned on or off on a <b>call-by-call</b> basis, removing the need for separate trunk groups for voice and data calls. Today's telephony technology often employs echo cancellers in small or handheld communications devices via a software voice engine, which provides cancellation of either acoustic echo or the residual echo introduced by a far-end PSTN gateway system; such systems typically cancel echo reflections with up to 64 milliseconds delay.|$|E
5000|$|Where {{blocking}} {{is applied}} on a <b>call-by-call</b> basis (that is, {{at the time}} a call is made), subscribers can block their caller ID by dialing a special code (a vertical service code, or VSC) before making a call.

This special code does not block the information from companies using call capture technology.

When CNID is blocked at the caller's request, the number is actually transmitted through the entire telephone network, with the [...] "presentation withheld" [...] flag set; the destination CO is expected to honor this flag, but sometimes does not—especially when the destination phone number is served by an ISDN PRI.|$|E

The simulator is a pure time-true type as opposed to a <b>call-by-call</b> type simulator. It is also characterized as a batch-type simulator. The entire simulation duration is divided into short time intervals of equal duration, t: During t; a batch processing of call origination or termination events is executed and the time-points of these events are sorted. The number of sorting executions is drastically reduced compared to a <b>call-by-call</b> simulator, resulting in considerable timesaving. The proposed data structures of the simulator can be implemented by a general-purpose programming language and are well fitted to parallel processing techniques for implementation on parallel computers, for further savings of execution time. We have first implemented the simulator in a sequential computer and then we have applied parallelization techniques to achieve its implementation on a parallel computer. In order to simplify the parallelization procedure, we dissociate the core simulation from the built-in call-level functions (e. g. bandwidth control or dynamic routing) of the network. The key point for a parallel implementation is to organize data by virtual paths (VPs) and distribute them among processors, which all execute the same set of instructions on this data.
