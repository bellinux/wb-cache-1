40|$|The {{production}} {{of high quality}} concrete pipes is an energy intensive process, leading to a high energy consumption, and {{to a lot of}} noise, vibration, and dust. This is to a large extent {{due to the fact that}} the concrete has to be <b>compacted</b> <b>by</b> <b>vibration</b> needles, or even by centrifugal techniques. Considering the new technology of self-compacting concrete, the working conditions in the factory can significantly be improved, and a lower energy consumption can be obtained. This paper tries to quantifiy the ecological profit when a concrete pipe factory is shifting its production to self-compacting concrete technology. Information on reduction of noise and vibration is given. The service life of the moulds will be increased. The energy consumption is estimated to be reduced with 1. 0 GWh during one year of production for the case study considered. The energy savings are translated into an approach based on eco points...|$|R

Focus was on density, sphericity of the grains and average value and frequency distribution of coordination number. The 3 D study was preceded by a 2 D one on ellipsoidal disks that offered interesting information, too. Packing has been widely studied in physics and mathematics. IVIostly, spherical grains have been considered. However, outcomes of similar studies as discussed herein were recently published in the international literatures. Optimum shape conditions were revealed by our experiments, relevant for optimum aggregate packing in concrete technology Further, information is obtained on the parameters that reflect packing conditions in an optimum way The present study involved dense and loose random packing conditions relevant for concrete <b>compacted</b> <b>by</b> <b>vibration</b> and self-consolidating concrete.

40|$|The {{apparently}} premature corrosion {{of steel}} reinforcement in reinforced concrete structures exposed to marine environments {{continues to be}} a matter of concern in practice despite decades of research effort and much research funding expenditure and despite much practical experience. Herein results are reported of a long-term (10 year) study of the influence of alkalis on the corrosion initiation and progression of 6 mm diam. reinforcing bars centrally embedded in 40 x 40 x 160 mm concrete specimens. These were made with seawater as mixing water and with a variety of mix proportions including some with added alkalis. All were equally well <b>compacted</b> <b>by</b> <b>vibration.</b> After 10 years continuous exposure in a fog-room only a limited amount of corrosion initiation was observed. These results are in stark contrast with those reported in the famous paper by Shalon & Raphael (1959) who found serious corrosion of reinforcement after only 1 - 2 years exposure for all mixes. It is shown herein that the corrosion loss trends in those tests are similar to those of steel exposed directly to seawater. This indicates that in the 1959 tests the concrete provided little protection against reinforcement corrosion. The reasons for this are considered herein and the practical implications discussed...|$|R
40|$|Published in Physical Review E 25 pagesIn {{this third}} and ﬁnal paper of a series, elastic {{properties}} of numerically simulated isotropic packings of spherical beads assembled by different procedures {{and subjected to}} a varying conﬁning pressure P are investigated. In addition P, which determines the stiffness of contacts by Hertz's law, elastic moduli are chieﬂy sensitive to the coordination number, the possible values of which are not necessarily correlated with the density. Comparisons of numerical and experimental results for glass beads in the 10 kPa − 10 MPa range reveal similar differences between dry samples <b>compacted</b> <b>by</b> <b>vibrations</b> and lubricated packings. The greater stiffness of the latter, {{in spite of their}} lower density, can hence be attributed to a larger coordination number. Voigt and Reuss bounds bracket bulk modulus B accurately, but simple estimation schemes fail for shear modulus G, especially in poorly coordinated conﬁgurations under low P. Tenuous, fragile networks respond differently to changes in load direction, as compared to load intensity. The shear modulus, in poorly coordinated packings, tends to vary proportionally to the degree of force indeterminacy per unit volume. The elastic range extends to small strain intervals, in agreement with experimental observations. The origins of nonelastic response are discussed. We conclude that elastic moduli provide access to mechanically important information about coordination numbers, which escape direct measurement techniques, and indicate further perspectives...|$|R

40|$|During {{the last}} decade, {{concrete}} technology {{has made an}} enormous advance through the introduction of self-compacting concrete. This application of nanaotechnology in construction provides benefits {{from the perspective of}} materials technology and environmental protection and is presenting diverse opportunities to engineers and architects alike. Good quality concrete is <b>compacted,</b> traditionally <b>by</b> <b>vibration.</b> This book defines the key properties that make fresh concrete self-compacting and outlines test methods for its assessment. It covers the basic principles and underlying scientific theory, practical advice for production of SCC and its use in construction practice, and is illustrated by practical case studies and applications. All stages of the self-compacting concrete construction process are reviewed, from selection of materials, mix design and mixing process to transport, placing and finishing. Significant completed projects are described which illustrate the potential benefits and key aspects of the new self-compacting concrete technology in practice. Self-Compacting Concrete will be essential reading for practising/consulting engineers and other construction professionals, including some architects, supervisory, management and site staff of medium to large contractors and concrete producers. Postgraduates and advanced undergraduates in civil and structural engineering, construction materials, particularly concrete technology, researchers in these disciplines, research and trade organisations will all find this book of great value and practical use...|$|R
40|$|There is a {{relative}} {{lack of understanding of}} the process of <b>compacting</b> concrete <b>by</b> <b>vibration,</b> especially in hot and dry weathers where some problems may arise when delaying the casting of concrete. The Research on the effect of vibration on concrete strength has indicated that the vibration of fresh concrete immediately after casting is very important. The experimental study has been carried out to investigate the effects of delaying vibration, revibration and repeated vibration of concrete to help better understanding of the effects and processes involved. The study reports on the test results of nine medium workability mixes and six high workability mixes investigated using a vibrating table for different vibration time. The cubes (150 mm size) were used and tested after 3, 7, 28, 90 days, beams (100 mm × 100 mm × 500 mm) and cylinder (300 mm height 150 mm dia.) were used and tested after 28 days in an attempt to study the effects of delay in vibration, revibration and repeated vibration on the development of concrete strength. It is concluded that vibration of concrete should be performed promptly after casting it. Revibration improved the strength when it was carried out within the first one hour. The repeated vibration at closer intervals produced positive effects on concrete strengt...|$|R
40|$|Reinforcement of soil {{enables a}} soil slope or wall to be {{retained}} at angles steeper than the soil material’s angle of repose. Geosynthetic Reinforced Soil (GRS) systems enable shortened construction time, lower cost, increased seismic performance and potentially improve aesthetic benefits over their conventional retaining wall counterparts such as gravity and cantilever type retaining walls. Experience in previous earthquakes such as Northridge (1994), Kobe (1995), and Ji-Ji (1999) indicate good performance of reinforced soil retaining walls under high seismic loads. However, this good performance {{is not necessarily}} due to advanced understanding of their behaviour, rather this highlights the inherent stability of reinforced soil against high seismic loads and conservatism in static design practices. This is an experimental study {{on a series of}} seven reduced-scale GRS model walls with FHR facing under seismic excitation conducted using a shake-table. The models were 900 mm high, reinforced by five layers of stiff Microgrid reinforcement, and were founded on a rigid foundation. The soil deposit backfill was constructed of dry dense Albany sand, <b>compacted</b> <b>by</b> <b>vibration</b> (average Dr = 90 %). The influence of the L/H ratio and wall inclination on seismic performance was investigated by varying these important design parameters throughout the testing programme. The L/H ratio ranged from 0. 6 – 0. 9, and the walls were primarily vertical except for one test inclined at 70 o to the horizontal. During testing, facing displacements and accelerations within the backfill were recorded at varying levels of shaking intensity. Mechanisms of deformation, in particular, were of interest in this study. Global and local deformations within the backfill were investigated using two methods. The first utilised coloured horizontal and vertical sand markers placed within the backfill. The second utilised high-speed camera imaging for subsequent analysis using Geotechnical Particle Image Velocimetry (GeoPIV) software. GeoPIV enabled shear strains to be identified within the soil at far smaller strain levels than that rendered visible by eye using the coloured sand markers. The complementary methods allowed the complete spatial and temporal development of deformation within the backfill to be visualised. Failure was predominantly by overturning, with some small sliding component. All models displayed a characteristic bi-linear displacement-acceleration curve, with the existence of a critical acceleration, below which deformations were minor, and above which ultimate failure occurs. During failure, the rate of sliding increased significantly. An increase in the L/H ratio from 0. 6 to 0. 9 caused the displacement-acceleration curve to be shallower, and hence the wall to deform less at low levels of acceleration. Accelerations at failure also increased, from 0. 5 g to 0. 7 g, respectively. A similar trend of increased seismic performance was observed for the wall inclined at 70 o to the horizontal, when compared to the other vertical walls. Overturning was accompanied by the progressive development of multiple inclined shear surfaces from the wall crest {{to the back of the}} reinforced soil block. Failure of the models occurred when an inclined failure surface developed from the lowest layer of reinforcement to the wall crest. Deformations largely confirmed the two-wedge failure mechanism proposed by Horii et al. (2004). For all tests, the reinforced soil block was observed to demonstrate non-rigid behaviour, with simple shearing along horizontal planes as well as strain localisations at the reinforcement or within the back of the reinforced soil block. This observation is contrary to design, which assumes the reinforced soil block to behave rigidly...|$|R
