40|$|Many cosmic ray (CR) {{experiments}} have confirmed the lepton excess in CR lepton spectra at ≳ 30 GeV, {{which can be}} explained both by astrophysical sources and dark matter (DM) annihilation or decay. A <b>cross</b> <b>check</b> is needed. But current direct detection cannot probe the leptonic favored DM particles with mass in the range 100 GeV - 10 TeV which derived from indirect detection. In this letter, we propose a novel and feasible scenario to provide a <b>cross</b> <b>check</b> {{on the existence of}} such DM particles, via hydrogen-atmosphere pulsating white dwarfs (DAVs) in DM-dense environments. An important observable has been proposed and corresponding estimations have been made. The estimation show that the potential sensitivity on the m_χ - σ_χ,e plane could be extended to a region with 5 GeV≲ m_χ≲ 10 ^ 4 GeV and σ_χ,e≳ 10 ^- 40 cm^ 2, which could give us a <b>cross</b> <b>check</b> on the existence of the leptonic favored DM particles with indirect DM detection in near future.

30|$|The {{procedure}} of proposed solution is simply described as below. The source node (SN) sends RREQ to each node, and sends packets to the node which replies the RREP packet. The intermediate node (IN) transmits next hop node (NHN) and DRI {{table to the}} SN, then the SN <b>cross</b> <b>checks</b> its own table and the received DRI table to determine the IN's honesty. After that, SN sends the further request to IN's NHN for asking its routing information, including the current NHN, the NHN's DRI table and its own DRI table. Finally, the SN compares the above information by <b>cross</b> <b>checking</b> to judge the malicious nodes in the routing path.|$|R
