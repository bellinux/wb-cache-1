Calcium carbonate (<b>CaCO3)</b> and calcium sulfate (CaSO4) are particularly abundant minerals.

25|$|In 1989, a researcher, Ken Simmons, {{introduced}} <b>CaCO3</b> {{into the}} Whetstone Brook in Massachusetts.

Although his experiment was a success, it did {{increase the amount of}} aluminium ions {{in the area of the}} brook that was not treated with the limestone. This shows that <b>CaCO3</b> can be added to neutralize the effects of acid rain in river ecosystems. Currently calcium carbonate is used to neutralize acidic conditions in both soil and water. Since the 1970s, such liming has been practiced on a large scale in Sweden to mitigate acidification and several thousand lakes and streams are limed repeatedly.|$|E

The Babylonians and Assyrians used bitumen to bind together burnt brick or alabaster slabs.

In larger shells, a ventral cap of <b>CaCO3</b> that underlies the tablets of aragonitic nacre continues to thicken.|$|E
25|$|Oxygen is also cycled {{between the}} {{biosphere}} and lithosphere. Marine organisms in the biosphere create calcium carbonate shell material (<b>CaCO3)</b> that {{is rich in}} oxygen. When the organism dies, its shell is deposited on the shallow sea floor and buried over time to create the limestone sedimentary rock of the lithosphere. Weathering processes initiated by organisms can also free oxygen from the lithosphere. Plants and animals extract nutrient minerals from rocks and release oxygen in the process.|$|E

Chara, a rooted aquatic plant that concentrates both calcium carbonate (<b>CaCO3)</b> and silicon dioxide (SiO2), is a common associate of Valvata utahensis. However the species occurs on a variety of substrate types including both fine sediments and more coarse substrates in areas both with and without macrophytes.|$|E
25|$|The average pH of {{the water}} in the Gaborone Dam is 7.95 as of February 2006. The {{concentration}} of calcium in the reservoir was 14.87milligrams per litre from April 2001 to August 2006. During the same period, the concentration of calcium carbonate (<b>CaCO3)</b> was 57.73 milligrams per litre, slightly over Botswana's ideal concentration which means the water is hard. Also during the same period, the chloride concentration was 6.44mg/l, the fluoride concentration was 0.54mg/l, the potassium concentration was 6.72mg/l, and the sodium concentration was 10.76mg/l.|$|E
25|$|In Connecticut, Elimia virginica is at {{the edge}} of its range, and is most likely limited to hard water {{habitats}} only. During collections made in the Connecticut River, the snail was found to inhabit regions with water temperatures up to 27.5°C, dissolved oxygen between 7 and 14 ppm, <b>CaCO3</b> concentration from 42-160 ppm, pH from 7.6-9.0 and CO2 concentration from 0-10 ppm. However, at some of these sites, population abundance was very low and/or decreasing, especially in conditions of high water temperature and alkalinity.|$|E
25|$|Calcium {{carbonate}} is {{a chemical}} compound with the formula <b>CaCO3.</b> It {{is a common}} substance found in rocks as the minerals calcite and aragonite (most notably as limestone, which contains both of those minerals) and is {{the main component of}} pearls and the shells of marine organisms, snails, and eggs. Calcium carbonate is the active ingredient in agricultural lime and is created when calcium ions in hard water react with carbonate ions to create limescale. It is medicinally used as a calcium supplement or as an antacid, but excessive consumption can be hazardous.|$|E
25|$|While the {{possibility}} of carbonates on Mars has been {{of great interest to}} exobiologists and geochemists alike, there was little evidence for significant quantities of carbonate deposits on the surface. In the summer of 2008, the TEGA and WCL experiments on the 2007 Phoenix Mars lander found between 3–5wt% (percent by weight) calcite (<b>CaCO3)</b> and an alkaline soil. In 2010, analyses by the Mars Exploration Rover Spirit identified outcrops rich in magnesium-iron carbonate (16–34 wt%) in the Columbia Hills of Gusev crater. The magnesium-iron carbonate most likely precipitated from carbonate-bearing solutions under hydrothermal conditions at near-neutral pH in association with volcanic activity during the Noachian Period.|$|E
25|$|The {{effect of}} the latter is {{especially}} evident in day-to-day life {{of people who have}} hard water. Water in aquifers underground can be exposed to levels of CO2 much higher than atmospheric. As such water percolates through calcium carbonate rock, the <b>CaCO3</b> dissolves according to the second trend. When that same water then emerges from the tap, in time it comes into equilibrium with CO2 levels in the air by outgassing its excess CO2. The calcium carbonate becomes less soluble as a result and the excess precipitates as lime scale. This same process is responsible for the formation of stalactites and stalagmites in limestone caves.|$|E
25|$|The {{carbonate}} minerals {{are those}} were the main anionic group is carbonate, 2−. Carbonates tend to be brittle, many have rhombohedral cleavage, and all react with acid. Due to the last characteristic, field geologists often carry dilute hydrochloric acid to distinguish carbonates from non-carbonates. The reaction of acid with carbonates, most commonly found as the polymorph calcite and aragonite (<b>CaCO3),</b> relates to the dissolution and precipitation of the mineral, which is a key {{in the formation of}} limestone caves, features within them such as stalactite and stalagmites, and karst landforms. Carbonates are most often formed as biogenic or chemical sediments in marine environments. The carbonate group is structurally a triangle, where a central C4+ cation is surrounded by three O2− anions; different groups of minerals form from different arrangements of these triangles. The most common carbonate mineral is calcite, and is the primary constituent of sedimentary limestone and metamorphic marble. Calcite, <b>CaCO3,</b> can have a high magnesium impurity; under high-Mg conditions, its polymorph aragonite will form instead; the marine geochemistry in this regard can be described as an aragonite or calcite sea, depending on which mineral preferentially forms. Dolomite is a double carbonate, with the formula CaMg(CO3)2. Secondary dolomitization of limestone is common, where calcite or aragonite are converted to dolomite; this reaction increases pore space (the unit cell volume of dolomite is 88% that of calcite), which can create a reservoir for oil and gas. These two minerals species are members of eponymous mineral groups: the calcite group includes carbonates with the general formula XCO3, and the dolomite group constitutes minerals with general formula XY(CO3)2.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the leading}} {{hypotheses}} for why ancient Mars was wetter than today is that a thick, carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere created a global greenhouse, that warmed the surface enough for liquid water to occur in large amounts. Carbon dioxide ice in today's polar caps is too limited in volume to hold that ancient atmosphere. If a thick atmosphere ever existed, it was either blown into space by solar wind or impacts, or reacted with silicate rocks to become trapped as carbonates in Mars' crust. One of the goals that drove CRISM's design was to find carbonates, {{to try to solve}} this question about what happened to Mars' atmosphere. And one of CRISM's most important discoveries was the identification of carbonate bedrock in Nili Fossae in 2008. Soon thereafter, landed missions to Mars started identifying carbonates on the surface; the Phoenix Mars lander found between 3–5 wt% calcite (<b>CaCO3)</b> at its northern lowland landing site, while the MER Spirit rover identified outcrops rich in magnesium-iron carbonate (16–34 wt%) in the Columbia Hills of Gusev crater. Later CRISM analyses identified carbonates in the rim of Huygens crater which suggested that there could be extensive deposits of buried carbonates on Mars. However, a study by CRISM scientists estimated that all of the carbonate rock on Mars holds less that the present Martian atmosphere worth of carbon dioxide. They determined that if a dense ancient Martian atmosphere did exist, it is probably not trapped in the crust.|$|E
500|$|Marble {{has a more}} {{coarse-grained}} texture than limestone, {{but both}} are made of calcite (<b>CaCO3).</b> Caves often develop when slightly acidic groundwater dissolves calcite along natural fractures in the rock. A reversal of the dissolving process can create flowstone and dripstone such as stalactites, which hang from cave ceilings like icicles, and stalagmites, cone-shaped masses that form on cave floors, usually directly below stalactites. These structures form when acidic groundwater with {{a high concentration of}} dissolved calcite drips slowly from the ceiling of an air-filled cave, becomes less acidic, and leaves some of its calcite behind as a solid precipitate. Oregon Caves includes a variety of cave formations created through precipitation of calcite.

500|$|The {{potential}} of X-ray crystallography {{for determining the}} structure of molecules and minerals—then only known vaguely from chemical and hydrodynamic experiments—was realized immediately.

Other early structures included copper, calcium fluoride (CaF2, also known as fluorite), calcite (<b>CaCO3)</b> and pyrite (FeS2) in 1914; spinel (MgAl2O4) in 1915; the rutile and anatase forms of titanium dioxide (TiO2) in 1916; pyrochroite Mn(OH)2 and, by extension, brucite Mg(OH)2 in 1919;. Also in 1919 sodium nitrate (NaNO3) and caesium dichloroiodide (CsICl2) were determined by Ralph Walter Graystone Wyckoff, and the wurtzite (hexagonal ZnS) structure became known in 1920.|$|E
2500|$|The {{chemistry}} {{of this process}} is explained in the [...] "Sodium Hydroxide" [...] section in the carbon dioxide scrubber page.
