5|$|III. Scherzo: Allegro vivace – Trio: Un poco più lento. The A {{section of}} the scherzo uses a playful leaping rolled chord figure that is rhythmically and harmonically {{reminiscent}} of the opening bars of the sonata. The B section {{is dominated by the}} juxtaposition of two distant tonal realms. It commences in C-major for a rollicking theme that is abruptly interrupted by a downward-rushing C-sharp minor scale without any modulatory preparation, in a striking cyclic reference to the climax of the preceding movement's middle section. Following this outburst, the B section quietly ends in C-sharp minor a grace-note melody identical in <b>contour</b> <b>to</b> a figure from the theme of the Andantino (2–1–7–1–3–1), before modulating back to the movement's tonic. C major returns in the concluding A section, this time more tonally integrated into its A-major surroundings, by modulatory sequences. The ternary form trio in D major uses hand crossing to add melodic accompaniment to the chordal theme, and is rhythmically and harmonically based on the opening of the Allegro.|$|E
25|$|The {{dominant}} framework {{used for}} American English from the 1940s to the 1990s {{was based on}} the idea of pitch phonemes, or tonemes. In the work of Trager and Smith there are four contrastive levels of pitch: low (1), middle (2), high (3), and very high (4). (Unfortunately, the important work of Kenneth Pike on the same subject had the four pitch levels labelled in the opposite way, with (1) being high and (4) being low). In its final form, the Trager and Smith system was highly complex, each pitch phoneme having four pitch allophones (or allotones); there was also a Terminal <b>Contour</b> <b>to</b> end an intonation clause, as well as four stress phonemes. Some generalizations using this formalism are given below. It {{should be noted that the}} American linguist Dwight Bolinger carried on a long campaign to argue that pitch contours were more important in the study of intonation than individual pitch levels.|$|E
25|$|Like weaving, {{knitting}} is {{a technique}} for producing a two-dimensional fabric made from a one-dimensional yarn or thread. In weaving, threads are always straight, running parallel either lengthwise (warp threads) or crosswise (weft threads). By contrast, the yarn in knitted fabrics follows a meandering path (a course), forming symmetric loops (also called bights) symmetrically {{above and below the}} mean path of the yarn. These meandering loops can be easily stretched in different directions giving knit fabrics much more elasticity than woven fabrics. Depending on the yarn and knitting pattern, knitted garments can stretch as much as 500%. For this reason, knitting was initially developed for garments that must be elastic or stretch in response to the wearer's motions, such as socks and hosiery. For comparison, woven garments stretch mainly along one or other of a related pair of directions that lie roughly diagonally between the warp and the weft, while contracting in the other direction of the pair (stretching and contracting with the bias), and are not very elastic, unless they are woven from stretchable material such as spandex. Knitted garments are often more form-fitting than woven garments, since their elasticity allows them to <b>contour</b> <b>to</b> the body's outline more closely; by contrast, curvature is introduced into most woven garments only with sewn darts, flares, gussets and gores, the seams of which lower the elasticity of the woven fabric still further. Extra curvature can be introduced into knitted garments without seams, as in the heel of a sock; the effect of darts, flares, etc. can be obtained with short rows or by increasing or decreasing the number of stitches. Thread used in weaving is usually much finer than the yarn used in knitting, which can give the knitted fabric more bulk and less drape than a woven fabric.|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} {{strongly}} requested to get automatically a precise {{digital elevation model}} from a topographic contour image. But, because of overlapping other symbols, the image usually includes many broken <b>contours.</b> <b>To</b> connect these correctly, a global restoration technique considering states of adjacent contours is needed. In this {{paper we propose a}} new global restoration method using an extended Voronoi diagram that produces a relationship graph of adjacent contours. Based on an idea of reference contours, it determines pairs of broken <b>contours</b> <b>to</b> be connected and interpolates their gaps with spline curves.

40|$|We {{present an}} object {{recognition}} system that locates an object, identifies its parts, and segments out its contours. A key distinction of our {{approach is that}} we use long, salient, bottom-up image <b>contours</b> <b>to</b> learn object shape, and to achieve object detection with the learned shape. Most learning methods rely on one-to-one matching of <b>contours</b> <b>to</b> a model. However, bottom-up image contours often fragment unpredictably. We resolve this difficulty by using many-to-one matching of image <b>contours</b> <b>to</b> a model. To learn a descriptive object shape model, we combine bottom-up contours from a few representative images. The goal is to allow most of the contours in the training images to be many-to-one matched to the model. For detection, our challenges are inferring the object contours and part locations, in addition to object location. Because the locations of object parts and matches of contours are not annotated, they appear as latent variables during training. We use the latent SVM learning formulation to discriminatively tune the many-to-one matching score using the max-margin criterion. We evaluate on the challenging ETHZ shape categories dataset and outperform all existing method...|$|R

2500|$|Umberto Boccioni {{exhibited}} his Futurist sculptures in Paris in 1913 {{after having}} studied {{the works of}} Archipenko, Brâncuși, Csaky, and Duchamp-Villon. Boccioni's background was in painting, as his Futurist colleagues, but unlike others was impelled to adapt the subjects and atmospheric faceting of Futurism to sculpture. For Boccioni, physical motion is relative, in opposition with absolute motion. The Futurist {{had no intention of}} abstracting reality. [...] "We are not against nature," [...] wrote Boccioni, [...] "as believed by the innocent late bloomers [...] of realism and naturalism, but against art, that is, against immobility." [...] While common in painting, this was rather new in sculpture. Boccioni expressed in the preface of the catalogue for the First Exhibition of Futurist Sculpture his wish to break down the stasis of sculpture by the utilization of diverse materials and coloring grey and black paint of the edges of the <b>contour</b> (<b>to</b> represent chiaroscuro). Though Boccioni had attacked Medardo Rosso for adhering closely to pictorial concepts, Lipchitz described Boccioni's 'Unique Forms' as a relief concept, just as a futurist painting translated into three-dimensions.|$|E

2500|$|The river {{rises from}} springs on the chalk uplands {{close to the}} [...] <b>contour</b> <b>to</b> the {{south-west}} of Tittleshall. It initially flows {{to the east and}} then to the south to cross under the B1145 Litcham Road to the west of Mileham. Turning to the west, it passes through the south of Litcham and enters a series of lakes at Lexham Hall, where it is joined by Broad Water. Lexham Hall is a large grade I listed mansion, which was built around 1700. During the Second World War, the estate was occupied by the army, and the grounds and house were severely damaged. It was bought by William Foster in 1946, who gradually restored it, assisted by the architect Jim Fletcher Watson. The gardens {{are open to the public}} on selected weekends during the year, although the house is not. Continuing westwards, the river reaches the lakes of West Lexham Hall. It is joined by a stream flowing northwards from Little Dunham before it crosses under the A1065 road and flows through Emanuel's Common. The disused Newton water mill is passed before the river reaches the village of Newton. By the time it reaches Castle Acre it is below the [...] contour.|$|E
2500|$|The Solesmes monks also determined, {{based on}} their research, {{performance}} practice for Gregorian chant. Because of the ambiguity of medieval musical notation, the question of rhythm in Gregorian chant is contested by scholars. Some neumes, such as the pressus, do indicate the lengthening of notes. Common modern practice, following the Solesmes interpretation, is to perform Gregorian chant with no beat or regular metric accent, in which time is free, allowing the text to determine the accent and the melodic <b>contour</b> <b>to</b> determine phrasing. By the 13th century, with {{the widespread use of}} square notation, it is believed that most chant was sung with each note getting approximately an equal value, although Jerome of Moravia cites exceptions in which certain notes, such as the final notes of a chant, are lengthened. [...] The Solesmes school, represented by Dom Pothier and Dom Mocquereau, supports a rhythm of equal values per note, allowing for lengthening and shortening of note values for musical purposes. A second school of thought, including Wagner, Jammers, and Lipphardt, supports different rhythmic realizations of chant by imposing musical meter on the chant in various ways. [...] Musicologist Gustave Reese said that the second group, called mensuralists, [...] "have an impressive amount of historical evidence on their side" [...] (Music in the Middle Ages, p.146), but the equal-note Solesmes interpretation has permeated the musical world, apparently due to its ease of learning and resonance with modern musical taste.|$|E
2500|$|Extended wear {{hearing aids}} are hearing devices that are non-surgically {{placed in the}} ear canal by a hearing professional. [...] The {{extended}} wear hearing aid represents the first [...] "invisible" [...] hearing device. These devices are worn for 1–3 {{months at a time}} without removal. [...] They are made of soft material designed to <b>contour</b> <b>to</b> each user and can be used by people with mild to moderately severe hearing loss. Their close proximity to the ear drum results in improved sound directionality and localization, reduced feedback, and improved high frequency gain. While traditional BTE or ITC hearing aids require daily insertion and removal, extended wear hearing aids are worn continuously and then replaced with a new device. [...] Users can change volume and settings without the aid of a hearing professional. The devices are very useful for active individuals because their design protects against moisture and earwax and can be worn while exercising, showering, etc. [...] Because the device’s placement within the ear canal makes them invisible to observers, extended wear hearing aids are popular with those who are self-conscious about the aesthetics of BTE or ITC hearing aid models. As with other hearing devices, compatibility is based on an individual’s hearing loss, ear size and shape, medical conditions, and lifestyle. [...] The disadvantages include regular removal and reinsertion of the device when the battery dies, inability to go underwater, earplugs when showering, and for some discomfort with the fit since it is inserted deeply in the ear canal, {{the only part of the}} body where skin rests directly on top of bone.|$|E

On the other side, the back or slope of the hill does not crumble down, but is gradually worn away by the streams; and as these are always more considerable, both in velocity and weight, {{at the bottom of the}} slope than the top, the ground is faster worn away at the bottom, and the straight slope is cut to a curve of continually increasing steepness.

She had a pair of eyes set straight in her head, faultless in form, and perfectly inexpressive. She had a nose equally straight, but perhaps a little too coarse in dimensions.

I do not doubt that the flatness of {{the floor of the}} Momay valley is caused by the combined action of the streams that drained the three glaciers which met here; for the tendency of retiring glaciers is to level the floors of valleys, by giving an ever-shifting direction to the rivers which drain them, and which spread detritus in their course. Supposing these glaciers to have had no terminal moraines, they might still have forced immense beds of gravel into positions that would dam up lakes between the ice and the flanks of the valleys, and thus produce much terracing on the latter.* [We are still very ignorant of many details of ice action, and especially of the origin of many enormous deposits which are not true moraines. These, so conspicuous in the lofty Himalayan valleys, are not less so in those of the Swiss Alps: witness that broad valley in which Grindelwald village is situated, and which is covered to an immense depth with angular detritus, moulded into hills and valleys; also the whole broad open Upper Rhone valley, above the village of Munster, and below that of Obergestelen. The action of broad glaciers on gentle slopes is to raise their own beds by the accumulation of gravel which their lower surface carries and pushes forward. I have seen small glaciers thus raised 300 feet; leaving little {{doubt in my mind that}} the upper Himalayan valleys were thus choked with deposit 1000 feet thick, of which indeed the proofs remain along the flanks of the Yangma valley. The denuding and accumulating effects of ice thus give a <b>contour</b> <b>to</b> mountain valleys, and sculpture their flanks and floors far more rapidly than sea action, or the elements. After a very extensive experience of ice in the Antarctic ocean, and in mountainous countries, I cannot but conclude that very few of our geologists appreciate the power of ice as a mechanical agent, which can hardly be over-estimated, whether as glacier, iceberg, or pack ice, heaping shingle along coasts.] ...|$|E
