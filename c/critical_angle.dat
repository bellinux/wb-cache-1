5|$|Dragonflies {{generate}} lift in {{at least}} four ways at different times, including classical lift like an aircraft wing; supercritical lift with the wing above the <b>critical</b> <b>angle,</b> generating high lift and using very short strokes to avoid stalling; creating vortices; and vortex shedding. Some families appear to use special mechanisms, as for example the Libellulidae which take off rapidly, their wings beginning pointed far forward and twisted almost vertically. Dragonfly wings behave highly dynamically during flight, flexing and twisting during each beat. Among the variables are wing curvature, length and speed of stroke, angle of attack, forward/back position of wing, and phase relative to the other wings.|$|E
5|$|In trap-building species, an average-sized larva digs a pit about 2in (5cm) {{deep and}} 3in (7.5cm) wide at the edge. This {{behavior}} {{has also been}} observed in the Vermileonidae (Diptera), whose larvae dig {{the same sort of}} pit to feed on ants. Having marked out the chosen site by a circular groove, the antlion larva starts to crawl backwards, using its abdomen as a plough to shovel up the soil. By the aid of one front leg, it places consecutive heaps of loosened particles upon its head, then with a smart jerk throws each little pile clear of the scene of operations. Proceeding thus, it gradually works its way from the circumference towards the center. As it slowly moves round and round, the pit gradually gets deeper and deeper, until the slope angle reaches the <b>critical</b> <b>angle</b> of repose (that is, the steepest angle the sand can maintain, where it {{is on the verge of}} collapse from slight disturbance). When the pit is completed, the larva settles down at the bottom, buried in the soil with only the jaws projecting above the surface, often in a wide-opened position on either side of the very tip of the cone. The steep-sloped trap that guides prey into the larva's mouth while avoiding crater avalanches is one of the simplest and most efficient traps in the animal kingdom.|$|E
25|$|Internal brilliance—the {{percentage}} of incident light reflected {{back to the}} viewer from the rear (pavilion) facets—relies on careful consideration of a cut's interfacial angles {{as they relate to}} diamond's RI. The goal is to attain total internal reflection (TIR) by choosing the crown angle and pavilion angle (the angle formed by the pavilion facets and girdle plane) such that the reflected light's angle of incidence (when reaching the pavilion facets) falls outside diamond's <b>critical</b> <b>angle,</b> or minimum angle for TIR, of 24.4°. Two observations can be made: if the pavilion is too shallow, light meets the pavilion facets within the <b>critical</b> <b>angle,</b> and is refracted (i.e., lost) through the pavilion bottom into the air. If the pavilion is too deep, light is initially reflected outside the <b>critical</b> <b>angle</b> {{on one side of the}} pavilion, but meets the opposite side within the <b>critical</b> <b>angle</b> and is then refracted out the side of the stone.|$|E

25|$|Fiber {{with large}} core {{diameter}} (greater than 10micrometers) may be analyzed by geometrical optics. Such fiber is called multi-mode fiber, from the electromagnetic analysis (see below). In a step-index multi-mode fiber, rays of light are guided along the fiber core by total internal reflection. Rays {{that meet the}} core-cladding boundary at a high angle (measured relative to a line normal to the boundary), greater than the <b>critical</b> <b>angle</b> for this boundary, are completely reflected. The <b>critical</b> <b>angle</b> (minimum angle for total internal reflection) {{is determined by the}} difference in index of refraction between the core and cladding materials. Rays that meet the boundary at a low angle are refracted from the core into the cladding, and do not convey light and hence information along the fiber. The <b>critical</b> <b>angle</b> determines the acceptance angle of the fiber, often reported as a numerical aperture. A high numerical aperture allows light to propagate down the fiber in rays both close to the axis and at various angles, allowing efficient coupling of light into the fiber. However, this high numerical aperture increases the amount of dispersion as rays at different angles have different path lengths and therefore take different times to traverse the fiber.|$|E
25|$|When light {{traveling}} in an optically dense medium hits a boundary at a steep angle (larger than the <b>critical</b> <b>angle</b> for the boundary), {{the light is}} completely reflected. This is called total internal reflection. This effect is used in optical fibers to confine light in the core. Light travels through the fiber core, bouncing back and forth off {{the boundary between the}} core and cladding. Because the light must strike the boundary with an angle greater than the <b>critical</b> <b>angle,</b> only light that enters the fiber within a certain range of angles can travel down the fiber without leaking out. This range of angles is called the acceptance cone of the fiber. The size of this acceptance cone {{is a function of the}} refractive index difference between the fiber's core and cladding.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to analyze the {{relationship}} between the <b>critical</b> contact <b>angle</b> and the torque angle in an orthodontic bracket and archwire assembly in 3 dimensions. Three-dimensional mathematical models were created with geometric bracket-archwire parameters that included 2 slot sizes, 3 bracket widths, and 3 to 4 wire sizes. From this, 3 -dimensional mathematical equations (3 DMEs) for the <b>critical</b> contact <b>angle</b> and the maximum torque that result in <b>critical</b> contact <b>angles</b> of 0 were derived and calculated. To evaluate the effects of archwire-bracket parameters on <b>critical</b> contact <b>angles,</b> analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed at the significance level of P. 05. For all bracket-archwire combinations, the <b>critical</b> contact <b>angle</b> decreased as bracket width, torque angle, and wire size increased. Therefore, all bracket-archwire parameters except slot height had an effect on the <b>critical</b> contact <b>angle.</b> Results of the <b>critical</b> contact <b>angle</b> produced from our 3 DMEs were the same as those produced by 3 D computer-aided design (SolidWorks Corp, Concord, Mass), thus confirming the validity of our derived equations. In addition, the effect of a beveled edge was investigated in some archwires. Furthermore, torsional play angles were calculated and found to be similar to those in previous reports. The results of this study provide theoretic and experimental bases for clinical orthodontic practice and indicate that torque angles should be included in the evaluation of the <b>critical</b> contact <b>angle.</b> (Am J Orthod Dentofacial Orthop 2003; 123 : 64 - 73...|$|R

The cavity is tilted by an angle θ around its lower horizontal edge and is heated and cooled from two opposite tilted sides.

We then yield the <b>critical</b> <b>angles</b> where multiple solutions that were initially found for θ ≈ 0 ◦ disappear, eventually resulting in the single steady roll solution found in the heated-from-the-sides configuration (θ = 90 ◦). We confirm the existence of <b>critical</b> <b>angles</b> during the transition θ : 0 ◦ → 90 ◦, and we demonstrate that such angles are a consequence of either singularities or collisions of bifurcation points in the Rayleigh-number-θ parameter space.

25|$|A diamond's fire is {{determined}} by the cut's crown height and crown angle (the crown being {{the top half of the}} stone, above the girdle), and the size and number of facets that compose it. The crown acts as a prism: light exiting the stone (after reflection from the pavilion facets) should meet the crown facets at as great an angle of incidence from the normal as possible (without exceeding the <b>critical</b> <b>angle)</b> in order to achieve the greatest fanning out or spread of spectral colors. The crown height is related to the crown angle, the crown facet size, and the table size (the largest central facet of the crown): a happy medium is sought in a table that is not too small (which would result in larger crown facets and greater fire at the expense of brilliance) or too large (which would result in smaller crown facets and little to no fire).|$|E

30|$|Geckos’ {{ability to}} move on steep {{surfaces}} depends on their excellent adhesive structure, timely adjustments on locomotor behaviors, and elaborates control on reaction forces. However, it is still unclear how they can generate a sufficient driving force that is necessary for locomotion, while ensuring reliable adhesion on steep inclines. We measured the forces acting on each foot and recorded the contact states between feet and substrates when geckos encountered smooth inclination challenges ranging from 0 ° to 180 °. The <b>critical</b> <b>angles</b> of the resultant force vectors of the front and hind-feet increased {{with respect to the}} incline angles. When the incline angle became greater than 120 °, the <b>critical</b> <b>angles</b> of the front- and hind-feet were similar, and the averages of the <b>critical</b> <b>angles</b> of the front- and hind-feet were both smaller than 120 °, indicating that the complicated and accurate synergy among toes endows gecko’s foot an obvious characteristic of “frictional adhesion” during locomotion. Additionally, we established a contact mechanical model for gecko’s foot in order to quantify the contribution of the frictional forces generated by the heel, and the adhesion forces generated by the toes on various inclines. The synergy between multiple contact mechanisms (friction or adhesion) is critical for the reliable attachment on an inclined surface, which is impossible to achieve by using a single-contact mechanism, thereby increasing the animal’s ability to adapt to its environment.|$|R
