40|$|Generally, ostomy is a {{purposeful}} con-nection of the lumen of the intestine with abdominal integuments by surgery. The study presents practical solutions {{related to}} care for the <b>colostomy</b> <b>patient,</b> i. e. an ostomy on the large intestine. The following issues will be discussed: reg-ulating the defecation cycle, risk con-nected with improper selection of osto-my equipment, instruction on colostomy irrigation with practical advice and irri-gation equipment supply. The knowledge of these rules and mastering them in practice is to provide ostomy patients not only with highest-standard care and help but also to prepare them for dealing with problems independently, i. e. for self-care.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was to explore factors related to stress in outpatients with {{permanent}} colostomies, using a convenience sample. Subjects were selected from one medical center in southern Taiwan. The Stress of <b>Colostomy</b> <b>Patients</b> Scale and demographic data were collected using questionnaires either at the colorectal outpatient department or in the home of <b>colostomy</b> <b>patients.</b> Seventy-three subjects with colostomies participated in the study. Other diseases and caregivers of <b>colostomy</b> <b>patients</b> influenced overall stress in outpatients with permanent colostomies. The five major stressors were: “I have urination problems”; “I feel tired easily owing to physical decline”; “I can't travel freely because of my colostomy”; “I worry about recurrence of the disease”; and, “I suffer from insomnia”. This study provides important information for assessing the stress level of outpatients with permanent colostomies and for developing nursing assessment tools for <b>colostomy</b> <b>patients.</b> To alleviate the overall stress of <b>colostomy</b> <b>patients</b> and to help them return to the activities of daily living before the operation, health care professionals could design individual nursing care plans based on data from assessment tools...|$|R

40|$|There {{are about}} 10 - 11 {{thousand}} <b>colostomy</b> <b>patients</b> in the Czech Republic nowadays. As {{the number of}} these patients goes up a system of complex nurse treatment should be prepared. Applying a colostomy bag means a deep inroad into patients´ personal, working and social lives. A stoma nurse help the patients to overcome new problems and difficulties. She also guides them {{in the care of}} stoma itself {{as well as of the}} diet. A specific nutrition is necessary to be followed as it can improve patients´ lives a lot. The aim of this work is to find out how much <b>colostomy</b> <b>patients</b> and nurses know about nutrition and drinking regime before patients are discharged home and if nurses in South Bohemian hospitals inform the patients. There were two hypotheses stated at the beginning. H 1 : <b>Colostomy</b> <b>patients</b> have enough information about nutrition and drinking regime before they are discharged. H 2 : Nurses inform patients about nutrition and drinking regime. To collect all necessary data, the method of questioning was used. Forty patients and sixty nurses in surgical wards were asked to fill in the questionnaires. The rate of return in all hospitals mentioned above was 100 %. The patient questionnaires consisted of twenty questions and the nurse questionnaires of eighteen.

40|$|AIM: This paper {{reports a}} study whose {{aim was to}} assess the quality of care in ostomy {{patients}} seen from a patient perspective. BACKGROUND: A stoma operation causes profound changes in a patient's life because of resulting physical damage, disfigurement, loss of bodily function, and change in personal hygiene. Such changes are a cause of major concern for patients and raise important issue for the quality of care. METHODS: The study group comprised patients who had undergone a colostomy for rectal cancer or an ileostomy for ulcerative colitis, all attending a stoma outpatient clinic. Quality of care was assessed using the identity-oriented dimension of the validated questionnaire 'Quality of Care from the Patient's Perspective'. Forty-two ileostomy and 49 <b>colostomy</b> <b>patients</b> completed the questionnaire. RESULT: While the vast majority of patients in both groups thought that most topics in the questionnaire were important, most rated many aspects of their quality of care as unsatisfactory. One-third of the <b>colostomy</b> <b>patients</b> and one-half of the ileostomy patients were dissatisfied with the information they received about the results of medical examinations and laboratory tests, and an even higher proportion was dissatisfied with their opportunities to participate in the decision-making process or to discuss sexual matters. Stoma-related complications, which occurred in 71 % of the ileostomy patients and in 43 % of the <b>colostomy</b> <b>patients,</b> had no impact on these results. CONCLUSION: Information and counselling for patients having ostomies, both on the part of specialist nurses and colorectal surgeons, appeared to deficient, suggesting that standards for quality of care require continuous evaluation and revision...|$|R
40|$|Aim. The aim of {{this study}} was to explore and {{describe}} the content of telephone intervention conversations conducted by an enterostomal nurse with patients discharged home with a colostomy. Background. People discharged home with a new colostomy often encounter stoma-related difficulties. Postdischarge care with telephone follow-up by an enterostomal nurse is a helpful way to provide support for patients and ensure continuity of care. There is a paucity of studies reporting the content of telephone follow-up of <b>colostomy</b> <b>patients.</b> Information on the content of such follow-up is important in helping to formulate telephone call protocols that can help these patients. Design. A qualitative exploratory study conducted in a university-based cancer centre in China. Methods. The contents of 25 intervention phone calls to <b>colostomy</b> <b>patients</b> from January-August 2009 were subject to qualitative content analysis. Results. Five themes emerged from the qualitative content analysis: 'education for stoma care', 'access to stoma care', 'encouraging stoma self-care', 'resuming normal living' and 'general postoperative problems'. Conclusions. <b>Colostomy</b> <b>patients</b> experienced stoma-related problems and difficulties after discharge, most of which could be effectively managed via telephone follow-up by an enterostomal nurse. The telephone follow-up satisfied patients' need for information and facilitated their adjustment to the permanent stoma. The findings suggested that patients had unmet needs after discharge and needed follow-up on returning home. Relevance to clinical practice. This study provides important information to guide practice and education. The themes extracted from the qualitative content analysis provide a useful framework to guide the nurse in discussing care with the stoma patients and ensuring patients' adjustment to the permanent stoma. Further work can be done using this framework to develop protocols as standards of care and education materials when educating nurse specialists in stoma care. School of Nursin...|$|R
40|$|AbstractINTRODUCTIONStercoral {{perforation}} of {{the colon}} has rarely been reported. Only 3 cases of stercoral perforation {{of the colon}} proximal to an end colostomy have been reported. We present two cases of stercoral perforation of the colon in end <b>colostomy</b> <b>patients.</b> PRESENTATION OF CASEA 70 -year-old man who had undergone abdomino-perineal excision for anal cancer was referred for left lower quadrant pain and fever. Stercoral perforation was discovered along the distal descending colon, proximal to the end sigmoid <b>colostomy.</b> The <b>patient</b> underwent segmental resection of the colon and revision of the stoma and was discharged on postoperative day 32. A 71 -year-old woman who had undergone abdomino-perineal excision for distal rectal cancer with preoperative chemoradiation presented fever with 2 days of low abdominal pain. The patient had sacral bone and lung metastases from rectal cancer and suffered from chronic constipation. Stercoral perforation was found around the sigmoid colon, just proximal to the end sigmoid <b>colostomy.</b> The <b>patient</b> underwent simple repair of the perforated colon through the parastomal incision. On postoperative day 8, leakage occurred at the repair site. Segmental resection of the colon and revision of the stoma were performed. She was discharged 44 days after the initial surgery. DISCUSSIONSegmental resection of the perforated colon, rather than simple repair, appears to improve postoperative outcomes.

40|$|I chose "Colostomy as {{a stigma}} in clients in their {{productive}} {{age and the}} task of the nurse in cooperation with these clients as the topic of my bachelor thesis for several reasons. On the one hand, I think that colostomy is talked about a lot all the time, but if really want to obtain any literature, very little is available. And a large number of <b>colostomy</b> <b>patients</b> call for more sources of information. And on the other hand, I find this topic close for personal reasons: there are <b>colostomy</b> <b>patients</b> in my own family and among my close friends. Whether they have colostomy after a tumorous disease during Crohn disease, they still suffer from very similar problems that lead to a certain stigmatization that they both consciously and unconsciously bring into their mind. This is why this topic occurred to me. It is necessary to survey what stigma is, <b>colostomy</b> <b>patients</b> opinion of stigma and the way nurses view stigma. In my opinion, this is an unusual combination of two problems that are widely discussed, yet neither dealt with nor described in any way. At the present time, which is a time of mass media and stress, an individual person could hardly think that he or she does not know certain aspects of life that a certain percentage of the population meets with, and in many a case does not even know about this question. People think and believe that they are prepared for everything, that they are balanced and can deal with all problems. When, however, a problem touches their health, it is often an aspect that they do not even think about very much and consider it as a natural part of their everyday life, they start to be literally helpless and anxious, and this escalates depending on how large an interference in their health it is. If you say the term stomy, a lot of people hesitate and {{have no idea what it}} could be. It is of course no rule but we have to get aware of the thing that a large part of the population deal with this problem. It is therefore important to conduct education and to pay attention to the information of the broad population, while placing emphasis on understanding stomy patients everyday troubles. The term stigma, as I have found out to my surprise, is a completely unknown notion. This is despite the fact that stigma and stigmatising factors may occur in a broader range of diseases than the stomy mentioned. The objective of the thesis is then to shed light on the terms of stigma a colostomy. And to find out the most frequent stigmatising factors in this disease and to find a solution to this problem...|$|R

40|$|Survival in {{patients}} with stage IV unresectable rectosigmoid cancer is significantly reduced, and when patients are seen with symptoms of obstruction, it is advisable to perform a diverting colostomy before acute obstruction occurs. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the results of endoscopic stent placement with diverting proximal <b>colostomy</b> in <b>patients</b> with stage IV rectosigmoid cancer and symptoms of chronic subacute obstruction. In a prospective randomized trial, 22 patients with stage IV unresectable rectosigmoid cancer and symptoms of chronic subacute obstruction were randomized to either endoscopic placement of an expandable stent or diverting proximal <b>colostomy.</b> <b>Patients</b> were followed until death. There was no case of mortality or major postoperative complications. Oral feeding and bowel function were restored within 24 hours after endoscopic stent placement and within 72 hours after diverting colostomy. Hospital stays were shorter (mean, 2. 6 days) {{in patients}} with endoscopic stent placement than in those with diverting stomas (mean, 8. 1 days) (P <. 05). Mean long-term survival was 297 days (range, 125612 days) in patients who had stents and 280 days (range, 135591 days) {{in patients with}} stomas (P = NS). No case of mortality during follow-up was related to the procedures. All patients with stomas found them quite unacceptable. The same feelings were present in family members. None of the patients with stents or their family members found any inconvenience about the procedure. Endoscopic expandable stent placement offers a valid solution in patients with stage IV unresectable cancer and symptoms of chronic subacute obstruction, with shorter hospital stays. The procedure is much better accepted, psychologically and practically, by patients and their family members. © 2012 Elsevier Inc...|$|R

All participants answered to a brief socio-demographic and clinic survey and to a protocol that involved producing a pictorial representation of a healthy and sick person and provide a written answer on these concepts. The results shown that patients resort to a projective identification mechanism and attest to a connection between being healthy and being young, whereas the ‘sick person’ is often represented in rigid postures. Ostomies and related prosthetics were but rarely depicted, which may point towards an unconscious and concealed denial of the body amputation experienced by the participants.

40|$|The Bachelor?s Thesis {{was focused}} on {{co-operation}} of nurses with selected support groups. Four objectives were set. Objective 1 : To find out the nurses? awareness of any support groups. Objective 2 : To {{find out if the}} nurses co-operate with the support groups. Objective 3 : To point out to the nurses? collaboration with the support groups. Objective 4 : the selected support groups representatives? opinion on their co-operation with the nurses. A quantitative and qualitative investigation was chosen for the purpose of data gathering. The quantity examination was done by questioning method using a way of questionnaire, the quality one was carried out by questioning method using a way of non-standardized dialogue. Two hypotheses and 2 research questions were defined. Hypothesis 1 : the nurses are informed about the existence of support groups, it was confirmed. Hypothesis 2 : the nurses co-operate with the support groups, it wasn?t confirmed. Research question 1 : How do the selected support groups? representatives perceive present co-operation with the nurses? Answer: The nurses? collaboration with support groups differs from according to a particular support group. Representatives of Diabetic Union of the Czech Republic, Local Unit Plzeň evaluate their collaboration with nurses to be ideal. The nurses do lecturing for the Union, they conduct special discussions and take part in meetings in which they provide blood pressure, glycaemia, cholesterol measuring with concerned people. Further, the nurses participate in a Dia-Club operating, they act educationally in re-conditional stays offering sick people any contacts to the Diabetic Union, the Dia-Club and hand over any information brochures. The Breast Carcinoma Patient Association?s representatives - MAMMA HELP CENTRE Plzeň state the nurses don?t collaborate with them at all. Representatives of ILCO <b>Colostomy</b> <b>Patients</b> Association Tábor point out to a fact that only one specialised nurse collaborates with them, she provides contacts, lectures in the colostomy club, she ensures and hands over compensating aids and conducts chatting. Research question 2 : What conception do the selected support groups? representatives have as to possibilities of further co-operation with nurses? Answer: The representatives of Diabetic Union of the CR, Local Unit Plzeň wouldn?t change their present co-operation anyhow. The representatives of MAMMA HELP CENTRE Plzeň state the nurses should provide contacts and information about the association; they should show interest in its activity, visit the centre, do lecturing for sick people here and participate in events arranged by the association. The representatives of ILCO <b>colostomy</b> <b>patients</b> Association Tábor state the nurses should provide information about the association with sick people; they should show interest in its activity, participate in arranged events and be engaged more. There is a recommendation for actual setting to create an information leaflet listing of patients? organisations whim them the support groups are effective and this leaflet should be provided with hospital facilities Hospital České Budějovice a. s. and Faculty Hospital Plzeň. Another occasion to make use of gained information might be a seminar arrangement for nurses within life long learning...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY A {{self-rating}} {{measure of}} stigma and several supplementary questions were devised {{in order to}} assess perceived stigma in a community survey of {{the quality of life in}} 420 rectal cancer patients, of whom 265 had a permanent <b>colostomy.</b> Half the <b>patients</b> felt stigmatised, higher proportions being observed among younger patients and among those with a colostomy. Feelings of stigma were associated with poor health, particularly emotional disorders, with the presence of other medical problems, and with disablement. Patients who perceived stigma made more use of medical services but were less satisfied with them, particularly with regard to communication with health professionals. Socio-economic factors, such as employment status, higher income, and higher social and housing class, did not protect patients against feeling stigmatised by cancer or by <b>colostomy.</b> Most <b>patients,</b> with or without stigma, enjoyed close relationships with intimates, but the stigmatised were more likely to have withdrawn from participation in social activities. Assessing stigma by self-rating gives information which adds to that obtained by the usual methods of assessing quality of life. Treatment for rectal cancer involves the majority of patients in radical mutilating surgery, the burden of...|$|R
40|$|Twenty-eight {{consecutive}} extraperitoneal rectal injuries for {{a period}} of 34 months ending in May 1990 were reviewed retrospectively. All injuries were due to penetrating gunshot wounds. The rectal exam was positive in 75 % of patients versus 80. 8 % with proctosigmoidoscopy. All 28 patients had diversion of the fecal stream. Diverting colostomies were performed in 17 <b>patients,</b> Hartmann's <b>colostomies</b> in 7 <b>patients,</b> and proximal loop <b>colostomies</b> in 4 <b>patients.</b> Presacral drainage was used in 25 patients (89. 3 %). Distal irrigation was performed in 13 patients (46. 4 %) and primary repair in 9 patients (32. 1 %). There was one infectious complication (3. 6 %) and no deaths (0 %). Fecal diversion and presacral drainage are the mainstay of therapy for civilian rectal injuries. The importance of distal irrigation of the rectum has not been established. Primary repair of the rectum has no effect on morbidity and mortality...|$|R
40|$|This study {{reviewed}} {{the management of}} colon injuries treated at the trauma surgical service, University of Nevada Medical Center between 1987 and 1992. Sixty-six patients sustained either blunt or penetrating colon injuries during the study period. The patients {{were divided into two}} groups: patients who underwent diverting <b>colostomies</b> and <b>patients</b> who underwent primary repair. Both groups were equally matched in terms of colon injury severity as well as trauma scores. The results indicated that primary colon repair was as safe if not safer than colostomy with less complications and at lower costs. The authors conclude that primary repair should be reevaluated in a critical manner as an evolving standard of care...|$|R

Along with conventional therapies, some abrogated traditional treatment had been used for hemorrhoids like local Kerosene injection especially for extremely irritated external hemorrhoids. We report a rare case of Kerosene self-injection into the hemorrhoid. Despite antibiotics therapy, extent debridement, and <b>colostomy,</b> the <b>patient</b> died after 24 hours because of heart attack. Moreover, we discuss here the case with contact or injection of hydrocarbon materials and early care action to decrease the extensions of injury and side effects. 1...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{present a}} model of {{extended}} home nursing support provided through WeChat for pediatric <b>colostomy</b> <b>patients</b> {{between the first and}} second surgery to support parents and to assist them in nursing possible complications at home, to reduce colostomy complications caused by improper care, to improve the quality of life of patients at home and to ensure the success of the recovery and second surgery. MethodsA combination of relevant clinical information, health care guidelines, and training as well as the establishment of a specific monitoring protocol was provided to the parents during the patient's first hospitalization. A support system for nursing the colostomy was established with regular follow-up via WeChat after the patient's first discharge from the hospital using a predetermined protocol. During the 3 – 6 months of home care in-between the colostomy operations, the charge nurse initiated the phone follow-up and provided specific, individual guidance and feedback. If necessary, extended service at predetermined intervals was provided in the 1 st week, the 1 st month, the 2 nd month and the 3 rd month. ResultsExtended assistance for the home care of <b>patients</b> with pediatric <b>colostomy</b> complications improved the quality of life of the patients and caregivers and was accepted by all parties involved upon introduction. The assistance provided support for the parents at all hours, efficiently reduced the level of complications for this type of patient and facilitated fast referrals to hospital care in cases of emergencies. Furthermore it paved the way to successful second stage surgeries, provided direct feedback to the charge nurse and improved the work satisfaction and sense of achievement of the nurses involved. ConclusionsAll 80 cases supported by WeChat successfully underwent two-stage pediatric colostomy operations. The response of the parents and the medical staff involved was very positive. This method is easy to use, economical to operate and could be applied generally to support home care...|$|R
