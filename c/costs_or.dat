5|$|Flag of {{convenience}} (FOC) {{is a business}} practice whereby a merchant ship is registered in a country other {{than that of the}} ship's owners, and the ship flies that country's civil ensign. Owners of a ship may register the ship under a flag {{of convenience}} to reduce operating <b>costs</b> <b>or</b> avoid the regulations of the owner's country. The closely related term open registry, which describes a ship register that will register foreign-owned ships, also exists.|$|E
5000|$|Inventory - trading these assets is {{a normal}} {{business}} of a company. The inventory value reported on the balance sheet is usually the historical <b>cost</b> <b>or</b> fair market value, whichever is lower.

50|$|The lower of <b>cost</b> <b>or</b> market concept {{first became}} part of normal {{accounting}} practices in England during the nineteenth century. Lower of <b>cost</b> <b>or</b> market was considered fair because assets were valued on a going-concern basis, rather than the price at which the assets were purchased. During the nineteenth century, lower of <b>cost</b> <b>or</b> market was not common practice for valuation of factory inventory in the United States. The concept was not easy for the Academic Accountants to accept due to its lack of logic. Despite the criticism, lower of <b>cost</b> <b>or</b> market quickly caught on in practice and by {{the early twentieth century}} was described as the most commonly accepted method for inventory valuation according to the Report of the Special Committee on Co-operation with Stock Exchanges. Although it lacked accounting logic, lower of <b>cost</b> <b>or</b> market survived because of its conservative approach to valuation and because it addressed opposing principles of cost and value. Its conservatism allowed users to value the inventory at the price for which the inventory could be sold.|$|R

The 2040 Master Plan developed by OCX has a loop route around the south and east sides of the Kissimmee-St.Cloud area. The Poinciana Parkway is a natural part of the proposed loop road.|$|E
5|$|A 2016 study led by Harvard University health {{economics}} professor Benjamin Sommers found that residents of Kentucky and Arkansas, which both accepted the Medicaid expansion, {{were more likely}} to receive health care services and less likely to incur emergency room <b>costs</b> <b>or</b> have trouble paying their medical bills than before the expansion. Residents of Texas, which did not accept the Medicaid expansion, did not see a similar improvement during the same period. Kentucky opted for increased managed care, while Arkansas subsidized private insurance. The new Arkansas and Kentucky governors have proposed reducing or modifying their programs. Between 2013 and 2015, the uninsured rate dropped from 42% to 14% in Arkansas and from 40% to 9% in Kentucky, compared with 39% to 32% in Texas. Specific improvements included additional primary and preventive care, fewer emergency departments visits, reported higher quality care, improved health, improved drug affordability, reduced out-of-pocket spending and increased outpatient visits, increased diabetes screening, glucose testing among diabetes patients and regular care for chronic conditions.|$|E
5|$|Camber Castle {{went through}} several {{changes at the}} start of the 17th century. In 1610, Peter Temple was {{appointed}} as captain of the castle, and between 1610 and 1614 the garrison was reduced to 14 soldiers, including only 4 gunners, either as an effort to reduce <b>costs</b> <b>or</b> as a result of the changing types of artillery kept at the castle. The north and south bastions were filled in to form solid gun platforms around approximately 1613 and 1615, and an earth rampart called the Rampire was built up against the south corner of the castle. These solid bastions would have sacrificed living space, less in demand with a smaller garrison, but been much cheaper to maintain. Longbows fell out of use in warfare as archery in England declined, and were replaced by arquebuses and muskets, 46 of which were kept at the castle in 1614.|$|E

5|$|Its {{by-product}} status {{means that}} indium production is {{constrained by the}} amount of sulfidic zinc (and copper) ores extracted each year. Therefore, its availability needs to be discussed in terms of supply potential. The supply potential of a by-product is defined as that amount which is economically extractable from its host materials per year under current market conditions (i.e. technology and price). Reserves and resources are not relevant for by-products, since they cannot be extracted independently from the main-products. Recent estimates put the supply potential of indium at a minimum of 1,300 t/yr from sulfidic zinc ores and 20 t/yr from sulfidic copper ores. These figures are significantly greater than current production (655 t in 2016). Thus, major future increases in the by-product production of indium will be possible without significant increases in production <b>costs</b> <b>or</b> price. The average indium price in 2016 was $US240/kg, down from $US705/kg in 2014.|$|E
5|$|In 1958, American International Pictures founders James H. Nicholson and Samuel Z. Arkoff hired European talent agent Flavio Lucisano to {{look for}} Italian {{commercial}} films for them after the large success of the Italian feature Hercules (1958). In February 1963, American International Pictures {{made a deal with}} the Italian film production company Galatea that they would contribute to a minimum of nine co-productions in the next eight years. Black Sabbath follows many production trends of Italian films of the era. These co-productions were influenced by the lack of large film stars in Italy. To avoid high <b>costs</b> <b>or</b> larger stars, producers created anthology films involving three or four short narratives whose combined running time was that of a regular feature film, as in Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow (1963). A second trend was to match an up-and-coming actor or a much older actor with a European ingenue actress, as in Spy in Your Eye which paired Pier Angeli and Dana Andrews. The third trend was the move towards making Westerns and horror films which were less expensive to produce than the previous sword and sandal films.|$|E

25|$|The Armstrong School District {{offers a}} wide variety of clubs, {{activities}} and an extensive junior high and high school sports program. In 2013, Armstrong School District spent over $1.5 million for activities (not including facilities <b>costs</b> <b>or</b> transportation). In 2014, Armstrong School District spent over $1.8 million for activities (not including facilities <b>costs</b> <b>or</b> transportation). The total revenue received by the district from all activities was only $107,500 in 2013. The district is especially challenged because it operates multiple high schools there by duplicating sports teams and the associated costs like coaches salaries, officials salaries, transportation, facilities and their maintenance, administration, uniforms and so on. Armstrong School Board determines eligibility policies to participate in these programs. When the planned high school and junior high school consolidation occurs in 2014-15, some duplicate teams will be eliminated.|$|E
