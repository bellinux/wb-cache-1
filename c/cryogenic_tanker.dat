40|$|This paper {{presented}} a methodology {{for the design}} of heat insulations used in <b>cryogenic</b> <b>tankers.</b> This insulation usually comprises a combination of vacuum and perlite or vacuum and superinsulation. Concretely, it is a methodology to obtain the temperatures, heat fluxes, and so forth. Using analytical tools has been established, which is based on the equivalence with an electric circuit, and on numerical tools using finite elements. Results obtained with both methods are then compared. In addition, the influence of the outer finish of the external part, due to the effect of the solar radiation, is analyzed too, and the equations to determine the maximum time available to transport the cryogenic liquid have been established. All these aspects are applied to a specific cryogenic commercial vehicle...|$|R

An increase of about 30 % in payload performance can be expected from upgrading the present Shuttle system through weight and drag reductions and improvements in the propellants and engines. The ODINEX (Optimal Design Integration Executive Computer Program) program {{has been used to}} explore design options. An advanced technology SSTO baseline system derived from ODINEX analysis has a conventional wing-body configuration using LOX/LH engines, three with two-position nozzles with expansion ratios of 40 and 200 and four with fixed nozzles with an expansion ratio of 40. Two assisted-takeoff approaches are under consideration in addition to a concept in which the orbital vehicle takes off empty using airbreathing propulsion and carries out a rendezvous with two large <b>cryogenic</b> <b>tankers</b> carrying propellant at an altitude of 6100 m.

The high-pressure gas pipeline has excessive surface area when carrying hydrogen and excessive fluid density when carrying natural gas, while the <b>cryogenic</b> ocean <b>tanker</b> runs in a dense medium and makes gravity waves.

40|$|We outline a {{strategy}} for future experiments on neutrino and astroparticle physics based on the use, at different detector mass scales (100 ton and 100 kton), of the liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LAr TPC) technique. The LAr TPC technology has great potentials for both cases with large degree of interplay between the two applications and a strong synergy. The ICARUS R&D programme has demonstrated that the technology is mature and that one can built a large (∼ 1 kton) LAr TPC. We believe that one can conceive and design a very large mass LAr TPC with a mass of 100 kton by employing a monolithic technology based {{on the use of}} industrial, large volume <b>cryogenic</b> <b>tankers</b> developed by the petro-chemical industry. We show a potential implementation of a large LAr TPC detector. Such a detector would be an ideal match for a Superbeam, Betabeam or Neutrino Factory, covering a broad physics program that could include the detection of atmospheric, solar and supernova neutrinos, and search for proton decays, in addition to the rich accelerator neutrino physics program. In parallel, physics is calling for another application of the LAr TPC technique at the level of 100 ton mass, for low energy neutrino physics and for use as a near station setup in future long baseline neutrino facilities. We present here the main physics objectives and outline the conceptual design of such a detector. 1. The liquid Argon TPC technique Among the many ideas developed around th...|$|R

40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{possibility}} of new generation neutrino and astroparticle physics experiments exploiting the liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LAr TPC) technique, following a graded strategy that envisions applications with increasing detector masses (from 100 ton to 100 kton). The ICARUS R&D program has already demonstrated that the technology is mature with the test of the T 600 detector at surface. Since 2003 {{we have been working}} with the conceptual design of a very large LAr TPC with a mass of 50 - 100 kton to be built by employing a monolithic technology based on the use of industrial, large volume, <b>cryogenic</b> <b>tankers</b> developed by the petro-chemical industry. Such a detector, if realized, would be an ideal match for a Super Beam, Beta Beam or Neutrino Factory, covering a broad physics program that includes the detection of atmospheric, solar and supernova neutrinos, and searches for proton decay, in addition to the rich accelerator neutrino physics program. A ”test module ” with a mass of the order of 10 kton operated underground or at shallow depth would represent a necessary milestone towards the realization of the 100 kton detector, with an interesting physics program on its own. In parallel, physics is calling for a shorter scale application of the LAr TPC technique at the level of 100 ton mass, for low energy neutrino physics and for use as a near station setup in future long baseline neutrino facilities. We outline here the main physics objectives and the design of such a detector for operation in the upcoming T 2 K neutrino beam. We finally present the result of a series of R&D studies conducted with the aim of validating the design of the proposed detectors. 1...|$|R

40|$|LNG is the {{abbreviation}} for liquefied natural gas, which {{is recognized as}} one of the world’s clean energies. LNG is one product at natural gas that through purification and ultra-low temperature is liquefied. The liquefied natural gas is very suitable for LNG transportation by a truck. China is a big country rich in natural resources. The use of natural gas is in favor of Chinese energy structure adjustment. It has important strategic significance to improve the ecological environment and the quality of people’s lives. A LNG carrier vehicle is a <b>cryogenic</b> liquid <b>tanker</b> truck used to transport liquefied natural gas in an ultra-low temperature environment. Because LNG is flammable, explosive, and cryogenic and so on, it is very important the safety design of LNG carrier vehicle demanded in the road transport safety. LNG carrier vehicles usually consist of LNG cryogenic liquid storage tanks, trailer running gears, piping systems, a control box and other components. Among them prone to accidents are mainly LNG cryogenic liquid storage tanks and safety accessories. This paper dealt with the safety design research to these two systems. The main tasks included the following...|$|R
40|$|The risk of {{terrorist}} attack on large <b>cryogenic</b> hydrocarbon fuel <b>tankers</b> is unclear, due partly to difficulties in understanding how the spill, pool vaporization, turbulent dispersion and fuel-vapor mixing are coupled. The current study’s objective is to model the vaporization, dispersion, and deflagration of liquid methane pools boiling on water while subjected to airflow around a prismatic body. The Fire Dynamics Simulator CFD code developed by NIST facilitates large-eddy simulations of the turbulent dispersion that is coupled to a combustion model capturing premixed flame ignition, propagation, and if sustainable, transition to diffusion pool fire. The pool and water are characterized as isothermal surfaces with a dominant convection heat transfer mode. Flammable mass, cloud visualization, flame height, temperature, and heat flux provide diagnostics. Slower winds produce larger flammable clouds, but insufficient mixing inhibits successful ignition. Provisional adjustment of the flammability limits demonstrates reasonable flame height and diffusion flame heat releas...|$|R
