The extensive occupation is chronologically classified as the Baumer phase (a local variation of the Crab Orchard culture). The Baumer phase occupants of Kincaid used no Havana Hopewell culture motifs when decorating their pottery as did other Crab Orchard peoples but used cord and fabirc marking. They also preferred more limestone and grog tempering in their <b>clay</b> <b>paste.</b> [...] Excavations prior to the construction of an informational kiosk and viewing platform in 2003 revealed six Baumer phase pit features dating to 250 BCE to 1 CE.

50|$|Raiba {{lived in}} a 100 square feet {{tenement}} with his mother, {{his wife and three}} children. This space served too as the studio. Canvas in those was not easy to come by and was usually imported. During his time in Kashmir stretched cloth on a board served as his canvas. Jute when stretched tight is extremely taught, but the fibres from the strains of jute often shed. Being from a plant that grows in standing water, with humid conditions, the fibre resists decay by humidity and is apt for tropical temperatures. It is readily available and cheap. Using jute for its availability and cost, Raiba soon devised a method of priming the stretched jute, using techniques learnt during his training to be a muralist at school. He would prepare the surface of his jute canvas by creating a white sticky solution of white <b>clay</b> <b>paste,</b> fevicol (gum adhesive), water and ground bricks. The gum adhesive would act as the binder and bring in the colour. The prepared canvas had a taught smooth surface that was dull white in colour. The process is time consuming as the jute strings absorb the solution easily but the pores between them take time to fill. It takes 15 layers of application before the stretched jute {{can be used as a}} canvas. Raiba, is distinct in his use of jute, he changes the surface of the material to resemble a canvas and does not use it in its natural form. While painting there is a deep absorption of the paint into the surface, leaving a rough texture on the surface, altering the shades of the paint. Even after years of having been painted these canvases do not develop cracks or have any fungal damage in comparison to the common canvas. The placement of subjects within his paintings borrow from the murals, narrating multiple stories, histories through intricate images that often go unnoticed but remain essential.|$|E

The state and location of water are described in each domain. An equation that gives the thickness t of the film of water adsorbed on the walls of pores versus the activity of water is developed. This t-curve is used to get, from the desorption isotherm, the pore size distribution curve of the studied hydrated materials. Then concepts of surface and fabric of <b>clay</b> <b>pastes</b> are discussed as a function of hydration and a mechanism is proposed to explain swelling and shrinkage of finely divided materials. Three kinds of surfaces, related to the aggregate fabric, are defined as a function of their capacity to adsorb water. Each kind of surface is determined by a specific technique: the total surface area (St) by ethylene glycol adsorption, the external surface area of particles (S~) by nitrogen adsorption and the external surface area of aggregates (Se) by hydraulic onductivity measurements. A a consequence it is only with completely dispersed clays that swelling is a function of St. With unwell-dispersed clays, water adsorption, which induces welling, successively occurs on St, S s and Se surfaces...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} the domestic pottery production related to the Chalcolithic settlements of Tor Pagnotta, Casetta Mistici, Osteria del Curato-Via Cinquefrondi, Torre della Chiesaccia and Valle dei Morti. All of the analysed contexts are located South of Rome and are chronologically dated between the half of the IV {{and the end of}} the III millennium B. C. The settlements analysed in this research play a major role in the understanding of the occupation of this area, such densely populated during the prehistoric period and geographically limited between the Tiber river, the Aniene river and the Colli Albani volcano. This study aims to reconstruct the technological and functional choices involved in the pottery production in order to define and highlight patterns of continuity or discontinuity, which are useful to investigate the occupation dynamics of the area. The localization of the settlements (very near one to each other) allows to develop the research both over a synchronic and a diachronic perspective, identifying differences and similarities between contemporary productions and in a diachronic perspective, underlying transformations happening over time within different cultural traditions. This research falls into a moment where studies focused on the function of prehistoric productions are mostly related to tools made of other types of materials (e. g flint, hard animal materials etc) than pottery, which has rarely been taken in consideration from this point of view. So far, the few use wear analyses performed on pottery, focused on the reconstruction of the vessels’ use, not taking into consideration its technology, intended as production techniques, not allowing the development of a universal terminology or a specific methodological approach. For these reasons this research proposes a methodological framework comprising an integrated approach of wear analysis and experimentation, which allowed to produce relevant data on this matter. The methodology here presented allows a detailed examination of a pottery production based upon the decomposition of the vessel. Starting with the compositional analysis of <b>clay</b> <b>pastes</b> (petrographic analysis on thin sections, XRF) it was possible to reconstruct the sourcing strategies, locate the clay sources exploited in the area and define clay recipes. Furthermore, a detailed analysis of the vessel construction and pottery firing techniques was performed. A major role in this research is played by the analysis of the samples under a microscope, applying a low power approach, and by a dedicated experimental framework that allowed to study and define the modeling techniques, surface treatments, decorations techniques, along with the exploited tools, in order to reconstruct the involved gestures, which are only hypothesised trough the study of traditional contexts. Trough this approach it is possible to take the whole aspects of a pottery production such as the choices that distinguish individual traditions and the manufacturing features allowing to define the figure of “the potter” or his role in a prehistoric community highlighting possible forms of craft specialization. Moreover, from the application of this methodology it emerged that it is not possible separate the study of technological choices from the use, as every vessel is produced to be used. For this reason technological features, as modeling and surface treatments and the choice of <b>clay</b> <b>pastes</b> are studied in relation to the functional requirements, with an integrate approach involving microscope observations, residue analysis and experimentation, focused on the definition of the actual use of a pottery vessel...|$|R

Three episodes of children’s activities of <b>pasting</b> <b>clay</b> to their body are picked up from participant observation in nursery school. The analysis from the phenomenological viewpoint shows three aspects. First, by <b>pasting</b> <b>clay</b> to some part of his body, the child feels his body boundary clearly and that part special.

To understand the phenomena involved, a numerical model of the pressing step was developed. Different tests were performed to determine the different behaviour laws necessary to the numerical simulation (rheological, tribological, damage). A rheological study, based on free compression tests, allowed to charaterize the elasto-visco-plastic behaviour of the extruded <b>clay</b> <b>paste.</b> The constitutive parameters were estimated by inverse analysis of the experimental force displacement curves using a Strategic evolution algorithm coupled with a metamodel. Two damage models, the Latham and Crockoft criterion and the Oyane criterion, were compared to model the cracking. To simulate the crack's propagation, an element deletion algorithm was used. The friction models of Coulomb and Tresca were investigated to model the global friction between the clay and the tools.

The purpose of this research is to understand and modify the clay properties in earth material to propose an innovative strategy to develop a castable earth-based material. To do so, we focused on the modification of clay properties at fresh state with inorganic additives. As the rheological behaviour of clays is controlled by their surface charge, the addition of phosphate anion allows discussing deep the rheology of concentrated clay suspensions. We highlighted the thixotropic and shear thickening behaviour of a dispersed kaolinite clay suspensions. Indeed, by adding sodium hexametaphosphate the workability of <b>clay</b> <b>paste</b> increases and the behaviour is stable during time after a certain shear is applied. Moreover, we stress that the aging and the shift in critical strain in clay system are due to the re-arrangement of clay suspension and a decrease of deformation during time.

40|$|We {{review and}} re-examine the {{development}} of the hydrostatics of swelling soils, starting with the pioneering work of John R. Philip. His early attempts to formulate the overburden potential of the soil water as an additional component to the pressure and gravitational potentials did cause some confusion, until it became clear that there is no additional component and that the actual pressure potential can be split into two parts: the (non-actual) pressure potential the soil water would have if the system were unloaded, and a remaining part, which may be called the overburden potential. Using fundamental thermodynamics it is then shown how the overburden potential can be calculated from the slopes of the bundle of load-pressure-dependent shrinkage curves. A set of experimental data published by Talsma is used to test the Groenevelt-Bolt equation of state for the bundle of shrinkage curves and for the numerical values of the overburden potentials for Talsma's <b>clay</b> <b>paste.</b> Subsequently, the Groenevelt-Bolt equation is used to interpret the physical significance of the extremes of residual shrinkage curves, for which shrinkage data from the literature are used.

40|$|EN] This paper {{describes}} the research run on ceramic materials, {{and more specifically}} fired clay roof tiles, ground to a fineness suitable for use as an active replacement for portland cements (PCs). The utilization of waste products from calcined clay roof tiles as a pozzolanic material in the cement manufacture is studied. One of the first materials used as pozzolans in the history was thermal-treated clay, a material similar to the calcined clay precast elements. For this study, the materials selected are clay products that have been eliminated for different reasons: a wrong temperature inside the kiln, dimensional and mechanical failures, and durability loss. The results showed that these products have good pozzolanic properties; at an early age, the pozzolanic activity {{was found to be}} higher than fly ash, although it was lower than silica fume.
