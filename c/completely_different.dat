5|$|The {{surnames}} Stewart and Stuart denote {{essentially the}} same occupation but have a <b>completely</b> <b>different</b> word derivation. They originate from the pre-7th-century English words stigweard—a compound of stig meaning household—and weard, a guardian.|$|E
5|$|I had to {{therefore}} {{come up with}} my {{own decisions}} about what this meant and what this character was going through, what was dream and what was reality. My interpretation could end up being <b>completely</b> <b>different,</b> from both David and the audience. But I did have to reconcile all of that, and people seem to think it works.|$|E

5|$|Indonesia {{was a part}} of {{the largest}} punk {{movement}} in Southeast Asia, heavily influenced by Green Day, Rancid, and the Offspring. Young people created their own underground sub-culture of punk, which over time developed into a style that was <b>completely</b> <b>different</b> to the original movement.|$|E
5|$|Many Lingbao {{beliefs are}} {{borrowed}} from Buddhism. The {{names of the}} many different deities and heavens were often given titles based on phonetic transcriptions of Sanskrit. Many Sanskrit terms were borrowed phonetically, but given <b>completely</b> <b>different</b> meanings. One significant concept borrowed from Buddhism was that of reincarnation.|$|E
5|$|Opposable thumbs {{allowing}} the grasping of objects {{are most often}} associated with primates, like humans, monkeys, apes, and lemurs. Opposable thumbs also evolved in pandas, but these are <b>completely</b> <b>different</b> in structure, having six fingers including the thumb, which develops from a wrist bone entirely separately from other fingers.|$|E

40|$|We report {{here the}} draft genome {{sequence}} of Pseudomonas azelaica strain Aramco J (7. 3 Mbp; GC content, 61. 9 %), {{one of the}} few bacteria that can <b>completely</b> mineralize <b>different</b> hydroxybiphenyls, e. g., 2 -hydroxybiphenyl, 2, 2 =-dihydroxybiphenyl, and 3 -hydroxybiphenyl. The findings obtained from its genome annotation suggest that this strain becomes a useful biocatalyst for aromatic bioconversions...|$|R
25|$|The {{main source}} of {{information}} about Kharavela is his rock-cut Hathigumpha inscription. The inscription is undated, and only 4 of its 17 lines are <b>completely</b> legible. <b>Different</b> scholars have interpreted it differently, leading to a number of speculations about Kharavela's reign. The inscription credits the king with several welfare activities, patronage of arts, repair works and military victories. Although it exaggerates his achievements, historians agree that Kharavela was one of the strongest rulers of Kalinga.|$|R
5|$|The game {{features}} more characters {{than just the}} original trio. Other characters such as Jane Maxwell, McDullen Harts (called Magdalene Harts in the remake), Emma Hetfield, Mariel, and Zed {{will be able to}} join and the player may switch them into the battlefield. All of the dungeons have <b>completely</b> <b>different</b> puzzles and layouts.|$|E
5|$|The {{morphological}} {{characteristics of}} caterpillars and pupae used for classification are <b>completely</b> <b>different</b> {{from that of}} adults; different classification schemes are sometimes provided separately for classifying adults, larvae and pupae. The characteristics of immature stages are increasingly used for taxonomic purposes as they provide insights into systematics and phylogenies of Lepidoptera that are not apparent from examination of adults.|$|E
5|$|Two {{evolutionarily}} independent enzyme superfamilies {{with different}} protein folds {{are known to}} use the N-terminal residue as a nucleophile: Superfamily PB (proteasomes using the Ntn fold) and Superfamily PE (acetyltransferases using the DOM fold) This commonality of active site structure in <b>completely</b> <b>different</b> protein folds indicates that the active site evolved convergently in those superfamilies.|$|E
50|$|The magician {{presents}} {{a book and}} riffles through it, showing a number of images in black and white. The book is then closed and a flourish is performed, normally involving audience participation, originally having an audience member blow {{on the outside of}} the book. The magician picks up the book and riffles it again, revealing that the images are now colored, or have changed <b>completely</b> into <b>different</b> images depending on the nature of the book.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, the {{potential}} of orthogonal frequencydivision multiplexing-code-division multiplexing (OFDM-CDM) combined with the pre-equalization is investigated. The codedivision multiplexing (CDM) component within an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) system enables additional diversity in frequency- and time-selective mobile radio channels. While, by applying pre-equalization at the OFDMCDM transmitter the task of equalization at the receiver can be <b>completely</b> avoided. <b>Different</b> pre-equalization techniques are investigated, and it is shown that pre-equalized OFDM-CDM systems can achieve promising performance in fading channels.

5|$|A 2003 {{attempt by}} Christopher Brochu {{included}} Albertosaurus, Alectrosaurus, Alioramus, Daspletosaurus, Gorgosaurus, Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus in the definition. Holtz redefined the clade in 2004 {{to use all}} of the above as specifiers except for Alioramus and Alectrosaurus, which his analysis could not place with certainty. However, in the same paper, Holtz also provided a <b>completely</b> <b>different</b> definition, including all theropods more closely related to Tyrannosaurus than to Eotyrannus. The most recent definition is that of Sereno in 2005, which defined Tyrannosauridae as the least inclusive clade containing Albertosaurus, Gorgosaurus and Tyrannosaurus.|$|E
5|$|A team at Naughty Dog {{designed}} the character appearances, and creative director Neil Druckmann {{was the main}} writer of their personalities and mannerisms. The actors were given considerable license to improvise the lines and influence character personality, simultaneously performing the motion capture work for their characters. Various characters were influenced by the story progression, ultimately becoming <b>completely</b> <b>different</b> from the initial vision. The relationship of the characters received praise from several gaming publications, and the acting has resulted in multiple awards, including two BAFTAs and a DICE Award.|$|E
5|$|Although the game's story diverges {{in several}} places and {{features}} a <b>completely</b> <b>different</b> protagonist, several levels mirror passages from Lovecraft's novella The Shadow over Innsmouth. It also contains elements of the Call of Cthulhu role-playing game's campaign Escape from Innsmouth, such as the Marsh Refinery raid. A major sub-plot {{of the game is}} inspired by Lovecraft's novella The Shadow Out of Time.|$|E
50|$|Throughout the Prism period, DEC was {{involved}} in a major debate over the future direction of the company. As newer workstations were introduced, the performance benefit of the VAX was constantly eroded, and the price/performance ratio <b>completely</b> undermined. <b>Different</b> groups within the company debated how to best respond. Some advocated moving the VAX into the high-end, abandoning the low-end to the workstations. Others suggested moving into the workstation market using a commodity processor. Still others suggested re-implementing the VAX on a RISC processor.|$|R
50|$|Ogoveidae are 3 to 5 mm {{long and}} eyeless. They are <b>completely</b> covered with <b>different</b> types of sensory hairs and sonsory {{structure}}s. Both sexes feature a cuticular structure on the legs, coxae, and opisthosomal sternal region, called Hansen's organ. The pedipalps are extremely modified.|$|R
50|$|The syntax of the SQL {{programming}} language is defined and maintained by ISO/IEC SC 32 {{as part of}} ISO/IEC 9075. This standard is not freely available.

5|$|As his hunger became intolerable, Periyar {{was forced}} to feed on {{leftovers}} from the streets. Around this time, he realised that the eatery which had refused him entry was built by a wealthy non-Brahmin from South India. This discriminatory attitude dealt a blow to Periyar's regard for Hinduism, for the events he had witnessed at Kasi were <b>completely</b> <b>different</b> from the picture of Kasi he had in mind, as a holy place which welcomed all. Ramasami was a theist until his visit to Kasi, after which his views changed and he became an atheist.|$|E
5|$|Cross-fertilization between {{board games}} {{and video games}} continued. For example, some aspects of Master of Orion III were drawn from {{the first edition of}} the board game Twilight Imperium. Even Sins of a Solar Empire was {{inspired}} by the idea of adapting the board game Buck Rogers Battle for the 25th Century into a real-time video game. Going in the opposite direction, Eagle Games made a board game adaptation of Sid Meier's Civilization in 2002, <b>completely</b> <b>different</b> from the board game that had inspired the computer game in the first place.|$|E
5|$|Further work on {{the model}} has shown that a slight {{difference}} in assumptions can produce <b>completely</b> <b>different</b> results. For example, Eaton and Grossmann showed that if the firms compete in prices rather in quantities (Bertrand competition rather than Cournot) then the optimal policy is an export tax rather a subsidy – a policy rarely used in practice, politically unpopular and contrary to protectionist sentiment which generally touted New Trade Theory models as an argument for their favored policies.|$|E
5000|$|Among Jews, [...] "Ya'akov" [...] and [...] "Akiva" [...] - though {{essentially}} {{variants of}} the same name - are treated as <b>completely</b> separate, arousing <b>different</b> historical and religious associations: the one recalls the Biblical Patriarch Jacob, the other relates to the Roman period Rabbi Akiva.|$|R
30|$|Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), as a {{research}} topic, are currently a subject of intensive investigation. They are being used in {{a broad spectrum of}} applications, (i.e. tracking patients at hospitals, gathering data from a hostile environment, controlling electronic equipment at households and many others) and are considered as one of the enabling technologies of the Future Internet. However, the diversity of possible applications creates numerous problems when defining a standard for WSNs, as the requirements may <b>completely</b> be <b>different</b> depending on the network purpose.|$|R

5|$|Hume criticised {{the view}} that we cannot speak about God, and {{proposed}} that this view {{is no different from}} the skeptical view that God cannot be spoken about. He was unconvinced by Aquinas' theory of analogy and argued that God's attributes must be <b>completely</b> <b>different</b> from human attributes, making comparisons between the two impossible. Hume's scepticism influenced the logical positivist movement of the twentieth century.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, several theorists {{generalized}} Montonen–Olive duality to the S-duality relationship, which connects different string theories. Ashoke Sen studied S-duality in {{the context}} of heterotic strings in four dimensions. Chris Hull and Paul Townsend showed that type IIB string theory with a large coupling constant is equivalent via S-duality to the same theory with small coupling constant. Theorists also found that different string theories may be related by T-duality. This duality implies that strings propagating on <b>completely</b> <b>different</b> spacetime geometries may be physically equivalent.|$|E
5|$|Karlheinz Stockhausen {{was heavily}} {{inspired}} by Satprem's writings about Sri Aurobindo during {{a week in}} May 1968, a time at which the composer was undergoing a personal crisis and had found Sri Aurobindo's philosophies were relevant to his feelings. After this experience, Stockhausen's music took a <b>completely</b> <b>different</b> turn, focusing on mysticism, that was to continue {{until the end of}} his career.|$|E
5000|$|In 2008, {{the band}} {{released}} the EP Take No Thought of the Morrow. A Tunelab review {{said it was}} [...] "a <b>completely</b> new and <b>different</b> sound for Souls Harbor, and one that works out victoriously six different times." [...] The album was produced by Eric Bass and Corey Lowery.|$|R
40|$|In a quite {{simplified}} model, when {{nominal wages}} are <b>completely</b> predetermined, <b>different</b> macroeconomic shocks produce oscillations in output and inflation {{that can be}} stable or explosive. If they are stable, in many cases a peculiar dynamics, perhaps complex, appears, where output and inflation show cycles of multiple order. Even in those cases the cycles show well defined patterns. The model of this work suggests that in more real contexts marginal changes in certain rules of price adjustment could generate hyper sensibility of macroeconomic variables to some parameters, as well as dynamic instability. ...|$|R
50|$|Harlequin {{takes place}} across {{multiple}} eight-way scrolling levels, {{each one of}} which is <b>completely</b> unique, featuring <b>different</b> scenery and enemies. Your character, a harlequin, has returned to his homeworld, Chimerica, to mend its broken heart. To do this, he must find the four pieces that the heart has broken into and take them to the central clock tower.|$|R
