In this paper, {{we present}} {{the design and}} first results of the Dynamic Linked Data Observatory: a {{long-term}} experiment to monitor the two-hop neighbourhood of a core set of eighty thousand diverse Linked Data documents on a weekly basis. We present the methodology used for sampling the URIs to monitor, retrieving the documents, and further crawling part of the two-hop neighbourhood. Having now run this experiment for six months, we analyse {{the dynamics of the}} monitored documents over the data collected thus far. We look at the estimated lifespan of the <b>core</b> <b>documents,</b> how often they go on-line or offline, how often they change; we further investigate domain-level trends. Next we look at changes within the RDF content of the <b>core</b> <b>documents</b> across the weekly snapshots, examining the elements (i. e., triples, subjects, predicates, objects, classes) that are most frequently added or removed. Thereafter, we look at how the links between dereferenceable documents evolves over time in the two-hop neighbourhood. ...|$|R
40|$|Based on a dataset on Astronomy & Astrophysics {{a hybrid}} cluster {{analysis}} has been conducted. Hybrid clustering {{was based on}} a combination of bibliographic coupling and textual similarities using Louvain method at two resolution levels.

For labelling and interpreting clusters, <b>core</b> <b>documents</b> are used. The results of these two scenarios are presented, discussed and compared with each other.

40|$|In {{this study}} a novel method of science mapping is {{presented}} which combines bibliographic coupling, {{as a measure}} of document-document similarity, with an agglomerative hierarchical cluster method. The focus in this study is on the mapping of so called ‘core documents’, a concept presented first in 1995 by Glänzel and Czerwon. The term ‘core document’ denote documents that have a central position in the research front in terms of many and strong bibliographic coupling links. The identification and mapping of <b>core</b> <b>documents</b> usually requires a large multidisciplinary research setting and in this study the 2003 volume of the Science Citation Index was applied. From this database, a sub-set of <b>core</b> <b>documents</b> reporting on the outbreak of SARS in 2002 was chosen for the demonstration of the application of this mapping method. It was demonstrated that the method, in this case, successfully identified interpretable research themes and that iterative clustering on two subsequent levels of cluster agglomeration may provide with useful and current information...|$|R

5000|$|The {{documentary}} hypothesis (DH) is one {{of three}} models used to explain the origins and composition of the first five books of the Bible, called collectively the Torah or Pentateuch, the other two being the supplementary hypothesis and the fragmentary hypothesis. All three agree that the Torah is not a unified work from a single author (traditionally Moses) but is made up of sources combined over many centuries by many hands. They differ on the nature of these sources and how they were combined. According to the documentary hypothesis there were four sources, each originally a separate and independent book (a [...] "document"), joined together at various points in time by a series of editors ("redactors"). Fragmentary hypotheses see the Torah as a collection of small fragments, and supplementary hypotheses as a single <b>core</b> <b>document</b> supplemented by fragments taken from many sources.|$|E

40|$|Given the {{challenging}} environmental {{issues in the}} energy sector, the importance of strategic research and development (R&D) planning has been emphasized to manage a turbulent business situation. This study aims to propose a methodology for exploring promising research frontiers in the energy sector.

Second, the research frontiers are extracted by clustering the <b>core</b> <b>documents</b> based on the bibliographic relations. Third, a knowledge map is generated by mapping the relations between research frontiers. Finally, the promising research frontiers (RFs) are identified by conducting dynamic analyses and the contents of promising RFs are suggested. As an illustration of the method, the field of solar cell technology is chosen and analyzed As a result, the promising research frontiers from the patent knowledge map are related to development (D) themes and promising research frontiers from scientific paper knowledge map {{are related to the}} research (R) themes. The proposed method and results can be utilized by researchers, R&D policy makers, and administrations in practice...|$|R
5000|$|This {{has been}} called [...] "one of the best-known {{sentences}} in the English language", containing [...] "the most potent and consequential words in American history". The passage came to represent a moral standard to which the United States should strive. This view was notably promoted by Abraham Lincoln, who based his philosophy on it, and argued for the Declaration as a statement of principles through which the United States Constitution should be interpreted. [...] Intended also as a revolutionary document for the world, not just the colonies, the Declaration of Independence was Jefferson's assertion of his core beliefs in a republican form of government. The Declaration became the <b>core</b> <b>document</b> and a tradition in American political values. It also became the model of democracy that was adopted by many peoples around the world. Abraham Lincoln once referred to Jefferson's principles as [...] "..the definitions and axioms of a free society..".|$|E
50|$|These {{documentary}} approaches were {{in competition}} with two other models, the fragmentary and the supplementary. The fragmentary hypothesis argued that fragments of varying lengths, rather than continuous documents, lay behind the Torah; this approach accounted for the Torah's diversity but could not account for its structural consistency, particularly regarding chronology. The supplementary hypothesis was better able to explain this unity: it maintained that the Torah {{was made up of}} a central <b>core</b> <b>document,</b> the Elohist, supplemented by fragments taken from many sources. The supplementary approach was dominant by the early 1860s, but it was challenged by an important book published by Hermann Hupfeld in 1853, who argued that the Pentateuch was made up of four documentary sources, the Priestly, Yahwist, and Elohist intertwined in Genesis-Exodus-Leviticus-Numbers, and the stand-alone source of Deuteronomy. At around the same period Karl Heinrich Graf argued that the Yahwist and Elohist were the earliest sources and the Priestly source the latest, while Wilhelm Vatke linked the four to an evolutionary framework, the Yahwist and Elohist to a time of primitive nature and fertility cults, the Deuteronomist to the ethical religion of the Hebrew prophets, and the Priestly source to a form of religion dominated by ritual, sacrifice and law.|$|E

By 1773, a new church constitution had replaced the church's earlier <b>core</b> <b>document,</b> and eventually, the 1672 structure was also replaced by a bigger building, the current Zion Church on North Gay Street, erected from 1807 to 1808 in a Gothic style. [...] An additional expansion of the church to the west along East Lexington Street to North Holliday Street composed of an [...] "Adlersaal" [...] (Parish House), bell tower, parsonage and an enclosed garden designed of Hanseatic North German architecture was constructed under Rev. Julius K. Hoffman in 1912-1913. In the late 1920s, the entire block south of the church was razed to form a monumental square (known as War Memorial Plaza or, less frequently, as [...] "City Hall Plaza") opposite the Baltimore City Hall of 1875 on the western side and construction at the eastern end of the War Memorial Building with an auditorium, historical exhibit area and veterans organizations offices.
