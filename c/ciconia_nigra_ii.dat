WNR has had 240 species of birds from 46 families and 17 orders recorded from its waters. Among those 240 species are 5 first class protected species and 29 second class protected species, according to Chinese Wildlife Conservation Legislation.

40|$|The Iberian Peninsula {{is one of}} the {{few places}} where Black Stork <b>Ciconia</b> <b>nigra</b> winter in Europe. The Black Stork {{wintering}} period in the Iberian Peninsula lasts from mid-November, when the post-fledging migration has finished, until mid-January, when the Black Stork begins the breeding season in some sites of the Peninsula. The number of concentration places and the number of individuals have increased since the nineties. The origin of these individuals is varied. There are individuals from Iberia (Portugal and Spain), but there are also individuals from others countries of Europe...|$|R

Additionally there are large clusters of inland sand dunes. There are extensive areas of peat bogs formed as a result of the overgrowing of the shallower lakes. A number of species of birds live in the area such as the black stork (<b>Ciconia</b> <b>nigra),</b> black grouse (Tetrao tetrix), wood grouse (Tetrao urogallus) and peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus).|$|R
40|$|International audienceSixteen Black Storks (<b>Ciconia</b> <b>nigra)</b> were {{tracked by}} {{satellite}} during their autumnal and spring migrations {{in order to}} identify their major stopover sites and connections between stopovers in Europe and Africa. Among journeys with stopovers, the longest distance that a stork travelled without stopover was 2433 km (defined here as 'accessible distance') meaning that those storks which have stopovers use only a single stopover on average, and this is usually in Spain. We identified nine crucial stopovers (seven in Spain and two in Africa) with high connectivity highlighting the importance of Spanish stopover locations on the flyway of Black Storks...|$|R
50|$|The Vessertal-Thüringen Forest is a {{biosphere}} reserve {{located in the}} Thuringian forest and is crossed by the famous German hiking trail ‘Rennsteig’. The {{biosphere reserve}} is part of Thuringian Forest Nature Park and comprises mainly large contiguous mountain spruce forests. Furthermore, beech forests, block and rock forest communities, high-elevation raised bogs can be found. Upland, low-lying and valley meadows reflect the extensive use by people for dairy cow raising. The entire biosphere reserve has been designated as Natura 2000 site and European Bird Protection Area because of black grouse (Tetrao tetrix) and black stork (<b>Ciconia</b> <b>nigra)</b> populations.|$|R

It was moved to the new genus Ciconia by French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson two years later. The word stork is derived from the Old English word storc, thought {{to be related to the}} Old High German storah, meaning [...] "stork", and the Old English stearc, meaning [...] "stiff".|$|R

Black storks selected dead trees in 46 % of the cases and showed a preference for roosts located close to foraging areas (on average within 4 km), the distance varying significantly according to season.

40|$|The {{black stork}} (<b>Ciconia</b> <b>nigra</b> Linnaeus, 1758) is an {{extraordinary}} bird {{not only for its}} elegance but also for its unique habitat. It prefers isolated places that are often inaccessible to humans and always in direct contact with water, a vital element for its biological cycle. Calabria is a region rich in natural beauty, with large coniferous forests, canyons, rivers, mountain streams and crystal clear lakes, an extensive area of which is legally protected since the 1970 ’s. All this has encouraged breeding of the black stork in Calabria, which, in the past was considered as rare and/or occasional. The present work outlines the results obtained in the above mentioned territory regarding breeding and flight activities of the three-year period with direct observations or reports from ornithologists. peer-reviewe...|$|R

Measuring on average [...] from beak tip to end of tail with a [...] wingspan, the adult black stork has mainly black plumage, with white underparts, long red legs and a long pointed red beak. A widespread, but uncommon, species, it breeds in scattered locations across Europe (predominantly in Spain, and central and eastern parts), and Asia to the Pacific Ocean. It is a long-distance migrant, with European populations wintering in tropical Sub-Saharan Africa, and Asian populations in the Indian subcontinent. When migrating between Europe and Africa, it avoids crossing the Mediterranean Sea and detours via the Levant in the east or the Strait of Gibraltar in the west. An isolated, non-migratory, population occurs in Southern Africa.|$|R
40|$|SEight {{unidentified}} Gram-positive, rod-shaped organisms {{were recovered}} from the tracheas of apparently healthy black storks (<b>Ciconia</b> <b>nigra)</b> and subjected to a polyphasic taxonomic analysis. Based on cellular morphology and biochemical criteria the isolates were tentatively assigned to the genus Corynebacterium, although three of the organisms {{did not appear to}} correspond to any recognized species. Comparative 16 S rRNA gene sequencing studies demonstrated that all of the isolates were phylogenetically members of the genus Corynebacterium. Five strains were genotypically identified as representing Corynebacterium falsenii, whereas the remaining three strains represented a hitherto unknown subline, associated with a small subcluster of species that includes Corynebacterium mastitidis and its close relatives. On the basis of phenotypic and phylogenetic evidence, it is proposed that the unknown isolates from black storks represent a novel species within the genus Corynebacterium, for which the Corynebacterium ciconiae sp. nov. is proposed.

There are 22 {{endangered}} species of birds including hawks, falcons, buzzards, cranes and owls. Though cranes are not hunted for superstitious reasons, they are still threatened due to habitat degradation and only 5000 breeding pairs are reported, mostly in Dornod’s Mongol Duguur Strictly Protected Area. In eastern Mongolia, a critically endangered species of crane is the white naped crane (Tsen togoru). Overall there are 469 species of birds, including species which are also domesticated and linked to the wild ancestral species. Of these, 330 species are migratory and 119 are seen in Mongolia throughout the year. Species identified include: golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos), lammergeyer (Gypaetus barbatus), spoonbills (Platalea leucorodia), Dalmatian pelican (Pelecanus crispus), great white egrets (Egretta alba), whooper swans (Cygnus cygnus), great black-headed gulls (Larus ichthyatus), black storks (<b>Ciconia</b> <b>nigra),</b> swan goose (Anser cygnoides) and snowcock (Tetraogallus altaicus) or Altain ular.|$|R

40|$|While {{alteration}} of the migratory habits of birds {{is widely regarded}} as one of the most evident ecological effects of climate change, studies reporting shifts in migration phenology for long-lived, long-distance migrants have been few. Using time series of count data collected in southern Spain during autumn migration, we examined the magnitude and direction of phenological shifts for six common species of soaring birds. Many current methods for investigating phenological change rely on continuous data sets; however, these data may be unavailable for a variety of reasons. We used a cross-correlation analysis, which allowed us to compare recent data on the timing of migration from 1999 – 2011 to a historic data set collected during 1976 – 1977. The direction of phenological shifts for autumn migration was species-specific. White Storks Ciconia ciconia and Black Kites Milvus migrans appeared to have delayed passage, Black Storks <b>Ciconia</b> <b>nigra</b> and European Honey Buzzards Pernis apivorus have advanced their migratory timing, and we found no clear phenological change for Short-toed Eagles Circaetus gallicus or Booted Eagles Hieraaetus pennatus...|$|R
