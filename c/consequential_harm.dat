40|$|BACKGROUND: People with {{intellectual}} disabilities {{often have}} a multitude of concurrent problems due to the combination of cognitive impairments, psychiatric disorders (particularly anxiety) and related challenging behaviours. Diagnoses in people with intellectual disabilities are complicated. This study evaluates {{the quality of the}} diagnoses and treatment plans after using a guideline that was developed to support professionals in their diagnostic tasks. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comparative multiple case study with an experimental and control condition, applying deductive analyses of diagnoses and treatment plans. RESULTS: The analyses revealed that the number of diagnostic statements and planned treatment actions in the experimental group was significantly larger and more differentiated than in the control condition. In the control group, <b>consequential</b> <b>harm</b> and protective factors were hardly mentioned in diagnoses and treatment plans. CONCLUSIONS: Working with the 'Diagnostic Guideline for Anxiety and CB' leads to improved diagnoses and treatment plans compared with care as usual...|$|E
40|$|Abstract This {{article will}} argue that social media {{in the hands of}} {{terrorist}} groups constitutes a weapon, and has become increasingly capable of contributing to the facilitation of <b>consequential</b> <b>harm</b> against identified targets. In doing so it will first clarify the communicative nature of terrorist action and provide an overview of the various contributions made by jihadist strategists to the evolution of terrorist practice, and in particular the re-emergence of the practice of individual terrorism. It will then identify the intersection of individual terrorism and social media and the development and deployment of a system of social media jihad. The article will explain the mechanisms by which terrorist groups exploit and deploy social media platforms, and inflict various harms, with a specific focus on individual and small cell terrorism in Western jurisdictions. Finally, a brief case study analysis of Anwar al-Awlaki will demonstrate the gravity with which governments have conceived of this problem, in part by highlighting the substantiveness of their responses...|$|E

However, automated surveillance using artificial intelligence (“machine learning”) techniques has also sharpened privacy concerns {{that have been}} acute since Edward Snowden’s disclosures. This Article examines machine-based surveillance by the NSA and other intelligence agencies {{through the prism of}} international human rights. Two camps have clashed on the human rights implications of machine surveillance abroad. The state-centric camp argues that human rights agreements like the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) do not apply extraterritorially. Moreover, the state-centric camp insists, machine surveillance is inherently unintrusive, like a dog seeing a human step out of the shower. Surveillance critics respond that machine and human access to data are equivalent invasions of privacy and legal protections must be equal for individuals within a state’s borders and nonnationals overseas. In a controversial recent decision, Schrems v. Data Protection Commissioner, the European Court of Justice appeared to side with surveillance’s critics. This Article argues that both the state-centric and critical positions are flawed. This Article agrees with surveillance critics that the ICCPR applies extraterritorially. Machine access to data can cause both ontological harm, stemming from individuals’ loss of spontaneity, and <b>consequential</b> <b>harm,</b> stemming from errors that machines compound in databases such as no-fly lists. However, the Schrems decision went too far by failing to acknowledge that human rights law provides states with a measure of deference in confronting threats such as ISIS. Deference on overseas surveillance is particularly appropriate given U. N. Security Council resolutions urging states to deny terrorists safe havens. But deference cannot be absolute. To provide appropriate safeguards, this Article recommends that machine searches abroad be tailored to compelling state purposes, scientifically validated, and subject to independent review...|$|E
40|$|The ways {{in which}} {{targeted}} communities experience hate speech is an important, but often neglected, component {{of the debate over}} the legitimacy of hate speech laws. This article reports on data drawn from interviews conducted with 101 members of Indigenous and minority ethnic communities in Australia regarding their experiences of hate speech. We give voice to targets’ experiences of face-to-face and more widely broadcast hate speech, and outline the constitutive and <b>consequential</b> <b>harms</b> they claim to have suffered. We assess these against the alleged harms of hate speech in the literature, finding a close correlation between targets’ reports and the literature...|$|R
50|$|Regulation {{and laws}} {{could not keep}} up with the rapid {{explosion}} of the hog farming and spread of CAFOs in the early 2000s, which has caused severe harm and health impacts over time. Furthermore, agencies with jurisdiction over CAFOs are typically environmental or natural resource state-run agencies, as opposed to local health departments. This is an advantage for addressing environmental impacts but a disadvantage for human health concerns, as the majority of local health issues get overlooked by state-run agencies. Additionally, although there are laws and regulations in place, such as the Swine Farm Environmental Performance Standards Act, which prohibits new waste lagoons and mandates that new CAFOs must use technology that will prevent discharge of waste, these regulations do not mandate for existing CAFOs to clean up or regulate the pollutants within their lagoons. These regulations also make it more costly to clean up these wastes and prevent other <b>consequential</b> <b>harms,</b> without actually assisting farms in shouldering these costs, making {{it difficult for them to}} actually act on these regulations.|$|R
40|$|The commodification of {{reproductive}} material evokes different responses. Some {{argue that the}} sale {{of reproductive}} material should be prohibited. Others argue in favor of unfettered baby markets on principle or to achieve broad-scale access to reproductive technologies. In this Article, the author responds {{to the emergence of}} baby markets with great skepticism, but reluctant acceptance. Drawing on a relational conception of autonomy and self-definition, she argues that commodification of reproductive material is intrinsically harmful. Moreover, such commodification poses a number of <b>consequential</b> <b>harms.</b> Nevertheless, in spite of these concerns, the author 2 ̆ 2 gives in 2 ̆ 2 to baby markets, which is to say she does not argue for the prohibition of these markets, but instead for their regulation and oversight. The author gives in to baby markets {{in part because of the}} great impracticality of prohibiting markets given how well entrenched they are; people have been buying and selling reproductive material for some time. In addition, although there are risks of markets, the risk-benefit calculus calls for allowing markets to exist, provided there is careful and serious regulation of such markets. In other words, the author is not willing to accept completely free and unfettered markets...|$|R
40|$|The Internal Revenue Code {{privileges}} {{married couples}} {{in several different}} ways. Not only do certain rules offer economic benefit, but the rules also serve an expressive function by delivering a message {{about the value of}} marriage. Despite the existence of the marriage tax penalty {{and a handful of other}} rules that only benefit the traditional one-earner married couple, the Internal Revenue Code, on balance, privileges marriage over non-marriage, and thus privileges heterosexuality. This article identifies three distinctive harms to gay men and lesbians that result from this privileging of heterosexual marriage. They are: (1) the denial of specific tax benefits granted to married couples; (2) a stigmatic harm from failing to accord any recognition of same-sex relationships; and (3) certain <b>consequential</b> <b>harms</b> or burdens caused by rules that either ignore same-sex relationships or presume that same-sex relationships do not exist. The article then discusses specific examples of these harms, including (1) the inability of gay couples to split income, (2) the taxation of fringe benefits provided to domestic partners, (3) the taxation of gratuitous transfers, (4) the treatment of joint tenancy ownership under the estate tax, and (5) the lack of clear rules regarding property divisions when gay couples terminate their relationships. The article does not propose solutions to all of these problems. Its purpose is to broaden our understanding of the different ways in which laws privileging heterosexual marriage can cause harm to same-sex committed couples...|$|R

This report provides advice on high level issues that ACMD believe the Government should give careful consideration to in addressing legally available psychoactive substances. The report does not purport to provide a single solution to the problem, but rather a number of practicable options that, in combination, seek to tackle the on-going sale, supply and <b>consequential</b> <b>harms.</b> It is important that the Government recognises that each and every department, that has a locus of responsibility in drug issues should both take personal ownership and share collective responsibility of the recommendations in this report. Tackling the issues that are raised by novel psychoactive substances requires a co-ordination of efforts that can only be realised by a strategic and co-operative approach. The ACMD has identified lead departments for each of the recommendations that should assist and guide the Government in this aim. The ACMD provides key recommendations in this report on legislation, public health, education and research. The key legislative measures are primarily concerned with tightening the enforcement of existing legislation and moving the responsibility for the supply of novel psychoactive substances to the vendors, such that the burden of proof falls to them. The ACMD believe it is for vendors to prove that such substances are neither analogues of current medicines nor products harmful to consumers in their intended form.

40|$|In Australia, both {{common and}} {{statutory}} law allows compensation for negligently occasioned recognised psychiatric injury, but distinguishes between pure mental <b>harm</b> and <b>consequential</b> mental <b>harm.</b> This column briefly discusses {{the concept of}} pure "mental harm" and the major Australian cases relating to defendants 2 ̆ 7 liability to third parties for causing them pure mental harm (Jaensch v Coffey (1984)   155 CLR 549 [PDF]; Tame v New South Wales; Annetts v Australian Stations Pty Ltd (2002)   211 CLR 317 [PDF]; Sullivan v Moody (2001)   207 CLR 562 [PDF]; and Gifford v Strang Patrick Stevedoring Pty Ltd (2003)   214 CLR 269 [PDF]). The analysis focuses on judicial approaches to determining liability in these cases, especially causation. Lack of guiding principles and precise tests for attribution of liability are illustrated by Kemp v Lyell McEwin Health Service (2006)   96 SASR 192 [PDF].

40|$|Introduction  Taxing {{tobacco is}} one of the most {{effective}} ways to reduce smoking prevalence, mitigate its devastating <b>consequential</b> health <b>harms</b> and progress towards a tobacco-free society. This study modelled the health and economic impacts of increasing the existing cigarette tobacco duty escalator (TDE) in the UK from the current 2 % above consumer price inflation to 5 %.   Methods  A two-stage modelling process was used. First, a non-linear multivariate regression model was fitted to cross-sectional smoking data, creating longitudinal projections from 2015 to 2035. Second, these projections were used to predict the future incidence, prevalence and cost of 17 smoking-related diseases using a Monte Carlo microsimulation approach. A sustained increase in the duty escalator was evaluated against a baseline of continuing historical smoking trends and the existing duty escalator.   Results  A sustained increase in the TDE is projected to reduce adult smoking prevalence to 6 % in 2035, from 10 % in a baseline scenario. After increasing the TDE, only 65 % of female and 60 % of male would-be smokers would actually be smoking in 2035. The intervention is projected to avoid around 75 200 new cases of smoking-related diseases between 2015 and 2035. In 2035 alone, £ 49 m in National Health Service and social care costs and £ 192 m in societal premature mortality and morbidity costs are projected to be avoided.   Conclusion  Increasing the UK TDE to 5 % above inflation could effectively reduce smoking prevalence, prevent diseases and avoid healthcare costs. It would deliver substantial progress towards a tobacco-free society and should be implemented by the UK Government with urgency...|$|R
