25|$|Reason and {{imagination}} rely on similar mental processes. Imagination {{is not only}} found in humans. Aristotle, for example, stated that phantasia (imagination: that which can hold images or phantasmata) and phronein (a type of thinking that <b>can</b> <b>judge</b> and understand in some sense) also exist in some animals. According to him, both {{are related to the}} primary perceptive ability of animals, which gathers the perceptions of different senses and defines the order {{of the things that are}} perceived without distinguishing universals, and without deliberation or logos. But this is not yet reason, because human imagination is different.|$|E
25|$|I am {{unable to}} state with {{certainty}} what language the Pelasgians spoke, but we could consider the speech of the Pelasgians who still exist in settlements above Tyrrhenia {{in the city of}} Kreston, formerly neighbors to the Dorians who at that time lived in the land now called Thessaliotis; also the Pelasgians who once lived with the Athenians and then settled Plakia and Skylake in the Hellespont; and along with those who lived with all the other communities and were once Pelasgian but changed their names. If one <b>can</b> <b>judge</b> by this evidence, the Pelasgians spoke a barbarian language. And so, if the Pelasgian language was spoken in all these places, the people of Attica being originally Pelasgian, must have learned a new language when they became Hellenes. As a matter of fact, the people of Krestonia and Plakia no longer speak the same language, which shows that they continue to use the dialect they brought with them when they migrated to those lands.|$|E

500|$|While still {{detained}} by the French, Wodehouse was again mentioned in {{questions in the}} House of Commons in December 1944 when MPs wondered if the French authorities could repatriate him to stand trial. Eden stated that the [...] "matter has been gone into, and, according to the advice given, there are no grounds upon which we could take action". Two months later George Orwell wrote the essay [...] "In Defence of P.G. Wodehouse", where he stated that [...] "it is important to realise that the events of 1941 do not convict Wodehouse of anything worse than stupidity". Orwell's rationale was that Wodehouse's [...] "moral outlook has remained that of a public-school boy, {{and according to the}} public-school code, treachery in time of war is the most unforgivable of all the sins", which was compounded by his [...] "complete lack—so far as one <b>can</b> <b>judge</b> from his printed works—of political awareness".|$|E

500|$|In 1991, Mosley {{challenged}} Balestre for {{the presidency}} of FISA. Mosley said that his decision to challenge the Frenchman was prompted by Balestre's reported intervention {{on behalf of his}} countryman Alain Prost to ensure that race stewards disqualified Brazilian driver Ayrton Senna from the 1989 Japanese Grand Prix. Mosley campaigned on the basis that Balestre, who was also president of the FIA and of the Fédération Française du Sport Automobile, could not effectively manage all these roles together. He also said that no-one challenged Balestre because they were afraid of the consequences and suggested that the FISA President should not interfere with F1, which could be left to run itself. Mosley won the FISA presidency by 43 votes to 29; Balestre remained as FIA president. Mosley resigned a year later, fulfilling a promise made during his election campaign to seek a re-affirmation of his mandate. [...] "I wanted to show people that I do what I say", he said. [...] "Now they <b>can</b> <b>judge</b> me in a year's time." [...] FISA immediately re-elected him.|$|E
