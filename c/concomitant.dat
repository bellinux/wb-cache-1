5|$|A second {{option is}} to {{increase}} the amount of well-watered vegetation. These two options can be combined with the implementation of green roofs. Green roofs are excellent insulators during the warm weather months and the plants cool the surrounding environment.

The city of New York determined that the cooling potential per area was highest for street trees, followed by living roofs, light covered surface, and open space planting. From the standpoint of cost effectiveness, light surfaces, light roofs, and curbside planting have lower costs per temperature reduction.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{incidence}} of respiratory depression/arrest is low (0.1–0.5%) when midazolam is administered alone at normal doses, the <b>concomitant</b> use with CNS acting drugs, mainly analgesic opiates, may increase the possibility of hypotension, respiratory depression, respiratory arrest, and death, even at therapeutic doses. Potential drug interactions involving at least one CNS depressant were observed for 84% of midazolam users who were subsequently required to receive the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil. Therefore, efforts directed toward monitoring drug interactions and preventing injuries from midazolam administration {{are expected to have}} a substantial impact on the safe use of this drug.|$|E
5|$|Bupropion-induced {{psychosis}} {{may develop}} in select populations, or worsen a pre-existing psychotic syndrome. Symptoms may include delusions, hallucinations, paranoia, and confusion.

However, adding a benzodiazepine to treat psychosis, instead of an antipsychotic, may become a valid alternative according to the model of amphetamine-induced psychosis. Psychotic symptoms are associated with factors such as higher doses of bupropion, a history of bipolar disorder or psychosis, <b>concomitant</b> medications, for example, lithium or benzodiazepines, old age, or substance abuse.|$|E

The interpretation that Deckard is a replicant is challenged by others who believe the unicorn imagery shows that the characters, whether human or replicant, share the same dreams and recognize their affinity, or that the absence of a decisive answer is crucial to the film's main theme. The film's inherent ambiguity and uncertainty, as well as its textual richness, have permitted viewers to see it from multiple perspectives.|$|E

The fraction of those who die after being hospitalized with TBI fell from almost half in the 1970s to about a quarter {{at the beginning of the}} 21stcentury.

Although rare in young children with severe malaria, acute respiratory distress syndrome occurs in 5–25% of adults and up to 29% of pregnant women.

40|$|My {{research}} studies algebras of holomorphic functions from d-tuples of n× n- matrices, M_n() ^d, to M_n(). In particular, I study the holomorphic functions {{that can be}} approximated by polynomial matrix <b>concomitants,</b> that is polynomial maps from M_n() ^d to M_n() that satisfy the relationship f(g^- 1 g) = g^- 1 f() g for every ∈ M_n() ^d and g∈ GL_n(). In a sense, these are the polynomial maps that “remember” {{the structure of the}} d-tuple. My first result is that these holomorphic matrix <b>concomitants</b> can be identified with holomorphic cross sections of certain matrix bundles. A holomorphic matrix bundle is a fibred space in which every fibre is M_n() and the fibres are glued together {{in such a way that}} the total space has a holomorphic structure. Once the identification between holomorphic cross sections and holomorphic <b>concomitants</b> is established, the structure of the matrix bundle is used to endow the algebra of continuous cross sections with a C^*-algebra structure.

The adenosyl version of B12 catalyzes rearrangements in which a hydrogen atom is directly transferred between two adjacent atoms with <b>concomitant</b> exchange of the second substituent, X, which may be a carbon atom with substituents, an oxygen atom of an alcohol, or an amine.
