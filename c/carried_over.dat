5|$|Bhunivelze's {{physical}} form for Lightning Returns {{was designed by}} Toshitaka Matsuda. Matsuda made his design elaborate and detailed as a representation of both Nova Chrysalia and the entire universe. This design motif <b>carried</b> <b>over</b> to him being fused to the arena floor during the final battle. The character is voiced by Daniel Riordan in English and Yūki Kaji in Japanese.|$|E
5|$|Dave Grossman and Tim Schafer co-led the game's development, {{their first}} time in such a role. The pair <b>carried</b> <b>over</b> {{a limited number of}} {{elements}} from Maniac Mansion and forwent the character selection aspect to simplify development. Inspirations included Chuck Jones cartoons and the history of the United States. Day of the Tentacle is the eighth LucasArts title to use the SCUMM engine.|$|E
5|$|However, {{many of the}} {{features}} introduced in Alpha Centauri were <b>carried</b> <b>over</b> into subsequent Civilization titles; in fact, upon its release, Civilization III was compared negatively to Alpha Centauri, whose Civilization characteristics were reminiscent of faction bonuses and penalties.|$|E
40|$|Task {{demands that}} {{influence}} scanning behaviour in one task can cause that behaviour to persist {{to a second}} unrelated task (<b>carry</b> <b>over).</b> This can also affect performance on a second task (e. g., hazard perception ratings), and {{has been attributed to}} a process of attentional bias that is modulated by top-down influences (Thompson & Crundall, 2011). In a series of experiments we explored how these top-down influences impact upon <b>carry</b> <b>over.</b> In all experiments, participants searched letters that were presented horizontally, vertically, or in a random array. They were then presented with a driving scene and rated the hazardousness of the scene. <b>Carry</b> <b>over</b> of eye-movements from the letter search to the scene was observed in all experiments. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that this <b>carry</b> <b>over</b> effect influenced hazard perception accuracy. The magnitude of <b>carry</b> <b>over</b> was correlated with task switching abilities, attentional conflicting, and attentional orienting (Experiment 1), and was affected by predictability of the primary task (Experiment 2). Furthermore, direct current stimulation of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and parietal areas affected the magnitude of the effect (Experiment 3). These results indicate that <b>carry</b> <b>over</b> is modulated by the specific ability to orient attention and disengage from this orientation. Over orienting leads to increased <b>carry</b> <b>over</b> and insufficient task switching is detrimental to task performance. As a result the current experiments provide evidence that the <b>carry</b> <b>over</b> effect is strongly influenced by attentional processes, namely orienting, inhibition, and task switching...|$|R

5|$|M.C. Curthoys and H.S. Jones {{argue that}} the rise of {{organised}} sport {{was one of the}} most remarkable and distinctive features of the history of the universities of Oxford and Cambridge in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It was <b>carried</b> <b>over</b> from the athleticism prevalent at the public schools such as Eton and Harrow.|$|E
5|$|Presidents {{nominal rating}} {{was that of}} a 44-gun ship. However, she usually <b>carried</b> <b>over</b> 50guns. During her service in the War of 1812, President was armed with a battery of 55guns: thirty-two 24-pounder (10.9kg) cannon, twenty-two 42-pounder (19kg) carronades, and one 18-pounder (8kg) long gun.|$|E
5|$|Season one aired between March 24 and April 26, 2005. It {{originally}} debuted as a midseason {{replacement for}} Committed. It <b>carried</b> <b>over</b> general plot {{ideas from the}} earlier British series created by Stephen Merchant and Ricky Gervais, and particularly the threat of wholesale downsizing. However, only the pilot was a direct adaptation {{of one of the}} UK version's episodes.|$|E

This proposed service was projected to <b>carry</b> <b>over</b> 100,000 passengers per day.|$|R
5|$|Some higher {{forms of}} land life are now colonising {{the soil of}} Surtsey. The first {{earthworm}} {{was found in a}} soil sample in 1993, probably <b>carried</b> <b>over</b> from Heimaey by a bird. However, the next year earthworms were not found. Slugs were found in 1998, and appeared to be similar to varieties found in the southern Icelandic mainland. Spiders and beetles have also become established.|$|E
5|$|Supplies {{could be}} flown into Wau if fighter cover was available. On 5 September, 12 planeloads of {{supplies}} were dropped at Kudjeru. To economise on scarce transport aircraft, air transport was supplemented by an overland route. Supplies were {{shipped to the}} mouth of the Lakekamu in luggers, transported up the river to Bulldog in launches or powered dugout canoes, and then <b>carried</b> <b>over</b> the Bulldog Track by native carriers.|$|E
5|$|The Broken Wing was a hit, {{and after}} the play's New York run Calleia and Thurston Hall were <b>carried</b> <b>over</b> in a London production.

5|$|The D± signals used by low, full, {{and high}} speed are <b>carried</b> <b>over</b> a twisted pair (typically, unshielded) to reduce noise and crosstalk. SuperSpeed uses {{separate}} transmit and receive differential pairs, which additionally require shielding (typically, {{shielded twisted pair}} but twinax is also mentioned by the specification). Thus, to support SuperSpeed data transmission, cables contain twice as many wires and are thus larger in diameter.|$|E
5|$|The final {{took place}} on 11 and 12 December, with each episode lasting two hours. During the first show, the voting lines were frozen and the fourth placed {{contestant}} was eliminated.

The final two performed the potential winner's singles before the winner was announced.|$|E

There are ten difficulty settings in Resonance of Fate.|$|E
5|$|Although quick {{draw and}} hip {{shooting}} {{was an important}} skill in the West, {{only a handful of}} historically known gunslingers were known to be fast, such as Luke Short, John Wesley Hardin, Wild Bill Hickok, Doc Holliday, and Billy the Kid. Shooting a pistol with one hand is normally associated with gunslingers, and is also a standard for them of the era to carry two guns and fire ambidextrously. Capt. Jonathan R. Davis carried two revolvers in his iconic gunfight, while Jesse James himself <b>carried</b> <b>over</b> half a dozen revolvers in many of his gunfights.|$|E
5|$|As {{opposed to}} the VZ and all models {{previous}} which used Opel-sourced platforms adapted both mechanically and in size for the local market, the whole-new VE programme is the first Commodore to be developed exclusively by Holden in Australia. Despite its status as an all-new model, engines—comprising the 3.6-litre V6 and more powerful 6.0-litre V8—have been largely <b>carried</b> <b>over</b> from the VZ series. Innovative features to help minimise export redevelopment costs, such as a symmetrical centre console housing a flush-fitting hand brake lever, facilitate the conversion to left-hand drive. Internationally, the VE was badge engineered as the Chevrolet Lumina, Chevrolet Omega and Pontiac G8.|$|E

The lyrics of Play with Toys and Not in Kansas Anymore focus on {{subjects such as}} alcohol and cannabis use, depression, philosophy, politics and relationships. Beginning with the 1996 release of Faith, the group's lyrics have focused primarily on Christian themes, which <b>carried</b> <b>over</b> to its albums In the Name of Jesus, dc Basehead and Rockalyptic Music.|$|E
5|$|Bird, who was Pixar's first outside director, {{developed}} {{the film as}} an extension of 1960s comic books and spy films from his boyhood and personal family life. He pitched the film to Pixar after the box office disappointment of his first feature, The Iron Giant (1999), and <b>carried</b> <b>over</b> much of its staff to develop The Incredibles. The animation team was tasked with animating an all-human cast, which required creating new technology to animate detailed human anatomy, clothing and realistic skin and hair. Michael Giacchino composed the film's orchestral score.|$|E
5|$|By 13 January {{most of the}} {{survivors}} of the fleet had limped back to France in a state of disrepair. One ship of the line that remained at sea, the 74-gun Droits de l'Homme, was commanded by Commodore Jean-Baptiste Raymond de Lacrosse and <b>carried</b> <b>over</b> 1,300men, 700–800 of them soldiers, including General Jean Humbert. Detached from {{the main body of the}} fleet during the retreat from Bantry Bay, Lacrosse made his way to the mouth of the Shannon alone. Recognising that the weather was still too violent for a landing to be made, Lacrosse acknowledged the failure of the operation and ordered the ship to return to France, capturing the British privateer Cumberland en route.|$|E
