Second, similarity detection task requires the comparison of anonymous texts against other anonymous texts in order to assess the degree of similarity.

Although these learning algorithms frequently address the same problem of learning from preclassified examples and much previous work in inductive learning has focused on the algorithms ’ predictive accuracy, little {{attention has been paid to}} the effect of data factors on the performance of a learning system. An experiment was conducted using five learning algorithms on two data sets to investigate how the change in labeling the class attribute can alter the behavior of learning algorithms. The results show that different preclassification rules applied on the training examples can affect either the classification accuracy or classification structure.

40|$|One of the {{challenges}} facing the computer science community {{is the development of}} techniques and tools to discover new and useful information from large collections of data. There are a number of basic issues associated with this challenge and many are still unresolved.

The recent efforts of KDD researchers have focused primarily on issues surrounding the individual steps of the discovery process. Those issues that are not directly related to the discovery process have received much less attention. One such issue is the impact of this new technology on database security.

40|$|Abstract — As the use {{of mobile}} devices is {{increasing}} rapidly day by day, huge number of mobile apps are coming into the market. Many of these apps are providing similar functionality and are coming from multiple unknown vendors. As a result, having a proper classification of these apps can {{turn out to be}} useful for various purposes like making it easy and time efficient for the user to select the required app, understanding the user preferences that can motivate the intelligent personalized services, etc. Having a effective classification for proper mobile app usage analysis, effective classification is required for which {{there is a need to}} have detailed information about the app. However this is nontrivial task as limited contextual information is available. As the information available about the apps is short and spares, classification of the apps can also be considered as coming into the <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>classification</b> of short and spares text. Various methods to classify the short and sparse text are present, which can be used for classification of the mobile apps. In this paper we have presented one such method in which we will be extracting the contextual information from sources like information from the labels (app name), information from the web search engine (snippets) and the contextual usage history of the app collected from the users usage record and also we will extract the permissions of the app requests before being installed. This is will give us effective and secure classification of the apps as most of these apps are coming from an unknown vendors and so they have the higher possibility of being malicious...|$|E

The disease, which existed in a natural form until 1977, had great importance {{in the history of}} humanity, but has now been eradicated after a successful worldwide vaccination program. After the last naturally occurring case, in Somalia in 1977, routine vaccination against smallpox among the general public ceased because it was no longer necessary for prevention. The fact that we have returned to the study of smallpox, once eradicated, is that {{it is one of the}} main biological agents which can be used as a biological weapon of bioterrorism. The smallpox virus is included in the A <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>classification</b> of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, because: it can be easily disseminated or transmitted from person to person; there are high mortality rates; the potential for a major public health impact is high; public panic may be caused; social disruption could follow and special action for public health preparedness would be required.

40|$|This article evaluates dynamic driver {{behaviour}} models {{that can be}} used, {{in the context of}} intelligent transport systems (ITS), to predict drivers 2 ̆ 7 compliance with traffic information. The inputs to this type of models comprise drivers 2 ̆ 7 individual socio-economic characteristics and other variables that may influence their compliance behaviour. The output is a binary integer representing whether drivers comply with travel advice or not. Two approaches are available for formulating this <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>classification</b> problems: discrete choice models and artificial neural networks (ANNs). The literature on this topic clearly points to the limitations of the discrete choice approach which suffers from assumptions of perfect information about travel conditions, infinite information processing capabilities of drivers and inability to model the uncertainty in driver decision making or the vagueness in information received from ITS devices. ANNs, on the other hand, are able to deal with complex non-linear relationships, are fault tolerant in producing acceptable results under imperfect inputs and are suitable for modelling reactive behaviour which is often described using rules, linking a perceived situation with appropriate action. This study aims to evaluate the performance of these two categories of models based on a common data set of {{driver behaviour}}, collected from a field behavioural survey on a congested commuting corridor in Brisbane, Australia. This article proposes the combination of fuzzy logic and neural networks as a viable approach for overcoming the limitations of existing algorithms by modelling drivers as heterogeneous individuals. The results showed superior performance for a neuro-fuzzy model over binary choice models in terms of classifying or predicting the categories of drivers most likely to comply (or not comply) with traffic advice. The accuracy of the proposed model, in terms of classification rate, ranged between 95 and 97...|$|E
40|$|Self-medication is {{a process}} through which the {{individual}} assumes {{a greater degree of}} responsibility for the management of a minor health problem, by acquiring a medicine that is accessible without the need to obtain a medical prescription. Access to health care is undergoing important changes in the European Union. In the presence of factors such as aging populations and economic constraints on health systems, greater emphasis to the efficient use of health resources has been given. Self-care, which comprises self-medication assumes, in this context, an important role by encouraging individuals to take greater responsibility for their own health and wellbeing, choose healthy life choices, consult the pharmacist when appropriate and to establish whether and when medical treatment should be sought. In order to promote the rational use of medicinal products, the subcategory of non-prescription medicinal products exclusively dispensed in pharmacies has gained expression in different European countries. As the name implies, this category includes medicines that, by their nature and given the framework of the condition for which they are intended, are considered safe for dispensing without the requirement of a prescription, possess some attribute that makes them elective for dispensing under the supervision of a health professional, in this case the pharmacist, in order to promote safety and efficiency in their use. The different Member States have advanced at different times with the implementation of this <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>classification</b> regarding the dispensing to the public of medicines. Portugal introduced in 2013 this category of medicines in its legal framework. If, on one hand, the big drivers for the classification of more medicines in categories non-prescription medicinal products and non-prescription medicinal products exclusively dispensed in pharmacies have been the greater empowerment of the patient regarding the management of his health and the reduction of expenditure on medicines by health systems, the rational and safe use of medicines has conditioned the progress in this area at European level. The reclassification of a medicine and / or the corresponding indication is associated with several benefits and risks, which affect not only the consumer, also having an impact on health professionals, doctors and pharmacists, insurance companies and institutions / state authorities. The need for the discussion of this issue in our country, with the participation of the different stakeholders involved: the regulatory authority, health professionals, the pharmaceutical industry and patients should be emphasized...|$|E
