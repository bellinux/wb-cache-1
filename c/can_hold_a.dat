5|$|This iPad uses an {{internal}} rechargeable lithium-ion polymer (LiPo) battery that <b>can</b> <b>hold</b> <b>a</b> charge of 11,560mAh. The batteries {{are made in}} Taiwan by Simplo Technology (60%) and Dynapack International Technology (40%). The iPad {{is designed to be}} charged with a relatively high current of 2amps using the included 12W USB power adapter and Lightning connector. While it can be charged by an older USB port from a computer, these are limited to 500milliamps (0.5amps). As a result, if the iPad is in use while powered by a computer, it may charge very slowly, or not at all. High-power USB ports found in newer computers and accessories provide full charging capabilities. Apple claims that the battery can provide up to 10hours of video, audio playback, or web surfing on Wi-Fi, 9hours of web surfing over a cellular connection, or one month on standby. Like any rechargeable battery, the iPad's battery loses capacity over time. However, the iPad's battery is not user-replaceable. In a program similar to iPod and iPhone battery-replacement programs, Apple promised to replace an iPad that does not hold an electrical charge with a refurbished unit for a fee. During the battery replacement process, user data is not preserved/transferred, and repaired or refurbished units come with a new case. The warranty on the refurbished unit may vary between jurisdictions.|$|E

Three–quarters of the terrace is covered, whilst one–quarter is open and without cover. The stand <b>can</b> <b>hold</b> <b>a</b> capacity of 700 people, and also offers facilities for disabled fans. In January 2013, the club announced they were due to present plans to replace the existing North Terrace with a new £1.2 million 1,700 seat stand. Opposite the North Terrace is the South Stand, which is a single tiered, all-seated covered stand. The stand was built in 2001, costing £600,000. The South Stand is reserved for away supporters and <b>can</b> <b>hold</b> <b>a</b> capacity of 1,400. The stand also has an electronic scoreboard in the centre of the roof, which was installed in 2001, making it visible to home supporters. The scoreboard was replaced in October 2011.

This location has attracted criticism due to the poor view offered by being so far from the pitch due the height of the stand, and the 14 flights of stairs to reach the upper level. For FA Cup matches the lower section of the corner is also used.|$|E
