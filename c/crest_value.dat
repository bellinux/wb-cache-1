40|$|When nephroptosis {{patients}} are in upright posit i o n, frequently, excretory {{time from the}} renal pelvis to the bladder is delayed. It is caused by retention of urine in the renal pelvis {{as a result of}} renal ptosis, torsion of the renal pedicle or kink of the ureter. Therefore, there exists a time discrepancy between plasma concentration and urine concentration of clearance substances. In order to find out the difference in the renal function between standing up and laying down position, the author tried to use exponential function curve in blood concentration of PAH and half <b>crest</b> <b>value</b> time on each of the following groups of patients : 15 persons with normal kidneys as a control group, 15 persons with unilateral nephroptosis, 15 persons with bilateral nephroptosis, 5 persons with remaining normal kidney as a control group, and 5 persons with nephroptosis of the remaining kidney. In addition to these, 4 persons who had nephropexy for unilaterl nephroptosis were examined pre and postoperatively. The results are summarized as fol l ows: 1) In normal persons, eliminatin g constant (K) is almost equal in both upright and supine position. There also are no remarkable difference of average (K) between upright and supine position in both normal and nephroptosis patients unilaterally. or bilaterally, for the first half an hour following injection. After that, however, the difference becomes larger in order of normal persons, unilateral nephroptosis patients and bilateral nephroptosis patients. In the cases of remaining kidney with nephroptosis, the difference average of (K) between upright and supine position is most remarkable for the first half an hour following injection. 2) The characteristic distribution area is seen in each of the exponential function curve of different groups. 3) In normal a d ults, half <b>crest</b> <b>value</b> time is 19. 3 ± 2. 44 min. in supine position and 22. 4 ± 1. 89 min. in upright position.

The modelled values confirm that the crests observed near 15 ° latitude in the winter hemisphere are due to adiabatic heating and the troughs observed near the magnetic equator are due to adiabatic cooling as plasma is transported along the magnetic field lines from the summer hemisphere to the winter hemisphere. The modelled values also confirm that the interhemispheric plasma transport needed to produce the required adiabatic heating/cooling can be induced by F-region neutral winds. It is shown that the longitudinal {{variations in}} the observed troughs and crests arise mainly from the longitudinal {{variations in the}} magnetic meridional wind. At longitudes where the magnetic declination angle is positive the eastward geographic zonal wind combines with the northward (summer hemisphere to winter hemisphere) geographic meridional wind to enhance the northward magnetic meridional wind.

40|$|Along a {{non-uniform}} flow {{in a stream}} or river, the pressure, energy, and momentum coefficients tend to vary from section to section. These coefficients also tend to vary with the water depth and discharge. Although some researchers provided some values of these coefficients for special conditions, their spatial variability in accelerated flow has not been adequately investigated. To simplify calculations, the values of these coefficients are usually assumed to be constants. This implies that the cross-sectional velocity and pressure distributions do not change with space. Values of these constants are often regarded as unity, which implies that the velocity is uniformly distributed over the cross section while the pressure distribution is hydrostatic. However, effect of these coefficients on the solution of {{non-uniform flow}} equations is not well understood. In this study, a new simple method for computing the pressure, energy, and momentum correction coefficients from the water surface profile for accelerating flow over block stones ramp was developed. This method {{is based on the}} assumption that the water depth at the beginning of the ramp is equal to the critical depth.

40|$|In this thesis, the {{modelling}} of {{the horizontal}} velocity field under waves using Boussinesqtype models is studied. Special {{attention is paid}} to the prediction of bottom velocities in view of sediment-transport formulations. Boussinesq-type models describe the propagation of weakly non-linear shallow-water waves. The depth-dependence of the velocity field has been removed in deriving the equations, which are therefore stated in the surface elevation and one single horizontal velocity variable, the so-called computational velocity. After integration of the Boussinesq-type equations, the horizontal velocity field must be reproduced in some kind of postprocessing. Many different forms of Boussinesq-type equations exist. They differ in frequency-dispersion and shoaling characteristics {{as well as in the}} used computational velocity variable. Various different forms ofBoussinesq-type equations are compared in view of their capability in reproducing the horizontal velocity field. A set of equations with good frequency-dispersion and shoaling behaviour and stated in terms of the depth-averaged horizontal velocity is selected for numerical treatment. The method to reconstruct the horizontal velocity field from the depth-averaged velocity is described. The selected equations are implemented in an existing time domain Boussinesq model (Beji and Battjes, 1994) supplemented with a formulation to obtain the horizontal velocity field. The model is validated against surface elevation data from three different wave flume experiments (see Dingemans, 1994 a and Luth et al., 1994). The time domain model is used to predict the horizontal velocity field, especially bottom velocities, obtained from wave flume experiments of non-breaking regular waves propagating over a submerged bar (Luth et al., 1994). The results show encouraging agreement with the measurements. The comparison is limited inshore by the wave breaking process. In order to predict horizontal velocities in breaking waves, a spectral Boussinesq model in which a spectral breaking term is incorporated (Eldeberky and Battjes, 1995), is used. This model is based on the assumption of uni-directional wave propagation and therefore only yields surface elevations. The spectral model is extended to compute the depth-averaged horizontal velocity and, subsequently, the complete horizontal velocity field. The extended spectral model is verified against wave flume experiments of irregular (partially) breaking waves propagating over a nearly monotonic sandy beach (Arcilla et aI., 1994 and Roelvink and Reniers, 1995). In the comparison of computations with measurements, the focus is on bottom velocity time series and resulting third odd velocity moments. Good results are obtained for long waves. For shorter waves a significant underestimation of the <b>crest</b> <b>values</b> and velocity moments is found. It is concluded that the accuracy in predicting horizontal velocities with Boussinesq models is comparable to the accuracy in predicting surface elevations. The latter is limited by the inaccurate frequency dispersion of Boussinesq models in deeper water. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

30|$|According to Johnson (1963), Torr and Torr (1973), and Rishbeth and Setty (1961), {{the lowest}} VTEC {{observed}} during the June solstice is possibly {{due to the}} asymmetric heating of the two hemispheres, which results in transportation of neutral constituents from the summer to the winter hemisphere, thereby reducing the recombination rate (or lose of electrons). This may account for an increase of the electron concentration during the winter. Furthermore, Earth’s magnetic field is believed to guide plasma from the summer to the winter hemisphere. The semi-annual plasma change at low latitudes is caused by semi-annual changes in neutral composition of the atmosphere. At solstice, the atmosphere is generally more mixed due to summer upwelling and winter downwelling, as well as transport of gases from the summer to the winter hemisphere. This {{can result in a}} lower ionization <b>crest</b> <b>value</b> during the summer solstice than during the winter solstice (Bhuyan and Borah 2007; Wu et al. 2004). In addition, there is a gradual increase of the VTEC values during the period of 2009 – 2011. This gradual increase may be associated with an increase in solar activity as indicated by an increase in sunspot numbers during 2010 and 2011. The mean annual values of sunspot numbers during the period of 2009 – 2011 were 3.1, 16.5, and 55.7, respectively (see [URL] Thus, during the period of very low solar activity (2009), the ionospheric TEC built up slowly, resulting in low TEC values (with relative maxima around midday). In 2010 and 2011, however, the solar activity levels started to increase, which directly resulted in a higher overall ionospheric electron density, leading to higher VTEC values (especially during 2011). For instance, the measured VTEC values observed during 2011 are larger (by a factor of almost two) than those observed in 2009 over the same station (Nazret; see bottom left panels of Figs.  5 and 7).|$|E
5|$|The {{other main}} {{behavioural}} {{theory is that}} the crest was used for intra-species recognition. This means that the crest could have been used for species recognition, as a warning signal, and for other, non-sexual uses. These could have been some of the reasons crests evolved in Parasaurolophus and other hadrosaurids. Instead, social and physiological functions have become more supported as function(s) of the crest, focusing on visual and auditory identification and communication. As a large object, the <b>crest</b> has clear <b>value</b> as a visual signal, and sets this animal apart from its contemporaries. The large size of hadrosaurid eye sockets and the presence of sclerotic rings in the eyes imply acute vision and diurnal habits, evidence that sight was important to these animals. If, as is commonly illustrated, a skin frill extended from the crest to the neck or back, the proposed visual display would have been even showier. As is suggested by other lambeosaurine skulls, the crest of Parasaurolophus likely permitted both species identification (such as separating it from Corythosaurus or Lambeosaurus) and sexual identification by shape and size.|$|R
40|$|Solar {{activity}} during 2008 - 2009 was extremely low among several recent solar cycles, raising {{an interesting question}} regarding the temporal and spatial distribution of the plasma parameters in ionosphere during this time period. This study analyzes the electron density (Ne) data recorded by the DEMETER satellite {{at the height of}} 670 km and compares it with the International Reference Ionosphere (IRI) 2007 model with special emphasis on the solar minimum year of 2008. The results show that in local nighttime around 22 : 30 the global distribution of Ne by the DEMETER satellite exhibited similar behavior as that by IRI model, but Ne is overestimated above 100 % by the IRI in equatorial and beyond geomagnetic latitudes of 50 °, while underestimated by - 70 % at 20 ° - 40 ° in the north or south hemisphere during different seasons. In local daytime around 10 : 30, Ne values are mostly overestimated by the IRI model especially in the equatorial area where double crests were exhibited clearly at ± 10 ° in the IRI-NeQuick model, but only one crest around 0 ° - 10 °N shown by DEMETER. Combined with other satellite data double crests of Ne over the equatorial area may gradually evolve into a single peak near LT 10 : 30 at 600 km height. The DEMETER comparison with three options in IRI 2007 revealed that only the IRI- 2001 option gave a single crest as with DEMETER, and three IRI options all largely overestimated the <b>crest</b> Ne <b>values</b> from DEMETER in local daytime. The results in this paper provide new information for improving the IRI model in the future, helping to understand the ionosphere and upper atmosphere physics, with applications in communications, navigation and spacecraft orbit determination...|$|R
40|$|The {{most common}} types of weirs are the broad-crested weir, the sharp-crested weir, the {{circular}} crested weir and the ogee crested weir. Advantages of the cylindrical weir shape include the stable overflow pattern, the ease to pass floating debris, {{the simplicity of}} design compared to ogee crest design and the associated lower costs. In present study, it was investigated the overflow characteristics of circular weirs in laboratory for various cylinder radii of three sizes (11. 4, 9. 0, 6. 3 cm), and the models fixed on the channel bed vertically to the direction of flow. The result shows {{that the increase in}} the ratio of head to weir radius ratio (H w /R) value causes an increase in discharge coefficient (C d) value for the same height of weir. It was observed that the cylinder size (i. e. radius of cylindrical weir (R)) has an effect on the (C d). The flow magnification factor (q w /q s) increases with an increase in (H w /R) value and values of (q w /q s) were always higher than one for all values of (H w /R), this means that weirs of cylindrical shape performed better than those of sharp <b>crest</b> for any <b>value</b> of weir radius tested in this study. </p...|$|R
50|$|Computer {{modeling}} of a well-preserved specimen of P. tubicen, with more complex air passages {{than those of}} P. walkeri, has allowed {{the reconstruction of the}} possible sound its crest produced. The main path resonates at around 30 Hz, but the complicated sinus anatomy causes peaks and valleys in the sound.The other main behavioural theory is that the crest was used for intra-species recognition. This means that the crest could have been used for species recognition, as a warning signal, and for other, non-sexual uses.

40|$|Field {{measurements}} of wave overtopping over a rubble mound breakwater {{have been carried}} out at Zeebrugge, Belgium, during the period 1999 - 2003. The overtopping volumes of water are collected in an overtopping tank located on the breakwater crest behind the access road. A short side of the tank is made of a weir, allowing the collected water to flow out continuously, and allowing measurements to be made for long duration. Calculation of the inflow discharge is based on the outflow discharge over the weir and the volume in the tank. This calculation requires an accurate measurement of the water depth inside the tank. The water depth is measured indirectly using a pressure sensor near the bottom. The measurement setup for wave overtopping at the breakwater is described in detail. Eight-wave records with wave propagation normal to the breakwater have been used in the analysis of the field data. Wave heights range between 2. 6 and 3. 9 in (i. e., up to 63 % of the design wave height) for wave records with a typical duration of 1 - 2 h. The measured average overtopping rate q has been determined for all records using three methods (q< 1 l/s m). Average overtopping rates from the field data have been compared with predicted values from prediction formulae by van der Meer et al. [van der Meer, J. W., Tonjes, P., de Waal, H., 1998. A code for dike height design and examination. In: Proceedings International Conference on Coastlines, Structures and Breakwaters. Institution of Civil Engineers, London, Thomas Telford, London, pp. 5 - 19], Owen [Owen, M. W., 1980. Design of seawalls allowing for wave overtopping. Hydraulics Research, Wallingford, Report No. EX 924, UK], and Besley [Besley, P., 1999. Wave overtopping of Seawalls. Design and Assessment Manual. Hydraulics Research Wallingford. R&D Technical Report W 178, ISBN 1 85705 069 X]. Three <b>crest</b> freeboard <b>values</b> have been used in the analysis. The calculated reduction factor for surface roughness used in the formulae is 0. 51. Best agreement is observed for van der Meer et al. 's and Owen modified by Besley's prediction formulae using the actual average crest level. In this case, measured average overtopping rates are within the 95 % confidence intervals of these prediction formulae...|$|R
