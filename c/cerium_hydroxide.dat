The protective role of Ce ions is attributed to the precipitation of <b>cerium</b> <b>hydroxides</b> and oxides in the cathodic areas of the passive film. Such species can block the cathodic sites hindering the cathodic reaction and consequently, the corrosion rate.|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} cerium-based {{corrosion}} inhibitors on the pH front between the alkaline cathode and acidic anode in corrosion cells has been studied. The cerium component of these inhibitors {{can affect the}} pH front since it precipitates in an alkaline environment as <b>cerium</b> <b>hydroxide,</b> which is important since the corrosion inhibition mechanism of the cerium component {{is a result of}} its deposition as a highly electrical resistive (passivation) layer on the cathode. It is studied whether the cerium can reach the cathode when fed into the corrosion cell from an external source after the onset of corrosion. To this end a simulation model was set up that includes the Poisson-Nernst-Planck theory to describe ion transport and the Frumkin-Butler-Volmer equation to describe charge transfer at the electrodes. In this model both the self-dissociation of water and the formation of <b>cerium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> are taken into account. To support our findings experimentally a corrosion cell consisting of an aluminum and copper electrode was used, in which the pH fronts were visualized using a pH-indicator. Two types of inhibitors were used; namely, highly soluble CeCl 3 and sparsely soluble cerium dibutylphosphate, Ce(dbp) 3. The results show that CeCl 3 can reduce the size of the alkaline region and reach the cathode to form a passivation layer, whereas the solubility in case of Ce(dbp) 3 is too low to supply sufficient amounts of trivalent cerium cations to penetrate the alkaline region. This behavior {{can be explained by the}} simulation results, which reveal a threshold for the corrosion inhibitor solubility below which no passivation of the cathode occurs. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|A rapid cure silane sol-gel coating {{containing}} encapsulated {{corrosion inhibitors}} {{that can be}} applied to a mild steel substrate to form a crack-free coating has been developed. The benefit of this system is that it appears to emulate the protection mechanism found with traditional chrome (VI) based systems, but without the environmental disadvantages, namely that it is non-toxic and non-carcinogenic. The high corrosion resistance performance of this coating is derived from the combination of the hydrophobic nature of the sol-gel coating and the presence of the encapsulated rare earth corrosion inhibitor which can be released at defects within the coating resulting in <b>cerium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> precipitation which hinders the reduction reaction at cathodic sites. The proposed mechanism for this protection is based upon an evaluation of the barrier properties of the coating using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and long-term immersion/salt spray tests.

Thermogravimetric analysis indicated also that the composition of the coating after the impregnation is given by the global formula CeO 23. 4 H 2 O, while XRD analysis revealed that ceria with cubic fluorite crystalline structure is finally produced. Different preparation conditions were studied in view to control the nanosize of the supported ceria crystallites. It appeared that the final heat treatment is the most efficient operational parameter for the tuning of the particle size, that it can be thus well controlled from 5 to 30 nm between 300 and 700 8 C...|$|E
40|$|Highly {{non-stoichiometric}} nanoceria was synthesized for {{the first}} time by thermal plasma from the precursor <b>cerium</b> carbonate <b>hydroxide.</b> The particle size was approximately 60 nm according to measurement by TEM. The nanoceria synthesized with 25 kW plasma power with argon as the carrier gas had the largest concentration of oxygen vacancies, follow by that produced with 20 kW with hydrogen as the carrier gas. XRD results indicated that the CeO 1. 66 phase was present with mostly non-stoichiometric ceria CeO 2 -x in these two products. SEM and TEM images showed that most of the particles were of irregular shape, while some triangular particles were also present. Raman spectra revealed that the F 2 g mode of synthesized nanoceria powders had a remarkable downshift of 7. 9 - 10. 5 cm- 1 relative to the peak for single crystal ceria located at 466. 0 cm- 1. The Raman downshift was explained by the increase in ionic radius upon Ce 4 + reduction to Ce 3 +. XPS results indicated that the Ce 3 + content {{on the surface of the}} synthesized nanoceria was in the range of 15 - 30 %, depending on the plasma power and carrier gas composition. Both the Raman and XPS spectra showed numerous oxygen vacancies in the nanoceria. The results of this work indicated that the oxygen vacancy formation occurred when the CeO 2 formed from the oxidation of <b>cerium</b> carbonate <b>hydroxide</b> was reduced by the hydrogen as well as the high temperature of the plasma. This investigation has verified that plasma treatment provides a promising method for the synthesis of nanoceria powder with high oxygen vacancies...|$|R

Although these alloys are less susceptible to stress corrosion cracking than conventional alloys, Al-Li-Cu-Mg alloy (8090 -T 8171) still experiences this problem in a NaCl + H 2 O 2 solution. In this work it has been demonstrated that the addition of 10, 000 ppm of CeCl 3 to the medium inhibits the stress corrosion cracking of 8090 alloy by precipitation of <b>cerium</b> oxides/ <b>hydroxides.</b> The deposition of these compounds on the alloy surface decreases the pit density and slows the crack growth through the grain boundaries by hindering the anodic dissolution of T phases. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|International audienceThe {{evolution}} of plutonium dioxide surface due to water adsorption seems to influence H- 2 generation through the radiolysis of adsorbed water. Surface {{evolution of}} ceria, a non-radioactive surrogate for plutonium dioxide, was investigated using Inverse Gas Chromatography (IGC), Raman spectroscopy, Environmental Scanning Electronic Microscopy (ESEM) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). IGC highlights {{the complexity of}} ceria surface revealing three different adsorption sites on surface and indicate a surface evolution upon hydration. Thermal treatment appears to regenerate at least partially the initial surface state before hydration. IGC points out the influence of calcination temperature of ceria precursor on surface reactivity. The nature of surface modification was investigated by Raman spectroscopy which suggests formation of superficial hydroxide layer. ESEM and AFM were used to study potential surface topology modification upon superficial layer formation. <b>Cerium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> forms as a superficial layer with a nanostructure differing from {{the one of the}} oxide.

40|$|Using precipitated <b>cerium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> dried at 100 degrees C as the support, highly {{dispersed}} ceria-supported catalyst was prepared. Compared with similarly prepared catalysts {{supported on}} low-surface area ceria, gold on the high-surface area {{support on the}} high-surface area support showed more resistance to sintering and was more active toward the oxidation of CO and benzene. The oxidation of benzene was very dependent {{on the structure of}} ceria. Temperature-programmed reduction showed that the reducibility of surface Oxygen was higher for high-surface area ceria. It is proposed that the creation of surface oxygen vacancies by ceria surface reduction promoted oxygen adsorption. Active oxygen formed by dissociation of the adsorbed oxygen is the active species for benzene oxidation, and the dissociation is promoted by gold nanoparticles. When present together in the reactant mixture, benzene inhibited the oxidation of CO, but CO enhanced file oxidation of benzene. Moisture had a promoting effect on both CO and benzene oxidation.

40|$|Zinc alloys with {{additions}} of Ti and Cu present excellent {{creep resistance}} and {{an improvement in}} strength and hardness compared with pure Zn. However, these elements cause a decrease in localised corrosion resistance due {{to the presence of}} TiZn 15 intermetallic particles. In the present work, the corrosion behaviour of the Zn- 0. 084 %Ti- 0. 18 %Cu alloy in a NaCl solution, with and without cerium salts, has been studied. Polarization curves recorded in the non-inhibited solution reveal a corrosion mechanism under cathodic control with a corrosion rate of about 1. 6 × 10 - 5 A/cm 2. Localized attack can be observed in the rolling direction after immersion in the electrolyte. A three-dimensional layer is formed on the surface when inhibitor is added to the electrolyte. This layer is due to the precipitation of insoluble <b>cerium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> on the cathodic areas, which correspond to TiZn 15 intermetallic particles.

From a synopsis of results we develop a self-consistent interpretation of contrast features that is cross-checked by a systematic variation of experimental conditions and a comparison to previously obtained results. The most common deviations from the regular {{structure of the}} stoichiometric surface are surface oxygen vacancies, water adsorbed on top of <b>cerium</b> ions and <b>hydroxide</b> substituting surface oxygen.

30|$|In {{order to}} combine the photogenerated {{cathodic}} protection performance and the self-protection of TiO 2 coating without the photo effect, it is highly required {{to find a new}} approach to improve the TiO 2 coating as an excellent protective coating for metals. Herein a sol–gel method is used to modify nano-TiO 2 coating with cerium ion by adding the concentrated solution of cerium nitrate. The cerium ion-doped TiO 2 coating is taken into consideration for two reasons; on one hand, the Ce-doped TiO 2 has widely been used as a photocatalyst to enhance the photocatalytic activity of TiO 2 in the visible region [20 – 22] because it yields a large red shift compared to pure TiO 2 and suppresses electron–hole recombination with electron trapping at Ce 4 +. We make use of this advantage in the field of photocatalysis to verify its improvement in the photogenerated cathodic protection for metals. On the other hand, cerium nitrate is known as a corrosion inhibitor in an aqueous aggressive medium. The corrosion inhibition properties of cerium nitrate have been widely discussed in literatures [23 – 25]. It is generally accepted that cerium ions lead to the precipitation of <b>cerium</b> oxides or <b>hydroxides</b> that suppress the corrosion reactions in the defects. Moreover, the incorporation of corrosion inhibitors into the sol–gel films can improve the protective ability of the coatings [26, 27]. We expect that the cerium ions doped in the TiO 2 coating can also enhance the self-protection property of the coating based on its self-healing effect without photo effect.|$|R
40|$|Reverse microemulsions {{consisting}} of aqueous cerium nitrate solution as the internal phase and polycarbosilane dissolved in heptane as the continuous phase {{were used as}} a precursor for the controlled synthesis of dispersed cerium oxide particles inside a porous SiC matrix. According to dynamic light scattering experiments, the effective diameter of the <b>cerium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> particles obtained after ammonia addition is effectively controlled {{in a range of}} 2 10 nm with the molar water/surfactant ratio (Rw) 6 16). Pyrolysis at 1200 to 1500 °C produces materials with specific surface areas up to 240 m 2 g- 1. Whereas crystallization of the matrix is achieved only at higher temperature, cerium oxide particles form agglomerates composed of smaller nanoparticles that tend to dissolve into the ceramic matrix at 1500 °C leaving macropores behind. The high specific surface area is attributed to the presence of mesopores with a broad size distribution. Excess carbon present after pyrolysis is removed by oxidation at 900 °C causing a significant decrease of the surface area for high surface area materials, whereas intermediate surface area materials (50 - 100 m 2 g- 1) show a high textural stability...|$|E
40|$|In this work, we {{prepared}} a novel structure comprising of raspberry-like CeO 2 deposited on CuO microspheres (Ce-CuO) for Rochow reaction. The synthesis {{was carried out}} via a facile one-pot hydrothermal reaction without using any template, in which, the basic copper carbonate microspheres were first formed via self-assembly of basic copper carbonate nanorods, followed with deposition of <b>cerium</b> <b>hydroxide.</b> After calcination, they were transformed into Ce-CuO but still maintained the hierarchical structure, and meanwhile, mesoporous structure was formed (for simplicity, we will only state them as metal oxide in the following context). The samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) techniques. When used as a Cu-based catalyst, Ce-CuO exhibited superior catalytic property to the single CuO, CeO 2 and their physically mixture in the Rochow reaction with dimethyldichlorosilane (M 2) selectivity increased from ca. 65 to 83. 7 %. The higher M 2 selectivity of Ce-CuO is mainly due to its larger surface area and the synergistic effect between CuO and CeO 2. This work demonstrates that catalytic performance of the Cu-based can be improved by adding Ce rare-earth element and by carefully controlling their structures.

30|$|In summary, coprecipitation of {{cerium salt}} {{solution}} with ammonia {{is an excellent}} method for producing nanocrystalline ceria particles. Both ammonium cerium(IV) nitrate and cerium(III) nitrate hexahydrate yield nanoparticles with size {{in the range of}} 4 – 37  nm. Calcination temperature plays a vital role in the crystallinity of nanoceria particles and calcination temperature of 700  °C produces highly crystalline particles. Increase in synthetic temperature and molar concentrations of the initial precursors increases the aggregate size of the particles. As concentration of the initial precursor solution increases from 0.1 to 0.3  M, average particle size increases to the range of 14.0 – 20.4  nm. A similar effect was observed with an increase in the temperature of precipitation. As temperature changes from ambient to 70  °C, average crystallite size varies from 6.7 – 9.9 to 13.4 – 15.1  nm. Aging of precipitated <b>cerium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> increases the average particle size slightly. Sol–gel process using ethylene glycol solvent results in ceria nanoparticles with higher average particle size of 27.9 – 36.9  nm. At lower calcination temperature, lattice parameter has values ranging from 5.41 to 5.44  Å, but at higher temperature, it is constant at 5.39  Å. TG analysis reveals that these oxides are thermally stable from 400 to 873  °C in chemical composition as well as in crystalline phase. From the SEM image, it can be observed that the microstructure of the ceria crystallites which seem to aggregate to form secondary particles on the surface. Lattice strain analysis using Williamson–Hall analysis indicates that particles with sizes below 10  nm show characteristic strain.|$|E
40|$|The overall aim of {{this work}} is to design an {{alternative}} metal pre-treatment with improved corrosion resistance and low environmental impact. Hybrid silane pre-treatments with nano-additives and corrosion inhibitors as fillers for corrosion protection of low carbon steels using sol-gel processing technique were developed. Multifunctional silane molecules used to design the hybrid silane films were based on cross-condensation between an epoxy-silane, 3 -glycidoxy-propyl-trimethoxy-silane (GPTMS) and methyl-triethoxy-silane (MTES) in acid catalysis condition. The silane films thus developed on low carbon steel surface also showed good adhesion, verified by Fourier Transform Infra-red Spectroscopy (FTIR). The corrosion resistance of the silane films modified with impregnation of corrosion inhibitors (i. e. rare earth salts) and/or silica nanoparticles was evaluated by electrochemical measurements using potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The corrosion studies were complimented by investigation of surface topography and wetting properties using scanning electron microscopy coupled with {{energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy}} (SEM-EDX) and contact angle measurements, respectively. This work aided the identification of the synergistic effects of both additives in efficient retardation of corrosion kinetics of the low carbon steel. The direct addition of active lanthanum triflate species, was found to have detrimental effects effect on corrosion resistance of the steel. The investigation also included cerium and yttrium triflates, for activation of silica nanoparticles within hybrid silane network for corrosion protection of low carbon steel. The electrochemical investigations elucidate the superior corrosion resistance of cerium activated systems on low carbon steel, as compared to lanthanum and yttrium triflates. It is proposed that the cerium triflates within the silane films on coated steels, forms <b>cerium</b> oxides or <b>hydroxides</b> on cathodic and anodic regions as a result of increase in pH during corrosion, thus hindering further progression of the corrosion onset. Optimum concentration of the cerium activated systems for the best corrosion resistance of low carbon steel was also established in this study...|$|R
40|$|Cerium oxide (ceria, CeO 2 -x where x is 0 to 0. 5) {{has been}} one of the most widely used {{heterogeneous}} catalysts particularly in three way catalytic converters. Most of the catalytic traits can be attributed to two properties of ceria: first, the high mobility and storage capacity of oxygen within the lattice; second, the ease with which cerium changes between Ce 3 + and Ce 4 + states. These properties, combined with the abundance of cerium on earth, make ceria a low-cost highly effective alternative to noble metal catalysts. Recent research has been focused on the nanoscale properties of ceria. The effect on the catalytic activity of cerium oxide caused by varying the density of oxygen vacancy defects (OVD) has not been previously studied experimentally. This is due to the perceived inability to engineer stable defects not attributed to the presence of dopant atoms. It was found that the number of stable OVDs on cerium oxide nanoparticles and nanotubes can be increased with annealing at elevated temperatures under low pressure. The oxidative catalytic activity of these nanostructured catalysts was evaluated. Samples with higher densities of OVD were found to have much lower light-off temperatures when compared to that of their bulk counterpart. The chemical equilibrium reactions on the catalysts surface under low pressure were hypothesized to explain the unusual increase in the OVD density of the reported cerium oxide nanostructured catalysts. Cerium oxide is well known to exfoliate from the surface of cerium metal in the same way that rust exfoliates from iron or steel. A two-step process to fabricate nanoporous ceria membranes via anodization and subsequent calcinations is reported. These membranes have the potential to be used in solid oxide fuel cells and solid-state oxygen sensors. Cerium metal foil was first anodized into adherent porous <b>cerium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> film, followed by calcination for conversion into ceria membranes. These membranes are composed of ribbon-like structures that form the backbone of the porous framework. A proposed anodization model for the growth of the nanoribbons is discussed.
