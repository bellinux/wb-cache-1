Coagulation flocculation is effective for removing high concentration organic pollutants and heavy metals in water and wastewater. However, limited information exists on the efficiency of this coagulation-flocculation process for biodiesel wastewater treatment. The biodiesel wastewater is basic (alkaline), with a high content of oil and grease, and a low content of nitrogen and phosphorus. As such, biological treatment of the biodiesel wastewater is expected to be very difficult. For this reason supportive physic-chemical methods are often used. Although one of the most frequently employed method is coagulation. Therefore, this study was conducted to investigate the efficiency of coagulation and flocculation processes for removing suspended solid (SS), <b>color,</b> <b>COD</b> and oil and grease from biodiesel wastewater. Aluminum sulfate, polyaluminum chloride, ferric chloride and ferric sulfate as a coagulant in biodiesel wastewater treatment were studied using a standard jar test apparatus.

An attempt {{has been made}} {{for the first time}} in Pakistan, to generate an effective and economically sound treatment facility for the toxic effluent of a dyes manufacturing plant. This is an indigenous bed which could replace expensive treatment facilities, such as reverse osmosis (RO), granulated activated carbon (GAC) bed, etc. The treatment efficiency was improved by coupling coagulants with fly ash adsorbent bed. The ash was collected from coal fired boilers of power plant at Lakhra Power Generation Company, Jamshoro, Pakistan. The use of this ash resolved the disposal and environmental issues by treating wastewater of chemical, dyes and pigment industry. The treatment bed comprised of briquettes of coal fly ash coupled with commercial coagulant ferrous sulfate-lime reduced <b>COD,</b> <b>color,</b> turbidity and TSS of effluent remarkably. An adsorption capacity and chemical behavior of fly ash bed was also studied. In coagulation treatment, coagulant FeSO 4 -lime influenced reduction of <b>COD,</b> <b>color,</b> turbidity and TSS by 32 %, 48 %, 50 % and 51 %, respectively. The CFAB coupled with coagulant, resulted an excessive removal of <b>color,</b> TSS, <b>COD,</b> and turbidity by 88 %, 92 %, 67 % and 89 %, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Activated carbon is {{commonly}} used in water and wastewater treatment, removing organics that cause unpleasant odors, tastes and other detrimental effects. In this study, bioremediation treatment consists of biofilms of two types of microbes, i. e. Bacillus sp and Escherichia sp are grown and immobilized on the Mukah coal activated carbon from Sarawak. Prepared activated carbon was categorized by different physical geometries design such as SGAC I, SGAC II, SGAC III, HCGAC I, HCGAC II and HCGAC III. The target pollutants {{to be removed from}} the Ramatex textile wastewater were BOD 5, <b>COD,</b> TSS, <b>color,</b> phosphate, nitrate and sulfate. Escherichia sp with SGAC I was found to give the best results for the bioremediation process and the percentage of BOD 5, <b>color,</b> <b>COD,</b> TSS, nitrate, sulfate and phosphate removal were 71. 4 %, 91. 1 %, 96. 4 %, 98. 8 %, 80. 3 %, 90. 3 % and 60. 3 % respectively. The results indicated that combination between physical and biological treatment was the main factor for the best pollutants removal achievement...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the {{application}} of Iron(II) sulfate and hydrogen peroxide oxidation processes for stabilized landfill leachate treatment was investigated. The leachate came from a municipal sanitary landfill and the average values of its main parameters were: pH 7, 95; COD 840 gO 2 /m 3; BOD 60 gO 2 /m 3; NH 4 + 110 gN/m 3; conductivity 6, 05 mS/cm; UV 254 absorbance 0, 32 and turbidity 1, 3 NTU. It is demonstrated that {{the application}} of Iron(II) sulfate and hydrogen peroxide can effectively remove leachate pollutants such as <b>color,</b> <b>COD</b> and UV 254 absorbance. A combination process, accomplished at different weight ratios of reagents H 2 O 2 /Fe was 1, 6 to 32, 4. The best conditions for process were found at a ratio Fe/COD equal to 0, 71 and H 2 O 2 /Fe equal to 5, 4. Leachates were significantly oxidized under these conditions in terms of COD removal 74, 1 %, color removal 94, 5 % and UV 254 absorbance removal 88 %...|$|R
40|$|The ligninolytic fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium {{was used}} to treat the pulp and paper-mill effluent. It was {{pelletized}} and used for batch and continuous experiments in a two-litre fluidized bed bioreactor. The continuous experiment was initiated with concentrated effluent without any extra carbon source and the average removal of color was 3. 8 %. Then, it was fed with 50 % diluted effluent which was enriched with glucose. At first, the glucose was consumed by the fungus, which is indicated by a COD removal of 38. 5 % and a 26. 5 % removal of color.
