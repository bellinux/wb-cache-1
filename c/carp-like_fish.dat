5000|$|In 1932, W. Fleischmann and S. Kann {{reported}} in a German gestational physiology journal that female bitterings, small <b>carp-like</b> <b>fish,</b> [...] "...show an enlargement of the ovipositor following injection of an estrogenic preparation...".|$|E
5000|$|Live fish {{need to be}} quarantined first, so {{they are}} safe to feed (containing no {{diseases}} or parasites). Goldfish, minnows {{and other members of}} the Cyprinid family (<b>Carp-like</b> <b>fish)</b> should be avoided, as these fish contain growth-inhibiting hormones (Thaiminase/Vitamine B1 inhibitors) that could negatively affect the piranha's health and development.|$|E
50|$|It {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} aquacultured freshwater species in South Asia.It is grown in polyculture ponds with other <b>carp-like</b> <b>fishes,</b> particularly with the roho labeo and mrigal carp. The reported production numbers have increased sharply during the 2000s, and were in 2012 about 2.8 million tonnes per year.|$|R
50|$|Barbels are {{group of}} small <b>carp-like</b> {{freshwater}} <b>fish,</b> {{almost all of}} the genus Barbus. They are usually found in gravel and rocky-bottomed slow-flowing waters with high dissolved oxygen content. A typical adult barbel will range from 25 to 100 cm in length and weight anywhere between 200 g and 10 kg, although weights of 200 g are more common. Babies weigh 100-150 g.|$|R
40|$|Danionella dracula is a {{new species}} of sexually dimorphic, {{miniature}} and highly developmentally truncated cyprinid fish. Compared with its close relative, the zebrafish Danio rerio, it lacks 44 bones or parts thereof and {{represents one of the}} most developmentally truncated vertebrates. Absence of the majority of bones appears to be due to developmental truncation via terminal deletion. In contrast to these larval-like features, D. dracula also shows several hyperossifications. Uniquely, among <b>carp-like</b> <b>fishes,</b> male D. dracula have a series of long, pointed odontoid processes on the jaws greatly resembling the jaw dentition of teleosts with true teeth. The anterior-most process in each jaw is extended as a canine-like fang projecting through the epithelium. True jaw teeth are absent from all 3700 species of cypriniforms and were lost at least in the Upper Eocene. It remains to be investigated, however, whether the conserved pathways to regulate tooth development in cypriniforms have been used in D. dracula to form and pattern the odontoid processes. This new species represents a remarkable example linking progenetic paedomorphosis via heterochronic change in developmental timing to the evolution of morphological novelties...|$|R
