5|$|All YouTube {{users can}} upload videos up to 15 minutes each in duration. Users {{who have a}} good track record of {{complying}} with the site's <b>Community</b> <b>Guidelines</b> may be offered the ability to upload videos up to 12 hours in length, as well as live streams, which requires verifying the account, normally through a mobile phone. When YouTube was launched in 2005, {{it was possible to}} upload longer videos, but a ten-minute limit was introduced in March 2006 after YouTube found that the majority of videos exceeding this length were unauthorized uploads of television shows and films. The 10-minute limit was increased to 15 minutes in July 2010. In the past, it was possible to upload videos longer than 12 hours. Videos can be at most 128 GB in size. Video captions are made using speech recognition technology when uploaded. Such captioning is usually not perfectly accurate, so YouTube provides several options for manually entering the captions for greater accuracy.|$|E

Sims may incorporate rules that have less to do with thematic realism, and more to do with adhering to <b>community</b> <b>guidelines.</b> For instance, one rule that is commonly seen is the prohibition or restriction of underage avatars in role-playing sims that feature sexual content; these rules are separate from Linden Labs' sim restrictions, as they restrict underage characters played by adult players.|$|E

To enable competitive bidding on an equal basis, Caledonian MacBrayne was split into two separate companies on 1 October 2006. Caledonian Maritime Assets Limited (CMAL) retained ownership of CalMac vessels and infrastructure, including harbours, while CalMac Ferries Ltd submitted tenders to be the ferry operator. Their bid for the main bundle, Clyde and Hebrides Ferry Services, succeeded and on 1 October 2007 CalMac Ferries Ltd began operating these services on a six-year contract. The Gourock to Dunoon service {{was the subject of a}} separate tender, but no formal bids were made. In an interim arrangement CalMac Ferries Ltd continued to provide a subsidised service on this route, until 29 June 2011, when Argyll Ferries took over the service.|$|E

40|$|This paper opens by {{summarising}} {{the case}} for student-directed learning in online higher education {{as a means of}} bringing about the development and use of higher-level cognitive and interpersonal abilities such as critical and creative thinking. The writers refine their conceptualisations of student-direction, different to, but flowing from student-centred learning, by scrutinising a progressive series of face-to-face examples offering some autonomy in learning. Nine features are identified as essential in a student-directed programme. They review Garrison’s recent account of learning-centred Communities of Inquiry (CoI), identifying aspects of the teacher/instructor’s role that would need to be altered for student-directed online <b>communities.</b> <b>Guidelines</b> are suggested for creating a student-directed CoI including programme design addressing the development, and use, of generic abilities.

40|$|The {{response}} of Escherichia coli and total coliform concentration {{to increases in}} river discharge was investigated. Artificial hydrographs were generated on eight occasions between 21 October 1979 and 3 March 1981 by releasing water from Thruscross Reservoir in North Yorkshire into Fewston Reservoir. The majority of the releases were made after rainless periods to isolate the effects of stream channel entrainment from those induced by rainfall on the land surface. In the absence of rainfall, bacterial concentrations are shown to increase more than 10 -fold in response to stage increases. It is suggested that two stores of bacteria must exist on the catchment, the first being a land store and the second a channel or near-channel store. Movement from the land to the channel store must relate to hill slope hydrological processes, whereas movement between stores in the channel fluvial system may be closely allied to sedimentary processes. Some consideration is given to bacterial levels in relation to European Economic <b>Communities</b> <b>guidelines</b> for contact recreation...|$|R
