5|$|An Admiralty {{memorandum}} set out {{the detailed}} instructions. The first requirement was to resolve disagreements in the earlier surveys about the longitude of Rio de Janeiro, which was essential as the base point for meridian distances. The accurate marine chronometers needed to determine longitude had only become affordable since 1800; the Beagle carried 22 chronometers to allow corrections. The ship was to stop at specified points for four-day rating of the chronometers and to <b>check</b> <b>them</b> by astronomical observations: it was essential to take observations at Porto Praya and Fernando de Noronha to calibrate against the previous surveys of Owen and Foster. It was important to survey {{the extent of the}} Abrolhos Archipelago reefs, shown incorrectly in Roussin's survey, then proceed to Rio de Janeiro to decide the exact longitude of Villegagnon Island.|$|E
25|$|In Ado-Ekiti, {{the title}} of Ewi as a {{metropolitan}} sovereign is hereditary and alternatively contested {{by members of the}} two prominent ruling houses that had gained traditional preeminence within the royal household during period under review, whenever the stool of Ewi became vacant. Heads of subordinate towns in old Ado-Ekiti Kingdom may not be regarded as Baale (High Chiefs) as commonly seen in Yoruba communities of the Ibadan and Oyo country. Rather they were Traditional Rulers (Oba Ilu), though of lower status to the King-Emperor (Oba Alayeluwa or Oba lori Agbegbe) who resides in the main town, a position occupied by the Ewi of Ado-Ekiti in the 19th century. In the circumstances where subjected towns and their rebellion-prone rulers were faraway or near but troublesome by striving for autonomy or independence from Ewi’s influence as identified in case of the Alawe, the Olosi, the Olode, the Onijan and the Onimesi; rulers of other subordinate towns and Ewi’s chieftains were constantly on hand to <b>check</b> <b>them</b> against crisis that could create chaos or attract foreign invasions.|$|E
500|$|A report {{published}} in the newspaper Pakistan Observer claimed that some military and defence observers at Islamabad believed NATO was playing a double game and was in league with the Tehrik-i-Taliban; according to the report, there was a theory being circulated which suggested that the attack carried out by NATO came just when some Tehrik-i-Taliban (TTP) militants from Afghanistan who had entered the region had been completely encircled by Pakistani forces and {{were about to be}} eliminated [...] "within the next few hours". These check posts were there to <b>check</b> <b>them</b> and prevent from crossing the border into Pakistan. Pakistani monitors and experts on Afghanistan believed that at least two Afghan military officials deployed on the border, Brigadier General Aminullah Amarkhel and Colonel Numan Hatifi (of the 201st Silab Corps), have anti-Pakistan sentiments and links to anti-Pakistani elements.|$|E

500|$|After {{the more}} {{produced}} Rings Around the World, which {{relied heavily on}} computers and electronics, the group were keen to make Phantom Power [...] "a little more human" [...] with guitarist Huw Bunford stating: [...] "with technology {{you can do anything}} these days, but sometimes less is more". Many songs on the album are acoustic based and bass player Guto Pryce has claimed that they sounded [...] "pretty good right from the start" [...] which also contributed to the decision to avoid [...] "over-tweak them in the studio". Despite this the group did work electronic loops into several tracks after Ciaran bought a large number of [...] "sound effect and light music" [...] vinyl records from a man who worked in the same building. According to Rhys: [...] "he knocked on the door just as we were beginning the album: [...] "hey, I've got these records to sell, are ya interested?" [...] And Cian went down to <b>check</b> <b>them</b> out and gave him a hundred pounds on the spot and carried 700 albums back to our tiny room".|$|E

2500|$|At 4:30am, Allenby's {{main attack}} by XXI Corps opened. A barrage by 385 guns (the field {{artillery}} of five divisions, five batteries of 60-pounder guns, thirteen siege batteries of medium howitzers and seven batteries of the Royal Horse Artillery), 60 trench mortars and two destroyers {{off the coast}} fell on the Ottoman 7th and 20th Divisions' front-line positions defending Nahr el Faliq. As the opening bombardment turned to a [...] "lifting" [...] barrage at 4:50am, the British and Indian infantry advanced and quickly broke through the Ottoman lines. Within hours, the Desert Mounted Corps were moving north along the coast, with no Ottoman reserves available to <b>check</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{group had}} a gig at the Melbourne Push Over concert in 1996. Paul Kosky, a Melbourne-based engineer-producer, {{who had worked with}} Crowded House, Rage Against the Machine, Kate Ceberano, and The Clouds, was looking for a new band to manage and record. Kosky had heard [...] "Kettle" [...] on the radio and decided to <b>check</b> <b>them</b> out at Push Over. In March 2000 Kosky {{recalled}} that their rhythm section were musically weak, although the siblings showed [...] "a raw talent I knew could be turned into a global appeal." [...] The group signed to his management company in 1997 and his new recording label, Wah Wah Music (established with US-based investor, Chris Robinson) in the following year. Kosky helped develop the band for two years and, as their manager, arranged a distribution deal with Roadshow Music (which also had a contract with Savage Garden) for his own label.|$|E
2500|$|In {{that city}} in October 1936, the band had a {{recording}} session which the producer John Hammond later described as [...] "the only perfect, completely perfect recording session I've ever {{had anything to}} do with". Hammond had heard Basie's band by radio and went to Kansas City to <b>check</b> <b>them</b> out. He invited them to record, in performances which were Lester Young's earliest recordings. [...] Those four sides were released on Vocalion Records under the band name of Jones-Smith Incorporated; the sides were [...] "Shoe Shine Boy", [...] "Evening", [...] "Boogie Woogie", and [...] "Lady Be Good". [...] After Vocalion became a subsidiary of Columbia Records in 1938, [...] "Boogie Woogie" [...] was released in 1941 as part of a four-record compilation album entitled Boogie Woogie (Columbia album C44). [...] When he made the Vocalion recordings, Basie had already signed with Decca Records, but did not have his first recording session with them until January 1937.|$|E

2500|$|The {{sections}} build {{with more}} guitar layers, each complementary to the intro, with the drums entering at 4:18. [...] The extended Jimmy Page guitar solo in the song's final section was {{played for the}} recording on a 1959 Fender Telecaster {{given to him by}} Jeff Beck (an instrument he used extensively with the Yardbirds) plugged into a Supro amplifier, although in an interview he gave to Guitar World magazine, Page also claimed, [...] "It could have been a Marshall, but I can't remember". Three different improvised solos were recorded, with Page agonising about deciding which to keep. Page later revealed, [...] "I did have the first phrase worked out, {{and then there was the}} link phrase. I did <b>check</b> <b>them</b> out beforehand before the tape ran." [...] The other guitar parts were played using a Harmony Sovereign H1260 acoustic guitar and a Fender Electric XII guitar (a 12-string guitar that was plugged directly to the soundboard); these can be heard on the left and right recording channels respectively. For live versions, Page switched to a Heritage Cherry Gibson EDS-1275 6/12 Doubleneck guitar. The final progression is a i-VII-VI (natural minor) progression (Am-G-F), a mainstay of rock music.|$|E
