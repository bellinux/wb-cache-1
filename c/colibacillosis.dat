40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine whether {{susceptibility}} to <b>colibacillosis</b> differs between four meat-type chicken lines, indicating genetic variation in susceptibility. This was achieved by a placebo-controlled E. coli challenge experiment and subsequent comparison of mortality rate, <b>colibacillosis</b> lesions and growth retardation.

40|$|<b>Colibacillosis</b> {{is caused}} by E. coli {{bacteria}} and occurs predominantly in broilers {{in the second half}} of the growing period. The disease is of economic importance worldwide due to growth retardation, increased feed conversion, mortality and high condemnation rate at slaughter. Moreover, <b>colibacillosis</b> results in impaired welfare. Infections of the respiratory tract, amongst others infection with infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), increase the susceptibility for <b>colibacillosis</b> of broilers significantly. From recently made field observations it was hypothesised that not only virulent IBV but also live IBV vaccine strains, which are commonly used in the field to prevent birds from clinical signs of infectious bronchitis (IB), are able to increase <b>colibacillosis</b> susceptibility in broilers substantially. This hypothesis was tested experimentally. The experiments showed that IBV vaccines H 120 and H 52 increased <b>colibacillosis</b> susceptibility in four-weeks-old broilers to the same level as virulent IBV strains (M 41 and D 387) did. It was also demonstrated that the IBV H 120 vaccine spread extensively between broilers. From the latter data it seems obvious that IBV H 120 vaccine also might spread between flocks. In case not IB vaccinated flocks are infected with IB vaccine virus by that route, especially {{in the second half of}} the growing period, serious <b>colibacillosis</b> might occur. The significance of IBV vaccine strains in the occurrence of <b>colibacillosis</b> in broilers in the field has to be elucidated. The underlying mechanism of E. coli superinfections (E. coli infection after triggering by a previous viral infection) in IBV infected broilers was studied based on morphological and functional immunology. The results strongly suggest that preceding infection with vaccine or virulent IBV does not seem to impair the clearance of the E. coli in the respiratory tract of broilers, but rather induces an exaggerated inflammatory response. It also seems that infection with virulent or vaccine strains of IBV altered the innate systemical immunity rather than the phagocytic cell function...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{aimed to}} evaluate broiler susceptibility to <b>colibacillosis</b> {{and the potential}} of genetic selection to reduce broiler susceptibility to <b>colibacillosis.</b> A challenge experiment with E. coli at 7 days of age was carried out on eight broiler genotypes: five pure broiler lines, a slow­growing line, and two 2 ­way crosses of the pure­lines. Based on {{the results from this}} experiment, a sensible definition of the susceptibility to <b>colibacillosis</b> was defined, and the indication of genetic variation in the susceptibility was found, suggesting that selection for reduced susceptibility is possible. Maternal antibodies did not have an effect on susceptibility, but there were indications of genetic variation in the changes in thyroid hormones in response to challenge {{as well as in the}} antibody response to challenge. Difficulties in evaluating immunological variables hinder attempts to improve animal health through selection on immunological variables. A model was developed that describes immunocompetence development as well as kinetics of immunoresponsiveness to a pathogenic challenge in an individual chick. This model provides a useful tool in the definition of appropriate challenge and measurement strategies when evaluating immunocompetence and immunoresponsiveness. The model was expanded into a stochastic model that describes a population of individual chicks with variation among them as well as stochastic variation within individuals across age. The model predicts that heteroscedasticity in variance across age decreases with increasing challenge age, and that minimum probability to detect a given difference in immunocompetence or responsiveness at another age than the selection age increases with increasing selection age. Therefore, a high challenge age, at which maternal immunity no longer has influence, is preferable. Selection against susceptibility to <b>colibacillosis</b> should aim at reducing the incidence of <b>colibacillosis</b> at commercial broiler level and be based on a combination of information on indicator and clinical traits. Because the economic importance of bacterial diseases as a whole is much higher than that of <b>colibacillosis</b> alone, changing the breeding goal to reducing the incidence of bacterial diseases as a whole is sensible...|$|E

40|$|Among {{bacterial}} infections, <b>colibacillosis</b> is {{a worldwide}} {{major cause of}} morbidity and mortality in poultry and responsible for significant economic losses to the poultry industry. Stordeur and Mainil (1) reported that the causative bacteria, avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC), induce various syndromes including respiratory tract infection (airsacculitis), acute colisepticemia, salpingitis, and cellulitis. The most common form of <b>colibacillosis</b> occurs in 3 - to 10 -week-old chickens. It is characterized by an initial respiratory infection usually induced by mycoplasmal and/or viral infections and enhanced by a high level of ammoniac in poultry houses. The disease evolves as a systemic infection (perihepatitis, pericarditis, and septicaemia) due to the invasive abilities of the Escherichia coli strains (2) ...|$|E
40|$|Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) {{attach to}} host enterocytes {{through the use}} of colonizing factor antigens, also known as pili. Different strains of ETEC can have 1 or more {{different}} types of pili, but the predominant colonizing factor antigen found on E. coli isolated from cattle contain the F 5 antigen known as K 99. The K 99 pilus recognizes a GM 3 glycoprotein that is found on newborn bovine enterocytes and equine erythrocytes. After the bacteria has attached to the enterocyte, enterotoxins are released that lead to <b>colibacillosis.</b> Blocking the interaction between the pili and host receptor will inhibit <b>colibacillosis.</b> By understanding how K 99 interacts with the GM 3 receptor, the treatments to reduce <b>colibacillosis</b> in neonatal cattle can be improved. K 99 pili was grown and harvested from E. coli strain B 41 (O 101 :K-:K 99). The isolated pili were treated under different denaturing conditions and the protein activity was analyzed by hemagglutination assay. We confirmed that the entire K 99 subunit must be maintained in its native conformation to retain hemagglutination activity. Any loss of 3 D conformation or truncation of the K 99 subunit destroys agglutination activity...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Bacteriophages are {{viruses that}} infect and kill bacteria. Bacteriophage do not infect {{animal and plant}} cells, which makes them a {{potentially}} safe alternative to antibiotics. We have been conducting research on the efficacy of bacteriophage to prevent and treat colibac-illosis in poultry. Bacteriophages that were lytic to a non-motile, serotype O 2 isolate of Escherichia coli were isolated from municipal wastewater treatment plants and poultry processing plants. This E. coli isolate is pathogenic to poultry, causing severe respiratory and systemic infec-tions. Two bacteriophage isolates were selected for use in studies designed to determine the efficacy of these bacteriophage to prevent and treat severe <b>colibacillosis</b> in poultry. <b>Colibacillosis</b> was induced by injecting 6 × 104 cfu of E. coli into the thoracic air sac when birds were...|$|E
