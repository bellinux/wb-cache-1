25|$|The English Springer Spaniel has {{a typical}} {{lifespan}} of 10.5 to 15 years. As in most breeds, {{there are some}} health problems that {{are more likely to}} occur. Hip dysplasia and progressive retinal atrophy (PRA) (a degeneration of the retina causing vision loss leading to blindness) are two such diseases for which veterinarians are working on genetic markers to determine carriers. Another problem can be elbow dysplasia. Retinal dysplasia (RD), which <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> <b>blindness</b> and Phosphofructokinase deficiency (PFK), which is genetic deficiency which impairs the ability of cells using carbohydrates for energy are two other hereditary conditions for which both lines of the English springer spaniel should be screened prior to breeding. Health issues are usually similar in both types of English Springer however phosphofructokinase deficiency in particular can appear more in field lines, however carriers in show lines have been identified.|$|E
500|$|The 15th-century {{engineer}} Taccola recommended quicklime, [...] {{although its}} use {{went back to}} ancient times, and {{might well have been}} a component of Greek fire. Quicklime reacts violently with water, and <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> <b>blindness</b> and burns. [...] While quicklime was used in some naval battles, it {{does not appear to have}} been standard issue on board ships, due to the danger of the quicklime blowing back and burning the user.|$|E
2500|$|A {{common problem}} is a painful eye {{condition}}, entropion, in which the eyelashes curl inward, irritating the eye. Untreated, it <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> <b>blindness.</b> This condition can be fixed by surgery ("tacking" [...] the eyelids up so they will not roll onto the eyeball for puppies or surgically removing extra skin in adolescent and older Shar Pei). In Australia, more than 8 in 10 Shar Peis require surgery to correct eye problems, contributing to them being the most expensive breed to insure.|$|E

2500|$|The {{herpes simplex}} virus can cause microcephaly, microphthalmus (abnormally small eyeballs), retinal {{dysplasia}}, hepatosplenomegaly, and mental retardation. [...] Both microphthalmus and retinal dysplasia <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> <b>blindness.</b> [...] However, the most common symptom in infants is an inflammatory response that develops {{during the first three}} weeks of life. [...] Hyperthermia causes anencephaly, which is when part of the brain and skull are absent in the infant. [...] Mother exposure to toxoplasmosis can cause cerebral calcification, hydrocephalus (causes mental disabilities), and mental retardation in infants. [...] Other birth abnormalities have been reported as well, such as chorioretinitis, microphthalmus, and ocular defects. [...] Syphilis causes congenital deafness, mental retardation, and diffuse fibrosis in organs, such as the liver and lungs, if the embryo is exposed.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{infectious}} agents include cytomegalovirus, the {{herpes simplex}} virus, hyperthermia, toxoplasmosis, and syphilis. [...] Mother exposure to cytomegalovirus can cause microcephaly, cerebral calcifications, blindness, chorioretinitis (which <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> <b>blindness),</b> hepatosplenomegaly, and meningoencephalitis in fetuses. [...] Microcephaly is a disorder {{in which the}} fetus has an atypically small head, cerebral calcifications means {{certain areas of the}} brain have atypical calcium deposits, and meningoencephalitis is the enlargement of the brain. [...] All three disorders cause abnormal brain function or mental retardation. [...] Hepatosplenomegaly is the enlargement of the liver and spleen which causes digestive problems. [...] It can also cause some kernicterus and petechiae. [...] Kernicterus causes yellow pigmentation of the skin, brain damage, and deafness. [...] Petechaie is when the capillaries bleed resulting in red/purple spots on the skin. [...] However, cytomegalovirus is often fatal in the embryo.|$|E

5000|$|Retrobulbar hemorrhage: {{trauma to}} the orbit can lead to {{bleeding}} behind the eye. The hemorrhage has nowhere to escape and the increased pressure pushes the eye out of the socket, leading to proptosis and <b>can</b> also <b>cause</b> <b>blindness</b> if not treated promptly.|$|R
50|$|Tylodelphys is a {{parasitic}} fluke that infects {{the small}} water fish. It induces many behavioral changeson its host. Once inside a fish’s eye, it <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> partial <b>blindness</b> and several behavioral {{changes to the}} intermediate host. Other species of flukes are able to turn into dormant cysts at certain stages of development, but Tylodelphys stays active and roams free inside the fish’s eye, giving it an opportunity for it to induce parasite behavior. When Tylodelphys larvae crawl around {{the inside of the}} fish’s eye, it can get in between the retina and the lens. This <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> partial <b>blindness</b> to the fish, rendering the fish unable to notice predators.|$|R
50|$|People with {{albinism}} {{often have}} vision {{loss to the}} extent that many are legally blind, though few of them actually cannot see. Leber's congenital amaurosis <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> total <b>blindness</b> or severe sight loss from birth or early childhood.|$|R

25|$|If ingested, {{alcohols}} (other than ethanol) such as methanol, propanol, and {{ethylene glycol}} metabolize into toxic aldehydes and acids, which cause potentially fatal metabolic acidosis.

5|$|Human {{eyes have}} color receptors known as cone cells, {{of which there}} are three types. In some cases, one is missing or faulty, which <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> color <b>blindness,</b> {{including}} the common inability to distinguish red and yellow from green, known as deuteranopia or redgreen color blindness.
