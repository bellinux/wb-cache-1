50|$|Vegetable {{farming is}} the growing of {{vegetables}} for human consumption. The practice probably started in several {{parts of the world}} over ten thousand years ago, with families growing vegetables for their own consumption or to trade locally. At first manual labour was used but in time livestock were domesticated and the ground could be turned by the plough. More recently, mechanisation has revolutionised vegetable farming with nearly all processes being able to be performed by machine. Specialist producers grow the particular crops that do well in their locality. New methods such as aquaponics, Raised-bed gardening|raised beds and <b>cultivation</b> <b>under</b> <b>glass</b> are used. Marketing can be done locally in farmer's markets, traditional markets or pick-your-own operations, or farmers can contract their whole crops to wholesalers, canners or retailers.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, present-day {{emissions}} {{of greenhouse gases}} and acidifying compounds from agriculture are analysed at the farm level. Quantitative estimates are given for these emissions from three nested systems in the Netherlands: the agricultural sector, greenhouse horticulture, and tomato <b>cultivation</b> <b>under</b> <b>glass.</b> Total emissions are subdivided into emissions from biogenic sources and abiogenic sources. We conclude that, although most of the emissions from the agricultural sector have biogenic sources, those from abiogenic sources should not be neglected. Abiogenic emissions are mainly from greenhouse horticulture. The cost-effectiveness of options to reduce carbon dioxide (CO 2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions from on-farm combustion of natural gas in tomato <b>cultivation</b> <b>under</b> <b>glass</b> is analysed. An inventory is given of technical reduction options that are presently available in practice. Based on information about the costs and the reduction potential of each option, cost-efficiency curves are derived for both types of emissions. Relative to a situation where none of the described options were applied (early nineties), CO 2 and NOx emissions from tomato cultivation can be reduced at most by about 70 nd 75 °respectively, by combinations of technical options...|$|E

In these prefectures, the management areas of vegetables were distinctly found to be much developed in the <b>cultivation</b> <b>under</b> cover as the culture area of the main crops, but the management areas of some of the other crops like fruit trees and cut flowers are not so developed yet at present.

On the other hand, the technical methods of the land and water management are supposed not to be established because their managements are clearly dependent on the experiences of each farmer who has conducted them for a long time.

The research was interested to identify the difference in production economics between traditional and improved management practices to reflect the results of extension activities (field days, training courses, and regional farmer field school) in developing the forage crops productivity, knowledge, skills and attitudes of farmers. The research employed surveyed data of 32 selected farmers, and selected farmers were the participated farmers in the project, The analytical tools were used descriptive statistics, gross margin analysis. The results indicated that Several extension activities had been implemented, These activities included field days, training courses, and regional farmer field school.
