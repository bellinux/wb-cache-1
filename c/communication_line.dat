5|$|Napoleon's plan envisaged {{that the}} Allies would throw many troops to envelop his right flank {{in order to}} cut the French <b>communication</b> <b>line</b> from Vienna. As a result, the Allies' centre and left flank would be exposed and become vulnerable. To {{encourage}} them to do so, Napoleon abandoned the strategic position on the Pratzen Heights, faking the weakness of his forces and his own caution. Meanwhile, Napoleon's main force was to be concealed in a dead ground opposite the Heights. According to the plan, the French troops would attack and recapture the Pratzen Heights, then from the Heights they would launch a decisive assault {{to the center of}} the Allied army, cripple them, and encircle them from the rear.|$|E

5|$|Following the Yellowstone {{fires of}} 1988, Henry (Rich Sommer) takes {{a job in}} 1989 as a Shoshone National Forest fire lookout, after his wife Julia (Larissa Gallagher) {{develops}} early-onset dementia. On the first day, his supervisor Delilah (Cissy Jones) contacts him via walkie-talkie and asks that he investigate illegal fireworks at a nearby lake. There he detects teenage girls skinny dipping, who accuse him of leering. On his way back, he finds a locked gate in a cave and spots a shrouded figure. Henry discovers his watchtower ransacked at arrival. The next day, Delilah sends him to a downed <b>communication</b> <b>line.</b> It is found cut, along with {{a message from the}} girls.

5|$|On {{the same}} day as Wedel arrived, 20 July, Saltykov {{established}} himself astride the Prussian <b>communication</b> <b>line</b> at the Oder, strengthening his already formidable position. This effectively cut any Prussian advance or reinforcement from Crossen (Krosno) or Frankfurt on the Oder. At this point, the Russians occupied the heights by Kay and additional high ground by Mosau (Mozów). A stream, the Eichmühlen Fliess, flowed in a swampy depression just to the east of the town. It could be crossed only at a single narrow point on the road east of Kay, directly opposite the Russian center; a second crossing could be made immediately south of Kay, which would permit an assault on the Russian right flank. This seemed reasonable to Wedel, but only if the Russians were not fully deployed.|$|E
5|$|An Allied council met on 1 December {{to discuss}} {{proposals}} for the battle. Most of the Allied strategists had two fundamental ideas in mind: making {{contact with the}} enemy and securing the southern flank that held the <b>communication</b> <b>line</b> to Vienna. Although the Tsar and his immediate entourage pushed hard for a battle, Emperor Francis of Austria was more cautious and, as mentioned, he was seconded by Kutuzov, the Commander-in-chief of the Russians and the Allied troops. The pressure to fight from the Russian nobles and the Austrian commanders, however, was too strong, and the Allies adopted the plan of the Austrian Chief-of-Staff, Franz von Weyrother. This called for a main drive against the French right flank, which the Allies noticed was lightly guarded, and diversionary attacks against the French left. The Allies deployed most of their troops into four columns that would attack the French right. The Russian Imperial Guard was held in reserve while Russian troops under Bagration guarded the Allied right. The Russian Tsar rudely stripped the authority of Commander-in-chief M. I. Kutuzov {{and gave it to}} Franz von Weyrother. In the battle, Kutuzov could only command the IV Corps of the Allied army, although he was still the de facto commander because the Tsar was afraid to take over in case his favoured plan failed.|$|E

5|$|As Helene {{approached}} Atlantic Canada in {{the process}} of transitioning into an extratropical storm, it produced heavy rainfall and strong winds along the islands. Passing just east of Nova Scotia on September29, Helene dropped at least 1in (25mm) across the entire province, peaking at 3.48in (88.5mm) in Cape Breton Island. Gusts peaked at 50mph (80km/h) across Cabot Strait, 70mph (115km/h) at CFB Shearwater and 60mph (100km/h) at Summerside, Prince Edward Island. The storm damaged power lines on the island but they were quickly repaired. The strong winds uprooted trees in the Halifax and Dartmouth, Nova Scotia area. In Nova Scotia, Helene's worst effects were felt in Cape Breton Island, where the storm was considered the worst in at least 21years. Only one <b>communication</b> <b>line</b> from the island to the mainland was effective after the storm passed. Numerous downed power lines resulted in minor fires, and schools were closed throughout the island. In Sydney, Nova Scotia, there was considerable property damage, and as many as 700people lost power. The lack of sufficient electricity forced the suspension of publications of the Cape Breton Post and disrupted normal restaurant cooking procedures. Damages in the community amounted to C$100,000. Offshore, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police cutter Fort Walsh, measuring 115ft (35m) in length, was washed ashore on the coast of Scatarie Island. The fishing wharf in Caribou, Nova Scotia was destroyed by rough seas generated by Helene, and at least 1,000lobster traps were carried into the Northumberland Strait as a result. In New Brunswick, the hurricane's impacts were relatively minor, and rainfall peaked at 1.56in (39.5mm).|$|E
5|$|The {{main attack}} was planned for 1 April, {{but as the}} various Japanese units moved into position, a number of minor probes were made by {{elements}} of the Japanese 6th Engineer Regiment in the Australian rear areas and along their line of communications. The first raid came {{on the night of}} 27/28 March, when a force of about 100 Japanese exploited a gap between the 25th Infantry Battalion's main defensive position and its 'B' Echelon—which included its transport and logistics elements and was protected by a company from the 61st Infantry Battalion—fixed bayonets and then assaulted the rear of the Australian perimeter. The Australians had been alerted to their approach after the <b>communication</b> <b>line</b> between the two positions had been cut, and when the attack began the men had already been roused and the weapons pits fully manned. As a result, the attack failed and was turned back. A number of Japanese survivors managed to dig-in near the perimeter and later fired upon the Australian clearing patrol that was sent out the following morning, as well as snipe at the company defending 'B' Echelon's position. Afterwards, the Australians counted 19 dead Japanese around their position, while they also managed to capture one of the wounded. Against this, the 25th Infantry Battalion had lost three killed and seven wounded.|$|E

He led 20 soldiers in defending the command post and <b>communication</b> <b>line</b> near Pustynka settlement in the Novgorod Oblast. His troops were {{cut off from the}} main Soviet forces. After the artillery preparation the Germans commenced a new attack, assuming that the Soviet forces were weakened. Understanding their strategy, Mamedov ordered his troops to hold fire, allowing the enemy to get within 10–15 meters. After three German assaults, he launched a counter-attack with bayonets. The Germans lost over 300 soldiers and retreated. Mamedov personally killed approximately 70 enemy troops, including three officers. For his actions, Mamedov was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union and the Order of Lenin on 11 December 1941 from Pavel Kurochkin. He was the first Azeri to receive the title.|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, {{to support}} his weak right flank, Napoleon ordered Davout's III Corps to force march {{all the way from}} Vienna and join General Legrand's men, who held the extreme {{southern}} flank that would bear the heaviest part of the Allied attack. Davout's soldiers had 48 hours to march [...] Their arrival was crucial in determining the success of the French plan. Indeed, the arrangement of Napoleon on the right flank was very risky as the French had only minimal troops garrisoning there. However, Napoleon was able to use such a risky plan because Davout—the commander of III Corps—was one of Napoleon's best marshals, because the right flank's position was protected by a complicated system of streams and lakes, and because the French had already settled upon a secondary line of retreat through Brunn. The Imperial Guard and Bernadotte's I Corps were held in reserve while the V Corps under Lannes guarded the northern sector of the battlefield, where the new <b>communication</b> <b>line</b> was located.|$|E
500|$|Arriving {{with his}} corps at Friedland on 13 June after nightfall, Lannes found the {{position}} already occupied by Russian forces. Very early on 14 June, Lannes intrepidly attacked {{with an almost}} symbolic force (between 11,000 and 13,500 men) against the might of a massed enemy army of 85,000. His goal was to prevent the enemy from crossing the Alle and to give Napoleon enough time to arrive with {{the remainder of his}} forces. Nansouty's division arrived on the field of battle at Friedland after the first engagements and was directed towards the strategic village of Heinrichsdorf. This village needed to be held, as it protected Lannes's communications with the rest of Napoleon's army. Grouchy also directed his dragoon division towards the village and was shocked to find it in enemy hands and Nansouty's men retreating at a trot, without even attempting to contain the enemy or to cover the route that represented the corps' <b>communication</b> <b>line.</b> In fact, Nansouty had arrived not long before and had been instructed to place himself at Heinrichsdorf, without further instructions and without being informed of what was happening on the right. As Russian infantry and cavalry were boldly pressing him, he became concerned with his own lines of communication and thus ordered his men back, to avoid being cut off.|$|E
5000|$|The open {{collector}} input/output {{is a popular}} alternative to three-state logic. For example, the I²C bus protocol (a bi-directional communication bus protocol often used between devices) specifies the use of pull-up resistors on the two <b>communication</b> <b>lines.</b> When devices are inactive, they [...] "release" [...] the <b>communication</b> <b>lines</b> and tri-state their outputs, thus removing their influence on the circuit. When all the devices on the bus have [...] "released" [...] the <b>communication</b> <b>lines,</b> the only influence on the circuit is the pull-up resistors, which pull the lines high. When a device wants to communicate, {{it comes out of}} the Hi-Z state and drives the line low. Devices communicating using this protocol either let the line float high, or drive it low - thus preventing any bus contention situation where one device drives a line high and another low.|$|R
