5|$|Before a {{property}} is {{inscribed on the}} List of World Heritage in Danger, its condition is assessed and a potential programme for <b>corrective</b> <b>measures</b> is developed {{in cooperation with the}} State Party involved. The final decision about inscription is made by the committee. Financial support from the World Heritage Fund may be allocated by the committee for listed properties. The state of conservation is reviewed on a yearly basis, after which the committee may request additional measures, delete the property from the list if the threats have ceased or consider deletion from both the List of World Heritage in Danger and the World Heritage List. Of the two Former UNESCO World Heritage Sites, the Dresden Elbe Valley was delisted after placement on the List of World Heritage in Danger while the Arabian Oryx Sanctuary was directly delisted. As of 2017, there are 54 entries (17 natural, 37 cultural) on the List of World Heritage in Danger. Some sites have been designated as World Heritage Sites and World Heritage in Danger in the same year, such as the Church of the Nativity, traditionally considered to be the birthplace of Jesus. Arranged by the UNESCO regions 22 of the listed sites are located in the Arab States (of which 7 are located in Syria and 5 in Libya), 15 in Africa (of which 5 are in the Democratic Republic of the Congo), 7 in Latin America and the Caribbean, 6 in Asia and the Pacific, and 4 in Europe and North America (all by 2017). The majority of the endangered natural sites (11) are located in Africa.|$|E
5|$|In some cases, danger listing {{has sparked}} {{conservation}} efforts and prompted {{the release of}} funds, resulting in a positive development for sites such as the Galápagos Islands and Yellowstone National Park, {{both of which have}} subsequently been removed from the List of World Heritage in Danger. Despite this, the list itself and UNESCO's implementation of it have been the focus of criticism. In particular, States Parties and other stakeholders of World Heritage Sites have questioned the authority of the Committee to declare a site in danger without their consent. Until 1992, when UNESCO set a precedent by placing several sites on the danger list against their wishes, States Parties would have submitted a programme of <b>corrective</b> <b>measures</b> before a site could be listed. Instead of being used as intended, the List of World Heritage in Danger is perceived by some states as a black list and according to Christina Cameron, Professor at the School of Architecture, Canada Research Chair on Built Heritage, University of Montreal, has been used as political tool {{to get the attention of}} States Parties. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) notes that UNESCO has referenced the List of World Heritage in Danger (without actually listing the site) in a number of cases where the threat could be easily addressed by the State Party. The Union also argues that keeping a site listed as endangered over a long period is questionable and that other mechanisms for conservation should be sought in these cases.|$|E

25|$|On {{the morning}} of March 12, while {{conducting}} his usual inspection of the dam, the dam keeper discovered a new leak in the west abutment. Concerned not only because other leaks had appeared in this same area {{in the past but}} more so that the muddy color of the runoff he observed could indicate the water was eroding the foundation of the dam, he immediately alerted Mulholland. After arriving, both Mulholland and Van Norman began inspecting the area of the leak. Van Norman found the source and by following the runoff, determined that the muddy appearance of the water was not from the leak itself but came from where the water contacted loose soil from a newly cut access road. The leak was discharging 2 to 3 cubic feet (15 to 22 U.S. gallons, or 57 to 85 liters) per second of water by their approximation. Certainly their concern was heightened not only given its location but more so in that at times the volume being discharged was inconsistent, they later testified at the Coroner's Inquest. Twice as they watched, an acceleration or surging of the flow was noticed by both men. Mulholland felt that some <b>corrective</b> <b>measures</b> were needed although this could be done at some time in the future.|$|E

Pressured by Arnold (through Norstad as an intermediary) for results, Hansell subjected his command to intensive <b>corrective</b> <b>measures</b> that caused more resentment among his aircrews.

500|$|Amtrak {{took several}} <b>corrective</b> <b>measures,</b> {{including}} operating with a reduced speed on curves, emptying the smaller {{of the two}} water tanks {{in order to reduce}} lateral motion, and making various alterations to the trucks themselves.

For the Chicago–Seattle Empire Builder, the speed restrictions added 6 hours to what had been a 46-hour schedule. Another important development was the unusually harsh winter of 1976–1977, which sidelined many of Amtrak's aging steam-heated coaches. Amtrak suspended numerous routes and pressed the new HEP-equipped Amfleet I coaches, designed for short runs, into service. The new EMD F40PH, intended for short-distance service and equipped with HEP, handled these trains.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{large-scale}} {{development of}} carbon geological storage requires the safety demonstration of this technology. The European Directive on the geological storage {{of carbon dioxide}} specifies the safety strategy to be adopted. Notably, a <b>corrective</b> <b>measure</b> plan is {{required in order to}} mitigate the potential "significant irregularities". In this paper, we describe one measure that could be applied in case of an unexpected abnormal behavior of the gas plume (e. g. leakage of CO 2). The objective is to trap the mobile gaseous CO 2 as quickly as possible; among all the trapping mechanisms occurring after CO 2 injection, capillarity trapping is the fastest and we then focused on its enhancement and improvement. The intervention strategy consists in injecting brine through the former CO 2 injection well in order to accelerate the wetting of the CO 2 plume. We run simulations through a 1 D-axisymetric model in order to evaluate the efficiency of such a measure; the results are sensitive towards brine injection rates and other site-specific key parameters but, in any case, the measure set-up leads to a rapid immobilization of the gaseous CO 2 in comparison with a simple relaxation. The consequences of the pressure build-up in terms of hydraulic and mechanic risks are not critical in the base case simulation conditions and thus do not compromise the applicability of the <b>corrective</b> <b>measure...</b>|$|R
