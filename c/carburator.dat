2500|$|The engine line-up was {{slightly}} revised for 1969. All models, except Torino GTs and Cobras, came standard {{with a new}} larger [...] I-6 engine. The larger displacement produced more power and torque than the [...] engine. Optional engines included the -2V (standard on GTs), the new for 1969 -2V Windsor, 351-4V Windsor, -4V, and the -4V Cobra Jet (standard on Cobras). The 428 CJ was available {{with or without the}} Ram Air Induction package, however, those with Ram Air still carried the same advertised power rating. The 428 CJ without Ram Air, came with the following items: 80-ampere heavy-duty battery, 3.25:1 open differential, heavy-duty cooling package, 55-ampere alternator, chrome valve covers and dual exhaust. The Ram Air 428 CJ included all of the above, but had a 3.50:1 open differential, and the functional hood scoop. With Ram Air, [...] "428 Cobra Jet" [...] emblems were placed {{on each side of the}} hood scoop; without Ram Air, [...] "428" [...] emblems were placed on the front fender. The 428 Cobra Jet had a 735 cfm Holley four-barrel <b>carburator.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Reflecting {{a further}} industry-wide {{adoption}} of smaller vehicle designs {{in the interest}} of improved fuel efficiency and emissions compliance, the Thunderbird was redesigned for 1980 on the compact Ford Fox platform, which first appeared only two years prior {{as the basis for the}} Ford Fairmont. Compared to the previous Torino-based Thunderbird and its large [...] wheelbase and [...] overall length, the new Thunderbird lost [...] of wheelbase and [...] in overall length. The squarish styling seen in the previous generation Thunderbird was favored for the new model, but the small car platform resulted in a poor translation with a distinctly upright appearance. Frameless door glass was no longer used; a chrome metal frame was used, making this car more like a two-door sedan. Combined with the poor performing [...] Windsor V8 as a base engine, and a C5 3 speed transmission with 2.26 rear gears, this Thunderbird generation was not well received by the public. The available 5.0L (302 cid) Windsor V8 with the AOD automatic overdrive transmission, coupled with a 3.45 rear end gear, was a welcome alternative to the 255, but with only [...] performance was moderately enhanced. Significantly, though failing to generate any new interest for the Thunderbird, a six-cylinder engine was made available for the first time in the Thunderbird's history in 1981, the [...] Thriftpower Six. For 1982 this was followed up with the replacement of the straight-six with a more modern V6, the 3.8L Essex, which was also now the Thunderbird's standard engine. It came equipped with a Motorcraft 2150 2V <b>carburator.</b> Hurting the Thunderbird's sales performance further, the 302 V8 did not return for 1982, leaving the 255 Cubic inch V8 as the only alternative engine. At 288,638 examples produced between 1980 and 1982, the eighth generation Thunderbird was barely more successful than the final model year of the previous Thunderbird generation. In order to revive the Thunderbird's success, a redesign was needed and Ford would deliver one for 1983.|$|E

50|$|The new 335 cu in (5.4 L) V8 engine it's {{introduced}} {{as a new}} engine option, only in medium duty trucks. This engine was designated by Mexican Ford engineers and was relative of the Windsor family and was based in the 351 and 302 ones, with a stronger crankshaft and enlonged stroke. The 335 had a Holley 2-barrel <b>carburator</b> and had an output of 200 hp at 4,000 RPM. This engine co-existed with the 289 cu in V8 up to 1972.|$|E
25|$|Another GS option {{package was}} {{available}} on the Buick Wildcat and Wildcat Custom, hardtop and convertible. The GS package included a 3.42 ratio posi rear, variable rate suspension springs, quick ratio steering box, heavy duty sway bars, and a switch-pitch turbo-hydramatic 400 transmission. The addition of the Y48 option gave the purchaser a pair of Carter AFB four barrel <b>carburators,</b> and finned aluminum valve covers on the 425 nail head engine. This was a one-year only option, existing in 1966 only. The Y48 option was delivered in the trunk and installed by the dealer.|$|R
50|$|In 1956, {{the body}} was changed to a type with {{enclosed}} wheels and engine, becoming the G2. This body was changed back to open-wheel in 1960. The engine was replaced with one based on the engine in the newer Moskvitch 407 in 1959; like the 405 engine, the 407 engine was equipped with four <b>carburators.</b> The suspension was revised in 1960, also borrowed from the 407. The G1 raced in its final configuration until 1963, after which it was scrapped. The G1 would {{be the basis for}} later racing cars such as the Moskvitch G2.|$|R
5000|$|In the film, Mitchum drove a souped-up black 1951 Ford two-door sedan (which {{was later}} repainted gray) with a custom tank {{in the back}} for moonshine liquor and a Ford V8 with three two barrel <b>carburators</b> but after a run in with the law, it was sold and {{replaced}} with a 1957 Ford Fairlane 500 two-door sedan with the same alterations excluding the engine carburation. The 1951 Ford was modified with a 1949 hood and 1950 grill and front bumper {{as well as the}} rear 1951 taillight chrome trim removed and 1949/1950 taillights installed.|$|R
5000|$|The G10 (sometimes {{referred}} to as the [...] "G10A" [...] to set it apart from the later G10B) is an inline 1.0 liter three-cylinder, four-stroke cycle gasoline engine utilizing aluminum alloy for the block, cylinder head and pistons.

Cylinder spacing is 84 mm, as for the four-cylinder G13/G15/G16 engines.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] TC had a 73 mm bore and 76 mm stroke; a {{bored and}} stroked {{version of the}} PC.

For 1977 a new, prize-winning lean burn version of the TC was {{developed}} for the new FA-series Familia, using a <b>carburator</b> with an EGR valve. Thus equipped, the TC weighs 127 kg.|$|E
50|$|Medal of Honor Firecracker 400 - NASCAR {{mandated}} restrictor plates for all tracks {{beginning at}} Daytona {{after nearly two}} seasons running <b>carburator</b> sleeves. Bobby Allison and Cale Yarborough swept the front row in their Chevrolets and battled for {{the lead in the}} first 65 laps before Cale crashed out, but from there David Pearson and February's 500 champ Petty took over; Allison fell out with engine failure and Pearson beat Petty for his second straight Firecracker win and eighth win of the season, his highest win total since 1969.|$|E
5000|$|Like the {{production}} 300 SL [...] "Gullwing" [...] it birthed, the W194 borrowed its overhead cam straight 6 engine {{from the regular}} four-door 300 (W189 [...] "Adenauer") luxury tourer introduced in 1951, with triple two-barrel Solex <b>carburators</b> from the exclusive 300 S (W188). Designed with an innovative diagonal aluminum head (that allowed for larger intake and exhaust valves) and canted at a fifty-degree angle {{to the right to}} fit under the W194's muchlower hoodline, it produced [...] in racing trim, considerably up from the 300s' [...] Maximum torque was 207 Nm.

50|$|When fitting an L28 with an LD28 {{crankshaft}} {{with standard}} bored cylinders {{it increases the}} engine displacement from 2.8 L (2753 cc) to about 2900 cc. It was never actually produced by Nissan, {{but it is a}} very easy and common modification to the L28 done by many Skyline and Z car enthusiasts. The most popular modification is the 3 mm overbored (89 mm) L3.1 litre (3096 cc); some add a turbo or two, but the more common setup is the triple Solex or Weber <b>carburators.</b> The only downside is that LD28 cranks are expensive- used units are scarce, but new units are available from the factory. Fully counterweighted 83 mm stroke and even 85 mm stroke cranks can be bought from aftermarket companies.|$|R
5000|$|A special Spanish-market model {{introduced}} in April 1970 was the [...] DIN 1000 GT, {{which had a}} milder version of the 1204 cc engine as found in the 1200 Coupé. This engine also powered the more luxurious 1000 Special (from 1972). In the spring of 1971 this received twin <b>carburators</b> and became the [...] "1000 Rallye GT", with power increased to [...] SAE. It had twin black stripes at the very rear and other sporting equipment. This version was discontinued in 1972, essentially being replaced by the 1000 Special. The more powerful French-built Simca 1000 Rallye models were not available in the Spanish market, but in February 1976 the Spanish-built Simca 1000 Rallye appeared. This has a single carburated version of the 1294 cc engine with , making it considerably less powerful than its French contemporaries. It also did not benefit from disc brakes all around. Its appearance {{was similar to the}} French built Rallye 2, with lots of black stripes and a black front bonnet. As {{with the rest of the}} 1000 range, the Spanish Rallye received a facelift with large, rectangular headlamps in September 1976.|$|R
