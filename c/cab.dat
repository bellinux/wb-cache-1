5|$|The first 23 <b>cab</b> car conversions, which {{included}} full {{removal of the}} propulsion gear and roof hump, took place around 1988. Ten (9630–9639) were designated for West Coast routes including the San Diegan, six (9640–9645) for the Atlantic City Express, and seven (9646–9652) for Chicago-based regional services. Coach #809 was pressed into <b>cab</b> car service with minimal modifications, making 24 active <b>cab</b> cars by 1990. Five more - #822 and 825–828 - soon followed. When the P40 locomotives were produced with 800-series numbering in the early 1990s, the later <b>cab</b> cars were renumbered 9709, 9822, and 9825–9828.|$|E
5|$|After {{extensive}} evaluation, the 166th Aviation Brigade completed {{training for}} the Combat Aviation Brigade (<b>CAB),</b> 34th Infantry Division on 4 August 2008. The brigade returned to Fort Riley for a month before beginning the process over again with pre-mobilization training of the <b>CAB,</b> 28th Infantry Division, and returned to Fort Sill for post-mobilization training in late January 2008.|$|E
50|$|Recently other {{automobiles}} like {{cars and}} SUVs {{have been introduced}} as taxi. Radio Taxis provide a luxury travel in the city but are considered relatively expensive for common man. Some of the known service providers are Easy <b>Cabs,</b> Meru <b>Cabs,</b> Dot <b>Cabs,</b> Ola <b>Cabs,</b> Uber, Mega <b>Cabs,</b> Taxi for sure, Yellow <b>cabs,</b> Orange <b>cabs,</b> Green <b>cabs.</b>|$|R

50|$|While yellow <b>cabs</b> {{continue}} to wait at designated spots, white <b>cabs</b> operate like black <b>cabs,</b> {{and can be}} hailed {{from anywhere in the}} city. Many white taxis are fueled by compressed natural gas.|$|R
5|$|Fleischer also voices Benny the <b>Cab</b> and {{two members}} of Doom's Weasel Gang, Psycho and Greasy. Lou Hirsch, who {{supplied}} the voice for Baby Herman, was the original choice for Benny the <b>Cab</b> but was replaced by Fleischer.|$|E
5|$|In March 2011, Ben Gibbard {{performed}} a new Death <b>Cab</b> for Cutie song at a solo concert in San Francisco, which {{would later be}} revealed as the title track from Codes and Keys. The track list for the album was released on Death <b>Cab</b> for Cutie's website on March 15, 2011.|$|E
5|$|On June 2, 1956, the Republican National Committee {{announced}} that Chotiner {{would have no}} role in the upcoming campaign. On June 6, a House subcommittee disclosed that the California attorney had written to President Eisenhower asking the President to intercede on behalf of Stanley Weiss's low-cost charter line North American Airlines (NAA) before the Civil Aeronautics Board (<b>CAB).</b> The attorney admitted inquiring of White House aides concerning the case, but denied using any influence on behalf of any client. White House officials said that they had done no more than ask the <b>CAB</b> when a decision might be expected in NAA's case, and that NAA had lost before the <b>CAB</b> anyway.|$|E
5000|$|Starting in 2010, the Army {{began to}} replace the medium and light <b>CABs</b> with {{multipurpose}} brigades, called [...] "full spectrum CABs". The ultimate goal is eight full spectrum <b>CABs</b> and four heavy <b>CABs</b> in active service, and respectively six and two <b>CABs</b> in the Army National Guard. Four brigades must be deployment-ready on a permanent basis.|$|R
50|$|Several private taxicab {{companies}} operate 24-hour {{service in}} Vancouver, including Yellow <b>Cabs,</b> Vancouver Taxi, Black Top <b>Cabs,</b> and MacLure's <b>Cabs.</b> Taxis and drivers are {{regulated by the}} city and, , 477 licensed <b>cabs</b> operated in the city, including 59 wheelchair-accessible vehicles. , a taxi ride to or from Vancouver International Airport costs approximately $30-$32. <b>Cabs</b> in Vancouver are powered by gasoline, natural gas, and electricity. There is also a pedicab company operating in downtown Vancouver called Tikki Tikki pedicabs, usually operating on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights.|$|R
50|$|Prime <b>Cabs</b> and Green <b>Cabs</b> are {{the well}} known {{professional}} radio taxi service in Guwahati.|$|R
5|$|The <b>Cab</b> {{and drive}} axle {{portion of a}} large {{capacity}} truck and trailer. Since {{the primary purpose of}} the <b>Cab</b> is to pull the trailer, it is rightly referred to as a tractor. The various kinds of tractors are Yard, Day, and Sleepers.|$|E
5|$|The {{discontinuance}} of the Atlantic City Express in 1995, and {{the arrival}} of the California Cars in 1996 and the Surfliner railcars in 2000–2002, lessened the need for the Metroliner-based <b>cab</b> cars. However, the Vermonter corridor service began using them when a reverse move was added between Springfield, Massachusetts and Palmer, Massachusetts in 1995. The later <b>cab</b> cars, and some of the earlier conversions, were retired in the 1990s and early 2000s. In 2007, six of the 9600-series <b>cab</b> cars were brought out of retirement to support additional frequencies on the newly re-electrified Keystone Service. After the Vermonters backup move was eliminated in 2014, the ex-Metroliner <b>cab</b> cars have been used primarily on the Keystone Service and New Haven–Springfield Shuttle.|$|E
5|$|The offset boiler {{and coal}} bunker caused the locomotive's {{centre of gravity}} to be shifted to one side. Experiments had to be {{undertaken}} to balance the locomotive by filling the linking corridor with large quantities of scrap metal, replaced in a re-design by a raised floor, covering the weighted material. These modifications resulted in the engine exceeding the total weight limit of 150 tons (151 tonnes), severely limiting the design's route availability during testing. A related problem was that despite being a tall locomotive, at , the <b>cab</b> ceilings were relatively low. The <b>cab</b> at the smokebox end of the locomotive suffered from the same excessive heat as did the fireman's <b>cab.</b> To circumvent this problem the locomotive was used in reverse, as the rear <b>cab</b> was next to the water tank and coal chute and therefore away from the hot gases circulating inside the smokebox.|$|E

50|$|Motorised hackney <b>cabs</b> in the UK, {{are known}} as black <b>cabs,</b> {{although}} they are now produced {{in a variety of}} colours, sometimes in advertising brand liveries (see below). The 50 golden <b>cabs</b> produced for the Queen's Golden Jubilee celebrations in 2002 were notable.|$|R

5|$|A {{variety of}} events {{have been held}} at the <b>CAB,</b> as well as {{receiving}} distinguished visitors. As part of the festivities for the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, the Olympic torch was passed through the hands {{of members of the}} First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles {{on the steps of the}} <b>CAB.</b> It is also a tradition that funeral processions of past LDS Church presidents pass in front of the Church Administration Building. The building has hosted visitors including Michelle Obama and George W. Bush.|$|E
5|$|Also the <b>cab</b> {{was reduced}} in width and remodelled {{to comply with}} reduced loading gauge over some routes.|$|E
5|$|Another {{criticism}} from locomotive crews concerned the exposed <b>cab</b> in bad weather, which necessitated {{the installation of}} a tarpaulin sheet over {{the rear of the}} <b>cab</b> and the front of the tender, restricting rearward vision. The 1921 Coal Miners’ strike meant that two class members (Nos.737 and 739) were converted to oil-burning. One of the modified locomotives subsequently caught fire at Salisbury shed, and both were reverted to coal firing {{by the end of the}} year. When the LSWR was amalgamated into the Southern Railway in 1923, Urie had done little to remedy the shortcomings of the N15s, and it fell to his successor to improve the class.|$|E
5000|$|All of the 1940 designs had {{commercial}} type closed <b>cabs</b> {{with minor}} modifications. Variants had an open passenger roof so a ring for a [...]50 caliber machine gun could be mounted, during World War II approximately {{one in four}} trucks had a ring. In 1942, to simplify production and reduce shipping height, all manufacturers began to use military style open <b>cabs.</b> Studebaker returned to closed <b>cabs.</b> The post-war M35 and M135 were designed with open <b>cabs</b> and half-doors. All military <b>cabs</b> could mount a machine gun ring. The M35 and M135 had removable hard tops available.|$|R

50|$|Traditional <b>cabs</b> in the Western sense are {{becoming}} more and more common, but remain very expensive in comparison to the gypsy <b>cabs.</b>|$|R
5|$|<b>Cab</b> {{providers}} like Ola Cabs and Uber {{also offer}} transport {{services in the}} city, and their services are extended to the Mangalore Airport.|$|E
5|$|Death <b>Cab</b> for Cutie {{began as}} a solo project of Ben Gibbard in 1997, while he was the guitar player for the band Pinwheel, and was {{recorded}} under the name All-Time Quarterback. As Death <b>Cab</b> for Cutie, Gibbard released a cassette titled You Can Play These Songs with Chords the same year. The release was surprisingly successful, and Gibbard decided to expand the project into a complete band, recruiting Chris Walla (who had also worked on the cassette) as lead guitarist, Nick Harmer as bass player, and Nathan Good as drummer. Death <b>Cab</b> for Cutie was officially formed at Western Washington University in Bellingham, Washington, and lyrics from early songs include local references that were important to the band's development. Many of the early songs were recorded {{in the basement of}} an Ellis Street home Gibbard lived in with several roommates in Bellingham.|$|E
5|$|Despite their {{electrical}} flaws, the Metroliners proved mechanically sound. Amtrak ordered over 600 non-powered Amfleet cars, {{based on}} the Metroliner design and also manufactured by Budd, in the mid-1970s. Beginning in 1987, Amtrak converted 23 former Metroliners for use as <b>cab</b> control cars on corridor trains. Fourteen more cars were used with minimal modifications - six as <b>cab</b> cars and 8 as trailer coaches. Most former Metroliners were scrapped between 2003 and 2011. However, some <b>cab</b> cars remain in use on Keystone Service and Shuttle trains. Three former Metroliners have also been converted to technology testing or track measurement cars, and one more is used by Amtrak as a special-purpose business car. One original Metroliner is preserved at the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania.|$|E
50|$|Apart from buses, private <b>cabs</b> {{commonly}} {{famous as}} Kali-Peeli (Black & yellow colored <b>cabs)</b> ply {{to the nearby}} places like Chandwad, Kalwan, Satana & Malegaon.|$|R
50|$|Meru <b>cabs</b> {{was founded}} by Neeraj Gupta in Mumbai on April 2007, by raising funds against an equity {{stake in the company}} from India Value Fund (IVF), which is a private equity fund with a corpus of over US$1.4 Billion. On 2 February 2014, Google Now and Meru <b>Cabs</b> {{announced}} a partnership to provide instant alerts to customers. Meru <b>cabs</b> partnered with French taxi service provider Taxis G7 to provide taxi services globally. In January 2016, Meru <b>cabs</b> started ride sharing options in New Delhi.|$|R
50|$|B units {{consisted}} of three motorized cars that ran in a set. The two end cars retained their operating <b>cabs</b> at the front and rear, but blind <b>cabs</b> were made inactive. Door control button boards were similarly deactivated in the end cars, but retained in the center (master) car. The center car's blind <b>cabs</b> were made inactive.|$|R
5|$|In regular service, the Pioneer Zephyr had {{its share}} of accidents. In 1939 it was {{involved}} in a head-on collision with a freight train that completely destroyed the <b>cab.</b> The train was rebuilt and re-entered revenue service soon afterward, but the accident strengthened the desire of locomotive designers to move the <b>cab</b> back {{from the front of the}} locomotive to above a large nose, as on EMD F-unit and EMD E-unit locomotives.|$|E
5|$|Jamal and Muhammad {{arrived at}} the {{junction}} in a <b>cab</b> around midday, {{on their way back}} from the car auction.|$|E
5|$|On October 4, 1955, the <b>CAB</b> {{released}} the final accident report, which concluded {{the reversal of}} the propellers and subsequent increase in power of the No. 4 engine had caused the accident.|$|E
25|$|Taxi {{services}} in Geelong {{are provided by}} Geelong Taxi Network, a newly formed depot following the effective merger of Bay City <b>Cabs</b> and Geelong Radio <b>Cabs</b> in July 2007.|$|R
50|$|Taxi {{frequencies}} {{are generally}} licensed in duplex pairs. One frequency {{is used for}} the dispatcher to talk to the <b>cabs,</b> and a second frequency is used to the <b>cabs</b> to talk back. This means that the drivers generally cannot talk to each other. Some <b>cabs</b> have a CB radio in addition to the company radio so they can speak to each other.|$|R
40|$|Country Analysis Briefs: 1994 is a {{compilation}} of country profiles prepared by the Energy Markets and Contingency Information Division (EMCID) of the Office of Energy Markets and End Use. EMCID maintains Country Analysis Briefs (<b>CABs)</b> for specific countries or geographical areas {{that are important to}} world energy markets. As a general rule, <b>CABs</b> are prepared for all members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), major non-OPEC oil producers (i. e., the North Sea, Russia), major energy transit areas (i. e., Ukraine), and other areas of current interest to energy analysts and policy makers. As of January 1995, EMCID maintained over 40 <b>CABs,</b> updated on an annual schedule and subject to revision as events warrant. This report includes 25 <b>CABs</b> updated during 1994. All <b>CABs</b> contain a profile section, a map showing the country`s location, and a narrative section. The profile section includes outlines of the country`s economy, energy sector, and environment. The narrative provides further information and discussion of these topics. Some <b>CABs</b> also include a detailed map displaying locations of major oil and gas fields, pipelines, ports, etc. These maps were created as a result of special individual requests and so are not typically a standard feature of the <b>CABs.</b> They are presented here wherever available as a supplement to the information contained in the <b>CABs...</b>|$|R
