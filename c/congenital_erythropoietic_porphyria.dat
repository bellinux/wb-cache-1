Amalgam, a common dental restorative material, may turn adjacent areas of teeth black or gray. Long term use of chlorhexidine, a mouthwash, may encourage extrinsic stain formation near the gingiva on teeth. This is usually easy for a hygienist to remove.

Erythroblastosis fetalis and biliary atresia are diseases which may cause teeth to appear green from the deposition of biliverdin. Also, trauma may change a tooth to a pink, yellow, or dark gray color. Pink and red discolorations are also associated in patients with lepromatous leprosy. Some medications, such as tetracycline antibiotics, may become incorporated into the structure of a tooth, causing intrinsic staining of the teeth.|$|E

40|$|Porphyria cutanea tarda and <b>erythropoietic</b> <b>porphyria</b> are {{disorders}} of heme synthesis that {{originate in}} the liver and bone marrow, respectively. Each is characterized by increased accumulation of uroporphyrin, I, by cutaneous photosensitivity, and in some patients by indurated plaques and scarring that resemble scleroderma. These scleroderma-like lesions occur in light-exposed and light-protected body areas. In these studies we evaluated the role of uroporphyrin I and of light in evoking the scleroderma-like cutaneous changes. Normal human skin fibroblasts were exposed to uroporphyrin I and to 400 nm radiation {{and the effect of}} these agents on collagen accumulation by the cells was determined. Radioactive tracer studies showed that uroporphyrin I caused a specific increase in the accumulation of newly synthesized collagen by fibroblast monolayer cultures, as verified by [3 H]hydroxyproline and collagenase digestion assays. Collagen accumulation was stimulated 1. 5 - to 2. 7 -fold by uroporphyrin I, whereas noncollagenous protein accumulation was unchanged. The increased collagen accumulation was time and uroporphyrin I-concentration-dependent, and occurred both in {{the presence or absence of}} ultraviolet light exposure. Further studies demonstrated that the increased accumulation was not the result of decreased rates of collagen degradation nor was it due to changes in cell population growth parameters (generation times and saturation densities). No changes in morphology of the treated cells occurred. These studies indicate that porphyrins possess previously undemonstrated biological effects that are independent of their photosensitizing properties.

Homozygous mice display erythrodontia, moderate photosensitivity, hepatosplenomegaly, and hemolytic anemia. Uroporphyrin (99 % type I isomer) accumulates in urine. Total porphyrins are increased in erythrocytes and feces, while Uros enzymatic activity is below 1 % of the normal level in the different tissues analyzed.
