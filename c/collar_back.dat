5000|$|Each knitter {{has her own}} {{method of}} making a shawl collar, using garter stitch, basket stitch, or ribbing, and {{knitting}} in one colour or incorporating stripes. [...] A common technique is to pick up {{two of the four}} base stitches, start on one side and work up the neck edge to the shoulder by picking up a stitch from the lapel edge on each row and increasing the width of the collar as it is worked. The top ends in line with the shoulder seam. The same is done for the other side. The knitter then picks up stitches from the neck edge and knits back and forth, increasing on each row and picking up stitches form the top of the lapel, then casts off the <b>collar</b> <b>back.</b> Some skilled knitters are able to pick up stitches all around the neckline and knit the collar all at one time by increasing and decreasing for shaping.|$|E

40|$|A simple {{depth gauge}} has been {{designed}} to ensure, easily and quickly, the proper length of screws in bone surgery. The instrument of this type most often seen in general use consists of a slim steel bar with a hook or right angle on the distal end. Upon this rod is mounted a sliding metal collar with a set screw to fix it firmly to the rod at the desired place. This device has certain drawbacks, the most important of which is that the set screw must be screwed in firmly or not at all. When the instrument has been passed through the screw hole, the bent end engaged in the opposite cortex, and the sliding collar pushed against the proximal cortex, the set screw must be engaged firmly. This C manoeuvre often prevents the dis- (i,) engagement of the instrument and its withdrawal from the drill hole. FIG. 1 It is necessary then to loosen the set screw, and an error is introduced when the sliding <b>collar</b> <b>backs</b> away from the bone. The instrument described here (Fig. 1) is designed to overcome these difficulties. I...|$|R
