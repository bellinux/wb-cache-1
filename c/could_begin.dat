5|$|Camera crews spent 10 {{days from}} November 5–18, 2005 to film {{sequences}} that would involve intense visual effects so Sony Pictures Imageworks <b>could</b> <b>begin</b> {{work on the}} shots early in the project.

5|$|Nairn Ridge {{remained}} in Ottoman hands until about 19:00 on 19 September, {{when it was}} finally captured and the road works <b>could</b> <b>begin,</b> and the 53rd Division could start their attempt to block the line of retreat, to the Jordan River at Mafid Jozele.|$|E
5|$|The {{fact that}} {{religious}} tracts, dictionaries, and teaching guides already {{existed in the}} Xiamen tongue meant that the missionaries in Taiwan <b>could</b> <b>begin</b> proselytizing immediately, without the intervening time needed to write those materials.|$|E
5|$|USS Philippines (CB-4), Puerto Rico (CB-5), and Samoa (CB-6) {{were planned}} as the fourth, fifth, and sixth ships of the class, respectively. All {{were going to}} be built at Camden, New Jersey, but they were {{cancelled}} before construction <b>could</b> <b>begin.</b>|$|E

5|$|Work from Wimbledon to South Merton was {{completed}} quickly, so that services <b>could</b> <b>begin</b> {{running as a}} single-track operation on 7 July 1929.

5|$|By 1980, the USACE {{was working}} to obtain funding, {{which was the}} major {{obstacle}} for completion; public concerns about the project were {{that it was not}} needed and would be too costly. The USACE announced in 1981 that an environmental impact report was necessary before the project <b>could</b> <b>begin,</b> following the Endangered Species Act of 1973; the least tern and light-footed clapper rail were considered endangered, and construction would have affected their habitat. The next year, the environmental impact report process began, funded by the USACE.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the end of}} {{hostilities}} in Europe the Australian government decided against contributing Australian forces to the occupation forces that were sent to Germany {{as part of the}} post war settlement so that it <b>could</b> <b>begin</b> the repatriation of the AIF early. Lieutenant General Sir John Monash was appointed Director-General of Repatriation and Demobilisation and oversaw the process in Britain, while Lieutenant General Henry Chauvel took charge of the efforts in the Middle East.|$|E
5|$|In March 2012, 20th Century Fox stopped {{production}} before filming <b>could</b> <b>begin.</b> Budgetary issues remained unresolved and Sutherland's narrow {{time frame}} for filming were cited as reasons for halting production. However, in July 2012, Sutherland assured {{the film was}} still in plans {{and that they would}} begin filming in summer 2013. The film was eventually suspended in May 2013 after the announcement that the show would return as a limited series.|$|E
5|$|Machete {{turned out}} to be more of a success at the box office than Grindhouse, {{grossing}} $44 million internationally against a just-over $10 million budget. At the end of the film, the announcer says that there would be two sequels: Machete Kills and Machete Kills Again. Soon afterward, Rodriguez confirmed that the financing for the sequels was in place, and that once everyone was free, they <b>could</b> <b>begin</b> shooting.|$|E

50|$|After {{that first}} week, new {{commissioner}} Bowie Kuhn {{leaned on the}} owners {{to reach an agreement}} as well, and they soon sat down with the players again. By February 25 they had acceded to most of the players' demands: a higher contribution of approximately $5.45 million annually, an earlier age at which players <b>could</b> <b>begun</b> drawing pensions, a wider range of benefits and less playing time required for eligibility. By the end of the month, all players had reported to spring training.|$|R
25|$|In 1995, LET again amended {{their designs}} through {{work with the}} public. However, a retail {{recession}} meant that the plans <b>could</b> not <b>begin</b> construction and they never developed.|$|R
5|$|On December 31, 1840 the pre-fabricated {{pendulum}} {{house was}} assembled. Axes and chisels cut away the rock surface for the pendulum's base. It took another {{three days to}} adjust the clock {{to the point where}} the experiments <b>could</b> <b>begin.</b> However, the high winds made so much noise that the ticks could often not be heard, and varied the temperature to make measurements inaccurate. Grass had to be painstakingly brought from the lowest elevations for insulation to get accurate measurements.|$|E
5|$|The brigade {{was then}} sent to India as the division's advance party, but the war ended before it <b>could</b> <b>begin</b> operations. Instead the brigade became {{involved}} in disarming the Japanese forces in Malaya and Singapore, to restore British sovereignty. Its last operation was in Java, where it remained until a Dutch force arrived to take over. The brigade then rejoined the 6th Airborne Division, which was serving in Palestine, but was disbanded almost immediately afterwards.|$|E

5|$|The {{project has}} also {{suffered}} setbacks {{due to the}} bankruptcy of several potential backers; both Dino De Laurentiis's De Laurentiis Entertainment Group and Francis Ford Coppola's American Zoetrope were attached to the project at different times; both production companies went bankrupt before work <b>could</b> <b>begin.</b> Lynch had stayed with Coppola in the latter's home in Napa County, California, while Coppola and musician Sting read the script several times; however the failure of 1982's One from the Heart forced Zoetrope to file for bankruptcy.|$|E
5|$|Before {{construction}} <b>could</b> <b>begin,</b> the Navy {{found itself}} {{in the midst of}} political situation because the Hungarian government demanded that {{a substantial portion of the}} submarine contracts be allocated to Hungarian firms. After intricate negotiations, the order was split into two orders of two submarines each, with U-20 and U-21 built at the Pola Navy Yard, and U-22 and U-23 built at the Hungarian UBAG yard at Fiume. The subcontracts were also divided between Hungarian and Austrian firms, with about two-thirds going to Hungarian companies and one-third to Austrian companies. This allocation of contracts, while politically expedient, exacerbated technical problems that resulted in numerous modifications and delays.|$|E
5|$|In December 1997, Rajinikanth {{announced}} his next project, {{which would have}} K. S. Ravikumar as director. The title of the film was announced as Padayappa in September 1998. Though principal photography for the film was supposed to start in April 1998, the FEFSI strike delayed the project. After the strike ended, Ravikumar still had to complete the film he was then working on, Natpukkaga (1998), before he <b>could</b> <b>begin</b> Padayappa. After completing Natpukkaga in June 1998, Padayappa was further delayed when Ravikumar agreed to quickly remake Natpukkaga in Telugu as Sneham Kosam (1999).|$|E
