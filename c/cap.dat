5|$|After the work-ins had ended, work {{continued}} on finishing the <b>cap</b> which {{was scheduled for}} lift-on in October. The weather hampered the work initially, but {{the application of a}} modern microporous paint, designed to withstand normal movement of the timber and yet remain waterproof, was completed in time for the lift-on. A mini work-in was held the weekend before the <b>cap</b> was lifted, with 17 people participating over the weekend. Final work was done to the <b>cap</b> and a new window was fitted to the stone floor of the mill. The tarpaulin was removed and the trammel dismantled. The 5-ton <b>cap</b> was lifted into place by a mobile crane on 24 October 1983, watched by a crowd of some 70 people. The fitting of the <b>cap</b> was toasted with beer from Adnams Brewery, Southwold.|$|E

5|$|Even {{more similar}} {{is the very}} rare Lactarius semisanguifluus. Its milk also discolours within 5 to 8minutes to maroon. The <b>cap</b> of older fruit bodies is nearly {{completely}} greenish. It is also common under pines.

B.aureissimus var. castaneus has a purplish-brown <b>cap</b> with a texture like velvet.|$|E

5|$|Fruit body {{primordia}} first appear {{between the}} scales of the cones, and require 9 to 35 days to reach their final height. They consist of an inner core of thin-walled generative hyphae enclosed by an outer coat of skeletal hyphae. Immature fruit bodies are white and delicate, but gradually become brown as they mature. Because the <b>cap</b> is grown from the stem tip after it bends, <b>cap</b> development interrupts stem growth, and this shift to centrifugal growth (that is, growth outward from the stem) results in the typical kidney-shaped or semicircular <b>cap.</b> Although the fruit body takes at least 9 days to mature, spores production begins within 48–72 hours of the start of <b>cap</b> growth. Spines start out as minute protuberances {{on the part of}} the stem adjoining the undersurface of the <b>cap.</b> As the <b>cap</b> enlarges, these spines are spread horizontally, and more protuberances are formed, which elongate vertically downwards.|$|E
5|$|In Amanita abrupta, as {{with most}} mushrooms, {{the bulk of the}} {{organism}} lies unseen beneath the ground as an aggregation of fungal cells called hyphae; under appropriate environmental conditions, the visible reproductive structure (fruit body) is formed. The <b>cap</b> has a diameter of , and has a broadly convex shape when young, but eventually flattens. The central portion of the <b>cap</b> becomes depressed in mature specimens. The <b>cap</b> surface is verrucose—covered with small angular or pyramidal erect warts (1–2mm tall by 1–2mm wide at the base); the warts are smaller and more numerous near the margin of the <b>cap,</b> and small fragments of tissue may be hanging from the margin of the <b>cap.</b> The <b>cap</b> surface, the warts, and the flesh are white. The warts can be easily separated from the <b>cap,</b> and in mature specimens they have often completely or partly disappeared. The white gills are placed moderately close together, reaching the stem but not directly attached to it.|$|E
50|$|Several {{brands of}} <b>caps</b> were {{manufactured}} {{during the late}} 20th and early 21st centuries.

5|$|In animals, poly(A) {{ribonuclease}} (PARN) {{can bind to}} the 5' <b>cap</b> {{and remove}} nucleotides from the poly(A) tail. The level {{of access to the}} 5' <b>cap</b> and poly(A) tail is important in controlling how soon the mRNA is degraded. PARN deadenylates less if the RNA is bound by the initiation factors 4E (at the 5' <b>cap)</b> and 4G (at the poly(A) tail), which is why translation reduces deadenylation. The rate of deadenylation may also be regulated by RNA-binding proteins. Once the poly(A) tail is removed, the decapping complex removes the 5' <b>cap,</b> leading to a degradation of the RNA. Several other enzymes that seem to be involved in deadenylation have been identified in yeast.|$|E
5|$|Inocybe maculata {{is similar}} to the {{variable}} Inocybe lacera, the split fibrecap, but it can be differentiated by the darker colouration of the <b>cap,</b> and the white remains of the veil in the centre of the <b>cap.</b> The species is also similar in appearance to Inocybe lanatodisca, but can be readily distinguished by odour (I.lanatodisca has a characteristic sweet, green-corn smell) and the colour of the <b>cap</b> (I.lanatodisca has a fulvous <b>cap).</b> It is closely related to Inocybe fastigiata, but can again be distinguished by colour; I.fastigiata has lighter coloured fibrils.|$|E

The <b>capping</b> plate to plunger distance had a major influence on the obtained residual seal force values of a sealed vial, whereas the <b>capping</b> pre-compression force and the turntable rotation speed showed only a minor influence on the residual seal force of a sealed vial. <b>Capping</b> process parameters could not easily be transferred from <b>capping</b> equipment of different manufacturers. However, the residual seal force tester did provide a valuable tool to compare <b>capping</b> performance of different <b>capping</b> equipment. No vial showed any leakage greater than 10 (- 8) mbar L/s as measured by a helium mass spectrometry system, suggesting that container closure integrity was warranted in the residual seal force range tested for the tested container closure systems.
