5|$|The {{report states}} {{that there were}} two {{critical}} errors made during the planning stages. Firstly, the parking lot for the mall was located {{on the roof of the}} building without there being sound waterproofing, and secondly the structural inefficiency of the hollow <b>concrete</b> <b>slabs</b> which prevented the installation of effective waterproofing later on.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} years border fortifications inside the city mostly {{consisted}} of brick walls with a top made of barbed wire. Clay bricks and <b>concrete</b> <b>slabs</b> were used for construction. Further obstacles of barbed wire and upstate walls delimitated the East and at some places, like Bernauer Stra√üe, bricked-up buildings formed the boundary line. The buildings were situated on East-Berlin territory, whereas the pavement {{in front of the}} houses belonged to West-Berlin. In many places safety installations of West-Berlin's outer ring consisted of metal fences and barbed wire barriers. Technologically advanced upgrading took place later on and only in 1975 L-shaped concrete segments that were known from the fall of the Wall were added.|$|E

Later, the Indian government set up 742relief centers housing 177,000people, utilizing schools and office buildings. However, residents did not stay {{for extended periods}} of time in the shelters, as rebuilding began within three days of the storm's landfall. Many of the displaced people returned to their homes after the storm receded. Workers restored water service and distributed potable water to those in need. Workers used cranes to remove trees from highways. Roads and communication links were quickly restored, as was the power supply. Later, damaged houses were reconstructed with tiled roofs while destroyed houses were rebuilt on <b>concrete</b> <b>slabs,</b> both to withstand stronger winds.|$|E

40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} {{finite element}} model (3 D FEM) is built using ABAQUS to analyze the dynamic response of a concrete pavement structure with an asphalt isolating layer under moving loads. The 3 D model is prepared and validated {{in the state of}} no asphalt isolating layer. Stress and deflection at the critical load position are calculated by changing thickness, modulus of isolating layer and the combination between the isolating layer and <b>concrete</b> <b>slab.</b> Analysis result shows that the stress and deflection of the <b>concrete</b> <b>slab</b> increase with the increase of thickness. The stress and deflection of the <b>concrete</b> <b>slab</b> decrease with the increase of combination between the isolating layer and <b>concrete</b> <b>slab.</b> The influence of changing the isolating layer modulus to the stress and deflection of the <b>concrete</b> <b>slab</b> is not significant. From the results, asphalt isolating layer design is suggested in concrete pavement...|$|R

40|$|A {{partially}} prefabricated composite floor, with wood-steel composite beams {{connected with}} a <b>concrete</b> <b>slab,</b> is studied. It is made of a light prefabricated part and a cast-in-place <b>concrete</b> <b>slab.</b> The prefabricated part is made of wood beams connected with cold-formed steel profiles and a sandwich panel with wooden boards and polystirene sheets between the beams. The <b>concrete</b> <b>slab</b> is cast on the polystyrene sheets. In the stage of erection, the prefabricated part is first set-in-place, and, {{by means of the}} wood-steel composite beams, is also able to support the fluid concrete without cribs. When the concrete is hardened, a composite floor with two members in compression (<b>concrete</b> <b>slab</b> and cold formed steel profiles) connected with wood beams is obtained. In this latter case, the steel profiles help the <b>concrete</b> <b>slab</b> in providing the compressive internal reaction of the composite floor, although with a stress level lower than that reached in the stage of erection when the weight of fluid concrete loads the wood-steel composite beams...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays {{there are}} several kinds of {{products}} innovations in the construction industry, {{one of whom is}} a precast <b>concrete</b> <b>slab.</b> In fact, products of innovation are not necessarily fully able to provide a positive impact, both in terms of cost, quality, time, and waste on building construction projects. Moreover, what is offered by the manufacturer of precast <b>concrete</b> <b>slab</b> has not necessarily correspond with the needs of the customer. The {{purpose of this study is}} to analyze the comparison of products in terms of time, cost, quality, and waste between projects using precast <b>concrete</b> <b>slab</b> and the same projects that were simulated using floordeck <b>concrete</b> <b>slab.</b> This research will: (1) simulate the project if not using precast <b>concrete</b> <b>slab</b> product, (2) analyze the comparison of products in terms of time, cost, quality, and waste between the real project and the simulation project, (3) calculate the benefits obtained from the use of precast <b>concrete</b> <b>slab</b> product.

25|$|There {{does not}} seem to be a {{researched}} history of sprung floors. There would not have been much perceived need until recently, when <b>concrete</b> <b>slabs</b> started being generally used for sub-floors. Before then floors were mainly either earthen or used wood on joists, both of which provide some cushioning from shocks. Early sprung floors often used leaf or coil springs, whence the name; these floors tended to bounce, but modern floors have suppressed this 'trampoline' effect and so are often called semi-sprung.|$|E

25|$|PCL Construction {{was awarded}} the contract, and {{construction}} began early in 2004, with a budget of $CDN28 million. For the structural system, Manasc and its consulting engineer decided to use flat <b>concrete</b> <b>slabs</b> instead of more conventional steel framing, for two reasons. First, the concrete could be produced locally. Second, it used concrete with 25% fly ash, which can reduce greenhouse gas emissions from making concrete by up to 40%. Greenstone thus became the first project in Yellowknife to use concrete made that way, establishing the capacity for further use in other construction. The frame was covered with an insulated, pressure-equalized rainscreen clad in stucco, which uses less energy in its production. To preserve the building's warmth better, triple-glazed windows were set in fiberglass frames.|$|E
25|$|In November 1948, {{the first}} of these new homes were {{completed}} and ready for occupancy. These one-story, three bedroom houses were constructed on <b>concrete</b> <b>slabs</b> with radiant heating - construction atypical of New England and initially viewed with suspicion by some. This suspicion was apparently unwarranted since the market value of some of the original houses is now over $450,000. The cost of a basic house was $7,820; but a homeowner could also add cedar shingles for $319.00; cedar clapboards with gypsum sheathing ($247.00); a breezeway-type porch without a garage ($325.00) or with a garage ($1,250.00); or a detached garage ($925.00). Some homeowners took advantage of these extras when they selected their houses, while others chose to wait and made additions to their houses at a later date.|$|E
25|$|A concrete-face rock-fill dam (CFRD) is a rock-fill dam with <b>concrete</b> <b>slabs</b> on its {{upstream}} face. This design {{provides the}} concrete slab as an impervious wall to prevent leakage {{and also a}} structure without concern for uplift pressure. In addition, the CFRD design is flexible for topography, faster to construct and less costly than earth-fill dams. The CFRD concept originated during the California Gold Rush in the 1860s when miners constructed rock-fill timber-face dams for sluice operations. The timber was later replaced by concrete as the design was applied to irrigation and power schemes. As CFRD designs grew in height during the 1960s, the fill was compacted and the slab's horizontal and vertical joints were replaced with improved vertical joints. In the last few decades, the design has become popular.|$|E
