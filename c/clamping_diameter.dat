5000|$|Both quill and {{threadless}} stems come in {{a variety}} of bicycle handlebar <b>clamp</b> <b>diameters.</b> The ISO standard for the clamping area of a handlebar is 25.4 mm (1 inch), which is used on mountain bikes and many Japanese-made road handlebars. However, the Italian unofficial standard is 26.0 mm, which is the most common clamp size for road bars. There are also intermediate sizes such as 25.8 mm to try to achieve compatibility with either an ISO or Italian stem, and the old Cinelli-specific size of 26.4 mm. In practice, many modern stems with removable faceplates allow for slight differences in handlebar <b>clamp</b> <b>diameter,</b> but the older type of stem with a single pinch bolt must be accurately matched. In the days of quill stems, a road stem was clearly identifiable from its [...] "7" [...] shape, but nowadays it can be hard to tell the difference between a [...] "road" [...] (26.0 mm) and [...] "MTB" [...] (25.4 mm) stem. Manufacturers frequently omit the clamp size from advertising or packaging.|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to the stem clamp area, the shifter and/or brake lever and grip area on a bar can have several different diameters. For traditional road and mountain handlebars, these diameters are standard and so there has historically been little confusion except when mixing road and mountain components. However, in recent years there have been cross-over bar types that do not fall into one category or the other, and which can conceivably use either type of shifter, brake lever or grip (an example is the upright style bar). For this reason, certain handlebars are now available in multiple sizes related to the shifter or brake lever <b>clamp</b> <b>diameter.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A new {{standard}} is an [...] "oversize" [...] 31.8 mm or 31.7 mm clamp for both MTB and road bars. This is popular on mountain bikes, {{especially those with}} a focus on [...] "all mountain" [...] and [...] "downhill" [...] activities, as the stem and handlebars can be both stiffer and lighter. This <b>clamp</b> <b>diameter</b> is taking over from the previous mix of sizes on road bicycles with drop-bars. On these stems, standard brake levers can be used as it is only the central section that is oversized although other accessories that mount near the stem also need to be oversized to fit (some brackets are adjustable). Shims are available to fit either a 25.4 mm or 26 mm bar to a 31.8 mm stem, so many new models of stems are oversize-only.|$|R

In this study, fracture of glass disks (brittle material) and plastic deformation of aluminum disks (ductile material) at very high shock levels caused by accidental drop are investigated using finite element analysis. It is found that failure inception for both disk types occurs at the inside perimeter of the disk. For glass disks, cracks are found to propagate toward the outer perimeter of the disk along distinct radial lines associated with the largest bending moment of the disk. The critical shock level at which failure originates increases with an increase in the <b>clamp</b> <b>diameter,</b> a reduction in the disk diameter, and an increase in the thickness of the disk.

40|$|In small spacecraft, the {{proximity}} of sensitive components to release systems {{has led to the}} need for lowshock spacecraft release systems. Marmon band systems are often desirable for their flight history, structural capability, and reliability. Until recently, only pyrotechnically released clamp bands were readily available. The clamp band system described in ths paper reduces shock in two ways: it eliminates shock typically associated with pyrotechnic release devices as well as utilizing a release device that reduces the shock associated with the rapid release of the preload strain energy. Patented Fast Acting Shockless Separation Nut (FASSN) technology is utilized to convert strain energy stored in the system into rotational energy of a flywheel.

40|$|Vibration {{in metal}} cutting {{is a common}} problem in the {{manufacturing}} industry, especially when long and slender tool holders or boring bars {{are involved in the}} manufacturing process. Vibration has a detrimental effect on machining. In particular the surface finish is likely to suffer, but tool life is also most likely to be reduced. Tool vibration also results in loud noise that may disturb the working environment. The first part of this thesis describes the development of a robust and manually adjustable analog controller capable of actively controlling boring bar vibrations related to internal turning. This controller is compared with an adaptive digital feedback filtered-x LMS controller and it displays similar performance with a vibration attenuation of up to 50 dB. A thorough experimental investigation of the influence of the clamping properties on the dynamic properties of clamped boring bars is also carried out in second part of the thesis. In relation to this, it is demonstrated that the number of clamping screws, the <b>clamping</b> screw <b>diameter</b> size, the screw tightening torque and the order the screws are tightened, have a significant influence on a clamped boring bar’s eigenfrequencies as well as on its mode shape orientation in the cutting speed - cutting depth plane. Also, an initial investigation of nonlinear dynamic properties of clamped boring bars was carried out. Furthermore, vibration in milling has also been studied in relation to millingtool holders with a long overhang. A basic investigation concerning the spatial dynamic properties of the tool holders of milling machines, both when not cutting and during cutting, has been carried out. Also, active control of milling tool holder vibration has been investigated and a first prototype of an active milling tool holder was implemented and tested. The challenge of transferring electrical power while maintaining good signal quality to and from a rotating object is addressed and a solution to this is proposed. Finally, vibration is also a problem for the hydroelectric power industry. In Sweden, hydroelectric power plants stand for approximately half of Sweden’s electrical power production and are also considered to be a so-called green source of energy. When renovating water turbines in small-scale hydroelectric power plants and modifying them to optimize efficiency, it is not uncommon that disturbing vibrations occur in the power plant. These vibrations have a negative influence on the production capacity and will wear various components quickly. Occasionally, these vibrations may cause severe damage to the power plant. To identify this vibration problem, experimental modal analysis and operating deflection shape analysis were utilized. To reduce the vibration problem, active control using inertial mass actuators was investigated. Preliminary results indicate a significant attenuation of the vibrations...|$|R

Limitations of the initial concept were identified during testing and future design improvements were proposed and later implemented. These new features enhance the coupling of the sensor device and improve the monitoring system measurement capabilities. A major challenge of a post-installed instrumentation monitoring system is to ensure adequate coupling between the instruments {{and the structure of}} interest for reliable measurements. Friction-based devices have the potential to overcome coupling limitations caused by marine growth and soil contamination on flowlines, risers, and other subsea structures. The work described in this paper investigates the design and test of a friction-based coupling device (herein referred to as a friction clamp) which is suitable for pipelines and structures that are suspended in the water column as well as for those that are resting on the seabed. The monitoring elements consist of fiberoptic sensors that are bonded to a stainless steel clamshell assembly with a high-friction surface coating. The friction clamp incorporates a single hinge design to facilitate installation of the clamp and dual rows of opposing fasteners to distribute the clamping force along the structure. The friction clamp can be modified to be installed by commercial divers in shallow depths or by remotely operated vehicles in deep-water applications. NASA-JSC was involved in the selection and testing of the friction coating, and in the design and testing of the prototype <b>clamp</b> device. Four-inch <b>diameter</b> and eight-inch <b>diameter</b> sub-scale friction <b>clamp</b> prototypes were built and tested to evaluate the strain measuring capabilities of the design under different loading scenarios. The testing revealed some limitations of the initial design concept, and subsequent refinements were explored to improve the measurement performance of the system. This study was part of a collaboration between NASA-JSC and Astro Technology Inc. within a study called Clear Gulf. The primary objective of the Clear Gulf study is to develop advanced instrumentation technologies that will improve operational safety and reduce the risk of hydrocarbon spillage. NASA provided unique insights, expansive test facilities, and technical expertise to advance technologies that will benefit the environment, the public, and commercial industries...|$|R
