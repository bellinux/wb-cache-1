5|$|Although {{it could}} not be {{considered}} a large air arm in the wider context of World War II, the ZNDH nonetheless had on its <b>charge</b> <b>at</b> one time or another some 650 aircraft between April 1941 and May 1945, as well as anti-aircraft and paratroop units. From humble beginnings in 1941, the ZNDH was still providing some measure of air-support (fighter, attack and transport) until the last days of World War II in Europe.|$|E

For many of the works, including the operas Maskarade and Saul and David, and the complete Aladdin music, this was their first printed publication, copies of manuscripts having previously been used in performances.

5|$|Bradbury took <b>charge</b> <b>at</b> Los Alamos at a {{difficult}} time. Staff were leaving in droves, living conditions were poor {{and there was}} a possibility that the laboratory would close. He managed to persuade enough staff to stay, and got the University of California to renew the contract to manage the laboratory. He pushed continued development of nuclear weapons, transforming them from laboratory devices to production models. Numerous improvements made them safer, more reliable and easier to store and handle, and made more efficient use of scarce fissionable materiel.|$|E

5|$|In 1984, the NHC was {{separated}} from the Miami Weather Service Forecast Office, which meant the meteorologist in <b>charge</b> <b>at</b> Miami {{was no longer in}} a position above the hurricane center director. By 1988, the NHC gained responsibility for eastern Pacific tropical cyclones as the former Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center in San Francisco was decommissioned. In 1992, Hurricane Andrew blew the WSR-57 weather radar and the anemometer off the roof of NHC's/the Miami State Weather Forecast offices. The radar was replaced with a WSR-88D NEXRAD system in April 1993 installed near Metro Zoo, near where Hurricane Andrew made landfall.|$|E

5|$|After his recovery, d'Hautpoul {{was given}} {{command of the}} heavy cavalry of the Army of Sambre-et-Meuse under General Paul Grenier. After Neuwied, he was {{transferred}} to the Army of England under command of Lazare Hoche. When the French Directory abandoned the idea of an invasion of England, he was again deployed on the German front, this time as part of the Army of the Danube. After the French loss at the Battle of Ostrach, his Cavalry reserve protected the French retreat from Pfullendorf. A few days later, after failing to lead a timely <b>charge</b> <b>at</b> the Battle of Stockach, he was suspended on orders of the Army commander, Jean-Baptiste Jourdan, who blamed d'Hautpoul for the defeat. Acquitted by a court-martial in Strasbourg, d'Hautpoul resumed his duties at the end of July 1799, having missed the critical actions at the First Battle of Zurich.|$|E

40|$|Use of plug-in {{electric}} vehicle (PEV) <b>charging</b> infrastructure <b>at</b> six work sites in California varied from site to site, {{based on a}} number of factors that include the following:- The cost of charging- Employee commute distance- Demand for charging station use- Policies for how long a vehicle can be connected to workplace charging stations. In general, drivers with longer commutes tended to <b>charge</b> more often <b>at</b> work. However, some employees with short commutes still <b>charged</b> <b>at</b> work when cost was low. The work sites studied employed a mix of policies to manage charging station use, including levying fees for charging, requiring the use of a reservation system, providing employees tools to self-manage charging, and requiring drivers to move their vehicles upon completion of <b>charging.</b> <b>At</b> three work sites, the combination of policies employed effectively enabled numerous vehicles to frequently use a fixed number of <b>charging</b> stations. <b>At</b> the other three work sites, the combination of policies chosen resulted in infrequent vehicle <b>charging</b> <b>at</b> work...|$|R
