In Artificial Intelligence with Coalition Structure Generation (CSG) one {{refers to}} those {{cooperative}} complex problems that require {{to find an}} optimal partition (maximizing a social welfare) {{of a set of}} entities involved in a system.

Drawing Spandex to be a core yarn of covered yarn into the hollow spindles is so complicated that its automation is especially hoped. So we developed an auto drawing-in apparatus that could draw Spandex in both upper and lower hollow spindles simultaneously. Results obtained are as follows : (1) The auto drawing-in apparatus comprises both an injector and an ejector. Spandex was drawn into the lower spindle by the injection flow driven by the injector and was drawn from the upper spindle by the suction flow driven by the ejector. (2) Drawing-in was performed for a model <b>covering</b> <b>machine</b> by the developed auto-doffing apparatus. It could draw-in 20 D Spandex that was widely used and was too thin to be easily drawn-in even by a manual doffing operation. So this confirmed that the developed auto-doffing apparatus had practical utility in drawing -in operation. (3) The rates of success of Spandex drawing-in {{is influenced by the}} supplied air pressure for the injector, the supplied air pressure for the ejector and the feed rate of Spandex. High certainty of Spandex drawing-in could be accomplished by the proper arrangement of those conditions. 目的 ダブルカバリングマシンによるカバード糸製造時における中空スピンドルへの芯糸通しは作業上ネックとなっており, 自動化が期待されている。そこで上下の中空スピンドルに一度に芯糸を通すことのできる自動芯糸通し装置を開発する. 成果 (1) 一対の空気噴き出し口と空気吸い込み口により構成される芯糸通し装置を試作した. 装置は下スピンドル下部より噴き出し流を, 上スピンドル上部より吸い込み流を作用させることによって芯糸を中空スピンドルに引き通す.
