Riesser (1921) was the first to show that acetylcholine invoked a contractile response in striated muscle. This has been substantiated by Blair (1938), Hodges and Steinman (1939), and Brown (1937) on innervated and denervated amphibian and mammalian muscles. In general these authors agreed that the action of the drug is on the nerve-free muscle. However, Burns and Paton (1951) {{do not believe that the}} action is directly on the muscle but on the motor end plate. Kuffier (1943) working with the frog, states that the action of acetylcholine on denervated muscle is localized where the end plate would normally exist.

The constitutive model of the cutting load was build according to the experiment load, and the mechanical model of the rock was build too. Simultaneously, the mechanical model of the helical cutting mechanism cutting into the rock was build according to the actual working condition underground; and the cusp catastrophe model of the cutting process was build basing on the catastrophe analysis, the stiffness condition and the energy condition of the helical cutting mechanism cutting into the rock were acquired. Research results indicate that: the stiffness of the haulage system of the helical cutting mechanism must be smaller than the resistance stiffness of the rock, otherwise the strong vibration will be caused, and the helical cutting mechanism and the transmission system will be damaged too; the energy release rate of the helical cutting mechanism must be bigger than the required energy of the rock broken, or else the helical cutting mechanism will be lockout, even the <b>cutting</b> <b>motor</b> is damaged...|$|E

Questioning current beliefs concerning urban planning will help educate human kind and biofuel the Sustainable Revolution. This research paper provides reasoning for why bicycles should be treated as the new means of primary transportation. On average bikes are two times more efficient than other primary means of travel, compared to bus, car, and walking. Bikes require substantially less space than the Single Occupancy Vehicle, or SOV (which this report will generally use as an opposing factor). The primary issue for increasing ridership is that {{a large percentage of the}} human population may be interested in biking, but concerned due to safety. Rightly so. In the United States riding a bike in the urban setting in not yet supported by current social culture. This social culture may only be altered by educating people, providing the infrastructure for bikes, and encouraging ridership as a primary goal aimed at a sustainable future.

40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis {{deals with the}} recent development of a longwall simulation tool for analyzing shearer operations and estimating hourly and annual production output. In most cases longwall mining refers to underground coal extraction processes. Coal is mainly used for electricity and steel production. Therefore, the coal resource made a major contribution to the Total Primary Energy Supply - having an approximately one quarter share right after the oil, which provided nearly {{one third of the}} consumed energy in 2005. Compared to other fossil fuels, coal has the largest amount of proven mineral resources, which makes the average global coal production last for at least 137 years as estimated in 2006. Coal consumption is predicted to increase from 5. 3 Gt by approx. 1. 8 % per year on an average within the next 24 years. As parts of the expected amounts of mineral resources will be proven global coal mining is predicted to continue even for the next 160 - 190 years. Coal mining is divided into surface mining (approx. 40 %) and underground operations (approx. 60 %) which are drilling and blasting, room and pillar with continuous miners as well as shearer and plow longwall systems. Almost one third of the coal coming from deep mines is extracted by longwalls. Their main advantage is high productivity combined with low fatality numbers. Longwallsâ€™ share is expected to increase as safety and productivity is getting more and more important. Shearer longwall systems consist of the Shearer to extract and load the coal onto the Armored Face Conveyor (AFC), the AFC for conveying the coal to the main gate and the roof supports to protect miners and machinery from falling rock. Currently, there are five common shearer cutting methods which differ in cutting height and cutting web per shearerâ€™s pass. This results in different capacities and mass flows on the conveyor belts. According to those cutting methods, the Excel based algorithm divides the shearer movement into single steps along the coal face by calculating extracted masses and consumed time whilst taking possible bottle-necks into account like e. g. the <b>cutting</b> <b>motor</b> power. Finally the ratio of extracted coal and cycle time represents the capacity of the longwall system on an hourly basis. Considering the longwall crewsâ€™ schedule as well as machine availability, an annual output is estimated. This simulation tool is able to uncover system bottle-necks and it provides the user with expected production increase if one bottle-neck is removed. Additionally, it visualizes coal load on the belts which enables users to analyze their conveying systems. A second implemented shearer simulates two parallel running longwalls conveying coal on one common belt. The second machine can be operated in an automatic mode that corresponds to the first longwallâ€™s coal load reaching optimized belt utilization. The software was calibrated and verified in a coal mine of the Appalachian-Region. The following figures were calibrated: specific required energy for cutting and loading the coal, required pulling forces at the face and friction factors of upper and lower AFC races. The verification procedure contained a comparison of real and virtual shearer movements as well as a comparison of the real and calculated amount of coal coming from one shearerâ€™s pass. As a result of this study, a negligible difference of less than 6 % was detected in calculated and real mine data over an almost six week period. With regards to most of the evaluation criteria, the software performance is either good or excellent, particularly the distinguished precision. Only disadvantages are a less flexible algorithm and some unfavourable settings regarding maintenance and software extension while working with Excel. Fields of further software development are the shearer drum design, the roof support, the ventilation system and the longwall development which can be limiting factors to the shearer speed. The algorithm should also be updated for the latest inventions of cutting very large seams by utilizing Longwall Top Coal Caving methods and mining very low seams with longwall plow systems. Object oriented programming is regarded as the new software basis which tends to match better than Excel does regarding flexibility and user-friendly interfaces. To summarize: the described simulation tool is unique and can save {{a lot of time and}} money. It has outstanding capabilities in uncovering improvement potentials of shearer longwall systems that can be achieved only by changing cutting methods instead of installing bigger motor power...|$|E

Free hand saws do not feature a vise, because the materials being cut are larger and heavier.

40|$|The {{development}} of tetanus intoxication in the frog {{is dependent on}} the environ-mental temperature being above about 15 ". The incubation period and time to death become shorter as the environmental temperature is raised. Cooling below about 15 " prevents both the fixation of the toxin and its action after fixation but does not increase the speed at which the toxin is destroyed or excreted. The absorption of the toxin after injection into the dorsal lymph sac is not prevented by cooling. It is pos-sible to produce local tetanus in frogs by the intramuscular injection of tetanus toxin, but the dose needed for this is very critical. In most cases either generalized tetanus develops or there are no signs of intoxication. However, local tetanus can regularly be produced when the toxin is given intramuscularly to frogs partially protected from generalized tetanus by an injection of tetanus antitoxin given via the dorsal lymph sac. The local tetanus so produced does not progress to involve the opposite limb. The muscular spasm is abolished by <b>cutting</b> the <b>motor</b> nerve or by general anaesthesia. Tetanus toxin appears to act on the central nervous system of the frog {{in the same manner as}} in mammals.

40|$|Sequences of stereotyped {{actions are}} central to the {{everyday}} lives of humans and animals, from the kingfisher's dive to the performance of a piano concerto. Lashley asked how neural circuits managed this feat nearly 6 decades ago, and to this day it remains a fundamental question in neuroscience. Toward answering this question, vocal performance in the songbird was used as a model to study the performance of learned, stereotyped motor sequences. The first component of this work considers the song motor cortical zone HVC in the zebra finch, an area that sends precise timing signals to both the descending motor pathway, responsible for stereotyped vocal performance in the adult, and the basal ganglia, which is responsible for both motor variability and song learning. Despite intense interest in HVC, previous research has exclusively focused on describing the activity of small numbers of neurons recorded serially as the bird sings. To better understand HVC network dynamics, both single units and local field potentials were sampled across multiple electrodes simultaneously in awake behaving zebra finches. The local field potential and spiking data reveal a stereotyped spatio-temporal pattern of inhibition operating on a 30 ms time-scale that coordinates the neural sequences in principal cells underlying song. The second component addresses the resilience of the song circuit through <b>cutting</b> the <b>motor</b> cortical zone HVC in half along one axis. Despite this large-scale perturbation, the finch quickly recovers and sings a near-perfect song within a single day. These first two studies suggest that HVC is functionally organized to robustly generate neural dynamics that enable vocal performance. The final component concerns a statistical study of the complex, flexible songs of the domesticated canary. This study revealed that canary song is characterized by specific long-range correlations up to 7 seconds long-a time-scale more typical of human music than animal vocalizations. Thus, the neural sequences underlying birdsong must be capable of generating more structure and complexity than previously thought...|$|R

For this reason {{it would be useful}} if the {{actuation}} system of a wearable robot for lower limbs was able to recover energy thus improving portability. Presently, we recognize three promising technologies with energy recovery capabilities already available in the literature: the Series Elastic Actuator (SEA), the Clutchable Series Elastic Actuator (C-SEA), and the flywheel Infinitely Variable Transmission (F-IVT) actuator. In this paper, a simulation model based comparison of the performance of these actuators is presented. The focus is on two performance indexes: the energy consumed by the electric motor per gait and the peak torque/power requested to the electric motor. Both quantities are related to the portability of the device: the former affects the size of the batteries for a given desired range; the latter affects the size and the weight of the electric motor. The results show that, besides some well-explained limitations of the presented methodology, the C-SEA is the most energy efficient whereas the F-IVT allows <b>cutting</b> down the <b>motor</b> torque/peak power strongly.
