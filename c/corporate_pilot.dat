2500|$|Young had {{experimented with}} {{helicopter}} designs using mainly scale models, and in 1941 {{he approached the}} Bell Aircraft Corporation in Buffalo, New York. The company agreed to build a number of full-scale prototypes, and Young moved to Buffalo. With the main Bell factories immersed in war production, and to ensure a research and development program that was sufficiently private and free of distractions, Young and his team moved to the Buffalo suburb of Gardenville (West Seneca). The Ship 1 prototype's first serious mishap occurred near {{the very end of}} 1942 in captive testing, when a Bell <b>corporate</b> <b>pilot</b> asked to try the Ship 1, while not using a seat belt and hanging onto the controls instead to stay in the open cockpit - this captive flight attempt resulted in the rotor system [...] "going through resonance" [...] as designer Arthur Young had warned about, resulting in a [...] "bucking" [...] instability and accident which cracked the rotor blades loose. [...] The first free flight of Ship 1 was carried out on June 26, 1943, only the third American helicopter to fly.|$|E

His first endorsement came from Trippe, who was President of Pan Am at the time. Ueltschi stepped down as President of FlightSafety in 2003, yet remained Chairman.

40|$|The authors {{propose a}} de-cluttering {{technique}} {{to simplify the}} depiction of visually complex Area Navigation (RNAV) and Required Navigation Performance (RNP) procedures by {{reducing the number of}} paths shown on a single chart page. An experiment was conducted to determine whether charts with fewer paths (“Modified charts”) allow improved access to information in terms of time and accuracy compared with charts that are currently used (“Current charts”). Data were collected from 28 airline and 19 <b>corporate</b> <b>pilots.</b> Results show that pilot response times were significantly improved with the Modified charts. For approach procedures, the mean response time was 16. 9 seconds for Current charts and 10. 7 seconds for Modified charts. For departure procedures, the mean response time was 16. 2 seconds for Current charts and 13. 2 seconds for Modified charts. This difference in response time between Current and Modified charts was consistent across the different procedures (approach and departure), pilot types (Airline and Corporate), and chart manufacturers (FAA and Jeppesen) included in the study. Additionally, pilots answered questions correctly 99. 5 % of the time with no difference in response accuracy between Current and Modified charts. Note, this experiment only evaluated the potential benefit of separating paths across multiple pages and did not explore the drawbacks to this decluttering technique...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{goals of}} an {{economic}} entity are very diverse; generally, it will desire to maximize its results, while trying to pursue some goals characterizing {{different aspects of the}} activities it carries out. In {{order to be able to}} attain their goals, organizations manage diverse structures, entrusting the tasks to be carried out to different responsibility centers. In this context, management accounting constitutes an essential informational source for the firm's management, because: activities inevitably generate costs; the determination of the costs is able to explain the efficiency of the economic activity and to determine the deviations from the purpose proposed, while the information provided by the calculation of the costs is strategic information for <b>corporate</b> <b>piloting.</b> For decision making, the key word is relevance. The relevant character of the information from the cost domain allows one to know the economic activities that can influence the level, structure and subsequent evolution of the economic organization, so that every manager may receive significant information for the substantiation of his decisions within the skill and responsibility incumbent to him. During a period in which managerial calculation systems and economic applications are becoming commonplace in organizations, cost calculation using modern systems shapes the overall corporate management but also the management of each section or workshop, contributing to the increase of the responsibility of each cost-generating place...|$|R

5000|$|During {{the early}} days, Sylacauga had an {{extremely}} active airport thanks mostly to individuals that devoted {{their work and}} efforts to maintain, improve {{and add to the}} utility of the airport. Most of that work was created by the active FBO at the time, Robert [...] "Bob" [...] Smith. With an extremely positive attitude, Bob created numerous aircraft sales from his business efforts and developed a booming student pilot training center. Many of those students are beginning to retire now from positions as airline captains, <b>corporate</b> <b>pilots</b> and flight instructors. Later, in the very early 1960s, many of the town leaders were pilots, and they put plans together {{to take advantage of the}} push to build every small town an airport that Asa Roundtree started in the early 1950s. A new east/west airstrip was laid out between two adjacent land owners along the north end of the existing north/south airport where the Hagan Gothard airport was located. The airport officially opened in 1963 and was known as Lee Merkel Field. Lee Merkel Field has evolved from the original 3000 ft paved runway to the facility it is today. Kimberly Clark, Coosa Newsprint Division, moved some of their aircraft to the Sylacauga Airport and occupied a large hangar the City built to accommodate their needs. KC had a presence at the airport from the early 1970s well into the 1980s. They started off with a twin engine Cessna 340 and later added two jets to the fleet.|$|R

Putney would suffer from four other heart attacks before dying of his fifth in 2001. A brief stint as a businessman gave him the opportunity to briefly own a Budget Rental Car franchise. Putney would ultimately retire from any sort of business or flying after his first heart attack in 1979. When the air traffic controllers went on strike, he joined the FAA and took over their jobs from 1981 to 1990.|$|E
50|$|Federal Aviation Regulations in the U.S. require {{pilots and}} air traffic {{controllers}} to have periodic flight physicals in order to perform their aviation related duties. Authority for these laws comes from the CFR (Code of Federal Regulations) parts 61 and 67. Federal regulations describe three classes of medical certificates: Class 3 medical certificates are for private pilot duties only. They have the least restrictive medical requirements and the certificates are good for 5 years for applicants under age 40 and 2 years for those 40 and over. Class 2 medical certificates are for commercial, non-airline duties as well as private pilot duties. This certificate would be required of crop dusters, charter <b>pilots,</b> <b>corporate</b> <b>pilots,</b> and anyone else who flies commercially. The certificate is good for 1 year for commercial activities and 2 or 5 years for private pilot use based on age. Class 1 medical certificates are required for airline transport pilots who fly scheduled airliners. These are the most complex examinations and include electrocardiograms (EKGs). EKGs are required at the first Class 1 medical after the applicant turns 35 and then the first medical after age 40 and yearly thereafter. Class 1 certificates are good for airliner duties for 1 year for applicants under age 40 and 6 months for those 40 and over. Like the Class 2 certificate, however, these remain good for a full year for other commercial activities and 2 or 5 years for private pilot duties. Detailed medical requirements for each class of pilot exam are described in Code of Federal Regulations Part 67.|$|R
