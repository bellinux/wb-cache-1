40|$|The azaborine motif {{provides}} {{a unique opportunity}} to develop core isosteres by inserting B-N units in place of C=C bonds within aromatic scaffolds. These boron/nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic systems provide molecular frameworks that have similar, but not identical, geometrical shapes and electronic distributions to the analogous all carbon systems. Synthetic routes to the 1, 3, 2 -benzodiazaborole core have been developed utilizing entirely bench-stable starting materials, including organotrifluoroborates, enabling a wider array of substrate analogues under facile reaction conditions. The physical, structural, and electronic properties of these compounds were explored computationally to understand the influence of the B-N replacement on structure, aromaticity, and the isosteric viability of these analogues. The class of azaborininones could similarly be accessed from both organotrifluoroborates and boronic acids. An inexpensive, common reagent, SiO 2, was found to serve as both a fluorophile and desiccant to facilitate the annulation process across three different azaborininone platforms. Computationally-derived pK a values, NICS aromaticity calculations, and electrostatic potential surfaces revealed a unique isoelectronic/isostructural relationship between these azaborines and their carbon isosteres that changed based on boron connectivity. The 2, 1 -borazaronaphthalene motif can be accessed through robust methods of synthesis and subsequent functionalization strategies, affording an ideal platform to use for a variety of applications. However, the initial scope of substructures for this archetype has been limited by the lack of nitrogen-containing heteroaryls that can be incorporated within them. Modified reaction conditions enabled greater tolerance to provide access to a wider range of substructures. Additionally, computational and experimental studies of solvent decomposition demonstrate that substitution off boron is important to stability. ^ Post-annulation derivitization of the azaborine cores can allow access to higher order functionalized structures. A method for functionalizing the 2, 1 -borazaronaphthalene scaffold using ammonium alkylbis(catecholato) silicates via photoredox/nickel dual catalysis was found to be highly effective. By forging Csp 3 –C sp 2 bonds via this approach, alkyl fragments with various functional groups can be introduced to the azaborine core, affording previously inaccessible heterocyclic isosteres in good to excellent yields. These conditions provide sensitive functional group tolerance, even permitting the cross-coupling of unprotected primary and secondary amines. Regioselective C-H borylation and subsequent cross-coupling of the 2, 1 -borazaronaphthalene core could also be achieved. Although 2, 1 -borazaronaphthalene is closely related to naphthalene in terms of structure, the argument is made that the former has electronic similarities to indole. Based on that premise, iridium-mediated C-H activation has enabled facile installation of a versatile, nucleophilic <b>coupling</b> <b>handle</b> at a previously inaccessible site of 2, 1 -borazaronaphthalenes. A variety of substituted 2, 1 -borazaronaphthalene cores can be successfully borylated and further cross-coupled in a facile manner to yield diverse C(8) -substituted 2, 1 -borazaronaphthalenes. ...|$|E

Background: Previous research showed that lesbian <b>couples</b> <b>handle</b> the difference with regard to genetic relatedness by, for instance, creating a narrative about physical resemblances or by focusing on the social bond and its influence on children. Methods: The findings are based on qualitative in-depth interviews with 10 lesbian couples who had at least one donor-conceived child aged 7 - 10. Results: The difference with regard to the genetic link brought up complex and context-specific experiences for these parents. Generally, the genetic link was described as irrelevant: equality between both parents was presented as a given. However, some experiences of difference due to the presence of one genetic link were found. In these accounts, the genetic link was described as a valuable extra that created an inequality between them as parents.

Eight married couples residing in northeast Kansas were interviewed for this study. The participants were selected through a screening survey distributed to a university student body to collect basic demographics and couple relating styles.

A style of relating model – couple map was created to help couples visualize how they relate to their partners in terms of influence and closeness. This study begins to fill the gap in the research by creating an integrated model to understand couple relational patterns and by giving voice to couples and allowing them to share their experiences on how they share influence and maintain closeness in their relationships.

40|$|International audienceF-IDE 2016 is {{the third}} Formal Integrated Development Environment {{workshop}} (F-IDE 2016) held in Limassol, Cyprus, on November 8, 2016 as a satellite workshop of the FM conference. High levels of safety, security and also privacy standards {{require the use of}} formal methods to specify and develop compliant software (sub) systems. Any standard comes with an assessment process, which requires a complete documentation of the application in order to ease the justification of design choices and the review of code and proofs. An F-IDE dedicated to such developments should comply with several requirements. The first one is to associate a logical theory with a programming language, in a way that facilitates the tightly <b>coupled</b> <b>handling</b> of specification properties and program constructs. The second one is to offer a language/environment simple enough to be usable by most developers, even if they are not fully acquainted with higher-order logics or set theory, in particular by making development of proofs as easy as possible. The third one is to offer automated management of application documentation. It may also be expected that developments done with such an F-IDE are reusable and modular. Moreover, tools for testing and static analysis may be embedded in this F-IDE, to help address most steps of the assessment process.

40|$|Humans {{naturally}} coordinate {{upper and}} lower limb movements during rhythmic tasks. This innate coupling between {{upper and lower}} limbs has a neural basis that may be advantageous for gait rehabilitation. Adding upper limb effort to lower limb stepping could improve lower limb muscle recruitment during therapy. I developed a computer controlled recumbent stepping device with mechanically <b>coupled</b> <b>handles</b> and pedals to test principles of neural coupling of the arms and legs. Subjects drove the stepping motion using different combinations of upper and lower limb effort (active or passive). The first study demonstrated that upper limb effort increased passive lower limb muscle activation proportionally in neurologically intact individuals. These results indicated an excitatory neural coupling between {{the upper and lower}} limbs during rhythmic stepping movements. I then studied neurologically intact subjects performing maximal effort, velocity-controlled recumbent stepping. The results revealed that neural coupling between the upper and lower limbs is bidirectional and ipsilaterally biased. For the next study, I examined neural coupling in individuals with incomplete spinal cord injury to determine if adding upper limb effort enhanced muscle recruitment of volitionally maximally active lower limbs. The data indicated that maximal upper limb effort did not increase active lower limb muscle recruitment in individuals with incomplete spinal cord injury. Similar to neurologically intact individuals, spinal cord injured individuals also demonstrated increased passive lower limb muscle activation with greater upper limb effort. Lastly, I used computer simulations to examine potential neural mechanisms behind the upper and lower limb neural coupling. These models showed that excitatory sensory feedback, excitatory ipsilateral pathways, and supraspinal drive were all possible specific neural mechanisms explaining my empirical results. Future studies using more sophisticated neural techniques such as transcranial magnetic stimulation can test the specific neural mechanisms shown in the simulations. Overall, my findings provide a better understanding of interlimb neural coupling and have specific implications for the design of exercise therapies for gait rehabilitation after neurological injury...|$|R
