5|$|I think {{a strong}} {{case can be made}} that {{political}} assassination actually does change things. If you look at the assassinations in this country in the 1960s you can certainly see how it affected history in a very profound way. So if you killed right wing figures, you'd also be altering the course of history, and eliminating people who might very well be president in 1996 and those who are making bashing gays their number one issue right now. On the one hand, I'm not advocating PWA's turn themselves into human bombs, {{but on the other hand}} I have to admit that if I <b>clicked</b> <b>on</b> CNN and heard somebody had blown Patrick Buchanan's head clean off, I'd be elated, and to say otherwise would be a lie.|$|E
5|$|Players {{assume the}} role of a person {{suffering}} from depression, and the story centers on their daily life, including encounters at work and their relationship with their girlfriend. The story also features various treatments for depression. Players are periodically faced with choices that alter the course of the story. To make a choice, the player must click on the corresponding hyperlink. However, choices are often crossed out and cannot be <b>clicked</b> <b>on,</b> a mechanism that Depression Quest uses to portray the character's mental state and the fact that logical decisions may not be available to them. Beneath the choices presented to the player are a set of statements about the character, indicating their level of depression, {{whether or not they are}} in therapy, and whether or not they are currently on medication.|$|E
5|$|The game {{incorporates}} {{an inventory}} system for items that Sam picks {{up during the}} course of the game. Items can be used on other entities in the game world, or can often be combined with other inventory items to provide a new object necessary for solving a puzzle. Although Max's character will walk around the game's areas by his own will, Sam can also use Max at various points by using an inventory icon of Max's head on game objects—usually on characters where the solution to a problem involves violence. Sam and Max travel to different locations in the game using their black and white 1960 DeSoto Adventurer, which when <b>clicked</b> <b>on</b> in-game will present a map of the United States with all the available locations the pair can travel to shown. As the game progresses, the number of locations on the map increases.|$|E

25|$|In October 2010, Soghoian filed a {{complaint}} with the FTC, in which he claimed that Google was intentionally leaking search queries to the sites that users visited after they <b>clicked</b> <b>on</b> a link from the search results page. Two weeks later, a law firm filed a class action lawsuit against Google for this practice. The lawsuit extensively quoted from Soghoian's FTC complaint. In October 2011, Google stopped leaking search queries to the sites that users visited, and then in 2015, the company settled the search query leakage class action lawsuit for 8.5 million dollars.|$|E
25|$|Later on 25 June, an English Electric {{unit was}} listed on TradeMe, {{with a start}} price of $29,990. Initially {{thought to be a}} hoax, the train was 'bought' by a four-year-old who <b>clicked</b> <b>on</b> the 'Buy Now' for the train. The train was later sold for $30,000 on 2 July 2012 at 1:42pm when the auction closed. At the time no numbers had been given for the train sold as GWRC had nine two-car sets {{awaiting}} sale or scrap. The set purchased was eventually revealed as motor car DM 562 and trailer D 2149, which arrived in Nelson on 21 August 2012, after being transported by road from the Wellington railway yards onto the Interislander ferry the following day.|$|E

500|$|The second single, [...] "Your Time Has Come" [...] was {{released}} through a unique promotion, lasting one week, which involved radio listeners around the world.

According to VentureBeat reporter Matt Marshall, the redesign made the advertising [...] "cleaner" [...] {{and made it}} more obvious when {{someone was going to}} a third-party website like US Search. Marshall had previously criticized Whitepages, because website users that <b>clicked</b> <b>on</b> US Search ads and purchased data from US Search were sent through perpetual advertisements for other services that made it difficult to access the information they paid for. A local business lookup feature called [...] "Store Finder" [...] was added in June 2010. The following month, Whitepages.com launched a deal site, Dealpop.com, which differed from Groupon by offering short-term deals on nationally available products. Dealpop was sold to Tippr the following year.|$|E
500|$|As {{the player}} {{progresses}} through the game, the perspective changes from Will's, to Sarah's, to Mary's {{and finally to}} Harry's. Players passively select whether they see Sarah's or Mary's story first through a hidden choice (which room they walk into first early in the game). It becomes apparent that the story is not only based on Will's life, but also those of other characters and how they cope with his death. During Sarah's portrayal she says [...] "Let me set the scene..." [...] and during {{this part of the}} game the player clicks on objects that slowly turn the setting into a pub. After a few pieces of dialogue, the player clicks again to make it all disappear. During Harry's section, the player clicks on objects that remind Harry of Will. In some parts of the game, the player clicks on other characters to make them move forward, suggesting the idea of snapshots based on their memories. Once the player has <b>clicked</b> <b>on</b> enough objects, a meter becomes full and that triggers the next part of the game.|$|E

2500|$|When {{searching for}} videos of a {{different}} singer, Scooter Braun, a former marketing executive of So So Def Recordings, <b>clicked</b> <b>on</b> one of Bieber's 2007 videos by accident. Impressed, Braun tracked down the theatre Bieber was performing in, located Bieber's school, and finally contacted Mallette, who was reluctant because of Braun's Judaism. She remembered praying, [...] "God, I gave him to you. You could send me a Christian man, a Christian label!", and, [...] "God, you don't want this Jewish kid to be Justin's man, do you?" [...] However, church elders convinced her to let Bieber go with Braun. At 13, Bieber went to Atlanta, Georgia, with Braun to record demo tapes. Bieber began singing for Usher one week later.|$|E
2500|$|The Escape {{sequences}} {{were made}} {{to appeal to the}} players' instinctive desires; Uchikoshi wanted the player to experience the instinctive pleasure of [...] "I found it!". For the puzzles, Uchikoshi would think about the details within the overall story, and the gimmicks and props found in the game; after deciding on them, they were integrated with the puzzles. He would also use puzzle-related websites as reference. He did not handle puzzle design himself, instead leaving a lot of the direction to other staff, and checking it multiple times. Because of the puzzle–story integration, the development team tried to avoid situations where the player gets stuck due to being unable to solve a puzzle, by including hints that would appear if the player repeatedly <b>clicked</b> <b>on</b> items; as the player continues clicking, the hints get more obvious, to the point of almost revealing the solution outright. In the second game, a difficulty setting was added, with puzzles being easier to solve on lower settings.|$|E
2500|$|Qantas {{had studied}} the {{feasibility}} of the Dallas route for years. At {{the time of the}} Great Recession, Qantas' Sydney-San Francisco service became unprofitable, while an open skies agreement between Australia & the US flooded the market with more capacity. In the meantime, the Boeing 747-400ER aircraft were replaced with A380s on the Melbourne-LA route. According to Qantas CEO Alan Joyce: [...] "a lot of things <b>clicked</b> <b>on</b> this and it made absolute sense for us to devote aircraft resources to this destination." [...] By flying to Dallas, Qantas can offer passengers a 70-minute connection to domestic flights, which means onwards connections to cities like New York City, Chicago, Boston, and Miami can be up to two hours faster than transiting through Los Angeles. At launch, Qantas had codeshare agreements on 54 AA flights from DFW to cities in the US, Canada, & Mexico. When announcing the launch of A380 service, Qantas notes that DFW offers more than 30 codeshare destinations beyond the network available from Los Angeles. According to Qantas in 2014, the most popular destinations for connections with QF7 are Orlando, Boston, Houston, and New York's LaGuardia Airport.|$|E
