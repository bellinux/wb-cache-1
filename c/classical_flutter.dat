Effects of piezoelectric actuation for <b>classical</b> <b>flutter</b> suppression on wind turbine blade beam subjected to combined transverse shear deformation, warping restraint effect, and secondary warping are investigated. The extended Hamilton’s principle is used to set up the equations of motion, and the Galerkin method is applied to reduce the aeroelastic coupled equations into a state-space form. Active control is developed to enhance the vibrational behavior and dynamic response to classical aerodynamic excitation and stabilize structures that might be damaged in the absence of control.

40|$|Abstract: Due to {{the reduced}} {{separation}} between vertical and torsional natural modes, bridges with central spans beyond 1000 - 1500 m {{have to be}} designed with sophisticated aero-dynamic criteria, so that flutter instability happens at appropriately high wind speed. In order to obtain decks with adequate behavior under wind loads, refined metallic carpentries (e. g. boxes with curved shapes) have to be adopted. In fact, although streamlined decks {{are known to be}} an effective solution against <b>classical</b> <b>flutter</b> instabilities, sophisticated numerical and ex-perimental techniques to obtain an adequate aerodynamic optimization are often necessary, increasing the unit cost of the deck elements. The aim of the research proposed in this paper is to present some preliminary bridge designs, for which it is possible to obtain a total inhibi-tion of the <b>classical</b> <b>flutter</b> instability mechanism in the wind speed range of interest. The ba-sic idea is to avoid <b>classical</b> <b>flutter</b> by inverting the vertical bending and the torsional natural frequencies of the lower modes with similar shapes, that is to obtain torsional-to-vertical bending frequency ratios lower than one. This can be done by modifying the mass distribution over the deck with respect to the position of the suspension cables. Feasibility studies are shown, including analytical formulations, numerical strategies based on iterative non-linea...|$|E
40|$|Flight flutter {{testing is}} always carried {{out under the}} {{assumption}} that aircraft are linear. Recently, this assumption has started to come under question, especially as far as military aircraft are concerned. This paper deals with possible methodologies for flight flutter testing of aircraft that are no longer assumed linear. Simulated flight testing is performed for a simple non-linear aeroelastic system with cubic stiffness. The flutter speeds predicted using some of the <b>classical</b> linear <b>flutter</b> prediction methods as well as a non-linear method are compared. It is shown that, for non-linear system undergoing Hopf Bifurcations, <b>classical</b> linear <b>flutter</b> prediction can predict the flutter envelope with reasonable accuracy. However, fully non-linear system identification and stability analysis can not only predict the flutter point but also determine whether it is a linear or non-linear flutter point (i. e. whether divergent or Limit Cycle Oscillations will ensue). Additionally, the non-linear method can predict the amplitudes of LCOs that will occur post-critically. The application of the nonlinear method was successful for noise free data, but the problem of noise corruption still needs further investigation...|$|R
40|$|A {{study of}} rotor blade {{aeroelastic}} stability was carried out, using an analytic {{model of a}} two-dimensional airfoil undergoing dynamic stall and an elastomechanical representation including flapping, flapwise bending and torsional degrees of freedom. Results for a hovering rotor demonstrated that the models used are capable of reproducing both <b>classical</b> and stall <b>flutter.</b> The minimum rotor speed for the occurrence of stall flutter in hover, {{was found to be}} determined from coupling between torsion and flapping. Instabilities analogous to both <b>classical</b> and stall <b>flutter</b> were found to occur in forward flight. However, the large stall-related torsional oscillations which commonly limit aircraft forward speed appear to be the response to rapid changes in aerodynamic moment which accompany stall and unstall, rather than the result of an aeroelastic instability. The severity of stall-related instabilities and response was found to depend to some extent on linear stability. Increasing linear stability lessens the susceptibility to stall flutter and reduced the magnitude of the torsional response to stall and unstall...|$|R

40|$|The {{aeroelastic}} behaviour of a wing oscillating in the heave {{and pitch}} {{degrees of freedom}} is examined by means of wind tunnel experiment. The phenomena of interest are <b>classical</b> <b>flutter</b> and limit cycle oscillation. <b>Classical</b> <b>flutter</b> is normally associated with the exponential growth of the response amplitude. Linear flutter theory only predicts the critical flutter speed. Any excitation or disturbance beyond the critical speed is assumed to cause exponential growth in the response amplitude. In contrast, any limited amplitude oscillations occurring post-fultter suggest the existence of nonlinear properties in the system. Such properties can originate from the aerodynamic forces {{in the form of}} flow separation and reattachment. On the structural side, damping and stiffness can also contribute nonlinear properties. Furthermore, these nonlinearities can manifest themselves even at pre-flutter conditions, depending on the values of some governing parameter. The focus of the present work is the transformation of <b>classical</b> <b>flutter</b> into stall flutter as the equilibrium angle of attack of heaving and pitching wing is increased. The interaction of stall-related nonlinearity with structural nonlinearities is also of interest. The measured aeroelastic responses are analyzed and the bifurcation behavior of the dynamic system is characterized. Structural responses as well as flow field visualization through Particle Image Velocimetry show the origin of nonlinearity does not solely come from the manifestation of separation and the shedding of vortices, but from the structural nonlinearity which limits the response amplitude...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{explores the}} {{dynamical}} response of a two-degree-of-freedom flat plate undergoing <b>classical</b> coupled-mode <b>flutter</b> in a wind tunnel. Tests are performed at low Reynolds number (Re similar to 2. 5 x 10 (4)), using an aeroelastic set-up that enables high amplitude pitch-plunge motion. Starting from rest {{and increasing the}} flow velocity, an unstable behaviour is first observed at the merging of frequencies: after a transient growth period the system enters a low amplitude limit-cycle oscillation regime with slowly varying amplitude. For higher velocity the system transitions to higher-amplitude and stable limit cycle oscillations (LCO) with amplitude increasing with the flow velocity. Decreasing the velocity from this upper LCO branch the system remains in stable self-sustained oscillations down to 85 % of the critical velocity. Starting from rest, the system can also move toward a stable LCO regime if a significant perturbation is imposed. Those results show that both the flutter boundary and post-critical behaviour are affected by nonlinear mechanisms. They also suggest that nonlinear aerodynamic effects play a significant role.

Three types of instability were observed - <b>flutter</b> similar to <b>classical</b> bending-torsion <b>flutter,</b> divergence, and an uncoupled oscillatory instability which consists in nonviolent continuous or intermittent small-amplitude oscillations involving only angular deformations. The speeds at which this oscillatory instability starts {{were found to be}} as low as about one-third of the speed at flutter or divergence and to depend on the shape of the body, particularly that of the afterbody, and on the relative location of the elastic axis.

In this speed range, the flutter boundary is very sensitive to aerodynamic nonlinearities, typically requiring high-fidelity Navier-Stokes simulations.

40|$|The current HSR Aeroelasticity plan to design, build, {{and test}} a full span, free flying {{transonic}} flutter {{model in the}} TDT has many technical obstacles that must be overcome for a successful program. One technical obstacle is the determination of a suitable configuration and point in the sky to use in setting the scaling point for the ASE models program. Determining this configuration and point in the sky requires balancing several conflicting requirements, including model buildability, tunnel test safety, {{and the ability of}} the model to represent the flutter mechanisms of interest. As will be discussed in detail in subsequent sections, the current TCA design exhibits several flutter mechanisms of interest. It has been decided that the ASE models program will focus on the low frequency symmetric flutter mechanism, and will make no attempt to investigate high frequency flutter mechanisms. There are several reasons for this choice. First, it is believed that the high frequency flutter mechanisms are similar in nature to <b>classical</b> wing bending/torsion <b>flutter,</b> and therefore there is more confidence that this mechanism can be predicted using current techniques. The low frequency mode, on the other hand, is a highly coupled mechanism involving wing, body, tail, and engine motion which may be very difficult to predict. Second, the high frequency flutter modes result in very small weight penalties (several hundred pounds), while suppression of the low frequency mechanism inside the flight envelope causes thousands of pounds {{to be added to the}} structure. In order to successfully test the low frequency flutter mode of interest, a suitable starting configuration and point in the sky must be identified. The configuration and point in the sky must result in a wind tunnel model that (1) represents the low-frequency wing/body/engine/empennage flutter mechanisms that are unique to HSCT configurations, (2) flutters at an acceptably low frequency in the tunnel, (3) flutters at an acceptably low dynamic pressure in the tunnel, (4) allows sufficient weight for model buildability without inordinately high cost, and (5) has significant separation between the target flutter mechanism and other, potentially catastrophic, flutter mechanisms...|$|R

The numerical scheme models the entire fluid-structure system as a single continuum dynamics problem, by using a mixed Eulerian-Lagrangian formulation.

The results from this study indicate that the shock dynamics gives rise to limit cycles and highly nonlinear aeroelastic phenomena, such as weak divergence and flutter-divergence interactions. Although the shocks typically are destabilizing at the linear flutter boundary, they often have a strongly stabilizing effect for moderate-amplitude motions. The shocks are thus capable of quenching an emerging bending-torsion flutter motion and turning it into limit cycle flutter.

The flutter came in suddenly and all blades vibrated at the same frequency but at different amplitudes and with a common predominant phase angle between consecutive blades. This further indicates aerodynamic coupling between blades. The flutter frequency was between the first two blade normal modes, signifying an aerodynamic coupling between the normal modes. Flutter was observed at all blade pitch angles from small to large angles-of-attack of the blades. A strong blade response occurred, for four blades at the two-per-revolution (2 P) frequency, when the rotor speed was near the crossing of the flutter mode frequency and the 2 P order line.

Three different types of flutter instability boundaries were encountered, a <b>classical</b> <b>flutter</b> boundary, a transonic stall flutter boundary at angle of attack, and a plunge instability near M = 0. 9 and for zero angle of attack. This test was made in air and was Transonic Dynamics Tunnel (TDT) Test 468. The BSCW model (for Benchmark SuperCritical Wing) was tested next as TDT Test 470. It was tested using both with air and a heavy gas, R- 12, as a test medium. The effect of a transition strip on flutter was evaluated in air. The B 64 AOlO model was subsequently tested as TDT Test 493. Some further analysis of the experimental data for the BOO 12 wing is presented. Transonic calculations using the parameters for the BOO 12 wing in a two-dimensional typical section flutter analysis are given. These data are supplemented with data from the Benchmark Active Controls Technology model (BACT) given {{and in the next}} chapter of this document. The BACT model was of the same planform and airfoil as the BOO 12 model, but with spoilers and a trailing edge control. It was tested in the heavy gas R- 12, and was instrumented mostly at the 60 per cent span. The flutter data obtained on PAPA and the static aerodynamic test cases from BACT serve as additional data for the BOO 12 model. All three types of flutter are included in the BACT Test Cases.

Only the mean pressures and the real and imaginary parts of the first harmonic of the pressures are included in the data for the test cases, but digitized time histories have been archived. The data for the test cases are available as separate electronic files. An overview of the model and tests is given, the standard formulary for these data is listed, and some sample results are presented...|$|E
40|$|There is {{a growing}} {{interest}} in extracting more power per turbine by increasing the rotor size in offshore wind turbines. As a result, the turbine blades will become longer and therefore more flexible and a flexible blade is susceptible to flow-induced instabilities, such as <b>classical</b> <b>flutter.</b> In order to design and build stable large wind turbine blades, the onset of instability {{should be considered in}} the design process. To observe flow-induced instabilities in wind turbine blades, a small-scale flexible blade was built based on NREL 5 MW reference wind turbine blade. The blade was placed in the test section of a wind tunnel and its tip displacement was measured using a non-contacting displacement measurement device. The blade was non-rotating and was subjected to uniform incoming flow. For a range of blade angles of attack, instability was observed beyond a critical wind speed. The amplitude of oscillations increases for wind speeds higher than the critical speed, and the frequency of oscillations remains constant. Flow visualizations and force measurements are conducted and the influence of various system parameters including the angle of attack and the blade twist was examined...|$|E
40|$|As the {{technology}} for horizontal axis wind turbines (HAWT) development matures, more novel techniques are required for the capture of additional amounts of energy, alleviation of loads {{and control of the}} rotor. One such technique employs the use of an adaptive blade that could sense the wind velocity or rotational speed in some fashion and accordingly modify its aerodynamic configuration to meet a desired objective. This could be achieved in either an active or passive manner, although the passive approach is much more attractive due to its simplicity and economy. As an example, a blade design might employ coupling between bending and/or extension, and twisting so that, as it bends and extends due to the action of the aerodynamic and inertial loads, it also twists modifying the aerodynamic performance in some way. These performance modifications also have associated aeroelastic effects, including effects on aeroelastic instability. To address the scope and magnitude of these effects a tool has been developed for investigating <b>classical</b> <b>flutter</b> and divergence of HAWT blades. As a starting point, an adaptive version of the uniform Combined Experiment Blade will be investigated. Flutter and divergence airspeeds will be reported {{as a function of the}} strength of the coupling and also be compared to those of generic blade counterparts...|$|E
40|$|Future {{horizontal}} axial {{wind turbines}} that approach the 10 MW capacity {{will have a}} rotor diameter somewhere {{in the order of}} 170 m. Their loads could be much higher and their blades more flexible compared to current multi-MW wind turbines, most probably resulting in aeroelastic instabilities not commonly seen in the machines of today. The likely design drivers for future 10 MW+ wind turbines are fatigue life and aeroelastic stability. To help improve the fatigue life and the aeroelastic stability, load control could be applied to future wind turbines. This paper concerns the load control concept of an actuated trailing edge flap (TEF), focusing on the effects they have on the aeroelastic stability of a blade. In particular, the two degree of freedom Flap-Torsion Flutter instability-Classical Flutter- is studied. A modal representation of the turbine dynamics (eigenmodes and eigenfrequencies), an unsteady BEM model and a simple controller for the actuated trailing edge are coupled to form an aero-servo-elastic model. Its unsteady airfoil model is based on Theodorsen’s theory, modified to include the effects of unsteady trailing edge flap deflections. The aero-servo-elastic model of the wind turbine is designed with the intention to capture the <b>Classical</b> <b>Flutter</b> instability. It is demonstrated that an extension of the stable operating range beyon...|$|E
