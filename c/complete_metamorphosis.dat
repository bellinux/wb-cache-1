5|$|Some of {{the oldest}} and most {{successful}} insect groups, such Endopterygota, use a system of <b>complete</b> <b>metamorphosis.</b> <b>Complete</b> <b>metamorphosis</b> is unique to a group of certain insect orders including Diptera, Lepidoptera and Hymenoptera. This form of development is exclusive and not seen in any other arthropods.|$|E
5|$|In {{common with}} other members of the {{superorder}} Holometabola, Lepidoptera undergo <b>complete</b> <b>metamorphosis,</b> going through a four-stage life cycle: egg, larva / caterpillar, pupa / chrysalis, and imago (plural:imagines) / adult.|$|E
5|$|Metamorphosis in insects is the {{biological}} process of development all insects must undergo. There are {{two forms of}} metamorphosis: incomplete metamorphosis and <b>complete</b> <b>metamorphosis.</b>|$|E

5|$|Like all ants, banded sugar ants begin life as eggs. If the egg is fertilised, the ant {{becomes a}} female; if not, {{it will become}} a male. They develop through <b>complete</b> <b>metamorphosis,</b> meaning that they pass through a larval and pupal stage before {{emerging}} as adults.|$|E
5|$|Like other ants, Myrmecia ants {{begin as}} an egg. If the egg is fertilised, the ant becomes a diploid female; if not, {{it becomes a}} haploid male. They develop through <b>complete</b> <b>metamorphosis,</b> meaning that they pass through larval and pupal stages before {{emerging}} as adults.|$|E
5|$|Holometabolism, or <b>complete</b> <b>metamorphosis,</b> {{is where}} the insect changes in four stages, an egg or embryo, a larva, a pupa and the adult or imago. In these species, an egg hatches to produce a larva, which is {{generally}} worm-like in form. This worm-like form {{can be one of}} several varieties: eruciform (caterpillar-like), scarabaeiform (grub-like), campodeiform (elongated, flattened and active), elateriform (wireworm-like) or vermiform (maggot-like). The larva grows and eventually becomes a pupa, a stage marked by reduced movement and often sealed within a cocoon. There are three types of pupae: obtect, exarate or coarctate. Obtect pupae are compact, with the legs and other appendages enclosed. Exarate pupae have their legs and other appendages free and extended. Coarctate pupae develop inside the larval skin. Insects undergo considerable change in form during the pupal stage, and emerge as adults. Butterflies are a well-known example of insects that undergo <b>complete</b> <b>metamorphosis,</b> although most insects use this life cycle. Some insects have evolved this system to hypermetamorphosis.|$|E
50|$|Mussels have {{separate}} sexes. Once the sperm and eggs are fully developed they are {{released into the}} water column for fertilization. Although there are about 10,000 sperm per egg, large proportions of eggs deposited by blue mussel are never fertilized. As few as 1% of larvae that do mature ever reach adulthood, the majority are eaten by predators before <b>completing</b> <b>metamorphosis.</b>|$|R
50|$|Eggs develop quickly, {{hatching}} {{in a mere}} 24 to 36 hours. The tadpole {{reaches a}} maximum length of 18 to 19.4 mm. It is grayish olive or grape-green dorsally and purplish ventrally. The tail has 6 or 7 black saddle marks. The tadpole <b>completes</b> <b>metamorphosis</b> into a juvenile toadlet in 4 to 6 weeks, and it reaches adulthood and sexual maturity at 1.5 to 2.3 years of age.|$|R

5|$|Laevistrombus {{canarium}} {{lives on}} muddy and sandy bottoms, grazing on algae and detritus. It is gonochoristic and sexually dimorphic, depending on internal fertilization for spawning. Larvae {{of this species}} spend several days as plankton, undergoing a series of transformations until they reach <b>complete</b> <b>metamorphosis.</b> The maximum life span is 2 to 2.5 years. Predators of this snail include carnivorous gastropods such as cone snails and volutes. It is also a prey species for vertebrates including macaques, and also humans, who consume the soft parts {{in a wide variety}} of dishes.|$|E
5|$|Siphonaptera is a {{relatively}} small order of insects: members of the order undergo <b>complete</b> <b>metamorphosis</b> and are secondarily wingless (their ancestors had wings which modern forms have lost). In 2005, Medvedev listed 2005 species in 242 genera, and despite subsequent descriptions of new species, bringing the total up to around 2500 species, {{this is the most}} complete database available. The order is divided into four infraorders and eighteen families. Some families are exclusive to a single host group; these include the Malacopsyllidae (armadillos), Ischnopsyllidae (bats) and Chimaeropsyllidae (elephant shrews).|$|E
5|$|Beetles {{are members}} of the {{superorder}} Endopterygota, and accordingly most of them undergo <b>complete</b> <b>metamorphosis.</b> The typical form of metamorphosis in beetles passes through four main stages: the egg, the larva, the pupa, and the imago or adult. The larvae are commonly called grubs and the pupa sometimes is called the chrysalis. In some species, the pupa may be enclosed in a cocoon constructed by the larva towards the end of its final instar. Some beetles, such as typical members of the families Meloidae and Rhipiphoridae, go further, undergoing hypermetamorphosis in which the first instar {{takes the form of a}} triungulin.|$|E

Thomas Taylor published an influential translation of Cupid and Psyche in 1795, several years before his <b>complete</b> <b>Metamorphoses.</b> A translation by Robert Graves appeared in 1951 as The Transformations of Lucius Otherwise Known as THE GOLDEN ASS, A New Translation by Robert Graves from Apuleius, published by Farrar, Straus & Giroux, New York.|$|R
40|$|Previous work {{of others}} and ours has shown that corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) is a {{positive}} stimulus for thyroid and interrenal hormone secretion in amphibian larvae and that activation of CRH neurons may mediate environmental effects on the timing of metamorphosis. These studies have investigated CRH actions in anurans (frogs and toads), whereas there is currently no information regarding the actions of CRH on metamorphosis of urodeles (salamanders and newts). We tested the hypothesis that CRH can accelerate metamorphosis of tiger salamander (Ambystoma tigrinum) larvae. We injected tiger salamander larvae with ovine CRH (oCRH; 1 Μg/day; i. p.) and monitored effects on metamorphosis by measuring the rate of gill resorption. oCRH-injected larvae <b>completed</b> <b>metamorphosis</b> earlier than saline-injected larvae. There {{was no significant difference}} between uninjected and saline-injected larvae. Mean time to reach 50 % reduction in initial gill length was 6. 9 days for oCRH-injected animals, 11. 9 days for saline-injected animals, and 14. 1 days for uninjected controls. At the conclusion of the experiment (day 15), all oCRH-injected animals had <b>completed</b> <b>metamorphosis,</b> whereas by day 15, only 50 % of saline-injected animals and 33 % of uninjected animals had metamorphosed. Our results show that exogenous oCRH can accelerate metamorphosis in urodele larvae as it does in anurans. These findings suggest that the neuroendocrine mechanisms controlling metamorphosis are evolutionarily conserved across amphibian taxa. © 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|R

5|$|Like every ant, {{the life}} of a jack jumper ant starts from an egg. If the egg is fertilised, the ant will be a female (diploid); if not, it will become a male (haploid). They develop through <b>complete</b> <b>metamorphosis,</b> meaning that they pass through a larva and pupa stage before {{emerging}} as an adult. Cocoons that are isolated from the colony are able to shed their pupal skin before hatching, allowing themselves to advance to full pigmentation. Newborns can also eclose (emerge from their pupa stage) without assistance from other ants. Once born, jack jumper ants can identify distinct tasks, an obvious primitive trait Myrmecia ants are known for.|$|E
5|$|Termites {{are among}} the most {{successful}} groups of insects on Earth, colonising most landmasses except for Antarctica. Their colonies range in size from a few hundred individuals to enormous societies with several million individuals. Termite queens have the longest lifespan of any insect in the world, with some queens reportedly living up to 30 to 50 years. Unlike ants, which undergo a <b>complete</b> <b>metamorphosis,</b> each individual termite goes through an incomplete metamorphosis that proceeds through egg, nymph, and adult stages. Colonies are described as superorganisms because the termites form part of a self-regulating entity: the colony itself.|$|E
5|$|Diptera {{go through}} a <b>complete</b> <b>metamorphosis</b> with four {{distinct}} life stages – egg, larva, pupa and adult. In many flies, the larval stage is long and adults may have a short life. Most dipteran larvae develop in protected environments; many are aquatic and others are found in moist places such as carrion, fruit, vegetable matter, fungi and, {{in the case of}} parasitic species, inside their hosts. They tend to have thin cuticles and become desiccated if exposed to the air. Apart from the Brachycera, most dipteran larvae have sclerotinised head capsules, which may be reduced to remnant mouth hooks; the Brachycera, however, have soft, gelatinized head capsules from which the sclerites are reduced or missing. Many of these larvae retract their heads into their thorax.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Thyroid hormones (TH) induce gene {{expression}} programs that orchestrate amphibian metamorphosis. In contrast to anurans, many salamanders do not undergo metamorphosis in nature. However, {{they can be}} induced to undergo metamorphosis via exposure to thyroxine (T 4). We induced metamorphosis in juvenile Mexican axolotls (Ambystoma mexicanum) using 5 and 50 nM T 4, collected epidermal tissue from the head at four time points (Days 0, 2, 12, 28), and used microarray analysis to quantify mRNA abundances. Results Individuals reared in the higher T 4 concentration initiated morphological and transcriptional changes earlier and <b>completed</b> <b>metamorphosis</b> by Day 28. In contrast, initiation of metamorphosis was delayed in the lower T 4 concentration {{and none of the}} individuals <b>completed</b> <b>metamorphosis</b> by Day 28. We identified 402 genes that were statistically differentially expressed by ≥ two-fold between T 4 treatments at one or more non-Day 0 sampling times. To complement this analysis, we used linear and quadratic regression to identify 542 and 709 genes that were differentially expressed by ≥ two-fold in the 5 and 50 nM T 4 treatments, respectively. Conclusion We found that T 4 concentration affected the timing of {{gene expression}} and the shape of temporal gene expression profiles. However, essentially all of the identified genes were similarly affected by 5 and 50 nM T 4. We discuss genes and biological processes that appear to be common to salamander and anuran metamorphosis, and also highlight clear transcriptional differences. Our results show that gene expression in axolotls is diverse and precise, and that axolotls provide new insights about amphibian metamorphosis. </p...|$|R
5|$|The {{life cycle}} of a bee, be it a solitary or social species, {{involves}} the laying of an egg, the development through several moults of a legless larva, a pupation stage during which the insect undergoes <b>complete</b> <b>metamorphosis,</b> followed {{by the emergence of}} a winged adult. Most solitary bees and bumble bees in temperate climates overwinter as adults or pupae and emerge in spring when increasing numbers of flowering plants come into bloom. The males usually emerge first and search for females with which to mate. The sex of a bee is determined by whether or not the egg is fertilised; after mating, a female stores the sperm, and determines which sex is required at the time each individual egg is laid, fertilised eggs producing female offspring and unfertilised eggs, males. Tropical bees may have several generations in a year and no diapause stage.|$|E
5|$|Beetles {{typically}} have a particularly hard exoskeleton including the elytra, though {{some such as}} the rove beetles have very short elytra while blister beetles have softer elytra. The general anatomy of a beetle is quite uniform and typical of insects, although there are several examples of novelty, such as adaptations in water beetles which trap air bubbles under the elytra for use while diving. Beetles are endopterygotes, {{which means that they}} undergo <b>complete</b> <b>metamorphosis,</b> with a series of conspicuous and relatively abrupt changes in body structure between hatching and becoming adult after a relatively immobile pupal stage. Some, such as stag beetles, have a marked sexual dimorphism, the males possessing enormously enlarged mandibles which they use to fight other males. Many beetles are aposematic, with bright colours and patterns warning of their toxicity, while others are harmless Batesian mimics of such insects. Many beetles, including those that live in sandy places, have effective camouflage.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the tadpole phase, {{hind legs}} appear, {{followed}} by front limbs, and the phase ends when the front limbs are developed. This normally occurs between October and April due to the breeding season, but tadpoles been observed in the wild throughout the year, suggesting some tadpoles overwinter; this has been seen to occur for captive tadpoles. The length of the tadpole stage, in the wild and in captivity, is usually between 10 and 12 weeks, but can range from five weeks to a year. The slower-growing tadpoles usually progress during winter, as there is a positive correlation between growth rates and temperatures. Variation in growth rate across pH values of 4, 7 and 9 was insignificant. In the first four weeks, there was no significant dependence of the growth rate across the 18–26°C range, but from this point on, growth was significantly hindered at 18°C. At the beginning of the metamorphing stage, all limbs are present and developed, along with a tail. During this phase, the tail is resorbed, and the only other visible change is the spiracle closing. Metamorphing tadpoles typically have a SVL of 22–28mm, and will <b>complete</b> <b>metamorphosis</b> between two and 11 months, depending on the temperature of the water and available food. The process is slowed at low temperatures, but generally takes between three and eight days after the tadpole stage is complete. Breeding occurs in a significantly higher proportion of sites where no predatory fish are present, and water bodies are ephemeral rather than permanent. Populations in Victoria, however, have been recorded as breeding in permanent ponds as readily as they do in ephemeral ponds.|$|E
