50|$|The {{most widely}} used {{potassium}} fertilizer is potassium <b>chloride</b> (muriate <b>of</b> <b>potash).</b> Other inorganic potassium fertilizers include potassium nitrate, potassium sulfate, and monopotassium phosphate. Potassium-rich treatments suitable for organic farming include feeding with home-made comfrey liquid, adding seaweed meal, composted bracken, and compost rich in decayed banana peels. Wood ash also has high potassium content. Adequate moisture is necessary for effective potassium uptake; low soil water reduces K uptake by plant roots. Liming acidic soils can increase potassium retention in some soils by reducing leaching; practices that increase soil organic matter can also increase potassium retention.|$|R

50|$|Belarus has a {{large number}} <b>of</b> <b>potash</b> {{deposits}} - all formed during the Famennian stage of the Late Devonian epoch - with commercial reserves of 10 billion metric tonnes. Three main potash deposits have been explored - Starobin (Старобінскае, Старобинское), Petrikov (Петрыкаўскае, Петриковское) and Oktyabrsky (Акцябрскае, Октябрьское). Sylvinite (potash ore) from these three deposits contains up to 28%, 40% and 39% KCl respectively. Amounts of MgCl2 vary from 0.15-0.3% in Starobin to 1.5-4% in Petrikov and more than 5% in Oktyabrsky. The Starobin deposit has 2.6 billion tonnes of proven reserves (A, B, C1 categories) and 600 million tonnes of prognosed reserves (C2 category) <b>of</b> <b>potash.</b> Reserves at the Petrikov deposit are estimated at 2.12 billion tonnes (C1 and C2 categories) <b>of</b> <b>potash.</b> The Oktyabrsky deposit has 637 million tonnes <b>of</b> <b>potash</b> (C1 and C2) and 1.1 billion tonnes of carnallite. Only the Starobin deposit is used, but in 2014 construction of the first factory in the Petrikov deposit began.
