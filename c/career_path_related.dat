As a result, individual perceptions of <b>career</b> <b>paths</b> may impact job satisfaction, career commitment, and performance. The {{purpose of this study was}} to test a career development model examining the path of relationships amongst autonomy/prestige, <b>career</b> <b>path,</b> training and learning, job satisfaction, career commitment, and performance for moderately defined career professionals. Based on a systematic categorization of careers, from well defined to less well defined, project managers were determined to have moderately defined careers. The researcher employed a survey resulting in 644 project manager respondents. Path analysis was effectuated as a modeling technique to determine whether there was a pattern of intercorrelations among variables. A career development model framing the relationship between project managers?????? perceptions of their <b>career</b> <b>paths</b> on their respective performance was explored.

40|$|The study {{presented}} by Pallarés, Azocar, Torregrosa, Selva, and Ramis (2011) proposed {{three types of}} sport career paths: i) linear: where the athlete gives exclusive dedication to sport; ii) convergent: in which the athlete prioritises the sport career but he/she maintains another activity (i. e., study or work); and iii) parallel: where the athlete places equal importance on the sport career and the alternative activity. Particularly, the available research {{has been focused on}} how athletes who follow a ?dual career? (DC) are less likely to suffer difficulties regarding their social and labor market integration after their sport career (Tekav, Wylleman, & Cecir Erpic, 2015). Thus, the aims of the present study were to analyze whether the type of <b>career</b> <b>path</b> chosen is <b>related</b> to: i) their academic level, ii) the labor market integration; and iii) the difficulties experienced after the retirement. Methods An adaptation of the Athlete?s Retirement Questionnaire (Alfermann, Stambulova & Zemaityte, 2004) was fulfilled by 178 retired athletes (n= 109 male and n= 69 female; 39 ± 7 years). Results Most of the athletes combined the studies and sport while they were at the mastery stage of their sport career, in the convergent (40. 1 %) or in the parallel (30. 5 %) way. Only 15. 3 % of the athletes were focused solely on the sport. The <b>career</b> <b>path</b> was not independent of the gender. More female than male combined studies and sport in a parallel way (39. 1 % vs. 25. 0 %) while more male than female followed a DC combined with their work (18. 5 % vs. 7. 2 %) or were focused solely on the sport (20. 4 % vs. 7. 2 %). Significant differences were found regarding the academic level reached according to the model chosen for male but not for female. The male athletes who followed a <b>career</b> <b>path</b> combining the studies and the sport in a convergent or in a parallel way reached a higher academic level than those who were focused solely on the sport and those who combined working and the sport. In addition, the results showed that 87. 0 % of the male and 89. 9 % of the female athletes were employed and no differences were found in the income level of the athletes according to the <b>career</b> <b>path.</b> Neither gender nor <b>career</b> <b>path</b> were <b>related</b> to the difficulties experienced after the retirement. The most important difficulties perceived by the athletes were the financial (2. 35 ± 1. 43) and social-relationships problems (2. 18 ± 1. 40). Conclusions The <b>career</b> <b>path</b> followed during the mastery stage does not {{make a difference in the}} quality of life after the sport career. The results point out that combining the sports with the studies ensures the achievement of higher education studies for male athletes.

40|$|Research Topic/Aim: Horizontal gender inequalities {{appear to}} be rather stable, with girls more often {{choosing}} ‘female' service professions, and boys choosing <b>career</b> <b>paths</b> <b>related</b> to science, technology, engineering or mathematics, since measures to bring more women into typical ‘male' jobs and more men into typical ‘female' jobs did not {{turn out to be}} sustainable. This paper focuses on gender stereotypes, namely non-egalitarian patriarchal gender-role orientations and gender associations of the school subjects German and mathematics. Dealing with and abolishing such gender stereotypes may be key strategy to reach sustainability regarding more equal vocational choices. Thus, gender stereotypes will be theorised and empirically analysed as a major predictor of gender-typical vocational perspectives considering interest in these school subjects as a mediating factor. Furthermore, we focus on structural patriarchy as a root of gender-role orientations, and teacher gender regarding its impact on gendered images of subjects. Theoretical and methodology framework: Our analyses of gender segregation in vocational aspirations and vocational choice center on Gottfredson's (2002; Gottfredson and Becker, 1981) Theory of Circumscription, Compromise and Self-Creation. One of the main assumptions of this theory is that people associate jobs with particular sexes and those jobs that do not fit particular gender roles are not considered. Empirical analyses are based on survey data of eighth-graders in the Swiss canton of Bern (N = 672). Structural Equation Models (SEM) for male and female students are estimated. Conclusions/Findings: Results reveal different patterns for boys and girls; for boys, gender-typical (male) vocational perspective could be explained via gender role orientations, interest in mathematics and gender associations of the school subjects, for girls, the factors under consideration could be empirically linked to ‘atypical vocational perspective'. Relevance to Nordic educational research: The study focuses on gender relations in society and how they are reproduced. Gender segregation in vocational choice and at the labour market is a universal issue - affecting both egalitarian and non-egalitarian gender regimes in similar ways. Although in general Northern countries {{appear to be}} more equal regarding gender inequality, gender segregation is rather persistent (Jarman, Blackburn and Brooks, 2012) and therefore remains a relevant topic...|$|R
40|$|Background: Horizontal gender inequalities {{appear to}} be rather stable, with girls more often {{choosing}} ‘female’ service professions, and boys choosing <b>career</b> <b>paths</b> <b>related</b> to science, technology, engineering or Mathematics. Purpose: Non-egalitarian patriarchal gender-role orientations and gender associations (perceived femininity) of the school subjects German Language Arts and Mathematics are theorised – triangulating different theoretical backgrounds – and empirically analysed as a major predictor of gender-typical vocational aspirations, considering interest in these school subjects as a mediating factor. Furthermore, we focus on a patriarchal relation of father’s and mother’s workforce participation as a root of gender-role orientations, and teacher gender in regard to its impact on gendered images of subjects. Sample: Empirical analyses are based on survey data from eighth-graders (around the ages of 14 and 15 {{at the time of}} data gathering) in the Swiss canton of Bern. The sample only encompasses children from two-parent families, as patriarchality in terms of differences in workforce participation between father and mother is taken into account. Design and methods: The research issues are analysed employing structural equation models. The statistical package Mplus allows for an analysis of the two dependent dichotomous variables ‘gender-typical vocational aspiration’ and ‘gender-atypical vocational aspiration’. The hierarchic structure of the sample (school class clusters) is taken into account. Results: Findings reveal different patterns for boys and girls; for boys, gender-typical (male) vocational aspiration could be explained to a small extent via gender-role orientations, interest in Mathematics and gender associations of school subjects; for girls, the factors under consideration could be empirically linked to ‘atypical vocational aspiration’. Teacher gender only has an impact among girls: if girls are taught by a female Mathematics teacher, they perceive the subject as a bit more female and show a higher interest in this subject. Their likelihood of having a gender-atypical vocational aspiration is a bit higher than among girls with a male Mathematics teacher who perceive the subject as a bit less female and, thus, show somewhat lower interest in this subject. Conclusions: There are still links – although weak – between gender stereotypes and vocational aspirations. Gender-role orientations are rooted in the family. A sensitisation towards gender stereotypes and their impact on aspirations and career would {{appear to be}} meaningful in broadening the vocational perspectives of men and women...|$|R

This paper reports on the experiences of 19 Australian directors of academic development who retired between 2002 and 2007.

40|$|In {{this article}} career {{preferences}} of medical {{specialists in the}} Netherlands are analysed, based on a survey {{among the members of}} medical associations of five specialities. Four different career preferences were offered, each of which implied a possible variation in working hours. A questionnaire was sent to a random selected group of working specialists in general practice, internal medicine, anaesthesiology, ophthalmology and psychiatry. Logistic regressions were used to predict career preferences. Besides individual characteristics, work and home domain characteristics were taken into the analysis. Not surprisingly, the preference for career change in respect of working hours is higher among full-time MDs, especially women, than among part-time workers. In contradiction to what was expected, home domain characteristics did not predict a part-time preference for female, but for male MDs. One home domain characteristics, children's age, did predict the male part-time preference. Further gender differences were found in respect of the fit between actual and preferred working hours (A/P-fit). The majority of male MDs with a full-time preference had achieved an A/P-fit, whereas significantly less female MDs achieved their preferences. It was found that hospital-bound specialists are less positive towards part-time careers than other specialists. Furthermore, the change of working hours would imply a reduction in FTE for all specialties, if all preferences were met. Especially in hospital-bound specialisms it was not confirmed that the reduction in FTE would be low; this was found only in respect of interns. It may be concluded that individual preferences in <b>career</b> <b>paths</b> are very diverse. Personnel policy in medical specialties, especially in hospitals, will have to cope with changes in traditional vertical and age-related <b>career</b> <b>paths.</b> Flexible <b>careers</b> <b>related</b> to home domain determinants or other activities will reinforce a life cycle approach, in which the centrality of work is decreasing.
