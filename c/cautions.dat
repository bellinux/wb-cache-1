40|$|In {{this paper}} I examine Crispin Wright's modal anti-realism as {{based on the}} {{availability}} of a certain attitude of <b>Caution</b> towards judgements of necessity. I think that Wright's account should be attractive in several ways for modal theorists with an anti-realist bend. However, the attitude of <b>Caution</b> to which it appeals has attracted some controversy. Wright himself has later come to doubt whether <b>Caution</b> is ultimately coherent. Here I first address Wright's worries concerning the coherence of <b>Caution</b> and show that they are unfounded. But then I argue that although the attitude of <b>Caution</b> is coherent, it cannot provide a suitable basis for a non-eliminativist account of necessity. I offer two different objections against <b>Caution.</b> (1) I argue that Wright's appeal to <b>Caution,</b> if successful, would show not only that modal judgement is non-objective but also that it is dispensable. Thus, I claim that appeal to <b>Caution</b> would seem to serve more as a threat against a non-eliminativist account of necessity, rather than as a potential adequate basis for it. However, (2) I argue that Wright's appeal to <b>Caution</b> is unsuccessful, for there is no genuine Caution: <b>Caution</b> is a mere verbal attitude...|$|R

We found that the frontostriatal network updates the amount of response <b>caution.</b> In particular, when human participants were required to respond quickly, we found a positive correlation between trial-to-trial fluctuations in response <b>caution</b> and the hemodynamic response in the presupplementary motor area and dorsal anterior cingulate. In contrast, on trials that required a change from a speeded response mode to a more accurate response mode or vice versa, we found a positive correlation between response <b>caution</b> and hemodynamic response in the anterior cingulate proper. These results indicate that for each decision, response <b>caution</b> is set through corticobasal ganglia functioning, but that individual choices differ according to the mechanisms that trigger changes in response <b>caution...</b>|$|R
