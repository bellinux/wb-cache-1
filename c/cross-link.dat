Many antibiotics such as penicillin and vancomycin inhibit the enzymes that produce and then <b>cross-link</b> the strands of this polymer together. This causes the cell wall to lose strength and the bacteria to burst.

The Thermo-Plastic Elastomer (TPE) that was used belongs to this group of predominantly <b>cross-linking</b> polymers; however, this agent is added because of faster reaction times and smaller irradiation doses.

25|$|Plasma {{polymers}} can {{be thought}} of as a type of graft polymers since they are grown off of a substrate. These polymers are known to form nearly uniform surface deposition, which is one of their desirable properties. Polymers formed from this process often <b>cross-link</b> and form branches due to the multiple propagating species present in the plasma. This often leads to very insoluble polymers, which gives an advantage to this process, since hyperbranched polymers can be deposited directly without solvent.|$|E

In {{generating}} {{an immune}} {{response to an}} antigen, the B-cells go {{through a process of}} maturation, from surface IgM production, to serum IgM production, to maturation into a plasma cell producing IgG. Graft recipients who generate an immune response have both IgM and IgG. The IgM can be used directly in hemagglutination assays, depicted on the right. IgM has 10 antigen binding regions per molecule, allowing cross-linking of cells. An antiserum specific for HLA-A3 will then agglutinate HLA-A3 bearing red blood cells if the concentration of IgM in the antiserum is sufficiently high. Alternatively, a second antibody to the invariable (Fc) region of the IgG can be used to <b>cross-link</b> antibodies on different cells, causing agglutination.|$|E

25|$|Adding {{water to}} silica drops its melting point by around 800°C {{due to the}} {{breaking}} of the structure by replacing Si–O–Si linkages with terminating Si–OH groups. Increasing water concentration results in the formation of hydrated silica gels and colloidal silica dispersions. Many hydrates and silicic acids exist in the most dilute of aqueous solutions, but these are rather insoluble and quickly precipitate and condense and <b>cross-link</b> to form various polysilicic acids of variable combinations following the formula n, similar to the behaviour of boron, aluminium, and iron, among other elements. Hence, although some simple silicic acids have been identified in dilute solutions, such as orthosilicic acid Si(OH)4 and metasilicic acid SiO(OH)2, none of these are likely to exist in the solid state.|$|E

Each class of glycoprotein is defined by a characteristic, highly repetitive protein sequence. Most are glycosylated, contain hydroxyproline (Hyp) and become cross-linked in the cell wall. These proteins are often concentrated in specialized cells and in cell corners. Cell walls of the epidermis may contain cutin. The Casparian strip in the endodermis roots and cork cells of plant bark contain suberin. Both cutin and suberin are polyesters that function as permeability barriers to the movement of water. The relative composition of carbohydrates, secondary compounds and proteins varies between plants and between the cell type and age.

500|$|For XV, {{the battle}} system was dubbed the Active Cross Battle system.

The team experimented with a multi-character battle system, but eventually decided that it presented too many development difficulties. Noctis' weapons were to be arranged in a deck, and contextually activated in combat. Later, this was changed so that weapon-switching could be done freely during battle, with special attacks using the standard weapons unless others were in place. Instead of a multi-button combo system, combat became focused on single-button combat tied to timed attacks and contextually activated special abilities, in addition to co-op attacks triggered {{with other members of}} the party. One ability that was carried over from Versus XIII to XV was Noctis's Limit Break [...] "Armiger", where he summoned multiple weapons into battle to attack and defend; this was initially seen in the original trailer for XV, and later in both the demo and the final game. Noctis was to have been the only character in the world of XV to wield magic, but as this would not have worked from a gameplay perspective, the team created a story-related pretext that allowed other characters to wield magic.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the challenge of}} minimizing toxicity of therapeutic protein-protein <b>cross-linking</b> of the cornea and sclera. Protein-protein <b>cross-links</b> include disulfide bonds, enzymatic <b>cross-links</b> and non-enzymatic <b>cross-links.</b> Disulfide bonds and enzymatic <b>cross-links</b> are closely regulated in the body. Non-enzymatic <b>cross-links</b> accumulate in an uncontrolled manner, often leading to deleterious effects. Clinically, non-enzymatic <b>cross-links</b> can be inserted in a controlled manner, both temporally and spatially, using photo-activation to achieve effects ranging from killing tumors to stabilizing ocular shape. The shape of the eye is maintained by the ocular coat—the cornea and sclera. Diseases that result in progressive shape changes can lead to blindness (degenerative myopia) or necessitate a corneal transplant (keratoconus and post-LASIK ectasia). Photodynamic corneal <b>cross-linking,</b> pioneered by Wollensak et al. using riboflavin activated by near-ultraviolet light (riboflavin/UVA), halts the progression of keratoconus; if applied to the sclera, it might halt the progression of degenerative myopia, as well. However, this treatment suffers from severe cytotoxicity. The literature to date implicitly assumes that photodynamic <b>cross-linking</b> is inherently toxic. The present research demonstrates that protein-protein <b>cross-linking</b> can be achieved with minimal toxicity using eosin Y activated by visible light (eosin Y/visible). At a molecular level, both eosin Y/visible and riboflavin/UVA are shown to act through a singlet oxygen mechanism; therefore, {{they are expected to}} produce similar covalent modifications of collagenous tissues. Real-time measurements of the increase in elastic modulus during irradiation show that the eosin Y/visible and riboflavin/UVA produce similar rates of <b>cross-linking.</b> The transport coefficients of both eosin Y and riboflavin were measured for both sclera and de-epithelialized cornea. The diffusivity and partition coefficient values, together with the <b>cross-linking</b> kinetics, were used in a predictive model of the <b>cross-linking</b> profile as a function of treatment parameters. The predictive model also serves as an optimization tool for guiding the selection of treatment parameters in pre-clinical studies. In contrast to the dramatic toxicity of the riboflavin/UVA treatment (which kills all of the keratocytes and the endothelium in the rabbit model), the eosin Y/visible treatment achieves comparable <b>cross-linking</b> with negligible phototoxicity. ...|$|R
