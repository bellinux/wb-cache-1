Although antibodies developed against an antigen are highly specific to that antigen, some mAbs can have multi-specificity binding capability for irrelevant antigens (James et al., 2003; Notkins, 2004). To prevent autoimmune diseases, antibodies matured through somatic mutations go through stringent control processes in vivo {{to weed out}} those unfavorable mutants that bind non-specifically to self-antigen or interact broadly with normal tissues. However, antibodies derived from in vitro selection or maturation lack an in vivo-like control system and rely on the <b>counter</b> <b>screen</b> to ensure specificity. This {{can lead to the}} selection of some non-specifically binding variants. For example, the A 4 B 4 variant, (a prototype of Motavizumab, which is an in vitro affinity matured anti-RSV mAb derived from palivizumab), demonstrated broad tissue binding and accelerated clearance in vivo (Wu et al., 2007). Multiple off-target interactions were demonstrated on protein biochips for adalimumab, which was derived in vitro from a cloned human antibody phage library (Feyen et al., 2008).|$|E

However, existing fluorescent labeling techniques have restricted the mechanistic study of functional receptor pairs. We have expanded a hybrid system combining fluorogen-activating protein (FAP) technology and high-throughput flow cytometry to a new type of biosensor that is robust, sensitive, and versatile. This provides the opportunity to study multiple trafficking proteins in the same cell. Human beta 2 adrenergic receptor (β 2 AR) fused with FAP AM 2. 2 and murine C-C chemokines receptor type 5 fused with FAP MG 13 was chosen for our model system. The function of the receptor and the binding between MG 13 and fluorogen MG- 2 p have been characterized by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy assays. The binding of fluorogen and the FAP pair is highly specific, while both FAP-tagged fusion proteins function similarly to their wild-type counterparts.

Direct DNMT inhibitors are needed to refine {{understanding of the role}} of specific DNMT isozymes in cancer etiology and, potentially, to improve cancer prevention and treatment.

In order to improve these treatments and engineer novel therapies, {{it is crucial that}} we increase our understanding of how these antibiotics interact with cellular metabolism. Evidence is increasingly building that the efficacy of antibiotics relies critically on downstream metabolic effects, in addition to inhibition of primary targets. Here we present a novel computational pipeline to expedite investigation of these effects: we combine computational modelling of metabolic networks with data from experimental screens on antibiotic susceptibility to identify metabolic vulnerabilities that can enhance antibiotic efficacy. This approach utilizes genome-scale metabolic models of bacterial metabolism to simulate the reaction-level response of cellular metabolism to a metabolite <b>counter</b> <b>screen.</b> The simulated results are then integrated with experimentally determined antibiotic sensitivity measurements using machine learning. Following integration, a mechanistic understanding of the phenotype-level antibiotic sensitivity results can be extracted. These mechanisms further support the role of metabolism in the mechanism of action of antibiotic lethality. Consistent with current understanding, application of the pipeline to M. tuberculosis identified cysteine metabolism, ATP synthase, and the citric acid cycle as key pathways in determining antibiotic efficacy. Additionally, roles for metabolism of aromatic amino acids and biosynthesis of polyprenoids were identified as pathways meriting further investigation. by Sarah Natalie Wright. Thesis: M.

40|$|Chronic {{activation}} of β-adrenergic (β-AR) pathway causes excessive accumulation of cAMP in cardiomyocytes and participates in pathological cardiac remodeling leading to heart failure (HF). Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) {{are responsible for}} the degradation of cAMP and cGMP in subcellular compartments. Among the different PDE families, PDE 2 is unique in being activated ˜; 5 -fold by cGMP, thus mediating a negative cross talk between cGMP and cAMP signaling. Recently, we found that PDE 2 A activity is increased in human HF and this may represent a protective mechanism limiting â-AR cardiotoxicity in chronic HF. Our therapeutic strategy is to target PDE 2 with specific activators to treat HF at the early stages. A PDE 2 activity assay has been developed, first using a purified PDE 2 from bovine adrenal glands, then using a commercial recombinant protein (full-length human PDE 2 A). We miniaturized a bioluminescent activity assay in 384 well plates, which was validated for High-Throughput Screening (HTS) with an excellent Z-factor (> 0. 7) on the Ciblot HTS platform. Moreover, an in silico screening based on the binding of molecules on the GAF-B domain (regulatory domain) of PDE 2 has been performed on a large library of molecules.

40|$|Cancer {{personalized}} therapy targets molecular pathways {{that drive}} {{the behavior of}} cancer cells. Emerging technologies, in particular the “next generation” sequencing, have rapidly increased the discovery of genomic aberrations including gene mutations, copy number variations and chromosomal rearrangements. Further, there are large numbers of targeted therapies in the clinic representing a toolkit of drugs. Development of approaches to rapidly determine whether new aberrations are drivers or passengers and to identify drugs that will benefit patients with these aberrations becomes a challenge. Success of such development will escalate extensive sequencing of patient tumors {{at the level of}} kinome, exome and whole genome. High throughput technologies will allow functional interrogation of the genomic aberrations to the emerging toolkit of targeted drugs. We report a moderate throughput functional genomic approach that can rapidly and efficiently: 1) determine oncogenic activity of specific genomic aberrations, 2) identify targeted therapies likely to be active against the specific genomic aberration, and 3) distinguish on-target effects from non-specific toxicity of targeted reagents. In our study, we expressed independently a wide series of abnormal genes identified in patient tumors into IL- 3 dependent Ba/F 3 cells using lentiviral vectors. These genes include BCR-ABL, KRAS, HRAS, wild-type PIK 3 CA and its mutants (H 1047 R, E 545 K, R 88 Q), wild-type PIK 3 R 1 and its mutants (K 567 E, N 453 del), wild-type AKT 1, 2, 3 and their mutants E 17 K, GNAQ Q 209 L and LPA 1, 2, 3. Cells were removed from IL 3 to allow manifest of the construct effects. RT-PCR using primers containing the exogenous vector sequence confirmed gene expression. Two different functions were readily assessed. In the first 10 days after transfection, expression of the gene constructs protected cells from death induced by IL 3 deprivation. 4 to 6 weeks after transfection, the ability of the constructs allowed Ba/F 3 cells to proliferate in the absence of IL 3. These two assays provide a rapid assessment of gain of function due to overexpression of wild type or mutant constructs. Stable cell lines were established {{with a wide variety of}} constructs demonstrating the applicability of the approach. In a proof of concept study, the stable cell lines were then assessed for the effect of the constructs on sensitivity to a variety of drugs targeting MEK, PI 3 K, AKT, and LPA receptors in the presence or absence of IL 3. As expected, expression of KRAS or HRAS rendered cells exquisitely sensitive to inhibition of MEK in the absence of IL 3. Exogenous IL 3 protected cells from MEK inhibition-induced cell death, indicating the on-target effect of cellular response, thus providing a ready <b>counter</b> <b>screen</b> for toxicity.

Erastin, a previously reported compound with RAS-selective lethality, showed similar properties. RNA interference experiments targeting voltage-dependent anion channel 3 (VDAC 3), a target of erastin, demonstrated that RSL 5 is a scaffold that acts through VDACs to activate the observed pathway. RSL 3 activated a similar death mechanism but in a VDAC-independent manner.

Reliable assessments of the NHR activities for drug candidates are therefore crucial for drug development. However, the highly permissive structures of NHRs for vastly different ligands make it challenging to predict interactions by examining the chemical structures of the ligands. Here, we report a detailed investigation on the agonistic and antagonistic activities of 615 known drugs or drug candidates against a panel of 6 NHRs: androgen, progesterone, estrogen a/b, and thyroid hormone a/b receptors. Our study revealed that 4. 7 and 12. 4 % compounds have agonistic and antagonistic activities, respectively, against this panel of NHRs. Nonetheless, potent, unintended NHR hits are relatively rare among the known drugs, indicating that such interactions are perhaps not tolerated during drug development. However, we uncovered examples of compounds that unintentionally agonize or antagonize NHRs. In addition, a number of compounds showed multi-NHR activities, suggesting that the cross-talk between multiple NHRs co-operate to elicit in vivo effects. These data highlight the merits of <b>counter</b> <b>screening</b> drug candidate against NHRs during drug discovery/ development.

40|$|Abstract: The Rho {{family of}} Ras {{superfamily}} small GTPases regulates {{a broad range}} of biological processes such as migration, differentiation, cell growth and cell survival. Therefore, the availability of small molecule modulators as tool compounds could greatly enhance research on these proteins and their biological function. To this end, we designed a biochemical, high throughput screening assay with complementary follow-up assays to identify small molecule compounds inhibiting MgcRacGAP, a Rho family GTPase activating protein involved in cytokinesis and transcriptionally upregulated in many cancers. We first performed an in-house screen of 20, 480 compounds, and later we tested the assay against 342, 046 compounds from the NIH Molecular Libraries Small Molecule Repository. Primary screening hit rates were about 1 % with the majority of those affecting the primary readout, an enzyme-coupled GDP detection assay. After orthogonal and <b>counter</b> <b>screens,</b> we identified two hits with high selectivity towards MgcRacGAP, compared with other RhoGAPs, and potencies in the low micromolar range.

Inhibition of alanine–serine–cysteine transporter- 1 (Asc- 1), the primary transporter of d-serine, is attractive because the transporter is localized to neurons in brain regions critical to cognitive function, including the hippocampus and cortical layers III and IV, and is colocalized with d-serine and NMDARs. To identify novel Asc- 1 inhibitors, two different screening approaches were performed with whole-cell amino acid uptake in heterologous cells stably expressing human Asc- 1 : (1) a high-throughput screen (HTS) of 3 M compounds measuring 35 S l-cysteine uptake into cells attached to scintillation proximity assay beads in a 1536 well format and (2) an iterative focused screen (IFS) of a 45   000 compound diversity set using a 3 H d-serine uptake assay with a liquid scintillation plate reader in a 384 well format.

40|$|Abstract Background Fibroblast Growth Factors (FGFs) {{represent}} {{a large family}} of secreted proteins that are required for proper development and physiological processes. Mutations in mouse and zebrafish FGFs result in abnormal embryogenesis and lethality. A key to understanding the precise role for these factors is to determine their spatial and temporal activity during embryogenesis. Results Expression of Dual Specificity Phosphatase 6 (dusp 6, also known as Mkp 3) is controlled by FGF signalling throughout development. The Dusp 6 promoter was isolated from zebrafish and used to drive expression of destabilized green fluorescent protein (d 2 EGFP) in transgenic embryos (Tg(Dusp 6 :d 2 EGFP)). Expression of d 2 EGFP is initiated as early as 4 hours post-fertilization (hpf) within the future dorsal region of the embryo, where fgf 3 and fgf 8 are initially expressed. At later stages, d 2 EGFP is detected within structures that correlate with the expression of Fgf ligands and their receptors. This includes the mid-hindbrain boundary (MHB), pharyngeal endoderm, otic vesicle, hindbrain, and Kupffer's vesicle. The expression of d 2 EGFP is {{under the control of}} FGF signalling as treatment with FGF Receptor (FGFR) inhibitors results in the suppression of d 2 EGFP expression. In a pilot screen of commercially available small molecules we have evaluated the effectiveness of the transgenic lines to identify specific FGF inhibitors within the class of indolinones. These compounds were <b>counter</b> <b>screened</b> with the transgenic line Tg(Fli 1 :EGFP) y 1, that serves as an indirect read-out for Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) signalling {{in order to determine the}} specificity between related receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs).

This has enabled the identification of compounds that can block specifically the VEGFR or the FGFR signalling pathway. Conclusion The generation of transgenic reporter zebrafish lines has allowed direct visualization of FGF signalling within the developing embryo. These FGF reporter transgenic lines provide a tool to screen for specific compounds that can distinguish between two conserved members of the RTK family. </p...|$|R

APE 1, a critical protein in BER that processes potentially cytotoxic abasic sites (AP sites), is a promising new target in cancer. In the current study, my aim was to develop small molecule inhibitors of APE 1 for cancer therapy. An industry-standard high throughput virtual screening strategy was adopted. The SYBYL 8. 0 (Tripos, St Louis, MO, USA) molecular modelling software suite was used to build inhibitor templates. Similarity searching strategies were then applied using ROCS 2. 3 (Open Eye Scientific, Santa Fe, NM, USA) to extract pharmacophorically related subsets of compounds from a chemically diverse database of 2. 6 million compounds. The compounds in these subsets were subjected to docking against the active site of the APE 1 model, using the genetic algorithm-based programme GOLD 2. 7 (CCDC, Cambridge, UK). Predicted ligand poses were ranked on the basis of several scoring functions. The top virtual hits with promising pharmaceutical properties underwent detailed in vitro analyses using fluorescence-based APE 1 AP-site cleavage assays and <b>counter</b> <b>screened</b> using endonuclease IV AP-site cleavage assays, fluorescence quenching assays and Whole cell extract AP-site cleavage assays. Biochemical APE 1 inhibitors were then subjected to detailed cytotoxicity analyses. Several specific APE 1 inhibitors were isolated by this approach. The IC 50 for APE 1 inhibition ranged between 50 nM and 25 µM. I also demonstrated that APE 1 inhibitors lead to accumulation of AP sites in genomic DNA and potentiated the cytotoxicity of alkylating agents in melanoma, glioma and pancreatic cancer cell lines. I have also shown that APE 1 inhibitors induce delay in cell cycle progression and caused delay in cancer cell growth. I also demonstrated that APE 1 knockdown by shRNA results in decrease cancer cell growth and enhanced cell killing by alkylating agent in Glioma cell line.

40|$|The Activator Interaction Domain of Mediator subunit Med 25 is a {{coactivator}} binding {{partner for}} a number of transcriptional activators implicated in diverse cellular processes including the hijacking of transcriptional machinery by viral activators such as VP 16, endoplasmic reticulum oxidative stress response, and most interestingly the progression of malignant cells to a metastatic phenotype. Thus, selective inhibitors against this domain will be useful as mechanistic probes or as potential therapeutics against these processes. Towards the goal of identifying such inhibitors, studies designed to elucidate the underlying molecular features that define activator-AcID interactions were performed and identified the minimal interaction sequences of an activator binding partner and that electrostatic contacts are particularly important in these interactions. These findings, combined with data supporting the hypothesis that the AcID motif is relatively plastic and contains distinct activator binding surfaces that may be in allosteric communication provided several potential mechanisms by which AcID-dependent interactions might be disrupted. A subsequent screening campaign against the VP 16 -AcID interaction identified norstictic acid, which belongs to the depsidone class of natural products, as a potent inhibitor of the domain. Biophysical and biochemical studies suggest that norstictic acid perturbs AcID-dependent interactions by binding covalently to lysine residues within the putative activator binding sites. Additional evidence indicates that the molecule allosterically induces structural shifts within AcID that contribute to the inhibitory activity, suggesting that norstictic acid is a mixed orthosteric/allosteric inhibitor of the AcID motif. Building on these results, the ERM-AcID interaction, which has been linked to metastasis in a number of cancers, was screened against a library of natural product extracts in an effort to identify novel non-covalent inhibitors of the domain. Through a series of <b>counter</b> <b>screens</b> and stringent hit filtering steps, a promising extract with potent activity in vitro against the ERM•AcID interaction has been identified and is currently undergoing deconvolution to identify the structures of the active natural products within the extracts. These natural products will subsequently be used as molecular probes to explore the importance of this interaction in transcriptional programs related to cancer processes such as metastasis and tumorigenesis...|$|R

30|$|We report here an {{evaluation}} of automated liquid handling instrumentation for routine, high-throughput screening of emerging antimicrobial compounds against S. mutans. Automated methods were developed {{for the evaluation of}} bacterial growth under planktonic, biofilm forming, and 24  h biofilm growth conditions. For each, antimicrobial activity was evaluated by measuring the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50), the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC). The results from automated assays of a known antimicrobial compound [cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC)] compared favorably with results from manual assays, though the automated methods were considerably faster. Using the faster automated methods, three cetylpyridinium salts with different halide <b>counter</b> ions were <b>screened</b> for antimicrobial activity.|$|R
5|$|When {{someone is}} {{within range of}} a trap, a sensor bar will move into a red zone. Activating the trap at this moment will capture them. If the trap is {{activated}} when the bar {{is not in the}} red zone, the trap will not work and will become disabled {{for a short period of}} time. The traps will also only work if the access code is correct. There are six possible access codes, and the player must eavesdrop into the conversations to find out when the Martins change the code. When a new code is learned, the player must wait until the speaker leaves the room before changing the access code to the correct color to maintain control of the traps. <b>Counters</b> on the <b>screen</b> indicate how many perpetrators have entered the house and how many have been captured.|$|R
40|$|Laminin {{receptor}} (67 LR) is a 67 kDa protein {{derived from}} a 37 kDa precursor protein (37 LR) and the derivation process most likely involves post-translational modification of 37 LR, thus laminin receptor {{is referred to as}} 37 / 67 LR. Found in both the membrane and cytosolic compartments, 37 / 67 LR normally binds laminin and pathologically is associated with cancer progression, metastasis, and invasion. ^ We used an in silico drug discovery approach to target the interaction interface between the potent anti-angiogenic protein pigment epithelium derived factor (PEDF) and 37 LR using a Maybridge HitFinder library. Following cell based <b>counter</b> <b>screening</b> and binding validation, we characterized a hit compound’s anti-viability, activation of PEDF signaling-related genes, anti-wound healing, and anti-cancer signaling properties in a PC- 3 prostate cancer cell model. Our hit compound, HTS 07944, which we nicknamed C 3, was able to bind the laminin interacting domain of 37 LR (Peptide G), inhibited PC- 3 cell viability at low micromolar concentrations, elicited PEDF-like gene expression and inhibited angiogenic tube formation and wound healing in a scratch assay. Proteomic analysis revealed that C 3 ’s mechanism of action may be through inhibition of chromosomal maintenance proteins (MCM family and ubiquitin E 2 ligases) and pathway analysis suggested that C 3 would inactive the oncogene MYC. C 3 inhibited MYC binding in a luciferase promoter assay. This hit compound has potential for future development as a lead compound for treating tumor growth and inhibiting angiogenesis. ^ To better understand function of 37 LR, we designed a series of constructs lacking critical lysines in putative small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) motifs of 37 LR (K 11, K 42, K 212) and tested the hypothesis that SUMOylation generated the 67 LR species. SUMOylation is a ligase driven, lysine directed conjugation of approximately 12 kDa proteins to client proteins that alters protein-protein interactions, cellular location/trafficking, and general function. After failure to detect 67 LR, we examined the role putative SUMO motifs played in the general fate and function of 37 LR. Using phylogenetic analysis, we showed that a common consensus SUMO motif arose in mammals and via SUMO- 1 pulldown and confocal analysis using anti-SUMO- 2 / 3 antibody, we demonstrated that 37 LR associates with SUMO. Mutations to putative SUMO motifs altered half-life of 37 LR, with a marked enhancement to stability in the case of K 42 R mutation as shown via cyclohexamide chase assay. K 42 R also failed to accumulate after MG- 132 treatment, suggesting that 37 LR may possess either a direct ubiquitin (Ub) site or a mixed SUMO/Ub site that regulates proteasomal degradation. Functionally, mutations to putative SUMO motifs in 37 LR significantly altered steady state levels of early pre-rRNA including 47 S and 45 S. Taken together, we have highlighted a role for SUMO in the function of 37 LR. ...|$|R
40|$|Adenylyl cyclase isoforms are {{distinctly}} modulated by G protein subunits and {{are therefore}} hypothesized to be uniquely regulated by proteins that influence G protein signaling. Activator of G protein signaling 3 (AGS 3) is a G protein modulator that binds Gαi subunits in the GDP-bound state, implicating AGS 3 as an important regulator of Gi-coupled receptor signaling. We studied the ability of AGS 3 to modulate recombinant adenylyl cyclase (AC) type 1 and 2 signaling in HEK 293 cells following both acute and persistent activation of the D 2 L dopamine receptor (D 2 LDR). AGS 3 expression modestly enhanced the potency of acute quinpirole-induced D 2 LDR modulation of AC 1 or AC 2 activity. AGS 3 also promoted desensitization of D 2 LDR-mediated inhibition of AC 1, whereas desensitization of D 2 LDR-mediated AC 2 activation was significantly attenuated. Additionally, AGS 3 reduced D 2 LDR-mediated heterologous sensitization of AC 1 and AC 2. Our results suggest that AGS 3 alters G protein signaling in a complex fashion that is effector-specific and dependent on the duration of receptor activation. The present work also addressed the role of Gβγ subunits {{in the development of}} D 2 LDR-mediated sensitization of AC 2. The molecular signaling components that {{contribute to the development of}} heterologous sensitization are largely unknown, but G protein subunits are strongly implicated in this adaptive process. We utilized Gβγ subunit sequestering proteins, small molecule and peptide Gβγ signaling inhibitors, and pharmacological Gβγ effector and kinase inhibitors to study the role of Gβγ subunit signaling pathways in the development of AC 2 sensitization in HEK 293 cells. Our results suggest that Gβγ subunit signaling is necessary for D 2 LDR-mediated sensitization of AC 2. The multitude and diversity of Gβγ; signaling pathways that may underlie AC sensitization prompted us to develop a high-throughput cAMP assay platform to facilitate future unbiased approaches for the study of AC sensitization, such as siRNA library screening. As an intermediate step to the development of such assays, we addressed the lack of potent and selective small molecule modulators of AC. Identification of chemical probes for AC 2 is particularly important because there are no published genetic deletion studies and few small molecule modulators. Therefore, we developed and executed an intact-cell small molecule screening approach and subsequent validation paradigm for the discovery of AC 2 inhibitors. The NIH clinical collections I and II were screened for inhibitors of AC 2 activity, using PMA-stimulated cAMP accumulation as a functional readout. Active compounds were subsequently confirmed and validated as direct AC 2 inhibitors using orthogonal and <b>counter</b> <b>screening</b> assays. The screening effort identified SKF- 83566 as a selective AC 2 inhibitor with superior pharmacological properties for selective modulation of AC 2 when compared to currently available AC inhibitors. The utility of SKF- 83566 as a small molecule probe to study the function of endogenous ACs was demonstrated in C 2 C 12 mouse skeletal muscle cells. ...|$|R
