40|$|VAR {{studies of}} the e#ects of {{monetary}} policy on output suggest that a <b>contractionary</b> <b>impulse</b> results in a drawn-out, hump-shaped response of output. Standard structural economic models are generally not able to reproduce such a response. In this paper I look at nonfundamental representations that are observationally equivalent to a VAR. I find that the quantitative e#ect of a monetary policy shock on output might be much smaller and much more shortlived than the VAR studies suggest. I conclude that the apparent discrepancy between the VAR findings and standard structural models may be spurious and that the general tendency to append non-structural, ad hoc features to structural models should be questioned...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the consequences}} of asymmetric information in credit markets. Its particular focus lies on monetary transmission mechanisms {{and the impact of}} a monetary impulse on inefficiencies in form of under- and overinvestment caused by the asymmetric information. The main results are: Asymmetric information can amplify, modify or â€“ under extreme circumstances- overcompensate the conventional interest rate channel, in other words there is a credit channel of monetary policy due to asymmetric information in credit markets, but its direction of influence is ambiguous. Furthermore a <b>contractionary</b> monetary <b>impulse</b> aggravates underinvestment whereas the impact on overinvestment is ambiguous...|$|R
40|$|Evidence from newly {{constructed}} monthly {{indices of}} manufacturing production shows that {{differences between the}} Scandinavian countries regarding business cycles in the interwar years were closely related to monetary policy decisions. In the 1920 s Sweden made an early return to gold, while Denmark and Norway experienced large fluctuations in nominal and real exchange rates before restoring the gold standard at the prewar parity in 1927 28. The differences in monetary policy were mirrored in the business cycle history; Denmark and Norway being alone in having a particularly severe contraction period in the years 1925 27, {{referred to as the}} gold-parity depression. The nominal depreciation of the effective exchange rates following the abandonment of the gold standard in September 1931 led to a significant real depreciation in all three countries. Econometric evidence confirms the view that the decision to leave gold was instrumental in dampening the <b>contractionary</b> business cycle <b>impulses</b> from abroad during the years of the Great Depression. ...|$|R
