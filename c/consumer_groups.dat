5|$|Since the 1980s, several parties, {{including}} the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI), the British Heart Foundation, the City of New York, and the Spanish government, {{have argued that}} Burger King has contributed to obesity and unhealthy eating behaviors in Western nations by producing products that contain large amounts of salt, fat, trans-fat and calories. After its purchase by TPG Capital from former parent company Diageo in 2002, the company introduced several large, over-sized products including its European BK XXL line, the British Angus burger six-pack, the Enormous Omelet Sandwich line and the BK Stacker line. These new offerings, and others like them, have resulted in further international scorn and negative attention due the large portion size and increased amounts of unhealthy fats and trans-fats in these items. Many <b>consumer</b> <b>groups</b> have accused Burger King and other fast food restaurant chains of failing to provide healthier alternatives.|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{discusses}} {{three main}} objectives: (1) the {{contribution to the}} body of literature of consumer behaviour demonstrating that consumer groups’ knowledge (i. e., two-person dyads, families, peer or friendship groups, teams, and other social units) is relevant for study by consumer researchers; (2) the development of an integrated conceptual representation of <b>consumer’s</b> <b>group</b> knowledge including the influence of collective variables on decision making process; (3) the investigation of scientific inquiries regarding the role of advanced technologies in relation to conceptual representation. The approach introduces a new framework applicable both as a tool for enhancing the understanding of <b>consumer’s</b> <b>group</b> knowledge, and as a useful guide to future research on consumer knowledge as a whole. The content discussed herein attempts to establish the building block toward the development of a theory of <b>consumer’s</b> <b>group</b> knowledge. The study offers direction toward a potential path that could evolve into an established theory regarding <b>consumer’s</b> <b>group</b> knowledge in the marketplace.

25|$|The dolphin-safe {{movement}} in the U.S. was led by environmental and <b>consumer</b> <b>groups</b> {{in response to the}} use of total encirclement netting.

This resulted in large numbers of dolphins being killed, imperiling the survival of entire species of dolphin, specifically in the Eastern Tropical Pacific.|$|E

Around the world there were other Virgin branded digital music retail websites, such as VirginMega.fr, France's number 2 music download website.|$|E

To avoid the possibility of BPA leaching into food or drink, the National Toxicology Panel recommends avoiding microwaving food in plastic containers, putting plastics in the dishwasher, or using harsh detergents.|$|E

In March 2012, the European Union opened an investigation into the acquisition The EU asked rivals and <b>consumer</b> <b>groups</b> whether the deal would result in higher prices and shut out competitors.

25|$|Darvon, a {{dextropropoxyphene}} formulation made by Eli Lilly, {{which had}} been on the market for 25 years, came under heavy fire in 1978 by <b>consumer</b> <b>groups</b> that said it was associated with suicide. Darvon was never withdrawn from the market, until recently. But Lilly has waged a sweeping, and largely successful, campaign among doctors, pharmacists and Darvon users to defend the drug as safe when it is used in proper doses and not mixed with alcohol. After determining the risks outweigh the benefits, the USFDA requested physicians stop prescribing the drug. On November 19, 2010 the FDA announced that Xanodyne Pharmaceuticals agreed to withdraw Darvon and Darvocet in the United States, followed by manufacturers of dextropropoxyphene.|$|E
25|$|Although 23 states {{established}} {{mandatory reporting}} systems for serious patient injuries or death by 2005, the national database envisioned in the IOM report was delayed by {{the controversy over}} mandatory versus voluntary reporting. Finally in 2005, the US Congress passed the long-debated Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act, establishing a federal reporting database. Hospitals reports of serious patient harm are voluntary, collected by patient safety organizations under contract to analyze errors and recommend improvements. The federal government serves to coordinate data collection and maintain the national database. Reports remain confidential, and cannot be used in liability cases. <b>Consumer</b> <b>groups</b> have objected {{to the lack of}} transparency, claiming it denies the public information on the safety of specific hospitals.|$|E

30|$|A major {{question}} that might arise is, “Do all consumers care about added SO 2 or even notice if SO 2 is added or not?” Most likely {{the answer to}} this question is no, but restrictions on SO 2 will affect winemakers even if only a portion of consumers care about added SO 2. Total market demand is the summation of the individual consumers’ willingness to pay, and total market demand determines market price. Consider wine 1 that contains SO 2 versus wine 2 that does not; the two wines are otherwise identical. <b>Consumer</b> <b>group</b> A believes that SO 2 in wine gives them headaches while <b>consumer</b> <b>group</b> B completely disregards SO 2 when purchasing a wine. <b>Consumer</b> <b>group</b> A’s willingness to pay for wine 1 is less than its willingness to pay for wine 2, while group B has equal willingness to pay across the two wines. When the individual demands are summed, the market demand and price for wine 1 will be less than that for wine 2 due to <b>consumer</b> <b>group</b> A’s preferences.|$|R

25|$|Opposition to {{fluoridation}} {{has existed}} since its initiation in the 1940s. During the 1950s and 1960s, conspiracy theorists claimed that fluoridation was a communist plot to undermine American public health. In recent years water fluoridation {{has become a}} prevalent health and political issue in many countries, resulting in some countries and communities discontinuing its use while others have expanded it. The controversy is propelled by a significant public opposition supported by a minority of professionals, which include researchers, dental and medical professionals, alternative medical practitioners, health food enthusiasts, a few religious groups (mostly Christian Scientists in the U.S.), and occasionally <b>consumer</b> <b>groups</b> and environmentalists. Organized political opposition has come from libertarians, the John Birch Society, and from groups like the Green parties in the UK and New Zealand.|$|E
25|$|In 2006 the Environment Agency {{announced}} it favours compulsory metering in water-scarce southern England. The measure is controversial. <b>Consumer</b> <b>groups</b> fear it will penalise poorer families {{with lots of}} children, and the disabled, who use more water. The announcement also represents a U-turn for Labour, which fiercely opposed compulsory water meters when in opposition, describing them as a 'tax on family life'. In March 2006 the company Folkestone & Dover Water Services was granted the power to install compulsory water meters in a landmark ministerial ruling under which it was given 'water scarcity status' by Environment Minister Elliot Morley. In a written ministerial statement, Mr Morley said: 'In {{many parts of the}} country, water is a precious resource which we can no longer simply take for granted.' The company says that Folkestone and Dover are in one of the driest areas in the UK. Many parts of the Middle East had more rain than this area, and it is getting even drier and warmer due to climate change.|$|E
500|$|The 767s were {{launched}} as [...] "First Business Class" [...] to charter travelers, but the business model was not successful. The new <b>consumer</b> <b>groups</b> entering the market had low willingness to pay, {{and the demand}} for premium charter services was low. The company was faced with not being able to charter out the plane because of the low seat numbers, but could not put in the extra seats because of the aircraft also being used on the scheduled market. Using so large aircraft on the short-haul flights in Southern Norway gave little economy-of-scale, and the airline seldom needed the increased capacity. Braathens SAFE also had problems, because from order to delivery, the exchange rates had increased from 5 to 9 NOK per USD, almost doubling the price in NOK. In 1986, the two 767s where sold. Two years later, Altas Resor was sold, and the following year Saga. Braathens SAFE closed its bases in Gothenburg and Stockholm, but remained a charter operator with 737s from Norway.|$|E

500|$|In June 2006, the Consumer Ombudsmen in Norway, Sweden and Denmark {{challenged}} Apple's iTunes {{end user}} license agreement (EULA) through the Norwegian Consumer Ombudsman Bjørn Erik Thon, {{who claimed that}} Apple was violating contract and copyright laws in their countries. Thon stated that Apple's [...] "being an international company does not entitle [...] to disregard the laws of the countries in which it operates. The company's standard customer contract violates Norwegian law". An official complaint was filed by the Norwegian Consumer Council in January 2006, after which German and French <b>consumer</b> <b>groups</b> joined the Nordic-led drive to force Apple to make its iTunes online store compatible with digital music players made by rival companies. A French law allows regulators to force Apple to make its player and store compatible with rival offerings. The consumer protection regulators of Norway, Sweden, and Finland met with Apple in September 2006 in hopes of resolving the issues without litigation, but the matter was only resolved after Apple discontinued its FairPlay digital rights management (DRM) scheme.|$|E
