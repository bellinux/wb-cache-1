40|$|Acoustic {{estimates}} of herring and blue whiting abundance were obtained during the surveys using the Simrad ER 60 scientific echosounder. The allocation of NASC-values to herring, blue whiting and other acoustic targets {{were based on}} the composition of the trawl catches and the appearance of echo recordings. To estimate the abundance, the allocated NASC -values were averaged for ICES-squares (0. 5 ° latitude by 1 ° longitude). For each <b>statistical</b> <b>square,</b> the unit area density of fish (rA) in number per square nautical mile (N*nm- 2) was calculated using standard equations (Foote et al., 1987; Toresen et al., 1998). To estimate the total abundance of fish, the unit area abundance for each <b>statistical</b> <b>square</b> was multiplied by the number of square nautical miles in each <b>statistical</b> <b>square</b> and then summed for all the <b>statistical</b> <b>squares</b> within defined subareas and over the total area.

40|$|The {{history of}} capelin {{assessment}} in the Barents Sea {{has shown that}} the growth of individual capelin has varied between years and different parts of the capelin distribution area. As the number of individuals in this stock is very high, even small changes in individual growth will affect the surplus production and the catches which may be taken from it. If this growth could be estimated in advance, the assessment could be made more precise. Temperature variation has been suggested as a factor which could be partly responsible for the variation in growth. To study this possibility, we compared corresponding values of temperature and length increment of the capelin {{in different parts of the}} Barents Sea from 1976 to 1985. The mean temperature in subareas was calculated by averaging the temperatures for the depth interval 10 - 200 m at all of the hydrographical stations taken each September in each <b>statistical</b> <b>square</b> which the sea is devided, and then combining the squares to form subareas. The estimates of growth were calculated by substracting the backcalculated length corresponding to the outermost winter ring in the otolith from the length at sampling.

40|$|To solve {{discrete}} Markov decision {{models with}} a large number of dimensions is always difficult (and at times, impossible), because size of state space and computation cost increases exponentially with the number of dimensions. This phenomenon is called "The Curse of Dimensionality," and it prevents us from using models with many state variables. To overcome this problem, we propose a new approximation method, named <b>statistical</b> least <b>square</b> temporal difference (SLSTD) method, that can solve discrete Markov decision models with large state space. SLSTD method approximate the value function on the whole state space at once, and obtain optimal approximation weight by minimizing temporal residuals of the Bellman equation. Furthermore, a stochastic approximation method enables us to optimize the problem with low computational cost. SLSTD method can solve DMD models with large state space more easily than other existing methods, and in some cases, reduces the computation time by over 99 percent. We also show the parameter estimated by SLSTD is consistent and asymptotically normally distributed. Comment: 21 page...|$|R
