40|$|Development of an {{electrochemical}} method for separating the contributions made by faradaic and non-faradaic processes {{to the total}} specific capacitance of an electrochemical capacitor electrode is reported. The method is based on step potential electrochemical spectroscopy (SPECS), and its application is demonstrated on activated carbon electrodes in aqueous media. The method involves applying a sequence of small potential steps (± 25 mV) across the electrochemical window of the electrode material, with sufficient rest time between steps to allow for current equilibration. Modelling of the resultant i-t data using combined resistive, <b>capacitive,</b> diffusional and <b>residual</b> <b>current</b> terms allows for separation of the faradaic and non-faradaic terms. The behavior of these contributions across the electrode potential window is reported and discussed in comparison with conventional methods of electrochemical analysis, such as cyclic voltammetry...|$|R

At most stations, the computed harmonic constants agree well with the observed ones. The circulations of the South China Sea in summer (August) and winter (December) are mainly discussed. It is shown that the barotropic tidal <b>residual</b> <b>current</b> is too weak to affect the South China Sea circulation, whilst the contribution of the baroclinic tidal <b>residual</b> <b>current</b> to the South China Sea circulation would be important in the continental shelf sea areas, especially in the Gulf of Thailand and Gulf of Tonkin.

The capacitor plugged in the regular mode represents a MIS structure of reverse direction.

An apparatus was constructed by the author of the thesis to measure the temporary connection between <b>residual</b> <b>current</b> and rise of temperature of the tantalum capacitors. Annealing of three different sets of tantalum capacitors made by different producers was performed at the temperature of 400 K and nominal voltage of 35 V during the period of 20 days.

The M 2 and K 1 amplitudes were 10 times lower inside than outside the Bay with the phase lags of about 180 °(M 2) and 160 °(K 1).
