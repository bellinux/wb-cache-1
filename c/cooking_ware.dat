Autoptical analysis identified nine ceramic sample-groups, corresponding to Greek productions (mainly Corinthian, but also Chios, North-Aegean and Attic types: in particular Attic à la brosse amphora represents so far an unicum in Spina’s finds), Graeco-Italic and local productions too.

The morphological analysis of the different groups has put in evidence a low variation of the types except for their size. The archaeometrical data show {{that most of the}} analysed materials may correspond to a local or regional production (with certain degree of variation) of cooking wares widely used in Nora in the Late Roman Period. It is important to stress that petrographic analysis shows that the compositional characteristics of the non-plastics inclusions are compatible with the surrounding geology of Nora.

This motivated a specific project to explore the nature of cooking pottery on the island and the raw clays as well as the production technologies that have been used traditionally for their manufacture. In this paper, the traditional cooking pottery making in Pabillonis (Oristano province) was studied. First, a field survey in the area of Pabillonis was undertaken in order to locate the raw materials used. Moreover, representative samples from final products were also collected in a traditional workshop. All the materials (clays and pots) were analysed in order to determine their chemical, petrographical and technological characteristics. The final aim was to reconstruct the paste recipe used by the local potters for cooking vessels.

There are {{three types of}} Deritend ware; a fine to moderately sandy, micaceous orange to red ware (Glazed Deritend ware), used mainly for jugs, with some examples of bowls, dripping trays and aquamaniles, dating to the 13th to early 14th centuries; a black or, less frequently, grey ware with a brown core, also micaceous, (Reduced Deritend ware) used mainly for cooking pots/jars and less commonly large unglazed jugs and skillets/pipkins, dating from possibly the late 12th century to the early 14th century.; a sandy brown ware with grey core (Deritend <b>cooking</b> pot <b>ware)</b> used for <b>cooking</b> pots, dating from possibly the late 12th century to 13th century. Wasters i.e. pottery misfires have been found for all three wares in Birmingham. [...] Glazed Deritend ware jugs were decorated with white slip (liquid clay)lines and applied white clay strips, often roller stamped, and white clay pads, The more complex (and later) decorative schemes are in the North French style (c.

50|$|At the {{beginning}} of glass research it was most important to know {{the relation between the}} glass composition and its properties. For this purpose Otto Schott introduced the additivity principle in several publications for calculation of glass properties. This principle implies that the relation between the glass composition and a specific property is linear to all glass component concentrations, assuming an ideal mixture, with Ci and bi representing specific glass component concentrations and related coefficients respectively in the equation below. The additivity principle is a simplification and only valid within narrow composition ranges as seen in the displayed diagrams for the refractive index and the viscosity.
