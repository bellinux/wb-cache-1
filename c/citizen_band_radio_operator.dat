5000|$|Over the air {{broadcasting}} {{is usually}} associated with radio and television, though in recent years both radio and television transmissions have begun to be distributed by cable (cable television). The receiving parties may include the general public or a relatively small subset; {{the point is that}} anyone with the appropriate receiving technology and equipment (e.g., a radio or television set) can receive the signal. The field of broadcasting includes both government-managed services such as public radio, community radio and public television, and private commercial radio and commercial television. The U.S. Code of Federal Regulations, title 47, part 97 defines [...] "broadcasting" [...] as [...] "transmissions intended for reception by the general public, either direct or relayed". [...] Private or two-way telecommunications transmissions do not qualify under this definition.

5000|$|The <b>citizens</b> <b>band</b> <b>radio</b> service {{originated}} in the United States as one of several personal radio services regulated by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). These services began in 1945 to permit <b>citizens</b> a <b>radio</b> <b>band</b> for personal communication (e.g., radio-controlled model airplanes and family and business communications). In 1948, the original CB radios were designed for operation on the 460-470 MHz UHF band. There were two classes of CB radio: [...] "A" [...] and [...] "B". Class B radios had simpler technical requirements, and were limited to a smaller frequency range.
