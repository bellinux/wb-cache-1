President Calles, the President of Mexico, {{declined}} the offer and the body was returned to Mexico via train transport amid full military honors. The military guard were dispatched from Governors Island. When transferred to the train at Penn Station, the coffin was led by six black horses in a caisson with 10,000 troops marching to a muffled drum beat down Broadway. It was estimated that 200,000 people lined the route to see the coffin draped procession. Every Mexican military offices was ordered to wear <b>crape</b> upon his sword hilt and a black brassard on his arm in honor of Carranza. National flags were flown at half-mast for one week.|$|E
25|$|Many foreign {{species are}} {{cultivated}} in the state, some as ornamentals, others as novelty species. Included {{among these are}} the <b>crape</b> myrtle, Italian cypress, southern magnolia, live oak in the warmer parts of the state, and even hardy palm trees in the warmer central and eastern parts of the state. USDA plant hardiness zones in the state range from Zones 5 and 6 in the extreme {{western part of the}} state to Zone 7 in the central part, and Zone 8 around {{the southern part of the}} coast, the bay area, and parts of metropolitan Baltimore. Invasive plant species, such as kudzu, tree of heaven, multiflora rose, and Japanese stiltgrass, stifle growth of endemic plant life. Maryland's state flower, the black-eyed susan, grows in abundance in wild flower groups throughout the state. The state insect, the Baltimore checkerspot butterfly, is not common as it is near the southern edge of its range. 435 species of birds have been reported from Maryland.|$|E

25|$|Forests {{consist of}} a mix of Northeastern coastal forests of Oak in {{southern}} areas of the state, to the upland New England-Acadian forests in the northwestern parts of the state. Mountain Laurel (Kalmia latifolia) is the state flower, and is native to low ridges in several parts of Connecticut. Rosebay Rhododendron (Rhododendron maximum) is also native to eastern uplands of Connecticut and Pachaug State Forest {{is home to the}} Rhododendron Sanctuary Trail. Atlantic white cedar (Chamaecyparis thyoides), is found in wetlands in the southern parts of the state. Connecticut has one native cactus (Opuntia humifusa), found in sandy coastal areas and low hillsides. Several types of beach grasses and wildflowers are also native to Connecticut.. Connecticut spans USDA Plant Hardiness Zones 5b to 7a. Coastal Connecticut is the broad transition zone where more southern and subtropical plants are cultivated. In some coastal communities, Magnolia grandiflora (southern magnolia), <b>Crape</b> Myrtles, scrub palms (Sabal minor), and other broadleaved evergreens are cultivated in small numbers.|$|E
500|$|Before the [...] season, the Worcester team {{experienced}} several setbacks. Bancroft departed {{as their}} manager, {{and many of}} the players also left the team. Mike Dorgan replaced Bancroft and served as player-manager, while Hick Carpenter and Pete Hotaling were brought in as player replacements. Further complications arose during the season: the popular Sullivan was sick with tuberculosis, and on August 19, shortstop Irwin broke his leg. This presented a problem for that day's game, because his backup, Buttercup Dickerson, was also injured at the time. As a solution, local sports equipment dealer Martin [...] "Flip" [...] Flaherty was used to help field a full team. Matters did not improve the following month: Lip Pike was accused of conspiring to throw baseball games, and was later expelled by the NL, and Sullivan succumbed to tuberculosis. To commemorate their teammate, the team wore a black <b>crape</b> on their sleeve, which began baseball's tradition of honoring the recently deceased in this manner. [...] Dorgan departed the team before the season ended, and Stovey took over the on-field managerial duties, while also continuing his playing role. The team finished with a record of 32wins, 50losses, with 1tie, finishing last among the eight teams in the league.|$|E

In late March1931 the Annis-Krapes Corporation placed a classified ad requesting large quantities of silks, specifically flowered and printed <b>crapes</b> of the georgette (fabric) genre. The business had changed its address to 520 8th Avenue (Manhattan).|$|R
2500|$|Fine muslins and jewels, {{especially}} beryls (vaiduriyam) and pearls were exported from Tamilakam {{for personal}} adornment. Drugs, spices and condiments {{as well as}} <b>crape</b> ginger and other cosmetics fetched high prices. Even greater was the [...] demand for pepper which, according to Pliny, sold {{at the price of}} 15 denarii (silver pieces) a pound. Sapphire, called kurundham in Tamil, and a variety of ruby were also exported. The other articles exported from Tamilakam were ivory, spikenard, betel, diamonds, amethysts and tortoiseshell. The Greek and Arabic names for rice (Oryza and urz), ginger(Gingibar and zanjabil) and cinnamon (Karpion and quarfa) are almost identical with their Tamil names, arisi, inchiver and karuva. The imports were mostly luxury items such as glass, gold and wine. Horses were imported from Arabia.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{predominantly}} {{not in a}} subtropical climate, some warmer-climate {{flora and}} fauna does reach well into Ohio. For instance, a number of trees with more southern ranges, such as the blackjack oak, Quercus marilandica, are found at their northernmost in Ohio {{just north of the}} Ohio River. Also evidencing this climatic transition from a subtropical to continental climate, several plants such as the Southern magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora), Albizia julibrissin (mimosa), <b>Crape</b> Myrtle, and even the occasional Needle Palm are hardy landscape materials regularly used as street, yard, and garden plantings in the Bluegrass region of Ohio; but these same plants will simply not thrive in {{much of the rest of}} the State. This interesting change may be observed while traveling through Ohio on Interstate 75 from Cincinnati to Toledo; the observant traveler of this diverse state may even catch a glimpse of Cincinnati's common wall lizard, one of the few examples of permanent [...] "subtropical" [...] fauna in Ohio.|$|E

2500|$|Newly {{discovered}} {{records show}} that Middleton Place imported water buffalo from Constantinople in the late 18th century, {{the first in the}} United States. They were [...] experimental draft animals, suited to the deep muck in which rice was grown. In the gardens, Arthur's son Henry Middleton's friendship with French botanist André Michaux resulted in the first camellias grown in an American garden, a house gift during Michaux's visit in 1786. Three of the four planted at the corners of the main parterre survive, grown to fifteen feet: One is Camellia japonica [...] "reine des fleurs"; the other is an ancestor of the modern cultivar Charles Sprague Sargent. The second Henry Middleton expanded and enriched the gardens, introducing the garden's first Asiatic azalea (Rhododendron indica), and the <b>crape</b> myrtle ( [...] Lagerstroemia indica), one of the oldest in America. He also filled greenhouses with exotics and imported plants and seeds to give antebellum Middleton Place something of the air of a botanical garden.|$|E
2500|$|In Memphis, the City Beautiful Commission {{was officially}} {{established}} by a city ordinance on July 1, 1930, {{making it the}} first and oldest beautification commission in the nation. It {{was the brainchild of}} the mayor, Mr. E. H. Crump. The first Commission was appointed and had operating expenses of $1,500. A small office was set up in The Nineteenth Century Club. Mrs. E. G. Willingham was chosen as chairman and Mrs. William B. Fowler served as vice chairman. In 1935, the Riverside Drive project was dedicated. Costing nearly $1,000,000 (largely WPA funds) the City Beautiful Commission landscaped the bluffs with <b>crape</b> myrtle, redbuds, magnolias, dogwoods and Paul Scarlet roses. White roses were planted at each guardrail post. In 1936, Mrs. William B. Fowler became chairman of the City Beautiful Commission and served for many years. City Beautiful grew under her leadership and soon had to relocate to [...] larger headquarters. Through the efforts of City Beautiful, Memphis gained the title of cleanest city in Tennessee in 1940, 1941, 1942, 1943, 1944, 1945 and 1946. [...] Memphis also received the Ernest T. Trigg “Nation’s Cleanest City” award in 1948, 1949, 1950 and 1951. During this time, volunteers were organized into Wards and Block Clubs with Ward Chairmen and Block Captains. The City Beautiful staff grew to include 30 inspectors by 1954 who worked through these organizations to identify and improve eyesores. Memphis participated with the [...] headquartered in Washington, D.C. [...] In 1978, the Commission was reorganized, eliminating the field inspectors. [...] In February 1989, the Commission moved to its present location at The Massey House in Victorian Village, Memphis.|$|E

60|$|But these experiences, {{both from}} their {{intensity}} and his solitude, were necessarily squalid. Best not enlarge upon them. For just as extreme suffering, without hope, is intolerable to the victim, so, to others, is its depiction without some corresponding delusive mitigation. The gloomiest and truthfulest dramatist seldom chooses for his theme the calamities, however extraordinary, of inferior and private persons; least of all, the pauper's; admonished by the fact, {{that to the}} <b>craped</b> palace of the king lying in state, thousands of starers shall throng; but few feel enticed to the shanty, where, like a pealed knuckle-bone, grins the unupholstered corpse of the beggar.|$|R
