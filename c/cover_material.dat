Currently available and proposed <b>cover</b> <b>materials</b> are described by type. The functional contribution of cover components was considered. Special attention was given to alternative daily <b>cover</b> <b>materials</b> in form of sprayable slurries or emulsions. Using the obtained data, conclusions were drawn concerning the most promising components and compositions of sprayable alternative daily covers. Particularly promising components of sprayable daily covers for the use in local environment (Latvia) are clays, which are found in abundance in local mineral deposits...|$|R

25|$|In some {{circumstances}} and {{for reasons of}} simplicity, it can be sufficient to not use cover materials at all or to use toilet paper itself as <b>cover</b> <b>material.</b> One example is the case where the UDDT has a mechanized ventilation system and a view guard, like the UDDT manufactured by Separett which has a removable bucket, built-in fan and blue plastic view guard which closes when weight {{is removed from the}} toilet seat after use. Also in the case of public toilets, it can be easier to let the caretaker perform the task of adding <b>cover</b> <b>material,</b> rather than the user. An example of this are the public single vault UDDTs operated by the not-for-profit company Sanergy in low-income urban areas in Kenya.|$|E
25|$|Designers {{and users}} of UDDTs {{should strive to}} keep the feces pile as dry as {{possible}} as {{this is the key}} factor in prevention of odor and flies (flies are not attracted to dry feces). During storage, the feces’ natural moisture slowly evaporates and is exhausted through the vault’s ventilation system, or is absorbed by the dry <b>cover</b> <b>material.</b> This process is called drying, dehydration or desiccation.|$|E
500|$|The band {{ultimately}} wrote so many songs {{while in}} the studio that they ditched the idea of including any <b>cover</b> <b>material.</b> All of the songs on All That Is Within Me were written by the band, {{with the exception of}} [...] "You Reign", which they co-wrote with Steven Curtis Chapman. The final song to be recorded for the album, it resulted from Millard had contacting Chapman over the Internet. He sent Millard some few recordings of songs he had failed to complete while working on his own record. Upon getting to what would become [...] "You Reign", Millard was interested by the verse, and paired it with a chorus that he had previously written but could never write a verse for; the chorus Chapman had originally written for the song became its bridge.|$|E

2500|$|For most UDDT types, {{users are}} {{encouraged}} to add a handful or scoopful of dry <b>cover</b> <b>material</b> directly after each defecation event. This <b>cover</b> <b>material</b> is added for the following purposes: to promote dry conditions in the feces vault by absorbing moisture, to control odor, to prevent infestation of flies {{and to create a}} visual barrier for the next user. It is also important to ensure that enough air can flow through the pile of drying feces. For this reason bulky or fibrous material that is dry and that decomposes slowly is recommended.

2500|$|In late 1991, guitarist Mike Turner {{placed an}} ad in Toronto-based Now {{newspaper}} in search of musicians. Michael Maida, a criminology student at the University of Toronto, {{was the first to}} reply. [...] The two formed a band called As If, inviting Jim Newell as drummer and a friend of Turner's, Paul Martin, to play bass. After they played a number of gigs in Oshawa with sets containing a mix of original and <b>cover</b> <b>material,</b> Martin departed soon after, and the band placed an ad for a replacement bassist. Chris Eacrett, a business student at Ryerson University, replied and was accepted after an audition. During that time, Turner and Maida attended a music seminar where they met songwriter and producer Arnold Lanni, the owner of Arnyard Studios. The band, with Lanni, commenced writing new material and recorded some material under the As If name.|$|E
2500|$|Asked in November 2010 {{whether the}} Eagles were {{planning}} {{a follow-up to}} Long Road Out of Eden, Schmit replied, [...] "My first reaction would be: no way. But I said that before the last one, so you never really know. Bands are a fragile entity {{and you never know}} what's going to happen. It {{took a long time to}} do that last album, over a span of years, really, and it took a lot out of us. We took a year off at one point. I'm not sure if we're able to do that again. I wouldn't close the door on it, but I don't know." [...] Walsh said in 2010 that there might be one more album before the band [...] "wraps it up." [...] Frey later stated in a 2012 interview that the band has had discussions about releasing an EP of potentially 4–6 songs that may contain both original and <b>cover</b> <b>material.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Nilsson's next album, Harry (1969), was {{his first}} to hit the charts, and also {{provided}} a Top 40 single with [...] "I Guess the Lord Must Be in New York City" [...] (written as a contender for the theme to Midnight Cowboy), used in the Sophia Loren movie La Mortadella (1971) (US title: Lady Liberty). While the album still presented Nilsson as primarily a songwriter, his astute choice of <b>cover</b> <b>material</b> included, this time, a song by then-little-known composer Randy Newman, [...] "Simon Smith and the Amazing Dancing Bear". Nilsson {{was so impressed with}} Newman's talent that he devoted his entire next album to Newman compositions, with Newman himself playing piano behind Nilsson's multi-tracked vocals. The result, Nilsson Sings Newman (1970), was commercially disappointing but was named Record of the Year by Stereo Review magazine and provided momentum to Newman's career. The self-produced Nilsson Sings Newman also marked the end of his collaboration with RCA staff producer Rick Jarrard, who recounted in the Nilsson documentary that the partnership was terminated by a telegram from Nilsson, who abruptly informed Jarrard that he wanted to work with other producers, and the two never met or spoke again.|$|E
