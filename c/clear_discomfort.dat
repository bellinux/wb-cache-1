After being defeated in straight sets by Pablo Cuevas in the first round, Hamou groped and kissed Eurosport journalist Maly Thomas on live television, despite her <b>clear</b> <b>discomfort.</b> As a result, Hamou was suspended {{for the rest of}} the French Open. Maly Thomas later declared that [...] "if they weren't live she would have given him a right hook". Hamou later apologized for his behaviour via his Instagram account the following day. He was excluded though from the 2017 French Open.|$|E
50|$|Early in {{the second}} half, Motherwell goalkeeper Ally Maxwell was badly injured {{as a result of}} {{challenge}} with United's John Clark. He was able to carry on after receiving treatment, but was in <b>clear</b> <b>discomfort.</b> Dundee United equalised on 55 minutes when Dave Bowman struck a 25-yard shot past the struggling Maxwell. Motherwell retook the lead a mere three minutes later when a Davie Cooper free-kick was flicked on by John Clark and headed past Alan Main by Phil O'Donnell. The Steelmen further extended their lead on 65 minutes when an Ian Angus shot {{from the edge of the}} penalty box flew into the top corner of the goal.|$|E
40|$|The {{vision of}} the {{university}} and the lecturer-student relationship in the perceptions and experiences of those surveyed are heterogeneous, showing in many areas a tendency to this ambivalence, resulting probably from an internal contradiction between the expected (ideal conceptions), the general challenges (labor market requirements, economics), and the actually experienced necessity of finding oneself under the hard conditions which reality (mainly economic) present to the students (as well as lecturers). The students (although declaratively) associate the University with exceptional quality of education, particular relationship with the lecturer, and ethics, and even with transgression (positive perspective, because it is that which initiates development). At the same time, the narrow, pragmatic vision of education preparing one mainly for the requirements of the labor market - practical knowledge (negative perspective, because it is restricts the scope of development) limits this. It is a space where {{there is no room for}} "student life" and "developing of culture", where experienced emotions are clearly ambivalent, dominated by frustration and stress and accompanying fear (deactivating emotions). This makes university space a place for experiencing <b>clear</b> mental <b>discomfort</b> and negative learning experiences often marked by "student-lecturer" relationship of negative traits, limiting, hostile, or indifferent...|$|R
40|$|The {{consecutive}} {{complaints of}} physical and psychological discomfort by {{a significant number of}} users of the new Oporto Faculty of Arts building (FLUP), alerted us to the need of distinguish, from a climatological point of view, between the impacts effectively existent in the bioclimatic comfort of employees, students and lecturers, and the usual reserve in relation to any process of change. During the months of January/February 1996, a questionnaire was sub-mitted to 212 students (5. 4 % of the students population), enrolled in ali the courses lectured at the FLUP This survey revealed a <b>clear</b> climatic <b>discomfort</b> perception, both in classrooms and in areas of recreation and leisure. Approximately 82 % of the students considered the classrooms excessive-ly warm, and 90 % of these students claimed that they experienced physical and/or mental discomfort. Symptoms recurrently referred by the students in question were headaches, somnolence, difficulty in concentration, drops in blood pressure, vision disturbances and physical fatigue. The results obtained during the temperature, relative humidity and luminosity monitoring, were surprising. Not because these values contradict-ed the thermal discomfort sensation expressed by the interviewees, and perceived by us, but because they showed temperature/relative humidity combinations which were considerably higher than the tolerance limits for human beings...|$|R
40|$|People {{live in a}} {{world in}} which they are {{surrounded}} by potential disgust elicitors such as ``used'' chairs, air, silverware, and money as well as excretory activities. People function in this world by ignoring most of these, by active avoidance, reframing, or adaptation. The issue is particularly striking for professions, such as morticians, surgeons, or sanitation workers, in which there is frequent contact with major disgust elicitors. In this study, we study the ``adaptation'' process to dead bodies as disgust elicitors, by measuring specific types of disgust sensitivity in medical students before and after they have spent a few months dissecting a cadaver. Using the Disgust Scale, we find a significant reduction in disgust responses to death and body envelope violation elicitors, but no significant change in any other specific type of disgust. There is a <b>clear</b> reduction in <b>discomfort</b> at touching a cold dead body, but not in touching a human body which is still warm after death. disgust, death, adaptation. ...|$|R
50|$|When {{they were}} children, she'd often {{pretend to be}} Sora, but as they grew up, it became {{apparent}} that their personalities are polar opposites. Unlike the quiet and well-behaved Sora, Nami is blunt and can be incredibly stubborn and harsh, and also quite eerie and threatening towards her brother. For instance, she had a habit of smashing his toys when they were children out of jealousy, and often forces Sora to cosplay for her own amusement. She has a very strong disregard for Sora's feelings, demonstrated by how she deceived him into signing up for the cosplay club for further cross-dressing, despite his <b>clear</b> <b>discomfort,</b> and upon receiving his resignation letter, she immediately tore it up in front of him without consideration.|$|E
5000|$|There is a {{theme of}} fear of {{cultural}} change is a predominant theme throughout the novel. There is <b>clear</b> <b>discomfort</b> throughout the novel about the changing landscape of London and the effect that Imperialism and changing social norms have on society. The way the Goddess changes the perception of London {{in a negative way}} and infiltrates society in a destructive sense reflects this discomfort with changes in life. The Goddess is able to come to London unnoticed and without trouble. Her power over men makes it easy for her to infiltrate London. She represents the threat of India, post British colonization. [...] "Some queer things still take place in India." [...] She is completely foreign in her ways and tactics of influencing men and a threat because of it.|$|E
40|$|The {{design and}} {{selection}} of 3 D modeled hand gestures for human-computer interaction should follow principles of natural language {{combined with the}} need to optimize gesture contrast and recognition. The selection should also consider the discomfort and fatigue associated with distinct hand postures and motions, especially for common commands. Sign language interpreters have extensive and unique experience forming hand gestures and many suffer from hand pain while gesturing. Professional sign language interpreters (N= 24) rated discomfort for hand gestures associated with 47 characters and words and 33 hand postures. <b>Clear</b> associations of <b>discomfort</b> with hand postures were identified. In a nominal logistic regression model, high discomfort was associated with gestures requiring a flexed wrist, discordant adjacent fingers, or extended fingers. These and other findings should be considered in the design of hand gestures to optimize the relationship between human cognitive and physical processes and computer gesture recognition systems for human-computer input.

40|$|Topical {{hemostatic}} {{agents are}} applied locally to areas of injured vascular endothelium to control local bleeding. Ankaferd Blood Stopper (ABS) has gained approval in Turkey and Bosnia-Herzegovina as a topical haemostatic agent for external post-surgical and post-dental surgery bleeding. The safety of topical use of ABS {{has been demonstrated}} in numerous in vitro and in vivo animal models, {{as well as in}} a clinical Phase I trial in humans. ABS, besides its haemostatic activity, also has in vitro anti-infectious and anti-neoplastic effects. To assess potential detrimental effects of intravenous administration of ABS into intact systemic circulation in a rabbit experimental model, one milliliter of ABS was administered intravenously into the systemic circulation of twelve rabbits which were included in the study via the marginal ear vein. Animals were observed for 1 hr before euthanasia was performed by administering 40 mg of intracardiac suxamethonium chloride. In the event of death (cardiopulmonary arrest) {{before the end of the}} planned observation period of 60 minutes, time of death was recorded and histopathological examination of the liver and spleen was commenced. Ten rabbits were alive by the end of the planned observation period, without showing any <b>clear</b> signs of <b>discomfort,</b> whereas two animals died within five minutes after systemic administration of intravenous ABS.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} the anti-inflammatory efficacies of topical drugs, models of contact hypersensitivity (CHS) can be used, but the conventional murine models of CHS need revision in this respect. These models utilize sensitized mice to study suppression of sensitization or elicitation by test compounds. To mimick the events occurring in {{allergic contact dermatitis}} (ACD), a modification of the murine model of CHS is needed {{in a way that}} a chronic postelicitation phase of CHS is maintained for studies of anti-inflammatory effects of topical drugs, typically relevant for ACD therapy, not for ACD prevention. A method for the quantification of the suppression of ACD by a test compound is presented here. Two experimental drugs for topical use, imidazole- 4 -carboxylate and imidazole- 4 -acetate, were tested in parallel with the corticosteroid prednisolone. We found that prednisolone showed strong suppressive effects, while imidazole- 4 -carboxylate and imidazole- 4 -acetate showed mild suppressive effects during persistent ACD simulation. Multiple elicitations on the mouse ears led to scratching and the formation of abrasions and scabbings with, presumably, worsening of <b>discomfort.</b> <b>Clear</b> reduction of these side-phenomena was achieved by tailoring the topical amount of contact sensitizer, while the ability of the ACD model to test anti-inflammatory compounds, was not affected. By focussing on a prolonged postelicitation phase of CHS, a simulation of ACD has been established. We demonstrated that this model may provide an improved predictability for the clinical efficacies of (experimental) mild or strong anti-inflammatory drug...|$|R
