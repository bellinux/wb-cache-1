40|$|Kabatiella caulivora is {{the causal}} agent of <b>clover</b> <b>scorch,</b> a fungal disease of clover (Trifolium) species. Variability {{within and between}} K. caulivora Race 1 and Race 2 was {{determined}} by cultural characteristics, isozymes, and amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP). Cultural studies indicated isolates from both races were highly variable. No differences were identified within or between races by isozyme analysis. Similarity coefficients, determined from AFLP analysis, indicated that isolates from different races were often more similar than isolates from the same race. Comparison of single representative isolates from Race 1 and Race 2, collected at a Denmark (Western Australia) disease site, with isolates collected from another site of <b>clover</b> <b>scorch</b> outbreak at Esperance, 300 km east of Denmark, indicated most of the isolates causing the second outbreak were similar to Race 2, confirming previously conducted pathogenicity tests. It is hypothesised that Race 2 may have evolved from Race 1, and {{that the level of}} variability in the pathogen indicates the potential for development of further new races of K. caulivora. The requirement for improved selection strategies, including the screening of new cultivars and breeding lines with multiple isolates of the pathogen, is discussed in relation to these findings...|$|E
40|$|<b>Clover</b> <b>scorch</b> (Kabatiella caulivora) is {{a severe}} fungal disease of Trifolium spp. {{contributing}} {{to the collapse of}} pasture swards across southern Australia during warm, humid spring weather. Host plant responses associated with resistance to the disease were determined in 2 cultivars of subterranean clover (T. subterraneum) separately inoculated with K. caulivora Race 1 or Race 2. Germination of conidia of both races reached a maximum 5 days post-inoculation on cv. Woogenellup (susceptible to both races) and 4 days post-inoculation on cv. Daliak (resistant to Race 1 but susceptible to Race 2). Germ tube growth of Race 1 was inhibited on cv. Daliak and the percentage of conidia penetrating leaf surfaces was lowest on this race–cultivar combination. Susceptibility was characterised by large petiole lesions, with invasive hyphae extending through the mesophyll tissue into the pith and then through the phloem tissue of vascular bundles, eventually causing the petioles to collapse. Resistance was characterised by small, black lesions with invasive hyphae extending no further than the fourth layer of mesophyll cells. A suberin-based material was observed beneath infected mesophyll cells in the incompatible interaction, beyond which no further growth of hyphae occurred. Race 2 caused a faster rate of host tissue necrosis than Race 1 and also the breakdown of starch grains in uninvaded petiole tissues. Starch grains in plants infected with Race 1 were evenly distributed in uninvaded tissue. Sporulation was rarely observed in the incompatible interaction but was common in compatible interactions within 15 days post-inoculation. These responses to K. caulivora can now be used as a breeding tool in evaluating and selecting improved resistance to <b>clover</b> <b>scorch</b> disease among breeding lines of subterranean clover...|$|E
40|$|Coolamon is a mid-season to late-season {{flowering}} F 4 -derived crossbred {{subterranean clover}} of var. subterraneum, {{developed by the}} collaborating organisations of the National Annual Pasture Legume Improvement Program. It is a replacement for Junee and has been selected for release {{on the basis of}} its greater herbage production and persistence, and its resistance to both known races of <b>clover</b> <b>scorch.</b> Coolamon is recommended for sowing in Western Australia, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Queensland. It is best suited to well-drained, moderately acidic soils in areas with a growing season of 6. 5 - 8 months that extends into November. Coolamon is best suited to phase farming and permanent pasture systems. It can also be used in cropping rotations, but at least 2 years of pasture are required between crops. Coolamon has been granted Plant Breeders Rights in Australia...|$|E
40|$|Kabatiella caulivora is {{the causal}} {{organism}} of northern anthracnose or <b>clover</b> (Trifolium spp.) <b>scorch</b> disease. The activities of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) and soluble peroxidase were determined in seedling leaves of two cultivars of subterranean clover (T. subterraneum) inoculated with race 1 or race 2 of K. caulivora. A small increase in activity of PAL {{was recorded in}} both cultivars 2 – 4 h post inoculation with either race. A second, large increase in PAL activity was observed only in the incompatible interaction (cv. Daliak inoculated with race 1), increasing 18 -fold between 8 and 48 h post inoculation. Peroxidase activity in cv. Daliak increased rapidly within 2 h post inoculation with either race but was significantly higher in the incompatible interaction. Peroxidase activity in cv. Woogenellup increased by 4 h post inoculation with either race, but was significantly lower than that in cv. Daliak. Subsequent increases in peroxidase activity were recorded in both cultivars, however the levels remained constant in cv. Daliak infected with race 1, while activities in the other race-cultivar combinations decreased to control levels. It is hypothesised that the peak of activity of PAL at 48 h, and the rapid increase in peroxidase at 2 h {{are related to the}} race-specific resistance response of cv. Daliak to race 1 of K. caulivora, and that minor peaks of activity in the compatible interactions are general defence responses...|$|R
40|$|Kabatiella caulivora is {{a serious}} {{pathogen}} of clover (Trifolium) spp. Subterranean clover (T. subterraneum) cv. Woogenellup was inoculated with K. caulivora, to study the attachment and germination of conidia, germ-tube penetration of the plant surface, and histochemistry and ultrastructure {{of changes in the}} host associated with lesion development. The foliar architecture caused the conidia to concentrate at the base of leaflets and on the petiolules (between the leaflets and petioles). Epidermal cells immediately beneath conidia and, occasionally, also adjacent cells developed a yellow-brown discoloration 1 day post-inoculation. Penetration appeared to be directly through the cuticle, characterized by constricted hyphae at the point of entry. No appressoria were observed. In leaves, invasion was restricted to the area proximal to the petiolule and leaf mid-rib. In petioles and petiolules, the hyphae initially remained between the epidermal cells and first layer of mesophyll cells before moving intercellularly through the mesophyll tissue towards phloem tissues. The cuticle was occasionally degraded in petiole and petiolule infections, the loss of epidermal and mesophyll cell wall components was detected, and chloroplasts and starch grains were disrupted. Plants developed macroscopic symptoms 10 - 11 days post-inoculation with necrotic lesions occurring on leaves, petioles and petiolules. Sporulation occurred approximately 15 - 18 days post-inoculation when affected plants collapsed. This information may be useful for breeding programmes aimed at selecting varieties with improved resistance to the <b>clover</b> <b>scorch</b> disease...|$|E
