50|$|Another, more practical, {{method is}} to use weights to force the <b>axis</b> of the <b>compass</b> to remain {{horizontal}} (perpendicular to {{the direction of the}} center of the Earth), but otherwise allow it to rotate freely within the horizontal plane. In this case, gravity will apply a torque forcing the <b>compass's</b> <b>axis</b> toward true north. Because the weights will confine the <b>compass's</b> <b>axis</b> to be horizontal with respect to the Earth's surface, the axis can never align with the Earth's axis (except on the Equator) and must realign itself as the Earth rotates. But with respect to the Earth's surface, the compass will appear to be stationary and pointing along the Earth's surface toward the true North Pole.|$|R
50|$|A gyroscope, {{not to be}} {{confused}} with gyrocompass, is a spinning wheel mounted on a set of gimbals so that its axis is free to orient itself in any way. When it is spun up to speed with its axis pointing in some direction, due to the law of conservation of angular momentum, such a wheel will normally maintain its original orientation to a fixed point in outer space (not to a fixed point on Earth). Since our planet rotates, it appears to a stationary observer on Earth that a gyroscope's axis is completing a full rotation once every 24 hours. Such a rotating gyroscope is used for navigation in some cases, for example on aircraft, where it is known as heading indicator or directional gyro, but cannot ordinarily be used for long-term marine navigation. The crucial additional ingredient needed to turn a gyroscope into a gyrocompass, so it would automatically position to true north, is some mechanism that results in an application of torque whenever the <b>compass's</b> <b>axis</b> is not pointing north.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{the design}} of digital compass with voice output is described, so that the blind can also use it. The digital compass is {{designed}} based on up-graded conventional <b>compass.</b> In the <b>axis</b> direction of conventional compass be added a disc as source of wind direction information, and phototransistor as sensor. The digital compass system is designed, based on AT 89 S 52 microcontroller, as control of all interfaces and read sensor. The LCD component is used as display and ISD 2590 IC as voice recorder. The IC can record with maximum capacity 90 seconds. The voices output of compass is divided into 8 direction from the north, southwest, west and the next. The result showed that {{the design of}} digital compass work as like conventional compass completely by voice feature...|$|R
30|$|Additionally, {{the cart}} {{contains}} an OceanServer OS 5000 precision 3 -Axis Tilt Compensated compass {{that was used}} for both ground truth data and supplemental data for the location algorithm. The features of the 1 ”x 1 ” size <b>compass</b> include 3 <b>axis</b> magnetic sensors, 3 axis accelerometers and 50 MIPS processor that provide precise tilt compensated heading, pitch and roll information. The compass accuracy is 0.5 ° root mean square (RMS) while level, 1 ° RMS[*]<[*]± 30 ° tilt, and 1.5 ° RMS[*]<[*]± 60 ° tilt. Although the compass is accurate enough to provide the location path information, {{the goal of this}} research is to utilize the solely RFID and BIM integration data to estimate the tracking information. However, some data, e.g., cardinal direction, from the compass will be used to supplement the RFID-BIM integration data.|$|R
