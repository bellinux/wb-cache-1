40|$|The <b>capacitance</b> in the {{classical}} approach is completely determined by the device geometry and a dielectric constant of the medium. However, the quantum effects will give {{significant impact on the}} device performance once the transistor approaches the size of nanoscale device and hence the quantum <b>capacitance</b> must be taken into consideration. Considering the consequences of quantum <b>capacitance</b> on the device performance, we decided to work towards the analytical modeling of quantum <b>capacitance</b> in degenerate and nondegenerate regime for Graphene Nanoribbons (GNRs). The effects of classical <b>capacitance</b> in nondegenerate regime and quantum <b>capacitance</b> in degenerate regime are discussed. We showed that in low gate voltage, Vg total <b>capacitance</b> is equivalent to {{the classical}} <b>capacitance</b> but in high gate voltage range, the total <b>capacitance</b> is equivalent to quantum <b>capacitance</b> or in other words in nondegenerate regime, total <b>capacitance</b> was equivalent to the classical <b>capacitance</b> and that the quantum <b>capacitance</b> can be neglected.

30|$|Doping {{nitrogen}} atoms {{could increase}} the quantum <b>capacitance</b> and overcome the limitations of total <b>capacitance</b> at PZC. For the pristine graphene, its quantum <b>capacitance</b> is nearly zero at PZC, leading to the extremely low value of total <b>capacitance,</b> according to the series connection of EDL <b>capacitance</b> and quantum <b>capacitance.</b> To avoid this limitation, one of the feasible methods is doping with nitrogen atoms. This method can increase the quantum <b>capacitance,</b> by changing the electrode structure.

25|$|The {{magnitude}} and sign of both those parameters {{are controlled by}} the base current : since both base-collector and base-emitter junctions are inversely biased in the quiescent state, the equivalent circuit of the base input is simply a current generator shunted by base-emitter and base-collector junction <b>capacitances</b> and is therefore not analyzed in what follows.|$|E
25|$|The source-to-body and drain-to-body {{junctions}} are {{the object}} of much attention because of three major factors: their design affects the current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of the device, lowering output resistance, and also {{the speed of the}} device through the loading effect of the junction <b>capacitances,</b> and finally, the component of stand-by power dissipation due to junction leakage.|$|E

50|$|<b>Capacitance</b> is {{the ability}} of a body to store an {{electric}} charge. There are two closely related notions of capacitance: self <b>capacitance</b> and mutual <b>capacitance.</b> Any object that can be electrically charged exhibits self <b>capacitance.</b> A material with a large self <b>capacitance</b> holds more electric charge at a given voltage, than one with low <b>capacitance.</b> The notion of mutual <b>capacitance</b> is particularly important for understanding the operations of the capacitor, one of the three fundamental electronic components (along with resistors and inductors).|$|R

For the CE topology, an approximate h-parameter model {{is commonly used}} which further simplifies the circuit analysis. For this the hoe and hre parameters are neglected (that is, they are set to infinity and zero, respectively). The h-parameter model as shown is suited to low-frequency, small-signal analysis. For high-frequency analyses the inter-electrode <b>capacitances</b> that are important at high frequencies must be added.|$|E
25|$|CNTs give a {{backbone}} for {{a homogeneous}} distribution of metal oxide or electrically conducting polymers (ECPs), producing good pseudocapacitance and good double-layer capacitance.

25|$|The {{capacitance}} value {{specified in}} the data sheets of the manufacturers is called rated capacitance CR or nominal capacitance CN and is the value for which the capacitor has been designed. Standardized measuring condition for electrolytic capacitors is an AC measuring method with a frequency of 100 to 120Hz. Electrolytic capacitors differ from other capacitor types, whose <b>capacitances</b> are typically measured at 1kHz or higher. For tantalum capacitors a DC bias voltage of 1.1 to 1.5V for types with a rated voltage of ≤2.5V or 2.1 to 2.5V for types with a rated voltage of >2.5V may be applied during the measurement to avoid reverse voltage.|$|E
25|$|In May 1952, Sidney Darlington filed {{a patent}} {{application}} in the United States for a structure {{with two or}} three transistors integrated onto a single chip in various configurations; in October 1952, Bernard Oliver filed a patent application for a method of manufacturing three electrically connected planar transistors on one semiconductor crystal. On May 21, 1953, Harwick Johnson filed a patent application for a method of forming various electronic components – transistors, resistors, lumped and distributed <b>capacitances</b> – on a single chip. Johnson described three ways of producing an integrated one-transistor oscillator. All of them used a narrow strip of a semiconductor with a bipolar transistor on one end and differed in the methods of producing the transistor. The strip acted as a series of resistors; the lumped capacitors were formed by fusion whereas inverse-biased p-n junctions acted as distributed capacitors. Johnson did not offer a technological procedure, and it is not known whether he produced an actual device. In 1959, a variant of his proposal was implemented and patented by Jack Kilby.|$|E

25|$|It {{follows that}} the total <b>capacitance</b> of the {{capacitor}} Ce-cap is mainly determined by the anode <b>capacitance</b> CA when the cathode <b>capacitance</b> CK is very large compared with the anode <b>capacitance</b> CA. This requirement is given when the cathode <b>capacitance</b> CK is approximately 10 {{times higher than the}} anode <b>capacitance</b> CA. This can be easily achieved because the natural oxide layer on a cathode surface has a voltage proof of approximately 1.5V and is therefore very thin.|$|R

A physical interpretation of k can be given by observing that k is the limiting value of Zi as the size of the section (in terms of values of its components, such as inductances, <b>capacitances,</b> etc.) approaches zero, while keeping k at its initial value. Thus, k is the characteristic impedance, Z0, of the transmission line that would be formed by these infinitesimally small sections.

500|$|It is {{possible}} to design filters that operate internally entirely in evanescent modes. [...] This has space saving advantages because the filter waveguide, which often forms the housing of the filter, {{does not need to}} be large enough to support propagation of the dominant mode. [...] Typically, an evanescent mode filter consists of a length of waveguide smaller than the waveguide feeding the input and output ports. [...] In some designs this may be folded to achieve a more compact filter. [...] Tuning screws are inserted at specific intervals along the waveguide producing equivalent lumped <b>capacitances</b> at those points. [...] In more recent designs the screws are replaced with dielectric inserts. [...] These capacitors resonate with the preceding length of evanescent mode waveguide which has the equivalent circuit of an inductor, thus producing a filtering action.
