2500|$|Friedrich Schiller {{was born}} on 10 November 1759, in Marbach, Württemberg as the only son of {{military}} doctor Johann Kaspar Schiller (1733–1796) and Elisabeth Dorothea Kodweiß (1732–1802). They also had five daughters, including <b>Christophine,</b> the eldest. Schiller {{grew up in a}} very religious family and spent much of his youth studying the Bible, which would later influence his writing for the theatre. [...] His father was away in the Seven Years' War when Friedrich was born. He was named after king Frederick the Great, but he was called Fritz by nearly everyone. Kaspar Schiller was rarely home during the war, but he did manage to visit the family once in a while. His wife and children also visited him occasionally wherever he happened to be stationed. When the war ended in 1763, Schiller's father became a recruiting officer and was stationed in Schwäbisch Gmünd. The family moved with him. Due to the high cost of living—especially the rent—the family moved to nearby Lorch.|$|E

6000|$|What {{could have}} induced, in the calm and well-discerning <b>Christophine,</b> such a resolution, {{is by no}} means clear; Saupe, with hesitation, seems to assign a {{religious}} motive, [...] "the desire of doing good." [...] Had that abrupt and peremptory dismissal of Lieutenant Miller perhaps something to do with it? Probably her Father's humour on the matter, at all times so anxious and zealous to see his Daughters settled, had a chief effect. It is certain, <b>Christophine</b> consulted her Parish Clergyman on the affair; and got from him, as Saupe shows us, an affirmatory or at least permissive response. Certain also that she summoned her own best insight of all kinds to the subject, and settled it calmly and irrevocably with whatever faculty was in her.|$|E

60|$|To Reinwald himself <b>Christophine's</b> {{presence}} and presidency in his dim household were an infinite benefit,—though not much recognised by him, but accepted {{rather as a}} natural tribute due to unfortunate down-pressed worth, till towards the very end, when the singular merit of it began to dawn upon him, like {{the brightness of the}} Sun when it is setting. Poor man, he anxiously spent the last two weeks of his life in purchasing and settling about a neat little cottage for Christophine; where accordingly she passed her long widowhood, on stiller terms, though not on less beneficent and humbly beautiful, than her marriage had offered.|$|R

[...] "Once," [...] so stands it in <b>Christophine's</b> Memorials, [...] "when we two, as children, had set out walking with dear Mamma to see our Grandparents, she took the way from Ludwigsburg to Marbach, which leads {{straight}} over the Hill, a walk of some four miles. It was a beautiful Easter Monday, and our Mother related to us the history of the two Disciples to whom, on their journey to Emmaus, Jesus had joined himself. Her speech and narrative grew ever more inspired; and when we got upon the Hill, we were all so much affected that we knelt down and prayed. This Hill became a Tabor to us." ...|$|R
6000|$|Till Schiller's flight, {{in which}} what endless {{interest}} and industries <b>Christophine</b> had {{we have already}} seen, the young girls,—Christophine 25, Luise 16, Nanette a rosy little creature of 5,—had known no misfortune; nor, except Christophine's feelings {{on the death of}} the two little Sisters, years ago, no heavy sorrow. At Solitüde, but for the general cloud of anxiety and grief about their loved and gifted Brother and his exile, their lives were of the peaceablest description: diligence in household business, sewing, spinning, contented punctuality in all things; in leisure hours eager reading (or at times, on Christophine's part, drawing and painting, in which she attained considerable excellence), and, as choicest recreation, walks amid the flourishing Nurseries, Tree-avenues, and fine solid industries and forest achievements of Papa. Mention is made of a Cavalry Regiment stationed at Solitüde; the young officers of which, without society in that dull place, and with no employment except parade, were considerably awake to the comely Jungfers Schiller and their promenadings in those pleasant woods: one Lieutenant of them (afterwards a Colonel, 'Obrist von Miller of Stuttgart') is said to have manifested honourable aspirations and intentions towards Christophine,—which, however, and all connection with whom or his comrades, the rigorously prudent Father strictly forbade; his piously obedient Daughters, <b>Christophine</b> it is rather thought with some regret, immediately conforming. A Portrait of this Von Miller, painted by <b>Christophine,</b> still exists, it would appear, among the papers of the Schillers.[62] ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Externally little Fritz and his Sister {{were not}} like; <b>Christophine</b> more {{resembling}} the Father, whilst Friedrich was {{the image of}} the Mother. On the other hand, they had internally very much in common; both possessed a lively apprehension for whatever was true, beautiful or good. Both had a temper capable of enthusiasm, which early and chiefly turned towards the sublime and grand: in short, the strings of their souls were tuned on a cognate tone. Add to this, that both, in the beautifulest, happiest period of their life, had been under the sole care and direction of the pious genial Mother; and that Fritz, at least till his sixth year, was exclusively limited to Christophine's society, and had no other companion. They two had to be, and were, all to each other. <b>Christophine</b> on this account stood nearer to her Brother throughout all his life than the Sisters who were born later.|$|E
60|$|Of Luise's life too, {{except what}} was shown above, there need little be said. In the dismal pestilential days at Solitüde, while her Father lay dying, and poor Nanette caught the infection, Luise, {{with all her}} tender assiduities and {{household}} talent, was there; but, soon after Nanette's death, the fever seized her too; and she long lay dangerously ill in that forlorn household; still weak, but slowly recovering, when <b>Christophine</b> arrived.|$|E
6000|$|... 'The indescribable {{impression}} {{which the}} Robbers, the gigantic first-born of a Karl's Scholar, made in Stuttgart, communicated {{itself to the}} Mother too; innocently she gave herself up {{to the delight of}} seeing her Son's name wondered at and celebrated; and was, in her Mother-love, inventive enough to overcome all doubts and risks which threatened to dash her joy. By <b>Christophine's</b> mediations, and from the Son himself as well, she learned many a disquieting circumstance, which for the present had to be carefully concealed from her Husband; but nothing whatever could shake her belief in her Son and his talent. Without murmur, with faithful trust in God, she resigned herself even to the bitter necessity of losing for a long time her only Son; having once got to see, beyond disputing, that his purpose was firm to withdraw himself by flight from the Duke's despotic interference with his poetical activity as well as with his practical procedures; and that this purpose of his was rigorously demanded by the circumstances. Yet a sword went through her soul when Schiller, for the last time, appeared at Solitüde, secretly to take leave of her.' Her feelings on this tragic occasion have been described above; and may well be pictured as among the painfulest, tenderest and saddest that a Mother's heart could have to bear.

40|$|Poor {{marketing}} and distribution frequently waste opportunities provided by increased or diversified agricultural production There are many examples where farmers have produced higher yields or cultivated new crops at their own expense and risk but have not benefited from any increased income. Instead, they may have suffered financial loss from investing in higher inputs or labour. It {{is not surprising that}} farmers become disappointed and revert to less onerous and risky production strategies to meet local needs only. This limits their income and stifles the development of a rural economy. It also deprives the country of much-needed food for the cities and of products to export for foreign exchange. Many, governments have now recognized the need for improved marketing, distribution and exports. One particularly successful example is the Dominica Export Import Agency (DEXIA), which was set up by the Government of Dominica in July 1986. In less than three years it has achieved some dramatic results. DEXIA is responsible for issuing licences for the import of basic food commodities such as rice and sugar. So it controls imports, allowing local production to satisfy the domestic market first. However, DEXIA's main objective is to encourage, help and provide facilities for the private sector in Dominica to increase exports of vegetables, fruit, flowers and handicrafts. There are 20 - 25 commodities currently exported and DEXIA has prayed an important,sometimes crucial, role in finding or developing markets for them New markets Bananas are the main crop in Dominica; they are marketed through the Banana Marketing Corporation. Similarly, the bulk of coconut production is processed by Dominica Coconut Products, which manufactures a wide range of value-added coconut-based products including coconut oil and soaps. But green water nuts or jelly nuts, which previously were sold only locally, are now exported by a co-operative of growers which was formed originally to export plantains. DEXIA staff identified a market for jellynuts and plantains among expatriate Dominicans and other West Indians in the United Kingdom. The cooperative supplying this market now exports 16 times the value of plantains each fortnight that it exported in its early months of activity in 1986. Grapefruit and limes are two other long established crops In Dominica, yet new markets have been found for both crops and various products have been developed from limes to supplement the sale of fresh fruit. Mangoes, avocados and various root crops are also being exported in increasing quantities, and so are fresh flowers, herbs and spices (including ginger). DEXIA has worked in parallel with the existing cooperative of flower and ornamental growers to increase production of anthuriums, red ginger lilies and helleconia. New hybrid anthuriums have been introduced, and DEXIA has played a role in improving the quality of packaging. 20 point programme As a statutory government body, DEXIA works to fulfil its brief either by increasing exports in response to existing production or in response to new markets. Production-led export development is where existing crops are available and expansion of the market is sought to absorb surplus existing production. Market-led export development is where a new market is discovered, but either there is no existing production or existing production, does not match market requirements in terms of quality, quantity' or season of supply. Two examples where new markets were identified were red peppers and <b>christophines,</b> both of which have long been grown in Dominica. A visit by a senior DEXIA staff member to Canada established that the market there demanded the Scotch Bonnet variety of red peppers and white <b>christophines.</b> Until then, it was rare to find pure Scotch Bonnet peppers in Dominica and most of the <b>christophines</b> grown were of the green variety, so production was changed to match the special needs of the newly identified market. Marketing assistance In some countries statutory marketing organisations provide the only outlet for some or all products and therefore dominate the market and the farmers. In Dominica government policy is that commercial activity shall {{be in the hands of}} the private sector. Therefore DEXIA'S role is to assist the private sector by helping to form groups of growers; by serving individuals and groups with market intelligence; by advising on transport, credit sources and insurance requirements; and by helping groups to negotiate with shipping and air lines to obtain must favourable terms DEXIA may also test a new market by underwriting the supply of a pilot shipment but, once the needs of the market are established, it is left to the private sector to develop the new market opportunity. An example was when a company in France requested produce grown without ferdlizer or pesticides. Organically grown produce commands significantly higher prices and DEXIA, recognizing this as a potential new market, supplied a trial shipment of grapefruit, dried coconut and herbs. It will now be up to local growers to produce to the criteria specified and to supply further shipments. > is a new phrase for something that skilled traders have always recognised: in a competitive marketplace it is essential to recognize the precise needs of buyers and to judge how best your products can satisfy these needs. And, if a buyer demands a new product, this provides an opportunity for developing new lines of goods. Finally, high quality and efficient transportation remain as vital as ever.

6000|$|The {{marriage}} was childless; not, in the first, {{or in any}} times of it, to be called unhappy; but, as the weight of years was added, <b>Christophine's</b> problem grew ever more difficult. She was of a compassionate nature, and had a loving, patient and noble heart; prudent she was; the skilfulest and thriftiest of financiers; could well keep silence, too, and with a gentle stoicism endure much small unreason. Saupe says withal, 'Nobody liked a laugh better, or could laugh more heartily than she, even in her extreme old age.'—Christophine herself makes no complaint, on looking back upon her poor Reinwald, thirty years after all was over. Her final record of it is: [...] "for twenty-nine years we lived contentedly together." [...] But her rugged hypochondriac of a Husband, morbidly sensitive to the least interruption of his whims and habitudes, never absent from their one dim sitting-room, except on the days {{in which he had}} to attend at the Library, was in practice infinitely difficult to deal with; and seems to have kept her matchless qualities in continual exercise. He belonged to the class called in Germany Stubengelehrten (Closet Literary-men), who publish little or nothing that brings them profit, but are continually poring and studying. Study was the one consolation he had in life; and formed his continual employment {{to the end of his}} days. He was deep in various departments, Antiquarian, Philological, Historical; deep especially in Gothic philology, in which last he did what is reckoned a real feat,—he, Reinwald, though again it was another who got the reward. He had procured somewhere, 'a Transcript of the famous Anglo-Saxon Poem Heliand (Saviour) from the Cotton Library in England,' this he, with unwearied labour and to great perfection, had at last got ready for the press; Translation, Glossary, Original all in readiness;—but could find no Publisher, nobody that would print without a premium. Not to earn less than nothing by his labour, he sent the Work to the München Library; where, in after years, one Schmeller found it, and used it for an editio princeps of his own. Sic vos non vobis; heavy-laden Reinwald![64]— ...|$|R

The first {{effect of this}} new enjoyment, which Fritz and his Sister strove to repeat {{as often as they}} could, was that at home, with little clipped and twisted paper dolls, they set about {{representing}} scenes; and on Christophine's part it had the more important result of awakening and nourishing, at an early age, her æsthetic taste. Schiller considered her, ever after these youthful sports, as a true and faithful companion in his poetic dreams and attempts; and constantly not only told his Sister, whose silence on such points could be perfect, of all that he secretly did in the way of verse-making in the Karl's School,—which, as we shall see, he entered in 1773,—but if possible brought it upon the scene with her. Scenes from the lyrical operetta of Semele were acted by Schiller and <b>Christophine,</b> on those terms; which appears in a complete shape {{for the first time in}} Schiller's Anthology, printed 1782.[50] ...|$|E

'From {{the time}} of her arrival there, no week passed without Schiller's writing home; and his Letters much contributed to {{strengthen}} and support the heavy-laden Mother. The assurance of being tenderly loved by such a Son was infinitely grateful to her; she considered him as a tried faithful friend, to whom one, without reluctance, yields his part in one's own sorrows. Schiller thus expressed himself on this matter in a Letter to <b>Christophine</b> of 9th May. [...] "The last Letter of my dear good Mother has deeply affected me. Ah, how much has this good Mother already undergone; and with what patience and courage has she borne it! How touching is it that she opened her heart to me; and what woe was mine that I cannot immediately comfort and soothe her! Hadst thou not gone, I could not have stayed here. The situation of our dear ones was horrible; so solitary, without help from loving friends, and as if forsaken by their two children, living far away! I dare not think of it. What did not our good Mother do for her Parents; and how greatly has she deserved the like from us! Thou wilt comfort her, dear Sister; and me thou wilt find heartily ready for all that thou canst propose to me. Salute our dear Parents in the tenderest way, and tell them that their Son feels their sorrows." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>Christophine,</b> Schiller's eldest Sister, whom {{he always}} loved the most, was not here in Swabia;—long hundred miles away, poor <b>Christophine,</b> with her sickly and gloomy Husband at Meiningen, these ten years past!—but the younger two, Luise and Nanette, were with him, the former daily at his hand. Luise was then twenty-seven, and is {{described}} as an excellent domestic creature, amiable affectionate, even enthusiastic; yet who at an early period though full of admiration about her Brother and his affairs, had turned all her faculties and tendencies upon domestic practicality, and the satisfaction of being useful to her loved ones in their daily life and wants.[56] 'Her element was altogether house-management; the aim of her endeavour to attain the virtues by which she saw her pious Mother made happy herself, in making others happy in the narrow in-door kingdom. This quiet household vocation with its manifold labours and its simple joys, was Luise's world; beyond which she needed nothing and demanded nothing. From her Father she had inherited this feeling for the practical, and this restless activity; from the Mother her piety, compassion and kindliness; from both, the love of order, regularity and contentment. Luise, in the weak state of Schiller's Wife's health, was right glad {{to take charge of}} her Brother's housekeeping; and, first at Heilbronn and then at Ludwigsburg, did it to the complete satisfaction both of Brother and Sister-in-law. Schiller himself gives to Körner the grateful testimony, that she [...] "very well understands household management." ...|$|E
6000|$|Under these continual {{pressures}} and discouragements poor Reinwald's heart had got hardened into mutinous indignation, and his health had broken down: so that, by this time, he was {{noted in his}} little world as a solitary, taciturn, morose and gloomy man; but greatly respected by the few who knew him better, as a clear-headed, true and faithful person, much distinguished by intellectual clearness and veracity, by solid scholarly acquirements and sterling worth of character. To bring a little help or cheerful alleviation to such a down-pressed man, if a wise and gentle <b>Christophine</b> could accomplish it, would surely {{be a bit of}} well-doing; but it was an extremely difficult one! ...|$|E

"Thou understandest how in {{the first}} days of this fatal [...] breach among us, while so many painful things storm-in upon [...] our good Mother, thy <b>Christophine</b> could not have left, even [...] had the Post been in free course. But this still remains [...] stopped, and we must wait the War-events on the Franconian, [...] Swabian and Palatinate borders.

Alas, public [...] and universal disorder rolls up into itself our private [...] events too, in the fatalest way.|$|E
6000|$|... 'In rural stillness, and {{in almost}} {{uninterrupted}} converse with out-door nature, flowed by for Fritz and her the greatest {{part of their}} childhood and youth. Especially dear to them was their abode in this romantic region. Every hour that was free from teaching or other task, they employed in roaming about in the neighbourhood; and they knew no higher joy than a ramble into the neighbouring hills. In particular they liked to make pilgrimages together to a chapel on the Calvary Hill at Gmünd, a few miles off, to which the way was still through the old monkish grief-stations, on to the Cloister of Lorch noticed above. Often they would sit with closely-grasped hands, under the thousand-years-old Linden, which stood on a projection before the Cloister-walls, and seemed to whisper to them long-silent tales of past ages. On these walks {{the hearts of the}} two clasped each other ever closer and more firmly, and they faithfully shared their little childish joys and sorrows. <b>Christophine</b> would bitterly weep when her vivacious Brother had committed some small misdeed and was punished for it. In such cases, she often enough confessed Fritz's faults as her own, and was punished when she had in reality had no complicity in them. It was with great sorrow that they two parted from their little Paradise; and both of them always retained a great affection for Lorch and its neighbourhood. <b>Christophine,</b> who lived to be ninety, often even in her latter days looked back with tender affection to their abode there.[47] ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'The Seven-Years War {{threw the}} young Wife into {{manifold}} anxiety and agitation; especially {{since she had}} become a Mother, and in fear for the life of her tenderly-loved Husband, had to tremble for the Father of her children too. To this circumstance <b>Christophine</b> ascribes, certainly with some ground, the world-important fact that her Brother had a much weaker constitution than herself. He had in fact been almost born in a camp. In late Autumn 1759, the Infantry Regiment of Major-General Romann, in which Caspar Schiller was then a Lieutenant, had, for sake of the Autumn Manœuvres of the Würtemberg Soldiery, taken Camp in its native region. The Mother had thereupon set out from Marbach to visit her long-absent Husband in the Camp; and it was in his tent that she felt the first symptoms of her travail. She rapidly hastened back to Marbach; and by good luck still reached her Father's house in the Market-Place there, near by the great Fountain; where she, on the 11th November, was delivered of a Boy. For almost four years the little Friedrich with <b>Christophine</b> and Mother continued in the house of the well-contented Grandparents (who had not yet fallen poor), under her exclusive care. With self-sacrificing love and careful fidelity, she nursed her little Boy; whose tender body had to suffer not only from the common ailments of children, but was heavily visited with fits of cramp. In a beautiful region, on the bosom of a tender Mother, and in these first years far from the oversight of a rigorous Father, the Child grew up, and unfolded himself under cheerful and harmonious impressions.|$|E
60|$|<b>Christophine,</b> by pious prudence, {{faith in}} Heaven, {{and in the}} good fruits of real {{goodness}} even on Earth, had greatly comforted the gloomy, disappointed, pain-stricken man; enlightened his darkness, and made his poverty noble. Simplex munditiis might have been her motto in all things. Her beautiful Letters to her Brother are full of cheerful, though also, it is true, sad enough, allusions to her difficulties with Reinwald, and partial successes. Poor soul, her hopes, too, are gently turned sometimes on a blessed future, which might still lie ahead: of her at last coming, as a Widow, {{to live with her}} Brother, in serene affection, like that of their childhood together; in a calm blessedness such as the world held no other for her! But gloomy Reinwald survived bright Schiller for above ten years; and she had thirty more of lone widowhood, under limited conditions, to spend after him, still in a noble, humbly-admirable, and even happy and contented manner. She was the flower of the Schiller Sisterhood, though all three are beautiful to us; and in poor Nane, there is even something of poetic, and tragically pathetic. For one blessing, <b>Christophine</b> 'lived almost always in good health.' Through life it may be said of her, she was helpful to all about her, never hindersome to any; and merited, and had, the universal esteem, from high and low, of those she had lived among. At Meiningen, 31st August 1847, within a few days of her ninety-first year, without almost one day's sickness, a gentle stroke of apoplexy took her suddenly away, and so ended what may be called a Secular Saintlike existence, mournfully beautiful, wise and noble to all that had beheld it.|$|E
6000|$|... 'The {{excellent}} <b>Christophine</b> did her utmost {{in these}} days of sorrow. She comforted her Mother, and faithfully nursed her Father to his last breath; nay she saved him and the house, with great presence of mind, on a sudden inburst of French soldiers. Nor did she return to Meiningen till all tumult of affairs was past, and the Mother was again a little composed. And composure the Mother truly needed; for in a short space she had seen a hopeful Daughter and a faithful Husband laid in their graves; and by the death of her Husband a union severed which, originating in mutual affection, had for forty-seven years been blessed with the same mutual feeling. To all which in her position was now added the doubly-pressing care about her future days. Here, however, the Son so dear to her interposed with loving readiness, and the tender manner natural to him: ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Thus {{by degrees}} there ripened {{in the strong}} soul of this young man the {{determination}} to burst these laming fetters of his genius, by flight from despotic Würtemberg altogether; and, in some friendlier country, gain for himself the freedom without which his spiritual development was impossible. Only to one friend, who clung to him with almost enthusiastic devotion, did he impart his secret. This was Johann Andreas Streicher of Stuttgart, who intended to go next year to Hamburg, and there, under Bach's guidance, study music; but declared himself ready to accompany Schiller even now, since it had become urgent. Except to this trustworthy friend, Schiller had imparted his plan to his elder Sister <b>Christophine</b> alone; and she had not only approved of the sad measure, but had undertaken also to prepare their Mother for it. The Father naturally had to be kept dark on the subject; all the more that, if need were, he might pledge his word as an Officer that he had known nothing of his Son's intention.|$|E
6000|$|The great {{transaction}} of her life, {{her marriage}} with Reinwald, Court Librarian of Meiningen, had its origin in 1783; {{the fruit of}} that forced retreat of Schiller's to Bauerbach, and of the eight months he spent there, under covert, anonymously and in secret, as 'Dr. Ritter,' with Reinwald for his one friend and adviser. Reinwald, who commanded the resources of an excellent Library, and of a sound understanding, long seriously and painfully cultivated, was of essential use to Schiller; and is reckoned {{to be the first}} real guide or useful counsellor he ever had in regard to Literature. One of Christophine's Letters to her Brother, written at her Father's order, fell by accident on Reinwald's floor, and was read by him,—awakening in his over-clouded, heavy-laden mind a gleam of hope and aspiration. [...] "This wise, prudent, loving-hearted and judicious young woman, of such clear and salutary principles of wisdom as to economics too, what a blessing she might be to me as Wife in this dark, lonely home of mine!" [...] Upon which hint he spake; and Schiller, as we saw above, who loved him well, but knew him to be within a year or two of fifty, always ailing in health, taciturn, surly, melancholy, and miserably poor, was rebuked by Papa for thinking it questionable. We said, it came about all the same. Schiller had not yet left Mannheim for the second and last time, when, in 1784, <b>Christophine</b> paid him a visit, escorted thither by Reinwald; who had begged to have that honour allowed him; having been at Solitüde, and, either there or on his road to Mannheim, concluded his affair. Streicher, an eyewitness of this visit, says, [...] "The healthy, cheerful and blooming Maiden had determined to share her future lot with a man whose small income and uncertain health seemed to promise little joy. Nevertheless her reasons were of so noble a sort, that she never repented, in times following, this sacrifice of her fancy to her understanding, and to a Husband of real worth."[63] They were married [...] "June 1786;" [...] and for the next thirty, or indeed, in all, sixty years, <b>Christophine</b> lived in her dark new home at Meiningen; and never, except in that melancholy time of sickness, mortality and war, appears to have seen Native Land and Parents again.|$|E

For economics were, by Schiller's own confession, [...] "not at all his talent; it cost him less," [...] he says, [...] "to execute a whole conspiracy and tragedy-plot than to adjust his scheme of housekeeping."—At {{this time it was}} never the Father himself who wrote to Schiller, but always <b>Christophine,</b> by his commission; and on the other hand, Schiller too never risked writing directly to his Father, as he felt but too well how little on his part had been done to justify the flight in his Father's eyes. He writes accordingly, likewise on that 8th December 1782, to his Publisher Schwan: [...] "If you can accelerate the printing of my Fiesco, you will very much oblige me by doing so. You know that nothing but the prohibition to become an Author drove me out of the Würtemberg service. If I now, on this side, don't soon let my native country hear of me, they will say the step I took was useless and without real motive." ...|$|E

'In Autumn 1783, there seized Schiller so irresistible {{a longing}} {{to see his}} kindred again, that he {{repeatedly}} expressed to his Father the great wish he had for a meeting, either at Mannheim or some other place outside the Würtemberg borders. To the fulfilment of this scheme there were, however, in the sickness which his Mother had fallen into, in the fettered position of the Father, and in the rigorously frugal economies of the Family, insuperable obstacles. Whereupon his Father made him the proposal, that he, Friedrich, either himself or by him, the Captain, should apply to the Duke Karl's Serene Highness; and petition him for permission {{to return to his}} country and kindred. As Schiller to this answered nothing, <b>Christophine</b> time after time pressingly repeated to him the Father's proposal. At the risk of again angering his Father, Schiller gave, in his answer to <b>Christophine,</b> of 1st January 1784, the decisive declaration that his honour would frightfully suffer if he, without connection with any other Prince, without character and lasting means of support, after his forceful withdrawal from Würtemberg, should again show face there. [...] "That my Father," [...] adds he, as ground of this refusal, [...] "give his name to such a petition can help me little; for every one will at once, so long as I cannot make it plain that I no longer need the Duke of Würtemberg, suspect in a return, obtained on petition (by myself or by another is all one), a desire to get settled in Würtemberg again. Sister, consider with serious attention these circumstances; for the happiness of thy Brother may, by rash haste in this matter, suffer an incurable wound. Great part of Germany knows of my relations to your Duke and of the way I left him. People have interested themselves for me at the expense of this Duke; how horribly would the respect of the public (and on this depends my whole future fortune), how miserably would my own honour sink by the suspicion that I had sought this return; that my circumstances had forced me to repent my former step; that the support which I had sought in the wide world had misgone, and I was seeking it anew in my Birthland! The open manlike boldness, which I showed in my forceful withdrawal, would get the name of a childish outburst of mutiny, a stupid bit of impotent bluster, if I do not make it good. Love for my dear ones, longing for my Fatherland might perhaps excuse me in the heart of this or the other candid man; but the world makes no account of all that.|$|E

'His Wife, who, {{during these}} War-times, lived, on money sent by him, in her Father's house at Marbach, {{he could only}} visit seldom, and for short periods in winter-quarters, much as he longed for his {{faithful}} Wife; who, {{after the birth of}} a Daughter, in September 1757, was dearer to him than ever. But never had the rigid fetters of War-discipline appeared more oppressive than when, two years later, in November 1759, a Son, the Poet, was born. With joyful thanks to God, he saluted this dear Gift of Heaven; in daily prayer commended Mother and Child to [...] "the Being of all Beings;" [...] and waited now with impatience the time when he should revisit his home, and those that were his there. Yet there still passed four years before Father Schiller, on conclusion of the Hubertsburg Peace, 1763, could return home from the War, and again take up his permanent residence in his home-country. Where, on his return, his first Garrison quarters were, whether at Ludwigsburg, Cannstadt or what other place, is not known. On the other hand, all likelihoods are, that, so soon as he could find it possible, he carried over his Wife and his two Children, the little Daughter <b>Christophine</b> six, and the little Friedrich now four, out of Marbach to his own quarters, wherever these were.' ...|$|E

'With the repose {{and peace}} which {{the news of}} her Son's {{appointment}} to Jena, and intended marriage, had restored to his Family, there appeared also (beginning of 1790) an improvement to be {{taking place in the}} Mother's health. Learning this by a Letter from his Father, Schiller wrote back with lightened heart: [...] "How welcome, dearest Father, was your last Letter to me, and how necessary! I had, the very day before, got from <b>Christophine</b> the sad news that my dearest Mother's state had grown so much worse; and what a blessed turn now has this weary sickness taken! If in the future regimen vitæ (diet arrangements) of my dearest Mother, there is strict care taken, her long and many sufferings, with the source of them, may be removed. Thanks to a merciful Providence, which saves and preserves for us the dear Mother of our youth. My soul is moved with tenderness and gratitude. I had to think of her as lost to us forever; and she has now been given back." [...] In reference to his approaching marriage with Lottchen von Lengefeld, he adds, [...] "How did it lacerate my heart to think that my dearest Mother might not live to see the happiness of her Son! Heaven bless you with thousandfold blessings, best Father, and grant to my dear Mother a cheerful and painless life!" ...|$|E

As thou, my Son, partly straight out, and partly through Frau von Kalb, hast pictured Reinwald {{in a way to}} deter both me and thy Sister in counselling and negotiating in the way we intended, the affair seems to have become quite retrograde: for Reinwald, these two months past, has not written a word more. Whether thou, my Son, didst well to hinder a match not unsuitable for the age, and the narrow pecuniary circumstances of thy Sister, God, who sees into futurity, knows. As I am now sixty-one years of age, and can leave little fortune when I die; and as thou, my Son, how happily soever thy hopes be fulfilled, wilt yet have to struggle, years long, to get out of these present embarrassments, and arrange thyself suitably; and as, after that, thy own probable marriage will always require thee to have more thy own advantages in view, than to be able to trouble thyself much about those of thy Sisters;—it would not, all things considered, have been ill if <b>Christophine</b> had got a settlement. She would quite certainly, with her apparent regard for Reinwald, have been able to fit herself into his ways and him; all the better as she, God be thanked, is not yet smit with ambition, and the wish for great things, and can suit herself to all conditions." ...|$|E

"Very unwilling," [...] writes he, [...] "am I {{to proceed}} to the {{answering}} of thy last Letter, 21st November of the past year; which I could rather wish never to have read than now to taste again the bitterness contained there. Not enough that thou, {{in the beginning of}} the said Letter, very undeservedly reproachest me, as if I could and should have raised the 300 gulden for thee,—thou continuest to blame me, in a very painful way, for my inquiries about thee on this occasion. Dear Son, the relation between a good Father and his Son fallen into such a strait, who, although gifted with many faculties of mind, is still, in all that belongs to true greatness and contentment, much mistaken and astray, can never justify the Son in taking up as an injury what the Father has said out of love, out of consideration and experience of his own, and meant only for his Son's good. As to what concerns those 300 gulden, every one, alas, who knows my position here, knows that it cannot be possible for me to have even 50 gulden, not to speak of 300, before me in store; and that I should borrow such a sum, to the still farther disadvantage of my other children, for a Son, who of the much that he has promised me has been able to perform so little,—there, for certain, were I an unjust Father." [...] Farther on, the old man takes him up on another side, a private family affair. Schiller had, directly and through others, in reference to the prospect of a marriage between his elder Sister <b>Christophine</b> and his friend Reinwald the Court Librarian of Meiningen, expressed himself in a doubting manner, and thereby delayed the settlement of this affair. In regard to which his Father tells him: ...|$|E

And the next-following years did pass untroubled over the prosperous Family. But [...] "ill-luck," [...] as the proverb says, [...] "comes with a long stride." [...] In the Spring of 1796, when the French, under Jourdan and Moreau, had overrun South Germany, there reached Schiller, on a sudden, {{alarming}} tidings from Solitüde. In the Austrian chief Hospital, which had been established in the Castle there, an epidemic fever had broken out; and had visited the Schiller Family among others. The youngest Daughter Nanette had sunk under this pestilence, in the flower of her years; and whilst the second Daughter Luise lay like to die of the same, the Father also was laid bedrid with gout. For fear of infection, nobody except the Doctors would risk himself at Solitüde; and so the poor weakly Mother stood forsaken there, and had, for months long, to bear alone the whole burden of the household distress. Schiller felt it painfully that {{he was unable to}} help his loved ones, in so terrible a posture of affairs; and it cost him great effort to hide these feelings from his friends. In his pain and anxiety, he turned himself at last to his eldest Sister <b>Christophine,</b> Wife of Hofrath Reinwald in Meiningen; and persuaded her to go to Solitüde to comfort and support her people there. Had not the true Sister-heart at once acceded to her Brother's wishes, he had himself taken the firm determination to go in person to Swabia, in the middle of May, and bring his Family away from Solitüde, and make arrangements for their nursing and accommodation. The news of his Sister's setting-out relieved him of a great and continual anxiety. [...] "Heaven bless thee," [...] writes he to her on the 6th May, [...] "for this proof of thy filial love." [...] He earnestly entreats her to prevent his dear Parents from delaying, out of thrift, any wholesome means of improvement to their health; and declares himself ready, with joy, to bear all costs, those of travelling included: she is to draw on Cotta in Tübingen for whatever money she needs. Her Husband also he thanks, in a cordial Letter, for his consent to this journey of his Wife.|$|E

"You, dear Mother," [...] he writes, [...] "must now choose wholly for {{yourself}} what {{your way of}} life is to be; and let there be, I charge you, no care about me or others in your choice. Ask yourself where you would like best to live,—here with me, or with <b>Christophine,</b> or in our native country with Luise. Whithersoever your choice falls, there will we provide the means. For the present, of course, in the circumstances given, you would remain in Würtemberg a little while; and in that time all would be arranged. I think you might pass the winter months most easily at Leonberg" [...] (pleasant Village nearest to Solitüde); [...] "and then with the Spring you would come with Luise to Meiningen; where, however, I would expressly advise that you had a household of your own. But of all this, more next time. I would insist upon your coming here to me, if I did not fear things would be too foreign and too unquiet for you. But were you once in Meiningen, we will find means enough to see each other, and to bring your dear Grandchildren to you. It were a great comfort, dearest Mother, at least to know you, for the first three or four weeks after Christophine's departure, among people of your acquaintance; as the sole company of our Luise would too much remind you of times that are gone. But should there be no Pension granted by the Duke, and the Sale of Furniture, &c. did not detain you too long, you might perhaps travel with both the Sisters to Meiningen; and there compose yourself in the new world so much the sooner. All that you need for a convenient life must and shall be yours, dear Mother. It shall be henceforth my care that no anxiety on that head be left you. After so many sorrows, the evening of your life must be rendered cheerful, or at least peaceful; and I hope you will still, in the bosom of your Children and Grandchildren, enjoy many a good day." [...] In conclusion, he bids her send him everything of Letters and MSS. which his dear Father left; hereby to fulfil his last wish; which also shall have its uses to his dear Mother.|$|E
