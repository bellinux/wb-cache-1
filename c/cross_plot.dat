Method discussed in this paper, consists of three stages, including: Direct modeling, Inverse modeling and <b>Cross</b> <b>plot</b> interpretation. By direct modeling we can clarify lithology or fluid dependent attributes. Analysis performed using both P-P and P-Sv attributes. Inverse modeling deals with real data and is fed {{by the results of}} direct modeling to identify the light hydrocarbon (gas) zones. The main role of <b>cross</b> <b>plot</b> interpretation is to confirm the inverse modeling results and consequently increasing validity of performed analysis. Using Hodogram – <b>cross</b> <b>plot,</b> makes possible to identify hydrocarbon zone even in small scales. This methodology was applied in Gorgan Plain Southeast Caspian, northern Iran.

This changes color, hardness, electric, magnetic and radioactive properties of minerals. This alteration product occurs at the surface coincide with the original product of seepage, namely gas emanation, crude oil and brine water effluent resulting change in fertilities rank soils and vegetation manifest which indicated with vegetation stress and bare development. This leads to change refection, absorption accompany with change in albedo, change in surface thermodynamic and emission properties accompany with change in land surface temperature (LST). District of Miri, Serawak state of Malaysia is used for study area. This area is an urban area, located in the tropical region with the complex land cover system around the city. It is potentially having some hydrocarbon seepage due to existing petroleum system. Topographic map of Miri was used to make boundary of internal and external seepage potential area, and LANDSAT ETM+ was used to derivate of albedo and day time land surface temperature. The objective of study is to detect hydrocarbon seepage in onshore area through the investigation of land use / cover anomaly on surface albedo and land surface temperature. Intensive land use / cover classification and corresponding comparison of statistical analysis were performed on albedo, land surface temperature between internal and external seepage potential area. Two dimensional <b>cross</b> <b>plots</b> was also applied to obtain the probable location of seepage. The result clearly shows {{that the presence of}} hydrocarbon shifted albedo and LST.

The lithological contents of this rock unit were analyzed using the <b>cross</b> <b>plots</b> of petrophysical parameters including shale volume, porosity and hydrocarbon saturation. The neutron /density cross-plots, M-N and RHOMAA–DTMAA and litho-saturation <b>cross</b> <b>plots</b> of the studied wells show that the main lithology of {{the lower part of}} Abu Madi Formation is calcareous sandstones with shale intercalations in most of the studied wells while its lithology is mainly shale with sand intercalations in wells AM- 13, AM- 21 and AM- 7. The lithology of the upper part of Abu Madi Formation in most wells is composed mainly of shale while its lithology in AM- 13, AM- 21 and AM- 7 wells is composed of sandstone with shale intercalations. The thorium-potassium <b>cross</b> <b>plots</b> indicate that, Abu Madi Formation was deposited mostly in fluvial to shallow marine environments according to the presence of mica and illite in the southern area and montmorillonite at the northern area as dominant clay minerals.

30|$|During the {{prediction}} process, {{the square of}} the quality factor, Q 2, was used to predict the deep induction log (ILD). The choice of Q 2 is based on the following explanation. Because {{the prediction}} algorithm makes use of the linear relationship between log property and attributes, if the <b>cross</b> <b>plot</b> shows nonlinearity, the algorithm tests for linear relationships using nonlinear transforms. For example, if the <b>cross</b> <b>plot</b> between a target log and an attribute resembles a curve, the algorithm will test different nonlinear transforms such as log, square, square root, etc., to see whether a linear relationship is created by any of the transforms. From these tests, the transform that creates the best linear relationship is chosen. In our case, Q 2 was found to provide the best linear relationship between ILD and Q (Fig.  12 c), suggesting that the relationship between ILD and Q is nonlinear. We therefore used Q 2 in the prediction process instead of Q. The interval having the highest resistivity (i.e., highest Q values) is the upper Eagle Ford (Fig.  12).|$|E

30|$|This step is {{essential}} for validating the produced modeling. The procedure is that before doing modeling we remove two or three random wells and then a new model is produced with the remaining upscaled wells. After the model is produced, we compare estimated and simulated data in the location of missing wells with the real data from upscaled well logs in a <b>cross</b> <b>plot.</b> The more the closer points into the line (Fig.  31 a–d) the more valid the model we have made. For achieving the above task, we randomly remove three wells namely well number: 3, 23, and 36. After that, we generate model based on both approaches (SGS and kriging) and then compare the result of models in exact location of missing wells with original well data. The results of comparison are presented in a <b>cross</b> <b>plot</b> shown in Fig.  31 a–d. Both kriging and SGS models show relatively good compatibility with original data. Generally the closer the dots to the line the higher the degree of compatibility of data and then consequently the more valid the modeling generated.
