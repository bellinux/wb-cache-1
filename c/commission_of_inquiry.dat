40|$|<b>Commissions</b> <b>of</b> <b>inquiry</b> are a {{vital and}} {{ubiquitous}} {{part of the}} Canadian policy landscape. Established to answer the tough questions, they {{have been charged with}} examining almost every aspect of public life. This collection brings together leading Canadian scholars working in political science, public policy, and law to explore fundamental questions about the relationship between <b>commissions</b> <b>of</b> <b>inquiry</b> and public policy for the first time: What role do commissions play in policy change? Would policy change have happened without them? Why do some commissions result in policy changes while others do not? In search <b>of</b> answers, <b>Commissions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Inquiry</b> and Policy Change analyses ten landmark inquiries ranging across a variety of political, economic, social, cultural, environmental, and legal issues. Filling a significant gap in the literature, this volume will be a valuable resource for scholars and students of Canadian political science, public policy, law, and history, as well as a broader audience of readers interested in <b>commissions</b> <b>of</b> <b>inquiry</b> and their role in Canadian policymaking...|$|R
5|$|Mary {{apparently}} expected Elizabeth to {{help her}} regain her throne. Elizabeth was cautious, ordering an inquiry into {{the conduct of the}} confederate lords and the question of whether Mary was guilty of Darnley's murder. In mid-July 1568, English authorities moved Mary to Bolton Castle, because it was further from the Scottish border but not too close to London. A <b>commission</b> <b>of</b> <b>inquiry,</b> or conference as it was known, was held in York and later Westminster between October 1568 and January 1569. In Scotland, her supporters fought a civil war against Regent Moray and his successors.|$|E

Amnesty International concluded that an appeal session on 6 September had heard no evidence to support charges.

5|$|Shepstone {{arrived in}} Pretoria in January 1877. He {{outlined}} criticisms expressed by Carnarvon regarding the Transvaal government and {{expressed support for}} federation. After a joint <b>commission</b> <b>of</b> <b>inquiry</b> on the British grievances—Kruger and the State Attorney EJP Jorissen refuted most of Carnarvon's allegations, {{one of which was}} that Pretoria tolerated slavery—Shepstone stayed in the capital, openly telling Burgers he had come to the Transvaal to annex it. Hoping to stop the annexation by reforming the government, Burgers introduced scores of bills and revisions to a bewildered volksraad, which opposed them all but then passed them, heightening the general mood of discord and confusion. One of these reforms appointed Kruger to the new post of Vice-President.|$|E
5|$|As an anointed queen, Mary {{refused to}} {{acknowledge}} the power of any court to try her and refused to attend the inquiry at York personally (she sent representatives), but Elizabeth forbade her attendance anyway. As evidence against Mary, Moray presented the so-called casket letters—eight unsigned letters purportedly from Mary to Bothwell, two marriage contracts, and a love sonnet or sonnets {{said to have been}} found in a silver-gilt casket just less than one foot (30cm) long, decorated with the monogram of King Francis II. Mary denied writing them, arguing that her handwriting was not difficult to imitate, and insisted they were forgeries. They are widely believed to be crucial as to whether Mary shares the guilt for Darnley's murder. The chair of the <b>commission</b> <b>of</b> <b>inquiry,</b> the Duke of Norfolk, described them as horrible letters and diverse fond ballads, and sent copies to Elizabeth, saying that if they were genuine they might prove Mary's guilt.|$|E
5|$|Some {{of the key}} {{principles}} {{associated with}} the thin conception {{of the rule of}} law include judicial independence, natural justice, the availability of judicial review, and the accessibility of justice. Judicial independence in Singapore is safeguarded by various constitutional provisions and legal rules, though some commentators have highlighted certain events as suggesting a lack of judicial independence. One incident in the 1980s involving the transfer of the Senior District Judge to the Attorney-General's Chambers following a decision he made which was favourable to an opposition politician was investigated by a <b>commission</b> <b>of</b> <b>inquiry</b> and found not to be due to executive interference. In Singapore, natural justice is generally regarded as a procedural rather than a substantive concept. The process of judicial review involves the review of executive actions for compliance with administrative law rules, and of executive and legislative acts for unconstitutionality in light of the doctrine of constitutional supremacy. The state of the courts and legal processes in Singapore are largely seen as making justice accessible for the citizenry.|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{examines}} domestic <b>commissions</b> <b>of</b> <b>inquiry</b> {{and offers}} a critique of their intersection with international law. There is almost no literature devoted to this subject. Scholars certainly have engaged with ‘domestic <b>commissions</b> <b>of</b> inquiry’, but this has tended to be in relation to particular commissions created within a single state (rather than domestic commissions tout court) and {{has focused on the}} suitability of commission’s procedural mechanisms and/or questions of accountability. This chapter takes a broader perspective on the societal role <b>of</b> domestic <b>commissions</b> and their relationship with international legal norms. It argues that the engagement by domestic <b>commissions</b> <b>of</b> <b>inquiry</b> with international law is hugely dependant on the relevant social context, which generates consequent implications for the normative authority <b>of</b> those <b>inquiries.</b> The intersection <b>of</b> domestic <b>commissions</b> <b>of</b> <b>inquiry</b> and international law thus must be viewed through the prism of political and social choice...|$|R
40|$|In {{the latest}} twenty {{years we have}} {{witnessed}} an exponential proliferation <b>of</b> international <b>commissions</b> <b>of</b> <b>inquiry</b> mandated to investigate serious violations of international law. However, the inquiry tool has been originally institutionalised {{at the beginning of}} the 20 th century as mean of preventive diplomacy aimed at stating the facts for dispute settlement purposes. Since then inquiries have significantly evolved into mechanisms that denounce and shed light on serious violations of international law in order to provoke a response by the international community. What are the underlying causes of this new role and of the recent surge <b>of</b> <b>inquiry</b> <b>commissions?</b> Should <b>commissions</b> <b>of</b> <b>inquiry</b> be viewed as merely fact-finders or as law-applicable/adjudication bodies? Should their tasks be confined to finding the facts or may they perform more dynamic and political roles such as raising alert and provoking reactions? What (arguably) should be the role <b>of</b> <b>commissions</b> <b>of</b> <b>inquiry</b> in the criminal accountability process? These and other questions are the core of this academic contribution which, through a comprehensive analysis of the work and practice <b>of</b> <b>commissions</b> <b>of</b> <b>inquiry,</b> aims to shed more light on a topic that has increasingly become the focus of intense debate among academics, practitioners and international decision-makers...|$|R

5|$|The Black Death hit Canterbury in 1348. At 10,000, Canterbury had the 10th largest {{population}} in England; {{by the early}} 16th century, the population had fallen to 3,000. In 1363, during the Hundred Years' War, a <b>Commission</b> <b>of</b> <b>Inquiry</b> found that disrepair, stone-robbing and ditch-filling had led to the Roman wall becoming eroded. Between 1378 and 1402, the wall was virtually rebuilt, and new wall towers were added. In 1381, during Wat Tyler's Peasants' Revolt, the castle and Archbishop's Palace were sacked, and Archbishop Sudbury was beheaded in London. Sudbury is still remembered annually by the Christmas mayoral procession to his tomb at Canterbury Cathedral. In 1413 Henry IV became the only sovereign to be buried at the cathedral. In 1448 Canterbury was granted a City Charter, which gave it a mayor and a high sheriff; the city still has a Lord Mayor and Sheriff. In 1504 the cathedral's main tower, the Bell Harry Tower, was completed, ending 400years of building.|$|E
5|$|The {{port city}} of Memel (now Klaipėda) and the {{surrounding}} area, with a predominantly German population, was under provisional Allied control according to Article 99 of the Treaty of Versailles. The French and Polish governments favoured turning Memel into an international city, while Lithuania wanted to annex the area. By 1923, {{the fate of the}} area had still not been decided, prompting Lithuanian forces to invade in January 1923 and seize the port. After the Allies failed to reach an agreement with Lithuania, they referred the matter to the League of Nations. In December 1923, the League Council appointed a <b>Commission</b> <b>of</b> <b>Inquiry.</b> The commission chose to cede Memel to Lithuania and give the area autonomous rights. The Klaipėda Convention was approved by the League Council on 14 March 1924, and then by the Allied powers and Lithuania. In 1939 Germany retook the region following the rise of the Nazis and an ultimatum to Lithuania, demanding the return of the region under threat of war. The League of Nations failed to prevent the secession of the Memel region to Germany.|$|E
5|$|Judges of the Subordinate Courts do {{not enjoy}} the {{security}} of tenure enjoyed by the Supreme Court judges. As officers of the Singapore Legal Service, {{it is said that}} there is a risk of executive interference because judges may be removed from their judicial positions or transferred to lower-ranking positions elsewhere within the Legal Service by the Legal Service Commission (LSC). In 1984, the Senior District Judge Michael Khoo acquitted Opposition Member of Parliament J.B. Jeyaratnam of all but one minor charge in a case involving cheques for the Workers' Party of Singapore which had allegedly been fraudulently handled. The acquittal was overturned on appeal to the High Court, and a retrial ordered. However, before the retrial took place, Khoo was transferred from his position on the Bench to the Attorney-General's Chambers to take up the post of deputy public prosecutor. This was considered to be a demotion. In 1986, Jeyaratnam claimed in Parliament that the transfer had been made because Khoo had ruled in his favour in the 1984 case. However, a <b>commission</b> <b>of</b> <b>inquiry</b> formed to look into the circumstances surrounding the transfer found no evidence of this. For making the allegation, Jeyaratnam was referred to Parliament's Committee of Privileges for abusing parliamentary privilege. While the Committee was considering the matter, Jeyaretnam wrote five newsletters about the Committee's proceedings and sent them to residents of his constituency. On 9 October 1986, the Leader of the House made a written complaint regarding the newsletters' contents to the Speaker of Parliament, which the Committee also considered. On 27 January 1987 Parliament accepted the Committee's reports on the complaints and found Jeyaretnam guilty of abusing the privileges of Parliament by alleging executive interference in the judiciary, and of contempt of the Committee and Parliament by publishing the newsletters. Fines totalling S$26,000 were imposed.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the role of}} Nigerian women in peace building processes in the country from the colonial era to date; using library research and interview methods. The paper argues that despite economic, political, religious and cultural restrictions, Nigerian women have contributed significantly to peace building in the country. However, their contributions have not been recognized and encouraged by both {{federal and state governments}} as women are poorly represented at all levels of decision-making, especially in post-conflict resolution <b>commissions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Inquiries.</b> The near absence of women from these <b>commissions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Inquiry</b> missed out on the contributions of women, which are different from those of men. Women are central to conflict resolution in its entirety. This explains why the United Nations insist that member nations should involve women in all processes of peace. With the present consciousness of women’s involvement in post-conflict resolution, the paper concludes by urging federal and state governments to adopt equitable gender representation in future <b>commissions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Inquiry...</b>|$|R
5|$|The League {{resolved}} {{a dispute}} between the Kingdom of Iraq and the Republic of Turkey {{over control of the}} former Ottoman province of Mosul in 1926. According to the British, who had been awarded a League of Nations mandate over Iraq in 1920 and therefore represented Iraq in its foreign affairs, Mosul belonged to Iraq; on the other hand, the new Turkish republic claimed the province as part of its historic heartland. A League of Nations <b>Commission</b> <b>of</b> <b>Inquiry,</b> with Belgian, Hungarian and Swedish members, was sent to the region in 1924; it found that the people of Mosul {{did not want to be}} part of either Turkey or Iraq, but if they had to choose, they would pick Iraq. In 1925, the commission recommended that the region stay part of Iraq, under the condition that the British hold the mandate over Iraq for another 25 years, to ensure the autonomous rights of the Kurdish population. The League Council adopted the recommendation and decided on 16 December 1925 to award Mosul to Iraq. Although Turkey had accepted League of Nations' arbitration in the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923, it rejected the decision, questioning the Council's authority. The matter was referred to the Permanent Court of International Justice, which ruled that, when the Council made a unanimous decision, it must be accepted. Nonetheless, Britain, Iraq and Turkey ratified a separate treaty on 5 June 1926 that mostly followed the decision of the League Council and also assigned Mosul to Iraq. It was agreed that Iraq could still apply for League membership within 25 years and that the mandate would end upon its admittance.|$|E
