5|$|Always {{in touch}} with its Nazi past, HIAG was a subject of {{significant}} controversy, both in West Germany and abroad. The organisation drifted into right-wing extremism in its later history; it was disbanded in 1992 at the federal level, but local groups, along with the organisation's monthly periodical, <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>exist</b> into the 21st century.|$|E
5|$|Plays, musicals, monologues, pantomimes, and {{performance}} poetry {{are part of}} the very long history of theatre, which is also the venue for the type of performance known as stand-up comedy. In the 20th century, radio and television, often broadcast live, extended the theatrical tradition that <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>exist</b> alongside the new forms.|$|E
5|$|Sexist attitudes still prevailed across Soviet society. Men in the {{leadership}} often did not take women or their ideas seriously, and excluded them from many discussions. Domestic violence and sexual harassment <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>exist.</b> Yet, sociological studies at the time found that Soviet women tended not to see their inequality as a problem.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-16thcentury Henry VIII of England {{dissolved}} the monasteries, {{resulting in}} the large areas of land owned by Meaux Abbey, Bridlington Priory and other monastic holdings being confiscated. The Crown subsequently sold these large tracts of land into private ownership. Along with the land already belonging to lay owners, they formed some of the vast estate holdings which <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>exist</b> in the Riding until the 20thcentury.|$|E
5|$|The borough {{was not one}} {{of those}} {{reformed}} by the Municipal Corporations Act of 1835, and <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>exist</b> {{under the control of the}} Lord of the Manor and the Court Leet until its final abolition in 1886. The Public Health Act of 1848 led to the creation of Altrincham's Local Board of Health in 1851 to address the unsanitary conditions created by the town's growing population– the first such board in Trafford.|$|E
5|$|The kingdom <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>exist.</b> Batu Khan {{withdrew his}} entire army {{when he was}} {{informed}} {{of the death of}} the Great Khan Ögödei in March 1242. Nevertheless, the invasion and the famine that followed it had catastrophic demographic consequences. At least 15percent of the population died or disappeared. Transcontinental trading routes disintegrated, causing the decline of Bács (Bač, Serbia), Ungvár (Uzhhorod, Ukraine) and other traditional centers of commerce. Local Muslim communities also disappeared, indicating they had suffered especially heavy losses during the invasion.|$|E

5|$|The last Einsatzgruppen were disbanded in mid-1944 (although some <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>exist</b> {{on paper}} until 1945) {{due to the}} German retreat on both fronts and the {{consequent}} inability to continue extermination activities. Former Einsatzgruppen members were either assigned duties in the Waffen-SS or concentration camps. Twenty-four Einsatzgruppen commanders were tried for war crimes following the war.|$|E
5|$|The {{remains of}} the Byzantine-era church in Jifna testifies to the {{existence}} of a Christian community prior to the Muslim conquest. It <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>exist</b> during the Middle Ages and the village is still inhabited mainly by Christians. The names of Christian inhabitants from Jifna appeared in a 10th-century inscription on a stone above the gate of St. George's Monastery in the Wadi Qelt.|$|E
5|$|Writing around 1200, Niketas Choniates equated {{the office}} with the Western marshal, and {{it appears to have}} been used interchangeably with the latter title in the Latin Empire and the other Latin states formed after the Fourth Crusade. The office <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>exist</b> during the Palaiologan period until the Fall of Constantinople in 1453. It {{remained}} one of the highest dignities of state, ranking eighth overall in the hierarchy, although from the late 13th century on, multiple persons could hold it.|$|E
40|$|We {{review the}} history of the {{philosophy}} of fondue since Aristotle so as to arrive at the formulation of the paradox of Swiss fondue. Either the wine and the cheese cease <b>to</b> <b>exist</b> (Buridan), but then the fondue is not really a mixture of wine and cheese. Or the wine and the cheese <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>exist.</b> If they do, then either they <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>exist</b> in different places (the chemists), but then a fondue can never be perfectly homogenous (it is a French fondue). Or the wine and the cheese <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>exist</b> in the same place (the Stoïcs), but then wine and cheese have to be, oddly, penetrable and spatially expansible. Aristote attempted to solve this paradox by arguing that the cheese and wine <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>exist,</b> but only potentially in the fondue. We sketch an alternative answer. The wine and the cheese <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>exist,</b> but only non-spatially in the fondue. Wine and cheese, once mixed, become non-spatial constituents of the fondue, a bit like character traits are non-spatial constituents of persons. The wine and the cheese are in the fondue, but only the fondue is there in the fondue pot...|$|R

5|$|Henry's plans shifted {{when the}} Empress Matilda's husband, the Emperor Henry, died in 1125. King Henry {{recalled}} {{his daughter to}} England {{the next year and}} declared that, should he die without a male heir, she was to be his rightful successor. The Anglo-Norman barons were gathered together at Westminster on Christmas 1126, where they swore to recognise Matilda and any future legitimate heir she might have. Putting forward a woman as a potential heir in this way was unusual: opposition to Matilda <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>exist</b> within the English court, and Louis was vehemently opposed to her candidacy.|$|E
5|$|Madame Schmidt did {{not talk}} about the matter even after the war. She died in 1954 at the age of 71 without {{revealing}} the identity of any of her former employees. Total number of Gestapo recordings from the brothel was estimated by the Stasi (East German Security Service) to be about 25,000. Virtually all of the recordings have since been lost or destroyed due to their post-war unimportance. According to a 2005 article in Die Tageszeitung, the brothel <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>exist</b> after World War II under the management of Schmidt's son and daughter. In the 1990s, it was turned into a home for asylum-seekers, which was closed soon after because of local protest against the residents.|$|E
5|$|The Kingdom of Scotland {{emerged as}} an {{independent}} sovereign state in the Early Middle Ages and <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>exist</b> until 1707. By inheritance in 1603, James VI, King of Scots, became King of England and King of Ireland, thus forming a personal union of the three kingdoms. Scotland subsequently entered into a political union with the Kingdom of England on 1 May 1707 to create the new Kingdom of Great Britain. The union also created a new Parliament of Great Britain, which succeeded both the Parliament of Scotland and the Parliament of England. In 1801, Great Britain itself entered into a political union with the Kingdom of Ireland to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.|$|E

5|$|The {{territorial}} government {{under the leadership}} of Premier Frederick Haultain struck a deal with the federal Government of Canada in early 1905 to bring provincial powers to the territories. This {{led to the creation of}} the provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta from the southernmost and most populous areas of the territory. The Northwest Territories, reduced to its northern, lightly populated hinterland, <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>exist</b> under the 1870s constitutional status under control of the federal government. A new council was convened in Ottawa, Ontario to deal with the region.|$|E
5|$|After 1066, William did {{not attempt}} to {{integrate}} his separate domains into one unified realm with one set of laws. His seal from after 1066, of which six impressions still survive, was made for him after he conquered England and stressed his role as king, while separately mentioning his role as Duke. When in Normandy, William acknowledged that he owed fealty to the French king, but in England no such acknowledgement was made– further evidence that the various parts of William's lands were considered separate. The administrative machinery of Normandy, England, and Maine <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>exist</b> separate from the other lands, with each one retaining its own forms. For example, England continued the use of writs, which were not known on the continent. Also, the charters and documents produced for the government in Normandy differed in formulas from those produced in England.|$|E
5|$|Bruce paid two further {{visits to}} Spitsbergen, in 1912 and 1914, but the {{outbreak}} of war prevented further immediate developments. However, early in 1919 the old syndicate {{was replaced by a}} larger and better-financed company. Bruce had now fixed his main hopes on the discovery of oil, but scientific expeditions in 1919 and 1920 failed to provide evidence of its presence, although substantial new deposits of coal and iron ore were discovered. Thereafter Bruce was too ill to continue with his involvement. The new company had expended most of its capital on these prospecting ventures, and although it <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>exist,</b> under various ownerships, until 1952, there is no record of profitable extraction. Its assets and claims were finally acquired by a rival concern.|$|E

5|$|Civil parishes {{in their}} modern sense {{date from the}} Local Government Act 1894, which {{abolished}} vestries; established elected parish councils in all rural parishes with more than 300 electors; grouped rural parishes into Rural Districts; and aligned parish boundaries with county and borough boundaries. Urban civil parishes <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>exist,</b> and were generally coterminous with the Urban District, Municipal Borough or County Borough {{in which they were}} situated; many large towns contained a number of parishes, and these were usually merged into one. Parish councils were not formed in urban areas, and the only function of the parish was to elect guardians to Poor Law Unions; with the abolition of the Poor Law system in 1930 the parishes had only a nominal existence. The Local Government Act 1972 retained civil parishes in rural areas, and many former Urban Districts and Municipal Boroughs that were being abolished, were replaced by new successor parishes; urban areas that were considered too large to be single parishes became unparished areas.|$|E
5|$|Gaelic <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>exist</b> as a spoken {{language}} in the southern Hebrides throughout the Norse settlement period, but place-name evidence suggests it had a lowly status. The obliteration of pre-Norse names is almost total. There is little continuity of style between Pictish pottery {{in the north and}} that of the early Viking period. The similarities that do exist suggests the later pots may have been made by Norse who had settled in Ireland, or by Irish slaves. In the Firth of Clyde, Norse burials have been found on Arran, although not on Bute, and place-name evidence suggests a settlement pattern that was much less well-developed than in the Hebrides. There are numerous Manx Runestones and place names of Norse origin on the Isle of Man.|$|E
5|$|In 1956, Robert Carl Suggs, {{with the}} American Museum of Natural History, led the first stratigraphical {{excavation}} {{of the islands}} and uncovered many dog bone fragments and one dog burial across a few sites {{on the island of}} Nuku Hiva. Between 1964 and 1965, American archaeologist Yosihiko H. Sinoto, with the Bishop Museum, discovered a drilled dog canine used as a pendant, one pre-molar and two dog burials in the sand dunes at Hane on the island of Ua Huka. In 1998, American archaeologist Barry Vladimir Rolett discovered dog bones in all levels of settlement at Hanamiai, on the island of Tahuata, indicating that the breed may have <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>exist</b> on this island until the mid-19th century. Some of these bones had visible cut marks. In 2000, French archaeologist Pascal Sellier discovered three dog skeletons alongside several human burials at Manihina, Ua Huka; one dog was buried in a coffin.|$|E
