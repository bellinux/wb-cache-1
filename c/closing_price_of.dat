25|$|In January 2014, it was {{announced}} that Jim Beam would be purchased by Suntory Holdings Ltd., a Japanese group of brewers & distillers known for producing Japan's first whiskey. Suntory agreed to acquire Jim Beam, Maker's Mark, Teacher's Highland Cream and Laphroaig distillery Scotch whiskies for approximately $13.62 billion and also take on Beam's debt. This deal is the biggest Suntory has ever agreed to and will elevate them to the third largest maker of distilled drinks in the world. The combined company is expected to have annual sales of spirits products of more than $4.3 billion. Suntory will pay $83.50 per share, a 25 percent premium to Beam's Friday <b>closing</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> $66.97. The companies put the deal's value at about $16 billion, including debt. According to press releases regarding the deal, the Illinois-based Jim Beam will continue to be managed by its current leadership. Beam and Suntory unanimously approved the transaction; however, the deal needs to be approved by Beam Inc. stockholders. Pending approval by its shareholders, the deal was expected to close by June 30, 2014. Jim Beam and Suntory have a previous partnership where they would freely distribute each other's brands in different markets.|$|E

30|$|To provide {{improved}} prediction <b>of</b> the <b>closing</b> <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> {{stock market}} indices, this paper proposed a novel GA-weighted condensed polynomial neural network (CPNN-GA) model. This model generates PDs {{for the first}} and second layers of degree two and four, respectively. A generic algorithm is utilized to select the optimal synaptic weight set and biases of the model. These weight and bias values, along with the input features, are fed to the output neuron. The prediction performance of the proposed model was compared experimentally to the performance of a CPNN-GD, MLP-GD, MLP-GA, and RBFNN model, all of which have been employed for forecasting next days’ <b>closing</b> <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> a real stock market. Data for five major fast-growing stock market indices were considered for this work. The experimental results and statistical significance tests proved the superiority of the proposed model over the others, demonstrating that the proposed CPNN-GA model can be considered an efficient and promising forecasting model for the stock market.|$|R
