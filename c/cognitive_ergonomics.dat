This study compared a paper-based language test and a computer-based language test—the Test of English Proficiency developed at Seoul National University. The findings based on content analysis using corpus linguistic techniques showed that both versions of the test are comparable. Along similar lines, another study that investigated the comparability of conventional and computerized tests of reading in a second language was Sawaki (2001). This study provided a comprehensive review of literature regarding <b>cognitive</b> ability, <b>ergonomics,</b> education, psychology, and L 1 reading. The study did not draw clear conclusions and generalizations about computerized language assessments due to the range of characteristics such as administrative conditions, computer requirements, test completion time, and test takers’ affect.

40|$|Sustainable Manufacturing (SM) {{traditionally}} {{focused on}} optimization {{of environmental and}} economic aspects, by neglecting the human performance. However, the industrial plant's costs, productivity and process quality highly depend on the individual human performance (e. g., comfort perceived, physical and mental workload, simplicity of actions, personal satisfaction) and how much hazardous positions and uncomfortable tasks finally cost to the company. The present paper defines a human-centred virtual simulation environment to optimize physical ergonomics in workstation design and demonstrates its benefits on an industrial case study in pipe industry. The proposed environment aims at overcoming traditional approaches, where analysis are carried out at the shop-floor when the plant is already created, by providing a virtual environment to easily test and verify different design solutions to optimize physical, <b>cognitive</b> and organizational <b>ergonomics...</b>|$|R

40|$|Resistance as a {{state or}} {{activity}} entwines discrete entities or forces in a given context (contexere, to weave together). Something or someone resists something or someone, making this with-standing (re-sistere) essentially relational or agential. Live performance gives this play of agency a dramatic frame and focus, involving resources ranging from "raw" re-appropriated materials to sophisticated information technology type artefacts. These resources support interactions of human and non-human agency, and mix physical and virtual materials which generate different kinds of resistance and behavioural response. This paper looks at different contextual framings of resistance that arise in live performance, using generic instrumental and gestural taxonomies from <b>cognitive</b> science and <b>ergonomics</b> to set notions of "resistant materials" in a broader transdisciplinary perspective. Emphasis is on the kinds of context sensitivity at work when materials are creatively (re-) appropriated, the role of art being to resist and scramble classificatory systems governing conventional notions of agency...|$|R

After presenting the data collecting method, we will con-sider the analysis of the resulting data concerning the writing of two movements of Voi(rex). Such an analysis will allow us: (1) to draw methodological conclusions about the time and mode of inquiry; (2) to specify the notion of situated cognition in situations essentially pre-established by the actor; (3) to set out two families of theoretical results relating to large temporal span cognitive phenomena: the first concerns the notion of an idea and its {{role in the development of}} the creative process; the second deals with the notion of the appropriation of tools and the making of situated individual cognition...|$|R

The book also addresses and considers an impressive suite of more generic and fundamental metaphysical, epistemological, and phenomenological issues relating to sense making, the locus of meaning, perceptions versus cognitions, <b>cognitive</b> science and <b>ergonomics,</b> the role and relative importance of representation in human perception, and the dualisms of the mental and physical, the person and the environment, the perceiver and the perceived...|$|R
