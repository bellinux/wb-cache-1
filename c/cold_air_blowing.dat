5000|$|A local weather {{phenomenon}} that occurs mainly {{in late summer}} is colloquially known as [...] "Morgan's Cloud". On otherwise fair, hot summer days with light southwesterly winds, convective clouds can develop {{along the length of}} the island and blow to the northeast growing. In extreme cases, this cloud formation can develop into heavy showers and thunderstorms and it has been known to produce funnel clouds and waterspouts in the eastern parishes. This phenomenon also occurs in the less common northeasterly wind regime ("reverse" [...] Morgan's Cloud) but its effects are felt in the western parishes. The key to Morgan's Cloud forming is light winds blowing {{along the length of the}} island which is often warmer than the surrounding waters on hot summer days. This organizes upward motions allowing this cloud formation to occur. Similar localized cloud development is observed in linear tropical and subtropical islands globally. Furthermore, showers following strong cold fronts in wintertime form in a similar manner to lake-effect snow. <b>Cold</b> <b>air</b> <b>blowing</b> over warm water decreases atmospheric stability, allowing convection to form and grow into showers.|$|E

5000|$|The Pierson Limestone was {{deposited}} {{during the}} Mississippian. Later in the Paleozoic the Ozark Uplift brought the rock above sea level, allowing fresh water to begin dissolving away the limestone {{to form the}} cave. Further uplift brought the cave above the water table and allowed abundant speleothems to form. The cave was accessed during Archaic times by Native Americans. At some point after the Archaic and before modern times the cave was sealed off by collapse. In 1925 Arthur Browning was exploring his land, checking traps, and discovered a small hole with <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> <b>blowing</b> out along a bluff. He soon {{enlisted the help of}} two surveyors employed by the highway department, Bob Ford and Bryan Gilmore, to excavate the rocks and debris blocking the entrance. During excavation, substantial artifacts were discovered, including arrowheads, grinding stones, tools made of bone and skeletal remains of the early native American inhabitants, that date back to as early as 5000 B.C. Arthur opened the cave to the public for tours in 1927. It is still owned and operated by the same family today, currently the 3rd generation, after 90 years of being open.|$|E
50|$|Western New York has a humid {{continental}} climate {{heavily influenced by}} both Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. Winters are long and cold, often lasting from around mid-November to early April. There are often snows before and after that period, as well. Western New York {{is known for its}} lake effect snows, which can result in highly localized, sometimes intense and even historic snow events. Lake effect storms are a result of <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> <b>blowing</b> over warm lake waters. Lake effect snows are usually most active between November and February and typically diminish when Lake Erie freezes over. Generally, the heaviest amount of snow in Western New York during the winter falls near the southern end of Erie County. Spring and fall in Western New York are usually short and changeable. The presence of the lakes allows for fruit growing and wine production along areas adjacent to both lakes which retard the development of damaging spring and fall frost, thereby extending the growing season. Lost in its famed winters, Western New York summers are among the sunniest in the Northeast and are generally very pleasant. Thanks in part to breezes blowing over Lakes Erie and Ontario (which are usually cooler than the air temperature in the summer), most of Western New York enjoy generally cooler and more comfortable summers than other regions in the same climatic zone.|$|E
40|$|What is the "New Jazz Studies?" Uptown Conversations and The Other Side of Nowhere {{contain a}} {{diverse array of}} {{scholarship}} that approaches the broad fields of jazz studies and musical improvisation through various perspectives and methodologies. Krin Gabbard's two volume collection, Representing Jazz and Jazz Among the Discourses, is the clear precedent for these new anthologies. Uptown Conversations and The Other Side of Nowhere continue this trajectory by moving away from jazz as a static object to be stylistically described, explained, and celebrated through the heroic and larger-than-life individual towards an understanding of jazz as a music in continual dialogue with the historical, social, political, racial, and gendered processes governing its creation. Ultimately, there are multiple ways of thinking and writing about music. However, both of these texts ignite important and much-needed debates {{over the future of}} this decidedly interdisciplinary field. Gabbard's aggressive programmatic statement from Jazz Among the Discourses still holds true for these two volumes: "jazz scholarship now faces two significant choices: it may continue developing and protecting its canon, or it may take the consequences of letting in some fresh, if chilling, air.

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{investigations of}} the performance of vertical refrigerated display cabinets. Such cabinets are in widespread use and account for a considerable proportion of the energy used in shops. The open front is important for the shop-owner, who wants the chilled items in the cabinet to be well exposed and easily accessible. The purpose of the work has been to analyse the energy flows in display cabinets and subsequently analysing the possibilities to reducing the cabinets' energy requirements while retaining or improving their performance. The work has involved controlled investigations in a climate chamber in order to determine how the ambient climatic conditions and other factors affect energy use. The results show that the energy requirement of a display cabinet is linearly proportional to the difference in specific enthalpy between that of the ambient air and that of the <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> in the cabinet. This means that the cooling power requirement for any arbitrary climate can be determined from measurements of the energy requirements of two different ambient climates. An analysis of energy flows shows that infiltration provides the greatest inward heat leakage in a display cabinet. Radiation and illumination also have a relatively substantial effect in comparison with other possible heat inputs, as they act on the most poorly cooled products in the cabinet. The overall energy requirement of a display cabinet is determined by the ambient climate and the temperature of the warmest item in the cabinet, which therefore in turn determines the mean temperature level in the entire cabinet. Results from experimental measurements and CFD calculations show that the performance of an open vertical display cabinet with <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> <b>blown</b> in through the back is affected by how it is loaded and by how the perforations in the back-plate are arranged. The conclusion is that <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> input through the back-plate is not the best method of cooling the foodstuff packages, as the <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> is supplied where the need for cooling is least. The air curtain is required to provide good enclosure, and also to cool the foodstuffs {{at the front of the}} shelves, all with the least input of energy. The results from the modelling show that it is not possible to achieve the same efficiency and function with air curtains having the same height/width ratio but with different heights. If the air curtain is to cool items at the front of shelves, while at the same time being stable, a shorter air curtain is more efficient than a longer air curtain for the same height/width ratio. The overall conclusion is therefore that a single long air curtain should be replaced by a number of shorter air curtains, and that a thick air curtain is more efficient than a thin air curtain...|$|R
5000|$|Early systems used rotary coolers, {{which were}} {{rotating}} cylinders {{similar to the}} kiln, into which the hot clinker dropped. [...] The combustion air was drawn up through the cooler as the clinker moved down, cascading through the air stream. In the 1920s, satellite coolers became common and remained in use until recently. These consist of a set (typically 7-9) of tubes attached to the kiln tube. They have the advantage that they are sealed to the kiln, and require no separate drive. From about 1930, the grate cooler was developed. This consists of a perforated grate through which <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> is <b>blown,</b> enclosed in a rectangular chamber. A bed of clinker up to 0.5 m deep moves along the grate. These coolers have two main advantages: they cool the clinker rapidly, which is desirable from a quality point of view (to avoid that alite, thermodynamically unstable below 1250 °C, revert to belite and free CaO on slow cooling), and, {{because they do not}} rotate, hot air can be ducted out of them for use in fuel drying, or for use as precalciner combustion air.

2500|$|The A-type was the {{original}} wing design, with eight [...]303 calibre Browning machine guns, with 300 rounds per gun (rpg). The basic structure of the wing was unchanged until the C type in 1942. The one major alteration made to this wing, soon after production started, was the incorporation of a heating system for the gun bays, to prevent the guns from freezing up at high altitudes. To achieve this, open structures, such as wing ribs, surrounding the gun-bays were closed off, forming closed bays for each gun. Ducting was added, which drew heated air from the engine radiator and transferred it into the now-closed weapon-bays. Underwing vents, covered by streamlined triangular blisters just inboard of the wingtips, extracted the air, creating a negative pressure differential, and caused more heated air to be drawn in, ensuring {{a steady supply of}} heated air without any need for a mechanical blower. To keep <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> from <b>blowing</b> in via the muzzle openings in the leading edge, they were sealed with red fabric adhesive tape by ground crew while loading the ammunition trays. The guns fired through the tape, so they were no longer sealed after combat. Towards the end of 1940, the fabric covered ailerons were replaced by ones covered in light alloy. The A-type wing was only compatible with the 8 × [...]303 Browning machine gun armament suite.|$|R

The surface of the grain silos were treated with diatom earth with a commercial assay (1. 0 kg / t of product). For the cooling of the grains, <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> was <b>blown</b> through the aeration system silos until the grains reach a temperature of 17 ° C between the layers.

In The Silo, were not detected representative quantities of insects in grain up to 120 days, when the collections were made with probes in the layer below the grain treated with diatomaceous earth. In Silo B, where the collection of insects was performed with traps of the type calador, increased population of insects of the species O. surinamensis and R. dominica with the extension of storage. This increase in the number of insects was greater after 60 days of the early experiments. This is happening due to the presence of insects in grain mass before cooling.

40|$|Previous {{work has}} shown that {{frequent}} mesoscale cyclogenesis adjacent to Franklin Island {{is linked to the}} strong and persistent katabatic winds from East Antarctica which funnel into Terra Nova Bay and then blow out over the southwestern Ross Sea. Four mesoscale cyclones that formed near Terra Nova Bay between February 16 and 20, 1988 are examined to more clearly define the governing mechanisms. These events are investigated using all available observations, including automatic weather station data, high-resolution satellite images, satellite soundings, and hemispheric synoptic analyses. The first two cyclones formed on low-level baroclinic zones established by the synoptic scale advection of warm moist <b>air</b> toward the <b>cold</b> continental <b>air</b> <b>blowing</b> gently from East Antarctica. In the second case, baroclinic instability of this small-scale cold front was apparently triggered by the enhanced upward vertical motion associated with the approach of a midtropospheric trough. The third mesocyclone formed shortly after on a baroclinic zone over the polar plateau; the second vortex completely disrupted the usual katabatic drainage over the plateau and forced warm moist air over the coastal slopes. All three cyclones moved to the north in the prevailing cyclonic flow, but the plateau vortex lasted for only 6 hours. The fourth mesoscale low formed in conjunction with an abrupt and intense surge of katabatic air from Terra Nova Bay which resharpened the coastal baroclinic zone. At the same time a transiting midtropospheric trough probably associated with lower tropospheric upward vertical motion apparently accelerated the katabatic winds and triggered the vortex formation. A similar katabatic wind-forced mesocyclone formed near Byrd Glacier. The two vortices moved to the east-southeast and northeast, respectively, apparently being steered by the generating katabatic airstreams, and merged just {{to the north of the}} Ross Ice Shelf.

40|$|Presented at the Conference Active Flow and Combustion Control 2014, September 10 - 12 2014, Berlin, GermanyThe current {{investigation}} examines {{the impact of}} a new pulsed unsteady combustion to the turbine sealing cavity, which prevents hot gas ingestion into the inner machine. Sealing flow is ensured by relatively <b>cold</b> secondary <b>air</b> <b>blowing</b> radially through the rotor-stator-wheel space. The interaction between the sealing flow and the main gas flow however causes aerodynamic losses. These losses as well as the secondary compressor air should be kept at a minimum in order to increase the efficiency of the whole machine. The Hot-Acoustic-Testrig (HAT) allows an investigation of the subject under realistic flow conditions. Therefore a specific measurement section has been designed, which features a plenum to provide secondary air to the main flow. To simulate an pressure increasing combustion, a setup with 6 fast shifting valves was realized. The unsteady flow was measured by pressure tabs with a high time resolution. In the next step a characteristic linear cascade was designed to replace the turbine stator and generate a typical stator wake. Measurements of the total pressure loss over the cascade vanes have been conducted by means of a five-hole probe and by Particle Image Velocimetry. A considerable pressure loss inside the vane wake was observed at a Mach number Ma = 0. 35.
