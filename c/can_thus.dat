5|$|In {{terms of}} the visual dimension, {{distinction}} between aggressive mimicry and camouflage is not always clear. Authors such as Wickler have emphasized {{the significance of the}} signal to its receiver as delineating mimicry from camouflage. However, {{it is not easy to}} assess how 'significant' a signal may be for the dupe, and the distinction between the two <b>can</b> <b>thus</b> be rather fuzzy. Mixed signals may also be employed. Aggressive mimics often have a specific part of the body sending a deceptive signal, with the rest being hidden or camouflaged.|$|E

The average person lived in Longyearbyen for 6.3 years, although it is 6.6 years for Norwegians and 4.3 years for foreigners. In 2009, {{about a quarter of the}} population had lived in the town since before 2000, and <b>can</b> <b>thus</b> be regarded as permanent population.

5|$|Neoclassicism or {{increasingly}} Nordic Classicism {{continued to}} thrive {{at the beginning}} of the century until about 1930 as can be seen in Kay Fisker's Hornbækhus apartment buildings (1923) and Hack Kampmann's police headquarters (1924). Its development was no isolated phenomenon, drawing on existing classical traditions in the Nordic countries, and from new ideas being pursued in German-speaking cultures. It <b>can</b> <b>thus</b> be characterised as a combination of direct and indirect influences from vernacular architecture (Nordic, Italian and German) and Neoclassicism.|$|E
5|$|The {{blackbuck}} is a diurnal antelope (active mainly {{during the}} day). Three kinds of groups, typically small, are the female, male and bachelor herds. Males often adopt lekking {{as a strategy}} to garner females for mating. While other males are not allowed into these territories, females often visit these places to forage. The male <b>can</b> <b>thus</b> attempt mating with her. Herbivores, blackbuck graze on low grasses, occasionally browsing as well. Females become sexually mature at eight months, but mate no earlier than two years. Males mature later, at one-and-a-half years. Mating takes place throughout the year. Gestation is typically six months long, after which a single calf is born. The lifespan is typically 10 to 15 years.|$|E

5|$|Below Spalding, {{there were}} no {{restrictions}} on headroom, which allowed small coasters to reach the town. The bridge at Fosdyke was a swing bridge, {{to comply with the}} provisions of the Fosdyke Bridge Act of 1870. The demise of such traffic allowed it {{to be replaced by a}} fixed bridge with headroom of , but the powers of the original act had to be rescinded, and the Port of Fosdyke Act was obtained in 1987 to allow this to happen. The redundant wharfs at Fosdyke have been developed to provide moorings for yachts and other pleasure craft. The lock at Fulney has three sets of gates, two pointing towards the sea, and a third between them which points upriver. The lock <b>can</b> <b>thus</b> only be used when the level below it is higher than the level above it, and as the tide falls, the intermediate gate closes to prevent its use.|$|E
5|$|In a DNA double helix, {{each type}} of nucleobase on one strand bonds with just one type of nucleobase on the other strand. This is called {{complementary}} base pairing. Here, purines form hydrogen bonds to pyrimidines, with adenine bonding only to thymine in two hydrogen bonds, and cytosine bonding only to guanine in three hydrogen bonds. This arrangement of two nucleotides binding together across the double helix is called a Watson-Crick base pair. Another type of base pairing is Hoogsteen base pairing where two hydrogen bonds form between guanine and cytosine. As hydrogen bonds are not covalent, they can be broken and rejoined relatively easily. The two strands of DNA in a double helix <b>can</b> <b>thus</b> be pulled apart like a zipper, either by a mechanical force or high temperature. As {{a result of this}} base pair complementarity, all the information in the double-stranded sequence of a DNA helix is duplicated on each strand, which is vital in DNA replication. This reversible and specific interaction between complementary base pairs is critical for all the functions of DNA in living organisms.|$|E
5|$|Most {{synthesis}} routines yield {{a mixture}} of different actinide isotopes as oxides, from which a certain isotope of curium needs to be separated. An example procedure could be to dissolve spent reactor fuel (e.g. MOX fuel) in nitric acid, and remove {{the bulk of the}} uranium and plutonium using a PUREX (Plutonium – URanium EXtraction) type extraction with tributyl phosphate in a hydrocarbon. The lanthanides and the remaining actinides are then separated from the aqueous residue (raffinate) by a diamide-based extraction to give, after stripping, {{a mixture of}} trivalent actinides and lanthanides. A curium compound is then selectively extracted using multi-step chromatographic and centrifugation techniques with an appropriate reagent. Bis-triazinyl bipyridine complex has been recently proposed as such reagent which is highly selective to curium. Separation of curium from a very similar americium can also be achieved by treating a slurry of their hydroxides in aqueous sodium bicarbonate with ozone at elevated temperature. Both americium and curium are present in solutions mostly in the +3 valence state; whereas americium oxidizes to soluble Am(IV) complexes, curium remains unchanged and <b>can</b> <b>thus</b> be isolated by repeated centrifugation.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{many other}} ants that use scent to forage for food, jack jumpers use their sight to target their prey. Like other bull ants, they are solitary when they forage, but only workers perform this role. These ants are omnivores and scavengers, {{typically}} foraging in warmer temperatures. They deliver painful stings, which {{are effective in}} both killing prey and deterring predators. Jack jumpers have smooth stingers, and <b>can</b> <b>thus</b> sting indefinitely. Jack jumper ants are skilled hunters, partially due to their excellent vision; they can even kill and devour wasps and bees. They also kill and eat other ants, such as carpenter ants (Camponotus) and feed on sweet floral secretions and other sugar solutions. Jack jumpers often hunt for spiders, and will sometimes follow their prey for a short distance, usually with small insects and small arthropods. Jack jumper ants, alongside M. simillima, have been given frozen houseflies (Musca domestica) and blowflies (Calliphoridae) as food under testing conditions. The ant has been observed to run and leap energetically at flies when they land, particularly on Acacia shrubs, plants or trees. Jack jumpers and other Myrmecia ants prey on insects such as cockroaches and crickets.|$|E
