2500|$|The {{third floor}} {{was used for}} final assembly, [...] "the <b>complete</b> <b>chassis</b> coming down {{to the second floor}} for the bodies." [...] The assembly, {{together}} with axle, sill, transmission and steering device assemblies and the storing of batteries occupied the fourth floor. The fifth floor was used for painting cars.|$|E
2500|$|Plant 3 at Detroit made <b>complete</b> <b>chassis</b> for Special and Big Six {{models in}} over [...] of floor space. Plant 5 was the service parts store and {{shipping}} facility, plus the executive offices of various technical departments. The Detroit facilities {{were moved to}} South Bend in 1926, except that the Piquette Avenue Plant (Plant 10) was retained for assembly of the Erskine between 1927 and 1929 and the Rockne (1931-1933).|$|E
2500|$|On most Jo-Han models, {{especially}} on friction models, chassis detail was often absent - which lowered tooling expense {{for a company}} not quite so large as AMT or the later MPC. Commonly, the chassis base was just an indented slab with the Jo-Han company name and [...] "Detroit, Michigan", but sometimes the company name was completely absent and only the GM or other car logo was present - emphasizing the real manufacturer instead of Jo-Han, the model maker. Some later contracts, however, added <b>complete</b> <b>chassis</b> detail {{as seen in the}} 1970 Ford Maverick, and the Cadillac Coupe DeVille and Eldorado promotionals from the later 1970s. On the 1965 and 1966 full sized Chrysler promos, Jo-Han outdid themselves by offering working torsion bars, but these were dropped for 1967 [...] Apart from the often plain chassis, models were exact duplicates of the real thing in 1/25 scale. Wheels also carried accurate detail, including authentic and official logos and scripts in hubcap centers.|$|E
50|$|The <b>completed</b> <b>chassis</b> {{and engine}} were then {{shipped to the}} Maserati {{restoration}} experts at Steve Hart Racing in England. In completing the restoration, the restoration facility added additional original Birdcage parts including rear lights, repeater lights, rev counter, ignition switch (also known as the light switch), starter button, indicator switch (also known as turn signal), and front hubs. This information is verified in a letter written and signed by the restoration facility owner.|$|R
50|$|When kit car {{production}} {{slowed down}} {{towards the end}} of the 1990s McDonald began to look for alternatives. Graham Berry had a <b>completed</b> <b>chassis</b> for a Lotus Seven based car. His intention was to a cheap kit car that could be built for less than $10,000. The kit used Mark 1 or 2 Ford Escort parts and was launched through Classic Car magazine in 2002. The XL was created to meet a demand for a slightly larger chassis.|$|R
5000|$|Corniche MK V: One car <b>completed.</b> The <b>chassis</b> number given was 14-BV ( [...] A lighter {{gauge steel}} {{was used as}} an {{experiment}} to save weight [...] ) ...|$|R
50|$|The Structural {{components}} division Maxion Structural Components produces mainly sidemembers, crossmembers and <b>complete</b> <b>chassis</b> {{for commercial}} vehicles and structural stamped items for light vehicles.|$|E
50|$|A {{total of}} only 303 {{were made and}} only 3 {{original}} and complete surviving cars are known. Besides this also a <b>complete</b> <b>chassis</b> with all the mechanics survived.|$|E
50|$|In 1924 Poland bought 135 <b>complete</b> <b>chassis</b> of the B2 with Kégresse track (known as Citroën-Kegresse B2 10CV). Some were {{converted}} to all-terrain lorries while 90 {{were converted}} to Samochód pancerny wz. 28 armoured cars.|$|E
25|$|Under the {{agreement}} with Studebaker, Garford would receive <b>completed</b> <b>chassis</b> and drivetrains from Ohio and then mate them with Studebaker-built bodies, which were sold under the Studebaker-Garford brand name at premium prices. Eventually, vehicles with Garford-built engines began to carry the Studebaker name. Garford also built cars under its own name and, by 1907, attempted to increase production {{at the expense of}} Studebaker. Once the Studebakers discovered this, John Mohler Studebaker enforced a primacy clause, forcing Garford back on to the scheduled production quotas. The decision to drop the Garford was made and the final product rolled off the assembly line by 1911, leaving Garford alone until it was acquired by John North Willys in 1913.|$|R
5000|$|All Superformance {{cars are}} {{originally}} built at Hi-Tech Automotive's 270000 sq ft plant in Port Elizabeth, South Africa {{before they are}} shipped as <b>complete</b> rolling <b>chassis</b> minus engine. [...] Hi-Tech also supplies customers with non-road cars ready to race on the track.|$|R
5000|$|On leaving {{school he}} studied {{automobile}} {{engineering at the}} Northampton Institute (now part of the City University, London) but being more practical than academic he left after a year {{to work at the}} repair facilities of F.W.Berwick and Company in Balham, where he started by sweeping the floors for 2d per hour. Frederick William Berwick became a partner in the Anglo-French automobile manufacturing company Sizaire-Berwick and in August 1913 Warner was sent to work as a mechanic in Paris. He drove <b>completed</b> <b>chassis</b> to the coast from where they were shipped to England, road-testing them en-route [...] He acquired a working knowledge of French which stood him in good stead throughout his life, an imitation of Maurice Chevalier became a part of his repertoire.|$|R
50|$|A <b>complete</b> <b>chassis</b> was leased to Pirelli for the 2012 Formula One season, {{to be used}} by the tyre {{manufacturer}} as its test car. The car {{was tested}} by Jaime Alguersuari and Lucas di Grassi at several European racetracks, including Jerez, Spa, Monza and Barcelona.|$|E
5000|$|The {{third floor}} {{was used for}} final assembly, [...] "the <b>complete</b> <b>chassis</b> coming down {{to the second floor}} for the bodies."

5000|$|There is also {{evidence}} of [...] narrow gauge railways used on site for construction and later transportation of materials for maintenance. Photographs show the route in 1928 and 1932. Three <b>complete</b> wagon <b>chassis</b> were unearthed in 2003 during excavations for the Bekonscot Light Railway and {{these have been}} restored and displayed around the Bekonscot site for posterity.|$|R
50|$|The {{main product}} was an open, 2+2 seater, {{traditionally}} styled kit car based at {{first on the}} chassis and mechanical components of the Triumph Herald. An aluminium panelled body and glass fibre wings completed the car. As the Triumphs became rarer, and collectable in themselves, a <b>complete</b> new <b>chassis</b> was designed in 1980 to take components from the Ford Cortina Mk III-V.|$|R
5000|$|A Special coupé body, {{they were}} {{features}} {{of almost all}} the Morris range {{for more than a}} decade, was no longer available but a [...] "rolling" [...] chassis remained in the catalogue for those who wished to have their car fitted with special coachwork. These very <b>complete</b> <b>chassis</b> kits included wings, running-boards, headlamps, instruments, spare wheel and complete tool kit.|$|E
5000|$|By March 1906, {{the company}} advertised in a {{national}} trade magazine as [...] "the car without a weak spot." [...] Their 4-cylinder, 30 to 35-horsepower Model F was priced from US$3,500 to US$5,000, [...] "depending on body equipment." [...] The <b>complete</b> <b>chassis</b> {{was made by the}} Garford Motor Truck Co., the largest manufacturers of high-grade automobile parts and chassis in America.|$|E
50|$|Plant 3 at Detroit made <b>complete</b> <b>chassis</b> for Special and Big Six {{models in}} over 750000 sq ft of floor space. Plant 5 was the service parts store and {{shipping}} facility, plus the executive offices of various technical departments. The Detroit facilities {{were moved to}} South Bend in 1926, except that the Piquette Avenue Plant (Plant 10) was retained for assembly of the Erskine between 1927 and 1929 and the Rockne (1931-1933).|$|E
50|$|Production ceased in March 1974 after 274 were <b>completed,</b> {{the last}} <b>chassis</b> numerically were numbers 56041/2 which were ordered by Huddersfield and {{delivered}} to West Yorkshire PTE in September and October 1974 respectively (registered PVH 452/453M).|$|R
50|$|JW Engineering {{wished to}} <b>complete</b> the GT40 <b>chassis</b> numbers GT40P-1087, 1088 and 1089. This was {{supposed}} to take place prior to the beginning of Safir production, however the completion of these three chassis’ was very much delayed.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} 1600 De Luxe {{versions}} were produced with leftover special wheels and four-wheel disc brakes of the departed Twin-Cam, or using <b>complete</b> modified Twincam <b>chassis</b> left redundant by the discontinuance of that model. Seventy roadsters and 12 coupés were built.|$|R
50|$|Experiments on the Holt {{caterpillar}} tracks started in May 1915 at the Schneider plant with a 75-hp wheel-directed {{model and the}} 45-hp integral caterpillar Baby Holt, showing {{the superiority of the}} latter. On 16 June, new experiments followed in front of the President of the Republic, and on 10 September for Commander Ferrus. The first <b>complete</b> <b>chassis</b> with armour was demonstrated at Souain on 9 December 1915, to the French Army, with the participation of colonel Estienne.|$|E
5000|$|Black {{encouraged}} {{the supply of}} chassis to external coachbuilders such as Avon and Swallow Coachbuilding and Jensen. The coachbuilding company of Avon during the early 1930s commenced producing cars with a distinctly sporty appearance, using as a foundation, a <b>complete</b> <b>chassis</b> from the Standard Motor Company. These chassis were ordinary production units, used because of their sound engineering design and good performance. Known as Avon Standard Specials they catered for a select market too small for Standard themselves.|$|E
50|$|The 750 cc {{model was}} first {{shown by the}} factory at the 1980 Paris {{motorcycle}} show and introduced for the 1981/1982 season. Bike magazine reported that the French importers were to have entered two 750 cc Tiger Trail bikes in the Paris-Dakar Rally. Certainly, French magazine Moto Verte entered and reported upon a 750 cc Tiger Trail in the Paris-Tunis rally and whilst failing to finish, praised the engine feeling only suspension adjustments rather a <b>complete</b> <b>chassis</b> redesign was needed.|$|E
50|$|Rover's {{description}} of items {{included with the}} purchase of a chassis for bespoke bodywork: <b>chassis</b> <b>complete</b> with lighting and starting equipment, horn, speedometer, clock, bonnet, front wings, step boards, luggage grid, number plates, shock absorbers, wire wheels, spare wheel and tire, tool kit.|$|R
30|$|These {{mechanical}} components {{are combined into}} a <b>complete</b> module, the <b>chassis,</b> to support steering and driving systems as shown in Figure  6 (h). Figure  6 (j) is the final formed platform module with added front body and seat units shown in Figure  6 (i).|$|R
50|$|In 1954 a French {{car dealer}} in Hollywood found {{itself with a}} number of <b>complete</b> Panhard <b>chassis</b> and engines and sold them to racer Bill Devin, who quickly {{developed}} a fibreglass roadster body and marketed them as Devin-Panhards. The cars were available fully built or in kit form. Approximately twelve were built. The 750 or 850 cc engines were also available with modified Manx Norton motorcycle cylinder heads. This may have been the first-ever automotive use of belt-driven (double, in this case) overhead camshafts.|$|R
50|$|Initially two prototypes were built, chassis numbers PX-1 and PX-2. Steve Hope {{was one of}} the testdrivers. The first <b>complete</b> <b>chassis</b> {{was bought}} by W. Jerry Gillis, who would win the 1996 Pro Series title. The cars were built by Racefab Inc. from Rusk, Texas. The tube frame chassis, {{designed}} by David Bruns was fitted with a four-speed Weismann transaxle. The engine was production based derived from a Dodge Intrepid. The Dodge engine was upgraded to produce 255hp. Pete Brock designed the wedge-shaped body.|$|E
50|$|If {{one were}} to make a C++ {{software}} Class to implement the relationships described above, the Car object would contain a <b>complete</b> <b>Chassis</b> object in a data member. This Chassis object would be instantiated in the constructor of the Car class (or defined as the data type of the data member and its properties assigned in the constructor.) And since {{it would be a}} wholly contained data member of the Car class, the Chassis object would no longer exist if a Car class object was to be deleted.|$|E
5000|$|From 1938 the car {{could also}} be had with a more luxurious Tickford {{drophead}} coupé body by Salmons of Newport Pagnell and 252 were made. The soft top {{could be used in}} three positions, fully open, closed or open just over the seats. Wind-up windows were fitted to the higher topped doors making the car more weathertight and individual bucket seats used in the fully carpeted interior. <b>Complete</b> <b>chassis</b> were fitted with a very basic body at the Abingdon factory and driven to Newport Pagnell to have their coachwork fitted.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} cars {{might or}} might not be Model Bs. Chances are also that either V-8s were used, or that they have modern parts (<b>chassis,</b> <b>complete</b> bodies, or body panels) that are produced for hot rodder's needs. You can build your complete car, using only aftermarket parts.|$|R
50|$|Founded in 1924 by Friedrich Rometsch, {{the company}} took {{advantage}} of the German custom of their buying a <b>chassis</b> <b>complete</b> with an engine and then employing a coachbuilder to add a custom-built body to it. By the late 1930s it was more usual to buy the complete vehicle.|$|R
50|$|In total, {{only three}} cars using the {{original}} Reynard design were <b>completed.</b> The fourth <b>chassis</b> shared many elements from the Reynard design, {{but was also}} altered to meet hybrid regulations. The newer Zytek 07S and Creation CA07 no longer share anything mechanical with Reynard chassis and are considered different designs.|$|R
