5000|$|Recently, SWNTs were {{directly}} configured as energy conversion materials to fabricate thin-film solar cells, with nanotubes serving as both photogeneration sites and a charge carriers collecting/transport layer. The solar cells {{consist of a}} semitransparent thin film of nanotubes <b>conformally</b> <b>coated</b> on a n-type crystalline silicon substrate to create high-density p-n heterojunctions between nanotubes and n-Si to favor charge separation and extract electrons (through n-Si) and holes (through nanotubes). Initial tests have shown a power conversion efficiency of >1%, proving that CNTs-on-Si is a potentially suitable configuration for making solar cells. For the first time, Zhongrui Li demonstrated that SOCl2 treatment of SWNT boosts the power conversion efficiency of SWNT/n-Si heterojunction solar cells by more than 60%. [...] Later on the acid doping approach is widely adopted in the later published CNT/Si works. Even higher efficiency can be achieved if acid liquid is kept inside the void space of nanotube network. Acid infiltration of nanotube networks significantly boosts the cell efficiency to 13.8%,as reported by Yi Jia, [...] by reducing the internal resistance that improves fill factor, and by forming photoelectrochemical units that enhance charge separation and transport. The wet acid induced problems can be avoided by using aligned CNT film. In aligned CNT film, the transport distance is shortened, and the exciton quenching rate is also reduced. Additionally aligned nanotube film has much smaller void space, and better contact with substrate. So, plus strong acid doping, using aligned single wall carbon nanotube film can further improve power conversion efficiency (a record-high power-conversion-efficiency of >11% was achieved by Yeonwoong Jung).|$|E

This type of filter {{consists of an}} array of parallel, independent, leaky waveguides made {{in the form of}} a free-standing, two-dimensionally ordered silicon structure with pore walls coated by a dielectric multilayer. This structure offers high levels of rejection within a very wide rejection band combined with a high level of transmission within a pass band that could be centered anywhere in the deep and far UV range. In addition, unlike common interference-based filters, the spectral position of the pass and rejection bands is independent of the angle of incidence. These filters consist of two-dimensionally ordered Macroporous Silicon (MPSi), fabricated by electrochemical etching of silicon wafers. Multilayer coating of the pore walls results in the band-pass, short-pass, or band-blocking transmittance spectra of MPSi filters.
