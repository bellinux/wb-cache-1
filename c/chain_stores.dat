40|$|In recent years, {{the sales}} reports of major retail chains have {{received}} increasing attention as timely indicators of consumer spending. Despite this attention, a close {{review of the}} literature on <b>chain</b> <b>store</b> indexes as macroeconomic indicators reveals that there is no literature! This paper fills this gap, showing how <b>chain</b> <b>store</b> data fit into the broader issues of how we measure and forecast consumer spending. We describe the linkages between <b>chain</b> <b>store</b> data and official measures of consumer spending, highlighting the key seasonality and pricing issues. We then present a battery of in-sample and out-off-sample tests to determine what are the best models for monthly forecasts of retail sales and personal consumption expenditures. While our results question the way <b>chain</b> <b>store</b> data are sometimes used in forecasting, we find strong evidence that the <b>chain</b> <b>store</b> data can significantly improve forecast accuracy, and we show that the best models combine several consumer-related variables with both of the leading <b>chain</b> <b>store</b> indexes. We conclude with some practical advice on the "do's" and "don'ts" of consumption forecasting. Consumer behavior; Retail trade; Economic indicators...|$|R

His calls for funding the free {{textbook}} program, compulsory sterilization of the mentally ill, and restrictions on <b>chain</b> <b>stores</b> were ignored. Instead, the legislature continued eroding his gubernatorial powers, including the power to appoint members of the textbook commission. With nearly all of the governor's powers stripped away and given to a three-person commission, Lieutenant Governor James Breathitt, Jr. became the de facto governor for the remainder of Sampson's term. The General Assembly pursued its own agenda, passing a mandatory driver's license law, a revised election law, and a sales tax on retail stores. They also allocated funding for the purchase of what would become Mammoth Cave National Park. Sampson vetoed 12 bills during the 1930 session, but the legislature overrode 11 of them.|$|E
5|$|The {{economy of}} Dawson Creek {{is based on}} four major industries: agriculture, retail, tourism, and oil and gas. Agriculture has {{historically}} been the most important industry to Dawson Creek, as the city is the regional transshipment point for agricultural commodities. The city is surrounded by the Agricultural Land Reserve, where the soil can support livestock and produces consistently good yields of quality grain and grass crops, such as canola, hay, oats, alfalfa, wheat, and sweet clover. The service and retail sector caters to the city's inhabitants, smaller nearby towns, and rural communities. However, there is significant retail leakage to Grande Prairie, the closest major Alberta city, {{where there is no}} provincial tax on retail purchases, while British Columbia charges 7%. In 2006, the BC government rejected a proposal to lower the sales tax in the province's border communities to 4%. The problem of leakage has been exacerbated in recent years by the introduction of large-format retail stores into the small city. Residents still cross the border for high-priced items but now also purchase medium- and low-priced items from foreign-owned large-format <b>chain</b> <b>stores.</b>|$|E

They then conduct formal statistical tests of the relationship between <b>chain</b> <b>store</b> data and official measures of total retail sales and personal consumption expenditure.

40|$|Part VI: Services, Supply Chains and OperationsInternational audienceIn the 1970 s, the Japanese {{restaurant}} industry introduced the <b>chain</b> <b>store</b> system, which was later {{introduced into the}} retail industry in the USA to enhance productivity [1] [2]. The <b>chain</b> <b>store</b> system was designed to realize “low-cost operations”. For instance, <b>chain</b> <b>store</b> restaurants simplify and automate service operations {{to reduce the number}} of service staff. Moreover, they standardize service operations by introducing service manuals for use in training part-time staff. Prices of dining decreased throughout <b>chain</b> <b>store</b> systems, and Japanese consumers came to enjoy restaurants casually. Consequently, the market scale of the Japanese {{restaurant industry}} expanded from 8 trillion yen to 250 trillion yen during the 1970 s to 1990 s.

The major findings of this study include: consumer’s social and economic backgrounds will influence their repurchase intentions on <b>chain</b> <b>store</b> supermarkets; the higher the brand image of a <b>chain</b> <b>store</b> supermarket is, the higher the consumer’s repurchase intention will be; the higher the consumer perceived quality and perceived value of <b>chain</b> <b>store</b> supermarket are, the higher the repurchase intention will be.
