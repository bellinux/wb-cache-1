5|$|Fustat was {{the capital}} of Egypt for {{approximately}} 500 years. After the city's founding in 641, its authority was uninterrupted until 750, when the Abbasid dynasty staged a revolt against the Umayyads. This conflict was focused not in Egypt, but elsewhere in the Arab world. When the Abbasids gained power, they moved various capitals to more controllable areas. They had established the centre of their caliphate in Baghdad, moving the <b>capital</b> <b>from</b> its previous Umayyad location at Damascus. Similar moves were made throughout the new dynasty. In Egypt, they moved the <b>capital</b> <b>from</b> Fustat slightly north to the Abbasid city of al-Askar, which remained the capital until 868. When the Tulunid dynasty took control in 868, the Egyptian capital moved briefly to another nearby northern city, Al-Qatta'i. This lasted only until 905, when Al-Qatta'i was destroyed and the capital was returned to Fustat. The city again lost its status as capital city when its own vizier, Shawar, ordered its burning in 1168. The capital of Egypt was ultimately moved to Cairo.|$|E
5|$|In 1153 the Jin emperor Wanyan Liang {{moved the}} empire's <b>capital</b> <b>from</b> Huining Prefecture in {{northern}} Manchuria (south of present-day Harbin) to Zhongdu (now Beijing). Four {{years later in}} 1157 he razed Beijing, including the nobles’ residences, and moved the Jin's southern <b>capital</b> <b>from</b> Beijing to Kaifeng. It was here at the former seat of the Song dynasty that he began a large project of reconstruction (since the siege against it in 1127). For much of his reign there was peace between Jin and Song, while both states upheld an uninterrupted flow of commercial trade between each other. While amassing tribute from the Southern Song, the Jin dynasty also imported large amounts of tea, rice, sugar, and books from the Southern Song. However, Wanyan Liang reopened the Jin dynasty's armed conflict with the Song by the 1160s.|$|E

5|$|By {{the morning}} of 8 July, the French had still failed to {{concentrate}} their forces, which consisted of 576 regular French Army soldiers and 2,717 militia dispersed across the island.

While Keating was landing, Frazier had advanced on the <b>capital</b> <b>from</b> the west, storming a French barricade on the road from Saint Paul and routing its defenders with minimal casualties. Brushing aside French resistance in a series of minor skirmishes, Keating and Frazier's forces closed on Saint Denis. The advancing British were met at 18:00 by representatives of Sainte-Suzanne, who later signed a capitulation that surrendered the entire island to Rowley, Keating and Farquhar with its garrison and supplies.|$|E
