Moreover, the mass, complexity, and bulk of electronic circuitry incorporating these highly miniaturized cooling devices could be considerably reduced, relative to otherwise <b>equivalent</b> <b>circuitry</b> cooled by conventional electromechanical, thermoelectric, and fluidic means.

40|$|A {{simulation}} model is presented which investigates the dynamic response {{of a deep}} mine hoisting cable system during a winding cycle. The response, namely the lateral motions of the catenary cable and the longitudinal motion of the vertical rope with conveyance is observed on the fast time scale, and the slow time scale is introduced to monitor the variation of slowly varying parameters of the system. The <b>cable</b> <b>equivalent</b> proportional damping parameters, and periodic excitation functions resulting from the cross-over cable motion on the winder drum are identified. Subsequently, the model is solved numerically using parameters of a double-drum multi-rope system. Since the system eigenvalues are widely spread {{and the problem is}} of stiff nature, the numerical simulation is conducted using a stiff solver. The results of the simulation demonstrate various transient non-linear resonance phenomena arising in the system during the wind. The nominal ascending cycle simulation results reveal adverse dynamic behaviour of the catenary largely due to the autoparametric interactions between the in- and out-of-plane modes. Principal parametric resonances of the lateral modes also occur, and conditions for autoparametric interactions between the lateral and longitudinal modes arise. Additionally, a transition through a number of primary longitudinal resonances takes place during the wind. The adverse dynamic motions in the system promote large oscillations in the cable tension which must be considered significant with respect to fatigue of the cable. It is noted that a small change in the winding velocity may cause large changes in the dynamic response due to the resonance region shifts. Consequently, the resonance modal interactions can be avoided, to a large extent, if the winding velocity is increased to an appropriate level. ...|$|R

Degassing effects and thermal ageing effects have also been studied with the spectroscopy techniques. Thermal-electric behaviour and maximum voltages for thermal breakdown have been theoretically simulated for the model cables. Three loss origins of the XLPE cables have been found with different loss mechanisms. Conduction loss due to thermally activated electron/hole hopping dominates the lower frequency range from 10 - 4 Hz to 1 Hz; Semicon loss due to its in series resistance with the insulation layer in <b>cable</b> <b>equivalent</b> circuit dominates the higher frequency range from 102 Hz to 104 Hz; intrinsic polarization loss of the XLPE insulation has dominant flat loss spectra in the mid-frequency range from 1 Hz to 102 Hz.

Thermal-electric simulation results with FEMLAB have shown that the position of maximum field changes from inner to outer insulation boundary under higher applied voltages.

One of the main topics is the expansion and novel implementation of continuous mode theory, with the intention of improving the bandwidth and efficiency of X band power amplifiers. This work builds upon the Class B/J continuous mode theory to incorporate cases where <[ZF 0] 6 = RL, not described by the original Class B/J theory, with a tool called the “clipping contour”. The clipping contour tool shows a graphical representation on the Smith chart of the boundary between impedances generating a voltage waveform which will modulate or “clip” the current waveform, and a voltage waveform which will leave the current waveform unaltered. This non-clipping space is shown, with measured load pull and amplifier data, to represent the maximum efficiency case for a given ZF 0, thus the clipping contour tool thus gives designers the ability to predict the areas of highest efficiency and power given any ZF 0, without the need to use costly, time consuming multi harmonic load pull techniques. Push pull amplifiers using quarter wave coupled line baluns are proposed as an ideal matching topology to exploit this new tool. Various balun topologies are studied using a novel extended transmission line model.

40|$|In {{the last}} decade a large {{scientific}} community {{has focused on the}} study of the memristor. The memristor is thought to be by many the best alternative to CMOS technology, which is gradually showing its flaws. Transistor technology has developed fast both under a research and an industrial point of view, reducing the size of its elements to the nano-scale. It has been possible to generate more and more complex machinery and to communicate with that same machinery thanks to the development of programming languages based on combinations of boolean operands. Alas as shown by Moore's law, the steep curve of implementation and of development of CMOS is gradually reaching a plateau. It is clear the need of studying new elements that can combine the efficiency of transistors {{and at the same time}} increase the complexity of the operations. Memristors can be described as non-linear resistors capable of maintaining memory of the resistance state that they reached. From their first theoretical treatment by Professor Leon O. Chua in 1971, different research groups have devoted their expertise in studying the both the fabrication and the implementation of this new promising technology. In the following thesis a complete study on memristors and memristive elements is presented. The road map that characterizes this study departs from a deep understanding of the physics that govern memristors, focusing on the HP model by Dr. Stanley Williams.
