The FVdG remained affiliated with the SPD, which in turn tolerated it because the SPD was afraid a split would lead to a large loss of members. The FVdG stated it would rejoin the centralized trade unions like the SPD leadership desired only if the centralized unions accepted the FVdG's organizational principles.|$|E

They also served as a surveillance system, aiding the security services in locating individuals with views critical of the RCC, leading to the arrest of Ba'athists, Marxists, and Islamists. Operating in a pyramid structure, the base form of these Committees were local working groups, who sent elected representatives to the district level, and from there to the national level, divided between the General People's Congress and the General People's Committee. Above these remained Gaddafi and the RCC, who remained responsible for all major decisions. In crossing regional and tribal identities, the committee system aided national integration and <b>centralization</b> <b>and</b> tightened Gaddafi's control over the state and administrative apparatus.|$|E

5|$|As secretary, Calhoun had {{responsibility}} for management of Indian affairs. He promoted a plan, adopted by Monroe in 1825, {{to preserve the}} sovereignty of eastern Indians by relocating them to western reservations they could control without interference from state governments. In over seven years Calhoun supervised the negotiation and ratification of 40 treaties with Indian tribes. Calhoun opposed the invasion of Florida launched in 1818 by General Jackson during the First Seminole War, which was done without direct authorization from Calhoun or President Monroe. The United States annexed Florida from Spain in 1819 through the Adams–Onís Treaty. A reform-minded modernizer, he attempted to institute <b>centralization</b> <b>and</b> efficiency in the Indian Department and in the Army by establishing new coastal and frontier fortifications and building military roads, but Congress either {{failed to respond to}} his reforms or responded with hostility. Calhoun's frustration with congressional inaction, political rivalries, and ideological differences spurred him to create the Bureau of Indian Affairs in 1824. The responsibilities of the bureau were to manage treaty negotiations, schools, and trade with Indians, in addition to handling all expenditures and correspondence concerning Indian affairs. Thomas McKenney was appointed as the first head of the bureau.|$|E
5|$|The First Anglo-Dutch War (1652–54) saw the {{development}} of the line of battle, a tactic where ships formed a continuous line to fire broadsides at an enemy. Previously, naval tactics had favored short-range firepower and boarding with intent to take prizes. After the mid-17th century, tactics shifted from close-quarter fighting to disabling or sinking opponents through superior, long-distance firepower. This entailed major changes in doctrine, shipbuilding, and professionalism in European navies from the 1650s onwards. The line of battle favored large ships that were heavily armed and robust enough to hold the line in the face of enemy fire. The increased <b>centralization</b> <b>and</b> concentration of power in the emerging nation-states during the late 17th century allowed for a great expansion of armies and navies, and new government shipyards began building much much larger ships. Sweden embarked on an expansive shipbuilding program in the late 1660s.|$|E

25|$|Modern {{historians have}} put forward many views and {{explanations}} {{of the civil war}} era. The contemporary sources, the sagas, strongly emphasise the personal nature of the conflicts—wars arose {{as a result of the}} struggle between different people for the possession of the throne. The unclear succession laws, and the practice of power-sharing between several kings simultaneously, gave personal conflicts the potential to become full-blown wars. More recently historian Narve Bjørgo has suggested that the practice of power-sharing was actually a good way of governing the kingdom in the first period after its unification, and that tendencies towards <b>centralization,</b> <b>and</b> a unitary kingdom, were important factors in triggering the wars. Edvard Bull has also emphasized geographical animosities as a factor, pointing to the fact that different pretenders often found their main support in certain parts of the country. Also important was the involvement of foreign powers: Danish and, to a lesser extent, Swedish kings were always ready to lend their support to factions in the Norwegian wars, with an eye to extending their own influence, particularly in the Viken (Oslofjord) area.|$|E

In late 1945, the committee proposed a plan to the New York State Education Department, which was approved. Unfortunately the plan {{was out of the}} scope of a reasonable budget. By late 1950, town residents began commenting on the inadequacies of the then current infrastructure, equipment, and services within their schools. In early 1952, the district superintendent created a committee made up of one member from each school district to reevaluate centralization. By July 1953, the committee was formed and a chairman elected. That August, committee members met with members of the Education Department to discuss school programs and expected expenditures. It is estimated that an average teacher's salary would be $3,750 in 1956. In March 1954, the Centralization Committee produced a pamphlet entitled Digest of Facts to inform the community of the project. In April 1954, a citizens' advisory committee was created, made up of 48 individuals, representing all districts involved in centralization. By August, the committee produced A Partnership in Education pamphlet to be distributed in the area. On October 8, 1956, the citizens' committee voted to centralize and the first Board of Education was elected.|$|E
25|$|The French Renaissance and the {{beginning}} of the Ancien Régime, normally marked by the reign of Francis I, saw the nation become far more unified under the monarch. The power of the nobles was diminished as a national army was created. With England expelled from the continent and being consumed by the Wars of the Roses, France's main rival was the Holy Roman Empire. This threat to France became alarming in 1516 when Charles V became the king of Spain, and grew worse when Charles was also elected Holy Roman Emperor in 1519. France was all but surrounded as Germany, Spain, and the Low Countries were controlled by the Habsburgs. The lengthy Italian Wars that took place during this period resulted in defeat for France and established Catholic Spain, which formed a branch of the Habsburg holdings, as the most powerful nation in Europe. Later in the 16th century, France was weakened internally by the Wars of Religion. As nobles managed to raise their own private armies, these conflicts between Huguenots and Catholics all but demolished <b>centralization</b> <b>and</b> monarchical authority, precluding France from remaining a powerful force in European affairs. On the battlefield, the religious conflicts highlighted the influence of the gendarmes, heavy cavalry units that comprised the majority of cavalrymen attached to the main field armies. The pride of the royal cavalry, gendarme companies were often attached to the main royal army in hopes of inflicting a decisive defeat on Huguenot forces, although secondary detachments were also used for scouting and intercepting enemy troops.|$|E

40|$|Abstract This study {{adopts a}} {{contingency}} approach {{in order to}} analyze the mediating role of internal, customer and supplier integration {{on the relationship between}} organization structure (OS) (<b>centralization,</b> formalization <b>and</b> hierarchical relationship) and operational performance. Using a global sample from the oil and gas industry, this research examines the direct relationship between the dimensions of organization structure (<b>centralization,</b> formalization <b>and</b> hierarchical relationship) and operational performance. In addition the direct relationship between the dimensions of supply chain integration (SCI) and operational performance is also examined. A quantitative approach using structural equation modeling is used to test the research hypotheses. Data was collected using a questionnaire survey and explored using statistical techniques. Findings revealed that <b>centralization,</b> formalization, <b>and</b> hierarchical relationship negatively impact operational performance of oil and gas supply chains, and that SCI dimensions positively affect operational performance. By further testing for the mediation this study found that by increasing internal and external SCI, oil and gas companies can mitigate the negative effect of high <b>centralization,</b> formalization <b>and</b> hierarchical relationship, on operational performance. More specifically by classifying OS into the “structuring” and “structural” aspects, this research provides evidences on which of the two (the physical or the process) has a stronger negative impact on operational performance. From a practical point of view, it may be a difficult and daunting task for oil and gas companies to restructure and reform their OS (physical aspect), since this process might be timely and expensive to implement. Therefore oil and gas companies by investing in higher internal and external integration create more inter and intra collaboration and communication which could ultimately encourage organizational restructuring and the move towards organic structures. Therefore instead of viewing organizational theory (OS) and operations management (SCI) in isolation, this study endorses a combined approach (OS and SCI) to improve the operational performance of the oil and gas supply chains. Theoretical contributions to the field of operations management and organizational studies are provided...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{theology}} of Deuteronomy, and argues that {{at the heart of}} Deuteronomic theology is the supremacy of Yahweh, which is to be expressed by all generations of Israelites through adherence to Torah. This study maintains that the ideas of <b>centralization,</b> secularization, <b>and</b> demythologization as commonly understood fail to account adequately for the data of the text. In this view, the book of Deuteronomy is radical in its demands and vision, but not in the ways that it is usually understood. In its deliberate rejection of ANE models of kingship and institutional permanence, its emphasis on the holiness of all life lived out before Yahweh, and its elevation of the supremacy of Yahweh and his Torah, Deuteronomy reveals itself to be a truly revolutionary and counter-cultural text. In the introductory chapter, the structure and ideology of the book are examined. The present study is set into the context of Deuteronomic study, and it is argued that the book of Deuteronomy reflects an ideology that seeks to highlight the supremacy of Yahweh and the centrality of Torah. Chapter One then examines some {{of the ways in which}} {{the theology of}} Deuteronomy has been understood, namely in terms of <b>centralization,</b> secularization, <b>and</b> demythologization. I argue that <b>centralization,</b> secularization, <b>and</b> demythologization as usually understood fail to adequately account for the data of the text, and that an alternative conception should be sought. Chapters Two through Five evaluate key texts that are used to support the idea that <b>centralization,</b> secularization, <b>and</b> demythologization are at the heart of the theology of Deuteronomy. An alternative reading of the texts is presented that highlights the supremacy of Yahweh and Torah. The final chapter investigates the theological and ideological implications of this alternative reading of key texts. Deuteronomy is seen to be radical, and even revolutionary, but in a much different way from the way it is usually understood...|$|R
