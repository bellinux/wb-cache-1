5|$|Power {{supply in}} Romblon is {{generated}} by the National Power Corporation (NPC) and serviced by two electric cooperatives. Tablas Island Electric Cooperatives (TIELCO) serves the power needs of Tablas Island including San Jose. It operates a 5.070 MW diesel power plant in Odiongan and 1.740 MW power barge in San Agustin. The electric cooperative serves a total of 21,097 house connections. Romblon Electric Cooperative (ROMELCO) supplies the capital town of Romblon through a 1.720 MW diesel power plant and a 1.30 MW power barge. It also serves Sibuyan Island using a 3.006 MW diesel power plant in San Fernando. ROMELCO has 5,288 house <b>connections</b> <b>in</b> Romblon and 5,150 house <b>connections</b> <b>in</b> the three municipalities located in Sibuyan Island or a total of 10,438 house <b>connections</b> <b>in</b> their franchise area. Additionally, ROMELCO installed in 2010 a mini hydro power plant in Cantigas, San Fernando, producing 900kW of power. Meanwhile, Banton, Concepcion and Corcuera are attended to by the National Power Corporation (NPC) thru their municipal governments.|$|E

2500|$|An Ehresmann {{connection}} on a {{fiber bundle}} (endowed with a structure group) sometimes {{gives rise to}} an Ehresmann connection on an associated bundle.

5|$|Lock Haven's economy, {{from the}} city's {{founding}} in 1833 {{until the end}} of the 19th century, depended heavily on natural resources, particularly timber, and on cheap transportation to eastern markets.

The West Branch Canal, reaching the city in 1834, connected to large markets downstream, and shorter canals along Bald Eagle Creek added other <b>connections.</b> <b>In</b> 1859, the first railroad arrived in Lock Haven, spurring trade and economic growth.|$|E

5|$|Spores are broadly {{ellipsoid}} in shape, amyloid, {{and have}} dimensions of either 8–10 by 6–7µm or 10–14 by 6.7–8.5µm {{depending on whether}} they originated from four-or two-spored basidia (spore-bearing cells), respectively. There are abundant cheilocystidia on the gill edges. They measure 30–50 by 7–12µm, and are fusoid-ventricose, with tips that are broadly rounded. They are filled with a purplish sap and have granular contents. The cap tissue comprises a well-differentiated cuticle, a distinct hypoderm, and a filamentous tramal body. Clamp <b>connections</b> <b>in</b> the hyphae are rare or absent.|$|E

5|$|The {{classification}} {{of the genus}} Cryptothecia has been unclear, and historically, C.rubrocincta has been placed in several different genera. Like all lichens, C.rubrocincta is an association of a fungus (the mycobiont) with a photosynthetic organism (the photobiont), in this case, an algae. Initially, it was unknown whether the mycobiont component of C.rubrocincta was an ascomycete or a basidiomycete. Although {{the vast majority of}} lichen mycobionts are from the Ascomycota, in 1937 German lichenogist Friedrich Tobler believed the mycobiont to be a basidiomycete, because he interpreted some unusual microscopic structures to be clamp connections, structures associated only with the basidiomycete fungi. In another publication later that year, he specified the mycobiont to be a hymenomycete, and described the monotypic genus Herpothallion to supersede the old name Chiodecton sanguineum. Although Vernon Ahmadjian corroborated the presence of clamp <b>connections</b> <b>in</b> the species when he studied the species' cytology in 1967, other researchers did not find clamp <b>connections</b> <b>in</b> specimens collected from different countries. Further doubt was cast on the possibility of a basidiomycete mycobiont with the discovery of the depside confluentic acid in 1966, concentric bodies in 1975, and woronin bodies in 1983, as all of these characteristics are restricted to Ascomycetes.|$|E
5|$|The {{spore print}} is an olive-brown colour. The oval to {{spindle-shaped}} spores have dimensions of 8–10 by 3.5–4.5μm.

Cystidia are present on both the tube ends (cheilocystidia) and tube faces (pleurocystidia). There are no clamp <b>connections</b> <b>in</b> the hyphae of Suillus bovinus. The cap cuticle comprises filamentous, gelatinized hyphae with a diameter of 2.6–5.0μm. The mycelium has a pink tinge.|$|E

5|$|Fruit bodies {{produce a}} white spore print. Spores are {{elliptical}} to cylindrical, smooth, hyaline (translucent), and measure 3.5–5 by 2–3μm.
