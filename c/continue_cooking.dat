40|$|Abstract: One {{hundred and}} forty five head chefs and {{catering}} managers of restaurants in Owerri, Nigeria were surveyed {{to establish their}} knowledge of food safety hazards and control measures. Face-to-face interviews were conducted and data collected on their knowledge of risk perception, food handling practices, temperature control, foodborne pathogens, and personal hygiene. Ninety-two percent reported that they cleaned and sanitized food equipment and contact surfaces while 37 % engaged in cross-contamination practices. Forty-nine percent reported that they would allow a sick person to handle food. Only 70 % reported that they always washed their hands while 6 % said that they <b>continued</b> <b>cooking</b> after cracking raw eggs.

50|$|Due to Waters' {{insistence on}} using the highest-quality {{ingredients}} {{she could find}} regardless of cost, coupled with her lack of experience working in—not to mention running—a restaurant, Chez Panisse struggled financially for many years after it opened. The restaurant also gained a reputation for its staff's partying and illegal drug use, which contributed to {{the environment of the}} young Chez Panisse. Nonetheless, Waters and Aratow <b>continued</b> on, <b>cooking</b> country French-inspired meals with local California ingredients.

50|$|The curve also {{provides}} a larger usable cooking surface versus western-styled pots and pans, which typically have vertical edges.

5000|$|Wonderbag is a stand-alone, non-electric {{insulated}} bag {{designed to}} reduce the amount of fuel required in the cooking of food in developing countries. Instead of being placed on a stove for the duration of the cooking period, food is instead heated to a hot enough temperature then transferred to the Wonderbag, which uses the principle of thermal insulation to <b>continue</b> <b>cooking,</b> and keeps food warm without needing addition fire, or additional heat. [...] Working on the principle of thermal cooking, the Wonderbag is estimated to save up to 30% of the total fuel costs associated with cooking with Kerosene ("paraffin") alone. In developing countries there are numerous advantages for the product, as it immediately helps ease deforestation of natural reserves, and it frees up those who would spend their time gathering the extra wood for fire fuel.|$|E

40|$|Rationale: More than two-fifths of the world’s {{population}} uses solid fuels, mostly biomass, for cooking. Household {{air pollution}} from solid fuels is the 4 th largest risk {{factor contributing to}} the global burden of disease, much of this related {{to the development of}} chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) among non-smoking women in developing countries. To assess whether reducing woodsmoke exposure using a chimney-stove, compared to open fires, decreased markers of airway inflammation associated with COPD pathogenesis, we recruited young biomass smoke-exposed women who were participating in a randomized controlled stove intervention trial, RESPIRE. Design: We carried out a cross-sectional analysis on a sub-cohort of RESPIRE participants, including 45 indigenous women remaining {{at the end of the}} 18 -month trial. Of these women, 19 had previously been randomized to receive a chimney stove and 26 <b>continued</b> <b>cooking</b> over an open fire. We obtained spirometry and induced sputum for differential cell counts, gene expression of interleukin(IL) - 8, tumor necrosis factor(TNF) -α, matrix metalloprotease (MMP) - 9 and 12, and protein concentrations of IL- 8, myeloperoxidase and fibronectin. Exposure-response regression analyses were performed using these outcomes with exhaled carbon monoxide (CO) and 48 -hr personal CO tubes as markers of biomass smoke exposure. Results: MMP- 9 gene expression was significantly reduced in women using chimney stoves compared to open fires. Exhaled CO concentration was significantly associated with IL- 8, TNF-α, and MMP- 9 gene expression. 48 -hr personal CO concentrations were significantly associated with MMP- 9 and MMP- 12 gene expression. Percent neutrophils and fibronectin concentration were negatively correlated with FEV 1. No significant associations were seen by stove-type or exposure for lung function or sputum cell counts in this small sample. Conclusions: Decreased biomass smoke exposure is associated with decreased gene expression of MMP- 9, MMP- 12, IL- 8, and TNF-α, potential mediators of airway remodeling in COPD. Reducing biomass smoke exposure with a chimney stove may reduce airway inflammation, though larger studies are needed to clarify whether such reductions would be effective in decreasing COPD incidence or progression...|$|R
