50|$|Water gel {{explosives}} {{are frequently}} used as <b>cartridge</b> <b>explosives</b> {{because they are}} much easier to load into large casings. With water gel explosives, the slurry material can simply be poured into the casing. Traditional explosives are cast into the casing. This process is laborious and the charge may begin to shrink, creating multiple voids. A final advantage of slurry {{is that it can}} be stored in non-explosive component form and sensitized into field-manufactured explosive as it is needed. The explosive may be sensitized by the addition of gas, metal powder, or another explosive such as TNT, RDX, HMX, or PETN. The water in water gel explosives is converted into a reactant by the addition of large amounts of aluminum.|$|R

25|$|Gunpowder as a gun {{propellant}} {{suffered from}} several weaknesses inherent to its composition. It {{was subject to}} passivation by moisture and was awkward to load and ignite in a weapon. Sulfur oxides and moisture produced corrosion on metal gun components and the smoke gave away {{the position of the}} shooter. The development of <b>cartridges</b> and <b>explosive</b> primers were a major improvement in the use of gunpowders in the field.|$|R
25|$|Some of the {{clean-up}} included {{disposing of}} live <b>explosive</b> <b>cartridges</b> and shells using controlled explosions. The explosives {{to be cleaned}} up were buried by the army in unknown years.The residents of surrounding small towns could hear the controlled explosions {{being used in the}} disposal activity from 2-3 miles away.|$|R
50|$|On November 3, 1984, {{two members}} of the M19CO, Susan Rosenberg and Timothy Blunk, were arrested at a mini-warehouse they had rented in Cherry Hill, New Jersey. Police {{recovered}} more than 100 blasting caps, nearly 200 sticks of dynamite, more than 100 <b>cartridges</b> of gel <b>explosive,</b> and 24 bags of blasting agent from the warehouse.|$|R
50|$|In January 2016, Argentine Minister of Defence Julio Martinez {{confirmed}} that all Air Force Lockheed Martin A-4AR Skyhawk (Fightinghawk) fighters were grounded. Originally {{this was due}} to the expiry of the <b>explosive</b> <b>cartridges</b> in their ejection seats, but apparently there are additional problems. In any case only 4-5 were airworthy with the rest in storage at Villa Reynolds.|$|R
50|$|The Coffman starter was an <b>explosive</b> <b>cartridge</b> {{operated}} device, {{the burning}} gases either operating {{directly in the}} cylinders to rotate the engine or operating through a geared drive. First introduced on the Junkers Jumo 205 diesel engine in 1936 the Coffman starter was not widely used by civil operators due to {{the expense of the}} cartridges.|$|R
25|$|The Wankel {{design is}} used in the seat belt {{pre-tensioner}} system in some Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen cars. When the deceleration sensors detect a potential crash, small <b>explosive</b> <b>cartridges</b> are triggered electrically, and the resulting pressurized gas feeds into tiny Wankel engines which rotate to take up the slack in the seat belt systems, anchoring the driver and passengers firmly in the seat before a collision.|$|R
50|$|A 5-metre (16 foot) {{test rig}} {{was built in}} the form of a tripod, one of the legs being in the form of guide rails. The seat was {{propelled}} up the guide rails by a gun, consisting of two telescopic tubes energised by an <b>explosive</b> <b>cartridge.</b> The guide rails were provided with ratchet stops every 75mm (3 inches), so that the seat was automatically arrested at the top of its travel.|$|R
50|$|The mortar had {{a firing}} pin {{in the bottom}} of the tube. When the shell was dropped down the tube, the firing pin struck the Ignition Cartridge in the shell's tail, detonating it. When the <b>cartridge</b> detonated, the <b>explosive</b> gases exited the base of the shell through two bleed holes. This {{propelled}} the shell out of the tube in an arc. Unassisted, the mortar shell had a range of about 200 to 325 yards.|$|R
40|$|Overburden strata {{movement}} in large space stope {{is the major}} reason that induces the appearance of strong mining pressure. Presplitting blasting for hard coal rocks is crucial for the prevention and control of strong pressure in stope. In this study, pressured water coupling blasting technique was proposed. The process and effect of blasting were analyzed by orthogonal test and field practice. Results showed {{that the presence of}} pressure-bearing water and <b>explosive</b> <b>cartridges</b> in the drill are the main influence factors of the blasting effect of cement test block. The high load-transmitting performance of pore water and energy accumulation in <b>explosive</b> <b>cartridges</b> were analyzed. Noxious substances produced during the blasting process were properly controlled because of the moistening, cooling, and diluting effect of pore water. Not only the goal of safe and static rock fragmentation by high-explosive detonation but also a combination of superdynamic blast loading and static loading effect of the pressured water was achieved. Then the practice of blasting control of hard coal rocks in Datong coal mine was analyzed to determine reasonable parameters of pressured water coupling blasting. A good presplitting blasting control effect was achieved for the hard coal rocks...|$|R

The TSA {{said it would}} ban toner and ink cartridges weighing over 16 ounces (453 grams) from all passenger flights. The ban applies to both carry-on bags and checked bags, and does not affect average travelers, whose toner cartridges are generally lighter.|$|R
50|$|The Milkor Stopper is a riot gun {{used for}} riot control, {{designed}} {{to fire a}} 37/38mm or 40mm cartridge, {{which can be a}} 9mm Buckshot, Rubber ball buckshot, teargas canister, rubber shot <b>cartridge</b> or <b>explosive.</b> The weapon is simple to operate and all metal surfaces are treated with a coating for corrosion protection, plus long-life dry film lubrication. It fires one shot before reloading. It is a conventional single shot, break-open weapon (opening at the breech like an ordinary shotguns (not pump-action)) with a floating firing pin mechanism that ensures safety when accidentally dropped. As a security or assault weapon, it can be fired from the shoulder or like a pistol by hand. The components of the weapon are interchangeable (client dependent), providing a range of applications from Less Lethal 37/38mm to a 40mm Lethal weapon.|$|R
50|$|Aircraft {{components}} {{was another}} market into which Plessey diversified. In 1936 Plessey obtained {{a number of}} important manufacturing licences from American companies such as Breeze Corporation for aircraft multi-pin electrical connectors, Federal Laboratories for Coffman starters (an <b>explosive</b> <b>cartridge</b> device used to start aircraft engines), and Pump Engineering Services Corporation for the manufacture of Pesco fuel pumps. Plessey went on to produce large numbers of Pesco fuel pumps for Rolls Royce Merlin engines, and in 1940 the fuel pump for Britain's first jet engine was also supplied by Plessey.|$|R
50|$|His RAF {{career began}} as a {{consultant}} in aviation medicine, followed by his appointment as commandant of the Institute of Aviation Medicine in 1975, a post he held until 1988. Other appointments included; Dean of Air Force Medicine from 1985 to 1987, The Queen's Honorary Physician from 1982 to 1988 and that of Royal Air Force's Senior Consultant from 1987 to 1988. Howard gained some notoriety in 1962, as {{the first man to}} test the world's first rocket-powered ejector seat, developed by the Martin-Baker company. The rocket-powered ejector seat had distinct advantages over the original <b>explosive</b> <b>cartridge</b> seats in that it subjected the ejecting airmen to much lower G forces, thus reducing the risk of injuries.|$|R
500|$|The {{propelling}} charge was prepared with an electrically triggered detonator in a primer bound with insulating tape {{to three or}} four <b>cartridges</b> of ammonal <b>explosive.</b> This assembly was placed in a small, waterproof rubber bag that was, in turn, placed inside a used cocoa tin. [...] of magnesium alloy turnings were added to ensure ignition of the fuel. The electrical wires were passed through a small hole in the lid of the tin which was then tightly fitted. The {{propelling charge}}s were kept in storage, only to be deployed when enemy action was imminent. To activate the device, the propelling charge was lowered down the pipe and tamped down with dry soil before being connected to a firing point about [...] away. Firing required the current delivered by a 120 V battery.|$|R
5000|$|The 6-inch guns used [...] "non-fixed ammunition", that is, the <b>explosive</b> <b>cartridge</b> that {{propelled}} {{the shell}} was stored and loaded {{separately from the}} shell or shot. Cartridges were made of raw silk, and stored in wooden crates in a special high-security section of the underground magazine. There were five types of shell on the Fort Rodd manifest in 1897: High Explosive (Lyddite), Armour-piercing, Common Pointed (for non-armoured maritime targets), and Shrapnel. The other class of projectile (and the one most often fired) was a solid steel shot (without any cavity for explosives or fuses, it was cheapest to produce). The shells and shot all had the same service weight of 94 pounds (to simplify calculation of elevation and depression) and diameter of 6 in; therefore, lengths of the various types varied.|$|R
50|$|The Anglo-American Explosives Company began {{manufacturing}} its shotgun {{powder in}} Oakland, New Jersey in 1890. DuPont began producing guncotton at Carneys Point Township, New Jersey in 1891. Charles E. Munroe of the Naval Torpedo Station in Newport, Rhode Island patented a formulation of guncotton colloided with nitrobenzene, called Indurite, in 1891. Several United States firms began producing smokeless powder when Winchester Repeating Arms Company started loading sporting <b>cartridges</b> with <b>Explosives</b> Company powder in 1893. California Powder Works began producing {{a mixture of}} nitroglycerine and nitrocellulose with ammonium picrate as Peyton Powder, Leonard Smokeless Powder Company began producing nitroglycerine-nitrocellulose Ruby powders, Laflin & Rand negotiated a license to produce Ballistite, and DuPont started producing smokeless shotgun powder. The United States Army evaluated 25 varieties of smokeless powder and selected Ruby and Peyton Powders as the most suitable {{for use in the}} Krag-Jørgensen service rifle. Ruby was preferred, because tin-plating was required to protect brass cartridge cases from picric acid in the Peyton Powder. Rather than paying the required royalties for Ballistite, Laflin & Rand financed Leonard's reorganization as the American Smokeless Powder Company. United States Army Lieutenant Whistler assisted American Smokeless Powder Company factory superintendent Aspinwall in formulating an improved powder named W.A. for their efforts. W.A. smokeless powder was the standard for United States military service rifles from 1897 until 1908.|$|R
50|$|The Venom FB 1 was {{powered by}} a single 4,850 lbf (21.6 kN) thrust Ghost 48 Mk.1 {{turbojet}} engine; later marks were equipped with increasingly powerful models. The engine was ignited using <b>explosive</b> <b>cartridges,</b> known as Coffman engine starters; at the time, many operators were not previously familiar with such means of start up. Early production models lacked ejection seats, which was subject to official criticism; in response, later production models were furnished with them. The airframe itself had a relatively short life due to having been designed for {{its role as a}} short term interim aircraft; in Swiss service, where the type was subject to a lengthy service life, several strengthening modifications were performed to more than double its viable lifespan. It was known for its simplicity in construction and relative cost-effectiveness, which contributed to its popularity to export customers.|$|R
50|$|Currently an {{electric}} motor {{is the most popular}} choice to power stationary tools, though in the past they were powered by windmills, water wheels and steam. Some museums and hobbyists still maintain and operate stationary tools powered these older power sources. Portable electric tools may be either corded or battery-powered. Compressed air is the customary power source for nailers and paint sprayers. A few tools (called powder-actuated tools) are powered by <b>explosive</b> <b>cartridges.</b> Tools that run on gasoline or gasoline-oil mixes are made for outdoor use; typical examples include most chainsaws and string trimmers. Other tools like blowtorches will burn their fuel externally to generate heat. Compressed air is universally used where there is a possibility of fuel or vapor ignition - such as automotive workshops. Professional level electric tools differ from DIY or 'consumer' tools by being double insulated and not earthed - in fact they must not be earthed for safety reasons.|$|R
5000|$|Although Keke was poor, she {{ensured that}} her son was well dressed {{when he went to}} school, likely through the {{financial}} support of family friends.

5000|$|As {{the first}} {{operational}} military jet in late 1944 to ever feature one, the lightweight Heinkel He 162A Spatz featured {{a new type}} of ejection seat, this time fired by an <b>explosive</b> <b>cartridge.</b> In this system, the seat rode on wheels set between two pipes running up the back of the cockpit. When lowered into position, caps {{at the top of the}} seat fitted over the pipes to close them. Cartridges, basically identical to shotgun shells, were placed in the bottom of the pipes, facing upward. When fired, the gases would fill the pipes, [...] "popping" [...] the caps off the end, and thereby forcing the seat to ride up the pipes on its wheels and out of the aircraft.

50|$|Either an {{electrical}} starter or an air-start system {{is used to}} start the engine turning. On large engines, pre-lubrication and slow turning of an engine, as well as heating, are required to minimise the amount of engine damage during initial start-up and running. Some smaller military diesels can be started with an <b>explosive</b> <b>cartridge,</b> called a Coffman starter, which provides the extra power required to get the machine turning. In the past, Caterpillar and John Deere used a small petrol pony engine in their tractors to start the primary diesel engine. The pony engine heated the diesel to aid in ignition and used a small clutch and transmission to spin up the diesel engine. Even more unusual was an International Harvester design in which the diesel engine had its own carburetor and ignition system, and started on petrol. Once warmed, the operator moved two levers to switch the engine to diesel operation, and work could begin. These engines had very complex cylinder heads, with their own petrol combustion chambers, and were vulnerable to expensive damage if special care was not taken (especially in letting the engine cool before turning it off).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a multipurpose UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) for mountain rescue operations. The multi-rotors based flying platform and its embedded avionics {{are designed to}} meet environmental requirements for mountainous terrain such as low temperatures, high altitude and strong winds, assuring the capability of carrying different payloads (separately or together) such as: avalanche beacon (ARTVA) with automatic signal recognition and path following algorithms for the rapid location of snow-covered body; camera (visible and thermal) for search and rescue of missing persons on snow and in woods during the day or night; payload deployment to drop emergency kits or specific <b>explosive</b> <b>cartridge</b> for controlled avalanche detachment. The resulting small (less than 5 kg) UAV is capable of full autonomous flight (including take-off and landing) of a pre-programmed, or easily configurable, custom mission. Furthermore, the autopilot manages the sensors measurements (i. e. beacons or cameras) to update the flying mission automatically in flight. Specific functionalities such as terrain following were developed and implemented. Ground station programming of the UAV is not needed, except compulsory monitoring, as the rescue mission can be accomplished in a full automatic mode...|$|R

40|$|Due to {{economic}} gain {{the use of}} explosives for rock breaking has been the preferred choice in the mining industry for extracting minerals and the construction industries for driving tunnels and underground excavations. Although misfires are not an expected outcome in any form of blasting operations, however, due to the confined nature of underground blast the likelihood of blasthole misfires occurring is increased {{compared to that of}} a surface blast. Past research on the use of explosives for rock breaking have been concerned with issues about improving the effective use of explosive energy neglecting such effect as safety hazards and increased operational cost resulting from blasthole misfires. This research project investigate misfires in tunnel blasts with the aim of developing method(s) of minimising it occurrence during the blast design and identify blasthole misfires should they occur. Through a series of test blasts carried out at the Holman’s Test Mine operated by the Camborne School of Mines, three identification techniques based on blast emission data were developed namely; Electro-Magnetic Pulse (EMP Signature), Light (Optical Signature) and seismic (Vibration Signature). The study therefore concluded that whilst no one single method developed could effectively identify blasthole misfires in tunnel blasts, the vibration signature approach is the most pragmatic method for misfire identification in tunnel blasts as measurements are remotely undertaken. Moreover, blast vibration is well understood and part of almost all tunnel blasting operation. The blast vibration measurements and analyses undertaken {{during the course of this}} research resulted in the identification of potential blasthole misfires and aided in the safe retrieval of unexploded detonators and <b>explosives</b> <b>cartridges.</b> As a result of the research project several misfires were identified immediately after full face tunnel blasts at the Holmans’ Test Mine and appropriate measures taken to handle the misfires.
