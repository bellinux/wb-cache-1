METHODS: A total of 286 patients with HCC (male/female: 178 / 108, age: 46 - 100 years), who were diagnosed and treated by appropriate therapeutic procedures between January 2000 and December 2010, were enrolled in this study. Patients were stratified into two groups {{on the basis of}} age: Elderly (&#x 2265; 75 years old) and non-elderly (< 75 years old). Baseline clinical characteristics as well as <b>cumulative</b> <b>survival</b> <b>rates</b> were then compared between the two groups. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to {{identify the}} factors associated with prolonged overall survival of patients in each group. <b>Cumulative</b> <b>survival</b> <b>rates</b> in the two groups were calculated separately for each modified Japan Integrated Stage score (mJIS score) category by the Kaplan-Meier method. In addition, we compared the <b>cumulative</b> <b>survival</b> <b>rates</b> of elderly and non-elderly patients with good hepatic reserve capacity (&#x 2264; 2 points as per mJIS). RESULTS: In the elderly group, the proportion of female patients, patients with absence of hepatitis B or hepatitis C viral infection, and patients with coexisting extrahepatic comorbid illness was higher (56. 8 % vs 31. 1 %, P < 0. 001; 27. 0 % vs 16. 0 %, P = 0. 038; 33. 8 % vs 22. 2 %, P = 0. 047; respectively) than that in the non-elderly group. In the non-elderly group, the proportion of hepatitis B virus (HBV) -infected patients was higher than that in the elderly group (9. 4 % vs 0 %, P = 0. 006). The <b>cumulative</b> <b>survival</b> <b>rates</b> in the elderly group were 53. 7 % at 3 years and 32. 9 % at 5 years, which were equivalent to those in the non-elderly group (55. 9 % and 39. 4 %, respectively), as shown by a log-rank test (P = 0. 601).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A controlled clinical trial using a parallel group design was carried out on 258 children aged 6 - 7 years old, allocated to two treatment groups: conventional restorative treatment using amalgam and ART using high-viscosity glass ionomer. A total of 364 amalgam restorations and 386 ART restorations were placed by three pedodontists in 126 and 158 children, respectively, and were evaluated after 0. 5, 1, and 2 years. Restorations were placed in vital primary molars with neither pain nor signs of pulp involvement. The survival analysis was conducted using the proportional hazard rate regression model with frailty correction. RESULTS: The 2 -year <b>cumulative</b> <b>survival</b> <b>rates</b> for all amalgam (77. 3 %) and ART (73. 5 %) restorations were not statistically significantly different, but there was an effect of "type of surface" (single/multiple) and "cavity filling time" on the <b>survival</b> <b>rates.</b> Both amalgam and ART single-surface restorations had higher <b>survival</b> <b>rates</b> than multiple-surface restorations of the same material. Secondary caries was responsible for 36 and 38 % of failures in amalgam and ART restorations, respectively.

They treated 234 patients with a mean tumor size of 4.1 ± 1.9  cm (range 1.2 – 8.0  cm) and reported a 5 -year <b>cumulative</b> <b>survival</b> <b>rate</b> of 57 %[85]. Liang et al. treated 288 HCC patients with a mean tumor size of 3.75  cm ± 1.58 (range 1.2 – 8.0  cm) and reported a 5 -year <b>cumulative</b> <b>survival</b> <b>rate</b> of 51 %. Child-Pugh classification, tumor size, and number of tumors were identified as significant independent prognostic factors. They concluded {{that there is a}} significantly higher probability of long-term survival after MWA treatment for patients with a single tumor of 4.0  cm or less and Child-Pugh class A cirrhosis [86]. Reported complications of MWA are similar to those reported for RFA and are typically mild, including pain, fever, liver enzyme elevation, ascites, pleural effusion, and diaphragm injury.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{aim of this}} {{retrospective}} chart {{review was}} to evaluate the four-year survival rate of a titanium implant system. Methods: A total of 352 sand-blasted, thermally acid-etched titanium implants were in-serted into 181 partially or completely edentulous patients. Their <b>cumulative</b> <b>survival</b> <b>rate</b> was evaluated retrospectively. Associated factors, such as the implant distribution and treatment type {{were included in the}} evaluation. Results: The implants were equally distributed between the maxilla (52. 3 %) and the man-dible (47. 7 %). 48 implants (13. 6 %) were placed in the anterior region and 304 implants (86. 4 %) in the posterior region. The majority of the implants were inserted into bone of type II and III quality (89. 8 %) and volume (quantity B and C, 87. 2 %). Most of the implants (70. 7 %) were restored as single crowns; 28. 7 % supported a bridge construction and 0. 6 % a full denture. Only one implant failed, resulting in a four-year <b>cumulative</b> <b>survival</b> <b>rate</b> of 99. 7 %. Conclusions: The implant system showed an excellent four-year survival rate. It proved to be a safe and predictable means for restoration of the dentition in partially or completely edentulous patients...|$|E
40|$|Hypothesis: The surgeon can {{contribute}} substantially {{to the long-term}} survival rate of patients undergoing hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Design: The long-term survival rate of patients with HCC undergoing hepatectomy has improved, but {{the contribution of the}} surgeon to the improved survival rate is unknown. We surveyed 211 consecutive patients undergoing hepatectomy for HCC. The clinical, operative, and pathological factors were analyzed to identify factors that were important in affecting long-term survival. Setting: A tertiary referral center. Patients: From April 1989 to December 1995, 211 consecutive patients with HCC underwent 153 major and 58 minor hepatectomies. Main Outcome Measures: Disease-free and overall <b>cumulative</b> <b>survival</b> <b>rate.</b> Results: The 5 -year disease-free survival rate was 27 %. By Cox regression analysis, blood transfusion (relative risk [RR], 1. 21; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 05 - 1. 40) and TNM stage (RR, 1. 90; 95 % CI, 1. 47 - 2. 47) were shown to be independent prognostic factors in the 5 -year disease-free survival rate. The 5 -year overall <b>cumulative</b> <b>survival</b> <b>rate</b> was 37 %. By Cox regression analysis, the preoperative indocyanine green retention value at 15 minutes after injection (RR, 1. 03; 95 % CI, 1. 01 - 1. 06), blood transfusion (RR, 1. 191; 95 % CI, 1. 078 - 1. 316), tumor rupture (RR, 1. 48; 95 % CI, 1. 08 - 2. 04), and TNM stage (RR, 1. 62; 95 % CI, 1. 27 - 2. 07) were shown to be significant independent factors that influenced <b>cumulative</b> <b>survival</b> <b>rate.</b> Conclusions: The long-term survival of patients with HCC after hepatectomy depends on tumor staging, preoperative hepatic functional reserve, history of blood transfusion, and rupture of HCC. Preoperative liver function and tumor staging cannot be altered; however, the surgeon can {{play an important role in}} improving the prognosis if blood transfusion and iatrogenic tumor rupture can be avoided and if function of the liver remnant can be preserved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Objective: A re-pneumatization {{phenomenon}} {{was recorded}} in sinuses grafted with different materials. The specific aims of this paper were to assess the dental implant <b>survival</b> <b>rate</b> and the behavior of marginal and apical bone remodeling around dental implants placed following sinus augmentation. Materials and methods: A retrospective study was conducted on consecutive patients treated in two surgical centers. Different surgical techniques were adopted for sinus augmentation: simultaneous or delayed dental implant insertion with bovine bone-material augmentation or autologous bone grafting (chin and iliac crest). <b>Survival</b> <b>rates</b> were recorded for {{the overall number of}} implants (patients of group A). Apical and marginal bone levels (ABL and MBL, respectively) were radiographically measured, and statistical analysis was performed in implants of a subgroup of patients (group B). Results: A total of 282 dental implants were positioned. Recorded <b>cumulative</b> <b>survival</b> <b>rates</b> (CSRs) were 95. 6...|$|R
40|$|From May 1974 to December 1982, 3, 592 {{patients}} underwent {{cardiac catheterization}} at the Buffalo Veterans' Administration Medical Center. Three hundred sixty-three patients (10. 2 %) presented with ejection fractions (EFs) < 40 %. Of these, 194 had significant coronary artery disease. Follow-up data for retrospective analysis of <b>survival</b> <b>rates</b> {{were available for}} 173 of the 194 patients. Fifty-eight of these 173 had undergone coronary artery bypass surgery, while the remaining 115 had received medical treatment. The <b>cumulative</b> <b>survival</b> <b>rates</b> at 8 years for patients with EFs < 25 % reveal a significantly better <b>survival</b> <b>rate</b> (61 % vs. 29 %, p <. 03) for surgically treated patients. We conclude that coronary artery bypass surgery yields higher 8 -year <b>survival</b> <b>rates</b> than does medical treatment for patients with compromised left ventricular function and significantly low EFs (< 25 %).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to predict the outcome of implant restorations in the {{treatment}} of partial edentulism, taking into account implant interdependency and the effect of several confounding variables. Between December 1982 and June 1998, 1956 Brånemark system implants (1212 and 744 in the maxilla and mandible, respectively, 846 distal to first premolars) were installed in 660 patients (248 males) at the Department of Periodontology of the University Hospitals of the Catholic University of Leuven. Of the 810 restorations installed at the Department of Prosthetic Dentistry of the same hospital, 235 were single crowns, 166 were supported by implants and teeth and 409 were free-standing fixed partial prostheses. An additional 87 restorations was placed in private dental offices and were not included. The patients were followed from implant installation until June 1999. The estimated <b>cumulative</b> <b>survival</b> <b>rates</b> were 91. 4 % for all implants and 95. 8 % for all restorations over a period of 16 years. Estimated <b>cumulative</b> <b>survival</b> <b>rates</b> from loading for implant-tooth connected and free-standing implants were, respectively, 93. 6 % and 97. 2 %. Neither jaw site nor implant position (anterior-posterior) had any significant effect on the outcome. Short implant length, high number of implants per patient, low number of implants per prosthesis, implants loaded by acrylic-veneered restorations and implants combined with bone grafting present a higher risk hazard for implant failure. The idea of not splinting the implants in a fixed partial prosthesis is promising but needs replication before accepting it. status: publishe...|$|R
