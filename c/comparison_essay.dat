40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the impact of}} service-learning on native and non-native English speaking college composition students. The general research question is: In what ways does participation in service-learning impact student learning? Specific research questions pertaining to the general categories of student writing performance, motivation, and social orientation, are as follows: (1) Does service-learning impact students' perception of self, school, community, and society? If so, how? (2) Do native and non-native English speaking students respond to service-learning similarly? Why or why not? (3) Are native and non-native English speaking students affected by service-learning similarly? Why or why not? (4) What other factors [...] such as learning style, previous experience with community service, and career goals [...] impact service-learning outcomes? (5) Does service-learning lead to improved student writing? If so, in what ways? The study consists of treatment and comparison groups of native and non-native English speaking students, {{for a total of}} four classes in the case study. Critical pedagogy, complexity theory, teacher research, experiential and service-learning theories provide the main theoretical rationales for the study. Data collection involved surveys, student interviews, participant observations, analysis of students' journal and essay writing, and course evaluations. Douglas Biber's (1988) multifeature/multidimensional approach to textual analysis was used, along with holistic and primary trait analyses of student texts to determine what, if any, impact service-learning had on the student's writing performance. The initial results document cognitive, sociocultural, and affective factors that contribute to the writing performance of linguistically and culturally diverse learners. Service-learning had a positive impact on participants' self-perception as members of the local community and on their personal agency in promoting social change. ESL students were especially enthusiastic about improved cross-cultural understanding and oral communication skills {{as a result of their}} community service. More students in the service-learning sections also thought their writing had improved as a result of the course than in the comparison sections, and independent assessments of their essays supported this view.

But are these innovations as successful as they promise to be? In this review, the characteristics and impact of assessment are examined from the student’s point of view. Research findings suggest that students’ perceptions about assessment, have considerable influences on students’ approaches to learning. But also vice versa, students’ approaches influence the ways in which students perceive assessment. Furthermore, it was found that students hold strong views about different formats and methods of assessment.

The theoretical background is a general survey of some of the abundant literature relating to Second Language Acquisition and Error Analysis, and a large part of it deals with interlanguage theories. The analytical part of the work presents the results of the study, including a grammatical classification of the totality of the errors encountered as well as a presentation of the results for the whole of each class and for each individual learner. Finally, some of the theories are related to the results of the analysis and some conclusions are drawn. A part of the work consisted in the gathering of essays written by learners (exclusively with Swedish as their mother tongue) of the same class in a real school context, first to make a quantitative study of their errors, and second to make a <b>comparison</b> between their <b>essays</b> written at two different points in time.

The results are that errors concerning Verbs (especially Concord), as well as miscellaneous spelling errors, were the most frequent ones, and this is true for both grades.

Under the current law, as soon as an author creates a copyrightable work of authorship and fixes that work in a tangible medium of expression, the work is entitled to protection. This formulation ignores the critical issues of whether fluid works of authorship that are constantly evolving can be subject to copyright protection and, if so, what is the scope of such protection. Not much has been said or written about how copyright should address such fluid works of authorship that are, by their very essence, continually in progress or otherwise subject to change on an ongoing basis. This dearth of discussion is particularly surprising given that law professors spend a majority of their time writing articles and books that are constantly in a state of flux.

Andrew Willet, the likely author of this work, quoted it against Richard Hooker in order to show how the latter contravened the sacramental {{theology}} of the national Church as interpreted by Jewel as one of the foremost expositors of its doctrine. Jewel, however, in his Reply to Harding’s Answer, enumerates four means of the Christian’s union with Christ: the Incarnation, faith, baptism, and the Eucharist-a fact overlooked in A Christian Letter by its author in his endeavor to impeach Hooker’s orthodoxy. Proceeding from the observation that both Jewel and Hooker believed that the locus of Christian salvation is union with Christ, this essay compares the two divines’ respective views of this union by examining {{the manner in which they}} understand the role of each of these means forming and maintaining this union. On the basis of this <b>comparison,</b> the <b>essay</b> argues that A Christian Letter misrepresented Jewel’s position and that Hooker’s view of union with Christ was essentially the same as the late bishop of Salisbury’s, notwithstanding some differences in detail and emphases.

40|$|Comparison presupposes {{translation}} and translation presupposes <b>comparison.</b> This <b>essay</b> emphasizes {{the process of}} translation that happens within us and around us, i. e., translation ‘inwards’ and ‘outwards’ or, in this particular case, translation as cultural perception. Theoretically, my thinking on the matter {{is rooted in the}} concept of ‘intersemiotic translation’ coined by Roman Jakobson; in Lawrence Venuti’s research which reveals challenges of translation to cultural identity; also in Alphonso Lingis’s philosophy and his elaboration on ‘historiographic thinking’;and in Arjun Appadurai’s study of ‘the imaginary’ as a social act. All these ideas form a rich ground for rethinking the process of ‘translation of culture’ that is taking new shapes and obtaining new meanings within the context of contemporary globalization and cross-cultural communication. Referring to Lithuanian translations of literary texts written by Greek authors –Achileas Kyriakides, Eleni Ladia, Thodores Kallifatides, and Gashmed Kaplany – I not only express by means of the Lithuanian language various perceptions of ‘greekness’, but also try to grasp the feeling of similarity between these two cultural spaces. To achieve this effect, I choose to speak here of the phenomenon of ‘greekness’ as perceived by Greeks themselves. The literary texts as cultural facts help me to reveal that self-perception of oneself as ‘letterless-noteless-speechless’ emerges {{as a result of the}} translation of culture. It also significantly involves ‘the imaginary’ – an imaginative relationship with history, with contemporaneity, with the foreignness, with the other, and with the larger notion of ‘home’ in general. It seems that memory and self-perception of neither people is a simple memorial. It is an ongoing process of inside/outside translation...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the vast}} spatial and {{theological}} gulfs separating the Rabbinic and Brah-manic communities, their respective intellectual projects {{have a number}} of analogous features. My discussion will (1) outline for each tradition a set of interpretive strate-gies, showing how these two sets are strikingly similar in approach and logic. Then I will (2) propose that these resemblances are not entirely coincidental. They largely stem from a similar view of the object of study—Torah and the biblical text for the Rabbis, the sacri ce and its verbal articulation for the Brahmins—as eternal, not of human authorship, perfect in form, rich in hidden meanings, the criterion of right ac-tion and true knowledge. The exegete aims to fully internalize the sacred word, to perceive the world through it, and to uncover what is hidden in it. This much of my analysis might also be applicable to other traditions that regard themselves as possess-ing revelation, but (3) I argue that there are further parallels here in the direction these traditions carried their interpretive enterprise. In each tradition, the interpreters contin-ued to build an edi ce of ritual knowledge and interpretation even as the central rites were eclipsed by other forms of piety: whether because the cult became inaccessible (in the Diaspora) or unperformable (when the Temple was destroyed), or because it lost patronage (as appears to have happened in India). In tandem with the shift away from priestly sacri ce, each tradition promotes the ideal of study for its own sake, and the transfer of priestly functions to the learned householder. I.

Methods COPT was a teaching strategy wherein, students were taught physiology using cases and critical thinking questions. Three batches of undergraduate medical students (n = 434) served as the experimental groups to whom COPT was incorporated in the third block (teaching unit) of Physiology curriculum and one batch (n = 149) served as the control group to whom COPT was not incorporated. The experimental group of students were trained to answer clinically oriented questions whereas the control group of students were not trained. Both the group of students undertook a block exam which consisted of clinically oriented questions and recall questions, at the end of each block. Results Comparison of pre-COPT and post-COPT essay exam scores of experimental group of students revealed that the post-COPT scores were significantly higher compared to the pre-COPT scores. <b>Comparison</b> of post-COPT <b>essay</b> exam scores of the experimental group and control group of students revealed that the experimental group of students performed better compared to the control group. Feedback from the students indicated that they preferred COPT to didactic lectures. Conclusion The study supports the fact that assessment and teaching patterns should fall in line with each other as proved by the better performance of the experimental group of students compared to the control group. COPT was also found to be a useful adjunct to didactic lectures in teaching physiology. </p...|$|R
40|$|Keywords: Rhetoric, Expository or {{analysis}} <b>essay,</b> <b>Comparison</b> and ContrastEssay, English Students of Faculty of Cultural Studies. There {{are different}} ways to deliver ideas inside the heads effectively. Here, rhetoric {{is the best way}} to learn how to deliver any thought or idea using good structure and organization in an effective way. Although rhetoric is much closed with speaking or persuasion, it can be applied in writing process especially for academic essays. Here, the researcher wants to knowThe data are the 30 expository essays written on 24 May 2014 by the fourth semester English students in the Faculty of Cultural Studies. There, this research is a textual analysis. In analyzing the data, the researcher does not include the whole essays from the students, because there are three essays do not have criteria as it was determined by the researcher. Then, the researcher analyzed it by using essay checklist proposed by Oshima and Hogue. From the finding, the researcher found two data which do not have thesis statement and twenty four data which have clearly focused on the thesis statement for the whole essay in the introductory paragraph. In the body paragraph were found twenty five data which have clearly topic sentence with the controlling idea, twenty two data which have sufficient supporting details, and twenty six data which have paragraph support only one main idea. Based on the findings, the researcher concludes that the most of the essay written by fourth semester English students in the faculty of Cultural Studies is have good essay organization. Then, it is suggested that the students think rhetorically in delivering their ideas in writing essays. Besides, the researcher also suggests the next researcher to analyze rhetoric and its influences by using other subjects...|$|R
40|$|The {{automated}} assessment of student's essays is regarded {{by many as}} the Holy Grail of computer aided assessment. Whilst a few people search for the grail, many more deny its existence. This paper describes the various approaches that have been taken over the last 40 years in an attempt to solve the problems involved with the computerized assessment of free text. The earliest approaches were founded in simple style analysis. Systems, such as Project Essay Grade (PEG), were developed upon the idea that certain surface features of an essay could be manipulated {{in such a way as}} to predict the grade that a human examiner would assign to an essay. Other methods, such as Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), also take a statistical approach to marking, but focus on actual textual content, analyzing groupings and context. The Educational Testing Service (ETS) originally attempted to tackle the problem from a classification point of view whilst more recent work by ETS bears similarities to PEG in its statistical approach. Most of the methods currently being developed have been shown to be capable of generating essay scores that correlate with a human grader's scores at least as well as two human graders correlate with each other [...] A novel approach being adopted by the authors to allow the <b>comparison</b> of students' <b>essays</b> against a model answer involves the use of theories developed for interlingual machine translation. A few different methods for knowledge representation, and their current uses in machine translation are presented. Panlingua, an idea for knowledge representation developed by Chaumont Devin, is based on semantic network research. Using a system of nodes over four layers it attempts to model how the brain might translate from sensory patterns it sees or hears at the top l [...] ...|$|R
