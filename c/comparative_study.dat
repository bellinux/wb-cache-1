5|$|A <b>comparative</b> <b>study</b> of {{the amino}} acid {{composition}} of eleven Portuguese wild edible mushroom species showed Boletus edulis {{to have the}} highest total amino acid content, about 2.3g per 100g of dried mushroom. This total includes {{a full complement of}} 20 essential and nonessential amino acids. Analysis of the free amino acids (that is, those not bound up in protein) revealed glutamine and alanine to be the principal amino acids (each about 25% of total compounds); a separate analysis concluded that lysine is another predominant compound.|$|E

The proposed explanation was that slower gas washout or continued gas uptake offset benefits of reduced bubble growth at deep stops.|$|E
40|$|New {{opportunities}} for pursuance of literary <b>comparative</b> <b>studies,</b> referred to these days as "new/non-classical/cultural" <b>comparative</b> <b>studies,</b> {{have occurred in}} the last two decades, particularly after the interventions (by e. g. S. Bassnett, G. C. Spivak) claiming a "death" of the discipline. The author diagnoses the condition of <b>comparative</b> <b>studies</b> in literature, stressing non-commensurability of comparative-study projects and taking into account three currents in comparative studies: traditional (19 th-century heritage); interdisciplinary (interdisciplinary <b>comparative</b> <b>studies</b> existing since late 1960 s/early 1970 s); and, cultural (cultural <b>comparative</b> <b>studies</b> developed since late 1980 s/early 1990 s). Regardless of how one may approach the enormous tradition of <b>comparative</b> <b>studies,</b> departure from what once was ethno-/eurocentrism appears to be the distinguishing mark of the new paradigm: cultural <b>comparative</b> <b>studies.</b> The author argues in the first place that cultural <b>comparative</b> <b>studies</b> - being a modern form of literary studies - are a nomadic discipline. The suggestion is that the modern <b>comparative</b> <b>studies</b> be approached not as a constantly extending domain of issues and limitless expansion, but rather as an effect of thinking which enables us in today’s world - if Armando Gnisci’s metaphor is acceptable here - to "decolonise ourselves"; as an interpretative practice deeply founded in daily existence...|$|R

40|$|Systematic reviews that "compare" the {{accuracy}} of 2 or more tests often include different sets of studies for each test. To investigate the availability of direct <b>comparative</b> <b>studies</b> of test accuracy and to assess whether summary estimates of accuracy differ between meta-analyses of noncomparative and <b>comparative</b> <b>studies.</b> Systematic reviews in any language from the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from 1994 to October 2012. 1 of 2 assessors selected reviews that evaluated at least 2 tests and identified meta-analyses that included both noncomparative <b>studies</b> and <b>comparative</b> <b>studies.</b> 1 of 3 assessors extracted data about review and study characteristics and test performance. 248 reviews compared test accuracy; of the 6915 studies, 2113 (31 %) were comparative. Thirty-six reviews (with 52 meta-analyses) had adequate studies to compare results of noncomparative and <b>comparative</b> <b>studies</b> by using a hierarchical summary receiver-operating characteristic meta-regression model for each test comparison. In 10 meta-analyses, noncomparative studies ranked tests in the opposite order of <b>comparative</b> <b>studies.</b> A total of 25 meta-analyses showed more than a 2 -fold discrepancy in the relative diagnostic odds ratio between noncomparative and <b>comparative</b> <b>studies.</b> Differences in accuracy estimates between noncomparative and <b>comparative</b> <b>studies</b> were greater than expected by chance (P < 0. 001). A paucity of <b>comparative</b> <b>studies</b> limited exploration of direction in bias. Evidence derived from noncomparative studies often differs from that derived from <b>comparative</b> <b>studies.</b> Robustly designed studies in which all patients receive all tests or are randomly assigned to receive one or other of the tests should be more routinely undertaken and are preferred for evidence to guide test selection.

5|$|Biogeography (an {{amalgamation}} {{of biology}} and geography) is the <b>comparative</b> <b>study</b> of the geographic distribution of organisms {{and the corresponding}} evolution of their traits in space and time. The Journal of Biogeography was established in 1974. Biogeography and ecology share many of their disciplinary roots. For example, the theory of island biogeography, published by the Robert MacArthur and Edward O. Wilson in 1967 {{is considered one of}} the fundamentals of ecological theory.|$|E

40|$|Large-scale, <b>comparative</b> <b>studies</b> {{of species}} {{extinction}} risk have become common in conservation science, but {{their influence on}} conservation practice appears limited. The link between such studies {{and the practice of}} conservation breaks down in two key places. First, results of <b>comparative</b> <b>studies</b> are often ambiguous, inconsistent and difficult to translate into policy. Second, conservation as currently practiced emphasizes the rescue and protection of currently threatened biodiversity, whereas <b>comparative</b> <b>studies</b> are often better suited to a proactive approach that anticipates and prevents future species declines. Scientists should make their research more accessible by addressing the first issue. Policymakers and managers, in turn, could make better use of <b>comparative</b> <b>studies</b> by moving towards more preventative approaches to conservation planning...|$|R
