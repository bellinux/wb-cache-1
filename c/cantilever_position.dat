40|$|Thermal {{fluctuation}} of the <b>cantilever</b> <b>position</b> sets {{a fundamental}} limit for {{the precision of}} any Scanning Force Microscope. In the present work we analyse how these fluctuations limit {{the determination of the}} resonance frequency of the tip-sample system. The basic principles of frequency detection in Dynamic Scanning Force Microscopy are revised and the precise response of a typical frequency detection unit to thermal fluctuation of the cantilever is analysed in detail. A general relation for thermal frequency noise is found as a function of measurement bandwidth and cantilever oscillation. For large oscillation amplitude and low bandwidth, this relation converges to the result known from the literature, while for low oscillation amplitude and large bandwidth we find that the thermal frequency noise is equal to the width of the resonance curve and therefore stays finite, contrary to what is predicted by the relation known so far. The results presented in this work fundamentally determine the ultimate limits of Dynamic Scanning Force Microscopy. Comment: 24 pages, 5 figure...|$|E

Compared to conventional electro-magnetic shutters, the device is intrinsically low power and acoustically quiet. The <b>cantilever</b> <b>position</b> is controlled by a high-voltage op-amp circuit for easy tuning {{of the range of}} travel, and mechanical slew rate, which enables a factor of 30 reduction in mechanical noise compared to a rapidly switched device. We achieve shuttering rise and fall times of 11 μs, corresponding to mechanical slew rates of 1. 3 ms^- 1, with an timing jitter of less than 1 μs. When used to create optical pulses, we achieve minimum pulse durations of 250 μs. The reliability of the shutter was investigated by operating continuously for one week at 10 Hz switching rate. After this period, neither the shutter delay or actuation speed had changed by a notable amount.

The back action simultaneously drives a diffusion process in momentum and diagonalizes the cantilever state in the position basis. This latter result is state reduction. Explicit expressions for the rate of the measurement back action in terms of the device parameters are given. We also calculate the signal-to-noise ratio in the limit of a bad cavity.

This technique is also important for different applications, including a measurement of a qubit state in quantum computation. The measurement takes place through the interaction of a single spin with a quasi-classical cantilever, modeled by a quantum oscillator in a coherent state in a quasi-classical region of parameters. The entire system is treated rigorously within the framework of the Schrödinger equation, without any artificial assumptions. Computer simulations of the spin-cantilever dynamics, where the spin is continuously rotated by means of cyclic adiabatic inversion, show that the cantilever evolves into a Schrödinger-cat state: the probability distribution for the <b>cantilever</b> <b>position</b> develops two asymmetric peaks that quasi-periodically appear and vanish. For a many-spin system our equations reduce to the classical equations of motion, and we accurately describe conventional MRFM experiments involving cyclic adiabatic inversion of the spin system.

A major concern for composite structures in the field is the effect of foreign objects striking composites because the damage is often undetectable by visual inspection. The objective for this study was to determine the effectiveness of using dynamic testing to identify the existence of damage in a small scale composite wing design. Four different impact locations were tested with three specimens per location for a total of 12 wings manufactured. The different impact locations were over the skin, directly over the rib/spar intersection at the mid-span of the wing, directly over the middle rib, and directly over the leading edge spar. The results will be compared to a control group of wings that sustain no damage. The wing design was based on an existing model located in the Cal Poly Aerospace Composites/Structures lab. The airfoil selected was a NACA 2412 airfoil profile with a chord length of 3 inches and a wingspan of just over 8 inches. All parts cured for 7 hours at 148 °F and 70 psi.

So far, however, high-speed {{atomic force microscopy}} was restricted to well-controlled molecular systems of purified proteins. Here we integrate an optical microscopy path into high-speed atomic force microscopy, allowing bright field and fluorescence microscopy, without loss of high-speed atomic force microscopy performance. This hybrid high-speed atomic force microscopy/optical microscopy setup allows positioning of the high-speed atomic force microscopy tip with high spatial precision on an optically identified zone of interest on cells. We present movies at 960 ms per frame displaying aquaporin- 0 array and single molecule dynamics in the plasma membrane of intact eye lens cells. This hybrid setup allows high-speed atomic force microscopy imaging on cells about 1, 000 times faster than conventional atomic force microscopy/optical microscopy setups, and allows first time visualization of unlabelled membrane proteins on a eukaryotic cell under physiological conditions. This development advances high-speed atomic force microscopy from molecular to cell biology to analyse cellular processes at the membrane such as signalling, infection, transport and diffusion. H igh-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM) 1 has been proven to be a unique and powerful tool for the concomitant analysis of the structure and dynamics of single biomolecules 2. HS-AFM was used to visualize myosin-V walking 3, cellulase cellulose degradation 4, F 1 -ATPase rotary catalysis 5, bacteriorhodopsin photocycle 6, and OmpF diffusion and interaction 7. However, HS-AFM has been restricted so far to well-controlled molecular systems of purified proteins under well-controlled conditions. These systems were characterized by a limited number of pure molecular species with small corrugation, mainly because the fast z-piezo that follows the topography profile has a small extension range (typically 400 nm; ref. 8). Recently, the development of a wide-range HS-AFM scanner allowed the first nanoscale observation of molecular movements at two frames per second on living bacteria 9. Historically, AFM debuted as early as 1990 for cell imaging applications 10, prompted by the need to perform cell structural analysis at a resolution superior to light microscopy. However, AFM images of cells revealed rather the cell interior, like actin filaments, than the membrane structure of the cells. Later, AFM and optical microscopy (OM) were combined in order to take advantage of OM's large-scale overview imaging capacities and its power to analyse fluorescence signal targets of proteins of interest 11. For this purpose, AFMs were built in a table-top configuration and mounted on inverted optical microscopes 12. In order to avoid modifications of the conventional inverted OM, two types of table-top AFM configurations were built. In one of them, the AFM tip and the scanner is combined into a single moving component, and in the other a large optical microscope sample stage on which the AFM sample is mounted needs to be moved. In both cases, there is a loss of AFM performance. In the tip-scanner configuration, the laser detection must be coupled to the moving cantilever, while for the second case, the sample stage that needs to be moved is complex and heavy. Both types of structures are prone to capture environmental noise and feature innate resonance frequencies. Furthermore, massive objects do not allow sub-millisecond mechanical response, thus precluding individual protein imaging at high resolution and high speed. In this work, we integrate an OM path into our HS-AFM, maintaining the structure of the HS-AFM setup 1, and hence not compromising HS-AFM performance in terms of speed and resolution. To achieve this, we choose a completely different approach compared with most (if not all) AFM/OM integration developments: instead of building a table-top AFM mountable on an inverted optical microscope, accepting loss of AFM performance, we build an optical path into our HS-AFM setup, accepting minimal trade-offs in OM performance. We show that our setup can acquire bright field and fluorescence OM images of biological samples, and that it allows HS-AFM tip positioning with high precision guided by OM. Finally, we show that it achieves HS-AFM imaging of individual membrane proteins on eukaryotic cells and record their dynamics at an imaging rate of 960 ms per frame. This accomplishment opens the door {{to a wide range of}} real-time studies of molecular dynamics in membrane processes on living cells.

5000|$|Many {{commercial}} AFM cantilever tips have pre-measured resonant {{frequencies and}} force constants which are {{provided to the}} customer.

Sampling in contact mode relies upon intermolecular forces between the tip and surface as depicted by Van der Waals force. As the sampling begins, the tip is moved close to the sample which creates a weakly attractive force between them. Another force which is often present in contact mode is capillary force due to hydration on the sample surface. This force is due to the ability of the water to contact the tip, thus creating an undesirable attractive force.

We analyze the transmission properties of this system and the dependence of interference fringe visibility on the cantilever-dot coupling and on the mechanical properties of the cantilever. The fringes are progressively destroyed as the interaction with the cantilever is turned up, in part due to dephasing arising from the entanglement of the electron and cantilever states and also due to the thermal smearing that results from fluctuations {{in the state of the}} cantilever. When the dwell time of the electron on the dot is comparable to or longer than the cantilever period, we find coherent features in the transmission amplitude. These features are washed out when the cantilever is decohered by its coupling to the environment. Comment: 38 pages, 7 figure...|$|R

40|$|Great {{progress}} has been made in both micromechanical resonators and micro-optical resonators over the past decade, and a new field has recently emerged combining these mechanical and optical systems. In such optomechanical systems, the two resonators are strongly coupled with one influencing the other, and their interaction can yield detectable optical signals that are highly sensitive to the mechanical motion. A particularly high-Q optical system is the whispering gallery mode (WGM) resonator, which has many applications ranging from stable oscillators to inertial sensor devices. There is, however, limited coupling between the optical mode and the resonator s external environment. In order to overcome this limitation, a novel type of optomechanical sensor has been developed, offering great potential for measurements of displacement, acceleration, and mass sensitivity. The proposed hybrid device combines the advantages of all-solid optical WGM resonators with high-quality micro-machined cantilevers. For direct access to the WGM inside the resonator, the idea is to radially cut precise gaps into the perimeter, fabricating a mechanical resonator within the WGM. Also, a strategy to reduce losses has been developed with optimized design of the <b>cantilever</b> geometry and <b>positions</b> of gap surfaces...|$|R
40|$|April 15, 2005 the new {{concert hall}} for symphonic music, Casa da Música in Porto, Portugal, has been inaugurated. The {{architectural}} {{concept of a}} transparent shoebox-shaped hall in combination with program requirements challenged the acoustics in many ways. By just pressing a button the acoustics of the hall is changed from excellent for symphonic music to adequate for amplified productions. All kind of technical provisions have been introduced in the design: lighting bridges, movable canopy, acoustic curtains, a moving bridge etc. In fact we believe {{a new type of}} multifunctional halls has been built. Will this be the future and, if so, what are the consequences for the field of acoustics? The main auditorium, with a capacity of 1250 seats, has a transparent vertically movable and <b>cantilever</b> canopy. Canopy <b>positions</b> have been studied to optimize the support on the stage with respect to the playing ensemble. QRD diffusers have been applied to create a diffuse and equally distributed sound field. Because of architectural issues the standard 734 diffusers have been modified. Instead of the 0 - deep well in the sequence 0 – 1 – 4 – 2 – 2 – 4 – 1, a 7 –deep well is used. This modification proved {{to have an impact on}} the acoustic performance of the diffusers, thus the acoustics of the hall...|$|R
50|$|In some configurations, the piezo {{components}} can {{be arranged}} in a tripod design. In this type of set-up, the x, y and z components are arranged orthogonally to one another with their apex attached to a movable pivot point. Similar to the cylindrical piezo, in the tripod design the voltage {{is applied to the}} piezo corresponding to the appropriate direction of tip displacement. In this type of set-up the sample and substrate are mounted on top of the z-piezo component. When the x and y piezo components are in use, the orthogonal design causes them to push against the base of the z-piezo, causing the z-piezo to rotate about a fixed point. Applying voltage to the z-piezo causes the tube to move up and down on its pivot point. The other essential components of AFM instrumentation include the AFM tip module, which includes: the AFM tip, the cantilever, and the guiding laser.When the piezo-tube is <b>positioned</b> above the <b>cantilever</b> and tip, the guiding laser is focused through the tube and onto a mirror that rests on tip of the cantilever. The guiding laser is reflected off of the mirror and detected by a photodetector. The laser senses when the forces acting on the tip change. The reflected laser beam from this phenomenon reaches the detector. The output from this detector acts {{as a response to the}} changes in force and the <b>cantilever</b> adjusts the <b>position</b> of the tip, while keeping constant the force that acts on the tip.|$|R
