5|$|The United States is {{a melting}} pot {{consisting}} of numerous ethnic groups. Many of these peoples have kept alive the folk traditions of their homeland, often producing distinctively American styles of foreign music. Some nationalities have produced local scenes in {{regions of the country}} where they have clustered, like <b>Cape</b> <b>Verdean</b> music in New England, Armenian music in California, and Italian and Ukrainian music in New York City.|$|E

Brazilian artists have been presented with the award {{more than any other}} nationality, though it has been presented to musicians or groups from the United States three times, from India twice, and from France, Ireland, Mali and Panama once. <b>Cape</b> <b>Verdean</b> singer Cesária Évora, Gipsy Kings, and sitarist Anoushka Shankar share the record for the most nominations, with five each (none have yet won the award).|$|E
50|$|Sodade {{describes}} {{with great}} simplicity the nostalgia experienced by <b>Cape</b> <b>Verdeans</b> emigrants' {{who have been}} seafarers and emigrants for centuries. <b>Cape</b> <b>Verdeans</b> have been voluntarily migrating from Cape Verde to every continent, since as early 1800s. The earliest recorded migration of <b>Cape</b> <b>Verdeans</b> was to New England, because they were recruited as whalers for their exceptional seafaring skills as whalers and whale captains. This started the trend of voluntary immigration of <b>Cape</b> <b>Verdeans</b> to New England, as well as opened doors for future migration during periods of drought and following independence from Portugal.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Cape</b> <b>Verdeans</b> {{suffered}} discrimination {{when they}} came to America. <b>Cape</b> <b>Verdeans</b> retained a unique culture apart from the groups of Afro Americans who were the descendants of slaves in the United States. This was especially true for those who settled outside the Cape Verde environments concentrated in New England, and settled in the Midwest. Due to their Catholic religion, most <b>Cape</b> <b>Verdeans</b> were related to other Catholics, who were mostly white. The <b>Cape</b> <b>Verdeans</b> maintained their own ethnic identity and lived in separate communities from other Afro American groups. However, during the civil rights struggles of the 60s, the <b>Cape</b> <b>Verdeans</b> saw similarities between their own struggle and that of African Americans and emerged a sense of solidarity with them. While being the direct descendents of European Moors, some islands also have a heavy European descendent population. Most <b>Cape</b> <b>Verdeans</b> have African ancestry mixed with European and Moorish Jews. Because later {{people from all over the}} world settled in Cape Verde, not only Europeans, the population is one of the most unusual ethnic melting pots in the world. Due to this uniqueness, most <b>Cape</b> <b>Verdeans</b> choose to cite [...] "Cape Verdean" [...] as their race, which not only reflects a strong sense of Patriotism, but a sense of community that is only found among <b>Cape</b> <b>Verdeans</b> regardless of skin-tone.|$|R
5000|$|Many <b>Cape</b> <b>Verdeans</b> {{moved to}} Mozambique as {{intermediary}} officials during the Portuguese colonial period. After independence in 1975, some {{remained in the}} country. In 1995, there was an estimated 500 <b>Cape</b> <b>Verdeans</b> living in the country.|$|R
5|$|As late as 1795, the {{population}} of Massachusetts was nearly 95% of English ancestry. During the early and mid 19th century, immigrant groups began arriving in Massachusetts in large numbers; first from Ireland in the 1840s; today the Irish and part-Irish are the largest ancestry group in the state at nearly 25% of the total population. Others arrived later from Quebec as well as places in Europe such as Italy, Portugal, and Poland. In the early 20th century, a number of African Americans migrated to Massachusetts, although in somewhat fewer numbers than many other Northern states. Later in the 20th century, immigration from Latin America increased considerably. Over 156,000 Chinese Americans made their home in Massachusetts in 2014, and Boston hosts a growing Chinatown accommodating heavily traveled Chinese-owned bus lines to and from Chinatown, Manhattan in New York City. Massachusetts also has large Puerto Rican, Dominican, Haitian, <b>Cape</b> <b>Verdean</b> and Brazilian populations. Boston's South End and Jamaica Plain are both gay villages, as is nearby Provincetown, Massachusetts on Cape Cod.|$|E

25|$|The best {{internationally known}} morna singer was Cesária Évora.

5000|$|In 1995, it was {{estimated}} that there were 8,000 <b>Cape</b> <b>Verdeans</b> in France. [...] The 1999 census counted 21,000 descendants. [...] In 2007, the embassy in Paris had 17,544 registered <b>Cape</b> <b>Verdeans.</b> However, that number only includes those who are documented and registered. There are many who are undocumented or who choose not to register with the embassy. Additionally, tabulating is difficult because many <b>Cape</b> <b>Verdeans</b> arrived in France with passports from other host countries, like Portugal or the Netherlands. Thus, taking all these factors into consideration, the embassy estimates that there are about 25,000 <b>Cape</b> <b>Verdeans</b> and their descendants currently residing in France.|$|R
50|$|<b>Cape</b> <b>Verdeans</b> began {{arriving}} in France in 1964, from Rotterdam, Dakar, and Lisbon. They took {{jobs in the}} coals mines, in the iron foundries, and as masons.

50|$|<b>Cape</b> <b>Verdeans,</b> {{also called}} Cabo Verdeans (cabo-verdiano), are the {{citizens}} of Cape Verde.

25|$|Cape Verde is 97% Christian and its {{background}} is {{a fusion of}} African, Asian, European and South American backgrounds, where about 70% is African and mixed. Less than 30% is African, whereas about 1% is of unmixed European descent. Because of this, <b>Cape</b> <b>Verdeans</b> {{find it hard to}} define themselves as either mixed or Africans. They regard themselves as either both or as unique <b>Cape</b> <b>Verdeans.</b> Politically, <b>Cape</b> <b>Verdeans</b> also worked as part of the Portuguese administration, with independence leader Amílcar Cabral being part of the colonial administration in Guinea-Bissau and Angola.|$|R

40|$|A 15 th-century Portuguese {{colony and}} slave {{entrepot}} established on for-merly uninhabited islands, Cape Verde has been deeply creolized and transnational from its origin. 1 By {{at least the}} 18 th century during the colonial period, long before political independence was finally achieved in 1975, <b>Cape</b> <b>Verdeans</b> moved increasingly within the circuit of a broader Atlantic diaspora, linking Europe, Africa, and the Americas, movements that have finally resul-ted in today’s deterritorialized transnation. By the late 20 th century most <b>Cape</b> <b>Verdeans</b> resided outside the archipelago in the diaspora. Today’s population estimates are that less than one half of all <b>Cape</b> <b>Verdeans,</b> and perhaps only a third – about 350, 000 to 400, 000 – live in the archipelago.

5000|$|One of {{the major}} forces that brought <b>Cape</b> <b>Verdeans</b> to the Americas was the whaling industry. American whalers from New Bedford first began {{travelling}} to the islands in the 1790s, and further developed their trade as time progressed into the 19th century. During this time, many <b>Cape</b> <b>Verdeans</b> joined American whaling crews in order to escape Cape Verde, a land plagued with poor natural resources and an often abusive Portuguese colonial government. By the mid-1800s New Bedford had transformed into an economic maritime center, where <b>Cape</b> <b>Verdeans</b> were not only about to excel in the whaling industry but in other maritime industries (such as fishing) as well. New Bedford Whaling Museum explains, “As the 20th century went on and the ties between the islands and the port strengthened, entrepreneurs like Roy Teixeira, Henrique Mendes, Louis Lopes, Frank Lopes and Antonio Cardoza purchased, managed and owned packet ships like the Coriolanus, the Savoia, and the Arcturus... Importantly, not only did <b>Cape</b> <b>Verdeans</b> settle in New Bedford, but between 1860 and 1965 41% of the packets trading between New England and the Islands were owned by Cape Verdeans.” ...|$|R
