A 6 -month performance verification (PV) phase ended in March 2016, and the instrument is now in the general observing phase. UVIT operates in three channels: visible, near-ultraviolet (NUV) and far-ultraviolet (FUV), each with a choice of broad and narrow band filters, and has NUV and FUV gratings for low-resolution spectroscopy. We have written a software package (JUDE) to convert the Level 1 data from UVIT into scientifically useful photon lists and images.

40|$|In {{evaluating}} the operational {{performance of the}} department‚Äôs web site for the period between 2006 and 2013, {{we found that the}} total number of page accesses peaked in 2010 and subsequently trended downward. We also noted that the ratio of applicants to places was unaffected by this downward trend, and that, based on a questionnaire given to freshman classes, 25 % of incoming freshman had used the web site to collect information about our department. These findings led us to conclude that the content of the web site is sufficient to attract prospective students‚Äô interest and that our renewal should preserve most of this content, while introducing state-of-the-art web technologies (i. e., HTML 5 and CSS 3).
