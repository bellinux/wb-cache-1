500|$|Charles Monselet, in Le Monde Illustré, praised Taillade and the [...] "curious" [...] {{nature of}} the voyages, but found the play as a whole tiresome. On the other hand, two other major {{illustrated}} journals, L'Illustration and L'Univers Illustré, greeted the play with wholly positive reviews, particularly lauding the spectacular staging. Auguste Vitu gave the play a largely positive review, praising the actors, the decor, {{and the use of}} Verne's ideas, but expressed doubts about the wisdom of combining so many disparate styles—dramatic realism, scientific fiction, and pure fantasy—in one production. Anonymous reviewers in the Revue politique et littéraire and the Revue Britannique, as well as [...] in Le <b>Correspondant</b> and Arthur Heulhard in the Chronique de l'Art, all wrote similarly mixed reviews, speaking highly of the actors and of Verne's characters and concepts but saying that d'Ennery's dramatizations and revisions were clumsy. In his 1910 history of the féerie, Paul Ginisty hailed Journey Through the Impossible for introducing a [...] "scientific element" [...] to the genre and for bringing characters from Verne's books to the stage, but sharply criticized d'Ennery for putting [...] "furiously outdated" [...] sentiments in the mouth of the character Volsius.|$|E
500|$|The colonial {{high society}} of Antananarivo showcased Rabearivelo's work as {{evidence}} {{of the success of the}} French assimilation policy and the beneficial effects of colonialism in Africa. In his journals, the poet wrote that he felt [...] "used" [...] by the French authorities in Madagascar. Governor Montagné awarded him an affiliation (membre <b>correspondant)</b> with the Académie Malgache in 1932. But in 1937, Rabearivelo's trust in the assimilation messages and gestures of Antananarivo's colonial high society was betrayed. He was imprisoned for three days for failing to pay taxes, a penalty from which he should have been exempted due to his status as a low-ranking employee of the colonial administration. He had also been promised that he would represent Madagascar at the 1937 Universal Exposition in Paris, but in May 1937 the colonial authorities informed him that he would not be part of the island's delegation. Consequently, Rabearivelo became embittered toward France and its colonial message of assimilation, a sentiment strongly expressed in his journals. He was likewise rejected by Malagasy high society, who condemned his unconventional behavior and views, particularly in light of his role as husband and father. His compatriots also held him in contempt for his perceived eagerness to embrace the French colonial rule and culture.|$|E
2500|$|In October, on {{his return}} to Roye, he founded the <b>Correspondant</b> Picard, a {{political}} journal that would have 40 issues. Babeuf used his journal to agitate for a progressive taxation system, and condemned the [...] "census suffrage" [...] planned for the 1791 elections to the Legislative Assembly in which citizen votes would be weighted by their social standing. Due to his political activities, he was arrested on 19 May 1790, but released in July before the Fête de la Fédération, thanks to pressure exerted nationally by Jean-Paul Marat. In November Babeuf was elected {{a member of the}} municipality of Roye, but was expelled.|$|E

2500|$|Resuming his {{undergraduate}} studies, Lucas won a Chancellor's Medal for Classics and the Browne Medal (1920), and revived {{meetings of}} the Apostles, suspended since 1914, becoming Society Secretary and contributing nineteen papers. He was elected to a Fellowship at King's College in 1920 before he had completed his degree, Keynes paying for him to holiday in Greece with Sebastian Sprott {{on the eve of}} his Tripos. He took a starred first, beginning his career as a Classics lecturer in October 1920. In the spring of 1921 he spent three months in Greece as a student of the British School at Athens, researching the site of the Battle of Pharsalus in Thessaly (see Pharsalus below). Back in Cambridge he switched that year to teaching for the English Tripos (instituted in 1919). He was a member of the Cambridge University English Faculty from 1921–1939 and from 1945–1962. He was a University Reader in English from 1947–1962. His move from Classics to English and his edition of Webster were inspired in large part by Sheppard's March 1920 Marlowe Society production of The White Devil, which made a powerful impression on him: [...] "What could make the Cambridge production of The White Devil in 1920 seem, to at least two who saw it then without preconceptions, the most staggering performance they had ever known?" [...] " [...] has been lucky in finding a writer [...] who takes his standpoint," [...] T. E. Lawrence remarked, [...] "and sums up life rather in his fashion." [...] Lucas's preference, however, lay with Comparative Literature, and after Webster he turned to his Studies French and English (1934; revised 1950) (he was Membre <b>Correspondant</b> Honoraire de L'Institut Littéraire et Artistique de France [...] ). He served as committee member for the Cambridge Greek Play (1921–33). As part-time Librarian at King's (1922–36) he accessioned the donated papers of Rupert Brooke. His students at King's included George Rylands, John Hayward, F. E. Halliday, H. C. A. [...] "Tom" [...] Gaunt, Alan Clutton-Brock, Julian Bell, Winton Dean and Desmond Flower. At the invitation of its literary editor, Desmond MacCarthy, he reviewed poetry and criticism for the New Statesman from 1922 to 1926, having begun his career as reviewer with the Athenaeum in 1920–21, its last year.|$|E
