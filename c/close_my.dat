25|$|In 1820, Godwin {{published}} Of Population: An Enquiry Concerning the Power of Increase in the Numbers of Mankind as a rebuttal to Malthus' essays. Godwin's main {{argument was}} against Malthus' notion that population tends to grow exponentially. Godwin believed that for population to double every twenty-five years (as Malthus had asserted {{had occurred in}} the United States, due to the expanse of resources available there), every married couple {{would have to have}} at least eight children, given the rate of childhood deaths. Godwin himself was one of thirteen children, but he did not observe the majority of couples in his day having eight children. He therefore concluded:In reality, if I had not taken up the pen with the express purpose of confuting all the errors of Mr Malthus’s book, and of endeavouring to introduce other principles, more cheering, more favourable to the best interests of mankind, and better prepared to resist the inroads of vice and misery, I might <b>close</b> <b>my</b> argument here, and lay down the pen with this brief remark, that, when this author shall have produced from any country, the United States of North America not excepted, a register of marriages and births, from which it shall appear that there are on an average eight births to a marriage, then, and not till then, can I have any just reason to admit his doctrine of the geometrical ratio.|$|E

500|$|Present {{throughout}} the songs background {{is the use}} of violins and a choir, as well as guitar, string instruments, congas and a cajon. [...] However it does make subtle use of synths and electronic sounds. Musically and lyrically, it is influenced by Contemporary Christian music, and has a gospel feel, while including standard pop and R. The song opens with Bieber singing, [...] "And I pray" [...] over a keyboard, while the song's chorus repeats one simple refrain, [...] "I <b>close</b> <b>my</b> eyes and I can see a better day/ I <b>close</b> <b>my</b> eyes and pray." [...] In the lyrics, Bieber [...] "recognizes the pain and suffering in the world" [...] and then offers [...] "a passive solution" [...] through lines such as [...] "Children are crying / soldiers are dying / Some people don't have a home," [...] before compromising, [...] "I know there's sunshine beyond that rain / good times beyond that pain." [...] Vocally, Bieber's vocals are sung in a lower key compared to previous singles.|$|E
500|$|... "Die Another Day" [...] is an electroclash number, {{starting}} with strings which continues for eleven seconds, when Madonna's vocals {{starts with the}} lines [...] "I'm gonna keep this secret / I'm gonna <b>close</b> <b>my</b> body now..." [...] It follows with the stuttered editing on her voice, which keeps cutting the main signal, especially on the chorus [...] "I guess.. I would die... another day". The strings again gain prominence at around the 2:20 mark. During the intermediate verse, a [...] "raucous" [...] laugh by Madonna can be heard. The song ends with interpolating electronic swirls and the orchestra fading out. Sterling Clover from The Village Voice explained that the ending recalled the snare drums and bass usage in songs of the microhouse genre, describing it as [...] "cacophony of harmonic fragments". According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com, the song {{is set in the}} time signature of common time with a fast tempo of 130 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of E major with Madonna's voice spanning from the notes B3 to D5.|$|E
500|$|Saadiq {{has said}} of his {{creative}} intentions with the follow-up, [...] "I’ve never shut my ears to anything, really. It’s not like I’m always looking for things, either, but I can’t <b>close</b> <b>my</b> ears to any music. Any guitar, any drums, any rhythm section— I’ve always been open to those things, {{trying to understand what}} makes them work in a song". He was influenced by early rock and roll artists such as Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley, and has cited blues musician Howlin' Wolf as an influence on the album's sound, which he described as [...] "bluesy" [...] and [...] "harder" [...] than that of his previous album, with more aggressive tempos. In an interview for BULLETT Magazine, Saadiq explained his idea of the album's title, stating [...] "Stone Rollin basically symbolizes the action of throwing dice and taking chances with life. That's what I've done my whole career—taking chances with different styles of music and making choices that other people would be afraid to take. Stone Rollin means I'm going all the way out there this time".|$|E

500|$|... "In the Dark" [...] is a dance-pop {{song that}} {{features}} a house rhythm and a prominent saxophone riff {{that serves as the}} song's instrumentation. Critics compared the riff to [...] "Mr. Saxobeat" [...] (2011) by Romanian singer Alexandra Stan. [...] "In the Dark" [...] opens with Dev's sing-talk vocal style as she sings [...] "On my waist, through my hair / Think about it when you touch me there / <b>Close</b> <b>my</b> eyes, here you are dance-dance-dancing in the dark." [...] According to Nadine Cheung of AOL Radio, the line borrows the melody from Reel 2 Real's [...] "I Like to Move It" [...] (1994). [...] "In the Dark" [...] sees Dev using her singing voice more than her distinctive sing-talk style. Lyrically, the song speaks of sex drives and letting sensation of touch fully taking over from sight, as Dev repeats the line, [...] "I got a sex drive that's push to start". According to sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Hal Leonard Corporation, [...] "In the Dark" [...] is written in the time signature of common time and set in a moderately fast tempo of 120 beats per minute. It is written in the key of C minor and Dev's vocals span from the note of A4 to the note of B5. It has a basic sequence of Cm–E6–A5–G5 as its chord progression.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{response}} to Necrid varied. University of Delaware professor Rachel Hutchinson cited {{him as an}} example of the cultural stereotype of human versus monster, a [...] "mutated or damned [...] deviant from the human norm" [...] that the game's human characters are expected to vanquish. A staff writer for GameNOW magazine called the visual design [...] "silly" [...] and compared the character to an [...] "old-school He-Man character", but added that Necrid's gameplay was decent. Another magazine, GMR, described him {{as an example of}} [...] "bad American comic book design". IGN's Kaiser Hwang called Necrid a [...] "disappointment" [...] and questioned the character's design in comparison to others in the series; he also felt Necrid was [...] "filler" [...] rather than a complete character. GameSpot made similar comments in their review of the game, as did GameSpy. IGN's Xbox article editor described the character's inclusion as an unnecessary marketing ploy and would have preferred new characters made without McFarlane's involvement; the editor also wrote that Necrid did not [...] "vibe" [...] with the rest of the game. 1UP.com's podcast Retronauts criticized the design and wrote that the character's name was used as a synonym for [...] "shitty". They further added that McFarlane had [...] "tainted" [...] the game with Necrid's inclusion, with host Jeremy Parish stating [...] "I could <b>close</b> <b>my</b> eyes and draw a better character". In a retrospective of the series, Joystiq used him {{as an example of the}} series succumbing to [...] "commercial gimmicks", citing his design as reviled and that Necrid was either too strong or too weak a character to play as, depending on who one asked.|$|E
500|$|Strong {{explained}} in Desperate Housewives: Behind Closed Doors {{that she believed}} {{there to be a}} [...] "conceptual shift" [...] after the filming of the original pilot with Lee, and [...] "they realized they needed something different", stating: [...] "There certainly wasn't something wrong with what [...] did. It was just that instead of vanilla they wanted chocolate, and I happened to be chocolate. When I walked in to audition, Marc Cherry was so sweet. He said, 'I hope you don't mind, but I'm going to <b>close</b> <b>my</b> eyes, because I really want to hear how you sound.' When I was done with the audition, {{he opened his eyes and}} this angelic smile crept across his face, and I thought, 'Oh, good. Something went right.'" [...] The actress also explained that she watched the pilot filmed with Lee and while that was helpful for her own portrayal, she saw that what she had to offer for the role was different, saying: [...] "It's a little strange when you watch someone else in a role you're auditioning for because his or her performance lives in your mind. It can be hard to distinguish yourself sometimes, but I had fun with it." [...] Scenes featuring Lee were refilmed with Strong as her replacement. Strong stated years later that her role and narration as Mary Alice led to her voice becoming significantly recognizable, explaining in a 2012 interview with Entertainment Weekly that fans of the series would recognize her in coffee shops solely by her voice. The actress served as the narrator of almost every episode of the series, with the exceptions of the third season episode [...] "My Husband, the Pig" [...] (in which Steven Culp narrates the episode as the deceased Rex Van de Kamp) and the fifth season episode [...] "Look Into Their Eyes and You See What They Know" [...] (in which Nicollette Sheridan narrates the episode as the deceased Edie Britt).|$|E

[...] Buñuel died in Mexico City in 1983. Fuentes has recounted that Buñuel spent his last week in hospital discussing theology with the Jesuit brother Julian Pablo, a long time friend. His funeral was very private. There were about 50 people at the most, among them Octavio Paz, José Luis Cuevas, Miguel Littin, {{his wife and two}} sons.|$|E

In 1960, an interview with Eichmann, made by the Dutch Nazi journalist Willem Sassen in Argentina, was published in Life Magazine. Eichmann said that Kastner [...] "agreed {{to help keep the}} Jews from resisting deportation—and even keep order in the collection camps—if I would <b>close</b> <b>my</b> eyes and let a few hundred or a few thousand young Jews emigrate to Palestine. It was a good bargain". Rudolf Vrba wrote, [...] "Kastner paid for those 1,684 lives with his silence".|$|E
