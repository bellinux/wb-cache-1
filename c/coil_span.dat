40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new method to find available slot–pole {{combination of a}} permanent magnet (PM) vernier motor with fractional-slot concentrated winding (FSCW) configurations instead of the conventional design rule. To this aim, for a common structure of PM vernier machines with FSCW, the air gap flux densities including modulation flux due to vernier effects are investigated from the magnetic view points and then a general condition to effectively use the modulation flux is derived. Under the obtained condition, the specific design condition for slot–pole combinations are established for the most popular FSCW configurations with the <b>coil</b> <b>spans</b> of ± 2 π/ 3. Using the established condition, all available vernier structures including those {{which could not be}} found by the previous rule are obtained, and the back-electromotive force (EMF) of each structure is analytically estimated to check the vernier effects. During these procedures, it is also revealed that some of general FSCW-PM motors possess vernier effects and thus can be classified into vernier motors. To verify the proposed ideas, the characteristics of back EMF are analyzed through finite element (FE) -simulations for various models, and compared with their analytical calculation results. Finally, the characteristics of torque regarding to slot–pole combinations of the vernier motors are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Intracellular active {{transport}} {{is driven by}} ATP-hydrolyzing motor proteins that move along cytoskeletal filaments. In particular, the microtubule-associated dynein motor {{is involved in the}} transport of organelles and vesicles, the maintenance of the Golgi, and mitosis. However, unlike kinesin and myosin, the mechanism by which dynein converts chemical energy into mechanical force remains largely a mystery, due primarily to the lack of a high-resolution molecular structure. Using homology modeling and normal mode analysis, we propose a complete atomic structure and a mechanism for force generation by the motor protein dynein. In agreement with very recent electron microscopy (EM) reconstructions showing dynein as a ring-shaped heptamer, our model consists of six ATPases of the AAA (ATPases associated with various cellular activities) superfamily and a C-terminal domain, which is experimentally known to control motor function. Our model shows a <b>coiled</b> <b>coil</b> <b>spanning</b> the diameter of the motor that accounts for previously unidentified structures in EM studies and provides a potential mechanism for long-range communication between the AAA domains. Furthermore, normal mode analysis reveals that the subunits of the motor that contain the nucleotide binding sites exhibit minimal movement, whereas the rest of the motor is very mobile. Our analysis suggests the likely domain rearrangements of the motor unit that generate its power stroke. This study provides insights into the structure and function of dynein that can guide further experimental investigations into energy transduction in dynein...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The mixed winding layouts {{proposed}} {{in this paper}} are obtained by combining double and triple layer (DTL) windings in stator slots. Previous work has touched upon {{on the ability of}} three-and five-phase induction machines (IMs) with mixed winding layouts to produce torque with less ripple contents. However, their advantage when operating under open-circuited faults is yet to be comprehensively reported. This paper presents the fault-tolerant ability of Fivephase Induction Machines (FPIMs) with mixed winding layouts to produce torque with less ripple contents. The windings are designed as 2 -pole and chorded with one slot, thereafter referred to as “DTL- 14 / 15 ” and when chorded with two slots, thereafter referred to as “DTL- 13 / 15. The magnetic conditions in the FPIMs are analyzed using Finite Element Method (FEM). The results evidenced that the FPIMs with the proposed DTL- 14 / 15 and DTL- 13 / 15 chorded coils reduced the torque ripple by a margin of about 60 % while operating with open-circuited faults respect to FPIMs with conventional double layer (DL) winding of the same <b>coil</b> <b>span</b> and operating under the same conditions. The results also prove that there is a great correlation between FEM (simulation) and experimental results...|$|E

The motor is a polyphase multipole square-wave PM motor, {{which can be}} classified {{as a kind of}} PM brushless dc motor. The distinct features of the proposed motor as compared with that of the conventional PM brushless dc motor lie in that: firstly, the multipole magnetic circuit arrangement enables the minimization of magnetic yoke, resulting in the reduction of motor volume and weight; secondly, the <b>coil</b> <b>span</b> is purposely designed to be equal to one slot pitch, thus saving in copper used; thirdly, by using fractional number of slots per pole per phase the arrangement of numbers of poles and slots is so unique that the magnetic force between stator and rotor at any rotating position is uniform, hence eliminating the cogging torque which usually occurs in PM motors; finally, the motor can be controlled to operate at constant torque region and constant power region with field weakening, thus both high starting torque and high cruising speed can be achieved. Therefore, as the proposed motor drive possesses distinct advantages of high power density, high efficiency and superior dynamic performance, it is very suitable for EV applications.

40|$|Purpose: To {{develop a}} calibrationless {{parallel}} imaging method combining {{the benefits of}} simultaneous estimation of coil profiles and image content of Regular ized Nonlinear Inversion (NLINV) with the robustness of ESPIRiT and evaluate it in initial experiments. Theory and Methods: Parallel imaging {{can be understood as}} recovering coil images that lie in a subspace <b>spanned</b> by the <b>coil</b> sensitivity profiles. In this view, NLINV is a blind multi-channel deconvolution problem which assumes that the <b>coil</b> profiles <b>span</b> the solution subspace. ESPIRiT gains robustness by relaxing this model, allowing multiple sets of images and coil profiles and thereby enlarging that subspace. ENLIVE follows this approach, allowing for a larger subspace while retaining the same formulation as NLINV. This can be related to a lifted formulation of blind deconvolution with nuclear-norm regularization, which inherently promotes low-rank solutions. Hence, there is a relationship to other calibrationless parallel imaging methods based on low-rank matrix completion, such as SAKE and CLEAR. Results: Reconstruction results of several undersampled parallel imaging settings show similar image quality as ESPIRiT without needing explicit calibration data. Image reconstruction time is much shorter than calibrationless parallel imaging with SAKE. Conclusion: The proposed method is suitable for calibrationless and non-Cartesian imaging, and robust in the presence of data inconsistencies.

40|$|Background: A compact {{theory that}} predicts quantitatively {{when and where}} {{magnetic}} neurostimulation will occur is needed {{as a guide to}} therapy, ideally providing a single equation that defines the target volume of tissue excited by single or dual coils. Methods: A first-principles analysis of magnetic stimulation incorporating a simplified description of electromagnetic fields and a simplified cable theory of the axon yields a mathematical synthesis predicting how to aim. Results: Nerve stimulation produced by a single circular coil having one or more closely packed turns occurs in donut shaped volume of tissue beneath the <b>coil.</b> Axons <b>spanning</b> several millimeters are the sites of magnetic stimulation. The sites of maximal transmembrane depolarization in nerve fibers correspond to points where the axons enter or exit this volume of magnetically induced voltage and current. The axonal membrane at one end is depolarized locally during the rising phase of current in the coil. The axonal membrane at the opposite end is depolarized locally during the falling phase of current in the coil. Penetration depths of several centimeters from the skin surface or approximately one to two coil radii are practical. With two coils placed in a figure-of-eight configuration the separate clockwise and counterclockwise currents generate magnetic fields that add, producing maximal stimulation of a spindle shaped volume, centered at a depth of one-third to one-half coil radius from the body surface. Conclusions: This condensed synthesis of electromagnetic theory and cable theories of axon physiology provides a partial solution to the targeting problem in peripheral and in transcranial magnetic stimulatio...|$|R
40|$|Compulsator is a {{specially}} designed generator capa¬ble of delivering high current pulses to a low-impedance load, such as the electromagnetic railgun. In order to increase the tip speed of the rotor, advanced composite materials {{have been used in}} the recent compulsator prototype, which is mentioned as air core instead of the traditional iron core. For typical air-core compulsators, there are no slots and steel teeth to place the armature windings due to the nonmachinability of composite materials. Therefore, concentric windings in racetrack style are often adopted instead of traditional lap winding in most cases, since it is more convenient to be fixed by composite materials. However, overlap occurs at the end winding part for multiphase compulsators, which are not easy to be formed during the manufacture process. In this paper, a fractional slot multiphase air-core compulsator with concentrated windings is proposed and analyzed. The main advantage of fractional slot configuration is that it can offer a concentrated winding structure under certain conditions, which means each <b>coil</b> only <b>spans</b> one “tooth,” and will not cause any intersection between each phase at the end winding. Two referenced fractional slot air-core compulsators with two phases, six poles, and four “slots” or eight “slots” (q = 1 / 3 and q = 2 / 3, q is the “slot” per pole per phase) are analyzed and compared with the performance of a traditional integral slot machine. The results indicated that the output voltage and self-excitation performance of a fractional slot compulsator can reach the same level with an integral slot one, and the discharging performance can reach an acceptable level. Thus, the fractional slot multiphase concept can be further used to improve the manufacture process of the winding in the future...|$|R
40|$|Novel {{permanent}} magnet (PM) motor drives {{have been successfully}} developed to fulfil the special requirements for electric vehicles such as high power density, high efficiency, high starting torque, and high cruising speed. These PM motors are all brushless and consist of various types, namely rectangular-fed, sinusoidal-fed, surface-magnet, buried-magnet, and hybrid. The advent of novel motor configurations lies on the unique electro-magnetic topology, including the concept of multipole magnetic circuit and full slot-pitch <b>coil</b> <b>span</b> arrangements, leading {{to a reduction in}} both magnetic yoke and copper, decoupling of each phase flux path, and hence an increase in both power density and efficiency. Moreover, with the use of fractional number of slots per pole per phase, the cogging torque can be eliminated. On the other hand, by employing the claw-type rotor structure and fixing an additional field winding as the inner stator, these PM hybrid motors can further provide excellent controllability and improve efficiency map. In the PM motors, by purposely making use of the transformer EMF to prevent the current regulator from saturation, a novel control approach is developed to allow for attaining high-speed constant-power operation which is particularly essential for electric vehicles during cruising. Their design philosophy, control strategy, theoretical analysis, computer simulation, experimental tests and application to electric vehicles are described. © 1996 IEEE. published_or_final_versio...|$|E
