5|$|Linezolid is a weak {{monoamine oxidase}} {{inhibitor}} (MAOI), {{and should not}} be used <b>concomitantly</b> with other MAOIs, large amounts of tyramine-rich foods (such as pork, aged cheeses, alcoholic beverages, or smoked and pickled foods), or serotonergic drugs. There have been postmarketing reports of serotonin syndrome when linezolid was given with or soon after the discontinuation of serotonergic drugs, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors such as paroxetine and sertraline. It may also enhance the blood pressure-increasing effects of sympathomimetic drugs such as pseudoephedrine or phenylpropanolamine. It should also not be given in combination with pethidine (meperidine) under any circumstance due to the risk of serotonin syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Sitta przewalskii {{is not yet}} {{treated as}} an {{independent}} species by BirdLife International or the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), and its threat level is not evaluated by either. Despite being described as rare in China and Southeast Tibet, because the taxon is treated instead as a subspecies of S. leucopsis, the evaluation of its population incorporates the relative abundance of its parent species. <b>Concomitantly,</b> it takes on its parent category of least concern. As S. przewalskii has not been extensively studied independently from S. leucopsis, a classification of data deficient could be applied, but the rarity of sightings indicates concern for its status; a finding of near threatened or even classification as a vulnerable species may be warranted.|$|E

25|$|Published {{case reports}} {{have stated that}} the use of benzodiazepines and {{clozapine}} <b>concomitantly</b> can result in severe adverse reaction such as respiratory arrest, cardiac arrest and sudden death.|$|E
25|$|The {{concomitant}} {{administration of}} a {{non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug}} (NSAID) with a quinolone, including norfloxacin, may {{increase the risk of}} CNS stimulation and convulsive seizures. Therefore, norfloxacin should be used with caution in individuals receiving NSAIDS <b>concomitantly.</b>|$|E
25|$|Elevated serum {{levels of}} {{cyclosporine}} {{have been reported}} with concomitant use of cyclosporine with norfloxacin. Therefore, cyclosporine serum levels should be monitored and appropriate cyclosporine dosage adjustments made when these drugs are used <b>concomitantly.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Concomitantly</b> while {{attending}} Royal College of Art in London, Schumacher {{was a master}} student {{under the tutelage of}} Prof. Georg Baselitz at Berlin University of the Arts, where she was awarded a Master of Advanced Studies degree in 2002.|$|E
25|$|There {{are various}} {{expansions}} or additional techniques {{that can be}} applied in IVF, which are usually not necessary for the IVF procedure itself, but would be virtually impossible or technically difficult to perform without <b>concomitantly</b> performing methods of IVF.|$|E
25|$|If {{diazepam}} {{is administered}} <b>concomitantly</b> with other drugs, {{attention should be}} paid to the possible pharmacological interactions. Particular care should be taken with drugs that potentiate the effects of diazepam, such as barbiturates, phenothiazines, opioids, and antidepressants.|$|E
25|$|The {{antihypertensive}} {{effects of}} methyldopa, mecamylamine, reserpine and veratrum alkaloids {{may be reduced}} by sympathomimetics. Beta-adrenergic antagonists may also interact with sympathomimetics. Increase of ectopic pacemaker activity can occur when pseudoephedrine is used <b>concomitantly</b> with digitalis. Antacids increase the rate of pseudoephedrine absorption, while kaolin decreases it.|$|E
25|$|Drug {{interactions}} with drotrecogin {{have not been}} systematically studied in patients with severe sepsis. Caution should be exercised when using other drugs that affect hemostasis <b>concomitantly</b> with drotrecogin (e.g. aspirin, warfarin, clopidogrel). However, the use of low dose prophylactic Heparin did not affect safety when given concurrently with drotrecogin.|$|E
25|$|Carr {{received}} his B.A., M.A. and Ph.D. degrees at Yale University, completing his doctorate there in 1966. At Yale he studied {{under the tutelage}} of Wilfred Sellars and Richard Bernstein. <b>Concomitantly,</b> as a graduate student, he studied at Heidelberg University under Karl Löwith, Dieter Henrich and Hans-Georg Gadamer, and at University of Paris under Paul Ricœur.|$|E
25|$|<b>Concomitantly</b> {{with the}} meeting, the Unité phone company, {{belonging}} state-owned telco Moldtelecom, announced intentions to organise a free, open air concert, immediately criticised {{as an attempt}} to undermine the protest. Under the pressure of comments on social networks, many artists, starting with Ștefan Bănică, Jr., have declined participation, which could be interpreted as a political gesture.|$|E
25|$|The {{political}} {{stature of}} Flushing Chinatown {{appears to be}} increasing significantly. Taiwan-born John Liu, former New York City Council member representing District 20, which includes Flushing Chinatown and other northern Queens neighborhoods, was elected New York City Comptroller in November 2009. <b>Concomitantly,</b> Peter Koo, born in Shanghai, China was elected to succeed Liu to assume this council membership seat.|$|E
25|$|The use of {{norfloxacin}} <b>concomitantly</b> {{has also}} been associated with transient elevations in serum creatinine in patients receiving cyclosporine, on rare occasions, resulted in severe hypoglycemia with sulfonylurea. Renal tubular transport of methotrexate may be inhibited by concomitant administration of norfloxacin, potentially leading to increased plasma levels of methotrexate. This might {{increase the risk of}} methotrexate toxic reactions.|$|E
25|$|They have a giant rosette habit, with a {{terminal}} leaf rosette {{at the apex}} of a stout woody stem. When they bloom, the flowers form a large terminal inflorescence. <b>Concomitantly,</b> two to four lateral branches are normally initiated. As a result, old plants have the appearance of candelabras the size of telephone poles, each branch with {{a terminal}} rosette.|$|E
25|$|It is {{the major}} cause of liver disease in Western countries. Although {{steatosis}} (fatty liver) will develop in any individual who consumes a large quantity of alcoholic beverages {{over a long period}} of time, this process is transient and reversible. Of all chronic heavy drinkers, only 15–20% develop hepatitis or cirrhosis, which can occur <b>concomitantly</b> or in succession.|$|E
25|$|Recently, {{the volumes}} of sexually dimorphic brain {{structures}} in transgender women {{were found to}} change and approximate typical female brain structures when exposed to estrogen <b>concomitantly</b> with androgen deprivation {{over a period of}} months, suggesting that estrogen and/or androgens have a significant part to play in sex differentiation of the brain, both prenatally and later in life.|$|E
25|$|Von Willebrand {{factor is}} mainly active in {{conditions}} of high blood flow and shear stress. Deficiency of vWF, therefore, shows primarily in organs with extensive small vessels, such as skin, gastrointestinal tract, and uterus. In angiodysplasia, {{a form of}} telangiectasia of the colon, shear stress {{is much higher than}} in average capillaries, and the risk of bleeding is increased <b>concomitantly.</b>|$|E
25|$|Currently {{there are}} efforts {{under way at}} NIOSH to help reduce the {{incidence}} of preventable disorders (e.g., sleep apnea) among heavy-truck and tractor-trailer drivers and, <b>concomitantly,</b> the life-threatening accidents to which the disorders lead, improve {{the health and safety of}} workers who are assigned to shift work or who work long hours, and {{reduce the incidence of}} falls among iron workers.|$|E
25|$|Almost all benzodiazepines are metabolised by the CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 pathway, and {{inhibition}} of these enzymes {{results in a}} higher AUC (i.e. the total effect over time of a given dose). Other examples of drugs dependent on CYP3A4 for their metabolism are escitalopram, warfarin, oxycodone, tramadol, and oxymorphone. The concentrations of these drugs may increase if they are used <b>concomitantly</b> with omeprazole.|$|E
25|$|The {{toxicity}} {{of drugs that}} are metabolised by the cytochrome P450 system is enhanced by concomitant use of some quinolones. Quinolones, including norfloxacin, may enhance the effects of oral anticoagulants, including warfarin or its derivatives or similar agents. When these products are administered <b>concomitantly,</b> prothrombin time or other suitable coagulation tests should be closely monitored. Coadministration may dangerously increase coumadin warfarin activity; INR should be monitored closely.|$|E
25|$|Atomoxetine {{has been}} found to {{directly}} inhibit hERG potassium currents with an IC50 of 6.3 μM, which has the potential to cause arrhythmia. QT prolongation has been reported with atomoxetine at therapeutic doses and in overdose; it is suggested that atomoxetine not be used with other medications that may prolong the QT interval, <b>concomitantly</b> with CYP2D6 inhibitors, and caution to be used in poor metabolizers.|$|E
25|$|Other {{contraindications}} {{include the}} administration of hydroxyzine alongside depressants and other compounds which affect the central nervous system. and if absolutely necessary, it should only be administered <b>concomitantly</b> in small doses. If administered in small doses with other substances, such as mentioned, then patients should refrain from using dangerous machinery, motor vehicles or any other practice requiring absolute concentration, in accordance with safety law.|$|E
25|$|Prior to high school, Bartlett {{attended}} schools {{both in the}} United States and in Mexico {{while his}} father undertook a study of some 350 haciendas throughout Mexico. Bartlett showed exceptional aptitude, skipping a grade in grammar school, attending college <b>concomitantly</b> while still in high school, and completing his undergraduate degree in three years, followed by a succession of scholarships and fellowships during undergraduate and graduate study.|$|E
25|$|Esomeprazole is a {{competitive}} inhibitor of the enzyme CYP2C19, and may therefore interact with drugs {{that depend on}} it for metabolism, such as diazepam and warfarin; the concentrations of these drugs may increase if they are used <b>concomitantly</b> with esomeprazole. Conversely, clopidogrel (Plavix) is an inactive prodrug that partially depends on CYP2C19 for conversion to its active form; inhibition of CYP2C19 blocks the activation of clopidogrel, thus reducing its effects.|$|E
25|$|The {{relationship}} between habitus and field is two-way. The field exists {{only insofar as}} social agents possess the dispositions and set of perceptual schemata {{that are necessary to}} constitute that field and imbue it with meaning. <b>Concomitantly,</b> by participating in the field, agents incorporate into their habitus the proper know-how {{that will allow them to}} constitute the field. Habitus manifests the structures of the field, and the field mediates between habitus and practice.|$|E
25|$|Although {{nalbuphine}} possesses {{opioid antagonist}} activity, {{there is evidence}} that in nondependent patients it will not antagonize an opioid analgesic administered just before, concurrently, or just after an injection. Therefore, patients receiving an opioid analgesic, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, or other tranquilizers, sedatives, hypnotics, or other CNS depressants (including alcohol) <b>concomitantly</b> with Nalbuphine may exhibit an additive effect. When such combined therapy is contemplated, the dose of one or both agents should be reduced.|$|E
25|$|As {{the hegemony}} of the Caliphate crumbled, Sarir found itself {{continually}} at war with its successor states, such as Derbent and Shirvan. In these wars it was generally victorious and allowed Sarir to manipulate the politics of Derbent. <b>Concomitantly,</b> the kings of Sarir shifted away from the Khazar alliance and mounted several incursions into the Khazarian steppes. The pattern of intermarriage between the royal houses of Sarir and Alania cemented the anti-Khazar alliance of the two Christian states.|$|E
25|$|On land Suleiman was <b>concomitantly</b> {{fighting}} for the conquest of Hungary in 1543, {{as a part of}} the Little War. French troops were supplied to the Ottomans on the Central European front: in Hungary, a French artillery unit was dispatched in 1543-1544 and attached to the Ottoman Army. Following major sieges such as the Siege of Esztergom (1543), Suleiman took a commanding position in Hungary, obtaining the signature of the Truce of Adrianople with the Habsburg in 1547.|$|E
25|$|King Bhumibol and {{the royal}} family took part {{frequently}} in Village Scout activities and attended ceremonies at Kittivudho's college and Red Gaur training camps, thus illustrating their close ties with these three paramilitary forces. While all three forces differed in their nature, they were united by their allegiance to the king and, <b>concomitantly,</b> their hatred of communists. These paramilitary forces would subsequently be mobilized to attack the student protesters at Thammasat University to end their weeks-long protests.|$|E
25|$|Due to a 50% longer stroke {{duration}} than a reciprocating four-cycle engine, {{there is}} more time to complete the combustion. This leads to greater suitability for direct fuel injection and stratified charge operation. A Wankel rotary engine has stronger flows of air-fuel mixture and a longer operating cycle than a reciprocating engine, achieving a <b>concomitantly</b> thorough mixing of hydrogen and air. The result is a homogeneous mixture and no hot spots in the engine, which is crucial for hydrogen combustion.|$|E
25|$|Temazepam, {{similar to}} other benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepine {{hypnotic}} drugs, causes impairments in body balance and standing steadiness in individuals who wake up at night or the next morning. Falls and hip fractures are frequently reported. The combination with alcohol increases these impairments. Partial but incomplete tolerance develops to these impairments. The smallest possible effective dose {{should be used in}} elderly or very ill patients, as a risk of apnea and/or cardiac arrest exists. This risk is increased when temazepam is given <b>concomitantly</b> with other drugs that depress the central nervous system (CNS).|$|E
25|$|IVF is also {{considered}} suitable {{in cases where}} any of its expansions is of interest, that is, a procedure that is usually not necessary for the IVF procedure itself, but would be virtually impossible or technically difficult to perform without <b>concomitantly</b> performing methods of IVF. Such expansions include preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) to rule out presence of genetic disorders, as well as egg donation or surrogacy where the woman providing the egg isn't the same who will carry the pregnancy to term. Further details in the Expansions-section below.|$|E
25|$|Indians {{migrated}} {{in large}} numbers to the United States to assume professional occupations as well as business opportunities beginning in the 1960s. A second wave of Indian immigrants has been attracted to the US since the 1990s {{with the advent of}} the information technology (IT) boom and the <b>concomitantly</b> robust American economy. Indians are also attending universities in the United States and elsewhere {{in large numbers}}; as per the UNESCO Institute for Statistics, the number of Indian students abroad tripled from 51,000 in 1999 to over 1,53,000 in 2007, making India second after China among the world’s largest sending countries for tertiary students.|$|E
25|$|The {{political}} {{stature of}} Flushing {{appears to be}} increasing significantly, with many Chinese from Flushing becoming New York City Council members. Taiwan-born John Liu, former New York City Council member representing District 20, which includes Flushing and other northern Queens neighborhoods, was elected to his current position of New York City Comptroller in November 2009. <b>Concomitantly,</b> Shanghai-born Peter Koo was elected to succeed Liu to assume this council membership seat.
