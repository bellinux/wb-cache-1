500|$|... patent foramen ovale– a hole {{between the}} atrial {{chambers}} {{of the heart}} in the fetus is normally closed by a flap with the first breaths at birth. In about 20% of adults the flap does not <b>completely</b> <b>seal,</b> however, allowing blood through the hole when coughing or during activities that raise chest pressure. In diving, this can allow venous blood with microbubbles of inert gas to bypass the lungs, where the bubbles would otherwise be filtered out by the lung capillary system, and return directly to the arterial system (including arteries to the brain, spinal cord and heart). In the arterial system, bubbles (arterial gas embolism) are far more dangerous because they block circulation and cause infarction (tissue death, due to local loss of blood flow). In the brain, infarction results in stroke, and in the spinal cord it may result in paralysis.|$|E
500|$|In 1961, {{the federal}} {{government}} passed the Western Australian Grants (Beef Cattle Roads) Act 1961, known as the Beef Roads Scheme, that encouraged road building in the Kimberley. This had followed on from an earlier federal grant scheme in 1949 {{for the construction of}} a road from Nicholson to Wyndham. The road allowed trucks to efficiently transport cattle to port, rather than the slow cattle drives that could lose stock and take weeks to complete. The 1961 Beef Roads Scheme initially included upgrading the Wyndham to Halls Creek section of Great Northern Highway as one of three projects in the region. One year later the scheme was expanded to include the Broome to Halls Creek section of the highway, and several bridge construction projects. However, the resources allocated to Great Northern Highway were needed to maintain the highway as an unsealed road in a usable condition, rather than to <b>completely</b> <b>seal</b> the roadway. In 1963, work was completed on stabilising a [...] sandy section to prevent vehicles from becoming bogged, a [...] section was realigned to avoid the Fortescue River floodplain, and [...] between Marble Bar and Port Hedland was also realigned to minimise the effects of wet weather.|$|E

50|$|A {{watch glass}} is a {{circular}} concave {{piece of glass}} used in chemistry as a surface to evaporate a liquid, to hold solids while being weighed, for heating {{a small amount of}} substance and as a cover for a beaker. The latter use is generally applied to prevent dust or other particles entering the beaker; the watch glass does not <b>completely</b> <b>seal</b> the beaker, so gas exchanges still occur.|$|E

This sack, along with the netting for the face and hands, must <b>completely</b> <b>seal</b> the masker's body. The netting effectively disguises facial and hand features that might disclose his identity.|$|E
50|$|Livorno, 300 {{miles north}} of Naples on the western coast of Italy, was needed as a supply base for the North Apennines campaign, but the port was the most {{thoroughly}} demolished one in the Mediterranean. The Germans had erected barricades, blown bridges, laid mines, and sunk twenty ships to <b>completely</b> <b>seal</b> off the harbor entrances. The Allies {{also contributed to the}} destruction; in some 50 raids {{during the first half of}} 1944, they dropped more than 1,000 tons of bombs.|$|E
50|$|Over {{the course}} of the story it is {{revealed}} little by little that the legend is full of lies. The real source of Karasumori's power is Chūshinmaru (宙心丸), an illegitimate son of the Hazama clan's founder, Tokimori Hazama, and the Karasumori clan's heiress. Tokimori used forbidden arts to try to give his son unearthly power, but the plan backfired, and instead gave Chūshinmaru the power to draw people's life force, killing everybody around him. Tokimori was forced to seal his own son beneath Karasumori. However, being alone with no aid Tokimori was unable to <b>completely</b> <b>seal</b> off the Shinkai he created. Which allowed Chūshinmaru's power to leak out, and it is this that draws ayakashi to the land.|$|E

50|$|Water vaporizes {{easily with}} heat and can corrode the metal {{parts of the}} system. Water which enters brake lines, even in small amounts, will react with most common brake fluids (i.e., those which are hygroscopic) causing the {{formation}} of deposits which can clog the brake lines and reservoir. It {{is almost impossible to}} <b>completely</b> <b>seal</b> any brake system from exposure to water, which means that regular changing out of brake fluid is necessary to ensure that the system is not becoming overfilled with the deposits caused by reactions with water. Light oils are sometimes used as hydraulic fluids specifically because they do not react with water: oil displaces water, protects plastic parts against corrosion, and can tolerate much higher temperatures before vaporizing, but has other drawbacks vs. traditional hydraulic fluids.|$|E
5000|$|On April 6, 2006, three ski patrollers at the {{ski area}} perished due to a {{combination}} of CO2 and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) poisoning. Both gases are present on a known dangerous fumarole on the mountain and were more concentrated on that day because the fumarole had been covered by snow for days. Four patrollers, including John [...] "Scott" [...] McAndrews and James Juarez, were raising the fence around the fumarole, which had become buried due to heavy snowfall. The fumarole had melted a cavern below the snowbridge which collapsed under James and Scott. The pair of men fell 21 ft and perished within a matter of minutes. Another ski patroller, Walt Rosenthal, perished and seven others were injured trying to rescue James and Scott. The oxygen masks used by the Mammoth Mountain ski patrol did not <b>completely</b> <b>seal</b> outer gases from coming in.|$|E

5000|$|On 28 February 2012, {{reinforcements}} from {{an elite}} Syrian military unit, {{directed by the}} brother of the Syrian president, took positions in Homs. They managed to <b>completely</b> <b>seal</b> off the city, notably by destroying a tunnel. On the morning of 29 February, an activist claimed that the Syrian Army had launched a ground assault with infantry on the rebel-held district of Baba Amr. A Syrian official {{who spoke on condition of}} anonymity appeared to confirm that the security forces were advancing on this district, were [...] "cleaning" [...] it from rebel fighters, and that the operation would be over in a matter of hours. However, as more reports started to emerge in the late afternoon, it seemed that a ground invasion had not taken place after all, with The Guardian Middle East correspondent Martin Chulov, his colleague Peter Beaumont and Syrian self-described 'citizen journalist' Omar Shakir all tweeting that the Syrian Army had not entered the district.|$|E

Naruto agrees to protect Sāra, after Anrokuzan declares about the kidnapped citizens and creates to summon the [...] "Puppet Ninja Forces". Minato, Shibi Aburame, Chōza Akimichi and Kakashi Hatake appear to support the heroes. While they rescue Sara's people and Naruto holds Minato's kunai, Sāra recalls her memory about Sēramu's lullaby. Anrokuzan uses the parts of the tower to become a giant defensive puppet. Minato and Naruto use their regenerative chakra enough to create the legendary Super Rasengan. After Sāra disables Anrokuzan's technique, Minato exposes Anrokuzan's weak spot and Naruto destroys it. As Yamato and Kakashi rescue Naruto and Sāra, Minato uses the kunai to <b>completely</b> <b>seal</b> off the power. Just as the heroes vanish from the past, Minato asks Naruto not to change history by erasing all of their memories.|$|E
50|$|The {{process for}} making the {{americium}} used in the buttons on ionization-type smoke detectors begins with americium dioxide. The AmO2 is thoroughly mixed with gold, shaped into a briquette, and fused by pressure and heat at over 1470°F (800°C). A backing of silver and a front covering of gold (or an alloy of gold or palladium) are applied to the briquette and sealed by hot forging. The briquette is then processed through several stages of cold rolling to achieve the desired thickness and levels of radiation emission. The final thickness is about 0.008 inches (0.2 mm), with the gold cover representing about {{one percent of the}} thickness. The resulting foil strip, which is about 0.8 inches (20 mm) wide, is cut into sections 39 inches (1 meter) long. The sources are punched out of the foil strip. Each disc, about 0.2 inches (5 mm) in diameter, is mounted in a metal holder, usually made of aluminium. The holder is the housing, which is the majority of what is seen on the button. The thin rim on the holder is rolled over to <b>completely</b> <b>seal</b> the cut edge around the disc.|$|E
