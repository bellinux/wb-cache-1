5|$|At ambient conditions, {{americium}} {{is present}} in its most stable α form which has a hexagonal crystal symmetry, and a space group P63/mmc with lattice parameters a= 346.8pm and c= 1124pm, and four atoms per unit cell. The crystal consists of a double-hexagonal close packing with the layer sequence ABAC and so is isotypic with α-lanthanum and several actinides such as α-curium. The crystal structure of americium changes with pressure and temperature. When compressed at room temperature to 5 GPa, α-Am transforms to the β modification, which has a face-centered cubic (fcc) symmetry, space group Fmm and lattice constant a= 489pm. This fcc structure {{is equivalent to the}} <b>closest</b> <b>packing</b> with the sequence ABC. Upon further compression to 23 GPa, americium transforms to an orthorhombic γ-Am structure similar to that of α-uranium. There are no further transitions observed up to 52 GPa, except for an appearance of a monoclinic phase at pressures between 10 and 15 GPa. There is no consistency on the status of this phase in the literature, which also sometimes lists the α, β and γ phases as I, II and III. The β-γ transition is accompanied by a 6% decrease in the crystal volume; although theory also predicts a significant volume change for the α-β transition, it is not observed experimentally. The pressure of the α-β transition decreases with increasing temperature, and when α-americium is heated at ambient pressure, at 770°C it changes into an fcc phase which is different from β-Am, and at 1075°C it converts to a body-centered cubic structure. The pressure-temperature phase diagram of americium is thus rather similar to those of lanthanum, praseodymium and neodymium.|$|E

Altair Designs were variations of a unique and unusual Islamic design constructed on an arrangement of <b>close</b> <b>packing</b> of circles, with variation in circle sizes. The design variations {{were found to have}} unique visual properties and served to stimulate the visual imagination. Altair Designs were originally published by Random House as colouring books for both adults and children under the Altair Design name. Burrows began developing, in the late 1960s, a dynamic geometry of <b>close</b> <b>packing</b> spheres of different sizes where spheres change size and move from one unique <b>close</b> <b>packing</b> arrangement to another, creating unique three-dimensional forms. Burrows has given numerous lectures on his geometry of <b>close</b> <b>packing</b> spheres as well as lectures on the evolution of geometrical systems through time, and how they were applied by cultures in the past. Burrows has also developed designs based on <b>close</b> <b>packing</b> circle arrangements generated by his geometry of spheres, including Images: The Ultimate Coloring Experience, and Hidden Images published by Running Press. Burrows redrew all of the original Altair designs for Wooden Books published in 2009. Altair Designs and Images designs are all based on unique geometrical structures - in the case of Altair Designs they are based on two arrangements of <b>close</b> <b>packing</b> circles {{and in the case of}} [...] "Images" [...] designs based on <b>close</b> <b>packing</b> circle arrangements of all sorts plus many other precise geometrical systems.|$|R
