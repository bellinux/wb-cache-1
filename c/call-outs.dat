25|$|Tarquinia, Tarquinii or Corneto, a UNESCO site: Approximately 6,000 graves {{dating from}} the Villanovan (ninth and eighth centuries BC) {{distributed}} in necropoleis, the main one being the Monterozzi hypogea of the sixth–fourth centuries BC. About 200 painted tombs display murals of various scenes with <b>call-outs</b> and descriptions in Etruscan. Elaborately carved sarcophagi of marble, alabaster, and nenfro include identificatory and achievemental inscriptions. The Tomb of Orcus at the Scatolini necropolis depicts scenes of the Spurinna family with <b>call-outs.</b>|$|E
25|$|As {{the force}} was {{initially}} part-time {{the presence of}} its soldiers was mostly felt during evenings and weekends. It was expected to answer to general <b>call-outs,</b> and was mobilised on a permanent basis on several occasions such as Operation Motorman to provide assistance {{to the police and}} army.|$|E
25|$|The {{relative}} infrequency of SWAT <b>call-outs</b> means these expensively {{trained and}} equipped officers cannot {{be left to}} sit around, waiting for an emergency. In many departments the officers are normally deployed to regular duties, but are available for SWAT calls via pagers, mobile phones, or radio transceivers. Even in the larger police agencies, such as the LAPD or the NYPD, SWAT personnel will normally be seen in crime suppression roles—specialized and more dangerous than regular patrol, perhaps, but the officers would not be carrying their distinctive armor and weapons.|$|E
50|$|In episode 5, Keenyah's <b>call-out</b> was omitted {{due to a}} {{possible}} editing mistake. Furthermore, the <b>call-out</b> order was changed by editing, so {{her place in the}} modified <b>call-out</b> is unknown.|$|R

25|$|In its {{submission}} to the NTSB, Virgin Galactic says the second SS2, nearing completion, had been modified {{with an automatic}} mechanical inhibit device to prevent locking or unlocking of the feather during safety-critical phases. An explicit warning {{about the dangers of}} premature unlocking has also been added to the checklist and operating handbook, and a formalized crew resource management (CRM) approach, already used by Virgin for its WK2 operations, is being adopted for SS2. This will include <b>call-outs</b> and a challenge/response protocol. While the report cites CRM issues as a likely contributing cause, Virgin says there is no plan to modify the cockpit display system.|$|E
25|$|The school's {{fire service}} {{works closely with}} the Grampian Fire and Rescue Service and have a fire station on campus with two {{fire-fighting}} appliances at their disposal. It was started in 1940 while the school was based in Wales and they acquired an appliance soon after. They attend roughly fifty <b>call-outs</b> a year and so members have to be medically and physically fit, training in order to pass the practical test before becoming fire fighters. The team is split into three watches lasting a week each and are on call 24 hours a day having to carry pagers and react quickly should they be called.|$|E
500|$|Dowd {{solved the}} {{recording}} issues by mixing three {{versions of the}} song. Some <b>call-outs</b> of [...] "Shake that thing!" [...] were removed, and the song was split into two three-and-a-half minute sides of a single record, titling the song [...] "What'd I Say PartI" [...] and [...] "What'd I Say PartII". The recorded version divides the parts with a false ending where the orchestra stops and the Raelettes and orchestra members beg Charles to continue, {{then goes on to}} a frenzied finale. Atlantic 45-2031 A side with Part I is 3:05, B side with Part II is 1:59. Dowd later stated after hearing the final recording that not releasing the record was never an option: [...] "we {{knew it was going to}} be a hit record, no question." [...] It was held for the summer and released in June 1959.|$|E

2500|$|Sabu {{returned}} to ECW on November 18, 1995 at November to Remember, and eventually engaged in matches and feuds {{with the likes}} of Rod Destiny, with whom he later teamed up with and won the ECW World Tag Team Championship twice. In the meantime, former tag team partner Tazmaniac (who had shortened his name to [...] "Taz") began to publicly challenge Sabu at every given opportunity, but got no response. After a year of <b>call-outs</b> and insults from Taz, Heyman revealed that he had asked Sabu, as a friend, to ignore Taz's challenge. This standoff culminated in a grudge match at ECW's first pay-per-view, Barely Legal, which Taz won. Following the match, Taz's manager Bill Alfonso turned on him and sided with Sabu and Rob Van Dam, who then formed a tag team. Sabu and Taz continued to feud on and off for the remainder of Taz's ECW career.|$|E
2500|$|Until February 2016 {{part of the}} Prestwick {{site was}} {{occupied}} by the Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm with RNAS Prestwick, officially known by the Royal Navy as HMS Gannet, where a detachment of 3 Sea Kings provided a search and rescue role, covering {{one of the largest}} SAR areas of the UK including Ben Nevis, the Lakes, Northern Ireland and [...] past the Irish coast. Additionally, Gannet SAR provided a medical evacuation service to the Scottish island communities. Personnel at the base numbered 15 officers, 11 ratings, 28 civil servants and 50 civilian staff. The crews regularly featured as part of the popular Channel 5 documentary series Highland Emergency. 2009 saw the unit break a new record as they were tasked to 447 <b>call-outs,</b> 20% of the UK's total military SAR call outs for 2009 and making them, {{for the second year in}} succession, the busiest Search & Rescue base in the UK.|$|E

Sumner earned a total of 2 first <b>call-outs</b> ("center piece" [...] at a [...] "party tooch" [...] photoshoot, and [...] "Dream Come True" [...] photoshoot), 4 second <b>call-outs,</b> and 3 third <b>call-outs.</b> Her consistency, personality, runway walk and portfolio led to Sumner becoming the eighteenth winner of the show, over Laura LaFrate.|$|E

Candidates subsequently participate in an Ordeal, intended to emphasize service and selflessness. During the induction, [...] "candidates maintain complete silence, receive small amounts of food, work on camp improvement projects, and are required to sleep alone, apart from other campers, which teaches significant values." [...] If they succeed in their ordeal the candidates are then welcomed as Ordeal members in a formal Ordeal Ceremony.|$|R
