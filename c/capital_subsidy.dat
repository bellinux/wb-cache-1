In addition, we investigate whether the technology structure of “hidden” production may facilitate or counteract the effects of fiscal policies on firm behavior. Among our results we stress the following: first, <b>capital</b> <b>subsidies</b> promote tax evasion; these subsidies induce firms to increase actual capital accumulation (a level effect), but also produce a reduction in the regular share of aggregate capital stock (a composition effect). Second, tax relief reduces underground activities and fosters capital accumulation, as well as aggregate production. Third, the technology structure matters for determining how to allocate resources between formal and informal production, hence the amount of reported revenues.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the nexus among {{selected}} firm-oriented fiscal policies (tax relief and <b>capital</b> <b>subsidies),</b> physical <b>capital</b> accumulation and underground activities.

In addition, we investigate whether the technology structure of “hidden” production may facilitate or counteract the effects (the effectiveness) of the fiscal policies on firm behavior. Subsidies programmes and tax advantages for “infant” industries or depressed areas are often justified because the industry is not competitive enough and prices do not show full flexibility. However, granting <b>capital</b> <b>subsidies</b> and tax allowances to firms has also important implications for underground activities and tax evasion. Underground activities occur in many countries, and there are significant indications that this phenomenon is large and increasing.

50|$|PPPs often {{involve a}} {{contract}} between a public sector authority {{and a private}} party, in which the private party provides a public service or project and assumes substantial financial, technical and operational risk in the project. In some types of PPP, the cost of using the service is borne exclusively by the users of the service and not by the taxpayer. In other types (notably the PFI), capital investment is made {{by the private sector}} {{on the basis of a}} contract with government to provide agreed services and the cost of providing the service is borne wholly or in part by the government. Government contributions to a PPP may also be in kind (notably the transfer of existing assets). In projects that are aimed at creating public goods like in the infrastructure sector, the government may provide a <b>capital</b> <b>subsidy</b> in the form of a one-time grant, so as to make the project economically viable. In some other cases, the government may support the project by providing revenue subsidies, including tax breaks or by guaranteed annual revenues for a fixed time period. In all cases, the partnerships include a transfer of significant risks to the private sector, generally in an integrated and holistic way, minimizing interfaces for the public entity. An optimal risk allocation is the main value generator for this model of delivering public service.|$|E

We consider a tractable macroeconomic model with risk-less physical capital and risky human capital {{in which the government}} chooses optimally a system of flat-rate taxes/subsidies as well as the level of spending on public services.

A quantitative study based on a calibrated version of the model reveals that the optimal human <b>capital</b> <b>subsidy</b> is substantial, but the corresponding welfare gains are small due to strong general equilibrium effects.

40|$|Graduation date: 1977 El Salvador's land {{resources}} are intensively cultivated. Labor is relatively abundant and wages are low. This study analyzed {{the effects of}} government policies and observed farm price distortions on enterprise/weed control system choices and associated income-employment effects. A regional linear programming framework was employed to analyze the effects of alternative government policies and observed farm prices on farm efficiency, employment, and income distribution within Central El Salvador. A major conclusion {{of the study was}} that the presence of price distortions and off-farm employment alternatives were not sufficient to induce changes in weed control technology on small and medium farms. The most efficient system both from an individual and social point of view was the use of manual weed control for all selected enterprises. The principal effects of price distortions on the small and medium farms (when compared with their undistorted price solutions) were the tendencies {{to reduce the number of}} selected enterprises and to modify the area allocated between enterprises. On the other hand, the process of capital-labor substitution on large farm appeared to be sensitive to direct and indirect government <b>subsidies</b> on <b>capital</b> when off-farm employment alternatives existed between 0 and 50 percent of total available labor supply. Herbicide-area diffusion ranged from 75 to 87 percent of total area on the large farm whenever the policy mix included direct or indirect <b>capital</b> <b>subsidies.</b> Comparisons of the alternative distorted price solutions using the undistorted price solutions revealed that whenever <b>capital</b> <b>subsidies</b> were present in any policy mix when off-farm employment opportunities were held at 50 percent of the available labor supply, total weed control employment levels were lower than the social price solution by 45 to 55 percent. The group most seriously affected by weed control employment reductions was the landless laborer. The group's weed control employment losses ranged from 73 to 89 percent below their social price-employment solution. The presence of <b>capital</b> <b>subsidies</b> in any policy mix under the 50 percent off-farm employment opportunity solutions induced relatively larger income gains (20 to 67 percent) to the three sizes of farms and income losses (3 to 13 percent) to the landless laborers. Production efficiency losses were relatively high in each of the three sizes of farms whenever <b>capital</b> <b>subsidies</b> were present. In view of these findings the El Salvador government should recognize a conflict between the use of direct and indirect <b>capital</b> <b>subsidies</b> particularly on herbicides and farm machinery and between stated national goals of increasing employment and improving income distribution. Fixing the wage rate at 3. 85 cents/day induced relative income gains that tend to favor the small farm and landless laborers... the least privileged and the biggest group in El Salvadors' total population.
