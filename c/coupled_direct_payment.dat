The model shows that if there are more sfp than eligible land, the capitalization ratio will not decline but rather increase due to the inclusion of animal premiums in the sfp. We can confirm our theoretical results for cross-section data on land rental prices in Bavaria in 2005. Empirical results indicate that sfp of the Fischler reform are more capitalized into rental prices than the <b>coupled</b> <b>direct</b> <b>payments</b> of the time prior to the reform. land rent, capitalisation of payments, CAP Fischler Reform, Agricultural and Food Policy, Public Economics, Q 18, Q 15, H 22,...|$|R

40|$|Economic theory {{suggests}} that <b>coupled</b> and decoupled <b>direct</b> <b>payments</b> have different impacts on agricultural rental values because of the different production responses associated with these payments. This study investigates the impact of both coupled and decoupled EU CAP <b>direct</b> <b>payments</b> on rental values in Northern Ireland, using panel data taken from the farm business survey for the period from 1994 to 2002. Theoretically, agricultural land rents are a function of expected market returns and expected associated <b>direct</b> <b>payments.</b> The unobservable nature of expected returns means that actual market returns must {{be used as a}} proxy for the former in the empirical specification.

40|$|The {{potential}} accession of Turkey to the EU, and {{the related}} adoption of the CAP by Turkey, is expected to influence agricultural markets in both the EU and Turkey. The extent of the accession impacts depends {{on the one hand}} on the way the CAP will be implemented in Turkey, while on the other hand impacts are expected to be also shaped by macroeconomic conditions (like exchange rates, GDP growth and inflation levels). In this paper we provide a comprehensive model-based assessment of the potential impacts on agricultural markets of a Turkish accession to the EU. We first assess the impacts under the assumption of standard macroeconomic projections, then we analyse how a different TL/Euro exchange rate, a doubling of the Turkish inflation rate or a doubling of the Turkish GDP growth rate would influence the accession impacts. Results of the Turkish EU-membership simulation show that the impacts on agricultural markets in Turkey are significant, while effects on EU markets are rather limited. The main impact on Turkish agriculture is a reduction of producer prices. With market prices and produced quantities declining, and as the <b>coupled</b> Turkish <b>direct</b> <b>payments</b> and the input subsidies will be replaced by lower payments of the CAP, agricultural income is expected to be reduced especially for Turkish crop producers (except for tobacco). In contrast, accession effects on the Turkish livestock sector are projected to be positive, mainly due to lower feed costs. Furthermore, the demand levels of most commodities are projected to increase due to lower prices, thus Turkish consumers are expected to gain from an accession to the EU. The further analysis reveals that in particular a depreciation of the Turkish lira alters the results of the accession scenario. JRC. J. 4 -Agriculture and Life Sciences in the Econom...|$|R

40|$|The {{origins of}} the <b>direct</b> <b>payments</b> scheme lie with the Disabled People’s {{movement}} and the revolutionary idea of providing disabled people with cash to pay directly for their assessed care and support needs. Authorisation was given in 1997 to local authorities in England to offer cash payments to purchase care and support services through the implementation of The Community Care 1996 (<b>Direct</b> <b>Payments)</b> Act. This scheme was initially restricted to those aged {{between the ages of}} 18 - 65 years. However since February 2000 (July 2000 in Scotland) this has been extended to include disabled people aged 65 and over, and further expanded in 2001 to include young disabled people between the ages of 16 and 18 years. Prior to the implementation of the Community Care Act, procedures following a community care assessment placed the local authority in complete control regarding arranging and coordinating an individual’s care package. The local authority arranged when and where services were provided, and who would provide them. The <b>direct</b> <b>payments</b> scheme could offer an alternative, more flexible approach, with the potential to empower individuals choosing to opt into this scheme. Individuals in receipt of <b>direct</b> <b>payments</b> have control in making arrangements for the provision of services that work with their lifestyle as opposed to their lifestyle ‘fitting around’ local authority organised care and support services. <b>Direct</b> <b>payments</b> position the individual at the centre of control for their own service provision.

30|$|The Common Agricultural Policy has {{traditionally}} provided support to farm incomes via <b>direct</b> <b>payments</b> under the Single Payment Scheme. This article analyzes whether {{the reform of}} the SPS will decrease the concentration of <b>direct</b> <b>payments</b> and evaluates {{the effect of the}} new <b>direct</b> <b>payment</b> scheme on the redistribution of farm incomes. The decomposition of the Gini coefficient allows analysis of the evolution of farm income and <b>direct</b> <b>payment</b> distributions in Italy from 2014 to 2020, and empirical results based on the Italian Farm Accountancy Data Network show that the CAP 2013 reform is expected to decrease the concentration of <b>direct</b> <b>payments.</b> However, the reform is also expected to limit the reduction in farm income inequality due to the adoption of a partial convergence model (the so-called “tunnel” model) instead of a total convergence model as well as, more generally, the increasing share of farm income that is dependent on increased market exposure, leading to higher risks of price volatility and increasing pressure on income.|$|R
