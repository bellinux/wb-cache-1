40|$|This paper {{discusses}} a pair {{of experiments}} in which groups of consumer photographers were {{given the opportunity to}} crop and zoom their pictures. In the first of these studies, a group of 33 customers were intercepted as they obtained their print orders from their photofinisher. While reviewing their prints, the participants were asked which of their pictures they would like to zoom and crop. The users were then asked to use a collapsible template with a 2 : 3 aspect ratio to draw zoom and crop lines on the selected prints. These data were analyzed to determine the proportion of prints the users want to crop and the amount of cropping that was applied. In a second study the film of a group of 14 customers was intercepted, these pictures were scanned to a KODAK PHOTO CD Disc and the users were asked to use a computer-based tool to place a fixed 2 : 3 aspect ratio <b>crop</b> <b>box</b> in a subset of their photographs. This data was analyzed to determine the amount of cropping that was applied, as well as some guidelines for computer-based crop tools. This research shows that consumers wish to apply cropping to roughly 40 percent of their photographs. Some differences in the amount of cropping were observed between the two experiments...|$|E

40|$|Despite recent progress, {{computational}} visual aesthetic {{is still}} challenging. Image cropping, {{which refers to}} the removal of unwanted scene areas, {{is an important step}} to improve the aesthetic quality of an image. However, it is challenging to evaluate whether cropping leads to aesthetically pleasing results because the assessment is typically subjective. In this paper, we propose a novel cascaded cropping regression (CCR) method to perform image cropping by learning the knowledge from professional photographers. The proposed CCR method improves the convergence speed of the cascaded method, which directly uses random-ferns regressors. In addition, a two-step learning strategy is proposed and used in the CCR method {{to address the problem of}} lacking labelled cropping data. Specifically, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier is first trained on large-scale visual aesthetic datasets. The deep CNN model is then designed to extract features from several image cropping datasets, upon which the <b>cropping</b> bounding <b>boxes</b> are predicted by the proposed CCR method. Experimental results on public image cropping datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art image cropping methods.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{verification}} {{runs on the}} farming of shrimp [Penaeus monodon (Fabricius) ] using environment-friendly techniques was conducted in different pilot demonstration sites including privately owned farms in the Philippines from 2001 to 2005. Encouraging results were achieved using the low or partial discharge and closed-recirculating systems following the advanced environment-friendly protocols. In the low or partial discharge system, 11 grow-out ponds were stocked with P. monodon post larvae (PL) at densities between 15 and 25 m - 2 while in the closedrecirculating system, eight grow-out ponds were stocked with PLs at densities between 30 and 60 m - 2. Both systems incorporated the use of head and tail reservoirs, <b>crop</b> rotation, filter <b>box,</b> salinity reduction, long-arm paddlewheel aerators, biomanipulators, biofilters, sludge collectors and quality feeds. In the low or partial discharge system, an average total yield of 5. 3 Â± 0. 8 tons ha - 1, a feed conversion ratio (FCR) of 1. 4 Â± 0. 3 and a survival rate of 86 Â± 12 % were achieved after 109 â€“ 159 d of culture (DOC). In a closed recirculating system, however, an average total yield of 8. 3 Â± 4. 0 tons ha - 1, FCR of 1. 9 Â± 0. 2 and survival rate of 76 Â± 15 % were achieved after 126 â€“ 150 DOC. Analyses of effluents from grow-out ponds revealed that treatment using the tail reservoir with installed baffles and oysters (Crossostrea sp.) and seaweed (Gracilaria sp.) used as biofilters effectively reduced the dissolved organic nutrient concentration to optimum levels before the water was recycled or released to the surrounding body of water.

40|$|Sonchus arvensis L. is a {{perennial}} weed {{which has become}} more common in Scandinavian countries owing mainly to the proliferation of organic farming which limits the use of her-bicides. When soil tillage is used for controlling perennial weeds, farmers are usually recommended that mechanical disturbance should {{be done at the}} developmental stage when the plant is most sensitive for disturbance which coincides with minimum below ground dry weight. Håkansson (1969 b) has shown that S. arvensis reaches its minimum dry weight of underground regenerative structures at 5 - 7 true leaves. The time taken to reach dry weight minimum depends on environmental factors like temperature but may also be influenced by competition from other plants. The aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate if the phenological stage, at which minimum dry weight of below ground biomass occurred in S. arvensis (i. e. compensation point), was affected by competition from a <b>crop.</b> A greenhouse <b>box</b> experiment was performed at Ultuna, close to Uppsala, Sweden (59 º 48 ’N, 17 º 39 ’E) during January - April 2012. The plant material used in the experiment was Sonchus arvensis L. (perennial sow-thistle) and Hordeum vulgare L. var Judit (spring barley). The experiment consisted of two treatments: S. arvensis grown (1) with (C+) and (2) without (C-) competition from spring barley. The compensation point in competing plants occurred at leaf stages 4 and 5, while it occurred at the 4 leaf stage in plants without competition. For given phenological stages, weight loss of below-ground structures did not differ between the C+ and C- plants, apart from the 5 leaf stage, at which the C+ plants had lost more in weight that the C- plants. The initially planted root parts of C+ plants lost more weight than the C- plants. Phenological development of S. arvensis, in terms of development of numbers of leaves over time, was delayed by competition with spring barley. For agronomy practice, these results imply that S. arvensis should be controlled earlier than previously was recommended, and that competition from a crop can be used in addition to greatly deplete the below-ground resources in S. arvensis...|$|R

At Gakuta, mimosa trees grew faster {{than all the other}} species that were tested. After two years mimosa trees were, on average, almost twice as tall as certain other species and the trees also produced a substantial amount of fresh leaf material. Management trials also showed that mimosa coppices extremely well. Trials were also set up to determine which of the species introduced to the Gakuta Research Station provided the best fodder. Overall the goats preferred the grass mixed with Acacia koaia but the mixture of the grass and mimosa leaves came a close second. Indeed, the goats ate the mimosa-grass mixture as readily as they did the pure grass. Mimosa is rich in protein, with a content of 24. 5 % which is comparable to other species popularly used in Rwanda. Mimosa trees are not just acceptable to goats. Farmers also welcome the trees and the positive results obtained on the research station were duplicated on the farms. Farmers favourably compared the usefulness and the morphology of the mimosa trees with those of leucaena and sesbania.

40|$|Rain-fed crop {{production}} {{is one of}} the dominant farming practices in developing countries and {{plays a major role in}} providing food and livelihoods for an increasing world population. In recent years climate related risks on {{crop production}} has become the centre of concern in rain-fed areas because losses from climate-related risks are rising. Limited understanding of the local climatic-related risks compromise better climatic risk management in rain-fed crop production system. Site specific or tailored studies that address particular crop at a particular area have shown to minimize climate-related challenges and uncertainty. For the sake of local climatic challenges, this study carried out a study to identify local climatic risk, assess the effect of those risks to crop and biomass yield and suggest methods to minimize local climatic risks of groundnut production in central Tanzania. The main objective of this study was to improve the understanding of agricultural project managers and extension officers on the effect of local climatic risks, with the aim to better manage climatic risk in crop production. To achieve the study objectives, there were three distinctive components in this study. The first components was to examine local climatic risks available in the study site, the second component examined the impact of selected local climatic risk to biomass and crop yield, and the third component explored options to minimize local climatic risk using climatic data. In the first component, Instat statistical package was used to analyse local climatic risk named planting date, raindays, length of the season, and dry spell length variability including temperature extremes. In the second component, the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) was used to assess the impact of different planting dates to biomass and groundnut yield. In the third component, Statistical package Instat was used to address options to minimize local climatic risks by calculating the risks of replanting or <b>crop</b> failure and <b>box</b> plot analysis for different planting date and seasonal length variability. The analysis of the first component found that climate variability is a major challenge and was measured by standard deviation and R-squared values. The second component observed more yields to planting dates that has minimum variability. The third component observed reduction of local climatic risks by up to 30 % by changing management practice (apply planting date with minimum variability). This study concluded that local climatic risks are very unique and affect crops at various stages of development. Local climatic risks if not well understood are potential to decrease yield hence compromise efforts of increasing crop production by farmers and other key stakeholders such at crop researcher, extension officers and insurance companies. Further studies are needed to identify multiple climatic risks with spatial analysis. Analysis of the impact of individual risks should be done for each crop because each crop impacted different by different risks. There is a need for further study on other interventions on how to minimize local climatic risks to improve yield, and further studies is needed on communicating local climatic risks with key stakeholders with the aim to update new interventions to local farmers.

40|$|Authors: Takumi Higaki, Natsumaro Kutsuna & Seiichiro Hasezawa ### Abstract The {{protocol}} {{reported here}} describes {{a method to}} quantitatively evaluate fluorescently-tagged protein localizations from fluorescent microscopic images {{with a combination of}} probabilistic mapping and image clustering. We demonstrate the use of this protocol using kidney-shaped guard cells of plants. ### Introduction Microscopic assessment of protein localizations with fluorescent protein tagging is an important assay in cell biological studies. We believe that protein localizations should be statistically assessed based on many observations, because the interpretation of a single microscopic image often leads to biased information. As proved in previous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analyses (1, 2, 3), probabilistic mapping is a simple and powerful method to determine average distributions of visualized objects. Clustering is a kind of unsupervised learning based on distances between each data point. Similarities between microscopic images can be evaluated using clustering with appropriate image metrics (4). Using the fluorescent image of kidney-shaped guard cells, we recently developed the image processing framework to quantitatively evaluate protein localizations with probabilistic mapping and image clustering (5). This protocol explains how to evaluate the localization similarity of marker proteins from the 3 -D images of Arabidopsis guard cells that are freely available in our [image database LIPS (5) ]([URL] We prefer self-organizing mapping (SOM) (6) as an image clustering method because of its superiority for image inspection. ### Equipment **Computer** A laptop computer (CF-J 9, Panasonic) with 64 -bit Windows operating system, 6 GiB of random access memory (RAM), and the Intel Core i 5 CPU was used here. **ImageJ software** Download and install the ImageJ software ([URL] For general operations, please refer the official user guide 7 [URL] **Download Kbi plug-ins and Hig macros** 1.

40|$|Cheap and {{efficient}} communication aids development. Urban centres have {{grown out of}} people's {{need to be able}} to communicate with each other. From this congregation and communication spring self-perpetuating economic activity and development. Rural areas have been left behind, but with better telecommunications and wider access to modern electronic information technology they will have a chance to catch up. Imagine a world-wide road network. The 'roads' have fast-moving traffic, safely carrying important 'packages' to their destination. Business is flourishing. Raw materials are ordered on time, manufacturing and service industries run efficiently and manufactured goods and other products are priced competitively and delivered to satisfied customers around the world. Every single individual, whether a farmer living at the end of a track (which disappears in the rainy season), or the sales manager of a big commercial enterprise close to the international airport, could be linked to this network. That, at least, is the theory but, in practice, it seems that there is a big diversion sign around many of the ACP States. If the diversion signs were removed, what impact would that have on rural development? The 'road network' is the internet and the fast-moving traffic are packets of information data. The major advantage of the internet over other means of communication is that people can 'speak' to each other, no matter who they are or how far apart they may be. Their communication is cheap, quick and two-way, unlike radio, TV and print, and the quantity and variety of information that can be instantly transferred is staggering. When two people speak by telephone, a part of the telephone system is entirely dedicated to the call, which means that when many people want to use the telephone system at the same time its capacity is quickly exhausted and no line is available. When two people use the same lines to communicate by internet, the information is broken down into small packets of data which then flow like a stream of traffic across the network. The packets of data, which get mixed up with everyone else's data, are routed through junctions. Even though a single communication may be broken into separate data packets which follow separate routes, the receiver gets the complete, reconstituted message. As long as senders and receivers have a computer, modem, appropriate software, a telephone line, and an understanding of how to use the equipment, they can exchange information. However, users also need to know how to make good use of all that the internet can offer. The internet offers access to information. The type of information required will obviously depend on the user. A farmers' cooperative may want to know what price could be obtained for their crops if they were exported rather than sold in the nearest market town. They may want to know what transport will be available to move the goods, how much that would cost and whether, therefore, the venture would be profitable. In any business transaction, the better informed the seller, the better the chance of a fair price. A fruit grower may want technical advice to help judge the perfect time for harvesting the <b>crop</b> (see <b>box).</b> Agricultural researchers may need information which relates to their work and which they know will be available only from a major university on the other side of the world. University students returning from higher degree studies overseas may need to maintain contact with their tutors or supervisors in order to complete research work or, indeed, the university professors may wish to learn from their ex-students. The internet also provides access to distance learning, through which formal qualifications can be obtained by pursuing home study courses backed up by materials and tutoring accessed via the internet. Surf or sink The internet should be thought of as the infrastructure for communication; by using that infrastructure in different ways, various services can be obtained. The most well-known are the World Wide Web, e-mail and usenet or news (see box). The World Wide Web is the main service to use to undertake a search for information yourself. E-mail is used to contact an information provider directly, rather like a telephone call or fax which is addressed to a specific person or organization. Usenet is rather like a notice board that anyone, anywhere, can look at and to which anyone can pin their own notice. It is a way of asking questions and receiving answers from people who are interested in the same subject. This would be similar to CTA's Question-and-Answer Service but anyone could read both questions and answers and make their own contribution. Many individuals can gain the benefit of such a service if the organization that has access to the internet then distributes the information to those who have not by means of printed information sheets or even via local radio. The value of information depends on the relevance, and therefore the value, of the question to which it is attempting to respond. If the question has been correctly addressed, a response is little more than a mechanical process, which is why computers are so good at it. If you post a question into an inappropriate usenet discussion group, for example, you could wait for ever for a sensible answer. Asking the right question, therefore, actually requires more skill, understanding and intelligence than supplying the answer. For example, the secretary of a farmers' organization may be asked by the members to find out about applying fertilizer to the season's crop of maize. The answer could come back as, 'N 50 kg/ha, P 25 kg P 2 O 5 /ha, K 50 kg K 2 O/ha', when in fact the information actually required is, 'Three weeks' time, 100 shillings a bag'. Computers are very good at supplying answers but very bad at guessing questions. In an attempt to find the question, the World Wide Web, for example, will provide so many answers, or so many options for finding answers, that the task may become so tedious that it is abandoned. With access to a telephone line, which is, in any case, necessary in order to access the internet, the secretary would have been better advised to telephone the local agricultural store and ask when the fertilizer will be in and what it will cost. As with any other form of communication it is important to know how to define what information you need and how to communicate that need. Then comes the problem of knowing how to use the information received. The better the first two tasks are done, the easier is the third. Precise, accurate and free of bias? Another point which is related to the importance of being precise when seeking information is the need for that information to be accurate. In this respect the internet has both advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand it allows the user to access information from many different places, some of which may be a great distance apart; this could permit a degree of comparison and potentially a lack of bias. On the other hand, all information has, at some stage or another, been made available through the activity of a human being and human beings wittingly, or unwittingly, often give inaccurate information. There may be a temptation to feel that because information has come via a medium of sophisticated modern technology, it must be valid. A conversation on the internet may be as informal as a conversation with a stranger in a bar or at the bus stop. Who would place great confidence in such a casual exchange of information? This is not to say that such information should be mistrusted, but that it should be subject to the same level of scrutiny and judgment as any other information source. It should be remembered that in addition to its undoubted advantages for accessing information that is worthwhile or even essential, the World Wide Web provides commercial suppliers, not all of them totally honest, with a wonderful, world-wide shop window. The same level of judgment needs to be applied to these suppliers' beguiling advertisements on the internet. There are disturbing stories, for example, of unscrupulous operators selling spurious AIDS cures via the internet. Inducements to buy additional computer software or more sophisticated hardware in order to use the internet ever more efficiently are likely to be more tempting. A cynical observer might suggest that these products have built-in obsolescence, for this is how the service providers make their money. Nevertheless, new products are constantly becoming available and to be able to identify a potential crop pest from the scanned image of its wing sent from a remote location in Africa to a London-based institution may be deemed a very cost-effective piece of technology. Cost before benefit Apart from the potential benefits and drawbacks of using the internet, there are technical challenges which, until now, have limited its use in many ACP States and which largely remain to be overcome. The most significant of these is the telephone system. Many ACP States have inadequate, obsolete telephone systems that cannot satisfy the demands of social communication, let alone commercial development. Although radio or satellite links can overcome shortcomings in land-based telephone systems, these also require investment and any commercial investor or service provider will need to be confident of a return on their investment. This confidence is in part dependent on economic and political stability. Furthermore, a population that needs basic education and better health care is unlikely to press for a better telecommunications network, even though the opportunity of being able to communicate cheaply {{and efficient}}ly may be the most effective means of stimulating economic development which may, in turn, provide the best hope of acquiring better health care and education. In addition to telephone access, users of electronic information technology must be able to purchase suitable computers, modem equipment and software. The setting up and use of these will almost certainly require, at least in the early stages, back-up services from the suppliers and training. The equipment must be robust enough to withstand less than ideal climatic conditions and must be housed in a reasonably dust-free, dry atmosphere. Security for any portable, expensive equipment is always a problem as is ensuring that the equipment is used only by those who know how to operate it properly and who will pass on its benefits to others.
