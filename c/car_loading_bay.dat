50|$|The {{high-level}} walkway {{system which}} linked the Hayward to the Hungerford Bridge area was partly removed in spring 1999, leaving a curious truncated end on Festival Square, and poorer access from Festival Square. This {{is exacerbated by}} the positioning of the <b>car</b> park and <b>loading</b> <b>bay</b> entrances, {{a legacy of the}} original 1960's design ideas about vertical separation of pedestrian and vehicle traffic. Among the tricks of the building is the different lines of the walls at ground level and walkway level on this facade, which reconcile the differing axes of the Hayward and the Royal Festival Hall.|$|R
5000|$|Coleman {{was arrested}} for assault for an {{incident}} that took place on 20 September 2012. Helen Michael, a café owner in North Finchley who had actively opposed his policy on parking charges, saw him park his <b>car</b> in a <b>loading</b> <b>bay</b> opposite her café. She claimed that she was filming him on her mobile phone when he noticed her and attempted to grab the camera. A policeman intervened and Coleman then jumped {{into his car and}} attempted to drive off with both doors open, hitting a truck before speeding off. Coleman was charged with assault by beating and driving on a road without reasonable consideration.|$|R

50|$|Containers, {{trucks and}} {{trailers}} are typically loaded / unloaded {{from the rear}} by reversing the vehicle up against a raised concrete <b>loading</b> <b>bay,</b> the cargo is then moved using counterbalanced forklift trucks. The <b>loading</b> <b>bay</b> {{is designed to be}} at approximately the height of the vehicle with a leveling device to accommodate any height differences.There are however many situations where {{it is not possible to}} utilize a permanent <b>loading</b> <b>bay.</b> In these situations, a yard ramp is an ideal solution, providing fast, efficient loading and unloading of trucks/trailers by forklifts. The possession of a yard ramp also provides a backup in case of any problems encountered with a normal loading bay/dock leveler system, and can also provide additional flexibility should vehicles be encountered that the normal <b>loading</b> <b>bay</b> cannot cope with.|$|R

30|$|Using {{the data}} collected, we analyse (i) the arrival rates of {{vehicles}} at the observed malls, (ii) the empirical distribution of parking durations at the <b>loading</b> <b>bays,</b> (iii) {{the factors that}} influence the parking duration, (iv) the empirical distribution of waiting times spent by freight vehicle queueing to access the <b>loading</b> <b>bay,</b> and (v) the driver parking location choices and how this choice is influenced by system congestion.|$|R
30|$|An {{alternative}} {{solution is to}} establish centralized receiving stations, deploying a third-party logistics partner receiving the goods at the <b>loading</b> <b>bays</b> and carrying them to the stores whenever the retailer prefers. Although this initiative is relatively unexplored, it could reduce parking congestion since (1) it reduces the parking durations, and therefore increase the parking turnover at the <b>loading</b> <b>bay</b> and (2) it gives vehicles’ drivers more freedom in choosing the arrival time and in scheduling their deliveries. However, to be effective, we recommend that such centralized receiving stations should (1) operate off-peak and outside the store opening times and (2) {{should be able to}} handle pick-ups, namely retrieving the goods from the stores and staging them at the <b>loading</b> <b>bay</b> until the drivers arrive at the mall.|$|R
