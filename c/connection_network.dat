500|$|The {{adjacency}} matrix of a finite graph {{is a basic}} notion of graph theory. It records which vertices of the graph are connected by an edge. Matrices containing just two different values (1 and 0 meaning for example [...] "yes" [...] and [...] "no", respectively) are called logical matrices. The distance (or cost) matrix contains information about distances of the edges. These concepts {{can be applied to}} websites connected by hyperlinks or cities connected by roads etc., in which case (unless the <b>connection</b> <b>network</b> is extremely dense) the matrices tend to be sparse, that is, contain few nonzero entries. Therefore, specifically tailored matrix algorithms can be used in network theory.|$|E

40|$|The phase {{transition}} of spiral waves in networks of Hodgkin-Huxley neurons impelled by channel noise is examined {{in point of}} interest. All neurons in the networks are combined with little world associations, and the outcomes are contrasted and the case for normal networks, in which all neurons are totally combined with closest neighbor associations. A statistical variable is characterized to contemplate the aggregate conduct and {{phase transition}} of the spiral wave because of the channel noise and topology of the network. The impact of little world <b>connection</b> <b>networks</b> is depicted by neighborhood normal <b>networks</b> and long-go <b>connection</b> with certain probability p. The numerical results affirm that (1) a stable rotating spiral wave can be created and keep up powerful with low p, where {{the breakup of the}} spiral wave and turbulence result from expanding the probability p to a specific threshold; (2) suitable intensity of the advanced channel noise can build up a spiral wave among turbulent states in little world association networks of H-H neurons; and (3) regular <b>connection</b> <b>networks</b> are more hearty to channel noise than little world <b>connection</b> <b>networks.</b> A spiral wave in a little world network experiences insecurity all the more effectively as the membrane temperature is expanded to a specific high threshold...|$|R

The characterization and topological studies of these networks may be performed through distribution of connectivity degrees, rank properties, shortest path length between nodes, adjacency matrix etc. This paper characterizes the Internet connections evolution over the last 10 years at the Autonomous Systems (AS) level analyzing the complete BGP data set from Oregon route server. We present the behavior of the power law function and the shortest path length of the Internet for each year. Simulations of the <b>connections</b> <b>network</b> were carried out by a proposed model developed from continuous growth premises, possibilities of new and rearranging connections.

40|$|Central brain <b>network</b> <b>connections</b> greatly {{contribute}} to overall network efficiency. Here we examined whether small vessel disease (SVD) related white matter alterations in central brain <b>network</b> <b>connections</b> {{have a greater}} impact on executive functioning than alterations in non-central brain <b>network</b> <b>connections.</b> Brain <b>networks</b> were reconstructed from diffusion-weighted MRI scans in 72 individuals (75 ± 8 years) with cognitive impairment and SVD on MRI. The centrality of white matter <b>connections</b> in the <b>network</b> was defined using graph theory. The association between the fractional anisotropy (FA) of central versus non-central connections, executive functioning, and markers of SVD was evaluated with linear regression and mediation analysis. Lower FA in central <b>network</b> <b>connections</b> was more strongly associated with impairment in executive functioning than FA in non-central <b>network</b> <b>connections</b> (r = 0. 41 vs. r = 0. 27; P 50 %– 10 % connections). Higher SVD burden was associated with lower FA in central as well as non-central <b>network</b> <b>connections.</b> However, only central network FA mediated the relationship between white matter hyperintensity volume and executive functioning [change in regression coefficient after mediation (95 % CI) : − 0. 15 (− 0. 35 to − 0. 02) ]. The mediation effect was not observed for FA alterations in non-central <b>network</b> <b>connections</b> [− 0. 03 (− 0. 19 to 0. 04) ]. These findings suggest that the centrality of <b>network</b> <b>connections,</b> and thus their contribution to global network efficiency, appears to be relevant for understanding the relationship between SVD and cognitive impairment.

50|$|Maturing colonies Colletotrichum lindemuthianum, produce conidial {{anastomosis}} tubes (CATs) between conidia {{before leaving}} the host and before germination, {{in contrast to the}} genetic model fungus Neurospora crassa (bread mould) that produces conidial anastomosis tubes from conidia and conidial germ tubes during germination. Other Colletotrichum species produce conidial anastomosis tubes as well. The initial characterization of CATs was made in this plant pathogen in 2003 by Roca et al. in Brazil. CATs first form 15 days after the start of fruiting body development and grow from the conidia. As they grow, they may either fuse with other CATs, as evidenced by fusion points, or make direct contact with another conidium. Because each conidium creates CATs, the result is a network of conidia all connected together. The CAT network is developed very quickly, often within 1 hour of the first CAT connection. The exact purpose of this <b>connection</b> <b>network</b> is unclear, but it permits free flow of cytoplasm, proteins, organelles and even nuclei between conidia. It is unclear whether these CATs can play a role in genetic recombination, as no sexual stages for C. lindemuthianum has been found in nature.|$|E
