HyMOD was calibrated against 5 [*]km 2 gridded UK Climate Projections dataset data and then driven using monthly spatially interpolated (~ 5 [*]km 2) outputs from Hadley <b>Centre</b> <b>Coupled</b> Model, version 3 and the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis for Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (IPCC-SRES) A 2 a and B 2 a covering the 2020 s, 2050 s and 2080 s.

Both Hadley <b>Centre</b> <b>Coupled</b> Model, version 3 and the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis show higher ranges of uncertainty during the winter season with higher values of run-off associated with December in all three simulation periods and two scenarios. A seasonal comparison of run-off simulations shows that both GCMs give similar results in summer and autumn, whereas disparities due to GCM uncertainties are more conspicuous in winter and spring. In this study, both the GCMs under A 2 a scenario have demonstrated the high possibility of time shift in monthly average peak run-offs in the Derwent River by 2080 s in comparison with the early 21 st century...|$|R

This paper documents various enhancements made to improve the simulation, resulting in a sea ice simulation that is better than the original HadCM 3 scheme overall. Importantly, it is more physically based and provides a more solid foundation for future development.

40|$|Abstract. The {{sensitivity}} of El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) {{to changes in}} mean climate is investigated for simulations of pre-industrial and mid-Holocene (6000 years before present) climate using the Hadley <b>Centre</b> <b>coupled</b> atmosphere-ocean model, HadCM 3. Orbitally-forced changes in insolation in the mid-Holocene produce changes in seasonality which may alter ENSO amplitude and frequency. The model simulations are compared with mid-Holocene fossil coral oxygen isotope records from the western Pacific Warm Pool. The coral records imply a reduction of around 60 % in the amplitude of interannual variability associated with ENSO in the mid-Holocene, while the model simulates a smaller reduction in ENSO amplitude of around 10 %. The model also simulates a slight shift to longer period variability and a weakening of ENSO phase-locking to the seasonal cycle in the mid-Holocene. There is little change {{in the pattern of}} ENSO tropical precipitation teleconnections in the simulated mid-Holocene climate. ...|$|R
