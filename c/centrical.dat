60|$|There {{was now a}} {{pause in}} the {{military}} movements on both sides. The government seemed contented to prevent the rebels advancing towards the capital, while the insurgents were intent upon augmenting and strengthening their forces. For this purpose, they established a sort of encampment in the park belonging to the ducal residence at Hamilton, a <b>centrical</b> situation for receiving their recruits, and where they were secured from any sudden attack, by having the Clyde, a deep and rapid river, {{in front of their}} position, which is only passable by a long and narrow bridge, near the castle and village of Bothwell.|$|E
60|$|Be {{that as it}} may, I do {{not think}} that any {{unbiased}} traveler will doubt that the best possible selection has been made, presuming always, as we may presume in the discussion, that Montreal could not be selected. I take for granted that the rejection of Montreal was regarded as a sine qua non in the decision. To me it appears grievous that this should have been so. It is a great thing for any country to have a large, leading, world-known city, and I think that the government should combine with the commerce of the country in carrying out this object. But commerce can do a great deal more for government than government can do for commerce. Government has selected Ottawa as the capital of Canada; but commerce has already made Montreal the capital, and Montreal will be the chief city of Canada, let government do what it may to foster the other town. The idea of spiting a town because there has been a row in it {{seems to me to be}} preposterous. The row was not the work of those who have made Montreal rich and respectable. Montreal is more <b>centrical</b> than Ottawa--nay, it is as nearly <b>centrical</b> as any town can be. It is easier to get to Montreal from Toronto than to Ottawa; and if from Toronto, then from all that distant portion of Upper Canada back of Toronto. To all Lower Canada Montreal is, as a matter of course, much easier of access than Ottawa. But having said so much in favor of Montreal, I will again admit that, putting aside Montreal, the best possible selection has been made.|$|E

60|$|Few cities, or localities for cities, have fairer natural {{advantages}} than Portland and I am {{bound to}} say that the people of Portland have done much in turning them to account. This town is not the capital of the State in a political point of view. Augusta, which is farther to the north, on the Kennebec River, is the seat of the State government for Maine. It is very generally the case that the States do not hold their legislatures and carry on their government at their chief towns. Augusta and not Portland is the capital of Maine. Of the State of New York, Albany is the capital, and not the city which bears the State's name. And of Pennsylvania, Harrisburg and not Philadelphia is the capital. I think the idea has been that old-fashioned notions were bad in that they were old fashioned; and that a new people, bound by no prejudices, might certainly make improvement by choosing for themselves new ways. If so, the American politicians have not been the first in the world who have thought that any change must be a change for the better. The assigned reason is the <b>centrical</b> position of the selected political capitals; but I have generally found the real commercial capital to be easier of access than the smaller town in which the two legislative houses are obliged to collect themselves.|$|E
60|$|The site of {{the present}} City of Washington was chosen with three special views: firstly, that being on the Potomac it might have the full {{advantage}} of water-carriage and a sea-port; secondly, {{that it might be}} so far removed from the sea-board as to be safe from invasion; and, thirdly, that it might be central alike to all the States. It was presumed, when Washington was founded, that these three advantages would be secured by the selected position. As regards the first, the Potomac affords to the city but few of the advantages of a sea-port. Ships can come up, but not ships of large burden. The river seems to have dwindled since the site was chosen, and at present it is, I think, evident that Washington can never be great in its shipping. Statio benefida carinis can never be its motto. As regards the second point, singularly enough Washington is the only city of the Union that has been in an enemy's possession since the United States became a nation. In the war of 1812 it fell into our hands, and we burned it. As regards the third point, Washington, from the lie of the land, can hardly have been said to be <b>centrical</b> at any time. Owing to the irregularities of the coast it is not easy of access by railways from different sides. Baltimore would have been far better. But {{as far as we can}} now see, and as well as we can now judge, Washington will soon be on the borders of the nation to which it belongs, instead of at its center. I fear, therefore, that we must acknowledge that the site chosen for his country's capital by George Washington has not been fortunate.|$|E

The {{composition}} is <b>centrical,</b> pyramidally built with the highest central dome and lower ones - over the faceted sleeves of architectural cross. So its composition reminds a wooden. Ukrainian church with five octahedral capacities - octahedrons each crowned with dome combined in on plastic unity. Thanks to such pyramidal construction the church looks tender, elegant and solemn. The facades are a characteristic feature of the church. The main role in their decoration is played by portal and windows margins: triangular pediments, frames, shallow - cut cornices. Modelled ornamentation is not used in the church, common and circle brick which replaced plinth is used both as building and ornamental material. The facades are plastered and limed The characteristic feature of the interior is its opening upwards. It is a five - chamber pillarless temple crowded by five domes. The top is designed in traditional Ukrainian style - with fractures. The walls are white washed. The domes and crosses are gilded.|$|E

I conceive this to be sufficient width for the proposed road at the present, but where it can with ease and convenience be done, I would prefer the road to be made sixteen feet wideFourth, the road for the present is to terminate about the center of Bathurst Plains on the bank of Macquarie River, carrying the road as near to the banks of that river as practicable.|$|E

40|$|Based on {{symmetry}} properties, polarimetric {{remote sensing}} of geophysical media is studied. From {{the viewpoint of}} symmetry groups, media with reflection, rotation, azimuthal, and <b>centrical</b> symmetries are considered. The symmetries impose relations among polarimetric scattering coefficients, which are valid to all scattering mechanisms in the symmetrical configurations. Various orientation distributions of non-spherical scatterers can be identified from the scattering coefficients by a comparison with the symmetry calculations. Experimental observations are then analyzed for many geophysical scenes acquired with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) airborne polarimetric SAR at microwave frequencies over sea ice and vegetation. Polarimetric characteristics of different ice types are compared with symmetry behaviors. The polarimetric response of a tropical rain forest reveals characteristics close to the <b>centrical</b> symmetry properties, {{which can be used}} as a distributed target to relatively calibrate polarimetric radars without any deployment of manmade calibration targets...|$|E

40|$|Relationships among polarimetric {{backscattering}} coefficients {{are derived}} {{from the viewpoint of}} symmetry groups. For both reciprocal and non-reciprocal media, symmetry encountered in remote sensing due to reflection, rotation, azimuthal, and <b>centrical</b> symmetry groups is considered. The derived properties are general and valid to all scattering mechanisms, including volume and surface scatterings and their interactions, in a given symmetrical configuration. The scattering coefficients calculated from theoretical models for layer random media and rough surfaces are shown to obey the symmetry relations. Use of symmetry properties in remote sensing of structural and environmental responses of scattering media is also discussed. Orientations of spheroidal scatterers described by spherical, uniform, planophile, plagiothile, erectophile, and extremophile distributions are considered to derive their polarimetric backscattering characteristics. These distributions can be identified from the observed scattering coefficients by comparison with theoretical symmetry calculations. A new parameter is then defined to study scattering structures in geophysical media. Observations from polarimetric data acquired by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory airborne synthetic aperture radar over forests, sea ice, and sea surface are presented. Experimental evidences of the symmetry relationships are shown and their use in polarimetric remote sensing is illustrated. For forests, the coniferous forest in Mt. Shasta area (California) and mixed forest near Presque Isle (Maine) exhibit characteristics of the <b>centrical</b> symmetry at C-band. For sea ice in the Beaufort Sea, multi-year sea ice has a cross-polarized ratio e close to e(sub 0), calculated from symmetry, due to the randomness in the scattering structure. First-year sea ice has e much smaller than e(sub 0) due to the preferential alignment of the columnar structure of the ice. From polarimetric data of a sea surface in the Bering Sea, it is observed that e and e(sub 0) are increasing with incident angle and e is greater than e(sub 0) at L-band because of the directional feature of sea surface waves.

40|$|Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) {{refers to}} a group of locationally {{dispensed}} and dedicated sensors that observe and record physical and environmental conditions and coordinate the aggregated data at a <b>centrical</b> location. To serve new applications, localization is largely used in WSNs to define the current location of the sensor nodes. In this paper, first, the proposed mN/ 2 algorithms performance compared with GPS, 3 N, 3 / 2 N and 3 / 2 N(2) algorithms. The mN/ 2 algorithm is especially effective in very sparse networks where other algorithms usually fail. Even when the algorithm cannot locate a given node, it produces a polygonal estimate of the region in which the node is located. Monte Carlo simulations show that this algorithm performs better than other algorithms. Secondly, Uniform, Beta, Weibull, Gamma and Generalized Pareto distributed networks were used for localization using the mN/ 2 algorithm. The localization performance of the networks are evaluated and compared using MATLAB simulations...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the relations among polarimetric backscattering coefficients {{from the viewpoint}} of symmetry groups. Symmetry of geophysical media encountered in remote sensing due to reflection, rotation, azimuthal, and <b>centrical</b> symmetry groups is considered for both reciprocal and nonreciprocal cases. On the basis of the invariance under symmetry transformations in the linear polarization basis, the scattering coefficients are related by a set of equations which restrict the number of independent parameters in the polarimetric covariance matrix. The properties derived under these transformations are general and apply to all scattering mechanisms in a given symmetrical configuration. The scattering coefficients calculated from theoretical models for layer random media and rough surfaces are shown to obey the derived symmetry relations. Use of symmetry properties in remote sensing of structural and environmental responses of scattering media is discussed. As a practical application, the results from this paper provide new methods for the external calibration of polarimetric radars without the deployment of man-made calibration targets. 1...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} avoid pancake type {{collapse}} of existing old R/C buildings during severe earthquakes, {{it is necessary to}} evaluate axial load carrying capacity of existing R/C columns with poor reinforcing details and low concrete strength. Such columns are vulnerable to fail in shear. Objectives of this study are to examine the axial load carrying capacity of R/C columns after shear failure. We paid special attention to confining effects of hoop reinforcement depending on their reinforcing details and concrete strength. For this purpose static loading tests of R/C columns were conducted. Thirty nine 180 mm square section R/C columns with the height of 360 mm were tested. Main variables were the details of hoop reinforcement and concrete strength.
