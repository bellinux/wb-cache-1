5|$|Bush was displeased {{with being}} rushed into making the second album. She set {{up her own}} {{publishing}} company, Kate Bush Music, and her own management company, Novercia, to maintain complete control over her work. Members of her family, along with Bush herself, composed the company's board of directors. Following the album's release, she was required by EMI to undertake heavy promotional work and an exhausting tour. The tour, named The Tour of Life, began in April 1979 and lasted six weeks. This live show was co-devised and performed on stage with magician Simon Drake. Typical of her determination to have creative control, {{she was involved in}} every aspect of the production, choreography, set design and staff recruitment for the show. The shows were noted for her dancing, complex lighting and her 17 costume changes per show. Because of her intention to dance as she sang, her sound engineers used a wire <b>coat</b> <b>hanger</b> and a radio microphone to fashion the first headset microphone to be used by a rock performer since the Swedish group the Spotnicks used a very primitive version in the early 1960s.|$|E

25|$|After {{approximately}} {{two hours of}} captivity, Norris killed Ledford by strangling her with a wire <b>coat</b> <b>hanger,</b> which he tightened with pliers.

The bottles of acid found at Bittaker's motel, Norris stated, were intended for use upon the next victim they abducted.|$|E
2500|$|SMU and Texas A {{both were}} in the Southwest Conference (1915-1996). A group of cadet in Corp decided {{that the best way}} to prepare for the SMU game was to {{fabricate}} spurs hand-made from <b>coat</b> <b>hangers,</b> with rowels made from flattened bottle caps. [...] "Spur them Ponies" [...] was the battle cry. The Sunday prior to the A game saw hundreds of fish out in the quad, pounding bottle caps, punching holes in their centers, and bending <b>coat</b> <b>hangers.</b> The <b>coat</b> <b>hangers</b> had to be bent just so, to keep the spurs attached to the shoes, without doing permanent damage to the required spit-shine.

500|$|... "The Doctor's Wife" [...] {{features}} a makeshift TARDIS console, which was piloted by the Doctor and Idris. The console {{was designed by}} Susannah Leah, a schoolgirl from Todmorden, who won a competition on Blue Peter, a children's programme that challenged its viewers to imagine a TARDIS console based on household objects. Leah's design was selected by Moffat, Edward Thomas, the production designer for the previous series, and Tim Levell, a Blue Peter editor, along with final input among the three age-group winners from Smith. Michael Pickwoad, the production designer for Series 6, commented that Leah's design captured the nature of [...] "bits and pieces" [...] of what TARDIS consoles {{have been in the}} past, as well as the nature of the makeshift console needed for this episode. The drawing was redesigned faithfully by the production team into the prop for the show, including the use of a <b>coat</b> <b>hanger</b> to start the makeshift TARDIS. Leah was brought by Blue Peter to see both the set under construction and on location during filming of the makeshift TARDIS scenes, meeting Smith and the other actors and production crew. Character Options will release a toy playset based on Leah's console later in 2011. The House planetoid in the pocket universe was filmed on location at a quarry outside Cardiff.|$|E
2500|$|In {{reference}} to the actual murders, Norris stated that after he unsuccessfully attempted to strangle Lucinda Schaefer, Bittaker had strangled her with a wire <b>coat</b> <b>hanger.</b> The pair had then thrown her body into a location {{at or near the}} San Dimas Canyon. In {{reference to}} the murder of Andrea Hall, Norris stated he had been told by Bittaker to drive to a nearby store to purchase alcohol when Hall was murdered, after which he returned to find Bittaker, smiling and holding Polaroid pictures he had taken of Hall after informing her he intended to kill her. With reference to victims Jacqueline Lamp and Jackie Gilliam, Norris stated that the two girls were held captive for [...] "over a day" [...] before being murdered, adding that Bittaker had killed Gilliam before he himself bludgeoned Lamp about the head as Bittaker strangled her. When discussing the abuse and torture of Shirley Lynette Ledford, Norris stated he had, upon the insistence of Bittaker, committed the actual murder of Ledford, adding Bittaker had informed him that [...] "I should kill her, because I hadn't killed anyone yet. I knew this was coming, so I agreed." [...] Norris then confessed to having killed Ledford by strangling her with a <b>coat</b> <b>hanger,</b> which he had tightened with pliers in much the same manner Bittaker had with previous victims Lucinda Schaefer and Jacqueline Lamp. Norris then stated the pair had driven to Sunland, where he discarded Shirley Ledford's body upon the front lawn as Bittaker waited in his van.|$|E
2500|$|In their {{subsequent}} {{accounts of the}} actual murder, Bittaker and Norris have given differing accounts as to who argued over whether they should kill her rather than release her: each stated the other argued that they should kill her. In any event, Schaefer pleaded for [...] "only a second, to pray," [...] before Norris attempted to manually strangle her. After approximately 45 seconds, he became disturbed at [...] "the look in her eyes" [...] {{and ran to the}} front of the van, vomiting. Bittaker then manually strangled Schaefer until she collapsed to the ground and began convulsing. He then twisted a wire <b>coat</b> <b>hanger</b> around her neck with vise-grip pliers until Schaefer's convulsions ceased. Lucinda Schaefer was denied her requests to pray before Bittaker and Norris killed her.|$|E

5000|$|There {{are three}} basic types of clothes hangers. The {{first is the}} wire hanger, which has a simple loop of wire, most often steel, in a {{flattened}} triangle shape that continues into a hook at the top.

Some wooden hangers have a rounded bar from tip to tip, forming a flattened triangle. This bar is designed to hang the trousers belonging to the jacket.
