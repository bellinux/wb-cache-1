The main station entrance and ventilation building {{consists of four}} escalators and an elevator {{on the west side}} of Hudson Boulevard between 33rd and 34th Streets. The main entrance has a turtle shell-shaped glass canopy above it that allows light to shine on the upper mezzanine. The elevator is located south of 34th Street in Hudson Park, while the escalator entrance is located further east, closer to the boulevard. At the time of construction, the ventilation building was designed so developers <b>could</b> <b>built</b> on top of it later. The 55 Hudson Yards skyscraper, whose structure is partially atop the ventilation tower, started construction in January 2015, and pictures in May 2016 showed that the skyscraper had so far been constructed to the height of the ventilation tower.|$|E

Up to 8,000 workers were forced into this. The fort could house 22,000 soldiers and 3,000 horses. The French only withdrew after the Treaty of Ryswick (Rijswijk) had been signed in 1697, ending the Nine Years' War (known in Germany as the Pfälzischer Erbfolgekrieg, or War of the Palatine Succession).

5|$|Various {{methods were}} used to build mottes.

50|$|In his proposal, Dr. Dräger put the KFT on {{the same}} {{priority}} as U-Boats. For him, capital ships had not been proven useful in the war and larger carriers would take too long to build. He preferred safety in numbers and mass-produced ships over speed (Citing the HMS Glorious with {{a top speed of}} 31.6kn as an example). A smaller design also had the advantage that smaller shipyards <b>could</b> <b>built</b> the carrier. However, with all German shipyards being occupied with U-Boat construction, the KFT construction would have to be taken over by foreign shipyards in occupied territories. Scheduled projects in these shipyards for 1943 and 1944 would have to be delayed, because they would become overall less important to the war effort than the aircraft carrier. In his original proposal of January 1942, Dr. Dräger projected that the first ship would have completed testing by April 1943. The mass production for the next 100 ships would begin at the end of 1943 and they would be ready for duty at the end of 1944.|$|E

5000|$|What {{was needed}} however was a labor force with {{abilities}} to accomplish heavy industrial and mechanical work. To find this labor, recruiting was directed towards {{areas of the}} nation's hinterland which {{had only a few}} years before found themselves {{in the depths of the}} Great Depression in the not mistaken belief that men used to keeping farm machinery operating <b>could</b> <b>built</b> ships as well. To get these former farmers to decide to take up shipbuilding was not too difficult an undertaking because the wages offered to these previously poor men were much higher had ever been offered to such working class Americans before. This opportunity to earn a good working man's wage showed the way to a possible future where life might provide better security than in the poverty years of the 1930s and that was all that was needed to get people on the move. It was not uncommon for entire families to make the pilgrimage from places such as the Dust Bowl regions of Texas and Oklahoma to the shipbuilding centers on the West Coast or the Gulf of Mexico. With such a rapid influx of new workers to these communities however there were acute shortages in housing, schools and other needed services. Along with building new shipyards and ships, there was a need to build all the necessities for many workers to live in most of the largest shipbuilding centers such as Richmond, California and Portland, Oregon. Needless to say that just about any skilled trade had steady employment in those communities throughout the course of the war. Some skilled workers such as engineers were [...] "frozen" [...] in their jobs and were not allowed to leave their work, even to enlist.|$|E

40|$|Key words: dance - body - corporeality - dance {{aesthetics}} - {{aesthetic experience}} - phenomenology - Maxine Sheets-Johnstone - contemporary dance Abstact: Dance's various forms and appearances are connected through one universal aspect - {{the presence of}} corporeality as represented by the moving human body. The role {{and the experience of}} body is essential for the description of dance even in its aesthetical and philosophical interpretation. First of all, this diploma theses aims to map the field of aesthetics and philosophy of dance from wider historical perspective and consequently to find support in dance basic division and its connected experiences in practice of inner ecstatic immersion. Furthermore, the focus is also given to the type of experience that is subordinated to visual effect of dance. This foundation is further elaborated in second part of this thesis, which discusses dance experience in its aesthetic dimension through context of phenomenological philosophy in thinking of Maxine Sheets-Johnstone. This concept of dance reveals other important qualities in dance as an art. In addition, it shows one of novel approaches to corporeality in the aesthetic experience of dance, which <b>could</b> <b>built</b> on the dichotomous differentiation of the dance experience and open new perspectives on the aesthetic [...] ...|$|E
