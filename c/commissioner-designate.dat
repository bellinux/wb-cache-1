25|$|Bulgaria's initial candidate, Rumiana Jeleva, {{was forced}} to step down due to {{opposition}} from MEPs, mainly the PES, who questioned her suitability and financial interests despite backing from the EPP (to which her national party belongs). Bulgaria rapidly submitted Kristalina Georgieva, but this forced the vote on the commission to be delayed weeks so Georgieva's hearings could be arranged. The only other <b>commissioner-designate</b> to lack support was returning commissioner Neelie Kroes, who was also seen to perform poorly in her hearing. However, she was invited back and secured more support, indicating she will get approval from Parliament.|$|E

Lane, {{who was living}} in north Berkeley while awaiting Senate confirmation, hurried to the city {{within hours of the}} earthquake to do what he could to help. Mayor Eugene E. Schmitz immediately appointed him to the Committee of Fifty to deal with the devastation of the earthquake and subsequent fire, and plan the rebuilding of the city. According to Lane's friend, writer Will Irwin, Lane did not content himself with committee work, but personally fought the fire, helping to save much of the Western Addition. [...] In late April, the <b>commissioner-designate</b> took the train east to Washington, where he unsuccessfully fought to obtain Federal money to help the city's recovery.|$|E
2500|$|On 18 November 2004, Farage {{announced}} in the European Parliament that Jacques Barrot, then French <b>Commissioner-designate,</b> had been barred from elected office in France for two years, after being convicted in 2000 of embezzling £2 million from government funds and diverting it into the coffers of his party. He said that French President Jacques Chirac had granted Barrot amnesty; initial BBC reports said that, under French law, it was perhaps illegal to mention that conviction. The prohibition in question applies only to French officials {{in the course of}} their duties. The President of the Parliament, Josep Borrell, enjoined him to retract his comments under threat of [...] "legal consequences". The following day, it was confirmed that Barrot had received an eight-month suspended jail sentence in the case, and that this had been quickly expunged by the amnesty decided by Chirac and his parliamentary majority. The Socialist and Liberal groups in the European Parliament then joined forces with UKIP in demanding the resignation of Barrot for failing to disclose the conviction during his confirmation hearings.|$|E

50|$|Jeleva was Bulgaria's {{nominee for}} European Commissioner for International Cooperation, Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Response. During her January 2010 {{confirmation}} hearing, she repeatedly failed {{to answer questions}} regarding allegations over her financial interests. She also failed to demonstrate sufficient competence in the areas she was to oversee. Her defensive and seemingly arrogant attitude and her poor language skills further jeopardized her candidacy. Facing a storm of disapproval at home, on January 19, 2010, Jeleva sent a letter of resignation to Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov, stepping down as both <b>commissioner-designate</b> and Minister of Foreign Affairs, and {{putting an end to}} her political career. She was replaced as <b>commissioner-designate</b> by Kristalina Georgieva and as Minister of Foreign Affairs by Nikolay Mladenov.|$|E

5000|$|On 10 September 2014 Lord Hill was {{announced}} as EU <b>Commissioner-designate</b> for the Financial Stability, Financial Services and Capital Markets Union portfolio in the forthcoming Juncker Commission.

He {{was one of four}} appointees who allegedly [...] "struggled to impress" [...] at their initial confirmation hearings before the European Parliament, and was required to appear for a second hearing — leading some hostile MEPs to start speculating that his appointment could be revoked in a reshuffle. With some [...] "diplomatic smoothing of the way by Juncker", Hill it is said [...] "managed" [...] to give satisfactory answers as to the UK's position regarding European banking union.|$|E
