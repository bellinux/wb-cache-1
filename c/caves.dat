5|$|In 2000, glacier <b>caves</b> were {{discovered}} on the then-smooth glacier surface. Many of these glacier <b>caves</b> were {{big enough to}} explore, like the glacier <b>caves</b> on the summit of Mount Rainier. Most of the glacier <b>caves</b> were located near the 1980s lava dome, where hot steam and volcanic gas emissions from hidden fumaroles on the crater floor or lava dome melted holes in the young glacial ice. About 7,900 feet or 2.4km of underground <b>caves</b> and passageways in the glacier were mapped and studied.|$|E

5|$|In 1906, Balch started {{investigating}} the Iron Age cave dwellers in Wookey Hole <b>Caves,</b> {{embarking on a}} four-year study of the <b>caves</b> along {{with other members of}} the Mendip Nature Research Committee. The group mapped the <b>caves,</b> drew illustrations of their finds and took photographs, collecting the information in the 1914 book Wookey Hole: its <b>Caves</b> and Cave-Dwellers. When giving lectures on the cave dwellers, he would compare them to Eskimos, drawing parallels in their art and hunting styles, and would show pictures of the tools used by the cave dwellers that he discovered in Wookey Hole <b>Caves,</b> as well as items such as brooches and child's play toys. He also told of a goat-herd he discovered in a cave who had died, leaving his goats tethered, subsequently perishing.|$|E

5|$|The {{ancient history}} of the island is unknown in either Hindu or Buddhist records. Archeological studies have {{uncovered}} many remains that suggest the small island had a rich cultural past, with evidence of human settlement by possibly the 2nd century BC.
