5|$|<b>Cabin</b> <b>in</b> the Cotton (1932) is a Warner Bros. message {{film about}} the evils of capitalism. The film takes place in an {{unspecified}} southern state where workers are given barely enough to survive and taken advantage of by being charged exorbitant interest rates and high prices by unscrupulous landowners. The film is decidedly anti-capitalist; however, its preface claims otherwise: In the end, however, the planters admit their wrongdoing and agree to a more equitable distribution of capital.|$|E

5|$|Federal law {{states that}} {{national}} parks {{will have the}} same underage laws as the state that they are located in, and the Assimilative Crimes Act is applicable to New Jersey's underage drinking statute. Thus, in a private location, such as a <b>cabin</b> <b>in</b> a federal enclave in New Jersey, a parent can serve alcohol to their child, and an underage person can possess and consume alcohol. Outside of these exceptions, underage drinking and serving alcohol to a minor are federal misdemeanors, punishable by a fine and up to 6 months in jail. There is a five-year statute of limitations for DUI, underage drinking, and other alcohol violations that take place in federal enclaves.|$|E

5|$|In 1795, Rowan began {{construction}} of Federal Hill, his family estate, on land that his father-in-law gave {{him as a}} wedding present. Due to limited financial resources, {{the time required to}} import building materials from the east, and the craftsmanship required to construct the large home, the mansion was not completed until 1818. After a fire destroyed the log <b>cabin</b> <b>in</b> which the Rowans lived in 1812, they moved into the part of the mansion that was completed, and continued to live there while construction {{on the rest of the}} house was finished. Federal Hill was once believed to be the first brick house constructed in the state of Kentucky, but more contemporary sources give the designation to the William Whitley House, also known as Sportsman's Hill, which was completed in 1794 near Crab Orchard, Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|In {{the remains}} of a small <b>cabin</b> <b>in</b> the bow of the ship and in a few other {{locations}} around the wreck was found the earliest dated set of navigation instruments in Europe found so far: compasses, divider calipers, a stick used for charting, protractors, sounding leads, tide calculators and a logreel, an instrument for calculating speed. Several of these objects are not only unique in having such an early, definite dating, but also because they pre-date written records of their use; protractors would have reasonably been used to measure bearings and courses on maps, but sea charts are not known to have been used by English navigators {{during the first half of}} the 16th century, compasses were not depicted on English ships until the 1560s, and the first mention of a logreel is from 1574.|$|E
5|$|James Garfield {{was born}} the {{youngest}} of five children on November 19, 1831, in a log <b>cabin</b> <b>in</b> Orange Township, now Moreland Hills, Ohio. Orange Township {{had been in the}} Western Reserve until 1800, and like many who settled there, Garfield's ancestors were from New England, his ancestor, Edward Garfield immigrating from Hillmorton, Warwickshire, England, to Massachusetts in around 1630. James' father Abram had been born in Worcester, New York, and came to Ohio to woo his childhood sweetheart, Mehitabel Ballou, only to find her married. He instead wed her sister Eliza, who had been born in New Hampshire. James was named for an older brother, dead in infancy.|$|E

Frank, an offender profiler, deduces that Bangs' controlling personality would cause him to take his daughter somewhere he knows, and realizes that they will be in the family's holiday <b>cabin</b> <b>in</b> the woods. A police manhunt begins, and Bangs is arrested without Sara coming to harm.|$|E

Meanwhile, using a {{photograph}} from Renault's home and the clues from Cooper's dream, the investigators find a log <b>cabin</b> <b>in</b> the woods that {{they believe to be}} the scene of the murder; on the floor Cooper finds a fragment of a One Eyed Jacks casino chip that matches the piece found in Laura's stomach, and Truman finds Waldo, the caged myna bird.|$|E
5|$|Segrè's group set up its {{equipment}} in a disused Forest Service <b>cabin</b> <b>in</b> the Pajarito Canyon near Los Alamos in August 1943. His group's {{task was to}} measure and catalog the radioactivity of various fission products. An important line of research was determining the degree of isotope enrichment achieved with various samples of enriched uranium. Initially, the tests using mass spectrometry, used by Columbia University, and neutron assay, used by Berkeley, gave different results. Segrè studied Berkeley's results and could find no error, while Kenneth Bainbridge likewise found no fault with New York's. However, analysis of another sample showed close agreement. Higher rates of spontaneous fission were observed at Los Alamos, which Segrè's group concluded were due to cosmic rays, which were more prevalent at Los Alamos due to its high altitude.|$|E

5|$|The {{accident}} {{had a large}} {{impact on}} the community, with only 1,600 {{people living in the}} two Russian settlements. The population in the communities do not speak Norwegian, and do not have a road connection to Longyearbyen. This made it difficult for the Governor to give accurate and detailed information. Issues were further complicated by erroneous reports in Russian media that there were five survivors. The Governor's <b>cabin</b> <b>in</b> Barentsburg was manned during the aftermath, and bulletins were distributed with updated information in Russian. The accident was one of the triggers causing Arktikugol to abandon Pyramiden in 1998.|$|E

Black apologizes for keeping information from Tom, but warns him that his outburst is exactly why he did so. Watts has meanwhile tracked forensic evidence from the abandoned car to a <b>cabin</b> <b>in</b> the woods; blood found there matches both Green and Helen, and a ring is discovered which is identified as Helen's wedding ring.|$|E
5|$|Uncle Tom's Cabin first {{appeared}} as a 40-week serial in The National Era, an abolitionist periodical, starting with the June 5, 1851, issue. It was originally intended as a shorter narrative that would run {{for only a few}} weeks. Stowe expanded the story significantly, however, and it was instantly popular, such that several protests were sent to the Era office when she missed an issue. Because of the story's popularity, the publisher John P. Jewett contacted Stowe about turning the serial into a book. While Stowe questioned if anyone would read Uncle Tom's <b>Cabin</b> <b>in</b> book form, she eventually consented to the request.|$|E
