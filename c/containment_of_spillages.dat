30|$|The risk <b>of</b> <b>spillage</b> during removal <b>of</b> dermoid cysts is {{independent}} of age, operative technique or cyst size [6]. Concomitant oophorectomy, however, does reduce the chance <b>of</b> <b>spillage,</b> as does surgeon experience when laparoscopy, but not laparotomy, is performed.|$|R
30|$|Most {{operative}} textbooks describe classic {{treatment for}} dermoid cysts as ovarian cystectomy or oophorectomy through laparotomy, with utmost care necessary to avoid <b>spillage</b> <b>of</b> cyst contents. Although laparoscopic surgery has replaced many standard laparotomy techniques, many skeptical opinions remained about role of laparoscopic surgery for dermoid cyst removal. The potential fear <b>of</b> <b>spillage</b> <b>of</b> cyst material and possible development of chemical peritonitis imposed fears about adopting the laparoscopic approach [4, 9]. The phobia <b>of</b> <b>spillage</b> complications existed until recently challenged by many laparoscopists [4, 9]. Accordingly, the laparoscopic approach {{has become increasingly}} accepted and more commonly adopted since 1989 [4].|$|R

The relative risk <b>of</b> <b>spillage</b> among patients subjected to SPA-PLS was 4.43 (95 % CI 1.45 - 13.53). Adnexal conserving surgery was more frequently performed in SPA-HALS than in SPA-PLS (76.7 % vs. 43.8 %, p[*]<[*] 0.001).

40|$|The {{significance}} <b>of</b> <b>spillage</b> <b>of</b> {{tumor cells}} into the abdominal cavity by fine needle aspiration or rupture of adnexel masses {{in case of}} malignancy is the focus. However, the appearance rate of malignant cells in cyst fluid by fine needle aspiration has been quite variable. We therefore evaluated the appearance rate of malignant cells in the cyst fluid from malignant ovarian tumors. Our study population included 29 women with malignant ovarian tumor who attended two hospitals between November 1995 and October 1998. Cyst fluid samples were aspirated from the tumors immediately after the removal of tumor. All cytologic and histologic preparations were reviewed by investigators {{who did not know}} any information of the tissues. A considerable number of viable malignant cells were found in twenty two of 26 adnexal malignancies (84. 6 %). There {{was no significant difference in}} the appearance of viable tumor cells among different histologic types of tumor. Four negative cases included 3 mucinous tumors of borderline malignancy and one endometrioid adenocarcima (G 1). The cyst fluid of most of the malignant ovarian tumor contains viable tumor cells, suggesting the risk <b>of</b> <b>spillage</b> <b>of</b> malignant tumor cells. On the other hand, there may be decreased risk <b>of</b> <b>spillage</b> <b>of</b> malignant tumor cells in mucinous tumors of borderline malignancy...|$|R

5000|$|Whole bowel {{irrigation}} {{is sometimes}} used prior to colonoscopy, bowel surgery, other abdominal/pelvic surgery, or a barium enema examination, to cleanse the intestines, enhancing visibility of the intestines' inner surfaces, preventing complications from occurring {{as a result}} <b>of</b> <b>spillage</b> <b>of</b> bowel contents into the abdominal cavity, and potentially providing other benefits {{depending on the type}} of procedure being performed.|$|R
50|$|During laparoscopic cholecystectomy, {{gallbladder}} perforation {{can occur}} due to excessive traction during retraction or during dissection from the liver bed. It can also occur during extraction from the abdomen. Infected bile, pigment gallstones, male gender, advanced age, perihepatic location of spilled gallstones, more than 15 gallstones {{and an average}} size greater than 1.5 cm {{have been identified as}} risk factors for complications. Spilled gallstones can be a diagnostic challenge and can cause significant morbidity to the patient. Clear documentation <b>of</b> <b>spillage</b> and explanation to the patient is of utmost importance, as this will enable prompt recognition and treatment of any complications.

40|$|Two {{laboratory}} studies have investigated how handwriting ability {{and holding a}} cup of liquid depend {{on the characteristics of}} whole-body vertical vibration. The effects of vibration magnitude (0. 16 to 2. 5 ms− 2 r. m. s.), vibration frequency (0. 5 to 10 Hz), and vibration duration (2 cycles to 10 s) on handwriting were studied with 20 subjects. Subjects were asked to copy letters of the alphabet by writing on a hand-held surface. Writing speed decreased and subjective ratings of writing difficulty increased with increasing vibration magnitude, particularly in the frequency range 4 to 8 Hz. Writing difficulty also increased with increasing duration of vibration. A 10 s exposure to 5 Hz vibration at 20 ms− 2 r. m. s. resulted in subjective estimates corresponding to ‘extremely difficult’. The effects of vibration magnitude (0. 63 to 1. 6 ms− 2 r. m. s.), vibration frequency (0 - 5 to 10 Hz), and vibration duration (2 cycles to 10 s) on the spilling of liquid from a hand-held cup were also investigated in a group of 20 subjects. The probability of spilling the liquid, the quantity of liquid spilt, and subject's estimates of the probability <b>of</b> <b>spillage</b> were determined for all conditions. Greatest interference with the task occurred at 4 Hz, with the lowest vibration magnitude (0. 63 ms− 2 r. m. s.) causing measured and estimated <b>spillage</b> probabilities <b>of</b> approximately 85 %. The interference was much less at other frequencies, with 0. 63 ms− 2 r. m. s. causing less than 10 % measured probability <b>of</b> <b>spillage</b> below 3 Hz and above 5 Hz. The estimated probability <b>of</b> <b>spillage</b> was generally greater than the observed probability <b>of</b> <b>spillage</b> when the spillage probability was low, but less than the observed probability when the spillage probability was high. Increasing the duration of vibration increased the probability <b>of</b> <b>spillage,</b> and also increased the volume of liquid spilt. © 1991 Taylor & Francis, Ltd. </p...|$|R

40|$|Antimicrobial drug {{resistance}} (AMR) is {{widely recognized as}} a global public health threat because it endangers the effectiveness of treatment of infectious diseases. In 2001 WHO issued the Global Strategy for <b>Containment</b> <b>of</b> Antimicrobial Resistance, but it has proved difficult to translate {{the recommendations of the}} Global Strategy into effective public health actions. The purpose of the Antimicrobial Resistance Containment and Surveillance (ARCS) approach is to facilitate the formulation of public health programmes and the mobilization of human and financial resources for the <b>containment</b> <b>of</b> AMR. The ARCS approach highlights the fundamental link between rational drug use and <b>containment</b> <b>of</b> AMR. Clinical management of human and animal infections should be improved through better disease control and prevention, high quality diagnostic testing, appropriate treatment regimens and consumer health education. At the same time, systems for supplying antimicrobial drugs should include appropriate regulations, lists of essential drugs, and functional mechanisms for the approval and delivery <b>of</b> drugs. <b>Containment</b> <b>of</b> AMR is defined in the ARCS approach as the continuous application of this package of core interventions. Surveillance of the extent and trends of antimicrobial resistance as well as the supply, selection and use of antimicrobial drugs should be established to monitor the process and outcome <b>of</b> <b>containment</b> <b>of</b> AMR. The ARCS approach is represented in the ARCS diagram (Fig. 2) which provides a simplified, but comprehensive illustration of the complex problem <b>of</b> <b>containment</b> and monitoring <b>of</b> AMR...|$|R
