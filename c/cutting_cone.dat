A series of standard taps with a <b>cutting</b> <b>cone</b> angle of 7 ° 30 ′ were prepared from high-speed steel W 9 and used to tap Nickel-based superalloy GH 4169.

40|$|The {{collagen}} {{architecture of}} secondary osteons was studied with {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM) employing the fractured cortex technique and osmic maceration. Fibrillar orientation and the change in their direction in sequential lamellae was documented where lamellar formation was ongoing, {{as well as in}} resorption pits where osteoclasts had exposed the collagen organisation of the underlying layers. Applying an adaptive stereo matching technique, the mean thickness of matrix layers removed by osteoclasts was 1. 36 ± 0. 45 μm. It was also documented that osteoclasts do not attack the cellular membrane of the exposed osteocytes. The mean linear osteoblast density in fractured hemicanals was assessed with SEM and no significant differences were observed comparing larger with smaller central canal osteons. These findings suggested a balance between the differentiated osteoblasts that have aligned {{on the surface of the}} <b>cutting</b> <b>cone</b> and those that are transformed into osteocytes, because the canal surface is progressively reduced as the lamellar apposition advances...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Based on the {{theoretical}} principle of tapping formation and simulation with modified-tooth tap, {{the relationship among}} the different geometric parameters of the tap was further analyzed. A series of modified-tooth taps and standard ones with a <b>cutting</b> <b>cone</b> angle of 7 ° 30 ´and a outer diameter of M 6, which were made from high-speed steel W 9, were taken to do the comparative tapping test on nickel-based high-temperature alloy GH 4169, titanium alloy TC 4 and 45 steel. The test {{results indicated that the}} leading cause of difficult tapping in GH 4169 and TC 4 was the largeness of their friction torques which were about 35 % and 62 % of tapping torque respectively, where the frictional wear was a fundamental reason for tough tapping GH 4169 and the spring back of machined surface for TC 4. The obvious decreases of friction torque with the modified-tooth tap approximately 70 % and 50 % respectively for GH 4169 and TC 4 were attributed to its unique tapping formation principle of generating broaching but no remarkable effects on 45 steel in comparison with standard tap...|$|E

This paper presents evidence suppor ting this hypothesis. Cross-bred, adult, female sheep were exposed to a three-hour exposure at 2. 8 - 3. 2 atm abs, using an ex-per imental hyperbar ic chamber. They showed signs of bends in var ious legs soon after the exposure. Eight weeks after decompression insult, more or less marked and extensive pathologic findings of the bone marrow tissue were noted {{at the time of}} autopsy in their tibiae. In three tibiae of seven exper imental????sheep, a wide spread necrosis was found in the bone marrow, par ticular ly in the upper half of the shaft. In one of them, the large branches including the main ascending branch of the intraosseous nutr ient ar tery were obliterated by organized thrombi at a little above the middle por tion of the shaft of the r ight tibia. This ar ter ial lesion seemed closely related to a widespread necrosis of the bone marrow of upper half of the shaft.

40|$|Osteon {{diameter}} {{is generally}} smaller in bone regions that experience larger strains. A mechanism relating osteon diameter to strain {{is as yet}} unknown. We propose that strain-induced osteocyte signals inhibit osteoclastic bone resorption. This mechanism was previously shown to produce load-aligned osteons in computer simulations. Now we find that it also predicts smaller osteon diameter for higher loads. Additionally, we find that our model predicts osteon development with two <b>cutting</b> <b>cones,</b> one moving up and one moving down the loading axis. Such ‘double-ended osteons’ were reported in literature as a common type of osteon development. Further, we find that a steep gradient in strain magnitude can result in an osteonal tunnel with continuous resorption along the less strained side, which corresponds to ‘drifting osteons’ reported in literature...|$|R
40|$|Throughout life, human bone is renewed {{continuously}} in {{a tightly}} controlled sequence of resorption and formation. This process of bone remodeling is remarkable {{because it involves}} cells from different lineages, collaborating in so-called basic multicellular units (BMUs) within small spatial and temporal boundaries. Moreover, the newly formed (secondary) osteons are aligned to the dominant load direction and have a density related to its magnitude, thus creating a globally optimized mechanical structure. Although the existence of BMUs is amply described, the cellular mechanisms driving bone remodeling—particularly the alignment process—are poorly understood. In this study we present a theory that explains bone remodelling as a self-organizing process of mechanical adaptation. Osteocytes thereby act as sensors of strain-induced fluid flow. Physiological loading produces stasis of extracellular fluid {{in front of the}} <b>cutting</b> <b>cone</b> of a tunneling osteon, which will lead to osteocytic disuse and (continued) attraction of osteoclasts. However, around the resting zone and the closing cone, enhanced extracellular fluid flow occurs, which will activate osteocytes to recruit osteoblasts. Thus, cellular activity at a bone remodeling site is well related to local fluid flow patterns, which may explain the coordinated progression of a BMU...|$|E
40|$|Purpose of review: Significant {{progress}} has been made in the field of mechanotransduction in bone cells. The increasing knowledge about the role of the osteocyte as the professional mechanosensor cell of bone, and the lacuno-canalicular porosity as the structure that mediates mechanosensing, might result in a new paradigm for understanding the bone formation response to mechanical loading, and the bone resorption response to disuse. Strain-derived flow of interstitial fluid through the lacuno-canalicular porosity seems to mechanically activate the osteocytes, as well as ensures transport of cell signaling molecules, nutrients, and waste products. This concept allows explanation of local bone gain and loss, as well as remodeling in response to fatigue damage, as processes supervised by mechanosensitive osteocytes. Recent findings: The osteogenic activity of bone cells in vitro have been quantitatively correlated with varying stress stimulations highlighting the importance of the rate of loading. Theoretically, a possible mechanism for the stress response by osteocytes is due to strain-amplification at the pericellular matrix. Hence, single cell studies on molecular responses of osteocytes are on their way. These findings contribute insight on local architectural alignment in bone during remodeling. Alignment seems to occur as a result of the osteocyte's sensing different canalicular flow patterns around <b>cutting</b> <b>cone</b> and reversal zone during loading, thus determining the bone's structure. Summary: Uncovering the cellular and mechanical basis of the osteocyte's response to loading represents a significant challenge to our understanding of cellular mechanotransduction and bone remodeling. © 2005 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins...|$|E
40|$|The current {{model of}} compact bone {{is that of}} a system of {{longitudinal}} (Haversian) canals connected by transverse (Volkmann’s) canals. Models based on histology or microcomputed tomography lack the morphologic detail and sense of temporal development provided by direct observation. Using direct scanning electron microscopy observation, we studied the bone surface and structure of the intracortical canal system in paired fractured surfaces in rabbit femurs, examining density of canal openings on periosteal and endosteal surfaces, internal network nodes and canal sizes, and collagen lining of the inner canal system. The blood supply of the diaphyseal compact bone entered the cortex through the canal openings on the endosteal and periosteal surfaces, with different morphologic features in the midshaft and distal shaft; their density was higher on endosteal than on periosteal surfaces in the midshaft but with no major differences among subregions. The circumference measurements along Haversian canals documented a steady reduction behind the head of the <b>cutting</b> <b>cone</b> but rather random variations as the distance from the head increased. These observations suggested discontinuous development and variable lamellar apposition rate of osteons in different segments of their trajectory. The frequent branching and types of network nodes suggested substantial osteonal plasticity and supported the model of a network organization. The collagen fibers of the canal wall were organized in intertwined, longitudinally oriented bundles with 0. 1 - to 0. 5 -lm holes connecting the canal lumen with the osteocyte canalicular system...|$|E
30|$|Osteotomies {{that are}} closing wedges are akin to optimally reduced fractures. In a low-strain and rigidly stabilised environment, primary bone healing is achieved; {{the gap between}} bone ends is less than 0.01  mm and interfragmentary strain is less than 2 %, {{permitting}} contact-healing to occur. Cutting cones from osteoclasts cross the osteotomy site and create a template for osteoblasts at the rear to lay down new bone. Union and restoration of the Haversian system occur in concert and lamellar bone is formed by direct remodelling [20]. In certain circumstances, a gap between bony surfaces of more than 0.01  mm may exist in which case gap-healing occurs and lamellar bone is laid down between the bone ends, perpendicular to the normal Haversian system. This then undergoes secondary remodelling by <b>cutting</b> <b>cones</b> to orientate itself to the mechanical stress placed on the bone [21].|$|R

An experimental model in the rabbit femur was used to investigate, through central canal morphometry and frequency distribution analysis, the remodelling activity, comparing the middle of the diaphysis (mid-shaft) with the extremity (distal-shaft) and at the same level sectors and layers of the cortex in transversal sections. The study documented a higher density of canals in the mid-shaft than in the distal-shaft and a higher remodelling in the distal-shaft. There {{were no significant differences between}} dorsal, ventral, medial and lateral sectors at both midshaft and distal-shaft levels, while the number of canals was higher in the sub-periosteal layers than in the sub-endosteal.

40|$|The intracortical canal/vessel {{systems of}} long bones {{are not yet}} {{completely}} {{understood in terms of}} their morphology and physiology, mainly because of the difficulty of injecting the small calibre vessels and cutting the calcified matrix.

The femurs of ten rabbits were perfused with a water-soluble dye (China ink) or alcoholic glycerol solution, and the fractured cortex specimens were then examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results document: (1) the fibrillar structure of the canal surfaces; (2) the perivascular environment with cellular components in different phases of incorporation within the bone matrix; (3) previously unreported filamentous structures on the outer surface of vessels, which could be interpreted as non-myelinic nerve fibres; (4) the inner organisation of the <b>cutting</b> <b>cones.</b> Although based exclusively on morphology, these observation have some relevance to increasing knowledge of bone circulation physiology in the cortical bone...|$|R
40|$|The lacunar-canalicular {{system in}} human {{secondary}} osteons was examined by two complementary techniques: light microscopy analysis of undecalcified thick sections and the SEM cortex-fractured surface technique. Unlike the earlier definitions of 'osteoblastic domain' presented as the matrix volume produced by osteoblasts {{in the process}} of osteon infilling, this study measured the domain by the length of osteoblast dendritic processes. The domain extension was defined along radial vectors advancing from the reversal line towards the central canal. According to their lengths, domains were divided into three classes: peripheral, intermediate and internal. The mean length of peripheral domains was significantly shorter than those of the intermediate and internal domains. This suggests that the infilling process is modulated by an initial preparatory phase characterised by osteoblast adhesion to the wall of the <b>cutting</b> <b>cone,</b> and a limited matrix synthesis, followed by a regular matrix volume apposition organised in concentric layers. In addition to the radial canaliculae arranged along converging vectors in planes perpendicular to the central canal, we distinguished a further class of canaliculae, the equatorial canaliculae originating from the major perimeter of the lacuna and spreading out radially in the plane of the same lacuna (therefore, perpendicularly to the radial canaliculae). The whole lacunar-canalicular network was structured as a closed system around the vascular axis of the central canal with very few canaliculae crossing the reversal line and connecting the neighbouring osteons. These anatomical observations contribute to our knowledge of lacunar-canalicular system development. 2012 Blackwell Verlag GmbH...|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} {{osteoclast}} and osteoclast nuclear population kinetics within evolving secondary osteons was undertaken in young adult Beagle dogs. Autoradiographs of serial longitudinal rib biopsy sections taken from 1 hour to 15 days after tritiated thymidine injection were analysed {{as to the}} time and the rate of appearance of the labelled nuclei within the osteoclasts and their nuclei. Such systems contained an average of nine osteoclasts, each containing an average of nine nuclei. Labelled osteoclast nuclei first appeared within 24 hours, peaked at 10 % at 4 days, and declined to 1 % or less after 11. 5 days more. Thus, the entry rate of new nuclei into (and their exit from) the population of osteoclast nuclei under steady state conditions approximates 8 % per day. Therefore, the total mononuclear osteoclast population may be viewed as divided into functional units, i. e. osteoclasts. From the ratio of the osteoclast nuclei in the <b>cutting</b> <b>cone</b> to the number of osteoblasts in the closing cone (as well as from their rates of resorption and formation), it was deduced that the osteoclast per nucleus is approximately 20 - 40 times more efficient than the osteoblast. Because of the intrinsically different efficiencies and life spans of these two cell types, the rates of resorption and formation within evolving Haversian systems and the amounts of bone ultimately resorbed and formed by the system, are determined by the rate and duration of the respective precursor cell proliferation. It is at this level that factors which control the bone remodelling and balance must operate...|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} the origin, {{proliferation}} rate and migration of cells within the secondary evolving Haversian systems was undertaken in young adult Beagle dogs. Autoradiographs of serial longitudinal sections prepared from rib biopsies taken from one hour to eleven days after the injection of tritiated thymidine were subjected to semiquantitative analysis as {{to the time of}} appearance, number, location and transformation of various labelled cells. Numerous labelled osteoblasts appeared early (at 14 - 24 hours) in the most proximal closing cone. With time, this zone was seen to have been left behind the advancing <b>cutting</b> <b>cone</b> and the successive generations of osteoblasts. The first labelled osteocytes were seen at nine days after injection, in the distal closing cone. Labelled nuclei within the osteoclasts were few and appeared late (none before 24 hours). It is apparent that each self renewing cell population within these systems (i. e. osteoclasts, osteoblasts and endothelial cells) derives from its own immediate precursor and evolves at its own speed. The mononuclear osteoclasts' precursors divide locally and infrequently and the turnover of osteoclastic nuclei appears to be slow; consequently their life span and that of the osteoclasts appears to be longer than the time of the observation, i. e. 11 days. The proliferation of osteoblasts' precursors and osteoblasts recruitment is rapid. The life span of osteoblasts was found to be indeterminate; some osteoblasts may become osteocytes within a few days while others may continue to deposit bone for several weeks. Since the recruitment of osteoclastic nuclei is slow while that of the osteoblasts is fast, {{it is unlikely that the}} osteoclasts in the sites of lamellar bone remodelling modulate into osteoblasts...|$|E

40|$|Molecular oxygen is a {{critical}} metabolic regulator that is required to maintain the function and viability of most eukaryotic organisms. Oxygen supply in hard tissues is largely uncharacterized but may play important roles during bone cell maturation and survival. The goal {{of this investigation was}} to elucidate the influence of oxygen availability on the formation, function, and survival of osteocytes in the development and maintenance of skeletal tissue. The Krogh cylinder model of oxygen diffusion was adapted to predict the oxygen distribution within cortical and cancellous structures of unloaded bones. Substantial oxygen gradients were predicted across mature osteons and trabeculae, which suggested that a drop in oxygen tension accompanies the differentiation of surface lining osteoblasts into subsumed osteocytes. A steep oxygen gradient was predicted during the initial stage of osteon formation, when osteoblasts first line the <b>cutting</b> <b>cone</b> and begin to deposit matrix. In contrast, the largest oxygen gradient was observed {{in the final stages of}} trabeculum development. These results suggest oxygen may regulate the dimensions of viable osteons and trabeculae. The effect of oxygen tension on alkaline phosphatase activity and mineralization capacity of MLO-A 5 preosteocytes and MLO-Y 4 osteocytes was then examined. Culture in low oxygen significantly inhibited alkaline phosphatase activity and mineralization capacity. Hypoxia also significantly reduced MLO-A 5 mineral production in three-dimensional alginate bead culture as determined by μCT analysis. Both MLO cell lines responded to hypoxia by upregulating HIF- 1 α and the HIF- 1 target genes GLUT 1 and BNIP 3. A stable MLO-A 5 HIF 1 α siRNA knockdown clone was developed to determine if HIF- 1 mediated the hypoxic inhibition of alkaline phosphatase and mineralization. The loss of HIF 1 α decreased alkaline phosphatase and mineral formation independent of the oxygen tension. Next, a stable MLO-A 5 clone overexpressing ATF 4 was developed to determine if the observed reduction in the ATF 4 in hypoxia was responsible for the inhibition of the mineralizing phenotype. Cells overexpressing ATF 4 evidenced reduced alkaline phosphatase activity and mineral formation independent of oxygen tension in both two- and three-dimensional culture. Many osteocytes of human and rat cortical bone displayed a punctate LC 3 staining, which suggests bone cells undergo autophagy in vivo. In addition, a basal autophagic flux that was upregulated by nutrient deprivation, thapsigargin treatment, and culture in low oxygen was noted in MLO cells. Interestingly, thapsigargin treatment resulted in HIF 1 α stabilization at normoxia. Using HIF 1 α siRNA MLO-A 5 cells, it was determined that HIF 1 α regulated thapsigargin-induced autophagy. Finally, hypoxia was found to protect MLO-Y 4 osteocytes from SNAP-induced apoptosis. This hypoxic protection was independent of HIF- 1 α, as similar viability was noted between control and HIF 1 α siRNA MLO-Y 4 cells following SNAP treatment. Taken together, these results indicate that oxygen tension and HIF 1 α regulate the maturation and survival of differentiated bone cells. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{shape and}} {{structure}} of bones is a topic that has been studied {{for a long time}} by morphologists and biologists with the goal of explaining the laws governing their development, aging and pathology. The osteonal architecture of tibial and femoral mid-diaphyses was examined morphometrically with scanning electron microscopy in four healthy young male subjects. In transverse sections of the mid-diaphysis, the total area of the anterior, posterior, lateral and medial cortex sectors was measured and analysed for osteonal parameters including osteon number and density, osteon total and bone area and vascular space area. Osteons were grouped into four classes including cutting heads (A), transversely cut osteons (B), longitudinally cut osteons (C) and sealed osteons (D). The morphometric parameters were compared between the inner (endosteal) and outer (periosteal) half of the cortex. Of 5927 examined osteons, 24. 4 % cutting heads, 71. 1 % transversely cut osteons, 2. 3 % longitudinally cut osteons and 2. 2 % sealed osteons were found. The interosteonic bone (measured as the area in a lamellar system that has lost contact with its own central canal) corresponded to 51. 2 % of the endosteal and 52. 4 % of the periosteal half-cortex. The mean number of class A cutting heads and class B osteons was significantly higher in the periosteal than in the endosteal half-cortex (P < 0. 001 and P < 0. 05, respectively), whereas {{there was no significant difference}} in density. The mean osteon total area, osteon bone area and vascular space area of both classes A and B were significantly higher (P < 0. 001 for all three parameters) in the endosteal than in the periosteal half-cortex. The significant differences between the two layers of the cortex suggest that the osteoclast activity is distributed throughout the whole cortical thickness, with more numerous excavations in the external layer, but larger resorption lacunae closer to the marrow canal. A randomly selected population of 109 intact class B osteons was examined at higher magnification (350 ×) to count osteocyte lacuna and to analyse their relationship with osteon size parameters. The distribution frequency of the mean number of osteocyte lacunae increased with the increment in the sub-classes of osteon bone area, whereas the density did not show significant differences. The number of osteocyte lacunae had a direct correlation with the osteon bone area and the mean osteon wall thickness, as well as the mean number of lamellae. The osteocyte lacunae density showed an inverse relationship. These data suggest a biological regulation of osteoblast activity with a limit to the volume of matrix produced by each cell and proportionality with the number of available cells in the space of the <b>cutting</b> <b>cone</b> (total osteon area).

40|$|The {{vascular}} {{anatomy of}} the cortical bone and the canal system are highly correlated, and the former has an important bearing on shape and microscopic lamellar structure, as it is established in the progression of the remodelling process. The classical description of a longitudinal system of canals (Havers') connected by the transversal Volkmann's canals is the generally acknowledged model of the structural organization of the cortex. However, it is remarkably difficult to study the circulation inside the compact bone in detail owing to its hard, calcified matrix, and the methods thus far applied have represented either the bone morphology and {{the architecture of the}} canal system or the injected vessel network. In the present study, the intracortical vessel network was injected with black China ink and evidenced by transillumination of full-thickness, decalcified hemicortices. By making use of the depth of field of the microscope objective, the three-dimensional architecture of the network was highlighted and the morphometry of vessel size measurements and a classification of the network nodes according to the number of arms was made possible. These observations were integrated with data obtained by routine histology on decalcified sections relevant to the connections of the intracortical canal system with the outer environment, with regard to the direction of advancement of new canals and with regard to the mode of formation of the system nodes. The formation of the intracortical vessels network involved two processes: the incorporation of the periosteal network and osteonal remodelling, the latter occurring through the advancement of <b>cutting</b> <b>cones</b> followed by their own vascular loop and by concentric lamellar apposition. The two systems could be distinguished by the diameter of the vessels (the former were significantly larger) and by the network architecture (the former convoluted, and the latter longitudinally orientated and straight). Longitudinal vessels could form branches or create connections with the periosteal derived vessels that occasionally meet on the line of their advancement. They were observed entering from either inside the cortex from the metaphyses or from the endosteal surface of the marrow cavity. The combined observations from different methods of study documented a model of intracortical canal and vessel networks formed by two initially independent systems: one derived from the external, periosteal vessels, and one from metaphyseal and marrow vessels. Connections between the two were established with the advancing of <b>cutting</b> <b>cones</b> from the extremities of the diaphysis. Analysis of the system architecture and the modalities of its progressive organization suggested that the direction of advancement of a forming canal does not necessarily correspond to the final blood flow direction of its central vessel...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} current {{literature}} concerning the main clinical factors which can impair {{the healing of}} fractures and makes recommendations on avoiding or minimising these in order to optimise the outcome for patients. The clinical implications are described. Fracture healing is a complex, unique physio-logical process of repair in which bone heals {{for the purpose of}} transferring mechanical loads. 1 The majority of fractures unite by sec-ondary bone healing. This progresses in five stages, as originally described by McKibbin, 2 namely haematoma formation, inflammation, formation of soft and then hard callus and finally remodelling. Different agents or patho-logical processes may affect all of these stages or only one. Primary bone healing occurs when there is rigid internal fixation. This consists of <b>cutting</b> <b>cones</b> (tunnelling osteoclasts followed by osteoblasts forming new bone) which progress across the fracture site directly in a similar way to normal bone remodelling. Both forms of healing are brought about by a series of distinct cellular responses which are under the control of specific paracrine and autocrine intercellular signalling pathways and {{can be viewed as a}} well-orchestrated series of bio-logical events. 1 However, many factors can interrupt the normal flow of this biological series of events.

40|$|We {{describe}} morphological {{aspects of}} the articular calcified cartilage mineralizing front ‘tidemark’ in the distal joint surface of the third metacarpal bone from 14 horses. Compositional backscattered electron scanning electron microscopy and confocal scanning light microscopy were conducted on polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) -embedded medio-lateral slices. After maceration, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to study the calcified cartilage surface in the ‘wedges’ intervening between the slices. An anatomically reproducible clustering of canals in the calcified cartilage was found at one site on the sagittal ridge in all the horses. The site {{is one that is}} relatively less loaded during joint function. These canals through calcified cartilage result from osteoclastic resorption (<b>cutting</b> <b>cones)</b> penetrating from bone through to the non-mineralized hyaline articular cartilage. Their presence may indicate a pathway for connection between bone and cartilage extracellular fluid. In one horse, repair of such canals by plugging with new calcified cartilage was demonstrated. Differences in the degree of mineralization of regions of cartilage were seen in the combined compositional-cum-topographical backscattered SEM images of the macerated ‘tidemark’ front. More-or-less circular patches of lower mineralization density were frequently centred on (and may possibly originate from) canals.

Cortical bone histology was {{compared with a}} data set from a 1. 5 -month-old population of an earlier published paper. From 0. 5 -year-old onward, the mean femur length did not increase further. Thereafter, the mean marrow area increased and the cortical area decreased significantly with aging. This {{was associated with a}} structural pattern transformation from plexiform to laminar and then Haversian-like type.

40|$|The {{kinetics}} of osteogenic cells within secondary osteons {{have been}} examined within a 2 -D model. The linear osteoblast density of the osteons and the osteocyte lacunae density were compared with other endosteal lamellar systems of different geometries. The cell density was significantly greater in the endosteal appositional zone and was always flatter than the central osteonal canals. Fully structured osteons compared with early structuring (<b>cutting</b> <b>cones)</b> did not show any significant differences in density. The osteoblast density may remain constant because some of them leave the row and become embedded within matrix. The overall shape of the Haversian system represented a geometrical restraint and it {{was thought to be}} related to osteoblast-osteocyte transformation. To test this hypothesis of an early differentiation and recruitment of the osteoblast pool which completes the lamellar structure of the osteon, the number and density of osteoblasts and osteocyte lacunae were evaluated. In the central canal area, the mean osteoblast linear density and the osteocyte lacunae planar density were not significantly different among sub-classes (with the exclusion of the osteocyte lacunae of the 300 - 1000 μm(2) sub-class). The mean number of osteoblasts compared with osteocyte lacunae resulted in significantly higher numbers in the two sub-classes, no significant difference was seen in the two middle sub-classes with the larger canals, and there were significantly lower levels in the smallest central canal sub-class. The TUNEL technique was used to identify the morphological features of apoptosis within osteoblasts. It was found that apoptosis occurred during the late phase of osteon formation but not in osteocytes. This suggests a regulatory role of apoptosis in balancing the osteoblast-osteocyte equilibrium within secondary osteon development. The position of the osteocytic lacunae did not correlate with the lamellar pattern and the lacunae density in osteonal radial sectors was not significantly different. These findings support the hypothesis of an early differentiation of the osteoblast pool and the independence of the fibrillar lamellation from osteoblast-osteocyte transformation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} the nonstationary Maxwell system in domains with singularities. In particular we consider a model <b>cone</b> <b>cutting</b> out a 1 -connected domain {{in the unit}} sphere, a wedge, a bounded domain with a conical point, and a waveguide with an edge. The Maxwell system is endowed with boundary conditions corresponding to ideal conductive boundary. We study the behavior of solutions in a neighborhood of singularities of the boundary applying the method based on a priori estimates of solutions. The uniqueness and existence theorems are proved. The asymptotics of solutions near the singularities is obtained and justified. 1 Matioukevitch Sergue...|$|R
40|$|In general, a {{hypoid gear}} and a {{spiral bevel gear}} for cars {{are made up of}} a formate gear and a {{generated}} pinion. The tooth shape is tapered tooth. Much practice is required to obtain excellent tooth bearing of the tapered tooth. If we convert a tapered tooth to an equi-depth tooth, it is thought that we could easily obtain practical tooth bearing. To date, however, there is no paper that theoretically analyzes tooth bearing of the equi-depth tooth and actually demonstrates it. Therefore the tapered tooth is still used in cars. Thus, we have studied the gear cutting method of the equi-depth tooth hypoid gear. The tooth surface of the hypoid pinion is generated by the 3 rd gear member. In such a case, it is useful to apply the <b>cutting</b> pitch <b>cone</b> instead of the pitch cone and to change the generating shaft angle to the tooth bearing development of a hypoid gear. In this report, we present the relationships between the cutting pitch angle or the generating shaft angle and the tooth bearing pattern compared with a tapered tooth...|$|R
40|$|The {{architecture}} of the diaphyseal bone is closely correlated with the cortical vessel network, whose pattern develops {{in the course of}} growth. Various methods have been applied to clarify the three-dimensional anatomy of the cortical canal system, but there is still disagreement about the geometry, blood supply, flux dynamics and factors controlling canal geometry during bone growth and remodeling. A modification of the currently employed dye-injection method was applied to study the vessel network of the whole hemi-shaft of the rabbit femur in mature bones (8 -month-old rabbits) and growing bones (1. 5 -month-old rabbits). The cortical vascular tree of the hemi-shaft of the femur was injected with black China ink and observed in full-thickness specimens of the cortex. The same specimens were then processed for histology. A comparative study of the middle diaphysis (mid-shaft) with the distal extremity (distal shaft) was performed in both young and old rabbit femurs. The longitudinally oriented pattern of the vessel network was seen to develop in the diaphysis of mature femurs, while at the extremity of the shaft of the same specimen the network showed a reticular organization without a dominant polarization. The vessels were significantly higher in the mid-shaft than in the distal shaft of the old femurs (P < 0. 0001), as was their diameter (P < 0. 05). In the group of young rabbits at mid-shaft level the longitudinally oriented pattern of the vessel network was not yet completely developed, without their being significant differences in length and diameter between the mid-shaft and distal shaft. The differentiation of the mid-shaft from the distal shaft was confirmed histologically by the presence, in the latter, of longitudinal calcified cartilage septa between osteons. This pattern of structural organization and development of the intracortical vascular network has not been previously reported. The cells primarily involved in polarization of the remodeling process were the osteoclasts {{at the top of the}} <b>cutting</b> <b>cones</b> advancing from the proximal and distal metaphyses toward the midshaft. This suggests, first, a relationship with the longitudinally oriented structures already present in the cortex near the metaphysis (the calcified cartilage septa) and then with the columns of interosteonic breccia, which were formed as a secondary effect of the longitudinal polarization of the remodeling process. Our observations did not enable us to substantiate the model of two different systems, one of longitudinal vessels (Havers) and the other of connecting transversal vessels (Volkmann), but suggested instead that there is a network whose loops lengthen in the direction of the major bone axis in the course of growth and secondary modeling. The associated morphology supported the view that the type of structural organization of the tubular bone cortex is primarily determined by an inherited constitutional factor rather than by mechanical strains.

40|$|Background: Retakes of intra oral radiographs happen {{frequently}} in dental practice although radiographic courses train dental students in consecutive semesters. To reduce the patient exposure {{as much as}} possible it is mandatory {{to reduce the number of}} retakes both in radiology clinics and educational centers. Materials and Methods: 3188 periapical radiographs taken by bisect-angle technique was evaluated in this cross-sectional study to assess the frequent errors necessitating retakes. Views were taken by fourth year dental students using bisect angle method. Errors were tabled according to site and type. Results: The four major errors that were found in the study included incorrect film placement (35. 4 %), <b>cone</b> <b>cutting</b> (18. 2 %), incorrect horizontal angulation (16. 6 %), and incorrect vertical angulation (14. 4 %). The distribution of technical errors by anatomic location was identified. Maxillary molar area was the most occurring site for errors. Conclusion: These results suggest that educational programs may be re-evaluated to make the best benefit of educational courses involving both dental and hygiene students...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{proposes a}} simple method to {{determine}} the 3 -D location and shape parameters of a right circular cone using structured lights. A vital concept in the proposed method is to convert the complex curved stripe pattern into an equivalent, but simpler, linear stripe pattern. The conic surface patch lying between two visible silhouette edges is replaced by the plane defined by the two silhouette edges that cut the cone. The appropriate geometric models are given to compute the cone axis and shape parameters representing {{the height of the}} cone and the radius of the cone base. For successful application of the proposed measurement method, the sensing environment must be in a proper geometric configuration such that the required <b>cone</b> <b>cutting</b> plane and the two silhouette edges can be constructed. It is pointed out that in terms of a Gaussian sphere representation, there always exists such a right geometric configuration for the cone measurement. Experimental results are given for the measurement of three cones of different sizes. The results show that the method is reasonably accurate and robust against noise in the extracted stripe data...|$|R
40|$|Gabriel’s horn is {{the surface}} {{obtained}} by revolving the curve y = 1 /x (x ≥ 1 / 2) about the x-axis (see figure 1). Mathematics professors wow introductory calculus students by sharing its paradoxical properties: it has finite volume, but infinite surface area. As they say, “you can {{fill it with}} paint, but you can’t paint it. ” Figure 1. Gabriel’s horn At {{the end of this}} article we provide two templates (one color, one white) for making a model of Gabriel’s horn out of paper cones, such as the one in figure 2. The instructions are simple: Cut out the sectors, tape them together to form cones, and stack the cones in numerical order. The ap-proximation is good only for the first 1 / 4 ” of the last cone, so the stack of cones should be cut off at that height. The rest of this article describes the mathematics used to make the sectors. In short: Take evenly spaced points along the curve, find the segments of the tangent lines between these points and the x-axis, and use them to generate the cones (see figure 3). We use y = 1 /x as the generating curve, but this procedure works for any curve that is positive, decreasing, and concave up. First we use calculus to find the equation of the tangent line to the graph at the point (a, 1 /a) : y − 1 a = − 1 a 2 (x − a). Then we set y = 0 to find the x-intercept of the tangent line: x = 2 a. From this we conclude that the radius of the base of the corresponding cone is 1 /a and the slant height is a 2 − 1 /a 2. Now, imagine <b>cutting</b> the <b>cone</b> and unrolling it into a sector with central angle θ. The arc of the sector is the circumference of the base of the cone, 1 a...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Successful {{radiography}} {{requires a}} true imagination of central ray. Some technical errors however happen {{as a result}} of maladjustment of central ray. Many dental students who begin to learn radiography do not have a comprehensive imagination of the central ray. Using a laser guided indicator for central ray in such cases may serve as a useful training means for better adjustment of central ray. Materials and Methods: This in vitro study was carried out at the Department of Radiology, Dental School of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences. A total of eighteen students were divided into two groups of nine. In the first group the periapical technique was taught without laser guided indicator while in the second group laser guided indicator was applied in training the students. All students took X-rays from the phantom. Laser guided indicator is made of two low power red laser diodes and is capable of making two perpendicular rays forming a cross (+) in the center of tube which indicates central ray. Totally 216 X-rays were taken and technical errors and the quality of X-rays were evaluated. The results were analyzed statistically via Mann-Whitney and chi Square tests (α = 0. 05). Results: The X-rays taken by students showed significant differences in Cone Cutting (p value = 0. 014), Overlapping (p value = 0. 018) and Elongation (p value < 0. 001) between the two study groups. In the subjective review of X-ray quality, the difference was also significant (p value < 0. 001). Conclusion: The use of laser guided indicator as a training aid seems to be practical for easier learning of central ray adjustment and reduction of technical errors in taking X-rays by dental students.
