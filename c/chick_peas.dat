40|$|The {{present study}} was carried out to {{evaluate}} the effect of Mr. Trivedi’s biofield energy treatment on mustard (Brassica juncea) and <b>chick</b> <b>pea</b> (Cicer arietinum) for their growth, yield, and yield attributes.

The result showed the plant height of mustard and <b>chick</b> <b>pea</b> was increased by 13. 2 and 97. 41 %, respectively in the treated samples as compared to the control. Additionally, primary branching of mustard and <b>chick</b> <b>pea</b> was improved by 7. 4 and 19. 84 %, respectively in the treated sample as compared to the control. The control mustard and <b>chick</b> <b>pea</b> crops showed high rate of infection by pests and diseases, while treated crops were free from any infection of pests and disease.

Moreover, similar results were observed in the yield attributing parameters of <b>chick</b> <b>pea</b> viz. pods/plant, grains/pod as well as test weight of 1000 grains.

30|$|Furthermore, Zucconi et al.

However, it seems that if the first contact of the organic matter does not induce toxicity to the root materials, then the plant somehow shows a capability to recover and survive further (Moharana and Biswas 2016).
