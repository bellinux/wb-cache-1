In July, Noel was born, though he died of malnutrition and deprivation two weeks later due to Maria's inability to nurse him. Maria herself died several days later, with the official cause of death being cholera. Her death shook Taylor deeply, and in 1871, his own health began deteriorating further, leading to his return to England later that year to recuperate and take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> items.|$|E
25|$|Manchester {{city centre}} has many nightclubs, {{many of which}} follow in the {{footsteps}} of the Haçienda nightclub which has now closed; the site has been redeveloped as a housing complex. There is a gay village around the Canal Street area in the east of the city centre, which plays host to an annual Gay Pride Festival, and a large Chinatown with numerous far eastern style restaurants. The area to the west which is bisected by Deansgate and crossed by Peter Street is also well-provided with bars and some clubs (e.g. The Moon under Water and Ampersand). Rafters was a nightclub located in St James's Buildings. A number of reputable bands played concerts at Rafters in the 1970s and 1980s. Rafters closed in 1983. In its final years the DJ was Mike Shaft who appeared on Piccadilly Radio with Takin' <b>Care</b> <b>of</b> <b>Business.</b> After that the club was renamed as Jilly's which existed to 1993, after which the club was called MusicBox. The city centre also has many bars, mostly located in the Northern Quarter, regarded by some as the central district's creative hub. The quarter is well-provided with bars of various sizes; these include 'TV 21', 'Bar Fringe', the cocktail bar 'Apotheca' and 'Trof'. Live music venues may also be found here, including the well-known 'Night & Day Cafe', newcomer 'MOHO Live' and jazz bar 'Matt & Phred's'.|$|E

500|$|Nixon infused {{elements}} of those literatures into the Dimitri and Natalie romance with as well. [...] "There's a gothic quality to it", she said, {{referring to the}} couple. [...] "It's Wuthering Heights or Jane Eyre. Everybody loves somebody who has a past and a secret- and certainly Dimitri does- which we haven't divulged yet. That heightens ones interest and suspense. It's a special situation but what really makes it special is the actor's talent, personalities, good looks, and chemistry." [...] Since the writers created Dimitri as a very mysterious character, Michael Nader mostly {{stayed away from the}} press in order to help maintain that image. Whenever he did do an interview, he discussed the character {{in such a way as}} to add more mystery. Nader compared Dimitri to the Dynasty character he once portrayed, Dex Dexter. On Dynasty, [...] "John James (Jeff Colby) played the 'aw, shucks;' nice guy, and I played the guy who was on the edge, who would take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> and not take any bull", he said. [...] "Dimitri is sort of a darker Dex. Though I don't know exactly how dark to make him yet." [...] Nader, as an actor, also provided the writers with more inspiration on the character. [...] "The more we see of him, the more he inspires us", Broderick said. [...] "It's just a wonderful marriage of actor and character He's giving us so many levels and such depth, that it's a challenge. But it's exciting. Dimitri is one of the characters that is so much fun to write." ...|$|E

The south wall has three built-in television sets, a stereo, and cabinets for Elvis' record collection. [...] Opposite of the TV room is the billiard room; Elvis, an avid billiards player, bought the pool table in 1960 and had {{the walls and ceiling}} covered with 350–400 yards of pleated cotton fabric after the two basement rooms were remodeled in 1974.

2500|$|In the 1991 NBA All-Star Game, Johnson started {{alongside}} Magic Johnson in the Western Conference backcourt. In {{anticipation of}} the game, the Sporting News asked whether K.J. may have surpassed Magic as the best player on the court. The previous spring in the 1990 Western Conference Semifinals, Johnson led the Suns past Magic's league-best, 63-win Los Angeles Lakers, four games to one. Over the last two games, Johnson closed out the series by averaging 33.5 points and a dozen assists as the Suns won both Game Four and Game Five, with K.J. vastly outplaying Magic Johnson {{in the fourth quarter}} of both contests. Indeed, Johnson's clutch performances led Hall of Fame center and NBC commentator Bill Walton to later remark, [...] "Kevin Johnson ... really came to the top of this league in the 1990 playoffs when he waxed Magic Johnson and the Lakers in the early rounds. Kevin Johnson – and the Suns – taking <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> in 1990, four to one over the Lakers ... Kevin Johnson just totally outplaying Magic." [...] Johnson's performance during the 1990 playoffs led the Suns to a second consecutive berth in the Western Conference Finals as Phoenix became the only team to ever defeat John Stockton's Jazz (55 wins) and Magic Johnson's Lakers (63 wins) in the same postseason.|$|E
2500|$|The main feud {{heading into}} the {{pay-per-view}} was for the Raw brand, with Triple H, Shawn Michaels and Chris Benoit feuding over the World Heavyweight Championship. Triple H was the three time reigning World Champion {{heading into the}} WrestleMania XX event, with {{the origins of the}} rivalry beginning on the December 29, 2003 episode of Raw, when Michaels challenged Triple H for the World Title in Michaels' hometown of San Antonio, Texas. It looked as though Michaels was going to win his fifth World Title over Triple H, the Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff came in to the ring at the last minute and made the pinfall, counting to three for what appeared to be Michaels winning the World Heavyweight title. However, as Shawn's shoulders were on the mat {{at the same time as}} Triple H's, the match was declared a draw and Triple H would retain the championship. On January 25, at the Royal Rumble event, Triple H and Michaels faced each other again in a Last Man Standing match for the title, which resulted in a draw, and, as a result, Triple H retained the title, leaving question about who is the better of the two. At the same event, during the Royal Rumble match, SmackDown!'s Benoit won the contest by last eliminating The Big Show. On the following night, Michaels and Triple H were involved in an in-ring confrontation when Raw's authority figure (referred to as the [...] "Sheriff"), Steve Austin, made his way to the ring. As he stated that, although Michaels should have a rematch, he had to [...] "enforce the law" [...] and that even though the Royal Rumble rules gave the winner of the match a shot at [...] "the (world) championship", there was not any specification as to which world title that was. Benoit, who at the time was a member of SmackDown, then came to the ring and said he was taking advantage of that loophole and challenging Triple H for the World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania XX. On the February 9 episode of Raw, a contract signing took place between Benoit and World Champion, Triple H. As Triple H signed his name on the paper, Michaels came out to inform Benoit that the last thing he wanted to do is rain on his parade. He then stated that he more than anybody can respect Benoit's effort to win the Royal Rumble match and earning a World title shot but suggested that Benoit could've stayed on SmackDown to take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> while Michaels, himself, was trying to finish his 10-year issue with Triple H on behalf of the Raw brand. Benoit refused to relinquish his guaranteed title shot, resulting in Michaels superkicking Benoit and signing the contract himself for the WrestleMania match. After the two men wrestled a match marred by interference from the champion the next week, Austin decided to make Triple H's title defense a Triple threat match. On March 1, after Michaels and Benoit lost to Randy Orton and Batista, Triple H's stablemates in Evolution, the entire group attacked Michaels and Benoit, ending with Triple H nailing them with the Pedigree and rubbing his World title belt into their faces while they were laying motionless in the ring.|$|E
