40|$|Decomposition-based {{methods for}} system design {{optimization}} introduce consistency constraints, which contain <b>coupling</b> <b>variables</b> communicated between adjacent subproblems and link them together. When these variables are vector-valued (e. g., dynamic responses), the problem size can increase dramatically and make such methods impractical.

40|$|Uncertainty based Multidisciplinary Optimization (UMDO) {{relies on}} {{propagation}} of uncertainties across several disciplines. A typical aircraft design process involves collaboration of multiple and diverse teams involving high-fidelity disciplinary tools and experts. Therefore, traditional {{methods such as}} All-In-One (AIO), which integrates all the disciplines and treats the entire multidisciplinary analysis process as a black box becomes infeasible for uncertainty propagation and analysis. If all the disciplines cannot be tightly integrated, then {{it is helpful to}} use a method that conducts uncertainty propagation in each discipline and combines their results into a system level uncertainty. Distributed UMDO methods based on Collaborative Optimization (CO), Concurrent Subs-Space Optimization (CSSO), Analytical Target Cascading (ATC), Bi-Level Integrated System Synthesis (BLISS), etc. use the strategy of decomposition and coordination to carry out distributed uncertainty analysis and optimization by preserving disciplinary autonomy. However, there are shortcomings in these methods which leads to inaccurate quantification of uncertainty at system level. One such disadvantage is the inability to handle statistical dependencies among <b>coupling</b> <b>variables.</b> In most cases, the statistical dependencies manifests due the underlying functional relationship between the variables. Most of the existing distributed UMDO methods in literature assume that the <b>coupling</b> <b>variables</b> are independent of each other. Although, under certain conditions this assumption is valid, nonetheless it may lead to inaccurate estimation of uncertainty quantification at system level if the dependencies of <b>coupling</b> <b>variables</b> are significant and if the system level metric is sensitive to the dependencies. Another limitation in the existing distributed UMDO literature is related to interdisciplinary compatibility. One of the common strategies to achieve interdisciplinary compatibility is by moment matching method. Since, only marginal distributions of <b>coupling</b> <b>variables</b> are considered in the moment matching, it works well when <b>coupling</b> <b>variables</b> are statistically independent. However, when <b>coupling</b> <b>variables</b> are dependent, this strategy does not guarantee that interdisciplinary compatibility is satisfied for every instantiation of uncertain variables. Also, most of these methods assume that the uncertain <b>coupling</b> <b>variables</b> have fixed functional form of probability density function, most commonly a Gaussian density function. This assumption breaks down when the local uncertainties in disciplines are non-Gaussian and disciplines are non-linear functions of input variables which lead to non-Gaussian <b>coupling</b> <b>variables.</b> To overcome these limitations, Probabilistic Analysis of Distributed Multidisciplinary Architectures (PADMA) is developed. PADMA is a bi-level distributed uncertainty based multidisciplinary analysis (UMDA) method which allows each discipline to carry out uncertainty propagation independently and concurrently. It is a non-iterative method in which dependence and interdisciplinary compatibility is handled by evaluating the probability of Event of Interdisciplinary Compatibility (EIC). Probability of EIC is evaluated using conditional probability density functions of disciplinary metrics. A quantile copula regression method is developed which is used to model conditional probability density functions. In quantile copula regression, the probability density functions are modeled by regressing multiple level of quantiles of disciplinary metric, allowing a comprehensive representation of overall distribution without any assumption of functional form of probability density function. Also, quantile copula regression models the dependency between disciplinary metric using copula functions when disciplines have multiple outputs. Finally, a distributed UMDO method, Concurrent Optimization using Probabilistic Analysis of Distributed Multidisciplinary Architectures (CO-PADMA), has been developed using PADMA and quantile copula regression. CO-PADMA is a bi-level distributed UMDO method which allows distributed analysis and optimization, while handling the dependencies and interdisciplinary compatibility, to find optimum design and quantify the uncertainty of system metric accurately. The advantages of the methods developed in this thesis have been demonstrated by their application on analytical and physics based problems. Ph. D...|$|R

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} {{we develop}} multiple algorithms for efficient parallel solution of structured nonlinear programming problems by decomposition of the linear augmented system solved at each iteration of a nonlinear interior-point approach. In particular, we address large-scale, block-structured {{problems with a}} significant number of complicating, or <b>coupling</b> <b>variables.</b> This structure arises in many important problem classes including multi-scenario optimization, parameter estimation, two-stage stochastic programming, optimal control and power network problems. The structure of these problems induces a block-angular structure in the augmented system, and parallel solution is possible using a Schur-complement decomposition. Three major variants are implemented: a serial, full-space interior-point method, serial and parallel versions of an explicit Schur-complement decomposition, and serial and parallel versions of an implicit PCG-based Schur-complement decomposition. All of these algorithms have been implemented in C++ in an extensible software framework for nonlinear optimization. The explicit Schur-complement decomposition is typically effective for problems with a few hundred <b>coupling</b> <b>variables.</b> We demonstrate the performance of our implementation on an important problem in optimal power grid operation, the contingency-constrained AC optimal power ow problem. In this dissertation, we present a rectangular IV formulation for the contingency-constrained ACOPF problem and demonstrate that the explicit Schur-complement decomposition can dramatically reduce solution times for a problem with a large number of contingency scenarios. Moreover, a comparison of the explicit Schur-complement decomposition implementation and the Progressive Hedging approach provided by Pyomo is provided, showing that the internal decomposition approach is computationally favorable to the external approach. However, the explicit Schur-complement decomposition approach is not appropriate for problems with a large number of <b>coupling</b> <b>variables</b> because of the high computational cost associated with forming and solving the dense Schur-complement. We show that this bottleneck can be overcome by solving the Schur-complement equations implicitly using a quasi-Newton preconditioned conjugate gradient method. This new algorithm avoids explicit formation and factorization of the Schur-complement. The computational efficiency of the serial and parallel versions of this algorithm are compared with the serial full-space approach, and the serial and parallel explicit Schur-complement approach on a set of quadratic parameter estimation problems and nonlinear optimization problems. These results show that the PCG implicit Schur-complement approach dramatically reduces the computational expense for problems with many <b>coupling</b> <b>variables...</b>|$|R

For a special set of parameters the variable coefficient NLSE is completely integrable. The same variable coefficient NLSE is also applicable to optical fiber systems with phase modulation or pulse compression. For such variable coefficient NLSE, solitary waves have been computed earlier in the literature either by the inverse scattering transform or the Bäcklund transformation. The Hirota bilinear method is shown to be applicable here too, and this modified format is employed to compute the exact bright and dark soliton solutions and the periodic waves solutions. The analysis is also extended to the <b>coupled</b> <b>variable</b> coefficient NLSEs. The merit of the Hirota bilinear approach is demonstrated clearly as periodic and solitary waves are obtained even for nonintegrable coupled systems.

40|$|Complex {{nonlinear}} dynamics {{arise in}} many fields {{of science and}} engineering, but uncovering the underlying differential equations directly from observations poses a challenging task. The ability to symbolically model complex networked systems is key to understanding them, an open problem in many disciplines. Here we introduce {{for the first time}} a method that can automatically generate symbolic equations for a nonlinear coupled dynamical system directly from time series data. This method is applicable to any system that can be described using sets of ordinary nonlinear differential equations, and assumes that the (possibly noisy) time series of all variables are observable. Previous automated symbolic modeling approaches of coupled physical systems produced linear models or required a nonlinear model to be provided manually. The advance presented here is made possible by allowing the method to model each (possibly <b>coupled)</b> <b>variable</b> separately, intelligently perturbing and destabilizing the system to extract its less observable characteristics, and automatically simplifying the equations during modeling. We demonstrate this method on four simulated and two real systems spanning mechanics, ecology, and systems biology.

It is presumed that deformation of the rooms by creep will lead to loss of structural integrity and affect room life history and seal efficiency. At projected repository temperatures, two possible fracture mechanisms in salt are creep-induced microcracking in triaxial compression and cleavage in tension. Thus, an accurate prediction of room life and seal degradation requires a reliable description of the creep and damage processes. While several constitutive models that treat either creep or fracture in salt {{are available in the}} literature, very few models have considered creep and damage in a coupled manner. Previously, Munson and Dawson formulated a set of creep equations for salt based on the consideration of dislocation mechanisms in the creep process.

In this review, we examine recent developments in the ecohydrology of GDEs {{with a focus on}} three knowledge gaps: (1) how do we locate GDEs, (2) how much water is transpired from shallow aquifers by GDEs and (3) what are the responses of GDEs to excessive groundwater extraction? The answers to these questions will determine water allocations that are required to sustain functioning of GDEs and to guide regulations on groundwater extraction to avoid negative impacts on GDEs. We discuss three methods for identifying GDEs: (1) techniques relying on remotely sensed information; (2) fluctuations in depth-to-groundwater that are associated with diurnal variations in transpiration; and (3) stable isotope analysis of water sources in the transpiration stream. We then discuss several methods for estimating rates of GW use, including direct measurement using sapflux or eddy covariance technologies, estimation of a climate wetness index within a Budyko framework, spatial distribution of evapotranspiration (ET) using remote sensing, groundwater modelling and stable isotopes. Remote sensing methods often rely on direct measurements to calibrate the relationship between vegetation indices and ET. ET from GDEs is also determined using hydrologic models of varying complexity, from the White method to fully <b>coupled,</b> <b>variable</b> saturation models. Combinations of methods are typically employed to obtain clearer insight into the components of groundwater discharge in GDEs, such as the proportional importance of transpiration versus evaporation (e. g. using stable isotopes) or from groundwater versus rainwater sources.

We provide a brief review of two case studies of the impacts of GW extraction and then provide an ecosystem-scale, multiple trait, integrated metric of the impact of differences in groundwater depth on the structure and function of eucalypt forests growing along a natural gradient in depth-to-groundwater.

This paper reports on the investigation work of applying variable-reluctance principle {{to the design of}} a novel two-finger gripper. Contrary to previous on-off type variable reluctance devices, the proposed actuator can be operated in position-control, velocity-control, and force-control modes. To enable effective control of the two-finger variable-reluctance gripper, its electromagnetic and mechanical properties have to be fully investigated, and an efficient model has to be constructed. Since the forces on the two fingers of the gripper are produced by the variation of flux, and flux is a nonlinear quantity, the electromagnetic characteristics of the two-finger gripper are much more complex than other types of devices (e. g. permanent magnet voice coil). Moreover, the existences of coupling effects make the characterization of the gripper even more complicated. In the past, most mutual coupling effects in variable reluctance machines are neglected for the sake of simplicity. However, due to the unique structure of the two-finger variable-reluctance gripper, it was found that mutual coupling can constitute significant modeling discrepancy. The work described in this paper is {{the first of its kind}} to carry out a detail study on the electromagnetic properties of a tightly-coupled two-finger variable-reluctance gripper, including its mutual-coupling effects.
