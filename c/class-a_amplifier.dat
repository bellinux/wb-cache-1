50|$|A class - B {{push-pull}} amplifier {{is more efficient}} than a class-A power amplifier because each output device amplifies only half the output waveform and is cut off during the opposite half. It can be shown that the theoretical full power efficiency (AC power in load compared to DC power consumed) of a push-pull stage is approximately 78.5%. This compares with a <b>class-A</b> <b>amplifier</b> which has efficiency of 25% if directly driving the load {{and no more than}} 50% for a transformer coupled output. A {{push-pull amplifier}} draws little power with zero signal, compared to a <b>class-A</b> <b>amplifier</b> that draws constant power. Power dissipation in the output devices is roughly one-fifth of the output power rating of the amplifier. A <b>class-A</b> <b>amplifier,</b> by contrast, must use a device capable of dissipating several times the output power.|$|E

This circuit {{was used in}} a line of expensive Nakamichi PA series of power-amplifiers, such as the PA-5 and PA-7, as well as its SR and TA series of receivers.|$|E
50|$|Foster-Seeley discriminators are {{sensitive}} to both frequency and amplitude variations, unlike some detectors. Therefore a limiter amplifier stage must be used before the detector, to remove amplitude variations in the signal which would be detected as noise. The limiter acts as a <b>class-A</b> <b>amplifier</b> at lower amplitudes; at higher amplitudes it becomes a saturated amplifier which clips off the peaks and limits the amplitude.|$|E
50|$|Amplifying devices {{operating}} in class A conduct {{over the entire}} range of the input cycle. A <b>class-A</b> <b>amplifier</b> is distinguished by the output stage devices being biased for class A operation. Subclass A2 is sometimes used to refer to vacuum-tube class-A stages that drive the grid slightly positive on signal peaks for slightly more power than normal class A (A1; where the grid is always negative). This, however, incurs higher signal distortion.|$|E
5000|$|Gryphon {{amplifiers}} {{have always}} been pure [...] "class A" [...] in circuit design, until {{the introduction of the}} Gryphon [...] "Encore" [...] <b>amplifier.</b> <b>Class-A</b> <b>amplifiers</b> set their output transistors to be operated in their most accurate, and most inefficient, range. Gryphon 100-watt-per-channel <b>class-A</b> <b>amplifiers</b> dissipate over 400 watts per channel even with no signal applied to their inputs. Gryphon uses large heat sinks and/or fans in their amplifiers to dissipate this large amount of heat.|$|R

50|$|Class-B {{amplifiers}} {{amplify the}} signal with two active devices, each operating over {{one half of}} the cycle. Efficiency is much improved over <b>class-A</b> <b>amplifiers.</b> Class-B amplifiers are also favoured in battery-operated devices, such as transistor radios. Class B has a maximum theoretical efficiency of π/4 (≈ 78.5%).|$|R
50|$|Audio Research Corporation {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} {{manufacturers}} of high-end audio equipment still in operation. They were pioneers at advancing the state-of-the-art for audio reproduction in the seventies, re-introducing the vacuum tube as the primary active amplification device. Audio Research prefers the <b>class-A</b> <b>amplifier</b> design. With the help of audiophile publications such as Stereophile and The Absolute Sound, they solidified their position as one of the most well respected audio manufacturers. Many industry observers consider the president and founder William Z. Johnson as one of the true originators of the entire concept of high-end audio as it exists today.|$|E
5000|$|Early valve {{amplifiers}} used unregulated power supplies. This {{was due to}} {{the high}} cost associated with high-quality high-voltage power supplies. The typical anode (plate) supply was simply a rectifier, an inductor and a capacitor. When the valve amplifier was operated at high volume, the power supply voltage would dip, reducing power output and causing signal attenuation and compression. This dipping effect is known as [...] "sag", and is sought-after by some electric guitarists. Sag only occurs in class-AB amplifiers. This is because, technically, sag results from more current being drawn from the power supply, causing a greater voltage drop over the rectifier valve. In a <b>class-A</b> <b>amplifier,</b> current draw is constant, so sag does not occur.|$|E
50|$|Two {{differences}} from the klystron {{give it a}} lower cost and higher efficiency. First, the klystron uses velocity modulation to create bunching; its beam current is constant. It requires a drift tube several feet in length to allow the electrons to bunch. In contrast the IOT uses current modulation like an ordinary triode; most of the bunching {{is done by the}} grid, so the tube can be much shorter, making it less expensive to build and mount, and less bulky. Secondly, since the klystron has beam current throughout the RF cycle, it can only operate as an inefficient <b>class-A</b> <b>amplifier,</b> while the grid of the IOT allows more versatile operating modes. The grid can be biased so the beam current can be cut off during part of the cycle, enabling it to operate in the more efficient class B or AB mode.|$|E
50|$|The {{distortion}} {{content of}} class-A circuits (SE or PP) typically monotonically reduces as the signal level is reduced, asymptotic to zero during quiet passages of music. For this reason <b>class-A</b> <b>amplifiers</b> are especially desired for classical and acoustic music etc. cf. class-B and AB amplifiers, {{for which the}} amplitude of the crossover distortion {{is more or less}} constant, and thus the distortion relative to signal increases as the music gets quieter. <b>Class-A</b> <b>amplifiers</b> measure best at low power. Class-AB and B amplifiers measure best just below max rated power.|$|R
50|$|Capacitor {{multipliers}} make low-frequency {{filter and}} long-duration timing circuits possible {{that would be}} impractical with actual capacitors. Another application is in DC power supplies where very low ripple voltage (under load) is of paramount importance, such as in <b>class-A</b> <b>amplifiers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Class-A</b> <b>amplifiers</b> {{are very}} inefficient, {{they can never}} have an {{efficiency}} better than 50%. The semiconductor or vacuum tube conducts throughout the entire RF cycle. The mean anode current for a vacuum tube should be set {{to the middle of}} the linear section of the curve of the anode current vs grid bias potential.|$|R
5000|$|For analog {{operation}} of a <b>class-A</b> <b>amplifier,</b> the Q-point is placed so the transistor stays in active mode (does not shift to operation in the saturation region or cut-off region) when input is applied. For digital operation, the Q-point is placed so the transistor does the contrary - switches from the [...] "on" [...] (saturation) to the [...] "off" [...] (cutoff) state. Often, the Q-point is established {{near the center of}} the active region of a transistor characteristic to allow similar signal swings in positive and negative directions.The Q-point should be stable; in particular, it should be insensitive to variations in transistor parameters (for example, should not shift if transistor is replaced by another of the same type), variations in temperature, variations in power supply voltage and so forth.The circuit must also be practical; both easily implemented and cost-effective.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{demonstrates}} Class-A+ amplifier as {{an alternative}} to <b>Class-A</b> <b>amplifier</b> for discrete-time signal processing circuits.

40|$|A tracking-rail power audio {{amplifier}} {{was designed and}} partially implemented to deliver up to 100 W into an 8 Q load with very low signal distortion and high power efficiency. The design uses a <b>class-A</b> <b>amplifier,</b> known for its low signal distortion but low power efficiency (less than 50 %), to amplify the audio signal. Class-D amplifiers, known for their high power efficiency (greater than 85 %) but high signal distortion, provide a signal output that {{will serve as the}} supply voltages of the output stage of the <b>class-A</b> <b>amplifier.</b> Thus, the rails will track the audio signal, highly increasing the power efficiency of the <b>Class-A</b> <b>amplifier.</b> This amplifier can achieve a theoretical efficiency of 80 %, but, in practice, it is closer to 70 %. by Angel A.

50|$|<b>Class-A</b> <b>amplifiers</b> can be {{designed}} to have good linearity in both single ended and push-pull topologies. Amplifiers of classes AB1, AB2 and B can be linear only when a tuned tank circuit is employed, or in the push-pull topology, in which two active elements (tubes, transistors) are used to amplify positive and negative parts of the RF cycle respectively.

40|$|This work mainly {{focuses on}} {{designing}} a low-power class-AB residue amplifier for a 12 bit 500 MS/sec pipeline ADC with digital calibration. A foreground ideal calibration test bench has been implemented in MATLAB to correct non-linearities of the amplifier {{up to the}} 5 th order. A detailed comparison has been made between a <b>class-A</b> <b>amplifier</b> and a class-AB amplifier. Simulation {{results show that the}} class-AB amplifier outperforms the <b>class-A</b> <b>amplifier</b> in all performance aspects such as gain, bandwidth, linearity, noise and power consumption, except for the CMRR. A new class-AB amplifier topology has been proposed, which alleviates problems associated with the level shifting capacitors. Due to an insufficient accuracy of the proposed class-AB amplifier in order to save power, the residue output signal from the flip-around MDAC topology becomes distorted. To resolve this problem, the flip-around MDAC {{has been replaced by a}} simple charge amplifier MDAC topology. Timing scheme of the pipeline ADC has been modified due to remove the timing related problems and ISI. In addition, layout of the first stage MDAC has been done in TSMC 40 nm CMOS technology. Post-layout simulations have shown an excellent Figure-of-Merit (FOM) of 8. 08 fJ/conv, at an ENOB of 10. 8 bit and signal bandwidth of 250 MHz, which prove that the design is not only energy efficient, but also have a superior speed-resolution product.

40|$|A double {{balanced}} Gilbert-cell <b>class-A</b> <b>amplifier</b> bleeding mixer (DBGC CAAB mixer) {{is proposed}} and implemented. The injection current is utilized to amplify the local oscillator (LO) signal {{to improve the}} performance of the transconductor stage. The DBGC CAAB mixer achieves a conversion gain of 17. 5 dB at - 14 dBm LO power, and the noise figure is suppressed from 45 dB to 10. 7 dB. It is important to stress that the new configuration will not drain additional power in contrast to the former current bleeding mixers. This topology dramatically relieves the requirement of the LO power. The DBGC CAAB mixer is implemented by using 0. 18 -μm RFCMOS technology and operates at the 2. 4 GHz ISM application with 10 MHz intermediate frequency.

40|$|Class-AB {{amplifiers}} {{have better}} power efficiency than <b>class-A</b> <b>amplifiers,</b> {{which makes them}} a suitable choice for pipeline ADCs where low power, high performance opamps are desired. However, class-AB amplifiers have significantly lower linearity compared to <b>class-A</b> <b>amplifiers</b> due {{to the problem of}} cross-over distortion. In this work, the problem of designing power efficient, high linearity class-AB amplifiers is addressed. The Monticelli bias scheme, which is the most popular class-AB bias scheme today, is analyzed. A new class-AB bias scheme, which is highly robust to process variations and achieves better linearity than the Monticelli bias scheme, is proposed. The problem of ?cross-over distortion? in the class-AB amplifier is addressed and a solution is proposed. The idea behind this method is that the third order nonlinearity in the class-AB amplifier can be reduced or eliminated by matching the output stage NMOS and PMOS transistor transconductance across the input signal range, ensuring a constant transconductance at the output, improving linearity performance. To ensure good matching across process, voltage and temperature variations (P. V. T), a feedback calibration scheme is proposed...|$|R
5000|$|Historically, valve {{amplifiers}} {{were often}} used a <b>class-A</b> power <b>amplifier</b> simply because valves {{are large and}} expensive; many class-A designs use only a single device.|$|R
50|$|The {{benefit of}} all <b>class-A</b> <b>amplifiers</b> {{is the absence of}} {{crossover}} distortion. This crossover distortion was found especially annoying after the first silicon-transistor class-B and class-AB transistor amplifiers arrived on the consumer market. Earlier germanium-based designs with the much lower turn-on voltage of this technology and the non-linear response curves of the devices had not shown large amounts of cross-over distortion. Although crossover distortion is very fatiguing to the ear and perceptible in listening tests, it is also almost invisible (until looked for) in the traditional Total harmonic distortion (THD) measurements of that epoch.|$|R

25|$|Different {{power supply}} types result in many {{different}} methods of bias. Bias is a technique by which active devices are set to operate in a particular region, or by which the DC component of the output signal is set to the midpoint between the maximum voltages available from the power supply. Most amplifiers use several devices at each stage; they are typically matched in specifications except for polarity. Matched inverted polarity devices are called complementary pairs. <b>Class-A</b> <b>amplifiers</b> generally use only one device, unless the power supply is set to provide {{both positive and negative}} voltages, in which case a dual device symmetrical design may be used.

5000|$|<b>Class-A</b> <b>amplifiers</b> are inefficient.

In a power amplifier, {{this not only}} wastes power and limits operation with batteries, but increases operating costs and requires higher-rated output devices. Inefficiency comes from the standing current that must be roughly half the maximum output current, and {{a large part of}} the power supply voltage is present across the output device at low signal levels. If high output power is needed from a class-A circuit, the power supply and accompanying heat becomes significant. For every watt delivered to the load, the amplifier itself, at best, uses an extra watt. For high power amplifiers this means very large and expensive power supplies and heat sinks.|$|R
