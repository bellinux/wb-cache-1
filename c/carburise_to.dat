40|$|Iron ore {{reduction}} and iron cementation by H 2 -CH 4 -Ar gas mixtures were investigated {{in a laboratory}} isothermal fixed bed reactor in the temperature range 600 - 925 °C. Iron ore was first reduced to metallic iron by hydrogen, then metallic iron was <b>carburised</b> <b>to</b> cementite by methane. Increasing temperature and hydrogen content accelerated the reduction process. However, for > 55 vol. -%, the effect of H 2 content was not significant. Methane had almost {{no effect on the}} reduction process. Increasing temperature increased the rate of iron cementation and also the rate of free carbon deposition. Optimum conditions for cementite formation were: temperature 750 °C and reducing/carburising gas contents of 40 - 55 vol. -%H 2 and 35 vol. -%CH 4. Under these conditions, reduction of iron ore to cementite was completed in ~ 15 min.

40|$|Abstract. Gas {{quenching}} in vacuum furnaces is {{an increasingly}} attractive option {{because it has}} a low environmental impact and the least distortion of parts being treated. Whilst nitrogen {{is by far the most}} common quenching gas, helium is a viable option where higher cooling rates are required, particularly for carburised components. This paper explores the improvements in gas quenching technology that allow components manufactured from standard <b>carburising</b> steels <b>to</b> be quenched with high-pressure helium and illustrates the improvements it offers over high pressure nitrogen quenching. As helium is an expensive rare gas, recycle systems make its use more economically attractive. The factors that need to be taken into account when designing such systems, including the necessity for purification, are discussed. Sources of helium and the means of delivery, particularly in Asia, are also covered...|$|R

The new experimental method was developed to assess the decarburising effects of high titania slags, typical of ironmaking with titaniferous ores or sands.

40|$|Low {{temperature}} plasma {{surface engineering}} {{has been a}} useful method for increasing the hardness and wear resistance of austenitic stainless steel without reducing the corrosion resistance of this alloy. Plasma carburising {{is of particular interest}} as it produces thicker hardened layers than plasma nitriding, and an equivalent improvement in the tribological and corrosion performance of the base material. In this project, the active screen (AS) plasma technique was used <b>to</b> <b>carburise</b> austenitic stainless steel AISI 316 and the obtained layer of carbon expanded austenite was compared with the one produced by conventional DC plasma treatments. The hardening and wear resistance produced by AS and DC plasma carburising were equivalent. With regard to corrosion, the AS treated material performed better than its DC counterpart {{as a consequence of the}} improved surface quality of the former. The mechanism of AS carburising was comparatively studied with its AS nitriding counterpart. Different experimental arrangements and two plasma diagnostic techniques were used for this purpose: optical emission spectroscopy and electrostatic probes. The evidence shows that AS nitriding relies on the deposition of iron nitrides and the active species in the plasma to produce hardening, whilst AS carburising requires the plasma activation and moderate ion bombardment.

The {{aim of the}} project was to develop further understanding of cementite stability under conditions relevant to direct ironmaking and the mechanism of cementite decomposition. The reduction of hematite and ironsand by hydrogen-methane-argon gas mixtures was investigated from 600 ºC to 1100 ºC. Iron oxides were reduced by hydrogen to metallic iron, which was <b>carburised</b> by methane <b>to</b> form cementite. The hematite ore was reduced more quickly than the ironsand. Preoxidation of the ironsand accelerated its reduction. Hematite was converted to cementite faster than preoxidised ironsand.

40|$|This {{preliminary}} study demonstrates that surface engineered austempered ductile iron {{is a valid}} alternative gear material <b>to</b> <b>carburised</b> steel. The impact energy of ductile cast iron samples in various conditions, including as – cast, austempered at 240 oC and austempered and shot peened using both 0. 7 mm and 1. 4 mm steel balls, was measured. As expected the as-cast material exhibited nominal impact energy. This has been attributed mainly to the pearlitic matrix structure. Austempering generally increases the impact energy. The extent of the improvement is however dependent on the austempering temperature and the resulting microstructure. It was shown that the structure following austempering at 240 oC consists of fine acicular ferrite needles with high aspect ratio and relatively small quantities of retained austenite. These two features account for the comparatively low impact energy and high hardness values. Increasing the austempering temperature to 375 oC leads to structures containing coarser ferrite needled and up to 40 % retained austenite. Various investigators {{have shown that the}} high impact energy of irons austempered in this temperature range is dependent on the percentage retained austenite content(1, 2) and stability of the latter(3). It can be seen that a reduction in size of shot used for peening has the effect of moving the maximum subsurface compressive stress closer to the surface. This increases the surface stress, but results in a shallower compressive surface layer. High surface compressive stresses {{make it more difficult to}} initiate surface cracks and thus properties such as fatigue and impact energy are bound to improve(4). In the case of high surface compressive stresses, the sub-surface becomes critical and thus the advantage of having a deeper affected zone. This may suggest that in order to obtain maximum benefit from peening duplex size shot should be used. Samples austempered at 240 oC and shot peened have higher impact energy values than as cast samples. This may suggest that the fatigue behaviour of gears austempered at the higher temperatures may be superior to those treated at lower temperatures whilst the tribological characteristics may be inferior. This is however not necessarily the case and needs to be investigated further...|$|R
40|$|The {{need for}} more {{efficient}} blast furnaces is even greater now that there are stricter environmental regulations on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Coke within the blast furnace not only supports the furnace bed and allows gas flow, it also carburises liquid iron. The carburisation of iron {{is one of the}} most important reactions and must be better understood if the ironmaking process in the blast furnace is to be made more sustainable. By understanding what coke properties influence the rate at which coke dissolves in iron we can predict a coke?s performance and use it to determine its quality. As carbon dissolution rates have only been determined for a few cokes, a systematic and comprehensive study was conducted on the dissolution of carbon from nine Australian cokes into liquid iron. The kinetics of carbon dissolution from Cokes A to I was measured and a range of experimental techniques were used to elucidate the dominant rate influencing factors. The role of coke structure, coke inorganic matter composition and yield and temperature were investigated. Furthermore, the influence of interfacial products and dynamic wettability studies were also conducted. The carburiser cover method was used to measure carbon pick-up as a function of time over the temperature range of 1450 - 1550 ºC. Fundamental data on the apparent carbon dissolution rate constant (K) in molten iron at 1550 ºC for Cokes A to I were obtained and ranged from K (x 103 s- 1) = 0. 47 to K (x 103 s- 1) = 14. 7. The wide variation in K showed that not all cokes dissolve at similar rates. In fact one of the nine cokes in this investigation dissolved at a rate comparable to graphite dissolution rates. The apparent carbon dissolution activation energy, Ea, for two of the nine cokes plus synthetic graphite (SG) was also determined. The Ea obtained for SG (Ea = 54 kJ / mol) was in agreement with literature values and was consistent with a diffusion controlled mechanism. The observed Ea values for Cokes D and F (313 kJ / mol and 479 kJ / mol respectively) are an order of magnitude larger than the Ea obtained for SG. The difference in Ea between cokes and SG does not appear to be solely due to differences in the structure of the carbon source. The difference in Ea between the cokes was attributed to differences in their inorganic matter composition. The interfacial contact area is a function of inorganic matter yield and composition, which in turn is a function of temperature. Therefore, as temperature decreases the slag / ash layer produced at the carbon / iron interface can increase in area and viscosity and thus hinder carbon dissolution and transfer, and increasing the apparent activation energy for carbon dissolution. Thus, the differences in viscosity and melting temperature of the interfacial product play a key role. Wettability experiments were carried out using the sessile drop technique. The wettability of Cokes D, F and G with liquid iron at 1550 ºC was measured as a function of time. All three coke samples showed non-wetting behaviour with contact angles ranging between 123 - 129 º in the initial stages and between 109 - 114 º after two hours of contact. The differences in the wettability of the three coke samples could not explain the large differences in dissolution rates observed between these cokes. Thus, the wettability of these coke samples was not considered a dominant factor in influencing the rate of carbon dissolution. The sessile drop technique was also used to study the interfacial products formed at the coke / iron interface. The interfacial products formed on the underside of the iron droplet after contact with Cokes F and G were initially different in regards to the morphology and chemical composition. The interfacial product formed with Coke G had a network or mesh like structure that seemed to wet the iron droplet much better than the interfacial product formed with Coke F. In contrast, Fe globules and discrete interfacial products were observed in Coke F. It was suggested that this was due to differences in inorganic matter content, especially in calcium (Ca) and sulfur (S) content in the coke. Formation of interfacial products containing sulfides, such as calcium sulfide (CaS) and manganese sulfide (MnS), were observed on the iron side of the interface of both Cokes F and G. As a result, the interfacial products can act as a physical barrier blocking iron and coke contact, thus reducing the contact area for carbon dissolution and decreasing the rate of carbon dissolution. The presence of MnS may act to lower the liquidus temperature of the interfacial product, which in turn can affect the overall viscosity of the interfacial layer. Thus, the deposition of reaction products at the interfacial region can have a significant effect on carbon dissolution rates. The mineral pyrrhotite was also identified as a significant factor in influencing the rate of carbon dissolution. Electron dispersive X-ray analyses of Coke F identified iron to be in close association with sulfur. These Fe / S species have atomic ratio similar to pyrrhotite (Fe 1 -xS) or troilite (FeS). Pyrrhotite in coke can decompose to release gaseous sulfur and metallic iron, which can be carburised by carbon in the surrounding area to form Fe-C particles. Thus, carburisation of liquid iron can occur via Fe-C particles. There was little difference in structure between the nine coke samples and therefore the high dissolution rates of Coke F, cannot be explained on the basis of crystallite size or anisotropic carbon content. Inorganic matter yield and composition were identified as the dominant rate influencing factors on carbon dissolution. More specifically: - High content of iron phases, such as iron oxides and pyrrhotite, can lead to an increase in carbon dissolution rates. This maybe due to increased amounts of Fe-C particles that are formed upon the reduction of magnetite and decomposition of pyrrhotite, and carried through the slag layer <b>to</b> <b>carburise</b> the bulk liquid iron. - High aluminium oxide content can lead to a decrease in carbon dissolution rates. This maybe due to higher ash fusion / melting temperature or decrease in wettability, both of which lead to a decrease in carbon / iron contact area. - Formation of interfacial products, such as CaS and MnS, can lead to a decrease in carbon dissolution rates. Such products can act as a physical barrier blocking iron and coke contact, thus reducing the contact area for carbon dissolution. However, the presence of MnS may act to lower the liquidus temperature of the interfacial product. - An increase in temperature increases the rate of carbon dissolution. This dependence is predominantly due to the composition of the inorganic matter present in cokes, which influences the viscosity and melting point of the interfacial product formed and hence contact area between coke and iron...|$|R
