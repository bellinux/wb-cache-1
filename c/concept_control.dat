40|$|The sociotechnical {{concepts}} of responsible autonomy {{and to be}} in control were originally developed from men’s work in order to describe and develop mostly industrial work. This article explores how these conceptions may be useful in modern service work, when working with humans. It is based on a set of development projects in mainly municipal care institutions in Norway, between 2000 and 2011. The projects were theoretically grounded in the Norwegian and international sociotechnical system theory (STS) tradition. It argues that there are many valuable lessons to be learnt from this tradition also concerning nursing and care work in the municipalities. However, the article points to a need for development of the <b>concept</b> <b>control</b> as autonomy to embrace “working with humans. ” A central finding is that assistance and support from and to colleagues are prerequisites for “being in control. ” Moreover, that development of trust through communication alongside work is necessary in order to establish relations of mutual support. Trust and mutual support point to the social relations at work; so in this way it takes the <b>concept</b> <b>control</b> as autonomy from an individual to a more collective concept as Trist et al. (1963) and Herbst (1974 / 1993) defined their concept of control as collective responsible autonomy. In a prospective perspective, the article sets up the hypothesis that an organization that combines the two, an individual together with a more collective scope on autonomy when working with humans, will meet what Kira (2006) calls as regenerative work. This means sustainability—in resources involved; health, quality, and milieu—through the staff ’s dominion over the conditions of their work...|$|E

To improve the Ornicopter performance and understand how the Ornicopter should be designed, in this paper, the Ornicopter design is unfrozen and optimized for the flight envelope. The optimization result shows that with a proper design, the Ornicopter performance can be improved dramatically. A similar flight envelope as the Bo- 105 can be achieved for the Ornicopter.

40|$|Fixed-wing micro air {{vehicles}} (MAV) {{are very}} attractive for outdoor surveillance missions since they generally offer better payload and endurance capabilities than rotorcraft or flapping-wing vehicles of equal size. They are generally less challenging to control than helicopter in outdoor environment. However, high wing loading associated with stringent dimension constraints requires high cruise speeds for fixed-wing MAVs {{and it has}} been difficult so far to achieve good performances at low-speed flight using fixed-wing configurations. The present paper investigates the possibility to improve the aerodynamic performance of classical fixed-wing MAV concepts so that high cruise speed is maintained for covertness and stable hover flight is achieved to allow building intrusion and indoor surveillance. Monoplane wing plan forms are compared with biplane concepts using low-speed wind tunnel measurements and numerical calculations including viscous effects. Wind-tunnel measurements including the influence of counter-rotating propellers indicate that a biplane-twin propeller MAV configuration can drastically increase low-speed and high-speed aerodynamic performances over the classical monoplane fixed-wing <b>concept.</b> <b>Control</b> in hover flight can highly benefit from the effect of counter-rotating propellers as demonstrated by flight tests.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this project {{was to investigate the}} feasibility of constructing a heat pump suitable for use as a heat rejection device in applications such as a lunar base. In this situation, direct heat rejection through the use of radiators is not possible at a temperature suitable for lde support systems. Initial analysis of a heat pump of this type called for a temperature lift of approximately 378 deg. K, which is considerably higher than is commonly called for in HVAC and refrigeration applications where heat pumps are most often employed. Also because of the variation of the rejection temperature (from 100 to 381 deg. K), extreme flexibility in the configuration and operation of the heat pump is required. A three-stage compression cycle using a refrigerant such as CFC- 11 or HCFC- 123 was formulated with operation possible with one, two or three stages of compression. Also, to meet the redundancy requirements, compression was divided up over multiple compressors in each stage. A control scheme was devised that allowed these multiple compressors to be operated as required so that the heat pump could perform with variable heat loads and rejection conditions. A prototype heat pump was designed and constructed to investigate the key elements of the high-lift heat pump <b>concept.</b> <b>Control</b> software was written and implemented in the prototype to allow fully automatic operation.

Assessments were made for takeoff, transition, hover, and landing, including precision hover and landing aboard an LPH-type amphibious assault ship in the presence of winds and rough seas. Results yielded Level 1 pilot ratings for the flightpath and vertical velocity command modes for a range of land-based and shipboard operation and were consistent with previous experience with earlier control laws and displays for this STOVL <b>concept.</b> <b>Control</b> mode blending was performed over speed ranges in accord with the pilot's tasks and with the change of the basic aircraft's characteristics between wing-borne and hover flight. Blending of yaw control from heading command in hover to sideslip command in wing-borne flight performed over a broad speed range helped reduce yaw transients during acceleration through the low speed regime. Although the pilots appreciated conformality of flightpath and guidance symbols with the external scene during the approach, increased sensitivity of the symbols for lateral path tracking elevated the pilots' control activity in the presence of turbulence.

40|$|In {{recent years}} India faces {{demanding}} challenges in covering an aggressively increasing electricity consumption through {{economic growth and}} progressive consumer requirements. Renewable sources and small distributed power generators {{have been identified as}} one of the options to establish a diversified power supply infrastructure. The present situation offers promising opportunities for fuel cell systems, as “grid-parity” is not the common measure of competitiveness, but rather the installation speed and availability of reliable power sources. Contracted by the company h 2 e Power Systems Pvt. Ltd. based in Pune, India, Fraunhofer IKTS has developed a 1 kW(el) SOFC power generator during a three-year system engineering and technology transfer project. The fuel cell system is based on the CFY stack technology by Plansee SE and IKTS, incorporating state-of-the-art ESC with Scandia-doped Zirconia electrolytes. CFY-stacks have proven to be robust and reliable, showing power degradation rates below 0. 6 % per 1. 000 hours during endurance operation over 20. 000 hours and a cyclization capability of more than 120 near-system cycles under full RedOx-conditions. For the SOFC power generator a CFY stack is integrated with a pre-reformer, a tail-gas oxidizer and heat exchangers into a HotBox-module following a novel concept for least-space-demanding reactor integration and flow distribution. Aside from compactness, a simple and robust, yet highly efficient system concept was set as the primary development goal for the project. To meet these requirements, two major design decisions have been introduced in the process layout, i. e. a rated fuel utilization in the stack of 85 % as well as a POX-air pre-heater for reducing the reformer air flow to lowest possible values. This approach leads to a water-less SOFC system with a net electrical efficiency above 40 %. In 2015, two Proof-of-Concept (PoC) prototype systems were commissioned and tested at IKTS. One of the PoC-prototypes was installed later at the customer’s laboratory in Pune, India, for test and demonstration purposes. In Project Phase II, three improved demonstration prototypes are built at IKTS until May 2016, to be shipped to India for initial demonstration projects and field trials. At the same time, the technology transfer to the customer is initiated, in order to enable for a local manufacturing and deployment of SOFC systems in India.

40|$|Condition {{monitoring}} {{business has}} been of interest to Sulzer since the 1990 s when the Sulzer Diagnostic System (SUDIS) was developed. However, since the invention of SUDIS, Sulzer has had limited commercial success with condition monitoring products and services. Several recent investigations at Sulzer have explored possibilities for new machine monitoring business, with the most recent being the condition monitoring equipment survey of Nyitray. This report leads on {{from the work of}} Nyitray to evaluate the attractiveness of current machine monitoring markets and the strength of current and <b>concept</b> <b>control</b> and monitoring business models. Sales and customer support services (CSS) staff in all business segments and areas were surveyed for information regarding customer demand for machine monitoring solutions. The results of the survey lacked a unified view on customer needs, indicating that customer needs vary significantly with industry and region. Results also indicated that Sulzer sales and CSS staff currently have very little contact with customers regarding machine monitoring issues, which was expected since Sulzer currently has very limited machine monitoring offers. Overall customer interest in machine monitoring for cost saving purposes is high. Moreover, some customers expect equipment manufactures like Sulzer to support their equipment with machine monitoring offers. Business model environmental factors for each Sulzer Pumps focus market were identified allowing the most attractive markets for machine monitoring business to be selected. A survey of Sulzer Pumps business segment heads also contributed to the market selection process. This evaluation concluded that the water and power generation industries had favourable markets for machine monitoring business, mainly because Sulzer has a good competitive position in these markets. Unfortunately pumps in the electricity generation industry are relatively reliable compared to other machinery such as electrical generators. Hence, opportunities identified in the electricity generation industry seemed to be more appropriate for Sulzer Turbo Services than Sulzer Pumps. However, cross-divisional collaboration of Sulzer Pumps and Sulzer Turbo services would allow Sulzer to offer solutions for entire drivetrains. Other opportunities suitable for Sulzer Pumps were identified in the district heating and water industries, with energy monitoring being a common theme. An evaluation of the oil pipeline industry yielded that there is significant market demand for machine and pipeline monitoring. However, Sulzer currently does not have the experience or resources to provide the demanded monitoring services independently. Hence searching for key partners or acquisition targets was acknowledged as an essential activity for Sulzer Pumps to enter this market. Another means of market entry would be to develop novel technology or integrate emerging technologies (e. g. online viscosity sensors) into new pipeline monitoring solutions, i. e. to create a novel value proposition. Subsequent feedback from Sulzer alliance managers concluded that oil pipeline customer acquisition may be difficult since many pipeline companies already have monitoring solutions which they are satisfied with. Hence the oil pipeline market is not recommended for new machine monitoring business ventures. ABS pump control and monitoring solutions are currently the only machine monitoring solutions offered by Sulzer Pumps. In this study the business model behind these solutions was analysed to evaluate its strength and identify areas for improvement. Although the ABS control and monitoring business model is profitable, sales figures are below their potential. Recommendations to improve the business models effectiveness mainly focused on improving channels through which Sulzer connects with its customers. These included improving Sulzer digital marketing material, improving product selection tools, increasing complementary advertising and quotation contents to connect Sulzer control and monitoring products with pump equipment products, and most importantly increasing the amount of sales and CSS staff training...|$|E
40|$|The main {{contribution}} of this thesis is conceptual design consideration {{to improve the}} CO 2 capture in absorption/stripping process. In the first stage the conventional configuration of capture plant is optimized. The important parameters for optimization are absorber and stripper height, rich and lean loading, stripper pressure and temperature. The intercooling studies showed that intercooling {{can be an effective}} strategy to reduce the energy requirement of the capture plant. The theoretical best place for intercooling is defined about 1 / 4 th of the column height from the bottom. Intercooling studies are done for two solvents, MEA and DEA. The effects of different parameters like lean loading, amine concentration, cooling temperature, lean amine temperature are investigated in chapter 2. In chapter 3 the effect of heat distribution or inter-heating on the total energy requirement for CO 2 stripping is investigated. The results show that inter-heating can have both negative and positive effects on the total energy requirement. If only one heat source at constant temperature exist, the inter-heating will increase the total energy requirement. If there are other heat sources at different temperatures, inter-heating is maybe beneficial. It depends on the energy price of the different heat sources and the temperature profile of the column. If some energy utilizes from hot process streams in the inter-heater, it can reduce the energy requirement. As a case study, utilizing heat from lean amine in the inter-heater is investigated. The simulation results show a saving up to 6. 4 and 11. 3 percent by one and two inter-heater respectively. In chapter 4 a techno-economic study is given for five different configurations for post combustion CO 2 capture of a flue gas with about 12 percent CO 2 on wet basis, produced by a 150 MW coal power plant. These are the conventional configuration as a benchmark, splitstream, multi-pressure stripper, vapor recompression and compressor integration. Among these, the vapor recompression is the best configuration because it had the lowest total capture cost and CO 2 avoided cost. The split-stream configuration with cooling of semi-lean amine is the second best. In chapter 5, a self-optimizing <b>concept</b> <b>control</b> structure is designed for a post-combustion CO 2 capturing plant. The focus of this work is to control of the plant with the aim of staying close to the optimal operating conditions. The cost function to be minimized is the energy demand of the plant. Firstly we define the degree of freedom and next we look for selfoptimizing variables for the remaining unconstrained variables. We found the temperature close to the top (tray no. 4) of the stripper to be a good CV for the remaining unconstrained degree of freedom. To validate the proposed structure, dynamic simulation is done and performance of the control structure is tested. The dynamic behavior of the split-stream and the vapor recompression configurations are investigated, and the plant responses are compared with the conventional configuration as a benchmark. All process configurations are operationally feasible with the proposed control configuration. From these case studies we could conclude that the conventional configuration has the best dynamic behavior and is the most stable one. The vapor recompression configuration can handle disturbances better than the split-stream configuration. Finally, a natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) power plant integrated to a chemical solvent absorber/stripping capture plant is investigated. The power plant capacity is about 430 MW. The capture ratio is 90 % and the captured CO 2 compressed to 110 bar. The study is done at both full load and part load conditions. CO 2 capture causes 7. 5 % reduction in the power plant net efficiency. 4. 6 % of energy penalty is related to the steam extraction and 2. 9 % is related to electricity consumption. The integration of the power plant with the compression section of the capture plant for preheating the water to the HRSG cannot improve the net plant efficiency. In the part load investigation, results showed the net efficiency of the variable IGVs gas turbine is about 6. 2 % higher than the efficiency of the constant IGVs gas turbine at 50 % load. Also the power plant with the throttled valve configuration for steam extraction has a better performance than the sliding configuration steam extraction.
