40|$|The central bolt (1) {{protrudes}} on {{both sides}} of the bushing (2) on which it turns. The bushing is joined to inner strips (3). Further bushings (5) to which outer strips (4) are fixed and next to the central bushing surround the bolt. At least one of the further bushings or the central bushing has a free-wheeling sleeve, a clamp, and a <b>clamping</b> <b>roller</b> co-operating with the bolt and enabling the bolt to rotate in relation to the bushing in a turning and contrary direction and connecting bolt and bushing. ADVANTAGE - Local wear to bolts of chain links is reduced and life of links prolonged...|$|E
40|$|A low friction, object guidance, and {{gripping}} finger {{device for}} a robotic end effector on a robotic arm is disclosed, having {{a pair of}} robotic fingers each having a finger shaft slideably located on a gripper housing attached to the end effector. Each of the robotic fingers has a roller housing attached to the finger shaft. The roller housing has a ball bearing mounted centering roller located at the center, {{and a pair of}} ball bearing mounted <b>clamping</b> <b>rollers</b> located {{on either side of the}} centering roller. The object has a recess to engage the centering roller and a number of seating ramps for engaging the <b>clamping</b> <b>rollers.</b> The centering roller acts to position and hold the object symmetrically about the centering roller with respect to the X axis and the <b>clamping</b> <b>rollers</b> act to position and hold the object with respect to the Y and Z axis...|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} moon {{shoes were}} introduced in the 1950s and were metal in construction. They were made to fit over the wearer's regular shoes much {{in the same way}} as <b>clamp</b> on <b>roller</b> skates. The Nickelodeon product featured closed sides, plastic construction and bungee style springs which can be considered a safety improvement.|$|R
5000|$|Kick scooters {{have been}} {{handmade}} in industrial urban areas in Europe and the U.S. {{for at least}} 100 years, often as play items made for children to roam the streets. One common home-made version is made by attaching roller skate wheel sets to a board {{with some kind of}} handle, usually an old box. One can lean to turn, or by a second board connected by a crude pivot. The construction was all wood, with 3-4 inch (75-100 mm) wheels with steel ball bearings. An additional advantage of this construction was loud noise, just like from a [...] "real" [...] vehicle. An alternative construction consists of one steel <b>clamp</b> - on <b>roller</b> skate divided into front and rear parts and attached to a wood beam.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The paper {{describes}} a novel technique to record displacements and compute local strains {{at the surface}} of typical geogrid soil reinforcement products using a noncontact high resolution digital CCD camera (video-extensometer) technique. Specimens of biaxial polypropylene (PP) geogrid, knitted polyester (PET) geogrid, and uniaxial high-density polyethylene (HDPE) geogrid were subjected to in-isolation wide-width strip tensile loading under constant rate of strain (CRS), constant load (creep), and stress relaxation load paths. The specimens were gripped using a set of split <b>roller</b> <b>clamps.</b> Targets painted {{on the surface of}} the specimens were tracked in both vertical and horizontal directions using a commercially available CCD camera with ancillary hardware and software. The paper examines repeatability of the test methodology and demonstrates the ability of the method to record strains at high resolution up to rupture and to identify nonuniform distribution of axial and lateral strains in geogrid specimens...|$|R
40|$|Buckling of beams made of {{functionally}} graded materials (FGM) under thermomechanical loading is analyzed herein. Properties of {{the constituents}} {{are considered to}} be functions of temperature and thickness coordinate. The derivation of the equations is based on the Timoshenko beam theory, where the effect of shear is included. It is assumed that the mechanical and thermal nonhomogeneous properties of beam vary smoothly by distribution of the power law index across the thickness of the beam. The equilibrium and stability equations for an FGM beam are derived and the existence of bifurcation buckling is examined. The beam is assumed under three types of thermal loadings; namely, the uniform temperature rise, heat conduction across the thickness, and linear distribution across the thickness. Various types of boundary conditions are assumed for the beam with combination of <b>roller,</b> <b>clamped,</b> and simply-supported edges. In each case of boundary conditions and loading, closed form solutions for the critical buckling temperature of the beam is presented. The results are compared with the isotropic homogeneous beams, that are reported in the literature, by reducing the results of the functionally graded beam to the isotropic homogeneous beam...|$|R
30|$|To {{establish}} the oral cancer model, golden Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus, Harlan Sprague–Dawley, San Diego, CA) were topically treated with 0.5 % (w/v) 9, 10 -dimethyl- 1, 2 -benzanthracene (DMBA, Sigma) in mineral oil {{three times per}} week for 4 - 6  weeks to induce dysplasia in one cheek pouch in each animal. The contralateral cheek pouch of the hamster received mineral oil application only. All animal protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC, 97 - 1972) at the University of California, Irvine. Acid degradable and control Au clusters were synthesized, characterized, and applied on the hamster cheek pouches using a multi-modal delivery method (microneedles for penetration and ultrasound for distribution of Au NCs). OCT/DvOCT was used to observe the optical property changes of stimuli-responsive Au clusters. All the OCT/DvOCT Imaging was performed in the cheek pouch of the anesthetized hamster by gently clamping the tissues to a microscope stage using a custom-built, ring-shaped <b>clamp.</b> CR 3 <b>roller</b> microneedles (MTS dermaroller with 200  μm depth; Clinical Resolution Laboratory, Inc., Beverly Hills, CA) were rolled on both the DMBA-untreated and control sides of the hamster cheek pouches three times at three different angles. Then, 200  μL of Au cluster solution (7.05  ×  109 particles/mL) were administration by dropping it directly into the 1 -cm-diameter aperture of the ring-shaped clamp. After 10  min Au cluster topical administration, ultrasonic force (0.3  W/cm 2 of 1  MHz) {{was applied to the}} cheek pouch using the Dynatron 125 ultrasonicator (Dynatronics Corporation, Salt Lake City, UT) for 1  min in the presence of ultrasound gel, followed by OCT/DvOCT imaging. After OCT/DvOCT imaging, all the OCT/DvOCT images were quantified with the scion image process (Scion Corporation).|$|R
