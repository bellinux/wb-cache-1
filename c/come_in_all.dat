25|$|Phycobilins are a {{third group}} of {{pigments}} found in cyanobacteria, and glaucophyte, red algal, and cryptophyte chloroplasts. Phycobilins <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>all</b> colors, though phycoerytherin {{is one of}} the pigments that makes many red algae red. Phycobilins often organize into relatively large protein complexes about 40 nanometers across called phycobilisomes. Like photosystem I and ATP synthase, phycobilisomes jut into the stroma, preventing thylakoid stacking in red algal chloroplasts. Cryptophyte chloroplasts and some cyanobacteria don't have their phycobilin pigments organized into phycobilisomes, and keep them in their thylakoid space instead.|$|E

500|$|In an October 2013 {{interview}} with BBC 6Music, Jones confirmed that Strummer did have intentions of a Clash reunion {{and in fact}} new music was being written for a possible album. In the months prior to Strummer's death, Jones and Strummer began working on new music for what he thought {{would be the next}} Mescaleros album. Jones said [...] "We wrote a batch – we didn't use to write one, we used to write a batch at a time – like gumbo. The idea was {{he was going to go}} into the studio with the Mescaleros during the day and then send them all home. I'd <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>all</b> night and we'd all work all night." [...] Jones said months had passed following their work together when he ran into Strummer at an event.

500|$|The album {{opens with}} [...] "Roar", a midtempo synth-driven power pop track. Musically, it {{contains}} elements of arena rock and glam rock, while lyrically {{it is an}} empowerment anthem. Comparisons were established between [...] "Roar" [...] and [...] "Brave" [...] by Sara Bareilles. [...] "Legendary Lovers", a bhangra-based song, deals {{with the ideas of}} karma and infinity. [...] "Birthday" [...] was described by Perry as her own attempt at [...] "writing something Mariah Carey would have put on her first record". Musically, it is a [...] "fluffy" [...] pop song that is primarily styled in the genre of disco. [...] "Walking on Air", the album's second promotional single, is an early 1990s-inspired deep house-Eurodance-disco song, inspired heavily by CeCe Peniston and Crystal Waters. It was produced by Klas Åhlund and Max Martin. [...] "Unconditionally", Perry's personal favorite song on the album and second official single, is a [...] "soaring" [...] power ballad with an [...] "epic chorus". Jason Lipshutz from Billboard noted that the song includes a [...] "woodblock percussion" [...] as well as [...] "a dramatic bass line" [...] and deemed it the album's [...] "most mature offering". Furthermore, he called it [...] "an ode to love that looks past all flaws" [...] and stated that the song acts as a [...] "compellingly grounded predicate" [...] to the title track from Teenage Dream. Perry herself described the song as a song about unconditional love that could <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>all</b> forms, including those from relationships, from parent-to-child, and from sibling-to-sibling.|$|E

2500|$|Serving as the album's most radio-friendly track, [...] "Ice Cream" [...] was {{released}} September 25, 1995, with [...] "Incarcerated Scarfaces" [...] as its B-side. This {{proved to be}} the most successful single off the album, as it reached the 37th spot on the Billboard Hot 100, and the fifth spot on the Hot Rap Singles chart. The song uses different flavor variants of ice cream as a metaphor for different races of women. Raekwon later commented [...] "we wanted to reach out and let the women know that we respected them as queens. And queens, much like ice cream, <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>all</b> different flavors." [...] The song marks the second appearance of Cappadonna on the album, and serves as his break-through performance, as it would give him commercial exposure. In regard to his guest spot, Cappadonna later recalled [...] "I had heard Rae's and Ghost's verses on there. And I had made a joke about me getting on the track, and RZA took it seriously and was like [...] "Yo, go ahead. Lace that." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{attempting}} to define noise music and its value, Paul Hegarty (2007) cites {{the work of}} noted cultural critics Jean Baudrillard, Georges Bataille and Theodor Adorno and through their work traces the history of [...] "noise". He defines noise at different times as [...] "intrusive, unwanted", [...] "lacking skill, not being appropriate" [...] and [...] "a threatening emptiness". He traces these trends starting with 18th-century concert hall music. Hegarty contends that it is John Cage's composition 4'33", in which an audience sits through {{four and a half}} minutes of [...] "silence" [...] (Cage 1973), that represents the beginning of noise music proper. For Hegarty, [...] "noise music", as with 4'33", is that music made up of incidental sounds that represent perfectly the tension between [...] "desirable" [...] sound (properly played musical notes) and undesirable [...] "noise" [...] that make up all noise music from Erik Satie to NON to Glenn Branca. Writing about Japanese noise music, Hegarty suggests that [...] "it is not a genre, {{but it is also a}} genre that is multiple, and characterized by this very multiplicity... Japanese noise music can <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>all</b> styles, referring to all other genres... but crucially asks the question of genre—what does it mean to be categorized, categorizable, definable?" [...] (Hegarty 2007:133).|$|E
2500|$|Startup {{companies}} can <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>all</b> forms and sizes. Some {{of the critical}} tasks are to build a co-founder team to secure key skills, know-how, financial resources, and other elements to conduct research on the target market. Typically, a startup will begin by building a first minimum viable product (MVP), a prototype, to validate, assess and develop the new ideas or business concepts. [...] In addition, startups founders do research to deepen {{their understanding of the}} ideas, technologies or business concepts and their commercial potential. A Shareholders' agreement (SHA) is often agreed early on to confirm the commitment, ownership and contributions of the founders and investors and to deal with the intellectual properties and assets that may be generated by the startup. Business models for startups are generally found via a [...] "bottom-up" [...] or [...] "top-down" [...] approach. A company may cease to be a startup as it passes various milestones, such as becoming publicly traded on the stock market in an Initial Public Offering (IPO), or ceasing to exist as an independent entity via a merger or acquisition. Companies may also fail and cease to operate altogether, an outcome that is very likely for startups, given that they are developing disruptive innovations which may not function as expected and for which there may not be market demand, even when the product or service is finally developed. Given that startups operate in high-risk sectors, it can also be hard to attract investors to support the product/service development or attract buyers.|$|E

2500|$|A {{food web}} (or food cycle) {{is a natural}} {{interconnection}} [...] of food chains and a graphical representation (usually an image) of what-eats-what in an ecological community. [...] Another name for food web is consumer-resource system. Ecologists can broadly lump all life forms into one of two categories called trophic levels: 1) the autotrophs, and 2) the heterotrophs. To maintain their bodies, grow, develop, and to reproduce, autotrophs produce organic matter from inorganic substances, including both minerals and gases such as carbon dioxide. These chemical reactions require energy, which mainly comes from the Sun and largely by photosynthesis, although a very small amount comes from hydrothermal vents and hot springs. [...] A gradient exists between trophic levels running from complete autotrophs that obtain their sole source of carbon from the atmosphere, to mixotrophs (such as carnivorous plants) that are autotrophic organisms that partially obtain organic matter from sources other than the atmosphere, and complete heterotrophs that must feed to obtain organic matter. The linkages in a food web illustrate the feeding pathways, such as where heterotrophs obtain organic matter by feeding on autotrophs and other heterotrophs. The food web is a simplified illustration of the various methods of feeding that links an ecosystem into a unified system of exchange. There are different kinds of feeding relations that can be roughly divided into herbivory, carnivory, scavenging and parasitism. Some of the organic matter eaten by heterotrophs, such as sugars, provides energy. Autotrophs and heterotrophs <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>all</b> sizes, from microscopic to many tonnes - from cyanobacteria to giant redwoods, and from viruses and bdellovibrio to blue whales.|$|E
