5|$|Aircraft deicing {{vehicles}} {{have also}} improved since the accident, usually {{consisting of a}} large tanker truck, containing the concentrated de-icing fluid, with a water feed to dilute the fluid according to the ambient temperature. The vehicle also normally has a <b>cherry</b> <b>picker</b> crane, allowing the operator to spray the entire aircraft in as little time as possible; an entire Boeing 737 can be treated in under 10 minutes by a single de-icing vehicle. Airport runways are also deiced by sprayers fitted with long spraying arms. These arms are wide enough to cross the entire runway, and allow de-icing of the entire airstrip {{to take place in}} a single pass, reducing the length of time that the runway is unavailable.|$|E
5|$|The {{interiors}} were {{filmed in}} two specially converted aircraft hangars near Bury St. Edmunds in Suffolk, which were leased for £1,500; this cost-measure resulted {{in much of}} the dialogue having to be re-recorded later, because the tin roofs of the hangars caused an echo. The exterior shots range from the Dunwich Coast (for the scene with the fisherman) to Langley Park outside London (for the scene where Stearne escapes capture). The tracking shot of the ambush after the opening credits was filmed at Black Park in southeast Buckinghamshire, a location frequently used by Hammer Film Productions. Lavenham Square (in Lavenham, Suffolk), site of the witch-burning scene, was the real Lavenham Market Square; the crew lowered TV antennas and telephone wires and Waddilove hired a <b>cherry</b> <b>picker</b> from a local utility company for £10, because the unit couldn't afford a camera crane. The countryside vistas seen in the chase scenes on horseback were shot on the Stanford Battle Area near Thetford, Norfolk— the producer, through connections with the government, was able to lease parts of the area. The church used in the film is St John The Evangelist in Rushford in Norfolk. The moat drowning and hanging scenes were filmed at Kentwell Hall, in Long Melford. The climax of the film was shot at Orford Castle, on the coast of East Anglia, which is an English Heritage property. Filming wrapped as scheduled on 13 November 1967.|$|E

500|$|Another {{series of}} pranks was planned for Thanksgiving weekend in 2009, {{involving}} transforming MIT into [...] "Caltech East: School of Humanities". [...] The pranks were planned {{over the course}} of six months. [...] Caltech students intended to deploy two large banners that were designed to be easy to place, but removal would require a <b>cherry</b> <b>picker</b> or a rappel. [...] However, the design of MIT's Killian Court prevented the placement of one of them, and another was intercepted by MIT security before its deployment could be completed. [...] Another fake edition of The Tech was released, stating that students would be required to take a core of literature, history, philosophy, and economics, but science subjects would be eliminated. [...] Although the failure of the pranks was considered to be a disappointment, Caltech and MIT students afterwards shared breakfast at a local diner.|$|E
500|$|Meteor Studios {{produced}} the roller-coaster and subway crashes, and Digital Dimension handled the individual post-premonition death scenes. The death of Ian McKinley, who is bisected by a <b>cherry</b> <b>picker,</b> was especially challenging. A clean plate of the bucket falling was originally {{shot with a}} plate of Lemche acting crushed and falling to the ground, with his bottom half in a partial green-screen suit. After setting those plates, Wong said that [...] "he wanted more of a gruesome punch for the shot". A standard CGI body of Lemche's height was used; several animation simulations of crushing the body with a CGI object were filmed, and the director picked the version he liked the most. A new plate was then filmed, with Lemche imitating the chosen animation and positioning his body at the end. The scene in which Ashley and Ashlyn are killed in tanning beds was handled by Soho VFX instead of Digital Dimension. It consisted of about 35 shots of CG skin, glass, fire and smoke mixed with live fire and smoke. For the subway crash in the film's epilogue, a CG environment reproducing the main volumes of the set was generated. The film was edited by Chris G. Willingham, the Emmy-winning editor of 24 (2001–2010).|$|E
50|$|Cherry picking attracts controversy. Teammates may {{regard the}} <b>cherry</b> <b>picker</b> as {{something}} less than a full teammate or a complete athlete, or resent the points the <b>cherry</b> <b>picker</b> is credited with. Fans may use the role as a <b>cherry</b> <b>picker</b> to disparage a player, or may view the team's style of play as illegitimate. Opponents, especially if the play is successful against them, may view it as equally unsportsmanlike to running up the score needlessly.|$|E

5000|$|If {{the opponents}} do not {{designate}} {{a player to}} stay near the <b>cherry</b> <b>picker,</b> {{they will have a}} 5-on-4 advantage as they try to score, but if the defense steals the ball, it could make a long pass to the <b>cherry</b> <b>picker</b> for an uncontested basket.

Her question is quickly answered when Julie's friend, Perry Malinowski, is impaled by a flagpole launched by a rope tied to the horse. Wendy saves Kevin from an exploding propane canister and is confronted by a deranged Ian, who blames her for Erin's death. Fireworks go off and nearly hit Wendy, but she ducks and they strike a nearby <b>cherry</b> <b>picker</b> instead. Ian shouts that Death cannot kill him, and the <b>cherry</b> <b>picker</b> collapses and crushes him. Wendy thinks that the <b>cherry</b> <b>picker</b> was meant for her, but Ian inadvertently took her place.|$|E
