CCL's are typically used for depth correlation and can be an indicator of line overspeed when logging in heavy fluids. A CCL operates on Faraday's Law of Induction. Two magnets are separated by a coil of copper wire. As the CCL passes by a casing joint, or collar, the difference in metal thickness across the two magnets induces a <b>current</b> <b>spike</b> in the coil. This <b>current</b> <b>spike</b> is sent uphole and logged as what's called a collar kick on the cased hole log.|$|E

Traditionally, a higher gate resistance is chosen to reduce voltage/current spikes. Since the switching loss will increase remarkably, an active gate voltage control scheme is developed to improve efficiency of hard switching circuits while the undesirable voltage and/or <b>current</b> <b>spikes</b> are minimized. ...|$|R
40|$|Amperometry at {{a carbon}} fiber {{microelectrode}} modified with {{a composite of}} ruthenium oxide and cyanoruthenate was used to monitor chemical secretions of single pancreatic beta cells from rats and humans.

50|$|The emitter-base Zener diodes {{can handle}} only smaller {{currents}} as the energy is dissipated {{in the base}} depletion region which is very small. Higher amount of dissipated energy (higher current for longer time, or a short very high <b>current</b> <b>spike)</b> causes thermal damage to the junction and/or its contacts. Partial damage of the junction can shift its Zener voltage. Total destruction of the Zener junction by overheating it and causing migration of metallization across the junction ("spiking") can be used intentionally as a 'Zener zap' antifuse.|$|E

50|$|Zener diodes {{can be used}} as antifuses. The p-n {{junction}} that serves as such diode is overloaded with a <b>current</b> <b>spike</b> and overheated. At temperatures above 100 °C and current densities above 105 A/cm2 the metallization undergoes electromigration and forms spikes through the junction, shorting it out; this process is known as Zener zap in the industry. The spike is formed on and slightly below the silicon surface, just below the passivation layer without damaging it. The conductive shunt therefore does not compromise integrity and reliability of the semiconductor device. Typically a few-millisecond pulse at 100-200 mA is sufficient for common bipolar devices, for a non-optimized antifuse structure; specialized structures will have lower power demands. The resulting resistance of the junction is in the range of 10 ohms.|$|E
40|$|Control of {{coherent}} {{synchrotron radiation}} (CSR) -induced emittance growth {{is essential in}} linear accelerators designed to deliver very high brightness electron beams. Extreme current values at the head and tail of the electron bunch, resulting from strong bunch compression, are responsible for large CSR production leading to significant transverse projected emittance growth. The Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) truncates the head and tail <b>current</b> <b>spikes</b> which greatly improves free electron laser (FEL) performance. Here we consider the underlying dynamics that lead to formation of <b>current</b> <b>spikes</b> (also referred to as current horns), which {{has been identified as}} caustics forming in electron trajectories. We present a method to analytically determine conditions required to avoid the caustic formation and therefore prevent the <b>current</b> <b>spikes</b> from forming. These required conditions can be easily met, without increasing the transverse slice emittance, through inclusion of an octupole magnet {{in the middle of a}} bunch compressor...|$|R

5|$|Since inverter-fed motor cables' {{high-frequency}} <b>current</b> <b>spikes</b> {{can interfere}} with other cabling in facilities, such inverter-fed motor cables should not only be of shielded, symmetrical-geometry design but should also be routed at least 50cm away from signal cables.|$|R
50|$|These {{devices are}} not rated in joules because they operate {{differently}} from the earlier suppressors, {{and they do not}} depend on materials that inherently wear out during repeated surges. SM suppressors are primarily used to control transient voltage surges on electrical power feeds to protected devices. They are essentially heavy-duty low-pass filters connected so that they allow 50/60 Hz line voltages through to the load, while blocking and diverting higher frequencies. This type of suppressor differs from others by using banks of inductors, capacitors and resistors that suppress voltage surges and in rush current to the neutral wire, whereas other designs shunt to the ground wire. Surges are not diverted but actually suppressed. The inductors slow down the energy. Since the inductor in series with the circuit path slows the <b>current</b> <b>spike,</b> the peak surge energy is spread out in the time domain and harmlessly absorbed and slowly released from a capacitor bank.|$|E
50|$|Some {{aircraft}} {{may also}} use electrically heated resistive elements {{embedded in a}} rubber sheet cemented to the leading edges of wings and tail surfaces, propeller leading edges, and helicopter rotor blade leading edges. This de-icing system was developed by United States Rubber Company in 1943. Such systems usually operate continuously. When ice is detected, they first function as de-icing systems, then as anti-icing systems for continued flight in icing conditions. Some aircraft use chemical de-icing systems which pump antifreeze such as alcohol or propylene glycol through small holes in the wing surfaces and at the roots of propeller blades, melting the ice, and making the surface inhospitable to ice formation. A fourth system, developed by NASA, detects ice on the surface by sensing a change in resonance frequency. Once an electronic control module has determined that ice has formed, a large <b>current</b> <b>spike</b> is pumped into the transducers to generate a sharp mechanical shock, cracking the ice layer and causing it to be peeled off by the slipstream.|$|E

40|$|Advanced wet {{tantalum}} capacitors {{allow for}} improved performance of {{power supply systems}} along with substantial reduction of size and weight of the systems that is especially beneficial for space electronics. Due to launch-related stresses, acceptance testing of all space systems includes random vibration test (RVT). However, many types of advanced wet tantalum capacitors cannot pass consistently RVT at conditions specified in MIL-PRF- 39006, which impedes their use in space projects. This requires {{a closer look at}} the existing requirements, modes and mechanisms of failures, specifics of test conditions, and acceptance criteria. In this work, different lots of advanced wet tantalum capacitors from four manufacturers have been tested at step stress random vibration conditions while their currents were monitored before, during, and after the testing. It has been shown that the robustness of the parts and their reliability are mostly due to effective self-healing processes and limited <b>current</b> <b>spiking</b> or minor scintillations caused by RVT do not increase the risk of failures during operation.

40|$|This {{research}} article addresses {{the evaluation of}} power conversion on heavy payload tethered hexarotors where the payloads are high and hovering times are long. Modifications {{were added to the}} power conversion unit based on operation reliability perspective. Since the objective power conversion is large comparing to existing tethered UAVs today, a strategic engineering approach was proposed and tested based on partial observations on <b>current</b> <b>spikes</b> and power thresholds of DCDC switching regulators. Research problem is such that, when UAV motors are consuming low <b>currents,</b> the <b>current</b> <b>spikes</b> are not the plausible cause of direct power failure. But at higher currents even small <b>current</b> <b>spikes</b> could cause power failures. Risk increase with time and situations worsen when UAVs operate under high precision flight controls. When the number of parallel converters are small this becomes a mission critical problem. As a solution, fast switching high current diodes are used at the low voltage high current output to block reverse currents, and then apply low voltage bus bar to prevent dependency issues on particular DCDC module. At the cost of a small power dissipations over diodes, the total current thresholds of UAV become higher. Experiment results shows that with the use of proposed method large number of paralleling switching regulators become possible and heavy payload flights become reliable...|$|R
