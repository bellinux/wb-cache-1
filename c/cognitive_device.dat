According to their proposed SSSM paradigm, the mind is a general-purpose <b>cognitive</b> <b>device</b> shaped almost entirely by culture. After establishing SSSM, Tooby and Cosmides make a case for replacing SSSM with the integrated model (IM), also known as the integrated causal model (ICM), which melds cultural and biological theories for the development of the mind.

40|$|Mechanics of Materials is an {{important}} class in mechanical, biomedical, and civil engineering disciplines as it contains concepts needed for subsequent classes and future job assignments. Mechanics of Materials is also a difficult class as students have not {{been exposed to the}} material previously, the material is cognitively challenging, and the three-dimensional nature of the material requires that students have well-developed spatial visualization skills. Although researchers have made many attempts to improve Mechanics of Materials student learning outcomes using such methods as design projects, group discussions, simulations, and hands-on activities, there is still opportunity to improve instruction. One approach to improving student learning outcomes, combining haptic feedback with computer simulation, has received little attention. ^ The purpose of this dissertation study was to develop a <b>cognitive</b> <b>device</b> to improve students’ conceptual knowledge of beam stress and deflection, to determine how computer simulation visualization support affects students with low spatial visualization skills, and {{to determine the effects of}} haptic feedback on students’ understanding of beam stress and deflection. The <b>cognitive</b> <b>device</b> in this study was designed to operate in two modes: simulation-only mode or simulation combined with haptic feedback mode. The simulation-only mode used a standard computer keyboard and mouse for input, while the haptic feedback mode used an instrumented foam beam for input. ^ A mixed methods approach was used; quantitative methods were used to evaluate changes in students’ ability to answer concept questions, while qualitative methods were used to evaluate students’ actions, thought processes, and comments from operating the device in both modes. The quantitative data was gathered over the course of several weeks by administering a pre-test to all students, working with students one-on-one using one version of the <b>cognitive</b> <b>device,</b> administering a mid-test, working with students one-on-one using the other version of the <b>cognitive</b> <b>device,</b> and then administering a post-test. The test design was counter-balanced by researching two lab sections; students in Lab Section AA used the simulation-only mode first and later used the simulation combined with haptic feedback mode. Students in Lab Section AB used the simulation with haptic feedback mode first and then later used the simulation-only mode. Video was recorded during the training interventions and the students completed surveys after each training intervention. ^ A two-way mixed ANOVA of the pre-test, mid-test and post-test scores revealed that there was a statistically significant improvement between pre-test and mid-test scores for both <b>cognitive</b> <b>device</b> input modes. The mixed ANOVA also showed that the mid-test to post-test score increases were not statistically significant and that interaction effects were not statistically significant. Although these results implied that the haptic feedback version of the <b>cognitive</b> <b>device</b> offered no advantages over the simulation-only version, qualitative analysis of the video revealed several design aspects that could be improved to reduce the extraneous cognitive load associated with the use of the instrumented foam beam. Qualitative analysis of the video and student comments also revealed unexpected student usage modes and a wide range of student abilities and interests. ...|$|E

30|$|A second context {{where the}} {{cognitive}} receiver has {{to detect the}} activity of compatible surrounding wireless networks, is when applying the concept of always best connected (ABS) [7]. The concept of ABS allows multi-mode cognitive devices to move between different technologies in order to approach the QoS requirement. Seamless cognitive immigration from one technology to another one is known as vertical handover [8, 9]. Before triggering a vertical handover, an opportunistic <b>cognitive</b> <b>device</b> has no knowledge about the active surrounding networks and must identify them. In a static spectrum allocation, the devices can easily detect the activities in their allocated spectrum bands using some existing technique such as energy detection [10], matched filters [11], etc. Unfortunately in cognitive networks, the allocated spectrum to the base stations (BSs) changes dynamically over time and space. Under those conditions a CR device must be enabled to identify passively the active compatible systems which are accessible in a given set of frequency bands. The spectrum is divided into {{a finite number of}} sub-bands. The goal is to develop efficient algorithms for such a task in each sub-band. An intuitive approach is to perform detection using the cross-correlation between the observed signal and the known preamble sequence of the network of interest. Unfortunately, this approach involves long delays, for example, in the IEEE 802.22, the super-frame preamble is broad-casted only once every 160 ms [12]. Since, the <b>cognitive</b> <b>device</b> must sense multiple sub-bands, such a delay is not tolerable and makes this approach too expensive. In addition, this approach does not make use of extra knowledge about the structure of the signals in different networks (e.g., the involved pilot signals). In this article, we propose an alternative solution which exploits the known pilot patterns of the involved standards.|$|E

In experiment 1, student participants drove a train simulator with one of four levels of automation: manual (nil), in-cab signalling (low), ATP (medium), and an autopilot (high). Results revealed that driver vigilance was negatively impacted by train automation, but only {{at a high level}} (i. e., an autopilot). This finding was interpreted as relating to driver mental workload. That is, a high LOA may have resulted in drivers being mentally underloaded. This interpretation required empirical validation in the following two experiments. In experiment 2, the task demands of participants in two high LOA groups (suspected of being mentally underloaded) were increased to one of two levels by means of a secondary task. Participants in two low LOA groups had the same treatments, and served as comparison groups. The secondary task was either a sensory vigilance device (low additional task demands) or a <b>cognitive</b> vigilance <b>device</b> (high additional task demands). Results revealed that autopilot supervisor (high LOA) participants were indeed underloaded, even with the sensory vigilance device secondary task. However, autopilot supervisor participants with the <b>cognitive</b> vigilance <b>device</b> secondary task were not underloaded. On the other hand, the in-cab signalling (low LOA) group of participants appeared to be overloaded when concurrently operating the <b>cognitive</b> vigilance <b>device,</b> but not when operating the sensory vigilance device.

30|$|The {{proliferation}} of electronic devices equipped with Wi-Fi transceivers has favored the rapid deployment of large-scale wireless mesh networks (WMNs) based on Wi-Fi backbone in several highly dense urban {{areas of the}} world [1, 2], which is considered a cheaper alternative to the traditional cabling solutions for the Internet access and Internet of thing (IoT). However, the performance of WMNs is still not competitive since the mesh nodes in highly dense urban environments must share the 2.4 -GHz industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) channels with several external devices, primary nodes (PNs), that cannot be governed by the mesh nodes and possibly interfere with the WMNs transmissions. Cognitive radio (CR) researches have mainly investigated the potential of reconfigurable radio technology for enabling an opportunistic spectrum access paradigm [3, 4], in which a <b>cognitive</b> <b>device</b> exploits the portions of the spectrum left vacant and less interfered multi-hop routes by the licensed users.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that the {{proliferation}} of wireless applications and services, experienced in the last decade, is leading to the challenging spectrum shortage problem. We provide a general overview regarding the spectrum shortage problem from the point of view of different technologies. First, we propose solutions based on multi-radio multi-channel wireless mesh networks in order to improve the usage of unlicensed wireless resources. Then, we move our focus on cognitive networks in order to analyze issues and solutions to opportunistically use licensed wireless resources. In wireless mesh networks, the spectrum shortage problem is addressed equipping each device with multiple radios which are turned on different orthogonal channels. We propose G-PaMeLA, which splits in local sub-problems the joint channel assignment and routing problem in multi-radio multi-channel wireless mesh networks. Results demonstrate that G-PaMeLA significantly improves network performance, in terms of packet loss and throughput fairness compared to algorithms in the literature. Unfortunately, even if orthogonal channels are used, wireless mesh networks result in what is called spectrum overcrowding. In order to address the spectrum overcrowding problem, careful analysis on spectrum frequencies has been conducted. These studies identified the possibility of transmitting on licensed channels, which are surprisingly underutilized. With the aim of addressing the resources problem using licensed channels, cognitive access and mesh networks have been developed. In cognitive access networks, we identify as the major problem the self-coexistence, which is the ability to access channels on a non-interfering basis with respect to licensed and unlicensed wireless devices. We propose two game theoretic frameworks which differentiate in having non-cooperative (NoRa) and cooperative (HeCtor) <b>cognitive</b> <b>devices,</b> respectively. Results show that HeCtor achieves higher throughput than NoRa but at the cost of higher computational complexity, which leads to a smaller throughput in cases where rapid changes occur in channels' occupancy. In contrast, NoRa attains the same throughput independent of the variability in channels' occupancy, hence <b>cognitive</b> <b>devices</b> adapt faster to such changes. In cognitive mesh networks, we analyze the coordination problem among <b>cognitive</b> <b>devices</b> because it is the major concern in implementing mesh networks in environments which change in time and space. We propose Connor, a clustering algorithm to address the coordination problem, which establishes common local control channels. Connor, in contrast with existing algorithms in the literature, does not require synchronization among <b>cognitive</b> mesh <b>devices</b> and allows a fast re-clustering when changes occur in channel's occupancy by licensed users. Results show that Connor performs better than existing algorithms in term of number of channels used for control purposes and time to reach and stay on stable configurations...|$|R
