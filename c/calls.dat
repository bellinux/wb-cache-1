5|$|Wildebeest {{can also}} {{listen in on}} the alarm <b>calls</b> of other species, and by doing so can reduce their risk of predation. One study showed, along with other ungulates, wildebeests responded more {{strongly}} to the baboon alarm <b>calls</b> compared to the baboon contest <b>calls,</b> though both types of <b>calls</b> had similar patterns, amplitudes, and durations. The alarm <b>calls</b> were a response of the baboons to lions, and the contest <b>calls</b> were recorded when a dispute between two males occurred.|$|E
5|$|A {{study of}} short-finned pilot whales off the {{southwest}} coast of Tenerife in the Canary Islands {{has found the}} members of a pod maintained contact with each other through call repertoires unique to their pod. A later study found, when foraging at around 800 m deep, short-finned pilot whales make tonal <b>calls.</b> The number and length of the <b>calls</b> seem to decrease with depth despite being farther away from conspecifics at the surface. As such, the surrounding water pressure affects the energy of the <b>calls,</b> but it does not appear to affect the frequency levels.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} {{different}} <b>calls</b> have been recorded from captive birds, including harsh, harmonic, chatter and whistle vocalisations.

5|$|As {{the species}} has no fixed nest sites that {{individuals}} {{can use to}} locate their own partner or chick, emperor penguins must rely on vocal <b>calls</b> alone for identification. They use {{a complex set of}} <b>calls</b> that are critical to individual recognition between parents, offspring, and mates, displaying the widest variation in individual <b>calls</b> of all penguins. Vocalizing emperor penguins use two frequency bands simultaneously. Chicks use a frequency-modulated whistle to beg for food and to contact parents.|$|E
5|$|Common ravens have a {{wide range}} of vocalizations which are of {{interest}} to ornithologists. Gwinner carried out important studies in the early 1960s, recording and photographing his findings in great detail. Fifteen to 30 categories of vocalization have been recorded for this species, most of which are used for social interaction. <b>Calls</b> recorded include alarm <b>calls,</b> chase <b>calls,</b> and flight <b>calls.</b> The species has a distinctive, deep, resonant prruk-prruk-prruk call, which to experienced listeners is unlike that of any other corvid. Its very wide and complex vocabulary includes a high, knocking toc-toc-toc, a dry, grating kraa, a low guttural rattle and some <b>calls</b> of an almost musical nature.|$|E

5|$|Compared {{to other}} mammals, {{primates}} {{in general are}} very vocal, and lemurs are no exception. Some lemur species have extensive vocal repertoires, including the ring-tailed lemur and ruffed lemurs. Some {{of the most common}} <b>calls</b> among lemurs are predator alarm <b>calls.</b> Lemurs not only respond to alarm <b>calls</b> of their own species, but also alarm <b>calls</b> of other species and those of non-predatory birds. The ring-tailed lemur and a few other species have different <b>calls</b> and reactions to specific types of predators. With mating <b>calls,</b> {{it has been shown that}} mouse lemurs that cannot be discerned visually respond more strongly to the <b>calls</b> of their own species, particularly when exposed to the <b>calls</b> of other mouse lemurs that they would encounter normally within their home range. Lemur <b>calls</b> can also be very loud and carry long distances. Ruffed lemurs use several loud <b>calls</b> that can be heard up to 1km (0.62mi) away on a clear, calm day. The loudest lemur is the indri, whose <b>calls</b> can be heard up to 2km (1.2mi) or more and thus communicate more effectively the territorial boundaries over its 34 to 40hectares (0.13 to 0.15sq mi) home range. Both ruffed lemurs and the indri exhibit contagious calling, where one individual or group starts a loud call and others within the area join in. The song of the indri can last 45seconds to more than 3minutes and tends to coordinate to form a stable duet comparable to that of gibbons.|$|E
5|$|Like New World monkeys, strepsirrhines rely on scent marking {{for much}} of their communication. This {{involves}} smearing secretions from epidermal scent glands on tree branches, along with urine and feces. In some cases, strepsirrhines may anoint themselves with urine (urine washing). Body postures and gestures may be used, although the long snout, non-mobile lips, and reduced facial enervation restrict the use of facial expressions in strepsirrhines. Short-range <b>calls,</b> long-range <b>calls,</b> and alarm <b>calls</b> are also used. Nocturnal species are more constrained {{by the lack of}} light, so their communication systems differ from those of diurnal species, often using long-range <b>calls</b> to claim their territory.|$|E

5|$|Little brown bats produce <b>calls</b> {{that are}} high {{intensity}} frequency modulated (FM) and that last {{from less than}} one millisecond (ms) to about 5 ms and have a sweep rate of 80–40kHz, with most of their energy at 45kHz.

5|$|Nuthatches {{are very}} vocal, using an {{assortment}} of whistles, trills and <b>calls.</b> Their breeding songs tend to be simple and often identical to their contact <b>calls</b> but longer in duration.

5|$|One of {{the first}} birds heard in the morning, the yellow-faced honeyeater utters <b>calls</b> that are full and loud, and {{extremely}} varied. The male sings from a roost for up to an hour, beginning twenty or thirty minutes before dawn. The song is a running series of cheerful notes sounding like chick-up, chick-up, from which its common name of quitchup is derived. Counter-singing (repeating the first bird's song) by neighbouring birds is common. The territorial call, also given by opponents during fights, is a long preet with an upward inflection. The alarm call is a loud trilling whistle. Common <b>calls,</b> thought to be contact <b>calls,</b> are animated two-note <b>calls</b> variously described as terric, terric, cr-rook, cr-rook or put-put, put-put.|$|E

40|$|Amount of <b>calling</b> {{activity}} (<b>calling</b> effort) is {{a strong}} determinant of male mating success in species such as orthopterans and anurans that use acoustic communication {{in the context of}} mating behaviour. While many studies in crickets have investigated the determinants of <b>calling</b> effort, patterns of variability in male <b>calling</b> effort in natural choruses remain largely unexplored. Within-individual variability in <b>calling</b> activity across multiple nights of <b>calling</b> can influence female mate search and mate choice strategies. Moreover, <b>calling</b> site fidelity across multiple nights of <b>calling</b> can also affect the female mate sampling strategy. We therefore investigated the spatio-temporal dynamics of acoustic signaling behaviour in a wild population of the field cricket species Plebeiogryllus guttiventris. We first studied the consistency of <b>calling</b> activity by quantifying variation in male <b>calling</b> effort across multiple nights of <b>calling</b> using repeatability analysis. Callers were inconsistent in their <b>calling</b> effort across nights and did not optimize nightly <b>calling</b> effort to increase their total number of nights spent <b>calling.</b> We also estimated <b>calling</b> site fidelity of males across multiple nights by quantifying movement of callers. Callers frequently changed their <b>calling</b> sites across <b>calling</b> nights with substantial displacement but without any significant directionality. Finally, we investigated trade-offs between within-night <b>calling</b> effort and energetically expensive <b>calling</b> song features such as <b>call</b> intensity and chirp rate. Calling effort was not correlated with any of the <b>calling</b> song features, suggesting that energetically expensive song features do not constrain male <b>calling</b> effort. The two key features of signaling behaviour, <b>calling</b> effort and <b>call</b> intensity, which determine the duration and spatial coverage of the sexual signal, are therefore uncorrelated and function independently...|$|R
