25|$|Work on {{the final}} {{extension}} northwards began in September 1912, but the tunnel was not finished {{at the beginning of}} the First World War. Though lacking personnel, the construction work continued at a slower pace. On 23 August 1916, in the middle of the war, the line reached Porte de la Chapelle. This extension comprised three new stations, of which the final included three tracks and two central platforms, the <b>central</b> <b>track</b> being used by trains leaving or arriving. Line A intersected with Line 4 at Marcadet – Poissonniers, but no transfer had yet been set up.|$|E
25|$|Dallas has a rich musical heritage. The {{number of}} {{prolific}} musicians {{who played in}} the Deep Ellum <b>Central</b> <b>Track</b> area was rivaled in the South only by Memphis' Beale Street. T-Bone Walker, Lead Belly, Blind Lemon Jefferson, Blind Willie Johnson, and even Robert Johnson himself first recorded in this area, just as Bob Wills and the Light Crust Doughboys were leaving the studio. In the 1960s, Dallas produced notable entertainers Trini Lopez and Stevie Ray Vaughan. Other notable musicians from Dallas include Erykah Badu, Gibby Haynes of the Butthole Surfers, Mike Nesmith of The Monkees, The Polyphonic Spree, Old 97's, St. Vincent, Edie Brickell & the New Bohemians, LehtMoJoe, Meat Loaf, Norah Jones, Willie Hutch, Baboon, The Secret Machines, Dorrough, The Paper Chase, Devourment, Absu, Course of Empire, Coilback, MC 900 Ft. Jesus, Reverend Horton Heat and Pantera.|$|E

500|$|The {{album was}} well {{received}} by music critics in Japan. Yuya Shimizu of Rolling Stone Japan gave the album {{four out of}} five stars, praising how the album blended DFA Records-style dance rock and minimal techno with their Japanese pop sensibilities, and also noting Yamaguchi's oddness and lyrical sense. Kenta Eizumi of Vibe felt that Sakanaction expressed a strong sense of crisis happening in the contemporary Japanese music business on the album. By creating an album themed around documentaries, and giving the listener a chance to understand the entire creation process, Eizumi felt that Documentaly expressed the preciousness of music more so than other musical works. Looking at the album's <b>central</b> <b>track</b> [...] "Endless", Shimizu felt that the song was an ambitious [...] "compilation-like work", likening it to electronic musician Rei Harakami. CDJournal reviewers praised the [...] "calm piano intro" [...] that transitioned from the album's previous song [...] "Ryūsen", and how the song progressed into [...] "a Sakanaction-like electro and rock fusion sound". They praised Yamaguchi's lyrics, feeling they were [...] "symbolic" [...] and [...] "like two recursive mirrors".|$|E

40|$|The <b>Central</b> <b>Tracking</b> Group {{addressed}} {{the issues involved}} in building a realistic central iracking system for a generalouroose 4 ~ detector for the SSC. We assumed that such a ceniral tracking system must be capable of running at the full design luminosity of 1 O 33 cm-%-l. We also assumed that momentum measurement was required in a general-purpose 47 r detector. Limitations on charged particle tracking detectors at the SSC imposed by rates and radiation damage are reviewed. Cell occupancy is the dominant constraint, which led us to the cbnelusion that only small cells, either wires or straw tubes, are suitable for a <b>central</b> <b>tracking</b> system at the SSC. Mechanical problems involved in building a <b>central</b> <b>tracking</b> system of either wires or straw tubes were studied, and our conclusion was {{that it is possible}} to build such a large central trackin...|$|R
60|$|She soon {{finished}} her shopping, and then, crossing {{over into the}} old town, pursued her way along the coast-road to Portland. At {{the end of an}} hour she had been rowed across the Fleet (which then lacked the convenience of a bridge), and reached the base of Portland Hill. The steep incline before her was dotted with houses, showing the pleasant peculiarity of one man's doorstep being behind his neighbour's chimney, and slabs of stone as the common material for walls, roof, floor, pig- sty, stable-manger, door-scraper, and garden-stile. Anne gained the summit, and followed along the <b>central</b> <b>track</b> over the huge lump of freestone which forms the peninsula, the wide sea prospect extending as she went on.
