40|$|I. r. {{spectroscopy}} {{has been}} applied to the study of hydrogen-bonding of the unique ester carbonyl group of acylchymotrypsins in the oxyanion hole of the enzyme. This <b>catalytic</b> <b>device</b> provides electrophilic stabilization of negative charge in the transition states and tetrahedral intermediates along the reaction pathway. The use of 13 C isotope substitution of the ester carbonyl group reinforces the previous observation [White & Wharton (1990) Biochem. J. 270, 627 - 637] that the ester carbonyl group is significantly polarized in the ground state by hydrogen bonding in the oxyanion hole. I. r. difference spectra of [carbonyl- 12 C]-minus [carbonyl- 13 C]-cinnamoyl-chymotrypsin as well as each of these acylenzymes minus free enzyme are reported. These spectra show that the contribution of protein perturbation (i. e. spectral features that arise from the enzyme which is distorted on acylation) in [carbonyl- 12 C]cinnamoyl-chymotrypsin minus free enzyme spectra is significant. The contribution of the perturbation components of the spectra is pH-dependent and can represent up to 50 % of the total absorbance in the spectral region from 1690 to 1740 cm- 1. Use of the isotopic difference method has allowed problems associated with protein perturbation to be eliminated. Similar difference spectra are presented for dihydrocinnamoyl-chymotrypsin. In this case the effect of perturbation is very marked and leads to the cancellation of the band assigned to the non-bonded conformation of the acyl group which has previously only been observed at higher pH. The isotopic difference method again proves reliable and shows that the frequency difference previously used to calculate the ground-state electronic strain induced by the oxyanion-hole <b>catalytic</b> <b>device</b> is not affected by the perturbation, although the amplitudes of the spectral features are different. A study of the deacylation of cinnamoyl-chymotrypsin in water and deuterium oxide using both u. v. and i. r. spectroscopies has confirmed that the use of deuterium oxide as solvent has no serious effect on the deacylation behaviour of the enzyme.

This freeway cuts through the inner city and had many buildings and neighbourhoods demolished for it to be realised. Since then it has caused more harm than good by only serving a select few while degrading inner city public space for others. This project investigates the possibility of the demolition of the Settlers Way freeway as it is essential for the appropriate future growth of Port Elizabeth's City centre. This will also have a large positive impact on the metro area in terms of spatial and economic benefit. The city centre is centrally located in the region and has a major spatial advantage in terms of trade and commerce. This alone should be enough reason for concern when it comes to social and economic reasons.

However, helices with micron and submicron dimensions are difficult to engineer using conventional processing techniques where patterning is accomplished litho- graphically. In this paper, we report the fabrication of porous gold, nickel, and polystyrene thin films with helical pore architectures. All films were made using a replication process, in which a thin film comprised of independent helical microstructures acted as the template. Filling of the template with metals was achieved by electroplating through the microstructures, whereas filling with polystyrene was achieved by capillary action. Porous films were produced from these composites by wet etch removal of the template material. Typical helical pores were {{on the order of}} 100 nm in diameter and extended through a film 1 µm to 2 µm thick. These films were generally more robust than the films from which they were templated, since they consisted of a solid network with helical pores rather than individual structures.

40|$|Globally ordered {{colloidal}} crystal lattices have broad {{utility in}} a wide range of optical and <b>catalytic</b> <b>devices,</b> for example, as photonic bandgap materials. However, the self-assembly of stereospecific structures is often confounded by polymorphism. Small free energy differences often characterize ensembles of different structures, making it difficult to produce a single morphology at will. Current techniques to handle this problem adopt one of two approaches: that of the “top-down,” or “bottom-up” methodology, whereby structures are engineered starting from the largest or smallest relevant length scales, respectively. However, recently a third approach for directing high fidelity assembly of colloidal crystals has been suggested which relies on the introduction of polymer co-solutes into the crystal phase. By tuning the polymer’s morphology to interact uniquely with the void symmetry of a single desired crystal, the entropy loss associated with polymer confinement has been shown to strongly bias the formation of that phase. However, previously this approach has only been demonstrated in the limiting case of close-packed crystals. Here we show how this approach may be generalized and extended to complex open crystals, illustrating the utility of this “structure-directing agent” paradigm in engineering the nanoscale structure of ordered colloidal materials. The high degree of transferability of this paradigm’s basic principles between relatively simple crystals and more complex ones suggests this represents a valuable addition to presently known selfassembly techniques and opens new avenues to better engineer the structure of these materials...|$|R
