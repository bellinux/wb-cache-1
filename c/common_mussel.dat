50|$|The common starfish {{feeds on}} a variety of benthic organisms. These include bivalve molluscs, polychaete worms, barnacles, {{gastropod}} molluscs, other echinoderms and carrion. When feeding on a mollusc such as a mussel, it attaches its tube feet to each shell valve and exerts force to separate them slightly. Even a gap of only 1 mm is sufficient for the starfish to insert a fold of its stomach, secrete enzymes and start digesting the mollusc body. When the contents is sufficiently liquid, it brings its stomach back to its rightful position with the food inside. The common starfish has a well-developed sense of smell and can detect the odour of prey species such as the <b>common</b> <b>mussel</b> (Mytilus edulis) and crawl towards it.

The results reflect that TBT is still used as a biocide in antifouling paints whereas the use of TPT as a co-toxicant in such preparations had been ceased in the 1980 s.

40|$|Whilst sub-seabed Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) has the {{potential}} to remove a significant proportion of anthropogenic CO 2 emissions at source, research is necessary to constrain the environmental impacts of potential future gas leaks from storage reservoirs. The QICS project (Quantifying and Monitoring Potential Ecosystem Impacts of Geological Carbons Storage) was established to improve our understanding of these potential impacts and to develop tools and best practice for monitoring sub-seabed CCS reservoirs. Exposure to increased environmental CO 2 has been shown to raise the tissue pCO 2 of many marine invertebrate species, leading to tissue acidosis and perturbations in both ion transport and bicarbonate buffering. These disturbances can cause downstream effects, seen as metabolic depression in susceptible organisms, compromising the role of particular species within an ecosystem and even causing the local extinction of species groups. To monitor {{the potential}} impact to surficial benthic megafauna, cages of bivalves (the <b>common</b> <b>mussel</b> Mytilus edulis Linnaeus, 1758 and the king scallop Pecten maximus (Linnaeus, 1758)) were deployed at the gas release site and at a reference site—both within Ardmucknish Bay, Oban, Scotland. Replicate individuals were sampled at six time points over a 125 -day period, which spanned both the 37 -day injection and recovery phases of the experiment, in order to establish impacts to molecular physiology. Samples of bivalves were also simultaneously sampled from a reference site within the bay in order to contrast changes in physiology induced by the gas release with naturally variability in the physiological performance of both species. We present data on changes in the transcription of genes coding for key ionic and carbon dioxide regulatory proteins. There was no evidence of gene regulation of either selected carbonic anhydrases (CAx genes) or the alpha subunit of sodium potassium ATPAses (ATP 1 A genes) in individual bivalves collected from the CO 2 gas release site, in either species. In the <b>common</b> <b>mussel</b> M. edulis there was only evidence for changes with time in the expression of genes coding for different classes of carbonic anhydrase. It was therefore concluded that the effects of the plume of elevated pCO 2 on ion-regulatory gene transcription were negligible in both species. Whilst the analysed data from this current study do not constitute an impediment to the continued development of sub-seabed CCS as a climate mitigation strategy, further modelling is necessary to predict the consequences of larger or longer term leaks. Further analysis is also required in order to constrain the potential physiological impacts of gas leaks to benthic infaunal species and understand the mechanism of possible avoidance behaviour recorded in burrowing heart urchins Echinocardium cordatum (Pennant, 1777) ...|$|E

Between those sites, the highest 210 Po concentrations {{have been found in}} whole scallop soft parts from La Rochelle, reaching 1181 ± 29 Bq kg− 1 dry weight (dwt), a size effect being related to the highest 210 Po concentration in the smallest scallops.

Very high 210 Po concentrations have been found in the digestive gland of C. varia, ranging 3150 – 4637 Bq kg− 1 dwt. Thus, the digestive gland contains up to 60 % of the radionuclide. Subcellular investigations have shown that approximately 40 % of the 210 Po contained in the digestive gland is in the cytosolic fraction, suggesting a high bioavailability of the 210 Po from this fraction to the trophic upper level.

The hydroacoustic measurements comprise preprocessed echo sounder recordings and side-scan sonar data forming a large and unique collection of datasets based on 4 field campaigns in resund and the Mediterranean. A combination of geostatistical methods for spatial interpolation of the echo sounder observations and a set of classification rules, based on discriminant analysis of the feature space of the observations, is found to yield reliable distribution maps when compared to groundtruth data. The data-driven methodology developed is shown to be adaptive to instationarities in the echo sounder observations and is recommended as a substantial improvement of existing methods of sea floor mapping based on echo sounder data. Elaborations of the developed methodology are studied, comprising the use of geostatistical simulation, Markov random fields and Boolean models. Geostatistical simulation provides a means of assessing the variability of random field functionals such as the estimated distribution area of a benthic species. The Markov random field allows the spatial distribution of the benthic communities to be modelled as a less smooth or regular phenomena than assumed when using geostatistical models.

The results from both depuration systems suggest that E. coli is an inappropriate indicator of the efficiency of virus elimination during depuration. The coliphage used appears to be a more representative indicator. Depuration under stressful conditions appeared to have a negligible affect on poliovirus and coliphage elimination rates from mussels. However, the rate and pattern of E. coli elimination were dramatically affected by these conditions.

Similar to all bivalves analyzed to date, the [Ba/Ca]shell profiles are characterized by a relatively flat background [Ba/Ca]shell, interrupted by sharp [Ba/Ca]shell peaks. Previous studies have focused on these [Ba/Ca]shell peaks, but not on the background [Ba/Ca]shell. We show that in both laboratory and field experiments, there is a direct relationship between the background [Ba/Ca]shell and [Ba/Ca]water in M. edulis shells. The laboratory and field data provided background Ba/Ca partition coefficients (DBa) of 0. 10 ± 0. 02 and 0. 071 ± 0. 001, respectively. This range is slightly higher than the DBa previously determined for inorganic calcite, and slightly lower than foraminiferal calcite. These data suggest that M. edulis shells can be used as an indicator of [Ba/Ca]water, and therefore, fossil or archaeological M. edulis shells could be used to extend knowledge of estuarine dissolved Ba throughputs back in time. Moreover, considering the inverse relationship between [Ba/Ca]water and salinity, background [Ba/Ca]shell data could be used as an estuary specific indicator of salinity. The cause of the [Ba/Ca]shell peaks are more confusing, both the laboratory and field experiments indicate that they cannot be used as a direct proxy of [Ba/Ca]water or phytoplankton production, but may possibly be caused by barite ingestion...|$|E

NP was detected in all zebra mussels from the river Elbe (up to 41 ng/g), whereas in rather few samples OP and NP 1 EO were found at low levels. OP 1 EO was not detected in any sample. Concentrations in mussels and breams from the reference site Lake Belau were below the LOQ for all compounds. In marine biota NP was found until 1997 with maximum concentrations up to 9. 7 ng/g, whereas NP 1 EO was detected at levels between 1. 7 and 12. 9 ng/g in very few samples collected at the end of the 1980 s. A tendency of the concentrations to decrease was obvious for all sampling sites; it was most pronounced for NP 1 EO and NP after 1996 / 1997. The effectiveness of the reduction measures is most evident at the Saar sampling site Güdingen and the North Sea sampling site Eckwarderhörne...|$|R
