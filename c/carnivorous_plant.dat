5|$|A protocarnivorous plant (sometimes also paracarnivorous, subcarnivorous, or {{borderline}} carnivore), {{according to}} some definitions, traps and kills insects or other animals but lacks the ability to either directly digest or absorb nutrients from its prey like a <b>carnivorous</b> <b>plant.</b> The morphological adaptations such as sticky trichomes or pitfall traps of protocarnivorous plants parallel the trap structures of confirmed carnivorous plants.|$|E

25|$|<b>Carnivorous</b> <b>Plants</b> of Australia is a three-volume work on <b>carnivorous</b> <b>plants</b> by Allen Lowrie. The three tomes were {{published}} in 1987, 1989, and 1998, by University of Western Australia Press.|$|R
5|$|The {{demarcation}} between carnivorous and protocarnivorous is blurred by {{the lack}} of a strict definition of botanical carnivory and ambiguous academic literature on the subject. Many examples of protocarnivorous plants exist, some of which are counted among the ranks of true carnivorous plants as a matter of historical preference. Further research into these plants' carnivorous adaptations may reveal that a few protocarnivorous plants do meet the more rigid definition of a <b>carnivorous</b> <b>plant.</b>|$|E
5|$|Drosera anglica, {{commonly}} known as the English sundew or great sundew, is a <b>carnivorous</b> <b>plant</b> species belonging to the sundew family Droseraceae. It is a temperate species with a generally circumboreal range, although it does occur as far south as Japan, southern Europe, and the island of Kauai in Hawaii, where it grows as a subtropical sundew. It is thought to originate from an amphidiploid hybrid of D. rotundifolia and D. linearis, meaning that a sterile hybrid between these two species doubled its chromosomes to produce fertile progeny which stabilized into the current D. anglica.|$|E
5|$|Nepenthes rajah is a <b>carnivorous</b> <b>plant</b> of the pitfall trap variety. It {{is famous}} for {{occasionally}} trapping vertebrates, even small mammals. There exist at least two records of drowned rats found in N. rajah pitchers. The first observation dates from 1862 and was made by Spenser St. John, who accompanied Hugh Low on two ascents of Mount Kinabalu. In 1988, Anthea Phillipps and Anthony Lamb confirmed the plausibility of this record when they managed to observe drowned rats in a large pitcher of N. rajah. In 2011, {{the discovery of a}} drowned mountain treeshrew (Tupaia montana) in a N.rajah pitcher was reported.|$|E

25|$|<b>Carnivorous</b> <b>plants</b> are {{plants that}} derive some {{or most of}} their {{nutrients}} (but not energy) from trapping and consuming animals or protozoans, typically insects and other arthropods. <b>Carnivorous</b> <b>plants</b> have adapted to grow in places where the soil is thin or poor in nutrients, especially nitrogen, such as acidic bogs and rock outcroppings. Charles Darwin wrote Insectivorous Plants, the first well-known treatise on <b>carnivorous</b> <b>plants,</b> in 1875.|$|R
25|$|In horticulture, <b>carnivorous</b> <b>plants</b> are {{considered}} a curiosity or a rarity, but are becoming more common in cultivation {{with the advent of}} mass-production tissue-culture propagation techniques. Venus flytraps are still the most commonly grown, usually available at garden centers and hardware stores, sometimes offered alongside other easy to grow varieties. Nurseries that specialize in growing <b>carnivorous</b> <b>plants</b> exclusively also exist, more uncommon or demanding varieties of <b>carnivorous</b> <b>plants</b> can be obtained from specialist nurseries. California Carnivores is a notable example of such a nursery that specializes in the cultivation of <b>carnivorous</b> <b>plants.</b> It is owned and operated by horticulturalist Peter D'Amato.|$|R
5|$|The tentacle-covered leaves {{can capture}} large prey, such as beetles, moths, and butterflies. The tentacles of all Drosera species have {{specialised}} stalked glands on the leaf's upper surface that produce a sticky mucilage. The leaves are considered active flypaper traps that respond to captured prey by bending to surround it. In its native fynbos habitat, the plants compete for space with native marsh grasses and low evergreen shrubs. Of the two known populations of D.regia, the higher altitude site {{appears to be}} overgrown and is essentially extirpated. The lower altitude site is estimated to have about 50 mature plants, making it the most endangered Drosera species, since it is threatened with extinction in the wild. It is often cultivated by <b>carnivorous</b> <b>plant</b> enthusiasts, and a single cultivar has been registered.|$|E

40|$|After {{more than}} a century of being {{regarded}} as botanical oddities, <b>carnivorous</b> <b>plants</b> have emerged as model systems that are appropriate for addressing a wide array of ecological and evolutionary questions. Now that reliable molecular phylogenies are available for many <b>carnivorous</b> <b>plants,</b> they can be used to study convergences and divergences in ecophysiology and life-history strategies. Cost–benefit models and demographic analysis can provide insight into the selective forces promoting carnivory. Important areas for future research include the assessment of the interaction between nutrient availability and drought tolerance among <b>carnivorous</b> <b>plants,</b> as well as measurements of spatial and temporal variability in microhabitat characteristics that might constrain plant growth and fitness. In addition to addressing evolutionary convergence, such studies must take into account the evolutionary diversity of <b>carnivorous</b> <b>plants</b> and their wide variety of life forms and habitats. Finally, <b>carnivorous</b> <b>plants</b> have suffered from historical overcollection, and their habitats are vanishing rapidly. A major focus of future research on this exciting group of plants should be directed towards strategies for their conservation and management...|$|R
