40|$|Handling {{exceptions}} in a {{knowledge-based system}} has been considered as an important issue in many domains of applications, such as medical domain. In this pa-per, we propose several preferential semantics for plau-sible subsumption to deal with exceptions in description logic-based knowledge bases. Our preferential seman-tics are defined {{in the framework of}} possibility theory, which is an uncertainty theory devoted to the handling of incomplete information. We consider the properties of these semantics and their relationships. Entailment of these plausible subsumption relative to a knowledge base is also considered. We show the close relation-ship between two of our semantics and the mutually dual preferential semantics given by Britz, Heidema and Meyer. Finally, we show that our semantics for plausi-ble subsumption can be reduced to standard semantics of an expressive description logic. Thus, the problem of plausible subsumption <b>checking</b> <b>under</b> our semantics can be reduced to the problem of subsumption <b>checking</b> <b>under</b> the classical semantics...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we exploit Answer Set Programming (ASP) for {{reasoning}} in a rational extension SROEL-R-T {{of the low}} complexity description logic SROEL, which underlies the OWL EL ontology language. In the extended language, a typicality operator T is allowed to define concepts T(C) (typical C's) under a rational semantics. It has been proven that instance <b>checking</b> <b>under</b> rational entailment has a polynomial complexity. To strengthen rational entailment, {{in this paper we}} consider a minimal model semantics. We show that, for arbitrary SROEL-R-T knowledge bases, instance <b>checking</b> <b>under</b> minimal entailment is Π^P_ 2 -complete. Relying on a Small Model result, where models correspond to answer sets of a suitable ASP encoding, we exploit Answer Set Preferences (and, in particular, the asprin framework) for reasoning under minimal entailment.
