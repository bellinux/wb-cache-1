50|$|The Black Book of Communism {{asserts that}} roughly 94 million died under all <b>communist</b> <b>regimes</b> while Rummel {{believes}} around 144.7 million died under six <b>communist</b> <b>regimes.</b> Benjamin Valentino claims that between 21 and 70 million deaths {{are attributable to}} the <b>Communist</b> <b>regimes</b> in the USSR, the People's Republic of China and Democratic Kampuchea alone.|$|R
50|$|Second, {{different}} researchers {{work with}} different definitions {{of what it}} means to be killed by a regime. As noted above, the vast majority of victims of <b>communist</b> <b>regimes</b> did not die as a result of direct government orders, but as an indirect result of state policy. There is no agreement on the question of whether <b>communist</b> <b>regimes</b> should be held responsible for their deaths and if so, to what degree. The low estimates may count only executions and labor camp deaths as instances of killings by <b>communist</b> <b>regimes,</b> while the high estimates may be based on the argument that <b>communist</b> <b>regimes</b> were responsible for all deaths resulting from famine or war.|$|R

5|$|In {{testimony}} to the Joint Congressional Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, Kahn suggested policies to support the Polish people, in particular by supporting Solidarity's demand that the <b>Communist</b> <b>regime</b> finally establish legality, by respecting the twenty-one rights guaranteed by the Polish constitution.|$|E
5|$|Dubček lent {{his support}} to the Velvet Revolution of December 1989. After the {{collapse}} of the <b>Communist</b> <b>regime</b> that month, Dubček became chairman of the federal assembly under the Havel administration. He later led the Social Democratic Party of Slovakia, and spoke against the dissolution of Czechoslovakia prior to his death in November 1992.|$|E
5|$|The postwar <b>communist</b> <b>regime</b> {{developed}} {{the city as}} an industrial and commercial centre.

50|$|Since {{the fall}} of the Eastern European <b>communist</b> <b>regimes,</b> the Soviet Union, and a variety of African <b>communist</b> <b>regimes,</b> only a few Marxist-Leninist parties {{currently}} remain in power. This short list includes, but is not exactly limited to: China, Cuba, Laos, and Vietnam. Most communist parties outside of these nations have fared relatively poorly in elections. However, the Communist Party of the Russian Federation has remained a significant political force.|$|R
5|$|Under the <b>communist</b> <b>regime,</b> the Vlaici {{building}} {{was transformed into}} a branch for the state-owned producer of agricultural machinery, and, in 2004, belonged to its successor, Agromec (although still largely unused). Beldie recounts that, under communism, the destitute Domnica Bogdan worked as a hygienist at Bucharest Central Hospital.|$|E
5|$|After September 1939, desperate {{efforts were}} made to improve the situation, but with very little result. Germany, for obvious reasons, delayed its deliveries; France was {{hesitant}} to equip an army that would not unequivocally take its side. The one abundant source of readily available weaponry, the Soviet Union, was inaccessible because the Dutch, contrary to most other nations, did not recognise the <b>communist</b> <b>regime.</b> An attempt in 1940 to procure Soviet armour captured by Finland failed.|$|E
5|$|After the {{communist}} revolution in Afghanistan in 1978, authoritarian actions forced upon the populace by the <b>Communist</b> <b>regime</b> {{led to the}} Afghan civil war, with the mujahideen leading the popular backlash against the regime. The Soviet Union was worried that they were losing their influence in Central Asia, so after a KGB report claimed that Afghanistan could be taken {{in a matter of}} weeks, Brezhnev and several top party officials agreed to a full intervention in Afghanistan.|$|E

5|$|Agârbiceanu {{spent his}} last {{decade and a}} half under a <b>communist</b> <b>regime</b> that outlawed his church, an act in which he refused to cooperate. Much of his work, with its {{transparent}} Christian moralizing, proved incompatible with the new ideology, and was banned by communist censors; however, the regime found him useful for its image, and bestowed honors upon him. Agârbiceanu's full contribution has been made available since the 1990s, but he endures as a largely forgotten author, {{with the possible exception of}} his Apuseni-based novella, Fefeleaga.|$|E
5|$|An acute {{shortage}} of housing {{after the fall}} of the <b>Communist</b> <b>regime</b> in 1990 led some Albanians to set up home in abandoned bunkers, though the lack of running water and sanitation meant that the area around inhabited bunkers soon became contaminated and unhealthy. A few bunkers have found more creative uses. In the coastal city of Durrës one beachside bunker has been turned into the Restaurant Bunkeri, and another bunker in Gjirokastër was turned into a café.|$|E
5|$|King St Stephen {{has been}} a popular theme in Hungarian poetry {{since the end of}} the 13th century. The {{earliest}} poems were religious hymns which portrayed the holy king as the apostle of the Hungarians. Secular poetry, especially poems written for his feast day, followed a similar pattern, emphasizing Stephen's role as the first king of Hungary. Poets described Stephen as the symbol of national identity and independence and of the ability of the Hungarian nation to survive historical cataclysms during the <b>Communist</b> <b>regime</b> between 1949 and 1989.|$|E

Between 1948 and 1952, nearly {{one half of the}} {{surviving}} members of Jewish Community of Zagreb opted for emigration to Israel, and the community dropped to one-tenth of its pre-war membership. The Yugoslav <b>communist</b> <b>regime</b> nationalized virtually all real estate owned by the Jewish Community of Zagreb, including the plot in Praška Street. All this, combined with the new regime's general hostility toward religion, made reconstruction of the synagogue nearly impossible.|$|E
5|$|The Underground State's {{military}} arm, Armia Krajowa, officially disbanded on 19 January 1945 {{to avoid}} armed {{conflict with the}} Soviets and a civil war. Over {{the next few years}} the communists solidified their hold on Poland, falsifying elections, persecuting the opposition and eliminating it as a political power. Remnants of the armed resistance (NIE, Armed Forces Delegation for Poland, Freedom and Independence) that refused to lay down their weapons and surrender to the <b>communist</b> <b>regime</b> continued to hold out for several years as the cursed soldiers, fighting the Soviet-backed communist forces until eradicated.|$|E
5|$|The current Romanian {{reconnaissance}} battalions (the 313th, the 317th and the 528th) {{are also}} considered special forces units, and were {{formed in the}} 1960s during the <b>communist</b> <b>regime.</b> After the revolution, the units suffered {{from a lack of}} funds which resulted in the temporary disbandment of the 313th Battalion. However, their equipment was completely overhauled {{in the past few years}} and the combat readiness and capabilities have regained full strength.|$|E
40|$|<b>Communist</b> <b>regimes</b> {{have claimed}} that {{communism}} is the vehicle for women's emancipation. They maintain that sexual inequality can only be abolished {{as part of the}} broader socialist transformation through pulling women into the paid labour force. If the communist claim is true, women in <b>communist</b> <b>regimes</b> should be equal regardless of their cultural tradition, while women's position in <b>communist</b> <b>regimes</b> should be higher than in capitalist regimes. However, women's experiences in <b>communist</b> <b>regimes</b> revealed that their position varies from country to country and region to region, revealing the influence of culture in a variety of guises. In this respect, the former two Germanies and the two Koreas provide a rare chance of a cross-regime and cross-cultural comparative study. Germany and Korea have maintained distinct cultures different from their neighbours. The traditions of the two nations ran into revolutionary changes and discontinuities in the wake of their division into <b>communist</b> and capitalist <b>regimes.</b> The <b>communist</b> <b>regimes</b> of Germany and Korea advocated women's emancipation through making women part of the working class. Their achievements and failures compared with their severed national halves constituted a laboratory situation for the test of the communist claim. In this thesis, the communist claim is tested through the comparison of women's positions in the four countries, in all aspects of social life: under the law, in the education system, at work, in the family and in politics. The novel contribution of the thesis is its cross-cultural and cross-regime analysis, measuring the impact of the state on women's emancipation, taking into account different cultural impediments. It contributes to the development of feminist analyses of the state and culture, adding empirical evidence to theoretic arguments...|$|R

5|$|This {{restriction}} {{and kind}} of state monopoly {{on the use of}} national symbols during the <b>Communist</b> <b>regime</b> made flying the Polish flag a symbol of resistance against the government. It became customary – and still is – for workers to hoist Polish flags on plant buildings when going on strike. This is why the Polish flag, as a symbol of patriotism and resistance against the Communist rule, is part of the Solidarity trade union logo.|$|E
5|$|As {{the period}} of Sovietization and Stalinism began, the PZPR was {{anything}} but united. The most important split among the communists occurred before the union with PPS, when the Stalinists forced Gomułka out of the PPR's top office and suppressed his native communist faction. The PZPR had become divided into several factions, which espoused different views and methods and sought different degrees of the Polish state's distinction and independence from the Soviet Union. While the official ideology, the Russian version of Marxism, was new to Poland, the <b>communist</b> <b>regime</b> continued, in many psychologically and practically important ways, the precepts, methods and manners of past Polish ruling circles, {{including those of the}} Sanation, the National Democracy, and the 19th century traditions of cooperation with the partitioning powers.|$|E
5|$|At age fourteen, Pascu's voice changed. He {{was still}} a soprano in the choir, but had to use his head voice.

In 1976, he enrolled at the Agnita High School, which later became the Agro-Industrial High School. The same year, he gave up handball and began a more formal study of guitar music, using the Maria Boeru textbook as his guide. He debuted as an amateur actor in 1977, with a school theater performance at the Agnita House of Culture.|$|E
