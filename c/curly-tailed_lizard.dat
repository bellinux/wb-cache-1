50|$|The Navassa <b>curly-tailed</b> <b>lizard</b> (Leiocephalus eremitus) is an extinct lizard {{species from}} the family of curly-tailed lizards (Leiocephalidae).

50|$|Leiocephalus loxogrammus, {{commonly}} known as the San Salvador <b>Curly-tailed</b> <b>Lizard,</b> is a lizard species from the family of curly-tailed lizards (Leiocephalidae). It is endemic to the Bahama islands and is only known on San Salvador Island and Rum Cay.|$|E
50|$|The <b>curly-tailed</b> <b>lizard</b> is {{endemic to}} the Bahamas {{and has an}} {{extremely}} restricted range as it is only found on Great Inagua.

50|$|The Hispaniolan masked <b>curly-tailed</b> <b>lizard</b> (Leiocephalus personatus) is {{a lizard}} species {{from the family}} of curly-tailed lizards (Leiocephalidae). It {{is also known as}} the green-legged curly-tail and the jewelled curly-tail, due mainly to the bright {{metallic}} colouration of mature males. The species is sexually dimorphic with the males being considerably larger with impressive red markings on the head around the lower jaw. Females are much smaller and are brown in colour with lighter stripes running down the flanks.|$|E
50|$|There {{were eight}} species of native reptiles, {{all of which}} are {{believed}} to be, or to have been, endemic to Navassa Island: Celestus badius (an anguid lizard), Aristelliger cochranae (a gecko), Sphaerodactylus becki (a gecko), Anolis longiceps (an anole), Cyclura (cornuta) onchiopsis (a rock iguana), Leiocephalus eremitus (a <b>curly-tailed</b> <b>lizard),</b> Tropidophis bucculentus (a dwarf boa), and Typhlops sulcatus (a tiny snake). Of these the first four remain common with the last four likely extinct. Feral cats, dogs and pigs currently inhabit the island.|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} {{the distribution and}} ecology of the exotic northern <b>curly-tailed</b> <b>lizard</b> (Leiocephalus carinatus armouri) in Florida. Published literature and especially unpublished documents and data were reviewed and synthesized. Our findings suggest that both the range and distribution of the Florida population have expanded at a rapid rate during the last 60 years. Ecological effects or this species on Florida 2 ̆ 7 s native lizards and other fauna have not been quantified and require thorough evaluation...|$|E
40|$|Florida {{has one of}} the two worst {{non-indigenous}} {{invasive species}} problems in the United States, and all such species are considered by statute to be a potential ecological problem. Unfortunately, little information is available about most of Florida’s invasive species. Here, we provide information on range expansion of a population of one of the lesser-known species. The Palm Beach County, Florida, population of the northern <b>curly-tailed</b> <b>lizard,</b> Leiocephalus carinatus armouri, was examined for north–south expansion of its previously documented range. Observations were conducted as contiguous expansion outward from the previously known range. We found a substantial contiguous range expansion by a minimum of 46 : 3 km to the south and 34 : 1 km to the north. This species appears to be closely associated with coastal habitat degradation in the form of human infrastructure, especially ageing pavement, sea walls, buildings, and bridge bases...|$|E
40|$|The Palm Beach County {{introduction}} of the exotic northern <b>curly-tailed</b> <b>lizard</b> (Leiocephalus carinatus armouri) {{was reported to have}} occurred as a result of 20 pairs released in Palm Beach during the 1940 s, with an expanded range of approximately 20 city blocks by 1959 (see reviews in Duellman and Sehwartz 1958, King 1960. Weigl et. al. 1969). By 1968, this population had extended 3. 2 km north and 5. 6 km south (Weigl et al. 1969). By 1986, the species was common farther south at Woolbright Road and the Intracoastal Waterway in Boynton Beach (Smith and Engeman in press); and later was reported 16 May 1999 at the extreme southern end of Martin County (Hauge and Butterfield 20001, which sits an the northern border of Palm Beach County. A recent survey of this population conducted in September 2002 suggested a minimum north-south range expansion of at least 46. 3 km south, and 34. 1 km north, beyond the 1968 boundaries (Smith et al. in review) ...|$|E
40|$|Several {{aspects of}} escape {{behavior}} are predictable by escape theory based on expected costs due to predation risk and escaping. Although {{the function of}} pursuit-deterrent signaling is to dissuade predators from attack, relatively {{little is known about}} relationships between specific components of escape and the signaling behavior. I studied effects of the risk factor distance from refuge on flight initiation distance, distance fled, probability of entering refuge, and the distance between predator (an approaching human) and prey when pursuit-deterrent display begins (display distance) in the Cuban <b>curly-tailed</b> <b>lizard</b> (Leiocephalus carinatus). I also investigated whether starting distance (distance between predator and prey when approach begins) affects escape behaviors. As predicted by escape theory, flight initiation distance and distance fled were greater and refuge entry was less probable at greater distance from refuge, indicating that qualitative predictions of escape theory apply to pursuit deterrent signalers. Starting distance did not affect escape behaviors, presumably because it did not affect perceived risk, but might do so at a faster approach speed. Display distance and flight initiation distance were identical in the data set analyzed, but individuals sometimes perform tail displays prior to fleeing. Interspecific variation in the timing of pursuit-deterrent displays is discussed, as are possible reasons for observed differences in the effect of starting distance...|$|E
