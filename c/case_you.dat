By September 2015, with her 2016 presidential campaign underway and beset by continued reports regarding her private email usage at the State Department, her ratings had slumped to some of her lowest levels ever. During 2016 she acknowledged that: [...] "I'm not a natural politician, in <b>case</b> <b>you</b> haven't noticed." [...] In July 2017 Bloomberg showed her approval rating at 39 percent.|$|E

He successfully requisitioned the assistance of Pope Clement XI with Anna Maria Franziska. He sent the Archbishop of Prague to reproach her. She cited the example of Marguerite-Louise, adding that the Pope did not bother himself to machinate a reconciliation. Cosimo wrote desperate missives to the Electress Palatine: [...] "I can tell you now, in <b>case</b> <b>you</b> are not informed, {{that we have no}} money in Florence..."

He further {{pointed out that}} the song {{featured}} elements not approached by the singer in previous material. Alin from Urban.ro similarly thought that the recording was of a new style compared to Inna's previous work, noting Arabic influences, guitar accords and male vocals complementing the singer. Reagan Gavin Rasquinh of The Times of India wrote, [...] "despite the title, [...] {{has nothing to do with}} the subcontinent, in <b>case</b> <b>you</b> were wondering." [...] According to Urban.ro, [...] "Inndia" [...] refers to the name of a woman who is portrayed in the music video.|$|E

In a later interview, she questioned the seriousness of the actors auditioning for this type of show: [...] "you wouldn't put yourself up for one of those shows in <b>case</b> <b>you</b> got bumped off the first week and all your colleagues saw it". She has also expressed a wish for more new musicals to be put into production, instead of frequent revivals.|$|E

In a preview for the episode, Vicky Power of The Daily Telegraph said that [...] "as usual there's a large body count and fist-fights, but these are {{tempered}} by scenes of high emotion", and if the episode were Ros' last, [...] "it is a fitting send-off". David Chater of The Times was positive towards the episode, stating [...] "just in <b>case</b> <b>you</b> think you're having an exhausting time {{in the run-up to}} Christmas, spare a thought for Lucas North [...] his lover is a liar, a murderer and a traitor", and also noted that [...] "the great thing about Spooks is that they will always stop and explain how serious things are".|$|E

Levels were designed with this goal in mind, with just enough plot to give context to the player's actions. Liberties were thus taken with the plot, and critics noted there was little footage which could spoil the film for those who had not seen it. GameSpot's Greg Kasavin said [...] "if you didn't know anything about the story of The Return of the King, then the story of the game may be hard to follow, though you'll still get the gist of it." [...] However, he also advised, [...] "in <b>case</b> <b>you</b> don't want any aspect of the movie spoiled for you, it'd be wise to hold off on playing The Return of the King until after you've seen the movie." ...|$|E

500|$|Five years later, Darabont {{wrote the}} script over an eight-week period. He {{expanded}} on elements of King's story. Brooks, {{who in the}} novella is a minor character who dies in a retirement home, became a tragic character who eventually hanged himself. Tommy, who in the novella trades his evidence exonerating Andy for transfer to a nicer prison, in the screenplay is murdered on the orders of Warden Norton, who is a composite of several warden characters in King's story. Darabont opted to create a single warden character {{to serve as the}} primary antagonist. Among his inspirations, Darabont listed the works of director Frank Capra, including Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939) and It's a Wonderful Life (1946), describing them as tall tales; Darabont likened The Shawshank Redemption to a tall tale more than a prison movie. He also cited Goodfellas (1990) as an inspiration on the use of dialogue to illustrate the passage of time in the script. King never cashed the $5,000 cheque from Darabont for the rights to The Shawshank Redemption; [...] he later framed it and returned it to Darabont accompanied by a note which read: [...] "In <b>case</b> <b>you</b> ever need bail money. Love, Steve." ...|$|E

Her mother, who had moved to The Bronx, New York to attend Monroe College, brought the family to Queens, New York, when Minaj was 5. By then the family had a house on West 147th Street. Minaj recalled, [...] "I don't think I {{had a lot of}} discipline in my household. My mom motivated me, but it wasn't a strict household. I kind of wanted a strict household." [...] Minaj successfully auditioned for admission to LaGuardia High School in Manhattan, which focuses on visual and performing arts.

At the age of 19, as she struggled with her acting career, she worked as a waitress at Red Lobster in the Bronx, but was fired for discourtesy to customers. She said she was fired from [...] "at least fifteen jobs" [...] for similar reasons. She also worked as an administrative assistant, in customer service and as an office manager for a Wall Street business.|$|E
500|$|Murs' second studio album, the retro-pop themed In <b>Case</b> <b>You</b> Didn't Know, was {{released}} on 25 November 2011. The composition of [...] "Oh My Goodness" [...] is composed of an organ and horns, while the title track, [...] "Heart Skips a Beat" [...] and [...] "Tell the World" [...] draw influence from reggae. [...] "Dance with Me Tonight" [...] is a 1950s saxophone style record with elements of Doo-wop, while the track [...] "Just Smile" [...] {{is reminiscent of the}} work of Burt Bacharach. The disco-pop themed Right Place Right Time, Murs' third studio album, {{was released}} on 26 November 2012. Murs co-wrote the majority of the album with songwriters Steve Robson, Wayne Hector and Ed Drewett. [...] "Troublemaker" [...] was released as the lead single from the album, and it features Flo Rida. Lyrically, it documents Murs' obsession for a woman who he knows is not good for him but he cannot resist her, while Flo Rida delivers a rap verse explaining why he finds alluring women attractive. The BBC's critic John Aizlewood described album tracks [...] "Head to Toe" [...] as adult-themed and [...] "Dear Darlin as solemn in its composition.|$|E

500|$|From 1942 onwards, Hergé began {{redrawing}} and colouring {{his earlier}} Tintin adventures for Casterman, but {{chose not to}} do so for Tintin in the Land of the Soviets, considering its story too crude. Embarrassed by it, he labeled it a [...] "transgression of [...] youth". Jean-Marc and Randy Lofficier believed that another factor in his decision might have been the story's virulently anti-Marxist theme, which would have been unpopular amidst growing West European sympathies for Marxism following the Second World War. In an article discussing Hergé's work which was published in the magazine Jeune Afrique ("Young Africa") in 1962, it was noted that despite the fact that fans of his work visited the Bibliothèque Nationale to read the copy of Land of the Soviets that was held there, it [...] "will never (and with good cause) be republished". In 1961, Hergé wrote a letter to Casterman suggesting that the original version of the story be republished in a volume containing a publisher's warning about its content. Louis-Robert Casterman replied with a letter in which he stated that while the subject had been discussed within the company, [...] "There are more hesitant or decidedly negative opinions than there are enthusiastic ones. Whatever the <b>case,</b> <b>you</b> can rest assured that the matter is being actively considered".|$|E

Irresistible pop hooks glide across shimmering synth beats to make this a {{landmark}} album of the early 80's." [...] Jonathan Ross from Q said that [...] "'Borderline' is sweet and 'Holiday' still fizzes with invention and joie de vivre....this quintessentially '80s dance hit also features a barrelhouse piano solo." [...] Robert Christgau wrote in The Village Voice, [...] "In <b>case</b> <b>you</b> bought the con, disco never died — just reverted to the crazies who thought it was worth living for. This shamelessly ersatz blonde is one of them, and with the craftily orchestrated help of a fine selection of producers, remixers, and DJs, she's come up with a shamelessly ersatz sound that's tighter than her tummy — essence of electro, the D in DOR." [...] Don Shewey from Rolling Stone was of the opinion that [...] "without overstepping the modest ambitions of minimal funk, Madonna issues an irresistible invitation to the dance." [...] Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine rated the album four and a half out of five stars and commented: [...] "Heralding the synth-heavy movement was a debut album [...] that sounds just as fresh today as it did almost two decades ago." [...] In March 2012, the publication placed the album at number 33 on their [...] "Best Albums of the 1980s" [...] list. Michaelangelo Matos from Spin selected the album among [...] "The Definitive Guide to Classic Disco" [...] and noted that it [...] "mashed-up street sounds and reinvigorated disco for a generation that {{wanted nothing to do with}} polyester suits, ending an era and birthing a new one." ...|$|E
500|$|Among {{the cover}} {{artists in the}} first decade, sf {{historian}} and critic Thomas Clareson singles out the early astronomical scenes by Chesley Bonestell as being the most notable; these {{were among the first}} to replace George Salter's surreal artwork on the cover. [...] Kelly Freas and Ed Emshwiller, two of the most popular artists in the sf field, also contributed covers during the 1950s. [...] Mel Hunter began contributing covers with the November 1953 issue, and in October 1955 began a long-running series of covers that depicted a robot survivor of a nuclear holocaust engaging in human activities amidst the desolation—watering a flower, playing with toys, or reading a store catalog, for example. [...] A regular book review column appeared, titled [...] "Recommended Reading"; it was signed simply [...] "The Editors" [...] until McComas ceased to be one of the co-editors, after which Boucher used his own name. [...] According to Clareson, the column [...] "long remained the most catholic appraisal of the field" [...] because of the variety of works reviewed. [...] Boucher did not review his own fiction in the column, though on at least one occasion he listed a new book of his, telling the reader: [...] "Comments eagerly welcomed; in this <b>case,</b> <b>you</b> are the reviewer". [...] When Boucher left, he was succeeded by Damon Knight as book reviewer; Alfred Bester took over in 1960 and remained in the role until Avram Davidson became the book reviewer when he took the editorial chair. [...] Isaac Asimov had begun a series of science articles for Venture Science Fiction in January 1958, and when Venture was cancelled Mills brought the science column over to F. [...] The column, which according to Asimov he enjoyed writing more than any of his other works, ran for decades without interruption, helping to contribute to a long-standing feeling of consistency and continuity in Fs format and contents.|$|E
