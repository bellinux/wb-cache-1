40|$|The {{authors of}} the paper studied the {{influence}} of certain ecological factors on the appearance of Hazel Grouse Bonasa bonasia in eight study areas in Bohinj. The study areas included 143 <b>census</b> <b>points</b> on which 25 territorial males were recorded. Beside that, the authors collected 79 accidental observations of Hazel Grouse, which {{were included in the}} research. Hazel Grouse prefers higher altitudes. The main part of the population was found between 1280 and 1490 m above see level. The comparison between systematicallyand accidentally obtained data showed no differences. The presence of deciduous trees in a forest proved to have no influence on the occurrence of Hazel Grouse. Most sightings of Hazel Grouse were made in plots with a higher proportion of conifers, although these plots were no different from the other study areas. The appearance of Hazel Grouse depended mostly on the presence of forest openings around <b>census</b> <b>points,</b> but also on the canopy closure in the shrub and field layers. Hazel Grouse preferred <b>census</b> <b>points</b> with a higher canopy closure in the shrub and field layers as well as a higherproportion of forest openings.

[...] Racial tensions, fear of race riots and white flight in the 1960s and 1970s saw many businesses move away and shifted the demographics of the neighborhood to mostly African American. The heroin epidemic of the 1970s and crack epidemic of the '90s and its related crime also affected Point Breeze. Between 1988 and 1990 the Philadelphia Police department performed a series of raids in Point Breeze effectively shutting down the Carr family drug ring which reportedly had been selling $1.3 million per year in crack, cocaine and prescription drugs. [...] The Point Breeze Performing Arts Center opened in 1984 on Point Breeze Avenue. [...] Point Breeze lost approximately 10% of its population from 1990 through 2000. Despite this, in the 1990s some revitalization efforts have taken place through such organizations as South Philadelphia H.O.M.E.S. and Universal Companies, owned by Kenny Gamble, that helped build low income housing and schools in the area.

40|$|I studied bird {{community}} {{dynamics and}} habitat associations of forest birds in northeast Iowa in 1995 and 1996. During this study, 107 different bird species were detected in northeast Iowa forests, including many neotropical migrant songbirds. However, a nest parasite, the brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater), {{was the most}} frequently detected bird during this study. The abundance and species richness of birds (both expressed as mean numbers per bird <b>census</b> <b>point</b> at each site) were both higher in 1995 but the rank orders of bird species in 1995 and 1996 were highly correlated, suggesting stable bird community structure over time;Most previous investigations of bird-habitat relationships conducted in Midwestern forests have excluded recently logged/pastured habitats. In this study, we included forests varying widely in area (32 [...] 486 ha) and disturbance history (forest preserves, recently logged/pastured forests, etc.). We discovered that bird species considered to be of high management concern by the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service have higher species richness (mean number of species per <b>census</b> <b>point</b> at each site) in undisturbed forests than in recently disturbed forests. Species richness of these birds was also higher in large forest tracts than in smaller forests patches;Finally, we discovered that bird community composition shifts along a forest composition gradient, with many bird groups (e. g., neotropical migrants, USFWS high management concern species) tending to be more abundant and/or species rich in mesic forests.

40|$|The {{effective}} {{population size}} (Ne) {{is a critical}} evolutionary and conservation parameter that can indicate the adaptive potential of populations. Robust estimates of Ne of endangered taxa have been previously hampered by estimators that are sensitive to sample size. We estimated Ne on two remaining populations of the endangered Miami blue butterfly, a formerly widespread taxon in Florida. Our goal {{was to determine the}} consistency of various temporal and point estimators on inferring Ne and to determine the utility of this information for understanding the role of genetic stochasticity. We found that recently developed ‘unbiased estimators’ generally performed better than some older methods in that the former had more realistic Ne estimates and were more consistent with what is known about adult population size. Overall, Ne/N ratios based on <b>census</b> <b>point</b> counts were high. We suggest that this pattern may reflect genetic compensation caused by reduced reproductive variance due to breeding population size not being limited by resources. Assuming Ne and N are not heavily biased, it appears that the lack of gene flow between distant populations may be a greater genetic threat in the short term than the loss of heterozygosity due to inbreeding...|$|E
40|$|The flow of {{patients}} through geriatric hospitals {{has been previously}} {{described in terms of}} acute (short‐stay), rehabilitation (medium‐stay), and long‐stay states where the bed occupancy at a <b>census</b> <b>point</b> is modelled by a mixed exponential model using BOMPS (Bed Occupancy Modelling and Planning System). In this a patient is initially admitted to acute care. The majority of the patients are discharged within a few days into their own homes or through death. The rest are converted into medium‐stay patients where they could stay for a few months and thereafter either leave the system or move on to a long‐stay compartment where they could stay until they die. The model forecasts the average length of stay as well as the average number {{of patients}} in each state. The average length of stay in the acute compartment is artificially high if some would‐be long‐term patients are kept waiting in the short‐stay compartment until beds become available in long‐stay (residential and nursing homes).

40|$|To {{establish}} {{the prevalence of}} wounds and their management in a community care setting. A multi-site, <b>census</b> <b>point</b> prevalence wound survey was conducted in the following areas: intellectual disability, psychiatry, GP practices, prisons, long-term care private nursing homes, long-term care, public nursing homes and the community/public health (district) nursing services on one randomly selected day. Acute services were excluded. Formal ethical approval was obtained. Data were collected using a pre-piloted questionnaire. Education was provided to nurses recording the tool (n= 148). Descriptive statistical analysis was performed. A 97. 2 % response rate yielded a crude prevalence rate of 15. 6 % for wounds across nursing disciplines (290 / 1, 854 total census) and 0. 2 % for the community area (290 / 133, 562 population statistics for the study area). Crude point prevalence ranged from 2. 7 % in the prison services (7 / 262 total prison population surveyed) to 33. 5 % in the intellectual disability services (72 / 215 total intellectual disability population surveyed). The most frequent wounds recorded were pressure ulcers (crude point prevalence 4 %, 76 / 1, 854 total census; excluding category l crude point prevalence was 2. 6 %, 49 / 1, 854 total census), leg ulcers (crude point prevalence 2. 9 %, 55 / 1, 854 total census), self-inflicted superficial abrasions (crude point prevalence 2. 2 %, 41 / 1, 854 total census) and surgical wounds (crude point prevalence 1. 7 %, 32 / 1, 854 total census). These results support previous international research in that they identify a high prevalence of wounds in the community. The true community prevalence of wounds is arguably much higher, as this study identified only wounds known to the nursing services and excluded acute settings and was conducted on one day...|$|E
40|$|Theoretical and {{empirical}} studies on logging impacts internationally indicate that edges between mature forest and regrowth may alter the abundance {{and distribution of}} fauna, with implications for biodiversity conservation. The south-west Western Australian karri (Eucalyptus diversicolor) forest bird community is characterised by high degrees of endemism, cooperative breeding and reliance on nest hollows. It may therefore show different responses to clearfelled edges than bird communities in Northern Hemisphere forests, where most edge studies have been carried out. The term Edge Effect was originally defined specifically as an increase in abundance and diversity at the edge but has since been used indiscriminately to describe any change in distribution across an edge, confusing any assessment of the types and prevalence of these changes. For clarity, in this thesis the term Edge Response was {{used to describe the}} response of a community, guild or species to edges, and the term Edge Effect restricted to its original definition. I surveyed the international literature to determine the types and prevalence of community level changes in bird distribution across edges. Edge Effects at the community level are not common internationally, while there are many other documented types of edge response. Foraging or functional guilds can differ in their edge responses, and at the species level, edge responses have been demonstrated to differ between habitats for the same species, and may also change seasonally. Therefore, I monitored the distribution of birds at the Community, Guild and Species levels across replicated clear-fell edges (120 m and 60 m into regrowth, at the edge and 60 m into mature forest) between mature forest and 1) Establishment regrowth, 2) Juvenile regrowth and 3) mature forest (control, no edge) in three karri forest areas over four seasons (one year), and one forest area over eight seasons (two IV years). A five minute count of birds within each 30 m radius circular plot was repeated approximately five times each season (108 plots in the first year, 36 plots over two years). Mean values of abundance (for the whole bird community and for individual species) and diversity measures for each <b>census</b> <b>point</b> were calculated and analysed with repeated measures ANOVA. Bird behavioural and vegetation data and Mist-netting captures across edges were also investigated. My aims were to 1) describe and quantify any edge-related changes in the distribution and abundance of the birds 2) suggest possible explanations for the patterns observed and 3) propose management actions to minimise negative impacts. There was no Community Edge Effect. The bird community as a whole did not respond to edges themselves, but was most abundant where mature forest was present (including at edges), least abundant and diverse in Establishment regrowth and intermediate in abundance and diversity in Juvenile regrowth. Guilds were poor predictors of species edge responses. Only the Nectarivores showed a unified response to edges - all five species avoided regrowth and four species avoided Juvenile edges. The Granivore/Frugivore guild and the whole Insectivore guild were less abundant in regrowth than in mature forest but did not have higher or lower abundance at the edge. Insectivorous species' edge responses were diverse and not reliably attributed to foraging-strata guilds (Understorey; Shrub; Canopy; All-Levels; Aerial; Bark). The Tree Martin, an Aerial foraging insectivore, showed an Edge Effect at Establishment edges {{in the first year of}} the study only. Individual vegetation variables were poor predictors of bird species distributions but overall, floristics changed with forest area not with edge distance, while habitat structural variables varied with edge, forest age and distance from the edge indicating that overall, structural variables were most strongly related to bird edge responses. The proportion of trees of 10 - 24 cm diameterwas highest at Juvenile edges, which were avoided by four Nectarivore species and the bark-foraging Rufous Treecreeper. Ordination grouped bird species by six edge response categories - Avoid edges; Prefer edges; Prefer Mature-forest; Prefer Mature-forest/Juvenile-regrowth; Prefer Establishment-regrowth; Neutral. However for individual species, these edge responses changed both temporally and spatially, emphasising the need for edge studies to be well replicated in both time and space. Some bird species also showed behavioural changes across edges. Species potentially disadvantaged by the creation of clear-fell edges are those avoiding Juvenile edges (Purple-crowned Lorikeet, New Holland Honeyeater, White-naped Honeyeater, Little Wattlebird and Rufous Treecreeper), and those most abundant in Mature forest habitat, but which show great spatial variation in abundance and therefore have unclear responses to edges (Whitebrowed Babbler, Restless Flycatcher). Several management options to ameliorate the effects of edge creation within production forest areas for these species will be discussed...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{evaluates the}} {{influence}} of selected stand characteristics of deciduous forest on the composition of nesting ornithocenosis.

Using the point counting method, composition of nesting birds has been found on 50 <b>census</b> <b>points</b> located systematically in the stands of different ages and with different tree composition (mainly various presence of European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and oak (Quercus spp.)). There were 1119 birds in total belonging to 38 species. It turned out that the presence of oak in vegetation affects the numbers of Finches, Great Spotted Woodpeckers, Blue Tits, Blackbirds, Golden Orioles, Cuckoos and Wood Pigeons. Presence of beech in forests affected some bird species with the opposite trend to the presence of oak in most cases. The number of species and individuals and diversity of bird communities at the <b>census</b> <b>points</b> increased with increasing presence of oak and decreased with the presence of beech. Stand age and spatial structure appeared to be an important factor in the occurrence of some bird species. The highest number of species has been recorded in the old stands.

Land pressures also were alleviated by the vast tracts of untitled land in the east. Beginning in the 1960s, however, competition for land in the area increased dramatically.
