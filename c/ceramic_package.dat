25|$|Most modern tubes have glass {{envelope}}s, but metal, {{fused quartz}} (silica) and ceramic {{have also been}} used. A first version of the 6L6 used a metal envelope sealed with glass beads, while a glass disk fused to the metal was used in later versions. Metal and ceramic are used almost exclusively for power tubes above 2kW dissipation. The nuvistor was a modern receiving tube using a very small metal and <b>ceramic</b> <b>package.</b>|$|E
25|$|After a {{redesign}} in 1983, the VIC-II was {{encased in}} a plastic dual in-line package, which reduced costs substantially, {{but it did not}} totally eliminate the heat problem. Without a <b>ceramic</b> <b>package,</b> the VIC-II required the use of a heat sink. To avoid extra cost, the metal RF shielding doubled as the heat sink for the VIC, although not all units shipped with this type of shielding. Most C64s in Europe shipped with a cardboard RF shield, coated with a layer of metal foil. The effectiveness of the cardboard was highly questionable, and worse still it acted as an insulator, blocking airflow which trapped heat generated by the SID, VIC, and PLA chips. The SID was originally manufactured using NMOS at 7 and in some areas 6 micrometers. The prototype SID and some very early production models featured a ceramic dual in-line package, but unlike the VIC-II, these are extremely rare as the SID was encased in plastic when production started in early 1982.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present the thermal and {{mechanical}} analysis of high-power light-emitting diodes (LEDs) with <b>ceramic</b> <b>packages.</b> Transient thermal measurements and thermo-mechanical simulation {{were performed to}} study the thermal and mechanical characteristics of <b>ceramic</b> <b>packages.</b> Thermal resistance from the junction to the ambient was decreased from 76. 1 oC/W to 45. 3 oC/W by replacing plastic mould to ceramic mould for LED packages. Higher level of thermo-mechanical stresses in the chip were found for LEDs with <b>ceramic</b> <b>packages</b> despite of less mismatching coefficients of thermal expansion comparing with plastic packages. The {{results suggest that the}} thermal performance of LEDs can be improved by using <b>ceramic</b> <b>packages,</b> but the mounting process of the high power LEDs with <b>ceramic</b> <b>packages</b> is critically important and should be in charge of delaminating interface layers in the packages.

50|$|Packages {{consisting}} of a lead frame embedded in a vitreous paste layer between flat ceramic top and bottom covers are more convenient than metal/glass packages for some products, but give equivalent performance. Examples are integrated circuit chips in <b>ceramic</b> Dual In-line <b>Package</b> form, or complex hybrid assemblies of chip components on a ceramic base plate. This type of packaging can also {{be divided into two}} main types: multilayer <b>ceramic</b> <b>packages</b> (like LTCC and HTCC) and pressed <b>ceramic</b> <b>packages.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The VIC-II was {{manufactured}} with 5 micrometer NMOS {{technology and}} was clocked at either [...] (PAL) or [...] (NTSC). Internally, the clock was divided down {{to generate the}} dot clock (about 8MHz) and the two-phase system clocks (about 1MHz; the exact pixel and system clock speeds are slightly different between NTSC and PAL machines). At such high clock rates, the chip generated a lot of heat, forcing MOS Technology to use a ceramic dual in-line package called a [...] "CERDIP". The <b>ceramic</b> <b>package</b> was more expensive, but it dissipated heat more effectively than plastic.|$|E

50|$|The 8061 {{was built}} in a 3-micrometre N-MOS {{silicon-gate}} process. Plastic 68-pin flatpacks, <b>ceramic</b> <b>packages,</b> and 40-pin DIP packages were used, depending on the I/O pin-count requirements of a particular module design.|$|R
40|$|The {{susceptibility}} of adhesive-sealed <b>ceramic</b> <b>packages</b> to moisture permeation was investigated. The two adhesives, Ablebond 789 - 1 and Epo-Tek H 77, {{were evaluated}} as package sealants. These adhesives were previously {{selected as the}} most promising candidates for this application {{from a group of}} ten adhesives. <b>Ceramic</b> <b>packages</b> sealed with these adhesives were exposed to temperature-humidity conditions of 25 C/ 98 percent RH, 50 C/ 60 percent RH, 50 C/ 98 percent RH, and 85 C/ 85 percent RH and their moisture contents using were monitored solid state moisture sensors sealed inside them. Five packages were tested at each of these exposures - two <b>ceramic</b> <b>packages</b> sealed with each of the two adhesives and one seam-sealed gold-plated Kovar package. This latter package was included to serve as a control. The results showed that the adhesive-sealed packages were not hermetic to moisture. The rates at which moisture entered the packages increased with the severity of the exposure environments (i. e., higher temperatures and higher moisture vapor pressures) with greater dependence on temperature than on moisture vapor pressure...|$|R

40|$|Energy {{dissipation}} and {{the transport}} of <b>ceramic</b> <b>packaging</b> substrates in a belt furnace for the manufacture of multichip module (MCM) devices were investigated based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Using the results of temperature profiles and knowledge of thermal expansion coefficients and thermophysical properties, the transient thermal stresses of the substrates were calculated through structure analysis at each grid point along the belt. Various levels of the belt speed and purging-gas flow rate were considered in the CFD simulation to evaluate their influence on stress formation inside the solid-state substrates. Results show that the induced thermal stress in MCM substrates is highly sensitive to their heating histories {{as well as the}} flow fields that develop inside the furnace. Subsequently, a search for optimal operating conditions for the firing process was conducted, with the goal of minimizing stress generation inside the glass-ceramic substrates, using the surface response method and an artificial neural network (ANN) approach.
