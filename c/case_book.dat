500|$|As {{his career}} progressed in the league, Rudolph took on {{responsibilities}} beyond officiating. [...] In 1966, {{he was named}} referee-in-chief and worked alongside Dolph Schayes, who was hired as the league's supervisor of officials that year to replace Sid Borgia. [...] In this position, he oversaw areas that pertained to referee mechanics, techniques, and rule interpretations. It was in this role that he authored the NBA Official’s Manual and <b>Case</b> <b>Book.</b>|$|E
500|$|Anton Chekhov in {{his plays}} The Seagull, Uncle Vanya and Three Sisters {{describes}} the tortured emotional states of doctors who {{at some point}} in their careers have turned their back on conscience. In his short stories, Chekhov also explored how people misunderstood the voice of a tortured conscience. A promiscuous student, for example, in The Fit describes it as a [...] "dull pain, indefinite, vague; it was like anguish and the most acute fear and despair... in his breast, under the heart" [...] and the young doctor examining the misunderstood agony of compassion experienced by the factory owner's daughter in From a <b>Case</b> <b>Book</b> calls it an [...] "unknown, mysterious power... in fact close at hand and watching him." [...] Characteristically, Chekhov's own conscience drove him on the long journey to Sakhalin to record and alleviate the harsh conditions of the prisoners at that remote outpost. As Irina Ratushinskaya writes in the introduction to that work: [...] "Abandoning everything, he travelled to the distant island of Sakhalin, the most feared place of exile and forced labour in Russia at that time. One cannot help but wonder why? Simply, because the lot of the people there was a bitter one, because nobody really knew about the lives and deaths of the exiles, because he felt that they stood in greater need of help that anyone else. A strange reason, maybe, but not for a writer who was the epitome of all the best traditions of a Russian man of letters. Russian literature has always focused on questions of conscience and was, therefore, a powerful force in the moulding of public opinion." ...|$|E

6000|$|I {{did not see}} the {{application}} and told him so. For reply he reached over and took my ear in his hand and pulled it playfully, as he used long ago to do at lectures, and said, [...] "The good husbandman tell you so then because he knows, but not till then. But you do not find the good husbandman dig up his planted corn to see if he grow. That is for the children who play at husbandry, and not for those who take it as of the work of their life. See you now, friend John? I have sown my corn, and Nature has her work to do in making it sprout, if he sprout at all, there's some promise, and I wait till the ear begins to swell." [...] He broke off, for he evidently saw that I understood. Then he went on gravely, [...] "You were always a careful student, and your <b>case</b> <b>book</b> was ever more full than the rest. And I trust that good habit have not fail. Remember, my friend, that knowledge is stronger than memory, and we should not trust the weaker. Even if you have not kept the good practice, {{let me tell you that}} this case of our dear miss is one that may be, mind, I say may be, of such interest to us and others that all the rest may not make him kick the beam, as your people say. Take then good note of it. Nothing is too small. I counsel you, put down in record even your doubts and surmises. Hereafter it may be of interest to you to see how true you guess. We learn from failure, not from success!" ...|$|E
