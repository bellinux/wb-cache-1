40|$|Modern {{information}} retrieval interfaces typically involve multiple pages of search results, and users who are recall minded or engaging in exploratory search using ad hoc queries {{are likely to}} access more than one page. Document rankings for such queries can be improved by allowing additional context to the query to be provided by the user herself using explicit ratings or implicit actions such as <b>clickthroughs.</b> Existing methods using this information usually involved detrimental UI changes that can lower user satisfaction. Instead, we propose a new feedback scheme that makes use of existing UIs and does not alter user’s browsing behaviour; to maximise retrieval performance over multiple result pages, we propose a novel retrieval optimisation framework and show that the optimal ranking policy should choose a diverse, exploratory ranking to display on the first page. Then, a personalised re-ranking of the next pages can be generated based on the user’s feedback from the first page. We show that document correlations used in result diversification {{have a significant impact}} on relevance feedback and its effectiveness over a search session. TREC evaluations demonstrate that our optimal rank strategy (including approximative Monte Carlo Sampling) can naturally optimise the trade-off between exploration and exploitation and maximise the overall user’s satisfaction over time against a number of similar baselines...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — As {{the amount}} of Web {{information}} grows rapidly, search engines {{must be able to}} retrieve information according to the user’s preference. In this paper, we propose a new web search personalization approach that captures the user’s interests and preferences in the form of concepts by mining search results and their <b>clickthroughs.</b> Due to the important role location information plays in mobile search, we separate concepts into content concepts and location concepts, and organize them into ontologies to create an ontology-based, multi-facet (OMF) profile to precisely capture the user’s content and location interests and hence improve the search accuracy. Moreover, recognizing the fact that different users and queries may have different emphases on content and location information, we introduce the notion of content and location entropies to measure {{the amount of}} content and location information associated with a query, and click content and location entropies to measure how much the user is interested in the content and location information in the results. Accordingly, we propose to define personalization effectiveness based on the entropies and use it to balance the weights between the content and location facets. Finally, based on the derived ontologies and personalization effectiveness, we train an SVM to adapt a personalized ranking function for re-ranking of future search. We conduct extensive experiments to compare the precision produced by our OMF profiles and that of a baseline method. Experimental results show that OMF improves the precision significantly compared to the baseline. I...|$|R

User value is assessed in three overall categories: (1) utility or reading value, (2) quality or citing value, and (3) cost effectiveness. In addition to analyzing vendor-generated usage metrics, also included were Affinity String data, derived from the University of Minnesota’s central authentication system that anonymously captures a user’s academic department and degree program or position at the university and combined with vendor-generated usage data, provides a granular picture of journal use down to the title level. Collection management librarians and library users can benefit from a viable, more accurate metric for use and value of library resources than cost-per-download, which would ensure that the most needed/valued resources are available to further research and learning. Methodology: Metrics were identified that are utilized to determine e-journal retainability: OpenURL link resolver requests for article views, COUNTER-compliant downloads, JCR Impact Factors, Eigenfactor Scores, local citations from Thomson Reuters Local Journal Use Reports and Affinity String requests for article views. Two years of usage data were assessed using Pearson correlation coefficients to compare the different metrics. Affinity String data is correlated with the results to determine any discipline or degree level differences. A composite score is assigned to each journal to assess its overall value in comparison to other journals within the same broad subject category.

50|$|<b>Clickthrough</b> {{rates of}} Interactive Reverse RingBack Tones are {{reported}} {{at an average}} of 2.5% with a wide variance from 0% up to 7.5%, depending on the offering of the advertisement itself.In 2009, Nielsen Mobile estimated that an average U.S. mobile subscriber receives about 4 calls per day, which places the total inbound call volume of 3 billion global mobile subscribers at approximately 12 billion inbound calls per day, a figure that has remained more or less steady for the past few years. Based on the total inbound call volume, the global opportunity for Ad‐RBTs is immense. For example, if just twelve million mobile subscribers used Ad‐RBTs to advertise a favorite product or organization, RingBack Tone advertising would be delivering approximately 48 million paid advertisements per day, a figure slightly higher than Google’s pay‐per‐click search advertising interactions per day on the web. Furthermore, Ad‐RBTs are a mobile experience that is always shared between users, giving it the potential to expand virally if Ad‐RBT content is engaging, interesting, funny, or relates to brands or causes that people are passionate about. Therefore, it is important that ad content is brief and efficient, exciting and playful, or practical and need‐specific to increase consumer acceptance and interaction and reduce churn rate.|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} that <b>clickthrough</b> data can be used to improve the {{effectiveness}} of search results: broadly speaking, a query’s past clicks are a predictor of future clicks on documents. However, when a new or unusual query appears, or when a system is not as widely used as a mainstream web search system, there may be little to no click data available to improve the results. Existing methods to boost query performance for sparse queries extend the query-document click relationship to more documents or queries, but require substantial <b>clickthrough</b> data from other queries. In this work we describe a way to boost rarely-clicked queries in a system where limited <b>clickthrough</b> data is available for all queries. We describe a probabilistic approach for carrying out that estimation and use it to rerank retrieved documents. We utilize information from co-click queries, subset queries, and synonym queries to estimate the <b>clickthrough</b> for a sparse query.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Clickthrough</b> data is a {{critical}} feature for improving web search ranking. Recently, many search portals have provided aggregated search, which retrieves relevant information from various heterogeneous collections called verticals. In addition tothe well-known problem of rank bias, <b>clickthrough</b> data recorded in the aggregated search environment suffers from severe sparseness problems due to {{the limited number of}} results presented for each vertical. This skew in <b>clickthrough</b> data, which we call rank cut, makes optimization of vertical searches more difficult. In this work, we focus on mitigating the negative effect of rank cut for aggregated vertical searches. We introduce a technique for smoothing click counts based on spectral graph analysis. Using real <b>clickthrough</b> data from a vertical recorded in an aggregated search environment, we show empirically that <b>clickthrough</b> data smoothed by this technique is effective for improving the vertical search. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{interactions}} of users with search engines {{can be seen}} as implicit relevance feedback by the user on the results offered to them. In particular, the selection of results by users can be interpreted as a confirmation of the relevance of those results, and used to reorder or prioritize subsequent search results. This collection of search/result pairings is called <b>clickthrough</b> data, and many uses for it have been proposed. However, the reliability of <b>clickthrough</b> data has been challenged and {{it has been suggested that}} <b>clickthrough</b> data are not a completely accurate measure of relevance between search term and results. This paper reports on an experiment evaluating the reliability of <b>clickthrough</b> data as a measure of the mutual relevance of search term and result. The experiment comprised a user study involving over 67 participants and determines the reliability of image search <b>clickthrough</b> data, using factors identified in previous similar studies. A major difference in this work to previous work is that the source of <b>clickthrough</b> data comes from image searches, rather than the traditional text page searches. Image search <b>clickthrough</b> data were rarely examined in prior works but has differences that impact the accuracy of <b>clickthrough</b> data. These differences include a more complete representation of the results in image search, allowing users to scrutinize the results more closely before selecting them, as well as presenting the results in a less obviously ordered way. The experiment reported here demonstrates that image <b>clickthrough</b> data can be more reliable as a relevance feedback measure than has been the case with traditional text-based search. There is also evidence that the precision of the search system influences the accuracy of click data when users make searches in an information-seeking capacity.
