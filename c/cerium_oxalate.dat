Highly transparent single crystals of average size 3 mm× 2 mm× 1 mm with well-defined hexagonal morphology were grown during a time period of two weeks. X-ray powder diffraction analysis revealed that the grown crystals crystallize in the monoclinic system with space group P 21 /c as identical with the pure <b>cerium</b> <b>oxalate.</b> The various functional groups of the oxalate ligand and the water of crystallization were identified by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The photoluminescence spectrum of the Sm 3 + doped <b>cerium</b> <b>oxalate</b> indicated that the Sm 3 + ions are optically active in the <b>cerium</b> <b>oxalate</b> matrix. The crystal has a strong and efficient orange red emission with a wavelength peak at 595 nm and hence can be effectively used for optical amplification.

40|$|The {{synthesis}} of <b>cerium</b> <b>oxalate,</b> a reaction intermediate {{in the preparation}} of high performance ceramics, is studied in sessile droplets. We compare here the effect of alcoholic solvents with the usage of structured solvents, namely ultra-flexible microemulsions in the water-rich and oil-rich configurations. The nucleation and the growth of <b>cerium</b> <b>oxalate</b> particles are the result of local mixing by the Marangoni flow of droplets loaded with oxalic acid and cerium nitrate. The morphology of the particles is very different depending on the composition of the solvent and on the mixing process. We show that the variation of the particle morphology results from the difference of the structured solvent microphases during the precipitation process. When the precipitation occurs in a water continuous phase, usual needle-like oxalate particles precipitate. When the precipitate is formed in the dispersed phase of the emulsion, structured aggregates, as close-packed aggregates of needles, are compacted by microcapillarity effects...|$|E

Under the {{conditions}} of the presence of surfactants and ultrasonication, the use of different cerium salt, respectively, with oxalic acid under solid state chemistry reactions, the synthesis of nano-rare earth metal complexes of <b>cerium</b> <b>oxalate</b> crystals was formed. The solid phase was characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and electron diffraction (ED). The particle size, its distribution, and morphology of the prepared nanocrystallite were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results show that particle sizes are relatively uniform, the morphology of the crystal is spherical, the average particle diameter is about 40 nm, and the yield rate is approximately 91. 6 %. Furthermore, during the synthesis, the solid-state reaction conditions including raw materials, matching proportion of reactants, additions of inert substance, addition of trace solvents, surfactants and porphyrization time, etc, all have some influence on the morphology, particle size and size distribution of the final products. During the synthesis of the <b>cerium</b> <b>oxalate</b> nanocrystallines, the solid state reaction conditions such as changing reactant, matching proportion of reactant, adding inert substance, joining a little solvent or surface active solvent and grinding at different times may influence morphology, particle size and the size distribution of final products...|$|E

The mechanisms of decomposition of Ce and Gd oxalate are different, and mixed oxalates behave in an intermediate way. Their dehydration stages are more {{similar to those of}} Gd oxalate, as not all the molecules of water are equivalent like the <b>cerium</b> <b>oxalate.</b> The decomposition leads to (Ce 1 –xGdx) O 2 –x/ 2.

In this letter we report the preparation of fine-particle, large-surface-area ceria by the combustion process developed for the preparation of α-alumina [7], aluminates [8], chromites [9] and ferrites [10]. The process involves rapid decomposition of a saturated aqueous solution containing ceric ammonium nitrate and urea (CH_ 4 N_ 20), carbohydrazide (CH_ 6 N_ 4 O (CH)), oxalyl dihydrazide (C_ 2 H_ 16 N_ 4 O_ 2 (ODH)) or tetraformal trisazine (C_ 4 H_ 16 N_ 6 O_ 2 (TFTA)) redox mixtures...|$|E

40|$|Solid state {{white light}} {{emitting}} diode lighting devices outperform conventional light sources in terms of lifetime, durability, and lumens per watt. However, the capital contribution is still to high to encourage widespread adoption. Furthermore, the colour from today's devices is unsuitable for general room illumination and thus new phosphor materials are needed. This dissertation will examine the synthesis of inorganic nanoparticles {{and the possibility of}} using hybrid inorganic-organic frameworks in the search for new lighting phosphors. Nanoparticles of the oxide compound yttrium aluminium garnet were synthesized using an emulsion technique, though {{it was found that the}} high temperature processing needed for good optical properties was not compatible with maintaining nanosized particles. In terms of hybrid framework phosphors, several aspects of this new area have been explored. The mechanical and optical properties of a dense <b>cerium</b> <b>oxalate</b> formate hybrid framework compound have been investigated. Its strength was found to be nearly as great as some classical ceramic compounds, and clearly robust enough for device applications. While the photoluminescence of the <b>cerium</b> <b>oxalate</b> formate was not suitable for solid state lighting, the impressive mechanical properties evaluated are expected to be valid for a wide range of dense inorganic-organic frameworks. A novel approach to solid state lighting phosphors was introduced by using ligand-based photoluminescence in hybrid frameworks. Novel frameworks were prepared using 9, 10 -anthraquinone- 2, 3 -dicarboxylic acid in combination with calcium, manganese, nickel, and zinc. These compounds show excellent photoluminescent emission for use in solid state lighting applications, although the luminescence is quenched at room temperature due to dynamic effects. The excitation, while reaching the blue part of the spectrum, falls just short of what is needed for use today's devices. To address these issues, a second class of novel framework compounds was prepared using 9 -fluorenone- 2, 7 -dicarboxylic acid in combination with calcium, strontium, barium, cadmium, and manganese. They are more rigid structures and show good luminescence at room temperature with a photoluminescent excitation spectrum extending further into the blue than the anthraquinones. Additionally, quantum yield in the calcium fluorenone is nearly double that of its parent ligand, suggesting that there is an enhancement in luminescent properties as a result its inclusion in a framework structure. An explanation for the differences in efficiency between seemingly similar compounds are drawn from their compositions, crystal structures, photoluminescence, and specific heat properties. Finally, some structural and chemical targets for future hybrid phosphor development are identified based on the relationships identified in this work.

40|$|The {{coalescence}} {{behavior of}} two sessile drops that contain different chemical reactants (cerium nitrate and oxalic acid) {{and its impact}} on the formation of the solid precipitate (<b>cerium</b> <b>oxalate)</b> are investigated. With different liquids, the surface tension difference in the moment of drop− drop contact can induce a Marangoni flow. This flow can strongly influence the drop−drop coalescence behavior and thus, with reacting liquids, also the reaction and its products (through the liquid mixing). In our study we find three distinctly different coalescence behaviors (“barrier”, “intermediate”, “noncoalescence”), in contrast to only two behaviors that were observed in the case of nonreacting liquids. The amount of liquid mixing and thus the precipitation rate are very different for the three cases. The “intermediate” case, which exhibits the strongest mixing, has been studied in more detail. For high oxalic acid concentrations, mainly needle-like aggregates, and for low concentrations, mainly flower-like precipitate morphologies are obtained. In a transition range of the oxalic acid concentration, both morphologies can be produced. With the applied coalescence conditions, the different aggregate particles are arranged and fixed in a precipitate raft in a regular, periodic line pattern. This confirms the drop−drop coalescence configuration as a convection-reaction-diffusion system, which can have stationary as well as oscillatory behavior depending on the system parameters...|$|E
