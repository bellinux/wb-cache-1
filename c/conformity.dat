5|$|Asch also {{believed}} {{the relationship between}} <b>conformity</b> and non-conformity was {{not as simple as}} one being the opposite of the other. This was Asch's third influential idea, and he suggested that <b>conformity</b> and resistance might be explained by their own unique social psychological processes. <b>Conformity,</b> for instance, could be a function of how aware a person is that they are being influenced by the group (distortion of perception), {{the degree to which the}} person believes that the group consensus is correct (distortion of judgement), and how badly the person wants to be accepted by the group (distortion of action). Although these exact terms have not been directly ported over to the literature, researchers such as Moscovici and Nemeth have adopted the perspective that majority and minority influence are moderated by multiple processes (Levine, 1999).|$|E

The research employed quantitative approach by using true experimental design with pretest-postest control group design. The subjects of the research were 22 students of class IX who were identified they had high negative <b>conformities</b> toward peers.

The results of the research reveal that (1) the implementation of assertive training technique in reducing negative <b>conformities</b> toward peer group is implemented based on the procedure designed in 5 meetings, (2) negative <b>conformities</b> towards peer group before the implementation of assertive training technique is in high category.

40|$|Diversities have {{recently}} been developed as multiway metrics admitting clear and useful notions of hyperconvexity and tight span. In this note we consider the analytic properties of diversities, in particular the generalizations of uniform continuity, uniform convergence, Cauchy sequences and completeness to diversities. We develop <b>conformities,</b> a diversity analogue of uniform spaces, which abstract these concepts in the metric case. We show {{that much of the}} theory of uniform spaces admits a natural analogue in this new structure; for example, <b>conformities</b> can be defined either axiomatically or in terms of uniformly continuous pseudodiversities. Just as diversities can be restricted to metrics, <b>conformities</b> can be restricted to uniformities. We find that these two notions of restriction, which are functors in the appropriate categories, are related by a natural transformation. Comment: 16 page...|$|R

5|$|At {{the same}} time, BLM {{said it would}} reduce the herd from its {{existing}} 195 adults to 120. The stated goal was to temporarily remove horses from the refuge to allow the range {{to recover from the}} historic overgrazing caused by livestock, not because BLM believed there were too many horses on the range. Sixty percent of the remaining horses would be males, to reduce the rate of population growth. The agency said it would remove 30 horses a year from the herd and stable them at a yearly cost of $18,000 to $21,000 until the correct herd size and sex ratios had been reached. Horses to be removed from the herd included those which did not closely fit the <b>conformity</b> type; which were genetically well represented; which were 11 to 15 years of age, had sired or foaled, and were not band stallions; and were between five and 10 years of age or 16 to 20 years of age. Genetic diversity would be measured by visual observation of the herd's <b>conformity</b> to type using a visual system developed by Dr. Sponenberg, and measures taken to improve genetic diversity if signs of inbreeding occurred. The Cloud Foundation and Front Range Equine Rescue, both feral horse advocacy groups, challenged the roundup in federal court. A federal district court judge delayed the roundup three days to consider their request, but on September 2, 2009, rejected the injunction and allowed the roundup to proceed.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to purges, banishments and censorship, Rosas took measures against {{the opposition and}} anyone else he deemed a threat that historians have considered state terrorism. Terror was a tool used to intimidate dissident voices, to shore up support among his own partisans and to exterminate his foes. His targets were denounced, sometimes inaccurately, as having ties to Unitarians. Those victimised included members of his government and party who were suspected of being insufficiently loyal. If actual opponents were not at hand, the regime found other targets that were punished to make an example. A climate of fear was used to create unquestioning <b>conformity</b> to Rosas' dictates.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year, hostility towards Dissenters increased. A Bill against {{occasional}} <b>conformity</b> was {{passed through the}} House of Commons and debated in the Lords.

Calvert, who had probably met Stock at the Spanish embassy in London, later worked with the priest on a plan for a Catholic mission in his new first Newfoundland Colony (off modern Canada).|$|E
