40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{establish}} reasonable values for both maximum deflection and minimum bearing capacity of runway strips, conforming to regulations specified by the Italian Civil Aviation Authority (ENAC), to implement in the design and reabilitation of the runway strips of the Cagliari Airport in Italy. The ENAC regulations state that the bearing capacity of runway strips must be designed based on the characteristics of both the critical aircraft and emergency vehicles which may transit on the runway. However, it does not specify a minimum bearing capacity value. Therefore, based on the instructions given by ENAC regulations, required values for both maximum deflection and minimum bearing capacity were determined using a Finite Element Method (FEM) simulation to design runway strips. In particular, a non‐linear analysis was conducted with FEM to simulate the mechanical behavior of granular soil under high instantaneous pressures. The paper explains how the theoretical analysis was conducted, which materials were tested, and how runway strips were designed. Before the construction, extensive on‐site testing was performed to validate the results obtained with the theoretical analysis. In particular, 122 series of single and double cycle bearing <b>capacity</b> <b>plate</b> and Light Weight Dropping (LWD) tests were performed. Results from these tests were used to define critical areas and to estimate any degree of correlation between the bearing <b>capacity</b> <b>plate</b> and LWD tests. The theoretical and experimental analyses carried out on this case study have enabled a design criterion and facilitated the rebuilding of the emergency strips of the Cagliari Airport in Italy, conforming to regulations specified by the ENAC. The results obtained with the theoretical analyses were validated by performing extensive on‐site testing...|$|E
40|$|Although {{the bearing}} <b>capacity</b> of <b>plate</b> anchors in clay {{has been studied}} extensively, the results {{considering}} the effects of offshore cyclic loading are relatively rare. In the present study, 1 g model tests are carried out to investigate the effect of cyclic loading on the bearing <b>capacity</b> of <b>plate</b> anchors in clay. The ultimate pullout <b>capacity</b> of <b>plate</b> anchors in clay decreases as the accumulated plastic shear strain grows due to the strain-softening of clay under cyclic loading.

The numerical model is proved by comparing the calculated bearing capacity with that of analytical solution. The numerical model is used to calculate the ultimate bearing <b>capacity</b> of the <b>plate</b> anchor subjected to the combined loads including the normal force, the tangential force and bending moment.

30|$|Accurate {{prediction}} {{of the load}} bearing <b>capacity</b> of <b>plate</b> structures {{plays an important role}} in many practical engineering problems. Traditional elastic designs cannot evaluate the actual load carrying <b>capacity</b> of <b>plates</b> and incremental elasto-plastic analyses can become cumbersome and present convergence issues for large-scale structures. Therefore, various limit analysis approaches have been devised to investigate the behavior of structures in the plastic region. Nowadays, limit analysis has become a well-known tool for assessing the safety load factor of engineering structures as an efficient direct method. Due to limitation of analytical methods, various numerical approaches such as finite element methods (FEM) [1]–[6], meshfree methods [7],[8], and natural element method [9], just to mention a few, have therefore been developed.|$|R

The database includes cells of varied storage times, <b>capacity,</b> <b>plate</b> design, stack design, terminal configuration, pressure vessel thickness, separator material, potassium hydroxide (KOH) concentration, and thermal control.

40|$|A {{dynamically}} embedded {{plate anchor}} (DEPLA) is a rocket-shaped anchor that penetrates to a target depth in the seabed by the kinetic energy obtained through free-fall {{and by the}} anchor’s self-weight. After embedment, the central shaft is retrieved leaving the anchor flukes vertically embedded in the seabed. The flukes constitute the load bearing element as a plate anchor. This paper presents and considers field data on the embedment depth loss due to the plate anchor keying process and the subsequent bearing capacity factor of the plate anchor element. The loss in plate anchor embedment {{was significantly higher than}} that reported from corresponding centrifuge tests and is reflected in the larger padeye displacements required to mobilize peak capacity in the field tests. Measured <b>plate</b> <b>capacities</b> and <b>plate</b> rotations during keying indicate that the end of keying coincides with the peak anchor capacity. Experimental bearing capacity factors are in the range Nc = 14. 3 – 14. 6, which is appreciably higher than existing solutions for vanishingly thin circular plates. The higher Nc for the DEPLA is considered to be due to a combination of the cruciform fluke arrangement and the fluke (or plate) thickness...|$|R

40|$|The {{required}} {{moment of}} inertia for steel plate girders is commonly provided by using relatively slender webs to achieve high strength-to-weight ratio.

The effects are studied by posing {{the problem as}} a planar contact elasticity problem, the pin and the plate being two elastic bodies which interact through contact. Coulomb friction is assumed, the pin loads the plate {{in one of its}} principal material directions, and the plate is infinite in extent. A collocation scheme and interaction, in conjunction with a complex variable series solution, are used to obtain numerical results. The contact region between the plate and pin is unknown and must be solved for as part of the solution. The same is true of the region of friction induced no slip. Two pin stiffnesses, two clearance levels, two friction levels and two laminates, a (0 /+ or - 45 / 90) s and a (02 /+ or - 45) s, are studied.

40|$|History {{shows that}} the {{combination}} of stresses and pressure in a vessel can cause failure and lead to huge losses, examples of this are the ‘Prestige accident’ (November 2002) and the ‘Energy Concentration accident’ (July 1980). In {{the oil and gas industry}} structures are often mobilized on the deck of a vessel, transported to a specific location offshore and installed on the seabed. Occasionally these structures are quite large, resulting in their sticking out from the deck. A side plate in the sheer strake area needs to be evaluated, as stresses from the protruding structure, and stresses and pressure from the vessel’s global loads, gives in-plane stresses and out-of-plane pressure. In this study, the aim is to establish a simplified approach for estimating stresses that arise from a vessels global loads, evaluate how much these stresses might influence the <b>plate</b> <b>capacity</b> and conclude whether these stresses should be included in a <b>plate</b> <b>capacity</b> check in Subsea 7. At this time, researchers such as Paik, Owen and Mansour are considered as wellestablished researchers in naval society, and their studies will be used to reach a method for finding the arising stresses on plate that occur because of the global vessel loads. The stresses will be estimated by idealizing the vessel as a hull girder and applying beam theory combined with recommendations from Det Norske Veritas. The study {{shows that the}}re are several key factors to establish these stresses and these factors will be estimated numerically and by computer software. The study shows that a stiffened side plate that is subjected to in-plane and out-ofplane stresses and pressure can experience failure modes when the structure on deck results in large stresses. In this study a stiffened <b>plate</b> <b>capacity</b> checks will be evaluated based on Det Norske Veritas (DNV) and NORSOK standards and recommended practices, and are considered as state-of-the-art approaches.
