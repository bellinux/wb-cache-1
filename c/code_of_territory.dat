40|$|The {{objective}} of the article is to consider a transition to neo-industrialization through a prism <b>of</b> <b>codes</b> (genetic) <b>of</b> the <b>territory,</b> allow-ing it to participate in neo-industrialization processes, and of the institutes stimulating its process, in specific conditions of managing practice. And to define a role of universities in formation of value- and competence-based <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> neo-industrialization. The plan and methodology included: analysis of relation of values and modernization; revealing of the values being characteristic for post-industrialization; revealing <b>of</b> neo-industrialization <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> <b>territory</b> and the actors forming these codes; at last, for empirical determination <b>of</b> neo-industrialization <b>codes</b> which universities create, – the poll of students of Ural state universities. So, to reveal the main <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> neo-industrialization its features were ana-lyzed being marked out by various researchers. The analysis showed that in the basis of neo-industrial development are the technical innovations rais-ing the labor productivity; the professional specialization caused by the level of education of population; and also new forms of interaction, both among the organizations and among people in a production process, creat-ing the new and updating the existing information flows and sources of their generation. Basic <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> neo-industrialization <b>of</b> a <b>territory</b> are: in-novative <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> <b>territory</b> (innovative solutions); production codes (pro-duction capacities); branch codes (branch specifics); information codes (in-formation and the information technologies); social-value <b>codes</b> (values <b>of</b> the population in terms of industrial transformations); social-competence codes (knowledge, ability and skills of population as of effective produc-tive force); institutional <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> <b>territory</b> (legislative provision <b>of</b> transi-tion to new type of industrialization). Respectively, the basic actors form-ing the <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> neo-industrialization are the enterprises of real sector (car-rier of production and industrial <b>codes),</b> society (carrier <b>of</b> social <b>codes),</b> authorities (carrier <b>of</b> institutional <b>codes).</b> Universities act as a transformer of information, innovative and value- and competence-based codes. For defining the neo-industrialization codes, what universities form, the poll of students of Ural state universities was carried out. It showed, that, {{to the majority of}} respondents, education is not only the process of knowledge transmission promoting to find job, but also the process of studying to live in the conditions being continually changed, of forming the platform for further self-development. The most of respondents are inclined to associate universities with the in-stitute of forming the competence-based <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> neo-industrialization, but also with research and international cooperation functions. As the poll showed, in Ural universities among scientific-educational measures at least represented are the meetings with business representatives – it’s a lack of interaction with enterprises, what could increase relevance and importance of the knowledge being transmitted. In the part of mutual influence of values and modernization processes, the poll showed that by new generation prevail secular-rational values what replaced the traditional values, forging the population in its behavior and needs as well as causing the resistance to innovative transformations. By new generation prevail the values of self-expression. That’s why {{it can be said that}} young generation positively percepts indus-trial transformations, being an active cell of postindustrial society. The fact that the values of self-expression prevail, testifies an active position of students and readiness to participate in changing their life. The answers of respondents received testify that one more institute of forming the social-value <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> neo-industrialization is a family, what confirms a theory of cultural transmission. In the part of the nearest planes of students after university graduation, the poll showed that new generation possesses the positive potential of in-novative transformations and neo-industrialization on the whole. The most popular answers were “to get a job on an existing enterprise”, “to study further (magistracy / postgraduate study) ”, “to create family”, “to create own business”. The results of research allow to conclude, that universities set and solve, by permanently improving themselves in ways, mechanisms and instru-ments, the double task: on the one hand, form the social competence-based <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> new industrialization furthering the forming the high-qualified work force; in the other hand, form the social value-based <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> new industrialization, such as leader qualities, patriotic qualities, re-sponsibility, general culture, what will create a neo-industrial perception of world and allow to exist in it successfully...|$|R

40|$|An {{integrated}} approach to sustainable well-being of each territorial system {{rests on the}} commitment of all its stakeholders to contribute to building a Green Society. This means, for each of them, a no-environmental dumping pathway. If territories aim for a homologation process, to compete with each other, this strategy, especially without strong public and private investments in innovation and labour productivity growth, it will trigger, as a very likely result, a race to the bottom, through the most different ways of dumping. The natural result will be to put at risk the possibility within them, to aim for an {{integrated approach}} to sustainable well-being. In this way, {{the goal of a}} Green Society and the aim of sustainable development in the global society can't be achieved.
