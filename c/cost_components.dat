25|$|Airflow can be {{harvested}} by various turbine and non-turbine generator technologies. For example, Zephyr Energy Corporation’s patented Windbeam micro generator captures energy from airflow to recharge batteries and power electronic devices.

The generator consists of a lightweight beam suspended by durable long-lasting springs within an outer frame. The beam oscillates rapidly when exposed to airflow due {{to the effects of}} multiple fluid flow phenomena. A linear alternator assembly converts the oscillating beam motion into usable electrical energy. A lack of bearings and gears eliminates frictional inefficiencies and noise. The generator can operate in low-light environments unsuitable for solar panels (e.g. HVAC ducts) and is inexpensive due to low <b>cost</b> <b>components</b> and simple construction. The scalable technology can be optimized to satisfy the energy requirements and design constraints of a given application.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, {{the cost of}} {{providing}} mechanical energy to move trains (locomotive operating costs) amounted to 40-43% of the total operating cost of the railways.

Of the cost of providing this mechanical energy (locomotive operating costs), fuel and power costs amounted to 40-45%.

40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} that a pollution tax with a fixed <b>cost</b> <b>component</b> may lead, by itself, to segregation between clean and dirty firms without heterogeneous preferences or increasing returns. We construct a simple model with two locations and two industries (clean and dirty) where pollution is {{a by-product of}} dirty good manufacturing. Under proper assumptions, a completely stratified configuration with all dirty firms clustering in one city emerges as the only equilibrium outcome {{when there is a}} fixed <b>cost</b> <b>component</b> of the pollution tax. Moreover, a stratified Pareto optimum can never be supported by a competitive spatial equilibrium with a linear pollution tax. To support such a stratified Pareto optimum, however, an effective but unconventional policy prescription is to redistribute the pollution tax revenue from the dirty to the clean city residents. ...|$|R

In a three-phase circuit, the power does not vary between (say) +120 to -120 Volts between two lines, but instead varies between 60 and +120 or -60 and -120V, and the periods of variation are much shorter. Inverters designed to operate on three phase systems require much less storage.

40|$|Regression {{analysis}} was used to determine the ability of a number of biological parameters to predict economic efficiency. Detailed feed, financial, and production records were maintained by a random sample of eighteen Prince Edward Island (PEI) swine producers (each producing over 1000 market hogs per year). Relative economic efficiency of the operations was measured using return to management and labor (RML). Of the routinely monitored biological parameters, RML on PEI farrow-finish operations was best predicted (R 2 = 64. 8 %) by: marketed per square meter per year (p = 0. 008) and marketed per sow per year (p = 0. 096). Regression of fixed costs revealed that biological parameters had limited ability to predict fixed costs per hog on farrow-finish operations (R 2 = 30. 7 %). The only parameter contributing to the prediction of the fixed <b>cost</b> <b>component</b> of RML was feeder hog density (p = 0. 077). The variable <b>cost</b> <b>component</b> of RML on farrow-finish operations was predicted (R 2 = 94. 3 %) by feed cost per kg gain (p = 0. 000), and marketed per sow per year (p = 0. 044). The routinely recorded biological parameters on feeder farms had only limited ability to predict RML in this study (R 2 = 43. 7 %). The only parameter of any importance was marketed per square meter per year (p = 0. 106). Prediction of the fixed <b>cost</b> <b>component</b> of RML on feeder farms (R 2 = 67. 4 %) was best realized by measuring feeder hog density (p = 0. 045). The variable <b>cost</b> <b>component</b> of RML on feeder farms was reasonably well predicted (R 2 = 74. 7 %) by feed cost per kg gain (p = 0. 012). Although this parameter is difficult to monitor from records currently maintained on most farms, it points out the need to monitor feed consumption on swine farms.

50|$|Data centers {{use a lot}} of power, {{consumed}} by two main usages: the power required to run the actual equipment and then the power required to cool the equipment. The first category is addressed by designing computers and storage systems that are increasingly power-efficient. To bring down cooling costs data center designers try to use natural ways to cool the equipment. Many data centers are located near good fiber connectivity, power grid connections and also people-concentrations to manage the equipment, but there are also circumstances where the data center can be miles away from the users and don't need a lot of local management. Examples of this are the 'mass' data centers like Google or Facebook: these DC's are built around many standardized servers and storage-arrays and the actual users of the systems are located all around the world. After the initial build of a data center staff numbers required to keep it running are often relatively low: especially data centers that provide mass-storage or computing power which don't need to be near population centers.Data centers in arctic locations where outside air provides all cooling are getting more popular as cooling and electricity are the two main variable <b>cost</b> <b>components.</b>|$|E
