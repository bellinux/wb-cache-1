2500|$|An {{assignment}} {{for the benefit}} <b>of</b> <b>creditors</b> is a relatively well-established common law tool and is one alternative to a bankruptcy. An {{assignment for}} the benefit <b>of</b> <b>creditors</b> is designed to save time and expense by concluding the affairs of a bankrupt company. The assignment for the benefit <b>of</b> <b>creditors</b> is a state form of bankruptcy action versus a federal form of bankruptcy action. The assignment for the benefit <b>of</b> <b>creditor’s</b> process is similar in character to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy and parallels {{some of the same}} procedures, but is not an actual [...] "bankruptcy" [...] in the form the word is used in the United States.|$|R

50|$|Attachment is a {{legal process}} by which a court of law, at the request <b>of</b> a <b>creditor,</b> designates {{specific}} property owned by the debtor {{to be transferred to}} the creditor, or sold for the benefit <b>of</b> the <b>creditor.</b> A wide variety of legal mechanisms are employed by debtors to prevent the attachment of their assets. For example, a declaration of bankruptcy will severely limit the ability <b>of</b> <b>creditors</b> to attach the property of the debtor. Many jurisdictions have a homestead exemption or other property exemptions which limit the ability <b>of</b> <b>creditors</b> to attach the debtor's primary residence, vehicle, and/or personal effects..|$|R

Sequestration will only be to the advantage <b>of</b> <b>creditors</b> if it will result in a greater dividend to them than would otherwise be the case—for example, through the setting aside of impeachable transactions, or the exposure of concealed assets—or if it will prevent an unfair division of the proceeds of the assets <b>of</b> some <b>creditors</b> being preferred to others.|$|R

Even if the project's value at maturity {{is enough to}} pay all creditors in full, some creditors {{may be tempted to}} foreclose on their loans. We develop a model <b>of</b> <b>creditor</b> coordination where a large creditor moves before a continuum <b>of</b> small <b>creditors,</b> and analyze the signalling effects <b>of</b> the large <b>creditor's</b> investment decision on the subsequent behavior <b>of</b> the small <b>creditors.</b> The signalling effects crucially depend on the relative size <b>of</b> the large <b>creditor</b> and the relative precision of information. We derive conditions under which pure herding behavior is to be expected...|$|R
50|$|Creditors' rights deal {{not only}} with the rights <b>of</b> <b>creditors</b> against the debtor, but also with the rights <b>of</b> <b>creditors</b> against one another. Where {{multiple}} creditors claim a right to levy against a particular piece of property, or against the debtor's accounts in general, the rules governing creditor's rights determine which creditor has the strongest right to any particular relief.|$|R

2500|$|An {{application}} by {{the debtor}} for the sequestration of his estate {{for the benefit}} <b>of</b> <b>creditors</b> is termed a [...] "voluntary surrender" [...] of the estate. A court may accept the surrender if the debtor proves, among other things, that his liabilities exceed his assets. The debtor's aim in surrendering the estate is, as a rule, to escape a financial position which has become intolerable. It has been pointed out, though, that [...] "the machinery of voluntary surrender was primarily designed for the benefit <b>of</b> <b>creditors,</b> {{and not for the}} relief of harassed debtors." [...] The court, therefore, has to be satisfied that the surrender will be to the advantage <b>of</b> <b>creditors.</b>|$|R
