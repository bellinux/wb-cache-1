500|$|As a child, Greenwood {{had found}} a greater spiritual {{connection}} {{with the natural world}} than with organised religion. During the late 1970s, she embraced second-wave feminism and came across feminist forms of Pagan Witchcraft through Starhawk's [...] (1982). Attracted to this new religious movement, she undertook an undergraduate degree in anthropology and sociology at Goldsmiths' College, where her final year research project focused on women's spirituality. Exploring the topic in further depth, she devoted a PhD to the subject, thereby <b>conducting</b> <b>the</b> <b>research</b> underpinning Magic, Witchcraft and the Otherworld.|$|E
2500|$|The Lancet {{was criticized}} after it {{published}} {{a paper in}} 1998 in which the authors suggested {{a link between the}} MMR vaccine and autism. In February 2004, The Lancet published a statement by 10 of the paper's 13 coauthors repudiating the possibility that MMR could cause autism. The editor-in-chief, Richard Horton, went on the record to say the paper had [...] "fatal conflicts of interest" [...] because the study's lead author, Andrew Wakefield, had a serious conflict of interest that he had not declared to The Lancet.

2500|$|The American Psychological Association {{undertook}} {{a study of}} the peer-reviewed literature in the area of sexual orientation change efforts (SOCE) and found a myriad of issues with the procedures used in <b>conducting</b> <b>the</b> <b>research.</b> The taskforce did find that some participants experienced a lessening of same sex attraction and arousal, but that these instances were [...] "rare" [...] and [...] "uncommon". The taskforce concluded that, [...] "given the limited amount of methodically sound research, claims that recent SOCE is effective are not supported". Two issues with SOCE claims are that conversion therapists falsely assume that homosexuality is a mental disorder and that their research focuses almost exclusively on gay men and rarely includes lesbians.|$|E
