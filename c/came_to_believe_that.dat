5|$|Because Montgomery was now {{tied to the}} Livingston family, who {{supported}} the Patriot cause, he began to turn against the British government, seeing himself as an American instead of an Englishman.

5|$|While in Mexico, Cameron began {{performing}} blood rituals in {{the hope}} of communicating with Parsons' spirit; during these, she cut her own wrists. As part of these rituals, she claimed to have received a new magical identity, Hilarion. When she learned that an unidentified flying object had been seen over Washington D.C.'s Capitol Building she considered it a response to Parsons' death. After two months, she returned to California and attempted suicide. Increasingly interested in occultism, she read through her husband's papers. Embracing his Thelemic beliefs, she came to understand his purpose in carrying out the Babalon Working and also <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the spirit of Babalon had been incarnated into herself. She <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Parsons had been murdered by the police or anti-zionists, and continued her attempts at astral projection to commune with his spirit.|$|E
5|$|George Went Hensley (May 2, 1881 – July 25, 1955) was an American Pentecostal {{minister}} {{best known}} for popularizing the practice of snake handling.

5|$|The attempt {{had great}} {{influence}} on Reagan's popularity; polls indicated {{his approval rating}} to be around 73%. Reagan believed that God had spared his life {{so that he might}} go on to fulfill a greater purpose and, although not a Catholic, meetings with Mother Teresa, Cardinal Terence Cooke, and fellow shooting survivor Pope John Paul II reinforced his belief. Agent Parr <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> God had directed his life to save Reagan, and became a pastor.|$|E
5|$|A few early sets {{experimented with}} {{alternate}} art for cards. However, Wizards <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> this impeded easy {{recognition of a}} card and that having multiple versions caused confusion when identifying a card at a glance. Consequently, alternate art is now only used sparingly and mostly for promotional cards. When older cards are reprinted in new sets, however, Wizards of the Coast has guaranteed {{that they will be}} printed with new art to make the older cards more collectible.|$|E
5|$|After Applewhite's release, he {{traveled}} to California and Oregon with Nettles, eventually gaining a group of committed followers. Applewhite and Nettles told their followers {{that they would be}} visited by extraterrestrials who would provide them with new bodies. Applewhite initially stated that he and his followers would physically ascend to a spaceship, where their bodies would be transformed, but later, he <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> their bodies were the mere containers of their souls, which would later be placed into new bodies. These ideas were expressed with language drawn from Christian eschatology, the New Age movement, and American popular culture.|$|E

5|$|After {{crossing}} a bridge, {{they reached the}} gardens {{in front of the}} palace, and Moberly noticed a lady sketching on the grass who looked at them. She later described what she saw in great detail: the lady was wearing a light summer dress, on her head was a shady white hat, and she had lots of fair hair. Moberly thought she was a tourist at first, but the dress appeared to be old-fashioned. Moberly <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the lady was Marie Antoinette. Jourdain, however, did not see the lady.|$|E

On April Fools Day—the date Arkham's family was murdered—Cavendish released the patients and lured Batman to the asylum, believing {{him to be the}} bat Arkham spoke of. Cavendish accuses him of feeding the evil of the asylum by bringing it more insane souls. Batman attempts to convince Cavendish he is sick and needs treatment, but Cavendish responds by attacking him. Batman and Cavendish proceed to struggle, which ends after Adams slashes Cavendish's throat with the razor.|$|E
5|$|After {{spending}} much {{of two years}} at the writer's workshop at the University of Iowa, teaching one course each term, Vonnegut was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship for research in Germany. By the time he won it, in March 1967, he was becoming a well-known writer. He used the funds to travel in Eastern Europe, including to Dresden, where he found many prominent buildings still in ruins. At {{the time of the}} bombing, Vonnegut had not appreciated the sheer scale of destruction in Dresden; his enlightenment came only slowly as information dribbled out, and based on early figures he <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> 135,000 had died there.|$|E

Scotland Yard <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> these men may have been engaged in reconnaissance, either for an abduction or a burglary. There had been a fourfold increase in local burglaries between January and May 2007, including two in the McCanns' block in the 17 days before the disappearance, during which burglars had entered through windows.|$|E
5|$|Over time, Marshall <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Eichelberger's talents were wasted at West Point, but he {{was opposed}} by Pa Watson, who wanted Eichelberger to remain at West Point. When Marshall told Watson that Eichelberger's chances for {{promotion}} to major general were being adversely affected by being denied the chance to command a division, Watson added Eichelberger's name {{to the top of}} a promotion list and had the President sign it. In this manner, Eichelberger was promoted to major general in July 1941.|$|E
5|$|That same year, Gygax was {{diagnosed}} with a potentially deadly abdominal aortic aneurysm. Doctors concurred that surgery was needed, but their estimates of success varied from 50% to 90%. With no firm medical consensus, Gygax <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> he would likely die on the operating table; he refused to consider surgery, although he realized that a rupture of the aneurysm – likely inevitable – would be fatal. In one concession to his condition, he switched from cigarettes, which he had smoked since high school, to cigars.|$|E

5|$|Theistic {{evolution}} was {{the idea}} that God intervened in the process of evolution, to guide {{it in such a way}} that the living world could still be considered to be designed. The term was promoted by Charles Darwin's greatest American advocate Asa Gray. However, this idea gradually fell out of favor among scientists, as they became more and more committed to the idea of methodological naturalism and <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> direct appeals to supernatural involvement were scientifically unproductive. By 1900, theistic evolution had largely disappeared from professional scientific discussions, although it retained a strong popular following.|$|E
5|$|Beilhart {{was born}} in Ohio {{and raised in the}} Lutheran faith. He moved to Kansas when he was 18 and embraced Seventh-day Adventism. He later {{attended}} college to become a licensed preacher. Eventually, Beilhart <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> it was more important to put faith into practice helping others so he left preaching to study nursing and work in a sanitarium. He returned to Ohio in 1899 to start the Spirit Fruit Society, an intentional community based on his experiences, learning, and views. Beilhart led the group for nine years before he died of appendicitis and peritonitis in 1908. Beilhart's commune survived for another 22 years {{making it one of the}} longest surviving communes in America.|$|E
5|$|French fur traders from Canada {{were the}} first Europeans to enter Indiana, {{beginning}} in the 1670s. The quickest route connecting the New France districts of Canada and Louisiana ran along Indiana's Wabash River. The Terre Haute highlands were once considered {{the border between the}} two French districts. This made Indiana a vital part of French lines of communication and trade routes. The French established Vincennes as a permanent settlement in Indiana during European rule, but the population of the area remained primarily Native American. As French influence grew in the region, Great Britain, competing with France for control of North America, <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> control of Indiana was important to halt French expansion on the continent.|$|E

5|$|Madeleine was {{on holiday}} from the UK with her parents, Kate and Gerry McCann, her two-year-old twin siblings, {{and a group}} of family friends and their children. She and the twins had been left asleep at 20:30 in the ground-floor apartment, while the McCanns and friends dined in a {{restaurant}} 55 metres (180ft) away. The parents checked on the children throughout the evening, until Madeleine's mother discovered she was missing at 22:00. Over the following weeks, particularly after misinterpreting a British DNA analysis, the Portuguese police <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Madeleine had died in an accident in the apartment, and that her parents had covered it up. The McCanns were given arguido (suspect) status in September 2007, which was lifted when Portugal's attorney general archived the case in July 2008 {{because of a lack of}} evidence.|$|E
5|$|Much of Keable's fiction {{contained}} autobiographical elements, often centring on his {{attitudes toward}} {{and experience of}} the Christian religious establishment. As well as these fictional explorations he produced a final, non-fiction work, The Great Galilean, outlining the religious views he developed during a lifetime's uneasy relationship to Anglicanism and Catholicism. He <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the historical Jesus bore little relationship to the Jesus of Christian tradition, and, in The Great Galilean, attempted to reconcile his ambivalence about the orthodoxies of the Church with his enduring belief in an all-loving God. Keable's views earned him many unfavourable reviews and the contempt {{of the church in}} which he had practised, but foreshadowed ideas of free love that became prominent later in the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Sihanouk <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> {{communist}} {{triumph in}} Southeast Asia was inevitable and that Cambodia's military {{was incapable of}} defeating the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (North Vietnam), even with U.S. support. If Cambodia (and his rule) was to survive, {{he would have to}} make a bargain with the devil. On 10 April 1965 he broke off diplomatic relations with the U.S. and swung politically to the left. To gain foreign support, both economic and political, Sihanouk turned to the People's Republic of China. One of the terms of the agreement between Sihanouk and Premier Zhou Enlai was that Cambodia would allow the use of its eastern border by the North Vietnamese in their effort to reunify the two Vietnams.|$|E
