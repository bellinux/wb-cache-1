To the north, the IND Eighth Avenue Line enters the Cranberry Street Tunnel and passes under the East River into Manhattan. As a result, {{the station was}} built in a tube design, and built with escalators between the upper fare <b>control</b> <b>level</b> and the lower mezzanine level to easier traverse the 70 foot (21 m) drop below street level.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{regulation}} of de Novo purine nucleotide synthesis by two pentose phosphate enzymes mediated by Akt, a kinase which may be affected by amino acid availability. HeLa cells starved of lysine for three hours show up to a 66 % decrease in de Novo purine synthesis rates compared to <b>control</b> <b>levels.</b> A 40 % reduction in PRPP availability after lysine starvation, the product of non-oxidative PPP and precursor substrate to the first committed step in de Novo synthesis, most likely contributes to this overall reduction in purine synthesis. Akt activation, as well as lysine return for one hour, almost completely restores de Novo synthesis rates to <b>control</b> <b>levels.</b> TKT and TAL, enzymes unique to the PPP, show enzyme activity levels 57 % and 49 % of <b>control</b> <b>levels</b> during lysine starvation respectively, but can be restored to <b>control</b> <b>levels</b> upon Akt activation or lysine return. Cells expressing vectors of kinase-dead, dominant negative Akt fail to restore enzyme activity <b>levels</b> to <b>control</b> <b>levels</b> after lysine return. This strongly suggests that lysine starvation-induced reduction in Akt activity mediates TKT and TAL activity levels, thereby regulating de Novo purine nucleotide synthesi...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{controlled}} drainage (CD) on ammonia volatilization (AV) losses from paddy fields under controlled irrigation (CI) was investigated by managing water table <b>control</b> <b>levels</b> using a lysimeter. Three drainage treatments were implemented, namely, controlled water table depth 1 (CWT 1), controlled water table depth 2 (CWT 2), and controlled water table depth 3 (CWT 3). As {{the water table}} <b>control</b> <b>levels</b> increased, irrigation water volumes in the CI paddy fields decreased. AV losses from paddy fields reduced due to the increases in water table <b>control</b> <b>levels.</b> Seasonal AV losses from CWT 1, CWT 2, and CWT 3 were 59. 8, 56. 7, and 53. 0 [*]kg[*]N[*]ha− 1, respectively. AV losses from CWT 3 were 13. 1 % and 8. 4 % lower than those from CWT 1 and CWT 2, respectively. A {{significant difference in the}} seasonal AV losses was confirmed between CWT 1 and CWT 3. Less weekly AV losses followed by TF and PF were also observed as the water table <b>control</b> <b>levels</b> increased. The application of CD by increasing water table <b>control</b> <b>levels</b> to a suitable level could effectively reduce irrigation water volumes and AV losses from CI paddy fields.
