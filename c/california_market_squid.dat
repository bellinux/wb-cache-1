40|$|I {{developed}} two conceptual models addressing fishery {{questions in}} the Monterey Bay motivated by 1) the <b>California</b> <b>Market</b> <b>Squid</b> (Loligo opalescens) and 2) marine reserves as a recovery and management tool. The model for <b>California</b> <b>Market</b> <b>Squid</b> incorporates the close ties between environmental variability and squid life history. Inclusion of environmental factors in the model provides a biological mechanism contributing to the large fluctuations {{that occur in the}} fishery. Furthermore, I predict that removal of 30 % of the unspawned SSB may drive the population to extinction within 30 generations. Reserves are generally agreed to be good for habitat and ecosystem conservation; however, specific measures of success, such as increases in yield or size at age have been difficult to generalize across reserves. I identify density dependent body growth and displaced fishing effort as potential explanations for the variable outcomes. I predict that density dependent body growth will reduce length at age inside reserves, even if mean length in the reserve increases. I also predict that although reserves increase yield, nothing maximizes yield as well as conservative fishing practices, and that displaced fishing effort decreases benefits of reserves, indicating the need to reduce effort, as well as create reserves...|$|E
40|$|Why do animal populations {{boom and}} bust? This {{is the central}} {{question}} of population biology. <b>Market</b> <b>squid</b> (Doryteuthis opalescens) are an excellent study species for this question as they are fast growing, semelparous, and short-lived. Their rapid population growth allows them to support the largest fishery in California. However the population exhibits dramatic swings in abundance, periodically resulting in the complete collapse of the fishery. Despite their importance, relatively {{little is known about}} the drivers of their abundance. Here, I combine laboratory experiments, field observations, and novel statistical techniques to better understand what causes <b>market</b> <b>squid</b> to boom and bust. In the first half of my thesis, I perform a simulation study and find that nonparametric time series methods are particularly useful for understanding the dynamics of short-lived species such as <b>market</b> <b>squid.</b> Indeed, for short-lived, highly productive species, I find that parameter estimates of traditional mechanistic models may be severely biased when calibrated using conventional statistical techniques. Further, I perform a meta-analysis of the Ransom A. Meyers global stock-recruitment database and find that simple time series methods are able to uncover broad patterns of determinism in fish recruitment, thus validating their usefulness for understanding ecological dynamics. In the second half of my thesis, I combine these time series methods with laboratory and field observations to uncover the drivers of <b>market</b> <b>squid</b> abundance. In a mesocosm experiment, I obtain the first empirical estimates of the mortality rate and egg-deposition rate of spawning <b>market</b> <b>squid.</b> I also obtain unique insights into the life-history and vulnerability of spawning <b>market</b> <b>squid.</b> I then combine these insights with a study of <b>market</b> <b>squid</b> paralarvae collected in the 60 -year CalCOFI program which includes a time series analysis, a growth analysis, and a size- distribution analysis. The time series analysis shows that variables acting on the juvenile and adult stage (but not the paralarval stage) are critical for forecasting future squid abundance. In agreement with this, the growth analysis shows that paralarvae grow quite well in the "bad" years of El Nino. Finally, the size-distribution analysis shows that paralarvae mortality is actually elevated during the "good'' years of La Nina, again indicating that the paralarvae stage is not the population bottleneck. This suggests, in contrast to conventional expectations, that the juvenile and adult stage are in fact the critical stages for determining population abundance. I conclude with a discussion of the research approach implemented her...|$|R

40|$|The <b>California</b> <b>market</b> <b>squid</b> (Loligo opalescens Berry), {{also known}} as the {{opalescent}} inshore squid (FAO), plays {{a central role in the}} nearshore ecological communities of the west coast of the United States (Morejohn et al., 1978; Hixon, 1983) and it is also a prime focus of California fisheries, ranking first in dollar value and tons landed in recent years (Vojkovich, 1998). The life span of this species is only 7 − 10 months after hatching, as ascertained by aging statoliths (Butler et al., 1999; Jackson, 1994; Jackson and Domier, 2003) and mariculture trials (Yang, et al., 1986). Thus, annual recruitment is required to sustain the population. The spawning season ranges from April to November and spawning peaks from May to June. In some years there can be a smaller second peak in November. In Monterey Bay, the squids are fished directly on the egg beds, and the consequences of this practice for conservation and fisheries management are unknown but of some concern (Hanlon, 1998). Beginning in April 2000, we began a study of the in situ spawning behavior of L. opalescens in the southern Monterey Bay fishing area...|$|E
40|$|The <b>California</b> <b>market</b> <b>squid</b> (Loligo opalescens) {{has been}} {{harvested}} since the 1860 s {{and it has}} become the largest fishery in California in terms of tonnage and dollars since 1993. The fishery began in Monterey Bay and then shifted to southern California, where effort has increased steadily since 1983. The California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) collects information on landings of squid, including tonnage, location, and date of capture. We compared landings data gathered by CDFG with sea surface temperature (SST), upwelling index (UI), the southern oscillation index (SOI), and their respective anomalies. We found that the squid fishery in Monterey Bay expends twice the effort of that in southern California. Squid landings decreased substantially following large El Niño events in 1982 − 83 and 1997 − 98, but not following the smaller El Niño events of 1987 and 1992. Spectral analysis revealed autocorrelation at annual and 4. 5 -year intervals (similar to the time period between El Niño cycles). But this analysis did not reveal any fortnightly or monthly spawning peaks, thus squid spawning did not correlate with tides. A paralarvae density index (PDI) for February correlated well with catch per unit of effort (CPUE) for the following November recruitment of adults to the spawning grounds. This stock– recruitment analysis was significant for 2000 − 03 (CPUE= 8. 42 + 0. 41 PDI, adjusted coefficient of determination, r 2 = 0. 978, P= 0. 0074). Surveys of squid paralarvae explained 97. 8 % of the variance for catches of adult squid nine months later. The regression of CPUE on PDI could be used to manage the fishery. Catch limits for the fishery could be set on the basis of paralarvae abundance surveyed nine months earlier...|$|E

40|$|In the California Current {{upwelling}} system, long-term {{trends in}} ocean warming, stratification, deoxygenation, and ocean acidification {{are already being}} observed, including a shoaling of the hypoxic boundary {{and a decrease in}} calcium carbonate saturation state. The <b>California</b> <b>market</b> <b>squid,</b> Doryteuthis opalescens, is a primary forage species for fish, sharks, mammals, and seabirds in the California Current, and one of California's largest fisheries. As D. opalescens embryos are attached to the seafloor and must survive strong fluctuations in environmental conditions over development, this species may be resilient to changes in pH and oxygen and represents an ideal opportunity to investigate mechanisms of resilience to climate change in highly dynamic environments. This dissertation combines genome-wide gene expression (RNA-Seq) with hatching survival to assess the physiological response of D. opalescens embryos to low pH and low oxygen conditions and investigate potential effects of these conditions on reproductive output of the population. Chapter 2 focused on developing a high-quality, comprehensive set of expressed transcripts (‘transcriptome’) to form the basis for all downstream analyses. This chapter culminated in the development of an open-source, automated, best-practices transcriptome analysis pipeline to conduct transcriptome analyses, quality assessment, annotation, and expression analyses in a single step, available online. Chapter 3 leveraged this transcriptome to investigate the effects of low pH and low oxygen on squid development. Embryos were reared in replicate seawater tanks of ambient (control; 240 µmol/kg O 2, pH 7. 95) and low-pH, low-O 2 (low pHOx; 90 µmol/kg O 2, pH 7. 55) until hatching. These conditions represent the limits of pHOx observed in squid spawning habitat. Embryos exposed to low pHOx conditions experienced a 11. 8 % increase in development time, a 4. 3 % decrease in hatching success, and significantly altered gene expression of stress response, oxygen sensitive genes, as well as transcription factors known to be implicated in environmental control of developmental timing. Due to the observed increase in developmental time in response to low pHOx conditions, Chapter 4 focused on pathway-directed characterization of developmental biomarkers in D. opalescens. The expression patterns identified in this chapter lay the groundwork for enhanced understanding of developmental dynamics and resilience in this tolerant, economically important invertebrate...|$|E

40|$|<b>Market</b> <b>squid</b> (Loligo opalescens) plays a {{vital role}} in the California {{ecosystem}} and serves as a major link in the food chain as both a predator and prey species. For over a century, <b>market</b> <b>squid</b> has also been harvested off the California coast from Monterey to San Pedro. Expanding global markets, coupled with a decline in squid product {{from other parts of the}} world, in recent years has fueled rapid expansion of the virtually unregulated California fishery. Lack of regulatory management, in combination with dramatic increases in fishing effort and landings, has raised numerous concerns from the scientific, fishing, and regulatory communities. In an effort to address these concerns, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary (CINMS) hosted a panel discussion at the October 1997 California Cooperative Oceanic and Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) Conference; it focused on ecosystem management implications for the burgeoning <b>market</b> <b>squid</b> fishery. Both panel and audience members addressed issues such as: the direct and indirect effects of commercial harvesting upon squid biomass; the effects of harvest and the role of squid in the broader marine community; the effects of environmental variation on squid population dynamics; the sustainability of the fishery from the point of view of both scientists and the fishers themselves; and the conservation management options for what is currently an open access and unregulated fishery. Herein are the key points of the ecosystem management panel discussion in the form of a preface, an executive summary, and transcript. (PDF contains 33 pages. ...|$|R
