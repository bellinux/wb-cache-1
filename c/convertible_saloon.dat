5000|$|Three {{models were}} {{produced}}. Model A and B {{shared the same}} body, only the engine of model B had 16 hp, vs. 13 hp of Model A. Model A was produced from 1937 to 1948, while B was produced in 1948 and 1949. Model A was offered as a 2-door saloon, 2-door <b>convertible</b> <b>saloon</b> (saloon with folding roof) and a 2-door van, while Model B also introduced a 3-door estate under the name 500 B Giardinetta ("estate car"). Model C was introduced in 1949 with a restyled body and the same engine as Model B, and was offered in 2-door saloon, 2-door <b>convertible</b> <b>saloon,</b> 3-door estate and 2-door van [...] versions. In 1952, Giardinetta was renamed Belvedere ("A turret or other raised structure offering a pleasant view of the surrounding area", referring to its sunroof). Model C was produced until 1955.|$|E
5000|$|Exterior styling {{recalled}} the 1935 Fiat 1500 and the 1936 Fiat 500 [...] "Topolino", with the typical mid-thirties heart-shaped front grille.The main body style for the Fiat 508 C was a 4-door pillarless saloon with 4 side windows (two windows {{on each side}} without the rear quarter window), and suicide doors at the rear. Other body styles listed by Fiat were a 4-door <b>convertible</b> <b>saloon</b> (saloon with folding roof, based on the standard 4-door model), a 4-door torpedo, a 2-door 4-seat cabriolet, and, for a brief period, a sporty 2-door 2-seat spider built by Carrozzeria Viotti.|$|E
50|$|On top of {{the normal}} and {{roadster}} cars, 12 special cars were developed on an extended chassis length with a 3880 mm wheelbase. All of these cars were developed for the Nazi hierarchy, as six seater <b>convertible</b> <b>saloons.</b> To allow for armour plate, these cars had developed De Dion rear suspension. Due to their higher weight, their maximum speed was 140 km/h.|$|R
50|$|Initially {{available}} as a coupé only, BMW introduced M3 <b>convertible</b> and <b>saloon</b> versions in 1994, {{the absence of any}} M5 models in the BMW line-up between the end of E34 M5 production in 1995 and the launch of the E39 M5 in 1998 prompted the introduction of the 4-door Motorsport model.|$|R
50|$|Current compact car size, {{as defined}} by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), for the US and for {{international}} models respectively, is approximately 4100 mm and 4450 mm long for hatchbacks, or 4400 mm and 4750 mm long for <b>convertibles,</b> sedans (<b>saloon)</b> or station wagons (estate car). Multi-purpose vehicles and sport utility vehicles based on small family cars (often called compact MPVs and compact SUVs) have similar sizes, ranging from 4200 mm to 4500 mm in the U.S., and from 4400 mm to 4700 mm in international-based models.|$|R
5000|$|In 1939 the car {{underwent}} a restyling {{of the front}} end and became the Fiat 1100, also inappropriately known as 1100 A to distinguish from the later variants. The car had gained a taller, pointed grille—which earned it the popular nickname of 1100 musone, i. e. [...] "big muzzle"—with horizontal chrome bars, the top three extending back over window-shaped louvres {{on each side of}} the redesigned engine bonnet. Available body styles were six, all carried over from the previous model: saloon, <b>convertible</b> <b>saloon,</b> cabriolet, sports berlinetta, long-wheelbase saloon and taxi. No significant changes were made to the car's mechanicals.|$|E
5000|$|The two door Interceptor first {{appeared}} as a convertible bodied in a mix of aluminium and steel on a wood frame. The entire front section hinged forwards to give access to the engine. The wrap around rear window was made of rigid plastic (Perspex) and was arranged to drop down into a well for stowage when the top was lowered. In 1952 a hardtop version with fabric-covered roof was launched and a few sedanca version were also made. Total production was 32 <b>convertibles,</b> 52 <b>saloons</b> and 4 sedancas.|$|R
50|$|The Triumph Herald {{is a small}} two-door car {{introduced}} by the Standard-Triumph Company of Coventry in 1959 and made through to 1971. Body design was by the Italian stylist Giovanni Michelotti, and the car was offered in <b>saloon,</b> <b>convertible,</b> coupé, estate and van models, with the latter marketed as the Triumph Courier.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the saloon, a number of special bodied Appias were produced, including a coupé by Pininfarina, a <b>convertible</b> and 2-door <b>saloon</b> by Vignale and an aluminium-bodied GT by Zagato, as well as light commercial vehicle variants.In all 107,000 Appia were built: 98,000 saloons, 3,863 commercial vehicles, and 5,161 chassis supplied to coachbuilders.|$|R
50|$|The 3000 sports {{convertible}} Mark II {{was launched}} {{at the end}} of August 1962. It was a true <b>convertible</b> with almost <b>saloon</b> car comfort, a new wrap-around windscreen, wind-up side windows, swivelling quarter lights and a quick-action folding roof. Twin SU HS6 carburettors replaced the triple SUs. Austin-Healey claimed it could exceed 115 mph.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Evolution" [...] model (also called [...] "EVO2") {{produced}} up to [...] Other Evolution {{model changes}} included larger wheels (16 X 7.5 inches), thinner rear and side window glass, a lighter bootlid, a deeper front splitter and additional rear spoiler. It was only available in coupe and <b>convertible</b> bodies; no <b>saloon</b> option was available.|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of E36 M3s were produced at the Regensburg factory; however, {{a small number}} of low compression right hand drive M3s were assembled at BMW's Rosslyn plant in Pretoria, South Africa. In total, 46,525 coupés, 12,114 <b>convertibles</b> and 12,603 <b>saloons</b> were produced. The saloon ceased production in December 1997, the coupé ceased production in late 1998, and the convertible ceased production in December 1999.|$|R
50|$|An estate {{version was}} {{introduced}} in 1952, known as the Traveller (a Morris naming tradition for estates, also seen on the Mini). The Traveller featured an external structural ash (wood) frame for the rear bodywork, with two side-hinged rear doors. The frame was varnished rather than painted and a highly visible feature of the body style. Travellers were built alongside the saloon model at Cowley minus their rear bodies. The half-completed cars were then shipped to the MG factory at Abingdon where the bodies (built in Coventry) would be mated to the chassis and the final assembly carried out. This was because the main Cowley production lines were no longer fully {{equipped to deal with}} body-on-frame vehicles such as the Traveller while the MG lines still handled these sorts of cars and had experience working with wood-framed bodies. Commercial models, marketed as the Morris Quarter Ton Van and Pick-up were added in May 1953. Rear bodies of the van versions were all steel. The 4-seat <b>convertible</b> and <b>saloon</b> variants continued as well.|$|R
5000|$|The first (or [...] "Mark 1") Hillman Husky, {{introduced}} in 1954, {{was a small}} estate based on the contemporary [...] "Mark VIII" [...] Hillman Minx. The two-door Husky entered the range alongside an existing Minx estate car, which had a 9 in longer wheelbase. The Husky was not a hatchback, having instead a single side-hinged rear door. While the new Mark VIII Minx DeLuxe <b>saloon,</b> <b>convertible</b> and [...] "Californian" [...] hardtop used a new OHV 1390 cc engine, the Husky continued to use the older 1265 cc [...] sidevalve engine with single Zenith carburettor which it shared with the Minx [...] "Special" [...] saloon and estate. Unlike the Minx with its column change, the gear lever for the Husky was floor mounted.|$|R

5000|$|In October 1967 {{the range}} was updated with the {{introduction}} at the London Motor Show of the Herald 13/60. The 13/60 was offered in <b>saloon,</b> <b>convertible</b> and estate-bodied versions. The sun-roof remained available for the saloon as an optional extra rather than a standard feature. The front end was restyled using a bonnet similar to the Triumph Vitesse's and the interior substantially revised though still featuring the wooden dashboard. Interior space was improved by recessing a rear armrest in each side panel. The engine was enlarged to 1296 cc, essentially the unit employed since 1965 in the Triumph 1300, fitted with a Stromberg CD150 carburettor, offering [...] and much improved performance. In this form (though the 1200 saloon was sold alongside it {{until the end of}} 1970) the Herald Saloon lasted until December 1970 and the Convertible and Estate until May 1971, by which time, severely outdated in style if not performance, it had already outlived the introduction of the Triumph 1300 Saloon, the car designed to replace it and was still selling reasonably well but, because of its labour-intensive method of construction, selling at a loss.|$|R
5000|$|Standard-Triumph fitted a 1596 cc {{version of}} their {{traditional}} straight-6 derived from the engine used in the Standard Vanguard Six, but with a smaller bore diameter of 66.75 mm, compared with the 74.7 mm bore on the Vanguard, equipped with twin Solex B32PIH semi-downdraught carburettors These were soon replaced by B321H carburettors, as the accelerator pumps proved a problem. The curious observer will notice a [...] "seam" [...] on the cylinder block between the third & fourth cylinders revealing the humble design beginnings from the 803 cc Standard 8 block of 1953. The gearbox was strengthened and upgraded to much closer (more sporting) gear ratios, and also offered with optional Laycock De Normanville 'D-type' overdrive that offered a top gear with a 20% higher ratio (the equivalent change from 3rd to 4th in a standard box), giving more relaxed and economical cruising {{at the expense of}} slight oil drag from the pump in the overdrive unit. The rear axle was changed to a slightly uprated differential, but retaining the same 4.11:1 ratio. Front disc brakes were standard as were larger rear brake drums, and the Herald fuel tank was enlarged, retaining the handy reserve feature (essentially a curved pickup pipe that could be rotated to dip into the last few centimetres of fuel) of the smaller Herald tank. The front suspension featured uprated springs to cope with the extra weight of the new engine, but the rear suspension was basically standard Herald—a swing-axle transverse-leaf system which quickly proved inadequate for the relatively powerful Vitesse. The chassis looked similar to the early Heralds but in fact was substantially re-designed and strengthened, especially around the differential mountings (and these improvements were immediately passed through to Herald production). The Vitesse was available in <b>convertible</b> and <b>saloon</b> forms; a coupé never got beyond the prototype stage.A handful of Vitesse estates also were assembled to special order at Standard-Triumph's Service Depot at Park Royal in West London.|$|R
