5|$|The {{species was}} {{originally}} described in 1805 as Lycoperdon <b>corium</b> {{in the second}} volume of Augustin Pyramus de Candolle and Jean-Baptiste Lamarck's Flore Française. They attributed authorship to French botanist Louis Ben Guersent, who discovered it in an alfalfa field between the town of La Sotte and Rouen in northern France. Synonyms include Scleroderma <b>corium</b> published by Arthur Harmount Graves in 1830, and Steerbekia <b>corium</b> published by Elias Magnus Fries in 1849. The species was given its current name by Nicaise Auguste Desvaux in 1842, who circumscribed the genus Mycenastrum to contain it. Generic synonyms are Vassiliĭ Matveievitch Czernajew's 1845 Endonevrum and Stephan Schulzer von Müggenburg's 1876 Pachyderma.|$|E
5|$|María Homrich & Jorge E. Wright {{published}} the variety Mycenastrum <b>corium</b> var. diabolicum in 1973 from South America. M.corium subspecies ferrugineum {{was described in}} 2005 from Jefferson County, Colorado, by Orson K. Miller.|$|E
5|$|Mycenastrum <b>corium</b> subsp. ferrugineum {{has a deep}} rusty red to {{reddish orange}} gleba, clearly {{distinguishing}} it from the glebal coloring of the main subspecies. M.corium var. diabolicum has an extremely spiny capillitium.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} thick outer peridium, Mycenastrum <b>corium</b> puffballs can {{withstand}} hard blows without breaking, and children have used them as replacements for balls. The puffballs {{have also been}} used medicinally in Mexico as a hemostatic, as a throat and lung tonic, and for their purported anti-inflammatory properties.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{external}} appearance, Plectania nannfeldtii {{is similar to}} Pseudoplectania vogesiaca. Although this latter species {{may be difficult to}} distinguish by its less hairy external fruit body surface, its microscopic characters identify it more definitively: P.vogesiaca has spores that are much smaller, typically with widths of 12–14µm. Helvella <b>corium</b> is another black cup fungus that appears in the spring; it has smaller spores, whitish margins on the cup edges, and shorter stems than P.nannfeldtii. Pseudoplectania nigrella is smaller, with a hairier outer surface, a darker inner cup surface, and a rudimentary stem.|$|E
5|$|In 1948, Sanford Myron Zeller {{circumscribed}} the {{new family}} Mycenastraceae, containing both Mycenastrum as the type genus, and Bovista. A 2001 molecular study supported {{the inclusion of}} Mycenastrum <b>corium</b> in the Lycoperdales, where it was traditionally placed. In a more recent (2008) cladistic analysis, Mycenastrum was {{shown to be a}} sister group to the Lycoperdaceae; authors Larsson and Jeppson agreed with Zeller (1949) and Pilat's (1958) decision to regard Mycenastrium as a monotypic genus in the separate family Mycenastraceae. Despite this, several taxonomic authorities prefer to fold Mycenastraceae into the Agaricaceae.|$|E
5|$|The puffball {{is widely}} distributed, {{and has been}} {{recorded}} in Africa (Zimbabwe), Asia (China, India, Iran, Mongolia, and Yemen), South America (Argentina, Chile and Uruguay), North America, Australia, and New Zealand. In Europe it is found in southern Scandinavia and is widespread {{to the south of}} the continent. Although it was reported in Scotland in 2010 (its first appearance on the British mainland), the grassland habitat where it was found has since become heavily eroded, and may be unsuitable for future appearances of the species. Mycenastrum <b>corium</b> is a threatened species in Europe, and is listed as vulnerable in the Regional Red List of Poland. In North America, it is most common in western regions of the United States and Canada, but it has also been recorded in eastern Canada. Poorly known in Mexico, it has been recorded from Baja California, Chihuahua, Nuevo León, San Luis Potosi, Sonora, Mexico City. The variety M.corium var. diabolicum occurs in Sub-Saharan Africa, tropical Asia, the Caribbean, and South America.|$|E
5|$|The hoof of {{the horse}} {{contains}} over a dozen different structures, including bones, cartilage, tendons and tissues. The coffin or pedal bone is the major hoof bone, supporting {{the majority of the}} weight. Under the coffin bone is the navicular bone, itself cushioned by the navicular bursa, a fluid-filled sac. The digital cushion is a blood vessel-filled structure located {{in the middle of the}} hoof, which assists with blood flow throughout the leg. At the top of the hoof wall is the <b>corium,</b> tissue which continually produces the horn of the outer hoof shell, which is in turn protected by the periople, a thin outer layer which prevents the interior structures from drying out. The wall is connected to the coffin bone by sensitive laminae, a flexible layer which helps to suspend and protect the coffin bone. The main tendon in the hoof is the deep digital flexor tendon, which connects to the bottom of the coffin bone. The impact zone on the bottom of the hoof includes the sole, which has an outer, insensitive layer and a sensitive inner layer, and the frog, which lies between the heels and assists in shock absorption and blood flow. The final structures are the lateral cartilages, connected to the upper coffin bone, which act as the flexible heels, allowing hoof expansion. These structures allow the hoof to perform many functions. It acts as a support and traction point, shock absorber and system for pumping blood back through the lower limb.|$|E
25|$|The {{temperature}} of <b>corium</b> {{depends on its}} internal heat generation dynamics: the quantities and types of isotopes producing decay heat, dilution by other molten materials, heat losses modified by the <b>corium</b> physical configuration, and heat losses to the environment. A compact <b>corium</b> mass will lose less heat than a thinly spread layer. <b>Corium</b> of sufficient temperature can melt concrete. A solidified mass of <b>corium</b> can remelt if its heat losses drop, by being covered with heat insulating debris, or if water that is cooling the <b>corium</b> evaporates.|$|E
25|$|Crust {{can form}} on the <b>corium</b> mass, acting as a thermal {{insulator}} and hindering thermal losses. Heat distribution throughout the <b>corium</b> mass is influenced by different thermal conductivity between the molten oxides and metals. Convection in the liquid phase significantly increases heat transfer.|$|E
25|$|In {{the absence}} of {{adequate}} cooling, the materials inside of the reactor vessel overheat and deform as they undergo thermal expansion, and the reactor structure fails once the temperature reaches the melting point of its structural materials. The <b>corium</b> melt then accumulates {{at the bottom of}} the reactor vessel. In the case of adequate cooling of the <b>corium</b> melt, the melt can solidify and the spread of damage is limited to the reactor itself. However, <b>corium</b> may melt through the reactor vessel and flow out or be ejected as a molten stream by the pressure inside the reactor vessel. The reactor vessel failure may be caused by heating of its vessel bottom by the <b>corium</b> melt, resulting first in creep failure and then in breach of the vessel. Cooling water from above the <b>corium</b> layer, in sufficient quantity, may obtain a thermal equilibrium below the metal creep temperature, without reactor vessel failure.|$|E
25|$|However the {{dynamics}} of the movement of <b>corium</b> in and outside the reactor vessel is highly complex, and the number of possible scenarios is wide; slow drip of melt into an underlying water pool can result in complete quenching, while the fast contact of a large mass of <b>corium</b> with water may result in a destructive steam explosion. <b>Corium</b> may be completely retained by the reactor vessel, or the reactor floor or some of the instrument penetration holes can be melted through.|$|E
25|$|The <b>corium</b> {{was formed}} in three phases.|$|E
25|$|The {{temperature}} of <b>corium</b> {{can be as}} high as 2400°C (4,352 °F) in the first hours after the meltdown, potentially reaching over 2800°C (5,072 °F). A large amount of heat can be released by reaction of metals (particularly zirconium) in <b>corium</b> with water. Flooding of the <b>corium</b> mass with water, or the drop of molten <b>corium</b> mass into a water pool, may result in a temperature spike and production of large amounts of hydrogen, which can result in a pressure spike in the containment vessel. The steam explosion resulting from such sudden corium-water contact can disperse the materials and form projectiles that may damage the containment vessel by impact. Subsequent pressure spikes can be caused by combustion of the released hydrogen. Detonation risks can be reduced by the use of catalytic hydrogen recombiners.|$|E
25|$|The Chernobyl <b>corium</b> is {{composed}} of the reactor uranium dioxide fuel, its zircaloy cladding, molten concrete, and decomposed and molten serpentinite packed around the reactor as its thermal insulation. Analysis {{has shown that the}} <b>corium</b> was heated to at most 2255°C, and remained above 1660°C for at least 4 days.|$|E
25|$|During the Three Mile Island accident, slow partial {{meltdown}} of {{the reactor}} core occurred. About 19,000kg of material melted and relocated in about 2 minutes, approximately 224 {{minutes after the}} reactor scram. A pool of <b>corium</b> formed {{at the bottom of}} the reactor vessel, but the reactor vessel was not breached. The layer of solidified <b>corium</b> ranged in thickness from 5 to 45cm.|$|E
25|$|Materials {{based on}} {{titanium}} dioxide and neodymium(III) oxide {{seem to be}} more resistant to <b>corium</b> than concrete.|$|E
25|$|The <b>corium</b> {{undergoes}} degradation. The Elephant's Foot, {{hard and}} strong shortly after its formation, is now cracked enough that a glue-treated wad easily separated its top 1–2 centimeter layer. The structure's shape itself is changed as the material slides down and settles. The <b>corium</b> temperature is now just slightly different from ambient, {{the material is}} therefore subject to both day-night temperature cycling and weathering by water. The heterogeneous nature of <b>corium</b> and different thermal expansion coefficients of the components causes material deterioration with thermal cycling. Large amounts of residual stresses were introduced during solidification due to the uncontrolled cooling rate. The water, seeping into pores and microcracks and freezing there, the same process that creates potholes on roads, accelerates cracking.|$|E
25|$|Several {{reactions}} {{occur between}} {{the concrete and}} the <b>corium</b> melt. Free and chemically bound water is released from the concrete as steam. Calcium carbonate is decomposed, producing carbon dioxide and calcium oxide. Water and carbon dioxide penetrate the <b>corium</b> mass, exothermically oxidizing the non-oxidized metals present in the <b>corium</b> and producing gaseous hydrogen and carbon monoxide; large amounts of hydrogen can be produced. The calcium oxide, silica, and silicates melt and are mixed into the <b>corium.</b> The oxide phase, in which the nonvolatile fission products are concentrated, can stabilize at temperatures of 1300–1500°C for a considerable period of time. An eventually present layer of more dense molten metal, containing fewer radioisotopes (Ru, Tc, Pd, etc., initially composed of molten zircaloy, iron, chromium, nickel, manganese, silver, and other construction materials and metallic fission products and tellurium bound as zirconium telluride) than the oxide layer (which concentrates Sr, Ba, La, Sb, Sn, Nb, Mo, etc. and is initially composed primarily of zirconium dioxide and uranium dioxide, possibly with iron oxide and boron oxides), can form an interface between the oxides and the concrete farther below, slowing down the <b>corium</b> penetration and solidifying within a few hours. The oxide layer produces heat primarily by decay heat, while the principal heat source in the metal layer is exothermic reaction with the water released from the concrete. Decomposition of concrete and volatilization of the alkali metal compounds consumes {{a substantial amount of}} heat.|$|E
25|$|Deposition of <b>corium</b> on the {{containment}} vessel inner surface, e.g. by high-pressure ejection from the reactor pressure vessel, can cause containment failure by direct containment heating (DCH).|$|E
25|$|<b>Corium</b> (also called fuel {{containing}} material (FCM) or lava-like fuel containing material (LFCM)) is {{the name}} for the lava-like mixture of fissile material created in a nuclear reactor's core during a nuclear meltdown.|$|E
25|$|Slag-like {{granulated}} <b>corium,</b> slag-like irregular gray-magenta to dark-brown glassy granules with crust. Formed by prolonged contact {{of brown}} ceramics with water, located in large heaps in both {{levels of the}} Pressure Suppression Pool.|$|E
25|$|Black ceramics, a glass-like coal-black {{material}} with a surface pitted with many cavities and pores. Usually {{located near the}} places where <b>corium</b> formed. Its two versions contain about 4–5 wt.% and about 7–8 wt.% of uranium.|$|E
25|$|Samples were {{obtained}} from the reactor. Two masses of <b>corium</b> were found, one within the fuel assembly, one on the lower head of the reactor vessel. The samples were generally dull grey, with some yellow areas.|$|E
25|$|In 1985, a {{television}} camera {{was used to}} see {{the interior of the}} damaged reactor. In 1986, core samples and samples of debris were obtained from the <b>corium</b> layers {{on the bottom of the}} reactor vessel and analyzed.|$|E
25|$|The {{composition}} of <b>corium</b> {{depends on the}} design type of the reactor, and specifically on the materials used in the control rods, coolant and reactor vessel structural materials. There are differences between pressurized water reactor (PWR) and boiling water reactor (BWR) coriums.|$|E
25|$|The {{thermal load}} of <b>corium</b> {{on the floor}} below the reactor vessel can be {{assessed}} by a grid of fiber optic sensors embedded in the concrete. Pure silica fibers are needed as they are more resistant to high radiation levels.|$|E
25|$|Pumice, friable pumice-like gray-brown porous {{formations}} {{formed from}} molten brown <b>corium</b> foamed with steam when immersed in water. Located in the {{pressure suppression pool}} in large heaps near the sink openings, where they were carried by water flow as they were light enough to float.|$|E
25|$|The molten <b>corium</b> {{settled in}} the bottom of the reactor shaft, forming a layer of {{graphite}} debris on its top. Eight days after the meltdown the melt penetrated the lower biological shield and spread on the reactor room floor, releasing radionuclides. Further radioactivity was released when the melt came in contact with water.|$|E
25|$|The {{water line}} is built {{up by the}} coronet and by the wall's <b>corium</b> (the living tissue {{immediately}} beneath the walls). Its thickness increases proportionally to {{the distance from the}} coronet and, in the lower third of the walls, is thicker than the pigmented layer. It is very resistant to contact to the ground, and it serves mainly a support function.|$|E
25|$|Brief re-criticality (resumption of neutron-induced fission) {{in parts}} of the <b>corium</b> is a {{theoretical}} but remote possibility with commercial reactor fuel, due to low enrichment and the loss of moderator. This condition could be detected by presence of short life fission products long after the meltdown, in amounts that are too high to remain from the pre-meltdown reactor or be due to spontaneous fission of reactor-created actinides.|$|E
25|$|The fast erosion {{phase of}} the {{concrete}} basemat lasts {{for about an hour}} and progresses to about one meter in depth, then slows to several centimeters per hour, and stops completely when the melt cools below the decomposition temperature of concrete (about 1100°C). Complete melt-through can occur in several days even through several meters of concrete; the <b>corium</b> then penetrates several meters into the underlying soil, spreads around, cools and solidifies.|$|E
25|$|During the {{interaction}} between <b>corium</b> and concrete, very high temperatures can be achieved. Less volatile aerosols of Ba, Ce, La, Sr, and other fission products are formed during this phase and introduced into the containment building {{at a time when}} most of the early aerosols are already deposited. Tellurium is released with the progress of zirconium telluride decomposition. Bubbles of gas flowing through the melt promote aerosol formation.|$|E
25|$|Coinciding {{with the}} well {{understood}} {{implications of a}} loss of coolant accident, the insufficient cooling eventually led to meltdowns in Reactors 1, 2, and 3. The {{full extent of the}} movement of the resulting <b>corium</b> is unknown but it is now considered to be at least through the bottom of each reactor pressure vessel(RPV), residing somewhere between there and the water-table below each reactor. In a similar manner to what was observed at reactor 4 in Chernobyl.|$|E
25|$|The {{bulk density}} of the samples varied between 7.45 and 9.4g/cm3 (the densities of UO2 and ZrO2 are 10.4 and 5.6g/cm3). The {{porosity}} of samples varied between 5.7% and 32%, averaging at 18±11%. Striated interconnected porosity was found in some samples, suggesting the <b>corium</b> was liquid for a sufficient time for formation of bubbles of steam or vaporized structural materials and their transport through the melt. A well-mixed (U,Zr)O2 solid solution indicates peak temperature of the melt between 2600 and 2850°C.|$|E
25|$|The shape {{changes in}} a loaded hoof are complex. The plantar arch flattens, the solar {{concavity}} decreases in depth and heels spread. The hoof diameter increases to a 'dilated' configuration and P3 drops marginally into the hoof capsule. There is some recent evidence that a depression takes place in this phase, with blood pooling ('diastolic phase') mainly into the wall <b>corium.</b> When unloaded, the hoof restores its 'contracted' configuration, the pressure rises and the blood is squeezed out ('systolic phase'). There is a secondary pumping action, with the flexion of the foot, as it is raised.|$|E
