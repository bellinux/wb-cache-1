A star's energy emission as a function of wavelength is influenced by both its temperature and composition. A key indicator of this energy distribution is given by the <b>color</b> <b>index,</b> B−V, which measures the star's magnitude in blue (B) and green-yellow (V) light by means of filters. This difference in magnitude provides a measure of a star's temperature.|$|E

However, IK Pegasi A lies in a narrow, nearly vertical band of the HR diagram that is known as the instability strip. Stars in this band oscillate in a coherent manner, resulting in periodic pulsations in the star's luminosity.|$|E

40|$|In content based image retrieval, <b>color</b> <b>indexing</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{prevalent}} retrieval methods. In literature, most of the attention has been focussed on the color model with little or no consideration of the noise models. In this paper we investigate the problem of <b>color</b> <b>indexing</b> from a maximum likelihood perspective. We take into account the color model, the noise distribution, and the quantization of the color features. Furthermore, from the real noise distribution we derive a distortion measure, which consistently provides improved accuracy.

25|$|Many {{manufacturers}} of paints, inks, textiles, plastics, and colors have voluntarily adopted the Colour Index International (CII) {{as a standard}} for identifying the pigments that they use in manufacturing particular colors. First published in 1925, and now published jointly on the web by the Society of Dyers and Colourists (United Kingdom) and the American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists (USA), this index is recognized internationally as the authoritative reference on colorants. It encompasses more than 27,000 products under more than 13,000 generic <b>color</b> <b>index</b> names.|$|E
25|$|The {{modified}} {{encoding method}} ignores building the LZW table and emits only the root palette codes and the codes for CLEAR and STOP. This yields a simpler encoding (a 1-to-1 correspondence between code values and palette codes) but sacrifices {{all of the}} compression: each pixel in the image generates an output code indicating its <b>color</b> <b>index.</b> When processing an uncompressed GIF, a standard GIF decoder will not be prevented from writing strings to its dictionary table, but the code width must never increase since that triggers a different packing of bits to bytes.|$|E
25|$|In the CII schema, each pigment has {{a generic}} index number that {{identifies}} it chemically, regardless of proprietary and historic names. For example, Phthalocyanine Blue BN {{has been known}} {{by a variety of}} generic and proprietary names since its discovery in the 1930s. In much of Europe, phthalocyanine blue is better known as Helio Blue, or by a proprietary name such as Winsor Blue. An American paint manufacturer, Grumbacher, registered an alternate spelling (Thanos Blue) as a trademark. Colour Index International resolves all these conflicting historic, generic, and proprietary names so that manufacturers and consumers can identify the pigment (or dye) used in a particular color product. In the CII, all phthalocyanine blue pigments are designated by a generic <b>color</b> <b>index</b> number as either PB15 or PB16, short for pigment blue 15 and pigment blue 16; these two numbers reflect slight variations in molecular structure that produce a slightly more greenish or reddish blue.|$|E

In this paper, we introduce a method, which separates an image into layers, each of which retains only pixels in areas with similar spectral distribution characteristics. Simple <b>color</b> <b>indexing</b> is used to index the layers individually. By indexing the layers separately, we are implicitly associating the indices with perceptual and physical meanings thus greatly enhancing the power of <b>color</b> <b>indexing</b> while keeping its simplicity and elegance.

Betelgeuse is the brightest near-infrared source in the sky with a J band magnitude of −2.99. As a result, only about 13% of the star's radiant energy is emitted in the form of visible light.

500|$|In 1988, {{development}} of a new NES Zelda began, but one year later, the project was brought to Nintendo's next console; the Super Famicom in Japan, the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in other regions. Due to the success of previous titles in the series, Nintendo was able to invest a large budget and ample development time and resources into the game's production. At the time, most SNES game cartridges had 4Mbit (512 KB) of storage space. This game broke the trend by using 8Mbit (1MB), allowing the Nintendo development team to create a remarkably expansive world for Link to inhabit. Like Super Mario World, this game used a simple graphic compression method on the SNES by limiting the color depth of many tiles to eight colors instead of the SNES's native 16-color tiles. The tiles were decompressed at runtime by adding a leading bit to each pixel's <b>color</b> <b>index.</b> Storage space was also saved by eliminating duplication: The Light World and the Dark World are almost identical in layout (though using differing texture tiles), and the Dark World exists in the game's ROM only as an [...] "overlay" [...] of the Light World.|$|E

2500|$|Using {{this model}} the {{effective}} temperature of stars is estimated, {{defined as the}} temperature of a black body that yields the same surface flux of energy as the star. If a star were a black body, the same effective temperature would result from any region of the spectrum. For example, comparisons in the B (blue) or V (visible) range lead to the so-called B-V <b>color</b> <b>index,</b> which increases the redder the star, with the Sun having an index of +0.648 ± 0.006. Combining the U (ultraviolet) and the B indices leads to the U-B index, which becomes more negative the hotter the star and the more the UV radiation. Assuming the Sun is a type G2 V star, its U-B index is +0.12. The two indices for two types of stars are compared in the figure with the effective surface temperature of the stars assuming they are black bodies. It {{can be seen that}} there is only a rough correlation. For example, for a given B-V index from the blue-visible region of the spectrum., the curves for both types of star lie below the corresponding black-body U-B index that includes the ultraviolet spectrum, showing that both types of star emit less ultraviolet light than a black body with the same B-V index. It is perhaps surprising that they fit a black body curve as well as they do, considering that stars have greatly different temperatures at different depths. For example, the Sun has an effective temperature of 5780 K, which can be compared to the temperature of the photosphere of the Sun (the region generating the light), which ranges from about 5000 K at its outer boundary with the chromosphere to about 9500 K at its inner boundary with the convection zone approximately [...] deep.|$|E

This paper examines the use of a computational geometry-based spatial <b>color</b> <b>indexing</b> methodology for effective and efficient image retrieval. In this scheme, an image is evenly divided into a number of M * N non-overlapping blocks, and each individual block is abstracted as a unique feature point labeled with its spatial location and dominant colors.

The concatenation of all these feature point histograms serves as the image <b>index,</b> the so-called <b>color</b> anglogram. An important contribution of this work is to encode the spatial color information using geometric triangulation, which is rotation, translation, and scale invariant.
