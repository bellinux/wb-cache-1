50|$|The hub axle of a {{hub gear}} (unlike {{that of a}} {{derailleur}} system) will carry torque in all gears except direct drive, and so must be securely braced against rotation.

40|$|AbstractCarbon {{composites}} (CFRP) {{are commonly}} used in mountain bike frames allowing very high stiffness and strength at low weights. But CFRP is also sensitive to transversal impact loads, which damage the material from within and can affect the structural safety. A mountain bike frame suffers from different types of impacts, like crashes and stone impacts as well as contacts of the chain on the <b>chain</b> <b>stay.</b> In rough terrain or by passing obstacles, the chain starts oscillating vertically, on the slack span {{as well as on}} the tight span of the drive train. Oscillations with high amplitudes, caused for example by jumps, will lead to impacts of the chain on the <b>chain</b> <b>stay.</b> It is known that recurring impacts damage the surface of the <b>chain</b> <b>stay,</b> but there is only little knowledge if the impact energy leads to considerable damage inside the material, affecting the structures integrity. To analyze the occurring energy levels and to investigate the effect of <b>chain</b> <b>stay</b> impact on the structural safety, a validated multi body model of a Shimano XT drive train was developed in Simpack. The model is activated by vertical excitation based on acceleration measurements in field. This allows the assessment of the energy levels of the impact events as a function of excitation (e. g. track consistence) and drive train parameters (masses, moments of inertia, geometrical dimensions) ...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyse the effect of forces applied to pedals and cranks on the strain imposed to an {{instrumented}} bicycle motocross (BMX) frame. Using results from a finite element analysis to determine the localisation of highest stress, eight strain gauges were located on the down tube, the seat tube and the right <b>chain</b> <b>stay.</b> Before the pedaling tests, static loads were applied to the frame during bench tests. Two pedaling conditions have been analysed. In the first, the rider was in static standing position on the pedals and applied maximal muscular isometric force to the right pedal. The second pedaling condition corresponds to three pedaling sprint tests at submaximal intensities at 150, 300 and 550 W on a cycle-trainer. The results showed that smaller strain was observed in the pedaling condition than in the rider static standing position condition. The highest strains were located in the seat tube and the right <b>chain</b> <b>stay</b> near the bottom bracket area. The maximum stress observed through all conditions was 41 MPa on the right <b>chain</b> <b>stay.</b> This stress was 11 times lower than the yield stress of the frame material (460 MPa). This protocol could help to adapt the frame design to the riders as a function of their force and mechanical power output. These results could also help design BMX frames for specific populations (females) and rider morphology...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{structural}} role of {{the bicycle}} frame is to transfer the mechanical energy produced by the cyclist at the rear wheel. In bicycle cross (BMX) high loads are applied on the frame, from the pilot, {{the field and the}} ground reaction. In BMX, the empirical design and the important power applied on the pedals can lead to the rupture of some tubes. The aim {{of this study is to}} equipped a BMX frame with strain gages and to measure the strain of the bicycle frame through tests representative of different actual race conditions: (1) A bar system was designed to simulate the forces applied to the pedals by the pilot in static condition; (2) a pilot applied a maximal isometric force on the pedal with help of handlebars (e. g., Competition start); and (3) a pilot performed one pedaling bout at a cadence of 200 rotations per minute and at power of 550 Watts. During the last two conditions, the tests were realized on an ergo-trainer with two 3 D pedals and a SRM. The results obtained through experimentations highlight the strain imbalance in the frame. The conditions as function of time confirm the results obtained in static condition: the seat tube, the down tube and the <b>chain</b> <b>stay</b> have to be strengthened in the area near the bracket. The muscular power output is an important parameter of performance in BMX and the deformation of the frame is proportional to the power developed. To develop a bicycle frame optimized for performance, it is necessary to develop tests that represent the cyclist-frame interaction in actual conditions. This protocol can be useful in order to compare BMX frames and to find the determinant factors to enhance the transfer of mechanical energy from the pedal to the drive train...|$|E

25|$|The great {{majority}} of modern bicycles have a frame with upright seating that looks much like the first chain-driven bike. These upright bicycles almost always feature the diamond frame, a truss consisting of two triangles: the front triangle and the rear triangle. The front triangle consists of the head tube, top tube, down tube, and seat tube. The head tube contains the headset, the set of bearings that allows the fork to turn smoothly for steering and balance. The top tube connects the head tube to the seat tube at the top, and the down tube connects the head tube to the bottom bracket. The rear triangle consists of the seat tube and paired <b>chain</b> <b>stays</b> and seat <b>stays.</b> The <b>chain</b> <b>stays</b> run parallel to the chain, connecting the bottom bracket to the rear dropout, where the axle for the rear wheel is held. The seat stays connect {{the top of the}} seat tube (at or near the same point as the top tube) to the rear fork ends.|$|R
50|$|The {{bottom bracket}} {{on a bicycle}} connects the {{crankset}} (chainset) to the bicycle and allows the crankset to rotate freely.

25|$|The {{bottom bracket}} shell is a short and large {{diameter}} tube, relative to the other tubes in the frame, that runs side to side and holds the bottom bracket.

There are many variations, such as an eccentric bottom bracket, which allows for adjustment in tension of the bicycle's chain. It is typically larger, unthreaded, and sometimes split. The <b>chain</b> <b>stays,</b> seat tube, and down tube all typically connect to the {{bottom bracket shell}}.|$|R
