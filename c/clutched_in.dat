25|$|Two {{months after}} Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated, Louisville's West End rioted. On May 27, 1968, {{a protest against}} police {{brutality}} was happening at Twenty-eighth and Greenwood Streets that eventually turned violent when the Louisville police jumped {{out of their cars}} with their guns already drawn. Louie B. Nunn called out the National Guard. 472 arrests were made, $200,000 in damages happened, and James Groves Jr, 14, and Washington Browder, 19, were murdered. Washington Browder had a fish sandwich still <b>clutched</b> <b>in</b> his hand when found on the sidewalk, shot dead, by a business owner. James Groves Jr. was shot in the back, after supposedly looting during the riots.|$|E
500|$|Montagu {{considered}} {{that there would}} be a possible [...] "Roman Catholic prejudice against tampering with corpses", which could miss the documents stored in the corpse's pockets, so they added them to an official briefcase that would not be overlooked. To justify carrying documents in a briefcase, Major Martin was given two proof copies of the official pamphlet on combined operations written by the author Hilary Saunders – then on Mountbatten's staff – and a letter from Mountbatten to Eisenhower, asking him to write a brief foreword for the pamphlet's US edition. The planning team first thought of having the handle <b>clutched</b> <b>in</b> the corpse's hand, held in place by rigor mortis, but the rigor would probably wear off and the briefcase would drift away. They therefore equipped Martin with a leather-covered chain, such as was used by bank and jewellery couriers to secure their cases against snatching. The chain unobtrusively runs down a sleeve to the case. To Montagu it seemed unlikely that the major would keep the bag secured to his wrist during the long flight from Britain, so the chain was looped around the belt of his trench coat.|$|E
500|$|As {{the group}} {{attempts}} to enter Dr. Totenkopf's lair, one scientist is electrocuted {{by the defense}} system. A hologram of Totenkopf appears, speaking about his hate for humanity and his plans to rebuild it as a new master race. Dex disables the defenses and the group discovers Totenkopf's mummified corpse inside with {{a scrap of paper}} <b>clutched</b> <b>in</b> his hand: [...] "forgive me". He had died 20 years prior, but his machines continued his plan. Joe decides to sabotage the rocket from the inside while the others escape. Polly tries to tag along, but Joe kisses her and then knocks her out. Polly recovers, following Joe and luckily saving him from Dr. Jennings' assassin, a female robot. Joe and Polly then board the rocket. Before the rocket reaches 100km, when its second stage is scheduled to fire and thereby incinerate the Earth, Polly pushes an emergency button that ejects all the animals in escape pods. Joe tries to disable the rocket only to be interrupted by the same robot. He jolts the robot with its electric weapon and then uses it on the controls, disabling the rocket. They use the last pod to save themselves as the rocket safely explodes.|$|E

500|$|On 2 July, {{the show}} publicised that the {{character}} would be killed off. The show's producers decided to keep detail of how Kylie would die a secret. But Kilkelly of Digital Spy described it as [...] "tragic". Kylie decides she can no longer {{live in the house}} where Callum died and convinces David that they must move away. The reporter added that the Platt family would not succeed in their move because Kylie would die in a [...] "storyline twist". The following day Coronation Street released promotional images depicting David mourning Kylie over her open coffin. Lane described Kylie's death as one of the [...] "most shocking" [...] ever featured on the show. Shepherd described it as a [...] "harrowing exit" [...] for the character, at which he and Lane cried uncontrollably. He added that writers warned him in advance that it would be [...] "very harrowing and emotional". Newspaper photographs later revealed Kylie would die on Coronation Street. The picture showed her body being <b>clutched</b> <b>in</b> David's arms. Kylie's death scenes occurred following her decision to defend Gemma after she is attacked by Clayton Hibbs (Callum Harrison). He turns on Kylie and stabs her and she dies in the street with David by her side. The death scene led many viewers to mourn the on-screen death of the fictional character, via social media website Twitter. Though some viewers complained about a bloody stabbing airing before the 21:00 broadcasting watershed.|$|E

2500|$|Once the {{stabilizer}} was righted, the bombardier {{would then}} dial {{in the initial}} setup for altitude, speed, and direction. The prism would then be [...] "clutched out" [...] of the computer, allowing it to be moved rapidly {{to search for the}} target on the ground. Later Nordens were equipped with a reflector sight to aid in this step. Once the target was located the computer was <b>clutched</b> <b>in</b> and started moving the prism to follow the target. The bombardier would begin making adjustments to the aim. [...] As all of the controls were located on the right, and had to be operated while sighting through the telescope, another problem with the Norden is that the bombardier could only adjust either the vertical or horizontal aim at a given time, his other arm was normally busy holding himself up above the telescope.|$|E

"I {{have known}} {{many people who}} are {{diagnosed}} with this disease, and other terminally ill people through my profession, who hang onto this little piece of paper they call “hope” in their hand. A lot of them die with it still <b>clutched</b> <b>in</b> their hand. My hope lies in the future. I don’t believe there will be a cure for me. I can take AZT or whatever drugs are developed to prolong my life for a time, but my hope is for finding a vaccine to prevent children of the future from getting HIV." [...] -Reggie Williams (1987) Williams became involved in the National Association of Black and White Men Together (NABWMT) when he first moved to San Francisco in 1981. After being involved with BWMT three years, he began the San Francisco BWMT's AIDS task force in 1984. He invited representatives of many AIDS organizations to his home a week after a presentation held by BWMT. This was the first meeting of the task force where they talked about AIDS-related concerns of gay men of color.|$|E
2500|$|The {{prosecutor}} {{showed the}} jury the outfit Saldívar had worn during her alleged rape. He claimed {{that someone had}} purposefully torn holes and shredded the shirt with scissors. On October 13, Rosalinda Gonzalez, the assistant manager of the Days Inn, was called to testify. She told the jury that when Selena arrived in the lobby after being shot, she had asked the singer who shot her. Selena cried out [...] "the girl in room 158". Ruben DeLeon, the motel's salesman, said that Selena told him [...] "Yolanda, Yolanda Saldívar shot me. The one in room 158." [...] Receptionist Shawna Vela testified that she had heard the same statements but added that Selena had screamed: [...] "lock the door, she'll shoot me again" [...] before collapsing. Vela told the jury that {{there was so much}} blood that she felt nauseous before calling 911. The last person to be called to testify was paramedic Richard Fredrickson who described, in detail, Selena's condition and a mysterious ring she <b>clutched</b> <b>in</b> her hands. The Quintanilla family were seen sobbing as Fredrickson detailed his attempts to save Selena's life, while Saldívar [...] "stared blankly".|$|E
