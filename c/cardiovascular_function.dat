40|$|The {{effects of}} aging, chronic stress, {{and social support}} on <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>functioning</b> were exam-ined using a {{cross-sectional}} design. Thirty-six family caregivers of Alzheimer's disease victims and 34 control Ss performed 2 active coping tasks while continuous noninvasive measures of cardiovas-cular activity were monitored. Results revealed that caregivers high in social support displayed typical age-related decreases in heart-rate reactivity, whereas caregivers low in social support dis-played age-related increases in heart-rate reactivity. Analyses further indicated that only Ss with low social support were characterized by age-related increases in systolic blood pressure. These results suggest that social support can moderate age-related changes in <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>functioning,</b> partic-ularly in Ss exposed to a chronic stressor. Age-related changes in <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>functioning</b> are well documented, but {{the potential impact of}} social factors on these changes has not received much attention.

40|$|Introduction. Previous {{research}} has implicated certain personality traits in the aetiology of cardiovascular disease. One common theme in such research is that traits that impinge upon social interactions and relationships (e. g., hostility, Type A) {{may be especially}} relevant. Several patterns of cardiovascular reactivity {{have been found to}} be associated with poor future health outcomes, including exaggerated and diminished reactivity, and delayed recovery after stress. The present research examines the influence of individual differences in socially oriented traits on patterns of <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>functioning</b> in different contexts. Methods. Three empirical studies are reported. In a sample of 80 participants (60 women, 20 men), Study 1 examines the influence of broad affective personality characteristics using the NEO Five-Factor inventory, including neuroticism and extraversion subscales. Study 2 examined <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>functioning</b> during exposures to social and asocial forms of stress in a laboratory session. From a sample 94 participants (67 women, 37 men), a subsample of 44 women were included in the final analyses. Study 3 examined the effects of trait dominance on cardiovascular responses to repeated social stress exposures for 75 participants (54 women, 21 men). Results. Study 1 found that affective personality traits (neuroticism and extraversion) were associated with diurnal patterns of <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>functioning.</b> Study 2 found that lower trait dominance was associated with exaggerated <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>functioning</b> during social, but not asocial forms of stress, relative to those higher in trait dominance. Study 3 found that blunted patterns of <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>functioning</b> for those higher in trait dominance were associated with vascular profiles of hemodynamic cardiovascular responding, indicative of future ill-health. Conclusions. In sum, it was found that blunted patterns of <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>functioning</b> were associated with individual differences in personality traits related to interpersonal trait affectivity, including neuroticism, extraversion, and trait dominance. The research confirms some recent work that has established blunting as a negative cardiovascular trend, associated with aspects of <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>functioning</b> that are related to future disease risk. Additionally, individual differences in dominance were found to be associated with the identification of these potentially maladaptive physiological trends...|$|R

25|$|Physiologically, {{increased}} pressure in utero, rickets and increased traction on the sternum due to abnormalities of the diaphragm have been postulated as specific mechanisms. Because {{the heart is}} located behind the sternum, and because individuals with pectus excavatum {{have been shown to}} have visible deformities of the heart seen both on radiological imaging and after autopsies, it has been hypothesized that there is impairment of function of the cardiovascular system in individuals with pectus excavatum. While some studies have demonstrated decreased <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>function,</b> no consensus has been reached based on newer physiological tests such as echocardiography of the presence or degree of impairment in <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>function.</b> Similarly, there is no consensus on the degree of functional improvement after corrective surgery; A 2013 meta-analysis yielded conflicting results.|$|E

Billman has used his sudden cardiac death models to study the effects of exercise training on susceptibility to SCD and the effects of omega-3 fatty acids, among other things. Due to his use of live animals in experiments, Billman has been criticized by animal rights activists; a 2009 regulatory investigation found no evidence of wrongdoing.|$|E

40|$|Few {{studies have}} {{investigated}} the physiology underlying forgiveness, and those that have ignore the intimate relationship context. The present study, therefore, examined blood pressure and myocardial oxygen consumption, 2 indices of <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>functioning,</b> {{in a sample of}} married couples (n 90) recruited from the community. Both trait forgiveness and forgiveness specific to the spouse (dyadic forgiveness) were examined. The actor-partner interdependence model was used to examine actor (in-trapersonal) and partner (interpersonal) effects of trait forgiveness and dyadic forgive-ness on <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>functioning.</b> With marital satisfaction controlled, trait forgive-ness yielded actor effects for both indices of <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>functioning</b> among husbands but not wives. However, the strength of the associations for trait forgiveness and dyadic forgiveness did not differ significantly between husbands and wives. This research is the first to model physiology through dyadic data analysis. These findings are discussed in terms of sex differences in forgiveness, and suggestions are outlined for future research...|$|R

We conducted a field survey of 238 male engineers who were working at the department of research & development of three electronics manufacturing companies in S. Korea.

30|$|The same {{regions of}} the brain {{involved}} in the ages of memories and recollecting emotional memories are also involved in physiological functioning. Research has supported both an inhibitory and an excitatory role of the prefrontal cortex in electrodermal activity [31, 34].

The prefrontal regions also have an inhibitory influence on <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>functioning,</b> with stimulation resulting in bradycardia and depressor responses [15]. The temporal lobes, and in particular the insular cortices, are also known to be involved in modulating <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>functioning</b> [1, 28, 38]. Additionally, we have reported significant correlations between cardiovascular activity and EEG, both at rest [11, 9] and in response to recollection of angry memories [10]. Hence, the shared involvement of the frontal and temporal regions in both physiological activity and emotional memory recollection may provide part of the mechanism whereby emotional memories generate changes in indices of physiological activity.|$|R
