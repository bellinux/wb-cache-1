Inhibition of endothelial Rho kinase (ROCK) with Y 27632 and overexpression of ROCK dominant-negative mutant prevented SCLC cells, NCI-H 209, transendothelial migration and the concomitant changes of tight junction. Conversely, inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) and protein kinase C (PKC) had no effects.

40|$|Fibroblast {{growth factors}} (FGFs) bind to FGF receptors, transmembrane {{tyrosine}} kinases that activate mitogenic, motogenic, and differentiative responses in different tissues. While {{there has been}} substantial progress in elucidating the Ras-MAP kinase pathway that mediates the differentiative responses, the signal transduction pathways that lead to directed <b>cell</b> <b>migrations</b> are not well defined. Here we describe a Drosophila gene called stumps that is required for FGF-dependent migrations of tracheal and mesodermal <b>cells.</b> These <b>migrations</b> are controlled by different FGF ligands and receptors, and they occur by different cellular mechanisms: the tracheal migrations occur {{as part of an}} epithelium whereas the mesodermal migrations are fibroblast-like. In the stumps mutant, tracheal cells fail to move out from the epithelial sacs, and only rudimentary tracheal branches form. Mesodermal cells fail in their dorsal migrations after gastrulation. The stumps mutation does not block all FGF signaling effects in these tissues: both random <b>cell</b> <b>migrations</b> and Ras-MAP kinase-mediated induction of FGF-specific effector genes occurred upon ectopic expression of the ligand or upon expression of a constitutively activated Ras protein in the migrating cells. The results suggest that stumps function promotes FGF-directed <b>cell</b> <b>migrations,</b> either by potentiating the FGF signaling process or by coupling the signal to the cellular machinery required for directed cell movement...|$|R

40|$|After {{fertilization}} Zebrafish embryos undergo synchronous cleavage {{to form a}} blastula {{of cells}} sitting upon a single multinucleate yolk cell. At the beginning of gastrulation these cells undergo extensive <b>cell</b> <b>migrations</b> to form the major body axes. We have discovered a gene, G 12, which is required for <b>cell</b> <b>migrations</b> and positioning of nuclei in the large syncytial yolk cell. Overexpression of a G 12 -GFP fusion protein is not toxic and shows that the protein localizes inside the yolk cell to the yolk nuclei, microtubules, and to the margin between the blastomeres and the large yolk cell. Morpholino (MO) injection into the 1 -cell embryo or into just the yolk syncytium conipletely inhibits <b>cell</b> <b>migrations,</b> doming of the yolk cell, and positioning of nuclei around the margin. This effect can be partially rescued by injection of G 12 -GFP encoding RNA. Given the known role of microtubules in nuclear positioning of yolk nuclei in Zebrafish, we investigated the microtubules in morpholiiio injected and rescued embryos. We find that microtubules are sparse and disorganized in MO-injected embryos and are restored to normal organization upon G 12 -GFP rescue.

50|$|UNC-129 is a ligand in the {{transforming}} {{growth factor}} family in C. elegans which encodes transforming growth factor β (TGF-β).

25|$|Anthrax toxin is a three-protein {{exotoxin}} secreted by virulent {{strains of}} the bacterium, Bacillus anthracis—the causative agent of anthrax. The toxin was first discovered by Harry Smith in 1954. Anthrax toxin is composed of a cell-binding protein, known as protective antigen (PA), and two enzyme components, called edema factor (EF) and lethal factor (LF). These three protein components act together to impart their physiological effects. Assembled complexes containing the toxin components are endocytosed. In the endosome, the enzymatic components of the toxin translocate into the cytoplasm of a target cell. Once in the cytosol, the enzymatic components of the toxin disrupts various immune cell functions, namely cellular signaling and <b>cell</b> <b>migration.</b> The toxin may even induce cell lysis, as is observed for macrophage cells. Anthrax toxin allows the bacteria to evade the immune system, proliferate, and ultimately kill the host animal.

40|$|Background/Aims: IL- 4 is a {{multifunctional}} cytokine that {{is related}} with the pathological conditions of periodontal disease. However, {{it is uncertain}} whether IL- 4 could control T <b>cells</b> <b>migration</b> in periodontal lesions. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine the effects of IL- 4 on CCL 11, which is a Th 2 -type chemokine, and CCL 20, which is related with Th 17 <b>cells</b> <b>migration,</b> productions from human periodontal ligament cells (HPDLCs). Methods: CCL 20 and CCL 11 productions from HPDLCs were monitored by ELISA. Western blot analysis was performed to detect phosphorylations of signal transduction molecules in HPDLCs. Results: IL- 1 β could induce both CCL 11 and CCL 20 productions in HPDLCs. IL- 4 enhanced CCL 11 productions from IL- 1 β-stimulated HPDLCs, though IL- 4 inhibited CCL 20 production. Western blot analysis showed that protein kinase B (Akt) and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 6 pathways were highly activated in IL- 4 /IL- 1 β-stimulated HPDLCs. Akt and STAT 6 inhibitors decreased CCL 11 production, but enhanced CCL 20 production in HPDLCs stimulated with IL- 4 and IL- 1 β. Conclusions: These results mean that IL- 4 enhanced Th 2 <b>cells</b> <b>migration</b> in periodontal lesion to induce CCL 11 production from HPDLCs. On the other hand, IL- 4 inhibits Th 17 cells accumulation in periodontally diseased tissues to inhibit CCL 20 production.

Although {{the structure of}} the enzyme-substrate complex c-Raf:MKK1 is unknown, it can be precisely modelled after the KSR2:MKK1 complex. Here no actual catalysis takes place, but it is thought to be highly similar to the way Raf binds to its substrates. The main interaction interface is provided by the C-terminal lobes of both kinase domains; the large, disordered, proline-rich loop unique to MKK1 and MKK2 also {{plays an important role in}} its positioning to Raf (and KSR). These MKKs become phosphorylated at at least two sites on their activation loops upon binding to Raf: this will activate them too. The targets of the kinase cascade are ERK1 and ERK2, that are selectively activated by MKK1 or MKK2. ERKs have numerous substrates in cells; they are also capable of translocating into the nucleus to activate nuclear transcription factors. Activated ERKs are pleiotropic effectors of cell physiology and play an important role in the control of gene expression involved in the cell division cycle, <b>cell</b> <b>migration,</b> inhibition of apoptosis, and cell differentiation.|$|E

500|$|In development, reelin is {{secreted}} by Cajal-Retzius cells. [...] Reelin {{acts as an}} extracellular {{ligand binding}} to ApoER2 and VLDLR on migrating neurons. A specific lysine residue on reelin binds to the first repeat on the ligand binding domain of ApoER2. This interaction with the two receptors activates intracellular processes that begin with the phosphorylation of Dab1, a tyrosine kinase phosphorylated protein which is encoded by the DAB1 gene. This protein associates with the NPXY motifs on the intracellular tails of ApoER2 and VLDLR. Upon reelin binding, Dab1 is phosphorylated by two tyrosine kinases, Fyn and Src. The phosphorylated Dab1 then causes further activation of these two kinases and others, including a phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K). PI3K activation leads to inhibitory phosphorylation of the tau kinase glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3B), which alters the activity of tau protein, a protein involved in stabilizing microtubules.

500|$|In {{addition}} to {{the negative consequences of}} sleep deprivation, sleep and the intertwined circadian system have been shown to have strong regulatory effects on immunological functions affecting both the innate and the adaptive immunity. First, during the early slow-wave-sleep stage, a sudden drop in blood levels of cortisol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine induce increased blood levels of the hormones leptin, pituitary growth hormone, and prolactin. These signals induce a pro-inflammatory state through the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1, interleukin-12, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma. These cytokines then stimulate immune functions such as immune cells activation, proliferation, and differentiation. It is during this time that undifferentiated, or less differentiated, like naïve and central memory T cells, peak (i.e. during a time of a slowly evolving adaptive immune response). [...] In {{addition to}} these effects, the milieu of hormones produced at this time (leptin, pituitary growth hormone, and prolactin) support the interactions between APCs and T-cells, a shift of the Th1/Th2 cytokine balance towards one that supports Th1, an increase in overall Th cell proliferation, and naïve T <b>cell</b> <b>migration</b> to lymph nodes.
