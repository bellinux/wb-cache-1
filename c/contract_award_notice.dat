40|$|We {{present the}} OpenTED browser, a Web {{application}} allowing to interactively browse public spending data related to public procurements in the European Union. The application relies on Open Data recently {{published by the}} European Commission and the Publications Office of the European Union, from which we imported a curated dataset of 4. 2 million <b>contract</b> <b>award</b> <b>notices</b> spanning the period 2006 - 2015. The application is designed to easily filter notices and visualise relationships between public contracting authorities and private contractors. The simple design allows for example to quickly find information about who the biggest suppliers of local governments are, {{and the nature of}} the contracted goods and services. We believe the tool, which we make Open Source, is a valuable source of information for journalists, NGOs, analysts and citizens for getting information on public procurement data, from large scale trends to local municipal developments.
