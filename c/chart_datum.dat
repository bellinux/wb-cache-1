Next, precision and reliability aspects of computed median lines are discussed. Attention in a technical way is given to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) in rela tion to national rules and regulations. For The Netherlands in particular, this includes the mining legislation for the continental shelf, the fishing legislation and the regulations with regard to large infrastructural works.

This kind of a situation causes some practical difficulties for the users of navigational information and the co-operation between the Baltic Sea countries concerning hydrographic tasks related to depth and height information. In June 2005 the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) Baltic Sea Hydrographic Commission (BSHC) established a working group for the harmonization of the <b>chart</b> <b>datums</b> of the Baltic Sea. The work of the CharDatumWG was continued in June 2007 when the tasks were approved by BSHC 12 th Conference. The main task of this ChartDatumWG is to study the feasibility to use the realization of the European Vertical Reference System (EVRS) as a principal alternative for the vertical reference system of Baltic Sea nautical charts. The ChartDatumWG should also study possible time schedules and preconditions with each of the Baltic Sea country could move to use this harmonized <b>datum</b> on nautical <b>charts.</b> The ChartDatumWG should study and develop recommended principles how the transfer period should be implemented.

40|$|A Vertical Offshore Reference Frames (VORF) {{software}} was completed and {{delivered to the}} UK Hydrographic Office in December 2006. It comprised a technology demonstrator that enabled transformations of depth and height data between various vertical land and sea reference surfaces for the UK and Eire waters. As such surfaces are {{used as the basis}} for marine <b>charting,</b> the land <b>datums</b> used for expressing height above sea level, and the reference frame used for GPS/GNSS positioning. In 2010, using a collaboration of tidal height observations ranging from short and long term data sets an independent check of the accuracy of the model was conducted. Three sites were evaluated in Plymouth Sound and Tamar Estuary, southwest England, through harmonic analysis of in situ tide gauge data to produce the surfaces HAT, MHWS, MSL, MLWS, and LAT. These surfaces were then compared to the VORF generated separations for each site to assess the differences in the model predictions against actual tide gauge observations. Resulting from the observation the values created by the model had a constant uncertainty for all conducted transformation applied to 1 -sigma value at each location identifying an higher precision that warranted by the UKHO.
