The inland caves are not abundant with life, but do contain creatures living in the caves other than the migrating gray snappers. Residents of these caves include a type of blind <b>cave</b> <b>fish</b> and remipedia that don't pose any threat to cave divers.|$|E

40|$|<b>Cave</b> <b>fishes</b> need {{to rely on}} non-visual senses, such as {{the sense}} of smell or the lateral line to {{communicate}} in darkness. In the present study, we investigated sex identification by females of a cave-dwelling livebearing <b>fish,</b> Poecilia mexicana (<b>cave</b> molly), {{as well as its}} surfacedwelling relatives. Unlike many other <b>cave</b> <b>fishes,</b> <b>cave</b> mollies still possess functional eyes. Three different modes of presentation of the stimulus fish (a male and an equally sized female) were used: (i) the stimulus fish were presented behind wire-mesh in light, allowing the focal female to perceive multiple cues, (ii) the experiment was carried out under infrared conditions, such that only nonvisual cues could be perceived and (iii) the stimulus fish were presented in light behind transparent Plexiglas, allowing for the use of visual cues only. Females of all populations examined preferred to associate with the stimulus female in {{at least one of the}} treatments, but only when visible light was provided, suggesting that far-range sex recognition is limited or even absent in the cave molly under naturally dark conditions...|$|R
25|$|In {{biological}} systems phenotype {{can be said}} to supervene on genotype. This is because any genotype encodes a finite set of unique phenotypes, but any given phenotype is not produced by a finite set of genotypes. Innumerable examples of convergent evolution can be used to support this claim. Throughout nature, convergent evolution produces incredibly similar phenotypes from a diverse set of taxa with fundamentally different genotypes underpinning the phenotypes. One example is evolution on islands which is a remarkably predictable example of convergent evolution where the same phenotypes consistently evolve for the same reasons. Organisms released from predation tend to become larger, while organisms limited by food tend to become smaller. Yet there are almost infinite numbers of genetic changes that might lead to changes in body size. Another example of convergent evolution is the loss of sight that almost universally occurs in <b>cave</b> <b>fish</b> living in lightless pools. Eyes are expensive, and in lightless cave pools there is little reason for fish to have eyes. Yet, despite the remarkably consistent convergent evolution producing sightless <b>cave</b> <b>fish,</b> the genetics that produce the loss of type phenotype is different nearly every time. This is because phenotype supervenes on genotype.|$|E
500|$|Some wild <b>cave</b> <b>fish</b> have {{populations that}} are albinistic. [...] The Mexican cave tetra is {{a species that}} has evolved {{specialized}} characteristics {{in a series of}} independent caves. [...] One of these is albinism linked to the Oca2 gene, a known pigmentation gene, This trait has evolved independently in at least two caves.|$|E
500|$|In mammals, {{albinism}} is occasionally {{associated with}} hearing impairments. However, when tested, {{there was no}} differences in responses between wild-type and albinistic European wels catfish (Silurus glanis) and South American bronze catfish (Corydoras aeneus). [...] Similarly, Mexican blind <b>cave</b> <b>fish</b> (Astyanax mexicanus) do not differ in hearing sensitivity from the normally pigmented and eyed surface-dwelling populations. [...] Fish lack melanin in the inner ear, meaning that hearing in fishes {{is less likely to}} be affected by albinism than in mammals.|$|E

40|$|We show {{using the}} most {{complete}} phylogeny {{of one of the}} most species-rich orders of vertebrates (Gobiiformes), and calibrations from the rich fossil record of teleost fishes, that the genus Typhleotris, endemic to subterranean karst habitats in southwestern Madagascar, is the sister group to Milyeringa, endemic to similar subterranean systems in northwestern Australia. Both groups are eyeless, and our phylogenetic and biogeographic results show that these obligate <b>cave</b> <b>fishes</b> now found on opposite ends of the Indian Ocean (separated by nearly 7, 000 km) are each others closest relatives and owe their origins to the break up of the southern supercontinent, Gondwana, at the end of the Cretaceous period.

40|$|Numerous {{groundwater}} ecosystems, including {{caves and}} karstic aquifers, {{are characterized by}} severely limited food supplies {{during most of the}} year {{because of the lack of}} autotrophic production and sporadic, unpredictable, allochthonous input. Because of the temporal and spatial patchiness of food availability in most cave biotopes, periods of prolonged starvation are common events in the life of subterranean (i. e. hypogean) organisms (Poulson, 1964; Hüppop, 1985; Hervant et al., 1997; Hervant et al., 1999). Several hypogean species are able to survive for long periods without food – nearly 1 year in invertebrates, and up to several years in <b>cave</b> <b>fishes</b> and salamanders (Poulson, 1964; Mathieu and Gibert, 1980; Hervant et al., 1997; Hervant et al., 1999).

40|$|Fish assemblages {{associated}} with 14 marine caves and adjacent external rocky reefs were investigated at four Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) along {{the coasts of}} Italy. Within the caves sampling {{was carried out in}} different sub-habitats: walls, ceilings, bottoms and ends of caves. On the whole, 38 species were recorded inside the 14 caves investigated. Eighteen species were exclusively found inside the caves: they were mainly represented by speleophilic (i. e. species preferentially or exclusively inhabiting caves) gobids (e. g. Didogobius splechtnai) and nocturnal species (e. g. Conger conger). Forty-one species were censused outside, 20 of which were shared with cave habitats. Apogon imberbis was the most common fish found in all 14 caves investigated, followed by Thorogobius ephippiatus (recorded in 13 caves), and Diplodus vulgaris and Scorpaena notata (both censused in 12 <b>caves).</b> Distinct <b>fish</b> assemblages were found between external rocky reefs and the different cave sub-habitats. New data on the distribution of some speleophilic gobids were collected, showing the existence of a pool of species shared by marine caves on a large scale (i. e. hundreds of km). Considering the uniqueness of <b>cave</b> <b>fishes</b> (18 exclusive species and different assemblage structures), the inclusion of marine caves among the habitats routinely investigated for fish biodiversity monitoring could facilitate the achievement of more comprehensive inventories. Due to their contribution to local species diversity and the shelter they provide to species valuable for conservation, marine caves should be prioritized for their inclusion not only within future MPAs through the Mediterranean Sea, but also into larger management spatial planning...|$|R
