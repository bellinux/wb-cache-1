He donated large amounts of money to various charitable organizations and scientific research programs through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which was established in 2000.|$|E
5|$|The case, and {{the earlier}} Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District, are {{considered}} landmark decisions for defining {{the right to}} expression for students in public schools. While subsequent <b>court</b> <b>rulings</b> have varied on when Hazelwood applies, the case remains a strong precedent in the regulation of student speech. However, the New Voices bill of 2016, passed by 18 states, ignores the Hazelwood decision {{and returns to the}} Tinker precedent.|$|E

5|$|During the shutdown, some 19,000 state {{employees}} were laid off. State {{and federal government}} employees in Minnesota lost approximately $65 million in wages {{over the course of}} the shutdown. Because of <b>court</b> <b>rulings,</b> some of the 36,000 {{state employees}} who received layoff notices leading up to the shutdown continued or returned to work during the shutdown. Laid-off employees were immediately eligible for unemployment benefits, and continued to receive health insurance, costing the state millions a week.|$|E
5|$|Its Supreme Court, {{headed by}} the Chief Justice, is {{paramount}} on constitutional issues. Other cases can be appealed to the two-judge Appellate Court. Parliament cannot overturn court decisions, but Appellate <b>Court</b> <b>rulings</b> can be appealed to the High Court of Australia. In practice this rarely happens. Lower courts consist of the District Court and the Family Court, {{both of which are}} headed by a Resident Magistrate, who also is the Registrar of the Supreme Court. There are two other quasi-courts: the Public Service Appeal Board and the Police Appeal Board, both of which are presided over by the Chief Justice.|$|E
5|$|Lara then {{requested}} a rehearing en banc {{by the full}} court. The request was granted, and the full court reversed {{the decision of the}} three-judge panel, ordering that the federal indictment be dismissed on the grounds of double jeopardy. While the court noted that the Fifth Amendment allowed prosecution by two separate sovereigns, such as the federal government and a state government, it found that an Indian tribe derived its authority to prosecute offenders from the ICRA, which was federal law. The court noted that in previous Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>rulings,</b> the determination of tribal jurisdiction was based on the tribal membership of the individual, not on his race as an Indian. This meant that double jeopardy attached. The United States then appealed to the Supreme Court, which granted certiorari to hear the case.|$|E

5|$|Sotomayor's circuit <b>court</b> <b>rulings</b> led to {{her being}} {{considered}} a political centrist by the ABA Journal and other sources and organizations. Several lawyers, legal experts, and news organizations identified her as someone with liberal inclinations. In any case, the Second Circuit's caseload typically skewed more toward business and securities law rather than hot-button social or constitutional issues. Sotomayor tended to write narrow, practiced rulings that relied on close application of the law to the facts of a case rather than import general philosophical viewpoints. A Congressional Research Service analysis found that Sotomayor's rulings defied easy ideological categorization, but did show an adherence to precedent and an avoidance of overstepping the circuit court's judicial role. Unusually, Sotomayor read through all the supporting documents of cases under review; her lengthy rulings explored every aspect of a case and tended to feature leaden, ungainly prose. Some legal experts have said that Sotomayor's attention to detail and re-examination of the facts of a case came close to overstepping the traditional role of appellate judges.|$|E

Many of these influential laws came from U.S. Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>rulings</b> regarding tribal sovereignty.
