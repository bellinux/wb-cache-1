5|$|Edisto Beach, South Carolina was <b>changed</b> <b>forever</b> by Gracie, due {{to human}} efforts to renourish the beach after its passage. Most {{of the shell}} hash beach {{currently}} at Edisto was placed there after Gracie. In order to expand the beach, an inland marsh was excavated {{and moved to the}} shoreline. This created highly desirable beach front property which led to new development along the coast seaward of Palmetto Boulevard, but also created an environmental catastrophe along the nearby ocean floor. A species of isopod which grows in coastal estuaries, the Cyathura Polita, disappeared after the passage of this hurricane from the Ashepoo River in South Carolina. The Kermadec petrel, a bird, was swept to Lookout Mountain Sanctuary in Pennsylvania during Gracie, marking the first time it appeared in North America.|$|E

25|$|The game is set 62 {{years in}} the future, {{following}} a great change that has returned magic to the world. The emergence of magic, {{the outbreak of the}} VITAS plagues, the Computer Crash of 2029, the Euro-Wars, and the fevers for independence of Amerindian tribes, Chinese provinces, and everything else that came with the many struggles that ravaged Europe and Asia left the world's governments tumbling and falling. The United States was broken into substates. Monetary value was lost. The world had to rebuild, and rebuild they did, this time {{in the image of the}} megacorporations that seized power. Taking advantage of the laws that had been passed years ago, and using their newfound freedom, the megacorps began impressing their power on the failing governments.

25|$|Under foreign rule, the Low Countries {{were able}} to {{extensively}} develop economically and politically. However, {{the sense of a}} shared “nationality” was still non-existent. This sense of nationality was forged through conflict and was the result of opposition to a despotic governing body. This opposition grew stronger with imposed taxation and centralization by the foreign ruler. The Dutch Revolt that occurred {{as a result of this}} opposition <b>changed</b> <b>forever</b> the structure of the Netherlands. Known as the Eighty Years War, the revolt lasted between 1568 and 1648 and allowed for the beginning of the formation of a sense of nationality and at about the middle of the 16th century, people no longer described themselves as inhabitants of one of the Provinces, but simply as Belga or Flamengus both signifying Netherlander. An awareness of a common nationality started to emerge as people began to identify themselves with a national group rather than with local interests.|$|E

[...] Mason thought that Chris might be able to forgive Josh in the future, but it would be [...] "a long process", and he would {{have to deal with the}} fact that his life had <b>changed</b> <b>forever</b> due to the attack first. Mason added that Chris would have difficulties accepting that someone like Josh attacked him.|$|E
