40|$|Two genetic {{procedures}} {{were used to}} obtain amino acid replacements in the ZucZ-encoded P-galactosidase in Escherichia coli. Amino acid replacements could be obtained without regard to their effects on lactase activity by selecting spontaneous mutations that relieved the strong polarity of six nonsense mutations. When streaked on MacConkey-lactose indicator plates,- 75 % of these mutants gave strong red lactose-fermenting colonies, and 25 % gave white nonfermenting colonies. Mutants from 11 other nonsense codons were isolated directly using MacConkey-lactose indicator plates, on which positive <b>color</b> <b>indication</b> requires only 0. 5 % of the wild-type lactase activity.

Verbal signs are presented by lexical units, nominating agents, clients, non/material resources, artifacts, processes, incentives and forms of pedagogical influence. The non-verbal signs include paralinguistic signs (gestures, facial expressions, postures of the participants of the educational process); color-semiotic signs (coloremas), in which the information-impacting vector is directed to a <b>color</b> <b>indication</b> of messages that is important for successful educational communication; visual elements representing traditional British values and concepts; sound signs, topographic signs, that add meaning to the overall significance of a mixed sign.

40|$|Subject of Research. The {{influence}} of radiation spectra {{from the source}} of artificial night light on colorimetric characteristics of image perceived by the pilot in the aircraft cockpit has been studied. The image is displayed on the LCD screen of multifunctional <b>color</b> <b>indication</b> equipment unit. Night illumination of the cockpit is performed {{with the use of}} artificial lamps of red, green, blue and, rarely, white light. Method. Any given color to be displayed on the screen is perceived by an observer differently with presence and absence of external illumination. When external light of white color is used, perceived color depends upon color temperature of the light source; if illumination source has any arbitrary spectral characteristics, then perceivable color depends upon whole spectral content of the used source. The color, perceived by an observer, is formed as the mixture of the color displayed on the screen (image element color) with the color presented by diffuse reflection of external illumination source {{from the surface of the}} screen. The brightness of both colors is added. Mathematical expressions, that define calculation rule for chromaticity coordinates of color perceived by an observer, are based on the Grassmann’s law of additive color mixing. Quantitative analysis of the effect, caused by radiation spectra from an external source of artificial light on color gamut area, corresponding to image, perceived by an observer, has been performed through simulation in MathCad 15. 0. Main Results. It was shown, that the color palette of on-board indication equipment, obtained on automated working place for any preset source of external illumination of fluorescent spectrum, corresponding to white light, is not usable correctly in the aircraft night flight mode. An observer loses ability to perceive properly saturated primary colors of red and blue in the case of green-blue light source of external illumination; and the same issue occurs with green and blue for red light source. Using of sources with high illumination level of “warm” white color causes significant shift of the colors perceived by an observer, from the area of saturated blue and green colors in the direction towards the white point defined by illumination source. Using the sources with high illumination level of smooth white color and also with the white color, which white point coordinates coincide with the white point coordinates the color gamut triangle of the tested screen, lead to offset of colors, perceived by an observer, equally for each primary color (red, green, blue) and yellow, cyan and magenta as well. And finally, dealing with sources with high illumination level of “cold” white color, significant offset of colors, perceived by an observer, occurs; those seeming colors are drifting from the area of saturated red and green colors in the direction towards the white point defined by illumination source. Practical Relevance. The results are usable by developers of indication equipment and the manufacturers of LCD panels for colorimetric calculations with account of an {{influence of}} external illumination with various spectral content on the screen...|$|E

The total microbial load should not exceed 6 – 7 log CFU g− 1 mesophilic counting and be free of human pathogens. Not much is known about specific interactions between the levels of specific spoilage micro-organisms and the sensorial quality attributes of the fresh-cut product. We studied the changes in sensorial quality attributes and the growth and population dynamics of microorganisms in three independent batches of MA packed fresh-cut iceberg lettuce stored at 7 °C. The sensorial quality of the fresh-cut product was daily evaluated by visual determination of <b>color,</b> shape (<b>indication</b> of crispness) and discoloration (browning); together these attributes were translated into an Overall Visual Quality (OVQ) value. In addition, off-odour and sourness production were scored immediately after opening of the bags. Samples of the fresh-cut product were taken to determine the total microbial load and to investigate the bacterial species composition using mass sequencing analysis. The decrease of OVQ over time showed a down sigmoid curve, reaching the limit of consumer acceptance after about eight days. Total bacterial counts increased from about 5 log at day 1 to about 8 log colony forming units (CFU) per gram at day 7. Initially, Pseudomonas species were dominant but when the package became anaerobic, lactic acid bacteria (LAB), in particular Leuconostoc spp. and Lactococcus spp. became more abundant and dominated the bacterial population.

In the present research, biological silver nanoparticle was synthesized extracellularly by using the fungus, Trichoderma longibrachiatum, where the cell filtrate of the fungus was used as a reducing and stabilizing agent in the process of nanoparticle synthesis. Different physical parameters such as fungal biomass concentration (1, 5, 10, 15, and 20  g), temperature (25, 28, and 33  °C), incubation time (0 – 120  h), and agitation (shaken or not shaken) were investigated, {{in order to determine the}} optimal conditions for nanoparticle biosynthesis. The stability and antifungal properties of the synthesized silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were also determined. Data revealed that a combination of 10  g fungal biomass, a reaction temperature of 28  °C, a 72 -h incubation time, and without shaking were the optimum conditions for the synthesis of the silver nanoparticles. Visual observation of brown <b>color</b> is an <b>indication</b> of silver nanoparticle production. UV–vis spectroscopy showed maximum absorption at 385  nm with the optimum conditions. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed the formation of monodispersed spherical shape with a mean diameter of 10  nm. Fourier transformation infrared (FTIR) showed bands at 1634.92 and 3269.31  cm− 1. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) supported that the Z-average size was 24.43 and 0.420 PdI value. Zeta potential showed −[*] 19.7  mV with a single peak. The AgNPs synthesized through this biosystem approach were relatively stable up to 2  months after synthesis. The use of AgNPs as antifungal led to significant reductions in the number of forming colonies for many plant pathogenic fungi, with efficiencies reaching up to 90 % against Fusarium verticillioides, Fusarium moniliforme, Penicillium brevicompactum, Helminthosporium oryzae, and Pyricularia grisea.

We utilized analyses of color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) {{to assess the}} role of moderate-luminosity AGNs in galaxy evolution. First, we confirm some previous results and extend them to higher redshifts, e. g., there is no apparent color bimodality for AGN hosts from z~ 0 - 2, but non-AGN galaxy color bimodality exists up to z~ 3; most AGNs reside in massive hosts and the AGN fraction rises strongly toward higher stellar mass up to z~ 2 - 3; and the colors of both AGN hosts and non-AGN galaxies become redder as the stellar mass increases up to z~ 2 - 3. Second, we {{point out that it}} is critical to use mass-matched samples to examine color-magnitude relations of AGN hosts and non-AGN galaxies. We show that for mass-matched samples up to z~ 2 - 3, AGN hosts lie in the same CMD region as non-AGN galaxies; i. e., there is no specific clustering of AGN hosts around the red sequence, the top of the blue cloud, or the green valley in between. The AGN fraction (~ 10 %) is mostly independent of host-galaxy <b>color,</b> providing an <b>indication</b> of the duty cycle of SMBH growth in typical massive galaxies. These results are in contrast to those obtained with non-mass-matched samples where there is apparent AGN clustering in the CMD and the AGN fraction generally increases as the color becomes redder. We also find, for mass-matched samples, that the SFRs of AGN hosts are typically a factor of ~ 2 - 3 larger than those of non-AGN galaxies at z~ 0 - 1, whereas this difference diminishes at z~ 1 - 3. Our results can be reasonably explained by two main ingredients, color-mass correlation and passive or secular evolution of galaxies; and thus tightly constrain any effects from moderate-luminosity AGN feedback upon color-magnitude properties over the ~ 80 % of cosmic time.

40|$|We extend color-magnitude {{relations}} for moderate-luminosity X-ray {{active galactic nucleus}} (AGN) hosts and non-AGN galaxies through the galaxy formation epoch (z ≈ 1 - 4) in the Chandra Deep Field-North and Chandra Deep Field-South (CDF-N and CDF-S, respectively; jointly CDFs) surveys. This study was enabled by the deepest available X-ray data from the 2 Ms CDF surveys as well as complementary ultradeep multiwavelength data in these regions. We utilized analyses of color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) to assess the role of moderate-luminosity AGNs in galaxy evolution. First, we confirm some previous results and extend them to higher redshifts, finding, for example, that (1) there is no apparent color bimodality (i. e., {{the lack of an}} obvious red sequence and blue cloud) for AGN hosts from z ≈ 0 to 2, but non-AGN galaxy color bimodality exists up to z ≈ 3 and the relative fraction of red-sequence galaxies generally increases as the redshift decreases (consistent with a blue-to-red migration of galaxies), (2) most AGNs reside in massive hosts and the AGN fraction rises strongly toward higher stellar mass, up to z ≈ 2 - 3, and (3) the colors of both AGN hosts and non-AGN galaxies become redder as the stellar mass increases, up to z ≈ 2 - 3. Second, we point out that, in order to obtain a complete and reliable picture, it is critical to use mass-matched samples to examine color-magnitude relations of AGN hosts and non-AGN galaxies. We show that for mass-matched samples up to z ≈ 2 - 3, AGN hosts lie in the same region of the CMD as non-AGN galaxies; i. e., there is no specific clustering of AGN hosts in the CMD around the red sequence, the top of the blue cloud, or the green valley in between. The AGN fraction (≈ 10 %) is mostly independent of host-galaxy <b>color,</b> providing an <b>indication</b> of the duty cycle of supermassive black hole growth in typical massive galaxies. These results are in contrast to those obtained with non-mass-matched samples where there is apparent AGN clustering in the CMD and the AGN fraction generally increases as the color becomes redder. We also find, for mass-matched samples, that the star formation rates of AGN hosts are typically a factor of ≈ 2 - 3 larger than those of non-AGN galaxies at z ≈ 0 - 1, whereas this difference diminishes at z ≈ 1 - 3. With mass-selection effects taken into account, we find that almost all of the results obtained in this work can reasonably be explained by two main ingredients, color-mass correlation (i. e., X-ray AGNs preferentially reside in massive galaxies that generally tend to be redder than less-massive galaxies) and passive or secular evolution of galaxies. Our results show that the presence of moderate-luminosity AGN activity does not {{have a significant effect on}} the colors of galaxies and thus tightly constrain any effects from moderate-luminosity AGN feedback upon color-magnitude properties over the ≈ 80 % of cosmic time during which most of galaxy formation occurred...|$|R
