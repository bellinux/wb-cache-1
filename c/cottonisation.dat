40|$|<b>Cottonisation</b> of flax {{not only}} makes flax usable for {{producing}} textiles, it also further divides the technical fibre into (bundles of) elementary fibres and removes partly the alkali-sensitive pectin and hemicellulose. An experimental investigation was performed to assess the characteristics of cottonised flax in fibre reinforced cementitious composites. The fibre and composite properties are compared with technical flax and PVA fibres. Strength/strain curves of the fibres and composites are compared to evaluate the mechanical performance. Not only tensile strength and stiffness but also first crack strength and peak stress, work of fracture as a measure for multiple cracking and the visual closure of individual cracks by self healing are analysed. <b>Cottonisation</b> of flax enhances modulus of elasticity, peak stress and strength at first crack of concrete, in comparison to technical flax fibres...|$|E
40|$|The latest {{researches}} in {{the field}} of flax fibres contributed significantly {{to the development of the}} sector and created new added value to these fibers by increasing their application possibilities. So far, the flax <b>cottonisation</b> methods have been focused on;adjusting the technical flax fibers to cotton spinning systems by modifying their physical-mechanical properties in the limits specific to cotton fibers in order to obtain finer and more flexible flax/cotton blended yams. This paper describes a cottonizing method that combines the effect of ultrasound with enzymes or/and emulsifying agents in order to obtain high quality cottonized flax fibers. The comparative study between the physical-mechanical properties of flax-cotton blended yarns obtained, from these fibers categories is used for method evaluation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Products from flax {{have the}} highest {{hygroscopic}} and other characteristics affecting {{the health of the}} people. Increased demand for flax products was also promoted by the development of new technologies of industrial processing (for example, <b>cottonisation</b> of the short flax fibres), discovery of new healing properties of flax seeds, etc. More than 90 % of the Latvian products from flax are exported to the countries of Western Europe and America. At the present time for an overwhelming majority of agricultural farms of Latvia more economical is the combine harvesting technology of flax. However, when the yields of the flax are higher than 4. 6 - 5. 0 t/ha and the output of one set of self-propelled machines exceeds 120 ha, the efficiency of the combine and the swath harvesting method is practically the same. Due to the increase in the prices of fuel and electric energy, the borderline between the equal economical efficiency will shift towards lower yields. Key word: flax production, harvesting methods, economical efficiency...|$|E
