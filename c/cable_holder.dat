All telecasts were produced by the team's longtime <b>cable</b> rights <b>holder,</b> Fox Sports Wisconsin.|$|R
50|$|The Carey Foster {{bridge is}} named after him: {{it is used to}} measure very low resistances, {{although}} {{it can be used to}} find, for example, small differences between large resistances. The bridge is in two parts: a slide wire, connected by thick copper <b>cables</b> to a <b>holder</b> for standard resistances.|$|R
40|$|Lightweight was a {{range of}} lights {{addressing}} the benefits of small-scale manufacturing and ecological concerns about transportation and materials, while also allowing the user an opportunity {{to contribute to the}} design. The series forms a significant stage in and extension to Boontje’s ongoing investigation into public and domestic lighting, from inexpensive consumer items for Habitat to the Swarovski-commissioned Blossom chandelier of 2001. Conventionally, products are resolved by the designer and can be little changed when they leave the factory. In Lightweight, the user’s contribution is the weight – stones the user has brought back from walks, books, ceramic plates, etc. – which in turn saves on the costs and potential waste arising from transporting a heavy base. Weight is increasingly acknowledged as an important factor in sustainable design (e. g. Hollington 2011). The range also exploited sustainable materials, such as bamboo grown in the UK and recycled metals and plastics. Boontje initially developed the collection using a series of drawings, tests and mock-ups. Analysing these, more refined models were created in the studio, and computer models were then made for prototyping. These were also used to generate the digital files for manufacturing by CNC wire bending and laser cutting. The final assembly took place in the studio, including binding the <b>cable</b> <b>holders</b> to the bamboo with copper wire by hand and screen printing graphics on the Tyvek lamp shade of the floor-standing light. The collection was exhibited as part of London Design Festival 2012, and widely discussed in design blogs around the world...|$|R

This includes the US transducer, <b>cable</b> and transducer <b>holder</b> (as far as possible) {{as well as all}} additional devices, which may be used during diagnostic or interventional procedures, such as US fusion sensors/cables, needle guides, etc. Regular deep cleaning of the entire US machine and environment is essential.|$|R
30|$|This {{includes}} the US transducer with handle, <b>cable</b> and transducer <b>holder</b> (as far as possible) {{as well as}} all additional devices which may be used during diagnostic or interventional procedures such as US fusion sensors/cables, needle guides (if reused), etc. Contamination of US equipment may be underestimated [40]. In particular, inadequately cleaned and disinfected needle guides have been associated with outbreaks of infection [41]. The use of single use needle guides is preferable to eliminate the risks associated with difficult to clean small bore devices.|$|R
50|$|Beginning this season, {{the newly}} {{launched}} YES Network began airing {{the regular season}} games taking over from MSG Network as <b>Cable</b> rights <b>holder</b> for these games until the 2001 season. The On-air team of Ken Singleton and Jim Kaat was moved from MSG to YES beginning this season, while Michael Kay as play-by-play commentator added beginning this season in addition to radio duties and they also added retired Right fielder Paul O'Neill and former Yankees pitcher David Cone as color commentators; in addition, the over-the-air Yankees games was moved from Fox owned and operated station WNYW to CBS owned and operated station WCBS-TV; Bobby Murcer remains as a play-by-play announcer for the games on over-the-air television; however, the Yankees over-the-air games will continued to aired nationally on the former through its network's sporting division via Baseball package this season. Also beginning this season, the radio broadcasts of Yankees games moved from WABC-AM to CBS Radio-owned AM station WCBS-AM in which its a sister to its over-the-air rights holder WCBS-TV in which will remain for 3 years until the 2004 season.|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} the {{characterization}} of two inverted coaxial Ge detectors {{in the context of}} being employed in future ^ 76 Ge neutrinoless double beta (0 νββ) decay experiments. It is an advantage that such detectors can be produced with bigger Ge mass as compared to the planar Broad Energy Ge detectors (BEGe) that are currently used in the GERDA 0 νββ decay experiment. This will result in lower background for the search of 0 νββ decay due to a reduction of <b>cables,</b> electronics and <b>holders.</b> The measured resolution near the ^ 76 Ge Q-value at 2039 keV is 2. 5 keV and their pulse-shape characteristics are similar to BEGe-detectors. It is concluded that this type of Ge-detector is suitable for usage in ^ 76 Ge 0 νββ decay experiments...|$|R
50|$|If {{the mine}} detonates at a {{distance}} from the ship, the change in water pressure causes the ship to resonate. This is frequently the most deadly type of explosion, if it is strong enough. The whole ship is dangerously shaken and everything on board is tossed around. Engines rip from their beds, <b>cables</b> from their <b>holders,</b> etc.. A badly shaken ship usually sinks quickly, with hundreds, or even thousands of small leaks all over the ship and no way to power the pumps. The crew fare no better, as the violent shaking tosses them around. This shaking is powerful enough to cause disabling injury to knees and other joints in the body, particularly if the affected person stands on surfaces connected directly to the hull (such as steel decks).|$|R
40|$|Beam Position Monitors (BPM) are an {{essential}} {{tool for the}} operation of an accelerator. Therefore BPM systems have to be already included from the beginning {{in the design of}} a new machine. This contribution describes {{the development of a new}} BPM system up to the operation with a focus on the mechanical design. It includes the collection of the requirements and boundary conditions which defines the kind of BPM system. Following the mechanical designing process is described where simulations are used to predict the signals. These results are input parameters for the design and optimization of the electronics. Several contributions are considered which can modify the BPM signal like feedhroughs, heating due to wake losses, <b>holders,</b> <b>cables</b> and so on. The steps from the design, the prototypes and series production including laboratory and test accelerator measurements up to the commissioning are described as well...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{advances}} have enabled fast {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) of solid materials. This development has opened up new applications for MRI, but, at the same time, uncovered new challenges. Previously, MRI-invisible materials like the housing of MRI detection coils are now readily depicted and either cause artifacts or lead to a decreased image resolution. In this contribution, we present versatile, multi-nuclear single and dual-tune MRI coils that stand out by (1) a low hydrogen content for high-resolution MRI of dry solids without artifacts; (2) a modular approach with exchangeable inductors of variable volumes to optimally enclose the given object; (3) low cost and low manufacturing effort {{that is associated with}} the modular approach; (4) accurate sample placement in the coil outside of the bore, and (5) a wide, single- or dual-tune frequency range that covers several nuclei and enables multinuclear MRI without moving the sample. The inductors of the coils were constructed from self-supporting copper sheets to avoid all plastic materials within or around the resonator. The components that were mounted at a distance from the inductor, including the circuit board, coaxial <b>cable</b> and <b>holder</b> were manufactured from polytetrafluoroethylene. Residual hydrogen signal was sufficiently well suppressed to allow 1 H-MRI of dry solids with a minimum field of view that was smaller than the sensitive volume of the coil. The SNR was found to be comparable but somewhat lower with respect to commercial, proton-rich quadrature coils, and higher with respect to a linearly-polarized commercial coil. The potential of the setup presented was exemplified by 1 H/ 23 Na high-resolution zero echo time (ZTE) MRI of a model solution and a dried human molar at 9. 4 T. A full 3 D image dataset of the tooth was obtained, rich in contrast and similar to the resolution of standard cone-beam computed tomography...|$|R
40|$|There is a {{huge range}} of work {{clothing}} {{on the market today}} that is designed for various professions with varying functionality requirements. Snickers Workwear, one of the leading brands in the workwear industry in Europe, has however identified both need and a lack of supply regarding work trousers especially designed for electricians. Electricians have a physically demanding job, which makes it necessary for their work equipment, including clothing, to meet certain requirements regarding both design and function. The purpose of this project has been to develop a pair of work trousers especially designed for electricians, by order of the Snickers Workwear at Hultafors Group AB. Focus has been laid on the design, function and location of pockets of the trousers, and that these will ease and improve the use and storage of tools and other equipment in a safe and ergonomic way. A pre study was performed {{in the beginning of the}} project, followed by a concept phase that included a study of ergonomics for electricians with focus on their work positions, movement patterns and storing of tools. In order to develop and generate new ideas within the project, a workshop was held with staff from Snickers Workwear. The ideas with the greatest potential was identified through a selection process and brought further into the concept phase, and by testing and building models the ideas were further developed and put together into one complete concept. That whole concept was then thoroughly analyzed with focus on both design and function and the final design and functions were illustrated in both drawings and functional prototypes. Finally the project resulted in a model of customized work trousers especially designed for electricians, with complementary braces, which regarding both appearance, function and comfort aims at creating more favorable and ergonomic conditions for every electrician's daily work. KEYWORDS: Ergonomics, storage, tool kit, holster pocket, dump pocket, <b>cable</b> tie <b>holder,</b> leg pocket, rips band system, electricians braces, basic wear, electricians trousers.
