40|$|AbstractThe {{application}} of minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) in grinding {{has emerged as}} an alternative for reducing the abundant flow of cutting fluids, thus achieving cleaner production. Although considered an innovative technique in grinding operations, its widespread application is hindered due primarily to the high heat generation and wheel pore clogging caused by machined chips, harming the final product quality and increasing tool wear on the machine. This study sought to improve MQL use in grinding. In addition to the conventional MQL injected at the wheel/workpiece interface, a compressed air jet was used to clean the mixture of MQL oil and machined chips from clogged wheel pores. Experiments were conducted using external cylindrical plunge grinding on AISI 4340 quenched and tempered steel, and a vitrified cubic boron nitrite (CBN) wheel. The cooling-lubrication methods employed were the conventional flood coolant application, MQL (without cleaning), and MQL with a <b>cleaning</b> <b>jet</b> directed at the wheel surface at different angles of incidence. The main goal of these experiments was to verify the viability of replacing the traditional abundant flow of cutting fluid with MQL and wheel cleaning. The analyses were conducted by measuring the following output variables of the process: workpiece surface roughness and roundness errors, diametrical wheel wear, acoustic emission generated by the process, and metallographic images of the ground surface and subsurface. Results show {{the positive effects of}} implementing the <b>cleaning</b> <b>jet</b> technique as a technological improvement of minimum quantity lubrication in grinding {{in order to reduce the}} usage of cutting fluids. The MQL technique with cleaning compressed air jet, for a specific angle of incidence (30 °), proved to be extremely efficient in the improvement of the surface quality and accurate workpiece shape; it also reduced wheel wear when compared to the other cooling-lubrication methods that were tested (without a <b>cleaning</b> <b>jet)</b> ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a selection of}} data from an investigation that was concerned with the heat transfer which occurs when an under-expanded jet impinges onto a heated cylindrical surface. The {{purpose of the study}} was to establish the thermal boundary conditions for calculating thermal stresses in heat transfer surfaces when subjected to high-speed <b>cleaning</b> <b>jets.</b> The heat transfer in the impingement zone of a high-speed jet is extremely high and when the presence of the surface interferes with the expansion of the jet, the radial and circumferential distributions of the heat transfer coefficient become complicated. If a highly under-expanded jet impinges upon the surface while the nozzle-to-surface spacing is small, z/Dâ�� 3, there is no longer a maximum stagnation heat transfer coefficient on the geometric axis of the jet, instead a stagnation 'ring' is formed with a radius of about one nozzle diameter. A selection of data is presented that shows how, particularly for z/D less than 10, the Nusselt number distribution has a very high peak value at, or near to, the geometric stagnation point and then falls away steeply in both the axial and circumferential directions. The high values of Nusselt number, and the large differences between the peak values on the front edge of the cylinder and the values at the rear of the cylinder, could lead to very substantial differential cooling rates and hence to significant thermal stresses being generated when high pressure air <b>cleaning</b> <b>jets</b> are used on high-temperature tubes. However, when the nozzle exit is placed more than 20 nozzle diameters away from the surface of the cylinder there is a significant reduction in the maximum Nusselt number and the overall distribution is much smoother; this will alleviate potential problems from thermal stresses.

40|$|Hot gas {{particulate}} filtration is a {{basic component}} in advanced power generation systems such as Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) and Pressurized Fluidized Bed Combustion (PFBC). These systems require effective particulate removal to protect the downstream gas turbine and also to meet environmental emission requirements. The ceramic barrier filter {{is one of the}} options for hot gas filtration. Hot gases flow through ceramic candle filters leaving ash deposited on the outer surface of the filter. A process known as surface regeneration removes the deposited ash periodically by using a high pressure back pulse <b>cleaning</b> <b>jet.</b> After this cleaning process has been done there may be some residual ash on the filter surface.

The cleaning done by this technique still leaves some residual ash on the filter surface, which {{over a period of}} time sinters, forms a solid cake and leads to mechanical failure of the candle filter. A room temperature testing facility (RTTF) was built to gain more insight into the surface regeneration process before testing commenced at high temperature. RTTF was instrumented to obtain pressure histories during the surface regeneration process and a high-resolution high-speed imaging system was integrated in order to obtain pictures of the surface regeneration process. The objective of this research has been to utilize the RTTF to study the surface regeneration process at the convenience of room temperature conditions. The face velocity of the fluidized gas, the regeneration pressure of the back pulse and the time to build up ash on the surface of the candle filter were identified as the important parameters to be studied. Two types of ceramic candle filters were used in the study.

H 577 M ME 2017 Hau 98 pages :color illustrationsElectrospun nylon- 6 {{nanofiber}} filter, with fiber diameters of 100 to 300 nm, {{has been}} used for nano-aerosols filtration. Despite the effectiveness of filtration, the aerosol loading capacity of the filter is low and pressure drop across the filter increases rapidly with aerosol loading. This study examines the effectiveness of backpulse and backblow cleaning on nanofiber depth filter loaded with challenging polydispersed nano-aerosols with 50 - 60 % less than 100 nm and maximum size less than 300 - 500 nm. To investigate filter regeneration, a series of backpulses followed by backblow at constant air velocity was applied ona loaded nanofiber filter with maximum allowable pressure drop across the filter set at 600 - 1000 Pa. The function of backpulse is to provide inertia to break-up the particle-particle locking as well as particle-fiber adhesion while backblow is to carry the loosened particles away from the filter. Due to the fragility of nanofiber, a tri-nozzle setup has been introduced in the cleaning system to distribute the cleaning air relatively uniform across the filter instead of a concentrated jet targeted {{at the center of the}} filter that can damage nanofibers there. To optimize the cleaning conditions, the effect of several key parameters has been investigated-pulse jet, flow durations, numbers of jet pulses, and applied pressure. Also, the filter properties, such as nanofiber diameteraffecting particle-fiber adhesion as well as particle capture, and nanofiber filter thickness affecting particle capture and filter capacity have been studied. Unfortunately, both have negative effects on filter cleaning by backpulse and backblow due to large adhesion force of particles to fibers for nanofiber filter with smaller fiber diameter and due to increasing recapture of loosened particles for a thick nanofiber filter, respectively. For multilayer nanofiber filter, two inhomogeneous filters have been tested. One filter was made from a combo filter with a thickermicrofiber layer upstream and a thinner nanofiber layer downstream. The second filter was made from a nanofiber layer with mean fiber diameter of 280 nm located upstream and another nanofiber layer with mean fiber diameter of 180 nm located downstream. The cleaning effectiveness of the multilayer nanofiber filter was compared with a filter with only single nanofiber layer. The multi-layering configurationcan reduce the skin effect during aerosolloading, however, during cleaning with reversed flowthe downstream microfiber layer provided damping to the <b>cleaning</b> <b>jet</b> undermining the cleaning effectiveness on the upstream nanofiberlayer when compared to the case with regenerating only single nanofiber layer filter. For the filter with two nanofiberlayers, the downstream nanofiber layer enhanced the recapture of loosen particles during cleaning. Further, the presence of the downstream nanofiber layer also compromised the cleaning effectiveness of the nanofiber upstream layerduring reverse flow cleaning. Cyclic filtration, involving both loading and cleaning, have been carried out in both single-layer and multilayer nanofiber filters. Both filter configurations have shown stable behavior in which the growth in residual pressure drop and the decrease in filtration cycle time were present primarily in the first filtration cycle (i. e. the conditioning phase) and subsequently both variables remained relatively constant thereafter. The pressure versus time during loading wasconvex upward for the first loading cycle (at times linear), but changed over to concave downward in subsequent cycles. This isdue to the dead pores of the filter being prefilledwith aerosols after the first loading and cleaning cycle. Department of Mechanical EngineeringM.

In an industrial setting, experimental study is performed to formulate the pressure characteristics. It has shown that the decay of stagnation pressure along the axial direction is linear. It also revealed that no cleaning is possible at radial locations greater than 1. 68 D from the centerline.
