25|$|The {{pulp mill}} came {{off on a}} poor start, with declining pulp prices. Most of the pulp was {{exported}} and director Henry Melhuus therefore proposed that Saugbrugsforeningen establish a paper mill. He hoped to reduce the volatility in revenue and that the company would do better in poor times. This resulted in {{a plan for a}} paper mill with two paper machines with a combined capaicty of 10,000 tonnes, a new electrical pulp mill with an annual capacity of 12,000 tonnes, an expansion of the <b>chemical</b> <b>pulp</b> mill and an expansion of the power station. Total investments were NOK4 million.|$|E
25|$|By the 1900s {{the company}} had {{challenges}} making ends meet. The company therefore in 1905 initiated a program to totally revamp its operations. The three head saw mills were demolished and replaced with a new, steam-powered head saw mill adjacent to the edger mill. The pulp mill was expanded to handle 15,000 tones annually, powered by the new Tistedalsfossen Power Station. Finally a new <b>chemical</b> <b>pulp</b> mill was to be built at Kaken. A complicating factor for the power station was that the company only owned {{about two-thirds of the}} waterfall rights. Finally the Tista Canal was built, allowing direct access from Kaken to the port.|$|E
25|$|Norske Skog's board {{decided in}} December 1990 {{to close the}} sulfite pulp mill and build a new {{magazine}} paper machine, PM6. The decision to terminate cellulose production was both caused by the environmental impact {{as well as by}} a steady diminishing demand for <b>chemical</b> <b>pulp.</b> The recession following the dissolution of the Soviet Union meant that exports to Eastern Europe were decimated. Meanwhile, new production technologies for paper had less demand for cellulose. The closing resulted in a loss of 210 jobs, of which 25 were transferred to PM6 and 50 were retired early. Construction of the new mill took place at Skakkestad, to the northeast of the main facility. Originally PM6 was proposed to produce light weight coated paper, but after Stora bought the technological partner Feldmühle, PM6 had to revert to supercalender.|$|E
40|$|Biological pulping (biological pre{{treatment}}) {{has been}} an area {{where it has been}} stated {{that there is a need}} for a “breakthrough technology”. Biological pulping is the treatment of lignocellulosic materials with oxidative lignin-degrading microorganism enzymes prior to pulping process. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of different biomass concentration on biological pretreatment to <b>chemical</b> <b>pulping</b> process. By using three different concentrations of biomass (B 1, B 2 and B 3) banana stem waste will be treated through biological pretreatment. Treated banana stem waste will be proceeding to <b>chemical</b> <b>pulping</b> process. Untreated banana stem waste as control will also experienced <b>chemical</b> <b>pulping</b> process through the same conditions. Compositions of lignin, cellulose and glucose have been analyzed before and after biological pretreatment and after <b>chemical</b> <b>pulping</b> process by using different method and procedures. From this study, the higher biomass concentration gives the higher percentage of lignin degradation. Biological pretreatment shows the positive response to <b>chemical</b> <b>pulping</b> process where banana stem waste that have been treat in biological pretreatment process degrade the lignin in the short period of time in <b>chemical</b> <b>pulping</b> process where it takes only 30 minutes to degrade the lignin compare to 2 hours <b>chemical</b> <b>pulping</b> processes that have been stated in the literature review. This result shows that biological pretreatment helps to reduce time and energy consumption in <b>chemical</b> <b>pulping</b> process...|$|R

2500|$|The {{power station}} was {{completed}} in 1907, and the following year the sulfite process <b>chemical</b> <b>pulp</b> mill was completed the following year. All the upgrades were finalized in 1910, having cost NOK4.1 million—twice the budget. A particular contributor was the pulp mill, which had cost NOK3 million.

There was a certain political opposition, especially in the Conservative Party, with concerns that {{it would lead to}} an overdemand for lumber. The second machine, PM2, received political approval, and was approved by the annual meeting on 10 April 1964. The extra NOK75 in funding was secured through issuing additional shares, bringing the share equity to NOK64 million. The rest was borrowed.|$|E

50|$|<b>Chemical</b> <b>pulps,</b> such {{as those}} from the kraft process or sulfite pulping, contain much less lignin than {{mechanical}} pulps, (<5% compared to approximately 40%). The goal in bleaching <b>chemical</b> <b>pulps</b> is to remove essentially all of the residual lignin, hence the process {{is often referred to}} as delignification. Sodium hypochlorite (household bleach) was initially used to bleach <b>chemical</b> <b>pulps,</b> but was largely replaced in the 1930s by chlorine. Concerns about the release of organochlorine compounds into the environment prompted the development of Elemental Chlorine Free (ECF) and Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) bleaching processes.|$|R

50|$|To make pulp from wood, a <b>chemical</b> <b>pulping</b> process {{separates}} lignin from cellulose fibres. This {{is accomplished}} by dissolving lignin in a cooking liquor, so {{that it may be}} washed from the cellulose; this preserves the length of the cellulose fibres. Paper made from <b>chemical</b> <b>pulps</b> are also known as wood-free papers-not to be confused with tree-free paper; this is because they do not contain lignin, which deteriorates over time. The pulp can also be bleached to produce white paper, but this consumes 5% of the fibres; <b>chemical</b> <b>pulping</b> processes are not used to make paper made from cotton, which is already 90% cellulose.|$|R

50|$|<b>Chemical</b> <b>pulping</b> {{involves}} dissolving lignin {{in order}} to extract the cellulose from the wood fiber. The different processes of <b>chemical</b> <b>pulping</b> include the Kraft process, which uses caustic soda and sodium sulfide and is the most common; alternatively, the use of sulfurous acid {{is known as the}} sulfite process, the neutral sulfite semichemical is treated as a third process separate from sulfite, and soda pulping which is the least ecologically hazardous utilizing sodium hydroxide or anthraquinone.|$|R
40|$|The {{influences}} of pulp type, content of acidic groups (i. e., sulfonic and carboxylic groups) in CTMP, kappa number (i. e., residual lignin content) of un{{bleached kraft pulp}}, and beating degree of bleached kraft pulp on the conductivity of polyaniline (PAn) -coated conductive paper were investigated. The amounts of PAn coated on <b>chemical</b> <b>pulps</b> were higher than those coated on high yield pulps, and the surface resistivities of conductive papers prepared from <b>chemical</b> <b>pulps</b> were lower than those prepared from high yield pulps. As the substrates {{for the production of}} PAn-coated conductive paper, bleached <b>chemical</b> <b>pulps</b> were better than unbleached <b>chemical</b> <b>pulps.</b> The conductivity had a significant positive linear correlation with the amount of PAn coated. The amount of PAn coated increased with increasing content of sulfonic groups in CTMP or decreasing kappa number of unbleached kraft pulp. We hypothesized that this might be associated with the ionizability of acidic groups and the inhibiting effect of lignin on aniline polymerization. The beating degree of pulp seemed to have an insignificant effect on the conductivity of PAn-coated conductive paper. As a whole, the interpretations of the influence of the chemical composition are based on proposed ideas and need to be confirmed by future experimental work...|$|R
40|$|Pulping is {{the term}} used for the process which {{separates}} wood fibers. <b>Chemical</b> <b>pulping,</b> dissolving the lignin in the wood to create a pulp, is {{the most commonly used}} <b>pulping</b> process. <b>Chemical</b> <b>pulping</b> creates higher sheet strength than mechanical pulping; however, yields 40 to 50 percent pulp, where mechanical pulping yields 95 percent pulp. The two main types of <b>chemical</b> <b>pulping</b> are the more common sulfate pulping (most commonly known as Kraft pulping) and sulfite pulping. Kraft pulping accommodates a variety of tree species, recovers and reuses all <b>pulping</b> <b>chemicals,</b> and creates a paper with a higher sheet strength. Sulfite pulp, however, is easier to bleach, yields more bleached pulp, and is easier to refine for papermaking. The major difference between the two types of <b>chemical</b> <b>pulping</b> is the types of chemicals used to dissolve the lignin. This report will focus mainly on these two types of <b>chemical</b> <b>pulping</b> and bleach plants. Pulp mills are one of the largest emission sources in Washington and a large toxic pollutant emission producer. There are eight pulp mills in Washington: six Kraft (sulfate) mills and two sulfite mills (one sulfite mill has recently closed). EPA formally adopted MACT in April 1998 for certain pulping processes. Sources will have between 3 and 8 years to come into compliance with the provisions of the MACT. Emissions estimations made after MACT has become effective should be sure to take emissions limitations due to MACT into account. The MACT provisions are found in Part 63, Subpart S, sections 63. 440 - 63. 459 of the Code of Federal Regulations. MACT requirements for combustion sources at pulp and paper mills will be subject to a separate MACT.
