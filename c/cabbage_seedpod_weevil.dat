50|$|Climatic models show northward {{shifts in}} the ecozones of Saskatchewan, {{creating}} more agricultural land. The increased area with favourable climates to host insects will allow for a significant spread of more invasive species. An invasive species that is already damaging crops in Saskatchewan is the <b>cabbage</b> <b>seedpod</b> <b>weevil.</b> This insect is native to Europe and arrived in North America in 1930. The weevil reached Saskatchewan in 2000 only five years after being recorded in Lethbridge, Alberta. The current dispersal rates at current temperatures are 55-km/ year. At this rate, predictions show the weevil spreading right across Canada with detrimental effects on crops.|$|E
40|$|Previous identifications in North America of Trichomalus perfectus (Walker, 1835) and Mesopolobus morys (Walker, 1848) (Chalcidoidea: Pteromalidae), the {{principal}} chalcid parasitoids of the <b>cabbage</b> <b>seedpod</b> <b>weevil</b> (Ceutorhynchus obstrictus Marsham, 1802) in Europe, are {{shown to be}} misidentifications of Trichomalus lucidus (Walker, 1835) and Mesopolobus (Xenocrepis) moryoides sp. nov., respectively. Necremnus duplicatus Gahan, 1941 (Chalcidoidea: Eulophidae) is synonymized formally under Necremnus tidius (Walker, 1839) syn. nov., confirming a previous, tentative synonymy. Both sexes of N. tidius, M. moryoides, and T. lucidus are illustrated and {{compared with those of}} similar species using macrophotography and scanning electron microphotography. Hypotheses are offered to explain why {{the principal}} chalcid parasitoids of the <b>cabbage</b> <b>seedpod</b> <b>weevil</b> differ between North America and Europe and how the three treated species came to be in North Americ...|$|E
40|$|Winter canola acreage {{in central}} and eastern Washington {{continues}} to increase as more producers learn about the rotational benefits and potential profitability of canola in predominantly cereal-based rotations. With more acres in production, insect pests common in other canola-growing regions of the US and Canada are now being observed in the Pacific Northwest (PNW). While many of the pests are not at thresholds to warrant control measures, the <b>cabbage</b> <b>seedpod</b> <b>weevil,</b> Ceutorhynchus obstrictus (Marsham), is becoming a problem in some areas of Washington State...|$|E
40|$|The {{methodology}} contains {{description of}} biological methods {{for evaluation of}} pest resistance to zoocides arranged according to world standards. The methods are verified on case studies on pests with proved resistance to insecticides or with high risk of selection of resistance in Czechia, as pollen beetle, Colorado potato beetle, <b>cabbage</b> <b>seedpod</b> <b>weevil,</b> {{cabbage stem flea beetle}} and codling moth. The methodology contains survey of basic principles of insect resistance management and proposals of antiresistant strategies for pest mentioned in the case studies. The methods for evaluation of resistance are utilized for resistance monitoring performed by state administration or other organisations. Recommendations given in antiresistant strategies are utilized for pest management in winter rape, potatoes and apples...|$|E
40|$|The {{economic}} {{importance of}} the <b>cabbage</b> <b>seedpod</b> <b>weevil,</b> Ceutorhynchus obstrictus (Marsham), increased rapidly in the prairies of western Canada following its discovery in canola near Lethbridge in 1995. Since 1999 outbreaks have occurred almost annually over thousands of hectares of cropland, necessitating applications of vast quantities of chemical insecticide. Both larvae and adults can damage the crop, with larvae developing within pods and feeding on seeds and adults feeding through pod pericarp {{late in the season}} to further reduce yield and quality. The development of sustainable control strategies has proceeded in several directions, including chemical, cultural, plant resistance, and biological control, and successes in each area have facilitated development of an integrated management approach for this pest. The chemical insecticide compounds and formulations with greatest effectiveness for reducing both adult and larval densities through foliar sprays and seed treatments were identified. Trap crop technology was tested under prairie field conditions, and seeding date recommendations were determined. New canola germplasm was produced that expresses both antibiotic and antixenotic (non-preference) resistance to the weevil. The mechanism of resistance was unraveled for the new germplasm, and has identified two key glucosinolate compounds that affect weevil behavior; these can drive future plant breeding programs to develop additional weevil-resistant germplasm. The species compositions and impact of indigenous natural enemies of the weevil were determined, and studies were conducted to assess European natural enemies for possible introduction to North America in a classical biological control program. Although the <b>cabbage</b> <b>seedpod</b> <b>weevil</b> remains {{an important component of the}} insect pest fauna of prairie canola crops, the knowledge now exists to enable producers to manage this pest in a sustainable manner...|$|E
40|$|Entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium anisopliae {{is one of}} {{the most}} common species used in {{biological}} control against pests. The thesis is analyzing effectiveness of original strains and continuously passaged strains of M. anisopliae through nutrient substrates and different developmental stages mealworm (Tenebrio molitor). For original and continuously passaged strains were also evaluated the growth and spore production at different temperatures cultivation. In this thesis was investigated the efficacy of the original strains of M. anisopliae on selected economically important pests. Strains were tested on populations of adults Pollen beetles (Meligethes aeneus) and <b>Cabbage</b> <b>seedpod</b> <b>weevil</b> (Ceutorhynchus obstrictus) and the eggs of Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata) in laboratory conditions. Other entomopathogenic fungi were tested on the eggs of Colorado potato beetle eggs...|$|E
40|$|In any {{biological}} control program, {{it is important}} to have an in-depth knowledge of the ecosystem. Competition between natural enemies can have unpredictable effects, potentially disrupting {{biological control}} of the pest in question. Trichomalus perfectus and Mesopolobus morys are two parasitoids of the <b>cabbage</b> <b>seedpod</b> <b>weevil.</b> Both are candidates for introduction as classical biological control agents in Canada. I examined the effects of intra- and interspecific parasitoid competition in field and laboratory experiments. I found that a multiple-species introduction would not be more effective at controlling pest populations than a single-species introduction. I also found T. perfectus produced a female-biased offspring sex ratio in response to intraspecific competition. Using a theoretical approach, I explored how this shift might affect parasitoid-host population dynamics and biological control, incorporating the influence of increased virginity in the parasitoid population...|$|E
40|$|In Europe, Ceutorhynchus turbatus Schultze and Ceutorhynchus typhae (Herbst) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) feed on {{seeds from}} hoary cress and shepherd's purse (Cardaria draba (L.) Desv. and Capsella bursa-pastoris (L.) Medik.); both plants are {{invasive}} in North America. In North America, C. turbatus {{is a candidate}} for biological control of hoary cress, C. typhae is adventive, and both are sympatric with <b>cabbage</b> <b>seedpod</b> <b>weevil</b> (Ceutorhynchus obstrictus (Marsham)), an invasive alien pest of canola (Brassica napus L. and Brassica rapa L., Brassicaceae). We investigated host associations among C. turbatus, C. typhae, and their parasitoids in Europe. Of particular interest was host specificity of Trichomalus perfectus (Walker) and Mesopolobus morys (Walker) (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae), candidates for biological control of C. obstrictus in North America. We found no evidence that T. perfectus attacks C. turbatus or C. typhae; however, M. morys was the most common parasitoid associated with C. turbatu...|$|E
40|$|This work aims to {{find out}} the {{presence}} of the resistant population (sub-population) of <b>cabbage</b> <b>seedpod</b> <b>weevil.</b> The collection of beetles took place from April to July in the years 2013 - 2014 all over the Czech Republic. Resistance was tested for two active substances: lambda-cyhalotrin from the group of pyrethroids and thiacloprid (Biscaya 240 OD) from the group of neonicotinoids. Both active substances were tested in 21 locations. The methodics of the IRAC organization was followed in the tests. It was found that the active substances lambda-cyhalotrin had 100 % efficiency in both years, while Biscaya 240 OD (active substance thiacloprid) had reduced efficiency in the year 2013 - between 93 and 100 %. So far the efficacy of the substances has been high; we should, however, stick to antiresistant strategies and alternate between active substances from various groups of active substances with different mechanisms of action...|$|E
40|$|Four {{species of}} Mesopolobus Westwood were reared as parasitoids of Ceutorhynchinae hosts in Europe during surveys in 2000 - 2004. An {{illustrated}} key {{is given to}} differentiate the four species, M. gemellus Baur & Muller sp. n., M. incultus (Walker), M. morys (Walker) and M. trasullus (Walker), plus M. moryoides Gibson, a parasitoid of the <b>cabbage</b> <b>seedpod</b> <b>weevil,</b> Ceutorhynchus obstrictus (Marsham), in North America. Pteromalus clavicornis Walker is recognized as a junior synonym of M. incultus syn. n., and Pteromalus berecynthos Walker (also a junior synonym of M. incultus) is considered a correct original spelling. For Disema pallipes Förster (a junior synonym of Mesopolobus morys), a lectotype is designated. Mesopolobus morys is {{for the first time}} accurately associated with the seed weevil Ceutorhynchus turbatus (Schultze), a potential agent for classical biological control, of hoary cress, Lepidium draba L. (Brassicaceae), in North America. Mesopolobus gemellus is associated with another seed weevil, Ceutorhynchus typhae (=C. floralis) (Herbst), in pods of shepherd's purse, Capsella bursa-pastoris (L.) Medik. (Brassicaceae). Implications of the host-parasitoid associations are discussed relative to the introduction of species to North America for classical biological control of the cabbage seedpod weevi...|$|E
40|$|The ceutorhynchine weevils Hadroplontus litura (F.) and Microplontus edentulus (Schultze) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), are {{established}} in North America as biological control agents for Canada thistle, Cirsium arvense (L.) Scop., and scentless chamomile, Tripleurospermum perforatum (Mérat) M. Lainz (Asteraceae), respectively. In North America, both weeds occur sympatrically and in similar habitats as another ceutorhynchine, Ceutorhynchus obstrictus (Marsham) (<b>cabbage</b> <b>seedpod</b> <b>weevil),</b> an important pest of canola, Brassica napus L., and Brassica rapa L. (Brassicaceae). Ceutorhynchinae weevils released to control weeds in cultivated crops {{may serve as}} alternate hosts if agents released for biological control of C. obstrictus are not specific to that species. Parasitoids associated with M. edentulus and H. litura inflict similar levels of mortality on their hosts, yet a single species {{was associated with the}} latter host, whereas 13 species attacked the former. The stem-mining M. edentulus appears to be at some risk but not the root-crown feeding H. litura, should the parasitoids Trichomalus perfectus (Walker) and Mesopolobus morys (Walker) (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae) be introduced as biological control agents of the silique-feeding C. obstrictus. These findings suggest that feeding niche may be an important criterion for developing a nontarget species test list for host-range testing of potential biological control agent...|$|E
