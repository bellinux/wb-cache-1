The collision destroyed a signal box and killed a railwayman working there. Both drivers were hurt. 34 freight cars, one locomotive, tracks and overhead wires were damaged.

50|$|Due to the ageing infrastructure, normal {{operation}} is made difficult by chronic power shortages and poor state of infrastructure maintenance. Sleepers, tunnels and bridges {{are in a}} critically poor state of repair. Tracks are laid on either wooden or concrete sleepers, using rails of 37, 40, 50, 60 kg/m (75, 81, 101, 121 lb/yd) of domestic, Chinese and Russian manufacture. Riverine gravel and <b>crushed</b> stone <b>ballast</b> is used. Tunnels are of concrete construction; many are in poor condition, having been built during the colonial era. Communications equipment and the semi-automatic signalisation infrastructure dates to the 1970s, and was imported from China and the Soviet Union. The poor state of the infrastructure severely restricts operational speeds - average train speeds are as low as 20 km/h-60 km/h (in South Korea 60 km/h-100 km/h on non-high speed lines): only on the P'yŏngbu Line are speeds of 100 km/h possible.|$|R

This also serves to hold the track in place as the trains roll by.

Since shortly after its settlement in the early 19th century, Le Roy had supported several such operations. Most of the limestone had been produced for architectural use, and a number of extant buildings in the Le Roy area, including the Lathrop Chapel at Machpelah Cemetery, are made of locally quarried limestone.|$|R
40|$|The {{operation}} of railway track {{is likely to}} involve the presence of solid contaminants on the line at some stage. This may be from the dispersion of freight goods such as coal or minerals, or the presence of ballast stone thrown on to the track either by {{the passage of the}} train or during ballast cleaning operations. In addition, where a driver experiences low traction (particularly on steep or liquid-contaminated track), sand may be deliberately placed on the track surface to improve traction. Railway track in dessert areas is also known to suffer from severe wear induced by wind-borne sand particles. The effect of these contaminants is of concern since they may cause damage and accelerated wear of both track and wheel. This paper attempts to examine the effect of brittle contaminant materials on the wear of railway track. A series of small-scale laboratory experiments has been carried out in which <b>crushed</b> granite <b>ballast</b> is fed into a rolling-sliding contact. The level of surface damage is shown to be slight and generally insignificant when compared to normal rail roughness. However, the repeated entrainment of solid particles can lead to excessive wear. An attempt has been made to quantify this wear process and to develop a simple empirical model...|$|R

The KNI 140070 viaduct of span length 14. 40 m with ballasted track was selected as a representative for the study. Two variants of the viaduct were taken into consideration – a version operated before the modernization in 2008 and the modernized version including additional flats welded to the bottom flanges of the main beams. The German high-speed train ICE- 3 moving at 150 – 300 km/h was selected. The FE model of the BTT system was developed using Altair HyperMesh and LS-PrePost software. The platform of the viaduct was modelled using 8 -node 48 DOF solid elements. The structure was symmetrised, homogenized and reflected by linear viscoelastic orthotropic materials. Discrete model of the track included the main and side rails, fastening systems, sleepers, <b>crushed</b> stone <b>ballast</b> and approach RC slabs. Components of the train FE model were considered as rigid bodies. Cylindrical and revolute constrained joints were applied for kinematic connections and relations between respective components. Discrete springs and dampers were applied for FE modelling of the primary and the secondary suspension systems.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{analysis}} is to evaluate the factors affecting the longevity of emplacement drift ground support materials {{and to develop a}} basis for selection of materials for ground support that will function throughout the preclosure period. The Development Plan (DP) for this analysis is given in CRWMS M&O (Civilian Radioactive Waste Management System Management and Operating Contractor) (1999 a). The candidate materials for ground support are steel (carbon steel, ductile cast iron, galvanized steel, and stainless steel, etc.) and cement. Steel will mainly be used for steel sets, lagging, channels, rock bolts, and wire mesh. Cement usage is only considered in the case of grouted rock bolts. The candidate materials for the invert structure are steel and <b>crushed</b> rock <b>ballast.</b> The materials shall be evaluated for the repository emplacement drift environment under a specific thermal loading condition based on the proposed License Application Design Selection (LADS) design. The analysis consists of the following tasks: (1) Identify factors affecting the longevity of ground control materials for use in emplacement drifts. (2) Review existing documents concerning behavior of candidate ground control materials during the preclosure period. The major criteria to be considered for steel are mechanical and thermal properties, and durability, of which corrosion is the most important concern.

40|$|Laboratory {{testing of}} railway ballast poses {{practical}} difficulties because the particle size is often {{too large for}} most standard apparatus. There are therefore advantages in developing a scaled material whose behavior {{is representative of the}} full size material. A first stage in validating such an approach is to investigate whether the particle shape is affected by the change in scale. This paper sets out methods for evaluating form and roundness (aspects of shape) and proposes a new measure for evaluating roundness, termed ellipseness. These methods are then applied to a <b>crushed</b> rock railway <b>ballast</b> over a range of particle sizes. Statistical analysis demonstrates a measurable variation in the distributions of form and roundness with particle size over a range of sieve intervals, although the differences are slight and do not necessarily rule out the use of a scaled material for investigating the factors influencing macro mechanical behavior...|$|R

At Highbridge Yard, the train followed the track as it merged onto those used by Metro-North Railroad's Hudson Line commuter rail service from Grand Central Station to points along the east bank of the Hudson River as far north as Poughkeepsie. It was one of four such waste trains that regularly use the Hudson Line's tracks each night; two northbound with full containers and two southbound returning the emptied ones.There are generally two tracks along this stretch, both electrified with third rails for Metro-North's electric multiple unit trains serving the stations along the Hudson Line south of Croton-Harmon in Westchester County.

40|$|Purpose. The article {{deals with}} the {{insulation}} resistance of the track circuit {{as one of the}} parameters that affect the operating performance of the railway transport. To reduce the influence of the insulation resistance on the operation modes of the track circuits and the performance indicators of railway transport it is assumed to study the influence of crushed stone treatment on the value of dielectric permeability of the ballast bed. Methodology. The influence of material type for the surface treatment of crushed stone on the value of the dielectric permeability was assessed {{on the basis of the}} physical nature determination of the relative dielectric permeability. Determination of the relative dielectric permeability of granular media can only be indirect, as a consequence of incomplete adjoining of crushed stone grains and uncertainty of the pore volume. Thus, the calculations were performed by comparing the measured capacity for a medium with the known with measured medium capacity, for which it is necessary to define. That is, the more the measured capacity is changed, the more changes the dielectric permeability of the medium. Findings. Sleepers and ballast significantly change their electrical conductivity depending on the presence of moisture, ambient temperature changes, the presence of pollutants and other factors. The article analyzes the existing models to describe the dielectric properties of such systems. It has been established that coating the <b>crushed</b> stone <b>ballast</b> with organic substances influences the value of its relative dielectric permeability. The greatest effect of reducing this value is observed for the coatings based on rosin mixture and silicone. Originality. Authors proposed original method of dielectric properties increase of the permanent way by grains’ coating with nonwettable substances, on the surface of which is not formed a water film. Practical value. The article shows the possibility of minimizing the negative influence of reducing the isolation with maximum its elimination. It is proposed the solution of actual problem by eliminating the influence of insulation resistance on the modes of track circuits operation, which will eliminate the part of causes of the failure of signaling devices and reduce the number of cases of «false business»...|$|R
5000|$|During 1834-1840, Robinson {{served as}} chief {{engineer}} {{of the new}} Philadelphia and Reading Railroad and directed construction of the line including a spectacular stone bridge and a tunnel 1,932 feet long, considered his crowning achievements. The 93-mile railroad built from the major anthracite coal fields of Pottsville to Reading {{and then to the}} port at Philadelphia was the first double track mainline in the United States (after the British model), included three of the nine first railroad tunnels in the United States, and was reportedly the first to use <b>crushed</b> stone <b>ballast.</b> (In 1828-9, Robinson had designed his first railroads—the Allegheny Portage and the Danville & Pottsville railroads—as double track lines, but these included inclines that worked better with two tracks; the Reading was the first main line designed at the outset with double tracks in mind, though with only a 22' wide grade that required widening later). Because of the extensive coal fields it tapped, the Reading would {{become one of the most}} profitable railroads in the U. S. It was also considered Moncure Robinson’s first mountain railroad without inclines—a statement about the transition from the Canal Era of feeder coal roads to water transport/canals. The Reading paralleled the Schuylkill River navigation canal, and by the 1840s proved the superiority of the railroad over the turnpikes and canals as the inland transportation system of the nineteenth century.Horses and mules, gravity and stationary steam engines on inclines, were the first motive power on Moncure Robinson’s railroads. Though he held patents on incline systems, from the beginning, he recommended British built locomotives for railroads, especially the recently perfected 0-4-0s with Bury fire box. By the mid-1830s, American mechanics had perfected the 4-2-0, with its lead swivel truck or pilot wheels - designed by John B Jervis for the Mohawk & Hudson - and Robinson recommended these for steeper grade railroads during the late 1830s, in Virginia and Pennsylvania. For the Reading, he ordered British and American made locomotives. For more power, however, he is credited with helping design in 1839 one of the earliest 4-4-0 locomotives, the [...] "Gowan & Marx," [...] named after his London banker. This, the most powerful locomotive up to that time, was built by Eastwick & Harrison of Philadelphia, and proved ideal for the coal fields tapped by the Reading (John White, American Locomotives, correctly credits others for the 4-4-0 design patent; and this is true for the mechanics of the machine, but the concept of replacing the then dominant 4-2-0s with the better tractive 4-4-0s, which would become the major locomotive type for the next thirty years or more, has been shared with Robinson).|$|R
50|$|Pfeffelbach was {{originally}} a big farming village, though by and by, workers came to seek their livelihoods in other occupations, too, at ﬁrst mainly as stone quarry workers, {{and then in}} the early 20th century also as so-called Saargänger (“Saar-goers”) at the collieries in the nearby Saarland. The farming village ﬁrst turned into a workers’ village. For centuries, the mills were traditional businesses. The Altmühle (“Old Mill”) was in early feudal times held by the church and was said to be the church estate mill, meaning that all the parish’s farmers had to have their grain ground here. A Mühlenweistum (a Weistum - cognate with English wisdom - was a legal pronouncement issued by men learned in law in the Middle Ages and early modern times; a Mühlenweistum is one that deals with mills) for this mill was ﬁrst put together in 1585 and survives today in a 1762 copy. At the time of the French Revolution, the mill passed into state ownership and was then sold to a family named Jung, and has belonged to their descendants ever since, although the mill itself long ago ceased to function as such. The Eselsmühle (“Ass’s Mill”), also called the Schwarzenborner Mühle, was a so-called Pletschmühle (one with an overshot waterwheel that could only run when the water ﬂow was strong enough) that only ground grain for its successive owners’ needs, and only served others if the estate mill was overloaded. This mill, too, was mentioned even before the Thirty Years' War, and by 1632, it was owned by Heinrich Süß. A third mill downstream from the village in turn bore the names Neumühle (“New Mill”), Brunnenmühle, Bremmenmühle, and last, Faußmühle, according to its owners during the 19th century, and it, too, existed before the Thirty Years' War. Once also standing within Pfeffelbach’s limits was a walking mill, although its exact site is now unknown. About the middle of the 19th century, the ﬁrst hard-stone quarries were opened within Pfeffelbach’s limits. The ﬁrst major quarry was opened in 1870, while others followed in 1887 and 1904. Workers and, as a secondary occupation, also smallhold farmers could seek employment in the village itself. The operations were heavily bound to economic cycles. The quarries originally produced only paving stones, but later also <b>crushed</b> stone and <b>ballast</b> for road and railway building. Two quarries are still in business even now, but now employ few workers. Besides the quarries, there are small businesses, shops and inns in the village. All in all, Pfeffelbach is nowadays a residential community for people in the most varied of occupations, many of whom must commute elsewhere to their jobs.|$|R
40|$|This {{technical}} report evaluates and develops options {{for reducing the}} amount of steel in the emplacement drift invert. Concepts developed in the ''Invert Configuration and Drip Shield Interface'' were evaluated to determine material properties required for the proposed invert concepts. Project requirements documents prescribe the use of a carbon steel frame for the invert with a granular material of <b>crushed</b> tuff as <b>ballast.</b> The ''Invert Configuration and Drip Shield Interface'' developed three concepts: (1) All-Ballast Invert; (2) Modified Steel Invert with Ballast; and (3) Steel Tie with Ballast Invert. Analysis of the steel frame members, runway beams, and guide beams, for the modified steel invert with ballast, decreased the quantity of steel in the emplacement drift invert, however a substantial steel support frame for the gantry and waste package/pallet assembly is still required. Use of one of the other two concepts appears to be an alternative to the steel frame and each of the concepts uses considerably less steel materials. Analysis of the steel tie with ballast invert shows that the bearing pressure on the ballast under the single steel tie, C 9 x 20, loaded with the waste package/pallet assembly, drip shield, and backfill exceeds the upper bound of the allowable bearing capacity for tuff used in this study. The single tie, C 10 x 20, will also fail for the same loading condition except for the tie length of 4. 2 meters and longer. Analysis also shows that with two ties, C 9 or 10 x 20 's, the average ballast pressure is less than the allowable bearing capacity. Distributing the waste package/pallet, drip shield, and backfill loads to two steel ties reduces the contact bearing pressure. Modifying the emplacement pallet end beams to a greater width, reducing the tie spacing, and increasing the width of the ties would ensure that the pallet beams are always supported by two steel ties. Further analysis is required to determine compatible tie size and spacing and pallet beam width. Testing is also required to determine the bearing capacity of the tuff materials. Analysis of the all-ballast invert shows that the waste package/pallet assembly, as currently designed, can be supported by the compacted crushed tuff. The drip shield and related backfill loads cannot be supported by the compacted crushed tuff because of the narrow base angle that currently supports the drip shield. Increasing the width of the base angle of the drip shield will better distribute the drip shield and backfill load to the compacted crushed tuff. Testing is required to determine the bearing capacity of the tuff materials. Emplacement/retrieval equipment will also require analysis and development to be compatible with the all-ballast invert...|$|R
40|$|Rail {{is a very}} {{expensive}} component of the railway track. Therefore, research methods extending rail life have great economic importance. During {{the past thirty years}} and, particularly during the past ten years there has been an increasing awareness throughout most rail networks {{in the world of the}} need to introduce improved design criteria, better construction techniques and higher standard track generally. This implies that quality control at all levels is mandatory if these objectives are to be achieved. With the improved understanding of degradation of track, a more complete comprehension of the costs associated with different operating and infrastructure conditions should also be developed, aiding in the determination of efficient maintenance costs and their contribution to access charges. Track and structures together account for 60 % of maintenance costs, with 50 % of the total being track. The UIC has done a lot of work on comparative performance indicators, and these show what potential savings much be out there for the taking, just by adopting current best practice. The old wisdom is that it's not enough o do things rights; we have to make sure that we do the right things. These developments have largely resulted from the demand for higher speeds particularly in passenger services and the demand to accept heavier axle loads of freight traffic. Whilst the conventional railway track structure is not likely to change significantly over the next ten years there will be a requirement over that period for better quality track infrastructure. This means less rail surface defects, less internal defects and less wheels irregularities. The presence of rail surface defects generally increases the roughness of the track leading to a poor passenger ride and increased safety risk with freight traffic. In addition, rail surface defects will generally increase the degradation rate of other track components; however, not all defects will produce visible track deterioration. Dynamic impacts produced by the rollingstock running over rail surface defects, such as poor welds, will, over time, create continuous rail defects, loosening of fastenings, abrasion and skewing of sleepers, <b>crushing</b> of <b>ballast</b> and loss of formation geometry. It is only in the recent years that the importance of poor welds in track has been identified. Dips and peaks must be recognised as a severe track irregularity that needs to be addressed and removed. Current maintenance activities have little effect on removing misaligned welds in track and the improvement obtained after the maintenance works is generally short lived. On the other hand, straightening operations have proven to solve the problem and maintain the results following 7 months of traffic. As part of this project, a six kilometre test section was selected on the Mt Isa Line and all welds located in this region were monitored for over 9 months to increase the understanding of the effect of individual maintenance activities on the track roughness. Three 2 km Divisions were established; each Division had different maintenance activities and levels of intervention completed over the duration of the project. Over 15, 000 readings were recorded and analysed. The following conclusions were drawn. The effect of cycle tamping was clearly identified when comparing the means of weld located in Division 1, 2 to the mean of welds in Division 3. Cycle tamping showed to have a significant positive effect on the dipped welds geometry and an increase in severity of peaked welds prior to their correction. Straightening operations completed in Division 1 and 2 reduced the overall mean of weld misalignments. These Divisions were subjected to different levels of straightening intervention however they produced similar results. Division 1 all dips were straightened and Division 2 only dips > 0. 3 mm were straightened. This means that no additional benefit, in terms of overall misalignment of welds, can be gained when straightening operations target dips with a misalignment smaller than 0. 3 mm. Cycle grinding proved to have little effect on the removal of both dips and peaks. In fact, due to the configuration of the grinding machine, grinding operation produced a slight worsening of the dips misalignments and only a minor improvement of peaks. Although long term monitoring of the site may show minor variations in weld geometry performance, after approximately 3. 9 Mgt of traffic the mean of dipped welds in Division 1 and 2 appeared to remain unaltered, as Division 3 showed a minor worsening. Furthermore, the mean of peaked welds in Division 1 and 2 appeared to remain unaltered, as Division 3 showed a minor worsening...|$|R
40|$|This {{work is a}} {{comprehensive}} investigation to find to what extent simple laboratory tests e. g. Los Angeles abrasion and micro-Deval might be suitable for predicting real railway ballast performance with respect to deformation and degradation. A number of tests to measure essential properties of ballast aggregate have been performed in addition to advanced material testing. Large cyclic triaxial loading test and full scale railway track model test were employed to simulate the effects of train loading and tamping, and to study settlement, stiffness and degradation {{of a range of}} ballast materials. The testing programme included both wet and dry testing conditions. All the rock types tested were mainly composed of combinations of principal rock-forming silicate minerals. They represent all together a wide variety of igneous, metamorphic and consolidated/metamorphosed sedimentary rocks mainly fine to very fine grained. Mechanical properties Change in the ballast grading proved to affect the ballast breakage development over time. However, the abrasion property expressed by the micro-Deval value did not show any association with the degradation of ballast under repeated load testing. Simulation of repeated tamping seemed to be the main source of ballast breakage. Most rocks showed high frost resistance after long term impact, but samples with high content of amphibole were less frost resistant. The rocks’ mechanical strength in terms of the Los Angeles abrasion or micro-Deval value did not show any correlation with either the amount of microcracks or the rocks’ average mineral grain size. A new method to measure the amount of microcracks based on luminescence measurements was developed. It is suggested that micro-cracks represent open channels for water to penetrate into the aggregate, which was confirmed by good correlation between water absorption and the amount of micro-cracks. Moisture had generally a negative effect on rocks’ mechanical strength according to Los Angeles abrasion and Point Load strength results. On the other hand, dry and wet triaxial tests with cyclic loadings did not confirm this effect. Neither did mineral grain size distribution show any correlation with mechanical strength, but the range of coefficient of conformity (Cu = D 60 /D 10) was probably too narrow to obtain a reliable conclusion. A new method to quantify the mineral grain size distribution was developed under these test series. Functional properties Both resilient modulus of the ballast layer and the stiffness of the track were governed by the materials’ grading curve and specific density. A possible relation between the amount of microcracks in the aggregate and resilient modulus as well as ballast breakage is suggested. The permanent vertical strain during repeated load testing was affected by both the micro-Deval value, the grading curve of the ballast and the aggregate’s content of soft minerals. Improvements of test methods The Los Angeles abrasion test distinguished clearly between the superior quality material and the very poor material. The Los Angeles abrasion value is, however, a poor parameter to indicate how the intermediate material will behave in service regarding ballast breakage. This study proposes to improve the ranking of ballast materials by introducing two additional methods. One which is able to measure some rocks’ ability to recover mechanical strength after repeated crushing, and one which measures the production of fines (0 / 0. 125 mm) during <b>crushing.</b> Saturation of <b>ballast</b> material before micro-Deval testing did not have any significant effect on degradation. Neither did the use of 1 % sodium-chloride solution have any effect. PhD i bygg, anlegg og transportPhD in Civil and Transport Engineerin...|$|R
