5|$|Following the {{admittance}} of Boston College {{into the}} conference {{beginning with the}} 2005–2006 season, the conference began to play an annual championship game to <b>conclude</b> <b>the</b> season. The new 12-team conference was divided into two divisions, and the champion of each division (the team with the best conference record in each division) was awarded {{an invitation to the}} conference championship game.|$|E
5|$|The {{critical}} {{reception for}} the episode was mostly positive. Many reviewers {{commented that the}} dark tone of the final episode was characteristic of the series, and that killing off the protagonist was an appropriate way to <b>conclude.</b> <b>The</b> characters of Victor and Margaret returned in a short sketch for Comic Relief's Red Nose Day telethon on 16 March 2001.|$|E

5|$|After {{months of}} not {{working on the}} poem, Eliot began to feel {{compelled}} to finish it; {{it was not until}} August 1942, however, that he started working on it again. In total, there were five drafts. The poem was finished by 19 September 1942 and published in the October New English Weekly. Little Gidding was intended to <b>conclude</b> <b>the</b> Four Quartets series, summarising Eliot's views expressed in this series of poems.|$|E
5|$|Brisingr is {{the third}} novel in the Inheritance Cycle by Christopher Paolini. It was {{released}} on September 20, 2008. Originally, Paolini intended to <b>conclude</b> <b>the</b> then Inheritance Trilogy in three books, but during writing the third book he decided that the series was too complex to conclude in one book, because the single book would be close to 1,500 pages long. A deluxe edition of Brisingr, which includes removed scenes and previously unseen art, was released on October 13, 2009.|$|E

5|$|Burke led all Big Ten {{freshman}} in scoring (edging Cody Zeller by a 15.8–15.5 margin or 5 points over the 18-game conference season) and assists per conference game. He concluded {{the season as}} the team leader in points, assists, blocks (not blocks per game) and steals. His three consecutive Big Ten Player of the Week awards to <b>conclude</b> <b>the</b> season coincided with the team winning 6 of its final 7 regular season games. His efforts lead the team to a share of its first Big Ten Conference Championship since the 1985–86 team and the best Big Ten record (13–5) since the 1993–94 team.|$|E
5|$|English Heritage, a {{government}} body {{in charge of}} conservation of historic sites, roughly locates the battlefield in an area 800 to 1600metres (0.5 to 1.0 mile) north {{of the town of}} Barnet. Over the centuries, much of the terrain has changed, and records of the town's boundaries and geography are not detailed enough for English Heritage or historians to <b>conclude</b> <b>the</b> exact location of the battle. Geographical features corresponding to contemporary descriptions allow approximations of where the fighting took place.|$|E
5|$|Free {{of injury}} {{for the first}} time in two seasons, Bure was one of the Panthers' {{offensive}} leaders in 2003–04. He reached 20 goals for the fifth time in his NHL career, and as the season's trade deadline approached, was Florida's leading scorer with 45 points. However, as the Panthers were out of playoff contention, they traded Bure to the Dallas Stars on March 9, 2004, in exchange for Drew Bagnall and a draft pick. Bure was placed on the Stars' top line with Mike Modano and Jere Lehtinen, and he recorded 7 points in 13 games to <b>conclude</b> <b>the</b> regular season. Bure added three assists in five playoff games.|$|E

5|$|In 2001, Brownell et al. reevaluated the {{conservation}} {{status of the}} North Pacific right whale as a distinct species, and in 2002, the Scientific Committee of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) accepted Rosenbaum's findings, and recommended that the Eubalaena nomenclature be retained for this genus. A 2007 study by Churchill provided further evidence to <b>conclude</b> <b>the</b> three living right whale species do comprise a phylogenetic lineage, distinct from the bowhead, and are rightly classified into two separate genera.|$|E
5|$|On 9 September, the WSB's {{spokesman}} {{stated that}} the remaining six members of the patrol, who had now been held for over a fortnight, would only be released after a new government was formed in Sierra Leone, leading negotiators {{to conclude that the}} increasingly unrealistic demands were stalling tactics rather than a serious attempt to <b>conclude</b> <b>the</b> crisis. At around the same time, teams that had been observing the West Side Boys' base for four days reported that they had seen no sign of the captive soldiers in that time. There were also concerns that an assault would become more dangerous if the West Side Boys moved the hostages. The combination of these factors led COBRA to order an extraction mission.|$|E
5|$|The ecclesia officially {{accepted}} Philip's harsh terms, {{including the}} renouncement of {{their claim to}} Amphipolis. However, when an Athenian delegation arrived at Pella to put Phillip under oath, which was required to <b>conclude</b> <b>the</b> treaty, he was campaigning abroad.* G. Cawkwell, Philip II of Macedon, 102–103. He expected that he would hold safely any Athenian possessions which he might seize before the ratification.* G. Cawkwell, Philip II of Macedon, 102–103. Being very anxious about the delay, Demosthenes insisted that the embassy should travel {{to the place where}} they would find Philip and swear him in without delay. Despite his suggestions, the Athenian envoys, including himself and Aeschines, remained in Pella, until Philip successfully concluded his campaign in Thrace.* G. Cawkwell, Philip II of Macedon, 102–103.|$|E

5|$|The {{origin of}} the Spanish flu pandemic, and the {{relationship}} between the near-simultaneous outbreaks in humans and swine, have been controversial. One hypothesis is that the virus strain originated at Fort Riley, Kansas, in viruses in poultry and swine which the fort bred for food; the soldiers were then sent from Fort Riley around the world, where they spread the disease. Similarities between a reconstruction of the virus and avian viruses, combined with the human pandemic preceding the first reports of influenza in swine, led researchers to <b>conclude</b> <b>the</b> influenza virus jumped directly from birds to humans, and swine caught the disease from humans.|$|E
5|$|The {{publication}} debuted {{at number}} one on the bestseller lists for The New York Times and The Globe and Mail, holding the position on the former for eleven consecutive weeks. Generally well received by critics, Outliers was considered more personal than Gladwell's other works, and some reviews commented on how much Outliers felt like an autobiography. Reviews praised the connection that Gladwell draws between his own background {{and the rest of the}} publication to <b>conclude</b> <b>the</b> book. Reviewers also appreciated the questions posed by Outliers, finding it important to determine how much individual potential is ignored by society. However, the lessons learned were considered anticlimactic and dispiriting. The writing style, though deemed easy to understand, was criticized for oversimplifying complex social phenomena.|$|E
5|$|The show {{planned a}} {{dramatic}} stunt which {{would lead to}} the discovery of Callum's body. The scene featured Carla Connor (Alison King) causing a car accident, colliding with Tyrone Dobbs' (Alan Halsall) pick-up truck which smashes into the Platt's home. This causes the floor to give way and a recovery team unearthing Callum's body. Producers decided to <b>conclude</b> <b>the</b> story without Kylie being held accountable for the murder. Instead they used a character that had been recently killed off, Tony Stewart (Terence Maynard), who had publicly feuded with Callum. When Sarah confesses the truth to Todd Grimshaw (Bruno Langley), he decides to frame Tony for the crime–a scheme which proved successful.|$|E

5|$|To {{serve as}} sequels to the anime series and to <b>conclude</b> <b>the</b> manga story, two {{original}} video animations (OVA) were produced. The first OVA, , {{which consists of}} thirteen episodes was produced by Tokyo Movie and directed by Osamu Dezaki. It was released by Bandai Visual between July 25, 1988, and October 25, 1988, on six VHS videocassettes, and as a DVD compilation on May 23, 2005. It was also released in France by Manga Distribution in 2008. The first OVA was followed by , which was originally released by Bandai Visual into six VHS videos from October 23, 1989, to April 24, 1990, and a DVD box set was released on September 26, 2003.|$|E
5|$|Before the 2007–08 season began, Andrea Bargnani, {{the number}} one pick in the 2006 NBA draft, was slated to start at center and Bosh at power forward to form a strong Toronto frontcourt and Jason Kapono, a three-point specialist, was {{acquired}} via free agency from the Miami Heat to add offensive firepower; however, as the season unfolded, neither plans materialized as hoped. Bosh himself had a slow start to the season, but as mid-season approached, his form picked up and he was named Player of the Week for {{the second week of}} January. On January 31, 2008, he was selected to be on the Eastern Conference team for the 2008 NBA All-Star Game. Bosh missed 15 games throughout the season, but the Raptors still managed to <b>conclude</b> <b>the</b> regular season with a 41–41 record, thus clinching the sixth seed in the Eastern Conference for the 2008 NBA Playoffs. However, they were defeated by the Orlando Magic in the first round, losing 4–1.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to these}} delays, Urobuchi issued an apology to viewers. However, he also {{indicated}} that the postponements could be viewed {{in a positive light}} because they alleviated some production pressures placed on animation studio Shaft due to the tight broadcast schedule. Citing particularly challenging drawings for episodes 11 and 12, Urobuchi and Iwakami planned to have Shaft continue to improve the episodes immediately up until their new air time. Furthermore, Urobuchi remarked that if episode 11 in its current state had been aired as scheduled, the result most likely would have been disappointing. On March 23, 2011, the broadcast {{for the rest of the}} series was delayed indefinitely. However, the production team reported that they were continuing to work on the episodes and announced their intention to finish airing the series by April. Finally, on April 10, 2011, the official website for Puella Magi Madoka Magica announced that broadcasts would resume on April 21. Episodes 11 and 12 aired back-to-back on MBS to <b>conclude</b> <b>the</b> series, while TBS and CBC ran episode 10 in addition to 11 and 12.|$|E
