5|$|Bee-eaters have <b>calls</b> <b>that</b> are {{characteristic}} for each species. Most sound simple {{to the human}} ear, but show significant variability when studied in detail, carrying significant information for the birds.|$|E
5|$|Cicadas feed on sap; {{they do not}} bite or sting in a true sense, but may {{occasionally}} mistake a person's arm for a plant {{limb and}} attempt to feed. Male cicadas produce very loud <b>calls</b> <b>that</b> can damage human hearing.|$|E
5|$|Male crickets {{establish}} their dominance {{over each other}} by aggression. They start by lashing each other with their antennae and flaring their mandibles. Unless one retreats at this stage, they resort to grappling, {{at the same time}} each emitting <b>calls</b> <b>that</b> are quite unlike those uttered in other circumstances. When one achieves dominance, it sings loudly, while the loser remains silent.|$|E

5|$|The Foreign Minister's {{interpreter}} is ghost-hacked, {{presumably to}} assassinate VIPs {{in an upcoming}} meeting. Believing the perpetrator is the mysterious Puppet Master, Kusanagi's team follows the traced telephone <b>calls</b> <b>that</b> sent the virus. After a chase, they capture a garbage man and a thug. However, both are only ghost-hacked individuals with no clue about the Puppet Master. The investigation again comes to a dead end.|$|E
5|$|The usual {{call of the}} nelicourvi weaver is a high-pitched, very {{distinct}} chizz-chizz-chizz, {{which is}} more metallical and rasping when the birds are in feeding groups. Other <b>calls</b> <b>that</b> can be heard when the birds are at the nest include tsrrreee, tiang-tiang, and chet. The song, which is produced while being at the nest sounds like chiz-chizz-chswriissssiszz.|$|E
5|$|Although males {{demonstrate}} little {{involvement in}} territorial disputes between neighboring communities, and ruffed lemur communities lack cohesiveness, females communally defend the community range against females of other communities. These disputes occur mostly during the hot, rainy season, when resources are more abundant and occur near {{the boundaries of}} community ranges. Spacing is maintained by scent marking and vocal communication. Ruffed lemurs {{are known for their}} loud, raucous <b>calls</b> <b>that</b> are answered by neighboring communities and subgroups within the same community.|$|E
50|$|African striped weasels {{have been}} {{identified}} as making six different types of call. Apart from the warning and aggressive calls mentioned above, and a third <b>call</b> <b>that</b> transitions between the two, there is a <b>call</b> <b>that</b> signals submission of a retreating male, a <b>call</b> <b>that</b> indicates surrender during a fight, and a greeting call used only between males and females and between young and their mother. Young weasels also make distress calls when separated from their mother.|$|R
60|$|EVE [now pitying him maternally] Love! You <b>call</b> <b>that</b> love! You <b>call</b> <b>that</b> {{the nature}} of woman! My boy: this is neither man nor woman nor love nor life. You have no real {{strength}} in your bones nor sap in your flesh.|$|R

5|$|As {{the species}} has no fixed nest sites that {{individuals}} {{can use to}} locate their own partner or chick, emperor penguins must rely on vocal calls alone for identification. They use {{a complex set of}} <b>calls</b> <b>that</b> are critical to individual recognition between parents, offspring, and mates, displaying the widest variation in individual calls of all penguins. Vocalizing emperor penguins use two frequency bands simultaneously. Chicks use a frequency-modulated whistle to beg for food and to contact parents.|$|E
5|$|Little brown bats produce <b>calls</b> <b>that</b> {{are high}} {{intensity}} frequency modulated (FM) and that last {{from less than}} one millisecond (ms) to about 5 ms and have a sweep rate of 80–40kHz, with most of their energy at 45kHz. Bats usually emit 20 calls per second when in flight. When pursuing prey, a bat emits 200 calls per second. It also emits a high-pulse repetitive call {{if it wants to}} land.|$|E
5|$|Males {{make two}} <b>calls</b> <b>that</b> are {{directed}} at females, sometimes {{as a prelude}} to mating. One is a sequence of short squeaks; the other is made up of consecutive ah notes with 0.1 second between each note. These calls can be brief or last up to several minutes. Nestlings make a noisy grating begging call when seeking or expecting food. An adult female may also make the call while incubating the eggs. Immature birds also make a grating call not associated with begging that parents ignore.|$|E

5|$|Many rodent species, {{particularly}} those that are diurnal and social, have {{a wide range of}} alarm <b>calls</b> <b>that</b> are emitted when they perceive threats. There are both direct and indirect benefits of doing this. A potential predator may stop when it knows it has been detected, or an alarm call can allow conspecifics or related individuals to take evasive action. Several species, for example prairie dogs, have complex anti-predator alarm call systems. These species may have different calls for different predators (e.g. aerial predators or ground-based predators) and each call contains information {{about the nature of the}} precise threat. The urgency of the threat is also conveyed by the acoustic properties of the call.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} birds heard in the morning, the yellow-faced honeyeater utters <b>calls</b> <b>that</b> are full and loud, and {{extremely}} varied. The male sings from a roost for up to an hour, beginning twenty or thirty minutes before dawn. The song is a running series of cheerful notes sounding like chick-up, chick-up, from which its common name of quitchup is derived. Counter-singing (repeating the first bird's song) by neighbouring birds is common. The territorial call, also given by opponents during fights, is a long preet with an upward inflection. The alarm call is a loud trilling whistle. Common calls, thought to be contact calls, are animated two-note calls variously described as terric, terric, cr-rook, cr-rook or put-put, put-put.|$|E
5|$|Related manuscripts include Bodleian Library Oxford MS Laud 647, {{known as}} the O manuscript. This {{is based on the}} Liber, but reorganised into a listing of the acts of the various abbots and bishops and dates from the 14th century. Blake, in his edition of the Liber, <b>calls</b> <b>that</b> and related works the Chronicon Abbatum et Episcoporum Eliensium. Another related work is {{contained}} in Trinity College, Cambridge MS O.2.41, which contains the Libellus of Æthelwold and an Ely cartulary. Two other related works containing just cartularies are British Library Cotton MS Tiberius A vi and Cambridge University Library Ely Diocesan Register Liber M.|$|E

50|$|The {{blocks to}} which control may {{transfer}} after reaching {{the end of}} a block are <b>called</b> <b>that</b> block's successors, while the blocks from which control may have come when entering a block are <b>called</b> <b>that</b> block's predecessors. The start of a basic block may be jumped to from more than one location.|$|R
5|$|Ruffed lemurs use alarm <b>calls</b> <b>that</b> {{differentiate}} between ground and aerial predators. For instance an abrupt roar or huff alerts {{the group to}} an avian predator, and a pulsed squawk or growl-snort communicates {{the existence of a}} mammalian ground predator. When sounding these calls, such as the pulsed squawk, adults direct them at the predator after moving to a safe position. Once the alarm call is sounded by one individual, the resulting chorus can even reach the furthest ranging community members.|$|E
5|$|Scaly-breasted munias form {{flocks of}} as many as 100 birds. Individuals {{communicate}} with <b>calls</b> <b>that</b> include a short whistle, variations of kitty-kitty-kitty, and a sharp chipping alarm note. They sometimes flick their tails and wings vertically or horizontally while hopping about. The tail flicking motion may have evolved from a locomotory intention movement. The exaggerated version of the tail flicking movement may have undergone ritualization. As a social signal, tail flicking in several other species acts as a signal indicating the intent to fly and helps keep flocks together.|$|E
5|$|The head {{linesman}} {{is positioned}} {{on one end}} of the line of scrimmage. He watches for any line-of-scrimmage and illegal use-of-hands violations and assists the line judge with illegal shift or illegal motion calls. The head linesman also rules on out-of-bounds <b>calls</b> <b>that</b> happen on his side of the field, oversees the chain crew and marks the forward progress of a runner when a play has been whistled dead.|$|E

5|$|Dave Karofsky (Max Adler) is outed at {{his school}} and {{subsequently}} bullied by his teammates {{in the locker}} room. He is also mercilessly attacked online. Karofsky, devastated, attempts suicide by hanging, but is saved in time by his father. The news causes shock at his old school, McKinley High: Members of the staff believe {{they could have done}} more to help him when he had been a student there, while Kurt blames himself for ignoring Karofsky's repeated phone <b>calls</b> <b>that</b> week. It also shocks Sebastian, who had cruelly rebuffed Karofsky at a gay bar, and he destroys the photos of Finn, thus abandoning his attempt at blackmail. New Directions coach Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) has all of the members reveal something they are looking forward to in the future, to remind them that no matter how low they think their lives have sunk, they should not forget what is ahead of them. Rachel and Finn apologize to each other, and decide to get married the day after Regionals.|$|E
5|$|In {{the game}} of baseball, the {{official}} scorer is a person appointed by the league to record the events on the field, and to send the official scoring record of the game back to the league offices. In addition to recording the events on the field such as the outcome of each plate appearance and the circumstances of any baserunner's advance around the bases, the official scorer is also charged with making judgment <b>calls</b> <b>that</b> do not affect the progress or outcome of the game. Judgment calls are primarily made about errors, unearned runs, fielder's choice, the value of hits in certain situations, and wild pitches, {{all of which are}} included in the record compiled. This record is used to compile statistics for each player and team. A box score is a summary of the official scorer's game record.|$|E
5|$|Lee {{won three}} titles {{out of six}} finals in 2006. He was crowned as {{the winner of the}} Swiss Open, Asian Badminton Championships and his third Malaysia Open title. He also reached the final of the Chinese Taipei Open, Macau Open and Hong Kong Open. In the Malaysia Open, Lee fought back from 13–20 down in the rubber match and scored eight match points against Lin Dan, and finally won the game with a score of 23–21 to secure the title. Lee won Malaysia's two gold medals in the {{badminton}} event for 2006 Commonwealth Games, in both the men's singles and mixed team events. Lee reached the top spot twice in the Badminton World Federation's world rankings in 2006, and he participated in the World Championships as top seed. However, he was upset by Bao Chunlai of China in the quarter-final despite Lee winning at their previous meeting. The match was also marred by two controversial line <b>calls</b> <b>that</b> were not in favour of Lee.|$|E
