Now, {{although}} these three great groups of rocks do indeed often pass {{into each other}} by imperceptible gradations, and although their peculiar aspect is never a severe indication of their relative ages, yet their characters {{are for the most}} part so defined as to make a strong impression on the mind of an ordinary observer, and their age is also for the most part approximately indicated by their degrees of hardness, and <b>crystalline</b> <b>aspect.</b> It does, indeed, sometimes happen that a soft and slimy clay will pass into a rock like Aberdeen granite by transitions so subtle that no point of separation can be determined; and it very often happens that rocks like Aberdeen granite are of more recent formation than certain beds of sandstone and limestone. But, in spite of all these uncertainties and exceptions, I believe that unless actual pains be taken to efface from the mind its natural impressions, the idea of three great classes of rocks and earth will maintain its ground in the thoughts of the general observer; that whether he desire it or not, he will find himself throwing the soft and loose clays and sands together under one head; placing the hard rocks, of a dull, compact, homogeneous substance, under another head; and the hardest rocks, of a crystalline, glittering, and various substance, under a third head; and having done this, he will also find that, with certain easily admissible exceptions, these three classes of rocks are, in every district which he examines, of three different ages; that the softest are the youngest, the hard and homogeneous ones are older, and the crystalline are the oldest; and he will, perhaps, in the end, find it a somewhat inconvenient piece of respect to the complexity and accuracy of modern geological science, if he refuse to the three classes, thus defined in his imagination, their ancient title of Tertiary, Secondary, and Primary.|$|E
5000|$|The small {{shell is}} {{remarkable}} for its oval subglobulous shape, with a convex very short spire, briefly acuminate The coloring is {{of a bright}} hyaline white, embellished with a very narrow yellow band, situated a little above the lower suture. The spire has a <b>crystalline</b> <b>aspect.</b> It is rather strongly thickened, very finely striated throughout its length, adorned with longitudinal ribs. These are flexuous, low, numerous, and form, at their enlarged base. continuous concentric arcs [...] Small, decurrent, regular, numerous lirae, traverse the whorls and surmount the ribs and undulate in their interstices over the entire surface. The shell contains 6 to 7 (?) whorls (the fractured top in the received specimen shows only 5½ whorls). The first two whorls are rounded. The rest are convex, separated by a linear, undulating, somewhat thickened suture. The body whorl which exceeds 2/3 of the total height, is globular in its upper part, attenuating slightly below its middle to end with an elongation {{in a very short}} siphonal canal. The aperture is oblique, narrow and has a continuous peristome. The columella, concave in its upper part, is coated with an enamel whose edge rises in a blunt crest. Starting at this ridge , pointing inwards, are 8 folds regularly spaced along the length. The outer lip is convex, strongly thickened; Its sharp edge is not prominent. The folds in the interior protrude in the form of strong denticles. The almost round sinus is dug a little below the suture in the callosity of the outer lip.|$|E

Improvement in crystalline order has been observed in chemically synthesized polymers by high-temperature annealing. This paper mainly concerns structural analysis in terms of degree of crystalline order (Xcr) as the crystalline-gauging parameter, and X-ray diffraction profile data as molecular order probe. A large extent of enhancement of crystalline domains up to 25 % through recrystallization and crystallite growth has been obtained by high-temperature annealing of EB-and ES-PANis and Pth-dissociated hexithiophene materials (of intrinsic Xcr= 20 to 50 %).

40|$|Progress in {{the general}} {{understanding}} of structure-property relationships in organic semiconductors requires experimental tools capable of imaging structural details, as molecular packing or domain attributes, featuring ultra-thin films. A rarely employed operation mode of scanning force microscopy, related to friction force microscopy (FFM) and known as transverse shear microscopy (TSM), has demonstrated the ability to reveal <b>crystalline</b> <b>aspects</b> linked to the surface symmetry of organic surfaces with nanometer resolution. In spite of those promising results, numerous questions remain about the physical origin of the TSM imaging mechanism. Taking as benchmark a PTCDI-C 8 sub-monolayer, we demonstrate experimentally and theoretically that such mechanism is the same atomic scale stick-slip ruling FFM leading to the angular dependence of both signals. Lattice-resolved images acquired on top of differently oriented PTCDI-C 8 molecular domains are crucial to permit azimuthal sampling, without the need of sample rotation. The simulations reveal that, though the surface crystallography is the direct cause of the FFM and TSM signals, the manifestation of anisotropy will largely depend on the amplitude of the surface potential corrugation {{as well as on}} temperature and the material itself. This work provides a novel nanoscale strategy for the quantitative analysis of organic thin films based on their nanotribological response.

30|$|ZnO is an {{important}} functional II–VI semiconductor compounds and have been extensively investigated for their excellent optoelectronic, electronic, photochemical properties [1, 2]. Various methods including chemical, electro-chemical, and physical deposition techniques have been employed to synthesize 1 D ZnO nanostructures [3 – 5]. On the other hand, the wet-chemical methods [6 – 8] {{have been used for}} producing varied ZnO one-dimensional (1 D) nanostructures, such as nanotube [9], nanopencil [10], nanoneedle [11], and nanoscrew [12]. Recent experiments have shown that the ZnO 1 D nanostructures have excellent field emission properties, far better than other semiconductors [10, 11, 13, 14]. An important advantage of using aligned nanorods, nanowires, nanobelts, and nanotubes for field emission is their high aspect ratio. The field enhancement factor β is a key parameter which is determined by turn-on field, threshold field, and work function. Also, the value of β relates to the structure, shape, size, alignment, <b>crystalline,</b> <b>aspect</b> ratio, etc. [15]. Many effects, such as morphological effects [16], surface states [17], and densities of nanorods [18] have been studied. Zhao et al. [16] investigated the morphological effects on the field emission of ZnO nanorod arrays. The result showed that the ZnO nanoneedle arrays exhibit excellent properties due to their small emitter radius and high nanorod density remarkably reduces the local field at the emitters owing to the screening effect. Wang et al. [18] investigated the density effects on the field emission of ZnO nanorods and pointed out that the mezzo density of ZnO nanorods had the best field emission properties. But there is no report about the aspect ratio effects on the field emission properties of ZnO nanorod arrays. In this work, ZnO nanrod arrays with different aspect ratios and densities are synthesized by controlling the reaction times and concentrations of solution. The field emission properties of ZnO nanorod arrays with different aspect ratios and densities have been investigated for showing the enhancement factor β was enhanced with increasing the aspect ratio of ZnO nanorods and the enhancement factor β was decreased with reducing the density of nanorods. An optimum density and aspect ratio of ZnO nanorod arrays (sample C) have high efficiency of field emission. A model has been used for the explanation of the results.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate the grain biometric characteristics of 62 rice cultivars, which cover Indica and Japonica subspecies, and different types of commercial rice like, Agulha (Indica rice cultivars), Carolino (Japonica cultivars), aromatic (basmati and thai), integral rice, risotto, glutinous (waxy), wild and parboiled rice. It was noticed that for the same group type of rice {{there are a great}} variance. Generally, the Agulha, Aromatic and Integral rices commercialized in Portuguese trade are long (length high than 6 mm and length/width ratio higher than 3) and risotto cultivars are medium size. The two studied glutinous rice cultivars presented one cultivar long and other cultivar round (length lower than 5 mm and length/width ratio lower than 1. 9). All rice cultivars presented high values of white vitreous, total whiteness, and low percentage of chalky area, presenting a <b>crystalline</b> and translucent <b>aspect,</b> but there is an exception to integral rice cultivars due to absence of polish operation during the milling process and for parboiled rice cultivars due to the effects of parboiled treatment.

40|$|The {{conventional}} planar bulk MOSFET {{is difficult}} to scale down to sub- 20 nm gate length, due to the worsening performance variability and short channel effects. Thin body transistors, including Multiple-Gate (FinFET & Tri-Gate FET) and Fully Depleted SOI (FD-SOI) MOSFETs are anticipated to replace the current transistor architecture, and {{will be used in}} future CMOS technology nodes. Strained Silicon technology is widely used today to boost planar bulk transistor performance. Thus it's technically important to examine the strain-induced performance enhancement in these thin body transistors, for nanometer scale channel length. A comprehensive study on impact of channel stress on ultra-thin-body FD-SOI MOSFETs is presented. It's found that strain-induced mobility enhancement diminishes with Silicon body thickness scaling below 5 nm for electrons, but not for holes. Strain-induced carrier transport enhancement is maintained with gate-length scaling. By applying forward back biasing (FBB) through the ultra-thin Buried Oxide layer, both carrier mobilities and their responses to strain get enhanced. For Multiple-gate FETs, the impact of performance enhancement through various types of stressors (including CESL, SiGe Source/Drain, Strained SOI and Metal Gate Last process) is studied, for different fin <b>crystalline</b> orientations and <b>aspect</b> ratios, to provide guidance for 3 -D transistor design optimization...|$|R
40|$|The {{structural}} {{information collected}} by X-ray (or neutron) diffraction studies of metallic, ionic, molecular and macromolecular crystals has increased beyond any previously imagined limit. Data are presently compiled in computer-based crystal structure databases. Making particular reference to molecular crystals, it is {{shown that the}} information collected may possess a great heuristic value, {{that is a great}} potential for guiding the discovery of new chemical facts or the formulation of new chemical theories, provided systematic methods of database analysis and crystal structure interpretation are made available. It is suggested that such methods consist of systematic correlations of structural data pertaining to single molecular fragments as found in many different crystal structures and can be collectively called (crystal) structure correlation methods (SCMs). SCMs are based on the search for and recognition of correlations among the geometrical descriptors of the fragment (structural correlations) and other physical properties of the fragment itself or of the molecule the fragment belongs to (structure-properties correlations). SCMs are systematically reviewed {{from the point of view}} of their chemical applications. Chemical themes so far investigated include chemical bonding, molecular interactions, reaction pathways and transition states, conformational interconversions, and reversible or irreversible transformations occurring in the <b>crystalline</b> state. Methodological <b>aspects</b> of SCMs are treated by means of a formalization of the structural correlation concept based on simple analytical mechanics considerations. The meaning of structural correlations, is dicussed in terms of chemical bond theories and potential energy hypersurfaces (principle of structure correlation) and their degree of applicability to chemical kinetics is analyzed in the frame of the Marcus rate-equilibrium theory.

40|$|In 1990, L. T. Canham {{discovered}} RT tunable photoluminescence {{properties of}} Porous Silicon (PS). At that time, this material {{was not the}} subject of a strong scientific interest and only used as insulator in SOI (Semiconductor On Insulator) and FIPOS (Full Insulation Porous Oxidized Silicon) techniques, and as a sacrificial layer in the micromachining technology. Since the 90 's, PS became one of the main topics in the semiconductor science, one additional reason being exploiting the processing properties already developed for <b>crystalline</b> Silicon. Important <b>aspects</b> of PS are the ease of synthesis and the cheapness of technologies employed: it is produced by means of electrochemical etching of crystalline Silicon in a HF-based solution and its porosity, morphology and specific surface area can be tailored changing the etching parameters (HF concentration, current density and etching time). SECTION I of this thesis concerns the description of main parameters {{to be taken into account}} for the preparation of the desired type of sample. Potential applications of PS are in many different fields: Sensors (change of conductivity and capacitance, quenching of the photoluminescence), Optics and Photonics (optical filters such as Bragg Reflector and Fabry-Perot microcavity), Optoelectronics (Light Emitting Diode, waveguides, Photo Detectors) and, more recently, Biomedical Technology. SECTION II describes all those properties and applications of PS related to this thesis. A detailed description of some of them is necessary to understand the main goals of the works presented. Photoluminescence of porous silicon depends not only upon morphology but also on the presence of chemicals inside its voids. For instance, conductivity and capacitance (and the related changes) are associated with the composition of the gas phase present in the pores and, not less important, to the way by which these species interact with PS surface. PS surface is highly reactive and its state controls luminescence and electrical properties. Applications of PS depend also upon the possibility to handle and control surface properties in a predictable way. As a consequence, the study of the stability of PS became an important topic for many groups that, with this purpose, tried to derivatize the surface with organic groups. One of the main attempts was the covalent bonding of saturated hydrocarbon chains which render the surface hydrophobic, so avoiding oxidation. Lewis acid mediated functionalisation using alkenes and alkynes substituted with halides, hydrosilylation of C-C double bond and cleavage of Si-Si bond with Grignard and alkyllithium reagent are only some examples. More recent studies concerning the modification of PS surface were oriented to the specificity and selectivity against target molecules. The large surface area, the possibility to obtain macropores and the biocompatibility were the impulse for the developing of novel biochemical sensors. Our interest for this material is related to its applications as sensor, where PS can be used in various fields: biomedical (e. g., for DNA derivatisation and immunoglobulines, bacteria, etc. detection), detection of pollutants (e. g., NO 2), warfare agents (Sarin gas) and explosives such as DNT and TNT. 1. Concerning the sensing behaviour based on the electrical detection of the response, the experimental work of this thesis has a twofold aim: A. To provide a "chemical" interpretation of the mechanism leading to the passivation of charge free carriers (holes) in mesoporous p+-type PS. The comprehension of this behaviour might also help in explaining how, in presence of suitable gaseous phases (or liquids), the electrical conductivity is modified. Experiments and discussions on this topic are reported in Chapters 1 - 4 of SECTION III. B. To study the reactivity of PS surface towards proper organic molecules and try to describe the mechanisms of the reactions. The purpose is both to protect and to impart a "specificity" which may raise the number of potential applications of PS. Since the study of the reaction mechanism at the surface is not a trivial task, at first, very simply molecules have been used, because the mechanisms of their interactions would be more readily understandable. However, the actual target is to bond at the surface molecules which give rise to charge transfer processes with PS. The target is to permanently reactivate PS electrical conductivity, i. e. to produce a real "porous semiconductor". Chapter 5 of SECTION III is devoted to these objectives. 2. Chapter 6 of SECTION III concerns the preparation of a hybrid sensor based on the optical detection of the signal: waveguides made of oxidised PS are used to host Congo-Red, a dye normally used in aqueous solution as pH indicato...|$|R
