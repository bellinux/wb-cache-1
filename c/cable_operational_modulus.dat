This paper seeks to demonstrate what quantifiable improvements in cable performance could be gained through advances in the dielectric properties of cable systems. The analysis is set in the context of the operational current rating of the cable circuit and the associated losses per unit of power transferred. Analysis of the results shows that the greatest improvement in <b>cable</b> <b>operational</b> performance can be made from increasing the dielectric thermal conductivity, even if it comes at the expense of a slight decrease in other properties...|$|R

40|$|Subject of Research. The paper {{deals with}} {{temperature}} effects {{dependence of the}} synchronization signal parameters in an optical fiber cable for a subcarrier wave quantum communication system. Two main causes of signal distortion are considered: {{the change in the}} refractive index {{as a function of the}} average daily temperature and the dispersion effects in the optical fiber, over which the signal is transmitted in the system. Method. To account for these effects, a temperature model has been created. The signal delay is calculated as a result of external influences in the system working with a standard fiber-optic <b>cable.</b> Real <b>operational</b> conditions are taken into account, including cable laying conditions, average daily temperature and wind speed. Main Results. The simulations were carried out on the standard single-mode fiber ITU-T G. 652 D. It was experimentally obtained that the maximum calculated phase mismatch of the synchronization signal for a system operating at a 100 km fiber length corresponds to a 1. 7 ps signal time delay. The maximum operating intervals of the system without the use of phase adjustment are calculated. The obtained results are used to improve the parameters of the subcarrier wave quantum communication system. It is determined that the change in the refractive index in the fiber causes significant distortion of the signal. It is shown that stable operation is possible with adjustment every 158 ms. The additional phase delay resulting from the dispersion effects should be adjusted every 2. 3 hours. Practical Relevance. The obtained results enable to optimize the parameters of the subcarrier wave quantum key distribution system to increase the overall key generation rate...|$|R
40|$|To {{manage a}} cable network {{effectively}} {{it is desirable}} to rate cable assets precisely. To investigate the conservatism of cable ratings provided by accepted modelling approaches several models have been employed to provide comparative continuous ratings for a directly buried <b>cable</b> group arrangement. <b>Operational</b> ratings are performed using expedient cable rating calculations, typically employing analytical or one dimensional (1 D) finite difference (FD) methods. The case for a directly buried cable group is considered; ratings are obtained using three methods including the international standard analytical approach (IEC 60287), 1 D FD and a 2 D finite element analysis (FEA) approach. A continuous equation for resultant heat-flux has been derived to more precisely model the dielectric loss in 2 D and 3 D FEA models. Comparing results shows that all the models have good agreement when modelling an isothermal ground surface condition and validate the 2 D FEA model against established approaches. The FEA model developed {{has been used to}} investigate more realistic ground surface boundary conditions. Results for different cable burial depths and ground surface boundary conditions show that using the established methods can lead to overestimation of cable ratings in the case of shallow buried cables...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Information {{security}} is only attained when {{all four of}} the classic information assurance goals- confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, and availability – are attained. The work presented focuses exclusively on the availability goal; in particular, maintaining the availability of the physical layer link in an omnidirectional wireless communications system. Hostile jamming is a direct attack on the availability of an information resource. As the United States develops the Global Information Grid (GIG), key management will be a challenging problem. While much progress has been made utilizing asymmetric cryptography and a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) to manage keys that encrypt, decrypt, and authenticate data, the keys used to protect the physical communication layer from hostile jamming are highly vulnerable. In particular, battlefield ad hoc wireless networks are at significant risk. Preferred jam resistant methods rely on highly-directional links (e. g., beam-forming antennas, lasers, or physical <b>cable),</b> but realistic <b>operational</b> environments will continue to rely heavily on omnidirectional radio frequency (RF) links as well. Presently, such links rely on spread spectrum techniques for jam-resistance, all which currently require symmetric (shared-secret) keys. While shared-secret schemes are workable in small networks, the scale and nature of theater-wide, mobile, ad-hoc wireless networks will quickly overwhelm any practical key management strategy. Not only will the initial distribution of keys be difficult, but preventing keys from being compromised and re-keyin...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe thesis in hand has {{investigated}} {{the feasibility of}} a cable electric ferry concept. The concept investigated is based on that a short route ferry receives its propulsive power through a cable connected to the land power grid. Four cable transfer configurations and associated equipment have been looked upon. The cable can either be stretched in the air over the route, it can float after the ferry, it can be towed submerged after the ferry, or it can follow the bottom contours after the ferry. The three latter configurations required storage and cable handling equipment, which can either be located onboard the ferry or on shore. The cable is reeled out under transit and spooled in on the way back. The air stretched configuration requires an arm type connection between the ferry and the cable {{in order to receive}} power. Current available technology has been assessed for concept realization in terms of cable and handling equipment. In addition, regulations for power onboard and emergency power systems are viewed upon, as well as regulations on emissions to air. Competing and alternative power systems to the concept have also been assessed. Lastly, a case study for concept implementation has been conducted. Findings made in the thesis include that current cable material composition and layer configurations will need engineering in terms of increasing strength, and reducing weight and dimension without influencing conductivity. Current cable handling equipment used in offshore cable laying vessels have good tension specifications for the concept, but compared to alternative power sources such as diesel- and LNG-gensets they have large weights and dimensions, and their operational handling speed is low for high tension levels. This gives that current technology would need development for concept realization. Weights and dimensions must be reduced, and handling speed must be increased such that the ferry is able to operate in normal transit with speed and payload. Further, the concept has also been economically compared with alternative power sources. With current technology the concept costs exceed the cost of competing alternatives, where the most expensive concept component is the cable. The cable cost exceeds the cost of a new LNG-genset. Cable handling equipment costs are relatively low compared to the <b>cable.</b> As for <b>operational</b> costs, electricity is found comparable with current LNG prices. But for maintenance costs, the concept is far more expensive than for instance a LNG-genset, because the cable will have relatively low operational lifecycle due to wear and fatigue, and will have to be replaced a lot sooner than gensets. And a genset can increase operational lifecycle by being overhauled, where pistons, bearings and seals are replaced. The concept is found physically feasible, but to meet the specification requirements equipment and components will need engineering and analyses. Economically, the concept is rather insufficient, but future local emission regulations and fuel costs may make the concept achievable. </p...|$|R
