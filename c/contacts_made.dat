5|$|Many other {{languages}} {{existed in the}} multi-ethnic Empire, {{and some of these}} were given limited official status in their provinces at various times. Notably, {{by the beginning of the}} Middle Ages, Syriac had become more widely used by the educated classes in the far eastern provinces. Similarly Coptic, Armenian, and Georgian became significant among the educated in their provinces, and later foreign <b>contacts</b> <b>made</b> Old Church Slavic, Middle Persian, and Arabic important in the Empire and its sphere of influence.|$|E

25|$|In 2017, U.S. Press Secretary Sean Spicer {{alleged that}} GCHQ had {{conducted}} surveillance on U.S. President Donald Trump, basing the allegation on {{statements made by}} a media commentator during a Fox News segment. The U.S. government formally apologised for the allegations and promised {{they would not be}} repeated.

25|$|Eisner {{attended}} DeWitt Clinton High School. With {{influences that}} included the early 20th-century commercial artist J. C. Leyendecker, he drew for the school newspaper (The Clintonian), the literary magazine (The Magpie) and the yearbook, and did stage design, leading him to consider doing {{that kind of work}} for theater. Upon graduation, he studied under Canadian artist George Brandt Bridgman (1864–1943) for a year at the Art Students League of New York. <b>Contacts</b> <b>made</b> there led to a position as an advertising writer-cartoonist for the New York American newspaper. Eisner also drew $10-a-page illustrations for pulp magazines, including Western Sheriffs and Outlaws.|$|E
25|$|His {{account of}} the Rus is an {{important}} early source {{for the study of}} Russian history. Again, while he may have read such earlier Arabic authors as ibn Khurradad, ibn al-Faqih, ibn Rusta and ibn Fadlan, al-Mas‘udi presented most of his material based on his personal observations and <b>contacts</b> <b>made</b> while traveling. He informed the Arabic reader that the Rus were more than just a few traders. They were a diverse and varied collection of peoples. He noted their independent attitude, the absence of a strong central authority among them and their paganism. He was very well informed on Rus trade with the Byzantines and on the competence of the Rus in sailing merchant vessels and warships. He was aware that the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea are two separate bodies of water.|$|E
25|$|Wheatley {{moved into}} a career in management, {{applying}} lessons learned and <b>contacts</b> <b>made</b> with his band to managing other bands. He spent several years in UK and America, {{on the eve of}} his return to Australia at the end of 1974, he was invited to manage the reformed version of Australian harmony-rock band Mississippi, after a name change to Little River Band they set about cracking the American market and Wheatley was instrumental guiding them to their historic American commercial breakthrough in 1976–1977. From 1980 Wheatley also managed John Farnham and oversaw his career revival, initially as a solo artist and then as a member of Little River Band, eventually mortgaging his own house to finance Farnham's hugely successful solo album Whispering Jack in 1986. Under Wheatley's guidance, Farnham staged a spectacular comeback as an adult pop artist when Whispering Jack became the biggest-selling locally produced album in Australian recording history.|$|E
50|$|A study {{conducted}} by E. Burke Rochford Jr. at the University of California found that there are four types of contact between those in ISKCON and prospective members. Those are: individually motivated <b>contact,</b> <b>contact</b> <b>made</b> with members in public arenas, <b>contact</b> <b>made</b> through personal connections, and contact with sympathizers of the movement who strongly encourage people to join.

25|$|Wright and {{his family}} moved to Chicago in 1927. After {{securing}} employment as a United States postal clerk, during his time off, he read other writers and studied their styles. When he was fired from the post office during the Great Depression, Wright was forced to go on relief in 1931. In 1932, he began attending meetings of the John Reed Club. As the club was dominated by the Communist Party, Wright established a relationship with several party members. Especially interested in the literary <b>contacts</b> <b>made</b> at the meetings, Wright formally joined the Communist Party in late 1933. As a revolutionary poet, he wrote numerous proletarian poems ("We of the Red Leaves of Red Books", for example), for The New Masses and other left-wing periodicals. A power struggle within the Chicago chapter of the John Reed Club had led to the dissolution of the club's leadership; Wright was told he had the support of the club's party members if he was willing to join the party.|$|E
25|$|The Villa’s {{interior}} {{architecture and}} decoration perhaps {{makes it the}} most notable example of Art Deco style in Portugal. This was a comparatively late intervention, {{in comparison with the}} majority of Art Deco buildings in Europe - explained by the many visits and <b>contacts</b> <b>made</b> by the owner and also the delays that occurred in construction of the building itself. Indeed, the 2nd Count of Vizela first became acquainted with the canons of this style in France, where he lived, and he visited the leading Art deco exhibition held in Paris in 1925. He then invited some of the leading figures from the international artistic panorama of that time to work on the project. Émile-Jacques Ruhlman designed the dining room, hall, salon, cloakroom and billiard room. Alfred Porteneuve, who worked in the same atelier, endowed Serralves with its charismatic pink colouring. René Lalique designed the large skylight of the main hall’s ceiling, on the first floor.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, in 1938, the PCP {{had been}} {{expelled}} from the Comintern. The reason for the expulsion {{was a sense of}} distrust in the Comintern caused by a sudden breakdown in the party's activity after a period of strong communist tumult in the country, accusations of alleged embezzlement of money carried out by some important members of the party and, mainly, the weak internal structure of the party, dominated by internal wars. The action against the PCP, signed by Georgi Dimitrov, was in part taken due to some persecution against Comintern member parties or persons (like the Communist Party of Poland or Béla Kun) led by Joseph Stalin. These series of events would, in part, lead {{to the end of the}} Comintern in 1943. The PCP would only reestablish its relations with the communist movement and the Soviet Union in 1947, after sporadic <b>contacts</b> <b>made</b> through the communist parties of Spain and France and later through Mikhail Suslov.|$|E

500|$|Arthur {{returned}} {{to being a}} lawyer, {{and with the help}} of additional <b>contacts</b> <b>made</b> in the military, he and the firm of Arthur & Gardiner flourished. [...] Even as his professional life improved, however, Arthur and his wife experienced a personal tragedy as their only child, William, died suddenly that year at the age of three. [...] The couple took their son's death hard, and when they had another son, Chester Alan Jr., in 1864, they lavished attention on him. [...] They also had a daughter, Ellen, in 1871. Both children survived to adulthood.|$|E
500|$|For award purposes, amateur radio {{operators}} {{consider the}} UN headquarters a separate [...] "entity" [...] under some award {{programs such as}} DXCC. For communications, UN organizations have their own internationally recognized ITU prefix, 4U. However, only <b>contacts</b> <b>made</b> with the UN Headquarters in New York, and the ITU count as separate entities. Other UN {{organizations such as the}} World Bank count for the state or country they are located in. The UN Staff Recreation Council operates amateur radio station 4U1UN, and occasionally use special callsigns with prefix 4U and ending in UN to commemorate various events at the UN.|$|E
500|$|After {{the end of}} World War II, the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRJ) was formed. One of {{the first}} {{diplomatic}} <b>contacts</b> <b>made</b> with the new communist government was the US Department of State's request for the US Army to testify at the Mihailović trial. However, the request was shunned and early relations between the United States {{and the government of}} Josip Broz Tito became strained, as American diplomats were furious over Mihailović's execution in 1946. Relations degraded even further a month later, when two USAF C-47 Skytrain cargo aircraft were shot down over Yugoslavia in the space of two weeks. More USAF aircraft were shot down over Yugoslavia up to 1948. As a result, U.S. senator Thomas Dodd staunchly opposed American financial aid to Tito's government, even saying that [...] "Tito had bloodied hands." [...] In one of Josip Broz Tito's early visits to the United States, protesters in San Pedro drowned an effigy of him.|$|E
50|$|During punts {{and field}} goals, the referee observes the kicker (and holder) and any <b>contact</b> <b>made</b> by {{defenders}} approaching them.On a punt out of bounds, {{he uses his}} vantage point behind the punter to direct the nearest sideline official {{to the spot where}} the ball went out of bounds.|$|R

500|$|Fender {{initially}} {{wanted to}} be a barrister, but his family could not afford the costs. By 1914, he was working for the [...] firm of paper manufacturers and stationers [...] of which his father was managing director. Although he permitted Fender to play cricket, his father believed that sport and a business career were incompatible. Fender disagreed, suggesting that the <b>contacts</b> <b>made</b> in county cricket offset the lost working time. To aid his business career, Fender moved to London during the winter of 1913–14. Fender was qualified by his birthplace to play for Surrey, and the county was happy to register him for the County Championship. [...] Fender attended to business matters before and after each day's play, and often combined Surrey's trips to away matches with business meetings. Socially, Fender became a familiar figure in clubs and the theatre. He became friends with the actor Jack Hulbert and developed an interest in musical theatre, for which he provided financial support; he also wrote lyrics for some songs. By the end of the 1914 season, Fender had [...] convinced his father that he could successfully combine cricket and business. His improvement as a cricketer was recognised when was chosen as one of Wisden's Cricketers of the Year for 1914.|$|E
2500|$|The {{wide variety}} of {{contests}} attracts a large variety of contesters and contest stations. [...] The rules and structure of a particular contest can determine the strategies used by competitors to maximize the number of <b>contacts</b> <b>made</b> and multipliers earned. [...] Some stations and operators specialize in certain contests, and either rarely operate in others, or compete in them with less seriousness. [...] As with other sports, contest rules evolve over time, and rule changes {{are one of the}} primary sources of controversy in the sport.|$|E
2500|$|Contesting (also {{known as}} radiosport) is a {{competitive}} activity pursued by amateur radio operators. [...] In a contest, an amateur radio station, {{which may be}} operated by an individual or a team, seeks to contact as many other amateur radio stations as possible in a given {{period of time and}} exchange information. [...] Rules for each competition define the amateur radio bands, the mode of communication that may be used, and the kind of information that must be exchanged. [...] The <b>contacts</b> <b>made</b> during the contest contribute to a score by which stations are ranked. [...] Contest sponsors publish the results in magazines and on web sites.|$|E

50|$|Another idea {{of recent}} {{interest}} is the ferroelectric tunnel junction (FTJ) in which a <b>contact</b> <b>made</b> up by nanometer-thick ferroelectric film placed between metal electrodes.
