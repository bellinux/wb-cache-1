The {{flue gas}} turbine {{discussed}} in this article have relatively backward pneumatic design, low operating efficiency, as well as problems of vibration, catalyst accumulation and fouling etc. It cannot realize better generating power effect because of short running cycle, high failure rate, and low recovery of heat and pressure energy generated of high temperature flue gas. To solve the above problems, this article proposes failure analysis. Flue gas turbine problems appear for the main reasons: the steam of the regeneration standpipe reach the regenerator, lead to catalyst breaking and give rise to a large number of <b>catalyst</b> <b>fines,</b> which causes the third cyclone separator blocked and the flue gas turbine fouled. Then, repair the leakage point of regeneration standpipe, maintain smooth operation,and transform leaf type of flue gas turbine.

However, most correlations fall short in providing an accurate prediction of the entrainment rate. Many correlations assume that smaller particles have a higher entrainment rate than larger particles; but, this is often not the case. Smaller particles can, and often do, have lower effective entrainment rates than larger particles. This has been presumed from several different experiments. In one case, the entrainment rate of FCC <b>catalyst</b> <b>fines</b> was measured at different fluidized bed heights and found that higher entrainment fluxes were observed at lower bed heights (i. e., higher disengaging heights).

Compared to typical industry pump performance, run lengths were shorter, and cost per installed was higher. The application requires pumps capable of withstanding significant <b>catalyst</b> <b>fines.</b> Several wear resistant products {{have been used}} in pumps. However, all are limited {{due to the nature of}} the technologies. Thermal spray coatings and weld overlays can be used in ?line of sight? applications, but not for small interior surfaces. Thermal sprays suffer from failures of the mechanical bond. There is preferential erosion of the soft matrix between the hard particles in weld overlays. Hard diffusion coatings (boronizing) are very thin and can be punctured by large abrasive particles. Infiltration brazed tungsten carbide cladding (IBTCC) solves many of these issues. IBTCC was developed for extreme wear applications with difficult geometries such as downhole drilling tools and coal fired power plants. IBTCC combines a true metallurgical bond and a dense, uniform distribution of tungsten carbide particles throughout the coating, to create excellent erosion resistance and toughness in complex geometries. After 13 months in service, an IBTCC cycle oil pump showed no significant signs of internal erosion. This technology has also been applied to FCCU fractionator bottoms and debutanizer reboiler services, with no signs to date of increased vibration or loss of hydraulic performance.

40|$|Slurry phase Fischer-Tropsch {{technology}} was successfully demonstrated in DOE's Alternative Fuels Development Unit (AFDU) at LaPorte, Texas. Earlier work at LaPorte, with iron catalysts in 1992 and 1994, had established proof-of-concept status for the slurry phase process. The third campaign (Fischer-Tropsch III), in 1996, aimed at aggressively extending the operability of the slurry reactor using a proprietary cobalt catalyst. Due to an irreversible plugging of catalyst-wax separation filters {{as a result}} of unexpected <b>catalyst</b> <b>fines</b> generation, the operations had to be terminated after seven days on-stream. Following an extensive post-run investigation by the participants, the campaign was successfully completed in March-April 1998, with an improved proprietary cobalt catalyst. These runs were sponsored by the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE), Air Products & Chemicals, Inc., and Shell Synthetic Fuels, Inc. (SSFI). A productivity of approximately 140 grams (gm) of hydrocarbons (HC) / hour (hr) -liter (lit) of expanded slurry volume was achieved at reasonable system stability during the second trial (Fischer-Tropsch IV). The productivity ranged from 110 - 140 at various conditions during the 18 days of operations. The catalyst/wax filters performed well throughout the demonstration, producing a clean wax product. For the most part, only one of the four filter housings was needed for catalyst/wax filtration. The filter flux appeared to exceed the design flux. A combination of use of a stronger catalyst and some innovative filtration techniques were responsible for this success. There was no sign of catalyst particle attrition and very little erosion of the slurry pump was observed, in contrast to the Fischer-Tropsch III operations. The reactor operated hydrodynamically stable with uniform temperature profile and gas hold-ups. Nuclear density and differential pressure measurements indicated somewhat higher than expected gas hold-up (45 - 50 vol%) during Fischer-Tropsch IV operations. The high gas hold-up was confirmed by a dynamic gas disengagement test conducted {{at the end of the}} run. Heat transfer in the reactor was better than expected. Heat, mass and elemental balance calculations indicated excellent closure. After the initial learning curve with system dynamics, the plant was restarted very quickly (24 hours and 17 hours) following two plant trips. This demonstrates the ease and flexibility of the slurry technology. In-situ reduction of catalyst pre-cursor was completed successfully during F-T IV operations. Water measurements proved to be inaccurate due to wax/oil contamination of the analytical system. However, the reduction appeared to proceed well as close to expected syngas conversion was obtained at the beginning of the run. The selectivity to wax was lower than expected, with higher methane selectivity. Returning to the baseline condition indicated a productivity decline from 135 - 140 to 125 - 130 gm HC/hr-lit. of reactor volume in two weeks of operation. This may be a result of some catalyst loss from the reactor as well as initial catalyst deactivation. Significant quantities of product and samples were collected for further processing and analysis by the participants. Gas, liquid and solid phase mixing were studied as planned at two operating conditions using radioactive materials.
