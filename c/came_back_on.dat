25|$|Then Geraint Jones smacked two fours off Hussey {{to end the}} over, {{meaning that}} England needed 39 off 36 balls. Five balls later, a miscued sweep off Hogg hit Geraint Jones on the pads – gone for 71 – and England only had three wickets to spare. Two more balls were {{delivered}} before that tally was cut down to two – Hussey bowled Simon Jones for a two-ball one, so with Gough and Giles in, England needed 35 off 29 balls. Despite taking the runs off Hussey, Brett Lee's 47th over only yielded a single, as his variations of length {{turned out to be}} just the thing. However, Ponting now needed another over from either Hussey, Hogg or Symonds – deciding to use Hussey, he was punished, as Giles hit twos to both the off and leg side, and a wide from Hussey resulting in a nine-run over. Lee then <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>on,</b> and with his short ball had Giles playing a definitely unorthodox stroke – a sliced edge over Gilchrist's head for four.|$|E

Four days later on SmackDown, Punk denied an alliance with The Shield before calling them out and informing them {{that he did not}} want them to interfere in his upcoming title match. However, during Punk's title match at the Royal Rumble on January 27 a blackout occurred, The Rock was attacked by The Shield in the darkness and when the lights <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> he had been put through the announce table, leading to Punk pinning The Rock and retaining the title, only for the match to be immediately restarted by McMahon with The Rock winning the WWE Championship.
