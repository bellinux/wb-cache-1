40|$|In {{comparison}} to conventional heat treatments, laser beam hardening has some specific advantages. As {{a result of}} the locally limited heat input, the distortion of the material is essentially reduced. Because of the self-quenching process it is possible to abandon cooling agents and additionally laser hardening is well qualified for the integration in automated manufacturing systems. In the field of transformation hardening, Nd:YAG-lasers are superior to CO 2 -lasers due to higher energy impact into the material and their greater flexibility. By using pulsed mode, case hardness and <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> <b>depth</b> are increased. The material is exposed to a rapid thermal cycling during the pulsed laser treatment. The aim of the examinations are the description of the microstructure, the distribution of hardness and residual stress and the resulting fatigue limit in dependence on the laser parameters. On flat bending 42 CrMo 4 specimens single tracks in longitudinal direction were locally hardened with various laser parameters. The laser pulse frequency was varied between 12. 5 Hz and 100 Hz. It has been found, that surface melting causes high roughness, high tensile stresses over the whole track surface and has a detrimental effect on the fatigue limit. Hardening in the solid phase results in high compressive residual stresses in the track and tensile stress peak values in the heat affected zones, a very fine martensitic structure and in {{comparison to}} conventional heating higher hardness values...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTo achieve {{knowledge}} {{of the effects of}} broaching to the component and the influence on subsequent process steps such as heat treatment and hard machining, broaching experiments were performed on plates made of normalized <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> steel SAE 5120 in [1]. To investigate the effect of heat treatment, five broaching variants of [1] were chosen and hardened with two different <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> <b>depths,</b> which were observed for effects generated from the surface layer carbon fraction. The hardened variants were analyzed for distortion generated through the hardening step and the specimen subsequently underwent a hard broaching stage in dry machining conditions. The cutting forces were monitored in-process, and the residual stress of the machined surface was determined using X-ray diffraction after the experiment. Surface roughness measurements also complemented the results. The results indicated that the cutting forces depend on existing distortion and therefore the volume material removed. It can also be seen that there is little influence on cutting forces with rising cutting speeds. Compressive residual stresses were present after heat treatment, but turned into tensile residual stress states after hard broaching. Effects from different <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> <b>depths</b> and cutting speeds in the formation of surface roughness and residual stress could not be detected...|$|R

Four different grades of steel, 42 CrMo 4, C 45, X 153 CrMoV 12. 1 and 90 MnCrV 8, were laser hardened up to a depth of 1. 5 mm. The construction of a laser acoustic handheld probe enabled the measurement of the propagation velocity of the {{surface acoustic waves}} on large components. The measurement yields the velocity of the surface acoustic wave depending on frequency in a range from 1 to 10 MHz. The varying frequency enables the surface acoustic waves to penetrate varying depth of the material.

This methodology rests {{on the assumption that the}} velocity of the acoustic wave varies, if the microstructure of the steel is hardened by a martensitic transformation.

40|$|AbstractSteel alloys are the {{material}} that is most used in protective constructions today. The reason is the overall good properties of steels, with its high strength and hardness, high ductility, high formability and relatively low cost compared to other materials. Even though armour steels are affordable, work is done to limit expenses from production or {{come up with new}} and less expensive alloys. <b>Case</b> <b>hardening</b> is a technique for production of steel with a very hard and durable surface while still maintaining a tough and ductile core. <b>Case</b> <b>hardened</b> products have hard, durable and fatigue resistant surfaces and tough and durable cores. <b>Case</b> <b>hardening</b> is typically applied to machine parts that are exposed to heavy wear and high loads such as gears, bearings, screws and nuts, shafts, etc	In 2010, Lou et al. managed to significantly increase the penetration resistance of a low-cost steel (NVE 36) by <b>case</b> <b>hardening.</b> Encouraged by this, Hans Magne Thorseth wrote his master s thesis Optimalisering av stål i beskyttelseskonstruksjoner in 2010. His attempt to improve the ballistic strength of Hardox 450 steel by <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> did not have the desired results. The ballistic limit velocity was reduced from approximately 800 m/s for the original Hardox 450 to approximately 770 m/s for the <b>case</b> <b>hardened</b> steel. The probable reasons for the reduction of the ballistic limit velocity was a too low carbon content increase from the carburizing and thus a too low hardness increase, in addition to deterioration of the metal core properties from the heat treatment. The objective of this master s thesis was to improve the <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> process used by Hans Magne Thorseth in his master s thesis. The improvement work was divided into two parts, a preliminary project work and this master thesis. The project was carried out in the autumn of 2010, and the aim was to find the optimum <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> process to produce steel with improved ballistic properties. This involved testing of different carburizing potentials to increase the surface carbon content of the metal and to find carburizing heat treatments that would retain the core properties of the carburized steel. Based on the results from the preliminary project it seemed possible to produce <b>case</b> <b>hardened</b> steel with surface hardness over 1000 HV, but a slight reduction of core hardness was difficult to avoid. The present master s thesis was written during the spring of 2011. The key results from the preliminary project work were used to determine a range of <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> courses. A total of 11 <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> courses were tested, of which six courses employed carbon potential of 0. 9 % and five courses employed a carbon potential of 1. 1 %. Different hardening courses were tested, including direct hardening, a modified single hardening process and traditional and modified versions of double and triple <b>hardening.</b> Before the <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> the plates were sandblasted to remove a corrosion-resistant primer that was applied to the plates. The primer was believed to limit the diffusion of carbon into the steel. In the preliminary project the primer was ground away and grinding was the preferred solution in this work as well, however, due to capacity issues sandblasting was employed. The ballistic limit velocity of the <b>case</b> <b>hardened</b> and the original Hardox 450 target plates were calculated from results obtained by ballistic experiments. The ballistic limit velocities of the <b>case</b> <b>hardened</b> samples, with approximately 787 m/s as the highest, were lower than that of the original Hardox 450, being approximately 800 m/s. 	Surface hardness measurements of the steel revealed a poor effect from the carburization, the hardest surface was measured at 735 HV. This could be explained by a probable surface decarburization of the original Hardox 450, which was discovered by microstructure examinations and hardness measurements. In contrary to in the preliminary project where this layer was ground away, the sandblasting did not remove the decarburized layer. Due to this, the <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> did not have the desired effect on the steel surface, resulting in a too low surface hardness. 	The core hardness proved difficult to retain, the highest core hardness value obtained was below 460 HV, compared to the original Hardox 450 with core hardness of 475 HV. This could be another reason for the lower ballistic limit velocity of the carburized steel plates. However, the original Hardox 450 did not have the highest cross-sectional hardness integral value, so the ballistic properties probably also depend to some degree on ductility. A main reason for the superior ballistic limit velocity of the original Hardox 450 was therefore believed to be related to cracking of the rear side of the <b>case</b> <b>hardened</b> target plates during projectile penetration. The cracking seemed to be a result of the harder, and thus more brittle, outer surface layer...|$|R
