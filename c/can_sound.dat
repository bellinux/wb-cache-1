5|$|Both {{males and}} females utilize calls in alarm situations, {{especially}} in territorial disputes and encounters with predators. Males alone produce the cheer call, which <b>can</b> <b>sound</b> indistinct. In southern regions of their range, the sound males use in alarm disputes is a ringing pink or p'dink sound. Females {{are the only ones}} that can perform the paired dit-dit or chatter sounds. The former can be used in territorial disputes with predators, and with at least northern populations the songs are used in alternation with the males cheer chant. The chatter is used exclusively with territorial encounters with male song, and the song can either follow or overlap her mate's song.|$|E
5|$|The Nord Stage is multitimbral – {{each of the}} Piano, Organ, and Synth {{sections}} <b>can</b> <b>sound</b> independently. There are two Panels – A and B – each {{of which}} provides a separate configuration of the three sections within a single Program. Panels can be played independently, {{with one of the}} panels being controlled via an external MIDI keyboard controller, or they can be layered together, allowing for a maximum of 6 part multitimbral. Most of the buttons and knobs on the Stage, such as volume, instrument selection, drawbar levels (for organ) or filter controls (for synthesizer) can also be adjusted by the external keyboard.|$|E
5|$|Tracheal {{collapse}} {{is caused}} by a weakening of the tracheal rings in the windpipe. It occurs when the rings that normally hold the shape of the windpipe collapse, closing the airway. The symptoms of a collapse include a honking cough that <b>can</b> <b>sound</b> similar to a goose honk, an intolerance to exercise, fainting spells and a cough that is worsened by hot weather, exercise and excitement. The tendency for episodes of tracheal collapse typically increases in frequency and severity as the dog ages.|$|E

50|$|Micrometeorology is {{significant}} in that <b>sound</b> waves <b>can</b> be refracted by wind gradients or thermoclines, effectively dismissing {{the effect of}} some noise barriers or terrain intervention.

5|$|The {{artificial}} intelligence (AI) in NOLF was significantly advanced {{at the time}} of the game's release. Enemy AI can react to eleven different stimuli, including hearing the player's footsteps or weapon firing, seeing the player's footprints in the snow, or hearing an ally scream in pain. The AI can try and investigate the source of these stimuli, by following the footprints for example, and <b>can</b> <b>sound</b> alarms or call for backup. During combat, the AI finds cover positions, and, to some extent, can also use its environment for protection, such as flipping over a table and hiding behind it. After advancing AI technology in their subsequent games, Monolith likened the way NOLFs AIs pop randomly in and out of cover to a shooting gallery. Groups of AI guards make use of a group logic when investigating and combating the player. For example, one guard might start firing at the player, while another runs and calls for backup. The game's AI includes friendly and enemy humans, as well as dogs, sharks, and helicopters.|$|E

25|$|Many {{traditional}} instruments underwent {{changes in}} the early to mid 20th century which has a profound effect on the performance and sound of Chinese music, and a western equal temperament is now used to tune most traditional instruments, which to modern ears seem less harsh and more harmonious but which also robs the instruments of their traditional voices. To ears now used to hearing modern tunings, even Chinese ones, traditional tunings <b>can</b> <b>sound</b> out of tune and discordant.|$|E

25|$|Tagalog profanity {{can refer}} {{to a wide range}} of offensive, blasphemous, and taboo words or {{expressions}} in the Tagalog language of the Philippines. Due to Filipino culture, expressions which may sound benign when translated back to English can cause great offense; while some expressions English speakers might take great offense to <b>can</b> <b>sound</b> benign to a Tagalog speaker. Filipino, the national language of the Philippines, is the standard register of Tagalog, so as such the terms Filipino profanity and Filipino swear words are sometimes also employed.|$|E
25|$|However, {{in order}} for a {{receiver}} to reproduce the transmitted audio without distortion, it must be tuned to exactly the same frequency as the transmitter. Since this is difficult to achieve in practice, SSB transmissions <b>can</b> <b>sound</b> unnatural, and if the error in frequency is great enough, it can cause poor intelligibility. In order to correct this, a small amount of the original carrier signal can be transmitted so that receivers with the necessary circuitry to synchronize with the transmitted carrier can correctly demodulate the audio. This mode of transmission is called reduced-carrier single-sideband.|$|E
25|$|In part writing, {{the usage}} of Conjunct Melodic Motion is important, in which the parts {{generally}} move in stepwise motion, and in counterpoint, {{if there is a}} leap (a jump of a fourth or above), the part will progress the opposite direction it just leapt in stepwise motion. Parts also must progress together in contrary motion, meaning the parts are going in different directions. This is preferable to parallel motion, where the parts move together, or oblique motion, where one part doesn’t move and another does. Parallel motion can be used, {{but it is important to}} pay attention to intervals in order to avoid breaking counterpoint rules. Dissonant intervals, both melodic and harmonic intervals are not preferable in most cases. This includes augmented or diminished intervals, tritones, and seventh chords, simply because they sound very jarring in a piece that is meant to sound pleasant to the ear. Parallel intervals, which occur when two parts move the same distance creating the same interval twice in a row, are also important to be aware of. However, this is only a problem when the intervals are either a perfect fifth or a perfect octave. These also <b>can</b> <b>sound</b> uncomfortable to the ear as they tend to have an open or hollow sound.|$|E

He wrote that using [...] "you" [...] in imperatives is more common with people under 25. In her 2001 book The Facts on File Dictionary of Clichés, Christina Ammer wrote about the growing usage of [...] "have a good meal" [...] in restaurants.

[...] On Chart Attack, despite the album's being [...] "overwrought" [...] its [...] "quality songwriting and some killer arrangements conceal Where You Want to Bes occasional off-the-chart cheese readings." [...] Although Drowned in Sound writer Mat Hocking expected the album {{to be one of the}} [...] "grittiest, most emotionally driving punk-pop records of the year," [...] it turned out to be [...] "an album that's playing it far too safe: melodies rise and fall, soaring and curving with painful predictability." ...|$|E

Writing in 2013, Mark Pedelty would say that [...] "Biko" [...] "stood out for its unusual instrumentation (bagpipes and synthesizer), haunting vocals, and funerary chant," [...] and credited Gabriel with doing a [...] "masterful job of creating catalytic imagery and getting out of the way". Music scholar Michael Drewett wrote that the lyrics skillfully engaged the listener by moving from a specific story to a call for action.|$|E

500|$|Romney's {{greatest}} weakness {{was a lack}} {{of foreign}} policy expertise and a need for a clear position on the Vietnam War. [...] The press coverage of the trip focused on Vietnam and reporters were frustrated by Romney's initial reluctance to speak about it. [...] The qualities that helped Romney as an industry executive worked against him as a presidential candidate; he had difficulty being articulate, often speaking at length and too forthrightly on a topic and then later correcting himself while maintaining he was not. [...] Reporter Jack Germond joked {{that he was going to}} add a single key on his typewriter that would print, [...] "Romney later explained...." [...] Life magazine wrote that Romney [...] "manages to turn self-expression into a positive ordeal" [...] and that he was no different in private: [...] "nobody <b>can</b> <b>sound</b> more like the public George Romney than the real George Romney let loose to ramble, inevitably away from the point and toward some distant moral precept." ...|$|E

The songs <b>can</b> <b>sound</b> like musical cotton candy — soft, airy and ultimately uninteresting. [...] "For the most part, Bradley's music doesn't make that mistake." [...] "The music is cinematic, filled with introspective piano solos, swelling violins, and a hypnotic song pacing that allows the listener to daydream." [...] Along the same line, Michael Debbage of Mainly Piano says that Rapture almost single-handedly gave a sense of hope that {{there was much more}} that the New Age genre could offer.
