New features to the series include a cooperative multiplayer mode, a new plot, additional types of piñata creatures, Xbox Live Vision Camera support, and two new areas for capturing piñatas.|$|E
5|$|A {{historic}} preservation movement in Omaha {{has led to}} a number of historic structures and districts being designated Omaha Landmarks or listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Much of the push toward preservation came after Omaha gained the notorious designation of having, in 1989, demolished the largest-ever National Register historic district in the United States, a record that still stands as of 2013. The Jobbers Canyon Historic District, along the Missouri River, was felled for a new headquarters campus for ConAgra Foods, a company which threatened to relocate if Omaha did not allow them to raze the city's historic district. The Jobber's Canyon warehouses had before then been allowed to deteriorate and were the scene of several fires set by the homeless population that had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> in the abandoned buildings. At the time, there were no plans in place for revitalizing the buildings.|$|E
5|$|After first {{arriving}} at Fort Crockett, Middleton adapted to garrison life while {{engaging in the}} Galveston social scene by attending Saturday night dances in town. At one such dance he had a navy lieutenant introduce him to Jerusha Collins, who would later become his wife. She had attended Southwestern University in Georgetown, Texas and had made her debut in Galveston society in 1911. Following {{the death of her}} father, Sidney G. Collins, Jerusha had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> with her aunt and uncle, Mr. and Mrs. John Hagemann, in the heart of Galveston. As a merchant, Hagemann was well to do, and drove a Studebaker touring car when most people in the town rode in buggies, wagons, and surreys. Middleton met the Hagemanns, soon becoming a regular visitor at their house while calling on Jerusha.|$|E

Wythe also revised his will in early 1806 because Thomas Jefferson had agreed to educate the young mulatto, although those new provisions would have no effect if Brown died before Sweeney, as happened.|$|E

25|$|Concentrated in San Miguel de Allende {{are foreign}} {{residents}} {{mostly from the}} United States and Canada who have <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> because of the area's mild climate, cultural opportunities and low crime.

Estimates of foreign residents range from 8,000 to 12,000 with about 7,000 of these from the United States alone. This makes San Miguel one of the largest American communities in Mexico, large enough to warrant its own U.S. consulate to provide services such as notary and passport.|$|E

Tony is furious and promptly confronts Neville, returning later covered in blood. Despite their past problems, Tony and Hannah decide to give their marriage another chance and both she and Cassie <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> in Albert Square. Problems still persist, however, and Hannah regularly nags Tony and makes it clear to him that Walford {{is not good enough}} for her. Things reach a climax when Tony hits Mehmet Osman (Haluk Bilginer) in February 1987 for making a pass at Hannah. Hannah is furious and can't condone his violent actions, despite willingly allowing him to assault her ex-lover months earlier.

25|$|The {{existence}} of the Lancashire League {{is a testament to}} local cricketers and their supporters, but the sheer quantity and quality of the professional cricketers that have been drawn to the milltowns of East Lancashire and the surrounding area is astonishing. Players {{from all over the world}} have <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> and play in the League including: Dik Abed, Bill Alley, Nyron Asgarali, Nathan Astle, Sydney Barnes, Allan Border, Chris Cairns, Sir Learie Constantine, Kapil Dev, Allan Donald, Bruce Dooland, Roy Gilchrist, Denis Lillee, Trevor Chappell, Jason Gillespie, Kerry O'Keeffe, Charlie Griffith, Andrew Hall, Wes Hall, Roger Harper, Chris Harris, George Headley, Michael Holding, Murali Kartik, Charlie Llewellyn, Clive Lloyd, Manny Martindale, Cec Pepper, Viv Richards, Andy Roberts, Fred Root, Jacques Rudolph, Peter Sleep, 'Big' Jim Smith, Hugh Tayfield, George Tribe, Lou Vincent, Shane Warne, Chester Watson, Steve Waugh, Bilawal Bhatti, Alviro Petersen, Robin Petersen and Everton Weekes. Its is a rule of the competition that each team must have a professional player in their squad. Should the professional be unavailable then a substitute must be found.

25|$|Much of the municipality's {{economy is}} now {{tied to the}} influx of {{tourists}} and foreigners who <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>live,</b> mostly retirees. A Wikipedia sister site Wikivoyage has an entry for San Miguel de Allende. In 2002, 250,000 visitors spent about 8.4 million USD at the town's attractions, but those who live here contribute far more to the economy. Most of this is concentrated {{in the town of}} San Miguel proper. It accounts for over 36% of the municipality's jobs and most of the municipality's income. Tourism accounts for almost all of the municipality's income from outside. This began in the mid 20th century as a cheap place to live; however, despite recent economic downturns, it no longer is. This has not lessened San Miguel's attraction for foreign visitors and retirees as homes and hotels here are still significantly cheaper than in the U.S. or Europe. Despite not having a casino or an airport and being 400 miles from the nearest beach, this small city has been ranked by magazines such as Time and Leisure and Condé Nast Traveler as one of its preferred places to live and visit.|$|E

25|$|Jane's {{paternal}} {{grandfather had}} <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> in the East End of London after escaping the Czarist pogroms {{when he was}} 14. He is listed in the 1911 census as Bethnal Green, working as a hairdresser, and eventually went on to have his own company. Jane's father Benjamin qualified at the UCL Medical School in 1938, and joined the medical branch of the RAFVR after the outbreak of war. Commissioned a flying officer on 25 June 1940, {{he was promoted to}} war-substantive flight lieutenant on 25 June 1941. During the war, he served in England, Belgium, Italy and South Africa. Ending the war as a squadron leader with a mention in despatches, he relinquished his reserve commission on 8 May 1959, retaining the rank of squadron leader. After the war, Frankenberg continued his career at various London hospitals, including at St Leonard's Hospital, Hackney, the East End Maternity Hospital, the City of London Maternity Hospital and finally at Hillingdon Hospital, for which he designed the maternity unit. A close associate of Patrick Steptoe, he assisted in pioneering discussions on in-vitro fertilisation and also published papers on adolescent and teenage sexual behaviours.|$|E
25|$|Outside of {{the town}} proper, {{there are a number}} of other tourist attractions in the municipality. There is one {{registered}} archeological site in the municipality called the Piedra del Conejo ("Rabbit Stone") or Monumental solsticial de Tomacoco ("Solstice monument of Tomacoco"). One of the major attractions is the Panoaya Hacienda. The main hacienda building houses the Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz Museum; it is featured in the reverse of the $200 pesos Mexican note. Sor Juana <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> at Panoaya in 1651 when she was three years old to live with her mother and grandfather. She learned to read and write and stayed until she was sent to live in Mexico City in 1663. The hacienda lay in ruins for the last century or so until it was rehabilitated in 1999 at a cost of more than 10 million pesos. A building next to this one is the International Museum of Volcanos which exhibits of Mexico two most famous volcanoes and others in the world. The hacienda’s main building now serves as the Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz Museum, run by INAH. Much of the rest of the hacienda land is leased to a recreational park which is best known for its petting zoo which contains tame deer.|$|E
