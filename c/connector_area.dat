50|$|Map 2 went to Mirage, {{historically}} one of {{the best}} maps for both VP and Brazilian Counter-Strike, as it was the map FalleN and his former crew, which included boltz and steel, played on as its rise to fame. Immortals jumped out to a dominant 8-1 lead and looked to be a repeat of the Inferno game. In the 10th round, kNg pushed up to the middle area to find NEO quickly. boltz followed up onto TaZ before being traded by Snax. steel quickly flanked Snax and kNg took out byali, leaving pashaBiceps in a 1 vs. 4. He started by catching an unaware steel and then quickly flicked onto kNg while retrieving the bomb. LUCAS1 nearly caught out Snax, but a quick shot onto the head of LUCAS1 allowed pasahBiceps to plant the bomb. With 6 health points, pashaBiceps tricked HEN1 and he caught him looking the other way, putting up a second round. for VP. After two more rounds to the Poles, Immortals took the last three to take another 11-4 lead into the second half. VP started the second half strong, before Immortals found another round. However, VP took the next round, resetting the Immortals's economy and with just one round between the teams, VP looked to take the lead {{for the first time in}} the series. In the 24th round, Snax went into the palace area, which is {{one of the}} entrances to the A bombsite from the terrorist spawn, to catch someone off guard. However, boltz did better with his pistol and he shot Snax right into the head. pashaBiceps missed a shot onto kNg, allowing the new pickup for Immortals to rush in and take the second player down. TaZ attempted to make a play by running into the apartments area in order to catch Immortals with its backs turned, but steel was waiting patiently. HEN1 caught out byali and then bomb was planted. NEO did catch steel and saved his gun, but Immortals took a 13th round. Immortals picked up two more rounds heading to the 27th round. VP did have all the guns it needed, but it lacked severely in utility. HEN1 took out pashaBiceps trying to make a play from the <b>connector</b> <b>area.</b> NEO pushed up onto the short area, which is in middle and leads to the B bombsite, to trade steel. boltz took down byali in the A bombsite and then took out Snax to give Immortals a strong advantage, leaving the two Counter-Strike veterans to clutch. NEO sprayed down kNg in the <b>connector</b> <b>area</b> as the bomb was planted. NEO took a duel against HEN1 and tacked on a lot of damage to HEN1, but it was the AWP that came out on top. TaZ tried to defuse through a smoke NEO had put up on the bomb, but LUCAS1 finished the job as TaZ peeked and Immortals pulled in another upset in a series only 9% of people had the Brazilians winning. pashaBiceps and Snax pulled their weight with 21 and 20 kills, respectively, but other VP members could not in the loss. On the other side, boltz had 23 kills and kNg had 20 kills as the two dominated the server. With Immortals going through to the finals, this guaranteed a new champion.|$|E

Astralis took two rounds, but Gambit jumped to a 15-7 lead before Astralis took three more. In the 26th round, Gambit just lost the previous round and two of its players were on pistols. Zeus continued his slow playstyle. AdreN made his way up to the restrooms area; dev1ce peeked into it and had the upper hand, but missed a shot, which AdreN easily took advantage of. AdreN then took down Kjaerbye and found a headshot on Xyp9x.

40|$|All-ceramic fixed partial {{dentures}} (FPDs) have an esthetic {{approach for}} oral rehabilitation. However, metal-ceramic FPDs are best {{indicated in the}} posterior area where the follow-up studies found a lower failure rate. This 2 D finite element study compared the stress distribution on 3 -unit all-ceramic and metal-ceramic FPDs and identified the areas of major risk of failure. Three FPD models were designed: (1) metal-ceramic FPD; (2) All-ceramic FPD with the veneering porcelain on the occlusal and cervical surface of the abutment tooth; (3) All-ceramic FPD with the veneering porcelain only on the occlusal surface. A 100 N load was applied {{in an area of}} 0. 5 mm² on the working cusps, following these simulations: (1) on the abutment teeth and the pontic; (2) only on the abutment teeth; and (3) only on the pontic. Relative to the maximum stress values found for the physiological load, all-ceramic FPD with only occlusal veneering porcelain produced the lowest stress value (220 MPa), followed by all-ceramic FPD with cervical veneering porcelain (322 MPa) and metal-ceramic FPD (387 MPa). The stress distribution of the load applied on the abutments was significantly better compared to the other two load simulations. The highest principal stress values were low and limited in a small area for the three types of models under this load. When the load was applied on the pontic, the highest stress values appeared on the <b>connector</b> <b>areas</b> between the abutments and pontic. In conclusion, the best stress values and distribution were found for the all-ceramic FPD with the veneering porcelain only on the occlusal surface.

40|$|True {{crystalline}} {{ceramic materials}} presently used in restorative dentistry are Al 2 O 3 (alumina) and yttrium-oxide stabilised tetragonal polycrystalline zirconium-dioxide (Y-TZP). To ensure optimal clinical performance, {{the dimensions of}} the Fixed Partial Denture (FPD) framework in general and of the connectors in particular, must be adequate. Considered recommendations for connector dimensions for Y-TZP FPDs vary from 2 to 4 mm in occluso-gingival height and 2 to 4 mm in bucco-lingual width. In order to reduce the fracture probability when designing all-ceramic FPDs, the shape of the connector is an important factor to consider. The radius of curvature at the gingival embrasure plays {{a significant role in the}} load-bearing capacity. FPDs with small gingival embrasure radii are subjected to high stress concentrations in the <b>connector</b> <b>area</b> during loading, compared to FPDs with large embrasure radii. The aim of this in-vitro study was to investigate how different radii of curvature in the embrasure of the <b>connector</b> <b>area</b> and different connector dimensions could affect the fracture resistance of 3 -unit all-ceramic FPDs made of Y-TZP. Forty-eight FPDs in 6 groups of 8 FPDs with different connector design were produced in Procera Zirconia Bridge material. The FPD cores were subjected to heat treatment to simulate veneering. Following cementation, the FPDs were firstly thermocycled for 5, 000 cycles, then preloaded for 10, 000 cycles and finally loaded to fracture. All the FPDs fractured in the <b>connector</b> <b>area.</b> All the crack propagation which led to fracture started at the gingival embrasure of the connector. Within the limitations of this in-vitro study,the recommended minimum dimension of an anterior 3 -unit all-ceramic FPD of Y-TZP is 3 mm in incisal-cervical direction and 2 mm in buccal-lingual direction. By increasing the radius of the gingival embrasure from 0. 6 to 0. 9 mm, the fracture strength for a Y-TZP FPD with connector dimension 3 x 3 mm increases by 20 %...|$|E
40|$|Reported {{clinical}} {{success rates}} of all-ceramic fixed partial dentures (FPDs) made of high-strength oxide ceramics range between 82. 5 % and 100 %.

The aim of this in-vitro study was, therefore, to compare the fracture strength of four-unit Y-TZP FPD cores designed with different connector diameters. A total of 40 four-unit FPD cores supported by end abutments and having two pontics were manufactured in Procera Zirconia. Five groups of FPD cores with connector dimensions of 2. 0, 2. 5, 3. 0, 3. 5 and 4. 0 mm were produced. All FPD cores underwent a firing programme according to the manufacturer's recommendations for the veneering porcelain, a cyclic preload, thermocycling and finally, load until fracture. Fracture strength was significantly higher for each increase in connector diameter except for the 2. 0 -mm and 2. 5 -mm diameters where all fractures occurred during preload. All FPD cores fractured in the <b>connector</b> <b>area.</b> Within the limitations of this in-vitro study, a minimum diameter of 4. 0 mm is recommended for all-ceramic zirconia-based FPDs with long spans or replacing molars.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the effect of trenched zirconia bar on the von Mises stress distribution of IPS –Empress II core ceramics. Material and Methods: The three-dimensional model including a three-unit bridge from the second premolar to the second molar was designed. The model was reinforced with zirconia bar (ZB), zirconia bar with vertical trench (VZB), and zirconia bar with horizontal trench (HZB) (cross sections of these bars were circular). The model without zirconia bar was designed as the control. The bridges were loaded by 200 N and 500 N on the occlusal surface at the middle of the pontic component, and Von-Mises stresses were evaluated along a defined path. Result: In the <b>connector</b> <b>area,</b> VonMises stress in MPa were approximately identical in the specimens with ZB (at molar connector (MC) : 4. 75, and at premolar connector (PC) : 6. 40) and without ZB (MC: 5. 50, PC: 6. 68), and considerable differences were not recognized.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to investigate, by finite element {{analysis}} (FEA) and fatigue analysis, the influence of different loading conditions on the stress distribution in a 3 -unit implant-supported Y-TZP fixed partial denture (FPD). Material and methods: A three-dimensional FEM model was developed. The materials used in this study were assumed to be linearly elastic, homogeneous and isotropic. 100 N and 300 N loads over a 0, 5 mm 2 areas with different angles (0 °, 15 ° and 35 °) and locations were applied on the prosthesis and the distribution of equivalent von Mises stress was investigated. A fatigue analysis was carried out too. Results: maximum stresses were found at the connector region of the framework when the intermediate element is loaded (100 N load pattern: 32, 9 MPa, 33 MPa and 51, 8 MPa; 300 N load pattern: 98, 6 MPa, 102, 8 MPa and 155, 7 MPa, respectively with 0 °, 15 ° and 35 ° of inclination). Results confirmed the vulnerability of both <b>connector</b> <b>areas</b> even if just one pillar was loaded with an increase in stress when angle of load inclination is larger. The cyclic fatigue evaluation indicates a strong propensity for fatigue behavior, presenting a considerable range of loading conditions. No fracture fatigue occurred with a 100 N force. A 300 N force applied to the pontic produces no fatigue problems because the load is equally shared by whole system. A 300 N force applied to one of the two pillars, or to both implants generates fatigue problems. Conclusion: F. E.

Results: No {{significant difference was found}} between the 4 FRC types veneered with particulate filler composite (893 +/- 459 N to 1326 +/- 391 N) (P =. 1278). Complete pontic fracture at the <b>connector</b> <b>area</b> was most prominent for FRC 4 (90 %), followed by FRC 3 (70 %). Only FRC 2 (10 %) showed some fiber fractures, with half of the fiber remaining attached on the enamel surface of the abutment. Conclusion: The fracture strengths of cantilever FPDs made of 4 FRC materials with different monomer matrices and architectures, veneered with particulate filler composite, did not show significant differences. However, failure behavior varied between groups...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Chipping within {{veneering}} porcelain {{has resulted}} in high clinical failure rates for implant-supported zirconia (yttria-tetragonal zirconia polycrystals [Y-TZP]) bridges. This study evaluated the reliability and failure modes of mouth-motion step-stress fatigued implant-supported Y-TZP versus palladium-silver alloy (PdAg) three-unit bridges. Materials and Methods: Implant-abutment replicas were embedded in polymethylmethacrylate resin. Y-TZP and PdAg frameworks, of similar design (n = 21 each), were fabricated, veneered, cemented (n = 3 each), and Hertzian contact-tested to obtain ultimate failure load. In each framework group, 18 specimens were distributed across three step-stress profiles and mouth-motion cyclically loaded according to the profile on the lingual slope of the buccal cusp of the pontic. Results: PdAg failures included competing flexural cracking at abutment and/or <b>connector</b> <b>area</b> and chipping, whereas Y-TZP presented predominantly cohesive failure within veneering porcelain. Including all failure modes, the reliability (two-sided at 90 % confidence intervals) for a ""mission"" of 50, 000 and 100, 000 cycles at 300 N load was determined (Alta Pro, Reliasoft, Tucson, AZ, USA). No difference in reliability was observed between groups for a mission of 50, 000. Reliability remained unchanged for a mission of 100, 000 for PdAg, but significantly decreased for Y-TZP. Conclusions: Higher reliability was found for PdAg for a mission of 100, 000 cycles at 300 N. Failure modes differed between materials.

40|$|Statement of Problem: Mechanical {{failure of}} ceramic {{materials}} is controlled by brittle fracture, mostly occurred in tension. In 3 -unit all-ceramic FPDs the <b>connector</b> <b>area</b> {{is considered to be}} at fracture risk because of tensile stress concentrations. Purpose: The aim of this FE analysis was to evaluate the effect of taper on stress distribution in all-ceramic FPDs. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study two 3 -D finite element models of thee-unit IPS-Empress 2 FPDs replacing mandible second premolar were created by means of finite element software. The digital images were obtained from CT scan of human skull. Abutment was reduced with 12 and 22 degrees of taper. The cement layer,PDL, cancellous bone and cortical bone were also modeled. Frameworks of core material were fabricated. A static load of 100 N was applied at mid pontic area. Resolved stresses were calculated according to the Von Mises criterion and principal stresses. Results: In both models stresses were concentrated at the connectors. The maximum stresses were lower in the model with larger taper. The maximum Von Mises stress was recorded at the connector region of the premolar and the pontic. In model with larger taper the patterns of stresses were also more distributed and less concentrated. Conclusion: The highest Von Mises and principal stress were recorded at the connectors. Tensile stresses developed at the gingival connector of premolar and pontic was higher than molar. The stress level in model with 22 -degree taper was lower compare to 12 -degree and the stress pattern was more distributed, lowered the risk ofconcentrations...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the fracture load of different veneered PEEK 3 -unit fixed dental prosthesis (FDPs) after different aging regimens. METHODS Congruently anatomically shaped 3 -unit FDPs were milled using a master stl-data set and randomly divided into four groups (N[*]=[*] 120, n[*]=[*] 30 per veneering group), which were veneered using different veneering methods: (i) digital veneering with breCAM. HIPC, (ii) conventional veneering with crea. lign, (iii) conventional with crea. lign paste, and (iv) using pre-manufactured veneers visio. lign. The FDPs were then adhesively cemented on a metal abutment and fracture loads were measured in a universal testing machine (1 mm/min) before and after aging (10, 000 thermal cycles, 5 / 55 °C). Two- and one-way ANOVA followed by post hoc Scheffé tests were used for data analysis (p[*]<[*] 0. 05). RESULTS This investigation showed an influence of the veneering method on the fracture load results independent of the aging level. The highest fracture load was measured for the FDPs with digital veneering (1882 [*]±[*] 152 N at baseline, 2021 [*]±[*] 184 N after thermocycling). The remaining groups showed comparable results, and no impact of thermal aging was observed. Digital and conventional veneers showed cracks in the pontic region starting from the <b>connector</b> <b>area</b> as a main failure type after loading, while the pre-manufactured veneers showed predominantly adhesive failures. CONCLUSIONS The digital veneering method showed the highest fracture load resistance. Thermal aging showed no impact on the fracture load of all tested veneered PEEK 3 -unit FDPs.

40|$|Aim: To {{investigate}} {{and compare the}} fracture strength and fracture mode in eleven groups of currently, {{the most commonly used}} multilayer three-unit all-ceramic yttria-stabilized tetragonal zirconia polycrystal (Y-TZP) fixed dental prostheses (FDPs) with respect to the choice of core material, veneering material area, manufacturing technique, design of connectors, and radii of curvature of FDP cores. Materials and methods: A total of 110 three-unit Y-TZP FDP cores with one intermediate pontic were made. The FDP cores in groups 1 – 7 were made with a split-file design, veneered with manually built-up porcelain, computer-aided design-on veneers, and over-pressed veneers. Groups 8 – 11 consisted of FDPs with a state-of-the-art design, veneered with manually built-up porcelain. All the FDP cores were subjected to simulated aging and finally loaded to fracture. Results: There was a significant difference (P< 0. 05) between the core designs, but not between the different types of Y-TZP materials. The split-file designs with VITABLOCS® (1, 806 ± 165 N) and e. max® ZirPress (1, 854 ± 115 N) and the state-of-the-art design with VITA VM® 9 (1, 849 ± 150 N) demonstrated the highest mean fracture values. Conclusion: The shape of a split-file designed all-ceramic reconstruction calls for a different dimension protocol, compared to traditionally shaped ones, as the split-file design leads to sharp approximal indentations acting as fractural impressions, thus decreasing the overall strength. The design of a framework is a crucial factor for the load bearing capacity of an all-ceramic FDP. The state-of-the-art design is preferable since the split-file designed cores call for a cross-sectional <b>connector</b> <b>area</b> at least 42 % larger, to have the same load bearing capacity as the state-of-the-art designed cores. All veneering materials and techniques tested in the study, split-file, over-press, built-up porcelains, and glass–ceramics are, with a great safety margin, sufficient for clinical use both anteriorly and posteriorly. Analysis of the fracture pattern shows differences between the milled veneers and over-pressed or built-up veneers, where the milled ones show numerically more veneer cracks and the other groups only show complete connector fractures...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a novel approach}} to powering a radical type of microrobot. Our long-term aim is to enable the construction of ensembles of millions of coordinated nearspherical, submillimeter microrobots. Both {{the large number of}} potential simultaneous neighbors of each robot (12) and the difficulty of fine actuation at such small scales preclude the use of complex connectors previously developed in many modular robotics efforts. Instead, we propose to leverage multirobot cooperation to simplify the mechanics of modular robot docking. In our approach, the robots actively cooperate to route virtual power busses (both supply and ground) to all the robots in the ensemble using only unary (single conductor) electrical connectors between robots. A unary connector allows for larger tolerances in engagement angle, simplifies robot manufacture, speeds reconfiguration, and maximizes the proportion of the <b>connector</b> surface <b>area</b> useful for carrying current. The algorithms we present permit a robot ensemble to efficiently harvest and distribute power from sources discovered in the environment and/or carried by the ensemble. We evaluate these algorithms in a variety of simulated deployment conditions and report on the impact of hardware defects, limited on-board power storage, and the ensemble-environment interface...|$|R
40|$|STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Polymeric {{computer-aided}} design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) blocks exhibit various {{advantages in}} contrast to conventionally processed resin restorations. However, the influence of connector dimensions on resin fixed dental prostheses (FDPs) {{has not yet been}} investigated. PURPOSE: This study evaluated the impact of <b>connector</b> cross-sectional <b>area</b> (CSA) on the fracture load of 3 -unit CAD/CAM FDPs and compared this with conventionally fabricated ones. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Anatomically shaped 3 -unit FDPs with the CSAs of 6, 9, 12, and 16 mm(2) (N= 240, n= 15 per material and per CSA) were fabricated from the following CAD/CAM materials: artBloc Temp (AT), TelioCAD (TC), CAD-Temp (CT), and one conventional resin material, CronMix K (CMK) as the control group. The fracture load was tested and the data were analyzed with 2 -way ANOVA, 1 -way ANOVA, the Scheffé post hoc test, and Weibull statistics (α= 05). RESULTS: CMK showed the significant lowest values for all CSAs followed by CT, except for the 12 mm(2) connector (P<. 001). The CAD/CAM FDPs exhibited a significant increase in fracture load with the increase of CSA (P<. 001). Conventionally fabricated FDPs presented an increase of values up to the CSA of 12 mm(2). For TC, the shape increased with a larger CSA. The other materials exhibited no tendencies in this regard. Among the 12 mm(2) groups, AT exhibited the highest shape value (19. 1), and among the 16 mm(2) groups, TC showed the highest shape value (17. 0). The CMK FDPs with a CSA of 16 mm(2) showed almost half as high a shape parameter (6. 4) than the other three CSAs. CONCLUSIONS: CAD/CAM resin FDPs revealed significantly higher fracture load values than conventionally fabricated FDPs and showed a significant increase in fracture load with the increase of the CSA...|$|R
40|$|For {{the first}} time, octahydroxyl methylresorcinarene with four hexyl {{groups on the}} lower rim was {{utilized}} in the in-situ preparation of a silica-based sol-gel organic-inorganic hybrid coating for sample preconcentration by capillary microextraction (CME). Tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) was chosen as a sol gel precursor to create a cross-linked sol-gel network via acid-catalyzed hydrolytic polycondensation reactions. Sol-gel chemistry helped in the in situ preparation of resorcinarene-containing extraction phase {{in the form of}} a surface coating. It also provided an effective means to chemically bind the coating to the inner surface of fused silica capillary via condensation of the hydroxyl groups in the sol-gel network with the silanol groups on the fused silica capillary inner surface. These chemically bonded sol-gel coatings demonstrated excellent thermal stability (up to 350 oC). The sol-gel resorcinarene coatings successfully extracted traces of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), ketones, phenols, amines, and alcohols from aqueous samples providing parts per trillion level detection limits (0. 828 - 46. 01 ng/L) in GC using a Flame Ionization Detector (FID). CME was performed by passing the aqueous samples through the resorcinarene coated microextraction capillary (10 cm). The extracted analytes where then thermally desorbed into the GC column connected to the exit end of the sol-gel microextraction capillary via a press-fit quartz <b>connector.</b> Peak <b>area</b> relative standard deviation (RSD %), a measure of the extraction performance reproducibility for the coated capillary, was found in the range of (1. 1 % - 8. 3 %). The sol-gel resorcinarene sorbent was characterized by FTIR spectrum which indicated the presence of hydroxyl groups in the coating even after the sol-gel reactions were completed which explains the affinity of the resorcinarene sol-gel coating toward polar analytes. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images of the coating reveraled the porous morphology and thickness of 3. 5 - 4. 0 µm for the coating. The sol-gel resorcinarene coated capillary provided excellent extraction performance for wide range of analytes...|$|R
