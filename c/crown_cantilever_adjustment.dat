40|$|PURPOSE To {{describe}} the survival, clinical rating, and patient satisfaction of monolithic computer-aided design/computer-assisted manufacture (CAD/CAM) ceramic single unit <b>cantilever</b> <b>crowns</b> placed on hemisected molars and premolars after a follow-up {{of at least}} 12 months. MATERIALS AND METHODS Sixteen consecutive patients (mean age, 56. 8 years) with 16 restored two-unit <b>cantilever</b> <b>crowns</b> (5 premolars and 11 hemisected molar abutments) were reevaluated after an observation period of at least 12 months. Tooth mobility, plaque and bleeding scores, and pocket probing depths were assessed on both the restored and contralateral untreated teeth. Patient satisfaction was evaluated using a visual analog scale. RESULTS The mean observation time was 25. 7 ± 13. 1 months. All restorations were in situ, and no significant biologic differences were observed between the treated and contralateral teeth. Clinical evaluation showed good performance, and patient satisfaction was recorded as excellent. CONCLUSION The use of CAD/CAM ceramic single-unit <b>cantilever</b> <b>crowns</b> may {{be regarded as a}} conservative and cost-effective treatment modality with high patient acceptance in carefully selected patients...|$|R
40|$|The {{construction}} of double-curvature arch dams {{is an attractive}} solution from an economic viewpoint due to the reduced volume of concrete necessary for their construction as compared to conventional gravity dams. Due to their complex geometry, many criteria have arisen for their design. However, the most widespread methods are based on recommendations of traditional technical documents without {{taking into account the}} possibilities of computer-aided design. In this paper, an innovative software tool to design FEM models of double-curvature arch dams is presented. Several capabilities are allowed: simplified geometry creation (interesting for academic purposes), preliminary geometrical design, high-detailed model construction, and stochastic calculation performance (introducing uncertainty associated with material properties and other parameters). This paper specially focuses on geometrical issues describing the functionalities of the tool and the fundamentals of the design procedure with regard to the following aspects: topography, reference cylinder, excavation depth, <b>crown</b> <b>cantilever</b> thickness and curvature, horizontal arch curvature, excavation and concrete mass volume, and additional elements such as joints or spillways. Examples of application on two Spanish dams are presented and the results obtained analyzed...|$|R
40|$|The {{flexibility}} coefficient is popularly used {{to implement the}} macroevaluation of shape, safety, and economy for arch dam. However, the description of {{flexibility coefficient}} has not drawn a widely consensus all the time. Based on {{a large number of}} relative instance data, the relationship between influencing factor and flexibility coefficient is analyzed by means of partial least-squares regression. The partial least-squares regression equation of flexibility coefficient in certain height range between 30 [*]m and 70 [*]m is established. Regressive precision and equation stability are further investigated. The analytical model of statistical flexibility coefficient is provided. The flexibility coefficient criterion is determined preliminarily to evaluate the shape of low- and medium-sized arch dam. A case study is finally presented to illustrate the potential engineering application. According to the analysis result of partial least-squares regression, it is shown that there is strong relationship between flexibility coefficient and average thickness of dam, thickness-height ratio of <b>crown</b> <b>cantilever,</b> arc height ratio, and dam height, but the effect of rise-span ratio is little relatively. The considered factors in the proposed model are more comprehensive, and the applied scope is clearer than that of the traditional calculation methods. It is more suitable for the analogy analysis in engineering design and the safety evaluation for arch dam...|$|R

This paper describes a simple chairside CAD/CAM method of fabricating a <b>cantilever</b> <b>crown</b> for a hemisected molar. The technique is illustrated by a clinical case, which was treated according to this protocol and was followed-up over 2. 5 years.

40|$|Aim The {{aim of this}} {{prospective}} comparative {{pilot study}} was to evaluate hard and soft peri-implant tissues in patients with a missing adjacent central and lateral upper incisor treated with either one implant and an implant <b>crown</b> with a <b>cantilever</b> or two implants with solitary implant crowns up to 1 year after functional loading. Material and methods In the "Implant-cantilever group", five patients were treated with one dental implant {{in the region of}} the central incisor (NobelReplace Groovy Regular Platform). In the "Implant-implant group", five patients were treated with two adjacent dental implants: at the position of the central incisor (NobelReplace Groovy Regular Platform) and at the position of the lateral incisor (NobelReplace Groovy Narrow Platform). Implant survival, pocket probing depth, papilla index, marginal bone level and patient satisfaction were assessed during a 1 -year follow-up period. Results No implants were lost during the 1 -year follow-up. Mean pocket probing values of the implants were comparable between the two groups. Papilla index scores in both groups were relatively low, pointing towards a compromised papilla. Marginal bone loss was minimal and comparable between the groups. Patient satisfaction was very high in both groups. Conclusion In this 1 -year prospective comparative study, no large differences in hard- and soft-tissue levels could be shown between patients with a missing central and lateral upper incisor treated with either one implant and an implant <b>crown</b> with a <b>cantilever</b> or two implants with solitary implant crowns.

40|$|The {{choice on}} which {{cantilever}} {{to use for}} Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) depends {{on the type of}} the experiment being done. Usually, the cantilevers have to be exchanged when a different stiffness is required and the entire alignment has to be repeated. In the present work, we have developed a method to adjust the stiffness of the AFM cantilever in situ, without having to exchange the <b>cantilever.</b> The <b>adjustment</b> is achieved by changing the effective length of the cantilever by electrostatic pull-in. By applying a voltage between the cantilever and an electrode (with an insulating layer at the point of contact), the cantilever snaps to the electrode, reducing the cantilever’s effective length. The working principle of this concept is demonstrated with a proof-of-concept experiment. The electrode was positioned close to a commercially available cantilever with a robotic nano-manipulator. To confirm the change in stiffness, the resonance frequency of the cantilever was measured for varying electrode positions. The results match the theoretical expectation. For the cantilever that was tested, we obtained stiffness tuning from 0. 2 N/m to 27 N/m, covering two orders of magnitude in one cantilever. This proof-of-concept is the first step towards a micro fabricated prototype, that integrates the electrode positioning system and cantilever {{that can be used for}} actual AFM experiments.

30|$|Optical {{read-out}} of {{all eight}} cantilevers is possible by mounting the laser assembly within an optical cage system (Thorlabs Ltd. Cambridgeshire, UK) on high precision automated translation stages (122.2 DD and M- 110.1 DG Precision Micro-Translation Stage; Physik Instrumente Ltd., Bedford, England). Aligning the stages to enable both x-axis and y-axis motion allows movement between <b>cantilevers,</b> and also <b>adjustment</b> to an optimum location along each cantilever. Particularly within dynamic mode operation, optimal amplitude signals {{can be obtained}} by individually positioning the laser on each cantilever separately, as this can compensate for subtle mechanical differences between the cantilevers. For the dynamic mode operation the laser has to be positioned and focussed on a flex point of the cantilever. For example, the node-to-node distance for the 16 th flexural resonance mode is ~ 33  μm, hence the angle sensitive region is approximately 11  μm long. The y-axis and x-axis miniature translation stages feature an optical linear encoder with 100  nm and 50  nm position resolution and a velocity of 20  mm/s and 1  mm/s respectively.|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} investigation {{aimed to}} {{the evaluation of}} the state of damage of historic brick masonry structure, referred to as The Bellevue Tower, is presented. The tower was built {{at the beginning of the}} 16 th century as part of the Ferrero Palace-Masserano-La Marmora, on the highest part of Biella, in the Italian region of Piedmont, and became the city landmark. The tower has a square plan for the first three lower floors from the ground level and an octagonal plan for the remaining four floors, ending with a stone-decorated <b>cantilevered</b> <b>crowning.</b> The tower was a part of a public Palace from which it was separated, in terms of property, at the beginning of the 20 th century. This separation altered the use and conservation path of the tower, that nowadays suffers from a severe state of damage and requires an immediate intervention and rehabilitation of the masonry structures and overhanging elements for safety reasons. A methodology is put forward for combining laboratory and non-destructive testing methods with a monitoring system in order to evaluate the potential for conservation of this historic tower and its sustainability, in view of an effective intervention design...|$|R
40|$|A {{simulation}} of an {{atomic force microscope}} operating in the constant amplitude dynamic mode is described. The implementation mimics the electronics of a real setup including a digital phase-locked loop (PLL). The PLL is not only used as a very sensitive frequency detector, but also to generate the time-dependent phase shifted signal driving the <b>cantilever.</b> The optimum <b>adjustments</b> of individual functional blocks and their joint performance in typical experiments are determined in detail. Prior to testing the complete setup, the performances of the numerical PLL and of the amplitude controller were ascertained to be satisfactory compared {{to those of the}} real components. Attention is also focused on the issue of apparent dissipation, that is, of spurious variations in the driving amplitude caused by the nonlinear interaction occurring between the tip and the surface and by the finite response times of the various controllers. To do so, an estimate of the minimum dissipated energy that is detectable by the instrument upon operating conditions is given. This allows us to discuss the relevance of apparent dissipation that can be conditionally generated with the simulator in comparison to values reported experimentally. The analysis emphasizes that apparent dissipation can contribute to the measured dissipation up to 15 % of the intrinsic dissipated energy of the cantilever interacting with the surface, but can be made negligible when properly adjusting the controllers, the PLL gains and the scan speed. It is inferred that the experimental values of dissipation usually reported in the literature cannot only originate in apparent dissipation, which favors the hypothesis of "physical" channels of dissipation...|$|R
40|$|To {{conduct a}} {{systematic}} review on the clinical outcome of single implant-supported two-unit cantilever FDP's and {{to conduct a}} 5 -year prospective comparative pilot study of patients with a missing central and lateral upper incisor treated with either a single implant-supported two-unit cantilever FDP or two implants with solitary implant crowns in the aesthetic zone. Medline, Embase and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched (last search 1 August 2016) for eligible studies. In the comparative pilot study, an implant-cantilever group of five patients with a single implant-supported two-unit cantilever FDP (NobelReplace Groovy Regular Platform) was compared with an implant-implant group of five patients with two adjacent single implant-supported crowns (NobelReplace Groovy Regular Platform) in the aesthetic zone. Implant survival, marginal bone level (MBL) changes, pocket probing depth, papilla index and patient satisfaction were assessed during a 5 -year follow-up period. Five of 276 articles were considered eligible for data extraction. Implant survival ranged from 966 % to 100 %. Marginal bone level changes {{were higher in the}} anterior region than in the posterior region. Technical complications occurred more often in the posterior than anterior region. In the 5 -year comparative pilot study, no clinically significant differences in hard and soft peri-implant tissue levels occurred between both groups.
