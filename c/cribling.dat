It follows that Sh(Q) is a Grothendieck topos whenever Q is a Grothendieck quantaloid. Any locale L is a Grothendieck quantale, and Sh(L) is the topos of sheaves on L. Any small quantaloid of closed <b>cribles</b> is a Grothendieck quantaloid, and if Q is the quantaloid of closed <b>cribles</b> in a Grothendieck site (C,J) then Sh(Q) is equivalent to the topos Sh(C,J).

40|$|Discourse markers (DMs) {{are usually}} broadly defined as {{structuring}} and organizing devices that help produce and understand meaning-in-context (e. g. Schiffrin 1987, Fischer 2000). The panel of functions {{that they can}} perform ranges from local cohesion (e. g. a causal relation between (sub) clauses) to “global coherence” (Lenk 1998, e. g. topic shift), hence a great variability in the size and type of units they apply to. The notion of scope of DMs has received some attention in grammaticalization studies (Traugott 1995) and more recently in studies on position and segmentation (Pons Bordería & Estelles 2009, Estelles & Pons Bordería 2014). However, scope remains a complex feature to annotate directly in spoken corpora, given the interplay of syntactic and semantic-pragmatic interpretation it involves. I claim that a scale of DM scope {{can be obtained by}} merging the information provided by a multi-layered annotation of formal and functional features of DMs, here applied to a comparable corpus of spoken French and English. These annotations include (but are not limited to) : function(s) of the DM; a three-fold positioning system (clause, dependency structure, turn-of-speech); co-occurrence patterns; disfluencies in the immediate co-text of the DM (silent/filled pauses, repetitions etc.). My proposal is that corpus-based annotations – coupled with metadata on the contextual settings (e. g. degree of preparation, number of speakers) – can be interpreted in terms of scopes and their relative cognitive load. I will focus on “sequential” DMs (Gonzalez 2005, <b>Crible</b> subm.), which form a functional subgroup attending to topic management and dialogue structure, viz. turn opening, turn closing, topic shifting, topic resuming, and listing (see <b>Crible</b> 2014 for operational definitions of these values), to examine the different ways in which they relate to co-text and context. According to Roberts & Krisner (2000), sequential DMs should theoretically be more complex to produce, given that they work on both the mental “linearization” (Levelt 1989) of the global order of segments (e. g. macro-structure of topics) and on the actual “linearity” of the articulated output (e. g. local transition between topics or turns). I will therefore look for local and contextual evidence for heavy cognitive load, viz. presence of disfluencies, number and function(s) of co-occurring DMs, formality and complexity of the situation (e. g. transmission of information, professional setting). My hypothesis is that sequential DMs should co-occur with more disfluencies (including other DMs) than DMs from other (ideational, interpersonal) groups. I also expect that those markers which are associated with heavy cognitive load take scope over larger units (several propositions, a whole turn). This corpus-based in-depth investigation of DMs in a variety of contexts should uncover patterns and clusters of features that provide indirect evidence for the scope of these structuring elements of discourse. This will in turn contribute to better define the notion of speech linearity, and bring us closer to a cognitive-pragmatic model of discourse structure, following the lines of Van Dijk (e. g. 1989), Degand & Simon (2009) or the Val.

Analysis of the clinical data {{showed a significant association}} with both hypertension and dementia. 1 Atat <b>crible</b> in vascular hypertension is suggested as the possible cause. We have noted during routine viewing of com-puted tomography (CT) scans that a small num-ber of patients with otherwise typical cerebral atrophy have abnormally low attenuation in the deep hemispheric white matter. The only refer-ence to such an association is by Pasquini et al,' who stated that periventricular reduced attenua-tion occurred in two (0 - 8 %) of their cases of cerebral atrophy; both these patients, however, showed radionuclide cisternographic evidence of communicating hydrocephalus. In our patients there were no features of communicating hydro-cephalus and the distribution and appearance of the white matter low attenuation (WMLA) is unlike that which occurs with hydrocephalus.

40|$|Cross-linguistic {{studies of}} {{discourse}} markers often face various methodological problems regarding {{the applicability of}} a single annotation protocol to very diverse data-driven sets of items from several languages. Ideally, such a protocol should overcome language-specific preferences and encompass all possible actualizations of discourse markers, in different contexts and speech situations. Given the great diversity of relations or functions that markers may perform, the list of possible values must be the largest possible, while remaining operational for the perspective of inter-coder agreement. Moreover, the criteria of what counts as a discourse marker must also be very explicit so that the onomasiological selection of items in context can be as stable and exhaustive as possible. We will present a proposal of a corpus-based annotation scheme (<b>Crible,</b> subm.) designed and tested on French and English spoken data across different speech situations (spontaneous and prepared, monologues and dialogues, etc.). This protocol was elaborated for both relational markers (or discourse connectives) and non-relational markers (other discourse markers such as you know or well). We will cover all the features that are accounted for in this annotation and which are mainly of two kinds: syntactic parameters on the one hand, such as a two-fold categorization {{of the position of}} the marker in the sentence; and functional features on the other. Position and relation are two parameters that were identified by Zufferey & Cartoni (2012) as “relevant criteria governing the choice of a causal connective” (2012 : 233), and it may be assumed that it is the case for other types of markers. The present system also includes a definition of the segments related by the marker, with a fairly large understanding of the unit it may apply to. The functional categories of this protocol are revised versions of previous taxonomies such as Sweetser's (1990) or Gonzalez’ (2005). Functions are grouped into four domains: ideational, rhetorical, sequential and interpersonal. This first selection restricts the possible functional value(s) to an operational and closed list of domain-specific functions, elaborated from previous literature (a. o. Prasad et al. 2008, Cuenca 2013, Zufferey & Degand 2014) and empirical testing. In example (1), the English conjunction but works simultaneously in the rhetorical and the sequential domains, performing both a relation of opposition between the two segments, and a text-structuring function of topic-shifting. (1) “So that was the way the decisions were made. But what we also wanted, and we’re very keen on this here, …” (bb_en 011) The efficiency and operationality of this annotation scheme will be assessed by an annotation experiment contrasting naive and expert coders (all native speakers of French) applying the present protocol to spoken conversations in English and French. Reports of inter-annotator agreement within and between groups will be illustrated and analyzed in order to investigate the source of disagreements, which we expect, at least for expert coders, to be linked to speech-specific and/or highly polysemous, under-specified uses of discourse markers, on the basis of previous studies (e. g. <b>Crible</b> & Zufferey 2015). This annotation experiment will also be an opportunity to explore patterns of combination between the different variables involved, and to raise more general issues regarding the annotation of the complex phenomenon of discourse markers in natural data...|$|R

The special technique of cursive used to produce classical texts in manuscripts was called Humanist Hand. This unique form of type letter is now known for as Italic or Aldine. Also considered, both a printer and engraver, Pigouchet appears to have introduced the <b>criblé</b> technique, in which the black areas of a woodblock are punched with white dots, giving the page a lively tonality. Beside the Horae, Pigouchet also printed the only known {{copy of the book}} of Hours for Sarum at Paris in 1494 for the Rouen bookseller Jean Richard. This is the earliest edition of the Hours printed outside the United Kingdom that survives in more than a few fragments, and is possibly the earliest French-printed edition on record.Philipee Pigouchet's collaboration with Simon Vostre lasted for over 18 years, during which period the duo produced hundreds of Books of Hours for European readers. Their contribution immensely to the publishing of Book of Hours, a profession that, according to Sandra Hindman, brought out over 1,775 editions of Books of Hours between 1475 and 1600. Some works by Pigouchet and Vostre survive today. There are six bound copies in the possession of Princeton University.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the data and}} method of a crosslinguistic and variationist approach to discourse markers (DMs) in speech. DMs are here broadly defined as “fulfilling structuring functions with respect to local and global content and structure of discourse” (Fischer, 2000 : 20). In order to reach full coverage of this category and following corpus-based definitions (<b>Crible,</b> 2014), manual annotation of numerous functional and surface features was performed upon a comparable corpus of native French and English, balanced across eight contextual settings (e. g. conversation, interview) with over seven hours of speech in each language and about 160. 000 words in total. Linguistic variation (language, register, modality) and the heterogeneity of the DM class were accounted for in a robust annotation scheme designed through careful corpus-based testing. The presentation {{will focus on the}} elaboration of a functional taxonomy which builds on existing categorizations (Halliday & Hasan, 1976; Sweetser, 1990) and definitions (Gonzalez, 2005; Prasad et al., 2008). The novelty of the present proposal lies in the integration and extension of traditional writing-based sets of discourse relations to additional (non-) relational functions, and in the revision of certain values to better grasp the specificity of the spoken mode. After operationalization, the taxonomy comprises thirty functions grouped in four domains: - ideational (semantic relations); - rhetorical (pragmatic relations and speaker’s attitude), - sequential (topic structure and interaction management) - interpersonal (hearer-orientation). These domains partially take up well-established distinctions in the literature on DMs and other pragmatic phenomena: semantic vs. pragmatic source of coherence (Sanders, 1997), the objective-subjective-intersubjective continuum (Traugott, 2007), and the scale of relationality of DMs (Degand & Simon-Vandenbergen, 2011). The resulting dataset DisFrEn, with over 8000 DM tokens identified and annotated, offers many valuable insights into the interface between form and function of discourse markers. The analytical potential of the present categorical and corpus-based approach to DMs will be briefly illustrated by overall distribution results focusing on the functional variables. Our data shows that in both languages and most situations, the sequential domain is the most frequent, with a few exceptions due to the impact of context: more rhetorical (subjective) relations in classroom lessons (cf. transmission of information through epistemic relations) and more ideational (objective) relations in political speeches, where DMs are mostly used to highlight content-based connections. As far as position is concerned, the sequential and interpersonal domains are almost exclusively found in non-governed positions (outside the syntactic boundaries of the dependency structure, either left or right periphery), while the ideational and rhetorical domains show non negligeable frequencies in more integrated slots, which is expected from their connective status. Finally, a further window into the cognitive processes of online speech production is provided by the annotation of various local marks of (dis) fluency (e. g. pauses, repetitions, false-starts) in the direct co-text of DMs. Hence, DMs in DisFrEn are studied for their contribution to the relative (dis) fluency of their utterance, through a combination of functional and surface features that should cluster in relevant patterns for the cognitive-pragmatic modelling of this complex category.

Although the pathophysiology of SVD is poorly understood, {{there is evidence of}} a genetic contribution. We sought to analyze the influence of the reninangiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) on SVD in symptomatic patients from the Génétique de l'Infarctus Cérébral (GENIC) study, including RAAS polymorphisms and circulating angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). Methods: Caucasian patients (n = 510) with acute brain infarction (BI) were recruited and MRIs were evaluated for SVD, including LA, EC, and MLI. We considered ACE levels and several polymorphisms, including ACE, angiotensinogen, aldosterone synthase CYP 11 B 2, and angiotensin II receptor type I. Results: Among the polymorphisms, there were marginal negative associations between aldosterone synthase CYP 11 B 2 - 344 C against severe EC (adjusted OR, 0. 57; 95 % CI, 0. 31 - 1. 05) and severe LA (adjusted OR, 0. 54; 95 % CI, 0. 30 - 0. 95), both considering - 344 C dominant. In addition, the frequency of - 344 C decreased with the number of SVD abnormalities (p = 0. 016). Mean plasma ACE was elevated in patients with MLI, but not with LA or EC. The risk of MLI increased gradually with increasing plasma ACE (adjusted OR, 1. 25; 95 % CI, 1. 02 - 1. 53). Conclusions: This exploratory study found no strong evidence for RAAS involvement in severe SVD in this population. The whole spectrum of SVD, including EC, MLI, and LA, can be considered as phenotypes for genetic studies. © 2008 Springer...|$|R

The paper begins with a set of principles to support responsible research. Then, the paper outlines possible actions by different stakeholders to help business schools and scholars that wish to realize this vision. The paper further explains the impetus for the proposal by describing the current business research ecosystem and associated problems, drawing on published work and a Delphi survey of scholars who have written about different aspects of the current research challenges. The major challenge of the current research ecosystem is that the priority of publishing in top tier journals over-shadows considerations of both research quality and societal relevance. The paper ends with a discussion of the “do nothing” option that perpetuates the status quo, and a call to action for directing research toward achieving humanity's highest aspirations. The paper invites discussion and debate on the possibility and necessity of creating a “responsible research” ecosystem so that business and management research can become a force of change for a better world. This White Paper starts us on a journey toward a substantive rethinking of business and management research and, more broadly, about its evolving roles and expectations in society. Our audience goes beyond the higher education community, and we invite broad participation in this discussion. While scholars, editors, university presidents, deans, professional associations, accrediting, funding agencies and the public (through the media) have faulted elements of the current business research ecosystem, Vision 2030 portrays a promising future and advocates principles that underpin its ultimate success...|$|R

En effet, dans leur environnement naturel, les micro-organismes sont attachés à une surface, organisés en communautés structurées, et englobés dans une matrice d’exopolysaccharide. Ce mode de développement, appelé biofilm, a pris une importance toute particulière lorsqu’il a été établi qu’il était impliqué dans un grand nombre d’infections bactériennes. Pseudomonas aeruginosa est un pathogène opportuniste responsable d’infections nosocomiales et d’infections irréversibles et mortelles chez les malades souffrant de mucoviscidose. Cet organisme s’installe dans les tissus sous forme de biofilm, mais est également capable d’adhérer à des surfaces inertes. Le développement de <b>cribles</b> génétiques et le séquençage du génome de P. aeruginosa ont permis d’obtenir de nombreuses informations {{permettant de}} mieux comprendre ce phénomène au niveau moléculaire. Bacterial attachment on various surfaces mostly {{takes place in}} the form of specialised bacterial communities, referred to as biofilm. The biofilm is formed through series of interactions between cells and adherence to surface, resulting in an organised structure. In this review we have been using Pseudomonas aeruginosa as a model microorganism to describe the series of events that occurred during this developmental process. P. aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that has a wide variety of hosts and infectious sites. In addition to biofilm formation in certain tissues, inert surfaces, such as catheters, are also target for bacterial biofilm development. The use of convenient genetic screens has made possible the identification of numerous biofilm-defective mutants, which have been characterised further. These studies have allowed the proposal for a global model, in which key events are described for the different stages of biofilm formation. Briefly, flagellar mobility is crucial for approaching the surface, whereas type IV pili motility is preponderant for surface colonisation and microcolonies formation. These microcolonies are finally packed together and buried in an exopolysaccharide matrix to form the differentiated biofilm. It is obvious that the different stages of biofilm formation also involved perception of environmental stimuli. These stimuli, and their associated complex regulatory networks, have still to be fully characterised to understand the bacterial strategy, which initiates biofilm formation. One such regulatory system, called Quorum sensing, {{is one of the key}} player in the initial differentiation of biofilm. Finally, a better understanding, at the molecular level, of biofilm establishment and persistence should help for the design of antimicrobials that prevent bacterial infections...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} report {{deals with the}} subjects of the extension of foreign investments into emerging countries. the particularity nowaday is the internationalisation of strategic activity such as R&D. Many inquiries can be rise since, multinational technology activities are not anymore limited to simple adaptation activity. Emerging countries like China are emplementing their own technology trajectories, so as to attract more and more foreign R&D. This {{has to do with}} a change in the behavior of the foreign multinational because the conventional model not only cannot predict the internationalisation of R&D into emerging countries, but even when it does so, it assumes that the suitable technology activies into emerging countries are those limited to adapt home technology. I explain foreign multinational behavior by extending HEWITT (1981) model of internationalisation of R&D. I found that most of the R&D going to emerging countries is for development and adaptation. But the question still remains to know why some multinationals are extending their innovative activities into emerging countries and create regional innovation hubs (choosing one country to play the role of main regional innovation hub). I assume that multinational are both technology exploiting and technology explorer, their motivation are more than sharing their technology with emerging countries, but they aim at exploring technology opportunities in other for them to differentiate and innovate and stay a breath of what the competition is doing. In this part the research all the statistics and indicators show that China is playing the leading role with a technology trajectory above those of the three others countries. This seems to explain why China instead of India is the most attractive destination of foreign investment in production and in R&D. Le travail porte sur une nouvelle vision de l’analyse de l’internationalisation de la R&D dans les pays émergents. Nous redéfinissons les liens entre R&D et innovation ou R&D et technologie en mettant de l’avant le postulat que la technologie issue de l’activité de R&D est un facteur de production. Par la suite, la théorie de l’internationalisation est passée aux <b>cribles,</b> afin de trouver des réponses sur l’absence de prédiction de l’internationalisation de la R&D. Notre modèle du comportement de la multinationale est par la suite développé pour montrer comment les avantages O et I seuls suffisent à motiver la décision de la multinationale à internationaliser la R&D dans tout pays. La particularité de l’internationalisation dans les pays émergents est aussi ressortie avec l’absence de complémentarité qui apparaît lors de l’analyse empirique entre l’internationalisation de la R&D et celle des activités productives dans le cas de ces pays. Enfin, nous appliquons le modèle de croissance logistique dans le but de décrire la trajectoire technologique de la Chine et projeter son impact probable sur les unités de R&D des FMNs qui sont de nature exploratoire...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis of}} {{doctorate}} {{is about the}} communication in the urban projects. She is found on the international diffusion of the project logic as norm to make and to arrange the city. Diffusion that drive us to examine the communicational practice that the project allow. The norm project, today shared, does it imply some similarity in terms of communication? In a multipartenarial context, how does he organize the meeting apparatus? Until what point does to make the city imply him {{the involvement of the}} inhabitants? What are the issues of the communication that go with project? Two fields have been mobilized in a comparative perspective; the urban shutter of the Contract Getting out of Debt Contract Development (C 2 D) of Douala and the Big Urban Project (GPU) of Lille. 33 interviews, non participant observation, working papers and a significant corpus of press served to support a conceptual armature resting on the notions of apparatus and communication activity. The main results show a strong salience of communicational dissimilarity in the studied projects. These differences must be put in perspective with specific institutional contexts. Indeed, the communication in the C 2 D of Douala is minimal, implemented by internal actors to the Urban Community of Douala, but external to the team of project. In the case of the GPU, the implementation of the communication leans on outside operators to the project team, although the communicational activity is drived by the members of the aforesaid team. The place of the inhabitants deal to see a minimal involvement of the Douala casa whereas. In the Big Urban Project of Lille, we see an active continuum of the simple consultation to the coproduction of some facilities. Finally the accompaniment communication includes a strongsymbolic dimension in Lille whereas in Douala, it limits herself to evenementialisation who deserve of the Government Delegate close to the Douala Urban City Council. Le présent projet s'applique à problématiser la question des dispositifs par lesquels les politiques d'urbanisation voient le jour en France et dans les pays d'Afrique francophone. cette porte d'entrée permet d'aborder la production des politiques publiques dans les différents acteurs qui interagissent, mais également pose la question de la participation du citoyen dans un contexte marqué par la montée en généralité de l'impératif délibératif au mitan duquel les politiques publiques se légitiment aujourd'hui. en filigrane de ce questionnements, les mécanismes des différents dispositifs sont passés au <b>cribles</b> de la comparaison,à savoir; l'écologie des acteurs, les forces en présence et les fluctuations auxquelles elles sont soumises dans le déroulé de l'action,les médiations que produisent ces politiques ainsi que celles qui fluidifient les dispositifs énonciatifs,et les lieux à travers objets et interactions prennent place...|$|R
40|$|Some authors (e. g. Hansen 2006) {{claim that}} Discourse Markers (DMs) {{function}} as cues to situate upcoming speech into the listener’s mental representation of ongoing discourse, either by signaling a semantic {{relation between the}} connected units (Ex. 1), by planning and structuring discourse (Ex. 2), or by managing the interactional and intersubjective dimension of communication (Ex. 3). In this perspective, DMs {{can be seen as}} “lexical markers of common ground” (Fetzer & Fischer 2007), since they form explicit contextualization cues which instruct the listener on how to retrieve and re-construct speaker-intended meaning. In particular, their procedural meaning of “inference facilitators” creates a bridge between an utterance and its cognitive context (Gonzalez 2005). (1) “on ne sait pas faire ce qu’on veut / donc on doit / on doit s’adapter” we can’t do what we want / so we have to / we have to adapt (VALIBEL; Corpage corpus; 2012; spk: ageNM 1) (2) “je vais commencer par ma première question // euh // ben / d’après…” I will start with my first question // uh // well / according to… (VALIBEL; Corpage corpus; 2012; spk: ageFB 0) (3) “ce n’était pas le / le / le grand bonheur si tu veux” it wasn’t the / the / the happiest time if you will (VALIBEL; Corpage corpus; 2012; spk: ageNM 1) Our corpus-based study reports the methods and results of two joint endeavours related to the parameter and functional description of DMs in spoken French (corpora: CLAPI, CorpAGEst, VALIBEL). The first research project (MDMA Working Group, see Bolly et al. 2014) aimed at reaching feature-based criteria for the identification of DMs by disambiguating the uses of DM candidates, through cotextual and surface features mainly (e. g. position, co-occurrence) as well as some contextual interpretation (e. g. procedural vs. conceptual meaning). The second research focuses on the functional annotation of DMs based on operational categories validated over languages and modalities (see <b>Crible</b> & Bolly (submitted)). Here, context is extended to situational considerations, including in-depth pragmatic interpretation and multimodal features (prosody, gestures). In both projects, emphasis is put on the constant relation between a DM occurrence and its co(n) text, be it to identify the relevant factors that help classify an item as discursive or non-discursive, or to select the appropriate function the DM is performing in its particular utterance, among the range of “meaning potentials” (Aijmer 2013) it can convey. We will first show that, despite the great grammatical diversity of the DM class, recurrent patterns of features can be revealed through multivariate analysis of several parameters annotated by four different coders. These results confirm that the distinction between DMs and their non-discursive forms is motivated by syntactic (position, mobility) and semantic (procedurality, prototypical meaning) criteria. Secondly, the functional annotation applied to these “confirmed” DMs reveals in its turn how DMs relate to their (extra) linguistic context by signaling a number of discourse relations and/or structural, metadiscursive and interpersonal functions. We claim that our revised taxonomy of DM functions allows for an operational annotation of pragmatic features, thus providing a suitable model to account for the different domains covered by DMs in speech. To sum up, our contribution will provide a comprehensive view on the role of DMs as key signals of the interactive process of co-building interpretation, by highlighting the constant back-and-forth between utterance and context...|$|R
40|$|Repetition was {{described}} in the nineties by {{a limited number of}} sign linguists: Vermeerbergen & De Vriendt (1994) looked at a small corpus of VGT data, Fisher & Janis (1990) analysed “verb sandwiches” in ASL and Pinsonneault (1994) “verb echos” in Quebec Sign Language. More recently the same phenomenon {{has been the focus of}} research in a growing number of signed languages, including American (Nunes and de Quadros 2008), Hong Kong (Sze 2008), Russian (Shamaro 2008), Polish (Flilipczak and Mostowski 2013), Jamaican (Cumberbatch 2013), Italian (Branchini & al. 2013), and French Sign Language (Risler 2014) and Sign Language of the Netherlands (Crasborn 2009). Other studies have investigated “reduplication” in ASL (Wilbur 2009), in Swedish (Börstell 2011) or in German Sign Language (Pfau & Steinbach 2006). Among the numerous works on repetition in spoken languages see Tannen (2007), Betz (2008), Hurch (2008) and Dovicchi (2011). Examples of cross-linguistic analyses of sign languages are Šarac et al. (2007) and Kimmelman (2014). However, to our knowledge, within sign linguistics, the phenomenon has not been studied from both a cross-genre and cross-linguistic perspective. Therefore, we decided to analyze corpus data from different text genres and from two sign languages: LSFB and VGT. We first had to build an annotation protocol going back and forth between the literature and our own cross-linguistic data to analyse the use of repetitions from the more local realizations (at phrase and clause levels) to the broader ones (at discourse level). On the poster, this protocol will be explained in detail. We established a typology of two formal categories: - Contiguous repetition (XX) : both Xs are (near-) contiguous (possibility of the insertion of a pause or a palm-up sign); - Non-Contiguous repetition (XYXZ or X ABC X DEF X GHI…) : the repeated components are separated by at least one sign. Moreover, within the second category, we identified framing repetitions (XYX), i. e. the repeated components act as symmetrical “braces” around a central element made up of one sign to one or several clauses so that the repeated component closes the chunk the first one had begun. We considered as a structure of repetition a sign and its repeated occurrences which are part of the same signing turn. We used a system of codes, brackets and numbers to annotate the repetition structures on a unique tier in ELAN (based on <b>Crible,</b> Dumont, Grosman & Notarrigo 2015). This system allows extracting in Excel a visual layout of the arrangement of all repetition structures across a turn. We added a part of speech annotation on a first child tier (based on Johnston & Ferrara 2012), and we tagged the functions of repetition structures on a second child tier. We established a typology of functions according to linguistic domains (grammar, semantics and pragmatics). Using this annotation protocol and the corpora recently collected for LSFB and VGT, we are now in the process of carrying out detailed analyses on narratives and conversations in both languages. This work is part of a broader project on (dis) fluency (Notarrigo, forthcoming). References: Blondel, Marion & David Le Gac. 2007. Entre parenthèses… Y a-t-il une intonation en LSF?
