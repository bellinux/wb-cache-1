5000|$|<b>Crash</b> <b>axe</b> A short {{lightweight}} handheld emergency chopping tool {{with a sharp}} or serrated blade spanning {{a quarter}} circular from the axis of the handle, sometimes with a notch in the blade to catch on sheet metal, and often a short pick opposite the blade, this tool or a prybar is required to be carried in most large aircraft cockpits with 20 seats or more to quickly chop and pry walls and cabinets to gain access when extinguishing a fire while in flight or to escape when exits are unavailable. A <b>crash</b> <b>axe</b> is sometimes also used by crash rescue firefighter crews to chop through the airplane's sheet metal skin for a rescue opening; modern crash axes are often made with an electrically insulated handle.|$|E
60|$|He was gone. The {{heavy door}} <b>crashed</b> to: the <b>axe</b> had fallen--the pang was experienced.|$|R
60|$|The <b>axes</b> <b>crashed</b> {{through the}} as yet {{unprotected}} door. A blaze {{of light from}} within poured through the smashed panels. The door fell, and the raiders sprang {{into the room with}} their guns handy.|$|R
60|$|They {{also knew}} where he slept, having been given by the boy himself a {{description}} of his home, and with the first <b>crash</b> of Jerry's <b>axe</b> as he burst {{in the door of}} the shed, the men set up a shout which sounded like music in 'Lish's ears.|$|R
6000|$|And there, nigh to the door, pale of {{face and}} {{beautiful}} to see, golden Eric clove his way, {{and with him}} went black Skallagrim. Terrible was the flare of Whitefire as he flicked aloft like the levin in the cloud. Terrible was the flare of Whitefire; but more terrible was the light of Eric's eyes, for they seemed to flame in his head, and wherever that fire fell it lighted men the way to death. Whitefire sung and flickered, and <b>crashed</b> the <b>axe</b> of Skallagrim, and still through the press of war they won their way. Now Gizur stands before them, spear aloft, and Whitefire leaps up to meet him. Lo! he turns and flies. The coward son of Ospakar does not seek the fate of Ospakar! ...|$|R
60|$|After this {{discharge}} of spears which was kept {{up for some}} time, they rushed at us and there followed a great fight. The Zulus, throwing down their guns, rose {{to their feet and}} holding their little fighting shields which had been carried in their mats, in the left hand, wielded their axes with the right. Umslopogaas, who stood in the centre of them, however, had no shield and swung his great axe with both arms. This {{was the first time that}} I had seen him fight and the spectacle was in a way magnificent. Again and again the <b>axe</b> <b>crashed</b> down and every time it fell it left one dead beneath the stroke, till at length those Amahagger shrank back out of his reach.|$|R
60|$|Up {{rushed the}} assailants, one, two, three at a time, and {{as fast as}} they came, the <b>axe</b> <b>crashed</b> and the sword swung, and down they rolled again, dead or dying. And ever as the fight thickened, the old Zulu's eye seemed to get quicker and his arm stronger. He shouted out his war-cries and the names of chiefs whom he had slain, and the blows of his awful axe rained {{straight}} and true, shearing through everything they fell on. There was none of the scientific method he was so fond of about this last immortal fight of his; he had no time for it, but struck with his full strength, and at every stroke a man sank in his tracks, and went rattling down the marble steps.|$|R
60|$|It the {{two sons}} {{of one of}} these men, of whom mention has been made, were furious in their zeal before, they had now the wrath and vigour of lions. Calling to the man within each cell, to keep as far back as he could, lest the <b>axes</b> <b>crashing</b> through the door should wound him, a party went to work upon each one, to beat it in by sheer strength, and force the bolts and staples from their hold. But {{although}} these two lads had the weakest party, and the worst armed, and did not begin until after the others, having stopped to whisper to him through the grate, that door was the first open, and that man was the first out. As they dragged him into the gallery to knock off his irons, he fell down among them, a mere heap of chains, and was carried out in that state on men's shoulders, with no sign of life.|$|R
60|$|So {{he turned}} {{one point of}} the island, and this brought him in view of a second; and there he remembered the wizard trees to have been growing by the score {{together}} in a wood. From this point there went up a hubbub of men crying not to be described; and {{by the sound of}} them, those that he ran with shaped their course for the same quarter. A little nearer, and there began to mingle with the outcry the <b>crash</b> of many <b>axes.</b> And at this a thought came at last into his mind that the high chief had consented; that the men of the tribe had set-to cutting down these trees; that word had gone about the isle from sorcerer to sorcerer, and these were all now assembling to defend their trees. Desire of strange things swept him on. He posted with the voices, crossed the beach, and came into the borders of the wood, and stood astonished. One tree had fallen, others were part hewed away. There was the tribe clustered. They were back to back, and bodies lay, and blood flowed among their feet. The hue of fear was on all their faces: their voices went up to heaven shrill as a weasel's cry.|$|R
5000|$|... 1993 was a {{historic}} {{year for the}} programme, and ironically, this occurred due to low ratings. The soap had been threatened with being axed after nearly 21 years on air, so producers decided to air storylines they felt would boost ratings. One of these was Zoe Tate (Leah Bracknell) coming out as a lesbian (a first on British pre-watershed TV) and another was the wedding of Annie and Leonard, which aired in October 1993. This storyline heralded a new era for the programme, but ratings were not as successful as originally believed. In October 1993, the show had turned 21 {{and a couple of}} months later celebrated by airing a story which would mark a turning point in its history. On 30th December 1993 Emmerdale attracted its highest ever audience of over 18 million when a plane crashed into the village, killing four villagers. This led to the villagers deciding to have the village name changed from Beckindale to Emmerdale to help get over the plane <b>crash.</b> Leonard was <b>axed</b> by producers as they felt that the character had naturally reached an end, and it would allow for more scenes involving Mercier who was forced {{to come to terms with}} the death of a second husband after only a short period of marriage.|$|R
60|$|At the Pelly one morning, as {{they were}} {{harnessing}} up, Dolly, {{who had never been}} conspicuous for anything, went suddenly mad. She announced her condition by a long, heartbreaking wolf howl that sent every dog bristling with fear, then sprang straight for Buck. He had never seen a dog go mad, nor did he have any reason to fear madness; yet he knew that here was horror, and fled away from it in a panic. Straight away he raced, with Dolly, panting and frothing, one leap behind; nor could she gain on him, so great was his terror, nor could he leave her, so great was her madness. He plunged through the wooded breast of the island, flew down to the lower end, crossed a back channel filled with rough ice to another island, gained a third island, curved back to the main river, and in desperation started to cross it. And all the time, though he did not look, he could hear her snarling just one leap behind. Francois called to him {{a quarter of a mile}} away and he doubled back, still one leap ahead, gasping painfully for air and putting all his faith in that Francois would save him. The dog-driver held the axe poised in his hand, and as Buck shot past him the <b>axe</b> <b>crashed</b> down upon mad Dolly's head.|$|R
6000|$|This morning all {{my fears}} were fled, {{and all the}} trouble had fallen to the lot of Peni himself, who {{deserved}} it; my field was full of weeders; and I am again able to justify the ways of God. All morning I worked at the South Seas, and finished the chapter I had stuck upon on Saturday. Fanny, awfully hove-to with rheumatics and injuries received upon the field of sport and glory, chasing pigs, was unable {{to go up and}} down stairs, so she sat upon the back verandah, and my work was chequered by her cries. [...] "Paul, you take a spade to do that--dig a hole first. If you do that, you'll cut your foot off! Here, you boy, what you do there? You no get work? You go find Simelé; he give you work. Peni, you tell this boy he go find Simelé; suppose Simelé no give him work, you tell him go 'way. I no want him here. That boy no good."--Peni (from the distance in reassuring tones), [...] "All right, sir!"--Fanny (after a long pause), [...] "Peni, you tell that boy go find Simelé! I no want him stand here all day. I no pay that boy. I see him all day. He no do nothing."--Luncheon, beef, soda-scones, fried bananas, pine-apple in claret, coffee. Try to write a poem; no go. Play the flageolet. Then sneakingly off to farmering and pioneering. Four gangs at work on our place; a lively scene; <b>axes</b> <b>crashing</b> and smoke blowing; all the knives are out. But I rob the garden party of one without a stock, and you should see my hand--cut to ribbons. Now I want to do my path up the Vaituliga single-handed, and I want it to burst on the public complete. Hence, with devilish ingenuity, I begin it at different places; so that if you stumble on one section, you may not even then suspect the fulness of my labours. Accordingly, I started in a new place, below the wire, and hoping to work up to it. It was perhaps lucky I had so bad a cutlass, and my smarting hand bid me stay before I had got up to the wire, but just in season, so that I was only the better of my activity, not dead beat as yesterday.|$|R
