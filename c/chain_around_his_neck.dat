25|$|Shortly after Jefferson had died, attendants found a gold locket on a <b>chain</b> <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck,</b> {{where it}} had rested for more than forty years, {{containing}} a small faded blue ribbon which tied a lock of his wife Martha's brown hair.|$|E
25|$|Pamela Clark {{regularly}} exercised at the Miramar Road {{health club}} before noon, and {{a swimming pool}} attendance log placed Prince {{in the vicinity of}} Holly Tarr. Prince struck when he knew his victims would be showering and thus be less attentive to their surroundings. He later bragged about the killings to a friend and took to wearing the dead woman’s wedding ring on a <b>chain</b> <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck.</b> He gave another ring to his girlfriend as a Christmas present after taking it from Tarr.|$|E
25|$|The {{best known}} {{expedition}} {{was that of}} Tore Hund (Tore Dog) who together with some friends, arrived in Bjarmaland in 1026. They started to trade with the inhabitants and bought a great many pelts, whereupon they pretended to leave. Later, they made shore in secret, and plundered the burial site, where the Bjarmians had erected an idol of their god Jomali. This god had a bowl containing silver on his knees, and a valuable <b>chain</b> <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck.</b> Tore and his men managed {{to escape from the}} pursuing Bjarmians with their rich booty.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1970s and early 1980s, DiNome started {{adopting}} a wardrobe {{that consisted of}} New York City Police Department-style shirts, gold <b>chains</b> <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck</b> and a dungaree jacket. While attaching a silencer to a loaded automatic handgun {{in preparation for the}} murder of business associate Khaled Fahd Darwish Daoud, he accidentally shot himself in the hand.|$|R
50|$|Liver-Lips McGrowl-Liver Lips {{was perhaps}} the funniest-looking bear. He was a brown bear who got his name from his very large lips. He became an Elvis impersonator in this show, wearing an Elvis-style Santa suit with gold <b>chains</b> <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck</b> and wears a fancy ring. In this show, he played a Christmas tree-shaped {{electric}} guitar and was voiced by Imagineer Dave Durham.|$|R
50|$|In {{many parts}} of Croatia, Krampus is {{described}} as a devil wearing a cloth sack <b>around</b> <b>his</b> waist and <b>chains</b> <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck,</b> ankles, and wrists. As a part of a tradition, when a child receives a gift from St. Nicholas he is given a golden branch to represent his good deeds throughout the year; however, if the child has misbehaved, Krampus will take the gifts for himself and leave only a silver branch to represent the child's bad acts.|$|R
25|$|Despite his sacking Taylor {{remained}} {{friendly with}} the band and he {{asked if he could}} come to Paris too. He dressed up for the sound check in his trademark black leather stage gear, and added a <b>chain</b> <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck</b> with a Joan of Arc medallion, which he had bought on arrival at Calais. One version of the story says he gave such an extraordinary performance at the sound check, that the organizers decided to put Taylor {{at the top of the}} bill for both shows. As a result of his performance at those two shows, Eddie Barclay signed him to a six-year record deal on the Barclay label.|$|E
25|$|Marlo, Chris and Snoop visit Michael at home. Marlo {{questions}} {{him about}} the ring he is wearing on a <b>chain</b> <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck</b> and Michael reports that he took it from someone. Marlo is shocked, as the ring, which he initially took from Old Face Andre {{as part of a}} punishment for his stash house being robbed by Omar, had been stolen from Marlo by Omar several weeks ago in the poker game robbery, and then by Officer Walker from Omar when he was falsely arrested for murder, and then by Michael from Walker when the schoolboys ambushed him and covered him with yellow paint in an alley. Michael offers to give him the ring, unaware of its past, but Marlo allows him to keep it. Dukie descends and offers to ready Bug for school. Marlo tells Michael that he is putting him in charge of Bodie's corner and that he has another task for him. Snoop asks Michael who they killed for him and he reveals that it was Bug's father.|$|E
25|$|Three Israeli commandos were {{captured}}. The first captured soldier, {{the commanding}} officer of the assault team, was abseiling from the helicopter when he was attacked by ten men before his feet hit the deck. He was beaten across his body and head, then picked up and thrown to the lower deck, where he was attacked by a dozen activists. They beat and choked him, removed his bulletproof vest and sidearm and smashed his helmet, and shoved him into a passenger hall below deck. The second soldier {{was surrounded by a}} team of fifteen to twenty activists in two groups. One group attacked him when he landed on the ship's roof. He fired one shot at an activist holding a knife before being subdued. The activists seized his gun and beat him as he attempted to fight them off {{with his back to the}} hull. He was picked up by his arms and legs, and thrown over the hull. He attempted to hang onto the hull with both hands, but was forced to let go when activists beat his hands and pulled him down by his legs. He was then surrounded by another group of activists, stabbed in the stomach and dragged into a lounge while being beaten. A third soldier who was lowered onto the deck saw an activist waiting to attack him with an iron crowbar. After shoving him away, he was attacked by four more activists, one of whom wrapped a <b>chain</b> <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck</b> and choked him until he lost consciousness. He was then thrown onto the bridge deck, where he was attacked by about twenty activists, who beat him, cut away his equipment, and dragged him into the lounge. The three soldiers were severely wounded and bleeding heavily. Two of the soldiers had their hands tied, and a third was unconscious and went into convulsions. During their captivity, they were subjected to physical and verbal abuse, and photographed and filmed. One of the soldiers said that he was beaten after he began moving and yelling that one of the soldiers needed a doctor, and another said that he was placed onto a couch, beaten, and threatened that he would be beaten every time he moved. Although radical activists attempted to harm them further, more moderate passengers intervened and protected the soldiers. Two were given water and one with a severe stomach wound was given a gauze pad. Hasan Huseyin Uysal, a Turkish doctor, cleaned the blood off their faces and tended to facial cuts.|$|E
5000|$|The {{recumbent}} effigy of Sir John Speke, {{dressed in}} full armour, lies within a canopied recess {{in the north}} wall. He is bare-headed with long wavy hair, his head resting on his helm. He wears two long <b>chains</b> <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck</b> and holds <b>his</b> hands together above his chest in prayer. The walls are highly decorated with relief sculpture in panels, with stone vaulted ceiling with pendants, [...] "not an inch left unadorned". The decorations include much heraldry and several instances of the canting heraldic device of the Speke family, the porcupine, in French porc-épic, ("spiky-pig").|$|R
5000|$|Proponents {{insisted that}} the Pennsylvania system would involve only mild {{disciplinary}} measures, reasoning that isolated men would have neither the resources nor the occasion to violate rules or to escape. But from the outset Eastern State's keepers used corporal punishments to enforce order. Officials used the [...] "iron gag," [...] a bridle-like metal bit placed in the inmate's mouth and <b>chained</b> <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck</b> and head; the [...] "shower bath," [...] repeated dumping of cold water onto a restrained convict; or the [...] "mad chair," [...] into which inmates were strapped {{in such a way}} so as to prevent their bodies from resting.|$|R
50|$|He {{was born}} Willie Richard in Jackson, Mississippi. His stage name was in {{deference}} to his father's nickname, Linkchain, which was due to his habit of sporting logging <b>chains</b> <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck,</b> and the boy's childhood nickname, Hipstick. He {{was inspired by the}} blues playing of Sonny Boy Williamson II, Elmore James and Little Milton, all of whom Linkchain heard in the Mississippi Delta, before he relocated to Chicago, Illinois, in 1954. He was raised in Louise, Mississippi, and picked cotton before his move north. Linkchain found regular employment playing blues guitar in the clubs of Chicago throughout the 1950s and 1960s, working at various times with the harmonica players Lester Davenport, Dusty Brown, and Little Willy Foster.|$|R
500|$|... as {{the symbol}} of their married state. A widow is {{expected}} to wear a black sari {{for the remainder of}} her life, and is not allowed to wear ornaments. The bridegroom's dress in early times consisted of a short loincloth of hand-woven cloth (Dhoti), a shawl to cover his shoulders, and a red handkerchief on the head (Leis). Later, his dress consisted of a white loincloth with a red and gold hem (todop), a shirt with gold buttons and a coat (Kutanv), a shawl on the shoulders, and a towel (Urmal) on the head. The bridegroom wore a Chakrasar (neck <b>chain)</b> <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck.</b> He wore a pair of sandals or at least a pair of socks. At present, most Mangalorean Catholic couples opt for a White wedding, where the bridegroom wears a suit, while the bride wears a white wedding gown. The traditional style of wedding is becoming exceedingly rare.|$|E
500|$|When {{developing}} Advent Children, Nomura {{stated that}} because of the comparisons between Barret's original design and Mr. T, they decided to take it in a different direction for the film, implementing co-director Takeshi Nozue's suggestion to give him cornrows for his hair, while Nomura designed his face. Artist Yusuke Naora influenced the design as well, developing his attire, which originally consisted of white overalls, before instead having him wear him a down vest. Barret's arm tattoo was changed as well, although it retained the [...] "skull and fire" [...] motif of the original. Other aspects of his design included the loss of the metal bands around his body, a white sleeve extending from the middle of his right forearm to his elbow fastened by straps, a black band on his left forearm surrounded by a pink string and bow, and a fishnet shirt that ends in torn fibers below his waist. The dog tags were altered to a bullet and medallion supported by a <b>chain</b> <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck,</b> and three rings covered his left hand. His Gimmick Arm was modified into a robotic prosthetic hand, developed by Nomura, with the only guideline being [...] "a huge, over-the-top gun that transforms in a huge, over-the-top way." [...] Nozue stated that these specifics made it difficult to work with, and decided to conceal the hand's transformation sequence into the gun as much as possible. His Advent Children design was also planned to be used for the Final Fantasy VII remake. However, the staff later decided to give every character in the party a new look.|$|E
60|$|Again {{the black}} slaves took Beppo to the bath, {{only this time}} they clad him in a fine suit of velvet and hung a gold <b>chain</b> <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck.</b> After that Sebastian the Goldsmith again served a feast to Beppo, and waited upon him while he ate and drank.|$|E
5000|$|The 2010 film {{adaptation}} {{presents a}} Bosco [...] "B. A." [...] Baracus (born on June 20, 1978 in Phoenix) who {{is referred to}} simply as Bosco {{for much of the}} film's first act. In the film, he is a former Corporal when he meets Hannibal, and a Sergeant First Class {{by the time of the}} trial. While B. A. retains his trademark hairstyle, he does not wear gold <b>chains</b> <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck</b> like <b>his</b> TV counterpart did. Aside from the Army Ranger tattoo on his right arm, he sports tattoos on his knuckles: the left spells [...] "PITY", while the right spells [...] "FOOL". This is a reference to Mr. T's catchphrase, [...] "I pity the fool." ...|$|R
50|$|While Ana Mendieta’s work {{focused on}} a serious issue, other artists, like Lynda Benglis, took a more satirical stance in the fight towards equality. In one of her {{photographs}} published in Artforum, she is depicted naked with a short haircut, sunglasses, and a dildo positioned in her pubic region. Some saw this radical photo as “vulgar” and “disturbing”. Others, however, saw {{an expression of the}} uneven balance between the genders in the sense that her photo was critiqued more harshly than her male counterpart, Robert Morris, who posed shirtless with <b>chains</b> <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck</b> as a sign of submission. At this time, the depiction of a dominant woman was highly criticized and in some cases, female art depicting sexuality was perceived as pornographic.|$|R
50|$|Coldcast was a {{very large}} and muscular African-American man who wore dreadlocks and <b>chains</b> and manacles <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck</b> and wrists. He is capable of {{manipulating}} electromagnetism. He was eventually inspired by Superman to fight {{on the side of}} heroes.|$|R

But the two-sided man had overheard the remark, and he now stepped forward and said in a careless tone: ...|$|E
60|$|Meantime the King ordered {{refreshments}} to {{be served}} to those waiting, and at his command a rudely shaped Nome entered, bearing a tray. This Nome was not unlike the others that Dorothy had seen, but he wore a heavy gold <b>chain</b> <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck</b> {{to show that he}} was the Chief Steward of the Nome King, and he assumed an air of much importance, and even told his majesty not to eat too much cake late at night, or he would be ill.|$|E
6000|$|... "This {{village was}} built {{of mud and}} stone, and had no streets. Some few yellow-and-brown persons popped their heads out-of-doors, looking about like Welsh rabbits with Worcester sauce on em. Out of the biggest house, that {{had a kind of}} a porch around it, steps a big white man, red as a beet in color, dressed in fine tanned deerskin clothes, with a gold <b>chain</b> <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck,</b> smoking a cigar. I've seen United States Senators of his style of {{features}} and build, also head-waiters and cops.|$|E
50|$|In the video, G-Unit flaunts Maybach Music Group's rapper Gunplay's MMG {{chain that}} was taken from him at a brawl {{backstage}} at the 2012 BET Hip Hop Awards. G-Unit's Kidd Kidd has the <b>chain</b> draped <b>around</b> <b>his</b> sons <b>neck</b> in the video.|$|R
2500|$|The Buckle {{was found}} in a gravel spit in the River Tweed in 1979 [...] and depicts a “well-muscled mulatto {{probably}} the offspring of a white overseer and a black slave mother” at the wicket being bowled out.

60|$|Then {{came the}} Rulers {{of the four}} Kingdoms of Oz; the Emperor of the Winkies, the Monarch of the Munchkins, the King of the Quadlings and the Sovereign of the Gillikins, each wearing a long <b>chain</b> of {{emeralds}} <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck</b> {{to show that he}} was a vassal of the Ruler of the Emerald City.|$|R
6000|$|The two {{automobiles}} stood side by side, {{about three}} yards apart. Between {{them was a}} big and angry-looking bull, tramping the ground and snorting viciously. The bull had a <b>chain</b> <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck,</b> and {{to the end of}} this was a small-sized tree stump, which the animal had evidently pulled from the ground in his endeavor to get away from his pasture. The tree stump had become entangled in the wheel of one of the automobiles, and the bull was giving vicious jerks, first one way and then another, causing the machine to [...] "slew around" [...] in an alarming fashion.|$|E
6000|$|... "He made a gallant figure," [...] {{says the}} old narrator, [...] "being {{dressed in a}} rich crimson {{waistcoat}} and breeches and red feather in his hat, a gold <b>chain</b> <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck,</b> with a diamond cross hanging to it, a sword in his hand, and two pair of pistols hanging {{at the end of}} a silk sling flung over his shoulders according to the fashion of the pyrates." [...] Thus he appeared in the last engagement which he fought--that with the Swallow--a royal sloop of war. A gallant fight they made of it, those bulldog pirates, for, finding themselves caught in a trap betwixt the man-of-war and the shore, they determined to bear down upon the king's vessel, fire a slapping broadside into her, and then try to get away, trusting to luck in the doing, and hoping that their enemy might be crippled by their fire.|$|E
6000|$|... "Behind {{the wooden}} doors are others of steel. The entire {{cupboard}} is steel-lined. Near {{the bottom is}} a sliding-plate, which, when pushed aside, discovers a hidden drawer--a secret my father never confided to anyone but me. He {{once told me that}} if his heart trouble earned him off suddenly I ought to know of the existence of this drawer; so he showed me how to find it. On the day after his death I took the keys, which he always carried on a small <b>chain</b> <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck</b> and concealed underneath his clothing, and opened the cupboard to see if I could find anything of value. It is needless to say, I could not discover anything that could be converted into a dollar. The Captain had filled the cupboard with old letters and papers of no value, and with relics he had brought from foreign lands during his many voyages. These last are mere rubbish, but I suppose he loved them for their association. In the secret drawer I found his stock in the timber company, and also that of old Will Thompson, who had doubtless left it with my father for safekeeping. Knowing it was now worthless, I left it in the drawer." ...|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, {{the faith}} of the Queen and others {{remained}} strong in the productiveness of the newly discovered territory, which she herself named Meta Incognita. It was resolved to send out a larger expedition than ever, with everything necessary to establish a colony of 100 men. Frobisher was again received by the queen, and her Majesty threw a fine <b>chain</b> of gold <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck.</b>|$|R

60|$|These {{were opened}} by a cheerful looking little man who wore green {{spectacles}} over his eyes. Dorothy {{introduced him to}} her friends as the Guardian of the Gates, and they noticed a big bunch of keys suspended on the golden <b>chain</b> that hung <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck.</b> The chariot passed through the outer gates into a fine arched chamber built in the thick wall, and through the inner gates into {{the streets of the}} Emerald City.|$|R

2500|$|Holmes escapes and he, Watson, and Adler find Blackwood's men in {{the sewers}} {{guarding}} a device based on Reordan's experiments, designed to release cyanide gas into the Parliament chambers and kill all but Blackwood's supporters, whom he has secretly given an antidote. Blackwood comes before Parliament and announces their impending deaths, then attempts to activate the cyanide device by remote control, but it is disabled by Adler. Blackwood flees Parliament and sees Adler and Holmes in the sewers, and pursues them {{to the top of}} the incomplete Tower Bridge. Blackwood fights Holmes, as the latter deduces how all of Blackwood's supposed supernatural feats were the work of science and trickery. Blackwood plummets off the bridge and falls entangled in a noose of chains, killing him when the <b>chain</b> wrapped <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck</b> hangs him. Adler explains to Holmes that her employer is Professor Moriarty, and she warns that Moriarty is as intelligent as Holmes and far more duplicitous.|$|R
50|$|A man {{enters a}} room, sits down, and brushes the {{previous}} diner's leftovers onto the floor. Across from him sits another {{man with a}} placard attached to a <b>chain</b> hanging <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck.</b> The diner stands up and reads the placard one line {{at a time and}} follows the instructions. He puts money down the man's throat and pokes him in the eye. The man's shirt unbuttons itself, and a dumbwaiter rises up into where the man's chest should be. The diner takes his food, and punches the man in the chin with his third knuckle for his utensils. When he is done eating, he kicks the man's shin for a napkin. After wiping off his mouth, the diner convulses, and then goes limp. The man now comes to life, stretches, and places the placard on the former diner. He stands and puts another tally mark on the wall. Another diner comes in and the scenario is repeated with him. At the end, we see a line stretching down the hall and around the corner.|$|R

Shortly after his move, he answered the ad and met with Slash and Adler at Canter's Deli. Describing McKagan's appearance upon meeting him at Canter's, Slash said that he was [...] "this bone-skinny six-foot-plus guy, with short spiked blonde hair who rolled in wearing a Sid Vicious-style <b>chain</b> and padlock <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck,</b> combat boots, and a red-and-black leather trench coat in spite of the seventy-five-degree weather.
