International Journal of Advanced Structural Engineering. [URL] paper presents a numerical study that investigates {{the behavior of}} <b>continuous</b> <b>concrete</b> decks doubly reinforced with top and bottom {{glass fiber reinforced polymer}} (GFRP) bars subjected to top surface fire. A finite element (FE) model is developed and a detailed transient thermal analysis is performed on a <b>continuous</b> <b>concrete</b> bridge deck under the effect of various fire curves. A parametric study is performed to examine the top cover thickness and the critical fire exposure curve needed to fully degrade the top GFRP bars while achieving certain fire ratings for the deck considered. Accordingly, design tables are prepared for each fire curve to guide the engineer to properly size the top concrete cover and maintain the temperature in the GFRP bars below critical design values in order to control the full top GFRP degradation. It is notable to indicate that degradation of top GFRP bars do not pose a collapse hazard but rather a serviceability concern since cracks in the negative moment region widen resulting in simply supported spans...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Aiming at the {{problems}} of the concrete pavement transverse joint, and the characteristics of prestressed concrete pavement and continuously reinforced concrete pavement, a transversely prestressed <b>continuous</b> <b>concrete</b> pavement with oblique-reinforced is presented. ABAQUS software is adopted to establish respectively two three-dimensional finite element models of plain concrete pavement and transversely prestressed <b>continuous</b> <b>concrete</b> pavement with oblique-reinforced for calculating mechanical behavior under the standard load. The results show that, with a concrete pavement slab transversely prestressed, a finite prestressing force exist in longitudinal by bonding among oblique-reinforced and concrete, and there isn’t tensile stress under the load, so the possibility of slab breakage due to tensile stress is low. Due to its excellent performance, in addition its great load-carrying capacity and overall stability, the investigation is valuable for the research of seamlessly prestressed pavement...|$|R

50|$|The {{concrete}} pouring {{of the bottom}} slab of the box-shaped foundation ended March 1, 2015, was registered by Guinness World Records as the largest <b>continuous</b> <b>concrete</b> pour. 19,624 cubic metres of concrete was used which is approximately 3,000 cubic meters {{more than in the}} previous similar record registered at Wilshire Grand Tower.|$|R
50|$|The tower {{comprises}} three ironbark {{poles in}} a triangular plan, which taper inwards {{from the base}} of the tower to the top of the tower. Each pole consists of two logs spliced together approximately halfway up the height of the tower, and is set into a <b>concrete</b> <b>footing</b> at the base of the tower. Poles are braced and cross-braced.|$|R

30|$|It {{should be}} noted that the {{literature}} is lacking data on the fire resistance of <b>continuous</b> <b>concrete</b> bridge decks when subjected to top fire loading.

British Rail experimented with slabs during the late 1960s and laid several miles alongside the main running lines north of Derby.|$|R

Each bridge section, except at the cable-stayed portion, is supported on piers typically spaced 50 m apart.
