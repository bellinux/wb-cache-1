25|$|The {{course of}} the Ryton through Worksop is largely man-made. It {{originally}} flowed much nearer to Castle Hill, probably forming part of the defences, but was diverted in 1842 into a channel further north when the 4th Duke of Newcastle constructed Newcastle Street, {{in order to develop}} that part of the town. The river is then culverted as it passes under a shopping complex and the shops of Bridge Street. This section counts as a confined space, and was surveyed in 2007, in a joint venture between the Environment Agency, a team of divers, and Bassetlaw District Council. Some five tons of debris, half a ton of steel, and some stolen goods were removed from the culvert during the exercise. Beyond Watson Road bridge, sluices and extra channels point to the existence of the mill near the Priory. Priory Water Mill was in use from the medieval period until 1876, and a large lake called the <b>Canch</b> was formed in 1820, by constructing a dam across the leat which fed it. The <b>Canch</b> gradually became polluted, and was filled in when milling ceased in 1876. The buildings were utilised by William Bramer and Sons for their business of making chairs until they burnt down in 1912, and the site has more recently become the location of a sensory garden. Three channels continue under Priorswell Road through separate bridges, cross Bracebridge field, and join up again near the old High Hoe Road bridge.|$|E

The origin of the carnivals and their objective are not known, but the tradition is thought to be bound to the (?)<b>canching</b> and mysticism. In fact, the Joaldunak are said to have been not only the creatures who protected the cattle, but also the ones who chased the bad spirits away, favouring the good harvests.|$|R

He {{describes}} them as being “proud, cautious, and melancholy, their clothing was usually of a somber colour, and their music was plaintive and sad.” In comparison with the tribe of <b>Canches,</b> with whom they often warred, he further describes those of the tribe of Canas as “of a darker complexion” as well as “stouter and better made.” ...|$|R
50|$|The {{club was}} {{dissolved}} in 1836; {{some of its}} papers and relics were retained {{by one of the}} last members, Matthew Foster Connolly, burgh clerk of Anstruther Easter and Wester, who left them to his son-in-law the Reverend Dr J.F.S. Gordon. The remaining club money was bequeathed to fund prizes for girls at school in East Anstruther as well as to start a new social club at the nearby University of St Andrews. In 1892 an unknown author published Records of the Most Ancient and Puissant Order of the Beggar's Benison and Merryland, Anstruther with photographs of many of the relics. This work was reprinted in 1982 in the Gems of British Social History Series. There was an attempt by army officer Maxwell Robert <b>Canch</b> Kavanagh to revive the club in 1921. Most of the relics of the club, including objects with phallic decorations, are now held in the Beggar's Benison and Wig Club collection of the University of St Andrews. In 2002 David Stevenson, emeritus {{professor of history at the}} University of St Andrews, published a scholarly book on the Beggar's Benison.|$|E
