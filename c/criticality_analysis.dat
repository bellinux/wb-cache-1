The intense sound generated by the rocket propulsion system exerts significant acoustic pressure which induces vibrations. In addition, intense vibrations are generated by space propulsion engine ignitions, shut downs, sudden transient shocks generated by solid rocket motors and separation of stages. The vibration testing poses a challenge to design and realize good vibration test fixture. Launch vehicles have to undergo vibration testing prior to launch for its design qualification and flight acceptance.

40|$|Accurate and {{reliable}} computational methods {{are essential for}} nuclear criticality safety analyses. The SCALE (Standardized Computer Analyses for Licensing Evaluation) computer code system was originally developed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) to enable users to easily set up and perform criticality safety analyses, as well as shielding, depletion, and heat transfer analyses. Over the fifteen-year life of SCALE, the mainstay of the system has been the <b>criticality</b> safety <b>analysis</b> sequences that have featured the KENO-IV and KENO-V. A Monte Carlo codes and the XSDRNPM one-dimensional discrete-ordinates code. The <b>criticality</b> safety <b>analysis</b> sequences provide automated material and problem-dependent resonance processing for each criticality calculation. This report details configuration management which is essential because SCALE consists of more than 25 computer codes (referred to as modules) that share libraries of commonly used subroutines. Changes to a single subroutine in some cases affect almost every module in SCALE! Controlled access to program source and executables and accurate documentation of modifications are essential to maintaining SCALE as a reliable code system.

50|$|Although {{initially}} {{developed by}} the military, FMEA methodology is now extensively used {{in a variety of}} industries including semiconductor processing, food service, plastics, software, and healthcare. Toyota has taken this one step further with its Design Review Based on Failure Mode (DRBFM) approach. The method is now supported by the American Society for Quality which provides detailed guides on applying the method. The standard Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) and Failure Modes, Effects and <b>Criticality</b> <b>Analysis</b> (FMECA)procedures identify the product failure mechanisms, but may not model them without specialized software. This limits their applicability to provide a meaningful input to critical procedures such as virtual qualification, root cause analysis, accelerated test programs, and to remaining life assessment. To overcome the shortcomings of FMEA and FMECA a Failure Modes, Mechanisms and Effect Analysis (FMMEA) has often been used.|$|E
50|$|A {{failure modes}} and effects analysis, FMEA, is a {{structured}} qualitative {{analysis of a}} system, subsystem, process, design or function to identify potential failure modes, their causes and their effects on (system) operation. The concept and practice of performing a FMEA, has been around in some form since the 1960s. The practice was first formalized in 1970s {{with the development of}} US MIL STD 1629/1629A.In early practice its use was limited to select applications and industries where cost of failure was particularly high. The primary benefits were to qualitatively evaluate the safety and reliability of a system, determine unacceptable failure modes, identify potential design improvements, plan maintenance activities and help understand system operation in the presence of potential faults. The failure modes, effects and <b>criticality</b> <b>analysis</b> (FMECA) was introduced to address a primary barrier to effective use of the detailed FMEA results by the addition of a criticality metric. This allowed users of the analysis to quickly focus on the most important failure modes/effects in terms of risk. This allowed prioritization to drive improvements based on cost / benefit comparisons.|$|E
5000|$|Reliability {{centered}} {{maintenance is}} an engineering framework {{that enables the}} definition of a complete maintenance regimen. It regards maintenance as the means to maintain the functions a user may require of machinery in a defined operating context.

This is embodied in the initial part of the RCM process which is to identify the operating context of the machinery, and write a Failure Mode Effects and <b>Criticality</b> <b>Analysis</b> (FMECA). The second part of the analysis is to apply the [...] "RCM logic", which helps determine the appropriate maintenance tasks for the identified failure modes in the FMECA.

These targets {{will be used to}} produce {sup 99 }Mo at Sandia National Laboratories and will be stored on-site prior to irradiation in the Annular Core Research Reactor. The analysis consisted of using the Monte Carlo code MCNP (Version 4 A) to model and predict the k{sub eff} for the proposed dry storage configuration under credible loss of geometry and moderator control. Effects of target pitch, non-uniform loading, and target internal/external flooding are evaluated. Further studies were done with deterministic methods to verify the results obtained from MCNP and to obtain a clearer understanding of the parameters affecting system criticality. The diffusion accelerated neutral particle transport code ONEDANT was used to model the target in a one-dimensional, infinite half-slab geometry and determine the critical slab thickness. Hand calculations were also completed to determine the critical slab thickness with modified one-group, and one-group, two region approximations. Results obtained from ONEDANT and the hand calculations were compared to applicable cases in a commonly used <b>criticality</b> safety <b>analysis</b> handbook. Overall, the critical slab thicknesses obtained in the deterministic analysis were much larger than the dimensions of the cabinet and further support the predictions by MCNP that a critical system cannot be attained for the base case or in conditions where loss of geometry and moderation control occur...|$|R

50|$|The FME(C)A is {{a design}} tool used to {{systematically}} analyze postulated component failures {{and identify the}} resultant effects on system operations. The analysis is sometimes characterized as consisting of two sub-analyses, the first being the failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA), and the second, the <b>criticality</b> <b>analysis</b> (CA). Successful development of a FMEA requires that the analyst include all significant failure modes for each contributing element or part in the system. FMEAs can be performed at the system, subsystem, assembly, subassembly or part level. The FMECA should be a living document during development of a hardware design. It should be scheduled and completed concurrently with the design. If completed in a timely manner, the FMECA can help guide design decisions. The usefulness of the FMECA as a design tool and {{in the decision-making process}} is dependent on the effectiveness and timeliness with which design problems are identified. Timeliness is probably the most important consideration. In the extreme case, the FMECA would be of little value to the design decision process if the analysis is performed after the hardware is built. While the FMECA identifies all part failure modes, its primary benefit is the early identification of all critical and catastrophic subsystem or system failure modes so they can be eliminated or minimized through design modification at the earliest point in the development effort; therefore, the FMECA should be performed at the system level as soon as preliminary design information is available and extended to the lower levels as the detail design progresses.|$|E
