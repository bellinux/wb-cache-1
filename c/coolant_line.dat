40|$|When photogrammetrists read {{an article}} {{entitled}} "Photogrammetry in Space" they immediately think of terrestrial mapping using satellite imagery. However in the last 19 years the roll of close range photogrammetry {{in support of the}} manned space flight program has grown exponentially. Management and engineers have repeatedly entrusted the safety of the vehicles and their crews to the results of photogrammetric analysis. In February 2010, the Node 3 module was attached to the port side Common Berthing Mechanism (CBM) of the International Space Station (ISS). Since this was not the location at which the module was originally designed to be located on the ISS, <b>coolant</b> <b>lines</b> containing liquid ammonia, were installed externally from the US Lab to Node 3 during a spacewalk. During mission preparation I had developed a plan and a set of procedures to have the astronauts acquire stereo imagery of these <b>coolant</b> <b>lines</b> {{at the conclusion of the}} spacewalk to enable us to map their as-installed location relative to the rest of the space station. Unfortunately, the actual installation of the <b>coolant</b> <b>lines</b> took longer than expected and in an effort to wrap up the spacewalk on time, the mission director made a real-time call to drop the photography. My efforts to reschedule the photography on a later spacewalk never materialized, so rather than having an as-installed model for the location of <b>coolant</b> <b>lines,</b> the master ISS CAD database continued to display an as-designed model of the <b>coolant</b> <b>lines.</b> Fast forward to the summer of 2015, the ISS program planned to berth a Japanese cargo module to the nadir Common Berthing Mechanism (CBM), immediately adjacent to the Node 3 module. A CAD based clearance analysis revealed a negative four inch clearance between the ammonia lines and a thruster nozzle on the port side of the cargo vehicle. Recognizing that the model of the ammonia line used in the clearance analysis was "as-designed" rather than "as-installed", I was asked to determine the real clearance between the ammonia lines and expected position of the thruster bell using existing on-orbit imagery. Imagery of the area of interest, taken several years earlier from the Space Shuttle during a fly-around of the ISS, was found and used to set a stereo pair. Space Vision System Targets and Handrail bolts measured in the ISS analytical coordinate system (ISSACS) prior to launch, were used to obtain an absolute orientation so all photogrammetric measurement's would be in the ISSACS coordinate system. Coordinates for the design location of the edges of the thruster bell, when the cargo vehicle was fully berthed to the ISS, were displayed in 3 -D relative to the as-installed ammonia lines. This immediately revealed a positive clearance, which was later quantified to be a minimum of 10 " +/ 0. 5 ". The analysis was completed over a single weekend by a single analyst. Using updated imagery, acquired from the station's robotic arm, a complete as-installed model of the <b>coolant</b> <b>lines</b> was generated from stereo photography and replaced the design model in the master ISS CAD database...|$|R

For the assessment of components of the primary cooling circuit, two methods are used by GRS. One is the simplified method ASTOR (approximated structural time of rupture). This method employs the hypothesis of linear damage accumulation for modeling damage progression. A failure time surface which is generated by structural finite element (FE) analysis of varying pressure and temperature loads serves as a basis for estimations of failure times. The second method is to perform thermohydraulic and structure mechanic calculations for the accident scenario under consideration using complex calculation models.

At the extrados a pipe whip restraint is welded on the outer surface of the elbow {{in order to prevent}} pipe whip for the postulated double-ended rupture. However, this arrangement significantly increases the effort for non-destructive testing (NDT) during in-service inspections. Moreover, weld sections of about 80 mm to 160 mm length cannot be accessed by NDT from outside. According to the German RSK (Reactor Safety Commission) Guideline, cracks postulated in areas of restricted access for NDT or in non-examinable zones should not cause a catastrophic failure of the reactor <b>coolant</b> <b>line.</b> To assure the safety of the pipe elbow against crack initiation and unstable propagation, numerical stress and crack driving force calculations are carried out taking into account the real geometry of the pipe whip restraint.

The material Ji value and the slope dJ/da of the measured JR-curve are employed as criteria for crack initiation and instability. The result suggest the critical length of a through crack (2 c) at initiation to be of some 800 mm which is considerably larger than the length of the non-examinable zone. Furthermore, by comparing the s lope of the Jappl(2 c) curve with the material resistance curve, a conclusion can be drawn that no crack instability may occur for any crack size below the length of the pipe whip restraint.

40|$|Following a Loss-of-Coolant-Accident (LOCA) {{in one of}} {{the primary}} <b>coolant</b> <b>lines</b> in the {{containment}} building of a PWR Facility, it is possible that fiberglass pipe insulation could be dislodged and washed down to the sump pool. This fiberglass could collect into a ”bed” and cause blockage on the sump screens, preventing the emergency re-circulation pumps from operating correctly. GSI- 191 is a Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) initiative to understand the effects a sump blockage would have on emergency cooling systems. Recently, the focus has been on understanding how the fiberglass bed will behave during an accident. An attempt was made to classify physical properties of the fiberglass bed that will allow for prediction of head loss through these beds. The analysis of experimental data successfully produced the Hammond Fiberglass Head-Loss (HFH) correlation. The HFH correlation predicts head-loss through an NEI fiberglass bed using only the fiber bed mass and the velocity through the bed. The HFH correlation has allowed for better understanding of fiberglass bed mechanics through its approach at assuming a non-uniform bed porosity, something that has not been done to this point.

In addition, the <b>coolant</b> <b>lines</b> were damaged and chloromethane gas started leaking and poisoning the air. At 21:00, after eleven hours of hammering, with the badly damaged boat, continuously rising water, low air reserves and leaking chloromethane gas captain Acanfora ordered the boat to surface. At 21:30 Durbo appeared on the surface and captain Acanfora ordered to abandon the ship, destroy all secret documentation and codes, and scuttle the ship.|$|R
40|$|The z= 3. 02 quasar SDSS J 095253. 83 + 011421. 9 {{exhibits}} broad metal-line emission (CIV FWHM= 9000 km/s), but broad Ly-alpha emission is not present. Instead, only {{a narrow}} Ly-alpha line is observed (FWHM= 1140 km/s). The large CIV/Ly-alpha ratio in the broad-line region (BLR) emission from this object can be matched most closely by a BLR dominated by gas {{at very high}} densities (10 ^ 15 cm^- 3), which suppresses the Ly-alpha emission, and illuminated by an incident power-law extending to ~ 200 micron, which yields increased emission from purely collisionally excited <b>coolant</b> <b>lines</b> (such as CIV, NV and OVI) but not from recombination lines like Ly-alpha. However, the strong CIII emission predicted by this model is not observed, and the observed broad CIII] emission must come from a lower-density BLR component and should be accompanied by broad Ly-alpha emission which is not observed. The least unlikely explanation for this spectrum {{seems to be that}} any intrinsic broad Ly-alpha emission is removed by smooth NV absorption in the red wing of the Ly-alpha emission line and by smooth Ly-alpha absorption in the blue wing of the Ly-alpha emission line. This postulated smooth absorption would be in addition to the strong, associated, narrow absorption seen in numerous ions. Smooth absorption in Ly-alpha, NV and OVI but not in CIV would be unusual, but not impossible, although it is suspicious that the postulated absorption must almost exactly cancel the postulated intrinsic broad emission. We conclude that the spectrum of SDSS J 0952 + 0114 appears unique (among ~ 3600 SDSS spectra of quasars at z> 2. 12) because of some_combination_ of unusual parameters, and we discuss possible observations to determine the combination of circumstances responsible for the spectrum.
