It starts with showing a number of Latin people dancing in a Spanish barrio as Madonna watches them from her window. She plays two different characters in the video: a short-haired Catholic woman and a colorful Flamenco dancer. The characters are quite opposite in their portrayal, which is emphasized by two opposing settings for the characters. Firstly, the video shows a sparsely decorated room with an altar and pictures of Hispanic people on the wall. Madonna plays a pale-looking, pious young woman wearing a white petticoat and her short hair brushed back. She sheds tears in her room and reluctantly ignores the invitation of the Latinos in the street to join them.|$|E
