Vannevar Bush, who as civilian director of the OSRD oversaw the NDRC, agreed, and selected Smyth to write the report following the recommendation of NDRC chairman James Bryant Conant. Groves granted Smyth unlimited access, waiving his usual security-minded insistence on compartmentalization. Smyth wrote {{what became known as the}} Smyth Report in his office in Princeton's Palmer Laboratory, which later became the Frist Campus Center.|$|E
5|$|The {{details of}} the {{earthquake}} were not widely publicized by Chinese authorities until about 18 years after its occurrence. In China's first decades of Communist rule, its policy was to not disclose natural disasters or accidents unless foreigners were injured. While the Chinese official press had not released a <b>comprehensive</b> <b>report,</b> Reuters and the Royal Hong Kong Observatory both released information soon after the disaster. At {{the time of the}} quake, the Xinhua News Agency briefly mentioned a smaller magnitude quake but did not provide information on damage or casualties.|$|E

Coalinga recovered 98 percent of their expenses in repairing and rebuilding public buildings at a time when an 85 percent recovery rate was considered the standard success rate. In September 2006, the California Seismic Safety Commission was renamed the Alfred E. Alquist Seismic Safety Commission in honor of the then recently deceased California politician Al Alquist. In addition, the commission member's per diem expenses were raised from $50 to $100 per day and their duties specific to the 1983 Coalinga earthquake were deleted before the <b>comprehensive</b> <b>report</b> was prepared.|$|E
25|$|As {{this program}} {{got under way}} it became painfully evident that in the 1930s most states lacked any kind of {{comprehensive}} plans for state park systems. In 1941 the Service published its first <b>comprehensive</b> <b>report,</b> A Study of the Park and Recreation Problem in the United States, a careful review of the whole problem of recreation and of national, state, county, and municipal parks in the United States. Interrupted by World War II, Director Wirth arranged for these studies to be resumed with the inception of Mission 66, and a second <b>comprehensive</b> <b>report</b> was published in 1964 entitled Parks for America, A Survey of Park and Related Resources in the Fifty States and a Preliminary Plan. Numerous land planning studies of individual areas, river basins, and regions accompanied and supported these comprehensive reports. The four new types of Federal Recreation Areas added to the System between 1933 and 1964 were generally consistent with recommendations in these studies.|$|E

25|$|In 2005, Sereno {{organized}} {{an international}} team of archaeologists {{to explore the}} site. These archaeologists discovered that Gobero had been almost continually inhabited for 5000 years, beginning roughly from 8000 BCE onwards when the area fronted a large lake. The 2007 and 2008 expeditions had to be canceled due to hostilities between Nigerien government forces and Tuareg tribesmen. The first <b>comprehensive</b> <b>report</b> on Gobero was published by Sereno in August 2008, and he returned again to the region in 2011.|$|E
25|$|During the 1790s, the {{problems}} of effective drainage worsened, and the commissioners appointed Isaac Leatham, from Barton near Malton, to produce a <b>comprehensive</b> <b>report</b> with recommendations for the Ancholme Level. He addressed the issues of both drainage and navigation, and presented his plans on 29 August 1800, but commissioners thought the projected cost of £22,975 was excessive. They therefore approached John Rennie (the Elder) for a second opinion, and he produced a report on 9 November 1801. His proposals included constructing catchwater drains {{on either side of}} the main channel, enlarging the width and depth of the channel, building two new locks, and rebuilding the road bridge at Brigg. The cost was estimated to be £53,921, of which only 11 per cent was for improvements to navigation. Again, the commissioners were unhappy with the cost, and although Rennie suggested completing the work in stages, he later produced a modified plan which would only cost £25,413.|$|E
25|$|The {{project has}} used crowd-sourcing to create maps which show where sexual assault has taken place. In 2012, Women Under Siege {{put out a}} call to people from Syria and those working with Syrian {{refugees}} {{to provide information about}} rape and sexual assault. The entries were created by collecting information from journalists, human rights activists and individual citizens. Some the reports came via email or by Twitter with the hashtag #RapeinSyria. Women Under Siege mapped these incidents, providing over 117 pieces of data for each entry. The data was documented in real time, using a software developed by Ushahidi. The data was analyzed and put together in a <b>comprehensive</b> <b>report</b> that details a huge amount of human suffering. Not only did the information shine a light on the problem, it also uncovered unexpected findings. For example, the data revealed that Syrian government forces were also largely responsible for much of the sexual violence.|$|E

Although <b>comprehensive</b> <b>reporting</b> facilitates accurate assessment of a paper’s claims, the current reporting norm is secrecy, not openness. We begin by putting this situation into historical context, comparing reporting norms from a bygone era to those of today. Next, we explain why transparency is desirable, even if full compliance is not achieved. We then outline the obstacles – both psychological and institutional – to <b>comprehensive</b> <b>reporting.</b> We go on to discuss possible remedies, and end by drawing connections between the disclosure problem and other ongoing challenges within psychological science and allied fields...|$|R
25|$|After {{disembarking}} reinforcements {{and supplies}} at Oran and Mers El Kébir, Francisco de Mendoza's fleet returned to Spain. King Philip II, {{informed about the}} development of the siege, decided to reward Martín de Córdoba and Francisco Vivero, commanding officer of Fort San Miguel, for keeping these two crucial strongholds in Spanish hands. In fact, this allowed the capture the following year of Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera, a success which was followed in 1565 by the decisive defense of Malta against the fleet of Turgut Reis. Several years later, in 1574, it was discussed at the Spanish court whether or not to abandon Oran and Mers El Kébir. King Philip II ordered Vespasian Gonzaga Colonna, Prince of Sabbioneta and Duke of Trayecto, to make a <b>comprehensive</b> <b>report</b> about the situation of both towns. Gonzaga advised to abandon Oran but to keep Mers El Kebir. However, marshal Juan Muñoz sent to the king a report by Sancho de Leyva advising to keep both strongholds. Philip II finally opted for the advice of Leyva.|$|E
25|$|An {{investigation}} by Prince Zeid Ra’ad Zeid Al-Hussein, then Permanent Representative of Jordan to the United Nations, in 2006 {{resulted in a}} <b>comprehensive</b> <b>report</b> which detailed some of this abuse in detail— particularly that which occurred in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Sexual exploitation frequently {{came in the form}} of prostitution, wherein some money (an average of $1-$3 per encounter) was exchanged for sex. In other instances food, or jobs were utilized to ply women for sex. Other young women reported of “rape disguised as prostitution”, whereabouts Peacekeepers would rape them and were then given some money or food in order to make the act seem consensual. Between May and September 2004, there were seventy-two allegations of sexual exploitation—68 against military and 4 against civilian personnel. By the end of 2004 there would be a total of 105 allegations. The majority of these allegations were in regards to sex with person under the age of 18 years (45 percent) and sex with adult prostitutes (31 percent). Rape and sexual assault made up approximately 13 and 5 percent respectively, with the remaining 6 percent of allegations relating to other forms of sexual exploitation. Most of the allegations were against peacekeepers from Pakistan, Uruguay, Morocco, Tunisia, South Africa, and Nepal.|$|E
