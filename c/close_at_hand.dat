5|$|Although {{the revolt}} was quickly suppressed, exaggerated reports of {{disaster}} prompted Mucianus to depart the capital with reinforcements of his own. Domitian eagerly sought {{the opportunity to}} attain military glory and joined the other officers {{with the intention of}} commanding a legion of his own. According to Tacitus, Mucianus was not keen on this prospect but since he considered Domitian a liability in any capacity that was entrusted to him, he preferred to keep him <b>close</b> <b>at</b> <b>hand</b> rather than in Rome.|$|E
5|$|When the mariner, sailing over tropic seas, {{looks for}} relief from his weary watch, {{he turns his}} eyes toward the Southern Cross, burning luridly above the tempest-vexed ocean. As the midnight {{approaches}} the Southern Cross begins to bend, and the whirling worlds change their places, and with starry finger-points the Almighty marks the passage of Time upon the dial of the universe; and though no bell may beat the glad tidings, the look-out knows that the midnight is passingthat relief and rest are <b>close</b> <b>at</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|E

5|$|The safety fougasse design had the {{advantage}} that without the propelling charge the fougasse was sufficiently safe {{that it did not}} require a guard. Banks records that installing the charge only when there was clear danger relatively <b>close</b> <b>at</b> <b>hand</b> was a safety feature required to protect the public from accidents. The ammonal used for the main propellant charge is a cheap industrial explosive that is notoriously hygroscopic, becoming less effective when it absorbs moisture. Even though the charge was packed into a rubber bag in a tin and sealed with insulating tape, {{it would not have been}} a good idea to store it for long in the damp conditions of a flame fougasse installation.|$|E
5|$|The {{attendant}} tells Scully that Mr. Milsap is {{the only}} person with a working phone, but she discovers that the line is dead. Mr. Milsap offers Scully a room at the local boarding house, but Scully tries the rest of the town only to be ignored by everyone; they are all too engrossed in Bible study groups. Disturbed by the turn of events, she keeps her gun <b>close</b> <b>at</b> <b>hand.</b> The next morning, Mr. Milsap tells Scully that there is a man who needs help downstairs. She goes with him and finds the hitchhiker from the teaser having a seizure. She advises them {{to take him to the}} hospital, but they pretend that they do not have any cars. While examining the man, Scully discovers a strange circular wound on his back. Meanwhile, Doggett calls the local sheriff and learns that Scully has not arrived yet, and so he sets out to find her.|$|E
5|$|The Congress disbanded in {{the third}} week of December, and the next step would be a {{congress}} at Laibach to discuss intervention with Ferdinand. Metternich found himself able to dominate Laibach more than any other congress, overseeing Ferdinand's rejection of the liberal constitution he had agreed to only months before. Austrian armies left for Naples in February and entered the city in March. The Congress was adjourned but, forewarned or by luck, Metternich kept representatives of the powers <b>close</b> <b>at</b> <b>hand</b> until the revolt was put down. As a result, when similar revolts broke out in Piedmont in the middle of March, Metternich had the Tsar at hand, who agreed to send 90,000 men to the frontier in a show of solidarity. Concerns grew in Vienna that Metternich's policy was too expensive. He responded that Naples and Piedmont would pay for stability; nonetheless, he, too, was clearly worried for the future of Italy. He was relieved when able to create a Court Chancellor and Chancellor of State on 25 May, a post left vacant since the death of Kaunitz in 1794. He was also pleased at the renewed (if fragile) closeness between Austria, Prussia and Russia; however, it had {{come at the expense of}} the Anglo-Austrian entente.|$|E

Michael waited, too, but <b>closer</b> <b>at</b> <b>hand.</b> <b>At</b> first he lay down, panting from his run, by the stream-edge.

5|$|The {{green and}} golden bell frog has been {{detected}} {{in a wide}} range of habitats. It is generally associated with coastal swamps, wetlands, marshes, dams, ditches, small rivers, woodlands, and forests, but populations have also been found at former industrial sites (for instance, the Brickpit). It has even been found in human vessels such as bathtubs. The requirements of its habitat have been difficult to determine, for it has been found {{in a wide range}} of water bodies except fast-flowing streams. It is most typically found in short-lived freshwater ponds that are still, shallow, unshaded, and unpolluted, and it tends to avoid waters that contain predatory fish, whether native or introduced. However, it is most often found in areas that have been affected by human habitation. The frog prefers water bodies that support emergent vegetation, such as reeds and bullrushes, for basking, and winter habitats consist of available shelters around the breeding site, which can be vegetation, rocks, rubbish, or human debris and discarded building materials. Grassy habitats are usually <b>close</b> <b>at</b> <b>hand</b> to provide suitable terrestrial feeding grounds. It prefers waterways with a substrate of sand, rock, or clay, and can tolerate a wide range of water turbidities, pH and oxygen levels, and temperatures, although these can hamper physical growth. Although its legs provide much grip, the frog does not choose to climb trees or live up them to any significant extent. It spends most of its time within 10cm of the ground and rarely ventures more than a metre above the ground. The green and golden bell frog also has the ability to sit still for several minutes.|$|E
5|$|A second noted {{house in}} the Dupont Circle {{neighborhood}} which is claimed to be haunted is the Woodrow Wilson House (2340 S Street NW). Woodrow Wilson was elected President of the United States in 1912, was re-elected in 1916 promising to keep the nation out of war, led the nation through World War I, and left office in 1921. At 2 AM on September 26, 1919, while traveling to Wichita, Kansas, on a nationwide speaking tour to win public support to pressure the Senate into ratifying the Treaty of Versailles, Wilson collapsed and, after cancelling {{the rest of his}} speaking tour, was rushed back to the capital by train. His condition worsened on the journey, and upon arriving at the White House on October 2 the President suffered a life-threatening stroke that left him permanently paralyzed on his left side and blind in the left eye. Although the President lived, he was confined to bed for two months, seen only by his wife, a few close associates, and his physicians. From December 1919 to April 1920 Wilson required a wheelchair. Wilson attended his first Cabinet meeting in April 1920, {{but for the rest of}} the year his mind continued to wander, his memory was marred, and he tired easily. By March 1921 (when he left office) Wilson was able to walk short distances with the use of a cane (and with a valet <b>close</b> <b>at</b> <b>hand).</b> The extent of Wilson's disability was kept from the public until after his death on February 3, 1924. President and Mrs. Wilson purchased a large home at 2340 S Street NW, to which a number of modifications were made (including the addition of an elevator). Woodrow Wilson received few guests in his last years, and died in his third floor bedroom on February 3, 1924. His wife, Edith Bolling Galt Wilson, lived in the home until her death on December 28, 1961, and willed the home to the National Trust for Historic Preservation to be made into a museum honoring her husband. In the decades since her death, staff and visitors at the Woodrow Wilson House claim to have seen the President's ghost sitting in his rocking chair, heard the shuffle of a man walking with a cane, and heard a man sob.|$|E

25|$|Apologists like Dave Hunt in Peace, Prosperity and the Coming Holocaust and Hal Lindsey in The Terminal Generation {{have tended}} to {{interpret}} the phenomena of cults {{as part of the}} burgeoning evidence of signs that Christ's Second Advent is <b>close</b> <b>at</b> <b>hand.</b> Both Hunt, and Constance Cumbey, have applied a conspiracy model to interpreting the emergence of New Age spirituality and linking that to speculations about fulfilled prophecies heralding Christ's reappearance.|$|E
50|$|The area at {{the head}} of the Newport Valleys, from Tredegar to Pontypool, was rich in minerals: coal and iron, and limestone. The {{development}} of iron smelting processes in the eighteenth century led to a massive upsurge in industrial output, and the products of the industry needed to be transported to market. The roads and other communication systems in the eighteenth century were poor, and the minerals were conveyed to a watercourse on the backs of pack animals, at considerable expense. The watercourse <b>closest</b> <b>at</b> <b>hand</b> for the purpose was the River Usk at Newport, and it was to that point that the journey was made. Onward transport by ship from there was relatively easy.|$|R
5000|$|In 1921 the {{director}} of the state railway, Prince Purachatra, built the Railway Hotel close to the beach. Prince Krom Phra Naresworarit was the first member of the royal family to build a group of palaces at Ban Laem Hin, called Sukaves, and gave the beach next to his palace the name [...] "Hua Hin". King Prajadhipok (Rama VII) liked the place so much that he built a summer palace there which was later named Klai Kang Won ("far from worries"). From 2004 until 2006 it was the full-time residence of King Bhumibol Adulyadej (Rama IX), until health issues forced him to return to Siriraj Hospital in Bangkok, where medical facilities and physicians were <b>closer</b> <b>at</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|R

She became a major figure of the 1980s East Village scene associated with ABC No Rio, and has acted in low-budget horror and softcore porn films. As a teenager she developed an interest in punk through first wave Los Angeles punk artists. Pfahler moved to New York City in 1979 to start her creative career, attracted and inspired by extreme alternative artists The Cramps, Diamanda Galas, Lydia Lunch and Ethyl Eichelberger, but also by Butoh dance. She follows the artistic philosophy of Availablism, using what is <b>closest</b> <b>at</b> <b>hand</b> as both the inspiration for her work and the medium. Pfahler has appeared as a Calvin Klein model.|$|R
50|$|On November 10, 1994, Suleiman Adam Musa, a known {{religious}} fanatic, {{had gone}} into the club with intent to kill, under the pretense that he was delivering post to some singers. Khojali, who had been <b>closest</b> <b>at</b> <b>hand</b> to him along with another artist, Abdel Gadir Salim, were the random subjects of his attack. The latter survived. Official spokespeople for the authorities dubbed the killer as a 'mad man', although this was debated because Musa had held a 10-minute conversation with Salem, one of his subjects in which he appeared perfectly sane, whilst he had also carried the traits of not a mad man, but of a reasonably sane extremist. He called Allah Akbar (God is Great), and declared himself a mujahid as he carried out the stabbings.|$|R
25|$|The {{hardships of}} the Trail were many. Casualties caused by American airstrikes were low, {{accounting}} for only 2% of total losses. More dangerous enemies included malaria, foot infections {{and a variety}} of other maladies. Total losses to disease are estimated at around 10 to 20%. Sick soldiers were left to recuperate at various way-stations. Transit time could take months, and sometimes entire units were disrupted and disbanded. Recruits were generally given an optimistic picture of conditions in the south, with claims that victory was <b>close</b> <b>at</b> <b>hand</b> and that they would be welcomed as liberators by their oppressed southern brethren. They were often quickly disabused of such notions as they encountered sullen peasants and withering US firepower.|$|E
25|$|However it was {{essential}} that servants were <b>close</b> <b>at</b> <b>hand,</b> {{and so they were}} given their own specific floors, usually the lowest and the highest. These floors were often, as at Belton, distinguished by a different fenestration from the rooms of the employers in between. Hence at Belton can be seen the small windows of the semi-basement containing the kitchens, pantries and servants' dining halls. Above are the large windows lighting the principal rooms, while right {{at the top of the}} house are again the small windows of the servants’ bedrooms. These rooms which were entirely in main block of the house, and constituted distinct servants' quarters, were to be the forerunner of the service wing.|$|E
25|$|When hunter-gathering {{began to}} be {{replaced}} by sedentary food production it became more profitable to keep animals <b>close</b> <b>at</b> <b>hand.</b> Therefore, it became necessary to bring animals permanently to their settlements, although in many cases there was a distinction between relatively sedentary farmers and nomadic herders. The animals' size, temperament, diet, mating patterns, and life span were factors in the desire and success in domesticating animals. Animals that provided milk, such as cows and goats, offered a source of protein that was renewable and therefore quite valuable. The animal’s ability as a worker (for example ploughing or towing), as well as a food source, also had to be taken into account. Besides being a direct source of food, certain animals could provide leather, wool, hides, and fertilizer. Some of the earliest domesticated animals included dogs (East Asia, about 15,000 years ago), sheep, goats, cows, and pigs.|$|E
