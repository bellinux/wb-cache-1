The aim {{is to find the}} most reliable measurements to characterize the growth of heart and lungs from CT data. Standard measurements available on <b>chest</b> <b>radiographies</b> are compared with original measurements only available on CT scans. These measurements should characterize growth of organs as well as changes in their position relative to the thorax. Measurements were considered as functions of age.

Prior to the {{dissolution}} of the Soviet Union, [...] "tuberculosis rates were substantially lower Russia than they are today". [...] The previous TB control program was marked by actions such as annual <b>chest</b> <b>radiographies</b> to screen the Russian population, an emphasis on isolation of patients within long-term hospital settings, and mandatory BCG vaccination. [...] However, this system dissolved with the Soviet Union, as Russia's faltering economy failed to provide the industry necessary for production and purchase of adequate TB medication, healthcare workers, labs and diagnostic tests, and a sufficiently coordinated TB control system. [...] Additionally, Kimerling discusses that a disconnect between Russian ideals of proper TB management and the internationally prescribed standard TB therapy (DOTS therapy) has dampened control efforts. He notes that (with regard to short term standard therapy solutions) [...] "the term 'short' has a negative association and is not felt appropriate Russian TB protocol", and that [...] "the term 'standard' can be interpreted or translated as rule or regulation in the Russian language, resulting in negative connotations by limiting a physician's right to take an individual approach to patient care".|$|R

40|$|Background: Accurate early {{diagnosis}} of lung metastases {{is important for}} establishing therapeutic measures. Therefore, the present study aimed to compare survey thoracic radiographs and computerized tomography (CT) scans to specifically identify lung metastases in female dogs with mammary tumors. Methods: Twenty-one female dogs, weighing 3 to 34 kg and aged from 5 years to 14 years and 10 months, with mammary tumors were studied. In all dogs before the imaging examinations, fine-needle aspiration cytology of the mammary tumors was performed to confirm the diagnosis. Three-view thoracic radiographs were accomplished: right lateral, left lateral and ventrodorsal views. Sequential transverse images of the thorax were acquired on a spiral Scanner, before and after intravenous bolus injection of nonionic iodine contrast. Soft-tissue and lung windows were applied. All the mammary tumors were surgically removed and examined histologically. Results: The correlation between the cytological and histological results regarding presence of malignancy was observed in only 17 cases. In radiographic examinations, no dog displayed signs of lung metastases or thorax chest lesions. CT detected lung metastasis in two cases, while small areas of lung atelectasis located peripherally were found in 28. 57 % of the dogs.

Marble workers were dividedinto 4 groups according to work places: block cuttingline (Group A, n= 25), polishing unit (Group B, n= 33), tilecutting unit (Group C, n= 31), and office workers (n= 21). Control group (Group E, n= 30) consisted of similar demographicalcharacteristics without dust exposure. Dustconcentrations of all groups working environments weremeasured. The patients administered the questionnaire,and examination findings and respiratory function test resultswere recorded. Chest graphies were obtained. Results: All of factory workers were male and mean agewas 33, 4 ± 6, 3 years. There was no difference betweengroups in mean age and cigarette consumption. Dustconcentrations were similar in the first three groups, butit was lower in the office. In first three groups, cough andsputum frequencies were more than office group. Regardingthe respiratory function test results, no significantdifference was detected between the FEV 1, FVC andFEV 1 /FVC values.

The incidence of evantration is uncertain, although one paper reports that this entity is detected in 1 per 1400 <b>chest</b> <b>radiographies.</b> This article reports a case of right-sided eventration of diaphragm in 70 years old obese woman who was admitted to our institution with complaints of recurrent cough and sweating. Case report: A 70 year-old obese woman was admitted to Izmir Tepecik Education and Research Hospital Family Medicine Obesity Polyclinic with complaints of recurrent cough and sweating symptoms for the last few months. Reduction in lungs sounds on the right side and dullness were detected by the physical examination. X-ray chest in posteroanterior (PA) and lateral view exhibited elevation of the right diaphragm. During hospitalization patient was treated with Valsartan (320 mg) + Hydrochlorotiazide (12, 5 mg) combination for hypertension; atorvastatine 40 mg for hyperlipidemia; asetylsistein for productive cough and alginic acid as an antacid. She had had a 1800 kilocalories diet without salt. Upper respiratory tract symptoms were regressed and blood pressure was at the normal range. She was hospitalized for 15 days for diagnosis and weight reduction as well. Thus; the patient was discharged from the institution with the information about diaphragm eventration and obesity, and advised of their symptoms, warnings and guarding herself against trauma, and referred to Chest Diseases polyclinic. Conclusion: Respiratory symptoms such as recurrent cough and upper respiratory infections are the most common complaints in the patients' visits to family medicine practitioners.

40|$|Aim: The aim of {{the present}} study was to review {{clinical}} findings, radiological methods, and postoperative outcomes in patients who underwent an operation at our clinic due to diaphragmatic hernia. Material and Method: The medical records of 35 patients, who were operated on due to benign diaphragmatic hernia between January 2007 and June 2014, were retrospectively reviewed. The patients had been particularly evaluated using lateral and posteroanterior <b>chest</b> <b>radiographies</b> in the preoperative period. Other imaging modalities that were employed when required were computerized tomography, ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance imaging. The patients were divided into three groups: 10 (28. 6 %) had congenital diaphragmatic hernia, 16 (45. 7 %) had traumatic diaphragmatic hernia, and 9 (25. 7 %) had diaphragmatic eventration. Results: The mean age of the patients was 40. 9 ± 13. 8 years (range 14 %u 2013 66 years). Of the patients, 24 were males and 11 were females. Six patients (17. 1 %) underwent emergency thoracotomy procedure, and the remaining patients underwent an operation under elective conditions after preoperative assessment. None of the patients required the use of patch in the repair of defects. The imaging method was unable to establish a diagnosis in 13 of 27 patients who underwent computerized tomography, 14 of 22 patients who underwent ultrasonography, and 3 of 18 patients who underwent magnetic resonance imaging. When the groups were evaluated, magnetic resonance imaging was superior in diagnosing congenital diaphragmatic hernia, ultrasonography was superior in diagnosing diaphragmatic eventration, and computerized tomography was superior in diagnosing traumatic diaphragmatic laceration. A re-thoracotomy was required in three patients (8. 5 %) due to postoperative hemorrhage. One patient, who underwent emergency thoracotomy due to diaphragmatic, pulmonary and splenic laceration after sustaining a stab wound, died in the early period (operative mortality was 2. 9 %). Discussion: Despite the advances in radiological methods, the efficiency of radiological methods has not reached desired level in cases that are suspected to have a diaphragmatic pathology. In the present study, MR imaging yielded more valuable results compared to other imaging modalities in surgically confirmed cases. We therefore suggest that a holistic approach should be adopted while evaluating clinical and radiological data...|$|R

The quantification of image quality criteria yields a simpler method of optimizing image quality and patient dose relationships. Modifications of radiographic practice, based on image quality assessment and dose measurements, resulted in significant dose reductions and preservation of image quality.
