25|$|Under the empire, the {{citizens}} {{were divided into}} three classes, and for members of each class, a distinct career path was available (known as the cursus honorum). The traditional magistracies were only available to citizens of the senatorial class. The magistracies that survived {{the fall of the}} republic were (by their order of rank per the cursus honorum) the Consulship, Praetorship, Plebeian Tribunate, Aedileship, Quaestorship, and Military Tribunate. If an individual was not of the senatorial class, he could run for one of these offices if he was allowed to run by the emperor, or otherwise, he could be appointed to one of these offices by the emperor. During the transition from republic to empire, no office lost more power or prestige than the Consulship, which was due, in part, {{to the fact that the}} substantive powers of republican Consuls were all transferred to the emperor. Imperial Consuls could preside over the senate, could act as judges in certain criminal trials, and had control over public games and shows. The Praetors also lost a great deal of power, and ultimately had little authority outside of the city. The chief Praetor in Rome, the Urban Praetor, outranked all other Praetors, and for a brief time, they were given power over the treasury. Under the empire, the Plebeian Tribunes remained sacrosanct, and, in theory at least, retained the power to summon, or to veto, the senate and the assemblies. Augustus divided the <b>college</b> <b>of</b> <b>Quaestors</b> into two divisions, and assigned one division the task of serving in the senatorial provinces, and the other the task of managing civil administration in Rome. Under Augustus, the Aediles lost control over the grain supply to a board of commissioners. It wasn't until after they lost the power to maintain order in the city, however, that they truly became powerless, and the office disappeared entirely during the 3rd century.|$|E
50|$|The Chamber of the Representatives has, {{just like}} the Senate a <b>College</b> <b>of</b> <b>Quaestors,</b> which {{consists}} of five representatives who are elected by the plenary assembly for a duration of two years. The Quaestors {{are in charge of}} the housekeeping of the Chamber, they are also responsible for matters such as human resources and computers. The Colleges of Quaestors of the Senate and the Chamber meet regularly to settle common problems concerning the library, buildings, security, catering, etc.|$|E
50|$|The Senate has a <b>College</b> <b>of</b> <b>Quaestors,</b> which {{consists}} of three Senators who {{are in charge of}} Senate housekeeping. These Senators, who are known as Quaestors, are responsible for the financial management of the Senate, they {{have to make sure that}} the necessary equipment and facilities are available and they advise the Bureau on matters relating to the administration of the services of the Senate, such as human resources and logistics. The Quaestors are also members of the Bureau. The Colleges of Quaestors of the Senate and the Chamber of Representatives meet regularly to settle common problems concerning the library, buildings, security, catering, etc.|$|E
5000|$|Colleges {{were formed}} among the ancient Romans for various purposes. Some of these had a {{religious}} object, as the <b>college</b> <b>of</b> the Arval Brothers, of the Augurs, etc.; others were for administrative purposes, as <b>of</b> <b>qu√¶stors,</b> tribunes <b>of</b> the people; others again were trade unions or guilds, as the <b>colleges</b> <b>of</b> bakers, carpenters.|$|R
50|$|Sulla also {{increased}} the number <b>of</b> <b>quaestors</b> to 20. Quaestors were the least powerful in the senatorial magistracy.|$|R
50|$|The first {{appearance}} of Persicus is in June {{of the year}} 15, when he was co-opted into the Arval Brethren aged c. 15 to replace his then recently deceased father. At around that time, he was also made a member <b>of</b> the <b>College</b> <b>of</b> Pontiffs and of the Sodales Augustales. He subsequently held the posts <b>of</b> <b>quaestor</b> under Tiberius and praetor, though the details of these posts are unknown. His next dated post is in 34, when he became ordinary consul with Lucius Vitellius, {{the father of the}} later Roman Emperor, Vitellius.|$|R
50|$|The Bureau of the Senate is {{composed}} of the President, the three Vice-Presidents, the floor leaders of the fractions that are represented in the standing committees and the Quaestors. Currently, the only fraction whose floor leader is {{not a member of}} the Bureau is the Ecolo Fraction, which has only two members. The Bureau leads the day-to-day activities of the Senate and convenes at least once a week in order to manage the work of the Senate. The Bureau determines the legislative agenda and the order of business in the plenary assembly and the committees, decides upon the lists of speakers, and manages the internal affairs of the Senate. A member of the Federal Government is usually invited to attend the discussions about the legislative agenda. The Bureau also assists the President in the conduct of parliamentary business. In addition, the Bureau also appoints and dismisses the staff of the Senate on the advice of the <b>College</b> <b>of</b> <b>Quaestors.</b>|$|E
50|$|When Augustus became emperor, forty Quaestors {{were elected}} each year, but Augustus reduced this number to twenty. Augustus then divided the <b>college</b> <b>of</b> <b>Quaestors</b> into two divisions, and {{assigned}} one division {{the task of}} serving in the senatorial provinces, and the other the task of managing civil administration in Rome. The Quaestors who {{were assigned to the}} provinces (quaestores pro praetore) managed funds given to the province by the senate or the emperor. The two Urban Quaestors (quaestores urbani) had authority over the treasury in Rome (aerarium Saturni), which functioned as a depository for both state funds and official documents. In 56 AD the Quaestors lost their authority over state funds, but retained their authority over official documents. Julius Caesar had increased the number of Aediles to six, and while Augustus retained this number, he also transferred control of the grain supply from the Aediles to a board of commissioners. It wasn't until after they lost the power to maintain order in the city, however, that they truly became powerless, and the office disappeared entirely during the 3rd century.|$|E
