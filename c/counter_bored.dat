5000|$|On July 10, 1964, S&W {{introduced}} a more basic and inexpensive [...]41 Magnum intended for procurement by police departments. This budget {{version of the}} Model 57 was similar in principle of design to the [...]38 Special S&W heavy-barrel Model 10, or [...]357 Magnum Model 28 Highway Patrolman. Weighing in at 41 ounces, the Model 58 featured a 4" [...] barrel, fixed iron open sights, and simpler standard [...] "magna service" [...] grips. Finish options {{were the same as}} its upscale Model 57 brethren, blued and nickel, but shortly after the Model 58's introduction S&W decided a less expensive [...] "matte" [...] bluing treatment would be more appropriate for the basic [...] "workingman" [...] model. The no-frills Model 58 also lacked an ejection rod shroud, but retained the pinned barrel and <b>counter</b> <b>bored</b> cylinder of the more expensive Model 57. The Model 58 was manufactured from 1964 to 1977 and roughly 20,000 were produced. In 2008, it was released again by S&W, both in bright nickel and bright blue finish.|$|E

The guide ways were found cracked at the <b>counter</b> <b>bore</b> bottom end. The cracking was observed in all the 11 nos fixing holes {{in one of the}} guides and in 8 nos fixing holes in the other. In all the cases, the crack was found to have initiated at the fillet of the change of cross section of the fixing holes and propagated {{to the surface of the}} guide containing the <b>counter</b> <b>bore</b> top end. Fractographic study revealed that both the guide ways have failed by fatigue. Fatigue cracks have initiated at the fillet of the change of cross section of the fixing holes. The reason for fatigue crack initiation was found to be due to stress concentration at the fillet of change of cross section of the fixing holes...|$|R
40|$|The shuttle orbiter s {{reaction}} control system (RCS) primary thruster serial number 120 {{was found to}} contain cracks in the <b>counter</b> <b>bores</b> and relief radius after a chamber repair and rejuvenation was performed in April 2004. Relief radius cracking had been observed in the 1970 s and 1980 s in seven thrusters prior to flight; however, <b>counter</b> <b>bore</b> cracking had never been seen previously in RCS thrusters. Members of the Materials Super Problem Resolution Team (SPRT) of the NASA Engineering and Safety Center (NESC) conducted a detailed review of the relevant literature and of the documentation from the previous RCS thruster failure analyses. It was concluded that the previous failure analyses lacked sufficient documentation to support the conclusions that stress corrosion cracking or hot-salt cracking was {{the root cause of}} the thruster cracking and lacked reliable inspection controls to prevent cracked thrusters from entering the fleet. The NESC team identified and performed new materials characterization and mechanical tests. It was determined that the thruster intergranular cracking was due to hydrogen embrittlement and that the cracking was produced during manufacturing as a result of processing the thrusters with fluoride-containing acids. Testing and characterization demonstrated that appreciable environmental crack propagation does not occur after manufacturing...|$|R

For {{the proper}} {{performance}} of angle beam ultrasonic testing of steel welded joints with geometric reflectors such as <b>counter</b> <b>bores</b> and corners, {{it is necessary}} to have sound understanding on the underlying physics. To provide such an understanding, it is beneficial to have simulation tools for ultrasonic testing. In order to address such a need, we develop effective approaches to simulate angle beam ultrasonic testing with a personal computer. The simulation is performed using ultrasonic measurement models based on the computationally efficient multi-Gaussian beams. This paper will describe the developed angle beam ultrasonic testing models together with the experimental verification of their accuracy...|$|R

The {{finite element}} {{analytical}} {{model of a}} diesel engine is established to analyze the stress, the flatness, the roundness {{and the rate of}} light leakage of the diesel engine block. The analysis result shows that the optimized scheme improves the body's stress concentration and deformation obviously: the tensile stress between the upper cylinder sleeve shoulders spigot and the <b>counter</b> <b>bore</b> of cylinder head bolt decreases by 15 % compares to the original diesel engine block. The maximum stress decreases obviously and the stress concentration region moves down slightly by changing the “T ” type stiffener above the head of the block into rectangular stiffener; the flatness of the end surface of cylinder liner spigot decreases by 11. 3 %; the circularity and the rate of light leakage of each cross section on cylinder liner decreases obviously...|$|R

"When a boat is well built, {{properly}} trimmed, and not deep laden, {{the waves}} {{in a strong}} gale, when she is going large, seem always to slip from beneath her--which appears very strange to a landsman--and {{this is what is}} called riding, in sea phrase. Well, so far we had ridden the swells very cleverly; but presently a gigantic sea happened to take us right under the <b>counter,</b> and <b>bore</b> us with it as it rose--up--up--as if into the sky. I would not have believed that any wave could rise so high. And then down we came with a sweep, a slide, and a plunge, that made me feel sick and dizzy, as if I was falling from some lofty mountain-top in a dream. But while we were up I had thrown a quick glance around--and that one glance was all sufficient. I saw our exact position in an instant. The Moskoe-Ström whirlpool was {{about a quarter of a}} mile dead ahead--but no more like the every-day Moskoe-Ström, than the whirl as you now see it is like a mill-race.

40|$|The CNC {{machine tools}} are spatial {{machines}} that {{are able to}} control computer. There are two types of machine tools structure, C-frame and gantry-frame. A CNC gantry machine tool is defined as a computer numerically controlled machine that is programmed and controlled through a computer. Its CNC controller offers very short setup time flexibility to run batches of one to several thousand. Today, the CNC gantry machines are widely used in manufacturing combined with software programs to efficiently and consistently create different products for large companies or even single consumers. The CNC gantry machine is used in the manufacturing sector including drilling, milling, reaming, <b>boring</b> and <b>counter</b> <b>boring.</b> Parts can be grooved and threaded with CNC milling centers; they can be transformed into CNC lathes, CNC drill and tap areas; for CNC grinding; and used in conjunction with routers to make CNC wood engravers and letterers. The CNC gantry machine can be used to machine small, large, short and lengthy components. Currently, {{there are two types of}} such machines in the market. The first type has a moving worktable and fixed gantry and the second type has a moving gantry and fixed worktable. Each type has advantages and disadvantages. In this study, a new concept is proposed to improve the specifications and applicability of the first type of CNC gantry machine. In the new concept, reciprocal and simultaneous motion of the gantry and worktable is proposed as the gantry machine’s X-axis double motion mechanism. At the beginning of this study, the double motion mechanism is designed based on a rack and pinion system. A new anti-backlash system is proposed to compensate for transmission error and backlash (simultaneously) and for use in the double motion mechanism. The simulation results of the new anti-backlash system are discussed. Due to manufacturing limitations of the rack and pinion systems, a new double motion mechanism based on a ball screw system is proposed. Then, various designs of a new CNC gantry machine are presented. In this improvement process the problem is solved with the new design of a completed CNC gantry machine. The dynamic and static behavior of the final CNC gantry machine design is investigated via modal and static structural analysis using ANSYS software. The gantry’s natural frequency is designed to be 202 Hz in the first vibration mode, making the machine capable of working at higher speeds of up to 11530 rpm, which is suitable not only for rough cutting but also for finishing. The final design of the new CNC gantry machine is updated according to the obtained results. The increase in natural frequency during gantry design modification affects complexity, increasing the weight and manufacturing cost of the gantry. As such, five different gantry designs are selected for comparison. Four parameters, i. e., the first four natural frequencies, total deformation due to mechanical forces, weight and manufacturing cost are considered performance indices. One is selected among five designs mathematically and optimized by MOGA (multi-objective genetic algorithm) in ANSYS software. In the optimization process, the gantry’s natural frequency is maximized, thus minimizing the total gantry weight and deformation against mechanical forces. CNC gantry machine documents for manufacturing are prepared, followed by modeling, casting, machining and assembly. To evaluate and verify the design and analysis, an experimental modal test is performed. The experimental results show less than 11...|$|R
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the wear of piston rings in a {{hydraulic}} radial piston motor. The piston ring has to satisfy increasing demands for reliability and longer service life. It has two contacting surfaces, the face and the flank, and operates under a boundary lubrication state. This {{first part of the}} project aimed to detect and characterise piston ring wear. Measurement by weighing gives an overall value for wear defined as loss of mass. Two-dimensional form and surface roughness measurements show the distribution of wear on the piston ring face in contact with the cylinder bore and the piston ring flank in contact with the piston groove. Three-dimensional analyses, both quantitative and qualitative, allow the wear mechanisms to be identified. The wear of piston rings from an actual hydraulic motor was characterised. As well, rig testing was performed in two different test rig set-ups, one simulating the sliding movement of the piston ring and the other the tilting movement {{at the end of the}} strokes. Wear during the running-in period was investigated, and the findings indicate that the period when this takes place is of short duration. In the long term, mild wear makes the surfaces smoother than they were when new, resulting in a very low wear coefficient. Significant levels of wear were measured on both contacting surfaces of the piston ring. In cases in which the flank exhibits more wear than the face, the wear on the flank can be reduced by proper design of the piston groove. The second part of the project aimed to evaluate use of a textured surface for the cylinder <b>bore</b> <b>counter</b> surface and a coated surface for the piston ring. Three modelling experiments were performed to characterise the friction and wear properties under lean boundary lubrication conditions. Under such conditions, textured surfaces have the advantage of retaining more lubricant and supplying it over a longer time. Stable friction was also a distinctive feature of the textured surface. Use of a coating could also possibly reduce the amount of wear. Though a smooth surface, like a polished one, is hard to beat for a working texture, a coated surface is far ahead of a smooth uncoated one. Different manufactured and commonly used cylinder bore surfaces, including textured ones, were evaluated in the sliding movement test rig. That allowed favourable wear properties, such as lowest wear coefficient, to be determined with the use of a roller burnished surface. A final part of the research involved simulating wear on the piston ring face throughout the entire service life of a hydraulic motor. This allowed us to determine the roles of surface roughness and coating in prolonging service life and achieving acceptable and secure piston ring operation. The model is simple and realistic, but still needs to be refined so as to correspond even better to reality. QC 2010100...|$|R
