40|$|The {{catalytic}} system Mn Na 2 WO 4 SiO 2, {{known for its}} relatively stable performance for oxidative coupling of methane OCM, has been thoroughly investigated in the past. In order to evaluate its catalytic performance, micro fixed bed reactors were used almost exclusively. This study aims {{to answer the question}} of whether this {{catalytic system}} would be applicable on a larger scale using a miniplant fluidized bed quartz glass reactor. Special consideration was given for finding the optimal operating conditions and investigating whether <b>catalyst</b> <b>abrasion</b> and agglomeration could be limiting factors. In this study different compositions of the Mn Na 2 WO 4 SiO 2 catalyst were tested. High sodium content catalysts were difficult to fluidize at the optimal reaction temperature due to severe agglomeration by melting. Low sodium content catalysts showed low selectivity to C 2 hydrocarbons. Catalysts containing intermediate levels of sodium were used for detailed testing as they showed promising performance as well as good fluidizability. The influence of the different reaction parameters on performance was tested, resulting in 19. 4 C 2 yield at 40 C 2 selectivity. Catalysts before and after reaction were characterized regarding composition, crystalline phases, surface morphology and thermal stability. After time on stream, all catalysts exhibited a reduction in specific surface area, changes in Mn valence state Mn amp; 948; 2 amp; 8804; amp; 948; amp; 8804; 3 and changes in morphology due to grain growt...|$|E
40|$|Membrane {{reactors}} {{are often}} {{reported to be}} promising for enhancement of productivity in selective oxidation of hydrocarbons. Herein, the membrane is used as oxidant distributor (e. g. [1 - 3]). This is meaningful because the order of deep oxidation with respect to oxygen is often {{higher than that of}} the desired formation of olefins/oxygenates [4, 5]. This means that oxygen availability influences both, alkane conversion and selectivity to olefins/oxygenates and this in opposite manner. Beside changes in axial oxygen concentration profile, membrane assisted oxidant dosing causes also changes in residence time of the reactants [6]. The possible variation of the feed dosed via the membrane is an additional degree of freedom. The focus {{of this study is to}} evaluate the membrane reactor concept in pilot-plant scale in combination with packed and fluidized catalyst beds (Fig. 1). As model reaction the oxidation of ethane to ethylene (1. 4 % V/γ-Al 2 O 3 catalyst) was selected. The obtained results reveal that both membrane reactors outperform the reference reactors with co-feed reactant supply (fixed-bed reactor - FBR and fluidized bed reactor - FLBR) by improved ethylene selectivity or ethane conversion; although at higher conversion this advantage is only within a few percent. For compensation of the effect of oxygen on alkane conversion it was found to be beneficial to operate the membrane reactors at overall O 2 /C 2 H 6 ratios near 2, i. e. at higher levels than conventional FBRs. The packed-bed membrane reactor (PBMR, with microporous ceramic or macroporous metal membranes) shows its best performance at moderate contact times (W/F = 200 gs/l) and high fractions of membrane dosed feed. Beside better performance it is characterized by smoother axial temperature profiles ("Hot spots" e. g. 51 K (PBMR) vs. 121 K (FBR) at 550 °C, 200 gs/l, O 2 /C 2 H 6 = 1). Radial temperature gradients were typically below 20 K. A crucial point for PBMR operation is diffusion of reactants from the catalyst bed onto the side of oxidant insertion resulting in a loss of reactor performance [7]. For its suppression a minimum transmembrane pressure drop of 0. 5 bar was found to be mandatory. Another drawback of the PBMR is an enhanced probability of soot formation, especially at the reactor inlet, where local oxygen concentration and gas velocity are low. For smoothing temperature gradients especially fluidization of the catalyst bed is very effectively. However, then the catalyst has not only to show a good performance; it has additionally to meet the demands due to fluidization regarding particle size and mechanical stability. Also the bubble size in fluidization has to be kept low to avoid losses of conversion. That is why for the studies on the fluidized-bed membrane reactor (FLBMR with macroporous metal membrane, [8, 9]) two batches of catalyst particles were used with diameters of 0. 4 and 1. 8 mm. The FLBMR was found to reach yields exceeding 30 %. In principal, the FLBMR shows the same tendencies regarding the impact of process parameters. However, due to the thermal homogenization the FLBMR demonstrates a lower sensitivity against parameter variation than FBR, FLBR and PBMR. <b>Catalyst</b> <b>abrasion</b> was < 0. 2 % for operation over several weeks. Comparing the membrane reactors, the FLBMR seems to be the more promising concept to perform exothermic oxidation reactions (see Fig. 2). However, this has to be balanced with lower space time yields and higher efforts on the investment site. Further, the difference to the PBMR is not really high, so that also the PBMR concept can be considered as an attractive alternative for process intensification.

40|$|Major {{objectives}} of the present project are to develop {{a better understanding of}} the roles of the catalyst and the liquefaction solvent in the coal liquefaction process. An open question concerning the role of the catalyst is whether intimate contact between the catalyst and the coal particles is important or required. To answer this question, it had been planned to coat an active catalyst with a porous silica coating which was found to retain catalyst activity while preventing actual contact between catalyst and coal. Consultation with people in DuPont who coat <b>catalysts</b> for increasing <b>abrasion</b> resistance have indicated that only portions of the catalyst are coated by their process (spray drying) and that sections of uncoated catalyst remain. For that reason, it was decided to suspend the catalyst in a basket separated from the coal in the reactor. The basket walls were to be permeable to the liquefaction solvent but not to the coal particles. Several such baskets were constructed of stainless steel with holes which would not permit passage of coal particles larger than 30 mesh. Liquefactions run with the coal of greater than 30 mesh size gave normal conversion of coal to liquid in the absence of catalyst in the basket, but substantially increased conversion when Ni/Mo on alumina catalyst was in the basket. While this result is interesting and suggestive of some kind of mass transfer of soluble material occurring between the catalyst and the coal, it does not eliminate the possibility of breakdown of the coal particle into particle sizes permeable to the basket. Indeed, a small amount of fine coal has been found inside the basket. To determine whether fine coal from breakdown of the coal particles is responsible for the conversion, a new basket is being prepared with 0. 5 {micro}m pore size...|$|R
