In the SCS, basestations are placed randomly according to a two-dimensional Poisson point process. Such a system can model a dense cellular or wireless data network deployment, where the base station locations end up being close to random due to constraints other than optimal coverage. The SCS is a simple cellular system where we can introduce several variations and design scenarios such as shadow fading, power control features, and multiple channel reuse groups, and assess {{their impact on the}} performance. We first derive an analytical expression for the characteristic function of the inverse of the <b>carrier-to-interference</b> <b>ratio.</b> Using this result, we show that the <b>carrier-to-interference</b> <b>ratio</b> is independent of the base station density and further, we derive a semi-analytical expression for the tail-probability.

Next, we incorporate shadow fading into the SCS and demonstrate that it merely scales the base station density by a constant. Hence, the cellular performance of the SCS is independent of shadow fading. These results are further used to analyze dense cellular scenarios...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Power {{control is}} of great {{importance}} in reducing cochannel interference and increasing the capacity of mobile telecommunications systems. The aim of optimum power control procedure is to achieve a maximum <b>Carrier-to-Interference</b> <b>Ratios</b> (CIR) in all active communication links (i. e. CIR balancing). Optimum power control with CIR balancing has been widely studied for Frequency-Division/Time-division Multiple Access (FDMA/TDMA) cellular systems. In these systems, the CIR-balanced optimum power control was transformed to an eigen-value problem using link-gain matrix. The same method was proposed to CDMA systems. However, {{the size of the}} link-gain matrix is proportional to the square of the number of communication links in the system. Thus, the computation of the eigenvalue may be infeasible in CDMA systems with high load. Moreover, optimum power control has never been studied in crossed slots where some mobiles are active in downlink and other in uplink. A simplified optimum power control scheme has been proposed to reduce the link-gain matrix only in the forward link. In this paper, we introduce a simplified generic optimum power control scheme for uplink, downlink and crossed slots. This scheme is based on a link-gain matrix whose size is proportional to the square of the number of cells. Simulation results have justified that the proposed scheme achieves the same upper bound of CIR as the complex scheme. I...|$|R
