We describe STEREO data and data pipeline developed to produce final light curves. We studied long-term variations in the rotational periods of 14 CP stars. With our pipeline, {{we were able to}} accurately determine their periods, and hence we investigated any period changes. The second study concerned Be-stars and looked at the connection between disk structures and non-radial pulsations. STEREO photometric data were supported by spectroscopic information on the Hα line. As a result, we found that, in some cases, variations in emission line properties were connected with changes in pulsation characteristics, and we discussed the consequences of this situation. In the final study, which involved a sample of δ Scuti stars, STEREO data were used to investigate the stars' pulsational properties and to look for any possible changes in their pulsations. Pulsation constants and modes of the main frequencies were identified, and regular spacings in frequencies were examined. Several cases in which pulsational characteristics changed were also determined, and their consequences were interpreted. ...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Although suicide {{rates have}} {{increased}} in some European countries {{in relation to the}} current economic crisis and austerity policies, that trend has not been observed in Spain. This study examines the impact of the economic crisis on suicide attempts, the previously neglected endpoint of the suicidal process, and its relation to unemployment, age and sex. METHODS: The study was carried out in Andalusia, the most populated region of Spain, and which has a high level of unemployment. Information on suicide attempts attended by emergency services was extracted from the Health Emergencies Public Enterprise Information System (SIEPES). Suicide attempts occurring between 2003 and 2012 were included, in order to <b>cover</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> prior to the crisis (2003 - 2007) and five years after its onset (2008 - 2012). Information was retrieved from 24, 380 cases (11, 494 men and 12, 886 women) on sex, age, address, and type of attention provided. Age-adjusted suicide attempt rates were calculated. Excess numbers of attempts from 2008 to 2012 were estimated for each sex using historical trends of the five previous years, through time regression models using negative binomial regression analysis. To assess the association between unemployment and suicide attempts rates, linear regression models with fixed effects were performed. RESULTS: A sharp increase in suicide attempt rates in Andalusia was detected after the onset of the crisis, both in men and in women. Adults aged 35 to 54 years were the most affected in both sexes. Suicide attempt rates were associated with unemployment rates in men, accounting for almost half of the cases during the five initial years of the crisis. Women were also affected during the recession period but this association could not be specifically attributed to unemployment. CONCLUSIONS: This study enhances our understanding of the potential effects of the economic crisis on the rapidly increasing suicide attempt rates in women and men, and the association of unemployment with growing suicidal behaviour in men. Research on the suicide effects of the economic crisis may need to take into account earlier stages of the suicidal process, and that this effect may differ by age and sex...|$|E

The level of the United States technical prepara tion was not adequate to the task at hand, nor were crucial political decisions taken prior to 1961. The impunity with which the Soviet Union could abrogate the moratorium in 1961 demonstrates the danger of dropping one's guard. The experi ence of the negotiations suggests that areas where there is rela tive parity perhaps offer the most promise for arms-control agreements and that more progress might be made if greater emphasis were placed on national control or what has come to be called adversary or reciprocal inspection techniques...|$|R

We have, in this district, twenty-five hundred farmers according to the latest reports of the Bureau of Statistics, and dividing seven hundred and fifty-six dollars and sixty cents by twenty-five hundred, we find that each farmer receives an average of thirty and one-quarter cents per year for allowing his fences and buildings to be smothered in lurid advertising signs.

The results represent a successful, coordinated effort among two state agencies and two federal agencies. Results are reported on two separate investigations. The first investigation looked at the use of line focus concentrating photovoltaics coupled with single-cell electrolyzers to produce gaseous hydrogen. The concept, and its design, construction and operation, are presented. The objectives of the line focusing PV system are to reduce overall system cost under the assumptions that lenses and mirrors are cheaper to deploy than are PV cells, and that low-voltage, high-current dc electricity can efficiently power a single-cell elctrolyzer to produce hydrogen. The second investigation evaluated a base case cost of PV electrolysis hydrogen production based on present-day PV and electrolyzer costs and efficiencies. A second step analyzed the hydrogen costs based on a best prediction of where PV costs and efficiencies will be in 10 years. These results set the minimum cost standards that other renewable production technologies must meet or better...|$|R

This paper provides empirical evidence to the field applying its scientific contribution to the SME’s world, also shedding light on the Italian context, as a representative case of civil-law based coun- tries. We analyzed financial statements and other available data concerning failed Italian SMEs, which went into bankruptcy in 2011, collecting the information from the official databases of the main Italian courts (Milan, Rome and Naples).
