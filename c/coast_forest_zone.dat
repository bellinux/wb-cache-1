40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to clarify}} the factor which generated the difference in evaluation from the relation between a <b>coast</b> <b>forest</b> and an area for the Noshiro seashore erosion control forest in Akita, evaluated by the local resident, and the Shonai seashore erosion control forest in Yamagata, not evaluated by the local resident, although a scale and formation process is almost the same. As a result, in Noshiro, afforestation and management of <b>coast</b> <b>forest</b> are the parts of regional development. As the meaning of regional development has changed from Edo era to present time, the new value of <b>coast</b> <b>forest</b> has added to original value of it. In the north part of Shonai, <b>coast</b> <b>forest</b> is afforested and managed unrelated {{to the state of}} the area, and the south part of Shonai <b>coast</b> <b>forest</b> has been original value from Edo era. Thus, in both part of Shonai, the value of <b>coast</b> <b>forest</b> became unremarkable. These different values of <b>coast</b> <b>forests</b> generated the differences in evaluation...|$|R

Both <b>forest</b> <b>zones</b> are part of the Mixedwood Plains Ecozone. The natural vegetation in the Huron-Ontario Section is dominated by mixed wood forests. It is a transitional type between the southern deciduous forests and the northern coniferous forests. The forest communities of the Niagara Section are dominated by broad-leaved trees. Overall, Halton Hills consists predominantly of agricultural lands with scattered woodlands and wetlands. The woodlands are mainly deciduous forest and the wetlands are either cedar swamp or cattail marsh.|$|R

There are lots of pine trees in Dilijan and on nearby slopes.|$|R

40|$|A {{scheme of}} {{vegetation}} zones for Hokkaido {{has been discussed}} and proposed by several scientists, based on a phytogeographical perspective. Honda（ 1912 ）divided the natural <b>forest</b> <b>zones</b> of Hokkaido into the temperate <b>forest</b> <b>zone</b> and the boreal <b>forest</b> <b>zone.</b> Tatewaki (1958 ） proposed that vegetation zones of Hokkaido were characterized by the so-called intermediate <b>zone</b> （mixed <b>forest</b> zone） formed by coniferous and deciduous tree species. From a phytosociological standpoint, the natural vegetation zones of Hokkaido were divided into four main vegetation regions: e. g. the Saso-Fagion crenatae region, the Carpino-Quercion grosseserratae region, the Piceion jezoensis region and the Vaccinio-Pinion pumilae region （Miyawaki et al 1975, 1988 ）. Thus there are various opinions the distribution and definition of concerning natural <b>forest</b> <b>zones</b> or vegetation zones in Hokkaido, from both phytogeographical or phytosociological standpoints. A revised scheme of vegetation zones in Hokkaido, is here attempted in order to unify these several phytogeographical and phytosociologlcal concepts for vegetation zones. As well, a new proposed vegetation-ecological approach for classification and evaluation of the vegetation regions by means of phytosociological landscape analysis is presented...|$|R
