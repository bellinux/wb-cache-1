40|$|CELL – set of {{commissioned}} illustrations {{were created}} for The Times publication of 16 pages {{of what was}} Stephen King’s new novel at the time. The publication of Cell marked King’s engagement with a new younger audience who frequently communicate by cell (of mobile) phone. As the narrative unfolds, the cell-phone transmits messages destroying brain cells leading to the mass destruction of the population world-wide. The few survivors and their problems of living and communicating become Cell’s key theme. It {{went on to become}} an international best seller. The illustrations were created using a method demonstrated in Williamson’s Catolog (Conningsby Gallery, 2005) with <b>co-exhibitor</b> Martin O’Neill. The method consists of compiling an ongoing archive of found/sourced images and objects from which selections can be made according to the requirements of the commission. These selections form the basis of Williamson’s illustrations before additional artwork. A further aspect of the method is based on William Burrough’s cut-up theory in Third Mind in which two apparently unrelated elements are combined to create an ‘unspoken’ third meaning that favours intuition over reason. A wider context for the application of this approach to graphic art and design was articulated by Jon Wozencroft in The Graphic Language of Neville Brody. The illustrations for Cell were created using the ‘cut-up’ method with archive materials chosen to inflect with the turning points in King’s narrative. The preparation of the illustrations was also informed by a period of travel in America during which Williamson’s archive expanded. Williamson’s methods were discussed in Ian Noble’s Picture Perfect 2003 which examined how illustrators research and create their images. A number of images from Williamson’s American archive appear in Noble’s book and, along with a number of published illustrations appear on Williamson’s website...|$|E

40|$|The use of {{alternative}} photographic practices to address ecological concerns in Liggins’s first REF submission, Barcode Wales, are also present here. Uncertain Terrain: The Garden {{was a series}} of thirty-eight large-scale photographic prints that explored alternative ways of engaging with garden space to engender a greater sense of involvement. The spectator–spectacle view and the aesthetics of the picturesque were rejected {{on the grounds that they}} perpetuate the concept of a world ‘out there’, set against but nonetheless ordered by the human subject. Instead, Liggins used lightweight cameras with plastic, low resolution lenses so that the production of maximum detail would be prevented, and the formality of the image would be lost. This was another articulation of Liggins’s baroque photographic aesthetic: rather than description, there was openness to whatever kind of image might be produced when the disruption, opacity and disorder introduced by the plastic lenses worked with qualities from the gardens. The property of ‘working with’ is key here, since it redefines the photograph from being a window on the world to a surface that reveals the intersection of technology and location. The works were exhibited at the Jaipur Arts Centre, Jaipur, 2013, with <b>co-exhibitor</b> Sarah Tierney, and as a solo show at The Gallery, British Council, New Delhi. A feature article in Culture Colony Quarterly, volume 1, highlighted Liggins’s interest in the capacity of photography to resist its ‘window on the world’ status. Preparatory research was exhibited as part of Unreliable Truths, Glynn Vivian Gallery, Swansea, with an accompanying catalogue, and reviewed in Source journal, issue 57, winter 2008. The project’s methodology was discussed in Land Matters: Landscape Photography, Culture and Identity, edited by Liz Wells (IB Tauris, 2011).

40|$|Killing Time' I {{made this}} {{installation}} of boxes painted in acrylic on cardboard {{in response to}} the death of 58 Chinese refuges in a container truck during a channel crossing where the corpses were found behind a cargo of tomato boxes. This installation included the previously exhibited 'La Radeau', based on Gericault’s 'Wreck of the Medusa', as a backdrop. My involvement in 'Sanctuary' (dedicated to issues of human rights and supported by Amnesty International and Scottish Arts Council) related directly to my consistent concern to explore political themes within the context of aesthetic practice. 'Killing Time', (see catalogue p 64) and a series of paintings under the umbrella title of 'International Waters' all address issues around freedom of movement, globalisation, international borders and global politics, the itinerant refugee and economic migrant. In contrast to utopian visions of a connected and borderless world we find individual movement distinguished by ultra-surveillance and intensive policing. Here geography and landscape emerge as a site of conflict. My installation continues an earlier artistic enquiry opened by Golub and Spero (<b>co-exhibitors)</b> but develops a shift in significance from the collective to the singular. The work challenges the overwhelming predominance of lens media in relation to political subjects, moving away from identity politics based on picturing ‘the other’, towards an interrogation of subjectivity. 'Killing Time' creates an ambiguous space that sidesteps a tendency within the media to default to a dialectical framing. This installation and the 'International Waters' series make formal and spatial references to history painting and the romantic sublime (genres which pre-figured cinematic vision). The work creates another form of immersive experience for the audience who, in viewing the humble painted cardboard crates encounter an empathy with the victims and an intimation of their abjection. <b>Co-exhibitors</b> Louise Bourgeois, Hans Haake, Bill Viol...|$|R

40|$|This solo {{exhibition}} of thirty new works {{was held at}} Ainscough Contemporary Art, London, who produced accompanying catalogue. The directors and selection panel curate {{a relatively small number}} of annual exhibitions of the work of UK artists. Following a joint exhibition with two <b>co-exhibitors</b> in 2004, Healey was invited to have a {{solo exhibition}} in 2005. The outputs extended Healey’s theoretical research on the impact of specific geo-locus on the work of the Colourists and consisted of visual experiments undertaken in coastal regions of Brazil, which were linked to ongoing experiments undertaken on in the West Coast of Scotland. The work produced for this exhibition deepened Healey’s visual research in peripheral and coastal light conditions and enabled him to produce larger scale works based on new experimental depictions. Research undertaken in Brazil facilitated a departure in theme and resonance. The new large scale paintings relied on extensive on-site research and exploration on Iona and the Isle of Colonsay in the Inner Hebrides, an area so remote that little recorded painting is currently accessible as antecedent. The rationale underpinning the project was that new larger scale visual research methods undertaken on shifting light effects in ‘peripheral reaches’, such as the Hebrides could be combined as a cohesive whole with the new paintings of experimental light effects in the more tropical coastal areas of Brazil. Three of these works were subsequently purchased through the agencies of Bourne Fine Art, Edinburgh, for the new headquarters of the Bank of Scotland in Edinburgh, where they are on permanent display...|$|R
40|$|A group show {{in which}} six works by Cumberland were exhibited, which {{continued}} his exploration of the tragicomic and playful use of abstraction through linear and loosely primitive cartoon like paintings of piles of shapes and human limbs. Cumberland’s intention through painting is to satisfy the eye, albeit momentarily, by comically treating the potentially tragic theme of the body as immobile, trapped or limited in its movements and ability. The tragicomic is a subject most specifically associated with theatre. In painting the late works of Rembrandt, Picasso and Philip Guston {{can be said to}} be tragicomic. The six paintings that comprise this output are titled Grand Escape, Grand Escape II, Marlon Brando, Marco Pantani, David Hemmings, and Sir Alan Bates. They were of two sizes – medium (130 x 97 cm) and large (195 x 160 cm), which both relate to a human scale – one slightly smaller than lifesize and the other slightly larger. The work develops Cumberland’s ongoing exploration of gesture, seen for example in a series of drawings shown at Sprüth Magers Gallery in Munich in 2004 (alongside internationally renowned artists such as Carroll Dunham and Robert Crumb), in which gesture was analysed through various techniques such as direct drawing with brush and paint, overhead projection assisted drawing and silk-screen printing. Director Jenni Lomax and curator Bruce Haines of Camden Arts Centre invited Cumberland and six other London based artists to participate in this exhibition. This show was positively reviewed, with full colour reproductions by Adrian Searle in The Guardian and Sarah Kent in Time Out magazine. <b>Co-exhibitors</b> included artists represented by galleries internationally, including London and New York, such as Ian Kaier and Francis Upritchard. Of Cumberland’s work included, one is now exhibited at the Ernst and Young building on London’s Southbank and another was subsequently purchased through a Belgian Gallery which now represents him...|$|R
40|$|My {{laser cut}} designs were {{accepted}} for SURFACE DESIGN TECHNOLOGY AND TRADITION, a jury- selected exhibition {{held in the}} Kulturcenter Huset, Aarhus, Denmark. <b>Co-Exhibitors</b> were international textile designers and artists working in either traditional processes of batik, hand printing and stitch, or in areas of digital technology and technology transfer. My work represented the only example of laser cutting and etching technologies to fashion and interior fabrics in the exhibition and I was also invited to deliver a conference paper on my {{research in this field}} entitled 'New Approaches to the Surface Treatment of Materials : The Application of Laser Cutting and Etching Technologies'. The six one metre by two metre pieces that I exhibited were the result of research into the creation of three dimensional properties by cutting into and layering fabric with different transparent and semi opaque qualities – motifs were cut to cascade and fall out of the surface, revealing new colours and surface qualities underneath, that move with the body or air flow; fabrics that shimmer and create new patterns (moiré) against each other. Depth and dimension were also suggested by illusional geometric designs which in turn, when cut, formed new structures within the surface of the fabrics. The exhibition created both a visual tension and synergy between the two extremes of textile art, and design / research activity, and highlighted the importance of the two communities existing side by side to the benefit of the future development of the textiles discipline. Two of the multi-layered designs were subsequently selected for the Royal Society of Arts, London 'Innovate, Predicate, Fabricate' Exhibition, January 2005, and Avantex, Frankfurt, Germany, 7 th – 9 th June 2005.

40|$|Connotations... is {{a series}} of 42 photo/text works documenting a series of fictional performances. In 2003, after exhibiting Connotations 1 at Tate Modern, I wrote that the work was both a celebration and {{analysis}} of the performance canon, revisiting performances by artists such as Adrian Piper and Dennis Oppenheim. In this, the photo/text works were palimpsests that added new layers of meaning to the original works (Live: Art and Performance; Tate Modern, ISBN 1 - 85437 - 501 - 6). The series engages with Judith Butler’s notion of performativity and the ‘speech act’; that through utterance or the act of reading, an activity is performed. The descriptive texts in this work are written in the past tense/first person and collude with the images to create fictions and myths that come into being when the work is viewed. The works posit a practical answer to theoretical arguments made by Peggy Phelan (Unmarked: The Politics of Performance) that privilege the ‘live’ performance over its representation. Phelan argues that performance cannot be recorded or documented. The photos in Connotations... are staged and suggest that the life of a ‘live’ work is not only in the performance, but in the document (Camilla Jalving, Performative Realism, University of Copenhagen, 2005, ISBN: 9788763500784). Connotations 1 and 2 were shown in solo exhibitions at The Ikon Gallery, Birmingham (2002) and Centre d’art Contemporain, Geneva (2003). Connotations 1 has been shown in its entirety in group shows at Tate Modern and Gertrude Contemporary Art Space, Melbourne. Selected works were shown at The Museum of Contemporary Photography, Chicago; Saachi Gallery, London; Tate Liverpool and Künstmuseum, Lucerne (all 2002 - 5). <b>Co-exhibitors</b> included: Joseph Beuys, Dan Graham, Chris Burden and Marina Abramovic.

40|$|Two linked {{photographic}} projects (exhibited together) {{exploring the}} physical expression of human emotion {{and the capacity}} of photographic media to capture this through facial expressions. These images photographed opera singers consciously performing intense feelings. These two inter-linked projects explore the physical expression of human emotion. Opera Interna focuses on facial expression, whilst First Act also incorporates the physicalisation of emotion elsewhere in the body. The work was inspired by social and scientific research conducted for Alter Ego (output 1). This research, which involved communication with leading face scientists, Paul Ekman and Vikki Bruce, examined how facial expressions may be a direct, unmediated manifestation of subjective feeling, or they may unconsciously be performed to elicit a social effect. This body of photographs was designed to explore these themes by capturing opera singers {{in the process of}} consciously performing intense emotions. This work builds on and visualises Wright’s primary art/science research into the expression of human emotion. These images provide a purely artistic outcome for scientifically based research. Drawing on both painterly and photographic techniques, these digitally manipulated images refer to and then subvert some of the traditions of portraiture. The large, high definition, digitally manipulated images are intended to reveal fine details that would normally be hidden from public view and to expose a human vulnerability behind the public performance of emotion, revealing the singers' unconscious expression of physiological or psychological states that contrast with the emotions they are performing. The work was developed out of close observation and documentation of the expression of emotion in opera conducted during six-week residencies at Welsh National Opera and Opera North. This work has been contextualised by art historian and writer on photography, Simon Watney, and is published alongside his essay in Portfolio Magazine 42, November 2005. The work has been exhibited nationally and internationally, in Korea alongside <b>co-exhibitors</b> Louise Bourgeois, Cindy Sherman, Candida Hofer...|$|R
40|$|This {{collection}} comprises of 10 unique chair constructs {{developed through}} ‘Sustaining Desire, the Chair as Cultural, Ecological and Visual Narrative’ a 2003 AHRB Innovation Award research project lead authored {{by me and}} developed with Professor Ralph Ball (University of the Arts). The ‘chairs’ divide into three generic subgroups (1) Plastic shell stacking chair (BlackStack, GreyStack, Polypropagation, Same Difference and Stack of One) (2) Plastic monobloc garden chair, (PlasticGold and Co-dependent (3) Office chair (24 Star, Starbase and Triple Back). The project investigates how reflective design articulated directly through artefacts may be used rhetorically to bring sustainable issues and a revaluing what we already have into critical focus. Using an experimental method analogous to archaeology, common chair forms metaphorically lost from awareness because of their anonymous ubiquity were, {{in a kind of}} archaeological reverse play, deconstructed to discover why they were overlooked. The resulting inventory of parts formed the basis of speculative modification and reassembly. Speculations were rigorously situated within the examined object’s specific nature and culture. This strategy generated new, highly visible chair constructs embodying clearly validated, authentic visual narratives. The collection was first exhibited at Salone de Mobile, International Furniture Fair, Milan April 2004, In 2005, 3 pieces were exhibited in le design, c’est le design Mouvements Modernes, Paris, 2 pieces alongside 5 of my earlier works in Free Radicals The Hub, Craft and Design Centre (<b>co-exhibitors</b> Freddie Robbins, Neil Cummings, Tom Phillips) and 2 pieces at Royal Academy, London.

40|$|This is a {{new body}} of {{photographic}} work that was shown {{for the first time}} in T/raum 68, a project and exhibition centred on works or propositions for projects that were never realised. <b>Co-exhibitors</b> included Mary Kelly, Jan Hoet and Ewing Wurm. The six photographic pieces were made at Clipstone Colliery in Nottinghamshire and the surrounding area, which has now become a nature reserve. The background to the work includes reference to a commission form Nottinghamshire County Council to make a permanent light installation in one of the disused tunnels in the park and the dialogue leading up to the work being refused due to the persistent lobby from The British Horse Society. The work explores the legacy of the 1987 Miners Strike and the role the controversial Nottinghamshire based breakaway union the UDM played in ending the strike and the closure of most of the nations coal mines, even in Nottinghamshire. Clipstone Colliery is now a deserted post industrial site surrounded by landscaping and leisure resources. One of the key functions of ‘Refusal’ was to draw attention to the complex process of realisation of a public sited work and the way the proposal revealed and highlighted the differences of opinion between the middle class horse lobby and the unemployed miners who championed the project due to the fact that the proposed work was powered by wind power based electricity that would also provide free surplus power for them to use in their new developments. The work is expanded in accompanying comprehensive catalogue of the exhibition. The work is also intended to form the basis for a larger project on mines to be shown in Mons in 2008. This will be a comprehensive project looking at the European legacy of the coal mining industry...|$|R
40|$|Boudicca {{was invited}} to design five outfits for the group {{exhibition}} Skin Tight, curated by Sylvia Chivaratanond and profiling the radical innovations of designers who use clothing garments to probe the cultural construction of embodied identity. <b>Co-exhibitors</b> included Hussain Chalayan, Martin Margiela, Victor and Rolf. Curator Chivaratanond was interested in work exploring “the architecture of the body, the sexualized body and the deconstruction of the body [...] all of which reflect contemporary anxieties and suppositions related to both the body itself and the emotional resonances connected to it. " Five skirts were designed especially for the show, drawing on Broach/Kirby’s longstanding research and exploring {{the movement of the}} silhouette over time in their collections, with particular attention to the concept of corseting/girdling below the waist, an area to which scant attention has been paid before. Five skirt patterns were made up in a single fabric. Each skirt was displayed with a shoe hanging from it, which often echoed the shape of the skirt (for example the bulbous part of the heel was exaggerated to echo the skirt and the form of the buttocks), with the concept of corseting even extended to boots. Each of these pairs was displayed in front of a montage of photographs of the influences they drew on. These ranged from Hans Bellmer and Duchamp to Allen Jones and Helmut Newton, as well as other forms of wrapped bodies, from Edward Muybridge's films to Dorothy Tanning's sculptures. Research involved rigorous attention to detail in styling, in particular exploring through sculptural tailoring skirts that cut sharply under the buttocks, “the provocative sensuality of the under-curve”. Special manikins had to be constructed to work on and display the clothes (as traditional manikins are too flat for such skirts). Zowie Broach and Brian Kirby work as a duo, collaborating on all aspects of the research and creative process. The show toured to New York, included talks and symposia, and resulted in a catalogue featuring a visual essay of Broach’s designs alongside other major international designers([URL]...|$|R

Part of a broader research project exploring relationships between violation, repair and decoration. Dean exhibited three sculptural/site-specific pieces and a video at “Les Merveilles du Monde”, an international group exhibition at the Musee des Beaux Arts, Dunkirk. All works explored relationships between violation, repair and decoration. The sculptures were site-specific in that each involved a table/work surface that informed the piece in different ways, from a 2. 8 m long reproduction Edwardian dining table with French polished mahogany veneer on chipboard (Two-Way Table) to a 4 m long, melamine-topped, three-part shop counter (Counter). Each also involved extensive drilling, filling, colouring in, varnishing, sanding, not necessarily in this order. Each table was maintained as a table, however much of it Dean removed or replaced. Each work originated in a different context, which also informed its development: for example, Two-Way Table was made in a wood-panelled ex-ballroom during “The Greatest Show on Earth” (2003), a group exhibition including Tacita Dean and Douglas Gordon.

White Stealth Look no 1 invokes the modern warrior woman, alluding to the stealth bomber plane, but adding embroidered details to the skirt. Beetle Corset references the native American ghost dancer combined with 1920 s baseball outfits.

40|$|Two related gallery {{installations}} {{dealing with}} notions of cultural authenticity and difference, {{and the politics}} of the art institution space. Group show, Go Between, was based around Alain Badiou’s concept of mediation. The 24 <b>co-exhibitors</b> included Jimmie Durham, The Atlas Group, Bruce McLean. Dawood presented two related installations that interfaced with the space of the museum and other exhibits. ‘Sister Kali’s Soul Temple’ filled the museum’s top floor. Set up as a quasi-nightclub, with vinyl records by black female soul singers displayed alongside turntables and other club paraphernalia, the installation’s centre-piece was a scaled-down version of the statue of the Hindu goddess Kali, from ‘Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom’. Juxtaposing two female deities - Kali, and soul diva, Aretha Franklin –the work linked the appropriation by Hollywood of exotic female archetypes, with the tradition of white pop performers expropriating black soul music, as parallel narratives of exploitation. In 'Lecture in Conversation' Dawood presented audio and slide documentation of a perfomative dialogue that had previously occurred at the Henry Moore Institute, where Dawood played Krishna, alongside curator Peter Lewis as Albert Camus. Both pieces evolved from Dawood’s sustained engagement with two key research themes: notions of cultural authenticity and difference, and the intersection between live performance and installation as ways of opening up the politics of the art institution. Thus, in Sister Kali, gallery invigilators became placed within the work as ‘DJs’ who kept the music playing. Working with a series of collaborators, notably in ongoing dialogue with Bregenz’s curator, Peter Lewis, Dawood’s broader research project produced several staged faux-historical dialogue performance pieces including ‘We Have Met the Enemy and He is Us’, Redux Projects, London, (3. 2. 05 - 25. 2. 05); ‘The Killing of Chief Crazy Horse’ Henry Moore Institute, Leeds, (16. 05. 05 - 29. 05. 05); I.

Piece {{shown at}} Art Historians Annual Conference, University of Ulster, April 12007 The {{production of the}} painting Zone 15 was extensively documented {{as part of a}} research project being carried out at Lancaster University, who commissioned me to produce a digital document to be published in conjunction with the finished painting. This piece of research, through it’s detailed recording of each stage of the thinking and making process, aimed to articulate the usually tacit, unseen, aspects of studio practice and decision-making. The digital piece consisted of two parts, a Flash animation which presented a time-lapse movement through the painting’s growth, from blank canvas to completion, and an interactive screen image of the painting, divided into titled sections with a sequence of pages for each charting aspects of thinking/making, through image and text. The AHRC funded Visual Intelligence project at Lancaster, led by Rebecca Fortnum, set out to question whether the notion of ‘visual intelligence’ could be demonstrated by documenting and evaluating artists’ processes, and to find the optimum methods of recording, asking specifically whether ‘new’ technologies provide useful methods for documenting these processes. My role in the project has also included a seminar presentation, currently being prepared for publication.
