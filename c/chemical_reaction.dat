5|$|An enzyme's name {{is often}} derived from its {{substrate}} or the <b>chemical</b> <b>reaction</b> it catalyzes, {{with the word}} ending in -ase. Examples are lactase, alcohol dehydrogenase and DNA polymerase. Different enzymes that catalyze the same <b>chemical</b> <b>reaction</b> are called isozymes.|$|E
5|$|Enzymes must bind their {{substrates}} {{before they}} can catalyse any <b>chemical</b> <b>reaction.</b> Enzymes are usually very specific as to what substrates they bind and then the <b>chemical</b> <b>reaction</b> catalysed. Specificity is achieved by binding pockets with complementary shape, charge and hydrophilic/hydrophobic characteristics to the substrates. Enzymes can therefore distinguish between very similar substrate molecules to be chemoselective, regioselective and stereospecific.|$|E

25|$|<b>Chemical</b> <b>reactions</b> {{can result}} in the {{formation}} or dissociation of molecules, that is, molecules breaking apart to form two or more smaller molecules, or rearrangement of atoms within or across molecules. <b>Chemical</b> <b>reactions</b> usually involve the making or breaking of chemical bonds.

5|$|Byne's disease, more {{accurately}} known as Bynesian decay, is a peculiar and permanently damaging condition (resulting from an ongoing <b>chemical</b> <b>reaction)</b> which often attacks mollusk shells {{that are in}} storage or on display {{for long periods of}} time.|$|E
5|$|Proteasomes are protein {{complexes}} which degrade unneeded {{or damaged}} proteins by proteolysis, a <b>chemical</b> <b>reaction</b> that breaks peptide bonds. Enzymes that help such reactions are called proteases.|$|E

5000|$|The frozen gas model {{describes}} {{a special case}} of a gas {{that is not in}} equilibrium. The name [...] "frozen gas" [...] can be misleading. A frozen gas is not [...] "frozen" [...] like ice is frozen water. Rather a frozen gas is [...] "frozen" [...] in time (all <b>chemical</b> <b>reactions</b> are assumed to have stopped). <b>Chemical</b> <b>reactions</b> are normally driven by collisions between molecules. If gas pressure is slowly reduced such that <b>chemical</b> <b>reactions</b> can continue then the gas can remain in equilibrium. However, it is possible for gas pressure to be so suddenly reduced that almost all <b>chemical</b> <b>reactions</b> stop. For that situation the gas is considered frozen.|$|R

5|$|Zinc powder is {{sometimes}} {{used as a}} propellant in model rockets. When a compressed mixture of 70% zinc and 30% sulfur powder is ignited there is a violent <b>chemical</b> <b>reaction.</b> This produces zinc sulfide, together with large amounts of hot gas, heat, and light.|$|E

When entering a <b>chemical</b> <b>reaction,</b> the atom loses its two outermost electrons {{and the single}} 5d-electron. The lutetium atom is the smallest among the lanthanide atoms, due to the lanthanide contraction, {{and as a result}} lutetium has the highest density, melting point, and hardness of the lanthanides.|$|E

5|$|In {{a general}} sense, the {{principal}} <b>chemical</b> <b>reaction</b> in bioluminescence involves some light-emitting molecule and an enzyme, generally called the luciferin and the luciferase, respectively. Because these are generic names, the luciferins and luciferases are often distinguished by including the species or group, i.e. Firefly luciferin.

50|$|An {{inert gas}} is a gas {{which does not}} undergo <b>chemical</b> <b>reactions</b> under a set of given conditions. The noble gases often do not react with many substances.

These undesirable <b>chemical</b> <b>reactions</b> are often oxidation and hydrolysis reactions with the oxygen and moisture in air. The term inert gas is context-dependent because several of the noble gases {{can be made to}} react under certain conditions.|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} machine {{learning}} methods {{are used to}} classify <b>chemical</b> <b>reactions.</b> At {{the same time the}} most important changes in molecular structure are identified that are typical for <b>chemical</b> <b>reactions</b> of RNA-binding proteins. In the first part, six basic groups of <b>chemical</b> <b>reactions</b> were used to determine the optimal set of parameters for modeling and prediction. Three groups of parameter sets were tested: methods for balancing the learning set (seven methods), methods for molecular fingerprinting (seven methods) and predictive models (five methods). Empirically is shown that the best combination consists of the following parameters: random undersampling as balancing method, Morgan+MorganBitVector for molecular fingerprinting and random forest as predictive model, with which average AUC 0. 97 was achieved. For the second part, the optimal set of parameters is used to discriminate between <b>chemical</b> <b>reactions</b> associated with RNA-binding proteins and those <b>chemical</b> <b>reactions</b> associated with non RNA-binding proteins. AUC score 0. 77 was achieved...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Biochemical pathways, such as metabolic, regulatory, and signal {{transduction}} pathways, constitute complex networks of functional and physical interactions between molecular {{species in the}} cell. They are represented in a natural way as graphs, with molecules as nodes and processes as arcs. In particular, metabolic pathways are represented as directed graphs, with the substrates, products, and enzymes as nodes and the <b>chemical</b> <b>reactions</b> catalyzed by the enzymes as arcs. In this paper, <b>chemical</b> <b>reactions</b> in a metabolic pathway are described by edge relabeling graph transformation rules, as explicit <b>chemical</b> <b>reactions</b> and also as implicit <b>chemical</b> <b>reactions,</b> in which the substrate chemical graph, together with a minimal set of edge relabeling operations, determines uniquely the product chemical graph. Further, the problem of constructing all pathways that can accomplish a given metabolic function of transforming a substrate chemical graph to a product chemical graph using a set of explicit <b>chemical</b> <b>reactions,</b> is stated as the problem of finding an appropriate set of sequences of chemical graph transformations from the substrate to the product, and {{the design of a}} graph transformation system for the analysis of metabolic pathways is described, which is based on a database of explicit <b>chemical</b> <b>reactions,</b> a database of metabolic pathways, and a chemical graph transformation system. ...|$|R
