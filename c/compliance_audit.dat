25|$|For any Type A {{program which}} are {{considered}} to be a high risk of not complying, the OMB Circular A-133 requires that the auditor to perform a <b>compliance</b> <b>audit</b> on that program. For a Type A program that is considered to be of low risk, then the auditor is not required to perform a <b>compliance</b> <b>audit,</b> although the OMB Circular A-133 allows the auditor to do so if he/she chooses to. Although the risk assessment is performed by the auditor based on his/her judgment, the OMB Circular A-133 does have two requirements for a program to be considered low risk. First, the program must have been audited at least once in the last two years, and second, the program must have no audit findings when it was last audited. If the program does not comply with either of these two requirements, it is automatically considered as high risk.|$|E
25|$|The auditor must {{understand}} the recipient’s internal control system {{to determine if the}} recipient has proper safeguards that help manage federal assistance responsibly. After obtaining sufficient knowledge of that system, the auditor must perform audit procedures to verify the recipient’s internal control system works properly, and the recipient’s federal program operations comply with laws and regulations (e.g., the <b>compliance</b> <b>audit</b> portion of the Single Audit).|$|E
25|$|After {{the auditor}} determines which federal {{programs}} to audit, the auditor performs a <b>compliance</b> <b>audit</b> that scrutinizes {{operations of the}} program—examining files, documents, contracts, checks, etc. The auditor investigates, to some degree, transactions between the federal program and other parties. These functions are compared with the laws and regulations applicable to a program {{to see if they}} complied or not. The examination does not require observing every single document and every single process generated by the program, nevertheless the auditor is required to perform enough procedures to form an opinion on whether the program (as a whole) complied with laws and regulations.|$|E

2500|$|For these reasons, {{the federal}} {{government}} requires auditors to perform the <b>compliance</b> <b>audit</b> of a recipient with a planning stage and an exam stage. During the first stage, or planning stage, the auditor must study the recipient, determine {{whether there is a}} high or low risk that the recipient does not comply with laws and regulations, identify federal programs, and evaluate such programs. The second stage, or exam or audit stage, is where the auditor actually audits the federal assistance and programs. [...] The planning stage is considered {{an integral part of the}} Single Audit because it allows the auditor to design and perform the audit based on the qualities, characteristics and needs of the recipient to be audited.|$|E
2500|$|To {{determine}} which federal programs to audit under the <b>compliance</b> <b>audit,</b> federal assistance expended by the recipient (also called federal expenditures) during one year is identified by federal program name, Federal agency and CFDA number. These federal expenditures are then combined {{to determine the}} total amount expended during the year. Any recipient whose total federal expenditures during a year equal or exceed $500,000 requires a Single Audit [...] If the recipient does not meet this threshold, a Single Audit is not required, although the recipient may elect to have a program-specific audit (an audit of a single federal program, without auditing the entire entity). Once this determination is performed, OMB Circular A-133 requires that federal programs be categorized in two groups: Type A programs and Type B programs.|$|E

[...] An OSHA inspection resulted in 32 per-instance willful citations including locating people in vulnerable buildings among the processing units, failing to correct de-pressurization deficiencies and deficiencies with gas monitors, and failing to prevent the use of non-approved electrical equipment in locations in which hazardous concentrations of flammable gases or vapors may exist. [...] BP was further fined for neglecting to develop shutdown procedures and designate responsibilities and to establish a system to promptly address and resolve recommendations made after an incident when a large feed pump failed three years prior to 2006. [...] Penalties were also issued for five serious violations, including failure to develop operating procedures for a unit that removes sulfur compound; failure to ensure that operating procedures reflect current operating practice in the Isocracker Unit; failure to resolve process hazard analysis recommendations; failure to resolve process safety management <b>compliance</b> <b>audit</b> items in a timely manner; and failure to periodically inspect pressure piping systems.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} use of social <b>compliance</b> <b>audits</b> in the supply chain of {{multinational}} companies (MNCs). Particularly, we explore {{the use of}} such audits in assessing and managing the working conditions of factory workers in the garment industry in a developing nation. Through a range of interviews with MNCs’ internal auditors, with commissioned external auditors and with representatives of the suppliers in Bangladesh, this study finds that social <b>compliance</b> <b>audits</b> become ritual strategies and are not a primary means of advancing workers’ rights. Drawing on the concept of surrogate accountability, the study suggests that to create real change in workers’ conditions and in order to hold MNCs and their suppliers accountable, some form of surrogate (government, NGOs or media) intervention is necessary. This is, we argue, preferable to leaving it in the hands of ‘markets’ and simply waiting for another major incident such as Rana Plaza to stir public concern. This study contributes to the literature by investigating how social <b>compliance</b> <b>audits</b> are undertaken by MNCs sourcing products from a developing nation, what motivations drive the adoption of such audits, and what, if anything, are the likely outcomes from the process...|$|R
