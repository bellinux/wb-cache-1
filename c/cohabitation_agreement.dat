50|$|On 9 February 2015, the SYRIZA-led {{coalition}} Government, {{sworn in}} on 27 January 2015, promised to extend <b>cohabitation</b> <b>agreements</b> to same-sex couples.|$|R
5000|$|In the United States, about 15 million couples {{qualify as}} cohabiting. A <b>cohabitation</b> <b>agreement</b> can give each party {{an idea of}} the {{expectations}} of the relationship with the legal enforceability to protect against financial ruin or the loss of support that was promised. It is a good idea in that if the couple does break up, an altercation about who receives what may be less likely. [...] However, the courts may occasionally change or ignore provisions set out in a <b>cohabitation</b> <b>agreement</b> if they feel that they are inadequate under the circumstances.|$|E
50|$|A <b>cohabitation</b> <b>agreement</b> {{will usually}} not be {{adequate}} to settle all legal issues that might arise, so a trust deed setting out {{property rights and}} a will are also recommended.|$|E

50|$|Greece recognizes {{same-sex}} unions {{by allowing}} same-sex couples {{to enter into}} <b>cohabitation</b> <b>agreements</b> since 24 December 2015.

50|$|Many states {{recognize}} {{through their}} judicial systems <b>cohabitation</b> <b>agreements</b> and common law partner agreements concluded between two {{partners in a}} relationship.These are de facto domestic partnerships that protect both parties and allow for shared property and court recognition of their relationships.|$|R
50|$|Since 1 January 2016, Estonia has {{recognised}} same-sex unions {{by allowing}} same-sex couples {{to sign a}} <b>cohabitation</b> <b>agreement.</b> In addition, following a December 2016 court ruling, same-sex marriages performed abroad are recognised in Estonia.|$|E
50|$|The {{law does}} not require that a couple make a <b>cohabitation</b> <b>agreement</b> or a {{marriage}} agreement when they start to live together or marry. You don't have to sign an agreement like this if you don't want to.|$|E
50|$|Single gay {{or lesbian}} persons may {{petition}} to adopt and same-sex couples are allowed to foster. Same-sex couples can't adopt jointly because the law states that only a couple which are married can do so, and same-sex marriages are currently not recognized in Estonia. However, due to the <b>Cohabitation</b> <b>Agreement</b> Act, couples are allowed to perform step-adoption. It has been put in doubt that it is currently possible to fulfill the prescribed conditions {{due to the fact}} that implementing provisions for the <b>Cohabitation</b> <b>Agreement</b> Act have not yet been adopted; however, in at least one case, a lesbian couple has effectibly been able to obtain a stepchild adoption for their children. Lesbians can use IVF.|$|E
50|$|In November 2014, it was {{announced}} that many major changes to Greece's Family Law would be considered, the most prominent being the extension of <b>cohabitation</b> <b>agreements</b> to same-sex couples.

50|$|On 9 November 2016, the Government {{submitted}} a draft bill equalizing <b>cohabitation</b> <b>agreements</b> with marriages in most areas. The bill {{was approved by}} Parliament on 2 December, in a 201-21 vote. It {{was signed into law}} by President Prokopis Pavlopoulos on 8 December 2016 and took effect upon publication in the government gazette the following day.|$|R
50|$|Cohabitation is {{a common}} type of {{partnership}} in Norway. Cohabitants have some rights if they have joint children, or if they have lived together for five years. Cohabitants can also regulate their relationship through a <b>cohabitation</b> <b>agreement.</b> In Norway, in 2013, 55.2% of children were born outside of marriage.|$|E
50|$|On 7 November 2013, the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) {{ruled in}} Vallianatos and Others v. Greece that {{excluding}} same-sex couples from cohabitation agreements is discriminatory.

50|$|Cohabitation {{agreements}} and marriage agreements {{are not for}} everyone. People who are bringing a lot of property, money, or children into a relationship may want a <b>cohabitation</b> <b>agreement</b> or a marriage agreement.

50|$|On 7 October 2015, a bill {{establishing}} same-sex {{civil unions}} and gender-neutral <b>cohabitation</b> <b>agreements</b> was submitted to Parliament. It had its first {{reading in the}} Senate on 14 October 2015. Although Berlusconi, {{leader of the opposition}} party Forza Italia, declared his support for both the recognition of same-sex couples and stepchild adoption, many MPs from his party criticised or opposed the bill. However, despite having a free vote, Renzi wanted the bill to be approved as soon as possible.|$|R
50|$|<b>Cohabitation</b> <b>agreements</b> and {{marriage}} agreements are for {{couples who are}} just starting a relationship. These sorts of agreements can {{talk about how the}} relationship will be managed (who will pay the bills, will there be a joint bank account or a joint credit card, or who will do what parts of the housework), but most often they talk about what will happen if the relationship ends. These agreements are usually meant to stop a couple from fighting after a relationship ends by setting out who will get what right from the start.|$|R
50|$|On 7 October 2015, Renzi {{introduced}} a bill to Parliament that would establish same-sex civil unions and gender-neutral <b>cohabitation</b> <b>agreements.</b> The bill passed its first reading in the Senate a week later. Although Renzi secured {{the support of his}} Democratic Party and the main opposition Forza Italia party, many MPs from both criticised the bill. Despite the bill being put forward on a free vote, Renzi {{made it clear that he}} would tie the civil unions bill to a vote of confidence in his Government if it did not pass.|$|R
50|$|A <b>cohabitation</b> <b>agreement</b> {{contains}} documentation for {{a couple}} who want to live together {{in order to protect}} themselves from unnecessary cost and litigation should their cohabitation break down. They can clearly regulate their property rights and what arrangements might be made for mutual financial support, dealing with debt, caring for children, etc.|$|E
50|$|Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and {{transgender}} (LGBT) {{persons in}} the former Soviet Union face legal challenges not experienced by non-LGBT residents. Since 1 January 2016, in Estonia, same-sex couples have recognition called a <b>cohabitation</b> <b>agreement</b> that gives the same legal protections available to opposite-sex couples (with the exemption of marriage and Joint adoption).|$|E
50|$|Some gay {{activists have}} been campaigning for legal {{recognition}} of their partnerships. Their campaigning {{for the right to}} take over a partner's tenancy of the family home on bereavement have been gained, regardless of any <b>cohabitation</b> <b>agreement</b> existing, but if a couple share a home their chances of buying the rights are much more limited.|$|E

50|$|On 18 June 2013, the {{opposition}} party Union Monégasque submitted a bill to parliament that would establish gender-neutral <b>cohabitation</b> <b>agreements.</b> The bill was immediately sent to the Women and Family Rights Commission for consideration. In July 2015, the commission's president stated that dialogue on the bill would begin in late 2015. Originally submitted as pacte de vie commune, the bill was amended to establish a contrat de vie commune. The bill's rapporteur, Jean-Louis Grinda, {{who was one of}} the bill's sponsors, submitted his report on 7 September 2016. It was noted that the Monegasque administration already recognises concubinage since 2008, and that the European Court of Human Rights considers non-recognition of same-sex relationships to be contrary to the Convention per Oliari and Others v Italy. On 27 October 2016, the National Council unanimously approved the bill. Now the government has six months to decide whether to proceed with the bill.|$|R

50|$|A <b>cohabitation</b> <b>{{agreement}}</b> {{is a form}} {{of legal}} agreement reached between a couple who have chosen to live together (whether they are heterosexual or homosexual). In some ways, such a couple may be treated like a married couple, such as when applying for a mortgage or working out child support. However, in some other areas, such as property rights, pensions and inheritance, they are treated differently.|$|E
50|$|In Canada, each {{province}} has legislation which {{governs the}} creation of cohabitation agreements. In the Province of Ontario there are restrictions on what can be included in such agreements. For example, clauses requiring chastity are unenforceable. Provisions which pre-determine issues of child custody and access as well as child support may be disregarded by a court As well, in Canada, for a <b>cohabitation</b> <b>agreement</b> to be valid, it must be signed, witnessed, and accompanied by financial disclosure.|$|E
50|$|Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and {{transgender}} (LGBT) {{persons in}} Estonia may face legal challenges not experienced by non-LGBT residents. Both {{male and female}} same-sex sexual activity are legal in Estonia. Since 1 January 2016, same-sex couples have recognition called a <b>cohabitation</b> <b>agreement</b> that gives the same legal protections available to opposite-sex couples (with the exemption of marriage and Joint adoption). It is considered, by most, {{to be the most}} liberal former-Soviet country when it comes to gay rights.|$|E
40|$|Family law is {{succumbing to}} pluralism. Scholars have celebrated this trend as a {{desirable}} {{outcome of the}} struggle for marriage equality. And a pluralistic family law seems to offer distinct benefits: more regimes than just marriage, and greater room for choice within each regime (manifest by more types of legally enforceable intrafamilial contracts). This Article exposes counterintuitive facts that lead to a surprising conclusion: the legal changes that scholars tout as increasing pluralism eviscerate {{the substance of the}} choices families are permitted to make. The policies that appear to extend choice within each regime, in fact, mask what I call a “neoclassical” approach to intrafamilial contracts — that is, an approach that adopts formalist, binary, and proceduralist principles for the creation of legal obligations. As this Article’s scrutiny of prenuptial and <b>cohabitation</b> <b>agreements</b> reveals, neoclassical contract theory is slowly taking over family law. The neoclassical approach vindicates a thin notion of autonomy over other values and favors the status quo. The Article further contends that the roots of family law pluralism in market logic render it fundamentally flawed: as long as the menu of relationship options is predicated on basic contract law, then, regardless of how many options the menu includes, the system will necessarily privilege the more powerful partner. Is it possible to avoid this perverse result while preserving freedom of choice? The Article develops a more robust vision of pluralism by identifying the goals and methods of pluralism in family law as they have developed over time. In doing so, the Article offers foundations of a new theory of pluralism that advances true substantive equality and autonomy...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographic references. This {{research}} {{develops a}} pro-poor prenuptial agreement as an innovative land tenure tool to secure rights in urban subsidized housing. The model tested {{is confined to}} prenuptial agreements under the Marriage Act, but is relevant to other <b>cohabitation</b> or marital <b>agreements</b> {{that could be used}} to secure social tenure arising from intimate relationships. The model aims at securing the tenure of the entire household, in particular the more vulnerable members of the household. The research focuses on urban State -subsidized housing, with an emphasis on the Western Cape, South Africa. This housing is transferred to beneficiaries by registration of individual or co-ownership at the Deeds Registry, with the title deeds public documents. While prenuptial agreements are not usually regarded as a land tenure tool, the fact that they are also public documents registered at the Deeds Office makes them pertinent. A limited dataset of recent academic writing is analysed to identify the social context of household conflict and tenure insecurity, and existing legal template clauses assessed. The prenuptial template design is predicated on current tenure approaches that regard informal practices as equally relevant for the poor's tenure security as the formal law. The template uses various strategies to manage tenure insecurity arising from the death of an owner, disputes, or threatened eviction of dependents. It also aims to ensure that diverse normative beliefs are respected, particularly African normative systems. A personal servitude is used to secure housing tenure as a real right burdening the land, making this a very secure right. In addition the template includes a succession agreement and dispute resolution mechanisms. The template model is tested on clients simulated by re-storying the facts of two seminal Constitutional Court cases and a recent case study of another researcher. Focus groups are held with housing beneficiaries and interviews with housing officials, as a preliminary test of the private and public reception of such agreements. The need for legal aid is discussed. The research makes clear that <b>cohabitation</b> and marital <b>agreements</b> can be used to secure overlapping land rights that the ownership paradigm does not currently protect...|$|R
