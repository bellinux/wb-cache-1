However, the sides remained at odds over the precise details of verification and talks would permanently disband with the departure of President Jimmy Carter in 1981.|$|E

5|$|Eisenhower {{would leave}} office with an {{agreement}} out of reach, as Eisenhower's technical advisors, upon whom he relied heavily, became {{mired in the}} complex technical questions of a test ban, driven {{in part by a}} strong interest among American experts to lower the error rate of seismic test detection technology. Some, including Kistiakowsky, would eventually raise concerns about the ability of inspections and monitors to successfully detect tests. The primary product of negotiations under Eisenhower was the testing moratorium without any enforcement mechanism. Ultimately, the goal of a <b>comprehensive</b> <b>test</b> <b>ban</b> would be abandoned in favor of a partial ban due to questions over seismic detection of underground tests.|$|E
5|$|In early 1960, Eisenhower {{indicated}} {{his support}} for a <b>comprehensive</b> <b>test</b> <b>ban</b> conditional on proper monitoring of underground tests. On 11 February 1960, Wadsworth announced a new US proposal by which only tests deemed verifiable by the Geneva System would be banned, including all atmospheric, underwater, and outer-space tests within detection range. Underground tests measuring more than 4.75 on the Richter scale would also be barred, subject to revision as research on detection continued. Adopting Macmillan's quota compromise, the US proposed each nuclear state be subject to roughly 20 on-site inspections per year (the precise figure based on the frequency of seismic events).|$|E
5|$|Throughout the 1990s, {{progress}} accelerated {{towards a}} <b>comprehensive</b> <b>test</b> <b>ban</b> treaty (CTBT). Following {{a series of}} international meetings on the subject, the UN General Assembly approved resolution 50/64, which appealed for states to follow the PTBT and called for conclusion of the CTBT talks. In September 1996, the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty was signed and superseded the PTBT, though the PTBT is still in effect for states not party to the CTBT. The CTBT has yet to enter into force, as 8 required states have not ratified the treaty, including the US and China. France, Russia, and the UK have ratified the CTBT. The technology for detecting underground tests has significantly improved since the 1950s and 1960s, with monitors detecting tests down to 1 kiloton {{with a high degree}} of confidence.|$|E

40|$|The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) {{has long}} been the {{cornerstone}} of the international effort to retard the spread of nuclear weaponry to additional countries, now appreciated as the greatest post-cold war threat to international peace and security. Under this treaty, the parties also undertook to pursue in good faith additional negotiations leading to further reductions in nuclear weapons-and, in fact, such subsequent bargaining has recently yielded dramatic, far-reaching successes. Professor Koplow, however, argues that in one crucial respect, the United States has been derelict in implementing the obligations of the NPT: Recent American presidents have rigidly refused to participate in negotiations {{that could lead to a}} <b>comprehensive</b> nuclear <b>test</b> <b>ban</b> treaty, abolishing all nuclear explosions everywhere. Although the NPT 2 ̆ 7 s requirement of <b>test</b> <b>ban</b> negotiations is ambiguously stated, a close reading of the legal materials establishes that it was a key ingredient in the basic bargain of the NPT, and that numerous countries consider it a major, unresolved treaty controversy. Professor Koplow contends that this United States refusal to pursue a <b>test</b> <b>ban</b> treaty is not merely unwise strategy, it is a violation of the country 2 ̆ 7 s international law commitments, exposing the United States to legal remedies and undermining both the global nonproliferation regime and the more general campaign to build support for a new world order based upon greater fidelity to the rule of law...|$|R

40|$|Monitoring the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) by seismic means {{will require}} {{identification}} of seismic sources at magnitude levels where industrial explosions (primarily, mining blasts) may comprise a significant {{fraction of the}} total number of events recorded, and may for some countries dominate the seismicity. Thus, data on blasting practice have both political significance for the negotiation of treaties involving seismic monitoring of nuclear tests, and operational applications in terms of establishing monitoring and inspection needs on a mine-by-mine basis. While it is generally accepted that mining explosions contribute to seismicity at lower seismic magnitudes (less than about magnitude 3. 5), the rate of mining seismicity as a function of seismic magnitude is unknown for most countries outside the U. S. This results in a large uncertainty when estimating the task of discriminating nuclear explosions from chemical explosions and earthquakes, by seismic means, under a <b>comprehensive</b> nuclear <b>test</b> <b>ban.</b> This uncertainty directly affects estimates of seismic network enhancements required to achieve treaty verification requirements at magnitudes less than about 3. 5. 24 refs., 64 figs., 11 tabs...|$|R
40|$|Molybdenum- 99 (99 Mo) is {{the most}} {{important}} isotope because its daughter isotope, technetium- 99 m (99 mTc), has been the most widely used medical radioisotope for more than 50 years, accounting for >  80 % of total nuclear diagnostics worldwide. In this review, radiochemical routes for the production of 99 Mo, and the aspects for selecting a suitable process strategy are discussed from the historical viewpoint of 99 Mo technology developments. Most of the industrial-scale 99 Mo processes have been based on the fission of 235 U. Recently, important issues have been raised for the conversion of fission 99 Mo targets from highly enriched uranium to low enriched uranium (LEU). The development of new LEU targets with higher density was requested to compensate for the loss of 99 Mo yield, caused by a significant reduction of 235 U enrichment, from the conversion. As the dramatic increment of intermediate level liquid waste is also expected from the conversion, an effective strategy to reduce the waste generation from the fission 99 Mo production is required. The mitigation of radioxenon emission from medical radioisotope production facilities is discussed in relation with the monitoring of nuclear explosions and <b>comprehensive</b> nuclear <b>test</b> <b>ban.</b> Lastly, the 99 Mo production process paired with the Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute's own LEU target is proposed {{as one of the most}} suitable processes for the LEU target...|$|R

We are collecting and organizing all available seismological, geophysical, topographical, geological, and satellite imagery datasets for the Middle East and North Africa into a digital information system that is quickly accessible via the Internet from Cornell and can be utilized in modeling and display programs. We are focusing recent efforts on the Middle East and North Africa to complement our previous work in Europe and Central Asia. We are locating and digitizing published crustal thickness, depth to basement, and crustal velocity and density structures, primarily as interpreted from seismic refraction and reflection, gravity and drill hole datasets. We have also digitized some gravity maps and key geologic features for the Middle East. All data are being stored in Arc/Info Geographic Information System (GIS), the most widely used full-featured GIs We are also maintaining a comprehensive bibliography of all the relevant references in a computer database. The results of ongoing efforts are essential for a successful global monitoring system, such as the one tested by the GSETT- 3 experiment. These results, for example, will significantly contribute to accurate locations of seismic events, understanding high-frequency wave propagation at regional distances, and better characterization and calibration of seismic events in the region...|$|R

40|$|Abstract North Korea detonated {{its first}} known nuclear device, a moderate-sized {{event in the}} northeastern corner of the Korean Peninsula, on 9 October 2006. A second one, several times more powerful, was set off nearby on 25 May 2009. Both were {{recorded}} at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by a modern broadband (0. 03 – 30 Hz) network of seismographs deployed since 2004 along the Sino–Korean border, and by station MDJ due north of ground zero. Spanning {{a wide range of}} station azimuth (259 °– 11 °), the near-regional (1. 3 °– 3. 3 °) paths are all purely continental and away from continental margins, making the resulting data uniquely suited for assessing the capabilities of an out-country network to verify the compliance by North Korea with a future <b>comprehensive</b> nuclear <b>test</b> <b>ban</b> treaty. The mbLg magnitudes for the 2006 and 2009 nuclear explosions were determined anew, giving 4 : 32 0 : 13 and 4 : 86 0 : 13, respectively. We show that the MS–mbLgmethod correctly differenti-ates these nuclear explosions from natural earthquakes, although the differentiation was not achieved in studies based on published mbLg values. An analysis of the Pg∶Lg ratio, derived from recordings of the two nuclear tests and of four regional earthquakes selected for their comparable magnitudes (4 : 2 ≤ mb ≤ 4 : 8), reveals that the ratios associated with the explosion and earthquake populations showed surpris-ingly little overlap for a broad frequency range of 3 to 11 Hz. In principle,MS–mb {{can also be used to}} correctly identify the nuclear tests as explosions, but the mb measure-ment for such moderate-sized events is not as robust as the mbLg measurement, rendering this traditionally favored method less practical...|$|R
