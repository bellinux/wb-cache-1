40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the current status}} of the IBM Trainable Speech Synthesis System. The system is a state-of-the-art, trainable, unit-selection based concatenative speech synthesiser. The system uses hidden Markov models (HMMs) to provide a phonetic transcription and HMM state alignment of a database of single-speaker continuous-speech training data. The runtime synthesiser uses the HMM state sized segments that result as its basic synthesis units. It determines which segments to concatenate to produce a target sentence using decision trees built from the training data and a dynamic programming search to optimise a perceptually motivated cost function. The synthesiser can operate both in general domain Text-to-Speech mode, and in Phrase <b>Splicing</b> <b>mode</b> to provide higher quality synthesis in limited domains. Systems have been built in at least 10 different languages and over 70 voices. 1...|$|R
40|$|Circular RNAs (circRNAs), an {{abundant}} class of noncoding RNAs in higher eukaryotes, are generated from pre-mRNAs by circularization of adjacent exons. Using {{a set of}} 15 circRNAs, we demonstrated their cell-type-specific expression and circular versus linear processing in mammalian cells. Northern blot analysis combined with RNase H cleavage conclusively proved a circular configuration for two examples, LPAR 1 and HIPK 3. To address the circularization mechanism, we analyzed the sequence requirements using minigenes derived from natural circRNAs. Both canonical splice sites are required for circularization, although they vary in flexibility and potential use of cryptic sites. Surprisingly, we found that no specific circRNA exon sequence is necessary and that potential flanking intron structures can modulate circularization efficiency. In combination with splice inhibitor assays, our results argue that the canonical spliceosomal machinery functions in circRNA biogenesis, constituting an alternative <b>splicing</b> <b>mode...</b>|$|R

We identified the spliceosome <b>component</b> <b>splicing</b> factor (SF) 3 a p 120 as a coactivator specific for human ERα (hERα) activation function- 1 that physically associated with ERα dependent on the phosphorylation state of Ser- 118. SF 3 a p 120 potentiated hERα-mediated RNA splicing, and notably, the potentiation of RNA splicing by SF 3 a p 120 depended on hER Ser- 118 phosphorylation. Thus, our findings suggest a mechanism by which growth factor signaling can regulate gene expression through the modulation of RNA splicing efficiency via phosphorylation of sequence-specific activators, after association between such activators and the spliceosome...|$|R

40|$|As {{the first}} defence for cells to {{counteract}} the toxicity of active oxygen, superoxide dismutase (SOD) {{plays an important role}} in the response of living organisms to stress and cell differentiation. One extracellular Cu-ZnSOD (ecCu-ZnSOD), and two MnSODs, were identified based on the Volvariella volvacea genome sequence. All three genes have complicated alternative <b>splicing</b> <b>modes</b> during transcription; only when the fourth intron is retained can the Vv_Cu-Znsod 1 gene be translated into a protein sequence with SOD functional domains. The expression levels of the three sod genes in the pilei are higher than in the stipe. The Vv_Cu-Znsod 1 and the Vv_Mnsod 2 are co-expressed in different developmental stages of the fruiting body, with the highest level of expression in the pilei of the egg stage, and they show a significant, positive correlation with the efficiency of karyogamy, indicating the potential role of these two genes during karyogamy. The expression of the ecCu-Znsod and two Vv_Mnsod genes showed a significant up-regulated when treated by cold stress for one hour; however, the lack of the intracellular Cu-ZnSOD encoding gene (icCu-Znsod) and the special locus of the ecCu-Znsod gene initiation codon suggested a possible reason for the autolysis phenomenon of V. volvacea in cold conditions...|$|R

40|$|The present paper {{describes}} a novel systematic {{solution to the}} challenging task of realizing photonic crystal fibers (PCFs) with flat chromatic dispersion, low leakage losses, and large mode area, mainly for applications as information carriers in wide-band high speed optical transmission systems. The proposed design strategy {{is based on the}} existence of an artificially-defected air-hole ring in the cladding and on the modulation of the refractive index of the core by assembling additional defected air-holes in the central core region of the fiber. The validation of the proposed design is carried out by adopting an efficient full-vectorial finite element method with perfectly matched layers for accurate characterization of PCFs. The remarkable flat chromatic dispersion as well as the large mode area and the low leakage losses are the main advantages of the proposed PCF structure, making it an ideal candidate for performing wavelength division multiplexing operation in reconfigurable optical transmission systems or as an information delivering platform in high speed optical communication systems. Typical characteristics of the newly proposed PCF are: flattened chromatic dispersion of 6. 3 ± 0. 5 ps/km/nm in the S+C+L telecommunication band, and effective mode area as large as 100 μm 2 in the same wavelength range. We additionally provide numerical data about the performance of the proposed PCF in <b>splicing</b> <b>mode</b> as well as during macrobending operation and we give qualitative information regarding the sensitivity of the proposed transmission platform to structural disorders of the design parameters...|$|R

To investigate the functional markers of the INCENP gene associated with semen quality, the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) g. 19970 A>G and g. 34078 T>G were identified and analyzed. The new splice variant INCENP-TV is characterized by the deletion of exon 12. The g. 19970 A>G in the exonic splicing enhancer (ESE) motif region results in an aberrant splice variant by constructing two minigene expression vectors using the pSPL 3 exon capturing vector and transfecting vectors into MLTC- 1 cells. INCENP-TV was more highly expressed than INCENP-reference in adult bull testes. The g. 34078 T>G located in the binding region of bta-miR- 378 could affect the expression of INCENP, which was verified by luciferase assay.

40|$|Proper gene {{regulation}} {{is vital to}} the health and development of an organism. Determining the relationship between splicing, transcription, and chromatin structure is vital for understanding {{gene regulation}} as a whole. There have been previous studies linking these elements pairwise; however, no evidence exists for a direct link between all three. Recent data shows that <b>splicing</b> <b>components</b> of the U 2 small nuclear ribonucleic protein (snRNP) co-purify with Spt-Ada-Gcn 5 -acetyltransferase (SAGA), a highly conserved transcriptional co-activator and chromatin modifier. We hypothesize that SAGA binds with <b>splicing</b> <b>components</b> through a multi-protein binding surface with certain core components based on preliminary yeast two-hybrid data. Here, we examine the specific binding partners between SAGA and <b>splicing</b> <b>components</b> utilizing the yeast two-hybrid system in spt 7 Δ Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a validation for the preliminary yeast two-hybrid performed, producing recombinant proteins through sequence and ligation-independent cloning (SLIC) and Baculovirus transfections to obtain purified proteins, and co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) to detect specific protein-protein interactions from recombinant proteins. Yeast two-hybrid results reveal that Spt 7 is necessary for the transcription of reporter genes used in this assay. Therefore, this assay cannot validate previous results or detect false positives. Currently, recombinant proteins are being produced to perform co-IPs to test direct protein interactions. The results from these experiments will demonstrate the type of binding between SAGA subunits and splicing factors and provide direct evidence of a link between all three of the elements of gene regulation...|$|R
40|$|The human {{transcription}} {{elongation factor}} CA 150 contains three N-terminal WW domains and six consecutive FF domains. WW and FF domains, versatile modules that mediate protein-protein interactions, {{are found in}} nuclear proteins involved in transcription and splicing. CA 150 interacts with the splicing factor SF 1 and with the phosphorylated C-terminal repeat domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) through its WW and FF domains, respectively. WW and FF domains may, therefore, serve to link transcription and <b>splicing</b> <b>components</b> and {{play a role in}} coupling transcription and splicing in vivo. In the study presented here, we investigated the subcellular localization and association of CA 150 with factors involved in pre-mRNA transcriptional elongation and splicing. Endogenous CA 150 colocalized with nuclear speckles, and this was not affected either by inhibition of cellular transcription or by RNAPII CTD phosphorylation. FF domains are essential for the colocalization to speckles, while WW domains are not required for colocalization. We also performed biochemical assays to understand the role of WW and FF domains in mediating the assembly of transcription and <b>splicing</b> <b>components</b> into higher-order complexes. Transcription and <b>splicing</b> <b>components</b> bound to a region in the amino-terminal part of CA 150 that contains the three WW domains; however, we identified a region of the C-terminal FF domains that was also critical.

30|$|In {{the laser}} system, see Figure  2, the MOPA is {{followed}} by an optical isolator (Thorlabs) and a 99 : 1 fiber splitter, where few mW are separated from the main beam for frequency measurements with the frequency comb {{that is part of}} another payload aboard the TEXUS 54 mission. A second fiber splitter divides the main beam into pump and probe beam for modulation transfer spectroscopy (MTS). The probe beam is connected to a fiber-coupled PPLN wave guide module (NTT Electronics) for second harmonic generation. The pump beam is frequency shifted by 150  MHz using a fiber-coupled AOM (Gooch & Housego) to shift spurious interference between pump and probe beam outside the detection bandwidth of the MTS signal. The frequency-shifted beam is then phase-modulated at ≈ 300  kHz by a fiber-coupled EOM (Jenoptik) and will later also be frequency-doubled by a second SHG module. Taking nominal losses of the <b>components,</b> <b>splice</b> connections and the conversion efficiency of the SHG modules into account, we expect an optical power of 10  mW and 3  mW for the pump and probe beam at 532  nm, respectively, which is sufficient for saturation spectroscopy. The power of the pump beam can be stabilized by using a voltage controlled attenuator (VCA) and a feedback loop (see Figure  2). Several fiber taps are used for power monitoring at various positions in the laser system during flight. The pump and probe beam are finally guided from the laser module to the spectroscopy module by polarization maintaining fibers at 1, 064  nm and mating sleeves connectors.|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{phytohormone}} auxin {{is involved}} {{in a wide range of}} developmental processes and auxin signaling is known to modulate the expression of target genes via two types of transcriptional regulators, namely, Aux/IAA and Auxin Response Factors (ARF). ARFs play a major role in transcriptional activation or repression through direct binding to the promoter of auxin-responsive genes. The present study aims at gaining better insight on distinctive structural and functional features among ARF proteins. Results: Building on the most updated tomato (Solanum lycopersicon) reference genome sequence, a comprehensive set of ARF genes was identified, extending the total number of family members to 22. Upon correction of structural annotation inconsistencies, renaming the tomato ARF family members provided a consensus nomenclature for all ARF genes across plant species. In silico search predicted the presence of putative target site for small interfering RNAs within twelve Sl-ARFs while sequence analysis of the 5 '-leader sequences revealed the presence of potential small uORF regulatory elements. Functional characterization carried out by transactivation assay partitioned tomato ARFs into repressors and activators of auxin-dependent gene transcription. Expression studies identified tomato ARFs potentially involved in the fruit set process. Genome-wide expression profiling using RNA-seq revealed that at least one third of the gene family members display alternative <b>splicing</b> <b>mode</b> of regulation during the flower to fruit transition. Moreover, the regulation of several tomato ARF genes by both ethylene and auxin, suggests their potential contribution to the convergence mechanism between the signaling pathways of these two hormones. Conclusion: All together, the data bring new insight on the complexity of the expression control of Sl-ARF genes at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels supporting the hypothesis that these transcriptional mediators might represent one of the main components that enable auxin to regulate a wide range of physiological processes in a highly specific and coordinated manner...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of erbium-doped optical fibre amplifiers with gain {{in excess of}} 40 dB and a bandwidth exceeding 40 nm has revolutionised optical communications systems planning. When combined with {{the wide range of}} fibre components now available (couplers, isolators, filters, modulators, gratings), this simple component can also form the basis of complex, functional, all-fibre circuits which are robust, stable and potentially inexpensive. Of particular interest is the relative ease with which femtosecond pulses at a wavelength of 1. 55 µm can be generated using nothing {{more than a handful of}} fibre <b>components</b> <b>spliced</b> together to form one of many possible integrated laser-resonator configurations. The power of the fibre environment for short-pulse generation lies in its tight mode confinement which, together with the long interaction lengths, leads to numerous non-linear effects at average powers of only a few mW, eg self-phase-modulation, cross-phase-modulation and Raman self-scattering. These effects can readily be used for passive mode-locking, pulse switching, shaping and compression. Most significant however is the natural tendency of the fibre to sustain transform-limited soliton pulses. The fibre prefers pulses (solitons) which propagate stably without broadening owing to an artful balance between non-linear and dispersive effects. For this reason, future ultra-high bit-rate telecommunications systems are likely to use soliton pulses to overcome dispersion problems. We review here short-pulse generation in fibre circuits, considering the applications, characteristics and potential of each device. Both passively and actively mode-locked fibre lasers are discussed, together with soliton switching, amplification and compression. We conclude with a discussion of a new all-fibre-based technique for the generation of ultra-high repetition rate (> 50 GHz) soliton pulse stream...|$|R

40|$|Background information. Germination is a well-characterized {{process in}} which embryo cells of seeds {{experience}} a programmed transition from quiescence to proliferation. For this reason they constitute a very good system to analyse nuclear evolution from a dehydrated practically inactive state until the steady state of proliferation. We analysed the temporal and spatial organization of transcription and splicing factors in nuclei of tomato radicle cells during germination. To address this issue we performed in situ immunodetection of several markers of these processes: the Z-DNA stretches forming behind the active RNA polymerases, the splicing proteins U 2 B" and Sm, and the trimethyl guanosin cap of small nuclear RNA. The concomitant structural changes of the different nuclear compartments were studied in meristematic nuclei by electron microscopy and high-resolution cytochemistry for DNA and ribonucleoproteins. Results. In quiescent cells practically no Z-DNA stretches were detected and <b>splicing</b> <b>components</b> localized mainly {{to one or two}} Cajal bodies associated to the nucleolus. In early germination, a massive de-condensation of chromatin and nucleolar Z-DNA conformation stretches were first detected, followed by the relocation of scarce <b>splicing</b> <b>components</b> to the small interchromatin spaces. Nucleoplasmic Z-DNA stretches were not detected until 4 h of imbibition and were accompanied by an important increase of <b>splicing</b> <b>components</b> in this nuclear domain. Soon after the post-germination stage, transcription and splicing topology and nuclear organization in meristematic nuclei resemble those in steady state growing tomato roots. Conclusions. Our results demonstrate that, in tomato, dormant nuclei splicing factors are stored in nucleolar Cajal bodies.

Pathological bone formation associated with AS is an important cause of disability. The aim {{of the study was to}} investigate the possible involvement of the genes related to endochondral ossification and ectopia ossification in genetic susceptibility to AS in a Chinese Han population. Methods: Sixty-eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 13 genes were genotyped in discovery cohorts including 300 AS patients and 180 healthy controls. The rs 10019009 in dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP 1) gene shown as association with AS after multiple testing corrections in discovery cohorts was replicated in a validation independent cohort of 620 AS patients and 683 healthy controls. The rs 10019009 was assessed with bioinformatics including phylogenetic context, F-SNP and FastSNP functional predictions, secondary structure prediction, and molecular modeling. We performed a functional analysis of rs 10019009 via reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity in human osteosarcoma U 2 OS cells. Results: Interestingly, the SNP rs 10019009 was associated with AS in both the discovery cohort (P = 0. 0012) and validation cohort (P = 0. 0349), as well as overall (P = 0. 0004) in genetic case-control association analysis. After a multivariate logistic regression analysis, the effect of this genetic variant was observed to be independent of linkage disequilibrium. Via bioinformatics analysis, it was found that the amino acid change of the rs 10019009 led to changes of SNP function, secondary structure, tertiary conformation, and <b>splice</b> <b>mode.</b> Finally, functional analysis of rs 10019009 in U 2 OS cells demonstrated that the risk T allele of the rs 10019009 increased enzymatic activity of ALP, compared to that of the nonrisk allele (P = 0. 0080). Conclusions: These results suggested that the DMP 1 gene seems to be involved in genetic predisposition to AS, which may contribute to the ectopic mineralization or ossification in AS. In addition, DMP 1 gene may be a promising intervention target for AS in the future...|$|R
40|$|We {{proposed}} an hypothetical model for sex determination in Aedes that is presented here. In this model we hypothesized {{the existence of}} two different upstream regulators that we named SR-M and SR-F (SR is for Splicing Regulator, not necessarily an SR protein). In males a male-determining factor inhibits the SR-F protein required for the female-specific splicing of exon 5 b and activates the SR-M protein required for the male-specific repression of exon 5 a. It is also conceivable that the M could directly control the splicing of exon 5 a. In any case, the result are the skipping of both female-specific dsx exons, with {{the production of a}} male-specific dsx isoform, and the default splicing of P 1 exon, with the production of the male-specific fru isoform. In females the absence of the M leads to the default splicing of female-specific exons 5 a and to the activation of the SR-F factor which in turn regulates the female-specific splicing of exon 5 b. As a result two different female-specific DSX proteins are produced. However is still to be cleared how the repression of exon 5 a is achieved in some but not all dsx female transcripts. The activation of the SR-F factor again in turn regulates the female-specific splicing of fru P 1 exon and as a result the male-specific FRU protein is not produced. Hence we present a model with two different default <b>splicing</b> <b>mode</b> for dsx and fru gene and this is most probably the first case in the species studied till now. This could be better explained if we suppose that M factor is able to act directly on dsx gene but not on fru gene in males, due to the different binding sites we have identified (Nasonia dsxRE and dsxRE). In the next future we will focus our attention on identification of the upstream regulators and their functional analysis to confirm or not our speculative hypotheses...|$|R

40|$|The {{transformer}} gene in the Medfly Ceratitis capitata (Cctra ep) is {{the founding}} member {{of a family of}} conserved Serine Argi- nine-rich (RS) splicing factor encoding genes that act as master epigenetic ON/OFF switches in sex determination in insects as distantly related as dipterans and hymenopterans. A functional TRA protein is produced only in individuals with a female karyotype where it is required to establish and maintain the female fate during development through a positive feedback loop (Cctra ep ON). When zygotic activation of this loop is prevented (Cctra ep OFF), male development follows. This epigenetic self regulatory mechanism is based on alternative splicing analogous to the one operating in Drosophila melanogaster {{at the level of the}} gene, Sex-lethal (Sxl). In Drosophila XX individuals the splicing regulator Sxl is able to positively autoregulate (ON) and to direct and maintain female-specific splicing of transformer (ON). TRA together with its co-regulator transformer- 2 in turn promotes female-specific splicing of the target genes doublesex and fruitless. Likewise, CcTRA and CcTRA- 2 are required for female-specific splicing of dsx and fru in Ceratitis. Both target genes contain putative tra/tra- 2 binding sites (13 nt long repeats) which were first identified in the corresponding targets of Drosophila. tra ep orthologs isolated in other insects seem to act as binary switches that govern all aspects of sexual development. Like Cctra, the feminizing activity of these orthologs rely on a self-regulatory function which maintains the productive female <b>splicing</b> <b>mode.</b> In Musca it was shown that maternal provision of TRA is required to activate the female promoting tra feedback loop in the zygote. tra/tra- 2 regulatory elements are present and highly conserved in sequence and distribution in Ceratitis, Musca and all of the dipteran tra orthologs. Surprisingly, tra ortho- logs appear to be absent in the lower dipterans Aedes aegypti and Anopheles gambiae, eventhough the tra targets dsx and fru are present and sex-specifically expressed. We will discuss how understanding the molecular basis of these regulatory mechanisms will help to design new genetic strategies for pest control management of the Medfly and other insects of economical and medical relevance...|$|R
40|$|The cytoplasmic Ca 2 + {{concentration}} plays {{a central}} role in the contraction of smooth muscle cells. The concentration of cytoplasmic Ca 2 + is determined for an important part by the operation of Ca(2 +) -transport ATPases which extrude Ca 2 + from the cell or accumulate the ion in the endoplasmic reticulum. The present work concerns the characterization of the Ca(2 +) -transport ATPases of smooth muscle by biochemical, immunochemical and recombinant DNA techniques. This study also includes the investigation of the regulation of the Ca(2 +) -transport ATPases and of the expression of associated Ca(2 +) -binding proteins. Methods were developed for the purification of endoplasmic reticulum and plasma membranes from smooth-muscle cells. From the study of the phosphorylated transport intermediates and the proteolytic breakdown products, and by using polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies we could conclude that two different Ca(2 +) -transport ATPases are expressed in smooth-muscle cells. Of each of these types of Ca(2 +) -transport ATPases different isoforms exist. These isoforms were further characterized at the cDNA level and by generating isoform-specific antibodies. One isoform of the plasma-membrane Ca(2 +) -pump and two different organellar-type Ca(2 +) -pumps have been cloned and sequenced. In smooth-muscle cells, the primary RNA transcripts of the gene of the SERCA 2 Ca(2 +) -transport ATPase are alternatively processed in three different ways. In neural tissues even a fourth <b>mode</b> of <b>splicing</b> occurs. These different <b>splice</b> <b>modes</b> can be explained by the analysis of the exon/intron structure of the SERCA 2 gene. The regulation of the alternative RNA splicing was studied on the stable muscle-cell line BC 3 H 1 during induced myogenic differentiation. From this study we could conclude that the mechanisms responsible for active Ca(2 +) -transport in smooth-muscle cells partially resemble those of non-muscle cells, and partially resemble the corresponding system in cardiac cells, but not those in skeletal muscle. A similar conclusion was reached concerning the regulation of the Ca(2 +) -transport ATPase of the endoplasmic reticulum via the phosphorylation of phospholamban, and for the expression of the Ca(2 +) -binding protein calsequestrin.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} a novel method for low-loss splicing small-core photonic crystal fibers (PCFs) and single-mode fibers (SMFs) by repeated arc discharges using a conventional fusion <b>splicer.</b> An optimum <b>mode</b> field match at the interface of PCF-SMF and an adiabatic mode field {{variation in the}} longitudinal direction of the small-core PCF {{can be achieved by}} repeated arc discharges applied over the splicing joint to gradually collapse the air holes of the small-core PCF. This method is simple and offers a practical solution for light coupling between small-core PCFs and SMFs. Department of Electrical EngineeringAuthor name used in this publication: M. S.

40|$|We deal {{here with}} the {{computational}} capacity of DNA when splicing it, by means of restriction enzymes and ligases. We introduce a new distributed structure of a computing system (we call it two-level H system), with each <b>component</b> working by <b>splicing</b> (according to internal splicing rules) and communicating, also by splicing, according to external splicing rules. This architecture is proven to be computationally universal, systems with three components characterize the recursively enumerable languages. The possibility of designing universal DNA computers based on splicing is inferred on this basis...|$|R
40|$|Digital imaging {{microscopy}} {{has been}} used to visualize the splicing protein PRP 6 p and three other yeast nuclear proteins. The results show that PRP 6 p is uniquely localized to discrete subnuclear regions. A combination of cytological and biochemical assays suggests that these sites can be saturated when the protein is overexpressed and likely correspond to the location of U 4 /U 6 snRNPs. The observations indicate that some <b>splicing</b> <b>components</b> are located in discrete subregions of the yeast nucleus, similar to the situation described for the mammalian nucleus...|$|R
40|$|Tumor-associated {{alterations}} in RNA splicing result either from mutations in splicing-regulatory elements or changes in <b>components</b> of the <b>splicing</b> machinery. This review summarizes our current {{understanding of the}} role of splicing-factor {{alterations in}} human cancers. We describe splicing-factor alterations detected in human tumors and the resulting changes in splicing, highlighting cell-type-specific similarities and differences. We review the mechanisms of splicing-factor regulation in normal and cancer cells. Finally, we summarize recent efforts to develop novel cancer therapies, based on targeting either the oncogenic splicing events or their upstream splicing regulators...|$|R
50|$|The U4 snRNA {{secondary}} structure is suggested to alter depending on its {{interaction with the}} U6 snRNA. Several experiments involving X-ray crystallography, NMR, and chemical modification RNA structure probing indicate that U4 snRNA {{secondary structure}} contains several conserved motifs, which serve structural as well as intermediary roles in establishing interactions with other <b>splicing</b> <b>components.</b> The putative U4/U6 snRNA base pairing secondary structure shown in Figure 2., is conserved across a diverse set of organisms suggesting the splicing machinery's ancient origins. It has been shown previously that a highly conserved Kinked-loop participates in specific protein interactions.|$|R
