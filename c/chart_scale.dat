Aims: To assess the correlation between skin color evaluation done by a skin color <b>scale</b> <b>chart</b> (Felix von Luschan skin color chart) and a narrowband reflectance spectrophotometer (Mexameter MX 18). Materials and Methods: The participants were evaluated for skin color by using the Felix von Luschan skin color chart (range 1 - 36) and a narrowband reflectance spectrophotometer (Mexameter MX 18) in which the results of the measurements were expressed as Erythema (E) and Melanin (M) indices. Skin color was measured on four different anatomical skin sites from each participant on the medial aspect of the volar and the dorsal regions of both forearms. Results: A total of 208 records from 52 participants were established. The majority of participants (19. 2 %) were rated with the skin color scale at the number 16 (range 14 - 33). The mean M plus E, M, and E indices were 498. 9 ± 143. 9, 230. 4 ± 74. 4, and 268. 5 ± 73. 2, respectively.
