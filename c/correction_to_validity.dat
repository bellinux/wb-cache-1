Rather, following the analysis the Hainz and Grabert, we expand the centrifugal term perturbatively (in powers of ħ), decomposing it into 2 terms [...] the classical centrifugal potential and a quantum <b>correction.</b> <b>To</b> test the <b>validity</b> of our formalism, we apply it explicitly to study the energy spectrum of certain physically relevant, radially confined quantum mechanical systems, viz., the 3 -dimensional harmonic oscillator, the hydrogen atom, and the Hulthen potential. As observed by Hainz and Grabert, this approach gives better estimates than the conventional WKB approximation technique (based on Langer modification), even for spatially confined systems...|$|R
40|$|In {{combination}} with the perfectly matched layer (PML) -paradigm, eigenmode expansion techniques have become increasingly important in the analysis and design of cylindrical and planar waveguides for photonics applications. To achieve high accuracy, these techniques rely on the determination of many modes of the modal spectrum of the waveguide under consideration. In this paper, {{we focus on the}} efficient computation of TM- and TE-polarized leaky modes for multilayered cylindrical waveguides. First, quasi-static estimates are derived for the propagation constants of these modes. Second, these estimates are used as a starting point in an advanced Newton iteration scheme after they have been subjected to an adaptive linear error <b>correction.</b> <b>To</b> prove the <b>validity</b> of the computation technique, it is applied to technologically important cases: vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers and a monomode fiber...|$|R
40|$|For many {{plasma physics}} problems, {{three-dimensional}} and kinetic effects are very important. However, such simulations are very computationally intensive. Fortunately, {{there is a}} class of problems {{for which there is}} nearly azimuthal symmetry and the dominant three-dimensional physics is captured by the inclusion of only a few azimuthal harmonics. Recently, it was proposed [A. Lifschitz et al., J. Comp. Phys. 228 (5) (2009) 1803 - 1814] to model one such problem, laser wakefield acceleration, by expanding the fields and currents in azimuthal harmonics and truncating the expansion after only the first harmonic. The complex amplitudes of the fundamental and first harmonic for the fields were solved on an r-z grid and a procedure for calculating the complex current amplitudes for each particle based on its motion in Cartesian geometry was presented using a Marder's <b>correction</b> <b>to</b> maintain the <b>validity</b> of Gauss's law. In this paper, we describe an implementation of this algorithm into OSIRIS using a rigorous charge conserving current deposition method <b>to</b> maintain the <b>validity</b> of Gauss's law. We show that this algorithm is a hybrid method which uses a particles-in-cell description in r-z and a gridless description in ϕ. We include the ability to keep an arbitrary number of harmonics and higher order particle shapes. Examples, for laser wakefield acceleration, plasma wakefield acceleration, and beam loading are also presented and directions for future work are discussed...|$|R
