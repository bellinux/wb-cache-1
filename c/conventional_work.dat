25|$|After {{returning}} to London in 1835, {{and using a}} small legacy to purchase a house in Marylebone, Palmer produced less mystical and more <b>conventional</b> <b>work.</b> Part of his reason in {{returning to}} London was to sell his work and earn money from private teaching. He had better health on his return to London, and was by then married to Hannah, daughter of the painter John Linnell who he had known {{since she was a}} child, and married when she was nineteen and he was thirty-two. He sketched in Devonshire and Wales around this time. His peaceful vision of rural England had been disillusioned by the violent rural discontent of the early 1830s. His small financial legacy was running out and he decided to produce work more in line with public taste if he was to earn an income for himself and his wife. He was following the advice of his father-in-law. Linnell, who had earlier shown remarkable understanding of the uniqueness of William Blake's genius, was not as generous with his son-in-law, towards whom his attitude was authoritarian and often harsh.|$|E

2500|$|There are two {{standard}} {{types of}} trousers, type A and type C. Type A protects only {{the front of}} the legs, and can be supplied as chaps, worn over <b>conventional</b> <b>work</b> clothes, or as conventional trousers. Type C gives protection all around the legs and are almost always worn as ordinary trousers, not over another garment. Chaps are generally used for occasional, farm or homeowner applications. Professional chainsaw operators would choose trousers for comfort and ease of movement, with fallers, ground workers and firewood cutters opting for class A trousers because of the low risk of being cut {{in the back of the}} leg. Climbers and tree surgeons would have to wear type C, as they will be cutting from a wider variety of positions. Type C trousers are, of course, highly insulating, and may lead to heat stress if worn for labour-intensive operations such as firewood cutting.|$|E
40|$|Cognitive load {{theory was}} used to {{generate}} {{a series of three}} experiments to investigate the effects of various worked example formats on learning orthographic projection. Experiments 1 and 2 investigated the benefits of presenting problems, <b>conventional</b> <b>worked</b> examples incorporating the final 2 -D and 3 -D representations only, and modified worked examples with several intermediate stages of rotation between the 2 -D and 3 -D representations. Modified worked examples proved superior to <b>conventional</b> <b>worked</b> examples without intermediate stages while <b>conventional</b> <b>worked</b> examples were, in turn, superior to problems. Experiment 3 investigated the consequences of varying the number and location of intermediate stages in the rotation trajectory and found three stages to be superior to one. A single intermediate stage was superior when nearer the 2 -D than the 3 -D end of the trajectory. It was concluded that (a) orthographic projection is learned best using worked examples with several intermediate stages and that (b) a linear relation between angle of rotation and problem difficulty did not hold for orthographic projection material. Cognitive load theory could be used to suggest the ideal location of the intermediate stages...|$|R

2500|$|Foucault's {{secondary}} thesis (his thèse complémentaire {{written in}} Hamburg between 1959 and 1960) was a translation and commentary on German philosopher Immanuel Kant's 1798 work Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View (the {{title of his}} thesis was [...] "Introduction à lAnthropologie", [...] "Introduction to Kant's Anthropology"). Largely consisting of Foucault's discussion of textual dating—an [...] "archaeology of the Kantian text"—he rounded off the thesis with an evocation of Nietzsche, his biggest philosophical influence. This work's rapporteur was his old tutor and then director of the ENS, Hyppolite, who was well acquainted with German philosophy. After both theses were championed and reviewed, he underwent his public defense, the soutenance de thèse, on 20 May 1961. The academics responsible for reviewing his work {{were concerned about the}} unconventional nature of his major thesis; reviewer Henri Gouhier noted {{that it was not a}} <b>conventional</b> <b>work</b> of history, making sweeping generalisations without sufficient particular argument, and that Foucault clearly [...] "thinks in allegories". They all agreed however that the overall project was of merit, awarding Foucault his doctorate [...] "despite reservations".|$|E

Again, if our {{artisans}} {{were likely}} to attain any distinguished skill in ornamental design, it would be incumbent upon me to make my class here accurately acquainted {{with the principles of}} earth and metal work, and to accustom them to take pleasure in conventional arrangements of colour and form. I hope, indeed, to do this, so far as to enable them to discern the real merit of many styles of art which are at present neglected; and, above all, to read the minds of semi-barbaric nations in the only language by which their feelings were capable of expression; and those members of my class whose temper inclines them to take pleasure in the interpretation of mythic symbols, will not probably be induced to quit the profound fields of investigation which early art, examined carefully, will open to them, and which belong to it alone: for this is a general law, that supposing the intellect of the workman the same, the more imitatively complete his art, the less he will mean by it; and the ruder the symbol, the deeper is its intention. Nevertheless, when I have once sufficiently pointed out the nature and value of this <b>conventional</b> <b>work,</b> and vindicated it from the contempt with which it is too generally regarded, I shall leave the student to his own pleasure in its pursuit; and even, so far as I may, discourage all admiration founded on quaintness or peculiarity of style; and repress any other modes of feeling which are likely to lead rather to fastidious collection of curiosities, than to the intelligent appreciation of work which, being executed in compliance with constant laws of right, cannot be singular, and must be distinguished only by excellence in what is always desirable.|$|E

30|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} an enhanced relay beamforming design for two-way relay networks (TWRN). In {{order to reduce}} the computational complexity, we derive a sum of the inverse of the signal-to-noise ratio (SI-SNR) problem equivalent to the objective sum-rate (SR) problem. The SI-SNR problem can be reformulated as a simple optimization problem by using the Cholesky decomposition and Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, and solved by the interior-point method. The numerical results show that the proposed SI-SNR method can not only reduce the computational complexity but also have the same SR performance as that of the <b>conventional</b> <b>works.</b>|$|R
