5000|$|There are {{important}} {{differences between the}} processing of small molecule organic semiconductors and semiconducting polymers. Small molecule semiconductors are quite often insoluble and typically require deposition via vacuum sublimation. While usually thin films of soluble conjugated polymers. Devices based on conductive polymers can be prepared by solution processing methods. Both solution processing and vacuum based methods produce amorphous and polycrystalline films with variable degree of disorder. [...] "Wet" [...] <b>coating</b> <b>techniques</b> require polymers to be dissolved in a volatile solvent, filtered and deposited onto a substrate. Common examples of solvent-based <b>coating</b> <b>techniques</b> include drop casting, spin-coating, doctor-blading, inkjet printing and screen printing. Spin-coating is a widely used technique for small area thin film production. It {{may result in a}} high degree of material loss. The doctor-blade technique results in a minimal material loss and was primarily developed for large area thin film production. Vacuum based thermal deposition of small molecules requires evaporation of molecules from a hot source. The molecules are then transported through vacuum onto a substrate. The process of condensing these molecules on the substrate surface results in thin film formation. Wet <b>coating</b> <b>techniques</b> can in some cases be applied to small molecules depending on their solubility.|$|E
50|$|Powder coating {{on glass}} {{is used in}} {{industries}} such as cosmetics, fragrances, wine and spirits, where the contents inside of the glass containers require protection from ultraviolet (UV) rays, particularly UVA electromagnetic radiation, which is capable of penetrating glass. When applied with a dual-coat method, powder <b>coating</b> <b>techniques</b> on glass provide an opaque shield against the light's effects.|$|E
50|$|Wear and {{corrosion}} resistant surfaces are desirable {{on the outer}} diameter of the piston rod. The surfaces are often applied using <b>coating</b> <b>techniques</b> such as Chrome (Nickel) Plating, Lunac 2+ duplex, Laser Cladding, PTA welding and Thermal Spraying. These coatings can be finished to the desirable surface roughness (Ra, Rz) where the seals give optimum performance. All these coating methods have their specific advantages and disadvantages. It {{is for this reason}} that coating experts play a crucial role in selecting the optimum surface treatment procedure for protecting Hydraulic Cylinders.|$|E

Various processing parameters of the sol-gel spin <b>coating</b> <b>technique</b> including post-annealing temperature, post-annealing environment, spinning speed, and aluminium (Al) molar concentration were explored in this research. The effects of the stated parameters on the surface morphology, structural, optical, and electrical properties of ZnO thin films were characterized using characterization tools namely atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffractometer (XRD), ultraviolet-visible (UV-VIS) spectroscopy, and Hall Effect measurement system...|$|R

40|$|In this work, ZnO {{thin films}} were derived by sol-gel using two {{different}} techniques; dip coating and spin <b>coating</b> <b>technique.</b> The films were deposited onto glass substrate {{at room temperature}} using sol-gel composed from zinc acetate dehydrate, monoethanolamine, isopropanole, and de-ionized water, the films were preheated at 225 ?C for 15 min. The crystallographic structures of ZnO films were investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD); the result shows that the good film was prepared at dip <b>coating</b> <b>technique,</b> it was polycrystalline and highly c-orientation along (002) plane, the lattice constant ratio (c/a) was calculated at (002), it was about 1. 56. The structure of thin films, prepared by spin <b>coating</b> <b>technique,</b> was amorphous with low intensity and wide peaks. The optical properties of the prepared film were studied using UV-VIS spectrophotometer with the range 190 - 850 nm, and by using the fluorescence spectrometer. The optical characterization of ZnO thin films that were prepared by the dip coating method have good transmittance of about 92 % in the visible region, it can be noted from the fluorescence spectrometer two broad visible emission bands centered at 380 nm and 430 nm. The optical energy gaps for the direct and indirect allowed transitions were calculated, the values were equal 3. 2 eV and 3. 1 eV respectively.

50|$|Wacklin studied {{portrait}} painting Royal Swedish Academy of Arts between 1731-1734, wallpaper {{painting in}} Saint Petersburg, {{and he is}} also to have studied in Copenhagen. Wacklin was the first professional artist in Finland. He painted portraits, especially in the late 1750s, and along with Nils Schillmark {{was one of the}} early Finnish landscape artists. Wacklin was also the only representative of the Finnish rococo movement. Wacklin rococo paintings used dark colors. Wacklin portrait paintings often depict the figures with an ovaloid head, narrow eyes and a long nose. As with most professional artists at that time, he used layer <b>coating</b> <b>techniques</b> in his paintings.|$|E
50|$|Another {{nanoparticle}} {{approach is}} using conducting polymers {{as both the}} binder and the additive for nanoparticle batteries. One study examined a three-dimensional conducting polymer and hydrogel network inside which silicon nanoparticles reside. The framework resulted in a marked improvement in electrode stability, with over 90% capacity retention after 5,000 cycles. However, the potential for inexpensive scale up has not been thoroughly investigated. Researchers at Trinity College in Dublin, Ireland offered another potential solution, utilizing slurry <b>coating</b> <b>techniques</b> - which are currently employed at large scales for electrode production - with a conducting polymer binder. In general, the conducting polymer additive provides both mechanical stabilization and an avenue for conduction, replacing the conventional two-material system of a polymer stabilizer and carbon black particles. The substitution allows both better stabilization and better conduction.|$|E
50|$|Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMs) {{are small}} {{microfabricated}} devices that combine electrical and mechanical components. Devices vary {{in size from}} below one micron to millimeters in size, functioning individually or in arrays to sense, control, and activate mechanical processes on the micro scale. Examples include pressure sensors, accelerometers, and microengines. Fabrication of MEMs involves despositing a uniform layer of photoresist onto the Si wafer. Photoresist has traditionally been applied to wafers in IC manufacturing using a spin coating technique. In complex MEMs devices that have etched areas with high aspect ratios, {{it can be difficult}} to achieve uniform coverage along the top, side walls, and bottoms of deep grooves and trenches using spin <b>coating</b> <b>techniques</b> due to the high rate of spin needed to remove excess liquid. Ultrasonic spray techniques are used to spray uniform coatings of photoresist onto high aspect ratio MEMs devices and can minimize usage and overspray of photoresist.|$|E

40|$|The {{biomimetic}} <b>coating</b> <b>technique</b> {{can be used}} {{to deposit}} layers of calcium phosphate (CaP) on medical devices to improve their osteoconductivity and osseointegration. The inorganic layer generated is akin to mineralized bone matrix and can be degraded as such. The biomimetic <b>coating</b> <b>technique</b> involves the nucleation and growth of bone-like crystals on a pretreated substrate by immersing it in a supersaturated solution of CaP under physiological conditions of temperature (37 °C) and pH (7. 4). The method, originally developed by Kokubo and his co-workers in 1990, has since undergone improvement and refinement by several groups of investigators. Biomimetic coatings are valuable in that they can serve as a vehicle for the slow, sustained release of osteogenic agents at the site of implantation. This attribute is rendered possible by the near-physiological conditions under which these coatings are prepared, which permits the incorporation of bioactive agents into the inorganic crystal latticework rather than their superficial adsorption on preformed layers. In addition, the biomimetic <b>coating</b> <b>technique</b> can be applied to implants of an organic as well as of a metallic nature and to those with irregular surface geometries, which is not possible using conventional methodologies...|$|R
50|$|Extrusion coating is {{the coating}} of a molten web of {{synthetic}} resin onto a substrate material. It is a versatile <b>coating</b> <b>technique</b> {{used for the}} economic application of various plastics, notably polyethylene, onto paperboard, corrugated fiberboard, paper, aluminium foils, cellulose, Non-wovens, or plastic films.|$|R
50|$|Silver {{nanoparticles}} can undergo <b>coating</b> <b>techniques</b> {{that offer}} a uniform functionalized surface to which substrates can be added. When the nanoparticle is coated, for example, in silica the surface exists as silicic acid. Substrates can thus be added through stable ether and ester linkages that are not degraded immediately by natural metabolic enzymes. Recent chemotherapeutic applications have designed anti cancer drugs with a photo cleavable linker, such as an ortho-nitrobenzyl bridge, attaching it to the substrate on the nanoparticle surface. The low toxicity nanoparticle complex can remain viable under metabolic attack for the time necessary to be distributed throughout the bodies systems. If a cancerous tumor is being targeted for treatment, ultraviolet light can be introduced over the tumor region. The electromagnetic energy of the light causes the photo responsive linker to break between the drug and the nanoparticle substrate. The drug is now cleaved and released in an unaltered active form {{to act on the}} cancerous tumor cells. Advantages anticipated for this method is that the drug is transported without highly toxic compounds, the drug is released without harmful radiation or relying on a specific chemical reaction to occur and the drug can be selectively released at a target tissue.|$|E

5000|$|The {{second and}} third {{generation}} superalloys introduced about 3 and 6 weight per cent Rhenium, for increased temperature capability. Re is a slow diffuser and typically partitions to the γ matrix, decreasing the rate of diffusion (and thereby high temperature creep) and improving high temperature performance and increasing service temperatures by 30 °C and 60 °C in {{second and third}} generation superalloys, respectively. Re {{has also been shown}} to promote the formation of rafts of the γ' phase (as opposed to cuboidal precipitates). The presence of rafts can decrease creep rate in the power-law regime (controlled by dislocation climb), but can also potentially increase the creep rate if the dominant mechanism is particle shearing. Furthermore, Re tends to promote the formation of brittle TCP phases, which has led to the strategy of reducing Co, W, Mo, and particularly Cr. Younger generations of Ni-based superalloys have significantly reduced Cr content for this reason, however with the reduction in Cr comes a reduction in oxidation resistance. Advanced <b>coating</b> <b>techniques</b> are now used to offset the loss of oxidation resistance accompanying the decreased Cr contents. [...] Examples of second generation superalloys include PWA1484, CMSX-4 and René N5. Third generation alloys include CMSX-10, and René N6. Fourth, Fifth, and even Sixth generation superalloys have been developed which incorporate Ruthenium additions, making them more expensive still than the prior generation's Re-containing alloys. The effect of Ru on the promotion of TCP phases is not well-determined. Early reports determined that Ru decreased the supersaturation of Re in the matrix and thereby diminished the susceptibility to TCP phase formation. More recent studies have noted the opposite effect. Chen, et al., found that in two alloys differing significantly only in Ru content (USTB-F3 and USTB-F6) that the addition of Ru increased both the partitioning ratio as well as the supersaturation in the γ matrix of Cr and Re, and thereby promoted the formation of TCP phases.|$|E
