5|$|Three United States Supreme Court {{decisions}} in 1919 each upheld convictions under laws against {{certain kinds of}} anti-war speech. In 1919, the <b>Court</b> <b>upheld</b> the conviction of Socialist Party leader Charles Schenck for publishing anti-war literature. In Debs v. United States, the <b>court</b> <b>upheld</b> the conviction of Eugene Debs. While the <b>Court</b> <b>upheld</b> a conviction a third time in Abrams v. United States, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote an important dissent which has gradually been absorbed as an American principle: he urged the court to treat freedom of speech as a fundamental right, which should rarely be restricted.|$|E
5|$|Universal appealed, {{trying to}} prove {{consumer}} confusion by presenting {{the results of a}} telephone survey and examples from print media where people had allegedly assumed a connection between the two Kongs. On October 4, 1984, however, the <b>court</b> <b>upheld</b> the previous verdict.|$|E
5|$|Also in Oregon v. Mitchell, the Supreme Court {{addressed}} {{the constitutionality of}} various other provisions relating to voter qualifications and prerequisites to voting. The <b>Court</b> <b>upheld</b> Section 202, which prohibits any state or local jurisdiction from requiring people to live in their borders for longer than 30 days before allowing them to vote in a presidential election. Additionally, the <b>Court</b> <b>upheld</b> the provision lowering the minimum voting age to 18 in federal elections, but it held that Congress exceeded its power by lowering the voting age to 18 in state elections; this precipitated the ratification of the Twenty-sixth Amendment the following year, which lowered the voting age in all elections to 18. The Court was deeply divided in Oregon v. Mitchell, {{and a majority of}} justices did not agree on a rationale for the holding.|$|E
25|$|Numerous plaintiffs have {{challenged}} DOMA. Prior to 2009, all federal <b>courts</b> <b>upheld</b> DOMA in its entirety.|$|R
50|$|In early 1950s too {{district}} administration kept refusing Madhe-Sahaba processions and counter processions and <b>courts</b> <b>upheld</b> such stands.|$|R
5|$|The ACLU also {{challenged}} many {{loyalty oath}} requirements across the country, but the <b>courts</b> <b>upheld</b> {{most of the}} loyalty oath laws. California ACLU affiliates successfully challenged the California state loyalty oath. The Supreme <b>Court,</b> until 1957, <b>upheld</b> nearly every law which restricted the liberties of Communists.|$|R
5|$|Early in the Act's {{enforcement}} history, the Supreme Court {{addressed the}} constitutionality of several provisions relating to voter qualifications and prerequisites to voting. In Katzenbach v. Morgan (1966), the <b>Court</b> <b>upheld</b> {{the constitutionality of}} Section 4(e). This section prohibits jurisdictions from administering literacy tests to citizens who attain a sixth-grade education in an American school in which the predominant language was Spanish, such as schools in Puerto Rico. Although the Court had earlier held in Lassiter v. Northampton County Board of Elections (1959) that literacy tests did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment, in Morgan the Court held that Congress could enforce Fourteenth Amendment rights—such {{as the right to}} vote—by prohibiting conduct it deemed to interfere with such rights, even if that conduct may not be independently unconstitutional. After Congress created a nationwide ban on all literacy tests and similar devices in 1970 by enacting Section 201, the <b>Court</b> <b>upheld</b> the ban as constitutional in Oregon v. Mitchell (1970).|$|E
5|$|In United States v. Williams (2008), the <b>Court</b> <b>upheld</b> the PROTECT Act of 2003, {{ruling that}} prohibiting offers to provide and {{requests}} to obtain child pornography {{did not violate}} the First Amendment, even if a person charged under the Act did not possess child pornography.|$|E
5|$|Mary Leonard {{became the}} first woman {{admitted}} to the state bar on April 13, 1886, when the court admitted her after a year-long battle that included the state legislature passing a new law to allow women to be admitted. In 1906, the Oregon <b>court</b> <b>upheld</b> a maximum hour law for women in State v. Muller, 48 Or. 252, 85 P. 855 (1906). Due partly to a brief by future U.S. Supreme Court justice Louis Brandeis, the U.S. Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>upheld</b> the Oregon law in Muller v. Oregon, 208 U.S. 412 (1908) despite ruling in 1905 in Lochner v. New York that a maximum hour law for bakers was unconstitutional. Then in 1910, the state legislature expanded the court back to five justices, and lastly, in 1913 the court expanded to the current seven justices.|$|E

On 11 April 2011, his appeal hearing was postponed {{for the second}} time. On 20 December 2011, the Kyrgyzstani Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>upheld</b> Askarov's sentence.|$|E
50|$|However, in 1937, four federal <b>courts</b> <b>upheld</b> the Connally Act, {{which was}} later {{administered}} by the Federal Petroleum Board that was also created by the law; the Petroleum Board {{was a part of}} the Department of the Interior.|$|R
50|$|In 1980, four FBI agents {{went to the}} Census Bureau's Colorado Springs {{office with}} {{warrants}} to seize Census documents, but were forced to leave with nothing. <b>Courts</b> <b>upheld</b> that no agency, including the FBI, has access to Census data.|$|R
50|$|The <b>court</b> {{accordingly}} <b>upheld</b> the appeal.|$|R
5|$|On May 21, 1906, the Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>upheld</b> Burton's convictions. That same day, {{another of}} Burton's lawyers, former Senator John Mellen Thurston, filed a {{petition}} for rehearing, which operated as a 60-day continuance, and in effect stayed the matter much longer because the Court {{was set to}} adjourn until October.|$|E
5|$|Only twice did the Marshall Court hear {{criminal}} cases under § 25. In Cohens v. Virginia (1821), the <b>Court</b> <b>upheld</b> a state lottery law conviction {{because the federal}} lottery was authorized only in the District of Columbia. In Worcester v. Georgia (1832), the Court reversed Worcester's conviction for being present in Cherokee country as inconsistent with federal law.|$|E
5|$|The case {{began in}} September 2006. Enderlin {{submitted}} as evidence a February 2004 letter from Jacques Chirac, {{then president of}} France, which spoke of Enderlin's integrity. The <b>court</b> <b>upheld</b> the complaint on 19 October 2006, fining Karsenty €1,000 and ordering him to pay €3,000 in costs. He lodged an appeal that day.|$|E
50|$|Eight appeals <b>courts</b> <b>upheld</b> the ACA {{mandate for}} non-church {{religious}} institutions.

5|$|In 2007, the <b>Court</b> <b>upheld</b> {{a federal}} statute banning partial-birth {{abortion}} in Gonzales v. Carhart. University of Chicago law professor Geoffrey R. Stone, a former colleague of Scalia's, criticized Gonzales, stating that religion had influenced the outcome because all five justices {{in the majority}} were Catholic, whereas the dissenters were Protestant or Jewish. This angered Scalia {{to such an extent}} that he stated he would not speak at the University of Chicago as long as Stone was there.|$|E
