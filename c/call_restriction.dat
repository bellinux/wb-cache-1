40|$|We {{elaborate}} on the semantics of an enhanced object-oriented semantic network, where multiple instantiation, multiple specialization, and meta-classes are supported for both kinds of objects: entities and properties. By semantics of a semantic network, we mean the information (both explicit and derived) that the semantic network carries. Several data models use semantic networks to organize information. However, many of these models {{do not have a}} formalism defining what the semantics of the semantic network is. In our data model, in addition to the Isa relation, we consider a stronger form of specialization for properties, that we <b>call</b> <b>restriction</b> isa, or Risa for short.

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{a notion of}} non-black-box access to computational devices (such as circuits, formulas, decision trees, and so forth) that we <b>call</b> <b>restriction</b> access. Restrictions are partial assignments to input variables. Each restriction simplifies the device, and yields a new device for the restricted function on the unassigned variables. On one extreme, full restrictions (assigning all variables) correspond to evaluating the device on a complete input, yielding {{the result of the}} computation on that input, which is the same as standard black-box access. On the other extreme, empty restrictions (assigning no variables) yield a full description of the original device. We explore the grey-scale of possibilities in the middle. Focusing on learning theory, we show that restriction access provides a setting in which one can obtain positive results for problems that have resisted attack in the black-box access model. We {{introduce a}} PAC-learning version of restriction access, and show that one can efficiently learn both decision trees and DNF formulas in this model. These two classes are not known to be learnable in the PAC model with black-box access. Our DNF learning algorithm is obtained by a reduction to a general learning problem we cal...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Despite the {{increase}} in the number of linked instances in the Linked Data Cloud in recent times, the absence of links at the concept level has resulted in heterogenous schemas, challenging the interoperability goal of the Semantic Web. In this paper, we address this problem by finding alignments between concepts from multiple Linked Data sources. Instead of only considering the existing concepts present in each ontology, we hypothesize new composite concepts defined as disjunctions of conjunctions of (RDF) types and value restrictions, which we <b>call</b> <b>restriction</b> classes, and generate alignments between these composite concepts. This extended concept language enables us to find more complete definitions and to even align sources that have rudimentary ontologies, such as those that are simple renderings of relational databases. Our concept alignment approach is based on analyzing the extensions of these concepts and their linked instances. Having explored the alignment of conjunctive concepts in our previous work, in this paper, we focus on concept coverings (disjunctions of restriction classes). We present an evaluation of this new algorithm to Geospatial, Biological Classification, and Genetics domains. The resulting alignments are useful for refining existing ontologies and determining the alignments between concepts in the ontologies, thus increasing the interoperability in the Linked Open Data Cloud. ...|$|E

We demonstrate that the combination of Isa and Risa providesapowerful conceptual modeling mechanism. The Risa relation allows to express participation constraints on properties. Speci cally, properties of a class are characterized as necessary, possible, orinapplicable on a given subclass. Whether explicitly declared or derived, this information is useful for several reasons: (i) It aids the user to understand better the semantics of the subclass, (ii) it uncovers contradictory declarations or design errors, and (iii) it characterizes property values that are missing from the database. Our data model supports property inheritance, disjoint classes, and negative information (expressed in the form of inapplicable properties). In particular, disjointness, in conjuction with Isa and Risa, can lead to the derivation of negative information or the detection of contradictory declarations...|$|E
40|$|The {{asymptotic}} restriction {{problem for}} tensors is to decide, given tensors $s$ and $t$, whether the nth tensor power of $s$ {{can be obtained}} from the $(n+o(n)) $th tensor power of t by applying linear maps to the tensor legs (this we <b>call</b> <b>restriction),</b> when $n$ goes to infinity. In this context, Volker Strassen, striving to understand the complexity of matrix multiplication, introduced in 1986 the asymptotic spectrum of tensors. Essentially, the asymptotic restriction problem for a family of tensors $X$, closed under direct sum and tensor product, reduces to finding all maps from $X$ to the reals that are monotone under restriction, normalised on diagonal tensors, additive under direct sum and multiplicative under tensor product, which Strassen named spectral points. Strassen created the support functionals, which are spectral points for oblique tensors, a strict subfamily of all tensors. Universal spectral points are spectral points for the family of all tensors. The construction of nontrivial universal spectral points has been an open problem for more than thirty years. We construct {{for the first time a}} family of nontrivial universal spectral points over the complex numbers, using quantum entropy and covariants: the quantum functionals. In the process we connect the asymptotic spectrum to the quantum marginal problem and to the entanglement polytope. To demonstrate the asymptotic spectrum, we reprove (in hindsight) recent results on the cap set problem by reducing this problem to computing asymptotic spectrum of the reduced polynomial multiplication tensor, a prime example of Strassen. A better understanding of our universal spectral points construction may lead to further progress on related questions. We additionally show that the quantum functionals are an upper bound on the recently introduced (multi-) slice rank...|$|E
