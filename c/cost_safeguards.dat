40|$|Performing an {{independent}} system andsoftware safety analysis on embedded software saves overall life-cycle cost and schedule resources, {{and provides a}} better overall product. The primary objective of safety analysis is to find and remove embedded safety related hazards in the hardware and software systems before a mishap occurs. Finding these embedded hazards early in the development cycle reduces <b>cost,</b> <b>safeguards</b> schedules, and improves prod-uct quality [see Figure 1]. The reduction in added costs and schedule slips due to problems found late in the development cycle and the improvement in product quality justify the cost of performing {{an independent}} software safety analysis. Additionally, preventing a single cata-strophic mishap by removing an embed-ded hazard could more than pay for the independent safety analysis effort many times over, depending upon the system. This article identifies key terms associ-ated with system and software safety, pro-vides a process for performing software safety analysis, specifies the required envi-ronment for efficiently and effectively per-forming safety analysis, provides cost and schedule savings rationale, and identifies issues that delay or prevent effective safe-ty analyses. Although this article empha-sizes performing safety analysis on soft-ware, a thorough software safety analysis includes a system safety analysis {{as many of the}} embedded hazards occur at inter-faces between system components. When developing software systems, a tool enables a developer to build better sys-tems quicker. The systems are more effec-tive, more efficient, and safer. Involving an independent software safety analysis con-tributes to these attributes and becomes a tool that should be used in today’s complex system development efforts.

40|$|What do senior customs {{managers}} within multinational companies do? By answering {{this seemingly}} simple question this paper {{sheds light on}} an overlooked but significant business function with immediate relevance to logistics and supply chain management practice. The paper draws {{on a series of}} long interviews with key informants at nine multinational companies. Their combined annual turnover is in excess of 400 billion. Multiple feedback cycles enabled robust analysis and factual accuracy. A review of relevant customs law, procedures and literature gives the necessary context. Findings show that senior customs managers are involved in three interdependent areas of activity: logistics support, supply chain management and regulatory compliance. However, there is considerable diversity in practice and managers are often drawn between allocating time and effort to reducing <b>costs,</b> <b>safeguarding</b> compliance and developing strategic capabilities. The identified customs management practices provide an opportunity for relevant staff in companies to identify and reflect on scope for improvements and to take more informed trade-off decisions about the allocated time and effort. A more informed understanding of the customs management practices also has utility for trade and customs policy makers tasked with reducing the transaction costs between businesses and border agencies—especially in the context of trade facilitation.

40|$|Requirements for {{effective}} safeguards {{during the transition}} to environmental management at nuclear material production facilities within the DOE complex are deriving improvements in the accuracy of nondestructive assay (NDA) techniques. An {{important aspect of the}} transition is the need for facilities to terminate safeguards on waste materials, thus reducing the <b>cost</b> for <b>safeguards</b> at the facility. Requirements for the termination of safeguards on candidate waste material have been established by DOE to minimize the potential for diversion or theft of nuclear material. Because heterogenous waste and residue materials are stored in large containers such as 208 -L drums, conventional assay techniques such as segmented gamma scanning (SGS) that were developed to assay small samples cannot always provide accurate measurements. Consequently, facilities using the conventional NDA instrumentation may be limited in their ability to discard waste materials in compliance with DOE requirements. One technique being applied to improve the accuracy of assays of waste in large containers is computerized tomography (CT). Research on the application of CT to improve both neutron and gamma-ray assays of waste is being carried out at Los Alamos National Laboratory.

40|$|Abstract. Light-alloy wheels must be {{inspected}} 100 %. High throughput {{and a low}} false-reject rate {{are thus}} the major prerequisites for automatic X-ray inspection systems. Due to the widespread variety of wheel designs and ever-increasing size of new wheel types, improvements on automatic inspection systems must be made regularly. To reduce <b>costs</b> and <b>safeguard</b> assembly, a building-block concept is being applied in mechanical construction {{as well as in}} software design that provides flexible solutions. In contrast to traditional systems, the latest generation of automatic wheel inspection systems increases throughput by using the latest digital camera technology offering maximum image-frame rates above 60 frames per second, which is also important for superior live image display. Wheels are moreover tested and identified on a parallel basis. These systems therefore also benefit directly from faster positioning times for the manipulator system. The manipulator itself has additionally become much more robust and system downtime is minimal because of the built-in, high-end components and a user-friendly maintenance concept. Last of all, several significant improvements have been implemented to decrease the false-reject rate to a minimum. For instance, new algorithms for image registration (position correction) and image filters that determine the exact defect size are being applied. The intensity resolution of digital images and precision of positioning have been increased on the hardware side, too. In this article we are going to show how the latest generation of wheel inspection systems makes use of hardware and software building blocks to constantly take advantage of recent improvements in hardware and software technology...|$|R

40|$|Based on the {{argument}} that the benefits conferred through the provision of non audit services by audit firms outweigh the attributed <b>costs</b> of <b>safeguarding</b> the auditor's independence, this paper will not only seek to justify this argument, advance proposals which do not favour an outright prohibition of the provision of non audit services, but also consider means through which non audit services could be regulated in order to facilitate competition in the audit market. At the same time it will consider various legislation which have been introduced in recent years and which are aimed at facilitating greater disclosure of information – hence improving transparency within the audit and financial markets. “Specific measures,” it is contended, “would involve not only the introduction of new standards (for example – the disclosure of client concentration) but also the elimination of current restrictions“. Different types of safeguards which exist in order “to mitigate or eliminate threats” to the auditor’s independence, {{as a result of the}} provision of non audit services, will be considered against the regulator’s aim to facilitate competition, enhance disclosure and promote other practices which would advance the regulator’s endeavour to be more “market friendly”. The consultation on control structures in audit firms and their consequences on the audit market, a consultation which was launched by the European Commission as part of its efforts to create more market players, could be regarded as a response to such proposals to facilitate a more “market friendly” environment and also to concerns that the financial market is already over regulated. Some of the possible ways advanced by the Commission as channels for facilitating greater entry into the international market include the deregulation of the capitalisation of audit firms as a catalyst for facilitating greater entry into the audit market. Deregulation of the capital structure in this sense is considered to be a “modification of Article 3 (4) of the 2006 Directive on Statutory Audit which should however not be to the detriment of robust independence rules. ...|$|R

To understand how healthcare practitioners perceive the security risks associated with mobile devices, the author developed a research model. This model suggests that a healthcare practitioner’s security perception is related to multiple subjective beliefs which could indirectly impact their behavior intentions when using the devices and adopting security controls in the workplace. Furthermore, the research studied the differences in perception among healthcare practitioners when mobile devices are provided either by healthcare institutions, Hospital-Provided-Devices, (HPD) or by themselves, Bring-Your-Own-Devices (BYOD). The study incorporates mixed research by layering two different methods.

They {{are based on a}} purchase obligation and act either by price (feed-in tariffs) or by quantity (bidding for new RES-E capacities; RES-E quotas). From the Public Economics perspective, the two instruments are distinct in terms of cost-efficacy and market incentives in a world of imperfect information. Exchangeable quotas of green certificates are preferred because this instrument allows better control over consumer costs and whilst retaining market incentives. Transaction cost economics (TCE) contributes to the assessment of these instruments, by introducing RES-E investment safeguard as a major determinant of social efficiency, and the instruments' conformity to its institutional environment as a determinant of its viability. In light of this additional consideration, the arrangements between RES-E producers and obligated buyers inherent in each instrument are in fact quite similar-either long-term contracting or vertical integration. We compare and assess RES-E price- and quantity-instruments on several dimensions from both the public economics and TCE perspectives: control of the <b>cost</b> for consumers, <b>safeguards</b> of RES-E investments, adaptability of the instrument in order to preserve its stability in the long run, market incentive intensity, and conformity with the new market regime of electricity industry.

The {{purpose of this paper}} is to explain the new core-contingent division of labor, and then to analyze it by way of the social teachings found in Rerum Novarum, Quadragesimo Anno, Laborem Exercens, and Centesimus Annus. The analysis will require a brief survey of the relevant parts of the Papal social encyclicals. Core-Contingent Employment Although usually unstated, the underlying purpose of the core-contingent employment practices seems to be a Western business strategy designed to <b>safeguard</b> <b>costs</b> against the vagaries of the business cycle. It is not unlike Japanese labor practices, notwithstanding all the talk of job security and life-time employment in Japan. In general, Japanese employment policies protect the firm is two ways: 1. by outsourcing a significant amount of work to peripheral suppliers to whom the corporation owes no obligation but who themselves must bear the costs of economic downturns through cancelled or reduced contracts and laid-off workers. (We have seen a version of this system in recent years here in the United States at General Motors which has put severe pressures on its indepen-dent suppliers to pare costs and to pass resultant savings on to G. M.); and 2. by paying guaranteed base wages and benefits, which remain intact dur-ing downturns, plus flexible bonuses, which can be reduced or eliminated during times of stringency, although Japanese employees keep their jobs with their guaranteed base wages and benefits...|$|R
40|$|The REDD-ALERT (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation from Alternative Land Uses in the Rainforests of the Tropics) project {{started in}} 2009 and {{finished}} in 2012, {{and had the}} aim of evaluating mechanisms that translate international-level agreements into instruments that would help change the behaviour of land users while minimising adverse repercussions on their livelihoods. Findings showed that some developing tropical countries have recently been through a forest transition, thus shifting from declining to expanding forests at a national scale. However, {{in most of these}} (e. g. Vietnam), {{a significant part of the}} recent increase in national forest cover is associated with an increase in importation of food and timber products from abroad, representing leakage of carbon stocks across international borders. Avoiding deforestation and restoring forests will require a mixture of regulatory approaches, emerging market-based instruments, suasive options, and hybrid management measures. Policy analysis and modelling work showed the high degree of complexity at local levels and highlighted the need to take this heterogeneity into account—it is unlikely that there will be a one size fits all approach to make Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+) work. Significant progress was made in the quantification of carbon and greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes following land-use change in the tropics, contributing to narrower confidence intervals on peat-based emissions and their reporting standards. There are indications that there is only a short and relatively small window of opportunity of making REDD+ work—these included the fact that forest-related emissions as a fraction of total global GHG emissions have been decreasing over time due to the increase in fossil fuel emissions, and that the cost efficiency of REDD+ may be much less than originally thought due to the need to factor in <b>safeguard</b> <b>costs,</b> transaction costs and monitoring costs. Nevertheless, REDD+ has raised global awareness of the world’s forests and the factors affecting them, and future developments should contribute to the emergence of new landscape-based approaches to protecting a wider range of ecosystem services...|$|R
40|$|Many {{difficult}} statistical problems arising in censuses or {{in other}} large scale surveys have an underlying Combinatorial Optimization structure and can be solved with Combinatorial Optimization techniques. These techniques are often more efficient than the ad hoc solution techniques already developed {{in the field of}} Statistics. This thesis considers in detail two relevant cases of such statistical problems, and proposes solution approaches based on Combinatorial Optimization and Graph Theory. The first problem is the delineation of Functional Regions, the second one concerns the selection of the scope of a large survey, as briefly described below. The purpose of this work is therefore the innovative application of known techniques to very important and economically relevant practical problems that the "Censuses, Administrative and Statistical Registers Department" (DICA) of the Italian National Institute of Statistics (Istat), where I am senior researcher, has been dealing with. In several economical, statistical and geographical applications, a territory must be partitioned into Functional Regions. This operation is called Functional Regionalization. Functional Regions are areas that typically exceed administrative boundaries, and they are of interest for the evaluation of the social and economical phenomena under analysis. Functional Regions are not fixed and politically delimited, but are determined only by the interactions among all the localities of a territory. In this thesis, we focus on interactions represented by the daily journey-to-work flows between localities in which people live and/or work. Functional Regionalization of a territory often turns out to be computationally difficult, because of the size (that is, the number of localities constituting the territory under study) {{and the nature of the}} journey-to-work matrix (that is, the sparsity). In this thesis, we propose an innovative approach to Functional Regionalization based on the solution of graph partition problems over an undirected graph called transitions graph, which is generated by using the journey-to-work data. In this approach, the problem is solved by recursively partitioning the transition graph by using the min cut algorithms proposed by Stoer and Wagner and Brinkmeier. %In the second approach, the problem is solved maximizing a function of the sizes and interactions of subsets identified by successions of partitions obtained via Multilevel partitioning approach. This approach is applied to the determination of the Functional Regions for the Italian administrative regions. The target population of a statistical survey, also called scope, is the set of statistical units that should be surveyed. In the case of some large surveys or censuses, the scope cannot be the set of all available units, but it must be selected from this set. Surveying each unit has a cost and brings a different portion of the whole information. In this thesis, we focus on the case of Agricultural Census. In this case, the units are farms, and we want to determine a subset of units producing the minimum total <b>cost</b> and <b>safeguarding</b> at least a certain portion of the total information, according to the coverage levels assigned by the European regulations. Uncertainty aspects also occur, because the portion of information corresponding to each unit is not perfectly known before surveying it. The basic decision aspect is to establish the inclusion criteria before surveying each unit. We propose here to solve the described problem using multidimensional binary knapsack models...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThere is {{extensive}} {{debate about}} {{the potential impact of}} the climate mechanism REDD+ on the welfare of forest-dwelling people. To provide emission reductions, REDD+ must slow the rate of deforestation and forest degradation: such a change will tend to result in local opportunity cost to farmers at the forest frontier. Social safeguard processes to mitigate negative impacts of REDD+ are being developed and can learn from existing safeguard procedures such as those implemented by the World Bank. Madagascar has a number of REDD+ pilot projects with World Bank support including the Corridor Ankeniheny-Zahamena (CAZ). Nearly two thousand households around the corridor have been identified as ‘project affected persons’ (PAPs) and given compensation. We compare households identified as project affected persons with those not identified. We found households with more socio-political power locally, those with greater food security, and those that are more accessible {{were more likely to be}} identified as eligible for compensation while many people likely to be negatively impacted by the REDD+ project did not receive compensation. We identify three issues which make it difficult for a social safeguard assessment to effectively target the households for compensation: (a) poor information on location of communities and challenging access means that information does not reach remote households; (b) reluctance of people dependant on shifting agriculture to reveal this due to government sanctions; and (c) reliance by safeguard assessors on non-representative local institutions. We suggest that in cases where the majority of households are likely to bear costs and identification of affected households is challenging, the optimal, and principled, strategy may be blanket compensation offered to all the households in affected communities; avoiding the dead weight <b>costs</b> of ineffective <b>safeguard</b> assessments. The Paris Agreement in December 2015 recognised REDD+ as a key policy instrument for climate change mitigation and explicitly recognised the need to respect human rights in all climate actions. However, safeguards will be prone to failure unless those entitled to compensation are aware of their rights and enabled to seek redress where safeguards fail. This research shows that existing safeguard commitments are not always being fulfilled and those implementing social safeguards in REDD+ should not continue with business as usual...|$|R

40|$|In {{the social}} care area, {{advocacy}} {{refers to an}} intervention that informs service users of their rights and choices and supports them in resolving issues that have {{a great impact on}} their lives. Research at PSSRU funded by the School for Social Care Research investigated some of the costs and outcomes of advocacy provided to parents with learning disabilities who were at risk of losing their children into care. Parents with learning disabilities are a group affected by multiple disadvantages and experience a higher risk of not receiving the support they need. In our research we explored some of the economic consequences of advocacy interventions for parents with learning disabilities. Our research {{is part of a larger}} study being carried out by the Personal Social Services Research Unit at LSE and funded by the School for Social Care Research. This wider study examines the economic case for a selected but diverse range of social care interventions that have previously been identified as, or accepted/argued to be effective in achieving well-being or other social care-related outcomes for adults. Partners who were actively involved in this research included Norah Fry Research Centre at Bristol University, Voiceability, Family Rights Group, Advocacy in Greenwich, Action for Advocacy and Dorset Advocacy. We employed a range of methods: first, we ran workshops with representatives of advocacy projects to assess the scope for gathering existing data; we then conducted a survey which asked project representatives to provide a range of outcome- and cost-relevant information from their case records and some additional information about characteristics of projects and resources that went into running them; third, we searched the literature for the unit <b>costs</b> of child <b>safeguarding</b> activities, care proceedings and provision as well as for economic evidence on outcomes for parents and their children; finally, we used simple decision modelling techniques to combine the different data sets. The analysis identified the costs of the advocacy intervention and the value of the potential cost savings and benefits associated with outcomes linked to advocacy. We present findings with some threshold values which reflect the number of good practice cases (similar to the ones we looked at) required on the caseload of an advocacy project in order to offset costs...|$|R
