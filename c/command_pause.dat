[...] And, before daybreak, they had, in two batteries, fifty cannon in position, with a proper set of mortars (other side the River),--ready to astonish Piccolomini and his Austrians; {{who had not}} had the least whisper of them, all night, though it was full moon. Graf von Piccolomini, an active gallant person, had refused terms, some time before; and was hopefully intent on doing his best.

There were commands to update the forums list, for instance, so the list of available message areas in the client was always up to date. Likewise, the system could be instructed to download a list of new files in a selected library, and then allow the user to select files of interest for download on the next connection. The system also included a <b>command</b> to <b>pause</b> the script and open a terminal window, allowing direct interaction with CIS until the window was closed and the script continued.|$|R

50|$|Operation Mercur (Mercury), {{defined by}} Führer Directive No. 28, the {{invasion}} of Crete, {{was conducted on the}} German side mainly by the XI Air Corps under General Kurt Student, using 10 wings, 502 airplanes, of Junkers Ju 52 trimotor transport aircraft. The Germans struck on 20 May. After an early morning bombing attack on the airfields and anti-aircraft guns of northern central and western Crete, Wave 1 dropped several thousand Fallschirmjäger, and released gliders, of the Western Group, objective Maleme airfield, and the Centre Group, objectives Khania and Suda bay. Those places were heavily defended. The Germans were under heavy fire all the way down. <b>Commanding</b> officers <b>paused</b> in their administrative work to shoot paratroopers from the tents where they sat. Pendlebury's partisans were fully on the alert. They scoured the countryside looking for Germans to kill any way that they could, preferably while still entangled in the parachute. This first group nearly snared George II. His New Zealand guards rushed him from the house, nearly surrounded by paratroopers, to take refuge in the mountains.|$|R
30|$|For the English corpus, we {{explored}} the lexical method. In this case, we fixed a priori the Fb, α, β and γ parameter values for automatic model estimation. The manual labelling of phonemes in content words and syllables with lexical stress {{were available in}} the database to build the prototype of intonation model, {{in a similar fashion}} to the previous case of the lexical German models. Here, we do not have index pauses between words, so we assigned a phrase <b>command</b> after each <b>pause.</b> This is a very rough first approximation, given that many sentences of this corpus, between pause and pause have at least two intonation phrases.|$|R

60|$|The plateau being {{somewhat}} tilted {{towards the}} west, this spot {{on which we}} had <b>paused</b> <b>commanded</b> a wide prospect on either hand. Before us, over the tree-tops, we beheld the Cape of the Woods fringed with surf; behind, we not only looked down upon the anchorage and Skeleton Island, but saw--clear across the spit and the eastern lowlands--a great field of open sea upon the east. Sheer above us rose the Spy-glass, here dotted with single pines, there black with precipices. There was no sound but that of the distant breakers, mounting from all round, and the chirp of countless insects in the brush. Not a man, not a sail upon the sea; the very largeness of the view increased the sense of solitude.|$|R

General Friedrich Paulus, a deputy Chief of the General Staff, was sent to Africa to report on the situation. The British received through Ultra a decrypt of the Paulus report but the [...] "considerable intelligence coup" [...] was mishandled, encouraging the premature attack of Operation Brevity.|$|R

40|$|Involuntary {{movements}} such as spontaneous eye blinks can {{be successfully}} inhibited at will. Little {{do we know}} how the voluntary motor circuits countermand spontaneous blinks. Do the voluntary inhibitory <b>commands</b> act to <b>pause</b> or {{to turn off the}} endogenous blink generator, or does inhibition intersect and counter the generator׳s excitatory outputs? In theory, the time taken for the system to generate an after-inhibition blink will reflect onto the form of inhibition. For instance, if voluntary commands were to turn the blink generator off then the after-blink latency would be fixed to the inhibition offset and reflect the time it takes for the generator to rebound and turn on. In this study we measured the after-blink latency from the offset of voluntary inhibition. Volunteers inhibited their blinks in response to sound tones of randomly varying durations. At the offset volunteers withdrew the inhibition and relaxed. Interestingly, the spontaneous after-blinks were fixed to the offset of the inhibition as if the generator rebounded from an off state. The after-blink latency was not related to the duration of the inhibition, and inhibiting even for {{a small fraction of the}} mean inter-blink interval generated an after-blink time-locked to the inhibition offset. Interestingly, the insertion of voluntary blinks after inhibition further altered the blink generator by delaying the spontaneous after-blinks. We propose that the inhibition of spontaneous blinks at the level of the generator allows for highly effective voluntary countermanding. Nevertheless, the withdrawal of such inhibition was strongly associated with motor excitation...|$|R
