40|$|Repair {{rather than}} {{replacement}} of pressure vessel components operating at elevated temperatures {{is becoming a}} far more viable option, with welding being used increasingly for repair, replacement, retrofits and modifications. However, the considerable cost and time involved in performing conventional post weld heattreatment (PWHT) is increasingly forcing utility owners to turn toward other alternatives, such as cold weld repairs. These require no PWHT and rely on a controlled deposition process – precise weld bead placement and heat inputs to achieve tempering of the HAZ. One such cold weld repair was applied to a prematurely failed reheater outlet header (RHOH) in an emergency situation, enabling its return to service until a replacement component was available. Investigation of this particular repair constitutes a core component of this thesis. Much of the research that has been conducted to justify <b>cold</b> <b>repair</b> techniques has used accelerated high temperature creep testing to demonstrate their integrity. How well this testing reflects real-life performance of repaired components remains uncertain. However, the present study provided {{a rare opportunity to}} evaluate the effects of service exposure on the performance of an emergency cold weld repair, as well as to examine the effectiveness of accelerated laboratory creep testing on creep life predictions for the repair weld, the original fabrication welds and the service exposed parent metal. The metallurgical and mechanical properties of the service-exposed non-PWHT temper bead (TB) repair weld were analysed and characterised systematically relative to both the service-exposed original fabrication weld and parent metal. All test specimens were machined transverse to the welding direction, from 20 mm thick slices taken from both the TB repair and original fabrication weldments. The mechanical property characterisation involved hot tensile (miniature sample), Charpy V-notch impact, hardness and accelerated creep-rupture testing. The microstructural characterisation consisted of compositional analysis, surface replication and conventional metallography, post-test fractography, high-resolution microscopy (SEM, TEM and EBSD), EDS and dilatometry. The microstructural studies were successful in characterising the service-exposed TB repair weld metal both in the as-received and post-test conditions. The findings generally showed the TB repair weld metal microstructure was significantly {{different from those of the}} parent and fabrication weld metals. This was established by the TEM and EBSD studies which showed finer carbides, higher dislocation density and limited subgrain formation, features which are consistent with structure of high stored strain energy. The finer carbides, significant Fe content of some carbides and the presence of Mo-rich carbides are also consistent with a relatively early stage in the carbide evolution sequence for this steel. Additionally, the non-metallic inclusions, which are generally considered to be deleterious to properties, were fine scale and uniform in size distribution. These microstructural characteristics were reflected in superior mechanical properties for all tests, with the notable exception of creep performance. In terms of creep resistance, weld repairs of this kind install a high energy microstructure (finer carbides, higher dislocation density, fine grain structure and subgrain / cell structure) into significantly creep degraded material and generate sharp gradients in microstructure and properties. Overall, the microstructural observations in the service-aged condition and the mechanical properties determined by the experimental work were found to support the conclusion that the ex-service material had clearly not exhausted its creep service-life. This was proven by simulating further service life using accelerated creep testing. During these experiments, the creep failure mode was found to be ductile fracture induced by micro-void coalescence. The tests indicated that although the predicted creep life of the TB repair weldment was inferior to the aged parent metal, it was slightly higher than that of the service-exposed fabrication weldment. It is therefore concluded that the TB repair weld and its associated HAZ did not compromise the overall weldment integrity. This conclusion is drawn despite the finding that the accelerated creep test data for the repair weld showed sub-normal creep performance relative to NT samples and even the aged parent metal. This outcome is probably due to the “accelerated” test conditions which induced structural changes that are unlikely to occur under the actual service conditions. Therefore, accelerated creep test data should be treated with circumspection, particularly for structures such as <b>cold</b> <b>repair</b> weld metal which are characterised by high stored strain energy. The instability of this kind of structure in relation to restoration processes (at the “accelerated” temperatures used for testing) is likely to produce premature creep failure and result in a highly conservative creep life assessment. The perceived danger of <b>cold</b> <b>repair</b> welding is that the vessel integrity will be impaired by the absence of a PWHT to reduce internal stresses, liberate hydrogen and improve mechanical properties. However, the evidence obtained in this study indicates that this need not be the case. Therefore, it is concluded that the TB weld technique can be successfully applied to high energy piping (HEP) components without the need for PWHT. The results of the investigation provide new insights into the microstructure and properties, particularly the creep performance, of service-aged <b>cold</b> <b>repair</b> welds. The research has also revealed a serious limitation of accelerated creep testing of weld repair structures of this kind, in that dynamic restoration processes can be induced that are unlikely to occur at the lower service operating temperatures and stresses...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Metal {{materials}} {{are subjected to}} innumerable time-dependent degradation mechanisms when operate in power, petrochemical and refinery plant. These {{materials are}} subjected to multiaxial stresses, creep, fatigue, corrosion and abrasion. As a result of service especially at high temperatures and high pressures, can lead to forming cracks, damages or failures. In situation of breakdown in such systems {{there is a need}} for weld repair on plant components and repair work can be expensive and time-consuming. Most weld repairs of low alloy steels require high-temperature post weld heat treatment (PWHT); but in certain repairs, however, this is not always possible. Expenses of the repair work could be reduced if the weld repairing is performed on site. Also, application of the nickel based filler metal can be alternative to performing PWHT. These repair welding procedures with Ni based filler metal could be categorized as <b>cold</b> <b>repair</b> welding. Purpose of presented investigation was to compare a repair welding technology with filler austenite material based on Ni and without application of the PWHT, with a classical repair welding procedure with preheating and PWHT and using a filler metal with chemical composition similar to parent metal.

40|$|The {{possibility}} of using <b>cold</b> spray as <b>repair</b> technique of {{martensitic stainless steel}} components was evaluated through laboratory investigations. An austenitic stainless steel feedstock powder was chosen, instead of soft metals powders like nickel, copper, or aluminum, used for repairing components made in light alloy or cast iron. The present study directly compares the microstructure, the residual stresses, and the micro-hardness of <b>repairs</b> obtained by <b>cold</b> spray and by TIG welding, that is commonly used as repair technique in large steel components. XRD and optical metallographic analysis of the <b>repairs</b> showed that <b>cold</b> spray offers some advantages, inducing compressive residual stresses in the repair and avoiding alterations of the interface between repair and base material. For these reasons, a heat treatment after the <b>cold</b> spray <b>repair</b> {{is not required to}} restore the base material properties, whereas a postweld heat treatment is needed after the welding <b>repair.</b> <b>Cold</b> spray <b>repair</b> also exhibits a higher microhardness than the welding repair.

40|$|This work {{introduces}} {{an advanced}} development, experimental, process {{with which the}} transient behaviour of melt can be portrayed in a standardised and fault-free manner. The results contribute to process fault diagnosis, process optimisation, expansion of heuristic knowledge and to the verification of mathematic models. Consequently these results can {{make a contribution to}} increasing efficiency and reducing the costs for energy and raw materials. The methodical procedure will be briefly presented in the following text. Chapter 2 will describe the glass furnace in its entirety with its subunits and aggregates. Particular attention is placed on the aggregates that influence the transient and fluidic aspects of the glass melt. Chapter 3 will introduce residence time and residence time distribution as input and output descriptions with their statistical evaluation options. Furthermore, this theoretical part section will describe idealised fluidic models whose serial and parallel interaction give insight to process flows and the macro-mixing state. A general description of three dimensional glass furnace models serves as a theoretical basis for the comparison made in Chapter 4; a comparison of residence time distributions which are experimental and those which are calculated from three dimensional models. Chapter 4 explains the tracer method and the properties of tracer material which is necessary for this method. Residence time distribution will be correlated to distinct points which are subject to individual, transient and fluidic behaviour. Only {{with the help of a}} uniform evaluation for residence time distribution is it possible to improve the comparison of numerous experiments with one another and increase the significance of statistical distribution. This is also a foundation for advanced evaluation and verification of Residence Time Distribution (RTD) - and three dimensional simulation. After the methodology for tracer experiments and their evaluation potentials have been extensively explained, the next section will present concrete results. Four different glass melt tanks for hollow glass production were used as experimental objects (U-flame tank with filling end, U-flame tank with two filling ends, cross-fired tank at the end of a furnace campaign and the same cross-fired tank after <b>cold</b> <b>repair).</b> These results were compared with one another and critically discussed, as well as also compared and verified with RTD simulation and three dimensional simulation. Chapter 5 presents excerpts from the Procedure Book that was developed for industrial application. The individual processes and conditions necessary for meaningful execution of a tracer test are described in this chapter. The objective is to standardise, simplify, accelerate and economically perform processes. This book contains every type of information for rapid and independent execution of tracer experiments, from the procurement of tracer materials to the evaluation of residence time distributions...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{developing}} maintenance policies for critical assets {{to improve the}} production performance based on life cycle cost (LCC) analysis. A general approach is adopted for conducting the LCC analysis. The investigation {{is based on a}} case study to demonstrate how an optimum maintenance policy is determined. The relevant LCC structure in the case study is defined for the decision process which involves determination of the optimum life, repair limit and selection of materials, and trade-off between repair and replacement. The LCC analysis is based on statistical data modelling which facilitates decision-making on the optimal replacement of an asset and its remaining life. Based on the optimization and remaining life criterion, the optimal maintenance policy can be made. The results obtained from this case study include selection of the best lining material for use, determination of the optimal time for refractory lining replacement, the hot repair sequence required for maintaining the optimum condition and the repair limit for doing <b>cold</b> <b>repairs</b> before replacement, for one type of electric arc furnaces used in the steel industry...|$|R

40|$|Increased {{emphasis}} on energy management has helped sites reduce system cost through {{the diagnosis and}} repair of ?Leaking? or ?Blowing? steam traps (?Leakage Failures?). Timely maintenance response is a significant action to lower energy use and GHG emissions generated by steam production. But, what action should be taken with Cold Traps? In every steam trap survey to determine the steam trap population?s current state of health, there are usually {{a significant amount of}} steam traps determined to be ?Cold? or ?Low Temp? (?Drainage Failures? or ?Cold Traps?). It seems that site personnel commonly assign a lower response priority to these Drainage Failures traps, and sometimes actually implement a practice to intentionally convert Leaking traps into Cold Traps by closing the inlet stop valve to immediately stop energy leakage. Subsequently, they may label those traps as ?Valved- Out? or ?Out of Service,? but those trap stations were originally designed as needed to drain retained condensate from the system. So, the correct designation for such a trap station is ?Cold,? regardless of the current intention. If the trap station does not drain condensate and is not hot, it is ?Cold. ? It can be astounding that many sites are not convinced of what actions or priority to take to <b>repair</b> <b>Cold</b> Traps, even while intrinsically understanding that {{there is something wrong with}} having Cold Traps that cannot drain condensate from a steam system.
