40|$|A {{recent issue}} of The Yale Journal of International Law {{featured}} an article offering {{a critique of the}} <b>current</b> <b>prosecution</b> of human rights violations in Argentina. I The authors of this piece are a courageous human rights lawyer and active member of the Peronist Party, Emilio Mignone, and two able North American attorneys, Cynthia L. Estlund and Samuel Issacharoff. The article constitutes a valuable contribution to the discussion of the legal and moral implications of the prosecution of past human rights violations in Argentina. However, the article fails to give an impartial perspective on the issues under consideration and commits several errors, thus distorting the aims of the present constitutional government with respect to these prosecutions. The authors also isolate these aims from the general context of the government 2 ̆ 7 s human rights policy. While impartiality is often difficult with regard to such emotional issues, the reader may achieve a more balanced view if these issues are presented from a different perspective...|$|E

40|$|This article {{considers}} the controversial proceedings against Baltasar Garzón, Spain’s best-known judge. These proceedings and Garzón's own {{investigations of the}} crimes of the Franco era have thrown up {{a large number of}} issues about the retrospective application of justice to conflicts, such as the Spanish Civil War, apparently consigned to history. After examining the historical record of the crimes of the Franco regime this article goes on to look at the 2007 law of Historical Memory as Spain’s first transitional measure to face up to this past.

40|$|Over {{the last}} five years, the {{announced}} new policy on drugs, cannabis in particular, {{has been the subject}} of much debate within the Belgian Federal Government and between the government and the opposition parties. Unclear policies and poor public communication from the Federal Government, the competent minister and the other parties caused immense confusion about whether and when the possession of cannabis would be legal and what the criteria would be for prosecution when found possessing cannabis. This confusion has been illustrated by a survey by Gelders and Van Mierlo (2004) Legalized or not? Poor public communication causes confusion over the new cannabis policy in Belgium.

40|$|This {{research}} {{assessed the}} criminological significance of motor vehicle crash data within {{the criminal justice}} context. The study was conducted at the southern region Accident Bureau of the Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Police Department (EMPD). The objectives of this research are to: a. Explore and describe the extent and criminological impact of road traffic crashes on a macro level. b. Explore and describe the impact of road traffic crashes on a micro level. c. Explain the criminological significance of road traffic crash data in relation to effective road safety management. d. Evaluate and describe the attendance and recording procedure of road crashes. e. Evaluate and describe the supervisor’s responsibility {{in relation to the}} quality of crash data recorded. f. Evaluate and describe the effectiveness of crash statistics accessed by management and/or officials. g. Evaluate and explain the <b>current</b> <b>prosecution</b> procedure as part of the CJS. h. Evaluate existing policy about the crash-recording process applicable to operational law enforcement practitioners of the EMPD. i. Explore and describe the current state of motor vehicle insurance and its necessity from a criminological perspective. The researcher followed a mixed-methods approach, collecting quantitative data from recorded Accident Report Forms and qualitative data from interviews with participants active in their fields of expertise. Road crashes are characterised by injury and damage; victims suffer trauma and economic consequences, and the society and {{the economy as a whole}} are affected. The research suggests that accurate road crash data form a crucial component in the investigation, prosecution and development of road safety strategies in the quest towards improved road safety efforts. It also indicates that existing crash data are of such a sub-standard that traffic professionals will not be able to develop effective and efficient road safety strategies in pursuit of road safetyCriminology and Security ScienceM.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{analyzes the}} development of Habeas Corpus law in four time periods: ante-bellum slave law; Reconstruction; the twentieth century debates over the incorporation of the Bill of Rights to the states; and habeas corpus during war, particularly the <b>current</b> <b>prosecution</b> of the “War on Terror. ” If the “body,” seemingly detached from ascriptive or citizenship-based qualifications, {{is the subject of}} the “Great Writ of Liberty,” then the legal-political status of individual equality is revealed within habeas law. I argue that habeas corpus has always been inextricably linked to shifting notions of American citizenship and race, moving from state to national, and then again to state conceptions of citizenship linked with race, with the respect to meaningful access to the “Great Writ. ” The origins of this divide {{can be found in the}} enduring, yet shifting, conceptions of state versus national citizenship in the American state as well as changing conceptions of racial egalitarianism. The most important congressional changes to the scope of Habeas Corpus—which have informed our understanding of the writ ever since—came in the 1867 habeas Corpus Act, passed during Reconstruction. Although crafted within a post-bellum milieu of renewed conceptions of national power over states, this act was intended to protect freed slaves and their families only—not to serve as a post-trial or post-conviction mechanism for general criminal adjudication, which had always been a mostly sovereign state function. As the debates over the incorporation began in earnest in the first third of the twentieth century, and particularly as courts sought to redefine criminal law more generally, the scope of habeas was simultaneously enlarged to help affect this change. However, the courts new conception of national citizenship sought to trump the state conceptions of citizenship and its attendant rights and duties through incorporation with a legal vehicle that was shaped only to confer legal protection for freed slaves—not every individual convicted of a crime and held unconstitutionally by a state. We thus see during the remainder of the twentieth century a rise and fall of the scope and power of the Great Writ as we as a nation determine the proper conception of our rights and duties as citizens within a government shaped by federalism. ...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{number of}} fatalities, serious bodily {{injuries}} and high potential injuries is unsatisfactory according to community standards; {{people are still}} being killed and seriously injured on mine sites due to human behaviour factors, such as not complying with rules, procedures and management failings. This research aims to conduct {{an analysis of the}} Australian Mining Industry safety performance and make comparisons with international mining operations, examine the mine safety environment and determine the effects that culture, risk management, prosecution policies, fly in fly out, fatigue and mental health are having on safety improvement. In this regard, as a major part of this research, a field survey has been conducted in the Qld and NSW coal mining industry. A total of 37 mines participated in manual and electronic surveys and responses were received from over 1200 questionnaires. A statistical comparison of the two surveys has been conducted using the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test. This research has found that fatigue and awareness issues as well as travel times to work are having a major impact on safety at work, which is particularly evident when employees are working 12 hour shifts. The survey results show that {{there is a lack of}} experienced personnel in the industry and that the effective management of contractors continues to cause concern. This research has demonstrated that the <b>current</b> approach to <b>prosecution</b> is counter-productive, as it inhibits thorough safety investigation and creates a defensive rather than a no blame culture. It also prevents the sharing of safety information and heeding the lessons learned. It has been found that there is a lack of training in safety management systems, management influence effects the outcomes of risk assessments, accident investigation would be better without legal people’s involvement and an official inquiry would produce better outcomes if there was no fear of prosecution. This research has demonstrated that the safety performance in the Australian Mining Industry has not improved and may even be deteriorating and that in order to improve safety performance the mining industry needs to adopt the recommendations which have been made regarding culture, prosecution policies, training, risk assessments, shift lengths and fly in fly out operations...|$|R
40|$|The {{theme of}} the thesis is to {{investigate}} the current safety paradigm in the Australian coal mining industry and establish if the safety performance is improving. The number of fatalities, serious bodily injuries and high potential injuries is unsatisfactory according to community standards. People are still being killed {{and there is little}} evidence of a sustained improvement trend over the last decade. Lost time injuries have reduced dramatically, but are now plateauing and {{over the last few years}} along with high potential injuries and other safety indicators are trending upwards. This research has found that hundreds of serious injuries are not being reported which would have a significant effect on safety indicators in the Industry. Fatigue and awareness issues as well as travel times to work are having a major impact on safety at work, which is particularly evident when employees are working 12 -hour shifts. The rapid expansion of the mining industry has required the growing use of contractors, hence creating a more inexperienced workforce. Another significant finding is that there is a close association between the level of fatalities recorded and the growing use of contract labour in the industry. This research has demonstrated that the <b>current</b> approach to <b>prosecution</b> is counter productive, as it inhibits thorough safety investigation and creates a defensive rather than a proactive safety culture. This approach has resulted in unwillingness by companies to examine the root causes of accidents and incidents for the fear of being prosecuted. This research has shown there is a lack of trust between mining companies, the unions and the inspectorate. It has been stated that miners lives are at risk because of the shortage of Inspectors in Queensland and that the inspectorate was not meeting its compliance obligations. There is a "disconnect" between what mining companies aspire to achieve at the corporate level with their safety management systems and what is achieved at the coal face. The thesis has demonstrated that safety performance is deteriorating and in order to improve this situation recommendations have been made regarding prosecution, contractors, fatigue, safety and health management systems, hours of work, audits and remuneration for inspectors...|$|R
40|$|The thesis, titled The Selected Aspects of Environmental Law in {{the legal}} theory and {{practise}} was written on a base of interdepartmental cooperation between FŽP (Faculty of Environment) and PEF (Faculty of Operation and Economy) at ČZU (Czech University of Agriculture). The main idea of the thesis is to make a study of criminal law development from a standpoint of the society interests since the force of legislation Nr. 140 / 1961 Sb. (Code), criminal law, until the present time, when the law mentioned above {{was replaced by the}} law Nr. 40 / 2009 Sb. (Code), Penal Code. The study takes quite a long term period, from 1961 to 2015. In the theoretical part I primarilly tried to characterise the rank of interest within the branch of criminal law, with the focus on the substantive criminal law. At the same time I tried to determinate its relationship to the international law and the Czech legal system built on two basic constitutional laws Constitution of the Czech Republic (i. e. Constitutional law Nr. 1 / 1993 Sb. (Code), as amended). Then, in the practical part I wanted to characterise criminal offences development {{in the context of the}} substantive criminal laws mentioned above, with respect to the state system at the certain time, and in the context of society interests at that time, especially focused on the sphere of environment protection and criminal law usage together with the law characterised by ultima ratio principle, i. e. as the last possible means. I also made an analysis and comparism of statitistics data concerning registered criminal offences made by the Police of the Czech republic that was provided to me by The Police Presidium of the Czech Republic, Department of Analyses. The final part presents detected results that point out latent behaviour to environmant in the Czech Republic and the problems connected with quantifying losses. In this respect the law enforcement agencies try to solve the problem by taking in an expert in agreement with the legalities of § 105, Paragraph 1 of the Law 141 / 1961 Sb. (Code), Penal Code, when the expert makes an expertise according to the law enforcement agencies requests in which he objectively deals with the damage setting. Its determination is important for example for the right legal qualification of the criminal offence against environment. At the end of the thesis I also try to outline possible measures contributing to improving of <b>current</b> state of <b>prosecution</b> connected with criminal offences against environment with greater emphasis on respective efficiency...|$|R
