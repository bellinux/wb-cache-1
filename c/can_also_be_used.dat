5|$|HST's {{guidance}} system <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> {{as a scientific}} instrument. Its three Fine Guidance Sensors (FGS) are primarily used to keep the telescope accurately pointed during an observation, but <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> to carry out extremely accurate astrometry; measurements accurate to within 0.0003arcseconds have been achieved.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} peptide {{coupling}} reagents <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> to prepare Weinreb–Nahm amides from carboxylic acids. Various carbodiimide-, hydroxybenzotriazole-, and triphenylphosphine-based couplings {{have been reported}} specifically for this purpose.|$|E
5|$|Aluminium {{chloride}} <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> {{to introduce}} aldehyde groups onto aromatic rings, for example via the Gattermann-Koch reaction which uses carbon monoxide, hydrogen chloride and a copper(I) chloride co-catalyst.|$|E

It is also used as sweetener for granola, applesauce, baked beans, candied sweet potatoes, winter squash, cakes, pies, breads, tea, coffee, and hot toddies. Maple syrup <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> {{as a replacement for}} honey in wine (mead).|$|E
50|$|Standard H0e {{couplings}} <b>are</b> {{most often}} <b>used.</b> An alternative <b>is</b> the Greenwich coupling which {{is compatible with}} the standard couplings but can be magnetically operated.

50|$|Another method (Henry's Law) <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> {{to measure}} the amount of {{dissolved}} CO in a liquid, if the amount of foreign gases is insignificant.|$|R
50|$|The {{beverage}} <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> as {{an ingredient}} in cooking. One Vietnamese recipe adapted by an American cook uses Coco Rico {{to break down}} the protein in catfish.|$|R
5|$|Metallic lithium and its complex hydrides, such as Li, {{are used}} as high-energy {{additives}} to rocket propellants. Lithium aluminum hydride <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> by itself as a solid fuel.|$|E
5|$|Radiotherapy <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> {{before surgery}} in certain cases. When {{pre-operative}} imaging or clinical evaluation shows tumor invading the cervix, radiation {{can be given}} before a total hysterectomy is performed. Brachytherapy and EBRT <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used,</b> singly or in combination, {{when there is a}} contraindication for hysterectomy. Both delivery methods of radiotherapy are associated with side effects, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract.|$|E
5|$|The curve-shortening flow <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> {{to prove}} the theorem of the three geodesics, that every smooth Riemannian {{manifold}} topologically equivalent to a sphere has three geodesics that form simple closed curves.|$|E
25|$|This <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> found <b>using</b> {{implicit}} differentiation.|$|R
50|$|For {{more severe}} VCD cases, {{physicians}} may inject botulinum toxin into the vocal (thyroarytenoid) muscles to weaken or decrease muscle tension. Nebulized Lignocaine <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> in acute cases and helium-oxygen inhalation given by face mask has <b>been</b> <b>used</b> {{in cases of}} respiratory distress.|$|R

5|$|Ytterbium <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> as a dopant to {{help improve}} the grain refinement, strength, and other {{mechanical}} properties of stainless steel. Some ytterbium alloys have rarely been used in dentistry.|$|E
5|$|A fluffernutter is a {{sandwich}} made {{with peanut butter}} and marshmallow fluff usually served on white bread. Variations of the sandwich include the substitution of wheat bread {{and the addition of}} various sweet, salty and savory ingredients. The term fluffernutter <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> to describe other food items, primarily desserts, that incorporate peanut butter and marshmallow fluff.|$|E

5|$|A jonline <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> {{to tether}} the diver's {{equipment}} to the dive boat {{before or after the}} dive.

5000|$|In rhetoric, antonomasia {{is a kind}} of metonymy {{in which}} an epithet or phrase takes the place of a proper name, such as [...] "the little corporal" [...] for Napoleon I. Conversely, antonomasia <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>using</b> a proper name as an archetypal name, to express a generic idea.|$|R
5|$|Another type of {{approach}} is tissue engineering, using biomaterials to help scaffold and rebuild damaged tissues. Biomaterials being investigated include natural substances such as collagen or agarose and synthetic ones like polymers and nitrocellulose. They fall into two categories: hydrogels and nanofibers. These materials <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> {{as a vehicle for}} delivering gene therapy to tissues.|$|E
5|$|As well as finding {{objective}} {{evidence of a}} crime being committed, investigations <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> to prove the intent (known by the legal term mens rea). For example, the Internet history of convicted killer Neil Entwistle included references to a site discussing How to kill people.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{production}} difficulty and high price, lutetium has very few commercial uses, especially {{since it is}} rarer {{than most of the}} other lanthanides but is chemically not very different. However, stable lutetium can be used as catalysts in petroleum cracking in refineries and <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> in alkylation, hydrogenation, and polymerization applications.|$|E
