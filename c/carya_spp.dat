40|$|Abstract: The {{disturbance}} {{history of}} six mature white oak (Quercus alba L.) – northern red oak (Quercus rubra L.) – hickory (<b>Carya</b> <b>spp.)</b> {{stands in the}} Ozark Mountains of northern Arkansas were reconstructed using tree-ring and firescar analysis. Results indicate that all six stands originated in the early 1900 s following timber harvesting and (or) fire. These disturbances initiated a pulse of oak-dominated establishment. Most sites were periodically burned during the next several decades. Abrupt radial growth increases in all stands during the 1920 s to 1940 s reflected additional disturbances. These perturbations likely provided growing space for existing trees, but {{did not result in}} increased seedling establishment. Thus, multiple disturbances were important in the origin and development of the stands studied. By the 1930 s and 1940 s, oak establishment was replaced by shade-tolerant, fire-intolerant non-oak species; few oak recruited into tree size classes after the 1950 s. The decrease in oaks and the increase in non-oaks coincided with fire suppression. Few scars were recorded during the past 60 – 70 years. Prescribed fire may be an important management tool in regenerating oak forests in northern Arkansas.

40|$|Tree ring {{analysis}} was studied {{as a means}} of constructing historical environmental pollution records. Lead in xylem from Liriodendron tulipifera, Quercus alba, and <b>Carya</b> <b>spp.</b> trees growing near a road and in a forest was measured by atomic absorption graphite furnace techniques. Lead concentrations in xylem formed before and after 1924 were compared among species, within species, and between sites. Carya had the highest xylem lead and was the only species sensitive to low-level, post- 1923 lead exposures. Evidence of lead movement among rings was found in Carya and Liriodendron. The mean rate of xylem lead increase after 1932 in the ring-porous species compared well with traffic growth rate along the road, but the variability of this parameter among trees and its inverse correlation with distance from the road suggests the necessity of many intra-specific replicates to relate temporally patterned xylem lead concentrations to pollution histories...|$|E

40|$|This PNVG was {{historically}} {{present on}} nearly all uplands {{in the region}} except on the most edaphically limited sites (droughty sands, calcareous clays, and shallow soil barrens/rock outcrops). Such sites are underlain by loamy to fine-textured soils of variable depths. These are upland sites on ridgetops and adjacent side slopes, with moderate fertility and moisture retention. (Ecological Classification CES 203. 378). Vegetation Description This PNVG consists of forests and woodlands dominated by Pinus echinata and/or Pinus taeda in combination {{with a host of}} dry to dry-mesic site hardwood species at lesser prevelance (e. g., Quercus spp., Liquidambar styraciflua, <b>Carya</b> <b>spp.).</b> Overall this system may have supported relatively low levels of vascular plant species diversity.

40|$|Indigenous Peoples of North America have collectively used {{approximately}} 1800 different {{native species}} of plants, algae, lichens and fungi as food. When European explorers, traders and settlers {{arrived on the}} continent, these native foods, often identified and offered by Indigenous hosts, gave them sustenance {{and in some cases}} saved them from starvation. Over the years, some of these species – particularly various types of berries, such as blueberries and cranberries (Vaccinium spp.), wild raspberries and blackberries (Rubus spp.), and wild strawberries (Fragaria spp.), and various types of nuts (Corylus spp., <b>Carya</b> <b>spp.,</b> Juglans spp., Pinus spp.), along with wild-rice (Zizania spp.) and maple syrup (from Acer saccharum) – became more widely adopted and remain in use to the present day. Some of these and some other species were used in plant breeding programs, as germplasm for hybridization programs, or to strengthen a crop's resistance to disease. At the same time, many nutritious Indigenous foods fell out of use among Indigenous Peoples themselves, and along with their lessened use came a loss of associated knowledge and cultural identity. Today, for a variety of reasons, from improving people's health and regaining their cultural heritage, to enhancing dietary diversity and enjoyment of diverse foods, some of the species that have dwindled in their use have been “rediscovered” by Indigenous and non-Indigenous Peoples, and indications are that their benefits to humanity will continue into the future...|$|E
40|$|New {{methods of}} scaling logs by weight are {{becoming}} more prevalent in the Ozark forests of Missouri. In 2009, a major weather event known as a derecho downed millions of board feet of timber in Missouri and the ensuing salvage harvest following the event necessitated {{the need for a}} faster method of scaling logs at area sawmills. It is now common in Missouri for sawmills to assume that a green board foot (bf) of oak (Quercus spp.) will weigh approximately 12 pounds (lbs.). Four species groups were selected for harvest; white oak (Quercus alba), black oak (Quercus velutina), post oak (Quercus stellata), and hickories (<b>Carya</b> <b>spp.)</b> which were not separated into specific species. Of these species groups, 220 trees were selected for harvest and felled following the collection of the diameter (in.), total height (ft.), and crown height (ft.). The total weight of the trees were collected prior to bucking and followed with the collection of the weight of the merchantable portion of the stem alone, without the tree top, and the weights of any sawlogs bucked from the merchantable stem. The data collected were used to produce averages of weight per board foot that are species specific to some of Missouri's oaks species and hickories and that will allow for better estimation of board feet volume at the sawmill...|$|E

40|$|Prescribed fire is {{a common}} tool for {{restoring}} and maintaining degraded oak savannas in the Midwest. Long-term success of restoration and maintenance ultimately depends upon new individuals entering the canopy. However, {{little is known about}} seedling and sapling response to this periodic disturbance. This study identifies how fire affects community structure and composition of dominant savanna seedlings and saplings, and takes the novel approach of linking conceptually and empirically demographic responses of seedlings and saplings to growth and gas exchange. This study was conducted within the Drury Conservation Area, located in Taney County, Missouri where there is both historical presence of oak savannas, and varying fire histories. Study sites representing unburned closed forest (n= 2) and recently burned closed forest (n= 2) were established in 2001. Twelve belt transects with an average area of 102 m 2 were established and sampled to determine indirect links between fire history effects on canopy leaf production and the demography and physiology of seedlings and saplings (Quercus spp., <b>Carya</b> <b>spp.,</b> Juniperus spp.). Following prescribed burns, canopy light penetration was significantly greater in burned forest sites than in unburned forest sites. Density, basal area, mortality, and recruitment appear to be increasing in burned forest sites relative to unburned forest sites. Maximum and ambient net photosynthetic rates increased between habitats as light availability increased. Data suggest that current prescribed fire regimes are positively affecting white oak regeneration in previously closed forests, while effectively removing cedar seedlings...|$|E
40|$|The Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) {{represents}} a ~ 170 kyr episode of anomalous global warmth ~ 56 Ma ago. The PETM {{is associated with}} rapid and massive injections of 13 C-depleted carbon into the ocean–atmosphere system reflected as a prominent negative carbon isotope excursion (CIE) in sedimentary components. Earth's surface and deep ocean waters warmed by ~ 5 °C, of which part may have occurred prior to the CIE. However, few records document continental climatic trends and changes in seasonality have not been documented. Here we present the first high-resolution vegetation and paleoclimate reconstructions for the PETM, based on nearest living relative analysis of terrestrially derived spore and pollen assemblages preserved in an expanded section from the central North Sea. Our data indicate reductions in boreal conifers {{and an increase in}} mesothermal to megathermal taxa, reflecting a shift towards wetter and warmer climate. We also record an increase in summer temperatures, greater in magnitude than the rise in mean annual temperature changes, and a shift to a summer-wet seasonality. Within the CIE, vegetation varies significantly with initial increases in epiphytic and climbing ferns, and development of extensive wetlands, followed by abundance of <b>Carya</b> <b>spp.</b> indicative of broadleaf forest colonization. Critically, the change in vegetation we report occurs prior to the CIE, and is concomitant with anomalous marine ecological change, as represented by the occurrence of Apectodinium augustum.

30|$|With the {{knowledge}} that day-roosts are not limiting factors for northern long-eared bats on the FEF or {{throughout much of the}} central Appalachians, and with the reality that whitenose syndrome has decreased extant populations of the bat by 90 % or more (Frick et al. 2015, Powers et al. 2015), we suggest that managers seeking reasons to justify the reintroduction of fire on central Appalachian landscapes choose stewardship goals other than bats. In the near-term, resumption of burning in stands that have been fire suppressed for decades appears to have no readily discernible negative impacts to northern long-eared bat habitat and may improve forest stand structure and tree condition for day-roosting. Long-term impacts will need to be assessed by tracking the fate of currently available potential roosts and by monitoring the suitability of regeneration of fire-tolerant, shade-intolerant species such as oaks, hickories (<b>Carya</b> <b>spp.</b> Nutt.), and black locust, and the reduction of fire-intolerant, shade-tolerant species such as red maple or American beech in the future. Shorter fire-return intervals or successive fires used as a “reset” in oak-dominated stands in the central Appalachians where fire suppression has occurred over several previous decades could conceivably reduce stem densities and snag availability, whereby day-roost habitat for northern long-eared bats would be reduced. However, with extant bat populations so reduced, and with little prospect of near-term recovery (Frick et al. 2015), and with burn-windows so temporally narrow in the late-dormant season on the FEF and the surrounding Allegheny landscape, we think the prospect of this occurrence is low.|$|E
40|$|Wetlands {{have been}} {{providing}} humans with critical natural ecosystem services throughout our time on Earth. Nevertheless, these invaluable ecosystems have been habitually altered {{as a cost}} of human progression. Two {{of the most common}} alterations to wetlands are damming and filling. Both occurred along Kimages Creek in Charles City County, VA during the 19 th and 20 th centuries. In 2010 the Lake Charles dam was partially removed, restoring the creek’s tidal communication with the James River. Upon the recession of the body of water, numerous woody stumps were revealed. We studied these stump remnants in an attempt to assess the spatial structure and vegetative community of this forested freshwater tidal wetland before perturbation. We began by obtaining a geospatial coordinate for each stump, and every 10 stumps a cross-sectional wood sample was taken. These samples underwent taxonomic identification as well as aging in the lab. During this ongoing study, over 4, 500 stumps have been geo-located and 413 samples have been processed. There were 15 unique species among 11 genera identified. The most abundant genus of trees was Fraxinus spp. (RD = 73. 24 %), and the next most abundant was <b>Carya</b> <b>spp.</b> (RD = 11. 79 %). The majority of the samples were of obligate or facultative wetland species (63. 1 %). We will soon compile the geospatial coordinates onto a GIS map and use the species data to better understand the native community. Recreating the natural historical vegetative community could help guide current restoration efforts in other locations in other mid-Atlantic formally impounded wetlands. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|Forested {{areas in}} the United States have been altered {{since the time of}} European settlement. For this reason, {{research}} interests have increased in comparing present day vegetation with that of the preEuroamerican era to see what changes, if any, have occurred in some of our more outstanding natural areas. Such studies have been conducted {{in other parts of the}} United States but limited research has been done in Arkansas. The General Land Office (GLO) surveys of Arkansas were originally conducted between approximately 1815 and 1850 shortly after Arkansas was acquired from France by means of the Louisiana Purchase and provides the only systematic on-ground survey in Arkansas that predates most formal botanical investigations. The GLO surveys used witness trees to define the location of section corners and lines. Descriptions of witness trees included tree species and diameter along with distance and direction to the section corner or line. This historical GLO data was compared to United States Forest Service (USFS) Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data, which represent present vegetation conditions for 62 townships in the Buffalo River Sub-basin. Comparisons indicated that eastern red cedar (Juniperus virginiana) increased from 0. 7 % to 7. 8 % of the total forest species in the sub-basin, hickory (<b>Carya</b> <b>spp.)</b> increased from 8. 2 % to 14. 3 %, while oak (Quercus spp.) species decreased from 43. 0 % to 30. 1 %.

40|$|Six water {{emergencies}} {{have occurred}} since 1981 for the New York City (NYC) region despite the following: 1) its perhumid climate, 2) substantial conservation of water since 1979, and 3) meteorological data showing little severe or extreme drought since 1970. This study reconstructs 472 years of moisture availability for the NYC watershed to place these emergencies in long-term hydroclimatic context. Using nested reconstruction techniques, 32 tree-ring chronologies comprised of 12 species account {{for up to}} 66. 2 % of the average May–August Palmer drought severity index. Verification statistics indicate good statistical skill from 1531 to 2003. The use of multiple tree species, including rarely used species that can sometimes occur on mesic sites like Liriodendron tulipifera, Betula lenta, and <b>Carya</b> <b>spp.,</b> seems to aid reconstruction skill. Importantly, the reconstruction captures pluvial events in the instrumental record nearly as well as drought events and is significantly correlated to precipitation {{over much of the}} northeastern United States. While the mid- 1960 s drought is a severe drought {{in the context of the}} new reconstruction, the region experienced repeated droughts of similar intensity, but greater duration during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The full record reveals a trend toward more pluvial conditions since ca. 1800 that is accentuated by an unprecedented 43 -yr pluvial event that continues through 2011. In the context of the current pluvial, decreasing water usage, but increasing extra-urban pressures, it appears that the water supply system for the greater NYC region could be severely stressed if the current water boom shifts toward hydroclimatic regimes like the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries...|$|E
30|$|These post-mining {{land uses}} were {{selected}} and established on 80  % to 90  % {{of the land}} reclaimed {{during the early years}} of SMCRA (early 1980 s and through the 1990 s). While much of the land was used by landowners as prescribed, many other lands reclaimed as hay land or pasture were not used by landowners for that purpose. Such lands were often left in an unused and unmanaged condition. When such lands were established with soils similar to the natural area, woody species would gradually invade by natural secondary succession if given sufficient time, especially where the reclaimed site was closely surrounded by native forest (Skousen et al. 2006). The succession process progresses through a series of pioneer and early-successional tree species such as red maple, black locust, black birch (Betula lenta L.), black cherry (Prunus serotina Ehrh.), autumn olive, crabapple (Prunus coronaria L.) and hawthorn (Crataegus spp.). Gradually, ash (Fraxinus spp.), yellow poplar, sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.), oak, hickory (<b>Carya</b> <b>spp.),</b> and other mid- to late-successional trees can become established in the understory and replace some of the early-successional trees. However, a more common outcome was for such lands to be left with compacted soils constructed with mine spoils that differed chemically from native soils and covered with dense herbaceous vegetation. Such lands did not return to native forest cover naturally even within several decades after mining (Angel et al. 2005; Zipper et al. 2011 a). Soil properties, vegetation established through reclamation, aspect, subsequent disturbance, local climate/weather patterns and wildlife are factors that influence the eventual plant community on unmanaged reclaimed mine lands.|$|E
40|$|Abstract-Reforestation {{of former}} {{bottomland}} hardwood forests {{that have been}} cleared for agriculture (i. e., afforestation) has historically emphasized planting heavy-seeded oaks (Quercus spp.) and pecans (<b>Carya</b> <b>spp.).</b> These species are slow to develop vertical forest structure. However, vertical forest structure is key to colonization of afforested sites by forest birds. Although early-successional tree species often enhance vertical structure, few of these species invade afforested sites that are distant from seed sources. Further-more, many land mangers are reluctant {{to establish and maintain}} stands of fast-growing plantation trees. Therefore, on 40 afforested bottomland sites, we supplemented heavy-seeded seedlings with 8 patches of fast-growing trees: 4 patches of 12 eastern cotton-wood (fopulus deltoides) stem cuttings and 4 patches of 12 American sycamore (Platanus occidentalis) seedlings. To enhance survival and growth, tree patches were subjected to 4 weed control treatments: (1) physical weed barriers, (2) chemical herbicide, (3) both physical and chemical weed control, or (4) no weed control. Overall, first-year survival of cottonwood and sycamore was 25 percent and 47 percent, respectively. Second-year survival of extant trees was 52 percent for cottonwood and 77 percent for sycamore. Physical weed barriers increased survival of cottonwoods to 30 percent versus 18 percent survival with no weed control. Similarly, sycamore survival was increased from 49 percent without weed control to 64 percent with physical weed barriers. Chemical weed control adversely impacted sycamore and reduced survival to 35 percent. Tree heights did not differ between species or among weed control treatments. Girdling of trees by deer often destroyed saplings. Thus, little increase in vertical structure was detected between growing seasons. Application of fertilizer and protection via tree shelters did not improve survival or vertical development of sycamore or cottonwood...|$|E
30|$|The overall {{trend in}} species {{composition}} {{in the region}} {{has been one of}} “mesophication” (Nowacki and Abrams 2008), the gradual replacement of shade intolerant, fire-adapted species (Pinus spp., Quercus spp., <b>Carya</b> <b>spp.)</b> with shade-tolerant, fire-sensitive species (Acer spp., Betula spp., Fagus grandifolia). While some argue that human influence and land use change have played the strongest role (Nowacki and Abrams 2015), others suggest that increasing precipitation over the last century is a primary driver of this tree species shift (Pederson et al. 2015). The prevailing argument for the former is that as Northeastern U.S. forests recovered from widespread forest clearing throughout the eighteenth and ninetieth centuries (Foster et al. 1998, Foster et al. 2010), fire suppression policies starting in the 1920 s to present day led to a “mesophication” of central hardwoods (i.e., oak-pine forests) that involved a compositional shift towards more pyrophobic species (Acer spp., F. grandifolia, Betula spp., Prunus serotina, Liriodendron tulipifera, Tsuga canadensis) and substantial losses of pyrophilic species (Quercus spp., Pinus spp., Castanea spp.). However, mesophication trends during the last century have also been attributed to recent increases in precipitation based on evidence of soil moisture limitations on tree establishment, growth, and survival, as well as consistent changes among historic climate and species composition (Pederson et al. 2015). The period of 1930 – 2005 was one of the wettest periods on record throughout most of the eastern USA (Pederson et al. 2015), which {{may have contributed to the}} recent mesophication. Ultimately, interactions between climate and land use change have likely contributed to shifts in species composition and point to a common hypothesis: the present mesophytic species will be especially vulnerable to future severe droughts, and consequently, Northeastern U.S. Forests may experience dramatic shifts in species composition with increasing drought frequency and intensity (Abrams and Nowacki 2016). However, evidence in support of this hypothesis is largely lacking, given the historical rarity of past droughts in the region, combined with a lack of targeted research on forest response to drought—a topic not traditionally considered relevant until only recently.|$|E
