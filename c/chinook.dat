5|$|Around {{the year}} 1850, the Kalapuya {{numbered}} between 2,000 and 3,000 and were distributed among several groups. These figures are only speculative; {{there may have}} been as few as eight subgroups or as many as 16. In that time period, the Clackamas' tribal population was roughly 1,800. The U.S. Census Bureau estimated that the <b>Chinook</b> population was nearly 5,000, though not all of the <b>Chinook</b> lived on the Willamette. The <b>Chinook</b> territory encompassed the lower Columbia River valley and significant stretches of the Pacific coast on both {{the north and the south}} side of the Columbia's mouth. At times, however, the <b>Chinook</b> territory extended even farther south in the Willamette Valley. The total native population was estimated at about 15,000.|$|E

5|$|Following their {{transfer}} to the Army, the <b>Chinooks</b> were used in similar roles to those they had undertaken in RAAF service. The first operational deployment of the Army <b>Chinooks</b> began in October 1997, when two of the helicopters and three Black Hawks which were in Papua New Guinea {{as part of a}} training exercise were tasked with delivering food supplies to the highlands of the country following a severe drought. The <b>Chinooks</b> were also used to transport fuel supplies for the other ADF aircraft and helicopters involved in this effort. At this time, the deployment of two <b>Chinooks</b> was the largest the Army could undertake as the other helicopters were undergoing maintenance or were needed for training purposes. The <b>Chinooks</b> returned to Australia in March 1998.|$|R

5|$|The <b>Chinook</b> {{became a}} vital transit tool during the 1991 Gulf War in Iraq. They {{were used for}} moving troops into the region {{at the start of}} the conflict; a <b>Chinook</b> was used on 22 January 1991 to {{transport}} a Special Air Service (SAS) patrol on the infamous Bravo Two Zero mission. In the aftermath of the conflict as many as nine British Chinooks delivered food and supplies to thousands of Kurdish refugees from Iraq.|$|E
5|$|UK <b>Chinook</b> {{procurement}} ambitions were revived in 1978 with an announced {{requirement for}} a new heavy-lift helicopter to replace the Westland Wessex. Thirty Chinooks were ordered at a price of US$200 million. These helicopters, comparable to the CH-47C with Lycoming T55-L-11E engines, were again designated <b>Chinook</b> HC Mk1, and entered service in December 1980. Eight more Mk1s were delivered from 1984 to 1986 with the CH-47D's Lycoming T55-L-712 turboshafts.|$|E

5|$|<b>Chinook</b> Pass is {{the border}} between Pierce and Yakima {{counties}} and Mount Rainier National Park and the Wenatchee National Forest. The pass is also where the highway crosses the Pacific Crest Trail, a National Scenic Trail that was completed in 1993.

After a junction with {{the other end of}} the proposed SR168, named Little Naches Road, the highway exits the Wenatchee National Forest and enters Naches. The byway ends at US12 in Naches near the Naches Selah Canal.|$|E

5|$|The Trinity River {{was once}} {{known for its}} {{prolific}} anadromous fish (salmon, steelhead and sturgeon) runs. The actual number of fish returning to the river each year to spawn, prior to European settlement, is uncertain {{due to the lack}} of records. During the first half of the 20th century, before damming, the fall <b>chinook</b> salmon run was estimated at anywhere between 19,000 and 75,500. The spring <b>chinook</b> and coho salmon runs were about 10,000 each and the annual steelhead run was about 50,000.|$|E

5|$|The bridge {{ends in the}} {{community}} of Greenwater, named for the river, where the roadway encounters Forest Road70, which has been proposed to become SR168 over Naches Pass {{as an alternative to the}} <b>Chinook</b> Scenic Byway. From Greenwater, the road travels south alongside the White River into Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest, passing Ranger Creek State Airport, a state-owned airport that is open in the summer and early fall. The byway travels south into Mount Rainier National Park. SR 410 is closed at the gate to Morse Creek, about 5 miles east of the <b>Chinook</b> Pass Summit during the winter and early spring due to high wind, limited cell service and avalanche danger. It intersects SR123 at Cayuse Pass. SR410 turns east at the intersection and heads through a series of hairpin turns, passing Tipsoo Lake, to <b>Chinook</b> Pass.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} fish inhabiting the river include <b>Chinook</b> salmon, {{threatened}} coho salmon, and rainbow trout. Fish populations are declining, however, due to low {{water quality and}} barriers such as dams and culverts.|$|E
5|$|The river {{supported}} species including <b>chinook</b> salmon, coho salmon, and sockeye salmon, {{as well as}} steelhead, white sturgeon, and Pacific lamprey. It {{is known}} that before the construction of dams on the river, there were three major <b>chinook</b> salmon runs in the Snake River; in the spring, summer and fall, totaling about 120,000fish, and the sockeye salmon run was about 150,000. The historical barrier to fish migration on the Snake River was Shoshone Falls, a waterfall that occurs as the Snake River passes through the Snake River Plain.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Chinooks</b> have mainly {{been used}} to support Army units in Australian service, though they have {{performed}} {{a wide range of}} other tasks. Three <b>Chinooks</b> took part in the Iraq War during 2003, when they supported Australian special forces. A detachment of two <b>Chinooks</b> was also deployed to Afghanistan during the northern spring and summer months for each year between 2006 and 2013, when they saw extensive combat. Two of the CH-47s deployed to Afghanistan were destroyed as a result of crashes.|$|R
50|$|Control of {{the core}} {{breeding}} stock passed from Walden to Julia Lombard and from her to Perry Greene in the late 1940s. Greene, a noted outdoorsman, bred <b>Chinooks</b> in Waldoboro, Maine, for many years {{until his death in}} 1963. Rare and closely held by Greene who was for many years the only breeder of <b>Chinooks,</b> the population dwindled rapidly after his death. By 1981 only eleven breedable <b>Chinooks</b> survived. Breeders in Maine, Ohio and California divided the remaining stock and managed to save the type from extinction.|$|R

5|$|There are 26 {{species of}} native and {{introduced}} {{fish in the}} lower Central Valley portion of the river, including Sacramento sucker, smallmouth bass, largemouth bass and carp. Anadromous fish species found in the lower river are <b>chinook</b> salmon, Pacific lamprey and striped bass. The upper section of the river, defined as the stretch from Lake McClure to the headwaters, has 11 species of fish. Historically, the range of anadromous fish extended to the waterfalls {{at the head of}} Yosemite Valley, but dams have blocked their migration since the early 1900s, and diversions frequently dewater their remaining spawning habitat in {{the lower part of the}} river. Environmental measures enacted in the late 20th century have had some success in boosting <b>chinook</b> salmon populations, from a record low of 500 fish during several years in the 1950s, to a high of 30,000 in 1984. Since the 1970s, the annual <b>chinook</b> run has averaged about 5,300.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{low water}} quality, the Little Applegate {{watershed}} supports populations of coho and <b>Chinook</b> salmon, along with 138 known and 134 suspected species of other vertebrates.

5|$|Fishing {{is limited}} to the lower reaches of the river.
