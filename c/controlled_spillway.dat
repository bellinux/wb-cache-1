40|$|Abstract- The {{purpose of}} this paper is to design a {{simulation}} system of fuzzy logic controller for Hydro-Electric Power Dam Control by using simulation package which is Fuzzy Logic Toolbox and Simulink in MATLAB software. By doing some modification of this paper, the design will be very useful for the system relates to liquid level control that widely use in industry nowadays. In this paper, we used the liquid level in tank, and use MATLAB to design a Fuzzy Control. The control of liquid level and flow between tanks is a basic problem in the process industries. Measuring the flow of liquids is a critical need in many industrial plants. Designers can realize lower development costs, superior features, and better end product performance by using fuzzy logic. Fuzzy Logic controller has better stability, small overshoot, and fast response. The paper presents Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) method for safe reservoir control of dams through spillway gates and it presents FLC method for turbine valve to control the water flow through turbine for hydro power generation. Thus it shows overall effective control and operation of the mechanical equipments in a hydro electric power generation project with FLC and its usefulness. Dam control system takes information about water level, gate opening ratios, gate operation as parameters and <b>controls</b> <b>spillway</b> in case of flooding. In this design two input parameters: water level and flow rate and two output parameters: release valve control and drain valve control are used...|$|R
