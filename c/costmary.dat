Most knot gardens now have edges made from box (Buxus sempervirens), whose leaves have a sweet smell when bruised. The paths in between are usually laid with fine gravel. However, the original designs of knot gardens did not have the low box hedges, and knot gardens with such hedges might more accurately be called parterres.|$|E
5000|$|The plant {{seems to}} have {{originated}} in the Mediterranean. It is unclear whether the plant called [...] "balsamita" [...] described by Columella in 70 AD is the same. According to Heinrich Marzell, it was first mentioned in 812 in a plant catalogue. <b>Costmary</b> was widely grown since the medieval times in herb gardens until the late 19th and early 20th centuries for medical purposes. Nowadays it has mostly disappeared in Europe, but is still widely used in southwest Asia. It was used in medieval times as a place marker in Bibles. It is referred to by Nicholas Culpeper as the 'balsam herb'.|$|E
50|$|From a {{utilitarian}} standpoint, {{vegetable and}} herb gardens helped provide both alimentary and medicinal crops, {{which could be}} used to feed or treat the monks and, in some cases, the outside community. As detailed in the plans for St. Gall, these gardens were laid out in rectangular plots, with narrow paths between them to facilitate collection of yields. Often these beds were surrounded with wattle fencing to prevent animals from entry. In the kitchen gardens, fennel, cabbage, onion, garlic, leeks, radishes, and parsnips might be grown, as well as peas, lentils and beans if space allowed for them. The infirmary gardens could contain Rosa gallica ("The Apothecary Rose"), savory, <b>costmary,</b> fenugreek, rosemary, peppermint, rue, iris, sage, bergamot, mint, lovage, fennel and cumin, amongst other herbs.|$|E
5000|$|... 17th century herbalist Nicholas Culpeper says of costmary:"It {{is under}} the {{dominion}} of Jupiter. The ordinary <b>costmary,</b> as well as maudlin, provokes urine abundantly, and softens the hardness of the mother; it gently purgeth choler and phlegm, extenuating that which is gross, and cutting that which is tough and glutinous, cleanseth that which is foul, and prevents putrefaction it openeth obstructions and relieves their bad effects, and it is beneficial {{in all sorts of}} dry agues. It is astringent to the stomach, and strengtheneth the livers other viscera : and taken in whey, worketh more effectively. Taken fasting in the morning, it relieves chronic pains in the head, and to stay, dry up, and consume all their rheums or distillations from the head into the stomach, a much to digest raw humours gathered therein, It is profitable for those that are fallen into a continual evil disposition of the body, called cachexy, especially in beginning of the disease. It is good for weak and cold livers. The seed is given to children for worms, and so is the infusion of flowers in white wine, about two ounces at a time. It maketh an excellent salve to heal old ulcers, being boiled with oil of olive, and adder's tongue with it; and after is strained, put in a little wax, rosin, and turpentine to make it as thick as required." ...|$|E
50|$|Confidence {{and musical}} {{competence}} {{of a high}} order were prompt {{to appear in the}} opening varnam itself and “Chalame (Nattaikurinchi), beautiful in its first movement, saw the familiar trick of acceleration of pace in its final sections very successfully employed by these boys. “Sri Mahaganapatim” (Gowlai) came through arresting with the <b>costmary</b> rhythmic gait variations in the chittaswaras. Kamboji was courageously taken up by Ganesh for the first raga venture of the evening and it was well built up blending delicacy of musical line with forceful passages that made sure of impact. All the needed virtuosity was there. The piece played in Kambhoji was “Sri Subramanyaya” the rendition was good and the swara round were well mounted to lead to a calculated applause winning finale. Particularly endearing was the playing of little Kumaresh whose violin appeared bigger than him and whose precise Swara contributions were made without any ado. More cutcheri worthy fare came in “Varanaradha” in “Vijayashri”, the popular Bhavayami Raghuramam and “Dasarathe” (Todi)….” Yet younger in age and size Ganesh and Kumaresh were so babyish and pint sized that they could not see even the finger board of the violin, while they held it in the sitting position. The music they produced was like veterans. That was the reason they could easily come to the forefront. There were senior Maestros and veterans in the field ruling the roost who were rather striding the field of music as colossus.|$|E
40|$|The sweet, minty-lemony {{leaves of}} <b>costmary</b> (Chrysanthemum balsamita) {{are used for}} salads and tea, and as {{flavourings}} in meats, sausages, cakes and ale. In this study, the extracts isolated from <b>costmary</b> aerial parts were investigated as antioxidants in rapeseed oil and as free radical-scavengers in DPPH and ABTS(+) assays. It was found that <b>costmary</b> extracts and their fractions were weak antioxidants in rapeseed oil; however, some fractions were active in scavenging synthetic free radicals. Crude methanol-water extract, its tertbutyl methyl ether and butanol fractions were the most effective in DPPH assay by scavenging 87. 0 %, 86. 9 % and 86. 4 % of radicals present in the reaction, respectively. Several active compounds were detected in these fractions, using HPLC with on-line radical-scavenging detection. After multi-step fractionation of these fractions, four radical-scavenging constituents were isolated and their properties were assessed by DPPH (antiradical power, ARP, calculated as an inverse value of the effective concentration, 1 /EC 50) and ABTS(+) (Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity, TEAC(6 min)) free radical-scavenging assays. The following structures were elucidated by NMR and MS: 5 -O-caffeoylquinic acid (ARP = 3. 85 : TEAC(6 min) = 0. 60), 3, 5 -O-dicaffeoylquinic acid (ARP = 6. 25 : TEAC(6 min) = 1. 16), 5, 7, 4 '-trihydroxy- 3 ', 8 -dimethoxyflavone (ARP = 0. 03) and 5, 7, 3 ', 4 '-tetrahydroxy- 3, 8 -dimethoxyflavonol (ARP = 3. 79; TEAC(6 min) = 1. 50) ...|$|E
40|$|Food {{products}} {{are susceptible to}} oxidation processes. Oxidation of lipids (fat) is the major cause of food deterioration however also proteins and carbohydrates can be affected. To prevent or retard this process, antioxidants are used. With regard to foods, more and more natural {{products are}} preferred by consumers so new natural sources of compounds able to retard oxidation processes and prevent spoilage of food products are continuously investigated. The research described {{in this study is}} aimed at the evaluation of several herbs as possible sources of food antioxidants. An initial screening of extracts from roman camomile, tansy, sweet grass, <b>costmary,</b> sea-buckthorn and sage for antioxidant activity in rapeseed oil has been performed Sweet grass and sage acetone extracts retarded oxidation processes in oil best. Sweet grass was chosen for further investigation as the herb having the highest antioxidant activity. Two other herbs, namely horehound and <b>costmary</b> were further selected for the evaluation of their antioxidant activity in different assays. At first preliminary fractionation of the selected herb extracts was performed. Fractions were tested in three different assays: -carotene oxidation, DPPH• reduction and rapeseed oil oxidation. The experiments did not provide any straightforward answers, which fractions contained the most active antioxidants. Different assays gave different results. More polar fractions were more active in model systems like DPPH• while in the edible oil assay these fractions acted as weak antioxidants, or some even exhibited a prooxidation effect. Acetone extracts performed better than methanol-water extracts in retarding oil oxidation probably due to their higher compatibility with the medium or the more non-polar nature of the contained analytes. In further steps the structures of the radical scavenging compounds present in extracts of sweet grass, horehound and <b>costmary</b> were elucidated. Two compounds, namely 5, 8 -dihydroxybenzopyranone and 5 -hydroxy- 8 -O--D-glucopyranosyl benzopyranone were isolated and identified from sweet grass extract. Both compounds were identified {{for the first time as}} natural products. Four compounds, namely 5 -O-caffeoyl quinic acid (chlorogenic acid), 3, 5 -dicaffeoyl quinic acid, 5, 7, 4 '-trihydroxy- 3 ', 8 -dimethoxy flavone and 5, 7, 3 ', 4 '-tetrahydroxy- 3, 8 -dimethoxyflavonol were identified in <b>costmary</b> extracts. These compounds are quite common in plant kingdom. However, they have not previously been isolated from <b>costmary.</b> Five compounds, namely 5, 8 -dihydroxy- 7, 4 -dimethoxy flavone, 7 -O--glucopyranosyl luteolin, 7 -O--glucuronyl luteolin, verbascoside and forsythoside B were isolated from horehound extracts. These compounds are common in the Labiatae family. Their radical scavenging activity was measured using DPPH• and ABTS•+ scavenging assays and compared with the activity of rosmarinic acid and Trolox. An on-line HPLC-DPPH-DAD-NMR system for the rapid identification of compounds in complex mixtures was developed. The developed system was tested on commercial rosemary extract and six compounds were identified without the need to isolate them. This proved that simultaneous detection and identification of radical scavengers is possible. Several solvents, namely hexane, acetone ant ethanol and their combinations were tested for their suitability to extract all known radical scavengers from sweet grass, <b>costmary</b> and horehound. It was found that initial extraction of the plant material with hexane increased the concentrations of radical scavengers in the following extraction stages...|$|E
40|$|The {{compositions}} of {{the essential}} oil and the aromatic water of <b>costmary</b> (Balsamita suaveolens Pers.) cultivated in Tuscany were investigated. They represent the main ingredients of some traditional preparations sold commercially. The essential oil as such and the n-hexane extract of the aromatic water were analyzed by GC and GC-MS. Both samples {{were found to be}} rich in monoterpenes. Eighty-five compounds were identified, accounting for 95. 1 and 95. 4 % {{of the essential}} oil and n-hexane extract of aromatic water, respectively. Carvone was the main compound (43. 5 % in the essential oil and 74. 9 % in the n-hexane extract of aromatic water). In addition, solid phase microextraction was used to sample the volatile organic compounds emitted from the fresh plant and from the aromatic water, and carvone was again the main component, amounting to 46. 2 and 41. 3 %, respectively...|$|E
40|$|The {{essential}} oils from leaves and flowers of <b>costmary,</b> Balsamita major (L.) Desf. (syn. Chrysanthemum balsamita L.), were analyzed at various phases of plant growth. The highest contents of oil both in leaves and in flowers were determined before full blooming, 1. 15 and 1. 34 øw/w), respectively. Seventy-eight volatile compounds {{have been identified}} in the oils of Balsamita major, of which 58 (19 tentatively, 39 positively) have not been reported in this plant previously. Carvone and -thujone were found to be dominating compounds constituting from 51. 8 to 68. 0 nd from 9. 0 to 16. 1 ␒n the total oil, respectively. Seasonal variations in the oil compositions were not considerable except for the starting phase (May 25, 1995), when the content of carvone was lower and the content of -thujone and sesquiterpenes higher. The content of sesquiterpenes was ~ 2 times higher in flowers than in the leaves. Absolute amount of most components was highest at the bud formation period...|$|E
