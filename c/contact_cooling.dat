The {{definitive}} version: JAY and HAVENITH (2004) Finger skin cooling on {{contact with}} cold materials: {{a comparison between}} male and female responses during short-term exposures. European Journal of Applied Physiology, 91 (4), pp. 373 - 381 is available at: springerlink. metapress. com/openurl. asp?genre=journal&issn= 1439 - 6319. This study investigates the independent effects of hand anthropometry and gender upon <b>contact</b> <b>cooling</b> responses. Subjects were selected for matching hand/finger size between genders, with equal variation between individuals of each group. Fourteen volunteers (7 male, 7 female) participated, touching blocks of aluminium and stainless steel using the first phalanx of the index finger with a contact force of 1. 0 N and 9. 8 N, at surface temperatures of – 2 °C and – 10 °C. Conditions were selected in order to elicit varying rates of skin cooling upon contact. Contact temperature (TC) of the finger-pad was measured over time using a T-type thermocouple. Overall, no significant difference was found between the cooling responses of males and females. In order to investigate whether differences in hand anthropometry correlated with <b>contact</b> <b>cooling</b> response, a multiple regression approach was used. Analyses of the residual variance in <b>contact</b> <b>cooling</b> data after the effects of material type, surface temperature and finger contact force had been accounted for, showed that, under slow cooling conditions (over 45 seconds to reach TC = 1 °C), hand size correlated significantly with <b>contact</b> <b>cooling</b> response only when represented by index finger volume (p< 0. 05), and gender did not. Whilst under fast cooling conditions (below 25 seconds to reach TC = 1 °C), hand size did not correlate significantly with <b>contact</b> <b>cooling</b> response at all, but gender had a significant effect (p< 0. 001). Under slow cooling conditions, a larger finger (and most cases hands) provides a higher heat content thus giving a slower skin cooling speed. Under fast cooling conditions, the significantly longer time required for males to reach a TC of 1 °C despite matching hand and finger size is attributed to higher epidermal insulation provided by the thicker stratum corneum typically found in males, combined with the higher starting skin temperature observed in the “slightly cool” environment...|$|E
40|$|Background: Although {{monopolar}} radiofrequency {{treatment is}} effective in the improvement of skin laxity, the pain and cost {{that are associated with}} this method suggest the need for alternative treatment options. Recently, an infrared device with <b>contact</b> <b>cooling</b> {{has been shown to be}} effective in the treatment of skin laxity, with ultrastructural changes observed that are similar to those that are observed following treatment with a monopolar radiofrequency device. However, no control was included in previous studies. Objective: To conduct a prospective, split-face, single-blinded study to look at the efficacy and complications among Asians of treatment for skin tightening with an infrared device with <b>contact</b> <b>cooling.</b> Method: Thirteen Chinese women were treated. An infrared device with <b>contact</b> <b>cooling</b> (Titan, Cutera, Brisbane, CA) was used to treat one side of the face and the untreated side served as the control. The treatment was performed twice with a 4 -week interval between the treatments and the patients were followed up by subjective assessment using a structured questionnaire 1 and 3 months after the second (and last) treatment. In all cases, pre- and post-treatment clinical photographs were taken. Two independent observers assessed the photographs. Results: Twenty-three percentage of patients reported mild improvement, 15 % reported moderate improvement, and 54 % reported significant improvement 3 months after their second (and last) treatment. In terms of objective assessment, 41 % of patients were identified to have some degree of improvement of the treated side 3 months after their second treatment. Compared with the untreated side, the treated side improved significantly (P = 0. 031) at 1 and 3 months after the second treatment. Blistering occurred in one patient, which had resolved completely by the 3 -month follow-up visit.

40|$|Background and Objective: Skin cooling is used {{to protect}} the epider-mis {{in a variety of}} laser {{dermatology}} procedures, including leg vein treatment, hair removal, and port wine stain removal. Spray and con-tact cooling are the two most popular methods, but similarities and differences of these techniques are not well understood. Study Design/Materials and Methods: A theoretical model of skin cool-ing is presented for two different regimens: “soft ” cooling in which freezing of the skin is not permitted and “hard ” cooling in which the skin can be frozen to a given depth. Spray and <b>contact</b> <b>cooling</b> were also compared experimentally using an in vitro model. Results: For a fixed skin surface temperature, spray and contact cool-ing theoretically produce the same cooling profile in the skin. Anatomic depth of cooling depends on the time for which either the spray or contact is applied. In vitro experiments caused temperature at the simulated basal layer to be between − 5 and + 5 °C for both spray (tetra-fluoroethane, boiling point − 26 °C) and contact (− 27 °C sapphire plate) cooling. The theoretical precooling analysis shows hard mode to be faster and more selective than soft mode; however, cooling time for hard mode must be carefully controlled to prevent irreversible epider-mal damage caused by freezing. Conclusions: Both spray and <b>contact</b> <b>cooling</b> provide efficient skin cool-ing.

50|$|The main {{disadvantage}} of direct impingement {{is that the}} breech of the firearm's firing mechanism becomes fouled more quickly due to being exposed to the propellants of the cartridge.
