40|$|Embedment of {{resistive}} heating {{elements in a}} <b>cordwood</b> <b>module</b> used for packaging electronic components, facilitates separation of the adhesive bond between the module, and metal heat sink and the potting material without damaging the components. Electrical power applied to the elements causes breakdown of bonding material...|$|E
40|$|Formulas, {{which can}} be used as a design tool, are derived to {{calculate}} the thermal resistance of solder-boss/potting compound combinations, for different depths of a solder boss, in electronic <b>cordwood</b> <b>modules.</b> Since the solder boss is the heat source, its shape and position will affect the thermal resistance of the surrounding potting compound...|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: A CDC 6600 <b>cordwood</b> logic <b>module</b> {{containing}} 64 silicon transistors. The coaxial connectors are test points. The module is cooled conductively via {{the front}} panel. The 6600 model contained nearly 6,000 such modules.|$|R
50|$|Over {{the years}} {{there were several}} versions. The {{original}} 1700 was constructed using air-cooled CDC 6600-like <b>cordwood</b> logic <b>modules</b> and core memory, although later models used different technology. The final models, called Cyber-18, added four general-purpose registers {{and a number of}} instructions to support a time-sharing operating system.|$|R
50|$|This {{would be}} Univacâ€™s first {{computer}} {{to use the}} monolithic flatpack integrated circuit, using a DTL (Diode-Transistor Logic) silicon chip. This technology was simultaneously being developed {{for use in the}} Univac 1824 for the missile guidance program. It was also their first computer to lay the electronics flat, on a Printed Circuit card, instead of on-end like the <b>cordwood</b> block electronics <b>modules,</b> (Burndy packs).|$|R
40|$|A {{description}} is given {{of a wide}} dynamic range pulse height analyzer system developed for use on High Energy Cosmic Ray Experiment (HECRE) Balloon Flights. A wide dynamic range of 100, 000 is obtained by extending the range of a basic 1024 channel analyzer {{through the use of}} multiple ranges and range selection. The system described here contains four 100, 000 pulse height analyzers. Each 100, 000 pulse height analyzer consists of a group of <b>cordwood</b> welded <b>modules</b> mounted and interconnected on a printed circuit card. Four of these card assemblies, the required clock drive circuitry (discrete components mounted and interconnected on a separate card) and three input-output connectors are interconnected and mounted on the system board...|$|R
