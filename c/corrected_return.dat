The Speaker made a ruling on June 18, 2013, {{in response to a}} question of privilege, to have the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs (PROC) review this issue. On February 5, 2014, Bezan and Elections Canada came to an agreement on a corrected campaign return. In a statement on his website, he said: I am pleased to say that Elections Canada has agreed with the commercial value of my MP signs I submitted in my corrected campaign return on May 5, 2013 at $518 per sign. My final campaign return for the 2011 election is below the allowable election expense limit, and my personal contributions are also below the allowable limit.

40|$|In {{this work}} {{we present a}} new {{reinforcement}} learning agent, called Reactor (for Retrace-actor), based on an off-policy multi-step return actor-critic architecture. The agent uses a deep recurrent neural network for function approximation. The network outputs a target policy π (the actor), an action-value Q-function (the critic) evaluating the current policy π, and an estimated behavioral policy μ̂ which we use for off-policy correction. The agent maintains a memory buffer filled with past experiences. The critic is trained by the multi-step off-policy Retrace algorithm and the actor is trained by a novel β-leave-one-out policy gradient estimate (which uses both the off-policy <b>corrected</b> <b>return</b> and the estimated Q-function). The Reactor is sample-efficient thanks {{to the use of}} memory replay, and numerical efficient since it uses multi-step returns. Also both acting and learning can be parallelized. We evaluated our algorithm on 57 Atari 2600 games and demonstrate that it achieves state-of-the-art performance...|$|E
40|$|This study exposes a {{comparative}} {{treatment of the}} private returns to education in Palestine and Turkey over the period 2004 - 2008. Comparable data, similar definitions and same methodology {{are used in the}} estimations. The estimates are provided first for average returns to education second for returns at different levels of schooling and finally for returns by different sectors of employment. The results suggest that returns to schooling are higher for Turkey at the various levels of education for females and males and for both years 2004 and 2008. It is believed that the relative size of the Palestinian economy and the uniqueness of subjugation to military occupation contribute greatly to this result. In 2008, returns are lower than 2004 levels for all levels of education; the pattern is less obvious for Turkey across the various levels. However, the 2008 crisis seems to have influenced the more educated more severely (MA and above) in both countries. Female returns to education are higher for women than men in both countries; the gender gap has worsened in 2008, but more so for Palestine. The median ratio of male to female return is 0. 55 (university) in 2004 and decreased to 0. 17 (high school) in 2008 in Palestine. The corresponding figures for Turkey are 0. 79 and. 082 (both for high school).

40|$|Self-selected {{migration}} presents {{one potential}} {{explanation for why}} observed returns to a college education in local labor markets vary widely even though U. S. workers are highly mobile. To {{assess the impact of}} self-selection on estimated returns, this paper first develops a Roy model of mobility and earnings where workers choose in which of the 50 states (plus the District of Columbia) to live and work. Available estimation methods are either infeasible for a selection model with so many alternatives or place potentially severe restrictions on earnings and the selection process. This paper develops an alternative econometric methodology that combines Lee's (1983) parametric maximum order statistic approach to reduce the dimensionality of the error terms with more recent work on semiparametric estimation of selection models (e. g., Ahn and Powell (1993)). The resulting semiparametric correction is easy to implement and can be adapted to a variety of other polychotomous choice problems. The empirical work, which uses 1990 U. S. Census data, confirms the role of comparative advantage in mobility decisions. The results suggest that self-selection of higher educated individuals to states with higher returns to education generally leads to "upward" biases in OLS estimates of the returns to education in state-specific labor markets. While the estimated returns to a college education are significantly biased, correcting for the bias does not narrow the range of returns across states. Consistent with the finding that the <b>corrected</b> <b>return</b> to a college education differs across the U. S., the relative state-to-state migration flows of college- versus high school-educated individuals respond strongly to differences in the return to education and amenities across states.

Furthermore, the laser pulse intensity has been widely exploited to analyze and classify rocks and biomass, and for carbon storage estimation. In general, a laser beam is emitted, collides with targets and only a percentage of emitted beam returns according to intrinsic properties of each target. Also, due interferences and partial collisions, the laser return intensity can be incorrect, introducing serious errors in classification and/or estimation processes. To address this problem and avoid misclassification and estimation errors, we have proposed a new algorithm to <b>correct</b> <b>return</b> intensity for laser scanning sensors.

40|$|Radar power {{returned}} from the basal interface along a 42 km long profile over an ice-rise promontory and the adjacent Roi Baudouin ice shelf, Dronning Maud Land, East Antarctica, is analyzed to infer spatial variations in basal reflectivity and hence the basal environment. Extracting basal reflectivity from basal returned power requires an englacial attenuation model. We estimate attenuation in two ways: (1) using a temperature-dependent model with input from thermomechanical ice-flow models; and (2) using a radar method that linearly approximates the geometrically <b>corrected</b> <b>returned</b> power with ice thickness. The two methods give different results. We argue that attenuation calculated using a modeled temperature profile is more robust than the widely used radar method, especially in locations where depth-averaged attenuation varies spatially or where the patterns of basal reflectivity correlate with the patterns of the ice thickness. © 2012 Publishing Technology.

40|$|Return {{temporal}} anticipation on {{the basis}} of the ball trajectory estimation Abstract Ball-hitting in tennis involves spatio-temporal information about the ball's flight trajectory. We have focused on the temporal part of the information during returning a tennis serve that was simulated by a ball machine. The tested people had occlusion glasses placed on their head, which occluded their vision at the exact time, when the ball was being sent from the ball machine. The tested person did not know which part of the ball flight trajectory would be occluded, nor the ball speed. We examined the effect of part ball flight trajectory occlusion on the <b>correct</b> <b>return</b> timing of the ball. The analysis revealed that the greatest problems occurred while the second third of the ball flight trajectory had been occluded and reached most temporal errors at that time.
