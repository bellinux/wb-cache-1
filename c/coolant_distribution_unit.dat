40|$|When an {{integral}} {{pressurized water reactor}} is operated under low power conditions, once-through steam generator group operation strategy is applied. However, group operation strategy will cause nonuniform <b>coolant</b> flow <b>distribution</b> at the core inlet and lower plenum. To help coolant flow mix more uniformly, a flow mixing chamber (FMC) has been designed. In this paper, computational fluid dynamics methods {{have been used to}} investigate the <b>coolant</b> <b>distribution</b> by the effect of FMC. Velocity and temperature characteristics under different low power conditions and optimized FMC configuration have been analyzed. The results illustrate that the FMC can help improve the nonuniform <b>coolant</b> temperature <b>distribution</b> at the core inlet effectively; at the same time, the FMC will induce more resistance in the downcomer and lower plenum...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA newly {{developed}} flat heat pipe FGHPTM (Morex Kiire Co.) was experimentally investigated by using neutron radiography. The test {{sample of the}} FGHP heat spreader was 65 × 65 × 2 mm 3 composed of several etched copper plates and pure water {{was used as the}} coolant. Neutron radiography was performed at the E- 2 port of the Kyoto University Research Reactor (KUR). The <b>coolant</b> <b>distributions</b> in the wick area of the FGHP and its heat transfer characteristics were measured at heating conditions. Experimental results show that the <b>coolant</b> <b>distributions</b> depend slightly on its installation posture and that the liquid thickness in the wick region remains constant with increasing heat input to the FGHP. In addition, it is found that the wick surface does not dry out even in the vertical posture at present experimental conditions...|$|R

40|$|Table 1 {{illustrates}} {{the impact of}} different <b>distribution</b> <b>unit</b> sizes, different screen resolutions, and numbers of GPU nodes. We use two and four GPUs (NVIDIA Quadro 5000 with 2. 5 GB memory) and a mouse cortex EM dataset (see Figure 2) of resolution 21, 494 x 25, 790 x 1, 850 = 955 GB. The size of the virtual <b>distribution</b> <b>units</b> significantly influences the data distribution between nodes. Small <b>distribution</b> <b>units</b> result in a high depth complexity for compositing. Large <b>distribution</b> <b>units</b> lead to a low utilization of GPUs, because in the worst case only a single <b>distribution</b> <b>unit</b> will be in view, which is rendered by only a single node. The choice of an optimal <b>distribution</b> <b>unit</b> size depends on three major factors: the output screen resolution, the block cache size on each node, {{and the number of}} nodes. Currently, we are working on optimizing the compositing step and network communication between nodes. © 2011 IEEE...|$|R

The deterministic approach {{is composed of}} data envelopment analysis (DEA), principal component analysis (PCA) and correlation techniques. Seventeen electricity <b>distribution</b> <b>units</b> have been considered {{for the purpose of}} this study. Previous studies have generally used input-output DEA models for benchmarking and evaluation of electricity <b>distribution</b> <b>units.</b> However, this study considers an integrated deterministic DEA-PCA approach since the DEA model should be verified and validated by a robust multivariate methodology such as PCA. Moreover, the DEA models are verified and validated by PCA, Spearman and Kendall's Tau correlation techniques, while previous studies do not have the verification and validation features. Also, both input- and output-oriented DEA models are used for sensitivity analysis of the input and output variables. Finally, this is the first study to present an integrated deterministic approach for assessment and optimization of power distributions in Iran.

40|$|Sufficient atomic power {{generation}} safety increase may {{be done with}} microfuel adapting to reactor plants with water coolant. Microfuel particle is a millimeter size grain containing fission material core in a protecting coverage. The coverage protects fuel contact with coolant and provides isolation of fission products inside. Well thermophysical properties of microfuel bed in a direct contact with water coolant excludes fuel overheating when accidents. Microfuel use was suggested for a VVER, а direct flow reactor for superheat steam generation, a reactor with neutron spectra adjustment by the steam partial content varying in the coolant. Nonuniformities of two-phase <b>coolant</b> <b>distribution</b> in a heat generating particles bed are predicted by calculations in this text. The one is due to multiple-valuedness of pressure drop across the bed on the steam quality dependency. The nonuniformity decreases with flow rate and particle size growths absolute pressure diminishing while porosity effect is weak. The worse case is for pressure quality of order of one. Some pure steam filled pores appears parallel to steam water mixture filled pores, latter steam quality {{is less than the}} mean of the bed. Considering this regime for the direct flow reactor for superheat steam generation we predict some water drops at the exit flow. The two-phase coolant filtration with subcooled water feed is unstable to strong disturbance effects are found. Uniformity of two-phase <b>coolant</b> <b>distribution</b> is worse than for one-phase in the same radial type reactor. </p...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the cost {{structure of the}} French electricity distribution sector prior to the re-structuring reforms that have been initiated in 2005 and gradually implemented {{in the form of}} re-grouping certain activities across <b>distribution</b> <b>units.</b> The aim {{of this study is to}} assess the empirical evidence in support of these re-structuring measures. We explore the cost structure of the <b>distribution</b> <b>units</b> operating in France over the three year period. The data include 279 observations from 93 <b>distribution</b> <b>units</b> from 2003 to 2005, operating within the French electricity distribution network namely, Electricité Réseau Distribution France (ERDF). A Cobb-Douglas cost function is estimated using several specifications focusing on the analysis of the economies of scale and customer density. In order to account for the unobserved heterogeneity and its impacts on the economies of scale, we use a latent class specification. The results suggest that a majority of the <b>distribution</b> <b>units</b> can exploit statistically significant economies of scale. Further, the empirical analysis indicates that the unexploited economies of scale can vary considerably from one unit to another, not only because of variations in outputs but also because of the unobserved differences in networks and technological characteristics. In particular, the latent class approach can identify a group of <b>distribution</b> <b>units</b> that do not show any significant economies of scale. Further analysis suggests that such distributors are often located in metropolitan areas with high customer density. ...|$|R

40|$|The cooling of rotor shrouds in {{the first}} stage of a {{high-pressure}} turbine requires special attention as flatter turbine inlet temperature profiles and more highly loaded blades result in increased thermal and mechanical stresses. The use of film cooling and/or internal convective cooling makes the rotor shroud heavier and oversized, restricting the maximum rotational speed. Alternative methods are therefore sought to achieve improved cooling of the shroud. This paper discusses the low speed experimental investigation of two `passive' cooling concepts known as `rail cooling' and `platform cooling'. It has been shown experimentally that the modified cooling method, namely the platform cooling, substantially improves the rotor shroud <b>coolant</b> <b>distribution</b> in the critical areas whilst employing significantly lower amounts of coolant...|$|R

Their relevance to fuel element performance is supported by considering material properties, experimental data, and results from multidisciplinary fluid/thermal/structural simulations. Ductile to brittle transition results in a fuel element region prone to brittle fracture under stress, while outside this region, stresses lead to deformation and resilience under stress. Poor <b>coolant</b> <b>distribution</b> between fuel element channels can increase stresses in certain channels. NERVA fuel element experimental {{results are consistent with}} this interpretation.
