500|$|As he {{had with}} [...] "Something", Harrison {{composed}} the melody on a piano, part-way through a recording session – in this case, while working on his first post-Beatles solo album, All Things Must Pass (1970). As reproduced in his 1980 autobiography, I, Me, Mine, Harrison's original lyrics carried the title [...] "WHENEVER (by Shirley Bassey)". He recalls in the book: [...] "I got the chord sequence, and 'When every song is sung' were the first words to <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> mouth, and it developed from there." ...|$|E
500|$|When Lennon and Ono were reunited, {{she became}} pregnant; she had {{previously}} suffered three miscarriages in her attempt {{to have a}} child with Lennon. She initially said that she wanted to have an abortion, but she changed her mind and agreed to allow the pregnancy to continue on condition that Lennon adopt the role of househusband, which he agreed to do. Sean was born on 9 October 1975 (Lennon's 35th birthday) and delivered by Caesarean section. Lennon's subsequent hiatus from producing music would span five years. He had a photographer take pictures of Sean every day of his first year and created numerous drawings for him, which were posthumously published as Real Love: The Drawings for Sean. Lennon later proudly declared, [...] "He didn't <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> belly but, by God, I made his bones, because I've attended to every meal, and to how he sleeps, and {{to the fact that he}} swims like a fish." ...|$|E
500|$|Cornell {{stated that}} the biggest two {{influences}} on [...] "You Know My Name" [...] were Tom Jones, who performed the theme for Thunderball, and Paul McCartney, who composed and performed the theme for Live and Let Die. [...] "I decided that I was going to sing it like Tom Jones, in that crooning style. I wanted people to hear my voice," [...] Cornell said. [...] "And 'Live and Let Die' is a fantastic song. Paul McCartney wouldn't have written it if not for that movie. I [...] {{wanted to write a}} song in its own universe. I knew I'd never have it again — a big orchestra — so I wanted to have fun with it." [...] Cornell did not put the film's title in the lyrics, because he [...] "couldn't imagine it fitting into a song lyric that would <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> mouth". And he jokingly stated [...] "Casino Royale didn't make a good rock title, but I would write a song named Octopussy just for fun".|$|E

500|$|In October 2016, in {{response}} to a fan's question about the lack of new Nine Inch Nails music, Reznor responded with [...] "2016 is not over yet". In December 2016, Reznor commented on his statement regarding Nine Inch Nails' return {{by the end of the}} year: [...] "Those words did <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> mouth, didn't they? [...] Just wait and see what happens." [...] Three days later, Reznor announced an extended play entitled Not the Actual Events, along with reissues of Broken, The Downward Spiral, and The Fragile, with subsequent reissues of With Teeth, Year Zero, and The Slip being released later in 2017. Also announced was The Fragile: Deviations 1, which comprised 37 instrumental, alternate and unreleased tracks, many of which have never been heard before anywhere. Not the Actual Events was released on December 23, 2016, with fans who pre-ordered it receiving their download links one day earlier. Atticus Ross was also revealed to be an official full-time member of the band, the first member other than Reznor to be added to the band.|$|E
500|$|Eccleston {{stated in}} April 2004 {{that he did}} not believe his Doctor would be [...] "as {{eccentric}} and as foppish as he was in some of his incarnations". Russell T Davies characterised the character as a [...] "stripped down" [...] version of previous Doctors. Regarding the Ninth Doctor's less eccentric character, Davies stated: [...] "He travels in time and space, he's got two hearts, he's a Time Lord— that's eccentric enough to be getting on with". In contrast with previous Doctors, the Ninth Doctor speaks with a distinct Northern accent. Remarking on this aspect of his characterisation Eccleston states that the character [...] "is a scientist and an intellectual, {{and a lot of people}} seem to think you can only be those things if you speak with received pronunciation which, of course, is rubbish." [...] In regards to the Doctor's costume, consisting of simply a black leather coat and dark trousers, Eccleston stated, [...] "I didn't want the costume to be my performance" [...] and that [...] "I wanted any flamboyance and colour to <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> acting." [...] Eccleston thought that as the Doctor he should show a [...] "slight dark side" [...] but also bring out a lighter side. Executive producer Julie Gardner observed that the Ninth Doctor gave Eccleston the chance to be [...] "very intense but also frivolous as well." ...|$|E
500|$|To mark Chrissie's {{departure}} from the show, BBC Three aired a special episode of EastEnders Revealed on 22 September 2005. Entitled [...] "Chrissie Watts: Victim or Villain?" [...] the episode featured comments from Oberman, Grantham (Den), Dean (Sharon), Medcalf (Sam), Beckett (Jake), and Windsor (Peggy) profiling Chrissie and exploring the nuanced nature of the character. [...] "A lot of viewers, and myself," [...] Oberman later remarked, [...] "really wanted Chrissie {{to get away with}} it, especially as Den was such a monster. But soap and film noir {{have a lot in common}} – the bad girls have to be punished." [...] However, critics considered Chrissie to be a [...] "three-dimensional soap bitch", rather than a flat pantomime figure. Despite having killed her father, Chrissie highly valued her friendship with Sharon, declaring at one point: [...] "my friendship with you is the only good thing to <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> relationship with Den, and I mean that!" [...] Oberman characterised Chrissie as [...] "part victim part villain", declaring [...] "I think of her as a villain with a heart". She felt that, although [...] "no excuse" [...] for murder, Chrissie was driven to what she did: [...] "She's not a cold blooded murderer, it was all done in a fit of pique", and that [...] "these characters are made, not born." [...] Chrissie was haunted by the alcoholic fate of Den's first wife, which she vowed at Angie's grave to avoid. But in spite of her efforts, and indeed because of them, she failed, as she came to recognise: [...] "You know it's funny; when Den used to talk about Ange he used to describe her as this weak sad, cow. And I used to think 'not like me, oh no, not like me'. Who's having the last laugh now, Ange?" ...|$|E

2500|$|Booked for {{shooting}} in June 2010, [...] "Start Without You"'s accompanying music video {{was shot in}} July 2010, and directed by Max and Dania. On the video, Burke said, [...] "The video has a brave look. It's my choice. I wanted to <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> box."

[...] When asked if Silk still ties up the skates he said “I skate maybe {{once or twice a}} year for a charity event. [...] I can’t say I miss it. [...] I’m content. [...] I’m good friends with former teammates Jack O’Callahan and also with Jack Hughes and Ralph Cox, who were the last two cuts from the team that year.

2500|$|The {{following}} year, McGraw-Hill published Manilow's autobiography, Sweet Life: Adventures on the Way to Paradise, {{which took}} {{three years to}} complete. While promoting the work, Manilow defended his music in a telephone interview: [...] "I live in laid-back L.A., but in my heart, I'm an energetic New Yorker and that's what has always <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> music. I've always been surprised when the critics said I made wimpy little ballads." [...] Manilow returned to Arista Records in 1987 {{with the release of}} Swing Street. The album, a mixture of traditional after-dark and techno jazz, contained [...] "Brooklyn Blues," [...] an autobiographical song for Manilow, and [...] "Hey Mambo," [...] an uptempo Latin style duet with Kid Creole, produced with the help of Emilio Estefan, Jr., founder of Miami Sound Machine.|$|E

2500|$|Knowles {{is known}} for insisting on privacy, and the media hailed the film as a rare glimpse into her private life. This {{included}} documenting the events of her marriage to Jay-Z, her miscarriage, birth of daughter Blue Ivy, {{as well as her}} professional split from her father and manager Mathew Knowles. Knowles addressed this in an interview with GQ magazine, saying [...] "I always battle with: How much do I reveal about myself? How do I keep my humility? How do I keep my spirit and the reality? And how do I continue to be generous to — to my fans and to my craft? And how do I stay current? But how do I stay soulful? And it is the battle of my life. When I walk into a stage I'm able to <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> shell and be as fabulous and over the top and strong and powerful as I want to be." ...|$|E

The time has come where I have to <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> safe bubble that is the studio and share my music with you... butterflies just got worse [...] I've had the incredible opportunity to work with some of my favourite artists, DJs and producers on my album. I have had the most amazing time and I have learnt so much. It was important that my record was personal to me. I {{wanted to be able to}} look back on the album and know that I have honestly put 100% of myself into it. I've written songs and stories that I have wanted to write for a long time. I really hope that you're able to relate to my music, because that really is what it's all about.. So here goes, I'm taking a big leap, but it's going to be the best fun ever.|$|E
2500|$|Southwark on {{the south}} {{bank of the river}} Thames in London was very much a cash {{generator}} in those days. (Back in the [...] sixteenth century, Southwark [...] was in many ways [...] like a prototype [...] Las Vegas.) [...] In addition to the theatres, Southwark, Bankside was also a ‘red light’ district renowned for its brothels and contained an unconsecrated graveyard for the corpses of women who had worked in them. Far from condemning the brothels, the respective bishops of Winchester, Thomas Bilson included, drew up a set of rules for their regulation and opening hours. In addition to prostitution and pick pockets, the area was also renowned for its gambling dens, skittle alleys and bear/bull baiting, most of which were run by Philip Henslowe (1550–1616) who [...] married a wealthy widow by the name of Agnes Woodward in 1579 and it is thought that with her money Henslowe had managed to acquire interests in numerous brothels, inns, lodging houses and was also involved in dyeing, starch making [...] and wood selling as well as pawnbroking, money lending and theatrical enterprises. With regard to his relationship with actors and playwrights Henslowe wrote in his diary:—“Should these fellowes <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> debt I should have no rule over them.” Although Philip Henslowe was undoubtedly the main operational manager and entrepreneur behind many of Southwark’s and the ‘see of Winchester’s’ cash generating entertainment enterprises — all taxes from these activities had to be paid to Thomas Bilson the Bishop of Winchester. Indeed, in the London Public Record Office is an entry relating to William Shakespeare's unpaid tax, and carrying the annotation 'Ep (iscop)o Winton (ensi)' (to the Bishop of Winchester) – (*The Public Record Office, Exchequer, Lord Treasurers Remembrancer, Pipe Rolls, E.372/444, m. Dated 6 October 1600.) – which has led historians such as Ian Wilson in his 1993 book 'Shakespeare the Evidence' to surmise that perhaps William Shakespeare was living within the bishopric 'see' of Thomas Bilson the Bishop of Winchester at this time. However somewhat curiously, William Shakespeare's name does not appear in the church wardens' annual lists of those residents registered as having attended compulsory Easter Communion. The church wardens annual lists of residents and the compulsory attendance of Easter Communion – in effect the commencement of the new year within the Julian Calendar – provided the paranoid bureaucratic authorities – fearful of Jesuit and Catholic uprisings with a detailed census as to the political status of its citizens and as a means to assess their military and tax obligations. William Shakespeare's omission from this list and the reference to Thomas Bilson the Bishop of Winchester implies 'a relationship' between these two men which has hitherto been unexplained. – Indeed, the commonality of both men being to a large extent historical enigmas is curious in itself.|$|E
