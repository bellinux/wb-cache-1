40|$|The {{terrestrial}} biosphere {{is subjected to}} a wide range of natural climatic oscillations. Best known is the El Niño–southern oscillation (ENSO) that exerts globally extensive impacts on crops and natural vegetation. A 50 -year time series of ENSO events has been analysed to determine those geographical areas that are reliably impacted by ENSO events. Most areas are impacted by changes in precipitation; however, the Pacific Northwest is warmed by El Niño events. Vegetation gross primary production (GPP) has been simulated for these areas, and tests well against independent satellite observations of the normalized difference vegetation index. Analyses of selected geographical areas indicate that changes in GPP often lead to significant changes in ecosystem structure and dynamics. The Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) is another climatic oscillation that originates from the Pacific and exerts global impacts that are rather similar to ENSO events. However, the longer period of the PDO provided two phases in the time series with a <b>cool</b> <b>phase</b> from 1951 to 1976 and a warm phase from 1977 to 2002. It was notable that the <b>cool</b> <b>phase</b> of the PDO acted additively with <b>cool</b> ENSO <b>phases</b> to exacerbate drought in the earlier period for the southwest USA. By contrast in India, the <b>cool</b> <b>phase</b> of the PDO appears to reduce the negative impacts of warm ENSO events on crop production...|$|R

30|$|The El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) are {{atmospheric}} processes related to variations in sea surface temperature.

In the <b>cool</b> <b>phases</b> of ENSO (La Niña), drier than average conditions usually prevail in the southwestern United States. In the warm phases of PDO, dry conditions usually prevail in the Northwest. These inter-decadal processes have been linked to fire occurrence in both the northwestern Mexico (Stephens et al., 2003) and the Sierra Nevada (Taylor and Beaty, 2005). For this study, fire event dates were compared to an index of ENSO intensity (Stahle et al., 1998) and an index of PDO intensity (Biondi et al., 2001), both reconstructed back several centuries based on tree ring indices. For the El Niño Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), positive values indicate <b>cool</b> <b>phase</b> (La Niña) conditions, which are dry in the Southwest. For the Pacific Decadal Oscillation Index (PDOI), positive values indicate warm phase conditions, which correlate to dry conditions in the Northwest.

40|$|Based on a {{detailed}} analysis of the high-quality Chandra, XMM-Newton, and Suzaku data of the X-ray bright cluster of galaxies A 1795, we report clear evidence for a two-phase intracluster medium (ICM) structure, which consists of a cool (with a temperature T-c approximate to 2. 0 - 2. 2 keV) and a hot (T-h approximate to 5. 0 - 5. 7 keV) component that coexist and dominate the X-ray emission at least in the central 80 kpc. A third weak emission component (T- 3 approximate to 0. 8 keV) is also detected within the innermost 144 kpc and is ascribed to a portion of interstellar medium of the cD galaxy. Deprojected spectral analysis reveals flat radial temperature distributions for both the hot <b>phase</b> and <b>cool</b> <b>phase</b> components. These results are consistent with the ASCA measurements reported by Xu et al. and resemble the previous findings for the Centaurus Cluster. By analyzing the emission measure ratio and gas metal abundance maps created from the Chandra data, we find that the <b>cool</b> <b>phase</b> component is more metal-enriched than the hot phase one in the 50 - 100 kpc region, which agrees with that found in M 87. The coexistence of the <b>cool</b> <b>phase</b> and hot phase ICM cannot be realized by bubble uplifting from active galactic nuclei (AGNs) alone. Instead, the two-phase ICM properties are better reconciled with a cD corona model. In this model, the <b>cool</b> <b>phase</b> may be ascribed to the plasmas confined in magnetic loops, which are surrounded by the intruding hot phase ICM and have been polluted by metals synthesized in the cD galaxy. AGN feedback energy released in the innermost 10 kpc can serve as the heating source to prevent the loop-interior gas from cooling down to temperatures much lower than the observed value.

During AMO warmings most of the United States sees less than normal rainfall, including Midwest droughts in the 1930 s and 1950 s.

40|$|Eirik Drift lies on {{the slope}} south of Greenland, {{where it has been}} formed under the {{influence}} of the Western Boundary Undercurrent (WBUC) closely downstream of its origin in the deep-water formation centres of the Nordic Seas. Therefore, the sediment record at Eirik Drift documents modifications in pathways and intensity of the WBUC. These modifications reflect alterations in deep-water formation in the Nordic Seas and are therefore coupled with climate changes. Based on the seismostratigraphic analysis of sedimentary architecture identified in a set of high-resolution seismic reflection data, we have reconstructed the palaeocirculation of the WBUC at Eirik Drift since the early Miocene. We revealed a strong WBUC during warm climate conditions, and in <b>phases</b> of climate <b>cooling</b> with enhanced sea-ice extent we interpreted weak WBUC influence.

50|$|Much of {{the current}} {{research}} is into reducing the cycle time, as well as improving part quality. The most promising area is in mold pressurization. It {{is well known that}} applying a small amount of pressure internally to the mold at the correct point in the heating phase accelerates coalescence of the polymer particles during the melting, producing a part with fewer bubbles in less time than at atmospheric pressure. This pressure delays the separation of the part from the mold wall due to shrinkage during the <b>cooling</b> <b>phase,</b> aiding cooling of the part.

There is an initial epoch of H 2 production in the gas phase through the H − route which ends at a redshift of order unity.

Giant molecular clouds are not formed until lower redshifts. Star formation in the protogalactic disks can become self-regulated. The process responsible for the feedback is heating of the gas by the internal stellar radiation field which can dominate the background radiation field at various epochs. If the gas is heated to above 2000 − 3000 K the hydrogen molecules are collisionally dissociated and we assume that in their absence the star formation process is strongly suppressed due to insufficient cooling.
