In most cases more than one factor may contribute towards the initiation of a landslide event. This is clearly seen on the Norwegian continental slope where the location of landslides such as Storegga and Traenadjupet is related to weak geological layers. However the position of these weak layers is determined by regional variation in sedimentation style, which itself is controlled by large scale environmental factors such as climate change between glacial and interglacial conditions.

Therefore, the efficient operation of these pipelines determines {{the effectiveness of the}} entire business. Pipeline route selection plays a major role when designing an effective pipeline system, as the health of the pipeline depends on its terrain. The present practice of route selection for petroleum pipelines is governed by factors such as the shortest distance, constructability, minimal effects on the environment, and approachability. Although this reduces capital expenditure, it often proves to be uneconomical when life cycle costing is considered.

40|$|The banking {{industry}} {{has undergone a}} sea change after {{the first phase of}} economic liberalization in 1991 and hence credit management. While the primary function of banks is to lend funds as loans to various sectors such as agriculture, industry, personal loans, housing loans etc., in recent times the banks have become very cautious in extending loans, this is due to mounting nonperforming assets (NPAs). Therefore, an NPA account not only reduces profitability of banks by provisioning in the profit and loss account, but their carrying cost is also increased which results in excess & avoidable management attention. Apart from this, a high level of NPA also puts strain on a banks net worth because banks are under pressure to maintain a desired level of Capital Adequacy {{and in the absence of}} comfortable profit level, banks eventually look towards their internal financial strength to fulfill the norms thereby slowly eroding the net worth. <b>Considering</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>above</b> facts {{banking industry}} has to give more importance to NPA and to structure proper remedial solutions...|$|E

Though many binary instrumentation tools gener-ate memory traces, they either gather statistical informa-tion with loss of details or generate large trace files {{that are difficult}} to handle.

The proposed scheme also groups the memory accesses with in a loop to a single entity called Extended Power Regular Section Descriptor (EPRSD) which is an enhancement over PRSD concept. We propose bi-level compression scheme based on memory access pattern and thread identifiers that are capable of extracting application’s memory access struc-ture.

Six hundred and fourteen first-year university engineering physics students answered the Force Concept Inventory as a pre-test for their calculus-based course.

We used a 2 -way repeated measures ANOVA and linear regression to analyze data coded from incorrect student responses. It was found that there were sta-tistically significant main effects for item familiarity and item requirement for explanation vs. prediction on the measured degree of impetus theory application. Student course grades had no significant effect on impetus theory application. When faced with items that were un-familiar and predictive, students appeared to rely on non-theoretical, knowledge-in-pieces reasoning.
