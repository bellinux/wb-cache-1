40|$|We {{discuss in}} a {{systematic}} way the gauge theory for a <b>continuous</b> <b>spin</b> particle proposed by Schuster and Toro. We show that it is naturally formulated in a cotangent bundle over Minkowski spacetime where the gauge field depends on the spacetime coordinate x^μ and on a covector η_μ. We discuss how fields can be expanded in η_μ in different ways and how these expansions are related to each other. The field equation has a derivative of a Dirac delta function with support on the η-hyperboloid η^ 2 + 1 = 0 and we show how it restricts {{the dynamics of the}} gauge field to the η-hyperboloid. We then show that on-shell the field carries one single irreducible unitary representation of the Poincaré group for a <b>continuous</b> <b>spin</b> particle. We also show how the field can be used to build a set of covariant equations found by Wigner describing the wave function of one-particle states for a <b>continuous</b> <b>spin</b> particle.

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{description}} of <b>continuous</b> <b>spin</b> massless fields of mixed-symmetry type in Minkowski space {{at the level of}} equations of motion. It is based on the appropriately modified version of the constrained system originally used to describe massless bosonic fields of mixed-symmetry type. The description is shown to produce generalized versions of triplet, metric-like, and light-cone formulations. In particular, for scalar continuous fields we reproduce the known Schuster-Toro formulation. Because a <b>continuous</b> <b>spin</b> system inevitably involves infinite number of fields, specification of the allowed class of field configurations becomes a part of its definition. We show that the naive choice leads to an empty system and propose a suitable class resulting in the correct degrees of freedom. We also demonstrate that the gauge symmetries present in the formulation are all Stueckelberg-like so that the <b>continuous</b> <b>spin</b> system is not a genuine gauge theory.

40|$|We present {{evidence}} that high temperature CVD growth of SWNTs {{under conditions of}} <b>continuous</b> <b>spinning</b> of macroscopic fibers leads to an inherent predominance of high chiral angle CNTs, peaking at the armchair end. Raman, UV-vis-NIR absorption, and photoluminescence spectroscopy measurements show the prevalence of metallic SWNTs. The complete chiral angle distribution is obtained by electron diffraction of over 390 CNTs. It is biased towards high chiral angles and peaks at the armchair end (30 °), in good agreement with the established atomistic models for SWNT growth from a liquid catalyst. Based on the Fe–C–S constituent binary and ternary phase diagrams, thermodynamic calculations of phase compositions from fast cooling and experimental evidence of a post-synthesis catalyst, the proposed thermodynamic path of the catalyst is to form a solid FCC Fe core and a liquid Fe–S shell.

40|$|Relief {{structures}} are created {{on the surface}} of fibres to generate new effects in these fibres. More specifically, photo-embossing is used to generate the relief structures and to generate a non-contact process without etching procedures which could eventually be applied in high-speed and <b>continuous</b> <b>spinning</b> lines. Typically, a photopolymer mixture consisting of a polymeric binder, a monomer and a photo-initiator is directly spun into a monofilament fibre. The rheological properties of the photopolymer mixture are measured, and it is shown that the photopolymer mixture is visco-elastic at elevated temperatures. Fibres are prepared from the photopolymer mixture, and surface relief {{structures are}} generated perpendicular to the fibre axis by photo-embossing using a mask exposure. Optical microscopy (OM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) are employed to study the surface morphology of the fibres. It is shown that the height of the surface relief structures is strongly dependent on the pitch of the line mask and on the diameter of the fibres. At optimized conditions, patterned fibres are produced with well-defined surface relief structures.

40|$|Key {{points in}} the {{formation}} of liquid crystalline (LC) dispersions of graphene oxide (GO) and their processability via wet-spinning to produce long lengths of micrometer-dimensional fibers and yarns are addressed. Based on rheological and polarized optical microscopy investigations, a rational relation between GO sheet size and polydispersity, concentration, liquid crystallinity, and spinnability is proposed, leading to an understanding of lyotropic LC behavior and fiber spinnability. The knowledge gained from the straightforward formulation of LC GO “inks” in a range of processable concentrations enables the spinning of continuous conducting, strong, and robust fibers at concentrations as low as 0. 075 wt%, eliminating the need for relatively concentrated spinning dope dispersions. The dilute LC GO dispersion is proven to be suitable for fiber spinning using a number of coagulation strategies, including non-solvent precipitation, dispersion destabilization, ionic cross-linking, and polyelectrolyte complexation. One-step <b>continuous</b> <b>spinning</b> of graphene fibers and yarns is introduced for the first time by in situ spinning of LC GO in basic coagulation baths (i. e., NaOH or KOH), eliminating the need for post-treatment processes.

40|$|Although {{a lot of}} {{research}} has been devoted to the growth of a long Vertically Aligned Carbon Nanotube Array (VANTA), it remains difficult to find the right parameters on new systems. It has turned out that the recipe that allows the growth of Carbon Nanotube (CNT) in a particular Chemical Vapour Deposition (CVD) oven is very specific and not appropriate for other CVD systems. Besides, the condition in and around the oven should be suitable for CNT growth. Therefore a systematic approach is proposed in which this condition can be verified and actual CNT growth can be ensured. With this approach CNT arrays have been grown reproducibly with a length of 500 microns and more. The quality of the CNTs have been investigated by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) imaging. It has been found that the CNTs contain only few defects and no undesired coverage of amorphous carbon. Besides this framework for CNT growth initial steps have been taken to synthesize a spinnable CNT array.
