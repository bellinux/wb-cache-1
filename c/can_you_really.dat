2500|$|In 1996 the Danish {{sculptor}} Jens Galschi√∏t unveiled {{an artistic}} arrangement consisting of seven blocks of granite asteroids 'floating' {{in a circle}} around a 2-metre tall planet Earth. The artistic universe was populated by bronze sculpture figures that the little prince met on his journeys. As in the book, the prince discovers that [...] "the essential is invisible to the eye, and only by the heart <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> see". The work was completed at the start of 1996 and placed in the central square of Fuglebjerg, Denmark, but was later stolen from an exhibition in Billund in 2011.|$|E
2500|$|Los Angeles Times {{called it}} [...] "elaborately staged" [...] and [...] "meticulously detailed," [...] {{considered}} among several [...] "great showcases for Jackson's willingness to stretch beyond her public's conceptions of her." [...] Its [...] "headbangin' bravado" [...] {{was thought to}} display her diversity, adding [...] "Jackson is too cagey to be pigeonholed." [...] Parry Gettelman of The Sentinel praised its [...] "feline choreography." [...] Upon its premiere, Dennis Kelly of The Morning Call said, [...] "It stands out as much for its hard-edged guitar as {{for the fact that}} Jackson wears white instead of her customary black." [...] Entertainment Weekly also commented it [...] "mixes performance footage with shots of a leashed panther." [...] Jackson's wardrobe and suggestive choreography drew media controversy; also considered to start fashion trends. Lisa Jones of The Village Voice observed Jackson's ensemble to cause a [...] "butt revolution" [...] and increase the fetish for a woman's posterior among the general public, questioning [...] "Once you've seen Janet Jackson gyrate in 'Black Cat,' <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> go back to Twiggy?" [...] In Dear Teen Me: Authors Write Letters to Their Teen Selves, author Jo Whittemore recalled, [...] "You think you're sexy. And we can blame Janet Jackson for that. She's all the rage.. with [...] "Rhythm Nation" [...] and [...] "Black Cat" [...] topping the charts, and her music videos are hot. She's sexy, and you want to be sexy, too. That means lace-up boots, tight clothes, and killer dance moves." ...|$|E

The sooner I get the vicar on my side the better for us both. Who in the whole of the parish--I ask you--and you must have the sense left to see that--who will believe that a respectable man, a gentleman, a Churchman, would deliberately go out to seek an afternoon's amusement in a poky little country churchyard?

[...] "Well, there are certain dogs who will not work unless you pat them on the head. Therefore I patted this one on the head, since, after all, he is a clever dog who knows things that we do not know; for instance, how to destroy the idol of the Fung.

6000|$|In the meantime, your {{kindness}} {{will be glad}} {{to learn}} of the prosperity of my poems in my own country. I am more than satisfied in my most sanguine hope for them, and a little surprised besides. The critics have been good to me. 'Blackwood' and 'Tait' have this month both been generous, and the 'New Monthly' and 'Ainsworth's Magazine' did what they could. Then I have the 'Examiner' in my favor, and such heads and hearts as are better and purer than the purely critical, and I am very glad altogether, and very grateful, and hope to live long enough to acknowledge, if not to justify, much unexpected kindness. Of course, some hard criticism is mixed with the liberal sympathy, as you will see in 'Blackwood,' but some of it I deserve, even in my own eyes; and all of it I am willing to be patient under. The strange thing is, that without a single personal friend among these critics, they should have expended on me so much 'gentillesse,' and this strangeness I feel very sensitively. Mr. Horne has not returned to England yet, and in a letter which I received from him some fortnight ago he desired to have my book sent to him to Germany, just as if he never meant to return to England again. I answered his sayings, and reiterated, {{in a way that would}} make you smile, my information about your having sent the American copies to him. I made my oyez very plain and articulate. He won't say again that he never heard of it--be sure of that. Well, and then Mr. Browning is not in England either, so that whatever you send for him must await his return from the east or the west or the south, wherever he is. The new spirit of the age is a wandering spirit. Mr. Dickens is in Italy. Even Miss Mitford talks of going to France, which is an extreme case for her.

6000|$|... "I {{will tell}} you what she did," [...] I said, [...] "after I {{received}} your letter. Fortunately for me, she was not very well that morning; and she breakfasted in bed. I {{had plenty of time to}} compose myself, and to caution Zillah (who read your letter to me), before we met for the first time that day. On the previous day, I had felt hurt and offended with her for the manner in which she accounted for your absence from Browndown. I thought she was not treating me with the same confidence which I should have placed in her, if our positions had been reversed. When I next saw her, having your warning in my mind, I made my excuses, and said what I thought she would expect me to say, under the circumstances. In my excitement and my wretchedness, I daresay I over-acted my part. At any rate, I roused the suspicion in her that something was wrong. She not only asked me if anything had happened, she went the length of saying, in so many words, that she thought she saw a change in me. I stopped it there, by declaring that I did not understand her. She must have seen that I was not telling the truth: she must have known as well as I knew that I was concealing something from her. For all that, not one word more escaped her lips. A proud delicacy--I saw it as plainly in her face, as I now see you--a proud delicacy silenced her; she looked wounded and hurt. I have been thinking of that look, since I have been here. I have asked myself (what did not occur to me at the time) if a false woman, who knew herself to be guilty, would have behaved in that way? Surely a false woman would have set her wits against mine, and have tried to lead me into betraying to her what discoveries I had really made? Oscar! that delicate silence, that wounded look, will plead for her when I think of her in her absence! I can not feel as satisfied as I once did, that she is the abominable creature you declare her to be. I know you are incapable of deceiving me--I know you believe what you say. But is it not possible that appearances have misled you? <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> be sure that you have not made some dreadful mistake?" ...|$|E
