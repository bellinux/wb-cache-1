40|$|Pupil on Windows We {{are very}} happy to {{announce}} that Pupil support is now supported on Windows 10 ! A lot of work went into getting the usb and low level video backend running robustly for Windows, and now Pupil is equally well supported on macOS, Linux, and Windows. Jump to Downloads It {{is also important to}} note {{that this is the first}} Pupil release that uses Python v 3. 5. 2, and OpenCV v 3. 1. You can run the python 3 _opencv 3 _merged branch from source on macOS, Linux, or Windows if you are using Python 3. 5. 2 and OpenCV 3. 1. Windows Driver Setup In order to support isochronous USB transfer on Windows, you will need to install drivers for your Pupil headset cameras. Download and install libusbk 3. 0. 7. 0. Download and install Zadig. Plug in your Pupil headset. Start ZadiG. From the options menu, uncheck hide composite devices, and <b>check</b> <b>display</b> all devices. Locate your Pupil headset composite device. It is very important that you select the composite parent and not one of the interfaces. Set the driver replacement to libusbK (v 3. 0. 7. 0) and click Replace driver Verify the driver is correctly replaced. Open device manager. Your Pupil headset cameras should be listed under a new category titled: libusbK USB Devices. Running Bundles on Windows Download the bundle. Extract the archive with 7 zip Launch pupil_capture. exe or pupil_player. exe from within the Pupil Capture or Pupil Player bundle. You may also want to right click on the. exe and Create shortcut so you can launch the applications from desktop. For debugging, you can run the. exe with cmd prompt. Known Issues CPU performance Graph is not accurate. The CPU graph in World, Eye, and Player windows displays a much greater percentage than is actually being used. Use task manager to see actual cpu performance. Please open issues on github if you find any bugs, so that we can incorporate changes in the next bundle/release. We hope look forward to your feedback! Best, The Pupil Dev Team </a...|$|E

At {{the beginning of the}} Thesis there is an explanation of CCD sensor components and photodiods working principals. Further are discussed particular methods of object sensing. There are schematics of different sensor locations and flying object. The other step deals with introduction to the question of ray impact on sensor in the way of using different light sources and optical systems. In {{the other part of the}} Thesis are presented two sensors, which have been chosen by PROTOTYPA company workers.

40|$|In this paper, a {{real-time}} RFID system {{capable of}} tracking laboratory animals for behavior analysis purposes was designed and implemented. Four passive RFID tags based on low frequency (LF) were designed and implemented from first principles. The tags can be read by any RFID reader that operates on the low frequency range 125 - 134 kHz. The tags were designed through the investigation of various antenna, encoding, modulation, and energy harvesting techniques. The tag receives the electromagnetic signal via the antenna, and converts it to a DC signal that the microcontroller can use to manipulate the electromagnetic signal with the data such that the reader can decode the unique tag identifier. RFID sensors were designed and implemented to collect data from various monitored areas of a semi natural environment. The data is sent to a central data coordinator for pre-processing and middleware for data error <b>checking,</b> <b>display</b> and storage. The data is stored in an online database {{which is used to}} produce statistical information about the area within which the RFID system is deployed. The RFID system can successfully detect and store movement data in real time. A read range of 14. 5 cm was achieved. [URL] Electronic and Computer Engineerin...|$|R

The system registers the frames using the depth and color data, and integrates them into an evolving model that is displayed continually.

The GraphML type is specialized to contain the node type, time, recombination location, and name. The GraphML type is specialized to contain the ancestral material passed along that edge.

30|$|Comparing our {{estimated}} state dependence to {{the ones}} of Wunder and Riphahn (2014) and Königs (2014), we see a distinctly higher estimated state dependence in welfare benefit receipt in our results. This might {{be explained by the}} specific sample design of the PASS which might lead to a higher number of long-term benefit recipients compared to the SOEP. The additional split of welfare recipients into employed and non-employed welfare recipients may also contribute to this finding. Since welfare recipients employed in t− 1 are less likely to receive benefits in t than non-employed recipients, the estimated state-dependence in benefit receipt should be lower if all welfare recipients—employed or not—are measured in one category as in Königs (2014) and Wunder and Riphahn (2014). Due to the complex survey design, using sampling weights should be appropriate to receive representative results that are comparable to other studies. However, in our case a weighted estimation was not possible, because the estimates did not converge {{in the case of an}} outcome with four different categories. As we are not primarily interested in determining the absolute level of state dependence in German welfare benefit receipt, but in determining the role of misreporting for the estimated state dependence, we do not use sampling weights. Instead, we include a dummy variable “population sample” in the main estimations, which should capture the sampling design. Furthermore, we run an estimation on the bivariate outcome “welfare receipt” as an additional <b>check</b> <b>displayed</b> in Appendix: Table  12. We run these estimations weighted, unweighted for the full sample and the population sample only and unweighted but including the population sample dummy.|$|R
