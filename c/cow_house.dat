40|$|Cattle are {{traditionally}} thought to show {{little or no}} faeces avoidance behaviour. Management practices that prevent contact between housed cattle and their faeces are often restrictive in nature and can affect other unrelated behavioural patterns. This study looked at the range of sequences of behaviour performed by dairy cows {{at the time of}} elimination and whether these sequences might indicate faeces avoidance. Defaecation behaviour of <b>cows</b> <b>housed</b> in straw yards (n = 145) and cubicles (n = 178) was compared to assess the effects of housing design. Combinations of walking (W), standing (S) and lying (L) were recorded as pre-, during and post-eliminative behaviours. If the post-eliminative behaviour was maintained for 10 s or less, the subsequent behaviour was also noted. A total of 35 sequences was recorded and these were classified as showing (a) no faeces avoidance, (b) incidental faeces avoidance, or (c) intentional faeces avoidance. <b>Cows</b> <b>housed</b> in cubicles showed the 2 ̆ 7 no avoidance of faeces 2 ̆ 7 sequences significantly more than did <b>cows</b> <b>housed</b> in straw yards (P < 0. 001). Conversely, cows in straw yards showed a significantly greater level of both incidental and intentional faeces avoidance (P < 0. 001 and 0. 001, respectively). The results {{of this study indicate that}} in the majority of instances the cows did avoid bodily contact with freshly deposited faeces through avoidance behaviour. The increased level of non-avoidance of faeces displayed by <b>cows</b> <b>housed</b> in cubicles indicated that housing design might have had a negative impact on the expression of eliminate-avoidance behaviour.

40|$|Objective The aims of {{the present}} paper were to: (i) {{identify}} and quantify conjunctival fungi isolated from healthy cows; (ii) verify the influence of different methods of farm management on the prevalence (percentage of positive cultures for each fungal species per farm) of conjunctival fungi. Material and methods Forty Friesian and twenty Limousin female cows aged 1 - 10 years stabled in three farms with different managements (farm 1 : <b>cows</b> <b>housed</b> strictly indoors; farm 2 : <b>cows</b> <b>housed</b> outside {{during the day and}} inside the stall during the night; farm 3 : <b>cows</b> <b>housed</b> strictly outdoors) were investigated for conjunctival fungal flora. Air and food were also tested. Specimens were collected every season during a 2 -year study. Identification of colonies of filamentous fungi was achieved to the genus level on the basis of macro-and microscopic features. Results The total number of eyes positive for fungi ranged from 85 to 100 % at farm 1, from 65 to 95 % at farm 2, and from 55 to 95 % at farm 3. Fungi most frequently isolated from conjunctival fornix were Cladosporium spp. and Penicillium spp. Statistical analysis did not show any differences in fungal prevalences among the three farms during the same season. Some fungal species were consistently isolated while others were intermittently isolated. Conclusions Fungi found in the conjunctival fornix of cows might represent transient seeding from the environment, as suspected in other species.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to determine the effect of the dry cow management system (pasture or confined) on: (1) lying behaviour and activity; (2) feeding and heat stress behaviours; (3) intramammary infections, postpartum. Non-lactating Holstein cows were assigned to either deep-bedded, sand freestalls (n = 14) or pasture (n = 14) using rolling enrollment. At dry-off, cows were equipped with an accelerometer to determine daily lying time (h/d), lying bouts (bouts/d), steps (steps/d) and divided into periods: far-off (60 to 15 d prepartum), close-up (14 to 1 d prepartum), calving (calving date) and postpartum (1 to 14 d postpartum). Respiration rates were recorded once weekly from dry off to calving from 1300 to 1500 h. Feeding displacements were defined as one cow successfully displacing another from the feed bunk and were recorded once per week during the 2 h period, immediately after feeding at 800 h. Pastured cows were fed a commercial dry cow pellet during far-off and total mixed ration during close-up, with free access to hay and grazing. Freestall <b>housed</b> <b>cows</b> were fed a total mixed ration at far-off and close-up. <b>Cows</b> <b>housed</b> in freestalls were moved to a maternity pen with a mattress at commencement of labour. Pastured cows calved in pasture. After calving, all cows were commingled in a pen identical to the freestall <b>housing</b> treatment. <b>Cows</b> <b>housed</b> in freestalls laid down for longer during far-off and close-up periods, had fewer lying bouts during the calving period and took fewer steps throughout the study period when compared to pastured <b>cows.</b> Freestall <b>housed</b> <b>cows</b> experienced more displacements after feeding than did pastured cows. Respiration rates increased with an increasing temperature humidity index, more in pastured cows than in freestall <b>housed</b> <b>cows.</b> Pastured cows altered their lying behaviour and activity, suggesting a shift in time budget priorities between pastured and confined dry cows.

Six factors were associated with a greater area of hair loss, including cows with locomotion score 3, a cleanliness score (10 - 18 / 28), high daily milk yield (25. 1 - 58. 1 kg), poor body condition score (1 - 1. 5), duration of winter housing (≥ 41 days) and some combinations of cubicle base and bedding materials. Compared with <b>cows</b> <b>housed</b> in cubicles with a concrete base and whole straw or rape straw bedding, <b>cows</b> <b>housed</b> in cubicles with concrete bases with sand or chopped straw bedding had smaller areas of hair loss and <b>cows</b> <b>housed</b> on a mattress base with whole straw or rape straw bedding had a larger area of hair loss. Area of hair loss, as measured on hock maps, was not significantly different between cows with score 1 (median= 23. 6 cm 2) and score 2 (median= 20. 3 cm 2) on the categorical scale for hock lesions. This suggests that the categorical scale was not reflecting the extent of hair loss and that hock maps are a good alternative for studying the dynamics of hock lesions over time.

40|$|Objective The {{objectives}} {{of the study were}} to assess the effect of cacao bean husk as bedding material in free-stall barn on the behavior, productivity, and udder health of dairy cattle, and on the ammonia concentrations in the barn. Methods Four different stall surfaces (no bedding, cacao bean husk, sawdust, and chopped wheat straw) were each continuously tested for a period of 1 week to determine their effects on nine lactating Holstein <b>cows</b> <b>housed</b> in the free-stall barn with rubber matting. The lying time and the milk yield were measured between d 4 and d 7. Blood samples for plasma cortisol concentration and teat swabs for bacterial counts were obtained prior to morning milking on d 7. The time-averaged gas-phase ammonia concentrations in the barn were measured between d 2 and d 7. Results The cows spent approximately 2 h more per day lying in the stalls when bedding was available than without bedding. The milk yield increased in the experimental periods when cows had access to bedding materials as compared to the period without bedding. The lying time was positively correlated with the milk yield. Bacterial counts on the teat ends recorded for <b>cows</b> <b>housed</b> on cacao bean husk were significantly lower than those recorded for <b>cows</b> <b>housed</b> without bedding. Ammonia concentration under cacao bean husk bedding decreased by 6 %, 15 %, and 21 % as compared to no bedding, sawdust, and chopped wheat straw, respectively. The cortisol concentration was lowest in the period when cacao bean husk bedding was used. We observed a positive correlation between the ammonia concentrations in the barn and the plasma cortisol concentrations. Conclusion Cacao bean husk is a potential alternative of conventional bedding material, such as sawdust or chopped wheat straw, with beneficial effects on udder health and ammonia concentrations in the barns...|$|R
40|$|In Europe, National Emission Ceilings (NEC) {{have been}} set to {{regulate}} the emissions of harmful gases, like ammonia (NH 3). From NH 3 emission models and a sensitivity analysis, {{it is known that}} one of the major variables that determines NH 3 emission from dairy <b>cow</b> <b>houses</b> is the urine puddle area on the floor. However, puddle area data from <b>cow</b> <b>houses</b> is scarce. This is caused by the lack of appropriate measurement methods and the challenging measurement circumstances in the houses. In a preliminary study inside commercial dairy <b>cow</b> <b>houses,</b> an IR camera was successfully tested to distinguish a fresh urine puddle from its background to determine a puddle's area. The objective {{of this study was to}} further develop, improve and validate the IR camera method to determine the area of a warm fluid layer with a measurement uncertainty of < 0. 1 m 2. In a laboratory set-up, 90 artificial, warm, blue puddles were created, and both an IR and a colour image of each puddle was taken within 5 s after puddle application. For the colour images, three annotators determined the ground truth puddle areas (A p,GT). For the IR images, an adaptive IR threshold algorithm was developed, based on the mean background temperature and the standard deviation of all temperature values in an image. This IR algorithm was able to automatically determine the IR puddle area (A p,IR) in each IR image. The agreement between the two methods was assessed. The A p,IR underestimated the A p,GT by 2. 53 % for which is compensated by the model A p,GT = 1. 0253 ·A p,IR. This regression model intercepted with zero and the noise was only 0. 0651 m 2, so the measurement uncertainty was < 0. 1 m 2. In addition, the A p,IR was not affected by the mean background temperature. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to determine skin surface temperature of dairy <b>cows</b> <b>housed</b> in tie stalls, according to their location in the barn. A total of 52 healthy cows were investigated, 31 of which were kept in “cold” stalls by the entrance to the barn and 21 in “warm” stalls located in the centre of the barn. Skin surface temperature was measured in 8 different body parts using a non-contact thermometer (Fluke 572 pyrometer). The results showed that skin temperature of the cows varied according to their location. It was significantly lower in the <b>cows</b> <b>housed</b> in “cold” stalls compared to those kept in “warm” stalls (P < 0. 05).

50|$|A {{good example}} of a long house is Cilewent Farmhouse from Llansanffraid Cwmteuddwr, nr Rhayader, Radnorshire which has been reconstructed at St Fagans. This is a long-house, with cattle being {{accommodated}} {{at one end and}} humans at the other, with a passageway between the two parts. This type of farmhouse was once common in mid- and south Wales. This cruck and timber-framed house was originally built about 1470 as an open hall house. The original timber walls were rebuilt in stone in 1734, with the date being carved on the head of the entrance door frame. All that remains of the original house are the two cruck trusses in the <b>cow</b> <b>house</b> and the timber-framed partition between the <b>cow</b> <b>house</b> and the dwelling. Another re-construction at St Fagans is Hendre'r-ywydd Uchaf Farmhouse from Llangynhafal in Denbighshire. This a cruck-framed hall-house dendrochronologically dated to 1508 and typical of the better class of Welsh farmhouse in the late Middle Ages. The building is divided into five bays, the lower two used for housing for cattle and horses, the centre bay serving as a work-room and the upper two comprising the open hall and a bedroom. The outside walls are timber-framed, the panels being in-filled with wattle and daubed with clay. Both the daubed panels and the timber work are limewashed as was common in the Middle Ages. The open hearth is placed in the centre of the hall, smoke from the fire escaping through the roof and the unglazed windows. Excavations in 2003 by Bill Britnell at Tŷ Draw at Llanarmon Mynydd Mawr in north Powys have done much to elucidate the relationship of the <b>cow</b> <b>house</b> with the hall of a longhouse. This is a classic three unit hall house of longhouse type. It has an open hall of two bays set between inner and outer rooms, the outer room acting as an cow byre. Dendrochrononology on the roof purlins suggest that Tŷ Draw was completed shortly after 1479/80 and it has been possible to suggest from this dating that the house was built by Hywel ap Rees. In the byre area, which was accessed by door, a series of small post holes were noted, that have been interpreted as wickerwork hurdles. These would have provided stalls for cattle which were overwintered from November to March each year. Similar evidence for stalls for cattle have been found at Tŷ Mawr and Tyddyn Llwydion in Montgomeryshire.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of lameness and specific causes of lameness on standing time, number of lying bouts and test day yield (TDY) in cows at pasture and <b>cows</b> which were <b>housed.</b> Data were collected from 200 cows from 10 farms where cows were at pasture and 200 cows from 10 farms where they were housed. Each farm was visited twice over 3 days between May and August (autumn and winter) of 2009. At the first visit, 10 lame cows, all with locomotion score (LS) 3, and 10 non-lame cows, all with LS 1, were selected per farm. Electronic data loggers were positioned on one hind leg of each cow to record standing time and transitions. These were removed 3 days later at the second visit. There was no significant difference in standing time between <b>housed</b> and pasture-based <b>cows</b> but lame cows stood for a mean 1. 75 (SE 0. 36) h/day less than non-lame cows in both systems. Cows with sole damage, wall damage, misshapen feet and infectious lameness all stood for less time than non-lame <b>cows.</b> <b>Housed</b> <b>cows</b> had a mean 1. 4 more lying bouts per day than cows at pasture. Lame cows at pasture had 1. 2 more lying bouts per day than non-lame <b>cows</b> but <b>housed</b> lame cattle had 0. 8 fewer lying bouts than non-lame housed cattle, so overall the number of lying bouts in lame <b>cows,</b> <b>housed</b> or at pasture, was similar. The only lesion associated with a change in the number of lying bouts was sole damage with a mean 1. 1 more lying bouts per day across systems than non-lame cows. Lame cows had lower TDY than non-lame cows and TDY was reduced more in lame cows when TDY was greater. In conclusion, standing times were similar in cows at pasture and in <b>housed</b> <b>cows,</b> but lying bouts were different. However, given the associations between standing time, lying bouts and TDY the results might be most strongly influenced by TDY, rather than system. Future studies investigating the impact of lameness on cow behaviour by system in cows with similar and a range of TDY would be informative. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{study was}} {{conducted}} in two dairy farms located in the province of Wielkopolska, Poland. Body condition scoring of Holstein-Friesian cows was car-ried out in spring, summer, autumn, and winter. In all, were carried out 1999 BCS assessments on 459 <b>cows,</b> <b>housed</b> in a free-stall barn, and 88 <b>cows,</b> <b>housed</b> in a tie-stall barn. Statistical analysis involved the housing system (free-stall and tie-stall), the technological status (primiparous and multiparous cows), and the season. The mean BCS of free-stall cows decreased until 100 days in lactation, then it increased again and reached the peak in dry cows, 3 weeks before calving. Primiparous cows had higher BCSs than multiparous cows. The effect of season on BCS in the free-stall sys-tem cows was significant (P ≤ 0. 01 and P ≤ 0. 05). BCS was lowest in the autumn. Moreover, technological group had an effect on BCS in the free-stall barn (P ≤ 0. 01 and P ≤ 0. 05); however, housing system was without a significant effect on the mean BCS or its distribution. In the movement restricting tie-stall housing system allows maintaining an optimal BCS by provision well balanced feeding rations.

50|$|Early barn {{types in}} the U.K., such as aisled barns, were {{primarily}} used for the processing and temporary storage of grain. Processing comprised hand-threshing (later in history replaced by machine threshing): the grain would then be removed to a granary for permanent storage. Following the agricultural revolution of the 16th to mid-19th century, {{with its emphasis on}} the improvement of farming techniques, there was a marked increase in the amount of hay that was produced (partly due to the use of water-meadows and partly due to crop rotation). The hay barn was developed in response to this: formerly the small amounts of precious hay produced had been stored in the haylofts over the <b>cow</b> <b>house</b> or stables, or in haystacks. However, haystacks are prone to spoiling in the rain, especially after the stack has been 'opened' for consumption. As the weather in the U.K. is often wet, several different types of hay barns evolved, but all shared certain characteristics: they were roofed and well-ventilated. Hay barns came into use {{at the end of the}} 18th century. Dutch barns are still very common in the U.K., and are nowadays most commonly used to store straw rather than hay.|$|E

The analysis results show that <b>cows</b> <b>housed</b> in the section with the separated manure solids spent more time lying (41. 47 %) and also laid less in the corridor manure (0. 91 %) than the cows in the section with separated manure solids and the rubber mats where they were laying generally less (35. 71 %), they spent more time lying in the corridor manure (1. 55 %) and in terms of preference of lying area the cows clearly preferred the separated manure solids (25. 8 %). Based on observations we can say that <b>cows</b> <b>housed</b> in sections of slurry solid phase were cleaner (average 6. 13 points) than cows in the section with the rubber and a separated manure (averagely 7. 28 points).

Each farm was measured in two seasons and a Diet factor was defined, based on the amount of grass in total roughage. Overall mean values were 4. 27 kg m- 3 for UUN, an initial pH of 8. 3, both in fresh puddles, and a pH(ξ) of 9. 0 for random puddles at a random time. For UUN both the variation within and between farms was large, whereas the variation for pH was small. The Diet was the only factor that resulted in a significant effect, with a 0. 1 difference in pH(ξ). Compared to the reference values, both the mean UUN and pH showed smaller values. The calculated potential ammonia in kg puddle- 1, however, showed a huge range and was considerably larger than the commonly used reference values in the Netherlands...|$|R
