5|$|A virus particle, {{also known}} as a virion, {{consists}} of genes made from DNA or RNA which are surrounded by a protective coat of protein called a <b>capsid.</b> The <b>capsid</b> is made of many smaller, identical protein molecules which are called capsomers. The arrangement of the capsomers can either be icosahedral (20-sided), helical or more complex. There is an inner shell around the DNA or RNA called the nucleocapsid, which is formed by proteins. Some viruses are surrounded by a bubble of lipid (fat) called an envelope.|$|E
5|$|The three serotypes of poliovirus, PV1, PV2, and PV3, {{each have}} a {{slightly}} different <b>capsid</b> protein. <b>Capsid</b> proteins define cellular receptor specificity and virus antigenicity. PV1 {{is the most common}} form encountered in nature, but all three forms are extremely infectious. As of November 2015, wild PV1 is highly localized to regions in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Wild PV2 was declared eradicated in September 2015 after last being detected in October 1999 in Uttar Pradesh, India. As of November 2015, wild PV3 has not been seen since its 2012 detection in parts of Nigeria and Pakistan.|$|E
5|$|Uncoating happens {{inside the}} cell when the viral <b>capsid</b> is removed and {{destroyed}} by viral enzymes or host enzymes, thereby exposing the viral nucleic acid.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{assembly}} of the tegument of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV- 1) is a complex process that involves a number of events at various sites within virus-infected cells. Our studies focused on determining whether tegument proteins, VP 1 / 2 and UL 37, are added to <b>capsids</b> located within the nucleus. <b>Capsids</b> were isolated from the nuclear fraction of HSV- 1 -infected cells and purified by rate-zonal centrifugation to separate B <b>capsids</b> (containing the scaffold proteins and no viral DNA) and C <b>capsids</b> (containing DNA and no scaffold proteins). Western blot analyses of these <b>capsids</b> indicated that VP 1 / 2 associated primarily with C <b>capsids</b> and UL 37 associated with B and C <b>capsids.</b> The results demonstrate {{that at least two}} of the tegument proteins of HSV- 1 are associated with <b>capsids</b> isolated from the nuclear fraction, and these capsid–tegument protein interactions may represent initial events of the tegumentation process...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCell {{infection}} by parvoviruses {{requires that}} <b>capsids</b> be delivered {{from outside the}} cell to the cytoplasm, followed by genome trafficking to the nucleus. Here we microinject <b>capsids</b> into cells that lack receptors and followed their movements within the cell over time. In general the <b>capsids</b> remained close to the positions where they were injected, and most particles did not move to the vicinity of or enter the nucleus. When 70 kDa-dextran was injected along with the <b>capsids</b> that did not enter the nucleus in significant amounts. <b>Capsids</b> conjugated to peptides containing the SV 40 large T-antigen nuclear localization signal remained in the cytoplasm, although bovine serum albumen conjugated to the same peptide entered the nucleus rapidly. No effects of disruption of microfilaments, intermediate filaments, or microtubules {{on the distribution of}} the <b>capsids</b> were observed. These results suggest that movement of intact <b>capsids</b> within cells is primarily associated with passive processes...|$|R
40|$|Empty {{parvovirus}} B 19 <b>capsids</b> {{were isolated}} from insect cells infected with a recombinant baculovirus expressing parvovirus B 19 VP 2 alone {{and also with}} a double-recombinant baculovirus expressing both VP 1 and VP 2. That VP 2 alone can assemble to form <b>capsids</b> is a phenomenon not previously observed in parvoviruses. The stoichiometry of the <b>capsids</b> containing both VP 1 and VP 2 {{was similar to that}} previously observed in parvovirus B 19 -infected cells. The <b>capsids</b> were similar to native <b>capsids</b> in size and appearance, and their antigenicity was demonstrated by immunoprecipitation and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with B 19 -specific antibodies...|$|R
5|$|HIV is {{different}} in structure from other retroviruses. It is roughly spherical with a diameter of about 120nm, around 60times smaller than a red blood cell. It is composed of two copies of positive single-stranded RNA that codes for the virus's nine genes enclosed by a conical <b>capsid</b> composed of 2,000 copies of the viral protein p24. The single-stranded RNA is tightly bound to nucleocapsid proteins, p7, and enzymes needed {{for the development of}} the virion such as reverse transcriptase, proteases, ribonuclease and integrase. A matrix composed of the viral protein p17 surrounds the <b>capsid</b> ensuring the integrity of the virion particle.|$|E
5|$|Poliomyelitis {{is caused}} by {{infection}} {{with a member of}} the genus Enterovirus known as poliovirus (PV). This group of RNA viruses colonize the gastrointestinal tract — specifically the oropharynx and the intestine. The incubation time (to the first signs and symptoms) ranges from three to 35 days, with a more common span of six to 20 days. PV infects and causes disease in humans alone. Its structure is very simple, composed of a single (+) sense RNA genome enclosed in a protein shell called a <b>capsid.</b> In addition to protecting the virus’s genetic material, the <b>capsid</b> proteins enable poliovirus to infect certain types of cells. Three serotypes of poliovirus have been identified—poliovirus type 1 (PV1), type 2 (PV2), and type 3 (PV3)—each with a slightly different <b>capsid</b> protein. All three are extremely virulent and produce the same disease symptoms. PV1 is the most commonly encountered form, and the one most closely associated with paralysis.|$|E
5|$|The HIV virion enters macrophages and CD4+ T cells by the {{adsorption}} of glycoproteins on {{its surface}} to receptors on the target cell followed by fusion of the viral envelope with the cell membrane {{and the release of}} the HIV <b>capsid</b> into the cell.|$|E
50|$|Assembly of portal units is {{an initial}} step in {{constructing}} <b>capsids</b> of viral progeny. <b>Capsids</b> {{assembled in the}} absence of portals lack portals.|$|R
5000|$|New viral <b>capsids</b> are {{assembled}} {{with the}} capsomere proteins. The negative RNA strands combine with <b>capsids</b> and viral RdRp to form new negative RNA virions.|$|R
50|$|Many viral <b>capsids</b> {{are formed}} by hexameric and pentameric proteins. Such <b>capsids</b> are {{assigned}} a triangulation number (T-number) which describe {{relation between the}} number of pentagons and hexagons.|$|R
5|$|The poxviruses are large, complex {{viruses that}} have an unusual morphology. The viral genome is {{associated}} with proteins within a central disc structure known as a nucleoid. The nucleoid {{is surrounded by a}} membrane and two lateral bodies of unknown function. The virus has an outer envelope with a thick layer of protein studded over its surface. The whole virion is slightly pleiomorphic, ranging from ovoid to brick shape. Mimivirus {{is one of the largest}} characterised viruses, with a <b>capsid</b> diameter of 400nm. Protein filaments measuring 100nm project from the surface. The <b>capsid</b> appears hexagonal under an electron microscope, therefore the <b>capsid</b> is probably icosahedral. In 2011, researchers discovered the largest then known virus in samples of water collected from the ocean floor off the coast of Las Cruces, Chile. Provisionally named Megavirus chilensis, it can be seen with a basic optical microscope. In 2013, the Pandoravirus genus was discovered in Chile and Australia, and has genomes about twice as large as Megavirus and Mimivirus.|$|E
5|$|Uncoating is {{a process}} in which the viral <b>capsid</b> is removed: This may be by {{degradation}} by viral enzymes or host enzymes or by simple dissociation; the end-result is the releasing of the viral genomic nucleic acid.|$|E
5|$|VP6 {{forms the}} bulk of the <b>capsid.</b> It is highly {{antigenic}} and can be used to identify rotavirus species. This protein is used in laboratory tests for rotavirus A infections.|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} the {{properties}} {{of a family of}} related herpes simplex virus type 1 polypeptides (designated p 40) of Mr around 40000. The intracellular localization of these polypeptides has been examined using monoclonal antibodies and their association with viral <b>capsids</b> within the nuclei of infected cells has been demonstrated directly by immunoelectron microscopy. Specific DNA staining and the use of mutants defective for DNA packaging has revealed, in contrast to earlier findings, that p 40 is present in empty <b>capsids.</b> Protein p 40 is not present as a major component of full <b>capsids</b> or of mature virions indicating that it is transiently associated with <b>capsids</b> and that its removal from <b>capsids</b> is linked with the process of DNA packaging...|$|R
40|$|Thrombosis is {{the cause}} of many {{cardiovascular}} syndromes and is a significant contributor to life-threatening diseases, such as myocardial infarction and stroke. Thrombus targeted imaging agents have the capability to provide molecular information about pathological clots, potentially improving detection, risk stratification, and therapy of thrombosis-related diseases. Nanocarriers are a promising platform for the development of molecular imaging agents as they can be modified to have external targeting ligands and internal functional cargo. In this work, we report the synthesis and use of chemically functionalized bacteriophage MS 2 <b>capsids</b> as biomolecule-based nanoparticles for fibrin imaging. The <b>capsids</b> were modified using an oxidative coupling reaction, conjugating ∼ 90 copies of a fibrin targeting peptide to the exterior of each protein shell. The ability of the multivalent, targeted <b>capsids</b> to bind fibrin was first demonstrated by determining the impact on thrombin-mediated clot formation. The modified <b>capsids</b> out-performed the free peptides and were shown to inhibit clot formation at effective concentrations over ten-fold lower than the monomeric peptide alone. The installation of near-infrared fluorophores on the interior surface of the <b>capsids</b> enabled optical detection of binding to fibrin clots. The targeted <b>capsids</b> bound to fibrin, exhibiting higher signal-to-background than control, non-targeted MS 2 -based nanoagents. The in vitro assessment of the <b>capsids</b> suggests that fibrin-targeted MS 2 <b>capsids</b> could be used as delivery agents to thrombi for diagnostic or therapeutic applications...|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} viral <b>capsids</b> are also icosahedral, {{composed}} of hexameric and pentameric proteins, but currently {{there is no}} evidence suggesting any evolutionary relationship between the carboxysome shell and viral <b>capsids.</b>|$|R
5|$|Poliovirus is {{composed}} of an RNA genome and a protein <b>capsid.</b> The genome is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome that is about 7500 nucleotides long. The viral particle is about 30 nm in diameter with icosahedral symmetry. Because of its short genome and its simple composition—only RNA and a nonenveloped icosahedral protein coat that encapsulates it, poliovirus {{is widely regarded as}} the simplest significant virus.|$|E
5|$|The genome of {{rotavirus}} {{consists of}} 11 unique double helix molecules of RNA which are 18,555 nucleotides in total. Each helix, or segment, is a gene, numbered 1 to 11 by decreasing size. Each gene codes for one protein, except genes 9, which codes for two. The RNA {{is surrounded by}} a three-layered icosahedral protein <b>capsid.</b> Viral particles are up to 76.5nm in diameter and are not enveloped.|$|E
5|$|Complex: These viruses {{possess a}} <b>capsid</b> that is neither purely helical nor purely icosahedral, {{and that may}} possess extra {{structures}} such as protein tails or a complex outer wall. Some bacteriophages, such as Enterobacteria phage T4, have a complex structure consisting of an icosahedral head bound to a helical tail, which may have a hexagonal base plate with protruding protein tail fibres. This tail structure acts like a molecular syringe, attaching to the bacterial host and then injecting the viral genome into the cell.|$|E

40|$|SummaryWe {{report a}} study of the {{structural}} dynamics of viral <b>capsids,</b> simulated on a microsecond timescale, by employing a coarse-graining molecular dynamics method. The method was calibrated against an all-atom simulation of one complete virus. Among the studied <b>capsids,</b> some collapsed rapidly, while others were found to be stable. Interlocking between coat proteins is found to be a key factor determining the stability of the <b>capsids...</b>|$|R
40|$|The nanoindentation {{response}} of empty viral <b>capsids</b> is modeled using three-dimensional finite element analysis. Simulation with two different geometries, spherical and icosahedral, {{is performed using}} the finite element code Abaqus. The <b>capsids</b> are modeled as nonlinear Hookean elastic, and both small and large deformation analysis is performed. The Young's modulus is determined by calibrating the force-indentation curve to data from atomic force microscopy (AFM) experiments. Force-indentation curves for three different viral <b>capsids</b> are directly compared to experimental data. Predictions are made for two additional viral <b>capsids.</b> The results from the simulation showed a good agreement with AFM data. The paper demonstrates that over {{the entire range of}} virus sizes (or Foppl-von Karman numbers) spherical and icosahedral models yield different force responses. In particular, it is shown that <b>capsids</b> with dominantly spherical shape (for low Foppl-von Karman numbers) exhibit nearly linear relationship between force and indentation, which has been experimentally observed on the viral shell studies so far. However, we predict that <b>capsids</b> with significant faceting (for large Foppl-von Karman numbers) and thus more pronounced icosahedral shape will exhibit rather nonlinear deformation behavior...|$|R
5|$|RNA {{interference}} is {{an important}} innate defence against viruses. Many viruses have a replication strategy that involves double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). When such a virus infects a cell, it releases its RNA molecule or molecules, which immediately bind to a protein complex called a dicer that cuts the RNA into smaller pieces. A biochemical pathway – the RISC complex, is activated, which ensures cell survival by degrading the viral mRNA. Rotaviruses have evolved to avoid this defence mechanism by not uncoating fully inside the cell, and releasing newly produced mRNA through pores in the particle's inner <b>capsid.</b> Their genomic dsRNA remains protected inside {{the core of the}} virion.|$|E
5|$|The {{first step}} in fusion {{involves}} the high-affinity attachment of the CD4 binding domains of gp120 to CD4. Once gp120 is bound with the CD4 protein, the envelope complex undergoes a structural change, exposing the chemokine receptor binding domains of gp120 and allowing them {{to interact with the}} target chemokine receptor. This allows for a more stable two-pronged attachment, which allows the N-terminal fusion peptide gp41 to penetrate the cell membrane. Repeat sequences in gp41, HR1, and HR2 then interact, causing the collapse of the extracellular portion of gp41 into a hairpin. This loop structure brings the virus and cell membranes close together, allowing fusion of the membranes and subsequent entry of the viral <b>capsid.</b>|$|E
5|$|Viral genomes are circular, {{as in the}} polyomaviruses, or linear, as in the adenoviruses. The type of {{nucleic acid}} is {{irrelevant}} {{to the shape of}} the genome. Among RNA viruses and certain DNA viruses, the genome is often divided up into separate parts, in which case it is called segmented. For RNA viruses, each segment often codes for only one protein and they are usually found together in one <b>capsid.</b> However, all segments are not required {{to be in the same}} virion for the virus to be infectious, as demonstrated by brome mosaic virus and several other plant viruses.|$|E
40|$|Adsorption of 125 I-labeled polyoma virions and <b>capsids</b> to {{the surface}} of mouse kidney cells (MKC) and guinea pig {{erythrocytes}} was examined. Purified polyoma <b>capsids</b> lack the ability to compete with polyoma virions for specific binding sites on the surface of MKC. These same <b>capsids</b> were, however, able to block virion adsorption to guinea pig erythrocytes. UV-inactivated virions blocked cellular receptors on MKC and thus inhibited infectious virions from infecting the cells. <b>Capsids</b> were unable to inhibit virion infection of MKC. Adsorption of polyoma virions to MKC and infection of these cells were found to be independent of the ability of the virions to agglutinate guinea pig erythrocytes...|$|R
40|$|In cells {{infected}} with herpes simplex viruses the <b>capsids</b> acquire an envelope at the nuclear membrane {{and are usually}} found in the cytoplasm in structures bound by membranes. Infected cells also accumulate unenveloped <b>capsids</b> alone or juxtaposed to cytoplasmic membranes. The juxtaposed <b>capsids</b> have been variously interpreted as either undergoing terminal deenvelopment resulting from fusion of the envelope with the membrane of the cytoplasmic vesicles or undergoing sequential envelopment and deenvelopment as <b>capsids</b> transit the cytoplasm into the extracellular space. Recent reports have shown that (i) wild-type virus attaches to but does not penetrate cells expressing glycoprotein D (G. Campadelli-Fiume, M. Arsenakis, F. Farabegoli, and B. Roizman, J. Virol. 62 : 159 - 167, 1988) and that (ii) a mutation in glycoprotein D enables the mutant virus to productively infect cells expressing the wild-type glycoprotein (G. Campadelli-Fiume, S. Qi, E. Avitabile, L. Foa-Tomasi, R. Brandimarti, and B. Roizman, J. Virol. 64 : 6070 - 6079, 1990). If the unenveloped <b>capsids</b> in the cytoplasm result from fusion of the cytoplasmic membranes with the envelopes of viruses transiting the cytoplasm, cells {{infected with}} virus carrying the mutation in glycoprotein D should contain many more unenveloped <b>capsids</b> in the cytoplasm inasmuch as {{there would be little}} or no restriction in the fusion of the envelope with cytoplasmic membranes. Comparison of thin sections of baby hamster kidney cells infected with wild-type and mutant viruses indicated that this was the case. Moreover, in contrast to the wild-type parent, the mutant virus was not released efficiently from infected cells. The conclusion that the unenveloped <b>capsids</b> are arrested forms of deenveloped <b>capsids</b> is supported by the observation that the unenveloped <b>capsids</b> were unstable in that they exhibited partially extruded DNA...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the interaction of}} hepatitis B virus <b>capsids</b> lacking a nuclear localization signal with nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) in permeabilized HeLa cells. Confocal and wide-field optical images of the nuclear envelope show well-spaced individual NPCs. Specific interactions of <b>capsids</b> with single NPCs are characterized by extended residence times of <b>capsids</b> in the focal volume which are characterized by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. In addition, single-capsid-tracking experiments using fast wide-field fluorescence microscopy at 50 frames/s allow us to directly observe specific binding via a dual-color colocalization of <b>capsids</b> and NPCs. We find that binding occurs with high probability on the nuclear-pore ring moiety, at 44 ± 9 nm radial distance from the central axis...|$|R
5|$|At the {{prenatal}} and neonatal {{stages of}} life, {{the presence of}} antibodies is provided by passive immunization from the mother. Early endogenous antibody production varies for different kinds of antibodies, and usually appear within {{the first years of}} life. Since antibodies exist freely in the bloodstream, they are said {{to be part of the}} humoral immune system. Circulating antibodies are produced by clonal B cells that specifically respond to only one antigen (an example is a virus <b>capsid</b> protein fragment). Antibodies contribute to immunity in three ways: They prevent pathogens from entering or damaging cells by binding to them; they stimulate removal of pathogens by macrophages and other cells by coating the pathogen; and they trigger destruction of pathogens by stimulating other immune responses such as the complement pathway. Antibodies will also trigger vasoactive amine degranulation to contribute to immunity against certain types of antigens (helminths, allergens).|$|E
5|$|Attachment is a {{specific}} binding between viral <b>capsid</b> proteins and specific receptors on the host cellular surface. This specificity determines the host range of a virus. For example, HIV infects a limited range of human leucocytes. This is because its surface protein, gp120, specifically interacts with the CD4 molecule – a chemokine receptor – which is most commonly found {{on the surface of}} CD4+ T-Cells. This mechanism has evolved to favour those viruses that infect only cells in which they are capable of replication. Attachment to the receptor can induce the viral envelope protein to undergo changes that results in the fusion of viral and cellular membranes, or changes of non-enveloped virus surface proteins that allow the virus to enter.|$|E
5|$|Helical: These viruses are {{composed}} of a single type of capsomere stacked around a central axis to form a helical structure, which may have a central cavity, or tube. This arrangement results in rod-shaped or filamentous virions: These can be short and highly rigid, or long and very flexible. The genetic material, in general, single-stranded RNA, but ssDNA in some cases, is bound into the protein helix by interactions between the negatively charged nucleic acid and positive charges on the protein. Overall, {{the length of a}} helical <b>capsid</b> is related to the length of the nucleic acid contained within it and the diameter is dependent on the size and arrangement of capsomeres. The well-studied tobacco mosaic virus {{is an example of a}} helical virus.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{hydroxyurea}} {{on the development}} of herpes virus is mediated through its inhibitory action on deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis. Concentrations of the drug that suppress the production of infectious virus cause typical developmental anomalies: failure in formation of the normally dense cores or “complete” viral particles, and either faulty or no envelopment of viral <b>capsids</b> by membranes. The synthesis of viral <b>capsids</b> and virus-stimulated nuclear and cytoplasmic membranes, however, is not interrupted. Combining these results with those of time sequence experiments, the following hypotheses can be presented regarding viral development. Protein synthesis, which is characterized by <b>capsids</b> enclosing cores of low density, precedes DNA synthesis, which is characterized by the appearance of dense cores. <b>Capsids</b> with dense cores are selectively transported to the cytoplasm. Envelopment generally takes place as <b>capsids</b> pass from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. The process of envelopment is also selective, with the result that the majority of particles that have an envelope contain a full quota of DNA...|$|R
40|$|Secondary envelopment of {{herpes simplex}} virus type 1 has been {{demonstrated}} as taking place at the trans-Golgi network (TGN). The inner tegument proteins pUL 36 and pUL 37 and the envelope glycoproteins gD and gE {{are known to be}} important for secondary envelopment. We compared the cellular localizations of <b>capsids</b> from a virus mutant lacking the UL 37 gene with those of a virus mutant lacking the genes encoding gD and gE. Although wild-type <b>capsids</b> accumulated at the TGN, <b>capsids</b> of the pUL 37 − mutant were distributed throughout the cytoplasm and showed no association with TGN-derived vesicles. This was in contrast to <b>capsids</b> from a gD−gE− mutant, which accumulated in the vicinity of TGN vesicles, but did not colocalize with them, suggesting that they were transported to the TGN but were unable to undergo envelopment. We conclude that the inner tegument protein pUL 37 is required for directing <b>capsids</b> to the TGN, where secondary envelopment occurs...|$|R
40|$|We have {{previously}} shown that IFN-β inhibits hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication by noncytolytic mechanisms that either destabilize pregenomic (pg) RNA-containing <b>capsids</b> or prevent their assembly. Using immortalized murine hepatocyte cell lines stably transfected with a doxycycline (dox) -inducible HBV replication system, we now show that replication-competent pgRNA-containing <b>capsids</b> are not produced when the cells are pretreated with IFN-β before HBV expression is induced with dox. Furthermore, the turnover rate of preformed HBV RNA-containing <b>capsids</b> is not {{changed in the}} presence of IFN-β or IFN-γ under conditions in which further pgRNA synthesis is inhibited by dox removal. In summary, these results demonstrate that types 1 and 2 IFN activate hepatocellular mechanism(s) that prevent the formation of replication-competent HBV <b>capsids</b> and, thereby, inhibit HBV replication...|$|R
