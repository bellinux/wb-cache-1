5|$|Super Mario World was ported to the Game Boy Advance as Super Mario World: Super Mario Advance 2 between 2001 and 2002. It {{features}} {{the same number}} of levels as the original, Game Link <b>Cable</b> <b>support</b> for four players and the ability to save. Further differences include the inclusion of Luigi as a playable character and a toned down difficulty. In the United States, Super Mario Advance 2 sold 2.5 million copies and earned $74 million in revenue by August 2006. During the period between January 2000 and August 2006, it became the second highest-selling portable game in that country. It received positive reviews from critics upon its release.|$|E

The U. S. Bureau of Mines, in researching alternatives to traditional roof support methods, designed and installed high-strength <b>cable</b> <b>supports</b> to improve the stability of longwall gate road and bleeder entries in a Western U. S. coal mine. With the cooperation of industry, methods were developed to install <b>cable</b> <b>supports</b> in a tailgate and bleeder entry test area using traditional resin cartridges. Resin-grouted cable bolts were also installed and evaluated in additional longwall gate road and bleeder entry systems at the study mine. The cable-bolted areas successfully maintained roof support throughout the tailgate and bleeder entries. <b>Cable</b> <b>supports</b> replaced wood cribbing as secondary support in the bleeder entry system and minimized the use of cribbing in the longwall tailgate entries. This report describes the theory, application, and advantages of <b>cable</b> <b>supports</b> and presents mine measurements made to assess the cable performance during the retreat process of longwall mining...|$|R

40|$|<b>Cable</b> <b>supported</b> {{structures}} {{offer an}} elegant and economical solution for bridging over long spans with resultant low material content {{and ease of}} construction. These structures, however, tend to be slender and flexible as the structural stiffness mainly depends on the suspending cables. In this paper a <b>cable</b> <b>supported</b> bridge model with pre-tensioned reverse profiled cables is proposed {{to carry out a}} conceptual study on the vibration characteristics of shallow suspension pedestrian bridge structures. Effects of some structural parameters such as cable sag, cross sectional area, applied mass and pre-tensions in the reverse profiled cables have been investigated. Numerical results show that for <b>cable</b> <b>supported</b> bridges with shallow sag the lowest frequencies correspond to lateral and torsional vibration modes which are always combined together and become two types of coupled modes: coupled lateral-torsional modes, as well as coupled torsional-lateral modes. The effects of structural parameters are complex and the natural frequencies can be altered by introducing different pre-tensions in the reverse profiled cables...|$|R
