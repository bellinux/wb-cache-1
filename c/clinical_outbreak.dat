40|$|International audienceNecrotic {{enteritis}} in broiler chickens {{is associated}} with type A, carrying the NetB toxin. C. type A {{is also a member}} of the normal intestinal microbiota of broilers. Clinically healthy chickens carry several different clones in their intestine. In flocks suffering from necrotic enteritis, however, mostly only one single clone is isolated from the gut of all the diseased animals. Selective proliferation of these <b>clinical</b> <b>outbreak</b> strains in the gut and spread within the flock seems likely, but an explanation has not yet been given. The hypothesis that necrotic enteritis associated strains might suppress the growth of normal microbiota strains, was therefore tested. Twenty-six strains isolated from healthy broilers and 24 <b>clinical</b> <b>outbreak</b> isolates were evaluated for their ability to induce intra-species growth-inhibition in an setup. A significantly higher proportion of the <b>clinical</b> <b>outbreak</b> strains inhibited the growth of other strains compared to strains isolated from the gut of healthy chickens. It is proposed that, in addition to toxin production, intra-species inhibition may be a virulence trait that contributes to the ability of certain strains to cause necrotic enteritis in broilers...|$|E

40|$|A better {{understanding}} of the variation in infectivity and its relation with clinical signs may help to improve measures to control and prevent (<b>clinical)</b> <b>outbreaks</b> of diseases. Here we investigated the role of disease severity on infectivity and transmission of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, a bacterium causing respiratory problems in pig farms. We carried out transmission experiments with 10 pairs of caesarean-derived, colostrum-deprived pigs. In each pair, one pig was inoculated intranasally with 5 x 10 (6) CFUs of A. pleuropneumoniae strain 1536 and housed together with a contact pig. Clinical signs were scored and the course of infection was observed by bacterial examination and qPCR analysis of tonsillar brush and nasal swab samples. In 6 out of 10 pairs transmission to contact pigs was observed, but disease scores in contact infected pigs were low compared to the score in inoculated pigs. Whereas disease score was positively associated with bacterial load in inoculated pigs and bacterial load with the transmission rate, the disease score had a negative association with transmission. These findings indicate that in pigs with equal bacterial load, those with higher clinical scores transmit A. pleuropneumoniae less efficiently. Finally, the correlation between disease score in inoculated pigs and in positive contact pigs was low. Although translation of experimental work towards farm level has limitations, our results suggest that <b>clinical</b> <b>outbreaks</b> of A. pleuropneumoniae are unlikely to be caused only by spread of the pathogen by clinically diseased pigs, but may rather be the result of development of clinical signs in already infected pigs...|$|R

40|$|During July 1992, {{an acute}} <b>clinical</b> <b>outbreak</b> of proliferative kidney disease (PKD) was {{experienced}} in two strains (‘Irish’ and ‘Norwegian’) of juvenile (age 0 +) Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) held at two adjacent freshwater {{sites on the}} River Lee in southern Ireland. Various management strategies (including reduced stocking densities, handling, feeding rates and increased oxygenation), and treatment regimes (involving malachite green and fumagillin DCH) were used to control the disease. A total of 1 · 3 million juveniles died during the PKD outbreak, representing 61 · 6 % and 54 · 6 % of the Norwegian stock at the two farms respectively.

40|$|Cattle are {{recognized}} as {{an important source of}} foodborne Salmonella causing human illness, particularly for antimicrobial-resistant strains. The transmission dynamics of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Salmonella after the onset of a <b>clinical</b> <b>outbreak</b> in a dairy farm has been rarely monitored. The early transmission of a pathogen influences the outbreak size and persistence of the pathogen at the farm level and, therefore, how long the herd represents a risk for Salmonella zoonotic transmission. The objective {{of this study was to}} describe the transmission dynamics of MDR Salmonella Typhimurium after the onset of a <b>clinical</b> <b>outbreak</b> in a dairy herd. For that purpose, fecal shedding and serological response to MDR Salmonella were monitored in a longitudinal study conducted in a dairy herd after a few cases of salmonellosis, and a stochastic transmission model was developed to predict Salmonella persistence at the pen level. The outbreak was limited to five clinical cases, and only 18 animals out of 500 cows shed Salmonella in feces. The longest shedder was culture-positive for Salmonella for at least 68 days. The isolates (n[*]=[*] 27) were represented by four pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns; three patterns were similar. With one exception, isolates were resistant to nine or more antimicrobial drugs. Simulations of the transmission model indicated that approximately 50 % of the outbreaks were likely to die out within 20 days after the first animal was infected. The simulation studies indicated that salmonellosis outbreaks with few clinical cases were likely due to the extinction of the pathogen in the premises in the early phase of the outbreaks.

40|$|AbstractHeart and {{skeletal}} muscle inflammation (HSMI) is an infectious disease causing losses to the Norwegian salmon farming industry {{due to increased}} mortality and high morbidity in infected salmon. The disease is listed as a notifiable disease on list 3 (national list) by the Norwegian Food Safety Authority. HSMI {{is believed to be}} a viral disease, but the association to the recently discovered Piscine reovirus (PRV) remains unclear. Undoubtedly, other factors interact to determine whether PRV-infected fish develop disease or not. In this study, logistic regression was used to model the risk of an outbreak of HSMI at the cohort level, by including spatio-temporal risk factors. The data consisted of fish cohorts grown on geo-referenced farms from 2002 to 2010. The risk factors included were: infection pressure, cohort size (maximum number of fish), cohort index (smolt characteristics), cohort lifespan (months in sea) and a geo-index calculated as the position along a local polynomial regression line based on the longitude and latitude of each farm included in the study. The results showed that the risk of developing HSMI increased with increasing cohort lifespan, increasing infection pressure and increasing cohort size, and was mostly low for cohorts grown on farms in Southern-Norway, high for farms in Mid-Norway and variable for farms in Northern-Norway (based on the geo-index). The final model was used to explore three different scenarios with regards to the risk of developing HSMI, and to calculate the probability for each cohort of developing HSMI, independent of their actual disease-status. The model suggested that the probability of developing HSMI was much higher in Mid-Norway than {{in the rest of the}} country. Even though PRV seems to be widely distributed in the environment, the finding that infection pressure has a large influence on the probability of developing HSMI, suggests that it might be possible to reduce the number of <b>clinical</b> <b>outbreaks,</b> if measures are taken to reduce infection pressure. However, the prospects of controlling the spread of HSMI and reducing <b>clinical</b> <b>outbreaks</b> might be difficult because of indications of large distance spread of the disease...|$|R

The effects of tilmicosin administration in the feed at 400 mg/kg and an injection therapy of clinically diseased pigs with long-acting oxytetracycline (Terramycine (R) LA) at 20 mg/kg body-weight were compared. Both groups, totalling 147 pigs, were compared during a medication period of 15 days and a post-medication period of 11 days by means of different clinical and performance parameters. During the medication period, the tilmicosin group showed a significant advantage with respect to the number of new disease cases (P 0. 05) with respect to the clinical parameters. During the overall study period (26 days), the average daily gain and the feed conversion ratio were both significantly (P < 0. 01) better in pigs from the tilmicosin group compared with pigs from the oxytetracycline group.

In particular, immune-electron-microscopy with convalescent sera is employed to detect etiological agents when there are undiagnosed <b>clinical</b> <b>outbreaks,</b> when alternative diagnostic methods fail {{due to the lack}} of immunological reagents and primers, and when there is no indicative clinical suspect. An overview of immune-electron-microscopy  with convalescent sera’s use in the diagnosis of new and unsuspected viruses in animals of domestic and wild species is provided through the descriptions of the following four diagnostic veterinary cases: (I) enteric viruses of pigs: Porcine Rotavirus, Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus, Porcine Circovirus and Porcine Torovirus; (II) Rotavirus and astrovirus in young turkeys with enteritis; (III) Parvovirus-like particles in pheasants; and (IV) Lagoviruses: Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease Virus and European Brown Hare Syndrome Virus...|$|R
40|$|Infections of the bovine lungworm Dictyocaulus viviparus are {{the main}} cause for {{respiratory}} disease in (young) cattle. Increasing numbers of clinical lungworm infections are being seen in herds of adult dairy cows in the Netherlands. Serological testing {{is one of the}} methods being used to diagnose these infections. Recent studies have suggested the detection of antibodies with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in milk samples instead of sera as a possible tool to diagnose lungworm infections. To assess the value of the detection of antibodies in bulk milk in order to diagnose <b>clinical</b> <b>outbreaks,</b> 16 affected and 21 non-affected (control) herds of adult cattle have been sampled on faeces, sera and bulk milk. Two types of ELISA using two different antigens from adult worms (the ‘Hannover’ ELISA based on a recombinant Major Sperm Protein; the ‘GD’ ELISA based on a specific low molecular weight antigen) were tested. The results were said to be positive or negative in relation to a set cut-off value expressed as Optical Density Ratio (ODR). The ‘Hannover’ ELISA exhibited a sensitivity and specificity of 50...|$|R
40|$|Infectious {{pancreatic}} necrosis is {{a significant}} disease of farmed salmonids resulting in direct economic losses due to high mortality and disease-management costs. Significant outbreaks of the disease occurred in farmed Atlantic salmon in Ireland between 2003 and 2007, associated with imported ova and smolts. As the virus was known {{to occur in the}} country since the development of aquaculture in the 1980 s, this study examined archived samples to determine whether these older isolates were associated with virulent forms. The study showed that two genotypes of IPNV were present in the 1990 s, genotype 3 and genotype 5. A more virulent subtype of the virus first appeared in 2003 associated with <b>clinical</b> <b>outbreaks</b> of IPN, and this subtype is now the most prevalent form of IPNV found in the country. The data also indicated that IPNV in Ireland is more closely related to Scottish and continental European isolates than to Norwegian, Chilean and Australasian genogroup 5 isolates. Peer-reviewed.
