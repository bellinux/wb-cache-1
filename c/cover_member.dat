40|$|This {{invention}} {{relates to}} a hatch and more particularly to a hatch for a space vehicle where the hatch {{has a low}} volume sweep and can be easily manipulated from {{either side of the}} hatch. The hatch system includes an elliptical opening in a bulkhead and an elliptical hatch member. The hatch cover system includes an elliptical port opening in a housing and an elliptical <b>cover</b> <b>member</b> supported centrally by a rotational bearing for rotation about a rotational axis normal to the <b>cover</b> <b>member</b> and by pivot pins in a gimbal member for pivotal movement about axes perpendicular to the rotational axis. Arm members support the gimbal member pivotally by pivot members so that upon rotation and manipulation the <b>cover</b> <b>member</b> can be articulatedly moved from a closed position to the port opening to an out of the way position with a minimum of volume sweep by the <b>cover</b> <b>member...</b>|$|E
40|$|Radiolarians {{extracted}} from the sedimentary <b>cover</b> <b>member</b> of the Amasia ophiolite (NW Armenia), Foraminifera, and microfacies observed in the pre-obduction carbonate platform sequence of the South-Armenian Block (Vedi, SE of Yerevan) provide important time constraints for the geodynamic evolution of the Tethyan realm in the Lesser Caucasus. The radiolarian faunal assemblage {{extracted from}} radiolarites overlying basaltic lavas (Amasia) {{is characterized by the}} presence of Pseudodictyomitra tiara (Holmes), pointing to a Cenomanian age; it establishes the youngest submarine volcanic event of the Tethyan realm preserved in the Lesser Caucasus. The Vedi area allows the detailed study of the obduction of ophiolites onto the South-Armenian Block (SAB), the carbonate sequence of which is overlain conformably by a siliciclastic flysch-type sequence. The last 160. m of the SAB carbonate sequence has been studied during this study; they consist of alternating packstones and grainstones with fragments of echinoderms, gastropods, dasycladale algae and frequent clasts of rudists. The presence of benthic Foraminifera such as Cuneolina gr. pavonia, Daxia cenomana and Pseudocyclammina rugosa argues for a Cenomanian age. The analyzed microfacies and the foraminiferal assemblage suggest a back reef depositional environment. Results from these two distinct geological and paleogeographic areas (the Tethyan oceanic realm preserved in NE Armenia/Amasia and the top of the carbonate sequence of the South-Armenian Block that crops out at Vedi/SE of Yerevan) point to a major geodynamic change that took place during the Cenomanian, involving both the late stage of submarine oceanic magmatic activity and the obduction of ophiolites onto the South-Armenian Block...|$|E

40|$|A {{hypervelocity}} {{impact shield}} assembly for protecting a spacecraft surface from hypervelocity impactors. The shield assembly includes {{at least one}} sacrificial impactor disrupting/shocking layer of hypervelocity impactor disrupting/shocking material. A primary spacing element, including space-rated open cell foam material, is positioned between {{the at least one}} sacrificial impactor disrupting/shocking layer and a spacecraft surface. A <b>cover</b> <b>member</b> is arranged and disposed relative to the sacrificial impactor disrupting/shocking layer and the primary spacing element to maintain the integrity of the hypervelocity impact shield assembly. In the event of exposure to a hypervelocity impactor, the sacrificial impactor disrupting/shocking layer is perforated while shocking the impactor breaking it into fragments, and/or melting it, and/or vaporizing it, thus providing a dispersion {{in the form of an}} expanding debris cloud/plume which spreads the impact energy of the impactor over a volume formed by the primary spacing element between the sacrificial impactor disrupting/shocking layer and the spacecraft surface. This significantly reduces impact lethality at the spacecraft surface. The space-rated open cell foam material provides an extremely lightweight, low-cost, efficient means of spacing and supporting the at least one sacrificial impactor disrupting/shocking layer before, during, and after launch. In a preferred embodiment, the invention is in the form of a multi-shock assembly including a plurality of sacrificial impactor disrupting/shocking layers. In such instance, the hypervelocity impact shield assembly includes a plurality of secondary spacing elements. Each secondary spacing element is positioned adjacent an associated sacrificial impactor disrupting/shocking layer to form a multi-shock subassembly. Thus, a plurality of multi-shock subassemblies are provided which include alternating layers of sacrificial impactor disrupting/shocking layers and secondary spacing elements...|$|E
