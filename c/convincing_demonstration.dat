6000|$|Let us {{begin by}} {{considering}} what constructive forces may exist {{in this new}} plutocracy which already so largely sways American economic and political development. The first impression is one of extravagant and aimless expenditure, of a class irresponsible and wasteful beyond all precedent. One gets a Zolaesque picture of that aspect in Mr. Upton Sinclair's [...] "Metropolis," [...] or the fashionable intelligence of the popular New York Sunday editions, and one finds {{a good deal of}} confirmatory evidence in many incidental aspects of the smart American life of Paris and the Riviera. The evidence in the notorious Thaw trial, after one has discounted its theatrical elements, was still a very <b>convincing</b> <b>demonstration</b> of a rotten and extravagant, because aimless and functionless, class of rich people. But one has to be careful in this matter if one is to do justice to the facts. If a thing is made up of two elements, and one is noisy and glaringly coloured, and the other is quiet and colourless, the first impression created will be that the thing is identical with the element that is noisy and glaringly coloured. One is much less likely to hear of the broad plans {{and the quality of the}} wise, strong and constructive individuals in a class than of their foolish wives, their spendthrift sons, their mistresses, and their moments of irritation and folly.|$|E

I first prove that anything I write on the relation of the sexes is sure to be misleading; and then I proceed to write a Don Juan play. Well, if you insist on asking me why I behave in this absurd way, I can only reply that you asked me to, and that in any case my treatment of the subject may be valid for the artist, amusing to the amateur, and at least intelligible and therefore possibly suggestive to the Philistine. Every man who records his illusions is providing data for the genuinely scientific psychology which the world still waits for. I plank down my view of the existing relations of men to women in the most highly civilized society for what it is worth. It is a view like any other view and no more, neither true nor false, but, I hope, a way of looking at the subject which throws into the familiar order of cause and effect a sufficient body of fact and experience to be interesting to you, if not to the play-going public of London. I have certainly shown little consideration for that public in this enterprise; but I know that it has the friendliest disposition towards you and me as far as it has any consciousness of our existence, and quite understands that what I write for you must pass at a considerable height over its simple romantic head. It will take my books as read and my genius for granted, trusting me to put forth work of such quality as shall bear out its verdict. So we may disport ourselves on our own plane to the top of our bent; and if any gentleman points out that neither this epistle dedicatory nor the dream of Don Juan in the third act of the ensuing comedy is suitable for immediate production at a popular theatre we need not contradict him. Napoleon provided Talma with a pit of kings, with what effect on Talma's acting is not recorded. As for me, what I have always wanted is a pit of philosophers; and this is a play for such a pit.|$|E

40|$|Declarative or {{explicit}} memory refers to those facts or events {{of which we}} are consciously aware and includes semantic knowledge and episodic (autobiographical) memory. Other aspects of past experience may influence behavior without conscious recollection (e. g., Jacoby & Dallas, 1981). These nondeclarative or implicit forms of learning and memory are generally characterized as ac-quired fluency of perceptual and motor performance (e. g., Roediger, 1990). Nondeclarative memory reveals itself in habits, procedural knowledge, perceptual priming, simple sequence learning, single-discriminant forms of classical and operant conditioning, and path-based route learning (for reviews, see Eichenbaum, 1999 b; Mosco-vitch, 2000).

40|$|Integration of {{seasonal}} precipitation forecasts into water resources operations and planning is practically nonexistent, even in regions of scarcity. This is often attributable to water manager's tendency {{to act in}} a risk averse manner, preferring to avoid consequences of poor forecasts, at the expense of unrealized benefits. <b>Convincing</b> <b>demonstrations</b> of forecast value are therefore desirable to support assimilation into practice. A dynamically linked system, including forecast, rainfall-runoff, and hydropower models, is applied to the upper Blue Nile basin in Ethiopia to compare benefits and reliability generated by actual forecasts against a climatology-based approach, commonly practiced in most water resources systems. Processing one hundred decadal sequences demonstrates superior forecast-based benefits in 68 cases, a respectable advancement, however benefits in a few forecast-based sequences are noticeably low, likely to dissuade manager's adoption. A hydropower sensitivity test reveals a propensity toward poor-decision making when forecasts over-predict wet conditions. Tailoring the precipitation forecast to highlight critical dry forecasts minimizes this inclination, resulting in 97 % of the sequences favoring the forecast-based approach. Considering managerial risk preferences for the system, even risk-averse actions, if coupled with forecasts, exhibit superior benefits and reliability compared with risk-taking tendencies conditioned on climatology...|$|R
40|$|International audiencePassive {{metamaterials}} {{have yet}} to be translated into applications on a large scale {{due in large part to}} their limited bandwidth. To overcome this limitation many authors have suggested coupling metamaterials to non-Foster circuits. However, up to now, the number of <b>convincing</b> <b>demonstrations</b> based on non-Foster metamaterials has been very limited. This paper intends to clarify why progress has been so slow, i. e., the fundamental difficulty in making a truly broadband and efficient non-Foster metamaterial. To this end, we consider two families of metamaterials, namely Artificial Magnetic Media and Artificial Magnetic Conductors. In both cases, it turns out that bandwidth enhancement requires negative inductance with almost zero resistance. To estimate bandwidth enhancement with actual non-Foster circuits, we consider two classes of such circuits, namely Linvill and gyrator. The issue of stability being critical, both metamaterial families are studied with equivalent circuits that include advanced models of these non-Foster circuits. Conclusions are different for Artificial Magnetic Media coupled to Linvill circuits and Artificial Magnetic Conductors coupled to gyrator circuits. In the first case, requirements for bandwidth enhancement and stability are very hard to meet simultaneously whereas, in the second case, an adjustment of the transistor gain does significantly increase bandwidth...|$|R

We also carry out a set of control experiments to rule out bias, including simulating medial temporal lobe sources to assess the risk of falsely positive results, and adding different types of displacements to the hippocampal portion of the mesh to test for anatomical specificity of the results. In addition, we test the robustness of this inference by adding co-registration and sensor level noise. We find that the model comparison framework is sensitive to hippocampal activity when co-registration error is - 20 dB. These levels of co-registration error and SNR can now be achieved empirically using recently developed subject-specific head-casts. </p...|$|R

In this paper we first review modeling choices that carry particularly high risks of producing non-generalizable results in the context of STDP in recurrent networks. We then develop a theory for the development of feed-forward structure in random networks and conclude that an unstable fixed point in the dynamics prevents the stable propagation of structure in recurrent networks with weight-dependent STDP. We demonstrate that the key predictions of the theory hold in large-scale simulations. The theory provides insight into the reasons why such development does not take place in unconstrained systems and enables us to identify candidate biologically motivated adaptations to the balanced random network model that might enable it...|$|R

They have also been subject to heavy regulation, much of it biased in favor of large enterprises. Accordingly, it is often argued that manufacturers in these countries perform poorly in several respects: a) markets tolerate inefficient firms, so cross-firm productivity dispersion is high; b) small groups of entrenched oligopolists exploit monopoly power in product markets; and c) many small firms are {{unable or unwilling to}} grow, so important economies of scale go unexploited. The author assesses each of these conjectures, drawing on plant- and firm-level studies of manufacturers {{in developing countries}}. He finds systematic support for none of them. Turnover is substantial, exploited scale economies are modest, and <b>convincing</b> <b>demonstrations</b> of monopoly rents are generally lacking. Overprotection and overregulation are probably less a problem in developing countries then are uncertainty about policies and demand, poor rule of law, and corruption.

And although the econometric evidence on technology diffusion in developing countries is limited, it does suggest that protecting"learning"industries is unlikely to foster productivity growth.
