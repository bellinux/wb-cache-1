25|$|The Computer Command System (CCS), the <b>central</b> <b>controller</b> of the spacecraft, is two 18-bit word, {{interrupt}} type processors with 4096 words each of plated wire, non-volatile memory. During {{most of the}} Voyager mission the two CCS computers on each spacecraft {{were used}} non-redundantly to increase the command and processing capability of the spacecraft. The CCS is nearly identical to the system flown on the Viking spacecraft.|$|E
25|$|The {{core of the}} LZB route center, or <b>central</b> <b>controller,</b> {{consists}} of a 2-of-3 computer system with two computers connected to the outputs and an extra for standby. Each computer has its own power supply and is in its own frame. All 3 computers receive and process inputs and interchange their outputs and important intermediate results. If one disagrees it is disabled and the standby computer takes its place.|$|E
25|$|The CBTC uses {{computers}} on trains {{that report}} into a <b>central</b> <b>controller</b> {{to pinpoint the}} exact location of each train and constantly adjust the speed, spacing and routing of trains to keep trains safe and on schedule. It safely tightens up the spacing between trains so that Metro Line and Capital Line trains can share the same tracks between Health Sciences/Jubilee station and Churchill station. Edmonton Transit runs peak-time trains every 5 minutes through downtown, but this frequency will be increased to every 2.5 minutes when the Metro Line is fully operational.|$|E
5000|$|Magnetic stripe (sometimes [...] "strip") based keycard locks {{function}} {{by running}} the magnetic stripe over a sensor that reads {{the contents of}} the stripe. The stripe's contents are compared to those either stored locally in the lock or those of a central system. Some centralized systems operate using hardwired connections to <b>central</b> <b>controllers</b> while others use various frequencies of radio waves to communicate with the <b>central</b> <b>controllers.</b> Some have the feature of a mechanical (traditional key) bypass in case of loss of power.|$|R

25|$|Large private telelocation or AVL systems send {{data from}} GPS {{receivers}} in vehicles to a dispatch center over their private, user-owned radio backbone. These systems {{are used for}} businesses like parcel delivery and ambulances. Smaller systems which don't justify building a separate radio system use cellular or PCS data services to communicate location data from vehicles to their dispatching center. Location data is periodically polled from each vehicle in a fleet by a <b>central</b> <b>controller</b> or computer. In the simplest systems, data from the GPS receiver is displayed on a map allowing humans to determine the location of each vehicle. More complex systems feed the data into a computer assisted dispatch system which automates the process. For example, the computer assisted dispatch system may check {{the location of a}} call for service and then pick a list of the four closest ambulances. This narrows the dispatcher's choice from the entire fleet to an easier choice of four vehicles.|$|E
500|$|The Men in Black: Alien Attack dark ride {{system was}} {{manufactured}} by MTS, with Rod Millen Special Vehicles theming {{the upper half}} of the ride vehicles. The system consists of two tracks, allowing riders of two vehicles to be pitted against each other. Each vehicle has two onboard computers which control the motion, lighting, audio and game play, with all vehicles communicating wirelessly to a <b>central</b> <b>controller.</b> The vehicles each seat six riders in two rows of three. The ride system consists of a total of 44 vehicles, allowing for 2,200 riders per hour. Riders must be [...] or taller to ride. The infrared guns mounted on the vehicles were developed by Universal in conjunction with toy and laser tag manufacturers. A patent for the ride system was filed on July 8, 1998, and was granted on April 24, 2001. The patent credits Craig Hanna, Jennifer Sauer, and Philip Hettema as the inventors, with Universal Studios as the assignee.|$|E

2500|$|About [...] {{before the}} end of the LZB {{controlled}} section the <b>central</b> <b>controller</b> will send a telegram to announce the end of LZB control.

50|$|An SD-WAN is a Wide Area Network (WAN) managed {{using the}} {{principles}} of software-defined networking. The main driver of SD-WAN is to lower WAN costs using less expensive leased lines, as an alternative or partial replacement of more expensive MPLS lines.

2500|$|From {{that point}} on the train's {{location}} is used to identify a train. When a train enters a new zone it sends a response telegram with the [...] "vehicle location acknowledgement" [...] filed indicating that it has advanced into a new zone. The <b>central</b> <b>controller</b> will then use the new zone when addressing the train in the future. Thus a trains address will gradually increase or decrease, depending on its direction, as it travels along the track. A train identifies that it has entered a new zone by either detecting the cable transposition point in the cable or when it has traveled [...] A train can miss detecting up to 3 transposition points and still remain under LZB control.|$|E

30|$|Expecting the {{resource}} allocation strategy to be strategy proof {{could be one}} possible solution to the <b>central</b> <b>controller’s</b> dilemma of solving an optimization problem with misrepresented utilities.

5000|$|A common {{implementation}} in buildings with an HVAC central control computer {{is to allow}} the thermostats to provide a graded level of control. Temperatures in such a system are governed by the <b>central</b> <b>controller's</b> settings, which are typically set by the building maintenance staff or HVAC engineers. The individual thermostats in various offices provide the controller with a temperature reading of the zone (provided the thermocouples are not installed as inline duct sensors), but also serve as modifiers for the <b>central</b> <b>controller's</b> set point. While the thermostat may include settings from, for example, 60 to 90 F, the actual effect of the thermostat is to apply [...] "pressure" [...] to the <b>central</b> <b>controller's</b> set point. Thus, if the controller's setting is 72 F, setting the thermostat to its maximum warm or cool settings will deflect the output temperature, generally by only a few degrees Fahrenheit (about two degrees Celsius) at most. So, although the thermostat can be set to its lowest marking of 60 F, in reality, it may only change the HVAC system's output temperature to 70 F. In this case, the thermostat has a [...] "swing" [...] of 4 °F (2 °C) — it can alter the produced temperature from the main controller's set point by a maximum of 2 °F (1 °C) in either direction. Consequently, while not purely a placebo, the thermostat in this setup does not provide the level of control that is expected, but {{the combination of the}} lower setting number and the feeling of a slight change in temperature can induce the office occupants to believe that the temperature was significantly decreased.|$|R

5000|$|Insteon is an {{integrated}} dual-mesh (formerly {{referred to as}} [...] "dual-band") network that combines wireless radio frequency (RF) and a building's existing electrical wiring.
