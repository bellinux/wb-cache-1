5|$|In 1944, Republic Aviation's chief designer, Alexander Kartveli, {{began working}} on a turbojet-powered {{replacement}} for the P-47 Thunderbolt piston-engined fighter. The initial attempts to redesign the P-47 to accommodate a jet engine proved futile due to the large cross-section of the early <b>centrifugal</b> <b>compressor</b> turbojets. Instead, Kartveli and his team designed a new aircraft with a streamlined fuselage largely occupied by an axial compressor turbojet engine and fuel stored in rather thick unswept wings.|$|E
25|$|Below, is {{a partial}} list of <b>centrifugal</b> <b>compressor</b> {{applications}} each with {{a brief description of}} some of the general characteristics possessed by those compressors. To start this list two of the most well-known <b>centrifugal</b> <b>compressor</b> applications are listed; gas turbines and turbochargers.|$|E
25|$|The inlet to a <b>centrifugal</b> <b>compressor</b> is {{typically}} a simple pipe. It may include {{features such as}} a valve, stationary vanes/airfoils (used to help swirl the flow) and both pressure and temperature instrumentation. All of these additional devices have important uses in {{the control of the}} <b>centrifugal</b> <b>compressor.</b>|$|E
2500|$|This {{relationship}} {{is the reason}} advances in turbines and axial compressors often {{find their way into}} other turbomachinery including <b>centrifugal</b> <b>compressors.</b> Figures 1.1 and 1.2 [...] illustrate the domain of turbomachinery with labels showing <b>centrifugal</b> <b>compressors.</b> Improvements in <b>centrifugal</b> <b>compressors</b> have not been achieved through large discoveries. Rather, improvements have been achieved through understanding and applying incremental pieces of knowledge discovered by many individuals.|$|R
50|$|Three main loading devices used in turboexpanders are <b>centrifugal</b> <b>compressors,</b> {{electrical}} generators or hydraulic brakes. With <b>centrifugal</b> <b>compressors</b> {{and electrical}} generators the shaft {{power from the}} turboexpander is recouped either to recompress the process gas or to generate electrical energy lowering utility bills.|$|R
40|$|LecturePg. 47 - 57. <b>Centrifugal</b> <b>compressors</b> used {{in various}} plants come in diverse {{specifications}} {{with regard to}} capacity, pressure and gas handled. In designing such compressors, important considerations are to shorten design time and save labor {{as well as to}} meet user's requirements. In view of these needs, the authors developed a design automation system and has successfully applied the system to the design of all <b>centrifugal</b> <b>compressors</b> for various chemical plants. Design automation of such <b>centrifugal</b> <b>compressors</b> are described...|$|R
25|$|Figure 5.2, a <b>centrifugal</b> <b>compressor</b> {{performance}} map (either test or estimated), shows flow, {{pressure ratio}} {{for each of}} 4 speed-lines (total of 23 data points). Also included are constant efficiency contours. <b>Centrifugal</b> <b>compressor</b> performance presented in this form provides enough information to match the hardware represented by the map to a simple set of end-user requirements.|$|E
25|$|The {{shape of}} Figure 5.2's speed lines {{provides}} {{a good example of}} why it is inappropriate to use the term choke in association with a maximum flow of all <b>centrifugal</b> <b>compressor</b> speed lines. In summary; most industrial and commercial centrifugal compressors are selected or designed to operate at or near their highest efficiencies and to avoid operation at low efficiencies. For this reason there is seldom a reason to illustrate <b>centrifugal</b> <b>compressor</b> performance below 60% efficiency.|$|E
25|$|Ideally, <b>centrifugal</b> <b>compressor</b> {{impellers}} have thin airfoil blades {{that are}} strong, each {{mounted on a}} light rotor. This material {{would be easy to}} machine or cast and inexpensive. Additionally, it would generate no operating noise, have an life while operating in any environment.|$|E

40|$|PaperPg. 10 - 25. The {{operation}} and maintenance of <b>centrifugal</b> <b>compressors</b> varies considerably depending upon the size, speed, horsepower, and type of driver. Typical <b>centrifugal</b> <b>compressors</b> vary from high speed, low flow applications to very large flow, low speed machines. Each has its own operating and maintenance problems. <b>Centrifugal</b> <b>compressors</b> are normally driven by electric motors and speed increasing gears for the low flow, low horsepower applications. The middle size ranges are usually motor-gear, steam turbine or gas turbine direct connected combinations. The very large flow, large horsepower machines are practically all steam turbine driven with a few being driven by gas turbine where natural gas fuel is available. <b>Centrifugal</b> <b>compressors</b> can be designed and built with {{operation and}} ease of maintenance practices in mind. Specific items such as off-design operation, bearings and seals, casing design and mounting, and lubrication systems are discussed...|$|R
25|$|<b>Centrifugal</b> <b>compressors,</b> {{sometimes}} termed radial compressors, are a sub-class {{of dynamic}} axisymmetric work-absorbing turbomachinery.|$|R
25|$|The turbocharger's {{compressor}} draws {{in ambient}} air and compresses {{it before it}} enters into the intake manifold at increased pressure. This results in a greater mass of air entering the cylinders on each intake stroke. The power needed to spin the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>compressor</b> {{is derived from the}} kinetic energy of the engine's exhaust gases.|$|E
25|$|Diagonal or {{mixed-flow}} compressors {{are similar}} to centrifugal compressors, but have a radial and axial velocity component {{at the exit from}} the rotor. The diffuser is often used to turn diagonal flow to an axial rather than radial direction. Comparative to the conventional <b>centrifugal</b> <b>compressor</b> (of the same stage pressure ratio), the value of the speed of the mixed flow compressor is 1.5 times larger.|$|E
25|$|A simple <b>centrifugal</b> <b>compressor</b> {{has four}} {{components:}} inlet, impeller/rotor, diffuser, and collector. Figure 3.1 shows {{each of the}} components of the flow path, with the flow (working gas) entering the centrifugal impeller axially from right to left. As a result of the impeller rotating clockwise when looking downstream into the compressor, the flow will pass through the volute's discharge cone moving away from the figure's viewer.|$|E

25|$|In {{automotive}} {{engine and}} diesel engine turbochargers and superchargers. Ref. Figure 1.1 Centrifugal compressors {{used in conjunction}} with reciprocating internal combustion engines are known as turbochargers if driven by the engine’s exhaust gas and turbo-superchargers if mechanically driven by the engine. Standards set by the industry for turbochargers may have been established by SAE. Ideal gas properties often work well for the design, test and analysis of turbocharger <b>centrifugal</b> <b>compressor</b> performance.|$|E
25|$|Centrifugal {{compressors}} {{are also}} similar to centrifugal {{fans of the}} style shown in neighboring figure as they both increase the flows energy through increasing radius. In contrast to centrifugal fans, compressors operate at higher speeds to generate greater pressure rises. In many cases the engineering methods used to design a centrifugal fan {{are the same as}} those to design a <b>centrifugal</b> <b>compressor.</b> As a result, they can at times look very similar.|$|E
25|$|Regarding {{gas turbine}} {{operation}} and performance, {{there may be}} a series of guaranteed points established for the gas turbine’s <b>centrifugal</b> <b>compressor.</b> These requirements are of secondary importance to the overall gas turbine performance as a whole. For this reason it is only necessary to summarize that in the ideal case, the lowest specific fuel consumption would occur when the centrifugal compressors peak efficiency curve coincides with the gas turbine's required operation line.|$|E
25|$|Air-conditioning and {{refrigeration}} and HVAC: <b>Centrifugal</b> <b>compressors</b> {{quite often}} supply the compression in water chillers cycles. Because {{of the wide}} variety of vapor compression cycles (thermodynamic cycle, thermodynamics) and {{the wide variety of}} workings gases (refrigerants), <b>centrifugal</b> <b>compressors</b> are used {{in a wide range of}} sizes and configurations. Use of real gas properties is needed to properly design, test and analyze the performance of these machines. Standards set by the industry for these compressors include ASHRAE, ASME & API.|$|R
50|$|Although large flow {{compressors}} {{are usually}} all-axial, the rear stages on smaller units {{are too small}} to be robust. Consequently, these stages are often replaced by a single centrifugal unit. Very small flow compressors often employ two <b>centrifugal</b> <b>compressors,</b> connected in series. Although in isolation <b>centrifugal</b> <b>compressors</b> are capable of running at quite high pressure ratios (e.g. 10:1), impeller stress considerations limit the pressure ratio that can be employed in high overall pressure ratio engine cycles.|$|R

The operating envelope {{and the range of}} applications are outlined; a number of installations and operating records of this seal on integrally geared <b>centrifugal</b> <b>compressors,</b> as manufactured for the process industry, are also discussed...|$|R
25|$|Centrifugal {{compressors}} {{are also}} similar to centrifugal pumps {{of the style}} shown in the adjacent figures. The key difference between such compressors and pumps is that the compressor working fluid is a gas (compressible) and the pump working fluid is liquid (incompressible). Again, the engineering methods used to design a centrifugal pump {{are the same as}} those to design a <b>centrifugal</b> <b>compressor.</b> Yet, there is one important difference: the need to deal with cavitation in pumps.|$|E
25|$|An uprated version, the 2300lbf (10.23kN) thrust FJ44-2A, was {{introduced}} in 1997. It has a larger 21.7 in (551mm) diameter fan, with two additional booster stages to increase core flow. Owing to stressing considerations, the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>compressor</b> is throttled-back aerodynamically to a lower HPC pressure ratio than the -1. Other features include an exhaust mixer and an electronic fuel control unit. The 2400lbf (10.68kN) thrust FJ44-2C {{is similar to the}} -2A, but incorporates an integrated hydromechanical fuel control unit.|$|E
25|$|Compared to {{estimating}} performance {{which is}} very cost effective (thus useful in design), testing, while costly, {{is still the most}} precise method. Further, testing <b>centrifugal</b> <b>compressor</b> performance is very complex. Professional societies such as ASME (i.e. PTC–10, Fluid Meters Handbook, PTC-19.x), ASHRAE (ASHRAE Handbook) and API (ANSI/API 617-2002, 672-2007) have established standards for detailed experimental methods and analysis of test results. Despite this complexity, a few basic concepts in performance can be presented by examining an example test performance map.|$|E

40|$|PaperPg. 1 - 6. <b>Centrifugal</b> <b>{{compress}}ors</b> {{have been}} used to compress oxygen for at least 25 years. Until ten years ago, the flows were relatively small and discharge pressures were relatively low. In the mid 1960 's the size of single train oxygen plants increased dramatically, and this allowed discharge pressures from the centrifugal machine in the 28 to 41 bar range. Change in the design and installation of <b>centrifugal</b> oxygen <b>compressors</b> evolved in the late 1960 's {{as a result of the}} increase in both size and discharge pressure. It also made consideration of 69 bar discharges possible after experience was gained with the 41 bar discharge level. The rapid change in the state of the art of application of <b>centrifugal</b> <b>compressors</b> to oxygen service in conjunction with the known hazards of the gas has prompted this discourse. Consideration will be given to the application including safety features, materials of construction, cleanliness required, desirable installation and maintenance features and the present and projected design limits for these <b>centrifugal</b> <b>compressors...</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{collector}} of a <b>centrifugal</b> <b>compressor</b> {{can take many}} shapes and forms. When the diffuser discharges into a large empty chamber, the collector may be termed a Plenum. When the diffuser discharges into a device that looks somewhat like a snail shell, bull's horn or a French horn, the collector {{is likely to be}} termed a volute or scroll. As the name implies, a collector’s purpose is to gather the flow from the diffuser discharge annulus and deliver this flow to a downstream pipe. Either the collector or the pipe may also contain valves and instrumentation to control the compressor.|$|E
25|$|With {{regard to}} the {{equation}} of state, {{it is important to}} remember that while air and nitrogen properties (near standard atmospheric conditions) are easily and accurately estimated by this simple relationship, there are many <b>centrifugal</b> <b>compressor</b> applications where the ideal relationship is inadequate. For example, centrifugal compressors used for large air conditioning systems (water chillers) use a refrigerant as a working gas that cannot be modeled as an ideal gas. Another example are centrifugal compressors design and built for the petroleum industry. Most of the hydrocarbon gases such as methane and ethylene are best modeled as a real gas equation of state rather than ideal gases. The Wikipedia entry for equations of state is very thorough.|$|E
25|$|Although Griffith {{was well}} known due to his earlier work on metal fatigue and stress measurement, little work appears to have started {{as a direct result}} of his paper. The only obvious effort was a {{test-bed}} compressor built by Hayne Constant, Griffith's colleague at the Royal Aircraft Establishment. Other early jet efforts, notably those of Frank Whittle and Hans von Ohain, were based on the more robust and better understood <b>centrifugal</b> <b>compressor</b> which was widely used in superchargers. Griffith had seen Whittle's work in 1929 and dismissed it, noting a mathematical error, and going on to claim that the frontal size of the engine would make it useless on a high-speed aircraft.|$|E
