5|$|The {{speculation}} of {{the existence}} of life on Venus decreased significantly since the early 1960s, when spacecraft began studying Venus and it became <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> conditions on Venus are extreme compared to those on Earth.|$|E
5|$|Adonis {{originally}} was a Phoenician god of fertility representing {{the spirit of}} vegetation. It is further speculated {{that he was an}} avatar of the version of Ba'al, worshipped in Ugarit. It is likely that lack of clarity concerning whether Myrrha was called Smyrna, and who her father was, originated in Cyprus before the Greeks first encountered the myth. However, it is <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Greeks added much to the Adonis-Myrrha story, before it was first recorded by classical scholars.|$|E

5|$|Arise is {{the fourth}} studio album by Brazilian heavy metal band Sepultura, {{released}} in 1991 by Roadrunner Records. Upon its release, the album received top reviews from heavy metal magazines such as Rock Hard, Kerrang! and Metal Forces. Arise is considered Sepultura's finest hour among longtime fans. While the music on Arise was mostly in the same death/thrash style as their previous album, Beneath the Remains, it was <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Sepultura sound was acquiring an experimental edge.|$|E
5|$|As Näslund's {{free agency}} {{approached}} on 1 July 2008, Näslund made it <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{style of play}} and the player personnel of a team would be important factors in determining which team he would sign with after his contract with the Canucks expired. He was admittedly frustrated with Vigneault's defensive coaching style.|$|E

5|$|By July 1918, it was <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> German Spring Offensive on the Western Front, {{which had}} forced the {{postponement}} of offensive plans in Palestine, had failed, {{resulting in a}} return to trench warfare on the Western Front.

5|$|In 2006 the Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage {{announced}} {{they would be}} working to preserve the railways and ferries, and in 2008 it became <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> directorate was working with an application for the Rjukan Line, the Tinnoset Line and the ferries {{to be included in}} a UNESCO World Heritage Site along with the closed plants in Rjukan and Odda.|$|E
5|$|It is <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> demoralised {{and tired}} Greeks were {{no match for}} the Persians, and were {{completely}} routed in the battle which ensued at Ephesus. Many were killed, including the Eretrian general, Eualcides. The Ionians who escaped the battle made for their own cities, while the remaining Athenians and Eretrians managed to return to their ships and sailed back to Greece.|$|E

25|$|It was {{becoming}} <b>clearer</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ILP was diverging {{further away from}} the Labour Party and at the 1931 ILP Scottish Conference {{the issue of whether}} the party should still affiliate to Labour was discussed.

5|$|It is now <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> common {{ancestor}} of the bony fishes (Osteichthyes) had a primitive air-breathing lung—later {{evolved into a}} swim bladder in most actinopterygians (ray-finned fishes). This suggests that crossopterygians evolved in warm shallow waters, using their simple lung when the oxygen level in the water became too low.|$|E
5|$|Osmium {{has high}} {{reflectivity}} in the ultraviolet {{range of the}} electromagnetic spectrum; for example, at 600 Å osmium has a reflectivity twice that of gold. This high reflectivity is desirable in space-based UV spectrometers, which have reduced mirror sizes due to space limitations. Osmium-coated mirrors were flown in several space missions aboard the Space Shuttle, but it soon became <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> oxygen radicals in the low Earth orbit are abundant enough to significantly deteriorate the osmium layer.|$|E
5|$|Resistance to the German {{occupiers}} {{began in}} Belgium {{in the winter}} of 1940, after the German defeat in the Battle of Britain made it <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> war was not lost for the Allies. Involvement in illegal resistance activity was a decision made by a minority of Belgians (approximately five percent of the population) but many more were involved in passive resistance. If captured, resistance members risked torture and execution, and around 17,000 were killed during the occupation.|$|E

5|$|The LPF formed {{part of a}} {{coalition}} government with the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) and the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD), but internal conflicts in the LPF led to the coalition's break-up and fresh elections after a few months.

It became <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> party was not viable without its original leader, and it went into decline until it was finally dissolved in 2008.|$|E

5|$|The {{two main}} {{parts of the}} wreck of Titanic present a {{striking}} contrast. Although fourteen survivors testified that the ship had broken apart as she sank, this testimony was discounted by the official inquiries, and it was supposed that the ship had sunk intact.

5|$|A {{series of}} air raids were mounted against Bardia in December, {{in the hope}} of persuading the {{garrison}} to withdraw. Once it became <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Italians intended to stand and fight, bombing priorities shifted to the Italian airbases around Tobruk, Derna and Benina. Air raids on Bardia resumed in the lead-up to the ground assault, with 100 bombing sorties flown against Bardia between 31 December 1940 and 2 January 1941, climaxing with a particularly heavy raid by Vickers Wellington bombers of No. 70 Squadron RAF and Bristol Bombay bombers of No. 216 Squadron RAF on the night of 2/3 January 1941. Lysanders of No. 208 Squadron RAF directed the artillery fire. Fighters from No. 33 Squadron RAF, No. 73 Squadron RAF and No. 274 Squadron RAF patrolled between Bardia and Tobruk.|$|E
5|$|According to Roberts, it is <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{next phase}} of {{negotiations}} was intended to go beyond prisoner exchanges, as the prisoner of war negotiator Stilinović was not involved. Đilas and Velebit were passed through the German lines to Sarajevo and were then flown to Zagreb on 25 March in a military aircraft. These negotiations were with German representatives supervised by Ott, apparently on all the points discussed at Gornji Vakuf, and the Partisans {{made it clear to}} the Germans that their proposals did not amount to an offer of surrender. Velebit met personally with Glaise-Horstenau, as the Austrian had known Velebit's father, a Yugoslav general. After this first visit to Zagreb, Velebit visited Partisan commanders in Slavonia and eastern Bosnia passing on orders for the suspension of attacks on the Germans and their rail communications, and the release of prisoners.|$|E
