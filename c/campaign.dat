50|$|When a {{marketing}} building is built, {{it will be}} possible to hire and fire marketers. Marketing associates can be used to create marketing <b>campaigns.</b> As <b>campaigns</b> are created, marketing associate availability drops and the player is forced to build more marketing buildings in order to have more <b>campaigns.</b> These buildings can be upgraded to have more employees and to have more powerful marketing <b>campaigns.</b> Positive <b>campaigns</b> will boost the qualities of the player's product, or negative marketing <b>campaigns</b> to decrease the appeal of an opponents product. For media, there are advertisements to print, and radio and television <b>campaigns.</b> Marketing <b>campaigns</b> can be moved from region to region similarly to a sales executive.|$|R

40|$|Objectives: One of the {{objectives}} of the DRUID project is to develop guidelines for spreading information regarding driving under the influence of drugs and medicines, and this aiming at different target groups, including young drivers, patients, physicians, pharmacists,… We reviewed the state-of-the-art of existing information <b>campaigns</b> regarding psychoactive drugs and driving, as well as the documented effectiveness of those <b>campaigns.</b> Methods: In total 55 institutes were contacted, of which 17 (31 %) responded and 12 (22 %) were able to give information. Information was also gathered through the Internet by means of websites of relevant organizations, Google and YouTube. Results: A total of 75 <b>campaigns</b> were found, from 13 different countries. Twenty-four were launched to inform the general public on the risks associated with driving under the influence of drugs, medicines and/or alcohol. Twenty-nine <b>campaigns</b> were launched to inform young people and 16 <b>campaigns</b> to inform physicians and/or pharmacists. Nine <b>campaigns</b> were designed for teachers, seven <b>campaigns</b> for patients and five <b>campaigns</b> for other target populations. Some <b>campaigns</b> were designed for more than one target group. Information on impact evaluation was available only for seven <b>campaigns.</b> All evaluations showed a positive impact of the <b>campaigns.</b> Conclusions: The majority of the retrieved <b>campaigns</b> concerning driving under the influence of drugs were aiming at young people. The type of medium that is used the most is brochures. Most <b>campaigns</b> are organized by governmental organizations and road safety organizations. As only a few evaluations were found, and these <b>campaigns</b> and their evaluations were performed in many different ways, {{it is not possible to}} draw conclusions concerning the association between the design of the <b>campaigns</b> and their effectiveness...|$|R

As the <b>campaign</b> wore on, the system became better organized and nearly 50 percent were restored to combat duty.|$|E

40|$|This article {{describes}} how {{political parties in}} parliamentary election <b>campaigns</b> in Western Europe make use of negative <b>campaigning</b> and examines whether their behaviour {{differs from that of}} candidates competing in US presidential election <b>campaigns.</b> Furthermore, it theorises how the differences and similarities between negative <b>campaigning</b> in these countries can be explained. First of all, this comparative study adds {{to the development of a}} more general theory on negative <b>campaigning.</b> Second, the study presents interesting new data measuring the use of negative <b>campaigning</b> by 31 political parties in 23 parliamentary election <b>campaigns</b> in Germany, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands between 1980 and 2006. Results show that there are no signs of an increase in negative <b>campaigning</b> and that the majority of attacks are issue attacks. However, there are systematic differences in the overall level of negative <b>campaigning</b> between these countries and we suspect that the type of party system could be the main explanatory factor. © 2013 Political Studies Association...|$|R

5|$|Australians {{played a}} central role in the New Guinea <b>campaign</b> during 1942 and 1943. After an attempt to land troops at Port Moresby was {{defeated}} in the Battle of the Coral Sea, the Japanese attempted to capture the strategically important town by advancing overland across the Owen Stanley Ranges and Milne Bay. Australian Army units defeated these offensives in the Kokoda Track <b>campaign</b> and Battle of Milne Bay with the support of the RAAF and USAAF. Australian and US Army units subsequently assaulted and captured the Japanese bases on the north coast of Papua in the hard-fought Battle of Buna-Gona. The Australian Army also defeated a Japanese attempt to capture the town of Wau in January 1943 and went onto the offensive in the Salamaua-Lae <b>campaign</b> in April. In late 1943, the 7th and 9th Divisions played an important role in Operation Cartwheel, when they landed to the east and west of Lae and secured the Huon Peninsula during the Huon Peninsula <b>campaign</b> and Finisterre Range <b>campaign.</b>|$|E
