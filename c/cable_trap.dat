40|$|The {{currents}} induced in long conductors such as guidewires by {{the radio}} frequency (RF) field in {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) are responsible for potentially dangerous heating of surrounding media, such as tissue. This paper presents an optically-coupled system {{with the potential to}} quantitatively measure the RF currents induced on these conductors. The system uses a self shielded toroid transducer and active circuitry to modulate a high speed LED transmitter. Plastic fiber guides the light to a photodiode receiver and transimpedance amplifier. System validation included a series of experiments with bare wires that compared wire tip heating by fluoroptic thermometers with the RF current sensor response. Validations were performed on a custom whole body 64 MHz birdcage test platform and on a 1. 5 T MRI scanner. With this system, a variety of phenomena were demonstrated including <b>cable</b> <b>trap</b> current attenuation, lossy dielectric Q-spoiling and even transverse electromagnetic wave node patterns. This system should find applications in studies of MRI RF safety for interventional devices such as pacemaker leads, and guidewires. In particular, variations of this device could potentially act as a realtime safety monitor during MRI guided interventions...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Since high SNR is {{necessary}} for high-resolution FMRI it is advantageous to place the coils close against the monkey’s head whenever possible. To this end, we designed a flexible 4 -channel receive-only phased array {{that can be used}} on monkeys of different sizes as well as for different cortical areas. In addition, the preamplifiers including control electronics are detachable and can serve a variety of prefabricated and phase-matched fourelement arrays of different configurations. Methods: A linear array of 4 circular coils of ~ 23 mm diameter with gaps of ~ 11 mm was sutured onto a soft plastic strip (Figure 1). The assembly having in-line connectors was attached to phase-matched coaxial cables to modified commercial high reflection coefficient preamplifiers (Stark Contrast Inc., Erlangen, Germany) via <b>cable</b> <b>traps.</b> Detuning of the individual coils during RF transmission was achieved using DC currents within the coaxial cables and pin diode controlled notch filters within the array elements. Experiments were done on anesthetized monkeys on a vertical 4. 7 T Bruker Biospec running ParaVision 5. The array was positioned over the occipital pole. RF transmission was done with a de-tunable ‘type D’ partial volume coil. We obtained high-resolution FLASH (Figure 2) and FMRI data using EPI with and without acceleration (GRAPPA). The stimulus was a full-field rotating checkerboard. FLASH: resolution 100 x 100 x 1000 μm, TE 23 ms, TR 2000 ms, 1 average; FMRI: GE-EPI, resolution 500 x 500 x 2000 μm, TE 21 ms, TR 750 ms, 8 segments with R = 1, or 4 segments with R = 2. Results: The high-resolution FLASH anatomical images show intracortical veins and the Gennari line in entire V 1, including peripheral V 1, which is located deep in the brain. Using a dual-coil setup, it is only possible to observe these features in parts of V 1 that are close to the surface. The functional map proofs that the increased coverage allows us to obtain activation in V 1 -V 5 in both hemispheres at high resolution (Figure 3). SNR was sufficient to also allow accelerated FMRI at the same resolution. Discussion: Compared to a dual-coil setup the phased array provides improved SNR and coverage, which allows for high resolution anatomical imaging and FMRI of the entire early visual cortex, including better performance in deep brain areas...|$|R
40|$|Purpose/Introduction: Homogeneous {{excitation}} at field strengths {{as high as}} 9. 4 T {{is achieved}} by RF shimming approaches using parallel transmission through an array of independent RF coils. An actively detunable transmit array with 16 -elements arranged in two rows of 8 -elements each was built for this purpose[1]. Receive-only coil arrays constructed using close fitting helmets provide significant gain in SNR over volume coils[2]. In this work, we design a 31 -channel receive-only head array which operates {{in combination with the}} 16 -element transmit array[1]. Subjects and Methods: Experiments were performed on a Siemens 9. 4 T whole body MR scanner with a head gradient insert. 31 -receive elements were arranged in 4 rows on a tight fitting helmet. The top 2 rows have 10 -elements each and there were 7 -elements on the 3 rd row and 4 -elements on the 4 th row. 10 mm spacing was provided between the elements of the same row and they were decoupled inductively. The bottom row was rotated {{in such a way that}} it could be geometrically overlapped with 2 adjacent elements from the top row(Fig. 1). Even though our scanner is equipped with 32 -receive channels, an additional element was not added to one of the bottom 2 rows to preserve the left-right symmetry in the receive array. In addition to a protection fuse, the coil elements have 6 fixed and one variable capacitor. Low noise, small footprint preamplifiers (WanTcom Inc. USA) were installed on the coil. The coil is matched to 50 -Ohms using a tissue equivalent phantom. <b>Cable</b> <b>traps</b> were incorporated before and after the preamplifier and an additional trap was installed on each of the 8 -channel receive cable. Results: Unloaded-Q of a single isolated loop was 158. The coil is sample noise dominated and the QUL/QL was 10 or more depending on the distance to the load. Active detuning during transmit was better than - 33 dB. Maximum coupling measured in the loaded condition was - 12. 2 dB. The low impedance preamplifier provided - 21 dB of decoupling [3]. Figure 2 shows the field map acquired with and without the receive array. Initial in-vivo results shown in Fig. 3 demonstrate high SNR and whole brain coverage at 9. 4 T...|$|R
40|$|International audienceDespite the {{enhanced}} image provided by multiple-channels array coils, an accurate exploration of bowel diseases and {{detailed information about}} the gastrointestinal wall layers are still not available. The use of endoluminal RF coil located {{in the region of}} interest could potentially allow good evaluation of tumor invasion or depth of inflammatory processes [1]. However, since metallic coaxial cables are used, patient safety is threatened due to local electric field concentration that can happen and the associated local high Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) [2]. Moreover, in this case, <b>cable</b> isolation and <b>traps</b> cannot be straightforwardly employed due to limited dimension. Signal transmission based onoptical fiber is an alternative to coaxial cables to solve definitively the electromagnetic issues. On a receiver coil, both signal transmission and decoupling have to be insured. For MR signal transmission, the electro-optical conversion has been partially validated based on electro-optic effect of some crystals [3]. In this work, an active optical decoupling circuit for endoluminal coil is presented and compared to a reference coil with regular decoupling using bias signal though coaxial cable...|$|R
40|$|Polycrystalline lead {{lanthanum}} titanate {{thin film}} having perovskite structure was fabricated by metalorganic deposition (MOD) on a ZrO₂/SiO₂/Si substrate at 600 °C for 1 h in O₂ atmosphere. Columnar structured ZrO₂ buffer layer was also prepared by a MOD process {{under the same}} condition. Electrical measurements were conducted on interdigitated electrodes. The crystalline structure and growth behavior of the films have been studied by x-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. It is observed that dielectric response {{of the film is}} effected by the cable length used in the measurement and by the values of the ac voltage. Long cable gives rise to an additional resonance peak at high frequency caused by the stray inductance of the contacts and cables. The capacitance and loss tangent over low frequency range shows significant variations due to the trapped charges and space charges in the film. These variations are very dependent on the values of the ac voltage and the length of <b>cable.</b> Meanwhile, the <b>trapped</b> charges and space charges lead to abnormal P-E loops, in which the measured remanent polarization and coercive field increase with increasing frequency.

40|$|Gravel-filled traps {{were buried}} in the beds of streams {{draining}} steep logged and unlogged catchments of the Dazzler Range in northern Tasmania, Australia, and removed after storm events, to assess infiltration of fine (less than 1 mm) material into the bed. All stream catchments were geomorphically similar, over similar altitude ranges and had moderately erodible sandy-clay soils on 25 - 35 [o] slopes. Study catchments were selected to control for aspect, logging treatment and coupe age. Fine sediment infiltration into the stream bed was assessed for 15 tributary ephemeral streams in logged areas and 11 streams in unlogged areas. The logged catchments had been clearfelled in three time periods- 1990 - 1991, 1988 - 1989 and 1986 - 1987 -all by skyline <b>cable</b> logging. <b>Trap</b> yield was also assessed in riffles of the perennial valley floor streams upstream and downstream of the junction of six logged and six unlogged tributaries and upstream and downstream of four old but actively used road crossings. Trap yield was significantly higher in logged than unlogged ephemeral streams for size fractions ranging from less than 125 to 500 um, by factors ranging from two to three, but not for sediment between 0. 5 and 1. 0 mm. Trap yield of organic sediment of less than 125 um declined with time after logging and burning, whereas inorganic sediment yield showed no clear trend with couple age. Trap yield of streams logged in 1986 - 1987 was not significantly higher than for control streams, whereas inorganic sediment and 0. 5 - 1. 0 mm organic sediment yields were highest for recently burnt coupes. A significantly greater number of increases in trap yield occurred between riffle pairs of valley floor streams adjacent to junctions of logged tributaries, when compared with control riffle pairs. Logged tributary junctions were associated {{with an increase in}} the organic content of sediment. Road crossings were associated with large increases in infiltration in adjacent riffle pairs, 30 - 50 years after construction. Current forest practices do not protect ephemeral headwater streams from enhanced sediment inputs, the long-term significance of which is unknown. Recovery of sediment fluxes in these streams to background levels appears to take 5 years or longer...|$|R
