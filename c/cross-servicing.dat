However, the agency's failure to make the act a priority has left key provisions of the legislation unimplemented and severely reduced collection opportunities.

First, RHS's loan-servicing system had not incorporated key features necessary to implement the act's referral provisions. Second, RHS did not refer any debts for <b>cross-servicing</b> while pursuing an exemption from Treasury. Third, amounts reported as delinquent and eligible for consideration for referral were materially understated. RHS had not kept the documentation needed to independently verify the accuracy and validity of the exclusion amounts in its certified fiscal year 2000 year-end report.

These reviews did not include FMS's handling of nontax debts that were returned to FMS uncollected by its private collection agency (PCA) contractors because FMS officials did not consider the <b>cross-servicing</b> program to be fully mature. During fiscal years 2000, 2001, and 2002, FMS's PCA contractors returned about $ 3. 9 billion of uncollected debts to FMS. This report focuses primarily on (1) actions taken by FMS on uncollected nontax debts returned from its PCA contractors and (2) actions taken, if any, by FMS and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to ensure that federal agencies are reporting their eligible uncollectible nontax debts to IRS as income to debtors. ...|$|E

Further, FMS is considering a number of initiatives intended to improve centralized collection of delinquent federal nontax debt.

GAO identified several obstacles to FSA's establishment and implementation of an effective and complete debt-referral process. In the four states with the highest dollar amounts of federal debt excluded from the Treasury Offset Program, GAO reviewed FSA's use of exclusions from referral requirements because of bankruptcy, forbearance/appeals, foreclosure and Department of Justice litigation. GAO found that about half of the exclusions in these states were inconsistent with established criteria. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{opportunity}} of vitalizing recourses {{is becoming increasingly}} attractive, and traditional machine virtualization {{is no longer the}} only thing in mind. Today, virtualization also concerns resources such as firewalls, routers and switches. For this to be possible and successful, a flexible and evolutionary scheduler is necessary. The focus of this thesis project has been to explore and develop a generic <b>cross-service</b> scheduler between the computing service Nova and networking service Neutron. We have designed a generic foundation for a scheduler and the aim in the future is to use this solution for other services in OpenStack such as volume, storage and image. Our starting point was the filter scheduler in Nova, which originally is designed for scheduling virtual machines (VMs) rather than scheduling network resources. A unique <b>cross-service</b> scheduler between Nova and Neutron is implemented and discussed in this paper. This thesis presents the design, implementation and functional verification of the Neutron scheduler and <b>cross-service</b> communication. The <b>cross-service</b> scheduling is designed so that Nova and Neutron are loosely coupled. By loosely coupled we mean that Nova and Neutron are as independent of each other as possible. The report concludes with a discussion about the project process and implementation process, and the how the solution can be developed further e. g. by implementing CLI commands for increasing the functionality of filter chains...|$|R

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "To improve federal debt collection, the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 established a framework of debt collection tools, including administrative wage garnishment (AWG). This report discusses {{the extent to which}} nine agencies use or plan to use AWG to collect delinquent nontax federal debt and provides GAO's perspective on ways to make AWG more widespread and effective. GAO found that none of the nine agencies had yet implemented AWG. Although AWG is not mandatory, by failing to use this tool [...] more than five years after the act's enactment and more than three years after the Department of the Treasury issued implementing regulations [...] agencies have missed an opportunity to maximize collection of delinquent debt. Agencies identified various reasons for not yet implementing AWG or for deciding not to do so, including the need to focus their resources on implementing the act's mandatory provisions. Although some agencies or programs may have valid reasons for not implementing wage garnishment, all of the larger programs that deal with individuals and that have a demonstrated risk of financial loss resulting from unpaid debt should have AWG as a viable debt collection option. Reliance on the Financial Management Service (FMS) to perform AWG as part of <b>cross-servicing</b> might be prudent for some agencies, provided the collection tool is used as early as practicable to maximize its collection potential. However, the act does not require that agencies refer debts for <b>cross-servicing</b> until they are more than 180 days delinquent, and FMS, which views wage garnishment as a tool of last resort, does not contemplate initiating AWG in most cases until the debt has been with FMS for at least 90 days. As a result, FMS's use of AWG could be significantly limited and delayed. ...|$|E

The testimony focused on RHS's and FSA's progress in referring delinquent debt for administrative offset and <b>cross-servicing</b> and Agriculture's implementation of administrative wage garnishment (AWG).

40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "It is essential that the government not only make and guarantee creditworthy loans but also collect the amounts owed. The Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 was intended to maximize collection {{of billions of dollars}} of non-tax delinquent debt owed to the government by requiring agencies to notify the Department of Treasury of debts delinquent more than 180 days for purposes of administrative offset. The act also requires agencies to refer such debts to Treasury for centralized collection action known as <b>cross-servicing.</b> The act authorizes agencies to garnish the wages of delinquent debtors and bars delinquent debtors from receiving federal financial assistance in the form of loans, loan insurance, or loan guarantees until they resolve their delinquencies. This report discusses selected agencies and focuses on (1) difficulties they experienced in identifying and referring eligible debts to Treasury's Financial Management Service or a Treasury designated debt collection center, (2) obstacles to prompt referral of eligible debts, and (3) whether exclusions from referral requirements were consistent with established criteria. ...|$|E

Inadequate procedures and controls hampered prompt identification and referral of both eligible non-Medicare Secondary Payer (MSP) and MSP debts. The delayed referral of non-MSP debts resulted from problems with the CMS debt-referral system and insufficient CMS monitoring of contractor referrals. The low level of MSP debt referrals resulted primarily from limited contractor efforts and insufficient CMS monitoring of contractor performance. Although GAO did not test whether selected CMS debts had been reasonably excluded from referral and reached no overall conclusion about the appropriateness of CMS exclusions, GAO found that CMS did not report reliable Medicare debt information to the Treasury Department as of September 30, 2000. ...|$|E
