30|$|The {{functionalization}} of hydroxyl {{groups is}} an effective method to facilitate the radical copolymerization of lignin. Notably, to introduce polymerizable groups on the hydroxyl groups, lignin was reacted with <b>chloromethylstyrene</b> or methacryloyl chloride. When up to five moieties were introduced per lignin fragment, a network copolymer was formed owing to the incorporation of the lignin units in the growing chains {{by means of the}} polymerizable groups. When the number of polymerizable groups per lignin moiety was {{as close as possible to}} one, a linear copolymer was obtained [184]. Other studies showed that lignosulfonate could be used for radical polymerization [185 – 187].|$|E

The chain length of the DO-PTV can be tuned by varying the amount of end-capping agent employed. This polymer was characterized by H- 1 NMR, UV-vis absorbance spectroscopy, and GPC. Finally, the DO-PTV was transformed into macroinitiator for nitroxide mediated radical polymerization.

One {{of these is the}} same radical mechanism that would operate within the homopolymers of the constituent comonomers. The other mechanism is characteristic of the systems being copolymers and arises from intramolecular excited-state charge-transfer interactions between adjacent chlorine-containing and non-chlorine-containing units of the polymer chains. Pulse radiolysis studies demonstrate the formation of a transient intermediate in poly(p-methylstyrene-stat-p-chlorostyrene), the spectrum of which is consistent with that of a methylstyryl radical-cation. The radiation chemical yields for crosslinking derived from the lithographic sensitivities of a range of such systems, are modelled in terms of these mechanisms and the variation with copolymer composition is shown to be in excellent accord with experimental observation...|$|E

The obtained monolith was grafted by two kinds of poly(ethylene glycol) acrylate oligomer, poly(ethylene glycol) acrylate (PEGA) and poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether acrylate (mPEGA). The monolith was grafted via activators generated by electron transfer atom transfer radical polymerization (AGET ATRP) with the increased number of functional groups (-OH). About 0. 61 - 0. 81 mmol/g hydroxyl group resulted from side groups in each grafting polymer chain.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of ChemistryEric A. MaattaPolyoxometalates have {{attracted}} much attention {{over the last few}} decades and have been studied {{in a wide variety of}} fields such as catalysis, medicine, imaging, photochromism, and magnetic materials. While many of these systems are easy to prepare, the ability to functionalize polyoxometalates is an ongoing challenge. Two approaches used to functionalize polyoxometalates involve insertion of metal fragments into a lacunary polyoxometalate or the direct replacement of terminal oxo ligands with the isoelectronic organoimido ligand. This process has been proven successful in many cases and with a wide variety of organoimido compounds. One of our group’s goals has been to synthesize a functionalized hexamolybdate species that is capable of metal coordination. However, previous results have been hindered because the electron withdrawing effect of the cluster is transmitted to the metal binding sites. In order to combat the electron withdrawing effect of the cluster, 4 -amino piperidine dithiocarbamate ligands, which have no conjugation in the ring and are capable of metal binding, have been synthesized and characterized. A series of transition metal complexes have been made and a single crystal has been grown of a nickel(II) complex. Attempts to attach these species to clusters are described. Imido hexamolybdate clusters have been functionalized with styryl and iodophenyl groups. The styrene functionalized hexamolybdate was copolymerized with 4 - <b>chloromethylstyrene</b> in moderate yields. This copolymer has the capabilities for further substitution at the chloromethyl group. The iodophenyl functionalized hexamolybdate was fully characterized including a single-crystal X-ray structural determination. This functionalized hexamolybdate can be used in carbon-carbon bond formation through coupling reactions. A chromium(V) nitrido polyoxometalate has been synthesized from a lacunary Keggin precursor and characterized. This nitrido species shows promise as a nitrogen transfer agent. Likewise, this nitrido species could be an entry point to other derivatives through reactions with various nucleophiles and electrophiles...|$|E
40|$|The {{kinetics}} for SN 2 nucleophilic substitution {{reaction of}} sodium benzoate with benzyl bromide catalyzed by immobilized phase-transfer catalyst was investigated. The support of solid phase-transfer catalyst was prepared from the copolymerization of polystyrene and <b>chloromethylstyrene.</b> Different functional groups {{were used as}} the active centers, such as trialkylamines, trioctylphosphine or triphenylphosphine, and that was immobilized {{onto the surface of}} the macroporous or microporous catalysts. In solid-liquid-liquid system, the product yield was obtained above 86 % within 3 hr of reaction using small amount of solid catalyst with the properties of 1. 38 % divinylbenzene crosslinked, particle size of 40 - 80 mesh,tributylamine activated, and macropore-mouth type, and the overall reaction rate decreased with increasing the mean particle size. This demonstrates that the esterification of sodium benzoate is controlled by the combination of intraparticle diffusion and intrinsic reaction under triphase conditions. Moreover, the characteristics and structure of the catalyst support also affect the catalytic efficiency. With the same degree of crosslinking, macroporous catalyst with tributylamine activated has higher activities than microporous catalyst does. The effects of operating parameters, including agitation speed, reaction temperature, amounts of catalyst, types of solvents, molar ratio of reactants, type of phase-transfer catalysts, volume ratio of aqueous, and so on, were all performed to find the optimal reaction conditions. With increasing of agitation speed, reaction temperature and amounts of catalyst, the reaction rate increased. The catalytic efficiency of functional group used as trioctylphosphine was best than trialkylamines. The ion-exchange reaction is one of the fundamental process of solid-liquid-liquid triphase reactions. We also proceed the ion-exchange reaction by triphase catalysts for sodium benzoate solution to know the formation and variation of the active intermediate (PhCOOQ) during the reaction. After induction period in 3 minutes, the active intermediate of the solid catalyst with 1. 38 % divinylbenzene crosslinked and macroporous type was also observed to keep at a near constant concentration. With increasing of cross-linking level, the formation of the active intermediate decreased. A kinetic model was developed to describe this esterification conducted in the solid-liquid-liquid triphase system, and the experimental data were well described by the pseudo-first-order kinetics. Eventually, the methods of reuse and regeneration of the catalyst was also explored to reach the purpose of lowering processing cost and saving resources. 本研究探討的是於固定化相間轉移觸媒催化下進行苯甲酸鈉與溴化苯甲基之SN 2 親核取代反應，所使用之固體觸媒擔體是將苯乙烯及氯甲基苯乙烯進行共聚合反應而得，且使用不同官能基前驅物，如三級胺、三正辛基膦或三苯基膦，將其固定於巨孔口型或微孔口型觸媒的表面上，形成活性中心。在固-液-液相催化反應系統中，只需使用少量粒徑大小為 40 - 80 mesh與 1. 38 %交聯度之三正丁基季銨基巨孔口型固體觸媒，在反應三小時後產率即可達到 86 %以上，且總反應速率隨平均粒徑的增加而降低，顯示出在三相反應系統下，苯甲酸鈉之酯化反應同時受到顆粒內部擴散與本質反應之影響。然而觸媒之特性與結構也會影響觸媒反應活性，相同交聯度且官能基團為三正丁基季銨基時，巨孔口型觸媒活性較微孔口型觸媒催化活性為佳，以及探討操作變數的影響，包括攪拌效應、觸媒添加量效應、水量添加效應、有機溶劑種類效應、觸媒種類效應、溫度效應等，進而得到較適當的反應條件；隨著攪拌速率和溫度提高，觸媒添加量增加，反應速率隨之增快，當觸媒官能機使用為三級膦之反應效率較三級胺為佳。 離子交換反應也是重要的反應過程之一，故使用三相觸媒對苯甲酸鈉進行離子交換反應，可知在反應過程中觸媒中間體(QPhCOO) 形成及變化情形；於 3 分鐘後其活性中間體就已經幾乎達定值，且隨著交聯度增加，形成觸媒活性中間體量隨之降低。提出此取代酯化反應之動力學模式，且由實驗結果知可由虛擬一階反應動力式可完整描述。 最後探討觸媒之再生還原方法，以達到降低成本及節省資源，進而改善傳統製成的目的。中文摘要 [...] Ⅰ 英文摘要 [...] Ⅱ 誌 謝 [...] Ⅳ 目 錄 [...] Ⅴ 圖 目 錄 [...] Ⅷ 表 目 錄 [...] ⅩⅢ 符號說明 [...] ⅩⅤ 第一章 緒論 1. 1. 前言 [...] 1 1. 2. 相間轉移催化反應簡介 [...] 2 1. 3. 液-液相催化反應 [...] - 10 1. 4. 固-液-液相催化反應 [...] 15 1. 5. 本實驗之研究目的與方法 [...] 18 第二章 實驗部份 2. 1. 實驗藥品 [...] 20 2. 2. 實驗裝置與儀器 [...] 21 2. 3. 產物之合成 [...] 22 2. 4. 校正曲線 [...] 23 2. 5. 高分子擔體之製備 [...] 23 2. 6. 官能基之固定化 [...] 27 2. 7. 固定化觸媒之氯離子定量方法之步驟 [...] 27 2. 8. 固定化觸媒之離子交換反應步驟 [...] 28 2. 9. 反應動力實驗步驟 [...] 30 第三章 固定化相間轉移觸媒之特性分析 3. 1. 固定化觸媒之氯離子含量結果分析 [...] 36 3. 2. 觸媒擔體不同聚合條件分析 [...] 41 3. 3. 觸媒擔體顆粒粒徑分析 [...] 41 3. 4. 觸媒BET表面積、孔洞體積和孔徑分析 [...] - 42 3. 5. 穿透式電子顯微鏡(TEM) 分析 [...] - 48 3. 6. 掃描式電子顯微鏡(SEM) 分析 [...] - 50 3. 7. 結論 [...] 56 第四章 固定化觸媒催化苯甲酸之酯化反應動力學 4. 1. 前言 [...] 58 4. 2. 反應動力模式推導 [...] 59 4. 3. 攪拌速率之效應 [...] 63 4. 4. 不同交聯度對觸媒活性中間體變化之影響 [...] 66 4. 5. 觸媒使用量的影響 [...] 76 4. 6. 觸媒顆粒大小對視反應速率之影響 [...] 76 4. 7. 不同官能基觸媒之催化反應效率 [...] 87 4. 8. 不同溶劑之影響 [...] 105 4. 9. 其他操作變數對視反應速率之影響 [...] 112 4. 10. 結論 [...] - 119 第五章 固定化觸媒之回收與再生 5. 1. 前言 [...] 124 5. 2. 固定化觸媒活性中間體之催化活性 [...] 124 5. 3. 固定化觸媒之回收與其催化活性 [...] 131 5. 4. 固定化觸媒之離子交換再生反應 [...] 136 5. 5. 再生觸媒之催化活性 [...] 139 5. 6. 結論 [...] 142 第六章 總結 [...] 144 參考文獻 [...] 149 附錄A. 苯甲酸苯甲酯之 1 HNMR圖譜 [...] - 15...|$|E
