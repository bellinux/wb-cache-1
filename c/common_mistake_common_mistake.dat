40|$|Abstractâ€”OpenMP is an API for {{parallel}} programming model of shared memory multiprocessors. Novice OpenMP programmers often produce the code that compiler cannot find human errors. It was investigated how compiler coped with the <b>common</b> <b>mistakes</b> {{that can occur}} in OpenMP code. The latest version(4. 4. 3) of GCC is used for this research. It was found that GCC compiled the codes without any errors or warnings. In this paper the programming aid tool is presented for OpenMP programs. It can check 12 <b>common</b> <b>mistakes</b> that novice programmer can commit during the programming of OpenMP.

40|$|Abstract Objective: {{this study}} {{analyzed}} {{the influence of}} scenario-based skills training on students' learning skills. Method: the author evaluated the nursing skills laboratory exam papers of 605 sophomores in nursing programs for seven years. The study determined the <b>common</b> <b>mistakes</b> of students and the laboratory work was designed in a scenario-based format. The effectiveness of this method was evaluated by assessing the number of errors the students committed and their achievement scores in laboratory examinations. This study presents the students' <b>common</b> <b>mistakes</b> in intramuscular and subcutaneous injection and their development of intravenous access skills, included in the nursing skills laboratory examination. Results: {{an analysis of the}} students' most <b>common</b> <b>mistakes</b> revealed that the most <b>common</b> was not following the principles of asepsis for all three skills (intramuscular, subcutaneous injection, intravenous access) {{in the first year of}} the scenario-based training. The students' exam achievement scores increased gradually, except in the fall semester of the academic year 2009 - 2010. The study found that the scenario-based skills training reduced students' <b>common</b> <b>mistakes</b> in examinations and enhanced their performance on exams. Conclusion: this method received a positive response from both students and instructors. The scenario-based training is available for use in addition to other skills training methods...|$|R
