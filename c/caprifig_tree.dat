40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{determine}} the total phenolic and flavonoid contents, antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of methanolic leaf extracts of ten Algerian fig (Ficus carica L.) varieties (uniferous, biferous and <b>caprifig</b> <b>tree).</b> MethodsPhenolics were extracted by Soxhlet method and analyzed by the Folin–Ciocalteu colorimetric method. Flavonoids {{were determined by}} aluminum trichloride assay and the antioxidant capacity {{was determined by the}} 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging assay. The antimicrobial activity was studied with the disc diffusion method and a macrodilution broth method was used to {{determine the}} minimal inhibitory concentrations and minimal lethal concentrations. ResultsThe mean extract yield was 14. 10 % ±  0. 66 % (n =  10). Leaf extract of biferous followed by uniferous varieties had the highest total phenolic contents [(52. 296  ±  5. 232) and (48. 973  ±  2. 015) mg gallic acid equivalent/g of dry plant extract respectively], flavonoids [(14. 388  ±  0. 333) and (14. 136  ±  1. 082) mg quercetin equivalent/g of dry plant extract] and antioxidant capacity [IC 50 (798. 754  ±  108. 590) and (825. 004  ±  110. 835) μg/mL]. Antioxidant capacity of fig leaves was significantly correlated with phenolic contents (r =  0. 748). These extracts showed bactericidal activity and moderate antifungal activity, and the minimal inhibitory concentrations and minimal lethal concentrations were determined on Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus. ConclusionsAll tested extracts contain phenolic compounds and exhibited an antioxidant activity and an antimicrobial effect against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Further researches on identification and purification of phenolic compounds are required...|$|E
50|$|There {{is also a}} {{difference}} in winter and spring caprifigs (male figs) and the time course for becoming available for receiving eggs and being pollinated. Spring caprifigs usually produce more wasps than winter caprifigs do because of the better and more available resources of the spring caprifigs compared to the winter caprifigs. This also implies that the fig wasp population is much more active and larger in the spring. The spring and winter caprifigs have a cycle {{related to each other}} as to maximize resources and output of figs and wasps. Winter, or delayed, caprifigs usually occur on male trees. Spring, or undelayed, caprifigs usually occur on female trees. Because female trees are lethal, wasps prefer these delayed <b>caprifigs</b> of male <b>trees.</b>|$|R
40|$|Background] The {{common fig}} (Ficus carica L.) is a gynodioecious species with two sexual forms: male <b>trees</b> (<b>caprifigs)</b> with {{male and female}} flowers and female trees that produce only female flowers {{that will result in}} the edible fig syconium. In this study the genetic {{diversity}} of 20 Tunisian accessions of caprifig is analyzed using SSR markers previously developed for this crop. [Results] The results revealed that the 13 pairs of primers used amplified a total of 37 alleles in the accessions studied. The number of alleles per locus ranged from two to six, with a mean value of 2. 85 alleles per locus. Observed and expected heterozygosities showed mean values of 0. 33 and 0. 29 respectively. UPGMA cluster analysis and Principal Component Analysis grouped the caprifig accessions analyzed in three groups. [Conclusion] The results obtained show a low genetic diversity in the Tunisian accessions of caprifig studied and, in spite of analyzing samples from different geographic regions, no clear groupings based on geographical origin are observed suggesting widespread exchange of caprifig plant material through vegetative propagation among different areas in Tunisia.
