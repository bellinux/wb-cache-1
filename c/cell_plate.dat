25|$|The {{middle lamella}} is laid down first, formed from the <b>cell</b> <b>plate</b> during cytokinesis, {{and the primary}} cell wall is then {{deposited}} inside the middle lamella. The actual structure of the cell wall is not clearly defined and several models exist - the covalently linked cross model, the tether model, the diffuse layer model and the stratified layer model. However, the primary cell wall, {{can be defined as}} composed of cellulose microfibrils aligned at all angles. Cellulose microfibrils are produced at the plasma membrane by the cellulose synthase complex, which is proposed to be made of a hexameric rosette that contains three cellulose synthase catalytic subunits for each of the six units. Microfibrils are held together by hydrogen bonds to provide a high tensile strength. The cells are held together and share the gelatinous membrane called the middle lamella, which contains magnesium and calcium pectates (salts of pectic acid). Cells interact though plasmodesmata, which are inter-connecting channels of cytoplasm that connect to the protoplasts of adjacent cells across the cell wall.|$|E

The constructs contained segments of the human collagenase promoter regulating transcription of chloramphenicol acyl transferase. Expression of constructs containing the - 1200 /- 42 -bp segment or the - 139 /- 42 -bp segment of the collagenase promoter inserted upstream from the reporter gene was induced to similar extents in <b>cells</b> <b>plated</b> on the 120 -kD fragment of fibronectin or on anti-fibronectin receptor antibody, relative to that in fibroblasts plated on fibronectin. The expression of the construct containing the - 66 /- 42 -bp segment of the promoter was not regulated and was {{similar to that of the}} parent pBLCAT 2 plasmid, suggesting that the - 139 /- 67 region of the collagenase promoter, which contains PEA 3 - and AP 1 -binding sites, regulates the transcription of collagenase caused by integrin-derived signals.

In this study, we have compared the synthesis of thrombospondin by quiescent endothelial cells displaying (a) the same morphological phenotype (cobblestone) on different substrata (gelatin and collagen) and (b) different morphological phenotypes (cobblestone and sprouting) on the same substratum (collagen). We demonstrate that thrombospondin is a major biosynthetic product of confluent, quiescent cells cultured on dishes coated with either gelatin or collagen, and that the synthesis of this protein is markedly decreased when <b>cells</b> are <b>plated</b> on or in three-dimensional collagen gels. Moreover, we demonstrate that <b>cells</b> <b>plated</b> in gel (sprouting) secrete less thrombospondin than do <b>cells</b> <b>plated</b> on the gel surface (cobblestone). The regulation of thrombospondin synthesis is reversible and occurs at the level of transcription, as steady-state mRNA levels for thrombospondin decrease in a manner comparable with the levels of protein secreted by these cells. We also show that mRNA levels for laminin B 2 chains are increased when cells are cultured on and in collagen gels compared with on gelatin-coated dishes, suggesting that the syntheses of thrombospondin and laminin are regulated by different mechanisms. When cells are cultured on gelatin- or collagen-coated dishes, thrombospondin gene expression is directly proportional to the proliferative state of the cultures. By contrast, the synthesis of thrombospondin by cells cultured on collagen gels remains at equally low levels whether they are labelled when they are sparse and rapidly proliferating or when they are confluent and quiescent. Fibronectin synthesis was found to increase with increasing confluency of the <b>cells</b> <b>plated</b> on all three substrata.

Addition of 20 μm cytochalasin D or 1 μM latrunculin A, agents that prevent actin polymerization, to cells on laminin restored ACh-induced stimulation of ICa,L. We conclude that laminin binding to β 1 integrins acts in association with the actin-based cytoskeleton to attenuate adenylate cyclase activity.

Trypsinization of the cells and replating for 24 h in the same volume of medium (total amounts of cells) but at lower surface density to reduce intercellular contact, did not modify the killing potentiation observed after delayed plating. Four to 6 changes of medium, carried out at 1 h intervals, starting immediately after treatment, led to an elimination of the killing potentiation otherwise found in cells kept after treatment in F-med and resulted in survival levels {{similar to those of}} <b>cells</b> <b>plated</b> immediately after treatment. On the other hand, survival levels higher by a factor 1. 5 to 10 than those obtained for <b>cells</b> <b>plated</b> immediately after treatment were observed for cells kept in C-med when four medium changes were carried out during the first 5 h of the 6 or 24 h post-treatment period. Incubation with 150 microM beta-arabinofuranosyladenine (araA) for 6 h (C-med) after exposure to adriamycin (4 changes of medium at 1 h intervals) prevented the increase in survival observed after incubation in C-med but also caused an additional potentiation in killing resulting in survival levels lower than those of <b>cells</b> <b>plated</b> immediately after treatment. These results are interpreted as indicating the induction by adriamycin of potentially lethal damage (PLD), sensitive to araA, similar to that observed after exposure to low LET ionizing radiation. Repair and/or fixation of this form of PLD can only be shown if precautions are taken to circumvent toxicity induced by adriamycin released from the cells during the post-treatment time interval, for example, by frequent changes in medium...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Cells {{in culture}} reveal {{high levels of}} protein {{tyrosine}} phosphorylation in their focal adhesions, the regions where cells adhere to the underlying substratum. We have examined the tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins in response to <b>plating</b> <b>cells</b> on extracellular matrix substrata. Rat embryo fibroblasts, mouse Balb/c 3 T 3, and NIH 3 T 3 <b>cells</b> <b>plated</b> on fibronectin-coated surfaces revealed elevated phosphotyrosine levels in a cluster of proteins between 115 and 130 kD. This increase in tyrosine phosphorylation was also seen when rat embryo fibroblasts were plated on laminin or vitronectin, but not on polylysine or on uncoated plastic. Integrin mediation of this effect was suggested by finding {{the same pattern of}} elevated tyrosine phosphorylation in <b>cells</b> <b>plated</b> on the cell-binding fragment of fibronectin and in ceils plated on a synthetic polymer containing multiple RGD sequences. We have identified one of the proteins of the 115 - 130 -kD cluster as pp 125 ~, a tyrosine kinase recently localized i...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between colony numbers and concentration of <b>cells</b> <b>plated</b> {{is an important}} parameter of clonogenic assay systems. The cloning efficiency for an ideal sample should be independent of cell concentration, thus giving a straight line through the origin when colony numbers are plotted against cell concentration. A simple statistical method has been developed to test {{if this is the}} case for individual tumour samples. Colony data from 51 freshly obtained tumour samples, which had sufficient <b>cells</b> to <b>plate</b> 3 or more dilutions and gave at least 20 colonies per plate at one or more of the dilutions, were tested. The results indicated that colony formation was linear for 27 (53 %) of the samples. The remaining 24 samples could be classified into 2 groups: type I, in which cloning efficiencies increased with increasing cell concentration and type II, which had reduced cloning efficiencies at high cell concentrations. Fifteen (29 %) of the samples had type I non-linearity and 9 (18 %) exhibited non-linearity of type II. These findings indicate that the {{relationship between}} colonies and <b>cells</b> <b>plated</b> should be examined for each biopsy sample particularly in each experiment where the effects of cytotoxic drugs are tested...|$|R
