40|$|Abstract. We present PacLang: an imperative, concurrent, linearlytyped {{language}} {{designed for}} expressing packet processing applications. PacLang’s linear type system ensures that no packet is referenced {{by more than}} one thread, but allows multiple references to a packet within a thread. We argue (i) that this property greatly simplifies compilation of high-level programs to the distributed memory architectures of modern Network Processors; and (ii) that PacLang’s type system captures that style in which imperative packet processing programs are already written. <b>Claim</b> (<b>ii)</b> is justified by means of a case-study: we describe a PacLang implementation of the IPv 4 unicast packet forwarding algorithm.

40|$|The {{influence}} of Brentano on {{the emergence of}} Husserl's notion of intentionality has been usually perceived as the key of understanding the history of intentionality, since Brentano was credited {{with the discovery of}} intentionality, and Husserl was his discipline. This much debated question is to be revisited in the present essay by incorporating recent advances in Brentano scholarship and by focusing on Husserl's very first work, his habilitation essay (Über den Begriff der Zahl), which followed immediately after his study years at Brentano, and also on manuscript notes from the same period. It is to be shown that (i) although Brentano failed to enact a direct influence on Husserl's notion of intentionality (much in line with K. Schuhmann's <b>claim),</b> (<b>ii)</b> yet the core of Brentano's notion remained operative in Husserl's theory of relations, which is seemingly influenced by John Stuart Mill and Hermann Lotze. This investigation is intended as a contribution towards the proper understanding of the complexities of Husserl's early philosophy...|$|E
40|$|Informational {{asymmetry}} between {{managers and}} {{investors in the}} optimal capital structure decision In this article, we consider the impact of asymmetric information be-tween managers and investors on the optimal capital structure decision. This is done within a continuous-time framework, where the relevant state variable is given by the EBIT value of the ¯rm; an approach taken by Goldstein et al. (2001), Hackbarth et al. (2003), Dangl & Zechner (2004) amongst others. Our setup di®ers in that we assume the EBIT to follow an Arithmetic Brownian motion, i. e. it can assume negative values. More importantly, we extend this framework in two directions: (i) We introduce a separate management <b>claim.</b> (<b>ii)</b> We introduce asymmetric information between managers and investors by assuming that claimants receive noisy signals, which they process according to rational expectation principles. Our results show, that managers always try to avoid debt, and that their optimal bankruptcy threshold is always lower, than the threshold set by equity holders. The introduction of asymmetric information changes the optimality conditions, and consequently the capital structure decision. It is shown, that the informational asymmetry can substantially lower the op-timal leverage ratio, even without assuming that managers are entrenched.

30|$|This study tests two {{competing}} {{arguments in the}} theories of self-enforcing agreement using agent-based modelling. These arguments were original proposed verbally or as a game theoretical model, and have never been tested in a same framework. Our model explicitly considers {{the size of the}} cooperative team in question and the heterogeneity of the members in the team, including their leisure preference (i.e., laziness), time preference (i.e., patience to future well-being) and the marginal product of effort (i.e., work ability). This allows us to better understand the divergence of these two arguments. Statistical analysis over the simulated data shows: (1) the sustained discount rate is lower in exit-free cooperative teams than exit-restricted ones when shirking members exist. This confirms the hypothesis based on the argument of Lin (1993). (2) The sustained discount rate is lower in exit-restricted teams than exit-free ones when members’ leisure preferences are not too diverse, and the economics of scale are not too large. A threshold of standard deviation of the leisure preference and the fixed cost are found in our results. This is consistent with Claim (i) of the hypothesis developed based on the argument of Dong and Dow (1993). (3) The sustained discount rate is lower in exit-restricted teams than exit-free ones when the sizes of the teams are large enough. This result verifies <b>Claim</b> (<b>ii)</b> developed based on the argument of the hypothesis of Dong and Dow (1993).|$|E
