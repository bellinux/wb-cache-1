25|$|The first Italian {{version of}} the {{programme}} was called Love Bugs, which is the international marketing name of Un gars, une fille. It ran on Italia 1 from 2004 to 2005 with the couple played by comedian Fabio De Luigi (already well known for his collaboration with Gialappa's Band) and Michelle Hunziker, a veteran of Zelig Circus. A second season, Love Bugs 2 aired from 2005 to 2006 with Elisabetta <b>Canalis</b> replacing Hunziker. The characters' names in both series {{are those of the}} actors, in the fashion of the original show. In the third season in 2007, Love Bugs 3, the couple was played by Emilio Solfrizzi and Giorgia Surina (MTV's Veejay). Because of low ratings, Love Bugs 3 was cancelled. Nevertheless, approximately 50 episodes of the third season were filmed and broadcast, much the same as the previous two seasons.|$|E
500|$|The imbrices {{completed}} the waterproofing {{of the roof}} by arching over the joints between the vertical edges of the tegulae, dividing the roof into channels. Rain water flowed off the curved imbrices into the channels and down over the surfaces of the tegulae, and descended into the gutter (<b>canalis).</b> [...] In formal architecture the <b>canalis</b> had a plain or ornamented frontal piece set atop the entablature, immediately above the cornice. The semicircular opening {{at the front of}} the lowermost imbrex was often capped with an ornamental fronton, and the spouts which drained the gutters were frequently decorated with lions' heads (capita leonina) or other fantastic or grotesque faces.|$|E

40|$|More than 200 {{channels}} and valleys {{have been identified}} on the Magellan images of Venus. These are classified, {{on the basis of}} morphology. as simple channels (including sinuous rilles, simple channels with flow margins. and <b>canali),</b> complex channels (with or without flow margins), compound channels, and valley networks (including rectangular, labyrinthic, and pitted or irregular networks). Sinuous rilles closely resemble their lunar counterparts. <b>Canali</b> are exceptional for their remarkably constant width along very extenuated flow paths, exceeding 500 km. One of the compound channels, the outflow complex of Kallistos Vallis. extends over 1200 km and is up to 30 km wide. Venusian channels are globally distributed, but each class has a preferential topographic association. The <b>canali</b> are developed on the volcanic plains. while sinuous rilles occur at higher elevations, associated with volcanic complexes and coronae. Both <b>canali</b> and sinuous rilles have been deformed by post-emplacement tectonism. Highly fluid lavas, erupted at sustained, high discharges seem best to explain many of the channel features, particularly for the <b>canali</b> and the compound channels. Explanation of the <b>canali</b> morphologies may also involve unusual low-viscosity lavas, perhaps of exotic composition...|$|R
