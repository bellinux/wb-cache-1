The Soviet Union’s Dmitrov doctrine had called for a common front against fascism which helped swell the number of Indonesians taking a cooperative approach with regards to the Dutch colonial administration in an attempt to secure Indonesian independence. Gerindo was one of the more significant cooperative parties in the years leading to World War II whose objectives included a fully Indonesian legislature; It had modest goals in comparison to the Dutch-suppressed radical nationalists led by the likes of Sukarno and Hatta, who Sjarifuddin had met before the War. By 1940, Dutch intelligence suspected him of being involved with the Communist underground.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The lack of {{interoperability}} between ICT {{systems is}} becoming more and more a bottleneck in the collaboration and co-operation of enterprises. <b>Co-operating</b> <b>parties</b> have to exchange business information and have to have the same understanding of the meaning of the exchanged information and to trust both the communication itself and the validity of its contents. The paper re-views two ISO standards, which are aiming on the interoperability issue com-paring the different aspects of these standards and introduces a new work item in standardisation, which expects support from two current European initiatives on interoperability and others. The paper is intended to guide further standard developments by identifying current solutions and their relation with one an-other. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{a dispute}} between <b>co-operating</b> <b>parties</b> who cannot cannot {{come to an}} agreement, an {{important}} question is: who will be approached {{to give a decision}} in this dispute: the civil court, arbitrators or a 'bindend adviseur' (i. e. a unpartial third person who gives an absolute ruling). In the Netherlands in principle the civil court is charged with civil jurisdiction, but it is authorized in certain situations to charge private persons with it. The consent to charge jurisdiction to private persons must have been laid down explicitly in the contract. Both ways of jurisdiction have advantages and disadvantages. The choice one makes, depends on personal matters. Arbitration is a simple, informal and (not always) cheap procedure, in which parties are more involved than int he civil court procedure...|$|R

50|$|Municipal {{elections}} {{were held in}} France on 14 and 21 March 1965. As in 1959, the UDR realized deceiving results (although they did moderately gain). The Communists gained, but they also came out of their isolation and started <b>co-operating</b> with other <b>parties</b> of the parliamentary left.|$|R
50|$|The Council then demanded full {{observation}} of the ceasefire, with all <b>parties</b> <b>co-operating</b> with UNTAC to identify minefields and facilitate investigations into reports of foreign forces, assistance and ceasefire violations within territory under their control. Throughout this, the resolution urged the protection of all United Nations personnel.|$|R
50|$|The {{resolution}} then expressed {{condolences to}} the families of those killed from UNPROFOR, demanding the parties in the region respect the safety of the Force.

5000|$|The {{party was}} founded on 6 May 1917 in Tallinn in order to contest the Estonian Provincial Assembly {{elections}} that year. Its initial leaders were Jüri Vilms and Eduard Laaman.

[...] "Rattlesnake" [...] <b>co-operating.</b> A <b>party</b> of 50 rifles rushed the post, killing or capturing the occupants.

50|$|The Council {{confirmed}} that the above measures {{do not apply to}} UNPROFOR, the International Conference on the former Yugoslavia and European Community Monitoring Mission. It also announced its attention that the measures would be reconsidered once the Bosnian Serb <b>party</b> <b>co-operates</b> in good faith with the United Nations peace plan.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>party</b> <b>co-operated</b> {{closely with}} the Estonian Radical Socialist Party and the two {{became known as the}} [...] "Labourites". The Labourites won 11 of the 62 seats in the Assembly elections, {{becoming}} the second-largest faction after the Rural League, and went on to finish second again in the 1918 Constituent Assembly elections.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "wet" [...] (moderate) and [...] "dry" [...] (conservative) {{wings of}} the Liberal <b>party</b> <b>co-operated</b> fairly harmoniously, {{but in the early}} 1970s as conservatives started to {{dominate}} in South Australia liberals led by Steele Hall broke off to form the Liberal Movement. In 1977, other dissident small-l liberal forces led by Don Chipp created the Australian Democrats.|$|R

25|$|These <b>parties</b> <b>co-operated</b> in {{coalition}} cabinets {{in which}} the Christian democrats {{had always been a}} partner: so either a centre-left coalition of the Christian democrats and social democrats was ruling or a centre-right coalition of Christian democrats and liberals. In the 1970s, the party system became more volatile: the Christian democratic parties lost seats, while new parties became successful, such as the radical democrat and progressive liberal D66.|$|R
50|$|This was a dual member seat {{where the}} Liberal {{party and the}} Labour <b>party</b> <b>co-operated</b> since 1906 by only putting up one {{candidate}} each against the Unionists. At the last election only one Unionist candidate stood. The sitting Labour MP was Ramsay MacDonald, {{who had been a}} leading figure in the party nationally and had been responsible for organising national electoral co-operation between the Labour and Liberal parties.|$|R
50|$|After winning {{one seat}} in the 1982 general {{election}} - it was {{unable to do so}} in 1981 - the party joined the opposition. The party became divided between a left wing and a centrist wing. The left wing wanted to co-operate with the Political Party of Radicals (which had split from the Catholic People's Party in 1968) and its left-wing allies, the Pacifist Socialist Party and the destalinized Communist Party of the Netherlands. The EVP was more reserved towards the CPN. The centrist wing wanted to co-operate with the Labour Party and the CDA. Although some members were willing to <b>co-operate,</b> the <b>party</b> congress rejected the co-operation with the CPN, the PSP and the PPR in the 1984 European Parliament elections.|$|R
25|$|Green parties: two {{distinct}} but <b>co-operating</b> Green <b>parties</b> operate in Great Britain: the Green Party of England and Wales (GPEW) and the Scottish Green Party, with opinion polling generally making {{no distinction between}} the two. The Green Party of England and Wales is led by Natalie Bennett, who had not previously been elected to Westminster, but stood in Holborn and St Pancras at the general election. The GPEW won the fourth-largest share of votes in the 2014 European elections, ahead of the Liberal Democrats. The Scottish Green Party is co-led by Patrick Harvie MSP and councillor Maggie Chapman, neither of whom were standing for election to Westminster. Caroline Lucas was elected as the only Green MP in 2010, {{in which the two}} parties received a combined 1% of the vote and were seventh overall. The Greens stood in 568 seats in Great Britain.|$|R
50|$|The party {{published}} newspaper Vremya (Russian: Time/Era). The ROS {{took part}} in the 1995 legislative election within the bloc Power to the People!, led by Baburin and Nikolai Ryzhkov. It won 1.6% of votes, failing to pass the 5% barrier, the ROS nevertheless got nine seats, all from majoritarian districts. The <b>party</b> <b>co-operated</b> with other formations of nationalist-communist orientation, e.g. the Communist Party of Russian Federation, whose candidate Gennady Zyuganov (supported by the Russian All-People's union) was defeated on the 1996 presidential election by Yeltsin.|$|R
25|$|The {{party is}} one of the oldest {{political}} parties in the UK, founded in 1904 as a split from the Social Democratic Federation. It consistently argues against vanguardism and denies the possibility of reforming capitalism in the interests of the working class. It refuses to engage in direct action or to <b>co-operate</b> with political <b>parties</b> that do not agree with the ideas set out in its founding document, the Object and Declaration of Principles. The SPGB and its companion parties in other countries constitute the World Socialist Movement.|$|R
50|$|The SNP retains {{close links}} with Plaid Cymru, its {{counterpart}} in Wales. MPs from both <b>parties</b> <b>co-operate</b> closely {{with each other}} and work as a single parliamentary group within the House of Commons. The SNP and Plaid Cymru were involved in joint campaigning during the 2005 General Election campaign. Both the SNP and Plaid Cymru, along with Mebyon Kernow from Cornwall, are members of the European Free Alliance (EFA), a European political party comprising regionalist political <b>parties.</b> The EFA <b>co-operates</b> with the larger European Green Party to form The Greens-European Free Alliance (Greens/EFA) group in the European Parliament.|$|R
5000|$|.....in {{the general}} maxims and {{principles}} of Mr. Fox's party, both {{with regard to the}} doctrine of the constitution, to foreign policy, and to the modes of internal legislation, I recognise those to which I have been led by the results of my own reflection, and by the tenor of my philosophical education. And I am ambitious to <b>co-operate</b> with that <b>party,</b> in labouring to realise those enlightened principles in the government of our own country...All my feelings carry me towards that party; and all my principles confirm the predilection. Into that party, there, I resolve to enlist myself.|$|R
5000|$|In 1926 the <b>party</b> <b>co-operated</b> {{with the}} German People's Party, DNVP and the Reich Party for Civil Rights and Deflation in a pact against [...] "red parties" [...] in Saxony, {{arguing that the}} left was using that state to launch its assault on the Weimar Republic in order to {{establish}} communism in Germany. The pact was not a success however as a Social Democratic Party of Germany government took office in the state and before the WP was squabbling with their Reich Party allies over the issue of property revaluation (which WP opposed and the Reich Party supported).|$|R
5000|$|Recalling that Kisangani {{also had}} to be demilitarised, the {{resolution}} reminded all parties {{to comply with the}} Ceasefire Agreement and called on Rwanda to use its influence to ensure that the RCD implemented the current resolution. It welcomed the deployment of the United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (MONUC) in the two captured towns and asked for all <b>parties</b> to <b>co-operate</b> with it. <b>Parties</b> to the Ceasefire Agreement were urged to refrain from military action during the inter-Congolese dialogue, and the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo was urged to resume its participation in the dialogue.|$|R
5000|$|United Nations Security Council Resolution 359, adopted on 15 August 1974, after noting {{with concern}} {{a report from}} the Secretary-General on the {{continuing}} military action in Cyprus and recalling that United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus was placed there with the full consent of the governments of Cyprus, Turkey and Greece, the Council deplored the fact that members of the Force had been killed and wounded. The Resolution demands that all parties respect the status of the Force and demands that all <b>parties</b> <b>co-operate</b> with them in carrying out their tasks in all areas of Cyprus.|$|R
25|$|Social Credit {{was below}} the 12 seats needed for {{official}} party {{status in the}} House of Commons. However, the six seats {{would have been just}} enough to give Clark's government a majority had the Progressive Conservatives formed a coalition government with Social Credit, or had the two parties otherwise agreed to work together. Clark managed to lure Socred MP Richard Janelle to the government caucus, but this still left the Tories five seats short of a majority. Clark however decided that he would govern as if he had a majority, and refused to grant the small Socred official party status, form a coalition, or <b>co-operate</b> with the <b>party</b> in any way.|$|R
50|$|In the 1980s the {{cooperation}} between PPR, CPN and PSP {{began to take}} shape. The <b>parties</b> <b>co-operated</b> mainly in municipal and provincial elections and legislatures, because {{a higher percentage of}} votes is necessary to gain seats in such elections. In the 1984 European election the PPR, CPN and PSP formed the Green Progressive Accord that entered with one list in the European elections. They won one seat, which rotated between the PSP and PPR. Party-members also met each other in grassroots extraparliamentary protest against nuclear power and nuclear weapons. Both the PSP and CPN were unwilling to co-operate intensively with the PPR, which was slightly larger in seats and which they saw as a non-socialist party.|$|R
