40|$|October 2005, {{extended}} {{to include more}} details on the strong renormalized coupling expansion. Abstract. We construct a manifestly gauge invariant Exact Renormalization Group for SU(N) Yang-Mills theory, in a form suitable for calculations without gauge fixing at any order of perturbation theory. The effective cutoff is incorporated via a manifestly realised spontaneously broken SU(N|N) gauge invariance. Diagrammatic methods are developed which allow the calculations to proceed without specifying the precise form of the <b>cutoff</b> <b>structure.</b> We confirm consistency by computing {{for the first time}} both the one and two loop beta function coefficients without fixing the gauge or specifying the details of the cutoff. We sketch how to incorporate quarks and thus compute in QCD. Finally we analyse the renormalization group behaviour as the renormalized coupling becomes large, and show that confinement is a consequence if and only if the coupling diverges in the limit that all modes are integrated out. We also investigate an expansion in the inverse square renormalized coupling, and show that under general assumptions it yields a new non-perturbative approximation scheme corresponding to expanding i...|$|E

During the last two decades, this number was only 145 million metric tons per year. The reduction in sediment transported down the Mississippi River is the result of engineering modification of the Mississippi, Missouri, and Ohio rivers and their tributaries by dams, meander <b>cutoffs,</b> river-training <b>structures,</b> and bank revetments and soil erosion control programs in the areas drained by them.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Design of a {{suitable}} power gating (e. g., multithreshold CMOS or super <b>cutoff</b> CMOS) <b>structure</b> {{is an important}} and challenging task in sub- 90 nm VLSI circuits where leakage currents are significant. In designs where the mode transitions are frequent, {{a significant amount of}} energy is consumed to turn on or off the power gating structure. It is thus desirable to develop a power gating solution that minimizes the energy consumed during mode transitions. This paper presents such a solution by recycling charge between the virtual power and ground rails immediately after entering the sleep mode and just before wakeup. The proposed method can save up to 43 % of the dynamic energy wasted during mode transition while maintaining the wake up time of the original circuit. It also reduces the peak negative voltage value and the settling time of the ground bounce. A I...|$|R
40|$|A novel wide {{stopband}} (WSB) {{low pass}} filter based on combination of defected ground structure (DGS), defected microstrip structure (DMS), and compensated microstrip capacitors is proposed. Their excellent defected characteristics are verified through simulation and measurements. Additionally to a sharp <b>cutoff,</b> the <b>structure</b> exhibits simple design and fabrication, very low insertion loss in the pass band of 0. 3 [*]dB and it achieves a wide rejection bandwidth with overall 20 [*]dB attenuation from 1. 5 [*]GHz up to 8. 3 [*]GHz. The compact low pass structure occupies an area of (0. 40 λg[*][*]× 0. 24 λg) where λg = 148 [*]mm is the waveguide length at the cut-off frequency 1. 1 [*]GHz. Comparison between measured and simulated results confirms {{the validity of the}} proposed method. Such filter topologies are utilized in many areas of communications systems and microwave technology because of their several benefits such as small losses, wide reject band, and high compactness...|$|R
40|$|Cosmic strings are {{potential}} candidates {{for a variety}} of interesting cosmological phenomena such as gamma ray bursts, gravitational wave bursts and ultra high energy cosmic rays. The predictions of cosmic string models, however, depend sensitively on the so far unresolved question {{of the size of the}} small-scale structure. This thesis deals largely with this problem. First, I present a gravitational back-reaction model that assumes the interaction between all Fourier modes that make up a given perturbation on a long cosmic string. This calculation leads to the generally accepted value of the small scale <b>structure</b> <b>cutoff.</b> It also, however, leads to paradoxical behaviour when applied to two oppositely moving modes: As one of the modes is stretched conformally the gravitational power radiated approaches a constant. This result is in contradiction with our expectation for the straight string limit in which no power is radiated. A more careful investigation of this problem reveals that, in the case of two oppositely moving modes, the gravitational power is exponentially suppressed when the wavelengths of the modes are sufficiently different. I use this result to construct an improved gravitational back-reaction model in which modes of very different wavelengths do not interact. This model leads to a new small scale <b>structure</b> <b>cutoff</b> which is sensitive to the initial spectrum of perturbations present on the string. I also tentatively examine the consequences of this result for the evolution of cosmic string loops. Finally, I investigate the effect of the presence of small scale structure on the gravitational wave-bursts produced at cosmic string cusps...|$|R
40|$|Before 1900, the Missouri–Mississippi River system transported an {{estimated}} 400 {{million metric tons}} per year of sediment from {{the interior of the}} United States to coastal Louisiana. During the last two decades (1987 – 2006), this transport has averaged 145 million metric tons per year. The cause for this substantial decrease in sediment has been attributed to the trapping characteristics of dams constructed on the muddy part of the Missouri River during the 1950 s. However, reexamination of more than 60 years of water- and sediment-discharge data indicates that the dams alone are not the sole cause. These dams trap about 100 – 150 million metric tons per year, which represent about half the decrease in sediment discharge near the mouth of the Mississippi. Changes in relations between water discharge and suspended-sediment concentration suggest that the Missouri–Mississippi has been transformed from a transport-limited to a supply-limited system. Thus, other engineering activities such as meander <b>cutoffs,</b> river-training <b>structures,</b> and bank revetments as well as soil erosion controls have trapped sediment, eliminated sediment sources, or protected sediment that was once available for transport episodically throughout the year. Removing major engineering structures such as dams probably would not restore sediment discharges to pre- 1900 state, mainly because of the numerous smaller engineering structures and other soil-retention works throughout th...|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} {{analysis}} of star formation and feedback recipes appropriate for galactic smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations. Using an isolated Milky Way-like galaxy, we constrain these recipes based on well-established observational results. Our star formation recipe is based on that of Katz (1992) with the additional inclusion of physically motivated supernova feedback recipes. We propose a new feedback recipe in which type II supernovae are modelled using an analytical treatment of blastwaves. With this feedback mechanism and a tuning of other star formation parameters, the star formation in our isolated Milky Way-like galaxy is constant and follows the slope and normalisation of the observed Schmidt law. In addition, we reproduce the low density <b>cutoff</b> and filamentary <b>structure</b> of star formation observed in disk galaxies. Our final recipe will enable better comparison of cosmological N-body simulations with observations.

40|$|We {{study the}} domain {{geometry}} during spinodal decomposition of a 50 : 50 binary mixture in two dimensions. Extending arguments developed to treat nonconserved coarsening, we obtain approximate analytic {{results for the}} distribution of domain areas and perimeters during the dynamics. The main approximation is to regard the interfaces separating domains as moving independently. While this is true in the nonconserved case, {{it is not in}} the conserved one. Our results can therefore be considered as a “first-order” approximation for the distributions. In contrast to the celebrated Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner distribution of structures of the minority phase in the limit of very small concentration, the distribution of domain areas in the 50 : 50 case does not have a <b>cutoff.</b> Large <b>structures</b> areas or perimeters retain the morphology of a percolative or critical initial condition, for quenches from high temperatures or the critical point, respectively. The corresponding distributions are described by a cA− t ail, where c and t are exactly known. With increasing time, small structures tend to have a spherical shape with a smooth surface before evaporating by diffusion. In this regime, the number density of domains with area A scales as A 1 / 2, as in the Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner theory. The threshold between the small and large regimes is determined by the characteristic area A~t 2 / 3. Finally, we study the relation between perimeters and areas and the distribution of boundary lengths, finding results that are consistent with the ones summarized above. We test our predictions with Monte Carlo simulations of the two-dimensional Ising model...|$|R
40|$|Ultralow {{frequency}} (ULF) {{waves at}} the geomagnetic equator are studied {{by using a}} small magnetometer array and a one-dimensional electromagnetic wave model. Most ULF waves observed at low latitudes {{have been associated with}} shear Alfven mode hydromagnetic resonances in the plasmasphere. Near the equator it is difficult to excite these resonances, and the wave activity is attributed to fast mode waves. The phase difference data recorded at longitudinally spaced, equatorial magnetometers shows a marked change around dawn when one station is sunlit while the other is still in darkness. The phase structure with latitude also shows large phase shifts near the equator, in agreement with previous studies. A model of ULF wave propagation through the equatorial ionosphere is presented and used to compare with the observed amplitude and phase properties. It is shown that the observed frequencies are {{in the vicinity of the}} wave cutoff frequency where the phase structure becomes complicated. For frequencies above the <b>cutoff,</b> the phase <b>structure</b> across dawn is directly related to dawn-associated changes in electron density in the ionosphere...|$|R
40|$|Anisotropy of {{the cosmic}} {{microwave}} background radiation (CMB) originates from both tensor and scalar perturbations. To study the characteristics of each of these two kinds of perturbations, one has to determine the contribution of each to the anisotropy of CMB. For example, the ratio of the power spectra of tensor/scalar perturbations can be used to tighten bounds on the scalar spectral index. We investigate here the implications for the tensor/scalar ratio of the recent discovery (noted in astro-ph/ 0410139) that the introduction of a minimal length <b>cutoff</b> in the <b>structure</b> of spacetime does not leave boundary terms invariant. Such a cutoff introduces an ambiguity in the choice of action for tensor and scalar perturbations, which in turn can affect this ratio. We numerically solve for both tensor and scalar mode equations in a near-de-sitter background and explicitly find the cutoff dependence of the tensor/scalar ratio during inflation.

40|$|The cross {{sections}} of neutrino-nucleon scattering at high energies are evaluated with quark masses at next-to-leading order in strong interaction corrections. We compare the results with {{two kinds of}} schemes for treating the heavy quarks, the fixed flavor number scheme and the variable flavor number scheme for muon neutrino-nucleon interaction, and discuss which scheme is more relevant. The optimized parton distribution functions (PDF) for the flavor number schemes are also evaluated. The tau mass, {{much larger than the}} muon mass, suppresses the {{cross sections}} at low energies. We calculate the tau neutrino and antineutrino cross sections including the lepton mass corrections with low Q-extrapolated structure functions. Uncertainties due to the factorization scale, PDF choice, and the momentum transfer <b>cutoff</b> for the <b>structure</b> functions are also discussed with total theoretical errors. At ultra high energies (UHE), the same cross sections can be used for all flavors. We applied our evaluated cross sections to estimate the UHE neutrino event rates from lunar detection. The effective lunar aperture depends on the frequency and the minimum detectable electric field. We evaluate the effective aperture for a range of inputs. The event rates for both neutrino and cosmic rays are calculated in the standard model and compared with the enhanced neutrino-nucleon cross section for mini-black hole production. Lunar detection of UHE neutrino fluxes in the standard model will be challenging because low event rates are predicted...|$|R
30|$|This yearly {{retention}} {{has also}} facilitated the engagement of participants beyond the projected eighth grade cutoff, where youth would typically age {{out of the}} program. Many of these alumni participants opted to continue their involvement by engaging as volunteer facilitators in the CSCs in their respective communities and are now identified as community ambassadors. This level of sustained participation further underscores the need and value of consistent programming for youth across communities. Moreover, this level of continued engagement from past participants into a leadership position aids in program sustainability as {{not only is it}} cost-effective for a charitable organization to have a large volunteer pool to help facilitate programming, but this also allows for that sense of relatedness discussed previously because of the close age gap between youth and program staff. Further, this addition to programming provides an opportunity for those volunteers to develop leadership skills and contribute to their community by giving back to a program they were involved in, which is the ultimate goal of youth development (Bowers et al., 2010; Lerner et al., 2005). Lastly, accommodating the wide age range in the CSCs has posed a challenge for program facilitators. Therefore, the plan is to develop more age-targeted module modifications and facilitation training which should help mitigate these issues. Moreover, in engaging youth beyond the age <b>cutoff,</b> a new <b>structured</b> out-of-school program for youth ages 14 to 18 will be launched in summer 2017.|$|R
40|$|I obtain {{and examine}} the {{implications}} of one-dimensional analytic solutions for return-current losses on an initially power-law distribution of energetic electrons with a sharp low-energy cutoff in flare plasma with classical (collisional) resistivity. These solutions show, for example, that return-current losses are not sensitive to plasma density, but are sensitive to plasma temperature and the low energy cutoff of the injected nonthermal electron distribution. A characteristic distance from the electron injection site, x(sub rc), is derived. At distances less than x(sub rc) the electron flux density is not reduced by return-current losses, but plasma heating can be substantial in this region, in the upper, coronal part of the flare loop. Before the electrons reach the collisional thick-target region of the flare loop, an injected power-law electron distribution with a low-energy <b>cutoff</b> maintains that <b>structure,</b> but with a flat energy distribution below the cutoff energy, which is now determined by the total potential drop experienced by the electrons. Modifications due {{to the presence of}} collisional losses are discussed. I compare these results with earlier analytical results and with more recent numerical simulations. Emslie's 1980 conjecture that there is a maximum integrated X-ray source brightness on the order of 10 (exp - 15) photons per square centimeter per second per square centimeter is examined. I find that this is not actually a maximum brightness and its value is parameter dependent, but it is nevertheless a valuable benchmark for identifying return-current losses in hard X-ray spectra. I discuss an observational approach to identifying return-current losses in flare data, including identification of a return-current "bump" in X-ray light curves at low photon energies...|$|R
40|$|The {{long term}} {{side effects of}} any newly {{introduced}} drug is a subject of intense research, and often raging controversies. One such example is the dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP 4) inhibitor used for treating type 2 diabetes, which is inconclusively implicated in increased susceptibility to acute pancreatitis. Previously, based on a computational analysis of the spatial and electrostatic properties of active site residues, we have demonstrated that phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) from Bacillus cereus is a prolyl peptidase using in vivo experiments. In the current work, we first report the inhibition of the native activity of PI-PLC by two DPP 4 inhibitors - vildagliptin (LAF- 237) and K- 579. While vildagliptin inhibited PI-PLC at micromolar concentrations, K- 579 was a potent inhibitor even at nanomolar concentrations. Subsequently, we queried a comprehensive, non-redundant set of 5000 human proteins (50 % similarity <b>cutoff)</b> with known <b>structures</b> using serine protease (SPASE) motifs derived from trypsin and DPP 4. A pancreatic lipase and a gastric lipase are among the proteins that are identified as proteins having promiscuous SPASE scaffolds that could interact with DPP 4 inhibitors. The presence of such scaffolds in human lipases is expected since they share the same catalytic mechanism with PI-PLC. However our methodology also detects other proteins, often with a completely different enzymatic mechanism, that have significantly congruent domains with the SPASE motifs. The reported elevated levels of serum lipase, although contested, could be rationalized by inhibition of lipases reported here.  In an effort to further {{our understanding of the}} spatial and electrostatic basis of DPP 4 inhibitors, we have also done a comprehensive analysis of all 76 known DPP 4 structures liganded to inhibitors till date. Also, the methodology presented here can be easily adopted for other drugs, and provide the first line of filtering in the identification of pathways that might be inadvertently affected due to promiscuous scaffolds in proteins...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Recent {{studies have}} shown the {{enhanced}} diagnostic capability of the waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) over BMI. However, while a <b>structured</b> <b>cutoff</b> hierarchy has been established for BMI, a rigorous analysis to define individuals as obese using the WHtR has not been performed on a sample of American adults. This study attempts to establish a cutoff for the WHtR using metabolic syndrome as the outcome. Methods The study sample consisted of individuals {{that were part of}} the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health). The final sample for analysis consisted of 7 935 participants (3 469 males, 4 466 females) that were complete respondents for the variables of interest at Wave IV. The participants ranged from 24. 55 - 33. 60  years. Weighted and unweighted receiver operator characteristics (ROC) analyses were performed predicting metabolic syndrome from the WHtR. Cutoffs were chosen using the Youden index. The derived cutoffs were validated by logistic regression analysis on the Add Health participants and an external sample of 1 236 participants from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Results The ROC analysis resulted in a WHtR cutoff of 0. 578 (Youden Index[*]=[*] 0. 50) for the full sample of complete respondents, 0. 578 (Youden Index[*]=[*] 0. 55) for males only, and 0. 580 (Youden Index[*]=[*] 0. 50) for females only. The area under the curve was 0. 798 (95  % CI (0. 788, 0. 809)) for the full sample of complete respondents, 0. 833 (95  % CI (0. 818, 0. 848)) for males only, and 0. 804 (95  % CI (0. 791, 0. 818)) for females only. Participants in the validation sample with a WHtR greater than the derived cutoff were more likely (Odds Ratio[*]=[*] 9. 8, 95  % CI (6. 2, 15. 3)) to have metabolic syndrome than those that were not. Conclusion A WHtR cutoff of 0. 580 is optimal for discriminating individuals with metabolic syndrome in two nationally representative samples of young adults. This cutoff is an improvement over a previously recommended cutoff of 0. 5 as well as other cutoffs derived from international samples...|$|R
