25|$|While mostly {{chrysotile}} asbestos fibers were once used in automobile brake pads, shoes, and <b>clutch</b> <b>discs,</b> contaminants of amphiboles were present. Since approximately the mid-1990s, brake pads, new or replacement, have been manufactured instead with linings made of ceramic, carbon, metallic and aramid fiber (Twaron or Kevlar—the same material used in bulletproof vests).|$|R
50|$|In the {{friction}} material industry, direct hot pressing plays an increasing role in production of sintered brake pads and clutches. Sintered brake pads are increasingly used for high speed train and motorcycle applications, {{as well as}} wind energy, ATVs, mountain bikes and industrial applications. Sintered <b>clutch</b> <b>discs</b> are predominantly used for heavy-duty trucks, vessels, tractors and other agricultural machines.|$|R
40|$|Friction {{material}} properties {{are important to}} clutch and brake performance, when applying rubbing force on a rotating friction surfaces heat will be generated and the surface temperature will increase this change in temperature will change {{the properties of the}} material, coefficient of friction and wear mechanism will change.

50|$|The clutch is cable-driven, {{and has a}} big fork on the outside-top part of the housing. It has a {{cover in}} the bell housing that lets you change the <b>clutch</b> <b>disc</b> without taking off the gearbox.It {{has a lot of}} {{similarities}} with the Getrag F16 Gearbox, that has a weaker main shaft. It also has a lot of similarities with the Daewoo D16 and D20 Gearboxes.|$|E
50|$|The {{transmission}} uses {{a hydraulic}} clutch, {{except for the}} Cobra which was mechanical. The Cobra had an 11-inch <b>clutch</b> <b>disc.</b> The entire case, including the bell housing, is made of aluminum. The T-56 has a synchromesh made up of brass synchros for the GM and Ford applications, and stainless steel in the Dodge application. The transmission also features internal stops which render stopbolts on the shifter mechanism unnecessary.|$|E
50|$|A common {{example of}} riding the clutch {{is to keep}} slight continual {{pressure}} on the clutch pedal whilst driving, as when a driver habitually rests his/her foot on the clutch pedal {{instead of on the}} floorboard or dead pedal. Although this slight pressure is not enough to allow the <b>clutch</b> <b>disc</b> itself to slip, it is enough to keep the release bearing against the release springs. This causes the bearing to remain spinning, which leads to premature bearing failure.|$|E
50|$|A {{wet clutch}} is {{immersed}} in a cooling lubricating fluid that also keeps surfaces clean and provides smoother performance and longer life. Wet clutches, however, tend to lose some energy to the liquid. Since the surfaces of a wet clutch can be slippery (as with a motorcycle clutch bathed in engine oil), stacking multiple <b>clutch</b> <b>discs</b> can compensate for the lower coefficient of friction and so eliminate slippage under power when fully engaged.The Hele-Shaw clutch was a wet clutch that relied entirely on viscous effects, rather than on friction.|$|R
50|$|Dual-mass {{flywheels}} {{were developed}} to address the escalation of torque and power, especially at low revs. The growing {{concern for the environment}} and the adoption of more stringent regulations have marked the development of more efficient new engines, lowering the cylinder number to 3 or even 2 cylinders, and allowing the delivery of more torque and power at low revolutions. The counterpart has been an increase in the level of vibration which traditional <b>clutch</b> <b>discs</b> are unable to absorb. This is where the dual-mass flywheels play a key role, making these mechanical developments more viable.|$|R
5000|$|This luxury vehicle had a {{water-cooled}} six-cylinder OHC engine with {{a capacity}} of 3406 cc and brakepower of [...] The engine camshaft was driven by a Bevel, which gave power to multiple dry <b>clutch</b> <b>discs</b> and a 4-speed gearbox to the rear wheels. The achievable maximum speed of this approximately 2400 kg car was 110 km/h. The chassis had a central tube construction; the foreground is a rigid axle with overhead Transverse leaf spring and a rear swing axle with half transverse leaf springs was installed. The wheels were designed as slices.|$|R
50|$|Riding {{the clutch}} {{occurs when the}} driver does not fully release the clutch pedal. This results in the <b>clutch</b> <b>disc</b> {{slipping}} against the flywheel and some engine power not being transferred to the drive train and wheels. While inefficient, most drivers routinely use this technique effectively when driving in reverse (as fully engaging the reverse gear results in velocity too great for the short distance traveled) or in stop-and-go traffic (as {{it is easier to}} control the throttle and acceleration at very slow speeds).|$|E

50|$|A clutch damper is {{a device}} that softens the {{response}} of the clutch engagement/disengagement. In automotive applications, this is often provided by a mechanism in the <b>clutch</b> <b>disc</b> centres. In addition to the damped disc centres, which reduce driveline vibration, pre-dampers may be used to reduce gear rattle at idle by changing the natural frequency of the disc. These weaker springs are compressed solely by the radial vibrations of an idling engine. They are fully compressed and no longer in use once the main damper springs take up drive.|$|E

5000|$|When {{shifting}} properly, {{the driver}} [...] "shifts" [...] to another gear and then releases {{pressure on the}} clutch pedal to re-engage the engine to the driveshaft. If the pedal is released quickly, a definite lurch can be felt as the engine and driveshaft re-engage and their speeds equalize. However, if the clutch is released slowly the <b>clutch</b> <b>disc</b> will [...] "slip" [...] against the flywheel; this friction permits the engine a smoother transition to its new rotation speed. Such routine slippage causes wear on the clutch analogous to the wear-and-tear on a brake pad when stopping. Some amount of wear is unavoidable, but with better clutching/shifting technique it can be minimized by releasing the clutch {{as close to the}} correct engine speed for the gear and vehicle speed as possible. When upshifting, this will involve allowing the engine speed to fall. Conversely, when downshifting, increasing the engine speed with the accelerator prior to releasing clutch will result in a smoother transition and minimal clutch wear.|$|E
50|$|In December 1899 Lanchester and his {{brothers}} created the Lanchester Engine Company in order to manufacture cars that could be sold to the public. A factory was acquired in Montgomery Street, Sparkbrook, Birmingham, known as the Armourer Works. In his new factory, Lanchester designed a new ten horsepower twin cylinder engine. He decided to use a worm drive transmission and designed a machine to cut the worm gears. He patented this machine in 1905 and it continued for 25 years to produce all of the Lanchester worm gears. He also introduced the use of splined shafts and couplings in place of keys and keyways, another innovation that he patented. The back axle had roller bearings and Lanchester designed the machines to make these. His car was designed with the engine placed between the two front seats {{rather than at the}} front, and also had a side mounted tiller rather than a steering wheel. The transmission also included a system similar to modern disc brakes that clamped the <b>clutch</b> <b>disc</b> for braking, rather than using a separate system as in most cars.|$|E

50|$|However, as the {{development}} process continued, engineers at BorgWarner discovered that, with clever software programming, they could control the variable electromagnetic multi-disc clutch {{to a point where}} it would allow the front and rear drive shafts to turn at different rotational speeds on its own, without the aid of a planetary or bevel geared center differential. In Auto mode the new software algorithms allowed the multi-disc clutch pack's friction and <b>clutch</b> <b>discs</b> to slip as needed, simulating a planetary or bevel geared center differential, making a geared differential redundant. Thus, the geared differential was abandoned and therefore never included on the final production version of the four-wheel drive system.|$|R

5000|$|The 944 Turbo S's {{suspension}} had the [...] "M030" [...] option {{consisting of}} Koni adjustable shocks front and rear, with ride height adjusting threaded collars {{on the front}} struts, progressive rate springs, larger hollow rear anti-roll/torsion bars, harder durometer suspension bushings, larger 26.8 mm hollow anti-roll/torsion bars at the front, and chassis stiffening brackets in the front frame rails. The air conditioning dryer lines are routed so as to clear the front frame brace on the driver's side. The 944 Turbo S wheels, known as the Club Sport design, were 16-inch Fuchs forged and flat-dished, similar to the Design 90 wheel. Wheel widths were 7 in in the front, and 9 in in the rear with 52 mm offset; sizes of the Z-rated tires were 225/50 {{in the front and}} 245/45 in the rear. The front and rear fender edges were rolled to accommodate the larger wheels. The manual transmission (case code designation: AOR) featured a higher friction <b>clutch</b> <b>disc</b> setup, an external cooler, and a limited slip differential with a 40% lockup setting. The Turbo S front brakes were borrowed from the Porsche 928 S4, with larger Brembo GT 4-piston fixed calipers and 12-inch discs; rear Brembo brakes remained the same as a standard Turbo. ABS also came standard.|$|E
5000|$|The rear {{suspension}} was significantly revised including a widened track, softer torsion bars {{and the addition}} of a unique Z-configuration equalizing torsion spring. On US, UK and Ireland models, the generator output was increased from 180 to 360 watts, and the entire electrical system was upgraded from 6 volts to 12 volts. The <b>clutch</b> <b>disc</b> also increased in size and changes were made to the flywheel. New equipment included a driver's armrest on the door and locking buttons on both doors. Safety improvements included two-speed windscreen wipers, reversing lights (in some markets), and a driver's side mirror. In accord with the newly enacted US Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 108, North American models received a dual-circuit brake system, the clear glass headlamp covers were deleted; the headlamps were brought forward to {{the leading edge of the}} front fenders, and the sealed-beam units were exposed and surrounded by chrome bezels. (Throughout the rest of the world markets the 1967 model sold in Europe et.al. still retained the older headlights (including its counterparts in Latin America - especially the Brasilian market model retaining the pre-1965 bodystyle). Another oddity of the 1967 North American market Beetle is the rear bumper overriders (towel rails) - the overriders have a different shape unlike the older models besides the one-year only engine decklid.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a study of {{driveline}} modelling. The modelling is done in MathModelica. Components from the free standard Modelica library have been used when appropriate. The remaining components have either been defined by mathematical equations only or by using mathematical equations together with standard components.

To this, models of engine, driver, chassis and air drag have been connected and simulated during different driving cycles. The vehicle model is moving in longitudinal motion.

40|$|Abstract — Clutch {{system is}} among the main systems inside a vehicle. Clutch is a {{mechanical}} device located between a vehicle engine and its transmission and provides mechanical coupling between the engine and transmission input shaft. Clutch system comprise of flywheel, <b>clutch</b> <b>disc</b> plate and friction material, pressure plate, clutch cover, diaphragm spring and the linkage necessary to operate the clutch. The clutch engages the transmission gradually by allowing {{a certain amount of}} slippage between the flywheel and the transmission input shaft. However, the slipping mechanism of the clutch generates heat energy due to friction between the <b>clutch</b> <b>disc</b> and the flywheel. At high sliding velocity, excessive frictional heat is generated which lead to high temperature rise at the <b>clutch</b> <b>disc</b> surface, and this causes thermo-mechanical problems such as thermal deformations and thermo-elastic instability which can lead to thermal cracking, wear and other mode of failure of the <b>clutch</b> <b>disc</b> component. In this project, the modeling of clutch is done in detailed using modeling software. After that the FEM analysis is done for sintered iron friction material. The stresses & deformation obtained for this friction material is then compared to analysis software result. The analysis is done for worn out friction disc. Index Terms — Coefficient of friction, von-misses stress, young’s modulus and poisons ratio...|$|E
50|$|Although it was uncommon, {{the drive}} bands could {{fall out of}} adjustment, {{allowing}} the car to creep, particularly when cold, adding another hazard to attempting to start the car: a person cranking the engine could be forced backward while still holding the crank as the car crept forward, although it was nominally in neutral. As the car utilized a wet clutch, this condition could also occur in cold weather, when the thickened oil prevents the <b>clutch</b> <b>discs</b> from slipping freely. Power reached the differential through a single universal joint attached to a torque tube which drove the rear axle; some models (typically trucks, but available for cars, as well) could be equipped with an optional two-speed Ruckstell rear axle shifted by a floor-mounted lever which provided an underdrive gear for easier hill climbing. All gears were vanadium steel running in an oil bath.|$|R
