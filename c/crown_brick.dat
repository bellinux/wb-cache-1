5000|$|Built as a {{rectangular}} block using common bond brick walls with a gable roof. There is a three-tiered steeple above the entrance. There are tall, narrow arched windows {{divided into three}} sashes of three amber-colored panes. Each window has a stone sill with a semicircular <b>brick</b> <b>crown</b> with <b>brick</b> tabs. The windows on the south or primary facade resemble arches supported by piers with a capital and base. The walls are topped by a plain frieze-like cornice. The steeple has three, incrementally smaller, tiers. Each section has a shingle covered hip roof. Within the lower two section is the church bell.|$|R
5000|$|The {{power station}} was, like the dam, built {{with a view}} to aesthetics. The {{exterior}} features dressed stone blocks, while its rooftop turrets <b>crowned</b> by <b>brick</b> domes have a remarkably historicist and expressionist character. Other details stand out as well, like the elephant head supporting a balcony, which was produced by sculptor [...] Presented in Paris at the Decorative Arts Exposition of 1921, the building won a gold medal.|$|R
40|$|The present {{dissertation}} {{concentrates on}} the study of construction rituals of the Hindu tradition, with special attention to the prathameshtakaanyaasa (the laying of the first stones), the garbhanyaasa (the placing of the consecration deposit) and the muurdheshtakaanyaasa (the placing of the <b>crowning</b> <b>bricks).</b> The basis for the study is formed, on the one hand, by Sanskrit texts on architecture and ritual, dating from ca. the 7 th to the 15 th centuries AD, and, on the other hand, by the archaeological material. The chief textual source is the Kaashyapashilpa, a South Indian treatise on art and architecture and ritual, usually dated 11 – 12 th century AD. Three chapters from the Kaashyapashilpa, which deal with the three aforementioned construction rituals, have been critically edited, translated and provided with a commentary. In order to answer the questions whether construction rituals mentioned in the ancient Sanskrit treatises were ever performed and if so, whether they were performed according to the textual prescriptions, the information given by the Sanskrit texts have been compared with the material traces of construction rituals originating from various regions of South and Southeast Asia.

50|$|Gisleham church, Holy Trinity, {{is one of}} 38 {{existing}} round-tower {{churches in}} Suffolk. The church has a late Anglo-Saxon or early Norman round base topped with a 15th-century octagonal <b>brick</b> <b>crown.</b> The medieval church was restored in 1861, 1887 and the chancel in 1902 to 1908. Holy Trinity has Grade I status.|$|R
50|$|Simple pillars {{divide the}} main nave {{from the side}} aisles in the interior. The five pillars divide the space into six bays. The first bay {{includes}} the vestibule and features a spiral wooden staircase to the choir loft. The apse is square in shape and is <b>crowned</b> by a <b>brick</b> lanterned dome.|$|R
50|$|Locally {{distinct}} light colored brick called Cream City <b>brick</b> <b>crowns</b> the high-rise. Copper panels {{adorn the}} spandrels, while organic foliage patterns and terracotta designs decorate the façade. The building stands 250 {{feet tall and}} has 20 floors. Demolished {{to make room for}} the building in 1930, a Prohibition-era speakeasy was formerly on the site.|$|R
50|$|The {{opening of}} the line through to Cherry Gully was {{accomplished}} about five weeks late, but considering the difficulties experienced was an excellent effort for all concerned. The difficulties of driving and lining the tunnel had meant that three shifts of workers were eventually required on the work. Yet, the work using concrete to line the tunnel apart from the <b>brick</b> <b>crown</b> was a first in Queensland, and in all probability Australia.|$|R
5000|$|James Jones House is a {{historic}} home located at Greensboro in Greene County, Pennsylvania. It was built about 1879, and is a 2 1/2-story, three bay, [...] "I"-plan brick dwelling in the Italianate style. A front porch in the Colonial Revival style was added about 1900 and a 1 1/2-story frame addition was built about 1950. The house features a shallow pitched roof with wide eaves and tall, arched windows with raised <b>brick</b> <b>crowns.</b>|$|R
50|$|On the {{exterior}} {{there is often}} a corbeled <b>brick</b> <b>crown,</b> in which the projecting courses of brick act as a drip course to keep rainwater from running down {{the exterior}} walls. A cap, hood, or shroud serves to keep rainwater out of the exterior of the chimney; rain in the chimney is a much greater problem in chimneys lined with impervious flue tiles or metal liners than with the traditional masonry chimney, which soaks up all but the most violent rain. Some chimneys have a spark arrestor incorporated into the crown or cap.|$|R

Why, yonder wretched skeleton hath wealth sufficient to pave the whole lane he lives in with dollars, and scarce miss them {{out of his own}} iron chest; yet he goes mad after the philosopher's stone. And besides, he would have cheated a poor serving-man, as he thought me at first, with trash that was not worth a penny. Match for match, quoth the devil to the collier; if his false medicine was worth my good <b>crowns,</b> my true <b>brick</b> dust is as well worth his good gold." ...|$|R
5000|$|Twelve years later, in 1988, {{the diocese}} was renamed the Diocese of Évry-Corbeil-Essonnes and Évry Cathedral was {{commissioned}} from the Swiss architect Mario Botta. Initial studies were conceived the same year, and ground breaking {{took place in}} spring 1991. He designed a strikingly contemporary cylindrical concrete tower, 34.5 meters (113 feet) high, faced with 840,000 handmade red <b>bricks</b> <b>crowned</b> by a ring of trees {{around the edge of}} the roof. The altar was created from a single piece of white Carrara marble. Construction was funded by contributions from more than 300,000 donors, a national fund created between the two World Wars for reconstruction religious structures destroyed in the Paris region, a major contribution from the Diocese of Munich (Germany), and public agencies in the Île-de-France region.|$|R
50|$|Sarban minaret (مناره ساربان) is a {{historical}} minaret in Isfahan, Iran. It {{dates back to the}} Seljuq era. The Sarban minaret is located in the north of Jouybareh district, not far from Chehel Dokhtaran minaret. It seems that there was a mosque beside this minaret in the past, but it does not exist any more. The minaret consists of seven different parts. The first part has brick bolster work. The second and third parts have masterly decorative brickwork. The fourth part is its first <b>crown,</b> which has <b>brick</b> muqarnas with turquoise tiles. The fifth part has decorative bricks. the sixth part is the second crown and the seventh part is the vertex of the minaret. The minaret is 54 m (some say 48 m ?) high and is the highest historical minaret in the Isfahan province.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, Erik Flagstad Rasmussen and Knud Thomsen won the {{competition}} {{which had been}} specifically directed to attract responses from the city's architects. The church itself is a square-shaped building of yellow <b>brick</b> <b>crowned</b> with a low octagonal spire. There are four triangular gables of glass and concrete, all with pointed tops. Completed in 1967, the stained-glass gable windows were designed by Jens Urup Jensen with themes representing Christmas (north) with a red Star of Bethlehem, Easter (east, above the altar) with a cross, Whitsun (south) with 12 red tongues symbolising the Apostles and a blue-toned Water of Life frame (west) above the organ gallery. The colouring of {{the north and south}} windows is rather cool while the designs to the east and west are much warmer.|$|R
5000|$|Jinbi Lu runs roughly {{parallel}} to {{and south of}} Dongfeng Lu, reached from Beijing Lu. Two large Chinese pagodas rise in the vicinity, each a solid thirteen storeys of whitewashed <b>brick</b> <b>crowned</b> with four iron cockerels. The West Pagoda was built between 824 and 859, during the Tang dynasty; its original counterpart, the East Pagoda, was built at the same time, but was destroyed by an earthquake in 1833 and rebuilt in the same Tang style in 1882. [...] South down Dongsi Jie, past another mosque, {{the entrance to the}} West Pagoda is along a narrow lane on the right. In the tiny surrounding courtyard, sociable idlers while away sunny afternoons playing cards and sipping tea in the peaceful, ramshackle surroundings. The East Pagoda is a more cosmetic, slightly tilted duplicate standing in an ornamental garden a few minutes' walk east on Shulin Jie. The temples associated with both pagodas are closed to the public.|$|R
50|$|The first floor's north facade is {{adorned with}} two double-hung windows with {{projecting}} segmented arch crowns and stone sills. Also {{on the north}} facade is the original main public entry door and an arched transom window. The window and door treatments throughout the exterior {{are similar to those}} found on the first floor's north facade. The fire station doors, which were replaced after the fire station first moved from the building in 1931 and again in 1954, were eventually restored.On the rear (south) facade is an attached one story structure that housed the men's jail cells. On its west facade the original steel and wood door is still extant and on its south facade there are three windows complete with metal bars. All of the jail building's windows and doors feature arched <b>brick</b> <b>crowns,</b> a theme repeating from the two-story portion of the structure. While the brick entablature and dentil work both reflect the main two-story building, the jail building lacks the overhanging eaves and brackets. The rear elevation of the main building has one second floor window.|$|R
5000|$|Allen {{designed}} the library in the Classical revival style. A pediment and four stone Doric columns adorn {{the front of}} the 50 ft by 50 ft brick structure, constructed at a cost of $70,000. The trim and base of the building are done in stone. The stone lintels of the windows are designed with the Greek key pattern. Other architectural details include wreaths, torches and egg and dart molding. In the interior, fluted stone columns, and lintels ornamented with medallions form the octagonal third floor reading room. Bronze torches light the entryways and vestibules. A winding marble staircase leads up to this room that is <b>crowned</b> by a <b>brick,</b> copper and stained glass dome rising 60 ft above the ground. The dome, constructed by the R. Guastavino Company, {{is one of the more}} than 1,000 they built, including those at the library of the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York, and the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C.|$|R
