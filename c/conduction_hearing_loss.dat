40|$|In {{experimental}} animal studies, exogenous hyaluronan (HA) {{has been shown}} to exert beneficial effects on the healing of tympanic membrane perforation.

40|$|Objective: The {{fact that}} {{vibration}} {{of the skull}} causes a hearing sensation has been known since the 19 th century. This mode of hearing was termed <b>hearing</b> by bone <b>conduction.</b> Although there {{has been more than}} a century of research on <b>hearing</b> by bone <b>conduction,</b> its physiology is not completely understood. Lately, new insights into the physiology of <b>hearing</b> by bone <b>conduction</b> have been reported. Knowledge of the physiology, clinical aspects, and limitations of bone conduction sound is important for clinicians dealing with <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> and is the purpose of this review. Data Sources: The data were compiled from the published literature in the areas of clinical bone <b>conduction</b> <b>hearing,</b> bone <b>conduction</b> <b>hearing</b> aids, basic research on bone conduction physiology, and recent research on bone <b>conduction</b> <b>hearing</b> from our laboratory. Conclusion: Five factors contributing to bone <b>conduction</b> <b>hearing</b> have been identified: 1) sound radiated into the external ear canal, 2) middle ear ossicle inertia, 3) inertia of the cochlear fluids, 4) compression of the cochlear walls, and 5) pressure transmission from the cerebrospinal fluid. Of these five, inertia of the cochlear fluid seems most important. Bone conduction sound is believed to reflect the true cochlear function; however, certain conditions such as middle ear diseases can affect bone conduction sensitivity, but less than for air conduction. The bone conduction route can also be used for hearing aids; since the bone conduction route is less efficient than the air conduction route, bone <b>conduction</b> <b>hearing</b> aids are primarily used for <b>hearing</b> <b>losses</b> where air <b>conduction</b> <b>hearing</b> aids are contraindicated...|$|R

Between January 2003 and December 2009, 36 patients (range 6 - 14 years) were operated on for cholesteatoma. We considered the sites involved by the cholesteatoma (mastoid, antrum, attic, middle ear, Eustachian tube), surgical techniques used (intact canal wall, canal wall down) and how our habits changed over the years; moreover, we evaluated ossicular chain conditions and how we managed the ossiculoplasty. As outcomes, we considered the percentage of residual and recurrent cholesteatoma for each technique and hearing function (air bone gap closure, high frequencies bone <b>conduction</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss)</b> at follow-up. Intact canal wall was performed in 20 patients and canal wall down in 13 patients, in 9 as first surgery. In both groups, we observed improvement of the air bone gap; in the intact canal wall group, a residual cholesteatoma was observed in 6 patients whereas, during follow-up, 2 patients who underwent a canal wall down showed a recurrent cholesteatoma that was treated in an outpatient setting. Eradication of cholesteatoma and restoration of hearing function in paediatric patients present unique surgical challenges. Our experience shows an increased choice of intact canal wall over the years.

40|$|Arsenic {{determination}} {{was carried}} out on hair, urine, and blood samples taken from groups of 10 -year-old boys, each numbering 20 to 25 individuals, residing in a region polluted by arsenic. In all the examined materials considerably elevated concentrations of arsenic were found. The relation of the observed levels of arsenic to {{the distance of the}} place of residence up to a distance of more than 30 km from the source of the emissions was studied. On the basis of the results obtained, the most advantageous material for estimation of nonoccupational exposure to arsenic seems to be hair, in spite of some problems with the decontamination procedure involved. Considerable variability among individual arsenic values in the hair makes group examination a necessity. Hearing changes were analyzed in a group of 56 10 -year old children residing near a power plant burning local coal of high arsenic content. The results of both audiometric and clinical examination were compared with those of control group numbering 51 children of the same age living outside the polluted area.

40|$|Objective: Aim of {{this study}} was to show the effects of {{rheumatoid}} arthritis (RA) on auditory system using pure tone audiometer and tympanometric assessments and to compare these values with healthy controls. Methods: This study included 107 subjects: 57 RA pa­tients who were being followed at our clinic with a RA diagnosis and 50 healthy controls who had similar age and gender properties. Besides clinical and laboratory findings audiometric, and tympanometric tests and sta­pes reflex measurements were compared for all patients. Results: Results {{of this study}} showed statistically signifi­cant differences in air conduction thresholds at 0. 5, 1, 2, 4, and 6 kHz frequencies between RA patients and con­trols. In RA patients, bone conduction was affected only at 4 kHz and more in left ear. Additionally, air-bone conduc­tion differences were significant except at 2 kHz. Although air-bone conduction difference was higher in the study group than the control group, this was not statistically sig­nificant. Similarly no significant difference was detected in stapes reflex and tympanometric measurements between RA patients and healthy controls statistically.

The results were correlated with markers of disease activity and response to therapy. ResultsHigh frequency audiometry was performed in 117 female patients aged from 19 to 65 years. Sensorineural <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> was observed at a sensitivity of pure tones from 125 to 8000 Hz in 43. 59 %, a tone threshold of 10, 000 to 16, 000 Hz in 94. 02 % patients in the right ear and in 95. 73 % in the left ear.

50|$|A {{complete}} hearing evaluation involves {{several other}} tests as well. In {{order to determine}} what kind of <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> is present, a bone <b>conduction</b> <b>hearing</b> test is administered. In this test, a vibrating tuning fork is placed behind the ear, on the mastoid process. When the patient can no longer feel/hear the vibration, the tuning fork is held {{in front of the}} ear; the patient should once more be able to hear a ringing sound. If they cannot, there is conductive <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> in that ear. Additionally, the tuning fork is placed on the forehead. The patient is then asked if the sound is localised in the centre of the head or whether it is louder in either ear. If there is conductive <b>hearing</b> <b>loss,</b> {{it is likely to be}} louder in the affected ear; if there is sensorineural <b>hearing</b> <b>loss,</b> it will be quieter in the affected ear. This test helps the audiologist determine whether the <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> is conductive (caused by problems in the outer or middle ear) or sensorineural (caused by problems in the cochlea, the sensory organ of hearing) or neural - caused by a problem in the auditory nerve or auditory pathways/cortex of the brain.|$|R

40|$|Background: Noise {{exposure}} {{is a well-known}} contributor to work-related <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> Recent biological evidence suggests that exposure to ototoxic chemicals such as organic solvents and heavy metals may be additional contributors to <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> However, in industrial settings, {{it is difficult to}} determine the risks of <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> due to these chemicals in workplaces accompanied by excessive noise exposure. A few studies suggest that the effect of noise may be enhanced by ototoxic chemicals. Therefore, this study investigated whether co-exposure to organic solvents and/or heavy metals in the workplace modifies the risk of noise exposure on <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> in a background of excessive noise. Methods: We examined 30, 072 workers nationwide in a wide range of industries from the Korea National Occupational Health Surveillance 2009. Data on industry-based exposure (e. g., occupational noise, heavy metals, and organic solvents) and subject-specific health outcomes (e. g., audiometric examination) were collected. Noise was measured as the daily 8 -h time-weighted average level. Air <b>conduction</b> <b>hearing</b> thresholds were measured from 0. 5 to 6 kHz, and pure-tone averages (PTA) (i. e., means of 2, 3, and 4 kHz) were computed. Results: In the multivariate linear model, PTA increment with occupational noise were 1. 64 -fold and 2. 15 -fold higher in individuals exposed to heavy metals and organic solvents than in unexposed individuals, respectively. Conclusion: This study provides nationwide evidence that co-exposure to heavy metals and/or organic solvents ma...|$|R
40|$|Patients {{with large}} {{conductive}} <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> {{do not always}} tolerate conventional air conduction or bone <b>conduction</b> <b>hearing</b> aids. They can be helped sometimes with an implantable bone conductor device. The so-called bone-anchored hearing aid consists of an implantable titanium skull screw and an external sound processor unit. In this study, we report our experiences with 10 subjects who have been implanted with the recently improved Audiant screw-type XA-II and their experience with the newly developed behind-the-ear (BTE) external processor, the at-the-ear processor and the body-level device with a new transducer with variable magnetic strength. Evaluation shows that the Audiant XA-II system is well accepted and does not show any tissue reaction. The BTE processor is an important new complement to the Audiant system. Furthermore, the system is effective in compensating the air-bone gap almost completely at the higher frequencies but only partially at the lower ones. The maximum output appears to limit its feasibility for perceptive losses beyond 20 dB (PTA). When this system is utilized for proper <b>hearing</b> <b>loss,</b> however, the system usually improves speech intelligibility both in quiet and in background noise. When the system is prescribed for <b>hearing</b> <b>losses</b> with a moderate or large perceptive component, the system is ineffective and leads to negative evaluation...|$|R
50|$|The Weber test {{is a quick}} {{screening}} test for hearing. It can detect unilateral (one-sided) conductive <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> (middle ear <b>hearing</b> <b>loss)</b> and unilateral sensorineural <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> (inner ear <b>hearing</b> <b>loss).</b> The test is named after Ernst Heinrich Weber (1795-1878). Conductive hearing ability is mediated by the middle ear composed of the ossicles: incus, malleus, stapes. Sensorineural hearing ability is mediated by the inner ear composed of the cochlea with its internal basilar membrane and attached cochlear nerve (cranial nerve VIII). The outer ear consisting of the pinna, ear canal, and ear drum or tympanic membrane transmits sounds to the middle ear but does {{not contribute to the}} <b>conduction</b> or sensorineural <b>hearing</b> ability save for hearing transmissions limited by cerumen impaction (wax collection in the ear canal).|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{potential}} {{demand for}} hearing aids is increasing {{in accordance with}} aging of populations in many developed countries. Because certain patients cannot use air <b>conduction</b> <b>hearing</b> aids, they usually use bone <b>conduction</b> <b>hearing</b> aids. However, bone does not transmit sound as efficiently as air, and bone <b>conduction</b> <b>hearing</b> aids require surgery (bone anchored hearing aid) or great pressure to the skull. The first {{purpose of this study}} is to examine the efficacy of a new sound conduction pathway via the cartilage. The second purpose is to develop a hearing aid with a cartilage conduction transducer for patients who cannot use regular air <b>conduction</b> <b>hearing</b> aids. Design/methodology/approach: We examined the hearing ability of a patient with atresia of both external auditory meatuses via three kinds of conduction pathways (air, bone, and cartilage). After the best position for the cartilage conduction transducer was found, audiometric evaluation was performed for his left ear with an insertion earphone (air conduction), a bone conduction transducer, and a cartilage conduction transducer. Then we made a new hearing aid using cartilage conduction and got subjective data from the patients. Findings: The tragal cartilage was the best position for the cartilage conduction transducer. The patient’s mean hearing levels were 58. 3 dBHL, 6. 7 dBHL, and 3. 3 dBHL for air conduction, bone conduction, and cartilage <b>conduction</b> respectively. The <b>hearing</b> ability of the patients obtained from the cartilage <b>conduction</b> <b>hearing</b> aid was comparable to those from the bone <b>conduction</b> <b>hearing</b> aid. Practical implications: Hearing levels using cartilage conduction are very similar to those via bone <b>conduction.</b> Cartilage <b>conduction</b> <b>hearing</b> aids may overcome the practical disadvantages of bone <b>conduction</b> <b>hearing</b> aids such as pain and the need for surgery. Originality/value: We have clarified the efficacy of the cartilage conduction pathway and developed a prototype ‘cartilage <b>conduction</b> <b>hearing</b> aid’, which is the first hearing aid to use sound transmission via cartilage...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: The bone-anchored {{hearing aid}} (BAHA) is a bone <b>conduction</b> <b>hearing</b> device that transmits sound {{directly}} into the inner ear. It is mainly used in patients with conductive <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> associated with aural atresia, {{but it is also}} used in those with mixed and sensorineural <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> Goals: To review the main indications for BAHA, to analyze the audiometric results and its benefits for patients and compare them with other treatment modalities, and to compare the literature data with our sample of 13 patients. Method: The research was performed using a database covering works in English, Spanish, and Portuguese, with no limitations in the years when the procedures were performed. We compared the literature data with our results for the 13 patients who underwent BAHA implantation between the years 2000 and 2009. Results: Most of the studies showed that BAHA has great advantages over reconstructive surgery in terms of hearing results, complications, and disease recurrence. The postoperative results for our 13 patients were satisfactory and comparable with the results from the literature, with closure of the air-bone gap in 7 patients and achieving an air-bone gap of 10 dB in 6 patients. No postoperative complications were observed. Conclusion: BAHA is a better treatment option than reconstructive surgery for patients with bilateral deafness. It is a relatively simple surgical procedure with few complications and good hearing results. Recent studies have examined its use in conductive and unilateral sensorineural <b>hearing</b> <b>loss...</b>|$|R

Traumatic pneumolabyrinth is a relatively rare entity. We report {{the case of a}} unilaterally deaf woman with pneumolabyrinth who had suffered penetrating injury 15 years ago. This past history indicated that the case was late pneumolabyrinth occurring from undiagnosed old posttraumatic perilymphatic fistula. In Japan, most cases of traumatic pneumolabyrinth are caused by penetrating injury with an ear pick. Dizziness often improves within several months. Immediate surgical intervention is recommended for <b>hearing</b> <b>loss,</b> but the <b>hearing</b> outcome is not satisfactory. An appropriate strategy should be selected based on the interval to surgery, bone <b>conduction</b> <b>hearing</b> level at disease onset, stapes lesions, and location of air. 1...|$|R
