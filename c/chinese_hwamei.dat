50|$|The Taiwan hwamei (Garrulax taewanus) is a {{passerine}} bird in {{the family}} Leiothrichidae. It is endemic to the island of Taiwan. It was formerly regarded as a subspecies of the <b>Chinese</b> <b>hwamei</b> (Garrulax canorus) but has recently been split as a separate species. It is estimated to have diverged from the <b>Chinese</b> <b>hwamei</b> about 1.5 million years ago.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Chinese</b> <b>hwamei</b> was {{introduced}} to Taiwan in large numbers in the 1980s and hybridization with the native Taiwan hwamei is occurring which may threaten the genetic uniqueness of the latter form.|$|E
50|$|It has two subspecies: G. c. canorus, {{native to}} {{mainland}} Asia, and G. c. owstoni of Hainan Island. The Taiwan hwamei (Leucodioptron taewanum) was formerly {{considered to be}} a subspecies of the <b>Chinese</b> <b>hwamei</b> but has recently been split as a separate species. Based on a study of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene, Li et al. (2006) suggested that the two species diverged about 1.5 million years ago with the two <b>Chinese</b> <b>hwamei</b> subspecies diverging about 600,000 years ago. The two were formerly placed in the genus Garrulax with the other laughingthrushes but have recently been moved to a new genus Leucodioptron.|$|E
50|$|The {{catchment}} {{forests are}} habitats for avian {{species such as}} crested bulbul, <b>Chinese</b> bulbul, <b>hwamei,</b> Oriental magpie robin, Chinese francolin, Japanese quail, common kingfisher, European magpie, crested myna and crows. Also dwelling in woodlands are mammals like Malayan porcupine, Chinese pangolin, masked palm civet, leopard cat and common muntjac.|$|R
50|$|It has {{a declining}} {{population}} of 1-10,000 individuals and {{is classified as}} a Near Threatened species by BirdLife International. Habitat loss may affect its numbers but the main threat is hybridization with introduced populations of the <b>Chinese</b> <b>hwamei.</b>|$|E
50|$|It {{is about}} 24 {{centimetres}} long. It is mainly grey-brown with heavy streaks on the crown, nape {{and back and}} fine streaks on much of the underparts. It lacks the white eye-markings of the <b>Chinese</b> <b>hwamei</b> which is also more rufous in colour and less heavily streaked. The whistling song is long, melodious and varied.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Chinese</b> <b>hwamei</b> or {{melodious laughingthrush}} (Garrulax canorus) is a {{passerine}} bird of eastern Asia {{in the family}} Leiothrichidae. The name [...] "hwamei" [...] comes from the Chinese 画眉 (huà-méi) and means [...] "painted eyebrow" [...] referring to the distinctive marking around the bird's eyes. The species is a popular cagebird because of its attractive song.|$|E
50|$|There {{is a small}} {{population}} of red-billed blue magpies that has been introduced to Wuling Farm in Taichung County (now part of Taichung City). In 2007, three hybrid chicks were found in a nest in Taichung, with red-billed and Taiwan magpie parents tending them. This caused some concern to conservationists, given {{the decline of the}} Taiwan hwamei due to the invasion of the <b>Chinese</b> <b>hwamei.</b> However, the Endemic Species Research Institute of Taiwan has been working to control red-billed magpie populations by capturing individual birds and relocating their nests.|$|E
40|$|Due to {{concerns}} that wild birds could possibly spread H 5 N 1 viruses, surveillance {{was conducted to}} monitor the types of avian influenza viruses circulating among the wild birds migrating to or inhabiting in northern Vietnam from 2006 to 2009. An H 5 N 2 virus isolated from a Eurasian woodcock had a close phylogenetic relationship to H 5 viruses recently isolated in South Korea and Japan, suggesting that H 5 N 2 has been shared between Vietnam, South Korea, and Japan. An H 9 N 2 virus isolated from a <b>Chinese</b> <b>Hwamei</b> was closely related to two H 9 N 2 viruses that were isolated from humans in Hong Kong in 2009, suggesting that an H 9 N 2 strain relevant to the human isolates had been transmitted to and maintained among the wild bird population in Vietnam and South China. The results {{support the idea that}} wild bird species {{play a significant role in}} the spread and maintenance of avian influenza and that this also occurs in Vietnam...|$|E
