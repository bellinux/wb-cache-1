By 1924, the laboratory's staff grew to 75 skilled employees, who engaged in tests and experiments, not only to develop new uses for petroleum, but to improve existing processes. In 1938 the refinery constructed a new Hydro Plant for the production of synthetic aviation gasoline.

30|$|Better {{understanding}} of the mechanisms of the pyrolysis of hydrocarbons would be of great economic importance, when one considers the costs of petrochemical plants. Secondly, mechanistic models {{can be used to}} optimize thermal <b>cracking</b> <b>operations</b> and in reducing costly and time-consuming experimental programs [1, 27]. Mechanistic modeling is widely used thanks to the availability of fast computers. Though it is initially more expensive and time-consuming, its long term advantage is important; once it is developed, it is no longer necessary to employ an expensive pilot plant [28]. Furthermore, mechanistic models account extensively for free radical reactions, which play very significant roles in hydrocarbon pyrolysis. In addition, the pyrolysis of hydrocarbons under industrial conditions occurs at high conversions where secondary reactions of radicals predominate. Mechanistic models have been used mainly in the pyrolysis of hydrocarbons at low conversions [29, 30, 31]. There were few applications at high conversions before and in the early 1980 s [5, 32, 33]. Also, most of the mechanistic modeling studies up to the late 1980 s were on light hydrocarbons and there were few reported studies on the modeling of medium and heavy hydrocarbons pyrolysis [31, 34, 35].|$|E

The materials MCM- 22 and its precursor, MCM- 22 (P), were characterized by means of X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetry and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The diffractions of the precursor MCM- 22 (P) presented typical peaks of the MWW topology, comprising intercalated lamellar layers with organic molecules that are constituents of the template (HMI). According to the XRD pattern of the calcinated sample, no peaks related to the organic material which is the precursor of the MCM- 22 zeolite were detected. By thermogravimetry it was verified that the removal of the template took place between 500 and 650 °C, thus proving the effectiveness of the removal process. According to the FTIR analysis it was possible to confirm the presence of tetrahedra vibrations that confirm the typical internal and external bands of these kinds of materials. Moreover, it was possible to obtain the MCM- 22 zeolite as a crystalline and pure material by static synthesis...|$|E

Occurrence of such event can result in firing and explosion and consequently would bring about some risks to the environment affected. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess environmental risks in Olefin Plant, Arya Sasol Petrochemical Company in order to identify environmental risks at producing source. Methods: The basic data was gathered through using the results of monitoring and measurement of ambient air pollutants and stack exhaust gases, safety review method and field observation. For determination the effects of hydrocarbons leakage from equipment on the environment, measuring BTEX in ambient air was performed as per EPA 0030 Standard method with using Gas Chromatography at 4 stations of the complex and a portable Testo 350 XL device was used for monitoring stack exhaust gases, from 9 stacks from May 2011 to April 2012. Assessment and risk management tool used in this study was the fault tree analysis method. The main part of the risk assessment in fault tree method is selecting a top event. According to the statistics of accidents and environmental aspects of ethane <b>cracking</b> <b>operations,</b> hydrocarbon leakage is detected as top event and then composition and relationship between risk factors is determined in the form of terminal event, intermediate event and the gate “and” and “or”. With qualitative and quantitative analysis of fault tree of this accident, the main causes of the accident and the likelihood of the top event was calculated for a year. Results: Comparing with other stations, it was found that benzene with concentration of 0. 37 mg/m 3 in autumn, toluene with concentration of 0. 13 mg/m 3 in spring, and ethyl benzene with concentration of 0. 09 mg/m 3 in autumn, and xylene with the concentration of 1. 01 mg/m 3 in autumn season had the highest concentration. The fault tree developed had 16 events (including final, intermediate, and initial), which were connected to each other with seven logic gates. The maximum error percentage in the terminal events was attributed to the hardware failures such as malfunction in equipment with 55. 55 percent followed by human and administrative errors in the next ranking. The highest percentage (22. 2 %) of the terminal events was related to the gasket unsuitable material; the main reason is due to the economic sanctions and the lack of effort to provide high quality products. Conclusion: Most likely occurrence of the final event was related to the gasket unsuitable material (2 × 10 - 2). Control action to prevent the occurrence of leakage could be supplying high quality gaskets and the failure is classified in the hardware failure category...|$|E

The best kinetic parameters of the relevant reactions have been evaluated employing the optimization technique depending upon the experimental results taken from literature. The optimal operating conditions (mainly, reaction temp (T), catalyst-to-oil ratio (CTO) and weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) on the product composition were investigated and the optimal kinetic parameters obtained from the pilot plant scale were used to develop an industrial fluidized catalytic cracking process. The optimal operating conditions based on maximum conversion of vacuum gas oil with minimum cost in addition to maximizing the octane number of gasoline and coke content deposited on the catalyst within the regenerator, have also been studied.
