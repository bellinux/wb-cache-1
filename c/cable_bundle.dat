50|$|The ISO/IEC TR 29125 and Cenelec EN 50174-99-1 draft {{standards}} {{outline the}} <b>cable</b> <b>bundle</b> temperature rise {{that can be}} expected {{from the use of}} 4PPoE. A distinction is made between two scenarios: 1.) bundles heating up from the inside to the outside, and 2.) bundles heating up from the outside to match the ambient temperature. The second scenario largely depends on the way that the <b>cable</b> <b>bundle</b> has been installed, whereas the first is solely influenced by the physical make-up of the cable. In a standard U/UTP cable, the PoE-related temperature rise increases by a factor of 5. In a shielded cable, this value drops to between 2.5 and 3, depending on the design. Put another way, the temperature increases by twice as much in a U/UTP <b>cable</b> <b>bundle</b> than in a comparable bundle of S/FTP cables.|$|E
5000|$|Ferrite sheath current filters {{consist of}} a ferrite sleeve around the line or <b>cable</b> <b>bundle.</b> These are common mode chokes, damping {{high-frequency}} common-mode noise on cables.|$|E
50|$|Ferrite sheath current filters {{can only}} work {{effectively}} if a common-mode signal can flow on a line. This is generally {{the case when}} a <b>cable</b> <b>bundle</b> or a coaxial cable has a ground connection at both ends to the grounded equipment.|$|E
40|$|This {{validation}} study examines {{the effect on}} vibroacoustic response resulting from the installation of <b>cable</b> <b>bundles</b> on a curved orthogrid panel. Of interest {{is the level of}} damping provided by the installation of the <b>cable</b> <b>bundles</b> and whether this damping could be potentially leveraged in launch vehicle design. The results of this test are compared with baseline acoustic response tests without cables. Damping estimates from the measured response data are made using a new software tool that leverages a finite element model of the panel in conjunction with advanced optimization techniques. While the full test series is not yet complete, the first configuration of <b>cable</b> <b>bundles</b> that was assessed effectively increased the viscous critical damping fraction of the system by as much as 0. 02 in certain frequency ranges...|$|R
50|$|In {{the midst}} of the 1920s, coax was applied to {{telephone}} networks as inter-office trunks. Rather than adding more copper <b>cable</b> <b>bundles</b> with 1500 or 1000 pairs of copper wire and cable in them, it was possible to replace those big cables with much smaller coaxial cable.|$|R
30|$|Together {{with this}} {{motivation}} to substitute {{at least part}} of the vehicle’s <b>cable</b> <b>bundles</b> by wireless links, a wireless localization service within the vehicle is desirable. Future applications of such a localization service include remote keyless entry and ignition systems, advanced child passenger safety, and beamsteering for in-vehicle high-speed Internet access.|$|R
5000|$|For a <b>cable</b> <b>bundle</b> {{between two}} devices but {{grounded}} at only one device, in general a ferrite sheath current filter is not effective. With such an arrangement, a ferrite bead {{would only be}} effective to reduce sheath current standing waves. When used to eliminate standing waves, the ferrite sheath current filter must be placed at a current antinode, but not at standing wave nodes.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} cable tie {{consists}} of a flexible nylon tape with an integrated gear rack, and on one end a ratchet within a small open case. Once the pointed tip of the cable tie has been pulled through the case and past the ratchet, it {{is prevented from being}} pulled back; the resulting loop may only be pulled tighter. This allows several cables to be bound together into a <b>cable</b> <b>bundle</b> and/or to form a cable tree.|$|E
5000|$|An {{installation}} {{that meets}} listing and approval use and compliance usually requires pillow coverage between cables. The {{type and size}} of the pillows used must be matched to the exact cabling per the certification listing. Smoke will migrate through the interior of a <b>cable</b> <b>bundle</b> if the bundle is not opened up and sealed on the inside during the installation of any firestop, regardless of whether the firestop is intumescent or not. If mesh is used, mechanical fasteners are required, potentially negating the perceived benefits of fast installation and [...] "re-enterability" [...] that is typically purported to be provided by this technology.|$|E

It launched the Tyton system, a method for <b>cable</b> <b>bundling</b> in continuous system, in 1965 and established HellermannTyton Corporation in Milwaukee in 1969. Then in 1976 it expanded into the aviation market, offering cable management solutions for airplanes.|$|R
50|$|A major design goal in StarLAN was {{reduction}} in Ethernet installation costs by the reuse of existing telephone on-premises wiring and compatibility with analog and digital telephone signals {{in the same}} <b>cable</b> <b>bundle.</b> The signal modulation and wire pairing used by StarLAN were carefully chosen {{so that they would}} not affect or be affected by either the analog signal of a normal call, on hook and off hook transients, or the 20 Hz high-voltage analog ring signal. Reuse of existing wires was critical in many buildings where rewiring was cost prohibitive, where running new wire would disturb asbestos within the building infrastructure, and where the bus topology of coaxial bus Ethernet was not installable.|$|E
50|$|Researchers {{studying}} {{the transmission of}} multiple signals over different wires in the same <b>cable</b> <b>bundle</b> helped create a theoretical foundation for 4G MIMO. Specifically, techniques for cancelling the effects of crosstalk using knowledge of the source signals were investigated. The “wireline MIMO” researchers included Lane H. Brandenburg and Aaron D. Wyner (1974),Wim van Etten (1970s), Jack Salz (1985), and Alexandra Duel-Hallen (1992). Though optimizing the transmission of multiple data streams over different wire pairs in the same bundle requires compensating for crosstalk, the transmission of multiple data streams over different wireless paths due to multipath propagation is a far greater challenge because the signals become mixed up in time, space, and frequency.|$|E
5000|$|The {{earliest}} {{video cameras}} were mechanical flying-spot scanners {{which were in}} use in the 1920s and 1930s {{during the period of}} mechanical television. Improvements in video camera tubes in the 1930s ushered in the era of electronic television. Earlier, cameras were very large devices, almost always in two sections. The camera section held the lens and tube pre-amplifiers and other necessary electronics, and was connected to a large diameter multicore cable to the remainder of the camera electronics, usually mounted in a separate room in the studio, or a remote truck. The camera head could not generate a video picture signal on its own. The video signal was output to the studio for switching and transmission. By the fifties, electronic miniaturization had progressed to the point where some monochrome cameras could operate stand alone and even be handheld. But the studio configuration remained, with the large <b>cable</b> <b>bundle</b> transmitting the signals back to the camera control unit (CCU). The CCU in turn was used to align and operate the camera's functions, such as exposure, system timing, video and black levels.The first color cameras (1950s in the US, early 1960s in Europe), notably the RCA TK-40/41 series, were much more complex with their three (and in some models four) pickup tubes, and their size and weight drastically increased. Handheld color cameras did not come into general use until the early 1970s - the first generation of cameras were split into a camera head unit (the body of the camera, containing the lens and pickup tubes, and held on the shoulder or a body brace in front of the operator) connected via a <b>cable</b> <b>bundle</b> to a backpack CCU. The Ikegami HL-33, the RCA TK45 and the Thomson Microcam were portable two piece color cameras introduced in the early 1970s. For field work a separate VTR was still required to record the camera's video output. Typically this was either a portable 1" [...] reel to reel VTR, or a portable 3/4" [...] U-matic VCR. Typically, the two camera units would be carried by the camera operator, while a tape operator would carry the portable recorder. With the introduction of the RCA TK76 in 1976, camera operators were finally able to carry on their shoulders a one piece camera containing all the electronics to output a broadcast quality composite video signal. A separate videotape recording unit was still required.|$|E

50|$|Passive {{speakers}} {{need only}} one speaker cable but active speakers need two cables: an audio signal cable and an AC power cable. For multiple-enclosure high-power concert systems, the AC cabling is often smaller in diameter than the equivalent speaker <b>cable</b> <b>bundles,</b> so less copper is used. Some powered speaker manufacturers are now incorporating UHF or more frequently Wi-Fi wireless receivers so the speaker requires only an AC power cable.|$|R

40|$|To better {{utilize the}} {{capacity}} of the twisted-pair access networks, operators deploying very high-speed digital subscriber line (VDSL) systems need accurate parameters for power back-off (PBO). However, VDSL standards give almost no guidance on how these parameters should be established for a particular network. In this paper we present a new technique for optimizing PBO parameters for a <b>cable</b> <b>bundle,</b> which is based on the Nelder–Mead simplex search algorithm. In this way each operator can easily calculate PBO parameters that match its actual access network down to the individual <b>cable</b> <b>bundle.</b> Using the properties of the PBO, as defined in the VDSL standard, we show how a normalized FEXT coupling can replace the knowledge of the individual couplings during the optimization of the PBO parameters. By simulations based on measured cable data we show that our approach using <b>cable</b> <b>bundle</b> unique PBO (CUPBO) achieves a significant improvements compared to the performance achieved with the ordinary PBO. 1.
