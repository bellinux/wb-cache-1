5|$|Like all catalysts, enzymes {{increase}} the reaction rate by lowering its activation energy. Some enzymes <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>their</b> conversion of substrate to product occur {{many millions of}} times faster. An extreme example is orotidine 5'-phosphate decarboxylase, which allows a reaction that would otherwise take millions of years to occur in milliseconds. Chemically, enzymes are like any catalyst and are not consumed in chemical reactions, nor do they alter the equilibrium of a reaction. Enzymes differ from most other catalysts by being much more specific. Enzyme activity can be affected by other molecules: inhibitors are molecules that decrease enzyme activity, and activators are molecules that increase activity. Many therapeutic drugs and poisons are enzyme inhibitors. An enzyme's activity decreases markedly outside its optimal temperature and pH.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the anxiety and fear that typically accompanies OCD, sufferers may spend hours performing such compulsions every day. In such situations, {{it can be hard}} for the person to fulfil their work, family or social roles. In some cases, these behaviors can also cause adverse physical symptoms. For example, people who obsessively wash their hands with antibacterial soap and hot water <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>their</b> skin red and raw with dermatitis.|$|E
25|$|Scurvy {{does not}} occur in most animals as they <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>their</b> own vitamin C. However, humans and other higher {{primates}} (the simians—monkeys and apes—and tarsiers), guinea pigs, most or all bats, and some species of birds and fish lack an enzyme (L-gulonolactone oxidase) necessary for such synthesis and must obtain vitamin C through their diet. The gene for L-gulonolactone oxidase is still present in the human genome, but deactivated by DNA mutations.|$|E

Inviting them into his emporium, Facilier convinces them that he <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>their</b> dreams come true, but neither man gets what they are expecting; Naveen is {{transformed}} into a frog, while Lawrence is given a voodoo charm that makes him resemble Naveen. Facilier intends for Lawrence to marry Charlotte, after which he will kill Big Daddy and claim his fortune.|$|E
25|$|The game {{incorporates}} a player-controlled camera {{system that can}} be rotated and zoomed at will; this allows the player to view the world from above, from the ground, or anywhere in between. Combat units (both ground units and aircraft) have inertia incorporated into their physics programming, although it lacks polygon-level collision detection for every object. The player <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>their</b> units to move anywhere in the map, given that Fire and Darkness is not designed using a grid-like system like other contemporary games such as Warcraft II.|$|E

25|$|Campbell River {{enjoys a}} Warm-summer Mediterranean Climate (Köppen Climate Classification) Csb. With {{temperatures}} usually between -2°C (28°F) and 23°C (73°F) year-round. The most precipitation {{is measured in}} November, at 231 millimeters (9in) on average. While January sees the most average snow, 152 millimeters (6in), only 10 millimeters (3/8in) will be seen actually accumulating. In the winter months occasional Arctic bursts from the interior of British Columbia <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>their</b> way onto the coast bringing temperatures below zero. If a Pacific low reaches the coast a large snowfall can occur. Snowfalls in excess of 45 centimetres (16in) have been recorded in a 24-hour period and the greatest snowfall was 53.3 centimetres (1ft,9in) in 1978.|$|E
25|$|Driven to near madness, Bane {{decides to}} lead the Secret Six to Gotham {{in an attempt to}} psychologically break Batman by killing several of his closest allies. The team kidnaps the Penguin, who Bane pumps for {{information}} about Batman's partners. In the final issue of the series, Bane ultimately decides on Red Robin, Azrael and Batgirl as his victims. Before the Six <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>their</b> move, Penguin betrays their location, resulting in a massive army of superheroes ranging from Green Lantern, Batman and the Superman family to the Justice League, Birds of Prey, and Booster Gold converging on Gotham. The Secret Six stage a desperate last stand, but are quickly defeated. With the fates of the other Secret Six members left ambiguous, Bane is last shown being driven away in a Gotham police van. The ending of the issue implies that he plans to escape.|$|E
25|$|The {{client-side}} (Web browser) technologies used in Web 2.0 development include Ajax and JavaScript frameworks. Ajax programming uses JavaScript and the Document Object Model {{to update}} selected {{regions of the}} page area without undergoing a full page reload. To allow users to continue {{to interact with the}} page, communications such as data requests going to the server are separated from data coming back to the page (asynchronously). Otherwise, the user would have to routinely wait for the data to come back before they can do anything else on that page, just as a user has to wait for a page to complete the reload. This also increases overall performance of the site, as the sending of requests can complete quicker independent of blocking and queueing required to send data back to the client. The data fetched by an Ajax request is typically formatted in XML or JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format, two widely used structured data formats. Since both of these formats are natively understood by JavaScript, a programmer can easily use them to transmit structured data in their Web application. When this data is received via Ajax, the JavaScript program then uses the Document Object Model (DOM) to dynamically update the Web page based on the new data, allowing for a rapid and interactive user experience. In short, using these techniques, Web designers <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>their</b> pages function like desktop applications. For example, Google Docs uses this technique to create a Web-based word processor.|$|E

500|$|Suicide by fire {{is another}} common theme in Vonnegut's works; the author often {{returns to the}} theory that [...] "many people are not fond of life." [...] He uses this as an {{explanation}} for why humans have so severely damaged their environments, and made devices such as nuclear weapons that <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>their</b> creators extinct. In Deadeye Dick, Vonnegut features the neutron bomb, designed to kill people, but leave buildings and structures untouched. He also uses this theme to demonstrate the recklessness of those who put powerful, apocalypse-inducing devices {{at the disposal of}} politicians.|$|E
500|$|A doctor prescribes Prozac, a {{real life}} antidepressant, to Kyle for his {{apparent}} love for feces, which he describes as [...] "fecalphilia", a condition perhaps better known by the medical term coprophilia. Composer Philip Glass composes the avant-garde musical score for the non-denominational Christmas play. Stone and Parker both strongly dislike Glass; Parker, who was a music major in college, said, [...] "I really thought you could basically tell a third grader {{to sit down at}} a keyboard and mess around and sell it as a Philip Glass album, and no one would know the difference."

[...] In 2012 the auditorium was named Paul O’Regan Hall following a $1 million donation by the O’Regan family in honour of the late businessman and philanthropist. Government funding only covered the cost of the building, so donations will go toward expanding the book collection and purchasing new computers and special equipment. The hall is fitted with stowable seats, acoustic ceiling baffles, a video screen, and professional sound and lighting installations.|$|E

500|$|Jack {{is worried}} when his girlfriend C.C., the Democratic congresswoman {{for the state}} of Vermont, tells him that she wants to go public with their relationship. The pair had been {{avoiding}} this because C.C. is suing the Sheinhardt Wig Company, the fictional parent company of NBC. During their secret relationship, Jack and C.C. had been sneaking to each other's house in disguises, including C.C. as a plumber named Mr. Spoonatelli. C.C. confides in Liz (after she finds out about their relationship), and Jack confides in political consultant James Carville, who gives Jack advice on how two important people from opposite political positions <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>their</b> relationship work [...] "Cajun style," [...] without regard for how others perceive them. Eventually, Jack takes C.C. to dinner in the GE executive dining room where he reveals his relationship to the other executives, leading to the other executives making some bizarre revelations of their own.|$|E
500|$|... "Secrets" [...] {{attracted}} {{criticism from}} political commentators for its [...] "potentially misleading perception" [...] of emergency contraception. Shawn Rhea of Planned Parenthood cited that the morning-after pills do not induce abortion, as the episode implies. Erin Gloria Ryan of Jezebel wrote: [...] "Lori {{would have been}} better off sending the men off to loot a shop that sells herbal remedies and brewing herself some pennyroyal tea or climbing a tree and jumping out in hopes that the impact would end the pregnancy. Both of those things are dangerous and might not work, but they're about as effective as OD'ing on levonorgestrel." [...] Ryan prescribed that actual abortion pills are administered by medical professionals and are not available at pharmacies. Danielle Aronson of ACLU summated that the effectiveness of terminating a pregnancy with emergency contraception would be equivalent to [...] "cutting a zombie's finger off to kill it." [...] Similarly, Slate Amanda Marcotte opined: [...] "The problem with this storyline, outside the tedious fear of getting letters from irate anti-choicers that dictates TV's near-absolute approach to unintended pregnancy, is simple: Morning-after pills are not abortion." [...] Marcotte asserted that abortion pills, commonly RU-486, were only provided by medical personnel.
