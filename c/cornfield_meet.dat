5000|$|Proco {{manages to}} pass {{the first part of}} the final test, an oral exam {{conducted}} by Lyman Vunk and the teachers, and must now pass the second part, whereupon all the candidates will be made to run a Busterburger for one day. Drootin makes sure Proco and everyone fails by first getting an [...] "eating club" [...] of obese people to the Busterburger, who will probably exhaust all the food reserves. Proco uses explosive means to get rid of them, then Drootin hijacks the drive thru intercom to insult a black motorcycle policeman's race and profession, who drives off enraged as he was simply trying to grab lunch at Busterburger. A biker girl makes a pass at Proco, who rebuffs it but is misconstrued by her boyfriend, who gets his gang to smash up the restaurant. A bunch of black cops arrive, not to arrest the bikers but also to join in due to Drootin's earlier instigation. To top it off, Drootin attempts a <b>cornfield</b> <b>meet</b> with a poultry truck, who swerves into the ruined Busterburger to avoid a car crash. The students are disheartened that they will bilge out, but Proco gives a pep talk that there is no way they cannot handle being franchise owners after these mishaps, himself now having come to accept the responsibility. Lyman Vunk appears, but is oblivious to the carnage, instead noticing one of the burnt chickens is ideal for his proposed new line of chicken sandwiches. Drootin gets demoted to picking up litter when he accidentally smears food on Vunk's suit, and Proco starts a relationship with Mia. The film ends with Proco and his fellow students graduating Buster Burger University, where the funk singer ends the closing ceremony with his version of the company theme song.|$|E
50|$|The villagers {{think this}} yearâ€™s crop will be bountiful. There {{is also good}} work in the growing city of Tlapa an hour away. But the locals are wise {{to a life of}} insecurity, and their {{thoughts}} are often of family members or opportunities far away, north of the border. While working in the <b>cornfields,</b> Pedro <b>meets</b> and begins to mentor a teenager, Leo, who dreams of the US. Leo's love of breakdancing helps him to win over Karla, a studious girl he meets but a folk dancer herself. Their budding first love recalls Pedro's and Teresa's of a generation before.|$|R
50|$|Nathalie runs {{alone to}} the <b>cornfield</b> and <b>meets</b> Tim there, who has their son. The true story is {{revealed}} - Gates had employed Tim as an informer and {{was supposed to}} give him Moha. As Gates {{was one of the}} most corrupt cops in the precinct, Tim was ordered to kill Maha and bring him the drugs and money. Tim slipped some E 605 into the coffee at the diner killing the mafiosi and then shoots the other party when they arrive to make the deal. Nathalie was his last obstacle but, as Tim is about to shoot her, he is shot by his daughter Elisabeth from behind. Nathalie and the children begin a new life.|$|R
50|$|In {{the classic}} 1939 film, a red brick road {{can be seen}} {{starting}} {{at the same point}} as the yellow brick road and is entwined with it, despite seemingly going in a different direction. This version of the road does not exist in Baum's books. Also, at the <b>cornfield</b> where Dorothy <b>meets</b> and befriends the Scarecrow, there is a fork in the yellow brick road leading in different directions. Luckily they choose the correct one of the three branches that leads to Emerald City.|$|R
