25|$|<b>Carbonless</b> {{copy paper}} is an {{alternative}} to carbon paper, {{used to make a}} copy of an original, handwritten document without the use of any electronics. <b>Carbonless</b> copy paper was invented by chemists Lowell Schleicher and Barry Green, working for the NCR Corporation, as a biodegradable, stain-free alternative to carbon paper.|$|E
2500|$|A {{dot matrix}} printer or impact matrix printer refers to a type of {{computer}} printer with a print head that runs {{back and forth on}} the page and prints by impact, striking an ink-soaked cloth ribbon against the paper, much like a typewriter. Unlike a typewriter or daisy wheel printer, letters are drawn out of a dot matrix, and thus, varied fonts and arbitrary graphics can be produced. [...] Because the printing involves mechanical pressure, these printers can create carbon copies and <b>carbonless</b> copies.|$|E
2500|$|Volatile organic {{compounds}} (VOCs) are emitted as gases from certain solids or liquids. VOCs include {{a variety of}} chemicals, {{some of which may}} have short- and long-term adverse health effects. Concentrations of many VOCs are consistently higher indoors (up to ten times higher) than outdoors. [...] VOCs are emitted by a wide array of products numbering in the thousands. Examples include: paints and lacquers, paint strippers, cleaning supplies, pesticides, building materials and furnishings, office equipment such as copiers and printers, correction fluids and <b>carbonless</b> copy paper, graphics and craft materials including glues and adhesives, permanent markers, and photographic solutions.|$|E
2500|$|Use of PCBs is {{commonly}} divided into closed and open applications. Examples of closed applications include coolants and insulating fluids (transformer oil) for transformers and capacitors, {{such as those}} used in old fluorescent light ballasts, hydraulic fluids, lubricating and cutting oils, etc. In contrast, the major open application of PCBs was in <b>carbonless</b> copy ("NCR") paper, which even nowadays results in paper contamination. Other open applications were as plasticizers in paints and cements, stabilizing additives in flexible PVC coatings of electrical cables and electronic components, pesticide extenders, reactive flame retardants and sealants for caulking, adhesives, wood floor finishes, such as Fabulon and other products of Halowax in the U.S., de-dusting agents, waterproofing compounds, casting agents. It was also used as a plasticizer in paints and especially [...] "coal tars" [...] that were used widely to coat water tanks, bridges and other infrastructure pieces.|$|E
2500|$|A polychlorinated {{biphenyl}} (PCB) is an {{organic chlorine compound}} with the formula C12H10−xClx. [...] Polychlorinated biphenyls were once widely deployed as dielectric and coolant fluids in electrical apparatus, <b>carbonless</b> copy paper and in heat transfer fluids. [...] Because of their longevity, PCBs are still widely in use, even though their manufacture has declined drastically since the 1960s, when a host of problems were identified. Because of PCBs' environmental toxicity and classification as a persistent organic pollutant, PCB production was banned by the United States Congress in 1979 and by the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants in 2001. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), rendered PCBs as definite carcinogens in humans. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), PCBs cause cancer in animals and are probable human carcinogens. Many rivers and buildings including schools, parks, and other sites are contaminated with PCBs, {{and there have been}} contaminations of food supplies with the substances.|$|E
2500|$|BisphenolA is a {{preferred}} color developer in <b>carbonless</b> copy paper and thermal {{point of sale}} receipt paper. When used in thermal paper, BPA is present as [...] "free" [...] (i.e., discrete, non-polymerized) BPA, {{which is likely to}} be more available for exposure than BPA polymerized into a resin or plastic. Upon handling, BPA in thermal paper can be transferred to skin, and there is some concern that residues on hands could be ingested through incidental hand-to-mouth contact. Furthermore, some studies suggest that dermal absorption may contribute some small fraction to the overall human exposure. European data indicate that the use of BPA in paper may also contribute to the presence of BPA in the stream of recycled paper and in landfills. Although there are no estimates for the amount of BPA used in thermal paper in the United States, in Western Europe, the volume of BPA reported to be used in thermal paper in 2005/2006 was 1,890 tonnes per year, while total production was estimated at 1,150,000 tonnes per year. [...] (Figures taken from 2012 EPA draft paper.) Studies document potential spreading and accumulation of BPA in paper recycling, suggesting its presence for decades in paper recycling loop even after a hypothetical ban. Epoxy resin may or may not contain BPA, and is employed to bind gutta percha in some root canal procedures.|$|E
2500|$|Besides diet, {{exposure}} {{can also}} occur through air and through skin absorption. Free BPA {{is found in}} high concentration in thermal paper and <b>carbonless</b> copy paper, which {{would be expected to}} be more available for exposure than BPA bound into resin or plastic. [...] Popular uses of thermal paper include receipts, event and cinema tickets, labels, and airline tickets. A Swiss study found that 11 of 13 thermal printing papers contained [...] (BPA). Upon dry finger contact with a thermal paper receipt, roughly [...] BPA (...) was transferred to the forefinger and the middle finger. For wet or greasy fingers approximately [...] more was transferred. Extraction of BPA from the fingers was possible up to [...] after exposure. Further, it has been demonstrated that thermal receipts placed in contact with paper currency in a wallet for 24 hours cause a dramatic increase in the concentration of BPA in paper currency, making paper money a secondary source of exposure. Another study has identified BPA in all of the waste paper samples analysed (newspapers, magazines, office paper, etc.), indicating direct results of contamination through paper recycling. [...] Free BPA can readily be transferred to skin, and residues on hands can be ingested. Bodily intake through dermal absorption (99% of which comes from handling receipts) has been shown for the general population to be 0.219ng/kg bw/day (occupationally exposed persons absorb higher amounts at 16.3ng/kg bw/day) whereas aggregate intake (food/beverage/environment) for adults is estimated at 0.36–0.43 μg/kg bw/day (estimated intake for occupationally exposed adults is 0.043–100 μg/kg bw/day).|$|E
50|$|Hayden-McNeil's <b>carbonless</b> lab {{notebooks}} come {{in twelve}} science disciplines. The white <b>carbonless</b> paper creates duplicate sets of all laboratory notes.|$|E
50|$|In a 1997 study, the University of Florida {{found that}} a poorly-ventilated office where large amounts of <b>carbonless</b> copy paper were used had {{significant}} levels of volatile organic compounds present in its air, whereas a well-ventilated office where little such paper was used did not. The {{study also found that}} there were higher rates of sick leave and illness complaints at the office using large amounts of <b>carbonless</b> copy paper. Another study, which was published in Environmental Health Perspectives, connected chronic occupational exposure to paper dust and <b>carbonless</b> copy paper with an increased risk of adult-onset asthma.|$|E
50|$|It {{may cause}} {{allergic}} contact dermatitis in people handling the <b>carbonless</b> copy paper.|$|E
50|$|<b>Carbonless</b> {{copy paper}} was first {{produced}} by the NCR Corporation. Formerly, the options were to write documents more than once or use carbon paper, which was inserted between the sheet being written upon and the copy. <b>Carbonless</b> paper was used as business stationery requiring one or more copies of the original, such as invoices and receipts. The copies were often paper of different colors (e.g. white original for customer, yellow copy for supplier's records, and other colors for subsequent copies). Stationery with <b>carbonless</b> copy paper can be supplied collated either in pads or books bound into sets, or as loose sets, or as continuous stationery for printers designed to use it.|$|E

50|$|The average <b>carbonless</b> {{copy paper}} {{contains}} a {{high concentration of}} Bisphenol A (BPA), an endocrine disruptor.|$|E
50|$|Until the 1970s, {{when the}} use of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) was banned due to health and {{environmental}} concerns, PCBs were used as a transfer agent in <b>carbonless</b> copy paper. PCBs are readily transferred to human skin during handling of such papers, {{and it is difficult}} to achieve decontamination by ordinary washing with soap and water. In Japan, <b>carbonless</b> copy paper is still treated as a PCB-contaminated waste.|$|E
50|$|Because the {{printing}} involves mechanical pressure, {{both of these}} types of printers can create carbon copies and <b>carbonless</b> copies.|$|E
50|$|<b>Carbonless</b> {{copy paper}} was also {{available}} in a self-contained version that had both the ink and the clay {{on the same side}} of the paper.|$|E
50|$|Exposure {{to certain}} types of <b>carbonless</b> copy paper or its {{components}} has resulted, under some conditions, in mild to moderate symptoms of skin irritation and irritation of the mucosal membranes of the eyes and upper respiratory tract. A 2000 review found no irritation or sensitization on contact with <b>carbonless</b> copy paper produced after 1987. In most cases, good industrial hygiene and work practices should be adequate to reduce or eliminate symptoms. These include adequate ventilation, humidity, and temperature controls; proper housekeeping; minimal hand-to-mouth and hand-to-eye contact; and periodic cleansing of hands.|$|E
50|$|In 2001, three {{employees}} {{of a medical}} center in San Francisco {{filed a lawsuit against}} their employer, blaming exposure to <b>carbonless</b> copy paper and other chemicals for their inflammatory breast cancer.|$|E
5000|$|Common {{supplies}} and office equipment items {{before the advent}} of suitably priced word processing machines and PCs in the 1970s and 1980s were: typewriters, slide rules, calculators, adding machines, carbon- and <b>carbonless</b> paper; ...|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} days of <b>carbonless</b> copy paper, arrowroot, because of its fine grain-size, was a widely used ingredient. After an {{economical}} way of centrifugally separating wheat flour was devised, arrowroot lost its role in papermaking.|$|E
5000|$|The kibbutz's main {{income is}} from agriculture, e.g., field crops, orchards, and fish. Nir David Fish Breeding Farms has {{developed}} Tilapia strains with unique properties. The kibbutz's [...] "Nirotek" [...] factory produces self adhesive and <b>carbonless</b> copy paper, and a metal factory exports horticultural vehicles and tools.|$|E
50|$|It was {{the first}} dye used in <b>carbonless</b> copy papers, {{and it is still}} widely used in this application. It is also the leuco dye {{component}} in some thermochromic dyes, e.g. in the Hypercolor line of clothing. One of its novel uses is a security marker for fuels.|$|E
50|$|In 1991, Tjiwi Kimia's PM 9 started {{operation}} {{with an annual}} capacity of 207,000 tons.The following year, Indah Kiat acquired PT Sinar Dunia Makmur, a manufacturer of industrial paper located in Serang with a production capacity of 900 tons/day. Tjiwi Kimia commissioned the <b>Carbonless</b> Paper Plant in March 1993 as an experiment.|$|E
50|$|However, {{almost all}} modern {{computer}} printers also create their output as matrices of dots, but {{use a different}} technology like laser printing or inkjet printing, and are not called dot matrix printers. Impact printers survive where multi-part forms are needed, as the pins can impress dots through multiple layers of paper to make a <b>carbonless</b> copy, for security purposes.|$|E
50|$|APTIS could issue {{receipts}} {{for passengers}} paying by debit card or credit card. These receipts were {{a combination of}} a transparent <b>carbonless</b> copy paper top copy, for the customer; and a backing card, for retention by British Rail. The customer signed the receipt, handed it back; and, in return, was given the signed top copy and the train tickets.|$|E
50|$|Polychlorinated biphenyls {{constitute}} {{a wide array}} of now-banned organic chemicals with a variety of industrial applications. At the Kalamazoo River site, most PCBs are a result of the recycling of <b>carbonless</b> copy paper during the 1970s, the waste products from which were dumped into the river. PCBs were produced from 1929 to 1979, when they were banned by the Toxic Substances Control Act.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Carbonless</b> {{copy paper}} (CCP), non-carbon copy paper, or NCR paper (No Carbon Required, {{taken from the}} {{initials}} of its creator, National Cash Register) {{is a type of}} coated paper designed to transfer information written on the front onto sheets beneath.

50|$|In 1996 Sappi along other 10 main {{producers}} of <b>carbonless</b> paper was {{investigated by the}} European Commission for illegal price fixing in various countries in the EU. Although found guilty of earning millions by fixing the price of printing paper, Sappi was granted full immunity from the fine due to its cooperation with the EC's cartel investigating unit. Other companies implicated were fined a total of $145 million.|$|E
50|$|Scratch and sniff {{technology}} generally {{refers to}} stickers or cardboard items {{that have been}} treated with a fragrant coating. When scratched, the coating releases an odor that is normally related to the image displayed under the coating. The technology has been used {{on a variety of}} surfaces from stickers to compact discs. 3M invented the technology in 1965, using a process originally developed for <b>carbonless</b> copy paper called microencapsulation.|$|E
50|$|The use {{of carbon}} copies {{declined}} {{with the advent}} of photocopying and electronic document creation and distribution (word processing). Carbon copies are still sometimes used in special applications: for example, in manual receipt books which have a multiple-use sheet of carbon paper supplied, so that the user can keep an exact copy of each receipt issued, although even here <b>carbonless</b> copy paper is often used to the same effect.|$|E
50|$|The first dye used commercially in this {{application}} was crystal violet lactone, which {{is widely used}} today. Other dyes and supporting chemicals used are PTSMH (p-toluene sulfinate of Michler's hydrol), TMA (trimellitic anhydride), phenol-formaldehyde resins, azo dyes, DIPN (diisopropyl naphthalenes), formaldehyde isocyanates, hydrocarbon-based solvents, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polyoxypropylene diamine, epoxy resins, aliphatic isocyanates, Bisphenol A, diethylene triamine, and others. The dyes in <b>carbonless</b> copy papers may cause contact dermatitis in sensitive persons.|$|E
50|$|In 1970 the Company was {{acquired}} by BAT Industries {{who went on to}} acquire Appleton Papers of the US in 1978. The business expanded rapidly in the 1980s as it exploited the market in <b>carbonless</b> paper. In 1989 the UK and US paper businesses were demerged from BAT Industries and integrated to form Wiggins Teape Appleton. In 1991 it merged with Arjomari-Prioux of France to form Arjowiggins Appleton. Its distribution business was demerged in 2000 as Antalis.|$|E
