25|$|The Transportation Research Board (TRB), {{an arm of}} the National Academies, {{provides}} a forum for wide dissemination of academic research results related to occupational road safety. Its annual meeting attracts thousands of researchers from around the world, and outstanding papers from the meeting are published in the TRB peer-reviewed journal, the Transportation Research Record. To date, most of the research published through TRB has emphasized truck and bus safety, and this is reflected in the composition of relevant TRB standing committees. TRB also has a series of publications, the <b>Commercial</b> <b>Truck</b> and Bus Safety Synthesis Program, which produces succinct reviews {{of a wide range of}} health and safety topics such as driver wellness, fatigue management, driver selection, and management practices.|$|E

2500|$|Replacing the M880/M890 series, the CUCV {{represented}} General Motors' {{first major}} light-truck military vehicle production since World War II. GM CUCVs were assembled mostly from existing heavy duty light <b>commercial</b> <b>truck</b> parts. The CUCVs came in four basic body styles: pickup, utility, ambulance body and chassis cab. The M1008 was the basic cargo truck, the M1010 was the ambulance, and the M1009 and later year model M1008 ¾-ton utility rig was a Chevrolet K5 Blazer uprated to ¾-ton capacity. With {{the exception of}} the M1009, the trucks were all rated as 1 ton (commonly called a [...] "five-quarter"), even though some of them had payloads in excess of that. There were heavier-duty variants, including the M1028, M1028A1, M1028A2 and M1028A3 shelter carriers (the shelter being a mobile command, communications or intelligence operations enclosure). The M1031 was the chassis cab. These latter trucks were all rated for heavier [...] or [...] loads, compared to the M1008s [...] load capacity. The M1028A2 (converted M1031 or m1028a1) and m1028A3 (converted M1028) models had dual rear wheels. Many M1028s were upgraded at the company level to M1028A2 and A3 specs—the dual wheel rear end arrangement was a result of the M1028 flipping on its side because of the high center of gravity when carrying equipment shelters.|$|E
