50|$|In 2003, Scripto was sued in Illinois court {{after the}} death of three year old Jillian Calles when a fire was started by a sibling using the Aim N Flame lighter. The family claimed the product was {{defective}} because it did not have a <b>child</b> <b>safety</b> <b>device.</b> The trial court dismissed the case saying that Scripto did not violate any laws. The Calles family appealled to the Appellate Court which overruled the trial court's decision. Scripto appealled the Appellate Court's decision, and in 2007 the case made it to the Illinois Supreme Court. Illinois courts used two tests in product safety cases: the Consumer expectations test and the Risk-utility test. The Illinois Supreme Court ruled that the Aim N Flame passed the Consumer Expectation Test but not the Risk-Utility Test. This ruling affirmed the Appellate Court ruling and sent the case back to trial court. In 2010, Scripto settled the suit for $3.5 million.|$|E
40|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1996, the SWOV Institute for Road Safety Research carried out a study into: the {{presence}} of seat belts and child restraint systems; {{the use of these}} devices by passenger car occupants; and into the helmet use by moped riders. This study consisted of investigations done before and after a campaign held in the Dutch province of Flevoland that was intended to stimulate the use of these safety devices. The developments in the actual and asserted behaviour involving the use of safety devices studied are described. The data for the study consisted of: (i) observations made at junctions equipped with traffic regulation installations; and (ii) of a written survey that was held among a percentage of percentage of the motorists, passengers, and moped riders who had been observed. The most significant study results are: (1) the seat belt use by all passenger car occupants increased; (2) the seat belt use inside built-up areas, by both men and women, showed a general increase; (3) the seat belt use outside built-up areas, by both men and women, showed a general increase; (4) the <b>child</b> <b>safety</b> <b>device</b> use has not changed; (5) {{children between the ages of}} five and twelve are not as well protected as younger children; and (6) a slight decrease in the moped helmet use was ascertained...|$|E

40|$|Objective—To {{investigate}} {{the risk of}} bone fracture sustained by obese children exposed to falls. We hypothesized that the bone fracture risk of obese children would be {{greater than that of}} their nonobese counterparts. Design and Methods—We developed finite element-based computational models for children that reflected various levels of obesity by varying body mass and the thickness of the subcutaneous adipose tissue layer. The models took account of both the momentum effect of variation of body mass and the cushion effect of variation of soft tissue thickness and examined these two contradictory effects on pelvic bone fracture risk through a set of sideways fall simulations with a range of impact speeds. Results—The critical impact speed that yielded pelvic bone fracture decreased as the levels of obesity increased, which meant that the momentum effect of a greater body mass took precedence over the cushion effect of the soft tissue layer. Conclusions—The result suggests that obese children have a greater risk of pelvic bone fracture than do their nonobese counterparts in sideways falls. A further implication is that current <b>child</b> <b>safety</b> <b>devices,</b> systems, and regulations will need to be revisited as the prevalence of child obesity increases...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In many safety-critical applications, battery perfor-mance is a {{significant}} limiting factor that affects the feasibility of electronic <b>safety</b> <b>devices</b> intended to alert workers to hazardous situations. In particular, battery capacity and lifetime are difficult to predict when <b>safety</b> <b>devices</b> are exposed to extremes of temperature, humidity, shock, and vibration that are common in construction, excavation, drill rigs, and mining work sites. Because battery failure is unacceptable in <b>safety</b> <b>devices,</b> periodic preventative maintenance is required, adding to device cost and labor cost and reducing acceptance of electronic <b>safety</b> <b>devices.</b> Energy harvesting and communications techniques based on passive UHF RFID technology may offer an alternative to battery power for some types of <b>safety</b> alert <b>devices,</b> particularly where hazardous conditions are created by powered heavy equipment.

40|$|To {{investigate}} the knowledge, attitudes, and intended behaviors about use of <b>child</b> <b>safety</b> seats among parents of newborns and explore expectant mothers' views and decisions regarding <b>child</b> <b>safety</b> seats use. A cross-sectional survey and semi-structured interview {{were conducted in}} the maternity departments of two hospitals in China. Parents of newborns were recruited after delivery and surveyed on their knowledge, attitudes and behaviors regarding <b>child</b> <b>safety</b> seats use. Pregnant women were also interviewed to learn about their views and decisions regarding <b>child</b> <b>safety</b> seats use. Both quantitative and qualitative methods were {{used to analyze the}} data collected. Of a total of 242 parents of newborns recruited in the quantitative survey, 202 (83. 5 %) parents had heard of <b>child</b> <b>safety</b> seats and 149 (61. 6 %) parents reported they would use <b>child</b> <b>safety</b> seats for their babies.

40|$|Background: Childhood {{injury is}} the second {{leading cause of death}} for infants aged 1 – 5 years in the United Kingdom (UK) and most unintentional {{injuries}} occur in the home. We explored mothers' knowledge and awareness of child injury prevention and sought to discover mothers' views about the best method of designing interventions to deliver appropriate <b>child</b> <b>safety</b> messages to prevent injury in the home. Methods: Qualitative study based on 21 semi-structured interviews with prospective mothers and mothers of young children. Mothers were selected according to neighbourhood deprivation status. Results: There was no difference in awareness of <b>safety</b> <b>devices</b> according to mothers' deprivation status. Social networks were important in raising awareness and adherence to <b>child</b> <b>safety</b> advice. Mothers who were recent migrants had not always encountered safety messages or safety equipment commonly used in the UK. Mothers' recommended that safety information should be basic and concise, and include both written and pictorial information and case studies focus on proactive preventive messages. Messages should be delivered both by mass media and suitably trained individuals and be timed to coincide with pregnancy and repeated at age appropriate stages of child development. Conclusions: The findings suggest that timely childhood injury-related risk messages should be delivered during pregnancy and in line with developmental milestones of the child, through a range of sources including social networks, mass media, face-to-face advice from health professionals and other suitably trained mothers. In addition information on the safe use of home appliances around children and use of <b>child</b> <b>safety</b> equipment should be targeted specifically at those who have recently migrated to the United Kingdom. 9 page(s...|$|R
50|$|A <b>child</b> <b>safety</b> seat (infant <b>safety</b> seat, <b>child</b> {{restraint}} system, child seat, baby seat, restraining car seat, car seat, etc.) is a seat {{designed specifically}} {{to protect children from}} injury or death during collisions.

We aimed to determine the prevalence of safety seat use and survey the opinions of parents about <b>children</b> <b>safety</b> seat use in traffic. Materials and methods: A survey was conducted in Kars province of Turkey. A questionnaire was handed out to parents who were employees in a university. The first part of questionnaire was concerned with the personal properties of participants. The second part was designed to evaluate the level of parents’ knowledge on <b>child</b> <b>safety</b> seat. Results: Of the 600 questionnaires distributed, 516 (86 %) were returned and {{included in the final}} analysis. This study showed that 266 participants were having children and automobile. The ownership of <b>child</b> <b>safety</b> seat was only 13. 5 % among them. The parents reported that the lack of knowledge about <b>child</b> <b>safety</b> seats was the main reason for not having safety seats.
