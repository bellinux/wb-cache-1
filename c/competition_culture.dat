5000|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} in 2013 and titled ‘Under Western Eyes’, Sanders investigates how meta-narrative shapes Western perception of Russia.Geopolitical <b>competition,</b> <b>culture</b> or the 'value gap' are often considered the underlying causes of tension between Russia and the West. Less attention has been attributed to cognitive barriers on both sides. How important perception is also for the Western understanding of contemporary Russia can be gauged from media or academic narratives, many of which are anachronistic or self-fulfilling ('New Cold War'). The pinnacle of this asymmetric perception was the 2008 Georgia War. Once the widely shared assumption of unilateral Russian aggression was put to the test, it emerged that initial assessments had lacked the necessary balance.Narratives are a social science loan from literary theory, they represent [...] "compelling story lines which can explain events convincingly and from which inferences can be drawn".They are not necessarily analytical or evidence-based, can be more or less virtual, and correspond to a [...] "'telescoping' of logic and temporality". Narratives rely on deliberate gaps and fashion collective blind spots, and they have an important function in the formation and formulation of collective identity. They also help structure responses to unfolding events. This link to identity formation explains the persistence and power of narratives.|$|E
40|$|The lack of <b>competition</b> <b>culture</b> {{is one of}} {{the keys}} factors which {{undermine}} the enforcement of the competition law in an emerging economy. The lack of <b>competition</b> <b>culture</b> may only be ‘cured’ through activities of competition advocacy vis-a-vis the different stakeholders: State’s agencies, regulators, business community and consumers’ association. The paper analyzes this broad issue through a case study on the Brazilian experience in the field of competition advocacy. During the last years Brazil sensibly progressed in the enforcement of the competition law, {{and one of the reasons}} of this development was the functions of competition advocacy carried out by the Brazilian competition authority. The paper argues that the Brazilian success was mainly due to the institutional framework provided by the Brazilian competition act, which splits the activities of enforcement and of competition advocacy between two different agencies. While a fully independent authority enforces the competition law, an advisory body part of the Ministry of the Economy monitors the anti-competitive regulations adopted by other State agencies. The conclusions provide a number of lessons applicable to other emerging economies which have recently started to enforce a competition law regime...|$|E
40|$|This note {{begins by}} briefly {{addressing}} why competition policy {{is important for}} developing and transitioning economies. It then discusses some of the critical components of building a <b>competition</b> <b>culture.</b> Ideally, this process should begin by conducting a "needs assessment" {{in a number of}} areas. This assessment likely will lead to the identification of a list of steps that should be prioritised and undertaken. The priorities often can be grouped into three broad areas, namely, helping key constituencies to "buy in" to a <b>competition</b> <b>culture,</b> minimizing {{the extent to which a}} broad range of institutional mechanisms distort competition, and building an effective competition law enforcement regime to address private anticompetitive conduct. The note then summarizes the valuable perspectives of countries that have been providers or recipients of capacity building and technical assistance. It is based upon the responses to a questionnaire circulated in 2001 to delegates of the OECD’s Competition Committee and non-members who had been invited to participate in the second Global Forum on Competition, held in February 2002. This discussion is followed by a brief discussion of the potentially helpful roles that cooperation and peer review can play in the process of building the institutional capacity of a domestic enforcement authority. After briefly discussing the Doha Declaration, the note summarises the OECD’s capacity building activities in the competition field. Finally, in the conclusion, some suggestions are offered regarding a multi-faceted strategy for future capacity building and technical assistance activities. ...|$|E

We begin by discussing the evolution and current functioning of the moral foundations on which our framework rests. Next, we discuss the possible applications of such an evolutionarily-informed ethical framework to several domains of human behavior, namely: sexual maturation, mate attraction, intrasexual <b>competition,</b> <b>culture,</b> and the separation between various academic disciplines. Finally, we discuss ways in which an evolutionary awareness can inform our cross-generational activities—which we refer to as “intergenerational extended phenotypes”—by helping us to construct a better future for ourselves, for other sentient beings, and for our environment...|$|E

40|$|Effective merger {{control of}} {{cross-border}} mergers {{requires that the}} countries involved have effective merger control regimes. However, {{this may be a}} challenging task in many developing and emerging economies (DEEs) given the complexities of enforcing competition law in these economies. In particular, DEEs face many challenges in their efforts to build effective merger control regimes, including lack of resources, an inadequate legal framework, the absence of a proper <b>competition</b> <b>culture,</b> the difficult transition towards a market-based economy, the dominance of industrial policy, problems with implementation, and the role of foreign direct investment (FDI). For an effective review of cross-border transactions, and to ensure consistent decisions, international cooperation between the competition authorities involved is essential. Increased co-operation should be encouraged between competition authorities particularly in the design of remedies in cross-border merger cases. There are three main types of co-operation: multilateral, regional and bilateral. While all three ar...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effects of bank {{internationalization}} on risk-taking. We find that internationalization increases bank risk-taking: the Z-score of US banks that engage in foreign activities is {{lower than that of}} their purely domestic peers. The results are consistent with the empirical dominance of the market risk hypothesis, whereby internationalization increases banks’ risk due to market specific factors (<b>competition,</b> <b>culture,</b> regulatory complexity, economic and political instability, etc.) over the diversification hypothesis, whereby internationalization allows banks to reduce risk through increased diversification of their operations. The results continue to hold after conducting a variety of robustness tests, including accounting for endogeneity and sample selection bias. In additional tests, we find that risk-taking is more pronounced during financial crises due to a potentially higher impact of the market specific factors. These findings suggest that authorities might consider additional supervision or regulation of the activities of international banks...|$|E

40|$|The Escherichia coli BarA and UvrY {{proteins}} {{were recently}} demonstrated {{to constitute a}} novel two-component system, although its function has remained largely elusive. Here we show that mutations in the sensor kinase gene, barA, or the response regulator gene, uvrY, in uropathogenic E. coli drastically affect survival in long-term <b>competition</b> <b>cultures.</b> Using media with gluconeogenic carbon sources, the mutants have a clear growth advantage when competing with the wild type, but using media with carbon sources feeding into the glycolysis leads to a clear growth advantage for the wild type. Results from competitions with mutants in the carbon storage regulation system, CsrA/B, {{known to be a}} master switch between glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, led us to propose that the BarA-UvrY two-component system controls the Csr system. Taking these results together, we propose the BarA-UvrY two-component system is crucial for efficient adaptation between different metabolic pathways, an essential function for adaptation to a new environment...|$|R

Many articles have been written in recent years about corporate culture, which can be looked at as a system. Inputs include feedback from society, professions, laws, stories, heroes, values on competition or service, etc. Outputs are organizational behaviors, technologies, strategies, image, products, services, appearance, etc. Most organizations don't consciously try to create a certain culture, as it is typically created unconsciously, based on the values of the top management or the founders of an organization.

Accumulation of drug resistance mutations (mainly V 75 I, F 77 L, K 103 N, F 116 Y, Q 151 M, and M 184 V) eventually resulted in a strain that was genotypically and phenotypically resistant to all tested ddNs {{and the majority of}} NNRTIs. However, the multidrug-resistant virus retained wild type sensitivities to drugs such as foscarnet, phosphonomethoxyethyl adenine, dextran sulfate, JM 3100, saquinavir, and NNRTI TSAO-m 3 T. Drug-resistant isolates showed replication kinetics and infectivity in an in vitro peripheral blood mononuclear cell system {{similar to those of the}} wild type isolate from the same patient.

40|$|Efforts {{to develop}} a robust <b>competition</b> <b>culture</b> within the European Union, premised upon private {{enforcement}} of the EU competition rules, have gathered pace in recent years. This article examines {{the manner in which}} judicial innovation, coupled with legislative reinforcement, has rendered this area of primary importance in terms of the emergence of a distinct European tort law. In doing so, the article considers why this area has been singled out for such extensive vertical harmonisation, addressing this question from a variety of perspectives: those of a competition lawyer, a tort lawyer and a generalist EU lawyer. It is suggested that, while no single principled justification can explain the prioritisation of competition law in this respect, a constellation of contributory influences can be identified, including a notable comparative exemplar in the US experience, an increasingly central role for competition law within the framework of EU law more generally and, perhaps most importantly, significant institutional enthusiasm...|$|E
