5|$|Nonetheless, Bute {{was able}} to {{personally}} appoint the Constable of Cardiff Castle, and the constable by law acted as the effective mayor of Cardiff, ran the town's council and had wide powers when appointing local officials. He inherited the title of Lord-Lieutenant of the county in 1815, giving him the right to recommend the appointments of new magistrates and various other civic posts; potential candidates for these posts were advised to vote for Bute's representatives at elections. In 1825 he became the colonel {{in chief of the}} Royal Glamorgan Militia, and used this authority to instruct the militia to vote for his candidates. Those who publicly voted against Bute faced <b>charitable</b> <b>donations</b> and support being cut off.

5|$|Vietnamese {{president}} Trần Đức Lương {{expressed his}} {{thanks to the}} Chinese government on May 22 for rescuing the Vietnamese on the imperiled ships. Residents and industries in Vietnam raised ₫360million (VND, $36,000USD) {{for the families of}} the deceased fishermen, as well as providing 1ton of rice. Trade unions encouraged workers to donate one day's salary to help storm victims. The Vietnamese embassy in India raised about $1,000 (USD) and Vietnamese people living in Greece raised ₫26million (VND, €1,300 Euros) for storm victims. Ultimately, 43 different organizations and people donated $29,000 (USD) to the Vietnam Red Cross. The country's Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs presented an award to the Vietnam News Agency in June 2006 for its <b>charitable</b> <b>donations,</b> which included the distribution of ₫112million (VND, $11,200USD) to storm victims. One fisherman claimed to survive for two weeks in the open seas before being rescued, although he later confessed that he was safely on another boat, and wanted his family to retain the disaster compensation; after the man revealed that he had lied, his family was able to retain the relief funds due to their poverty. The head of the Vietnam Institute of Meteorology, Hydrology and Environment resigned two weeks after Chanchu killed many fishermen because of inadequate warnings. Then-Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung ordered a review of the meteorological agency as a result. Within a few years after the typhoon, the meteorological agency began issuing more accurate and timely forecasts. After the many deaths of fishermen from Chanchu, the Vietnam government prevented any fishermen from leaving harbor during the passage of Typhoon Durian in November.|$|E
