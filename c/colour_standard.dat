5000|$|In fact, {{television}} audiences {{largely ignored}} Aktuelle Kamera, preferring to watch West German newscasts. [...] The East German authorities adopted the French <b>colour</b> <b>standard</b> SECAM {{rather than the}} PAL encoding used in the Federal Republic of Germany. The basic television standard remained the same. It did prevent reception in colour by native East German TV sets though {{the majority of them}} were monochrome (black and white) anyway.|$|E
50|$|Similarly {{to other}} color {{standards}} of the pre-digital era, such as RAL <b>colour</b> <b>standard</b> or British Standard 4800, the Federal Standard 595 is a color collection rather than color space. The standard is built upon a set of color shades where a unique reference number is assigned to each color. This collection is then printed on sample color chips and provided to the interested parties. In contrast, modern color systems such as the Natural Color System (NCS) are built upon a color space paradigm, providing for much more flexibility and wider range of applications.|$|E
50|$|Colour {{television}} was introduced on 3 October 1969 {{on the new}} channel DFF2, which commenced broadcasting the same day, ready for the celebrations for the 20th anniversary {{of the founding of}} the GDR on 7 October. DFF chose the French SÉCAM <b>colour</b> <b>standard,</b> common in the Eastern Bloc, while West Germany had settled on the PAL standard. Mutual reception in black and white remained possible as the basic television standard was the same. Colour sets were at first not widely available in the East and many of these were modified to receive PAL as well as SÉCAM. East German manufacturers later made dual standard sets.|$|E
40|$|<b>Colour</b> <b>standards,</b> {{initially}} for specification purposes (e. g., the Post Office, Railways, and the Military), {{were transformed}} in Britain during the 1970 s into instruments for {{the pursuit of}} a Modernist agenda. Extolling a rational approach to <b>colour,</b> a master <b>standard</b> and a set of derived standards were devised at the British Standards Institution that would provide a colour palette covering the entire built environment of Britain. These revolutionized <b>colour</b> <b>standards</b> and were a unique venture in any country. This article charts the development of these standards, the problems to be overcome, and the role of their originators, Gloag, Hardy, and Medd. These little known figures had-and continue to have-a unique influence upon the colour of the built environment. Literally, they coloured Britain. And their standards remain in force today...|$|R

5000|$|In {{his later}} years, Judd {{also worked with}} furniture, design, and architecture. He was careful to {{distinguish}} his design practice from his artwork, writing in 1993: The configuration and the scale of art cannot be transposed into furniture and architecture. The intent of art {{is different from that}} of the latter, which must be functional. If a chair or a building is not functional, if it appears to be only art, it is ridiculous. The art of a chair is not its resemblance to art, but is partly its reasonableness, usefulness and scale as a chair...A work of art exists as itself; a chair exists as a chair itself.The first furniture was designed in 1973, when he moved from New York to Marfa. His designs included chairs, beds, shelves, desks and tables. Judd was initially prompted to design furniture by his own dissatisfaction with what was commercially available in Marfa. Early furniture was made by Judd of rough, lumberyard-cut pine but he continually refined the construction of the wooden pieces, employing craftspeople using a variety of techniques and materials around the world. In 1984, Judd commissioned Lehni AG, in Dübendorf, Switzerland to produce his furniture designs in sheet metal, in finishes of monochrome colored powdercoat based on the RAL <b>colour</b> <b>standard,</b> clear anodized aluminium, or solid copper. These designs are still produced by Lehni AG and sold through the Judd Foundation. In 1984, Judd drew upon his experience with this metal furniture by creating a series of colored artworks using the same techniques of powdercoating and bending. [...] At the time of his death, he was working on designs for a fountain commissioned by the city of Winterthur in 1991, Switzerland, and a new glass facade for a railroad station in Basel, Switzerland.|$|E
