40|$|Abstract: This paper {{addresses}} the purchasing power parity (PPP) puzzle for <b>commodity</b> <b>currencies.</b> A {{substantial part of}} the literature on <b>commodity</b> <b>currencies</b> has found that, despite controlling for the effect of commodity prices, PPP does not hold in the long run. We show that once we also control for the effect of the interest rate differential in the real exchange rate relationship, the discrepancies from PPP are fully accounted for. The analysis is applied to the real exchange rate behaviour in Norway, which has a primary commodity (oil) that constitutes the majority of its exports. We show that with the interest rate differential included in the long run real exchange rate relationship, the real oil price plays a minor role. Adjustment to equilibrium (half-lives) is also substantially reduced, taking no more than one year on average. Hence, contrary to earlier findings on <b>commodity</b> <b>currencies,</b> we have effectively removed the PPP puzzle.

50|$|The U.S. {{financial}} system was once closed, but the United States soon {{changed into a}} part of the interconnected global network. The international migration of saving funds redefined the global economic outlook and reshaped the structure.Since the 1980s, the international {{financial system}} has developed a new set of risk management techniques and new advanced financial instruments, and these efforts have led to various ways of success. Among them, asset securitization has been a great source of funding for the global financial revolution, which can significantly reduce the scope of global investment and split the stakes into a wide range of revenue sources. But the financial process of asset itself had a new problem. Asset securitization has allowed widespread funding to induce widespread changes in the economy, allowing widespread financing to take place, but it has spread to a huge problem if it suffers from itself. Asset securitization provided another major vulnerability to today's financial systems. The banks that lend loans do not cling to the danger of borrowers taking loans. The lender no longer needs to cling to compensate for its efforts to avoid danger in any case, as it is divided into the risk of loan. However, it is not only possible to talk about asset securitization as in black and white. If we ban asset securitization, the overall lending of the U.S. and the China will severely decline and the economy will shrink greatly.Since 1980, there has been a significant increase in global capital.Therefore, foreign investment in the United States has been increased. And it was good for U.S. The notion that the U.S. economy depends on foreign capital may sound dangerous. But the situation is not that serious. The savings fund is still based on the U.S. dollar, as its size is so large that only two kinds of the assets denominated in dollar and Euro assets are properly invested to cover the large amounts of capital. What European policymakers do not want to face the world's excessive saving funds is flowing in to Europe and it makes Euro more valuable. Because it means that Europe's product lower position in the world's market. The dollar is still an essential commodity for the <b>commodity,</b> <b>currency,</b> and derivatives of the world. The value of the dollar, which reflects inflation, is too high compared to other Asian currencies. It is necessary to implement coordinated efforts to resolve the exchange rate gap. But if the U.S. financial system fails to restore trust or if the Federal fails to respond to inflation expectations, the debate will end and the dollar will fall into turmoil.The Asian central bank will not deliberately carry out anything that could undermine the dollar as well as the sale of U.S. treasuries. That is because they are degrading the entire value of the enormous dollar they hold.The United States should maintain its position as an attractive target for investment, and its fiscal imbalances should be resolved quickly.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- For a multi-hop {{wireless}} network (MWN) consisting of mobile nodes controlled by independent self-interested users, incentive mechanism {{is essential for}} motivating mobile nodes to cooperate and forward packets for each other. Existing solutions such as barter based, virtual-currency based and reputation based schemes are either less effective or incur high imple mentation costs, and therefore do not fit well with the unique requirements of MWNs. In this paper, we propose a nove � and promising incentive paradigm, Controlled Coded packets as vlrtual <b>Commodity</b> <b>Currency</b> (C 4), to induce cooperative behaviors in MWNs. In our C 4, through introducing several techniques from network coding, coded information packets are utilized as {{a new kind of}} virtual currency to facilitate packet/service exchanges among self-interested nodes in a MWN. Since the virtual currency implemented in this way also carries useful �ata informat!on, it is the counterpart of the so-called <b>commodIty</b> <b>currency</b> III the physical world, and the overhead brought by C 4 is extremely small compared to traditional schemes. We theoretically show that C 4 is perfectly efficient to support MWNs with broadcast and multicast traffics. For pure unicast communications, by adjusting the grouping parameter, our C 4 provides a systematic way to smoothly trade incentive effectiveness for implementation cost, and traditional barter based and virtual-currency based schemes are just two extreme cases of C 4. We also show that when our C 4 is combined with the social network formed by mobile users in the MWN, the implementation costs can be further reduced without sacrificing incentive effectiveness.

We provide new empirical evidence on this issue by focusing on countries which are specialized in the ex-port of one leading commodity. For those countries, we investigate to which extent their real exchange rate is sensitive to price fluctuations of their dominant commodity. By using non-stationary panel techniques robust to cross-sectional-dependence, we find that the price of the dominant commodity has a significant long-run impact on the real exchange rate when the exports of the leading commodity have a share of at least 20 percent in the country’s total exports of merchandises. Our results also show that the larger the share, the larger the size of the impact. real exchange rates, commodity prices, non-stationary panel...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we empirically {{investigate}} whether multilateral adjustment to large U. S. external imbalances can help explain {{movements in the}} bilateral exchange rates of three <b>commodity</b> <b>currencies</b> - -the Australian, Canadian and New Zealand (ACNZ) dollars. To {{examine the relationship between}} exchange rates and multilateral adjustment, we develop a new regimeswitching model that augments a standard Markov-switching framework with a threshold variable. This enables us to model the exchange rate dynamics of our <b>commodity</b> <b>currencies</b> in the context of two regimes: one in which multilateral adjustment to large U. S. external imbalances is an important factor driving the <b>commodity</b> <b>currencies</b> and the second in which there are no significant U. S. external imbalances and hence multilateral adjustment is not a factor. We compare the performance of this model, both in and out-of-sample, to several other alternative models. In addition to developing this new model, another distinguishing feature of our paper is that we estimate all of our models using a Bayesian approach. We opt for a Bayesian approach in this context because it provides a simpler and more intuitive means of evaluating and comparing our different non-nested models. Moreover, it is relatively straightforward using a Bayesian approach to evaluate the importance of nonlinearities in the relationship between exchange rates and multilateral adjustment. Our findings suggest that during periods of large U. S. imbalances, fiscal and external, an exchange rate model for the ACNZ dollars should allow for multilateral adjustment effects. Moreover, we also find evidence to suggest that the adjustment of exchange rates to multilateral adjustment factors is best modelled as a non-linear process...|$|R
