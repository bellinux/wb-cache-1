An attorney representing two of the victims agreed, saying payouts could range from $5 million to $10 million per death or serious injury.

2500|$|Jesperson {{was arrested}} on 30 March 1995, {{for the murder of}} Winningham. He had been {{questioned}} by police a week before, but they had no grounds to arrest him after he refused to talk. In the days following, Jesperson decided that he was <b>certainly</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> arrested, and after two failed suicide attempts, he turned himself in hoping it would result in leniency during his sentencing. While in custody, Jesperson began revealing details of his killings and making claims of many others, most of which he later recanted. Also, a few days before his arrest, he wrote a letter to his brother. In it, he confessed to having killed eight people over the course of five years. This led police agencies in several states across the country to reopen old cases, many of which were found to be possible victims of Jesperson.|$|E

It'll be interesting to see where this season lands overall. Last year, we spent months entombed in a Frozen arc that seemed to stretch on for so long, it made even the warmest of fans feel icy. Putting Emma in the spotlight as the Dark One seems like an attempt to bring some focus back to the show's themes as well as its central characters, despite the fact there are <b>certainly</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> many new ones popping in (and out) over the season.

The aristocratic {{ruling class}} of Britain inhabiting {{their homes and}} castles <b>were</b> <b>certainly</b> not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> regulated by some lowly civil servants. This view was exemplified in 1911 when the immensely wealthy Duke of Sutherland acting on a whim wished to dispose of Trentham Hall, a vast Italianate palace in Staffordshire. After failing to offload the house onto a local authority, he decided to demolish it. The small, but vocal, public resistance to this plan caused the Duke of Rutland to write an irate letter to The Times accusing the objectors of [...] "impudence" [...] and <b>going</b> on <b>to</b> say [...] "....fancy my not being allowed to make a necessary alteration to Haddon without first obtaining the leave of some inspector". There was an irony in the Duke of Rutland's words, as this same duke was responsible for resurrecting {{one of his own}} country houses, Haddon Hall, from ruin. Thus, despite money being no problem for its owner, Trentham Hall was completely obliterated from its park, which the Duke retained and then opened to the public. Thus it was that country houses were left unprotected by any compulsory legislation.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{administrative}} offences relating to {{carrying out a}} construction and to occupancy of a construction.

What has, furthermore, motivated me to deal with this subject was the coming into force of the new Construction Act which brings, in many aspects, substantial changes to the current regulation. The subject-matter of my thesis led me, through analysis of different facts of administrative offences under the Construction Act, to a better understanding of all the key institutes of the construction law. The whole work is divided into eight chapters. The first and the second chapter introduce the subject of administrative offence and make for understanding of this institute in a wider context. The first chapter deals with penalty in administrative law which is understood as the decision process of administrative agencies on culpability and liability for illegal conduct. The first chapter also mentions some fundamental principles applying in this domain. Second chapter deals with administrative offences in general. It deals with the characteristic features of particular offences [...] ...|$|R

In 1971, she and Elkind asked Columbia Records {{to attach}} a pre-paid business reply card in each new pressing of her albums, {{which resulted in a}} considerable amount of suggestions from the public regarding the subject of her future releases.

By mid-1974, Carlos and Elkind had selected tracks of varying styles to record on the Moog synthesizer, which Carlos found liberating, as it demonstrated the flexibility of the instrument. Released as By Request in 1975, the album includes pieces from Bach, Wagner, Tchaikovsky, two of Carlos' compositions from the 1960s, and renditions of [...] "Eleanor Rigby" [...] by The Beatles and [...] "What's New Pussycat?", originally sung by Tom Jones. The final track, a [...] "witty and serious" [...] set of variations based on themes by Edward Elgar, was replaced with tracks from The Well-Tempered Synthesizer on UK pressings after members of Elgar's estate refused to have his music presented in a less than serious light, which [...] "devastated" [...] Carlos. By Request was followed by Switched-On Brandenburgs, a double album containing all six of Bach's Brandenburg Concertos played on a synthesizer, in 1979.|$|R
