40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>corporate</b> image <b>and</b> <b>corporate</b> {{responsibility}} {{have been studied}} extensively in academic literature but {{the results have been}} mixed. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to examine whether <b>corporate</b> image <b>and</b> <b>corporate</b> responsibility have an effect on stock returns of companies operating in Finland. I also examine the relationship between <b>corporate</b> image <b>and</b> <b>corporate</b> responsibility on earnings per share (EPS) and price-to-book (P/B) ratios. My results suggest that <b>corporate</b> image <b>and</b> <b>corporate</b> responsibility do not have an effect on stock returns of companies operating in Finland. The results also suggest that growth companies, with higher price-to-book ratios, have higher <b>corporate</b> image <b>and</b> <b>corporate</b> responsibility values. On the other hand, value companies, or companies with low price-to-book values, seem to have lower <b>corporate</b> image <b>and</b> <b>corporate</b> responsibility values...|$|R

For this reason, reputation has to be managed by creating appropriately strategic communication. Reputation is different from <b>corporate</b> identity <b>and</b> <b>corporate</b> image. Corporate reputation is more established, stable and testable than the <b>corporate</b> identity <b>and</b> <b>corporate</b> image. However, to build corporate reputation, we need to manage <b>corporate</b> image <b>and</b> <b>corporate</b> identity by applying a strategic corporate communication...|$|R
5|$|A {{second tranche}} of development, {{undertaken}} in two stages, was approved in November 2009. This included a general refurbishment and {{improvement of the}} existing facilities at the stadium, adding cover, better toilet and new refreshment facilities to the exposed East Stand, improving wheelchair access, adding extra catering and conferencing facilities and a new media and management centre. This was funded by collaboration between Gateshead Council, local development funds and Gateshead College. The covering of the 4,000-seat East Stand with a new canopy roof was completed in July 2010, immediately prior to Gateshead hosting a Diamond League event. The second stage of the re-development—the building of the <b>corporate</b> <b>and</b> media facilities—commenced on 6 September 2010 and was completed on time in summer2011. The {{total cost of the}} work was estimated to be £7.6million.|$|E

40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{the nature of}} the interface between <b>corporate</b> sustainability <b>and</b> <b>corporate</b> identity at both the strategic and instrumental levels. We developed an empirical qualitative study in two countries in Southern Europe addressing retailers who are actively engaged in pursuing corporate-sustainability strategies. Data sources include in-depth interviews, observations, and physical artifacts of identity (digital and printed documents). Findings reveal that, at a strategic level, corporate sustainability is embedded in corporate identity reflecting the company’s strategy. Companies also instrumentally use corporate identity to operationalize corporate sustainability strategies. Organizations show different patterns in the way they bridge <b>corporate</b> sustainability <b>and</b> identity. The contributions of this article are threefold: it reports the symbiotic relationship between <b>corporate</b> sustainability <b>and</b> <b>corporate</b> identity; it scrutinizes how <b>corporate</b> sustainability <b>and</b> <b>corporate</b> identity are integrated at the strategic and operational levels; and it establishes distinct patterns at the interface of <b>corporate</b> sustainability <b>and</b> <b>corporate</b> identity...|$|R

5|$|Government policy {{designed}} to promote affordable housing, widespread failures in <b>corporate</b> <b>and</b> regulatory governance, and historically low interest rates set by the Federal Reserve led to the mid-2000s housing bubble, which culminated with the 2008 financial crisis, the largest economic contraction in the nation's history since the Great Depression. Barack Obama, the first African American and multiracial president, was elected in 2008 amid the crisis, and subsequently passed stimulus measures and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act {{in an attempt to}} mitigate its negative effects and ensure there would not be a repeat of the crisis. The stimulus facilitated infrastructure improvements and a relative decline in unemployment. Dodd-Frank improved financial stability and consumer protection, although there is evidence it may have had a negative impact on small banks.|$|E

Many Senators objected to the appointment, believing that Matthews was too close to <b>corporate</b> <b>and</b> railroad interests, especially those of Jay Gould, and the Senate adjourned without voting on the nomination. The following year, when James A. Garfield entered the White House, he re-submitted Matthews's nomination to the Senate, which this time confirmed Matthews by one vote, 24 to 23. Matthews served for eight years until his death in 1889. His opinion in Yick Wo v. Hopkins in 1886 advanced his and Hayes' views on the protection of ethnic minorities' rights.|$|E
