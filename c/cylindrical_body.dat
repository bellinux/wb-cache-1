5|$|The {{bramble shark}} has a thick, <b>cylindrical</b> <b>body</b> and a {{somewhat}} flattened head. The snout is blunt and {{shorter than the}} width of the mouth, with widely spaced nostrils that are preceded by small flaps of skin. The eyes lack nictitating membranes; the tiny spiracles are located well behind them. The wide, curved mouth bears very short furrows at the corners. There are 20–26 upper and 22–26 lower tooth rows; each tooth is knife-like, with a single main cusp and up to three cusplets on either side. There are five pairs of gill slits, with the fifth pair the longest.|$|E
5|$|The prickly shark has a flabby and <b>cylindrical</b> <b>body,</b> {{with the}} adults {{markedly}} bulkier than juveniles, and a short, moderately flattened head. The nostrils are placed far apart and preceded by small flaps of skin. The spiracles are tiny and positioned well behind the eyes, which lack nictitating membranes. The mouth forms a broad arch, with very short furrows at the corners. There are 21–25 and 20–27 tooth rows {{in the upper}} and lower jaws respectively. The knife-like teeth each have a strongly angled main cusp flanked by up to three smaller cusplets on either side; the lateral cusplets are absent in young sharks. There are five pairs of gill slits, with the fifth pair the longest.|$|E
5|$|The viper dogfish has a slender, <b>cylindrical</b> <b>body</b> and a {{moderately}} flattened {{head with a}} very short and blunt snout. Behind the large oval eyes are narrow, elliptical spiracles. The nostrils are nearly vertical slits. The jaws are long and narrowly triangular, and can be protruded from the head. The teeth are distinctively fang-like and widely spaced; the most anterior teeth are grooved lengthwise. Six to 10 upper and seven to 10 lower tooth rows occur on each side, along with a single tooth row at {{the upper and lower}} symphyses (jaw midpoints). The teeth are largest at the symphysis and decline in size towards the corners of the mouth. When the mouth is closed, the upper symphysial tooth overlaps the lower, while the lateral teeth interlock. Five gill slits are seen, with the fifth pair longer than the others.|$|E

40|$|Summary. In {{the upper}} caput epididymidis of Glaucomys volans, where {{epithelial}} cells {{have a high}} concentration of RNA in their apical cyto¬ plasm, spermatozoa form long <b>cylindrical</b> <b>bodies.</b> Spermatozoan tails, adhering together, fill the interior of the cylinder. Their heads, with closely attached cytoplasmic droplets, are regularly arranged {{on the periphery of the}} cylinder with acrosomes facing the epididymal epithe¬ lium. In subsequent segments of the epididymis, the <b>cylindrical</b> <b>bodies</b> become more compact and the sperm heads are drawn together in rouleaux. In the lower caput epididymidis, <b>cylindrical</b> <b>bodies</b> fragment and masses of individual spermatozoa or spermatozoa grouped in rouleaux fill the lumina of the duct. It is suggested that in the flying squirrel the maturation of spermatozoa is accompanied by changes in their cohesive properties. Some mammalian spermatozoa show specific grouping during their journe...|$|R
5|$|The {{zebra shark}} has a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>body</b> with a large, {{slightly}} flattened {{head and a}} short, blunt snout. The eyes are small and placed {{on the sides of}} the head; the spiracles are located behind them and are as large or larger. The last 3 of the 5 short gill slits are situated over the pectoral fin bases, and the fourth and fifth slits are much closer together than the others. Each nostril has a short barbel and a groove running from it to the mouth. The mouth is nearly straight, with three lobes on the lower lip and furrows at the corners. There are 2833 tooth rows in the upper jaw and 2232 tooth rows in the lower jaw; each tooth has a large central cusp flanked by two smaller ones.|$|E
5|$|Stony corals {{are members}} of the class Anthozoa and like other members of the group, do not have a medusa stage in their life cycle. The {{individual}} animals are known as polyps and have a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>body</b> crowned by an oral disc surrounded by a ring of tentacles. The base of the polyp secretes the stony material from which the coral skeleton is formed. The body wall of the polyp consists of mesoglea sandwiched between two layers of epidermis. The mouth is at the centre of the oral disc and leads into a tubular pharynx which descends for some distance into the body before opening into the gastrovascular cavity that fills the interior of the body and tentacles. Unlike other cnidarians however, the cavity is subdivided by a number of radiating partitions, thin sheets of living tissue, known as mesenteries. The gonads are also located within the cavity walls. The polyp is retractable into the corallite, the stony cup in which it sits, being pulled back by sheet-like retractor muscles.|$|E

25|$|The brown lanternshark has a robust, almost <b>cylindrical</b> <b>body</b> with a wide, {{flattened}} head. Around 28 tooth rows are in {{the upper}} jaw and 34 tooth rows {{are in the}} lower jaw.

The five pairs of gill slits are relatively large. The first dorsal fin is low with a minute leading spine; the second dorsal fin is {{twice as high as}} the first with a much larger spine. The caudal peduncle is short, leading to a long caudal fin with the upper lobe much larger than the lower.|$|E

25|$|A modest-sized shark {{reaching}} a maximum known length of , the Japanese bullhead shark has a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>body</b> with the short, wide head and blunt, pig-like snout {{typical of the}} bullhead sharks. The eyes lack a nictitating membrane and are followed by tiny spiracles. Shallow supraorbital ridges are present above the eyes, and the space between them is slightly concave. The nostrils are divided into incurrent and excurrent openings by long flaps of skin that reach the mouth; the incurrent opening is encircled by a groove while another groove runs from the excurrent opening to the mouth. The small mouth is positioned nearly {{at the tip of}} the snout; the front teeth are small with a sharp central cusp flanked by a pair of lateral cusplets, while the back teeth are broad and rounded.

25|$|Velvet worms are {{segmented}} {{animals with}} a flattened <b>cylindrical</b> <b>body</b> cross-section {{and rows of}} unstructured body appendages known as oncopods or lobopods (informally: stub feet). The animals grow to between 0.5 and 20cm (.2 to 8in), with the average being about 5cm (2 in), and have between 13 and 43 pairs of legs. Their skin consists of numerous, fine transverse rings and is often inconspicuously coloured orange, red or brown, but sometimes also bright green, blue, gold or white, and occasionally patterned with other colours. Segmentation is outwardly inconspicuous, and identifiable by the regular spacing of the pairs of legs and in the regular arrangement of skin s, excretion organs and concentrations of nerve cells. The individual body sections are largely unspecialised; even the head develops only a little differently from the abdominal segments. Segmentation is apparently specified by the same gene as in other groups of animals, and is activated in each case, during embryonic development, at the rear border of each segment and in the growth zone of the stub feet. Although onychophorans fall within the protostome group, their early development has a deuterostome trajectory, (with the mouth and anus forming separately); this trajectory is concealed by the rather sophisticated processes which occur in early development.|$|E
