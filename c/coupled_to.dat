25|$|The key {{method to}} {{distinguish}} between these different models involves study of the particles' interactions ("coupling") and exact decay processes ("branching ratios"), which can be measured and tested experimentally in particle collisions. In the Type-I 2HDM model one Higgs doublet <b>couples</b> <b>to</b> up and down quarks, while the second doublet does not <b>couple</b> <b>to</b> quarks. This model has two interesting limits, in which the lightest Higgs <b>couples</b> <b>to</b> just fermions ("gauge-phobic") or just gauge bosons ("fermiophobic"), but not both. In the Type-II 2HDM model, one Higgs doublet only <b>couples</b> <b>to</b> up-type quarks, the other only <b>couples</b> <b>to</b> down-type quarks. The heavily researched Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) includes a Type-II 2HDM Higgs sector, {{so it could be}} disproven by evidence of a Type-I 2HDM Higgs.|$|R
5|$|A {{sound film}} is a motion picture with {{synchronized}} sound, or sound technologically <b>coupled</b> <b>to</b> image, {{as opposed to a}} silent film. The first known public exhibition of projected sound films took place in Paris in 1900, but decades passed before sound motion pictures were made commercially practical. Reliable synchronization was difficult to achieve with the early sound-on-disc systems, and amplification and recording quality were also inadequate. Innovations in sound-on-film led to the first commercial screening of short motion pictures using the technology, which took place in 1923.|$|E

A speed of 28.5 knots was expected at standard displacement and 27.5 knots at full-load displacement on normal output; corresponding speeds at overload condition were 29.25 and 28.25 knots respectively.

5|$|The {{benzodiazepine}} {{class of}} drugs also interact with peripheral benzodiazepine receptors.

Benzodiazepines also function as weak adenosine reuptake inhibitors. It has been suggested that some of their anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, and muscle relaxant effects may be in part mediated by this action.|$|E

These Cooper pairs have their motion <b>coupled</b> <b>to</b> nearby matter via lattice vibrations called phonons, thereby avoiding the collisions with atoms that normally create electrical resistance.
