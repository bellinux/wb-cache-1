5|$|By the 1st century BC, {{during the}} Hellenistic period, the Greeks {{had begun to}} develop their own {{mathematical}} schemes for predicting the positions of the planets. These schemes, which were based on geometry rather than the arithmetic of the Babylonians, would eventually eclipse the Babylonians' theories in complexity and <b>comprehensiveness,</b> and account for most of the astronomical movements observed from Earth with the naked eye. These theories would reach their fullest expression in the Almagest written by Ptolemy in the 2nd century CE. So complete was the domination of Ptolemy's model that it superseded all previous works on astronomy and remained the definitive astronomical text in the Western world for 13 centuries. To the Greeks and Romans there were seven known planets, each presumed to be circling Earth according to the complex laws laid out by Ptolemy. They were, in increasing order from Earth (in Ptolemy's order): the Moon, Mercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn.|$|E
5|$|Walker {{accepted}} a re-appointment as {{the superintendent of}} the 1880 Census because a new law, spearheaded by Congressman James A. Garfield, had been passed {{to allow him to}} appoint trained census enumerators free from political influence. Notably, the 1880 Census's results suggested population throughout the Southern states had increased improbably over Walker's 1870 census but an investigation revealed that the latter had been inaccurately enumerated. Walker publicized the discrepancy even as it effectively discredited the accuracy his 1870 work. The tenth Census resulted in the publication of twenty-two volumes, was popularly regarded as the best census of any up to that time, and definitively established Walker's reputation as the preeminent statistician in the nation. The Census was again delayed {{as a result of its}} size and was the subject of praise and criticism on its <b>comprehensiveness</b> and relevance. Walker also used the position as a bully pulpit to advocate for the creation of a permanent Census Bureau to not only ensure that professional statisticians could be trained and retained but that the information could be better popularized and disseminated. Following Garfield's 1880 election, there was wide speculation that he would name Walker to be Secretary of the Interior, but Walker had accepted the offer to become President of MIT in the spring of 1881 instead.|$|E

25|$|Most critiques can {{be divided}} into two main categories. The first group lauded the book for its <b>comprehensiveness</b> and the ground {{breaking}} views and analysis. The second group complained about revelation of secret documents as well as the bookâ€™s coverage of the concerns among Iranian officials and domestic issues. They noted that such information might be exploited by the negotiating parties opposing Iran and concluded that publication of the book has been a dis-service to the countryâ€™s interests and national security. They also stated that the book is one-sided and the author has omitted some facts which were not in line with his or his team's interests.|$|E
25|$|<b>Comprehensiveness</b> {{can refer}} {{to the number of}} entries in a database. On those terms, a crystal {{structure}} database can be regarded as comprehensive, if it contains a collection of all (re-)published crystal structures in the category of interest and is updated frequently. Searching for structures in such a database can replace more time-consuming scanning of the open literature. Access to crystal structure databases differs widely. It can be divided into reading and writing access. Reading access rights (search, download) affect the number and range of users. Restricted reading access is often coupled with restricted usage rights. Writing access rights (upload, edit, delete), on the other hand, determine the number and range of contributors to the database. Restricted writing access is often coupled with high data integrity.|$|E
25|$|The Grammar was {{continued}} in three volumes, treating principally derivation, composition and syntax, {{the last of}} which was unfinished. Grimm then began a third edition, of which only one part, comprising the vowels, appeared in 1840, his time being afterwards taken up mainly by the dictionary. The Grammar stands alone {{in the annals of}} science for its <b>comprehensiveness,</b> method and fullness of detail. Every law, every letter, every syllable of inflection in the different languages was illustrated by an almost exhaustive mass of material, and it has served as a model for all succeeding investigators. Diez's grammar of the Romance languages is founded entirely on its methods, which have also exerted a profound influence on the wider study of the Indo-European languages in general.|$|E
25|$|Australia in the War of 1939â€“1945 {{had less}} of an impact on later Australian {{histories}} of World War II than the Official History of Australia in the War of 1914â€“1918 has had on histories of World War I. The series has been criticised as lacking the authority of Bean's work {{and some of the}} volumes on campaigns are regarded as over-detailed. The volumes dealing with government and politics and the war economy remain dominant in their fields, however. Bean's history has also out-sold the World War II series. While Gavin Long's achievement has not received the same degree of recognition as C.E.W. Bean's, both series are generally seen has having created an important tradition for Australian official histories which includes high standards of accuracy, <b>comprehensiveness</b> and literary skill.|$|E
25|$|Even a brief perusal of the Atomic Energy Act reveals that, {{despite its}} <b>comprehensiveness,</b> {{it does not}} at any point {{expressly}} require the States to construct or authorize nuclear powerplants or prohibit the States from deciding, as an absolute or conditional matter, not to permit the construction of any further reactors. Instead, petitioners argue that the Act is intended to preserve the Federal Government as the sole regulator of all matters nuclear, and that 25524.2 falls {{within the scope of}} this impliedly pre-empted field. But as we view the issue, Congress, in passing the 1954 Act and in subsequently amending it, intended that the Federal Government should regulate the radiological safety aspects involved in the construction and operation of a nuclear plant, but that the States retain their traditional responsibility in the field of regulating electrical utilities for determining questions of need, reliability, cost, and other related state concerns.|$|E
25|$|The {{county commissioners}} {{authorized}} the Brookings Institution {{to study the}} existing county government structure and suggest recommendations in 1938. The 720-page report opined that the county had outgrown its form of government. The study recommended {{the creation of a}} nonpartisan county council consisting of nine members representing defined districts of the county who could pass legislation, determine policy, and control over the administration of the county. The study also recommended the hiring of a county administrator, the creation of an independent comptroller in charge of county finances, and a civil service commission. The Montgomery County Civic Federation praised the study for its <b>comprehensiveness.</b> The county commissioners appointed a citizen's committee to determine how to enact the study's recommendations. The county commissioners strongly criticized the recommendation to create a county council, both because the council would be nonpartisan and because each county resident would be able to vote for only one representative rather than for all nine.|$|E
25|$|Morley's {{particular}} {{passion was}} {{the study of}} the Maya calendar and its related inscriptions, and in this respect, he made useful expositions that have withstood later scrutiny. His talent was not so much to make innovations, but rather to publicise and explain the workings of the various systems. He was particularly proficient at recovering calendar dates from well-worn and weathered inscriptions, owing to his great familiarity with the various glyphic styles of the tzolk'in, haab' and Long Count elements. Yet in his focus on calendric details, he would often overlook or even neglect the documentation of other non-calendric aspects of the Maya script; the <b>comprehensiveness</b> of some of his publications suffered much as a result. Some leading figures from a later generation of Mayanists would come to regard his publications as being inferior in detail and scope to that of his predecessors, such as Teoberto Maler and Alfred Maudslay â€” poorer quality reproductions, omitted texts, sometimes inaccurate drawings.|$|E
500|$|A [...] "Republican paper, a Protestant {{paper and}} a paper more {{representative}} of the suburbs than the ethnic mix of the city", the Tribune generally did not match the <b>comprehensiveness</b> of the New York Times coverage, but its national, international and business coverage was generally viewed as {{among the best in}} the industry, as was its overall style. At one time or another, the paper was home to such writers as Dorothy Thompson, Red Smith, Roger Kahn, Richard Watts, Jr., Homer Bigart, Walter Kerr, Walter Lippmann, St. Clair McKelway, Judith Crist, Dick Schaap, Tom Wolfe, John Steinbeck, and Jimmy Breslin. Editorially, the newspaper was the voice for eastern Republicans, later referred to as Rockefeller Republicans, and espoused a pro-business, internationalist viewpoint.|$|E
500|$|The Herald {{also saw}} its {{reputation}} for <b>comprehensiveness</b> {{challenged by the}} Times, purchased by Chattanooga Times publisher Adolph Ochs in 1896, {{a few weeks before}} the paper would have likely closed its doors. Ochs, turning the once-Republican Times into an independent Democratic newspaper, refocused the newspaper's coverage on commerce, quickly developing a reputation as the [...] "businessman's bible". When the Times began turning a profit in 1899, Ochs began reinvesting the profits make into the newspaper toward news coverage, quickly giving the Times the reputation as the most complete newspaper in the city. Bennett, who viewed the Herald as a means of supporting his lifestyle, did not make serious moves to expand the newspaper's newsgathering operations, and allowed the paper's circulation to fall well below 100,000 by 1912.|$|E
500|$|Wheeler's {{graduate}} students included Katharine Way, Richard Feynman, David Hill, Bei-Lok Hu, Kip Thorne, Jacob Bekenstein, John R. Klauder, William Unruh, Robert M.

Wheeler gave {{a high priority}} to teaching, and continued to teach freshman and sophomore physics, saying that the young minds were the most important. With Kent Harrison, Kip Thorne and Masami Wakano, Wheeler wrote Gravitation Theory and Gravitational Collapse (1954). This led to the voluminous general relativity textbook Gravitation (1973), co-written with Misner and Thorne. Its timely appearance during {{the golden age of}} general relativity and its <b>comprehensiveness</b> made it an influential relativity textbook for a generation. Wheeler teamed up with Edwin F. Taylor to write Spacetime Physics (1966) and Scouting Black Holes (1996). [...] At Princeton he supervised 46 PhDs, more than any other professor in the Princeton physics department.|$|E
500|$|Travel {{literature}} {{changed in}} the 1840s as steam-powered ships and trains made Continental journeys accessible to the middle class. Guidebooks and handbooks were published for this new traveller, who was unfamiliar with {{the tradition of the}} Grand Tour. The most famous of these was John Murray's Handbook for Travellers on the Continent (1836). By 1848, Murray had published 60 such works, which [...] "emphasised <b>comprehensiveness,</b> presenting numerous possible itineraries and including information on geology, history, and art galleries". Whereas during the Romantic period, travel writers differentiated themselves from mere tourists through the spontaneity and exuberance of their reactions, during the Victorian period, travel writers attempted to legitimise their works through a [...] "discourse of authenticity". That is, they claimed to have experienced the true culture of an area and their reactions to it were specifically personal, as opposed to the writers of generic guidebooks, whose response was specifically impersonal.|$|E
500|$|Writing for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Marlene Parrish {{gave the}} book a {{favorable}} review, highlighting {{it in her}} article [...] "Favorite Cookbooks for 2002".

The Denver Post included the book in a list of best cookbooks of 2002. Another article for the same newspaper highlighted recipes in the book, including Spaghetti alla Carbonara and Cobb salad, Pear-Apple Crisp with Brown Sugar-Bacon Topping and Bacon Brittle. A review in the Toronto Star criticized Perry's lack of creativity in her choice of recipes. The review concluded the book {{was a good deal}} compared to other cookbooks on the subject, while noting its lack of <b>comprehensiveness</b> with the small number of total recipes included.

500|$|American Canadian {{linguist}} William J. Samarin noted Armstrong conflated {{tone and}} intonation {{for the most}} part; he claimed this led to [...] "exaggerated complexities" [...] in her description, {{particularly with respect to}} the final intonational fall in interrogatives. When Armstrong wrote her manuscript, analysis of tone was a nascent field and the complex relationship between phonemic tonemes and phonetic pitch led phoneticians to analyze languages as having large numbers of tones. In 1952, SOAS linguist Lyndon Harries was able to take Armstrong's data and analyze Kikuyu tone as only having two underlying tone levels. American linguist Mary Louise Pratt also re-analyzed Armstrong's Kikuyu data as only having two levels. Pratt also noted Armstrong did not distinguish allophonically long vowels from vowels which are phonemically long. University of Nairobi linguist Kevin C. Ford wrote that if Armstrong had not died before completing this book [...] "there is no doubt she could have expanded her range of data and probably presented some rigorous analysis, which is sadly lacking in the published work". The American phonologist Nick Clements described Armstrong's book in a 1984 paper as [...] "an extremely valuable source of information due to the <b>comprehensiveness</b> of its coverage and accuracy of the author's phonetic observations".|$|E
500|$|Britten's first operatic {{recording}} was The Turn of the Screw, made in January 1955 {{with the}} original English Opera Group forces. In 1957 he conducted The Prince of the Pagodas in an early stereo recording, supervised by Culshaw. Decca's first major commercial success with Britten came the following year, with Peter Grimes, which has, at 2013, never {{been out of the}} catalogues since its first release. From 1958 Britten conducted Decca recordings of many of his operas and vocal and orchestral works, including the Nocturne (1959), the Spring Symphony (1960) and the War Requiem (1963). The last sold in unexpectedly large numbers for a classical set, and thereafter Decca unstintingly made resources available to Culshaw and his successors for Britten recordings. Sets followed of Albert Herring (1964), the Sinfonia da Requiem (1964), Curlew River (1965), A Midsummer Night's Dream (1966), The Burning Fiery Furnace (1967), Billy Budd (1967) and many of the other major works. In 2013, to mark the anniversary of Britten's birth, Decca released a set of 65 CDs and one DVD, [...] "Benjamin Britten â€“ Complete Works". Most of the recordings were from Decca's back catalogue, but in the interests of <b>comprehensiveness</b> a substantial number of tracks were licensed from 20 other companies including EMI, Virgin Classics, Naxos, Warner and NMC.|$|E
500|$|Robert Cyril Stebbins (March 31, 1915 â€“ September 23, 2013) was an American herpetologist and {{illustrator}} {{known for}} his field guides and popular books {{as well as his}} studies of reptiles and amphibians. His Field Guide to Western Reptiles and Amphibians, first published in 1966, is still considered the definitive reference of its kind, owing to both the quality of the illustrations and the <b>comprehensiveness</b> of the text. A professor of zoology at the University of California, Berkeley, for over 30 years, he was the first curator of herpetology at the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology, a 1949 Guggenheim fellow, and author of over 70 scientific articles. [...] His discovery of the ring species phenomenon in Ensatina salamanders is now a textbook example of speciation, and he performed extensive research on the parietal eye of reptiles. He produced nature films, supported science education in primary grades, and organized conservation efforts that aided in the passing of the 1994 California Desert Protection Act. After retirement he continued to paint, collect field notes, and write books. Stebbins is commemorated in the scientific names of three species: Batrachoseps stebbinsi, the Tehachapi slender salamander; Anniella stebbinsi, a legless lizard; and Ambystoma tigrinum stebbinsi, the endangered Sonora tiger salamander.|$|E
500|$|Andrade was not {{directly}} affected by the Revolution of 1930, in which GetÃºlio Vargas seized power and became dictator, but he belonged to the landed class the Revolution was designed to displace, and his employment prospects declined under the Vargas regime. [...] He was able to remain at the Conservatory, where he was now Chair of History of Music and Aesthetics. [...] With this title he became a de facto national authority {{on the history of}} music, and his research turned from the personal bent of his 1920s work to textbooks and chronologies. [...] He continued to document rural folk music, and during the 1930s made an enormous collection of recordings of the songs and other forms of music of the interior. [...] The recordings were exhaustive, with a selection based on <b>comprehensiveness</b> rather than an aesthetic judgment, and including context, related folktalkes, and other non-musical sound. [...] Andrade's techniques were influential in the development of ethnomusicology in Brazil and predate similar work done elsewhere, including the well-known recordings of Alan Lomax. [...] He is credited with coining the word [...] "popularesque," [...] which he defined as imitations of Brazilian folk music by erudite urban musicians ("erudite" [...] is generally a deprecation in Andrade's vocabulary). The word continues to have currency in discussion of Brazilian music as both a scholarly and nationalist category.|$|E
500|$|Read-Only Memory {{published}} Britsoft: An Oral History in 2015 and The Bitmap Brothers: Universe in 2016, {{both about}} {{a golden age}} of British game development. Britsoft: An Oral History {{was designed as a}} companion to the 2014 film From Bedrooms to Billions, which covers the [...] "Britsoft" [...] era of British game development from the late '70s bedroom developer cottage industry to the present-day billion-pound industry. The book uses developer interviews to tell the era's story so as to supplement rather than reproduce the film's narrative. Interviewed developers include coders and designers David Braben, Geoff Crammond, Mel Croucher, Dino Dini, Jon Hare, Archer MacLean, Jeff Minter, Peter Molyneux and David Perry, businessman David Darling, and writers Chris Anderson, Gary Penn, and Julian Rignall. The book's editor and former Edge editor, Alex Wiltshire, divides the title into eight sections: the developers' initial exposure to video games, the first wave as it attempts to sell its software in the early 1980s, the industry that begins to form, the wealth that comes to the industry, the relationship between these developers and a burgeoning games journalism, the transition from home computers to 16-bit hardware, the coalescing of industry and closure of small businesses, and the late 1990s dispersion as these developers left the industry or moved to less prominent roles in the United States. The book is designed to be read linearly and out of order, based on its presentation as anecdotal snippets rather than long text blocks. It also features linked page numbering such that readers can skip directly to the developer's next page. Reviewers described the 422-page volume by its heft, <b>comprehensiveness,</b> and academicism. Eurogamer and The Verge recommended the book for readers interested in the era as well as readers interested in artistic production. Nintendo Life described the book as lavish, lush, and pleasurable. Reviewers lightly criticised the book's lack of signposted introductions to the many characters, and complained of needing to flip to the appendix for explanatory footnotes and captions for the book's personalities and illustrations. Eurogamer considered the book to come as close to a definitive history of British gaming as is feasible, and praised the book's intimate and fun tone on otherwise dry subject matter.|$|E
