40|$|Wind turbine {{planetary}} gearboxes often run under nonstationary conditions due to volatile wind conditions, thus {{resulting in}} nonstationary vibration signals. Time-frequency analysis gives {{insight into the}} structure of an arbitrary nonstationary signal in joint time-frequency domain, but conventional time-frequency representations suffer from either time-frequency smearing or <b>cross-term</b> <b>interferences.</b> Reassigned wavelet scalogram has merits of fine time-frequency resolution and cross-term free nature but has very limited applications in machinery fault diagnosis. In this paper, we use reassigned wavelet scalogram to extract fault feature from wind turbine planetary gearbox vibration signals. Both experimental and in situ vibration signals are {{used to evaluate the}} effectiveness of reassigned wavelet scalogram in fault diagnosis of wind turbine planetary gearbox. For experimental evaluation, the gear characteristic instantaneous frequency curves on time-frequency plane are clearly pinpointed in both local and distributed sun gear fault cases. For in situ evaluation, the periodical impulses due to planet gear fault are also clearly identified. The results verify the feasibility and effectiveness of reassigned wavelet scalogram in planetary gearbox fault diagnosis under nonstationary conditions...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Digital {{intercept}} receivers {{are currently}} moving towards classical time-frequency analysis techniques for analyzing low probability of intercept radar signals. Although these techniques are {{an improvement over}} existing Fourier-based techniques, they still suffer {{from a lack of}} readability, due to poor time-frequency localization and <b>cross-term</b> <b>interference,</b> which may lead to inaccurate detection and parameter extraction. In this study, the reassignment method, because of its ability to smooth out <b>cross-term</b> <b>interference</b> and improve time-frequency localization, is proposed as an improved signal analysis technique to address these deficiencies. Simulations are presented that compare time-frequency representations of the classical time-frequency techniques with those of the reassignment method. Four different low probability of intercept waveforms are analyzed (two frequency modulated continuous wave waveforms and two frequency shift keying waveforms). The following metrics are used for analysi...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{algorithm}} is proposed for efficiently smoothing the slices of the Wigner distribution by exploiting the recently developed relation between the Radon transform of the ambiguity function and the fractional Fourier transformation. The main advantage of the new {{algorithm is}} its ability to suppress <b>cross-term</b> <b>interference</b> on chirp-like auto-components without any detrimental effect to the auto-components. For a signal with N samples, the computational complexity of the algorithm is O(N log N) flops for each smoothed slice of the Wigner distribution...|$|R
30|$|In this section, {{we examine}} the {{enhancement}} of the auto-term TFDs of the target signals relative to noise and <b>cross-term</b> <b>interference</b> by averaging the auto-sensor TFD obtained at each virtual antenna. This averaging is considered an effective technique for the identification of auto-term and cross-term regions [21 – 23]. In the following two subsections, the effect of time-frequency averaging is analyzed from the MIMO radar perspective in two aspects, namely, the auto-term TFD enhancement over the cross-term TFD and the signal TFD enhancement over the noise.|$|R
40|$|Highly {{localized}} quadratic time-frequency distributions cast nonstationary signals as sparse in the joint-variable representations. The {{linear model}} relating the ambiguity domain and time-frequency domain permits {{the application of}} sparse signal reconstruction techniques to yield high-resolution time-frequency representations. In this paper, we design signal-dependent kernels that enable the resulting time-frequency distribution to meet the two objectives of reduced <b>cross-term</b> <b>interference</b> and increased sparsity. It is shown that, for random undersampling schemes, the new adaptive kernel is superior to traditional reduced interference distribution kernels.

40|$|In this study, we {{proposed}} a joint time-frequency distribution of suppressing cross-terms aiming at <b>cross-terms</b> <b>interference</b> of Wigner-Ville distribution. According to the analyzed signal, the Wigner-Ville distribution and Smooth Pseudo Wigner-Ville distribution can be obtained. Moreover, the prototype of timefrequency distribution {{can be obtained by}} non-linear filter for Smooth Pseudo Wigner-Ville distribution. In this way, the distributions the joint time-frequency distribution came to the result of the product of two. As a result, the joint time-frequency distribution can suppress cross-terms effectively and keep high time-frequency resolution. Finally, simulations and experiments prove the effectiveness of the proposed method...|$|R
30|$|On {{the other}} hand, the FrFT {{is a kind}} of linear {{transform}} and thus does not have the problem of <b>cross-term</b> <b>interference</b> known from other high-resolution transforms such as the Wigner-Ville distribution. Nevertheless, speech signals show a very complex spectrotemporal dynamics, and thus cannot be simply decomposed into several independent components using the FrFT or similar methods. When the analysis emphasizes one component in a certain fraction domain, it will bring dispersion effect to some other components, so a compromise has to be made when determining the transform order. In the proposed order selection methods, it seems that an optimal value always exists to achieve the compromise between tracking the dynamic characteristics of the speech harmonics and avoiding severe smearing of the formants.|$|R
40|$|Bilinear time-frequency {{distributions}} (TFDs) {{are developed}} to represent time-varying signal jointly in time frequency representation (TFR). The TFDs offer {{a good time}} and frequency resolution, are appropriate to analyze power quality signals that consist of magnitude variation and multiple frequencies. However, the TFD suffers from <b>cross-terms</b> <b>interferences</b> because of their bilinear structures. In this paper, smooth-windowed Wigner-Ville distribution (SWWVD) is used to analyze power quality signals. The power quality signals are swell, sag, interruption, harmonic, interharmonic and transient. To get an accurate TFR, the parameters of the separable kernel are estimated from the signal. A set of performance measures are defined and used to compare the TFR for various kernel parameters. The comparison shows the signals with different parameters require different kernel settings {{in order to get the}} optimal TFR...|$|R
40|$|The Wigner {{distribution}} (WD) {{possesses a}} number of desirable mathematical properties relevant to time-frequency analysis. However, the presence of interference terms renders the WD of multicomponent signals extremely difficult to interpret. In this work, we propose adaptive suppression of interference terms using the Shift-Invariant Wavelet Packet Decomposition. A prescribed signal is expanded on its best basis and transformed into the Wigner domain. Subsequently, the interference terms are eliminated by adaptively thresholding the cross WD of interactive basis functions, according to their amplitudes and distance in an idealized time-frequency plane. We define a distance measure that weighs the Euclidean distance with the local distribution of the signal. The amplitude and distance thresholds control the <b>cross-term</b> <b>interference,</b> the useful properties of the distribution, and the computational complexity. The properties of the resultant modified Wigner distribution (MWD) are investigat [...] ...|$|R
30|$|Earlier it {{was shown}} that the <b>cross-term</b> <b>interference</b> arising {{from a pair of}} monocomponents is located between main components. Moreover, the {{interferences}} are oscillatory in nature, and the spatial frequency of these oscillations {{is a function of the}} distance between the components in time and frequency. That is, the closer the two components, the lower the oscillation frequency. In ambiguity space, this would mean that the interference lies closer to the origin. The low frequency interference also appears as a result of the signal's instantaneous frequency changing nonlinearly with time. Due to the low frequency nature of these oscillations, the cross-terms may not be completely removed by the kernel due to overlap with signal components in the ambiguity space. Although this interference can be removed at the post-processing stage by (say) least-squares fitting to a Gaussian density, it is important to remember that this interference contributes to the signal's overall energy distribution.|$|R
40|$|Time-frequency {{analysis}} {{techniques are}} used to produce a plot of a signal’s power spectrum {{as a function of}} time. The most well-known time-frequency representation is the spectrogram. Although relatively simple to compute, it suffers from having a significant limitation in that it cannot offer good time or frequency resolution simultaneously. To overcome this weakness, many other representations have been developed that provide combined high resolution over time and frequency. The Wigner-Ville distribution, the scalogram, and the discrete Gabor transform are among the most well-known of these methods. Due to specific shortcomings with regard to these distributions for multi-component signals, and for certain mathematical concerns such as shift invariance and time and frequency marginal conditions, several classes of representations have been developed which effectively address specific signal types. Examples of these categories are Cohen’s class, the affine class, and the signal adaptive expansions based upon the Matching Pursuit method. The goals of any of these specific methods are to minimize <b>cross-term</b> <b>interference,</b> provide good time and frequency resolution, and provide a good model for the signal of interest...|$|R
40|$|Spinal {{somatosensory}} {{evoked potential}} (SSEP) has been employed to monitor {{the integrity of the}} spinal cord during surgery. To detect both temporal and spectral changes in SSEP waveforms, an investigation of the application of time-frequency analysis (TFA) techniques was conducted. SSEP signals from 30 scoliosis patients were analysed using different techniques; short time Fourier transform (STFT), Wigner-Ville distribution (WVD), Choi-Williams distribution (CWD), coneshaped distribution (CSD) and adaptive spectrogram (ADS). The time-frequency distributions (TFD) computed using these methods were assessed and compared with each other. WVD, ADS, CSD and CWD showed better resolution than STFT. Comparing normalised peak widths, CSD showed the sharpest peak width (0. 13 ± 0. 1) in the frequency dimension, and a mean peak width of 0. 70 ± 0. 12 in the time dimension. Both WVD and CWD produced <b>cross-term</b> <b>interference,</b> distorting the TFA distribution, but this was not seen with CSD and ADS. CSD appeared to give a lower mean peak power bias (10. 3 % ± 6. 2 %) than ADS (41. 8 % ± 19. 6 %). Application of the CSD algorithm showed both good resolution and accurate spectrograms, and is therefore recommended as the most appropriate TFA technique for the analysis of SSEP signals. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
30|$|Several {{approaches}} {{have been proposed}} {{for the detection of}} PQDs in recent years, including the discrete Fourier transform (DFT), short-time Fourier transform (STFT), Gabor-Wigner transform (GWT), Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT), WT, ST, Kalman filter (KF), and strong trace filter (STF) [19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26]. However, the DFT is not suitable for the detection of transient PQDs [19, 20]. The STFT [21, 22] has the limitation of a fixed window, so it is also inadequate for the analysis of transient signals. WT overcomes the main drawback of STFT, but its capabilities are often significantly degraded under noisy conditions [7, 20]. The GWT [23] has disadvantages of <b>cross-term</b> <b>interference</b> and heavy computational loads. Additionally, it must satisfy a synchronized sampling constraint [6]. The HHT leads to endpoint contamination during empirical mode decomposition, and is easily influenced by noise superimposed on signals [6, 24]. The ST [25] has the ability to detect disturbances under noisy conditions, but its computational demands are too high. Additionally, the Gaussian window function of the ST is inflexible. The KF [26] is the most popular parameter estimation method, but it cannot indicate the exact locations of transient PQDs. Furthermore, the KF trace has a delay in response to transient PQDs [6]. The STF [6], which is an enhancement of the KF, is also a parameter estimation method.|$|R
40|$|IntroductionTo realize noninvasive {{diagnosis}} and early diagnosis of coronary heart disease, the study proposes a new time-frequency method for analyzing heart sound signals. This method {{is based on}} Choi-Williams Distribution (CWD). MethodsCWD distribution is developed and modified from Wigner Ville distribution (WVD). To {{solve the problem of}} <b>cross-term</b> <b>interference</b> existing in WVD there is an improved version of WVD, called Choi-Williams Distribution (CWD), which introduces the smoothing window as the kernel function and deals with the time-frequency analysis of heart sound signal. ResultsThe improved method has good performance and can be implemented simply without much increase of operation complexity. ConclusionIn this paper, 21 cases of heart sound signals are acquired from the outpatients and hospitalized patients with coronary heart diseases. The research results of 21 cases show that the CWD method can be used to analyze heart sounds. It accurately identifies the 9 cases of heart sounds of health people and 12 cases of heart sounds of patients with coronary heart disease. Besides, the CWD displays obvious differences between heart sounds of healthy people and abnormal heart sounds. The contour line of heart sounds from healthy people shows the following characteristics: concise, columnar and non-divergence; while the contour line of abnormal heart sounds is divergent and has many columnar links. These research shows that CWD method can effectively distinguish heart sounds between healthy people and patients with coronary heart disease...|$|R
40|$|The Smoothed Pseudo Wigner-Ville Distribution (SPWVD) is {{one method}} to {{simultaneously}} resolve time series in both time and frequency domains, allowing determination of frequency variation with time in non-stationary signals. Also, SPWVD reduces the <b>cross-term</b> <b>interference.</b> This analysis {{was applied to}} stacked, migrated seismic reflection data from Ohio to characterize gas shadows produced by known and potential gas reservoirs in the Clinton interval. In northeast Ohio, the Clinton interval is identified as occurring immediately beneath the Dayton Limestone, which {{is known as the}} driller’s Packer Shell in the subsurface. The analysis was first applied to a seismic reflection line acquired from the East Dominion Ohio Gas Storage field that contained an example of a gas shadow. This analysis demonstrated that all frequencies were attenuated at otherwise continuous reflectors immediately beneath a portion of the Clinton interval fully charged with natural gas. There was no enhancement of low frequencies such as described in low frequency shadows from the Gulf of Mexico. This analysis was applied to other seismic lines acquired in areas where natural gas is produced from the Clinton interval and areas of possible natural gas attenuation were identified. In this work, low frequencies are not enhanced beneath the potential gas reservoir. To be successful, this method requires that continuous reflectors occur beneath the target horizon. Simple attenuation of signal from a continuous reflector may be a new direct indicator of natural gas on seismic reflection data from Ohio and other Paleozoic basins...|$|R
30|$|The {{nonparametric methods}} of time-frequency {{analysis}} described above can be contrasted with parametric approaches which attempt {{to model the}} underlying signal [32, 33]. There has been much debate as to the ideal choice of basis functions to use. Generally speaking, the more similar the basis function is to the signal, the more compact is the decomposition. Many biological signals {{can be thought of}} as a sum of more elementary components each of which are relatively narrowband in nature. Common examples include speech which consist of a number of formant frequencies illustrating the resonance of the vocal tract. In such a case, chirplets (or chirp signals of limited time extent) {{can be thought of as}} a good model of the underlying signal—any narrowband changes in instantaneous frequency can be described mathematically to first order by linear changes in the time-frequency plane [34 – 36]. We have been working on ways to decompose biological signals into a sum of chirplets [37]. A time-frequency representation can be obtained from the decomposition by summing up the individual contributions from each chirplet. This provides a clear time-frequency picture of the signal without the <b>cross-term</b> <b>interference.</b> While we have found that this method yields excellent visualization of biomedical signals, there are some significant challenges to overcome because chirplets do not form an orthogonal basis set. In some earlier work, we used matching pursuit to carry out the decomposition process which we found to be prohibitive in terms of computational cost. There is a need to find improved ways to carry out this analysis.|$|R

Firstly, using the properties of FRFT and mask processing, Multi-component LFM sig-nals are filtered and demodulated {{into a number of}} stationary single frequency signals. Then the one-dimensional (1 -D) direction estimation of LFM signals can be achieved by combining with the tradi-tional spectrum search method in the fractional Fourier (FRF) domain. As for the multi-component LFM signals, there is no <b>cross-term</b> <b>interference,</b> the mean square error (MSE) and Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) are also analyzed which perfects the method theoretically, simulation results are provided to show the validity of our method. The proposed algorithm is also extended to the uniform circular array (UCA), which realizes the two-dimensional (2 -D) estimation. Using the characteristics of time-frequency rotation and demodulation of FRFT, the observed LFM signals are demodulated into a series of single frequency ones; secondly, operate the beam-space mapping to the single frequency signals in FRF domain, which UCA in array space is changed into the virtual uniform circular array (ULA) in mode space; finally, the DOA estimation can be realized by the traditional spectral estimation method. Compared with other method, the complex time-frequency cluster and the parameter matching computation are avoided; meanwhile enhances the esti-mation precision by a certain extent. The proposed algorithm can also be used in the multi-path and Doppler frequency shift complex channel, which expands its application scope. In a word, a demodulated DOA esti-mation algorithm is proposed and is applied to 1 -D and 2 -D angle estimation by dint of ULA and UCA re-spectively.
