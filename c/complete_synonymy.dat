40|$|Graduation date: 1974 A biosystematic {{study was}} made on the species of Hackelia of {{northwest}} America and adjacent Canada. During {{the course of the}} study 140 populations, representing all species and varieties, were transplanted to the greenhouse for study under controlled conditions. Chromosome counts were made for all 14 taxa studied, and intra- and interspecific hybridizations were attempted. For the study over 3000 specimens were borrowed from 21 herbaria in the United States and Canada. Only two chromosome levels were found: 2 n= 24 and 2 n= 48. Chromosome counts were obtained only from mitotic cell divisions, as some difficulty was encountered in making usable pollen-mother cell smears. This was especially true in the tetraploids, where normal chemical techniques for fixation of buds resulted in the chromosomes tending to stick together. Because none of the species have chromosome numbers higher than tetraploid, it was felt that polyploidy, although present, has not been a dominant evolutionary mechanism in this section of the genus. The tetraploid taxa under study probably evolved from one or two original tetraploid ancestors which underwent speciation during the Quaternary period. It was found that nutlet features were of limited value as taxonomic characters in some species of Hackelia. The nutlets of some species are highly variable with regard to surface texture, number and size of intramarginal prickles, and the length and degree of fusion of the marginal prickles, The features of the fornix of the corolla are also variable and must be used with care. The distinctness of the tetraploid taxa is maintained in part by their specific habitat requirements. They occur principally in open sites with rocky to sandy soil, where plant competition is minimal.

40|$|The Oriental, Australasian and Oceanian genus Caiusa Surcouf, 1920 is revised, species {{concepts}} being {{based on}} {{male and female}} genitalia. A key to males for all known species, and a key to females for all except one are given. All relevant types still in existence have been studied, <b>complete</b> <b>synonymies</b> given and the geographical distribution reconsidered. The eight species included in the genus are: Caiusa borneoensis sp. nov.

(Thailand); Caiusa testacea Senior-White, 1923 (India, Nepal, Sri Lanka) and Caiusa violacea Séguy, 1925, stat. rev. (Cambodia, China, Laos, Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam). A lectotype is designated for Caiusa indica to fix {{the interpretation of the}} name. Caiusa nigronitens Senior-White, 1923, syn. nov. and Caiusa surcoufi Bezzi, 1927, syn. nov. are established as junior synonyms of Caiusa indica. Caiusa violacea is correctly diagnosed and errors in the original description of the female holotype are pointed out. Caiusa dubiosa Villeneuve, 1927 is established as a junior synonym of C. violacea, syn. nov. Seven Caiusa species have been reared from the egg mass of various species of frogs. The reproductive mode of the eighth species, i. e., C. indica, is unknown. Five species, i. e., C. borneoensis, C. coomani, C. karrakerae, C. kurahashii and C. violacea have been reared from {{one or more of the}} foam nesting frog species Chiromantis nongkhorensis (Cochran, 1927), Polypedates leucomystax (Gravenhorst, 1927), Polypedates megacephalus Hallowell, 1861, Rhacophorus annamensis Smith, 1924, Rhacophorus dulitensis Boulenger, 1892, Rhacophorus kio Ohler & Delorme, 2005 and Rhacophorus owstoni (Stejneger, 1907) all belonging in the family Rhacophoridae in Anura. These five Caiusa species all have a specialised ovipositor tip, with small spine-like setae on the ST 8 and the hypoproct, probably enabling the flies to oviposit on a foam nest with a hardened outer surface. They form a monophyletic group on account of these features of the ovipositor, unique in the Oestroidea. The sixth species, C. testacea, has been reared from a frog egg mass, the frog species being unknown. Its ovipositor structure is also unknown. The seventh species, C. pooae, has been reared once from the jelly-like egg mass of Feihyla hansenae (Cochran, 1927), also in Rhacophoridae. Caiusa pooae females do not have spine-like setae on the ovipositor, a fact correlated with the soft outer surface of the jelly-like egg mass on which a C. pooae female had oviposited. The extreme rarity of C. pooae oviposition on Feihyla hansenae egg masses may indicate that this fly perhaps has another, unknown, regular oviposition substrate. Caiusa pooae and C. indica make up a second monophyletic group within Caiusa. Caiusa indica, the most common and most widespread species of the genus, has an ovipositor structure similar to C. pooae. Its breeding substrate is unknown and it occurs both within and outside the distributional area of Rhacophoridae. Possibly both C. indica and C. pooae share a regular oviposition substrate that has still to be discovered. The holotype female of Plinthomyia emimelania Rondani, 1875 from Sarawak is established as a member of the genus Bengalia Robineau-Desvoidy, 1830, thus Plinthomyia Rondani, 1875 becomes a junior synonym of Bengalia Robineau-Desvoidy, 1830, syn. nov.

Chilensia comprises 11 taxa. In sect. Andina, G. brevicaule andG. parodii, previously considered as synonyms or recognized as infraspecific taxa, are accepted at species level. In contrast, G. tucumanum, G. sessiliflorum ssp. novaezelandiae and 17 other taxa have been reduced to synonyms. In sect. Chilensia, G. patagonicum, G. fiebrigianum and G. drumondii have been considered as synonyms of G. berteroanum, G. fallax and G. solanderi, respectively. Additionally, another 24 taxa have been reduced to synonyms. Diagnostic morphological features are analysed and compared within and between the sections. A multivariate morphometric study from 258 specimens was carried out to test the most significant characters. The chromosome number of six species (five never previously counted) was established. A key, species descriptions, a <b>complete</b> list of <b>synonymy,</b> a list of specimens examined and distribution maps are provided. Most species are illustrated for the first time. Thirty-seven lectotypes and one neotype are designated. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|A {{revision}} of Sherbournia G. Don is given, based mainly {{on a study}} of the herbarium specimens at BATA, BM, BR, BRLU, K, LBV, MO, P, SCA, WAG and YA. The general part gives a survey {{of the history of the}} genus and comments upon fruit morphology. The distribution maps of the species show the characteristic pattern of a strictly Guineo-Congolian genus. The taxonomic part gives keys and <b>complete</b> species treatments (<b>synonymies,</b> descriptions, distributional data, critical notes). The detailed examination of the specimens resulted in one novelty: Sherbournia batesii (Wernham) Hepper subsp. kivuensis Pauwels & Sonké. Some taxonomic changes are made: Sherbournia streptocaulon (K. Schum.) Hepper var. situtunga N. Hallé should not be maintened as a variety. Sherbournia bignoniiflora (Welw.) Hua var. brazzaei N. Hallé, Amaralia palustris Wernham and Amaralia ekotokicola Wernham are synonymous with Sherbournia bignoniiflora (Welw.) Hua. The subdivison of S. hapalophylla (Wernham) Hepper is reconsidered and two subspecies are proposed in stead of three varieties: S. hapalophylla subsp. hapalophylla and S. hapalophylla subsp. wernhamiana (N. Hallé) Sonké & Pauwels. According to those changes, S. hapalophylla var. henrihuana N. Hallé is put into synonymy with S. hapalophylla subsp. hapalophylla. © 2005 National Botanic Garden of Belgium.
