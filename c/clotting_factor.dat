5|$|Symptomatic {{carriers}} of the gene, while not hemophiliacs themselves, can have symptoms of hemophilia including a {{lower than normal}} blood <b>clotting</b> <b>factor</b> {{that can lead to}} heavy bleeding. DNA testing on the remains of the royal family proved conclusively in 2009 that Alexei suffered from Hemophilia B, a rarer form of the disease. His mother and one sister, identified alternatively as Maria or Anastasia, were carriers. Therefore, had Anastasia lived to have children of her own, they may have been afflicted by the disease as well. Alexei's hemophilia was chronic and incurable; his frequent attacks caused permanent disability.|$|E
5|$|Maria, {{like her}} mother, was likely a carrier of the {{hemophilia}} gene {{and might have}} passed on the disease to another generation if she had survived to have the children she dreamed of. One of Alexandra's brothers and two of her nephews, {{as well as one}} of her maternal uncles and two children of one of her first cousins were all hemophiliacs, as was Maria's brother Alexei. Maria herself reportedly hemorrhaged in December 1914 during an operation to remove her tonsils, according to her paternal aunt Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia, who was interviewed later in her life. The doctor performing the operation was so unnerved that he had to be ordered to continue by Maria's mother, Tsarina Alexandra. Olga Alexandrovna said she believed all four of her nieces bled more than was normal and believed they were carriers of the hemophilia gene like their mother. Symptomatic carriers of the gene, while not hemophiliacs themselves, can have symptoms of hemophilia including a lower than normal blood <b>clotting</b> <b>factor</b> that can lead to heavy bleeding during childbirth or surgical procedures such as a tonsillectomy. DNA testing on the remains of the royal family proved in 2009 that Alexei suffered from hemophilia B, a rarer form of the disease. The same testing proved that his mother and one of the four Grand Duchesses were carriers. Russians identify the grand duchess who carried the gene as Anastasia, but American scientists identified the young woman as Maria.|$|E
25|$|Deficiency of Vitamin K {{may also}} {{contribute}} to bleeding disorders because <b>clotting</b> <b>factor</b> maturation depends on Vitamin K.|$|E
50|$|Blood is {{centrifuged}} {{to remove}} cellular components. Anti-coagulated blood yields plasma containing fibrinogen and <b>clotting</b> <b>factors.</b> Coagulated blood (<b>clotted</b> blood) yields serum without fibrinogen, although some <b>clotting</b> <b>factors</b> remain.|$|R
25|$|Deficiencies of {{platelet}} function may require platelet transfusion while deficiencies of <b>clotting</b> <b>factors</b> may require transfusion of either {{fresh frozen plasma}} or specific <b>clotting</b> <b>factors,</b> such as Factor VIII for patients with hemophilia.|$|R
50|$|Complications of hemoperfusion {{may include}} thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, hypoglycemia, and some {{reduction}} in <b>clotting</b> <b>factors,</b> with recovery typically occurring in 1-2 days. Risk of bleeding is also higher {{because of high}} heparin dose and reduction in platelets and <b>clotting</b> <b>factors.</b>|$|R
25|$|In 1992, the FDA {{approved}} Factor VIII produced using transgenic Chinese hamster ovary cells, {{the first}} such blood <b>clotting</b> <b>factor</b> produced using recombinant DNA technology to be approved.|$|E
25|$|Non-infectious {{diseases}} {{that may result}} in symptoms {{similar to those of}} EVD include acute promyelocytic leukemia, hemolytic uremic syndrome, snake envenomation, <b>clotting</b> <b>factor</b> deficiencies/platelet disorders, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, Kawasaki disease, and warfarin poisoning.|$|E
25|$|Donated {{blood is}} usually {{subjected}} to processing {{after it is}} collected, to make it suitable for use in specific patient populations. Collected blood is then separated into blood components by centrifugation: red blood cells, plasma, platelets, albumin protein, <b>clotting</b> <b>factor</b> concentrates, cryoprecipitate, fibrinogen concentrate, and immunoglobulins (antibodies). Red cells, plasma and platelets can also be donated individually via a more complex process called apheresis.|$|E
50|$|The normal {{clotting}} process {{depends on}} the interplay of various proteins in the blood. Coagulopathy {{may be caused by}} reduced levels or absence of blood-clotting proteins, known as <b>clotting</b> <b>factors</b> or coagulation factors. Genetic disorders, such as hemophilia and Von Willebrand's disease, can cause a reduction in <b>clotting</b> <b>factors.</b>|$|R

500|$|Despite his {{occasional}} misbehavior, Olga, {{like all}} her family, doted on the long-awaited heir Tsarevich Alexei, or [...] "Baby". The little boy suffered frequent attacks of hemophilia and nearly died several times. Like their mother, Olga {{and her three}} sisters were also potentially carriers of the hemophilia gene. Olga's younger sister Maria reportedly hemorrhaged in December 1914 during an operation to remove her tonsils, according to her paternal aunt Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia, who was interviewed later in her life. The doctor performing the operation was so unnerved {{that he had to}} be ordered to continue by Tsarina Alexandra. Olga Alexandrovna said she believed all four of her nieces bled more than was normal and believed they were carriers of the hemophilia gene like their mother, who inherited the trait from her maternal grandmother Queen Victoria. Symptomatic carriers of the gene, while not haemophiliacs themselves, can have symptoms of hemophilia including a lower than normal blood <b>clotting</b> <b>factor</b> that can lead to heavy bleeding.|$|E
2500|$|Also in October {{researchers}} {{reported that they}} had treated six haemophilia sufferers in early 2011 using an adeno-associated virus. [...] Over two years later all six were producing <b>clotting</b> <b>factor.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{first human}} blood <b>clotting</b> <b>factor</b> to be {{produced}} in significant quantities using recombinant DNA technology was Factor IX, which was produced using transgenic Chinese hamster ovary cells in 1986. [...] Lacking {{a map of the}} human genome, researchers obtained a known sequence of the RNA for Factor IX by examining the amino acids in Factor IX:Microsequencing of highly purified... yielded sufficient amino acid sequence to construct oligonucleotide probes.|$|E
5000|$|Prevention {{may occur}} by {{removing}} an egg, fertilizing it, and testing the embryo before transferring {{it to the}} uterus. Treatment is by replacing the missing blood <b>clotting</b> <b>factors.</b> This may be done {{on a regular basis}} or during bleeding episodes. Replacement may take place at home or in hospital. The <b>clotting</b> <b>factors</b> are made either from human blood or by recombinant methods. Up to 20% of people develop antibodies to the <b>clotting</b> <b>factors</b> which makes treatment more difficult. The medication desmopressin may be used in those with mild haemophilia A. Studies of gene therapy are in early human trials.|$|R
50|$|<b>Clotting</b> <b>factors</b> {{are usually}} not needed in mild haemophilia. In {{moderate}} haemophilia <b>clotting</b> <b>factors</b> are typically only needed when bleeding occurs or to prevent bleeding with certain events. In severe haemophilia preventive use is often recommended {{two or three times}} a week and may continue for life. Rapid treatment of bleeding episodes decreases damage to the body.|$|R
50|$|The {{parasite}} also causes coagulopathies. Haematomas {{and prolonged}} bleeding {{are as a}} result of thrombocytopaenia (where <b>clotting</b> <b>factors</b> are decreased due to them binding to antigen - antibody complexes). <b>Clotting</b> <b>factors</b> V and VIII are also reduced. Hypochromic anaemia is another symptom, also used in diagnosis and is due to the parasite interfering with haemoglobin synthesis.|$|R
2500|$|A {{blood product}} (or blood-based product) is any {{component}} of blood which is collected from a donor {{for use in}} a blood transfusion. Blood transfusions can be life-saving in some situations, such as massive blood loss due to trauma, or can be used to replace blood lost during surgery. Blood transfusions may also be used to treat a severe anaemia or thrombocytopenia caused by a blood disease. People with hemophilia usually need a replacement of <b>clotting</b> <b>factor,</b> which is a small part of whole blood. [...] People with sickle-cell disease may require frequent blood transfusions. [...] Early blood transfusions consisted of whole blood, but modern medical practice commonly uses only components of the blood, such as fresh frozen plasma or cryoprecipitate.|$|E
2500|$|Hereditary {{angioedema}} (HAE) {{exists in}} three forms, {{all of which}} are caused by a genetic mutation inherited in an autosomal dominant form. They are distinguished by the underlying genetic abnormality. Types I and II are caused by mutations in the SERPING1 gene, which result in either diminished levels of the C1-inhibitor protein (type I HAE) or dysfunctional forms of the same protein (type II HAE). Type III HAE has been linked with mutations in the F12 gene, which encodes the coagulation protein factor XII. All forms of HAE lead to abnormal activation of the complement system, and all forms can cause swelling elsewhere in the body, such as the digestive tract. If HAE involves the larynx, it can cause life-threatening asphyxiation. The pathogenesis of this disorder is suspected to be related to unopposed activation of the contact pathway by the initial generation of kallikrein and/or <b>clotting</b> <b>factor</b> XII by damaged endothelial cells. The end product of this cascade, bradykinin, is produced in large amounts and {{is believed to be the}} predominant mediator leading to increased vascular permeability and vasodilation that induces typical angioedema [...] "attacks".|$|E
50|$|Haemophilia A, is a {{recessive}} X-linked {{genetic disorder}} {{resulting in a}} deficiency of functional <b>clotting</b> <b>Factor</b> VIII. Haemophilia B, is also a recessive X-linked genetic disorder involving a lack of functional <b>clotting</b> <b>Factor</b> IX. Haemophilia C, is an autosomal genetic disorder involving a lack of functional <b>clotting</b> <b>Factor</b> XI. Haemophilia C is not completely recessive, as heterozygous individuals also show increased bleeding.|$|E

50|$|One of the {{functions}} of von Willebrand factor (vWF) is {{to serve as a}} carrier of <b>clotting</b> <b>factor</b> VIII (FVIII). The native conformation of the D' domain of vWF is not only required for factor VIII (FVIII) binding but also for normal multimerisation and optimal secretion. The interaction between blood <b>clotting</b> <b>factor</b> VIII and VWF is necessary for normal survival of blood <b>clotting</b> <b>factor</b> VIII in blood circulation.
