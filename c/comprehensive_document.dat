2500|$|On October 22, 1924, a {{group of}} Fisk {{students}} provided the Board of Trustees a list of grievances against McKenzie, culminating with the call [...] "for the severing of Fayette McKenzie from the presidency of Fisk and for a system of alumni representation {{on the board of}} trustees." [...] The students charged McKenzie with deception and [...] "making every effort to increase the power and influences of the White South at Fisk and catering to southern white prejudices." [...] They also charged McKenzie of [...] "unjust and unreasonable" [...] discipline and suppression of student initiative and opinion [...] On November 11, 1924, Fisk students caused minor disturbances on campus, disrupting chapel by dropping their books on the floor, and shouting [...] "Du Bois!" [...] throughout the campus. That evening the disturbance grew in intensity as students littered dormitory hallways with trash, destroyed property, and created sufficient noise that it was heard several blocks from campus. After two hours of student protest, Professor Talley, a Black faculty member, appealed for calm, and the students soon went to bed. The following day, rumors swirled about students' [...] "intention of systematic destruction." [...] When informed of the rumors, Dr. Jefferson, another Black faculty member, visited the boys dormitory, and [...] "by his mere presence brought instant and continuous order and quiet." [...] At a meeting of faculty and administrators to discuss the situation, some felt that stronger authority was needed to deal with the issue. The campus calm was short lived. When the Board of Trustees arrived in Nashville in late November 1924 for its regular meeting, the trustees witnessed a demonstration of nearly one hundred students beating tin pans and chanting [...] "Away with the czar!" [...] and [...] "Down with [...] the tyrant!" [...] As part of the board meeting, McKenzie invited the senior class and a committee of students to present their grievances. George W. Streator, leader of the student committee, presented the trustees with a statement containing eleven points, a more <b>comprehensive</b> <b>document</b> than the list of grievances the students submitted to the board the previous month. The revised version included several new requests, including implementing an athletic association, Greek letter societies, and a student newspaper. Although the trustees met with the students and promised to evaluate their concerns, they not surprisingly dismissed most student demands, although McKenzie did loosen the dress code slightly. To address the unrest, the trustees formed The Greater Fisk Committee to help provide leadership in mobilizing alumni support for the University. In addition to several Fisk alumni, the Committee consisted of McKenzie and three trustees: Kate Trawick, J.C. Napier (a Fisk alumnus) and L. Hollingsworth Wood.|$|E
