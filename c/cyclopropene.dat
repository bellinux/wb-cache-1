40|$|Bioorthogonal {{chemical}} {{reporters are}} small functional groups {{that can be}} metabolically incorporated into biomolecules by the cell’s native metabolic machinery. These moieties can be covalently modified with probes for detection or isolation. I applied this strategy to profile glycoproteins in Toxoplasma gondii, a prevalent intracellular parasite that infects nearly one-third of the world's population and may cause life-threatening conditions in immunocompromised patients. Using the bioorthogonal chemical reporter strategy, I identified a large, diverse set of glycosylated proteins in T. gondii including some previously unannotated proteins likely involved in modulating host-parasite interactions. In addition to glycosylated structures, parasites and host cells exchange numerous other metabolites. Simultaneous monitoring of these communication pathways requires multiple cell-compatible reactions {{that can be used}} concurrently, or “mutually orthogonal” bioorthogonal chemistries. Unfortunately, the existing toolbox of bioorthogonal chemistries is rather sparse, limiting our ability to look at multiple biomolecules in tandem. As part of Prescher lab, I have contributed to the development of novel chemical reporters for simultaneous profiling of host-pathogen crosstalk. My labmates and I established a new bioorthogonal chemical reaction—a cycloaddition between 1, 3 -disubstituted <b>cyclopropenes</b> and tetrazines—that can be used in living systems. Excitingly, this reaction can be used in tandem with common azide-alkyne chemistries for multi-component imaging.

Both of these molecules harbor unique reaction preferences, enabling them to be used simultaneously. This was noteworthy result, since the structures of these <b>cyclopropenes</b> only differ by the placement of a single methyl group. I also developed another orthogonal chemical reporter for use in multi-component applications: methylene cyclopropane. This molecule exhibits unique cycoaddition reactivities and is poised to join the ranks of useful chemical reporters...|$|R

The hydrogen shifts in cyclopentadienes have a diatropic ring currents indicating aromatic, cyclopentadienide anion character. This result stands {{in contrast to the}} fluorine shift in 5 - fluorocyclopentadiene which requires much more energy, and has a paratropic ring current in the TS pointing to antiaromatic, cyclopentadienyl cation character. [1, 3] hydrogen shifts in <b>cyclopropenes</b> are very difficult, passing through transition states that have an extended C-C bond. For 3 -fluorocyclopropene the [1, 3] fluorine shift is much easier than the hydrogen shift. For 7 -fluorocycloheptatriene the [1, 7] hydrogen shift is predicted, but requires very high energy and has a paratropic ring current and antiaromatic character. The [1, 7] suprafacial fluorine shift is relatively easy, having a TS with cycloheptatrienyl cation character. Patterns of currents, and the reversal for H and F migration, are rationalized by orbital analysis based on the ipsocentric method.
