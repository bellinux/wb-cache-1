In 1990, the Georgia Music Hall of Fame Authority was created as an instrumentality of the State of Georgia and a public corporation with the stated <b>corporate</b> <b>purpose</b> and general nature: 1) to construct and maintain a facility to house the Georgia Music Hall of Fame; 2) to operate, advertise and promote the Georgia Music Hall of Fame; and 3) to promote music events at the facility and throughout the state.

40|$|This {{comparative}} analysis of India’s move toward redefining <b>corporate</b> <b>purpose</b> proceeds as follow. Part I presents {{an overview of}} global debates over <b>corporate</b> <b>purpose,</b> drawing principally from the move toward the ESV model in the U. K. and benefit corporations in the U. S. This section briefly recounts the debates in both jurisdictions about whether the changes they have experienced will engender more socially responsible corporations.

In Part II, this Article takes a broad approach toward analyzing the Act and argues that the various provisions of the Act demonstrate a move toward broader <b>corporate</b> <b>purpose.</b> In Part III, this Article argues that despite the goals of Indian law makers in passing the Companies Act, there are serious shortcomings in the law as it pushes toward a pluralistic stakeholder oriented purpose. Part III identifies several structural challenges that {{stand in the way of}} a move toward companies that truly are responsible to a wide variety of constituencies, including vagueness in the legislation, promoter-dominated ownership structures, ineffective institutional framework to support enforcement efforts by stakeholders generally, and weaknesses in the judiciary. These challenges suggest that India’s experiment with <b>corporate</b> <b>purpose</b> is one that is uncertain to succeed...|$|E
