5|$|Though the {{producers}} decided that Friday the 13th {{would not be}} an origin story, they said that they wanted to work out a logical origin story for Jason that would provide a sense of history as the film progressed. Form and Fuller explained that the audience gets to see how Jason attains his famous hockey mask, and is given a reason for why he puts it on. Jason would transition from wearing a bag over his head—similar to the one seen in Friday the 13th Part 2—to finding and wearing his hockey mask, whereas in Friday the 13th Part III he obtains the mask off-screen and <b>comes</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> barn already wearing it.|$|E

25|$|Cotton mills get {{the cotton}} shipped {{to them in}} large, 500 pound bales. When the cotton <b>comes</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bale, it is all packed {{together}} and still contains vegetable matter. The bale is broken open using a machine with large spikes. It is called an Opener. In order to fluff up the cotton and remove the vegetable matter, the cotton is sent through a picker, or similar machines. The cotton is fed into a machine known as a picker, and gets beaten with a beater bar in order to loosen it up. It is fed through various rollers, which serve to remove the vegetable matter. The cotton, aided by fans, then collects on a screen and gets fed through more rollers till it emerges as a continuous soft fleecy sheet, known as a lap.|$|E

500|$|Arthur Schopenhauer (1788–1860) {{developed}} {{a philosophy that}} contains a principle notably {{similar to that of}} Hobbes's conatus. This principle, Wille zum Leben, or [...] "Will to Live", described the specific phenomenon of an organism's self-preservation instinct. Schopenhauer qualified this, however, by suggesting that the Will to Live is not limited in duration. Rather, [...] "the will wills absolutely and for all time", across generations. Friedrich Nietzsche (1844–1900), an early disciple of Schopenhauer, {{developed a}} separate principle which <b>comes</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> rejection of the primacy of Schopenhauer's Will to Live and other notions of self-preservation. He called his version the Will to Power, or Wille zur Macht.|$|E
500|$|Frank Spotnitz, {{the writer}} of the episode, was {{inspired}} to write the episode after a rafting trip. During the trip, Spotnitz met a [...] "friend of a friend," [...] who constantly mentioned an [...] "image that freaked him out." [...] The man explained that the image was a tube of toothpaste that, when opened, would have [...] "blood come out." [...] The mental image intrigued Spotnitz, who later postulated, [...] "How could you create a story where blood <b>comes</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tube of toothpaste?" [...] Due to the strangeness of the idea, Spotnitz was unable to think of any real-world scenarios having likeness to the image, so he began to look into [...] "dreams and nightmares." [...] He eventually {{came up with the}} idea of a cult trying to reach a higher plane of existence, but instead stumbling into a [...] "lower place, a darker plane." [...] Spotnitz later explained: [...] "What if the higher plane is a darker plane, what if we think we're reaching up but we're reaching down." [...] Complementarily, the episode's title, [...] "Via Negativa," [...] means [...] "Negative Way" [...] in Latin. [...] This type of theology, more commonly referred to as apophatic theology, attempts to describe God by expanding upon what God is not.|$|E

2500|$|At {{its peak}} in 1923, A.B.C. had 150 branch shops in London and 250 tea shops and was second in terms of outlets only to J. Lyons and Co. This {{proliferation}} led George Orwell to view A.B.C.'s tea shops, and those of its competitors, as the [...] "sinister strand in English catering, the relentless industrialisation that was overtaking it...everything <b>comes</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> carton or a tin, or is hauled out of a refrigerator or squirted out of a tap or squeezed out of a tube." ...|$|E
2500|$|In practice, {{the current}} density mainly <b>comes</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> group of states close in energy to state F, {{most of which}} lie within the heavily shaded area in the energy-space diagram. Since, for a free-electron model, the {{contribution}} to the current density is directly proportional to the area in energy space (with the Sommerfeld supply density zS as the constant of proportionality), {{it is useful to}} think of the ECD as drawn from electron states in an area of size dF2 (measured in eV2) in the energy-space diagram. That is, it is useful to think of the ECD as drawn from states in the heavily shaded area in Fig. 1. (This approximation gets slowly worse as temperature increases.) ...|$|E
2500|$|For {{some time}} Mahal thought of {{pursuing}} farming over music. He {{had developed a}} passion for farming that nearly rivaled his love of music—coming {{to work on a}} farm first at age 16. It was a dairy farm in Palmer, Massachusetts, not far from Springfield. By age nineteen he had become farm foreman, getting up a bit after 4:00a.m. and running the place. [...] "I milked anywhere between thirty-five and seventy cows a day. I clipped udders. I grew corn. I grew Tennessee redtop clover. Alfalfa." [...] Mahal believes in growing one's own food, saying, [...] "You have a whole generation of kids who think everything <b>comes</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> box and a can, and they don't know you can grow most of your food." [...] Because of his personal support of the family farm, Mahal regularly performs at Farm Aid concerts.|$|E

2500|$|Dillard and Longman {{in their}} Introduction to the Old Testament stress the living {{nature of the}} {{covenant}} between Yahweh and Israel as a nation: [...] The people of Israel are addressed by Moses as a unity, and [...] their allegiance to the covenant {{is not one of}} obeisance, but <b>comes</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pre-existing relationship between God and Israel, established with Abraham and attested to by the Exodus event, so that the laws of Deuteronomy set the nation of Israel apart, signaling the unique status of the Jewish nation. The land is God's gift to Israel, and many of the laws, festivals and instructions in Deuteronomy are given in the light of Israel's occupation of the land. Dillard and Longman note that [...] "In 131 of the 167 times the verb [...] "give" [...] occurs in the book, the subject of the action is Yahweh." [...] Deuteronomy makes the Torah the ultimate authority for Israel, one to which even the king is subject.|$|E
2500|$|The {{introductory}} prose to {{the poem}} Rígsþula says that [...] "people {{say in the}} old stories" [...] that Heimdallr, described as a god among the Æsir, once fared on a journey. Heimdallr wandered along a seashore, and referred to himself as Rígr. In the poem, Rígr, who {{is described as a}} wise and powerful god, walks in the middle of roads on his way to steads, where he meets a variety of couples and dines with them, giving them advice and spending three nights at a time between them in their bed. The wives of the couples become pregnant, and from them come the various classes of humanity. Eventually a warrior home produces a promising boy, and as the boy grows older, Rígr <b>comes</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> thicket, teaches the boy runes, gives him a name, and proclaims him to be his son. Rígr tells him to strike out and get land for himself. The boy does so, and so becomes a great war leader with many estates. He marries a beautiful woman and the two have many children and are happy. One of the children eventually becomes so skilled that he is able to share in runic knowledge with Heimdallr, and so earns the title of Rígr himself. The poem continues without further mention of the god.|$|E

60|$|First, That {{there is}} such a property, may be proved from this, that the parts of the Air are some of them more condens'd, others more rarified, either by the differing heat, or differing {{pressure}} it sustains, or by the somewhat heterogeneous vapours interspers'd through it. For as the Air is more or less rarified, so does it more or less refract a ray of light (that <b>comes</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> denser medium) from the perpendicular.
