40|$|This paper {{describes}} the European Data Grid’s (EDG’s) java security system and Spitfire database access system giving {{special emphasis on}} the virtual organization technologies. These technologies create a feasible framework for authentication and authorization in distributed Grid applications. A virtual organization (VO) {{is a collection of}} people in the same administrative domain. A user can belong to many virtual organizations and have a different role (user, <b>client,</b> <b>administrator,</b> [...] ) in each of them. An authorization of a user to different services within a VO is based on the user’s identity and a service called a Virtual Organization Membership Service (VOMS) that maps these identities with roles. The user proves his identity over the internet using authentication process. The user normally authenticates using his credentials, which comprise of a certificate chain and a private key. In Grid systems, the user usually authenticates using proxy credentials that are derived from the actual credentials. The proxy credentials comprise of the user’s certificate chain added with a proxy certificate and a proxy private key. In the proxy creation process, the user’s VO information, including groups and roles, is included into the proxy certificate. In order to use these proxy certificates with VO information we have created an authorization system and to demonstrate the usage we have extended the functionality Spitfire, a relational database front end. This involves assigning the user a database role (read, write, update [...] ) based on the VO information in his certificate. There is also a GUI for configuring the authorization service. The earth observation team’s database access for ozone profile validation is used here as an example of an application. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Services {{running in}} the cloud face threats from several parties, {{including}} malicious <b>clients,</b> <b>administrators,</b> and external attackers. CloudProxy is a recentlyproposed framework for secure deployment of cloud applications. In this work, we present the first formal model of CloudProxy, including a formal specification of desired security properties. We model CloudProxy as a transition system in the UCLID modeling language, using term-level abstraction. Our formal specification includes both safety and non-interference properties. We use induction to prove these properties, employing a back-end SMT-based verification engine. Further, we structure our proof as an “assurance case”, showing how we decompose the proof into various lemmas, and listing all assumptions and axioms employed. We also perform some limited model validation to gain assurance that the formal model correctly captures behaviors of the implementation. ...|$|R

40|$|Due to the {{uncertainty}} involved in many complex infrastructure engineering projects, {{it is not}} always possible for managers to establish detailed terms of reference at the departure. Although the flexibility of ‘open’ terms of reference is often indispensible, it makes the arrival at a successful outcome much of a gamble. Complex infrastructure construction projects often include the tension that the values and interests of clients and functional managers diverge or even contradict each other. This is especially evident when managing the project management values of time, cost, scope and quality in relation to each other while the results of trade-offs and decisions can not be predicted. <b>Client’s</b> <b>administrators</b> defend objectifiable, instrumental values, while functional managers have an interest in relaxing them in order to realise the project. If these two contradictory sets of interests are not recalibrated, either the values are not met, or trade-offs may be made in an uncontrolled way, which can lead to suboptimisations or even project failure. Using RandstadRail as an example, this paper will show the problems that may occur in such situations and how unmanageability arises. A few lessons are derived to provide entrance to better manageable practice. Multi Actor SystemsTechnology, Policy and Managemen...|$|R

As a TeraGrid resource provider and developers of Grid-enabled software, we experience both the <b>client</b> and system <b>administrator</b> perspectives of service hosting. We are using {{this point of view}} to integrate and deploy a managed hosting environment based on VM technology that fulfills the requirements of both developers and system administrators. The man-aged hosting environment provides the typical base benefits of any VM hosting technique, but provides additional software support for develop-ers and system monitoring opportunities for administrators.

40|$|Aspects of the Professional Role of the Landscape Architect - {{exemplified}} {{through the}} development of School Grounds The purpose of this thesis is to examine the professional role of the landscape architect. To reach this goal two research approaches were used. The first approach consisted of two case-studies of secondary schools involved in developing their school grounds with contracted landscape architects. The second approach was to bring together landscape architects in a focus group for a series of three discussions. During the case-studies, "Knowledge workshops", a method for participatory planning was applied and developed to include the school ground itself in the process. To understand the complexity of the various roles played by the professional landscape architect, the research questions this study addressed were: How do landscape architects perceive their professional role? How do landscape architects view their role in relation to colleagues, participants and/or <b>clients,</b> public <b>administrators</b> and funders? How does that role relate to school ground development processes? Empirical results from an analysis of data from the case-studies and the focus group provided a means to obtain a picture of the habitus of the landscape architect. It is apparent that the embodied history that the French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu describes plays an important part in determining how landscape architects function in challenging situations. When working under pressure landscape architects often fall back upon the familiar and well proven approaches they developed during their professional training and early practice. Study results indicated an uncertainty {{on the part of the}} landscape architect about how to use input provided by participants in the design process, which could cause problems when it comes to trying out new aesthetical and practical solutions and ideas. The study demonstrates that it may be difficult for a landscape architect to assess results of school ground participatory design processes which were often shown to have been derived from other, non-participatory ideals and role-models. This study suggests that the development of methods for evaluating participatory processes for landscape architects could have positive implications for the development of education in landscape architecture. The results of this study show that developing a working model and a professional consciousness of these dilemmas and of the determinants of decisions taken by landscape architects could lead to a broader understanding of the culture in which their professional values arise and are reproduced...|$|R

Currently, Virtual Reality and Virtual Environments are the most growing fields of information technology and have a great media attention. There is evidence to suggest that the use of such technology will enhance conceivable image of any proposed project at any urban setting for users, designers and clients. Therefore, city officials and <b>administrators</b> (<b>clients)</b> and the public (users) can reach better decisions regarding proposed projects within their towns and cities. Because of the limited time and resources, this study examines the visual quality of Downtown Al Ain, UAE, specifically, the Khalifa street (major shopping street). A basic VRmodel to the street was constructed. Modifications to the basic model were made to examine how changes in buildingsi heights and street vegetation affect the visual quality of the street. Results of this study showed that urban visualization is proving to be a valuable tool for designers and planners. Increasing the heights of buildings in the mid-street and on the edges, along with enforcing distinctive architectural styles for the proposed buildings will enhance the overall quality of the street. Furthermore, decreasing the intensity of current vegetation and tree heights will increase the imaginable quality of the street. Nevertheless, the built of a comprehend VR model needs more time, resources and facilities that were not available to this study. This model, if completed, tothe whole downtown area can be used both to identify existing problems and to quickly evaluate alternative solutions to those problems...|$|R

40|$|In Malaysian {{construction}} industry, traditional procurement {{method is}} the most common method of procuring a project. In this method, the client contracts with consultants, and has another separate contract with the contractor. Consultants will prepare building designs in accordance to their expertise. Meanwhile contractor will contract with the client to construct the building based on designs given. However, human made mistakes happen, where design defects exist in consultants’ design. Contractor during construction may discover design defects. But sadly, many contractors have a mindset that they are only contracted to construct, and any design defects is not their concern. Some may even intentionally keep silent about the discovery, so that they are able to claim for variation order for when rectification works are required to heal the problem caused by the design defect. Thus, the objective {{of this study is to}} identify whether contractor has the implied duty to warn design defects. The research methodology undertaken is by documentary analysis of law cases reported in law journals. The research have identified relevant clauses in the standard forms of contracts, and also eleven law cases related to contractor’s duty to warn design defects. The findings of the analysis are: Contractor owes duty of care to his client. He is expected to warn client of design defect if a reasonably competent contractor would have noticed it and highlight it to his client. Lastly, even if contractor has raised the discovery to his <b>client</b> or contract <b>administrator</b> and was instructed to continue to construct, the contractor will still be liable, as mere discussion of the risk will not release contractor from being responsible. Contractor should take formal and further steps to warn about the perceived dangers and even refusal to carry out the works...|$|R

Because of the multi-party involvement in the {{construction industry}} and complex in nature, parties are always prone to face numerous disputes in their journey while attempt to safeguard their respective interests. Once the disputes emerged amongst the parties, they seeks suitable ways to solve the disputes in an amicable manner to the parties however it is not always possible for them to reach such amicable solution while maintain the interest of the all parties. Compare with the other approaches available for dispute resolutions, negotiation said to be as easiest, very efficient and economical and less time consuming process. However, the negotiation in the Sri Lankan construction industry is an undesired process for the parties in disputes due to higher rate of its failures. This research were conducted to analyses disputes towards the effectiveness of negotiation in the Sri Lankan construction industry by identifying the causes for the positive and negative outcome of the negotiations and investigating the relationship between negotiation outcome to project characteristics, professionals involved in negotiation, time taken for negotiation, monitory value involved, and causes of dispute etc. Data was collected and analyzed using document analyses methodology using quantitative data analyses techniques respectively.

40|$|Abstract—Modern {{software}} {{systems are}} complex and increasingly vulnerable to malicious attack. In order to apply bug fixes and protect against security weaknesses, workstation administrators must continuously patch operating system and application program installations. To simplify this process, administrators generally configure systems into clusters with common installations of operating systems and application programs {{in a manner that}} patches and other routine maintenance can be applied en masse. Two widely used approaches offer complementary advantages: Installations and updates are particularly convenient when all data including operating system and programs is served by traditional centralized network-connected file servers (networked file systems) because administrators need only maintain a single image that is distributed online to all workstations. In contrast, operating systems and application programs can be installed onto disk drives within each workstation. This mass replication of common data provides high aggregate bandwidth through parallelism since each disk operates independently. However, in contrast to the network file system approach, it is substantially more difficult to keep a large network of systems up to date when each system has an autonomous installation. Through the aggressive use of cooperative file caching, we expect that sloth-NFS is will provide the advantages of both approaches. In this paper, we discuss the administrative problems with current distribution methods for program and operating system installations, analyze design decisions necessary in Sloth-NFS and present results from an initial simulator experiment. I. OVERVIEW Technical administrative costs are a major challenge for the modern enterprise. These costs are high, because many hours of administrator’s time are required to perform a large number of tasks related to basic system maintenance.
