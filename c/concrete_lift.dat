Data was obtained by conducting interviews and observations concerning casting implementation of building construction projects that use K- 300 ready- mix concrete.   Regression and Correlation analysis are used to obtain time and cost comparison between both method of casting implementation, as well as Break Even Point analysis to obtain breakeven point of casting volume with regards to cost and time. The analysis showed that casting productivities  using lift on  first, second and third floor  are 7, 166 m 3 /h, 5, 945 m 3 /h, 5, 125 m 3 /h, while the productivities using concrete pump on  first, second and third floor  are 36 m 3 /h, 30 m 3 /h, 24 m 3 /hour. Cost comparison of 1 m 3 increment of casting using <b>concrete</b> <b>lift</b> and concrete pump is  Rp. 99 330 : Rp. 19. 000 (5. 23 : 1),  while time ratio is  8. 272 minutes: 2, 172 minutes (3. 8 : 1).

40|$|Use of {{concrete}} filled steel tube columns {{is becoming increasingly}} popular in high rise buildings due to their composite action, superior strength, seismic and fire resistance capacities and construction simplicity. These composite columns and the reinforced <b>concrete</b> (RC) <b>lift</b> core in the framing systems of high rise buildings are commonly coupled with reinforced concrete outrigger and belt systems to facilitate lateral load resistance. Axial shortening (AS) of the vertical structural components due to time dependent phenomena of basic creep, shrinkage and elastic deformation, is a common problem in concrete high rise construction. The creep and shrinkage of these composite columns develop more rapidly, but are comparatively lower in magnitude than for RC columns due to the concrete core having no direct exposure to the external environment. There {{is a need for}} a comprehensive understanding of the differential axial shortening (DAS) in concrete filled tube (CFT) buildings which will be different from that in a RC building. An appraisal of the DAS and accurate quantification of all the adverse effects that can occur in a building due to DAS, are required to facilitate a safe and efficient design. This paper develops and applies a comprehensive technique to evaluate the DAS in a high rise building with composite CFTs. This technique incorporates the effects of (i) construction sequence and concrete levelling (ii) stress relaxation {{of concrete}} due to the presence of the steel tube (iii) time dependent material properties and (iv) effects of belt and outrigger systems. The technique has been validated using experimental data and is then illustrated through its application to a 60 storey building with CFT columns. The DAS between the vertical members are evaluated and its effects on the structural components are studied. Finally, the technique is applied to a similar building with RC columns and the results compared with those from the CFT building.

The high flowability may lead to segregation, which is presented in a form of separation of large CA particles from the mortar matrix. Segregation {{is a major problem}} and should be avoided during the production of SCC to avoid any improper results. To overcome this problem, all concrete samples were filled in a consistent technique with a strict quality control. In this study, a simple acceptable test, the SI test, is used to assess the ability of all SCC mixtures to resist segregation by visually inspecting the <b>concrete</b> pie after <b>lifting</b> the slump cone in the slump flow test, if there is no clear accumulation of CA particles/mortar {{at the center of the}} concrete pie and no free water flowing around its perimeter, the mixture is assigned a SI =  0 and it means that concrete can fully resist segregation. If the concrete mixture experienced an apparent accumulation of CA particles/mortar at the center of the concrete pie or a trace of free water flowing around its parameter, the concrete is assumed to have adequate resistance to segregation and SI =  1. In the case of obvious accumulation of CA particles/mortar or free water, the SI is set to 2 and the concrete is likely to segregate.|$|R

The {{different types of}} design drawings may have various levels of design errors due to many factors such as unclear overview of the designs, lack of coordination process, and human mistakes. Civil engineers, both designers and contractors, have limited understanding {{of the importance of}} design errors that occur in construction phases. This paper attempts to evaluate the impact level of groups of design errors in structural and other building components and also the impact level of their cases which occur in building construction projects in Cambodia. Respondents were asked to provide the impact score for design errors based on the five-point Likert scale, ranked from 1 -negligible to 5 -disastrous. The average impact score was determined in order to rank the impact of design errors. As a result, design errors in structural and mechanical works are found as the first group to be focused due to its impact, followed by design errors in structural and plumbing works. The top three cases under the group of design errors in structural and mechanical works are those in reinforced <b>concrete</b> walls and <b>lift</b> systems, footing and lift systems, and slab and HVAC systems.
