This dissertation proposes a new realistic approach for EMS systems in two major focuses: multiple unit dispatching and relocation strategies. This work makes recommendations for multiple-unit dispatch to multiple <b>call</b> <b>priorities</b> based on simulation optimization and heuristics. The objective is to maximize the expected survival rate. Simulation models are proposed to determine the optimization. A heuristic algorithm is developed for large-scale problems. Numerical results show that dispatching while considering <b>call</b> <b>priorities,</b> rather than always dispatching the closest medical units, could improve the effectiveness of EMS systems. Additionally, we extend the model of multiple-unit dispatch to examine fairness between <b>call</b> <b>priorities.</b> We consider the potentially-life-threatening calls which could be upgraded to life-threatening. We formulate the fairness problem as an integer programming model solved using simulation optimization. Taking into account fairness between priorities improves th...|$|R

40|$|The {{question}} of the unity of consciousness is often treated as the {{question of}} how different conscious experiences are related to each other in order to be unified. Many contemporary views on the unity of consciousness are based on this bottom-up approach. In this paper I explore an alternative, top-down approach, according to which (to a first approximation) a subject undergoes one single conscious experience at a time. From this perspective, the problem of unity of consciousness becomes rather the problem of how we can distinguish a multiplicity of goings-on within our conscious experience at any time, given that it is unique. I will present three possible top-down approaches to unity of consciousness, which I <b>call</b> <b>Priority</b> unity monism, Existence unity monism, and Brentanian unity monism. Priority monism and Existence monism are defined in analogy with the homonymous metaphysical theories of object constitution. Brentanian monism retraces Franz Brentano’s view on unity of consciousness, and is defined by appeal to some of his mereological ideas. I will argue that the latter is the best top-down approach to unity of consciousness...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{considers}} matching {{problems with}} individual/regional minimum/maximum quotas. Although such quotas are relevant in many real-world settings, {{there is a}} lack of strategyproof mechanisms that take such quotas into account. We first show that without any restrictions on the regional structure, checking the existence of a feasible matching that satisfies all quotas is NP-complete. Then, assuming that regions have a hierarchical structure (i. e., a tree), we show that checking the existence of a feasible matching can be done in time linear in the number of regions. We develop two strategyproof matching mechanisms based on the Deferred Acceptance mechanism (DA), which we <b>call</b> <b>Priority</b> List based Deferred Acceptance with Regional minimum and maximum Quotas (PLDA-RQ) and Round-robin Selection Deferred Acceptance with Regional minimum and maximum Quotas (RSDA-RQ). When regional quotas are imposed, a stable matching may no longer exist since fairness and nonwastefulness, which compose stability, are incompatible. We show that both mechanisms are fair. As a result, they are inevitably wasteful. We show that the two mechanisms satisfy different versions of nonwastefulness respectively; each is weaker than the original nonwastefulness. Moreover, we compare our mechanisms with an artificial cap mechanism via simulation experiments, which illustrate that they have a clear advantage in terms of nonwastefulness and student welfare...|$|E

40|$|We {{define and}} examine {{a new class}} of two-player {{stochastic}} games that we <b>call</b> <b>priority</b> games. The priority games contain as proper subclasses the parity games studied in computer science [4] and also the games with the limsup and liminf payoff. We show that the value of the priority game can be expressed as an appropriate nested fixed point of the value mapping of the one-day game. This extends the result of de Alfaro and Majumdar [4], where the authors proved that the value of the stochastic parity game can be expressed as the nested fixed point of the one-day value mapping. The difference between our paper and [4] is twofold. The value of the parity game is obtained by applying the least and the greatest fixed points to the value mapping of the one-day game. However, in general, the greatest and the least fixed-points are not sufficient in order to obtain the value of the priority game. To cope with this problem we introduce the notion of the nearest fixed point of a monotone bounded nonexpansive mapping. Our main result is that the value of the priority game can be obtained as the nested nearest fixed point of the value mapping of the one-day game. The second point that makes our proof different from [4] is that our proof is inductive. We give a game interpretation for the nested fixed point formula where some variables are free (not bounded by fixed point operator). Thus instead of proving the main result in one big step as in [4] we can limit ourselves to the case when just one fixed point is added to the nested fixed point formula...|$|E

40|$|JPEG 2000 is the {{new image}} coding {{standard}} which can provide superior rate-distortion performance over the old JPEG standard. However, the conventional post-compression rate-distortion (PCRD) optimization scheme in JPEG 2000 is not efficient. It requires entropy encoding all available data even though {{a large portion of}} them will not be included in the final output. In this paper, three rate control methods are proposed to efficiently reduce both the computational complexity and memory usage over the conventional PCRD method. The first method, called successive bit-plane rate allocation (SBRA), allocates the bit rate by using the currently available rate-distortion information only. The second method, <b>called</b> <b>priority</b> scanning rate allocation (PSRA), allocates bits according to certain prioritized ordering. The third method uses PSRA to achieve optimal truncation as PCRD without encoding of all the image details and is <b>called</b> <b>priority</b> scanning with optimal truncation (PSOT). Simulation results suggest that the three proposed methods provide different tradeoff among visual quality, computational complexity, coding delay and working memory size. SBRA is memoryless and causal and requires the least computational complexity, lowest coding delay and achieves good visual quality. PSRA achieves higher PSNR than SBRA at the expense of larger working memory size and longer coding delay. PSOT gives the best PSNR but requires even more computation, delay and memory...|$|R
