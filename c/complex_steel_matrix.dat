The {{results indicated that the}} erosion wear rate of the four tested materials has the different changes not only with the quartz particles sizes in slurry, but also with the erosion angle of slurry. The erosion wear rate of SiC particle reinforced <b>steel</b> <b>matrix</b> surface composite is the lowest in four kinds of tested materials under the test conditions. And that of high chromium cast iron is less than that of low chromium cast iron under the same test conditions. The SiC particles embedded the <b>steel</b> <b>matrix</b> could prevent the steel surface from wear brought by quartz particles in slurry erosion wear, and protect the <b>steel</b> <b>matrix,</b> so that the erosion wear resistance of <b>steel</b> <b>matrix</b> could be increased...|$|R

40|$|Wear {{resistant}} surfaces {{with high}} toughness and impact resistant properties {{are to be}} created to improve the life cycle cost of brake discs for trains. A potential solution to this industrial problem is to use an arc cladding process. This work describes the application of {{gas tungsten arc welding}} (GTAW) for a structural ceramic Metal Matrix Composite (MMC) on steel. The structure of the two ceramics examined indicates the possibility of development of a wear resistant surface, which would extend the life of the brake disc. Silicon Carbide (SiC) and Tungsten Carbide (WC) ceramics were studied to embed them in a <b>steel</b> <b>matrix</b> by an advanced GTAW method. WC particles penetrated the liquid weld pool and also partially dissolved in the <b>steel</b> <b>matrix,</b> whereas, SiC because of the physical properties never penetrated deeper into the weld pool but segregated on the surface. Successful embedding and bonding of WC led to the decision to exercise an in-depth analysis of the bonding between the WC particles and the matrix. Chemical analysis of the matrix revealed more WC dissolution as compared to particle form within the clad. It was observed that WC reinforcement particles built a strong chemical bond with the <b>steel</b> <b>matrix.</b> This was shown by electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) analysis. The hard clad layer composed of WC reinforced <b>steel</b> <b>matrix</b> gave an matching friction coefficient to high-strength steel in cold wear conditions through Pin-on-Disc wear and friction testing.

Findings: Deposition of (Ti,Al) N coating onto high-speed <b>steel</b> <b>matrix</b> composites (HSSMC), cemented carbides, cermet and Al 2 O 3 type oxide tool ceramics substrate causes increase of wear resistance as well as reduces the exceeding of steady stresses critical levels.

Each compact was roll clad into a plate and subsequently heat treated at a temperature equal to the initial sintering temperature. Metallographic examination of the fabricated and heat-treated plates demonstrated that none of the systems was metallurgically stable.

40|$|In {{sheet metal}} forming (SMF) of {{materials}} such as stainless steels {{there is a major}} problem with transfer and accumulation of sheet material to the metal forming tool surface. The problem is known as galling; a sort of severe adhesive wear, which results in severe scratching of produced parts. In this thesis, the overall aim was to gain knowledge of the influence of tool steel microstructure on galling initiation under sliding conditions. It was discovered that material transfer and tool steel damage caused by sheet material flow creating wear-induced galling initiation sites occurred in the early stage of galling. The galling resistance was higher for tool <b>steels</b> with higher <b>matrix</b> hardness due to better resistance to tool steel damage. Initial friction and critical contact pressure to galling was influenced by the strength of the sheet material. Material transfer happened at low pressures and the friction value was high in a case of sheet materials with lower proof strength, possibly due to the sheet contact against the tool <b>steel</b> <b>matrix</b> resulting in high adhesion and quicker tool damage. It was demonstrated that, in addition to hardness of the tool <b>steel</b> <b>matrix</b> and sheet material proof strength, tool steel microstructural features like size, shape, distribution and height of hard phases are important parameters influencing galling. Tool steels comprising homogeneously distributed, small and high hard phases better prevented the contact between sheet material and the tool <b>steel</b> <b>matrix.</b> Thus, a metal to metal contact with high friction was more efficiently avoided, which resulted in better tool performance. ...|$|R

Moreover, development of new measurement methods of oxygen and carbon dissolved in sodium has been carried in this study. In this study, ASTM A 182 Grade 92 steel was exposed to liquid sodium at 650 °C in order to investigate surface oxidation and corrosion behavior as well as microstructure changes, especially production of precipitates. Comparisons {{were made to the}} same material exposed to argon gas at 650 °C. In sodium-exposed specimens, intergranular oxidation and chromium depletion were observed at the near surface by an electron probe micro analyzer (EPMA) used for elemental analysis. The chromium, oxygen, and sodium X-ray images overlapped, indicating NaCrO 2 oxidation. Since, the carbon image overlapped on NaCrO 2 oxide, the carbon was trapped in the oxide. The chromium image shows the chromium-depleted zone. With the argon-exposed specimen, however, this behavior at the surface was not observed. Different types of precipitates in the Gr. 92 <b>steel</b> <b>matrix</b> were observed. At the interface between the Cr-depleted zone and the bulk <b>steel</b> <b>matrix</b> in specimens exposed to 650 °C liquid sodium showed mainly M 23 C 6 carbide, while specimens in the bulk <b>steel</b> <b>matrixes</b> which exposed to 650 °C sodium as well as argon showed mainly a M 2 (W,Mo) phase.
