5|$|Cave 1 {{is divided}} into four parts: a veranda, a middle room, a <b>cell,</b> <b>and</b> a half cell. The veranda has a bench along the right wall. Its front {{possibly}} had two quadrangular pillars, traces of one are seen around the ceiling. A rock beam was present over the pillars, above the beam ribs and a rail pattern could have existed. In a recess below the veranda is an earth-filled cistern. A door with a small window to the left leads into the middle room. The middle room has a bench along the right wall. Towards {{the back of the}} middle room, to the left, is the half <b>cell</b> <b>and</b> to the right the cell. The half-cell has a bench along the right wall and to the left, has a square window connecting it to cave 2. A door with grooves for fitting a wooden frame, leads into the cell which has a bench along its right wall.|$|E
5|$|Cave 21 is {{approached}} {{through a}} small crevice from cave 20, {{in the absence of}} any direct approach. Its living space has a veranda of fairly large size. There is also an inner cell with a grooved door frame. Seating benches have been cut into shallow spaces both in the <b>cell</b> <b>and</b> in the veranda.|$|E
5|$|Cave 8 is a difficult-to-reach dwelling. It {{consists}} of a veranda with a <b>cell</b> <b>and</b> a half cell in its back wall, both entered through the veranda. The cell has a broken door, a small window, benched recess and a peg hole. The half cell has an open front and a bench at the back.|$|E
40|$|Interleukin 1 (IL- 1) is a {{polypeptide}} hormone that mediates {{a broad range}} of biological activities and interacts with surface receptors on numerous cell types. Equilibrium binding studies have identified a class of IL- 1 receptors on T <b>cells,</b> fibroblasts, <b>and</b> epithelial <b>cells</b> that have 2 - to 5 -fold higher affinity than the receptors on bone marrow <b>cells,</b> pre-B <b>cells,</b> <b>and</b> macrophage <b>cell</b> lines. Affinity cross-linking with human 125 I-labeled IL- 1 alpha (125 I-IL- 1 alpha) labels an approximately 100 -kDa protein on T <b>cells</b> <b>and</b> fibroblasts and an approximately 80 -kDa protein on pre-B <b>cells</b> <b>and</b> macrophage <b>cell</b> lines. Monoclonal <b>and</b> polyclonal antibodies specific for the IL- 1 receptor on T <b>cells</b> <b>and</b> fibroblasts block human 125 I-IL- 1 alpha binding to T <b>cells,</b> fibroblasts, <b>and</b> epithelial <b>cells</b> but cannot block IL- 1 binding to bone marrow <b>cells,</b> pre-B <b>cells,</b> <b>and</b> macrophages. These antibodies immunoprecipitate the IL- 1 receptor-human 125 I-IL- 1 alpha complex from T <b>cells</b> <b>and</b> fibroblasts but not from pre-B <b>cells</b> <b>and</b> macrophage <b>cell</b> lines. An S 1 nuclease protection assay demonstrated that T <b>cells</b> <b>and</b> fibroblasts contain identical IL- 1 receptor mRNA but that pre-B <b>cells</b> <b>and</b> macrophages do not contain this receptor mRNA. Taken together, the data demonstrate that mouse T <b>cells,</b> fibroblasts, <b>and</b> epithelial <b>cells</b> express an identical IL- 1 receptor, whereas the IL- 1 receptor on pre-B <b>cells,</b> macrophages, <b>and</b> bone marrow <b>cells</b> represents a different gene product...|$|R

40|$|The {{past decade}} of {{research}} on Drosophila stem <b>cells</b> <b>and</b> niches has provided key insights. Fly stem cells do not occupy a special “state” based on novel “stem cell genes” but resemble transiently arrested tissue progenitors. Moreover, individual stem <b>cells</b> <b>and</b> downstream progenitors are highly dynamic and dispensable, not tissue bulwarks. Niches, rather than fixed cell lineages, ensure tissue health by holding stem <b>cells</b> <b>and</b> repressing <b>cell</b> differentiation inside, but not outside. We review the five best-understood adult Drosophila stem <b>cells</b> <b>and</b> argue that the fundamental biology of stem <b>cells</b> <b>and</b> niches is conserved between Drosophila and mice...|$|R

5|$|Much of the {{diversity}} and heterogeneity of AML is because leukemic transformation can occur {{at a number of}} different steps along the differentiation pathway.

Stem <b>cells</b> <b>and</b> progenitors constitute a dynamic cell population exhibiting plasticity by transitioning between stem <b>and</b> non-stem <b>cell</b> function, heavily influenced by the micro-environment and tissue damage.

5|$|This is, in turn, {{surrounded}} by the viral envelope, that is composed of the lipid bilayer taken from the membrane of a human cell when the newly formed virus particle buds from the cell. The viral envelope contains proteins from the host <b>cell</b> <b>and</b> relatively few copies of the HIV Envelope protein, which consists of a cap made of three molecules known as glycoprotein (gp) 120, and a stem consisting of three gp41 molecules which anchor the structure into the viral envelope. The Envelope protein, encoded by the HIV env gene, allows the virus to attach to target cells and fuse the viral envelope with the target cell membrane releasing the viral contents into the <b>cell</b> <b>and</b> initiating the infectious cycle.|$|E

5|$|A line of rats with {{hereditary}} kidney cancer {{were developed}} by Japanese researchers. They have a mutation in the FLCN homolog that produces a truncated protein, though they do not develop the cutaneous or pulmonary symptoms seen in humans. Heterozygotes have renal abnormalities seen very early in life that develop into clear <b>cell</b> <b>and</b> hybrid tumors, significantly shortening the animals' lifespan; they also are prone to endometrial and salivary gland clear cell hyperplasia as well as rhabdomyolysis. Homozygotes do not survive to birth. When a wild-type FLCN gene was added, the phenotype was rescued.|$|E
5|$|A mosaic {{mutation}} {{may or may}} not be inheritable, {{depending on}} the cell populations affected.

5|$|A second defence of {{vertebrates}} against viruses {{is called}} cell-mediated immunity and involves immune cells known as T cells. The body's cells constantly display short fragments of their proteins on the cell's surface, and, if a T cell recognises a suspicious viral fragment there, the host cell is destroyed by killer T cells and the virus-specific T-cells proliferate. Cells {{such as the}} macrophage are specialists at this antigen presentation. The production of interferon is an important host defence mechanism. This is a hormone produced by the body when viruses are present. Its role in immunity is complex; it eventually stops the viruses from reproducing by killing the infected <b>cell</b> <b>and</b> its close neighbours.|$|E

5|$|A {{second factor}} which {{contributes}} to a concentrated jet, that is more applicable to the subtropical jet, which forms at the poleward limit of the tropical Hadley <b>cell</b> <b>and</b> to first order this circulation is symmetric with respect to longitude. Tropical air rises to the tropopause, and moves poleward before sinking; this is the Hadley cell circulation. As it does so it tends to conserve angular momentum, since friction with the ground is significant. Air masses that begin moving poleward are deflected eastward by the Coriolis force (true for either hemisphere), which for poleward moving air implies an increased eastward component of the winds (note that leftward deflection in the southern hemisphere).|$|E
5|$|Advances in {{microscopy}} {{also had}} a profound impact on biological thinking. In the early 19th century, a number of biologists pointed to the central importance of the cell. In 1838 and 1839, Schleiden and Schwann began promoting the ideas that (1) the basic unit of organisms is the <b>cell</b> <b>and</b> (2) that individual cells have all the characteristics of life, though they opposed the idea that (3) all cells come from the division of other cells. Thanks to the work of Robert Remak and Rudolf Virchow, however, by the 1860s most biologists accepted all three tenets of what came to be known as cell theory.|$|E
