25|$|Trauma {{models are}} {{typically}} {{founded on the}} view that traumatic experiences (such as actual physical or sexual abuse) are more common or more serious than thought in the histories of those diagnosed with mental disorders.

40|$|Objective This is an {{investigation}} into the prevalence and patterns of <b>childhood</b> forcible <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse</b> and victim-perpetrator relationship among secondary school students in the Northern Province (South Africa). Method 414 secondary school students in standard 9 and 10 in 3 secondary schools filled in a retrospective self-rating questionnaire in a classroom setting. The questionnaire asked for the demographic variables of the subjects, (physical contact forms of) sexual experiences of participants before the age of 17 years where the perpetrator used physical force to intimidate and dominate the victim or to achieve sexual gratification, and the victim-perpetrator relationship. Result It shows an overall prevalence rate for <b>childhood</b> forcible <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse</b> to be 16. 4 %; 8. 8 % for males, 15. 7 % for females. 9. 9 % were kissed sexually by force, 6. 8 % were touched sexually by force, 6. 1 % were victims of oral/anal/vaginal intercourse using force. The majority of the perpetrators were acquaintances or relatives of the victims. Conclusion The author pointed out some possible health and behavioural implications of forcible <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse</b> for the victims, and call for more {{research in the area of}} forcible <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse</b> in the Province, more publicity of the possible situation of raped or forcibly sexually abused children, and for more campaigns against <b>childhood</b> forcible <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse</b> and <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse</b> in general in the Province...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: In a {{relatively}} small number of previous studies, childhood abuse has been found to be associated with more severe symptom course, earlier onset, greater comorbidity, and greater suicidality in those diagnosed with bipolar disorder. There have been no prior reports looking for any association between childhood abuse and cognitive style. This study aimed to examine the relationship between cognitive factors, such as response styles to depressed mood and dysfunctional attitudes, clinical features, and <b>childhood</b> physical and <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse</b> in this population. Methods: A total of 157 adult participants diagnosed with DSM-IV bipolar disorder I or II were assessed on clinical features of this condition and measures of <b>childhood</b> <b>sexual</b> and physical <b>abuse.</b> Participants also completed self-report questionnaires covering areas such as symptom measures of depression, anxiety and stress, dysfunctional attitudes, and response styles to depressed mood. Results: Seventy-four participants (37 %) reported having experienced either <b>sexual</b> or physical <b>abuse.</b> Those who reported physical or <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse</b> were significantly more likely to report self-harm or suicidal behaviors and showed higher stress scores. Specifically, those who reported <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse</b> were more likely to have simple phobias, to have attempted suicide, and to have had more hospitalizations for depression. After controlling for current mood severity, there were no significant differences on the self-report cognitive style measures for those who reported <b>childhood</b> <b>sexual</b> or physical <b>abuse</b> compared to those who did not report abuse. Conclusions: Cognitive styles were not found to be associated with <b>childhood</b> <b>sexual</b> or physical <b>abuse</b> in participants with bipolar disorder. Stress may be important to target in psychological interventions, whilst special attention should also be paid to those with a history of <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse</b> given the greater likelihood of suicide attempt. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S...|$|R

25|$|The {{intensity}} and reactivity of a person's negative affectivity, or tendency to feel negative emotions, predicts BPD symptoms {{more strongly than}} does <b>childhood</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse.</b> This finding, differences in brain structure (see Brain abnormalities), {{and the fact that}} some patients with BPD do not report a traumatic history, suggest that BPD is distinct from the post-traumatic stress disorder which frequently accompanies it.

25|$|The exact {{causes for}} the {{development}} of a particular sexual orientation have yet to be established. To date, a lot of research has been conducted to determine the influence of genetics, hormonal action, development dynamics, social and cultural influences—which has led many to think that biology and environment factors play a complex role in forming it. It was once thought that homosexuality was the result of faulty psychological development, resulting from childhood experiences and troubled relationships, including <b>childhood</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse.</b> It has been found that this was based on prejudice and misinformation.|$|E
25|$|Findings {{have shown}} in {{specific}} cases that paranormal belief {{acts as a}} psychodynamic coping function {{and serves as a}} mechanism for coping with stress.

A study of a random sample of 502 adults revealed paranormal experiences were common in the population which were linked to a history of childhood trauma and dissociative symptoms. Research has also suggested that people who perceive themselves as having little control over their lives may develop paranormal beliefs to help provide an enhanced sense of control.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, {{psychiatrist}} David Spiegel {{said that}} the inclusion of Landis' 1956 study was unjustified. He argued that, while weighting larger studies more than smaller makes sense, combining {{the results of a}} large study examining very mild trauma (such as fending off an attacker) with studies of long-term physical and sexual abuse was inappropriate and led to erroneous conclusions. Rind et al. replied that Spiegel misrepresented their analysis, since they did not use Landis' study in the meta-analysis of <b>childhood</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse</b> – symptom correlations, but only for examining the self-reported effects of CSA. They contend that the way they handled Landis' data maximized negative reports and minimized the possible deflating effect of Landis' data on the overall effect sizes.|$|E

40|$|Objective We {{examined}} {{associations of}} <b>childhood</b> physical and <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse</b> with risk of intimate partner violence (IPV). We also evaluated {{the extent to}} which childhood abuse was associated with self-reported general health status and symptoms of antepartum depression in a cohort of pregnant Peruvian women. Methods In-person interviews were conducted to collect information regarding history of childhood abuse and IPV from 1, 521 women during early pregnancy. Antepartum depressive symptomatology was evaluated using the Patient Health Questionnaire- 9. Multivariable logistic regression procedures were used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 %CI). Results Any childhood abuse was associated with 2. 2 -fold increased odds of lifetime IPV (95 %CI: 1. 72 – 2. 83). Compared with women who reported no childhood abuse, those who reported both, <b>childhood</b> physical and <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse</b> had a 7. 14 -fold lifetime risk of physical and sexual IPV (95 %CI: 4. 15 – 12. 26). The odds of experiencing physical and <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse</b> by an intimate partner in the past year was 3. 33 -fold higher among women with a history of <b>childhood</b> physical and <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse</b> as compared to women who were not abused as children (95 %CI 1. 60 – 6. 89). Childhood abuse was associated with higher odds of self-reported poor health status during early pregnancy (aOR = 1. 32, 95 %CI: 1. 04 – 1. 68) and with symptoms of antepartum depression (aOR = 2. 07, 95 %CI: 1. 58 – 2. 71). Conclusion These data indicate that <b>childhood</b> <b>sexual</b> and physical <b>abuse</b> is associated with IPV, poor general health and depressive symptoms in early pregnancy.

40|$|Seclusion and {{restraint}} (S/R) is a controversial {{topic in the}} field of psychiatry, {{due in part to the}} high rates of <b>childhood</b> physical and <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse</b> found among psychiatric inpatients. The trauma-informed care perspective suggests that the use of S/R with previously abused inpatients may result in retraumatization due to mental associations between childhood trauma and the experience during S/R. Thus, though one would expect to see efforts on the part of inpatient psychiatric facilities to limit S/R of previously abused inpatients, research suggests that trauma victims may be more likely to experience S/R. The current study sought to clarify this possibility by examining whether presence or absence and chronicity of <b>childhood</b> <b>sexual</b> and physical <b>abuse</b> differed among three groups of adult inpatients (N = 622) residing at a mid-Western state psychiatric hospital.

As I predicted, children who were sexually abused experienced a greater range of symptoms related to DID than children who were physically or emotionally abused. There was a bit of overlap between symptoms in children who were sexually or physically abused, but not much overlap with emotional abuse. This may be because children emotional trauma is usually present in victims of <b>sexual</b> and physical <b>abuse,</b> so these children do not only experience physical trauma, but emotional trauma as well...|$|R
