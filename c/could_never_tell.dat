25|$|The same {{criticism}} {{is even more}} emphatically applicable {{to the influence of}} a not-self, or world of forces, corresponding to our sensations, and the cause of them. Starting from sensation as our basis, causality could never give us this, even though it be allowed that sensation is impersonal to the extent of being independent of our volition. Causality might tell us that a cause there is of sensation somewhere and of some sort; but that this cause is a force or sum of forces, existing in space, independently of us, and corresponding to our sensations, it <b>could</b> <b>never</b> <b>tell</b> us, {{for the simple reason that}} such a notion is not supposed to exist in our consciousness. Causality cannot add to the number of our notions,--cannot add to the number of realities we know. All it can do is to necessitate us to think that a cause there is of a given change, but what that cause is it cannot of itself inform us, or even suggest to us, beyond implying that it must be to the effect. Sensation might arise, for aught we know, so far as causality leads us, not from a world of forces at all, but from a will like our own, though infinitely more powerful, acting upon us, partly furthering and partly thwarting us. And indeed such a supposition is, with the principle of causality at work, within the limits of probability, as we are already supposed to know such a reality—a will—in our own consciousness. When Cousin thus set himself to vindicate those points by reflection, he gave up the obvious advantage of his other position that the realities in question are given us in immediate and spontaneous apprehension. The same criticism applies equally to the inference of an absolute cause from the two limited forces which he names self and not-self. Immediate spontaneous apperception may seize this supreme reality; but to vindicate it by reflection as an inference on the principle of causality is impossible. This is a mere paralogism; we can never infer either absolute or infinite from relative or finite.|$|E
500|$|Byrne {{passed on}} the first cheque for $9,700 to Epstein, who was impressed, but after innocently asking how much out of the amount Byrne was owed, was told, [...] "Nothing Brian, that's your 10%". Byrne {{then went on to}} {{describe}} the massive amount of interest he was getting from companies across the USA. Epstein was horrified, realising he had made an appalling error by accepting such a small percentage, and decided he <b>could</b> <b>never</b> <b>tell</b> The Beatles. He immediately instructed Jacobs to re-negotiate the contract with Byrne, which was finally achieved seven months later, in August 1964, which raised the royalty to 49%.|$|E
500|$|Along with The Dark Knight Returns, Tim Burton has {{mentioned}} that The Killing Joke influenced his film adaptation of Batman: [...] "I {{was never a}} giant comic book fan, but I've always loved the image of Batman and the Joker. The reason I've never been a comic book fan — and I think it started when I was a child — is because I <b>could</b> <b>never</b> <b>tell</b> which box I was supposed to read. I don't {{know if it was}} dyslexia or whatever, but that's why I loved The Killing Joke, because for the first time I could tell which one to read. It's my favorite. It's the first comic I've ever loved. And the success of those graphic novels made our ideas more acceptable." ...|$|E
60|$|A. Ah! well, I suppose so. We <b>never</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell.</b> There was a {{great mystery}} about it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know. I <b>never</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell.</b> It wasn't that I didn't dote upon you, {{and think}} about you, and feel quite sure that there <b>never</b> <b>could</b> be any other one than you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Worse still, Mr. Rabbit was a trouble maker. He just couldn't {{keep his}} tongue still. And like most gossips, he <b>never</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> the exact truth.|$|R
2500|$|... a kind {{of short}} man who looked a little like Mister Peepers, spoke slowly with a slight Brooklynese accent, and talked so you <b>could</b> <b>never</b> <b>tell</b> when he was kidding."– Brother-in-law Joseph Browner on his first {{impression}} of the artist; quoted in the Fresno Bee, August 26, 1990.|$|E
60|$|Then {{it came to}} {{her with}} a shock, as an {{extraordinary}} oversight, that she <b>could</b> <b>never</b> <b>tell</b> Manning about Ramage--never.|$|E
60|$|LADY MARY. Do you despise me, Crichton? (The man who <b>could</b> <b>never</b> <b>tell</b> a lie {{makes no}} answer.) You {{are the best}} man among us.|$|E
6000|$|For I am called Little Buttercup,--dear Little Buttercup, [...] Though I <b>never</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> why; But still I'm called Buttercup,--poor Little Buttercup, [...] Sweet Little Buttercup I! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Exactly {{alike in}} all, their schoolmasters <b>never</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> them apart; at dancing parties they {{constantly}} changed partners without discovery; their close resemblance is scarcely diminished by age." ...|$|R
60|$|LUCILLA. No; I <b>never</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> what {{to believe}} about them. I know they must be true {{in some way or}} other; and I like reading about them.|$|R
6000|$|There was a silence. George {{began to}} feel uneasy. You <b>could</b> <b>never</b> <b>tell</b> with women, of course. It might be nothing; but it looked uncommonly as if-- ...|$|E
60|$|Philip <b>could</b> <b>never</b> <b>tell</b> lies without embarrassment, {{and he was}} scarlet when he {{finished}} his explanation for not coming. Then Mrs. Athelny entered and shook hands with him.|$|E
60|$|Yet, somehow, he <b>could</b> <b>never</b> <b>tell</b> why, {{he looked}} up and saw the tavern in front of him, which he thought was miles, and miles, and miles away.|$|E
6000|$|Jimmy grinned. [...] "If that's the case, I guess I'll have to," [...] said he. [...] "Wait until I find a {{comfortable}} {{place to sit}} down. I <b>never</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> a story standing up." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{best of it}} {{was that}} my {{assertion}} and brag were true. With reticence and modesty present, I <b>could</b> <b>never</b> have dared <b>tell</b> Scotty my small-boat estimate of him. But it is ever the way of John Barleycorn to loosen the tongue and babble the secret thought.|$|R
60|$|He {{came close}} to her, and, though she <b>could</b> <b>never</b> exactly <b>tell</b> how it happened, she became {{conscious}} of his lips upon her cheek. He then {{asked her to marry}} him. Sophy did not exactly love him, but she had a respect for him which almost amounted to veneration. Even if she had wished to get away from him she hardly dared refuse a personage so reverend and august in her eyes, and she assented forthwith to be his wife.|$|R
6000|$|... "But why don't {{you make}} us understand? I <b>could</b> <b>never</b> <b>tell</b> about Mr. Pynsent {{why he should}} like to be there so much. He is not a clever man----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Father John, Mrs. McKeon's {{been too}} kind to me. Indeed I love her dearly, though I <b>could</b> <b>never</b> <b>tell</b> her so. Give her my kind love. I never {{thought she was}} so kind a woman." ...|$|E
60|$|A {{couple of}} passers-by had paused, interested, to watch developments. You <b>could</b> <b>never</b> <b>tell,</b> of course. Many an {{apparently}} promising row never got any farther than words. But, glancing at Arthur's face, they certainly felt justified in pausing. Mr Shute spoke.|$|E
60|$|A {{few moments}} later--he <b>never</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> how many--the wickedness of his conduct came down upon Jeff like a thunderbolt. He removed his arm, drew {{away from her}} about three inches, and looked in her {{surprised}} face with a solemn, self-condemned expression.|$|R
60|$|SIR PATRICK. I {{could have}} told you that. Ive tried these modern inoculations a bit myself. Ive killed people with them; and Ive cured people with them; but I gave them up because I <b>never</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> which I was going to do.|$|R
60|$|Too late, for in {{an instant}} he was a sheet of living flame. When or how the candle had touched his garments, {{saturated}} with the inflammable fluid, Waters, the only inactive spectator in the room, <b>could</b> <b>never</b> afterward <b>tell.</b> He only knew that the combustion was instantaneous and complete, and before the cry had died from his lips, not only the guard, but the straw mattress on {{which he had been}} sitting, and the loose strips of paper hanging from the walls, and the torn cloth ceiling above were in flames.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{could not}} answer him; I could only sob, and repeat what I had said before--that {{if it were}} anybody else I might speak, but that I <b>could</b> <b>never</b> <b>tell</b> him. Soon after that he went down-stairs, and I went to sleep.|$|E
60|$|The {{cause of}} this change was burglars. Not {{that any of these}} {{unpleasant}} persons had visited us, but we much feared they would. Several houses in the vicinity had been entered during the past month, and we <b>could</b> <b>never</b> <b>tell</b> when our turn would come.|$|E
60|$|She {{diverted}} herself infinitely {{in playing}} upon the excitability of Moses,--in awaking his curiosity, and baffling it, and tormenting {{him with a}} whole phantasmagoria of suggestions and assertions, which played along so near the line of probability, that one <b>could</b> <b>never</b> <b>tell</b> which might be fancy and which might be fact.|$|E
60|$|She <b>never</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> how {{she knew}} it, {{but she did}} {{know that he was}} a knight of Malta. She <b>could</b> <b>never</b> {{remember}} whether she had seen his star, or cross, of his order or not, but it flashed in her mind, like a symbol. He at any rate represented to the child the real world, where kings and lords and princes moved and fulfilled their shining lives, whilst queens and ladies and princesses upheld the noble order.|$|R
6000|$|How {{much time}} was thus lost in inactivity, Eben Dudley <b>could</b> <b>never</b> {{precisely}} <b>tell.</b> He always stoutly maintained {{it could not}} have been long, since his watch was not disturbed by the smallest of those sounds from the woods, which sometimes occur in deep night, and which may be termed the breathing of the forest in its slumbers. His first distinct recollection, was that of feeling a hand grasped with the power of a giant. Springing to his feet, the young man eagerly stretched forth an arm, saying as he did so, in words sufficiently confused-- ...|$|R
60|$|The Scot {{is always}} believed, yet he <b>never</b> <b>tells</b> {{anything}} but lies; whereas the captain is never believed, although he <b>never</b> <b>tells</b> a lie, {{so far as}} I can judge. If he should say his uncle was a male person, he would probably say {{it in such a}} way that nobody would believe it; at the same time the Scot could claim that he had a female uncle and not stir a doubt in anybody's mind. My own luck has been curious all my literary life; I <b>never</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> a lie that anybody would doubt, nor a truth that anybody would believe.|$|R
60|$|How {{long was}} the breathless silence that followed, Myles <b>could</b> <b>never</b> <b>tell.</b> He {{knew that the}} Lady Anne had also risen, and {{that she and her}} cousin were {{standing}} as still as statues. Presently the Earl pointed to the house with his staff, and Myles noted stupidly how it trembled in his hand.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Let me see--was he the {{one that}} won the steeple-chase? No; that was {{the one that}} Augusta liked. We knew so many young men, that I <b>could</b> <b>never</b> <b>tell</b> which was which; and your sisters were always talking about them till it quite ran through my poor head, such merry girls as they were!' ...|$|E
60|$|Next {{moment he}} was gone. She went upstairs and found Cassandra on the landing. She held two or three books in her hand, and she was stooping to look at others in a little bookcase. She said that she <b>could</b> <b>never</b> <b>tell</b> which book she wanted to read in bed, poetry, biography, or metaphysics.|$|E
60|$|The matter dropped, and the Laphams {{lived on}} as before, with joking recurrences {{to the house}} on the water side of Beacon. The Colonel seemed less in earnest than any of them about it; but that was his way, his girls said; you <b>never</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> when he really meant a thing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite true," [...] Mr. Waddington declared, eagerly. [...] "Unfortunately, {{they all}} came in {{together}} and were included with other articles which have not the same antecedents. You {{may be able to}} pick out which they are. I can't. Although I am supposed to be in the business, I <b>never</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> the difference myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|I <b>never</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> what Guy {{thought of}} women. [...] "Poor little beasts," [...] he would often say when the {{conversation}} turned {{on any of}} his fresh conquests. Then, passing {{his hand over his}} marble brow, the old look of stern fixedness of purpose and unflinching severity would straighten the lines of his mouth, and he would mutter, half to himself, [...] "S'death!" ...|$|R
