And in order that she may possess this freedom to perfection, that she may be no husband's slave, no father's obedient and {{trembling}} daughter, I can see but one way: the whole body of men in common must support in perfect liberty the whole body of women. The <b>collective</b> <b>guarantee</b> must protect them against individual tyranny. Thus only can women be safe from the bribery of the rich husband, from the dictation of the father from whom there are [...] "expectations."

60|$|Whenever I say this, I notice my good friends, the women's-rights women, {{with whom}} I am {{generally}} in pretty close accord, look annoyed and hurt. I can never imagine why. I regard this point as an original inequality of nature, {{which it should}} be the duty of human society to redress as far as possible, like all other inequalities. Women are not on the average as tall as men; nor can they lift as heavy weights, or undergo, as a rule, so much physical labour. Yet civilised society recognises their equal right to the protection of our policemen, and endeavours to neutralise their physical inequality by the <b>collective</b> <b>guarantee</b> of all the citizens. In the same way I hold that women in the lump have a certain disadvantage laid upon them by nature, in the necessity that some or most among them should bear children; and this disadvantage I think the men in a well-ordered State would do their best to compensate by corresponding privileges. If women endure on our behalf the great public burden of providing future citizens for the community, the least we can do for them in return is to render that burden as honourable and as little onerous as possible. I can never see that there is anything unchivalrous in frankly admitting these facts of nature; on the contrary, {{it seems to me the}} highest possible chivalry to recognise in woman, as woman, high or low, rich or poor, the potential mother, who has infinite claims on that ground alone to our respect and sympathy.|$|E

6000|$|If any man {{had set up}} a bank in Aylmer's Point with an iron strong-room, a lot of {{electric}} bells, and an obtrusive display of fire-arms and weapons, it is tolerably certain that that bank would have been promptly robbed and gutted within its first week of existence by open violence. Five or six of the boys would have banded themselves together into a body of housebreakers, and would have shot down the banker and burst into his strong-room, without thought of the electric bells or other feeble resources of civilization to that end appointed. But when a quiet, unobtrusive, brave man, like Captain Montague Pierpoint, settled himself in a shanty in their midst, and won their confidence by his straightforward honesty, scarcely a miner in the lot would ever have dreamt of attempting to rob him. Captain Pierpoint had not come to Aylmer's Pike at first with any settled idea of making himself the financier of the rough little community; he intended to dig on his own account, and the rôle of banker was only slowly thrust upon him by the unanimous voice of the whole diggings. He had begun by lending men money out of his own pocket--men who were unlucky in their claims, men who had lost everything at monte, men who had come penniless to the Pike, and expected to find silver growing freely and openly on the surface. He had lent to them in a friendly way, without interest, and had been forced to accept a small present, in addition to the sum advanced, when the tide began to turn, and luck at last led the penniless ones to a remunerative placer or pocket. Gradually the diggers got into the habit of regarding this as Captain Pierpoint's natural function, and Captain Pierpoint, being himself but an indifferent digger, acquiesced so readily that at last, yielding to the persuasion of his clients, he put up a wooden counter, and painted over his rough door the magnificent notice, [...] "Aylmer's Pike Bank: Montague Pierpoint, Manager." [...] He got a large iron safe from Carson City, and in that safe, which stood by his own bedside, all the silver and other securities of the whole village were duly deposited. [...] "Any one of the boys could easily shoot me and open that safe any night," [...] Captain Pierpoint used to say pleasantly; [...] "but if he did, by George! he'd have to reckon afterwards with every man on the Pike; and I should be sorry to stand in his shoes--that I would, any time." [...] Indeed, the entire Pike looked upon Captain Pierpoint's safe as [...] "Our Bank;" [...] and, united in a single front by that simple social contract, they agreed to respect the safe as a sacred object, protected by the <b>collective</b> <b>guarantee</b> of three hundred mutually suspicious revolver-bearing outcasts.|$|E

50|$|In an {{individual}} guarantee, {{such as that}} guaranteeing the neutrality of Belgium, powers which signed the treaty would be bound to individually defend a nation's neutrality regardless {{of the actions of}} the other signatories.

The distinction between individual and <b>collective</b> <b>guarantee</b> resulted in some confusion when the Germans invaded both Belgium and Luxemburg in August 1914. Since Germany inherited Prussia's 1867 commitment to a <b>collective</b> <b>guarantee,</b> by invading Luxemburg it rendered impossible any joint action in defense of Luxemburg's neutrality. Britain was therefore not required to intervene to defend Luxemburg. However, since Belgium was individually guaranteed by the major powers (including Britain), the British government felt obliged to defend its neutrality against German invasion.|$|E

The guarantee makes put options on the financial sector index cheap relative to put options on its member banks. The basket-index put spread rises fourfold from 0. 8 cents per dollar insured before the financial crisis to 3. 8 cents during the crisis for deep out-of-the-money options. The spread peaks at 12 cents per dollar, or 70 % {{of the value of the}} index put. The rise in the put spread cannot be attributed to an increase in idiosyncratic risk because the correlation of stock returns increased during the crisis.
