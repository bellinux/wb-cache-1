5|$|Thyroid nodules {{have been}} {{associated}} with the Birt–Hogg–Dubé phenotype, present in 65% of individuals and 90% of families with the syndrome. However, a connection between BHD and thyroid cancer has not been substantiated. Other conditions have been reported to be associated but may not be caused by the mutation in FLCN or may not be related at all. These include multinodular goiter, medullary thyroid carcinoma, parotid oncocytoma, <b>colonic</b> polyposis, connective tissue nevus, lipomas, angiolipomas, parathyroid adenomas, flecked chorioretinopathy, neurothekeoma, meningiomas, angiofibromas of the face, trichoblastomas, cutaneous focal mucinosis, cutaneous leiomyoma, breast cancer, tonsillar cancer, colorectal cancer, sarcoma of the leg, lung cancer, melanoma, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, basal cell carcinoma, cutaneous leiomyosarcoma, and squamous cell carcinoma.|$|E
5|$|Five genetic {{types of}} HHT are recognized. Of these, three {{have been linked}} to {{particular}} genes, while the two remaining have currently only been associated with a particular locus. More than 80% of all cases of HHT are due to mutations in either ENG or ACVRL1. A total of over 600 different mutations is known. There {{is likely to be a}} predominance of either type in particular populations, but the data are conflicting. MADH4 mutations, which cause <b>colonic</b> polyposis in addition to HHT, comprise about 2% of disease-causing mutations. Apart from MADH4, it is not clear whether mutations in ENG and ACVRL1 lead to particular symptoms, although some reports suggest that ENG mutations are more likely to cause lung problems while ACVRL1 mutations may cause more liver problems, and pulmonary hypertension may be a particular problem in people with ACVRL1 mutations. People with exactly the same mutations may have different nature and severity of symptoms, suggesting that additional genes or other risk factors may determine the rate at which lesions develop; these have not yet been identified.|$|E
25|$|The {{production}} of short-chain fatty acids has several possible {{actions on the}} gut mucosa. All of the short-chain fatty acids are readily absorbed by the <b>colonic</b> mucosa, but only acetic acid reaches the systemic circulation in appreciable amounts. Butyric acid appears {{to be used as}} a fuel by the <b>colonic</b> mucosa as the preferred energy source for <b>colonic</b> cells.|$|E
25|$|Fulminant disease {{correlates}} {{with more than}} ten bowel movements daily, continuous bleeding, toxicity, abdominal tenderness and distension, blood transfusion requirement and <b>colonic</b> dilation (expansion). Patients in this category may have inflammation extending beyond just the mucosal layer, causing impaired <b>colonic</b> motility and leading to toxic megacolon. If the serous membrane is involved, a <b>colonic</b> perforation may ensue. Unless treated, the fulminant disease will soon lead to death.|$|E
25|$|SCFAs {{that are}} {{absorbed by the}} <b>colonic</b> mucosa pass through the <b>colonic</b> wall into the portal {{circulation}} (supplying the liver), and the liver transports them into the general circulatory system.|$|E
25|$|<b>Colonic</b> transit {{studies may}} be used to rule out <b>colonic</b> inertia if there is a history of severe constipation. Continent {{prolapse}} patients with slow transit constipation, and who are fit for surgery may benefit from subtotal colectomy with rectopexy.|$|E
25|$|Diagnosis is {{achieved}} mainly by plain and contrasted radiographical and ultrasound imaging. <b>Colonic</b> marker transit studies are useful to distinguish <b>colonic</b> inertia from functional outlet obstruction causes. In this test, the patient swallows a water-soluble bolus of radio-opaque contrast and films are obtained 1, 3 and 5 days later. Patients with <b>colonic</b> inertia show the marker {{spread throughout the}} large intestines, while patients with outlet obstruction exhibit slow accumulations of markers in some places. A colonoscopy {{can also be used}} to rule out mechanical obstructive causes. Anorectal manometry may help to differentiate acquired from congenital forms. Rectal biopsy is recommended to make a final diagnosis of Hirschsprung disease.|$|E
25|$|A {{mucus layer}} protects the large {{intestine}} from attacks from <b>colonic</b> commensal bacteria.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} noted that the {{sorbitol}} added to sodium polystyrene sulfonate (SPS, used {{in the treatment of}} hyperkalemia) can cause complications in the GI tract, including bleeding, perforated <b>colonic</b> ulcers, ischemic colitis and <b>colonic</b> necrosis, particularly in patients with uremia. Risk factors for sorbitol-induced damage include immunosuppression, hypovolemia, postoperative setting, hypotension after hemodialysis, and peripheral vascular disease. SPS-sorbitol should therefore be used carefully in the management of hyperkalemia.|$|E
25|$|Overall, SCFAs affect major {{regulatory}} systems, such {{as blood}} glucose and lipid levels, the <b>colonic</b> environment, and intestinal immune functions.|$|E
25|$|Microscopic colitis, {{a type of}} {{inflammatory}} bowel disease where {{changes are}} only seen on histological examination of <b>colonic</b> biopsies.|$|E
25|$|They often evolve from age-related diverticulosis and its {{associated}} pathologies resulting from increased intraluminal <b>colonic</b> pressure, including bleeding, abscess, perforation, stricture, fistula formation or impacted fecal matter.|$|E
25|$|The rectum {{receives}} {{blood from}} both the inferior mesenteric artery and the internal iliac artery; the rectum is rarely involved by <b>colonic</b> ischemia due to this dual blood supply.|$|E
25|$|Fiber {{is defined}} by its {{physiological}} impact, with many heterogenous types of fibers. Some fibers may primarily impact one of these benefits (i.e., cellulose increases fecal bulking and prevents constipation), but many fibers impact {{more than one of}} these benefits (i.e., resistant starch increases bulking, increases <b>colonic</b> fermentation, positively modulates <b>colonic</b> microflora and increases satiety and insulin sensitivity). The beneficial effects of high fiber diets are the summation {{of the effects of the}} different types of fiber present in the diet and also other components of such diets.|$|E
25|$|An {{increased}} {{amount of}} <b>colonic</b> sulfate-reducing bacteria {{has been observed}} in some patients with ulcerative colitis, resulting in higher concentrations of the toxic gas hydrogen sulfide. Human <b>colonic</b> mucosa is maintained by the <b>colonic</b> epithelial barrier and immune cells in the lamina propria (see intestinal mucosal barrier). N-butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid, gets oxidized through the beta oxidation pathway into carbon dioxide and ketone bodies. It {{has been shown that}} N-butyrate helps supply nutrients to this epithelial barrier. Studies have proposed that hydrogen sulfide plays a role in impairing this beta-oxidation pathway by interrupting the short chain acetyl-CoA dehydrogenase, an enzyme within the pathway. Furthermore, {{it has been suggested that}} the protective benefit of smoking in ulcerative colitis is due to the hydrogen cyanide from cigarette smoke reacting with hydrogen sulfide to produce the non-toxic isothiocyanate, thereby inhibiting sulfides from interrupting the pathway. An unrelated study suggested that the sulfur contained in red meats and alcohol may lead to an increased risk of relapse for patients in remission.|$|E
25|$|Mucosal EG (25–100%) is {{the most}} common variety, which {{presents}} with features of malabsorption and protein losing enteropathy. Failure to thrive and anaemia may also be present. Lower gastrointestinal bleeding may imply <b>colonic</b> involvement.|$|E
25|$|Venous {{drainage}} usually mirrors <b>colonic</b> arterial supply, {{with the}} inferior mesenteric vein draining into the splenic vein, and the superior mesenteric vein joining the splenic vein {{to form the}} hepatic portal vein that then enters the liver.|$|E
25|$|Another underrecognized and {{potentially}} life-threatening side effect spectrum is gastrointestinal hypomotility, which may manifest as severe constipation, fecal impaction, paralytic ileus, bowel obstruction, acute megacolon, ischemia or necrosis. <b>Colonic</b> hypomotility {{has been shown}} to occur in up to 80% of people prescribed clozapine when gastrointestinal function is measured objectively using radiopaque markers. Clozapine-induced gastrointestinal hypomotility currently has a higher mortality rate than the better known side effect of agranulocytosis. A Cochrane review found little evidence to help guide decisions about the best treatment for gastrointestinal hypomotility caused by clozapine and other antipsychotic medication. Monitoring bowel function and the preemptive use of laxatives for all clozapine-treated people {{has been shown to}} improve <b>colonic</b> transit times and reduce serious sequelae.|$|E
25|$|The {{antibiotics}} Metronidazole and ciprofloxacin {{may be used}} {{to treat}} Crohn's disease with <b>colonic</b> or perianal involvement, although this usage has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. They are also used to treat complications, including abscesses and other infections.|$|E
25|$|The assumed {{mechanism}} of obstructed defecation is by disruption to the rectum and anal canal's ability to contract and fully evacuate rectal contents. The intussusceptum itself may mechanically obstruct the rectoanal lumen, creating a blockage that straining, anismus and <b>colonic</b> dysmotility exacerbate.|$|E
25|$|Overall, {{the percent}} of crypts {{deficient}} for CCOI is less than 1% before age 40, but then increases linearly with age. <b>Colonic</b> crypts deficient for CCOI in women reaches, on average, 18% in women and 23% in men by 80–84 years of age.|$|E
25|$|Flexural anatomy is {{frequently}} {{described as a}} difficult area. It is simplified when each flexure is considered as being centered on a mesenteric contiguity. The ileocaecal flexure arises {{at the point where}} the ileum is continuous with the caecum around the ileocaecal mesenteric flexure. Similarly, the hepatic flexure is formed between the right mesocolon and transverse mesocolon at the mesenteric confluence. The <b>colonic</b> component of the hepatic flexure is draped around this mesenteric confluence. Furthermore, the splenic flexure is formed by the mesenteric confluence between the transverse and left mesocolon. The <b>colonic</b> component of the splenic flexure occurs lateral to the mesenteric confluence. At every flexure, a continuous peritoneal fold lies outside the colonic/mesocolic complex tethering this to the posterior abdominal wall.|$|E
25|$|At the Battle Creek Sanitarium, these <b>colonic</b> irrigators {{were often}} used to shoot gallons of water up a patient's rectum into their colon, {{sometimes}} followed by a half-pint yogurt enema to aid in further cleaning. It {{has been suggested that}} multiple people would get this treatment at one time.|$|E
25|$|Non-gangrenous ischemic colitis, which {{comprises}} {{the vast majority}} of cases, is associated with a mortality rate of approximately 6%. However, the minority of patients who develop gangrene as a result of <b>colonic</b> ischemia have a mortality rate of 50-75% with surgical treatment; the mortality rate is almost 100% without surgical intervention.|$|E
25|$|A {{majority}} of histologically normal fields surrounding neoplastic growths (adenomas and colon cancers) in the colon also show reduced MBD4 mRNA expression (a field defect) compared to histologically normal tissue from individuals {{who never had}} a <b>colonic</b> neoplasm. This finding suggests that epigenetic silencing of MBD4 is an early step in colorectal carcinogenesis.|$|E
25|$|ASCA+ is a {{predictor}} for Crohn's disease with high specificity and {{positive predictive value}} (87% and 78% respectively). ASCA are associated with proximal (gastroduodenal and small bowel involvement) rather than purely <b>colonic</b> disease (P < 0.001) and with a more severe disease phenotype and requirement for surgery over a median follow-up time of 9 years (P < 0.0001).|$|E
25|$|A <b>colonic</b> {{stricture}} is {{a band of}} {{scar tissue}} which forms {{as a result of}} the ischemic injury and narrows the lumen of the colon. Strictures are often treated observantly; they may heal spontaneously over 12–24 months. If a bowel obstruction develops {{as a result of the}} stricture, surgical resection is the usual treatment, although endoscopic dilatation and stenting have also been employed.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{specific}} miRNAs may {{be associated}} with certain histological subtypes of colorectal cancer. For instance, expression levels of miR-205 and miR-373 {{have been shown to be}} increased in mucinous colorectal cancers and mucin-producing Ulcerative Colitis-associated colon cancers, but not in sporadic <b>colonic</b> adenocarcinoma that lack mucinous components. In-vitro studies suggested that miR-205 and miR-373 may functionally induce different features of mucinous-associated neoplastic progression in intestinal epithelial cells.|$|E
25|$|S. bovis and Clostridium septicum, {{which are}} part of the natural flora of the bowel, are {{associated}} with <b>colonic</b> malignancies. When they present as the causative agent in endocarditis, it usually calls for a colonoscopy to be done immediately due to concerns regarding hematogenous spread of bacteria from the colon due to the neoplasm breaking down the barrier between the gut lumen and the blood vessels which drain the bowel.|$|E
25|$|Fecal bacteriotherapy, {{also known}} as a stool transplant, is {{approximately}} 85% to 90% effective in those for whom antibiotics have not worked. It involves infusion of bacterial flora acquired from the feces of a healthy donor to reverse the bacterial imbalance responsible for the recurring nature of the infection. The procedure replaces normal, healthy <b>colonic</b> flora that had been wiped out by antibiotics, and re-establishes resistance to colonization by Clostridium difficile. Side effects, at least initially, are few.|$|E
25|$|The large {{intestine}} absorbs water and any remaining absorbable nutrients {{from the food}} before sending the indigestible matter to the rectum. The colon absorbs vitamins that are created by the <b>colonic</b> bacteria, such as vitamin K (especially important as the daily ingestion of vitamin K is not normally enough to maintain adequate blood coagulation), vitamin B12, thiamine and riboflavin. It also compacts feces, and stores fecal matter in the rectum until it can be discharged via the anus in defecation.|$|E
25|$|Diverticulitis, {{also called}} <b>colonic</b> diverticulitis, is a {{digestive}} disease in which pouches within the large bowel wall become inflamed. Symptoms typically include lower abdominal pain {{of a sudden}} onset. The onset of symptoms, however, may also occur over a few days. In North America and Europe pain is usually on the left side, while in Asia it is often on the right. There may also be fever, nausea, diarrhea or constipation, or blood in the stool. Repeated attacks may occur.|$|E
25|$|There are devices which {{test the}} {{sufficiency}} of oxygen delivery to the colon. The first device {{approved by the}} U.S. FDA in 2004 uses visible light spectroscopy to analyze capillary oxygen levels. Use during Aortic Aneurysm repair detected when colon oxygen levels fell below sustainable levels, allowing real-time repair. In several studies, Specificity has been 90% or higher for acute <b>colonic</b> ischemia, and 83% for chronic mesenteric ischemia, with a sensitivity of 71%-92%. This device must be placed using endoscopy, however.|$|E
25|$|Potassium {{can bind to}} {{agents in}} the {{gastrointestinal}} tract. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate with sorbitol (Kayexalate) has been approved for this use and can be given by mouth or rectally. However, careful clinical trials to demonstrate the effectiveness of sodium polystyrene are lacking, and use of sodium polystyrene sulfonate, particularly if with high sorbitol content, is uncommonly but convincingly associated with <b>colonic</b> necrosis. There are no systematic studies (>6 months) looking at the long-term safety of this medication. Another medication {{by the name of}} patiromer was approved in 2015.|$|E
25|$|Regulation of serum {{potassium}} is {{a function}} of intake, appropriate distribution between intracellular and extracellular compartments, and effective bodily excretion. In healthy individuals, homeostasis is maintained when cellular uptake and kidney excretion naturally counterbalance a patient’s dietary intake of potassium. When kidney function becomes compromised, the ability of the body to effectively regulate serum potassium via the kidney declines. To compensate for this deficit in function, the colon increases its potassium secretion as part of an adaptive response. However, serum potassium remains elevated as the <b>colonic</b> compensating mechanism reaches its limits.|$|E
25|$|While {{the total}} mesocolic {{excision}} (TME) operation {{has become the}} surgical gold standard {{for the management of}} rectal cancer, this is not so for colon cancer. Recently, the surgical principles underpinning TME in rectal cancer have been extrapolated to <b>colonic</b> surgery. Total or Complete mesocolic excision (CME), use planar surgery and extensive mesenterectomy (high tie) to minimise breach of the mesentery and maximise lymph nodes yield. Application of this T/CME reduces local five-year recurrence rates in colon cancer from 6.5% to 3.6%, while cancer-related five-year survival rates in patients resected for cure increased from 82.1% to 89.1%.|$|E
