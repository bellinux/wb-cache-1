That day, the share price of Enron decreased to $20.65, down $5.40 in one day, after the announcement by the SEC that it was investigating several suspicious deals struck by Enron, characterizing them as [...] "some of the most opaque transactions with insiders ever seen". Attempting to explain the billion-dollar charge and calm investors, Enron's disclosures spoke of [...] "share settled costless collar arrangements," [...] "derivative instruments which eliminated the contingent nature of existing restricted forward contracts," [...] and strategies that served [...] "to hedge certain merchant investments and other assets." [...] Such puzzling phraseology left many analysts feeling ignorant about just how Enron managed its business. Regarding the SEC investigation, chairman and CEO Lay said, [...] "We will cooperate fully with the S.E.C. {{and look forward to}} the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to rest." ...|$|E

40|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} compensatory arrangements for health related expenses. It is important that these are executed correctly, to prevent {{that people who are}} entitled to compensation do not receive the compensation and that people claim the compensation who are not entitled to receive a compensation. In 2008, the <b>compensation</b> <b>arrangement</b> for the obligatory deductible has been introduced. This compensation is paid automatically. People who do not receive the compensation but regard themselves as rightful claimants can ask for the compensation. An evaluation of the <b>compensation</b> <b>arrangement</b> of the Dutch Healthcare Authority shows that many requests for compensation of the obligatory deductible are not justified (85 %). This high number of not-justifiable requests leads to unnecessary cost of work. Current research shows that people who regard themselves as rightful claimants and ask for the compensation do not exactly know {{the ins and outs of}} the <b>compensation</b> <b>arrangement.</b> They also hardly look for information about this arrangement. To reduce the percentage of not-justifiable requests and the extra cost of work this causes, it is important to provide people with more information about the <b>compensation</b> <b>arrangement</b> for the obligatory deductible. This is expected to reduce also the number of people who are entitled to compensation but do not receive it...|$|R

They suggest that such arrangements may encourage overutilization of services, in turn driving up health care costs.

40|$|North Sea divers {{have worked}} in a high-risk {{environment}} for 45 years. Little {{is known about the}} psychological consequences of deep sea diving. One third of the entire population of 375 male North Sea divers was thoroughly assessed as part of a health examination requested by the Norwegian government. As many as 96 % had experienced at least one potentially traumatic event (PTE). The pressurized environment causes PTEs to be particularly dangerous, increasing likelihood of diagnostic criteria for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) to be fulfilled. High rates of possible PTSD were found; 48 % - 70 % measured with the symptom measure Impact of Event Scale - Revised (IES-R), and 8 % - 35 % measured with the Keane PTSD scale, a part of the personality measure Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory- 2 (MMPI- 2). This indicates that North Sea divers are at severe risk for PTSD, and that this is probably due to the conditions they work under. The related litigation and economic <b>compensation</b> <b>arrangement</b> spurred suspicion of malingering, but we found no differences in symptoms or personality in those tested before or after the <b>compensation</b> <b>arrangement</b> was established. More research on the mental health of active North Sea divers, as well as properties of the PTEs are of interest and can be useful in developing better safety interventions...|$|R

40|$|The {{design of}} {{efficient}} public policies that aim {{to improve the}} provision of ecosystem services faces the problem that many ecosystem services are only apparent at spatial levels beyond {{the level at which}} they are managed. This makes it impossible to measure the contribution of individual resource managers to the provision of these services, {{as is the case in}} landscapes managed by private landowners such as farmers. As a consequence, the magnitude of the public support associated with the implementation of a policy cannot be specified down to the level of the individual manager/land owner. In this situation, institutional arrangements among resource managers are needed to determine how the public support defined at the higher level can be fairly distributed. This paper proposes a financial <b>compensation</b> <b>arrangement</b> among resource managers in a landscape, based on the Kaldor–Hicks criterion leading to a Pareto-optimal improvement, and explores the institutional requirements for the effective implementation of this arrangement. The proposed arrangement is illustrated with a case study in a woodland landscape in The Netherlands. The results show that private benefits among farms differed considerably due to biophysical, ecological and geographic differences among the farms. The financial <b>compensation</b> <b>arrangement</b> could contribute to improved equity among natural resource managers, which has been proposed as a key requirement for implementation of effective governance of environmental changes. The discussion addresses the institutional requirements of the proposed arrangement for governance structures that effectively deal with biophysical and socio-economic scale mismatches in sustainable use of natural resource...|$|R
