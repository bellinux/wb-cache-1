In contrast to the untreated control cells, Cr(VI) -exposed cells formed apparently aseptate, nonmotile filaments that tended to aggregate.

Both synergistic and antagonistic resistance and toxicities were found upon co exposure with selenite. In wild type cells co-exposure to selenite {{had little effect on}} arsenic resistance, decreased resistance to cadmium and mercury but led to a dramatic increased resistance to tellurite of 32 fold. Due to the potential importance of thiol chemistry in metal biochemistry, deletion strains in γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (key step in glutathione biosynthesis, encoded by gshA), thioredoxin (trxA), glutaredoxin (grxA), glutathione oxidoreductase (gor), and the periplasmic glutathione transporter (cydD) were also evaluated for resistance to various metals in the presence of selenite. The protective effect of selenite on tellurite toxicity was seen in several of the mutants and was pronounced in the gshA mutant were resistance to tellurite was increased up to 1000 fold relative to growth in the absence of selenite. Thiol oxidation studies revealed a faster rate of loss of reduced thiol content in the cell with selenite than with tellurite, indicating differential thiol reactivity. Selenite addition resulted in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production equivalent to levels associated with H 2 O 2 addition.

40|$|Chromates {{are among}} the most common {{substances}} used as corrosion inhibitors. However, these compounds are highly toxic, and an intense effort is being undertaken to replace them. Cerium compounds seem to fulfil the basic requirements for consideration as alternative corrosion inhibitors. The aim of this work was to study the effect of the incorporation of cerium ions in silica sol–gel coatings on aluminum alloys as potential replacement of <b>chromate</b> <b>treatments.</b> The main idea was to combine the barrier effect of silica coatings with the corrosion inhibitor effect of the cerium inside the coatings. Thin (below 1 lm for a single layer) and transparent cerium doped silica sol–gel coatings were prepared by dipping 3005 aluminum alloys in sol–gel solutions. Ultra-violet–visible spectra (UV–vis) showthat cerium ions, Ce 3 + and Ce 4 +, always are present in the coatings, independently of the cerium salt or firing atmosphere used. Active protection with single and two layer coatings prepared with Ce (IV) salt seems to improve corrosion protection of the coated aluminum while coatings prepared with Ce(III) salt only entails a protection when applied as a two layer, possibly due to sealing of pre-existent defects in the first layer. The improvement of active protection with immersion time would imply that corrosion is inhibited by cerium ions that migrate through the coating {{to the site of the}} attack (a defect in the coatings) and then react to passivate the site.

To increase this knowledge, the age-dependent response of the kidney to hexachloro- 1 : 3 -butadiene (HCBD) or potassium dichromate (chromate) has been investigated. Rats have been treated at different ages with a single dose of segment-specific nephrotoxicants of the proximal tubule, chosen {{on the basis of}} their specificity for S 3 and for S 1 -S 2 segments, respectively. The toxicological impact of these xenobiotics has been evaluated through biochemical and genomic markers, and histopathological investigation of kidney samples. HCBD treatment induced tubular necrosis of the S 3 segment of the proximal tubule associated with changes of toxicological markers unrelated to the age. On the contrary, <b>chromate</b> <b>treatment</b> induced an increased kidney damage related to the rat age. In fact, histopathological investigation revealed that at 1 month of age tubular vacuolar degeneration was seen affecting S 1 -S 2 segments of the proximal tubule, whereas at 3 months of age tubular necrosis occurred in the same segments associated with tubular dilation of the distal portions. Consistently, biochemical analysis confirms a direct correlation among genomic and biochemical marker variability and animal age.

40|$|The {{major concern}} {{regarding}} the use of hot-dip galvanized (HDG) steel as reinforcement in concrete has been the high rate of corrosion experienced by the zinc during the first hours in the fresh, wet, and highly alkaline concrete. The present work was aimed at clarifying three issues associated with these concerns. The first involves the metallurgical phases at the surface of the zinc coating. The concentration of zinc at the surface is a function of processing procedures, surface treatment, and exposure to weathering. Differences in the coating surface composition influence the corrosion behaviour of HDG steel reinforcing bars when they are embedded in concrete. The second issue involves the increasing use of supplementary cementing materials in concrete, which change the chemistry of the concrete pore fluid, and also influence the corrosion. The third issue is that the initial corrosion is accompanied by hydrogen evolution, which could increase the pore volume of adjacent cement and thereby, decrease the bond stress between the concrete and the steel. In order to limit the hydrogen evolution, a chromate layer is applied after galvanizing. The results of the project have demonstrated that, during zinc corrosion in ordinary Portland cement (OPC) concrete, calcium hydroxyzincate formed on untreated HDG steel provided sufficient protection against corrosion. Therefore, it is concluded that treating HDG rebar with dilute chromic acid is unnecessary as a method of passivating zinc. A layer of zinc oxide and zinc carbonate formed through weathering on HDG bars slightly increased the initial corrosion rate and passivation time compared with the non-weathered rebars. HDG steel with an alloyed coating, i. e. consisting of Fe-Zn intermetallic phases, required a longer time to passivate than those with a pure zinc surface layer. The lower zinc content of the surface limited the rate of CHZ formation and, hence, delayed passivation. However, regardless of the surface condition, the coating depth loss after two days of embedment in OPC concrete was insignificant. In concretes containing 8 % cement replacement with silica fume, or 25 % cement replacement with slag, the initial corrosion rates were higher than those in OPC due to higher pH and lower calcium contents of the concrete pore solution. The higher corrosion rates lead to initial depth losses which are considered significant. However, in these concretes, <b>chromate</b> <b>treatment</b> was also shown to be unnecessary. Through porosity assessment of cements adjacent to HDG bars, it was found that hydrogen evolution accompanying zinc corrosion did not {{have an impact on the}} pore volume of cements: any additional pores created by hydrogen gas are filled by the zinc corrosion products. The negligible difference in pore volume between cements adjacent to chromated and non-chromated bars further confirmed that chromated treatment was unnecessary...|$|E

The Cr(VI) treatments were carried out in dichromate and sulfuric acid solution with different dipping times. The Cr(III) treatments were carried out in two commercial solutions (A and B). The thickness of the coatings was measured using ellipsometry. The morphologies and the compositions of the treated zinc have been studied by means of SEM, AFM, AES, FTIR and XPS. The drying temperature influence on the corrosion performance of the Cr(VI) âtreated zinc has been investigated. The Volta potential in treated and untreated areas has been measured using scanning Kelvin probe (SKP) and SKPFM. The corrosion behavior of the Cr(VI) and Cr(III) treated zinc has been investigated using polarization, electrochemical impedance measurements (EIS), and salt spray tests. Both Cr(VI) and Cr(III) species were detected by XPS in the outermost layer of the Cr(VI) coatings, while no Cr(VI) species {{was found in the}} Cr(III) coatings. AES depth profile results show that chromium oxides are the main components in the Cr(VI) coatings. Zinc oxide is mainly located at the chromium oxides / zinc interface. The Cr(III) coating is a mixture of chromium oxides and zinc oxide. Both the Cr(VI) and the Cr(III) treatments can supply corrosion protection to zinc. The corrosion resistance of the Cr(III) -B coating is greater than that of the Cr(III) -A coating. However, the inhibition of the corrosion of zinc by Cr(VI) coating is more effective than by the Cr(III) coatings.

40|$|The {{increasing}} use {{of aluminium}} in automotive and transport applications is primarily driven by its high strength to weight ratio, enabling substantially improved fuel economy and reduced CO 2 emissions when substituted for heavier materials. However, the change of material presents new challenges with respect to design and methods of joining. Structural adhesive bonding offers several advantages compared with welding, but a major limitation is concern about the durability of joints in wet and corrosive environments. The pre-treatment of the aluminium surface prior to bonding {{is the key to}} long service life. Pre-treatments successfully employed by the aerospace industry cannot be used in automotive production, where cheaper and more environmentally friendly pre-treatments are required. Specifically, the use of chromates is unacceptable. Hence, {{there is a need to}} develop chromate-free pre-treatments that will consistently provide the required level of performance, while being acceptable both in terms of general engineering practice and economy. To accomplish this task, basic knowledge of the processes occurring on the aluminium surface during pre-treatment, properties of the modified surface, and mechanisms of joint degradation are necessary. The purpose of the present work has therefore been to contribute to a better understanding of how the aluminium substrate affects the formation and properties of conversion coatings for adhesive bonding. In particular, a commercial chromate-free fluorotitanate/zirconate based process has been investigated and compared with conventional <b>chromate</b> <b>treatment.</b> The materials chosen for this work were commercially extruded AA 6060 -T 6 aluminium and a structural single-part epoxy adhesive. To complement the studies of the commercial alloy, model analogues of the AA 6060 aluminium matrix and α-Al(Fe,Mn) Si phase particles present in the commercial alloy were also investigated. It was observed that the α-Al(Fe,Mn) Si particles played an essential role in the formation and properties of Ti-Zr oxide conversion coatings on AA 6060 aluminium. The particles were significantly nobler than the aluminium matrix in the pre-treatment solution. An alkaline diffusion layer therefore developed around the particles during pre-treatment due to oxygen reduction and hydrogen evolution reactions. As Ti-Zr oxide precipitation was favoured at high pH, the conversion layers normally deposited at and in the vicinity of the cathodic particles. The conversion layers formed consequently exhibited considerable lateral variations in thickness. In addition to substrate microstructure, bulk pH and agitation of the conversion bath were important factors controlling the extent of Ti-Zr oxide deposition and its distribution on the surface. On areas well away from the cathodic particles coverage was generally very poor, although a high density of small (< 50 nm) oxide particles was deposited, presumably with a composition similar to the continuous conversion layer close to the α-Al(Fe,Mn) Si particles. The cathodic activity of the particles was only slightly reduced by formation of the Ti-Zr oxide conversion coating. In combination with poor coverage of the aluminium matrix, these conversion coatings are therefore not expected to improve the corrosion resistance of aluminium significantly. In contrast to the above mechanism, the chromate conversion coating (CCC) formed by a redox reaction between chromate ions and aluminium. A relatively thick, porous chromium oxide layer developed over the aluminium matrix of AA 6060, while a significantly thinner film was formed on the α-Al(Fe,Mn) Si particles. The morphology of the CCC covering the matrix was influenced by the hardening Mg 2 Si phase, primarily by promoting nucleation of the CCC. Despite the thin film (< 50 nm) formed on the α-Al(Fe,Mn) Si particles by chromating, the cathodic activity was significantly reduced. Inhibition of the cathodic reactivity at these particles is suggested as an important factor contributing to the high performance of chromate pretreatments on aluminium. Testing of epoxy-bonded AA 6060 aluminium joints in humid environment showed that Ti-Zr based pre-treatment provided improved adhesion relative to alkaline etching and deoxidation only. However, Ti-Zr based pre-treatment was inferior to chromating. Rapid, interfacial crack growth during wedge testing was particularly observed for adherends with a relatively thick Ti-Zr oxide deposit, suggesting that excessive Ti-Zr oxide deposition should be avoided. Furthermore, as the substrate microstructure (i. e. type, area fraction and distribution of cathodic sites) strongly affected the Ti-Zr oxide deposition, the pre-treatment conditions should be adapted to the specific alloy in order to achieve optimum performance. In the presence of chlorides, degradation of adhesive-bonded joints may be accelerated by a filiform corrosion (FFC) type of mechanism. The α-Al(Fe,Mn) Si particles in AA 6060 played a crucial role in promoting FFC, as demonstrated by complete FFC immunity of the iron-free AA 6060 model analogue alloy. Ti-Zr based pre-treatment provided less protection against FFC relative to chromate pre-treatment. The good FFC resistance of CCCs was partly attributed to a better inhibition of the cathodic activity at the α-Al(Fe,Mn) Si particles. The cathodic α-Al(Fe,Mn) Si particles present on the surface of AA 6060 aluminium could be effectively removed by different etch treatments. However, selective removal of surface intermetallics did not prevent FFC because filament growth was supported by cathodic activity on particles that become exposed in the filament tail as a result of the corrosion process. Based on lap shear testing, hot AC anodising in sulphuric acid to a film thickness of about 0. 2 µm showed promise as another chromate-free pretreatment for durable adhesive bonding. The performance was better than a conventional chromic-sulphuric acid based etch treatment. While hot AC anodising did not significantly inhibit the cathodic activity on the α-Al(Fe,Mn) Si particles, good resistance against FFC was still obtained due to the oxide film covering the whole aluminium matrix. Based also on separate durability data recently available, hot AC anodising is considered as a robust alternative to chromating for adhesive bonding of aluminium in certain industrial applications. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|E

The effects of pretreatment with the flavanolignan silymarin (25, 50, 100 ìg/ml) to counteract the toxic effects of Chromate (VI) (10 ìg/ml) was studied on human peripheral blood lymphocytes cultured in vitro. Standard cell proliferation and cytotoxicity assays like MTT assay, NBT reduction test, trypan blue dye exclusion test, estimation of the levels of lipid peroxides and nitric oxide was performed to study the detrimental effect of chromate (VI) on the proliferation of the lymphocytes and to assess the degree of protection offered by pretreatment with silymarin. <b>Chromate</b> (VI) <b>treatment</b> (10 ìg/ml) resulted in statistically significant decrease in cell proliferation (P < 0. 001), increase in cytotoxicity and increased oxidative stress (P < 0. 001). Pretreatment with silymarin (100 ìg/ml) for 15 minutes prior to chromate exposure was able to significantly prevent against chromate (VI) -induced toxicity which was confirmed by all the above mentioned assays. The results of our study give leads about the possible use of silymarin as a diet based prophylactic regimen to counteract the toxic effects of chromate in workers employed in chromium based industries...|$|R

Historically these corrosion resistance coatings were based on the use of chemicals containing Cr (VI) compounds. Silane coatings are of increasing interest in industry due to their potential application for the replacement of current toxic hexavalent <b>chromate</b> based <b>treatments.</b> In this study, hydrophobic coating sol was prepared with methyltriethoxysilane (MTES), methanol (MeOH), and water (as 7 M NH 4 OH) at a molar ratio of 1 : 25 : 4. 31 respectively. The coatings were applied by a dip-technique to 2024 -T 3 Al alloy, and subsequently cured at room temperature and there after heat treated in an oven at 150 °C. The anticorrosion properties of the coatings within 3. 5 wt% NaCl solution were studied by Tafel polarization technique.

Organic–inorganic hybrid silane coatings are of increasing interest in industry due to their potential application for the replacement of current toxic hexavalent <b>chromate</b> based <b>treatments.</b> In the present study, a hybrid epoxy–silica–alumina coating with or without doped cerium nitrate has been prepared using a sol–gel method. The hybrid coatings were applied by a dip-technique to an Al–Cu alloy, Al 2024 -T 3, and subsequently cured at room temperature. The anticorrosion properties of the coatings within 3. 5 % NaCl were studied using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and conventional DC polarisation. An exfoliation test method involving immersion in a solution of 4 M NaCl, 0. 5 M KNO 3 and 0. 1 M HNO 3 was also used. The cerium nitrate doped sol–gel coating exhibited excellent anticorrosion properties providing an adherent protection film on the Al 2024 -T 3 substrate.

40|$|A novel {{process was}} {{developed}} to remove metallic anions from dilute aqueous solutions using polymer-surfactant aggregates (PSAs). This process uses a cationic surfactant to form micelle-like aggregates on oppositely charged polymer chains, thus forming PSAs. The PSAs can bind with dilute anions and self-flocculate. Subsequently, the anion-loaded PSA flocculates can {{be separated from the}} solution by gravity settling. The concentration of chemical residue, however, is relatively high in the treated water. To improve the quality of treated water and reduce the chemical usage, two different surfactants containing a 16 -carbon chain have been investigated individually. The results show that an extended chain surfactant can decrease the concentration of <b>chromate</b> after <b>treatment</b> from 7 ppm (0. 06 mM) to 0. 5 ppm (0. 004 mM) and the concentration of residual surfactant from 1 mM to 0. 02 mM, using the same polymer. The PSAs formed with an extended chain surfactant work effectively at a salinity below 300 mM KCl and a temperature below 50 °C. These results suggest that the PSAs formed with a longer chain surfactant enhance the effectiveness of treating dilute metallic anions, {{and at the same time}} lead to much less surfactant residue in the treated water. Such a PSA process has potential application in the efficient removal of dilute metallic anions during process aqueous effluent treatment...|$|R
40|$|Up until recently, {{the use of}} {{chromated}} {{copper arsenate}} (CCA) -treated wood had been growing steadily in the United States. <b>Chromated</b> copper arsenate <b>treatment</b> arrests microbial and fungal decay of wood products. Due to {{the scale of the}} wood preserving industry, CCA-treated timber may form a significant source of the trace elements: chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), and arsenic (As), to the environment. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the retention of As, Cu and Cr in common soil types in Florida. Soil samples from six soil groups (Histosols, Entisols, Alfisols, Ultisols, Spodosols and Marls) were collected from across the state. Profile samples were collected, with emphasis on surface and diagnostic subsurface horizons, where applicable. Column sorption and desorption studies conducted to determine the retention of leachates from construction and demolition debris-packed columns showed that fine textured soils had the largest retention capacity for Cu, Cr and As.

40|$|Silver {{articles}} like jewellery, silverwares, cosmetic containers, novelties, presentation items etc. {{are usually}} plated with gold in very thin deposits to give good appearance {{and to protect}} silver from tarnishing. A verythin deposit of gold is often porous, and the silver tarnishes through the pores. This tarnishing will spread laterally over the gold and the whole component will turn black. This is often thought {{to indicate that the}} gold has tarnished, but this is not true. Thick layers of gold is useful in preventing tarnish films. However, it is very expensive. Other methods of reducing the tendency of silver to tarnish are to coat the surface with a special lacquer, grease, oil or wax or to apply special oxide or <b>chromate</b> films.

40|$|Chromate (Cr) {{decreases}} {{the growth of}} Spirodela polyrhiza. The fronds lost their pigments. The O 2 evolution was also decreased. The Cr effect {{was found to be}} dose dependent. The toxic effects of Cr have further been studied on the photosynthetic activity of Spirodela polyrhiza by means of the chlorophyll a (Chl a) fluorescence transient O-J-I-P. The Chl a fluorescence transients were recorded in vivo with high time resolution and analyzed according to the JIP-test which can quantify the photosystem II behavior. Cr treated plants show a decrease in yield for primary photochemistry, ϕPo. The performance index of PSII, PIABS, which is the combination of the indexes of three independent parameters, (1) the total number of active reaction centers per absorption (RC/ABS), (2) yield of primary photochemistry (ϕPo) and (3) efficiency with which a trapped exciton can move an electron into the electron transport chain (ψ 0), decreased due to Cr <b>treatment.</b> <b>Chromate</b> sensitivity varies within plant populations. In summary Cr affects several targets of PSII.

40|$|Corrosion is a {{major problem}} for high {{strength}} aluminium alloys. Thickening of the naturally formed oxide layer through anodizing {{is one of the main}} approaches to improve the corrosion resistance of these materials. Chromate anodizing is extremely efficient to produce anodized layers with good corrosion resistance and painting adhesion, however <b>chromate</b> based surface <b>treatments</b> must be banished from industrial use. The corrosion resistance of aluminium alloy 2524 (AA 2524) anodized in tartaric/sulphuric acid (TSA) bath and protected with a hybrid sol-gel coating was evaluated by means of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and salt-spray tests. The morphologies of the obtained layers were characterized by SEM-FEG while the chemical in depth distribution of the hybrid layers was evaluated by means of Rf-GDOES. The effect of anodizing voltage on the sol-gel impregnation and the protection afforded by the layers was evaluated. Electrical equivalent circuit fitting of the EIS data has shown that the anodized layer thickness plays an important role in the protection mechanism of the sol-gel layer. Salt-spray tests highlighted the significant contribution of the sol-gel distribution in the anodized layer. © 2017 Elsevier B. V...|$|R
40|$|Corrosion of {{high-strength}} {{aluminum alloys}} used for airspace application {{is an expensive}} and serious problem. The most significant environmental factor contributing to the corrosion of these alloys is water condensed from humid air and contaminated with soluble chloride salts. The Al 2024 series used for aircraft are particularly susceptible to corrosion in aqueous chloride solutions due to alloying constituents such as copper and other impurities. ^ Chromates are efficient inhibitors of corrosion of aluminum in near neutral aqueous environments containing aggressive anions such as chlorides. Usually, aluminum alloys are initially protected by chromate conversion coatings. Additional polymer coatings are sometimes added during exposure to corrosive atmospheres such as marine environments. ^ Although chromate coatings are widely used, they {{require the use of}} noxious solutions, so they have always presented effluent disposal problems. There are health and safety concerns over the use of chromates due to their toxicity and carcinogenic nature and, as a consequence, the environmental and health risks {{associated with the use of}} such coatings will be restricted in the future. It was these health and safety concerns that led to the development of alternative non-toxic coating processes with comparable adhesion properties and corrosion protection. A variety of process technologies are under development and are vying for acceptance in industrial markets. ^ As an alternate conversion coating, a new titanate conversion coating was systematically researched and developed. Research concentrated on producing passive surfaces from a simple titanate solution using an immersion process. The corrosion resistance of the treated surface has been evaluated using simple, rapid electrochemical techniques as well as a more long-term salt spray test. Passivation by titanate conversion treatment exhibits many similarities to <b>chromate</b> conversion <b>treatment.</b> Based on this study of corrosion protection of the titanate coating formed at different conditions, a possible formation mechanism of a titanate coating is proposed. A conclusion may be drawn that titanate coating seems to be a viable alternative to chromate coatings. ...|$|R
