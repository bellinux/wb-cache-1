5|$|Candice {{made her}} {{on-screen}} {{return on the}} February 18, 2008 episode of Raw, distracting Beth Phoenix during a match with Maria. She returned to in-ring action on March 17, teaming up with Maria to defeat Jillian Hall and Victoria. During the match, Candice injured her left shoulder by tearing the scar tissue over her previously broken left <b>clavicle.</b> Unlike her previous injury, Candice broke her <b>clavicle</b> in four separate places, in essence, shattering it. As a result, Candice was replaced by Ashley for her scheduled match at WrestleMania XXIV. On March 23, Candice underwent successful surgery on her re-broken <b>clavicle.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the fifth}} {{game of the}} 2011–12 season, Josefson broke his right <b>clavicle</b> after {{crashing}} shoulder first into the boards. He underwent surgery the following day on 22 October 2011, and {{was expected to be}} sidelined for three or four months.|$|E
5|$|At No Mercy in October, Phoenix {{defeated}} Michelle to win {{her first}} WWE Women's Championship. She retained the title on the October 22 episode of Raw in a {{two out of three}} falls match, in which Candice Michelle was injured by Phoenix shaking the rope, causing her to fall off the top turnbuckle and legitimately break her <b>clavicle.</b>|$|E

5|$|Candice Michelle {{used her}} rematch clause for the Women's Championship on the October 22 edition of Raw in a {{two out of}} three falls match against Beth Phoenix. After Phoenix won the first pinfall, Candice failed to execute a move {{correctly}} from the top rope, causing her to fall on her neck, shoulder and face. As a result, Candice suffered a legitimate cracked <b>clavicle,</b> and Phoenix retained the title.|$|E
5|$|The Dodgers {{traded for}} Jones {{in part to}} replace Glenn Dobbs – a star {{tailback}} in Brooklyn's single-wing offense – because Dobbs was suffering from injuries. Jones himself was hurt early in the 1947 season, however, when {{he was hit by}} Bill Willis of the Cleveland Browns. Injuries to his knee, hip and <b>clavicle</b> forced him to sit out for several weeks. He broke his hand when he returned and had to play exclusively on defense {{for the rest of the}} season.|$|E
5|$|As it was, Heilmann's {{conclusion}} was so persuasive that it forestalled further {{debate on the}} subject {{even in the face}} of additional conflicting evidence. In 1936, paleontologist Charles Lewis Camp described a new theropod from the Jurassic of North America, Segisaurus. Like Oviraptor, Segisaurus had an unmistakable <b>clavicle,</b> but unlike Oviraptor, it was also plainly identified as being such in the paper that described it. Despite this, the implication of a wishbone-bearing dinosaur was blatantly ignored until much later, and for many years the state of dinosaur research stagnated, possibly due to the effects of the Depression and World War II.|$|E
5000|$|In birds, the <b>clavicles</b> and interclavicle have {{fused to}} form a single Y-shaped bone, the furcula or [...] "wishbone" [...] which evolved from the <b>clavicles</b> found in coelurosaurian theropods.|$|R

5|$|The bowfin is an {{actinopterygii}} {{which means}} that the pectoral girdle is partly endochondral but mostly dermal bone. In this group of fishes the fins function to maneuver, brake, and for slight positional adjustments. The pectoral girdle of the bowfin has six parts. The post temporal, supracleithrum, postcleithrum, cleithrum, scapulacoracoid, and the <b>clavicle</b> make up the pectoral girdle.The pectoral girdle is attached to the skull. The pectoral girl is made of mostly dermal and some endochondral bone. The paired pectoral and pelvic fins of fish are homologous with the limbs of tetrapods.|$|E
5|$|The {{determination}} of an individual's age by anthropologists {{depends on whether}} or not the individual was an adult or a child. The {{determination of}} the age of children, under the age of 21, is usually performed by examining the teeth. When teeth are not available, children can be aged based on which growth plates are sealed. The tibia plate seals around age 16 or 17 in girls and around 18 or 19 in boys. The <b>clavicle</b> is the last bone to complete growth and the plate is sealed around age 25. In addition, if a complete skeleton is available anthropologists can count the number of bones. While adults have 206 bones, the bones of a child have not yet fused resulting in a much higher number.|$|E
5|$|Van Dijk {{achieved}} {{two stage}} {{victories in the}} Tour Féminin en Limousin and in the Giro della Toscana. In {{the middle of the}} season, Van Dijk suffered a <b>clavicle</b> fracture and as a result was hampered in the national championships. She finished 10th at the U-23 European Championships in Valkenburg and at the World University Cycling Championship, Van Dijk won the individual time trial and finished second in the road race. At the end of the season, Van Dijk was a reserve at the road world championships but she did not race. At the Dutch National Track Championships she won bronze in the individual pursuit.|$|E
40|$|After {{intubation}} in newborn infants, {{the placement}} of the endotracheal tube in the trachea must be checked by a chest radiograph. The most commonly used reference point for placement is the medial ends of the <b>clavicles.</b> The position of the <b>clavicles</b> may be variable. The present study was carried out to determine whether the body of the first thoracic vertebra should be used instead of the <b>clavicles</b> because its position on chest radiographs is more constant. Seventy eight radiographs obtained from 35 neonates were examined prospectively. The carina was situated between T 3 and T 5, most commonly at T 3 - 4 or T 4 (85 %). The position of the <b>clavicles</b> varied markedly from patient to patient and within the same patient on different days, and this variation was significantly higher than that of the carina. On 65 (83 %) examinations the <b>clavicles</b> lay above the first thoracic vertebra. It is recommended that, for accurate placement within the trachea, the tip of the endotracheal tube should be placed {{at the level of the}} body of the first thoracic vertebra; this could be used as the sole reference point on chest radiographs obtained in the neonatal period...|$|R
40|$|Five {{patients}} had persistent, pulling {{pain in the}} sternum, <b>clavicles,</b> and upper ribs that was exacerbated by cold and dampness. Clublike, symmetrical enlargement of the <b>clavicles</b> was seen and, in two patients, venous congestion of {{the upper half of}} the body. All {{patients had}} a constantly elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Radiologically there was symmetrical hyperostosis of the sternal and middle portions of the <b>clavicles,</b> synostosis of the sternoclavicular joints, a widened and thickened sternum, and varying degrees of involvement of the upper ribs. X-ray findings did not change over several years. Phlebography showed bilateral subclavian vein occlusion in three patients and unilateral occlusion in one. Biopsies of the <b>clavicles</b> showed a characteristic hyperostotic sclerosis of the spongiosa. The cause of this sternocostoclavicular hyperostosis is unknown, but clinical, radiologic, and histologic findings indicate that it may represent a distinct, hitherto undescribed entity. R E C E N T L Y we treated five patients with painful swell ing of the <b>clavicles,</b> sternum, and upper ribs. The symptoms had developed in a relapsing fashion over periods of sev-eral years.

5000|$|Heilmann {{published}} an English revision of his series of Danish papers in 1926 as The Origin of Birds. Like Thomas Huxley, Heilmann compared Archaeopteryx and other birds to an exhaustive list of prehistoric reptiles, and {{also came to}} the conclusion that theropod dinosaurs like Compsognathus were the most similar. However, Heilmann noted that birds possessed <b>clavicles</b> fused to form a bone called the furcula (wishbone), and while <b>clavicles</b> were known in more primitive reptiles, they had not yet been recognized in theropod dinosaurs. A firm believer in Dollos Law, which states that evolution is not reversible, Heilmann could not accept that <b>clavicles</b> were lost in dinosaurs and re-evolved in birds, so he was forced to rule out dinosaurs as bird ancestors and ascribe all of their similarities to convergence. Heilmann stated that bird ancestors would instead be found among the more primitive thecodont grade of reptiles. [...] Heilmanns extremely thorough approach ensured that his book became a classic in the field and its conclusions on bird origins, as with most other topics, were accepted by nearly all evolutionary biologists for the next four decades, despite the discovery of <b>clavicles</b> in the primitive theropod Segisaurus in 1936. <b>Clavicles</b> and even fully developed furculae have since been identified in numerous other non-avian dinosaurs.|$|R
5|$|Beth Phoenix {{became the}} number one {{contender}} for the Women's Title after winning a Diva battle royal at SummerSlam. At the Unforgiven pay-per-view, however, Candice successfully retained her title in their match by countering one of Phoenix's moves with a crucifix pin. Their feud continued when Phoenix pinned Candice during a non-title mixed tag team match on Raw on September 24. At No Mercy on October 7, Candice dropped the title to Phoenix, ending her reign as Women's Champion. On October 22, Candice legitimately cracked her <b>clavicle</b> during her rematch for the Women's Title against Phoenix in a {{two out of three}} falls match; Phoenix ran into the ropes, causing Candice to fall face-first off of the turnbuckle onto her face, neck, and shoulders necessitating a rushed finish and putting her out of action for 14 weeks.|$|E
5|$|Royton {{railway station}} {{lay at the}} end of a branch from Royton Junction on the Oldham Loop Line, which was part of the route which {{connected}} Manchester, Oldham and Rochdale. The station was opened in 1864 and closed in April 1966. It featured steep gradients on the line up to Royton Junction, which, in October 1908, caused an accident when a goods train ran out of control on the gradient down to the station, killing a fireman. In February 1961, a four-coach runaway train crashed through the buffers at Royton railway station and continued on over High Barn Street. Five houses were damaged. The driver of the train was injured, but there were no fatal or severe injuries to the public. Five people from the damaged houses were taken to hospital suffering from shock and bruises, and in one case a fractured <b>clavicle.</b>|$|E
5|$|Since the {{discovery}} of rudimentary and nonfunctional clavicles in ceratopsians, {{it was assumed that}} these shoulder bones were reduced in all dinosaurs that did not have true furculae. Robert Bakker (1987) suggested that this would have allowed the shoulder blades to swing with the forelimbs in quadrupedal dinosaurs, increasing their functional forelimb length. This would have reduced the discrepancy of length between fore- and hindlimbs in a quadrupedal Massospondylus. However, a recent discovery shows that Massospondylus possessed well-developed clavicles that were joined in a furcula-like arrangement, acting like a clasp between the right and left shoulder blades and prohibiting any rotation of these bones. This discovery indicates that the <b>clavicle</b> reduction is limited to the evolutionary line leading to the ceratopsians. It also indicates that the furcula of birds is derived from clavicles.|$|E

5|$|By 1824, the {{material}} available to Buckland consisted of specimen OUM J13505, {{a piece of}} a right lower jaw with a single erupted tooth; OUM J13577, a posterior dorsal vertebra; OUM J13579, an anterior caudal vertebra; OUM J13576, a sacrum of five sacral vertebrae; OUM J13585, a cervical rib; OUM J13580, a rib; OUM J29881, an ilium of the pelvis, OUM J13563, a piece of the pubic bone; OUM J13565, a part of the ischium; OUM J13561, a thighbone and OUM J13572, the lower part of a second metatarsal. As he himself was aware, these did not all belong to the same individual; only the sacrum was articulated. Because they represented several individuals, the described fossils formed a syntype series. By modern standards, from these a single specimen has to be selected to serve as the type specimen on which the name is based. In 1990, Ralph Molnar chose the famous dentary (front part of the lower jaw), OUM J13505, as such a lectotype. Because he was unaccustomed to the deep dinosaurian pelvis, much taller than with typical reptiles, Buckland misidentified several bones, interpreting the pubic bone as a fibula and mistaking the ischium for a <b>clavicle.</b> Buckland identified the organism as being a giant animal belonging to the Sauria – the Lizards, at the time seen as including the crocodiles – and he placed it in the new genus Megalosaurus, repeating an estimate by Cuvier that the largest pieces he described, indicated an animal twelve metres long in life.|$|E
25|$|When a {{fracture}} occurs, the doctor tries {{to bring the}} bones into a position that will promote healing and restore arm movement. If the <b>clavicle</b> is fractured, the patient must at first wear a strap and sling around the chest to keep the <b>clavicle</b> in place. After removing the strap and sling, the doctor will prescribe exercises to strengthen the shoulder and restore movement. Surgery is occasionally needed for certain <b>clavicle</b> fractures, especially for disunions.|$|E
