40|$|High {{speed drive}} shafts are {{traditionally}} balanced using trim balance weights {{applied to the}} shaft ends. This paper considers the development and theoretical analysis of a novel and alternative strategy of balancing long flexible coupling shafts, whereby the trim balancing weights are applied by the means {{of a pair of}} 'Balancing Sleeve' arms that are integrally attached to each end of the <b>coupling</b> <b>shaft.</b> The trim balance weights are intended to apply a corrective centrifugal force to the <b>coupling</b> <b>shaft</b> in order to limit shaft end reaction forces. With increasing speed, the magnitude of the corrective force also increases due to the flexibility of the balance sleeve. This thereby counteracts the increased <b>coupling</b> <b>shaft</b> unbalance resulting from its own flexibility. Additionally, it is also found that the mechanism imparts a corrective bending moment to the <b>coupling</b> <b>shaft</b> ends, which has a tendency to limit deflection. The methodology is modelled as a rotating simply supported shaft with uniform eccentricity and allows application to the problem of drivetrain balancing of sub- 15 MW industrial gas turbines. Results show that reaction loads can theoretically be reduced from 10, 000 N to approximately zero. The bending moment applied to the shaft is also shown to reduce shaft deflection theoretically to zero. In practical applications this will be unrealistic and achievable results show deflection theoretically reduced by half. Analysis of the balance sleeve feasibility is considered through use of a three-dimensional finite element model. Further to this paper, the aim is to develop a full dynamic model of both shaft and counterbalance sleeve, with verification coming from scaled, experimental test facilities.

Firstly, {{based on}} the {{structure}} of tufted carpet looms (DHGN 801 D- 400), the lumped parameter models were built, in which included the massless shafts, lumped masses, disk and elastic support.

In this article, the <b>coupling</b> <b>shaft</b> is treated as the Timoshenko beam elements and is synthesized with the lumped-mass method of the two helical gear pairs.

After comparing the theoretical data with the practical results, the following conclusions are drawn: (1) the dynamic model with the Timoshenko beam element is quite appropriate and reliable in the dynamic analysis of double-helical gear transmission and is of great theoretical value in the accurate dynamic research of the double-helical gear transmission. (2) In both theoretical analysis and experimental measurements, the dynamic factors of gear pair diminish with the increase in the input torque and augment with the increase in the input speed.

40|$|Traditional {{techniques}} for balancing long, flexible, high-speed rotating shafts are inadequate over {{a full range}} of shaft speeds. This problem is compounded by limitations within the manufacturing process, which have resulted in increasing problems with lateral vibrations and hence increased the failure rates of bearings in practical applications. There is a need to develop a novel strategy for balancing these coupling shafts that is low cost, robust under typically long-term operating conditions and amenable to on-site remediation. This paper proposes a new method of balancing long, flexible couplings by means of a pair of balancing sleeve arms that are integrally attached to each end of the <b>coupling</b> <b>shaft.</b> Balance corrections are applied to the free ends of the arms in order to apply a corrective centrifugal force to the <b>coupling</b> <b>shaft</b> in order to limit shaft-end reaction forces and to impart a corrective bending moment to the drive shaft that limits shaft deflection. The aim {{of this paper is to}} demonstrate the potential of this method, via the mathematical analysis of a plain, simply supported tube with uniform eccentricity and to show that any drive shaft, even with irregular geometry and/or imbalance, can be converted to an equivalent encastre case. This allows for the theoretical possibility of eliminating the first simply supported critical speed, thereby reducing the need for very large lateral critical speed margins, as this requirement constrains design flexibility. Although the analysis is performed on a sub 15 MW gas turbine, it is anticipated that this mechanism would be beneficial on any shaft system with high-flexibility/shaft deflection...|$|E

40|$|This {{project will}} {{investigate}} {{the economic and}} technical potential of decoupled drive structures for servo presses. The original working hypotheses about economic potentials that decoupling leads to -higher dynamics, -Energy savings and -lower cost, were undetectable. These effects occur only to a small extent {{even in the best}} case. Nevertheless, one can see in the decoupling of the drive trains economic potential. This refers mainly to the development of universal drive modules. Through such modules, possibly designed by modular principle, the design and manufacturing costs for servo presses can be reduced. Another aspect is the possibility of the flexible arrangement of these modules without geometric restrictions that result from the coupling elements. For analysis of the technical potential of decoupled drive structures initially a property analysis of the coupled machine was performed and their tilting behavior was determined. It was found that the resulting tilt of the plunger is determined by three effects 1. translational stiffness of the drive trains (eccentric gear, connecting rod, stroke adjustment, overload protection); 2. translational stiffness of the press frame; 3. rotatory stiffness of the <b>coupling</b> <b>shaft.</b> The synchronization of the drive train is of significant importance for the decoupled drive structure. There have been developed and implemented various concepts for the synchronization control. The classic synchronization concept shows almost the same tilting behavior as the coupled drive structure. This behavior was expected, since in this case only the <b>coupling</b> <b>shaft</b> has been replaced by an "electric shaft". An extension of this concept by a superimposed tilt controller, which is to compensate the influence of the translational stiffness, proved to be problematic. The reason is the strong tendency to instability of this controller, caused by clearance and non-linearities in the drive train. The expected improvement of the tilting behavior could not be detected...|$|E

The transmission {{is based on the}} layout of pure-rolling indexing cam mechanisms, for it is intended to elim-inate backlash and friction, which are the main drawbacks of gear transmissions. The design relies on a unified methodology for in-dexing cam mechanisms, whereby the same procedure is used to design planar, spherical, and spatial mechanisms. Two versions of the speed reducer, that we term Speed-o-Cam, are described here, namely, planar, to <b>couple</b> <b>shafts</b> of parallel axes, and spher-ical, to <b>couple</b> <b>shafts</b> of intersecting axes. By means of a cas-cade of two planar versions of Speed-o-Cam, moreover, coaxial <b>shafts</b> can be <b>coupled.</b> Moreover, contrary to other alternatives to gear transmissions, such as harmonic drives or epicyclic trans-missions, Speed-o-Cam caters to shafts with either parallel or in-tersecting axes; in the latter case, moreover, the angle at which the axes intersect can vary from 0 to 180 continuously. The de-sign with shaft axes at 0 leads to an internal cam, i. e., one with its axis external to the axes of the follower and the roller in con-tact; for shaft axes at 180, the design leads to an external cam, i. e., one with its axis lying between those of the follower and the roller in contact...|$|R

40|$|In {{measuring}} the power output of an engine, the engine {{has to be}} coupled to a load device known as dynamometer. The coupling is done {{by means of a}} solid shaft. The proper couplings and shaft are required for the connection to avoid any failure to the engine or the dynamometer. Unsuitable selection could lead to undesired problems such as torsional vibrations, vibration of the engine and dynamometer, whirling of the <b>coupling</b> <b>shaft,</b> damage of the bearings, engine starting problem or immoderate wear of the shaft line components. The commonly encountered problem is the resonance in torsional vibration, which results in disastrous failure of the shaft due to excessive vibration. This project is aimed to study the appropriate design of the shaft {{to be used in the}} dynamometer-engine coupling to prevent the system from undergoing unwanted problems. The theoretical calculations involve in the design are presented. The dimension of the coupling shafts for engines with various maximum torques are estimated. It is shown that the diameter of the shaft is proportional to the maximum torque of the engine given that the same coupling is used for every system, whereas the length of the shaft is almost equal for every engine. The diameter of the shaft is a vital parameter compared to its length. For engines with the maximum torque vary from 40 to 200 Nm, the same shaft length of 500 mm can be used but with increasing shaft diameter as the maximum torque increases. For a 40 Nm engine, the shaft diameter of 20 mm generated acceptable result. The shaft diameter was increased by 5 mm as the maximum torque increases and acceptable results were obtained. On the other hand, by using aluminium instead of steel as the material of the shaft, lower critical engine speed is obtained given that the same dimension of the shaft is used. This is due to the fact that aluminium possesses lower modulus of rigidity in comparison to steel...|$|E
40|$|Wind {{energy is}} a {{renewable}} and sustainable {{kind of energy}} that is becoming increasingly important in the last decades. The technologies converting wind energy into usable forms of electricity are developed as alternatives to traditional power plants that rely on fossil fuels. The smallest wind turbines are used for applications such as battery charging or auxiliary power on boats; while large grid-connected wind turbines are designed to generate commercial electricity. This thesis focuses on modeling, control and simulation of a 500 KW prototype wind turbine that is being developed {{in the context of}} the MILRES (National Wind Energy Systems) Project in Turkey. Aerodynamic, mechanical, and electrical models are built in both Samcef for Wind Turbines (S 4 WT) and Matlab/Simulink environments. S 4 WT enables to choose each of the turbine components to be used in the composition of prototype wind turbine model, to design their characteristics and the way in which they are connected together and to analyze the behavior of the prototype model. The standard components (tower, bedplate, rotor, rotor shaft, gearbox, generator and <b>coupling</b> <b>shaft)</b> have been used compatible with the IEC 61400 - 1 in S 4 WT to perform the simulations. The dynamic equations of aerodynamic, mechanical and electrical models are also modeled in Matlab/Simulink environment. The main control purpose of the wind turbines is to maximize energy efficiency. However, the turbine must also be protected from excessive loads at different wind speeds. To achieve this goal, generated power curve should be close to the ideal power curve that depicts the optimum energy gathering from the wind depending on the wind speed. The prototype wind turbine is designed to have a nominal power of 500 KW at a nominal wind speed of around 11 m/s. Ideal power curve has two operating regions: Partial load operating region and full load operating region. Partial load operating region has wind speeds lower than the nominal wind speed and full load operating region has wind speeds above the nominal wind speed. The pitch and torque controllers are used to achieve an actual power curve that is very close to the ideal one. A pitch function and a standard PI controller with gain scheduling have been used to control the pitch angle of the blades to limit the power at the full load operating region in S 4 WT environment. In Matlab/Simulink environment, a simple Proportional (P) controller is used for the pitch controller. The generator torque which consists of an optimal mode gain method is employed in S 4 WT environment. A sliding mode controller (SMC) is utilized in Matlab/Simulink environment for controlling the torque. Torque controllers which are designed in both environments are used to control the power at both partial and full load operating regions. Kaimal turbulence model has been used to generate realistic wind profiles in TurbSim that can be integrated with S 4 WT. The performance analysis of 500 KW wind turbine prototype is done for both the partial load and full load operating regions under the power production scenario in S 4 WT environment. A similar analysis is also carried out in Matlab/Simulink environment using the models and controllers developed in this environment. The prototype turbine is tested under several other scenarios including start up, emergency stop, shut down and parked in S 4 WT. Simulation results both in S 4 WT and Matlab are quite successful...|$|E
