He sat long enough for the declining sun to dip behind the roofs of the town at his back, and throw the shadow of the houses on the lake front over the islet, before he pulled out of his pocket a fountain pen, opened a small notebook on his knee, and began to write quickly, raising his eyes now and then at the <b>connecting</b> <b>arm</b> of the bridge. These glances were needless; the people crossing over in the distance seemed unwilling even to look at the islet where the exiled effigy of the author of the Social Contract sat enthroned above the bowed head of Razumov in the sombre immobility of bronze. After finishing his scribbling, Razumov, with a sort of feverish haste, put away the pen, then rammed the notebook into his pocket, first tearing out the written pages with an almost convulsive brusqueness. But the folding of the flimsy batch on his knee was executed with thoughtful nicety. That done, he leaned back in his seat and remained motionless, the papers holding in his left hand. The twilight had deepened. He got up and began to pace to and fro slowly under the trees.|$|E

NOTES is a newly emerging surgical technique that eliminates external incisions on patients’ skin. As a result, better cosmetics, shorter recovery time, and reduced risk of external infection can be achieved. Research has been ongoing in academia and industry to make this surgical procedure more feasible in human surgeries. Although several robotic platforms have been developed, none of them has the required capability to provide surgeons with the most appropriate tool in a safe and timely matter during surgery. This robotic manipulator is designed to solve the problem. The background and motivation are elaborated further, followed by the design premise of such a manipulator. Three generations of manipulators that have been fabricated are then detailed.

40|$|Airborne {{wind energy}} systems {{consist of a}} lifting body and a tether. Several {{airborne}} wind energy systems have been created by others, but the most promising consists of a wing which translates through the air in a crosswind motion. Two computational models of a translating wing system were used to study the dynamics and performance of these systems. The rst model that was examined consists of a rigid <b>connecting</b> <b>arm</b> between a rotating base station and a wing. A study of this model showed that one can increase the power production of the system by changing the wing angle relative to the <b>connecting</b> <b>arm</b> during motion. Using a variable relative wing angle, an average power of 7 : 7 W is generated which is an increase of 30 % over the xed wing angle system. A second model was examined which used a exible tether that could change in length. For this system, power is generated as the tether is reeled o a drum at the base station when tether tension is high. The tether tension can be maximized by the optimal usage of the control parameters such as the reel-in and the bridle orientation of the kite-system.

40|$|We present {{gas flow}} {{models for the}} Milky Way based on {{high-resolution}} grid-based hydrodynamical simulations. The basic galactic potential we use is from a N-body model constrained by the density of red clump giants in the Galactic bulge. We augment this potential with a nuclear bulge, two pairs of spiral arms and additional mass at the bar end to represent the long bar component. With this combined model we can reproduce many features in the observed (l,v) diagram with a bar pattern speed of 33 km s^- 1 kpc^- 1 and a spiral pattern speed of 23 km s^- 1 kpc^- 1. The shape and kinematics of the nuclear ring, Bania's Clump 2, the <b>Connecting</b> <b>arm,</b> the Near and Far 3 -kpc arms, the Molecular Ring, and the spiral arm tangent points in our simulations are comparable {{to those in the}} observations.

40|$|Abstract. After a brief {{review of}} past N-body models of the Milky Way, I {{consider}} some of the difficulties that are inherent in the N-body approach to modelling any disk galaxy. 1. Past N-Body Models of the Milky Way Modern efforts at modelling the Milky Way (MW) take into account that it is barred. The first large effort in this regard was carried out by Fux (1997), who ran simulations of initially axisymmetric disk+bulge+halo systems. He then compared regularly spaced outputs with a de-reddened COBE K-band bulge map. He scaled the kinematics of his model by requiring that the velocity dispersion matches that of Baade’s window. A number of models provided reasonable fits to the data. His best fit bar angle to the sun-center line, ψbar = 28 ◦± 7 ◦. Later he added SPH gas to his simulations and was able to fit a number of features in the CO gas l − V diagram Fux (1999). He argued that the high-velocity <b>connecting</b> <b>arm</b> is due to the shocked gas within the near side of the bar. The gas distribution is also sensitive to the pattern speed of the bar, and he constrained this parameter to Ωb ∼ 50 km s− 1 kpc− 1. Widrow et al., (2008) modelled the Milky Way by matching observations (including th...|$|E
40|$|Many early type barred spiral galaxies exhibit strong dustlanes at {{the leading}} edges of their bar (e. g. NGC 1300, NGC 1433), which from gas {{velocity}} field measurements and numerical hydrodynamical simulations {{are known to}} be the loci of shearing shocks with velocity gaps up to 200 kms − 1 across. As an SBbc type galaxy, the Milky Way is expected to present similar dustlanes. Selfconsistent high resolution 3 D N-body and SPH simulations allow us to reliably identify their gaseous traces in the Galactic CO and HI ℓ −V distributions. The near-side branch of these dustlanes corresponds to the <b>connecting</b> <b>arm</b> feature and lies below (b 1. The CO observations suggest ℓ 1 = 14. 5 ◦ and ℓ 2 = − 4. 5 ◦, yielding the constraints shown in Fig. 1 d. The length s 1 increases for smaller inclination angles. If ϕ ≤ 30 ◦, then s 1 ≥ 2. 9 kpc, q ≤ 2 and, since s 1 < a and RCR ≈ 1. 2 a according to numerical simulations and early type galaxy analyses, where a is the semi major axis of the bar, RCR ≥ 3. 5 kpc (for R ◦ = 8 kpc).

40|$|We {{propose a}} new picture {{accounting}} for the dominant features in the observed ℓ−V distribution of the Milky Way gas within the central few kpcs, based on the gas flow in two self-consistent and symmetry-free barred dynamical models. These models are snapshots selected from high resolution 3 D N-body and SPH simulations with 4 × 10 6 stellar and dark particles and 1. 5 × 10 5 gas particles, and with initial conditions adapted from Fux (1997). The main results {{are shown in figure}} 1. In both models, the inclination angle of the bar relative to the Sun-Galactic centre line is 25 ◦, the corotation radius close to 4. 4 kpc and the sound speed of the gas 10 km s − 1. Gas dynamics in a rotating bar is driven by shocks which are believed to generate the dustlanes observed in external barred galaxies (Athanassoula 1992). Such shocks are also expected to exist in the Galaxy and the compressed gas behind them should produce a typical trace in the HI and CO ℓ − V diagrams. According to our models, the <b>connecting</b> <b>arm</b> is the signature of the near side branch of these dustlane shocks. The shocked gas plunges onto the nuclear disc/ring and is responsible for the terminal velocity peak. The far side branch of the shocks appears as an almost vertical feature in the model ℓ−V diagram, which is indeed visible in the CO data near ℓ = − 4 ◦. Some other vertical CO features, like the one at ℓ ≈ 5. 5 ◦, are understood as molecular clouds crossing the shock front and therefore undergoing a strong velocity gradient. The 135 -km/s arm, long ago suspected as the far side counterpart of the 3 -kpc arm, crosses the ℓ = 0 axis at higher absolute velocity than the latter, because the gas, moving almost parallel to the arm, falls closer to the nuclear disc/ring and hence reaches larger “forbidden ” velocities before crashing into the dustlane shock. This is a typical example of asymmetry missed by gas flow calculations which do not take into account odd modes. Note also how well the models are able to reproduce the molecular ring. 2 R. FU...|$|E
