40|$|Euhedral pyrite {{crystals}} in 46 open bedrock (granitoid) fractures at depths down {{to nearly}} 1  km were analysed for sulphur isotope ratios (δ 34 S) by the in situ secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) technique and by conventional bulk-grain analysis, and {{were compared with}} groundwater data. Twenty nine of the fractures sampled for pyrite had corresponding data for groundwater, including chemistry and isotopic ratios of sulphate, which provided {{a unique opportunity to}} compare the sulphur-isotopic ratios of pyrite and dissolved sulphate both at site and fracture-specific scales. Assessment of pyrite age and formation conditions were based on the geological evolution of the area (Laxemar, SE Sweden), and on data on co-genetic calcite as follows: (1) the isotopic ratios of the calcite crystals (δ 18 O, δ 13 C, 87 Sr/ 86 Sr) were compared with previously defined isotopic features of fracture mineral assemblages precipitated during various geological periods, and (2) the δ 18 O of the calcites were compared with the δ 18 O of groundwater in fractures corresponding to those where the calcite/pyrite assemblages were sampled. Taken together, the data show that all the sampled fractures carried pyrite/calcite that are low-temperature and precipitated from the current groundwater or similar pre-existing groundwater, except at depths of − 300 to − 600  m where water with a glacial component dominates and the crystals are from pre-modern fluids. An age of &# 60; 10  Ma are anticipated for the pre-modern fluids. The δ 34 Spyr showed huge variations across individual crystals (such as − 32 to + 73 ‰) and extreme minimum (− 50 ‰) and maximum (+ 91 ‰) values. For this kind of extreme S-isotopic variation at earth-surface conditions there is no other explanation than activity of sulphur reducing bacteria coupled with sulphate-limited conditions. Indeed, the most common subgrain feature was an increase in δ 34 Spyr values from interior to rim of the crystal, which we interpret are related to successively higher δ 34 S values of the dissolved source SO 42 − caused by ongoing bacterial sulphate reduction in fractures with low-flow or stagnant waters. The measured groundwater had δ 34 SSO 4 values of + 9 ‰ to + 37 ‰, with the highest values associated with low sulphate concentrations. These values are overall, and especially in the sulphate-poor waters down to − 400  m, somewhat higher than the anticipated initial values, and can thus, like for the 34 S-enriched pyrites, be explained by a Rayleigh distillation process driven by microbial sulphate reduction. An intriguing feature was that the δ 34 SSO 4 values of the groundwater were in no case reaching up to the values required to produce biogenic pyrite with δ 34 S values of + 40 ‰ to + 91 ‰. To explain this feature, we suggest that groundwater in low-flow fractures with near-stagnant water (carrying sulphate and pyrite with high δ 34 S) is masked by high-flow parts of the fracture system carrying groundwater that often <b>contains</b> <b>sulphate</b> in abundance and considerably less fractionated with respect to 34 S and 32 S. In order to gain detailed knowledge of chemical processes and patterns in groundwater in fractured rock, fracture-mineral investigations are a powerful tool, as we have shown here for the sulphur system...|$|E

40|$|In {{a typical}} mollusc, the shell {{is the most}} {{important}} defensive mechanism. But the shell does not protect the mollusc from all predators, and {{it is for this reason}} that secondary defensive mechanisms have evolved in many species. In some cases, these secondary mechanisms become more important than the shell as a means of protection from predators, and where this occurs selection may favour the reduction and even the total loss of the shell. The shell has been lost independently in each of the nine orders of the Opisthobranchia except the Thecosomata, and in the Sacoglossa and the Nudibranchia it may have been lost two or three times. In all of these cases where the shell-less or nudibranch condition has evolved, the animal must be adequately protected by defensive mechanisms other than the shell. This thesis studies the defensive mechanisms of a number of nudibranch molluscs. In the Sacoglossa there is a series of forms from the primitive Arthessa, with a well-developed defensive shell, through Oxynoandeuml; and Lobiger, with reduced shells, to the nudibranch Stiliger on the one hand and to the bivalved Berthelinia on the other. The defensive mechanisms of Berthelinia and Stiliger are compared. It is shown that even in Berthelinia. which is protected by a tightly closing bivalved shell, there is a secondary defensive mechanism in the form of a secretion from the hypobranchial gland. In Stiliger, the defensive mechanisms are located in the cerata. Three types of gland are present of which at least one, and probably all, are defensive. In addition the cerata can be autotomised and regenerated, and this may also be of defensive importance. It is also shown that the ceratal glands of Stiliger and the hypobranchial gland of Berthelinia are muscle-operated. It is concluded that in both Stiliger and Berthelinia the defensive system involves two or three defensive mechanisms; and there is evidence that these mechanisms act in series just as do the defensive mechanisms of many tropical insects. The defensive mechanisms of the Doridacea are discussed. It is concluded that camouflage is of widespread occurrence, but that there is as yet no evidence for the occurrence of warning coloration. Many bright colours are deflection marks, but the importance of other bright colours is still not known. Dorsal papillae with a probable defensive function are present in some species of the Doridacea, and they are usually supplied with glands. The function of the caryphyllidia of certain species is not known. Autotomy of papillae has not been described, but autotomy of the mantle edge occurs in the Discodoridinae. Defensive glands are of widespread occurrence in the Doridacea. One type of defensive gland that has not been described before in dorids is the acid gland of Discodoris pusae and Anisodoris stellifera. Acid secretion is well known from certain other opisthobranch and prosobranch molluscs, and the discovery of its occurrence in dorids means that it has evolved independently at least four times in the Mollusca. In D. pusae and A. stellifera, the acid glands are large subepidermal pits with a mucous plug and a muscular sphincter. The acid is inorganic and <b>contains</b> <b>sulphate</b> ions. It may register pH 1 or 2 close to the skin of the mollusc. Another species of Discodoris was found to secrete acid of a similar pH. In this species acid-secretion is from the ordinary epidermal cells, and subepidermal glands are totally absent. In the light of these results, the evolution of acid-secretion is discussed. In all four suborders of the Nudibranchia and in the Sacoglossa, species with dorsal papillae or cerata have evolved. In all cases where these have been studied, they have been found to be of defensive importance. Cerata usually contain glands, are mobile, can be autotomised without harm to the mollusc, and may have yet other defensive mechanisms. The Eolidacea are the best known of these groups with defensive dorsal papillae. In the eolids, some species are camouflaged, but none has been shown to possess warning coloration. Cerata may be brightly coloured to direct attacks away from the head, and the behaviour of the mollusc supports this view. Cerata can be autotomised and regenerated, but the ease with which autotomy occurs varies between different species, Cerata are especially sensitive at their tips, and it is shown that this is because there is a high concentration of neurosensory cilia in this region. Stimulation, by touch, of these cilia can cause ejection of nematocysts or of glandular secretions as a defensive response. Ceratal glands are described for a number of species of solid. The role of the cellules spéciales is discussed, and it is concluded that these are not of defensive importance. Their content of RNA and of protein suggests that they synthesize protein, and their high glycogen content suggests that they are storage cells. They may have a duct in some species, and could thus be excretory. Simple, unicellular mucous glands occur in probably all eolids, but they may be epidermal or subepidermal in different species. They probably protect the animal from abrasion. They may also be responsible for the mucin cuticle, or for the presence of a mucous film just outside the cuticle which is continuously being carried off the tips of the cerata by ciliary action. Mucous glands are the only glands present in some species, for example Eolis M and Tergipes despectus. In other acleioproct eolids there are glands which have a defensive functions the species of Catriona studied have two types of defensive gland, whilst the eubranchids studied have three and possibly five types of defensive gland. These defensive glands are usually concentrated at the tips of the cerata and are exuded when the animal is violently disturbed. Some of them are muscle-operated and are proteinaceous, others contain mucopolysaccharides or mucoproteins. In the smaller species of both Catriona and Eubranchus, the surface area of ceratal epithelium is limited, and the defensive glands are packed so as to utilize all available space. The method of packing the glands is different in the two genera, suggesting that it is a case of parallel evolution. It is further suggested that the defensive glands of Calma, Catriona and the Eubranchidae are convergent. In the cleioprocts studied, no such concentration of glands at the ceras tip was found, but all species possess two or more types of ceratal gland. There is evidence that some of these may be defensive in function. Nematocysts are used in defence by many eolids, but for them to be effective, they must be ejected from the cnidosac and an appreciable percentage of them must explode. It is shown that whilst nematocysts are frequently ejected and exploded as a defensive reaction, there is considerable variation between different species. In Calma, glands are of considerable defensive value, but nematocysts are totally absent; whilst in Tergipes despectus, defensive glands are absent and nematocysts are important in defence. Other species utilize both defensive mechanisms, but to varying extents. In the Cleioprocta generally, and particularly in the Aeolidiidae, glands are not of great importance in defence whilst nematocysts are; but in the Eubranchidae and in Catriona glands are well-developed and of considerable defensive importance. There is even variation within one genus. Thus Catriona tina rarely uses glands but frequently uses nematocysts in defence, whilst C. perca rarely uses nematocysts but frequently uses glands. This interspecific variation in behaviour is probably related to the different predators which different species of eolid are likely to encounter. The predators of nudibranchs in the sea are not well known, but laboratory experiments have demonstrated that many nudibranchs are relatively unpalatable to many species of fish. However, some species of fish are not deterred from eating eolids by nematocysts, and it is likely that it is with relation to these predators that glandular defensive mechanisms have evolved. Thus nematocysts may be protective against one set of predators whilst glands are protective against another set of predators. Nematocysts may be damaging not only to potential predators of eolids, but also to the eolid itself when it crawls over coelenterates. The mechanism by which eolids escape damage from nematocysts is not known, but there is evidence that the vesicular structure of the epidermis is involved. It is concluded that in many nudibranchs the defensive system involves several distinct mechanisms which come into action in series. There is some evidence that certain mechanisms are adapted to specific predators. The eolidiform condition is a particularly efficient defensive adaptation since it concentrates several mechanisms into that part of the mollusc which is expendible, and which is the first to be encountered by a potential predator.

This is the first electroanalytical study of a model mixture of sulphated polysaccharides in seawater and it is of great importance {{for the analysis of}} organic matter in seawater, especially acidic polysaccharides <b>containing</b> <b>sulphate</b> groups in the structure...|$|R

40|$|Proteoglycans were {{extracted}} from bovine corneal stroma with 4 M-guanidinum chloride, purified by DEAE-dellulose chromatography (Antonopoulos et al., 1974) and fractionated by precipitation with ethanol into three fractions of approximately equal weight. One of these fractions {{consisted of a}} proteoglycan that <b>contained</b> keratan <b>sulphate</b> as the only glycosaminoglycan. In the othertwo fractions proteoglycans that <b>contained</b> chondroitin <b>sulphate,</b> dermatan sulphate and keratan sulphate were present. Proteoglycans which had a more than tenfold excess of galactosaminoglycans over keratan sulphate could be obtianed by further subfractionation. The gel-chromatographic patterns of the glucosaminoglycans before and after digestion with chondroitinase AC differed for the fractions. The individual chondroitin sulphate chains seemed to be larger in cornea than in cartilage. Oligosaccharides, possibly covalently linked to the protein core of the proteoglycans, could be isolated from all fractions. The corneal proteoglycans were shown to have higher protein contents and to be of smaller molecular size than cartilage proteoglycans...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Brines {{from the}} Debowiec {{formation}} in the Morcinek Coal Mine <b>contain</b> <b>sulphates.</b> Their concentration varies from 60 to 800 mg/dm 3. Sulphates are important because they may remove barium from the other mine waters in the Morcinek Coal Mine. Two different values of the isotopic composition of sulphates were noticed. The values δ 34 S from + 12. 09 ‰ to + 14. 27 ‰ and δ 18 O from + 12, 06 ‰ to + 13, 7 ‰ suggested the dissolution of marine sulphates from the Permian to the Cretaceous ages. Value δ 34 S=- 4. 67 ‰ shows that sulphate originate from hydrogen sulphide which {{is the product of}} the reduction of sulphates. The results seem to indicate that is only one source of sulphates. The sulphur from hydrogen sulphide comes to the water by the reaction of the oxidation with calcite...|$|R
40|$|Proteoglycans were {{extracted}} from the adult human meniscus under dissociative conditions and purified by CsCl-density-gradient centrifugation. The preparations of highest density contained proteoglycan that possessed the ability to interact with hyaluronic acid, was of large subunit size and was composed of chondroitin sulphate, keratan sulphate and sialic acid-containing oligosaccharides. This 'cartilage-like' proteoglycan also exhibited subunit and aggregate structures analogous to those of hyaline-cartilage proteoglycans when examined by electron microscopy. However, the composition of this proteoglycan was more comparable with proteoglycans from immature cartilage than from age-matched cartilage. The preparations from lower density, which were enriched in dermatan <b>sulphate,</b> <b>contained</b> smaller proteoglycan that {{was not able to}} interact with hyaluronic acid. This non-aggregating proteoglycan may be structurally distinct from the 'cartilage-like' proteoglycan, which does not <b>contain</b> dermatan <b>sulphate...</b>|$|R
40|$|A method using a {{mechanical}} procedure for isolation of lymphocytes from the epithelium of human intestinal mucosa allows {{the study of}} some of their characteristics and functions. Most of the isolated cells are of the T lineage (E+ and T 3 +) and express the phenotype associated with cytotoxic-suppressor T cells (T 8). A large number contain intracytoplasmic granules. Granules are stained with alcian blue (pH 2. 2), are metachromatic with Toluidine blue (pH 4) and some are shown to incorporate 35 sulphate, suggesting that they <b>contain</b> <b>sulphated</b> mucopolysaccharides. As these cells are similar in many respects to the large granular lymphocytes that mediate natural killer activity in the peripheral blood, their natural cytotoxicity was tested against K 562 target cells. No activity was detected among the human intraepithelial lymphocytes and treatments with known potentiators of natural killer activity, ie, interferon or PHA-depleted conditioned medium containing Il- 2, failed to reveal any cytotoxic activity...|$|R
40|$|Several {{methods were}} tested to {{optimise}} sulphate reduction and minimise methane formation in thermophilic (65 °) expanded granular sludge bed reactors fed with a medium <b>containing</b> <b>sulphate</b> and methanol. Lowering the pH from 7. 5 to 6. 75 {{resulted in a}} rapid decrease of methane formation and a concomitant increase in sulphate reduction. The inhibition of methane formation was irreversible on the short-term. Lowering the COD/SO 42 - ratio (COD: chemical oxygen demand) from 6 to 0. 34 (g/g) rapidly favoured sulphate reduction over methanogenesis. Continuous addition of 2 g L- 1 2 -bromoethanesulphonate was ineffective as complete inhibition of methanogenesis was obtained only for two days. Inhibition of methanogens by sulphide at pH 7. 5 was only effective when the total sulphide concentration was above 1200 mg S L- 1. For practical applications, a relatively short exposure to a slightly acidic pH in combination with operating the reactor at a volumetric methanol-COD loading rate close to the maximum volumetric sulphide-COD formation rate...|$|R
40|$|Proteoglycans {{extracted}} from separated specimens of healthy human gingival epithelium and from connective tissue have been purified. The epithelial proteoglycans fractionated {{as a single}} included peak on Sepharose 4 B-CL and <b>contained</b> heparan <b>sulphate</b> and dermatan sulphate glycosaminoglycans. The connective-tissue proteoglycans separated into three major populations on Sepharose 4 B-CL, {{one of which was}} excluded from this gel under associative conditions (0. 5 M-sodium acetate, pH 7. 4). Subsequent fractionation of the excluded material under dissociative conditions (4 M-guanidinium chloride/ 0. 05 M-sodium acetate, pH 7. 4) revealed an absence of any aggregate formation of molecules within this population. The connective-tissue proteoglycans <b>contained</b> heparan <b>sulphate,</b> dermatan sulphate and chondroitin 4 -sulphate, the proportions of which varied with the molecular size of the proteoglycans. Amino acid analysis of the protein cores of gingival-epithelial and connective-tissue proteoglycans revealed differences that were similar to the differences described between other types of proteoglycans such as those from skin...|$|R
