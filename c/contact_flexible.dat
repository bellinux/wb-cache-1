40|$|Hyperthermia is a {{powerful}} radiosensitizer for treatment of superficial tumors. This requires body conformal antennas with a power distribution as homogeneous as possible over the skin area. The <b>contact</b> <b>flexible</b> microstrip applicators (CFMA) operating at 434 MHz exist in several sizes, including the large size 3 H and 5 H. This paper investigates {{the behavior of the}} electromagnetic fields for the 3 H and 5 H CFMA in both flat and curved configurations, and the impact on performance parameters like the penetration depth (PD) and the effective heating depth (EHD). The underlying theory behind the electromagnetic behavior in curved situations is presented as well as numerical simulations of both flat and curved configurations. The results are compared to measurements of the electromagnetic field distributions in a cylindrical patient model. Due to their large size multimode solutions may exist, and our results confirm their existence. These multimode solutions affect both the power distribution and PD/EHD, with a dependence on applicator curvature. Therefore, the performance parameters like PD and EHD need to be carefully assessed when bending large size CFMA applicators to conform to the patient body. This conclusion also holds for other types of large size surface current applicator...|$|E
40|$|Contact {{inspection}} of welds on steel pipe can be drastically disturbed by the irregular surface. These specific conditions can come from an overlay repair covering entirely the weld. This overlay presents an irregular state of surface on the outside diameter of the pipe that strongly limits the use of conventional ultrasonic probes in a contact configuration. Further to the works carried out by CEA on a new concept of <b>contact</b> <b>flexible</b> probe (TCI), EPRI asked CEA to estimate the feasibility of using such a technique to perform the inspection through a representative overlay surface. The principle of this method {{is based on the}} use of a smart flexible linear phased array integrating a specific instrumentation. Such a probe is able to fit the inspection surface, optimizing the coupling conditions and preserving the orientation of the ultrasonic beam through the irregular surface. This paper deals with the design of such a transducer. This study has involved the definition of a number of mechanical constraints to combine with acoustical ones. Acoustical properties of the selected transducer have then been simulated and appreciated by means of the CIVA software developed by the CEA. Moreover, an experimental validation has allowed detecting a defect through a realistic irregular profile by using this kind of transducer. Experimental and theoretical studies are presented, that shows the feasibility of such a control. 2...|$|E

One phantom was box-shaped {{with a flat}} top layer of 1 cm thick artificial fat {{and the other one}} a tube of which the cross-section was elliptically shaped (25 x 36 cm) having a fat equivalent shell of 1 cm thick. For the muscle material a 6 g/l saline (NaCl) solution was used. On the flat rectangular phantom, the effective field size at 1 cm depth in saline was measured to be 4. 7 x 13. 5 cm, 17. 5 x 17. 7 cm and 12. 5 x 14. 0 cm for the 1 H-applicator, the 3 H-applicator and the 5 H-applicator, respectively. For the 3 H-and the 5 H-applicator, the Specific absorption rate (SAR) distribution at 1 cm depth showed a single maximum of SAR for a thin bolus, which split into two separate "hot spots' for a thicker bolus. The Effective Heating Depths in the phantom with a flat surface were of the order of that of a plane wave (approximately 1. 4 cm), whereas a larger EHD of 2. 4 cm was achieved below the 3 H-applicator bent to fit the elliptical phantom. Due to the large effective field size and the "flatness' of the SAR distribution, the applicators 3 H and 5 H are suitable to adequately treat large superficial tumour...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: <b>Contact</b> <b>flexible</b> {{microstrip}} applicators (CFMA), {{operating at}} 434 MHz, are applied at the Academic Medical Center (AMC) for superficial hyperthermia (e. g. chest wall recurrences and melanoma). This paper investigates {{the performance of}} CFMA, evaluating {{the stability of the}} specific absorption rate (SAR) distribution, effective heating depth (EHD) and effective field size (EFS) under different conditions. Methods: Simulations were performed using finite differences and were compared to existing measurement data, performed using a rectangular phantom with a superficial fat-equivalent layer of 1 cm and filled with saline solution. The electrode plates of the applicators measure similar to 7 x 20, 29 x 21 and 20 x 29 cm(2). Bolus thickness varied between 1 and 2 cm. The impact of the presence of possible air layers between the rubber frame and the electrodes on the SAR distribution was investigated. Results: The EHD was similar to 1. 4 cm and the EFS ranged between similar to 60 and similar to 300 cm(2), depending on the applicator type. Both measurements and simulations showed a split-up of the SAR focus with a 2 cm water bolus. The extent and location of air layers has a strong influence on the shape and size of the iso-SAR contours with a value higher than 50 %, but the impact on EFS and EHD is limited. Conclusion: Simulations, confirmed by measurements, showed that the presence of air between the rubber and the electrodes changes the iso-SAR contours, but the impact on the EFS and EHD is limite...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To characterise and {{evaluate}} the capacitive <b>Contact</b> <b>Flexible</b> Microstrip Applicator operating at 70 MHz, CFMA- 70. This applicator is introduced {{for the treatment of}} superficial tumours with extension in depth beyond the range of regular superficial applicators. Methods: E-field measurements were performed in an elliptical phantom filled with a saline solution using an E-field vector probe. E-field distributions and SAR patterns are compared to those of the CFMA- 434 and of 70 MHz waveguides. The applicator has been used for the treatment of 6 patients with breast cancer with a tumour depth exceeding 4 cm. Results: The effective heating depth of the CFMA- 70 is 50 % larger than for the CFMA- 434. Its effective field size is 26 x 20 cm (aperture 29 x 20 cm), larger than for an equally sized CFMA- 434. In contrast to the CFMA- 434 the SAR pattern of this applicator is insensitive to the bolus thickness. Comparison to 70 MHz waveguides shows that the E-field component normal to the applicator is 100 % larger for the CFMA- 70. During clinical applications acceptable temperatures were realised for individual sessions (also at depth), but in many cases treatment limiting hot spots occurred close to superficial bony structures near the applicator edge. Both surface irregularities and the normal field component may be responsible. Conclusions: The CFMA- 70 has adequate penetration depth for the treatment of superficial tumours exceeding a depth of 4 cm. However, the relatively large normal E-field component may induce treatment-limiting hot spots at tissue interfaces in the direction normal to the applicator's surfac...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Motivation {{for this}} {{research}} was a patient with large and bulky melanoma lesions on a leg, treated with hyperthermia in a special set-up with an open water bolus and two opposing applicators. Treatment planning was used {{to find the most}} suitable heating method, comparing 70 MHz capacitive <b>contact</b> <b>flexible</b> microstrip applicators (CFMAs) and 70 MHz waveguides. Methods: The first three sessions were performed with CFMA applicators; the last session with waveguides. Power and water temperature were adjusted to achieve clinically relevant temperatures. Finite difference time domain (FDTD) simulations were performed for a CFMA and waveguide on a fat-muscle geometry to compare effective field size (EFS) and effective heating depth (EHD). A CT scan of the patient's leg was automatically segmented into muscle, fat and bone; tumour lesions were outlined manually. Patient simulations were performed to evaluate the 3 D heating pattern and to compare CFMAs and waveguides for equal power and water temperature. Results: Hyperthermia treatment was well tolerated. Temperature measurements indicated mainly superficial heating with CFMAs. Simulated EHD was 2. 1 and 2. 4 cm for CFMA and waveguide, respectively and EFS was 19. 6 x 16. 2 cm(2) and 19. 4 x 16. 3 cm(2). Simulation results showed a better tumour coverage using waveguides; absorbed power in the tumour was similar to 75 % higher with waveguides and absorption in fat was approximately twice as high with CFMAs. Simulations showed that a relatively high water temperature (similar to 42 degrees C) improves the overall temperature distribution. Conclusion: CFMAs and waveguides have a similar EFS and EHD, but for large extremity lesions, the performance of 70 MHz waveguides is favourable compared to 70 MHz CFMA applicator...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: <b>Contact</b> <b>flexible</b> {{microstrip}} applicators (CFMA) {{are applied}} for superficial hyperthermia. In the clinic these flexible applicators are mostly applied bent along the body curvature. This paper investigates the {{specific absorption rate}} (SAR) patterns of CFMA applicators, when bent around an elliptical tissue- equivalent phantom. Methods: The 2 H (aperture size 14. 8 x 14. 3 cm <SU 2 </SU), 3 H (28. 7 x 20. 7 cm <SU 2 </SU), 4 H (19. 6 x 19. 6 cm <SU 2 </SU) and 5 H (19. 7 x 28. 5 cm <SU 2 </SU) applicators were examined. Measurements were performed for the 5 H applicator; existing measurement data were analysed for the 3 H applicator. Finite difference time domain (FDTD) simulations with a resolution of 2 x 2 x 1 mm <SU 3 </SU were performed for all applicators. Applicators were bent around the top and {{the side of the}} elliptical phantom to examine different curvatures. The SAR deposition, effective field size (EFS) and effective heating depth (EHD) were evaluated and compared to results for straight applicators. Results: Bending the applicators generally yielded a focusing effect of the SAR, which was most pronounced with a strong curvature, but especially the 5 H applicator showed a stronger power absorption at the sides of the applicator, compared to the centre region. The EFS became smaller when bending the applicators; this effect was also more pronounced for a strong curvature. The EHD increased for bent applicators, but the degree depended strongly on the location. Conclusion: The behaviour of bent CFMA applicators is not trivial and the SAR deposition is not similar for all applicators. The EFS decreases and the EHD increases, but very locally. Therefore, it is generally advisable to analyse the SAR distribution of flexible applicators in both straight and bent stat...|$|E
40|$|Printing {{methods are}} fast {{becoming}} important processing techniques for the fabrication of flexible electronics. Some goals for flexible electronics are to produce cheap, lightweight, disposable {{radio frequency identification}} (RFID) tags, very large flexible displays that can be produced in a roll-to-roll process and wearable electronics for both the clothing and medical industries. Such applications will require fabrication processes for the assembly of dissimilar materials onto a common substrate {{in ways that are}} compatible with organic and polymeric materials as well as traditional solid-state electronic materials. A transfer printing method has been developed with these goals and application in mind. This printing method relies primarily on differential adhesion where no chemical processing is performed on the device substrate. It is compatible {{with a wide variety of}} materials with each component printed in exactly the same way, thus avoiding any mixed processing steps on the device substrate. The adhesion requirements of one material printed onto a second are studied by measuring the surface energy of both materials and by surface treatments such as plasma exposure or the application of self-assembled monolayers (SAM). Transfer printing has been developed within the context of fabricating organic electronics onto plastic substrates because these materials introduce unique opportunities associated with processing conditions not typically required for traditional semiconducting materials. Compared to silicon, organic semiconductors are soft materials that require low temperature processing and are extremely sensitive to chemical processing and environmental contamination. The transfer printing process has been developed for the important and commonly used organic semiconducting materials, pentacene (Pn) and poly(3 -hexylthiophene) (P 3 HT). A three-step printing process has been developed by which these materials are printed onto an electrode subassembly consisting of previously printed electrodes separated by a polymer dielectric layer all on a plastic substrate.

Experiment 1 involved finger <b>contact</b> with <b>flexible</b> filaments of different bending strengths, a flat surface, and an imagined spatial position. Contact with the flat surface was most effective in attenuating sway; the flexible filaments were much less effective but still significantly better than imagined contact. Experiment 2 compared the effectiveness of finger <b>contact</b> with a <b>flexible</b> filament, a rigid filament of the same diameter, a flat surface, and an imagined spatial position. The rigid filament and flat surface conditions were equally effective in attenuating body sway and were greatly superior to <b>contact</b> with the <b>flexible</b> filament, which was superior to imagined contact. Experiment 3 included five conditions: arms by sides; finger "contact" with an imagined spatial position; finger contact with a flat surface; finger <b>contact</b> with a <b>flexible</b> filament attempting to maintain it bent; and <b>contact</b> with the <b>flexible</b> filament attempting not to bend it. The arms by sides and finger "contact" with an imagined position conditions did not differ significantly; all three conditions involving actual finger contact showed significantly less center of pressure and hand sway, but contact with the flat surface was most effective in attenuating both postural and hand displacement. In all three experiments, the level of force applied in fingertip contact conditions was far below that necessary to provide mechanical stabilization. Our findings indicate that: (1) stimulation of a small number of receptors in the fingertip is adequate to allow stabilization of sway, (2) fingertip force levels as low as 5 - 10 g provide some stabilization, (3) contact with a stationary spatial referent is most effective, and (4) independent control of arm and torso occurs when finger contact is allowed...|$|R
