25|$|In recent years, {{debate on}} whether high-calorie soft drink vending {{machines}} {{should be allowed}} in schools {{has been on the}} rise. Opponents of the (soft drink) vending machines believe that soft drinks are a significant contributor to childhood obesity and tooth decay, and that allowing soft drink sales in schools encourages children to believe they are safe to consume in moderate to large quantities. Opponents argue that schools have a responsibility to look after the health of the children in their care, and that allowing children easy access to soft drinks violates that responsibility. Vending machine proponents believe that obesity is a complex issue and soft drinks are not the only cause. They also note the immense amount of funding that soft drink sales bring to schools. Some people take a more moderate stance, saying that soft drink machines should be allowed in schools, but that they should not be the only option available. They propose that when soft drink vending machines are made available on school grounds, the schools should be required to provide children with a choice of alternative drinks (such as fruit juice, flavored water and milk) at a <b>comparable</b> <b>price.</b> Some lawmakers debating the issue in different states have argued that parents—not the government—should be responsible for children's beverage choices.|$|E

40|$|Objective {{to analyze}} and {{evaluate}} the regional disparities of socioeconomic development of the Russian regions in terms of income differentiation adjusted for the level of inflation. 	Methods indicator by which to measure the level of regional growth heterogeneity is Gini coefficient allowing to determine the degree of the Russian regionsrsquo deviation from absolute equality. The unique feature of the authorrsquos approach is the calculation {{and analysis of the}} Gini coefficient not only in current prices but also in <b>comparable</b> <b>prices</b> of 1991. Thus the comparison of the Gini coefficient in terms of quotper capita incomequot in the period from 1991 to 2013 in <b>comparable</b> and current <b>prices</b> allows to estimate the impact of changes in the prices level on the dynamics of regional development. 	Results the article states that the regions differentiation by the level of economic development determines the necessity of considering this factor in economic policy areas. In these circumstances the analysis of income differentiation of the Russian regions has to take the impact of inflation into account. The article reviews the Russian and foreign research in the sphere of the income differentiation. Significant scientific interest 	to the problem of regional inequality is obvious over the past several decades. Approaches and methods of assessing the level of regional disparities are systematized as well as its key performance indicators. 	To assess the level of differentiation of Russian regions we used the Gini coefficient which was calculated not only by current but also by <b>comparable</b> <b>prices.</b> The calculation was carried out basing on the recalculation of the per capita income using the consumer price index. In the framework of the analysis the calculated Gini coefficient for per capita income by current and integrated prices allowed to observe the differential behavior of this indicator. In terms of quotper capita incomequot by current prices there is a strong tendency of divergence between the regions. This dynamics {{can be explained by the}} differences in the level of prices in different Russian regions. The analysis of this indicator in <b>comparable</b> <b>prices</b> showed the opposite dynamics ndash the dynamics of convergence of the regions since 1999. During this period ndash the period of rising prices ndash we see the process of budgetary funds redistribution which increases the income of the population employed in publicsector organizations. The income growth leads to convergence between the regions and to the reduced disparity. 	Scientific novelty the article analyzes the dynamics of regional differences of the Russian regions in terms of quotper capita incomesquot in current and <b>comparable</b> <b>prices</b> which allowed to assess the impact of inflation on this indicator in the period since 1991. 	Practical significance the main provisions and conclusions of the article can be used in scientific and practical activities in addressing the issues of interregional differentiation. The results of the Gini index calculations by <b>comparable</b> <b>prices</b> of 1991 are presented in a table and can be used in the analysis of interaction of macroeconomic indicators in the Russian regions and Russia as a whole...|$|R

50|$|Contrastingly, for a non-coercive {{monopoly}} to be maintained, the monopolist {{must make}} pricing and production decisions {{knowing that if}} prices are too high or quality is too low competition may arise from another firm that can better serve the market. If it is successful, it is called an efficiency monopoly, {{because it has been}} able to keep production and supply costs lower than any other possible competitor so that it can charge a lower price than others and still be profitable. Since potential competitors are not able to be so efficient at producing, they are not able to charge a lower, or <b>comparable,</b> <b>price</b> and still be profitable. Hence, competing is possible but doing so is not profitable; whereas, for a coercive monopoly, competition is neither profitable nor possible.|$|E
