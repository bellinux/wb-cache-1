50|$|A {{less common}} {{measure of the}} speed of a typist, CPM is used to {{identify}} the number of characters typed per minute.

40|$|Digital halftoning, or dithering, is the {{technique}} {{commonly used to}} render a color or grayscale image on a printer, a computer monitor or other bi-level displays. A particular halftoning technique {{that has been used}} extensively in the past is the socalled error diffusion technique. For a number of years it was believed that this technique is inherently sequential and could not be parallelized. In this paper we present and analyze a simple, yet optimal, error-diffusion parallel algorithm for digital halftoning and we discuss an implementation on a parallel machine. In particular, we describe implementations on data-parallel computers that contain linear arrays and two-dimensional meshes of processing elements. Our algorithm runs in 2 ·n+m parallel steps, a considerable improvement over the 10 ·m·n sequential algorithm. We expect that this research will lead to the development of <b>faster</b> <b>printers</b> and larger high-resolution monitors...|$|R
