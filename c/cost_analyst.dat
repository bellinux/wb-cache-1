40|$|During {{new product}} {{development}} (NPD), firms make critical design and sourcing decisions that determine the new product's cost, performance, competitive position, and profitability. The purchase {{price of materials}} and components for the new product provides {{only part of the}} picture for design and sourcing decisions. All-encompassing analyses of cost and performance, such as total cost of ownership, are extraordinarily difficult to implement because they are demanding in terms of time, data and cooperation. We study monetary quantification of points of difference, which enables an NPD team to base its decisions instead on more focused, strategically-pertinent analyses of costs and performance. We propose a substantive model of its antecedents and consequences. We then test this model with data from matched samples of 144 project leaders and 144 <b>cost</b> <b>analysts</b> who participated in the same NPD projects. Using structural equation modeling, we also test hypothesized differences in perspectives between project leaders and <b>cost</b> <b>analysts.</b> Results demonstrate the pivotal role of monetary quantification of points of difference among the sourcing alternatives being considered, especially for <b>cost</b> <b>analysts.</b> Results also demonstrate that Decision Justification to senior management drives the NPD team's decision-making process.

The four methods identified were the George Anderlohr, the DCAA, the Pinchon and Richardson, and the Cubic Curve. These methods were then analyzed using the data from two aircraft, the Grumman C- 2 A and the Bell Helicopter Textron AH- 1 W, both of which experienced breaks in production.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{development}} of a spreadsheet model that can be used by acquisition personnel to forecast the life-cycle costs of a weapon system under consideration for acquisition, helicopters for Marine Light Attack Helicopter Squadrons, which provides the basis for the model. The life-cycle costs used are limited to the cost of operating and supporting the system once it has been deployed and represent the most significant costs incurred during the system's life-cycle. In an effort to assist the Program Manager in the decision-making process, decision analysis techniques are introduced An 'add-in' simulation software package allows the assumptions upon which the cost-estimates are based to take on a more realistic stochastic nature. From the simulation trial runs, distribution frequencies are generated which enable the <b>cost</b> <b>analyst</b> to establish future cost with a higher probability of occurrence. Cost sensitivity analysis is also used to provide the Program Manager with a mechanism for establishing which assumptions have the greatest impact on costs and what happens when those assumptions are varied. The major finding of the theses is that these decision analysis techniques can significantly aid the Program Manager in the decision-making process. NANAU. S. Marine Corps (U. S. M. C.) author...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. For project <b>cost,</b> <b>analysts</b> {{can predict}} the final value with some {{confidence}} using the Independent Estimate at Completion (IEAC) formulas from Earned Value Management (EVM). 1 The formulas {{provide a means}} to understand the financial health of a project without having to reassess the cost value {{for each of the}} unfinished tasks. Earned value analysts cannot assess the health of schedule performance in the same manner. EVM does not provide IEAC-like formulas by which to predict the final duration of a project. Many who are knowledgeable of earned value express the opinion that schedule information derived from EVM is of little value. This paper discusses the problem and develops a methodology for calculating the predicted project duration using EVM data. The methodology uses the concept of Earned Schedule and introduces an additional measure required for the calculation...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the Software Development Estimating Guidebook is to provide the <b>cost</b> <b>analyst</b> with a {{resource}} manual to use in developing credible software development cost estimates. A realistic estimate is based upon a solid understanding of the software development process and the historical data that forms a framework for the expected values. An estimating methodology that follows a proven process consistent with best practices and Department of Defense (DoD) policies further contributes to estimate validity. The information is presented at two levels. One level will help the experienced analyst immediately focus on the material necessary to develop an estimate. The second level of information is for the novice, or infrequent user, to use as educational information regarding the software development and estimating processes. The estimating process starts with a determination of the {{purpose of the}} estimate. Next, the cost (or effort) and schedule for the software development project are determined using three factors: effective size, development environment, and product complexity. The key, and most important, element in the software estimate is the effective size of the software product. Determining size can be approached from several directions depending upon the software size measure (lines of code, function points, use cases, etc.) used by the development organization.

40|$|It is {{important}} to have a good cost estimate in order to budget a new project. Unfortunately, soft-ware effort estimation methods are often inaccurate. Molokken and Jorgensen report that 60 - 80 % of the time a software project will overrun its estimate by an average of 30 % [98]. Furthermore, most estimates do not describe the uncertainty of the estimate [52, 54, 118]. In addition, each source of uncertainty, as described by Kitchenham and Linkman [68], has yet to be represented. In this thesis, the design principles of an effort estimation tool called 2 CEE are discussed. This tool is currently being deployed at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and feedback regarding the methodology improvements to industry is reported. This tool represents an approach to effort estimation that provides greater interaction of the <b>cost</b> <b>analyst</b> with the estimation model. The approach places an emphasis on representing estimation uncertainty which, among other benefits, allows estimates with increasing confidence throughout the software lifecycle. Previously, Jorgenson has argued that most effort estimation is done manually [49, 52]. How-ever, manual methods have difficulty sampling the space of uncertainty [54]. This thesis describes how 11 of Jorgensen’s 12 expert judgment best practices may be automated in a model, 7 of which are demonstrated in 2 CEE. Thus, the distinction between manual and automated methods for ef...|$|E
40|$|Thank you {{for your}} {{interest}} in the Texas Christian University/Brandeis University Treatment Cost Analysis Tool (TCAT; Flynn et al., 2009). This descriptive outline is designed {{to serve as a}} reference guide for the TCAT. You may also consider using this as a paper and pencil based note sheet before entering data into the Microsoft ® Excel-based workbook. More specifically, this reference guide will assist you with entering data, making informed decisions about allocating costs, and conducting unit cost analyses to improve the administrative capacity of your program. The TCAT uses information about client volume, counseling activities, total program costs and revenues, indirect or parent facility overhead costs as well as detailed personnel data to analyze costs for outpatient drug-free substance abuse treatment programs and to conduct management planning. The TCAT is designed to conduct an analysis and management planning for one specific treatment program, although some limited information is requested regarding the program’s parent organization (if any) to get an idea about the program’s larger resource context. Sometimes costs, revenues, personnel, etc. can be “shared ” among many treatment programs within a larger parent organization, and a careful financial assessment must take this into account.
