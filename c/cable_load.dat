This electrical cable can weigh up to 10 kg per metre and is often lifted in restricted spaces in underground coal mines. Seven male subjects performed eight cable lifting and hanging tasks, while trunk kinematic data and trunk muscle electromyograms (EMGs) were obtained. The eight tasks were combinations of four postures (standing, stooping kneeling on one knee, or kneeling on both knees) and two levels of <b>cable</b> <b>load</b> (0 N or 100 N load added to the existing cable weight). An EMG-assisted model was used to calculate forces and moments acting on the lumbar spine. A two-way split-plot ANOVA showed that increased load (p< 0. 05) and changes in lifting posture (p< 0. 05) independently affected trunk muscle recruitment and spinal loading. The increase in <b>cable</b> <b>load</b> resulted in higher EMG activity of all trunk muscles and increased axial and lateral bending moments on the spine (p < 0. 05). Changes in posture caused more selective adjustments in muscle recruitment and affected the sagittal plane moment (p < 0. 05). Despite the more selective nature of trunk EMG changes due to posture, the magnitude of changes in spinal loading was often quite dramatic. However, average compression values exceeded 3400 N for all cable lifting tasks...|$|E

The loss of <b>cable</b> <b>load</b> and presence of cable breakage can be catastrophic for the entire structure. Various techniques have been applied to the non-destructive monitoring of structural health of multi-wire cable structures. However, few of them could fully characterize the early structural degradation or reliably determine the damage mechanism due to the limited access to structural components and other environmental factors. In this thesis, a guided wave-based structural health monitoring system {{that is capable of}} monitoring the <b>cable</b> <b>load</b> levels and detecting defect simultaneously is developed for multi-wire cable structures. A series of finite element analysis were conducted using Abaqus/Explicit to explore the feasibility of using ultrasonic guided waves to detect the notch in multi-wire cable structures, followed by the experimental verification on a seven wire strand. Both numerical studies and experimental works presented in this research have revealed that guided waves could be a promising technique for defect detection in multi-wire cable structures. On the other hand, finite element analyses were conducted in this study to investigate the nonlinear characteristics of ultrasonic guided waves in a multi-wire cable under different preloaded levels. The wave signals after a fast Fourier transform indicate that second harmonic peak together with the calculated nonlinear parameters decreased as the preload level increased. The corresponding wave energy was integrated to minimise the adverse influence caused by dispersion and multimodality during wave propagation. The results revealed a similar trend, which demonstrated the feasibility of ultrasonic guided waves to monitor the load level in multi-wire cable structures...|$|E

The case study is a 260 m long cable-stayed bridge spanning the Adige River 10 km north {{of the town of}} Trento, Italy.

Structural redundancy, possible relaxation losses and an as-built condition differing from design, suggest that long-termload redistribution between cables can be expected. To monitor load redistribution, the owner decided to install a monitoring system which combines built-on-site elasto-magnetic and fiber-optic sensors. In this note, we discuss a rational way to improve the accuracy of the load estimate from the EM sensors taking advantage of the FOS information.

40|$|Abstract—Very low {{frequency}} (VLF) high voltage technique {{has been used}} to some extent in the past for the field test of XLPE power cables. Equipment available has used 0. 1 Hz voltage hav-ing a variety of waveforms such as square waves, triangular waves, etc. This paper describes a novel laboratory test system conducted with the objective to develop an exponential wave ge-nerator as the complement of existing VLF test waveforms. The generator consists of a high voltage (HV) 50 Hz AC source, a HV semiconductor switch unit based on the series-connected IGBTs, and shape-control resistors. The proposed HV switch can block 20 kV rated voltage and has the current capacity of 40 A. Finally, the new designed approach permits the <b>cable</b> <b>load</b> of up to 1 μF to be tested at a withstand voltage level of 20 kV. Preliminary expe-riments are performed in the laboratory using the proposed ge-nerator and the output waveforms are presented.

40|$|Demand Side Management (DSM) is {{a popular}} {{approach}} for grid-aware peak-shaving. The most commonly used DSM methods either have no look ahead feature and risk deploying flexibility too early, or they plan ahead using predictions, which are in general not very reliable. To counter this, a DSM approach is presented that does not rely on detailed power predictions, but only uses a few easy to predict characteristics. By using these characteristics alone, near optimal results can be achieved for electric vehicle (EV) charging, and a bound on the maximal relative deviation is given. This result is extended to an algorithm that controls a group of EVs such that a transformer peak is avoided, while simultaneously keeping the individual house profiles as flat as possible to avoid cable overloading and for improved power quality. This approach is evaluated using different data sets to compare the results with the state-of-the-art research. The evaluation shows that the presented approach is capable of peak-shaving at the transformer level, while keeping the voltages well within legal bounds, keeping the <b>cable</b> <b>load</b> low and obtaining low losses.
