The objective {{of this study is to}} physically and chemically characterize the Pb-rich particles emitted at different workplaces in a lead recycling plant. A multi-scale characterization was conducted from bulk analysis to the level of individual particles, to assess the particles properties in relation with Pb speciation and availability. Process PM from various origins were sampled and then compared; namely Furnace and Refining PM respectively present in the smelter and at refinery workplaces, Emissions PM present in <b>channeled</b> <b>emissions.</b> These particles first differed by their morphology and size distribution, with finer particles found in emissions. Differences observed in chemical composition could be explained by the industrial processes. All PM contained the same major phases (Pb, PbS, PbO, PbSO 4 and PbO*PbSO 4) but differed on the nature and amount of minor phases. Due to high content in PM, Pb concentrations in the CaCl 2 extractant reached relatively high values (40 mg L− 1). However, the ratios (soluble/total) of CaCl 2 exchangeable Pb were relatively low (< 0. 02 %) in comparison with Cd (up to 18 %).

40|$|The {{emission}} of neutral cluster fragments during collisions of large water clusters with graphite surfaces {{has been investigated}} using molecular beam techniques. Water clusters with an average size of up to 1. 4 · 104 molecules per cluster collide with the surface with a velocity of 1380 ms– 1. Angular distributions for emitted large fragments are shifted towards the tangential direction and become increasingly narrow with increasing fragment size. The kinetic energy in the surface normal direction is efficiently transferred to internal degrees of freedom and to surface modes, while the momentum parallel to the surface plane is less affected by the surface interaction.

The optical transducers were produced by PECVD and tested {{for a proper}} fine tuning of the cyan and yellow fluorescent proteins emission. The active device consists of a p-i'(a-SiC:H) -n/p-i(a-Si:H) -n heterostructures sandwiched between two transparent contacts.

Cyan and yellow fluorescent input channels were transmitted together, each one with a specific transmission rate and different intensities. The multiplexed optical signal was analyzed by reading out, under positive and negative applied voltages, the generated photocurrents.

Furthermore, the number of IPTV service providers is rapidly increasing over internets. Therefore such information overload requires large amounts of efforts for users to search and navigate the program contents that they like to watch.

The remote technique uses spectral channels of the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) instrument on board the NOAA polar orbiting satellites.
