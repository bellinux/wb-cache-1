It <b>complements</b> <b>them</b> by defining new task scheduling and computational resource sharing strategies based on genetic algorithms for virtualized IVR application. Moreover, it proposes new task assignment that guarantees maximum utilization of resources while minimizing the execution time of tasks for virtualized IVR applications. We also propose a resource allocation strategy that minimizes substrate resource utilization and the resource allocation time.|$|R

30|$|Using an SNS-based RE {{approach}} in real-world settings could increase end user involvement in RE and support projects {{with a list}} of end user needs. This should be seen as an initial vision and not as an exhaustive list of validated requirements. As expected, the approach did not provide well-defined requirements but rather end user needs which could then be turned into requirements. The output obtained with our approach does not in any way exclude the usage of other existing elicitation and prioritization methods but rather <b>complements</b> <b>them.</b>|$|R
40|$|In many {{distributed}} applications, {{pairs of}} predicates and data {{have to be}} evaluated locally.

Though not as e#cient as value-based partitioning approaches, the Bit Zipper's generality <b>complements</b> <b>them.</b> Where flooding to N nodes {{used to be the}} fall-back, the Bit Zipper is a replacement needing only O(# N). Finally, for the all-pairs variant of these problems, we will show the optimality of our approach...|$|R
