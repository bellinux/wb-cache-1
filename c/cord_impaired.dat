40|$|Background: Asphyxia is {{a medical}} {{condition}} in which placental or pulmonary gas exchange is impaired or they cease all together, typically producing a combination of progressive hypoxemia and hypercapnea. Objective: In addition to regional differences in its etiology; {{it is important to}} know its risk factors. Materials and Methods: This is a case-control study, all neonates born from May 2002 to September 2005 in Vali-e-Asr Hospital were studied. 9488 newborns were born of which 6091 of the live patients were hospitalized in NICU. 546 newborns were studied as case and control group. 260 neonates (48 %) were female and 286 neonates (52 %) were male. Among the neonates who were admitted, 182 of them were diagnosed with asphyxia and twice of them (364 newborns) were selected as a control group. The variables consist of; gestational age, type of delivery, birth weight, prenatal care, pregnancy and peripartum complications and neonatal disorders. Results: Our studies showed that 35 (19. 2 %) patients had mild asphyxia, 107 (58. 8 %) had moderate asphyxia and 40 (22 %) were diagnosed as severe asphyxia. Mean maternal age was 34. 23 ± 4. 29 yr; (range: 23 - 38 yr); and mean of parity was 2 ± 1. 2; (range: 1 - 8). Risk factors in our study included emergent Caesarian Section, preterm labor (< 37 w), low birth weight (< 2500 g), 5 minute Apgar (less than 6), need for resuscitation, nuchal <b>cord,</b> <b>impaired</b> Biophysical Profile, neonatal anemia, and maternal infertility. Conclusion: All risk factors listed above play a role in asphyxia. The majority of these factors are avoidable by means of good perinatal car...|$|E
40|$|Objective To predict {{functioning}} after 3 {{years in}} patients with recently diagnosed multiple sclerosis (MS). Design Inception cohort with 3 years of follow-up. At baseline, predictors were obtained from medical history taking, neurologic examination, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Setting Neurology outpatient clinic. Participants Patients with MS (N= 156); 146 with complete follow-up. Interventions Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures Inability to walk at least 500 m, impaired dexterity, cognitive impairments, incontinence, inability {{to drive a car}} or use public transportation, social dysfunction, and reliance on a disability pension. Results Clinical prediction rules were constructed for the models that were well calibrated (sufficient agreement between predicted and observed outcomes, based on visual inspection of calibration curves) and that showed sufficient discrimination (area under the receiver operation characteristic curve >. 70) after internal bootstrap validation. The models for the inability to walk at least 500 m, impaired dexterity, and cognitive impairments were well calibrated. Discrimination was sufficient for all 7 models, except the one predicting social dysfunction (. 67). The inability to walk at least 500 m was predicted by the perceived ability to walk, impairment of the cerebellar tract, and the number of MRI lesions in the spinal <b>cord.</b> <b>Impaired</b> dexterity was predicted by the perceived ability to use the hands, impairments of the pyramidal, cerebellar, and sensory tracts, and the T 2 -weighted infratentorial lesion load. Cognitive impairment was predicted by age, gender, the perceived ability to concentrate, and the T 2 -weighted supratentorial lesion load. Conclusions Inability to walk at least 500 m, impaired dexterity, and cognitive impairments can be predicted with predictors that are derived from medical history taking, neurologic examination, and MRI shortly after a definite diagnosis of MS has been made. ...|$|E
5|$|Although {{spinal cord}} injury (SCI) often causes sexual dysfunction, many people with SCI are able to have {{satisfying}} sex lives. Physical limitations acquired from SCI affect sexual function and sexuality in broader areas, {{which in turn has}} important effects on quality of life. Damage to the spinal <b>cord</b> <b>impairs</b> its ability to transmit messages between the brain and parts of the body below the level of the lesion. This results in lost or reduced sensation and muscle motion, and affects orgasm, erection, ejaculation, and vaginal lubrication. More indirect causes of sexual dysfunction include pain, weakness, and side effects of medications. Psycho-social causes include depression and altered self-image. Many people with SCI have satisfying sex lives, and many experience sexual arousal and orgasm. People with SCI employ a variety of adaptations to help carry on their sex lives healthily, by focusing on different areas of the body and types of sexual acts. Neural plasticity may account for increases in sensitivity in parts of the body that have not lost sensation, so people often find newly sensitive erotic areas of the skin in erogenous zones or near borders between areas of preserved and lost sensation.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to analyze the {{effectiveness}} of surgery and follow-up of children operated on for burn sequelae. For many years, we have organized two missions per year to Benin and Togo, one for surgery and one for follow-up. We analyzed the files of children born in Africa and victims of burns from the years 2002 to 2011. Children were referred through a non-governmental organization (NGO) and assessed in Africa by local paediatricians before and after surgery. Treatment consisted in operating on burn sequelae such as contractures, hypertrophic scars and hard <b>cords.</b> <b>Impaired</b> mobility was our only indication for the operation. We kept a database on all patients. Sixty files were reviewed, of which fifty were deemed suitable for analysis. The most common methods of surgery were skin grafting and Z-plasty. There were no complications, such as infection or graft/flap necrosis after immediate surgery. Long-term follow-up revealed a recurrence of hypertrophic scarring (47 %), retractions (24 %) and hard cords (2 %) due to a lack of occupational therapy and physiotherapy treatment. Partnership with an NGO and a local team allows us to treat children with burn injury sequelae in Western Africa. A continued and often long-lasting follow-up by occupational therapists and physiotherapists is highly mandatory in order to guarantee good long-term results.

50|$|Another {{hypothesis}} is that copper deficiency myelopathy is caused by disruptions in the methylation cycle. The methylation cycle causes a transfer of a methyl group (-CH3) from methyltetrahydrofolate {{to a range of}} macromolecules by the suspected copper dependent enzyme methionine synthase. This cycle is able to produce purines, which are a component of DNA nucleotide bases, and also myelin proteins. The spinal cord is surrounded by a layer of protective protein coating called myelin (see figure). When this methionine synthase enzyme is disrupted, the methylation decreases and myelination of the spinal <b>cord</b> is <b>impaired.</b> This cycle ultimately causes myelopathy.|$|R

40|$|Despite concerted efforts from pharmacologic {{research}} into neuropathic pain, many patients fail to achieve sufficient pain relief with medication alone. For this reason, increasing interest centres on neurostimulation techniques. We assessed whether transcutaneous spinal direct current stimulation (tsDCS) modulates conduction in ascending nociceptive spinal pathways. We measured changes induced by anodal and cathodal tsDCS over the thoracic spinal cord on face- and foot-laser evoked potentials (LEPs) and foot-cold pressor test responses in 20 healthy subjects. Whereas anodal tsDCS reduced the amplitude of the N 1 and N 2 components of foot-LEPs (P< 0. 05) neither anodal nor cathodal tsDCS changed LEPs evoked by face stimulation. Pain tolerance {{to the cold}} pressor test was significantly higher after anodal than after cathodal tsDCS (P< 0. 05). Conversely, no difference {{was found in the}} pain threshold or pain ratings to the cold pressor test between the two polarity conditions. Our data suggest that anodal tsDCS over the thoracic spinal <b>cord</b> might <b>impair</b> conduction in the ascending nociceptive spinal pathways, thus modulating LEPs and increasing pain tolerance in healthy subjects...|$|R

40|$|Itch, {{also known}} as pruritus, is a common, {{intractable}} symptom of several skin diseases, such as atopic dermatitis and xerosis. TLRs mediate innate immunity and regulate neuropathic pain, but their roles in pruritus are elusive. Here, we report that scratching behaviors induced by histamine-dependent and -independent pruritogens are markedly reduced in mice lacking the Tlr 3 gene. TLR 3 is expressed mainly by small-sized primary sensory neurons in dorsal root ganglions (DRGs) that coexpress the itch signaling pathway components transient receptor potential subtype V 1 and gastrin-releasing peptide. Notably, we found that treatment with a TLR 3 agonist induces inward currents and action potentials in DRG neurons and elicited scratching in WT mice but not Tlr 3 –/– mice. Furthermore, excitatory synaptic transmission in spinal cord slices and long-term potentiation in the intact spinal <b>cord</b> were <b>impaired</b> in Tlr 3 –/– mice but not Tlr 7 –/– mice. Consequently, central sensitization–driven pain hypersensitivity, but not acute pain, was impaired in Tlr 3 –/– mice. In addition, TLR 3 knockdown in DRGs also attenuated pruritus in WT mice. Finally, chronic itch in a dry skin condition was substantially reduced in Tlr 3 –/– mice. Our findings demonstrate a critical role of TLR 3 in regulating sensory neuronal excitability, spinal cord synaptic transmission, and central sensitization. TLR 3 {{may serve as a}} new target for developing anti-itch treatment...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Traumatic {{spinal cord}} injury can be {{considered}} a major public health problem in Brazil. It's an injury to the spinal cord that leads to decreased or absent sensitivity and muscle strength, besides neurovegetative disorders of body segments located below the lesion. Method.

We can observe a low quality of life of individuals that suffered {{spinal cord injury}}, due to pain and secondary complications. The clarity of information and a rehabilitation program assists in adaptation, improves life quality and assists the patient in returning to his family and social life. Conclusion.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{a patient with}} leucocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD).

In vitro incubation of neutrophils with recombinant human interferon-gamma (rIFN-gamma) showed an increase in oxygen consumption, but {{no effect on the}} expression of the LeuCAMs, or the beta chain mRNA. In vivo treatment with IFN-gamma was started. The Fc gamma RI receptor appeared on the neutrophils, the LeuCAMs remained undetectable, while the neutrophil functions remained disturbed.

40|$|Background: Spinal <b>cord</b> injury {{severely}} <b>impairs</b> fertility {{of young}} men. It can induce erectile dysfunction, ejaculatory dysfunction, and semen abnormalities. However, the precise mechanism is unclear. Objective: We observed {{the effects of}} sacral nerve electrostimulation on sex dysfunction of male rats with spinal cord injury. Methods: Thirty-six male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into three groups (n = 12) : sham operated group, spinal cord injury model group, and electrostimulation group. The weight of genitals, related sex hormone index, and sperm motility were examined in each group after operation at two, four, and six weeks, respectively. Results: Sacral nerve electrostimulation could improve testis and epididymis weight, regulate hormone secretion (including an increase in GnRH, tT, and ABP, but decrease in FSH and LH), and cause an increase in sperm count and motility. Conclusion: Sacral nerve electrostimulation may be effective in treating sex dysfunction resulting from spinal cord injury...|$|R
40|$|Tetanus and botulinum {{neurotoxins}} are {{the most}} potent toxins known as few nanograms are sufficient to kill most mammals.

40|$|Investigations of {{polymorphonuclear}} leukocyte (PMN) function {{were performed}} in a 5 -yr-old white female with delayed umbilical <b>cord</b> separation, <b>impaired</b> pus formation, and a severe defect of PMN chemotaxis. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis demonstrated an almost total deficiency of a high molecular weight glycoprotein(s) (GP 138) in the granule and membrane fractions of the patient's cells, and NaB 3 H 4 -galactose oxidase labeling demonstrated {{the absence of a}} major glycoprotein complex on the surface of her PMNs. Monoclonal antibodies (MAb) were employed in flow cytometry experiments to demonstrate that two previously characterized glycoproteins (Mo 1 and LFA 1) were undetectable {{on the surface of the}} patient's PMNs and monocytes. Immunoprecipitation of 125 I-labeled patient cells with subunit specific MAbs confirmed that the alpha-subunits of Mo 1 (155 kD) and LFA 1 (177 kD) and their common beta-subunit (94 kD) were totally deficient. Functional analyses of patient PMNs demonstrated severe impairment of adherence- and adhesion-dependent cell functions including spreading, aggregation, orientation in chemotactic gradients, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, and phagocytosis of particles (Oil-Red- 0 -paraffin, zymosan) selectively opsonized with C 3 -derived ligands. Patient PMNs demonstrated a normal capacity to rosette with IgG or C 3 b-coated sheep erythrocytes, but rosette formation with C 3 bi-coated erythrocytes was profoundly diminished. Adhesion-independent functions including shape change, N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl- 3 H-phenylalanine binding, and O- 2 generation or secretion elicited by soluble stimuli were normal. Membrane fluidity, surface charge, and microtubule assembly were also normal.

40|$|Tenascin-C (TNC), a major {{component}} of the extracellular matrix, is strongly upregulated after injuries of the central nervous system (CNS) but its role in tissue repair is not understood. Both regeneration promoting and inhibiting roles of TNC have been proposed considering its abilities to both support and restrict neurite outgrowth in vitro. Here, we show that spontaneous recovery of locomotor functions after spinal <b>cord</b> injury is <b>impaired</b> in adult TNC-deficient (TNC–/–) mice in comparison to wild-type (TNC+/+) mice. The impaired recovery was associated with attenuated excitability of the plantar Hoffmann reflex (H-reflex), reduced glutamatergic input, reduced sprouting of monaminergic axons in the lumbar spinal cord and enhanced post-traumatic degeneration of corticospinal axons. The degeneration of corticospinal axons in TNC–/– mice was normalized to TNC+/+ levels by application of the alternatively spliced TNC fibronectin type III homologous domain D (fnD). Finally, overexpression of TNC-fnD via adeno-associated virus in wild-type mice improved locomotor recovery, increased monaminergic axons sprouting, and reduced lesion scar volume after spinal cord injury. The functional efficacy of the viral-mediated TNC indicates a potentially useful approach for treatment of spinal cord injury...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} {{longitudinal}} association between respiratory muscle strength and cough capacity in persons with recent spinal cord injury. Design: Longitudinal analyses. Subjects: Forty persons with recent spinal <b>cord</b> injury and <b>impaired</b> pulmonary function. Methods: Measurements were performed 4 {{weeks after the}} start of rehabilitation, 9 and 17 weeks after the first measurement, and one year after discharge from inpatient rehabilitation. Peak cough flow was measured with a spirometer. Maximum inspiratory and expiratory pressures (MIP and MEP), expressed in cmH(2) O, were measured at the mouth. Results: Both MIP and MEP were significantly positively associated with peak cough flow. After correction for confounders and time 10 cmH(2) O higher MIP was associated with a 0. 32 Us higher peak cough flow, and a 10 cmH(2) O higher MEP was associated with a 0. 15 l/s higher peak cough flow. The association between MIP and peak cough flow was mainly based on within-subject variance. The association between MIP and peak cough flow was stronger than between MEP and peak cough flow.

40|$|Nurr 1, a {{transcription}} factor {{belonging to the}} family of nuclear receptors, is expressed at high levels immediately after birth. Gene-targeted mice lacking Nurr 1 fail to develop midbrain dopaminergic neurones and do not survive beyond 24 h after birth. Dopamine (DA) levels may be regulated by Nurr 1, and as DA is involved in both central and peripheral respiratory control, we hypothesized that lack of Nurr 1 may impair breathing and cause death by respiratory failure. We demonstrate herein that Nurr 1 newborn knockout mice have a severely disturbed breathing pattern characterized by hypoventilation, numerous apnoeas and failure to increase breathing when challenged with hypoxia. In heterozygote Nurr 1 mice the response to hypoxia is also altered. Furthermore, the central respiratory rhythm, generated from isolated brainstem–spinal <b>cord</b> preparations, exhibits <b>impaired</b> response to hypoxia in mice lacking Nurr 1. Moreover, Nurr 1 is expressed in several respiratory-related regions of the nervous system, including the nucleus of the solitary tract, the nucleus ambiguus and the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve, and in the carotid bodies. The prominent Nurr 1 expression in these areas, involved in respiratory control, along with the severe respiratory phenotype, indicates that Nurr 1 {{plays a major role in}} the extrauterine adaption of respiratory control and the response to hypoxia...|$|R
40|$|Neuroadapted Sindbis virus (NSV) is a {{neurotropic}} virus {{capable of}} inducing {{the death of}} spinal motor neurons in mice and rats. In this study we investigated the mechanisms that underlie NSV-induced motor neuron death. We found that many degenerating spinal motor neurons were not infected directly with NSV, suggesting that bystander cell death occurs. An excitotoxic mechanism was confirmed when blockade of calcium-permeable AMPA receptors attenuated motor neuron death both in vitro and in vivo. Blockade of astroglial glutamate reuptake potentiated NSV-induced motor neuron loss in vivo, suggesting that astrocyte-mediated removal of perisynaptic glutamate is important in limiting NSV-induced excitotoxic injury. Astroglial glutamate transport was reduced markedly in the spinal cord during NSV infection, in advance of motor neuron injury in susceptible mice. In contrast, we found 5. 6 -fold elevated glutamate uptake in the spinal cords of mice resistant to NSV-induced paralysis. Likewise, minocycline markedly increased spinal cord glutamate transport and protected mice from NSV-induced motor neuron death. These studies suggest that NSV infection triggers a cascade {{of events in the}} spinal <b>cord</b> resulting in <b>impaired</b> astrocytic glutamate transport and excitotoxic injury of motor neurons mediated via calciumpermeable AMPA receptors.

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{traumatic}} {{spinal cord injury}} on structural integrity, cortical reorganization and ensuing disability is variable and may depend on a dynamic interaction between the severity of local damage and {{the capacity of the}} brain for plastic reorganization. We investigated trauma-induced anatomical changes in the spinal cord and brain, and explored their relationship to functional changes in sensorimotor cortex. Structural changes were assessed using cross-sectional cord area, voxel-based morphometry and voxel-based cortical thickness of T 1 -weighted images in 10 subjects with cervical spinal cord injury and 16 controls. Cortical activation in response to right-sided (i) handgrip; and (ii) median and tibial nerve stimulation were assessed using functional magnetic resonance imaging.

40|$|Membrane {{peptides}} {{appear as}} an emerging class of regulatory molecules in bacteria, which can interact with membrane proteins, such as sensor kinases. To date, regulatory membrane peptides {{have been completely}} overlooked in mycobacteria. The 30 amino-acid-long KdpF peptide, which is co-transcribed with kdpABC genes and regulated by the KdpDE two-component system, is supposed to stabilize the KdpABC potassium transporter complex but may also exhibit unsuspected regulatory function(s) towards the KdpD sensor kinase. Herein, we showed by quantitative RT-PCR that the Mycobacterium bovis BCG kdpAB and kdpDE genes clusters are differentially induced in potassium-deprived broth medium or within infected macrophages. We have overexpressed the kdpF gene in M. bovis BCG to investigate its possible regulatory role and effect on mycobacterial virulence. Our results indicate that KdpF does not play a critical regulatory role on kdp genes expression {{despite the fact that}} KdpF interacts with the KdpD sensor kinase in a bacterial two-hybrid assay. However, overexpression of kdpF results in a significant reduction of M. bovis BCG growth in both murine and human primary macrophages, and is associated with a strong alteration of colonial morphology and <b>impaired</b> <b>cording</b> formation. To identify novel KdpF interactants, a mycobacterial library was screened using KdpF as bait in the bacterial two-hybrid system.

40|$|The {{principles}} of open versus laser microsurgical approaches for partial resections {{of the larynx}} are described, oncologic as well as functional results discussed and corresponding outcomes following primary radiotherapy are opposed. Over the last decade, the endoscopic partial resection of the larynx has developed to an accepted approach {{in the treatment of}} early glottic and supraglottic carcinomas thus leading to a remarkable decline in the use of open surgery. Comparing the various surgical approaches of laryngeal partial resections, the oncological outcome of the patients, as far as survival and organ preservation are concerned, are comparable, whereas functional results of the endoscopic procedures are superior with less morbidity. The surgical procedures put together, are all superior to radiotherapy concerning organ preservation. Transoral laser microsurgery has been used successfully for vocal <b>cord</b> carcinomas with <b>impaired</b> mobility or fixation of the vocal cord, supraglottic carcinomas with infiltration of the pre- and/or paraglottic space as well as for selected hypopharyngeal carcinomas. It has been well documented that laser microsurgery achieves good oncological as well as functional results with reasonable morbidity. However, patients with those tumours have been successfully treated by open partial resections of the larynx at medical centres with appropriate expertise. The initially enthusiastic assessment of study results concerning the efficacy of various protocols of chemoradiation with the intent of organ preservation for laryngeal and hypopharyngeal carcinomas are judged more cautious, today, due to recent reports of rather high rates of late toxicity complications...|$|R
40|$|Many people {{affected}} by debilitating neuromuscular {{disorders such as}} amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), brainstem stroke, or spinal <b>cord</b> injury, are <b>impaired</b> in their ability to, or even unable to, communicate. A Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) uses brain signals, rather than muscles, to re-establish communication with the outside world. One particular BCI approach is the so-called “P 300 matrix speller ” that was first described by Farwell and Donchin in 1988. It has been widely assumed that this method {{does not depend on}} the ability to focus on the desired character, because it was thought that it relies primarily on the P 300 evoked potential and minimally if at all on other EEG features such as the visual evoked potential (VEP). This issue is highly relevant for clinical application of this BCI method, because eye movements may be impaired or lost in the relevant user population. This study investigated to what extent performance in a “P 300 ” speller BCI depends on eye gaze. We evaluated the performance of 17 healthy subjects using a “P 300 ” matrix speller during two conditions. In one condition (“letter”), the subjects focused their eye gaze on the intended letter, while in the second condition (“center”), subjects focused eye gaze on a fixation cross that was located {{in the center of the}} matrix. The results show that the performance of the “P 300 ” matrix speller in normal subjects depends in considerable measure on gaze direction. They thereby disprove a widespread assumption in BCI research, and suggest that this BCI might function more effectively for people who retain some eye-movement control. The applicability of these findings to people with severe neuromuscular disabilities (particularly in eye-movements) remains to be determined. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{criteria}} for T 2 glottic cancer staging in the UICC classification are extension to the supra- or subglottic region combined or not with impaired mobility of the vocal cord. The prognostic {{significance of these}} factors is examined in this study. Patients with T 2 A lesions (normal mobility, 33 patients) have an uncorrected actuarial 5 year survival of 54 %, and a local control rate with radiotherapy alone of 62 %. Patients with T 2 B lesions (impaired mobility, 28 patients) have a survival of 40 % and a local control rate of 65 % with radiation only. After rescue surgery, local control is obtained in 81 % of T 2 A patients and 68 % of T 2 B patients. While local control rates with radiotherapy alone were the same in T 2 A and T 2 B patients, final survival was lower for T 2 B patients because of less successful salvage surgery. While {{no significant differences in}} local control were found for different mucosal spread patterns, local control was excellent (87 %) with radiotherapy alone in eight patients with mobility impairment without extension beyond the true <b>cord,</b> indicating that <b>impaired</b> mobility by itself is not a bad prognostic factor, but only when it is combined with tumor extension. In 9 patients with T 2 B tumors, a laryngectomy was performed immediately after initial radiotherapy (40 or 50 Gy) when the tumor persisted or the vocal cord mobility did not return to normal. None of these patients had a local recurrence after surgery. The total local control in all 37 T 2 B patients together was 78 % (compared with 81 % in T 2 A patients). The adverse prognostic influence of impaired mobility seems to have been eliminated by the treatment policy of surgery for those patients with poor regressions after radiotherapy.

Only {{cases in which the}} surgeon ruled out the possibility of operative damage to the laryngeal nerves were included. All patients underwent pre- and postoperative clinical and instrumental nose and throat examination (NTE). Preoperatively, 86 patients (41 %) showed hoarseness or dysphagia: 4 (2 %) monoplegia and 12 (6 %) hypomobility of the vocal <b>cords</b> due to <b>impaired</b> function of the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN); 6 (3 %) cord hypotonia due to impairment of the superior laryngeal nerve (SLN); 34 (16 %) dysphagia: and 30 (14 %) hoarseness due to other causes. At follow-up 1 month after surgery, 71 patients (34 %) had an onset of previously absent signs and symptoms: 8 (4 %) had palsy of one vocal cord (2 % permanent); 6 (3 %) had cord hypomobility (all temporary); 12 (6 %) had cord hypotonia due to disease of the SLN, 4 of which (2 %) were permanent; 44 patients (21 %) had symptoms due to scarring and adhesions between the laryngotracheal axis and the prethyroid muscles and between these and the skin. One patient (0. 5 %) had a nodular cord lesion that occurred after 3 months. Overall, {{more than one-third of the}} patients had preoperative voice modifications or swallowing impairment, around one-third had these problems after TT, and less than one-third were free of pre- and postoperative complications. The surgeon's care to avoid damage to the anatomica integrity of the of laryngeal nerves does not exclude functional problems of the nerves and of laryngeal dynamics. In fact, such problems could be referred to outcomes linked to the operation itself (hematoma, edema, scarring adhesion) or to events that only temporarily follow surgery but must be considered as an unavoidable sequel (e. g., neuritis, viral neuritis, myopathy). The patient should undergo a careful clinical and instrumental NTE to detect conditions prior to surgery, and the information provided by the surgeons should be thorough to allow the patient to be aware of all possible sequels and consequences...|$|R

II. The case of T 2 N 0 disease Paolo Frata, Enrico Cellai, Stefano M. Magrini, Bartolomea Bonetti, Elisabetta Vitali, Sandro Tonoli, Michela Buglione, Fabiola Paiar, Raffaella Barca, Simona Fondelli, Caterina Polli, Lorenzo Livi, Gianpaolo Biti, Purpose: To retrospectively evaluate local control rates, late damage incidence, functional results, and second-tumor occurrence according to the different patient, tumor, and treatment features in a large bi-institutional series of T 2 glottic cancer. Methods and Materials: A total of 256 T 2 glottic cancer cases treated consecutively with radical intent at the Florence University Radiation Oncology Department (FLO) and at the Radiation Oncology Department of the University of Brescia, Istituto del Radio “O. Alberti” (BS) were studied. Cumulative probability of local control (LC), disease-specific survival (DSS), and overall survival (OS) rates were calculated and compared in the different clinical and therapeutic subgroups by both univariate and multivariate analysis. Types of relapse and their surgical salvage were evaluated, along with the functional results of treatment. Late-damage incidence and second-tumor cumulative probability (STP) were also calculated. Results: In the entire series, 3 -year, 5 -year, and 10 -year OS rates were, respectively, 73 %, 59 %, and 37 %. Corresponding values for cumulative LC probability were 73 %, 73 %, and 70 % and for DSS, 89 %, 86 %, and 85 %, taking into account surgical salvage of relapsed cases. Seventy-three percent of the patients were cured with function preserved. Main determinants of a worse LC at univariate analysis were larger tumor extent and <b>impaired</b> <b>cord</b> mobility. At multivariate analysis, the same factors retained statistical significance. Twenty-year STP was 23 %, with second-tumor deaths less frequent than larynx cancer deaths (20 of 256 vs. 30 of 256). Incidence of late damage was higher {{in the first decade of}} accrual (22 %) than in the last decade (10 %, p = 0. 03); the same was true for severe late damage (9 % vs. 1. 8 %). Conclusion: Present-day radical radiotherapy can be considered a standard treatment for T 2 glottic cancer. Better results are obtained in patients with less extended disease. Late damage is relatively infrequent, but a careful follow-up is warranted for early detection not only of relapses (because salvage surgery is feasible) but also of second malignant tumors, which constitute a relevant but not the leading cause of death in these patients and are potentially curable...|$|R
40|$|In {{the early}} {{development}} of brain, {{there is an}} important period called the synaptogenesis period (also known as the brain growth-spurt period) which occurs in different mammalian species at different times relative to birth. In rodents, it begins a day or two before birth and ends 2 weeks after birth, whereas in humans it starts {{at the beginning of the}} third trimester and ends several years after birth. This is a critical period during neural development as neurons are establishing communications with their environment and other neurons to ensure that they develop and function appropriately; disruption at this stage by toxic agents including anaesthetic agents may compromise the normal neuronal development of the central nervous system. During the course of my PhD study, I found that inhalational agents isoflurane (ISO) alone or in combination with nitrous oxide (N 2 O) caused a wide spread neurodegeneration in the brain including the cingulated cortex, hippocampus, substantia nigra and basal forebrain in postnatal day 7 Sprague-Dawley rat pups. In those brain regions, the cells involved included glutamatergic, GABAergic and dopaminergic neurons. However, the cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain were spared from anaesthesia-induced neuroapoptosis. My studies also showed that the neurodegeneration was not only confined to the higher centres, but was also observed in the spinal cord. These data indicated that the anaesthetics studied acted at molecular level and induced neuronal apoptosis by activating the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. It has been well documented that preconditioning with hypoxia or other interventions including pharmacological agents can protect against subsequent brain injury induced by hypoxia/ischemia. However, my data showed that hypoxic preconditioning exacerbated N 2 O+ISO-induced neonatal neurodegeneration, while xenon preconditioning protected against anaesthetics-induced neuroapoptosis and subsequent neurocognitve impairment. Most studies in this field including my own study described above are more relevant to the clinical situation where neonates are managed in the critical care unit, i. e. in the absence of surgery. For this reason, I implemented another experimental setting to mimic the clinical situation in the operating room where neonates receiving anaesthetic drugs are also subjected to nociceptive surgical stimuli. Therefore, in another experiment, rat pups in addition to receiving anaesthetic drugs were also subjected to standardised nociceptive stimuli. The results suggested that nociceptive stimuli enhanced neuronal apoptosis induced by anaesthetic drugs in the brain and the spinal <b>cord</b> and consequently <b>impaired</b> neurological function. Were the data reported in my thesis to be extrapolated to the clinical setting, it would have very important implications for the clinical management of paediatric population receiving general anaesthesia.

40|$|To {{investigation}} of the outcomes of indirect posterior decompression with corrective fusion for myelopathy associated with thoracic ossification of the longitudinal ligament, and prognostic factors. Conservative treatment for myelopathy associated with thoracic ossification of the longitudinal ligament (OPLL) is mostly ineffective, and treatment is necessary. However, many authors have reported poor surgical outcomes, and no standard surgical procedure has been established. We have been performing indirect spinal cord decompression by posterior laminectomy and simultaneous corrective fusion of the thoracic kyphosis. Twenty patients underwent indirect posterior decompression with corrective fusion, and were included in this study. The follow-up period was minimum 2  years and averaged 2  years and 9  months (2 – 5  years 6  months). Operative results were examined using JOA scoring system (full marks: 11 points) and Hirabayashi’s recovery rate, as excellent (100 – 75 %), good (74 – 50 %), fair (49 – 25 %), unchanged (24 – 0 %) and deteriorated (i. e., decrease in score less than 0 %). Cases in which the spinal cord is floating from OPLL on intraoperative ultrasonography were defined as the floating (+) group, and those without floating as the floating (−) group. In addition, we used compound muscle action potentials (CMAP) as intraoperative spinal cord monitoring and the cases were divided into three groups: Group A, no change in potential; Group B, potential decreased, and Group C, potential improved. The mean pre- and postoperative JOA scores were 6. 2 and 8. 9 points, respectively, and the recovery rate was 56 %. The outcome was rated excellent in three, good in eight, fair in six, unchanged in two, and deteriorated in one. The mean preoperative thoracic kyphosis measured 58 °, and was corrected to 51 ° after surgery. On intraoperative ultrasonography, 12 cases {{were included in the}} floating (+) and 8 in the floating (−) groups; the recovery rates were 58 and 52 %, respectively, showing {{no significant difference between the}} recovery rates of the two groups. Regarding intraoperative CMAP, the outcome was excellent in one, good in seven, fair in four, and unchanged in one in Group A; fair in one, unchanged in one, and deteriorated in one in Group B, and excellent in two and good in one in Group C. The recovery rates were 50, 48 and 68. 3 % in Groups A, B and C, respectively, showing that the postoperative outcome was significantly poorer in Group B. Although indirect posterior decompression with corrective fusion using instruments obtained satisfactory outcomes, not all cases achieved good outcomes using this procedure. We consider that additional application of anterior decompressive fusion is preferable when improvement of symptoms occurs not satisfactory after indirect posterior decompression with corrective fusion using instruments. Intraoperative spinal cord monitoring of CMAP demonstrated that the spinal <b>cord</b> was already <b>impaired</b> during the laminectomy via the posterior approach. Concomitant intraoperative monitoring of CMAP to avoid impairment of the vulnerable spinal cord and corrective posterior spinal fusion with indirect spinal cord decompression is recommendable as a method capable of preventing postoperative neurological aggravation...|$|R
