40|$|This paper revisits {{an episode}} {{in the history of}} the {{auditing}} profession in France: the period that saw the 'professionalisation' of auditing in the late 1960 s, almost 100 years after enactment of the law that had officially created the activity. Despite the existence of practitioners with a reputation for competency and despite the more stringent conditions imposed on the recruitment of these practitioners during the 1930 s, <b>certification</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounts</b> had remained a 'function' rather than a profession. The reform of France's commercial code in 1966 thus gave auditors a second chance, making them a key component in an ambitious plan to modernise French financial markets. The paper considers this reform from the angle of the problem facing the reformers, that of 'professionalising the profession' of auditor. Two aspects of the problems are discussed. The first concerns the need to take into consideration the existence of another profession, the profession of the French chartered accountant (expert-comptable), which in the opinion of its leaders had a legitimate claim to a monopoly on auditing. The second concerns the fate reserved for pre-reform audit practitioners (comissaires de societes), not all of whom would be admitted as members of the new auditing profession. audit, professionalisation, France,...|$|E

40|$|Abstract In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} an architecture for the <b>certification</b> <b>of</b> e-services in an inter-organizational scenario which fully meets both {{the reliability and}} security requirements for accounting management architectures defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the additional requirements which are specific to the inter-organizational scenario. The presented solution – successfully deployed in many italian public administrations – is based on reconstruction of network flows and it features low invasiveness and strong physical and logical independence from the application level. Additionally, it features a clear separation between management of the service and its control, thus avoiding risks easily arising when multiple roles are played by a same organization. Keywords: <b>Certification</b> <b>of</b> E-Services, <b>Accounting</b> Management. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{demand for}} {{consultants}} have increased {{during the last}} decades, and not the least within the service industry. There are two major accounting occupations related to the service industry existing in Sweden nowadays: the auditor and the accounting consultants. These professions are commonly being mistaken as being the same thing. However, while the accounting consultant used to be mainly occupied with bookkeeping, the profession is currently evolving into becoming more of an advisory role providing all kinds of services, {{at the same time}} as an auditor is limited in his/her advisory role since auditor independence is crucial. The auditor profession had a major advancement regarding its occupation and professional status in the beginning of the 1900 s, and now, the accounting consultant occupation seems to be on the verge of becoming similar in structure and in legitimacy to that of the auditors’’. In 2006, the trade associations, FAR and SRF, began the <b>certification</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> consultants, and shortly after that the establishment of Reko occurred. Reko is a norm setting regarding accepted accounting principles, it does not contain any regulations regarding the actual accounting, but guidelines and regulations for how the accounting services should be provided. Reko was primarily constructed in order to assure that the <b>accounting</b> services were <b>of</b> high quality, but the trade associations further desired the occupation to also gain status and that the accounting services provided would become more homogeneous among the authorized accounting consultants.   The purpose with our study is to see if Reko has served its purpose or if further actions need to be taken to fulfill these. Thus, we aim to investigate if Reko contributes to a higher quality in the accounting services provided, if the work <b>of</b> the authorized <b>accounting</b> consultants have become more homogeneous, and if there has been an enhancement regarding the occupational role and its status since the advent of Reko.   In order to achieve the purpose of this research, one main research question and three sub queries were constructed. A quantitative research strategy was used in order to collect empirical data that would provide answers to the research questions of this thesis. The method for collecting this data was through an online survey that was sent out to all the authorized accounting consultants registered as members at SRF. The empirical data collected was then analyzed in alignment to Reko, service quality theory, and new institutional theory.   Our empirical findings indicate that there is no distinct increase in quality, though, the authorized accounting consultants appear to use Reko rigorously at their work place and follow the various Rekos. The desired homogenization <b>of</b> the <b>accounting</b> consultants’ services provided can be considered achieved according to the empirical findings of this study, and the majority <b>of</b> the authorized <b>accounting</b> consultants further perceive an increase in the status and a strengthening of their professional role since the establishment of Reko. ...|$|R
