2500|$|The Late Copper Age is {{regarded}} as a <b>continuous</b> <b>culture</b> system connecting the Upper Rhine valley to {{the western edge of the}} Carpathian Basin. Late Copper Age 1 was defined in Southern Germany by the connection of the late Cham Culture, Globular Amphora culture and the older Corded Ware Culture of [...] "beaker group 1" [...] that is also referred to as Horizon A or Step A. Early Bell Beaker Culture intruded into the region at the end of the Late Copper Age 1, at about 2600–2550 BC. Middle Bell Beaker corresponds to Late Copper Age 2 and here an east–west Bell Beaker cultural gradient became visible through the difference in the distribution of the groups of beakers with and without handles, cups and bowls, in the three regions Austria–Western Hungary, the Danube catchment area of Southern Germany, and the Upper Rhine/lake Constance/Eastern Switzerland area for all subsequent Bell Beaker periods. This middle Bell Beaker Culture is the main period when almost all the cemeteries in Southern Germany begin. Younger Bell Beaker Culture of Early Bronze Age shows analogies to the Proto-Únětice Culture in Moravia and the Early Nagyrév Culture of the Carpathian Basin.|$|E

Carboxymethylcellulase (CMcellulase), xylanase and pectin lyase were primarily cell-associated during exponential growth in batch culture but accumulated in the supernatant during the stationary phase. Activities of CM-cellulase and xylanase were higher in cellobiose-limited than in NH 4 +limited <b>continuous</b> <b>cultures,</b> were {{inversely related to}} the growth rate and became progressively more cell-associated as the growth rate increased. The proportion of fermentation products in cellobiose-limited <b>continuous</b> <b>cultures</b> was dependent on the growth rate and the calculated cell yields per mol ATP (YATP) varied between 11. 92 and 16. 39.

40|$|An Aspergillus niger strain {{expressing a}} red-shifted green {{fluorescent}} protein (GFP) in the cytoplasm {{under the control of}} the glucoamylase promoter (PglaA) was characterized with respect to its physiology and morphology. Although xylose acted as a repressor carbon source during batch cultivations, PglaA-driven GFP expression by the glucoamylase promoter could be demonstrated in xylose-limited <b>continuous</b> <b>cultures.</b> In these cultivations, the xylose concentration was therefore too low to cause repression. Transient experiments initiated with a maltose pulse did not further induce red-shifted GFP production in xylose-limited <b>continuous</b> <b>cultures.</b> Maltose induction under conditions of xylose repression was microscopically observed and quantified in a flow-through chamber. Red-shifted GFP was first produced after 5 h induction.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 1989 The {{availability}} of limiting nutrients {{is a critical}} factor regulating growth of aquatic microorganisms. In at least some aquatic systems the frequency of addition rather than the absolute concentration of nutrients controls community structure. Gnotobiotic <b>continuous</b> <b>cultures</b> were {{used to examine the}} growth characteristics of a green alga (Selenastrum capricornutum) and a heterotrophic yeast (Rhodotorula rubra) when phosphorus-limited steady-state populations were subjected to varying concentrations of pulsed phosphorus. The responses of these organisms to phosphorus additions were measured both in single and dual species <b>continuous</b> <b>cultures.</b> Both organisms exceeded the maximum transport rates for phosphorus predicted from batch and steady-state <b>continuous</b> <b>cultures.</b> Carbon limitation did not cause a decline in phosphorus accumulation in R. rubra. Carbon-limited yeast cultures perturbed with phosphorus attained the highest phosphorus per cell values seen in these studies. The phosphorus pool was not significantly diminished in these cultures only because the total yeast biomass was limited by carbon. These results suggest that carbon-limitation of heterotrophic populations may be essential to the existence of phytoplankton in low-nutrient aquatic environments...|$|R

40|$|During batch {{growth on}} {{mixtures}} of two growth-limiting substrates, microbes consume the substrates either sequentially or simultaneously. These growth patterns are manifested in {{all types of}} bacteria and yeasts. The ubiquity of these growth patterns suggests that they are driven by a universal mechanism common to all microbial species. In previous work, we showed that a minimal model accounting only for enzyme induction and dilution explains the phenotypes observed in batch cultures of various wild-type and mutant/recombinant cells. Here, we examine {{the extension of the}} minimal model to <b>continuous</b> <b>cultures.</b> We show that: (1) Several enzymatic trends, usually attributed to specific regulatory mechanisms such as catabolite repression, are completely accounted for by dilution. (2) The bifurcation diagram of the minimal model for <b>continuous</b> <b>cultures,</b> which classifies the substrate consumption pattern at any given dilution rate and feed concentrations, provides a a precise explanation for the empirically observed correlation between the growth patterns in batch and <b>continuous</b> <b>cultures.</b> (3) Numerical simulations of the model are in excellent agreement with the data. The model captures the variation of the steady state substrate concentrations, cell densities, and enzyme levels during the single- and mixed-substrate growth of bacteria and yeasts at various dilution rates and feed concentrations. (4) This variation is well-approximated by simple analytical expressions that furnish physical insights into the steady states of <b>continuous</b> <b>cultures.</b> The minimal model provides a framework for quantitating the effect of regulatory mechanisms. We illustrate this by analyzing several data sets from the literature. Comment: 67 pages, 20 figure...|$|R

50|$|Batch {{culture is}} the most common {{laboratory}} growth method in which bacterial growth is studied, but it is only one of many. It is ideally spatially unstructured and temporally structured. The bacterial culture is incubated in a closed vessel with a single batch of medium.

This is a chemostat, also known as <b>continuous</b> <b>culture.</b> It is ideally spatially unstructured and temporally unstructured, in a steady state defined by the rates of nutrient supply and bacterial growth.

40|$|Batch {{cultures}} (pH 6. 7) of Streptococcus bovis JB 1 were severely inhibited by 1. 25 and 5 microM lasalocid and monensin, respectively, {{even though}} {{large amounts of}} glucose remained in the medium. However, <b>continuous</b> <b>cultures</b> tolerated as much as 10 and 20 microM, respectively, and used {{virtually all of the}} glucose. Although <b>continuous</b> <b>cultures</b> grew with high concentrations of ionophore, the yield of bacterial protein decreased approximately 10 -fold. When pH was decreased from 6. 7 to 5. 7, the potency of both ionophores increased, but lasalocid always caused a larger decrease in yield. The increased activity of lasalocid at pH 5. 7 could largely be explained by an increased binding of the ionophore to the cell membrane. Because monensin did not show an increased binding at low pH, some other factor (e. g., ion turnover) must have been influencing its activity. There was a linear increase in lasalocid binding as the concentration increased, but monensin binding increased markedly at high concentrations. Based on the observations that (i) S. bovis cells bound significant amounts of ionophore (the ratio of ionophore to cell material was more important than the absolute concentration), (ii) batch cultures responded differently from <b>continuous</b> <b>cultures,</b> and (iii) pH can have a marked effect on ionophore activity, it appears that the term "minimum inhibitory concentration" may not provide an accurate assessment of microbial growth inhibition in vivo...|$|R
