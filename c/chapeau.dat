Armigers are permitted to wear one silver eagle feather behind the circlet (or on certain occasions a real eagle feather).

If an Armiger is a member of a Scottish clan he or she may wear the crest badge of their chief, however it must be encircled by a strap and buckle (see Un-armigerous clan members below).|$|E

5|$|Laces, straps, or rivets {{were used}} to affix the crest to the helm, with the join being covered by a circlet of twisted cloth known as a torse or wreath, or by a coronet {{in the case of}} {{high-ranking}} nobles. Torses did not come into regular use in Britain until the 15th century, and are still uncommon on the Continent, where crests are usually depicted as continuing into the mantling. Crests were also sometimes mounted on a furred cap known as a <b>chapeau,</b> as in the royal crest of England.|$|E
5|$|On 16 August 1950 {{the brigade}} was first {{designated}} as the 20th Engineer Brigade and activated at Camp Leonard Wood, Missouri. It deployed overseas to France in November 1952 and established headquarters in Croix <b>Chapeau.</b> Comprising two battalions and six separate companies, the brigade provided engineer construction support to the Base Section of the European COMMZ in southwestern France. In August 1954, it redeployed back to the United States and was activated at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, on 10 September 1954. From that time until its inactivation on 12 December 1958, the brigade provided engineer support to the XVIII Airborne Corps.|$|E
5|$|Clan chiefs may {{wear their}} crest simpliciter, that is without being encircled by the motto {{and without any}} feathers. It is more common, however, for a clan chiefs to wear their own {{personal}} crest within a plain circlet inscribed with their motto or slogan (pictured left). The chief's crest badge does not contain the strap and buckle that other clan members are permitted to wear. Clan chiefs are also entitled to wear three eagle feathers behind the circlet of their crest badge. On certain occasions, such as clan gatherings, it may be appropriate to use real eagle feathers. Clan chiefs that {{are members of the}} British Peerage or a feudal baron are entitled to wear the appropriate coronet or baronial <b>chapeau</b> above the circlet on their crest badge, though {{this is a matter of}} personal preference.|$|E

5|$|Clan chieftains, like clan chiefs, may {{wear their}} own {{personal}} crest within a plain circlet inscribed with their own motto or slogan. Clan chieftains may also wear two small eagle feathers (unlike the chief's three). On certain occasions real eagle feathers may be worn behind the crest badge. If a clan chieftain {{is a member of}} the British Peerage or a feudal baron they are permitted to wear the appropriate coronet or baronial <b>chapeau</b> above the circlet on their crest badge. Recently feudal barons have taken to wearing two eagle feathers behind their armiger's badge but there is no ancient tradition of this and it is solely based upon the fact that anciently feudal barons were most likely to have been chiefs or chieftains. If the feudal baron is a member of a clan it is advisable to consult the clan chief on clan customs and traditions. The Lord Lyon only gives guidance and not governance on the wearing of feathers and recommends consulting with a clan chief who approves the number of feathers worn by members of the clan.|$|E
25|$|Femme au <b>Chapeau</b> or Woman with a Hat is an oil {{painting}} created circa 1906 by the French artist and theorist Jean Metzinger (1883–1956). The work is executed {{in a highly}} personal Divisionist style with a marked Proto-Cubist component {{during the height of}} Fauvism. Femme au <b>Chapeau</b> exhibits a presentiment of Metzinger's subsequent interest in the faceting of form associated with Cubism. The painting now forms part of the collection of the Korban Art Foundation.|$|E

25|$|Metzinger's use {{of color}} in Femme au <b>Chapeau</b> is very {{closely related to the}} works of artist {{directly}} in his entourage known as the Fauves; quasi-pure greens, blues and violets, juxtaposed in groups far from randomly.

25|$|Femme au <b>Chapeau</b> is an oil {{painting}} on canvas with dimensions 44.8 x 36.8cm (17 5/8 x 14½ in.), signed J.Metzinger (lower right). The work—executed {{in a style}} consistent with other works by Metzinger created between 1905 and 1907, such as Two Nudes in an Exotic Landscape—is a portrait of an elegant women gazing self-assuredly directly at the spectator, wearing a fashionable wide-brimmed hat with a large green-bleu bow tied in a simple knot.|$|E
25|$|In November 2010, a {{painting}} of a nude by Amedeo Modigliani, part of a series of nudes he created around 1917, sold for more than $68.9m (£42.7m) at an auction in New York—a record for the artist's work. Bidding for La Belle Romaine pushed its price well past its $40m (£24.8m) estimate. Modigliani's previous auction record was 43.2m euros (£35.8m), set earlier in 2010 in Paris. Another painting by the artist—Jeanne Hébuterne (au <b>chapeau),</b> one of the first portraits he painted of his lover—sold for $19.1m (£11.8m), much higher than its pre-sale estimate of $9–12m (£5.6–7.4m).|$|E

25|$|Two Nudes in an Exotic Landscape is an oil {{painting}} on canvas with dimensions 116 x 88.8cm (45 3/8 by 35 in), signed Metzinger (lower right). The work—consistent in style with other works by Metzinger created circa 1905-1906, such as Femme au <b>Chapeau</b> (Woman with a Hat)—represents two nude women, one {{seen from the}} rear and the other from a more frontal position, in a lush, tropical, or subtropical setting. The landscape contains {{a wide variety of}} exotic geometrized elements (trees, bushes, flowers, a lake or river, a mountain range and a partly cloudy sky). Metzinger's use of color in Two Nudes is extremely Fauve; quasi-pure reds, greens, blues and violets, juxtaposed in groups as if randomly.|$|E
500|$|The first {{addition}} to the shield was {{in the form of}} a crest borne above the shield. It was during the reign of Edward III that the crest began to be widely used in English heraldry. The first representation of a royal crest was in Edward's third Great Seal, which showed a helm above the arms, and thereon a gold lion passant guardant standing upon a <b>chapeau,</b> and bearing a royal crown on its head. The design underwent minor variations until it took on its present form in the reign of Henry VIII: [...] "The Royal Crown proper, thereon a lion statant guardant Or, royally crowned also proper".|$|E
500|$|The {{painting}} {{is regarded as}} [...] "another of his comments {{on the way in}} which we view art." [...] The work, along with his Femme au <b>Chapeau</b> from 1962 mark the beginnings of Lichtenstein's presentations of art about art because it was among his first paintings that drew upon a predecessor artist. Lichtenstein noted his objection to the attempt to reduce art diagrammatically: [...] "I wasn't trying to berate Erle Loran ... but it is such an oversimplification trying to explain a painting by A, B, C." [...] He also noted that [...] "The Cézanne is such a complex painting. Taking an outline and calling it Madame Cézanne is in itself humorous, particularly the idea of diagramming a Cézanne when Cézanne said, '... the outline escaped me.'" ...|$|E

500|$|Hergé used The Broken Ear to {{allude to}} real events that had {{recently}} {{taken place in}} South America. The fictional countries of San Theodoros and Nuevo Rico {{were based on the}} real countries Bolivia and Paraguay, while the Gran Chapo War depicted in the strip was an allusion to the Gran Chaco War (1932–35) that was waged between Bolivian and Paraguayan forces over lucrative oil fields in the Gran Chaco region. The name [...] "Gran Chapo" [...] was a pun on the French grand <b>chapeau,</b> meaning [...] "big hat", while the name Nuevo Rico was a pun on nouveau riche {{and the name of the}} Nuevo Rican capital city, Sanfación, was a pun on sans façon, meaning [...] "without manners". Hergé's character Basil Bazarov, of the Vicking Arms Company Ltd (Basil Mazaroff in the 1937 edition), was a thinly veiled allusion to the real-life Greek weapons seller Basil Zaharoff of Vickers Armstrong, who profited from the conflict by supplying arms to both Paraguay and Bolivia. Hergé had learned about the conflict and the western corporations profiting from it through two issues of anti-conformist Belgian magazine La Crapouillot (The Mortar Shell), which covered news stories ignored by the mainstream media. It is also likely that he had read Richard Lewinsohn's 1930 book Zaharoff, l'Européen mystérieux (Zaharoff, the Mysterious European), which had been referenced in La Crapouillot.|$|E
