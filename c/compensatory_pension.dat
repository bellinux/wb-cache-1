30|$|Finally, in December 2008, as a {{consequence}} of the global financial crisis which started in September 2008 and after more than a decade of criticism of the multi-pillar regime, the scheme changed again, returning to a single public pillar with a PAYG scheme. The pension is composed of the universal pension benefit and <b>compensatory</b> <b>pension,</b> which is included to compensate for the elimination of individual capitalization. This system is financed by current contributions, and shortfalls in the current period are covered by general taxation or deficits. The employee and employer contributions have not changed, but the administrator of the resources has changed. Despite this reform, the requirements to access a pension are still relatively strict in comparison with the rest of the region. In the model estimation, I will consider the 1995 – 2008 period in order to capture the first scheme.|$|E
40|$|The {{welfare state}} {{is not merely a}} {{stand-in}} for missing markets; it can do a whole lot more. When generations overlap and the young must borrow to make educational investments, a dynamically-efficient welfare state, by taxing the middle-aged and offering a <b>compensatory</b> old-age <b>pension,</b> can generate higher long-run human capital and welfare compared to laissez faire. Along the transition, no generation is hurt and some are better off. If an intergenerational human capital externality is present, unfunded pensions can be gradually phased out entirely. Public pension reform can be rationalized on efficiency grounds without relying on political-economy concerns or aging...|$|R
40|$|Bolivia's bold {{program of}} pension reform {{involved}} the immediate closing {{down of the}} old pay-as-you-go system and its replacement by a defined-contribution system based on individual capitalization accounts and managed by the private sector. The pensions of the old system will {{be covered by the}} Bolivian Treasury. Workers will receive <b>compensatory</b> <b>pensions</b> for their contributions to the old system. These will be calculated {{on the basis of a}} simple formula that could be improved to reduce the cost of transition. To avoid high marketing costs, Bolivia has entrusted management of the system to two groups selected through international competitive bidding (to minimize fees). Individual accounts have been preallocated to those two groups on a regional basis or, in large cities, on the basis of the birthdays of affiliated workers. Competition for individual accounts will be allowed in the year 2000 and the market will be opened to other private pension-fund administrators (AFPs) in 2002. Proceeds from the capitalization program will be used to pay an annuity to all Bolivians 65 and older. Funds from the capitalization program will also be managed by the two selected AFPs. Custodianship has been entrusted to a multinational group offering global custodial services. AFP investments are only subject to upper limits, including relatively high limits for foreign assets. However, they must initially purchase a certain quantity of treasury bonds to help finance the cost of transition. Bolivian pension reform faces major challenges: a) To create a competitive market for management of pension fund resources and hence achieve competitive returns on investment and higher pensions; b) To eliminate the requirement of investment in treasury bonds; and c) To insulate the system from attempts to use AFP funds and capitalization proceeds for public projects. (One way to achieve this would be to transfer ownership of the capitalization proceeds to individual Bolivians.)

40|$|Research on {{the effects}} of Vietnam {{military}} service suggests that Vietnam veterans experienced significantly higher mortality than both non-Vietnam veterans and the civilian population at large. These results, however, may be biased by non-random selection into the military if unobserved background differences between veterans and non-veterans affect mortality directly. The present study generates unbiased estimates of the causal impact of Vietnam era draft eligibility on male mortality. Using records from the Vietnam draft lottery to assign decedents born 1950 - 1952 draft lottery numbers, the study estimates excess mortality among observed draft eligible male decedents as compared to the (1) expected proportion of draft eligible decedents given Vietnam draft eligibility cutoffs and (2) observed proportion of draft eligible female decedents. The results demonstrate that {{there appears to be no}} effect of draft exposure on mortality (even cause-specific death rates). When we examine population subgroups—including splits by race, educational attainment, nativity and marital status—we find weak evidence for an interaction between education and draft eligibility. On the whole, these results suggest that previous research, which has shown that Vietnam-era veterans experienced significantly higher mortality than non-veterans, may be biased by non-random selection into the military and may thus overstate the need for <b>compensatory</b> government <b>pensions.</b> ...|$|R
