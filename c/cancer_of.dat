5|$|Parathyroid {{carcinoma}} (<b>cancer</b> <b>of</b> the parathyroid gland) is {{the rarest}} cause of OFC, accounting for about 0.5% {{of all cases}} of hyperparathyroidism. OFC onset by parathyroid carcinoma is difficult to diagnose.|$|E
5|$|Along with Seaborg, McMillan and Wahl, Kennedy {{received}} $400,000 {{dollars from}} the Atomic Energy Commission in compensation for their scientific work.

50|$|Tobacco: It is {{the leading}} cause <b>of</b> <b>cancer</b> and <b>of</b> death from <b>cancer.</b> Smoking is {{associated}} with increased risk <b>of</b> <b>cancers</b> <b>of</b> lung, larynx, mouth, oesophagus, throat, bladder, kidney, liver, stomach, pancreas, colon, rectum, cervix and acute myeloid leukemia. Smokeless tobacco (snuff or chewing tobacco) is associated with increased risks <b>of</b> <b>cancers</b> <b>of</b> the mouth, oesophagus, and pancreas.|$|R

25|$|<b>Cancers</b> <b>of</b> {{the bone}} are managed {{according}} to their type, their stage, prognosis, and what symptoms they cause. Many primary <b>cancers</b> <b>of</b> bone are treated with radiotherapy. <b>Cancers</b> <b>of</b> bone marrow may be treated with chemotherapy, {{and other forms of}} targeted therapy such as immunotherapy may be used. Palliative care, which focuses on maximising a person's quality of life, {{may play a role in}} management, particularly if the likelihood of survival within five years is poor.|$|R
5|$|An X-ray of {{swallowed}} barium {{may be used}} {{to reveal}} {{the size and shape of}} the esophagus, and the presence of any masses. The esophagus may also be imaged using a flexible camera inserted into the esophagus, in a procedure called an endoscopy. If an endoscopy is used on the stomach, the camera will also have to pass through the esophagus. During an endoscopy, a biopsy may be taken. If <b>cancer</b> <b>of</b> the esophagus is being investigated, other methods, including a CT scan, may also be used.|$|E
5|$|Asbestos {{can cause}} a variety of lung diseases, {{including}} lung cancer. Tobacco smoking and asbestos have a synergistic effect on the formation of lung cancer. In smokers who work with asbestos, the risk of lung cancer is increased 45-fold compared to the general population. Asbestos can also cause <b>cancer</b> <b>of</b> the pleura, called mesothelioma (which is different from lung cancer).|$|E
5|$|Cholangiocarcinoma, {{also known}} as bile duct cancer, {{is a form of}} cancer that is {{composed}} of mutated epithelial cells (or cells showing characteristics of epithelial differentiation) that originate in the bile ducts which drain bile from the liver into the small intestine.

5|$|Ebert {{lived with}} <b>cancer</b> <b>of</b> the thyroid and salivary glands from 2002.

5|$|Hip and elbow {{dysplasia}} are common. Giant Schnauzers {{are also}} prone to eye {{problems such as}} keratoconjunctivitis sicca, glaucoma, cataracts, multifocal retinal dysplasia, and generalized progressive retinal atrophy. They are also prone to skin diseases, such as seasonal flank alopecia, vitiligo, and follicular cysts. <b>Cancer</b> <b>of</b> the skin is common in dark-colored dogs, with the most frequently occurring varieties being melanoma of the limbs and digits, and squamous cell carcinoma of the digit. This susceptibility occurs because melanoma {{is caused by a}} defect in the melanocytes, the cells that darken the color of the skin. Noncancerous skin tumors are also common.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, he was {{informed}} that he had <b>cancer</b> <b>of</b> the lungs, liver and pancreas. He died six week later, on 3 December 1993, at a nursing home in Walnut Creek, California. He was survived by his son Michael and younger brother Carl. His second wife, Mary Teresa Benderska, whom he had married on 29 October 1948, had died in 1986, and his daughter Gelen Christine had died in 1965.

40|$|Tobacco, alcohol, and betel quid are {{the main}} causes <b>of</b> {{squamous}} cell <b>cancers</b> <b>of</b> the upper aerodigestive tract.

Globally there are several million people who have survived either head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC) or lung cancer (LC).

5|$|In 2012, endometrial cancers newly {{occurred}} in 320,000women and caused 76,000deaths. This {{makes it the}} third {{most common cause of}} death in cancers which only affect women, behind ovarian and cervical cancer. It is more common in the developed world and is the most common <b>cancer</b> <b>of</b> the female reproductive tract in developed countries. Rates of endometrial cancer have risen in a number of countries between the 1980s and 2010. This is believed to be due to the increasing number of elderly people and increasing rates of obesity.|$|E
5|$|In August 1955 Beryl felt unwell {{and went}} for tests: she was {{diagnosed}} with <b>cancer</b> <b>of</b> the uterus and was given two years to live. The couple reacted to the news in different ways, and while Beryl began to drink heavily—up to a bottle of whisky a day to dull the pain—George began to work harder, and began a close friendship with a school teacher, Pat Howson.|$|E

5|$|In {{a survey}} {{conducted}} by The Kennel Club, {{the primary cause of}} death for Fox Terriers was old age, causing 31.8% of reported deaths. The secondary cause was <b>cancer</b> <b>of</b> an unspecified type, which accounted for 22.7% of reports. The average lifespan of a Fox Terrier is around 15 years; however, the Kennel Club survey reported a median age at death of 13 years and 2 months.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the acute effects, radiation exposure (both internal and external) carries a long-term risk of death from <b>cancer</b> <b>of</b> 5–10% per Sv. The general population is exposed to small amounts of polonium as a radon daughter in indoor air; the isotopes 214Po and 218Po are thought to cause {{the majority of the}} estimated 15,000–22,000 lung cancer deaths in the US every year that have been attributed to indoor radon. Tobacco smoking causes additional exposure to polonium.|$|E
5|$|Pain from <b>cancer</b> <b>of</b> the organs, such as {{the stomach}} or liver (visceral pain), is diffuse and {{difficult}} to locate, and {{is often referred to}} more distant, usually superficial, sites.

40|$|Cancer is {{a disease}} that is widely feared because of its {{prevalence}} and incidence, its widespread causes (heredity, environment, lifestyle) {{and the belief that}} 'everything causes cancer'. We review evidence on knowledge <b>of</b> <b>cancer</b> and find that knowledge is very limited. Then we examine factors that are related to knowledge <b>of</b> <b>cancer</b> and the pursuit of additional knowledge about cancer and factors that are related to health care behavior such as low rates <b>of</b> participation in <b>cancer</b> screening tests. This review leads us to conceptualize the essential, and perhaps central, role that fear <b>of</b> <b>cancer</b> has in the psychology <b>of</b> <b>cancer.</b> We then explore why <b>cancer</b> and fear <b>of</b> <b>cancer</b> have gained much attention in communities located near hazardous waste sites. <b>cancer</b> fear <b>of</b> <b>cancer</b> knowledge <b>of</b> <b>cancer</b> hazardous wastes cancer phobia...|$|R

5|$|The {{addition}} of weight loss, appetite loss, vomiting, polyuria, and polydipsia to the aforementioned symptoms {{may indicate that}} OFC {{is the result of}} parathyroid carcinoma. Parathyroid carcinoma, an uncommon <b>cancer</b> <b>of</b> the parathyroid glands, is generally indicated by serum calcium levels higher than usual, even in comparison to the high serum calcium levels that OFC generally presents with. Symptoms are also often more severe. Generally, the presence of a palpable neck mass is also indicative of the cancer, occurring in approximately 50% of sufferers, but virtually nonexistent in individuals with OFC with a different origin.|$|E

5|$|When rehearsals {{opened in}} September 1955, Rodgers {{assembled}} {{the cast and}} told them that he was going into the hospital for a minor operation.

The surgery required removal of part of the jawbone and tongue, and some of the lymph nodes. The operation took place on September 21, 1955; within ten days of the operation he was back in the theatre watching rehearsals, though for some time only as a spectator.|$|E
