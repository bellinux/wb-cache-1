40|$|Prior studies {{demonstrate}} that air recirculation can reduce exposure to nanoparticles in vehicle cabins. However when people occupy confined spaces, air recirculation {{can lead to}} carbon dioxide (CO 2) accumulation which can potentially lead to deleterious effects on cognitive function. This study proposes a fractional air recirculation system for reducing nanoparticle concentration while simultaneously suppressing CO 2 levels in the cabin. Several recirculation scenarios were tested using a custom-programmed HVAC (heat, ventilation, air conditioning) unit that varied the recirculation door angle in the test vehicle. Operating the recirculation system with a standard <b>cabin</b> <b>filter</b> reduced particle concentrations to 1000 particles/cm(3), although CO 2 levels rose to 3000 ppm. When as little as 25 % fresh air was introduced (75 % recirculation), CO 2 levels dropped to 1000 ppm, while particle concentrations remained below 5000 particles/cm(3). We found that nanoparticles were removed selectively during recirculation and demonstrated the trade-off between cabin CO 2 concentration and cabin particle concentration using fractional air recirculation. Data showed significant increases in CO 2 levels during 100 % recirculation. For various fan speeds, recirculation fractions of 50 - 75 % maintained lower CO 2 levels in the cabin, while still reducing particulate levels. We recommend fractional recirculation as a simple method to reduce occupants' exposures to particulate matter and CO 2 in vehicles. A design with several fractional recirculation settings could allow air exchange adequate for reducing both particulate and CO 2 exposures. Developing this technology could lead to reductions in airborne nanoparticle exposure, while also mitigating safety risks from CO 2 accumulation.

40|$|The {{main focus}} {{of this study is}} to {{determine}} the levels of potentially toxic elements (PTE) collected from <b>cabin</b> particle <b>filters</b> in and around Cork city. <b>Cabin</b> particle <b>filters</b> are used in motor vehicles to extract toxins from air coming through the ventilation system. A systematic study of pollutants captured over fixed mileages on <b>cabin</b> <b>filters</b> has not previously been reported in literature, despite being an obvious and widespread sample source to measure potential exposure in traffic streams. This study presents quantitative data for a range of analytes from filters harvested from vehicles at set mileages. Different open and closed vessel acid digestion methods were compared to determine which extraction method yields optimum recoveries for a known standard reference material (NIST 1648 a Urban Particulate Matter). Analyte concentrations from filter samples were determined using inductively coupled plasma emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). SEM analysis was used to provide imagery of the filter surface to determine the size of particulates being extracted by the filters. The extraction efficiencies of particle filters were analysed with respect to the following variables: filter manufacturer, car model, varying kilometerages and different filter types. Air purifiers were also placed in the car’s cabins to analyse the concentrations of analytes passing though the ventilation system into the cabin, with and without a particle filter in place. Cycling filters, worn by a cyclist for 500 km intervals, were also tested to analyse the difference between exposures in a vehicle compared to at the roadside. From SEM images obtained there appears to be degradation in the filter structure with use, this degradation affects the filters ability to retain particulates. This degradation has a direct impact on the retention of certain PTEs which are bound to course or fine particulates. It was found that for all analytes, the level of capture increases steadily between 0 and 15, 000 km, followed by a significant increase between 15, 000 and 30, 000. The capture rate levels off between 30, 000 and 45, 000 km. <b>Cabin</b> <b>filters</b> with an activated carbon layer (combination filters) demonstrate a significant increase in pollutant capture. The possible health implications of exposure to reported analytes captured on the filters is also discussed due to the prevalence of convertible cars in warmer climates.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{evaluate}} {{the efficiency of}} different automotive <b>cabin</b> air <b>filters</b> to prevent penetration of components of diesel exhaust and thereby reduce biomedical effects in human subjects. Filtered air and unfiltered diluted diesel exhaust (DDE) were used as negative and positive controls, respectively, and were compared with exposure to DDE filtered with four different filter systems. METHODS: 32 Healthy non- smoking subjects (age 21 - 53) participated in the study. Each subject was exposed six times for 1 hour in a specially designed exposure chamber: once to air, once to unfiltered DDE, and once to DDE filtered with the four different <b>cabin</b> air <b>filters.</b> Particle concentrations during exposure to unfiltered DDE were kept at 300 micrograms/m 3. Two of the filters were particle filters. The other two were particle filters combined with active charcoal filters that might reduce certain gaseous components. Subjective symptoms were recorded and nasal airway lavage (NAL), acoustic rhinometry, and lung function measurements were performed. RESULTS: The two particle filters decreased the concentrations of diesel exhaust particles by about half, but did not reduce the intensity of symptoms induced by exhaust. The combination of active charcoal filters and a particle filter significantly reduced the symptoms and discomfort caused by the diesel exhaust. The most noticable differences in efficacy between the filters {{were found in the}} reduction of detection of an unpleasant smell from the diesel exhaust. In this respect even the two charcoal filter combinations differed significantly. The efficacy to reduce symptoms may depend on the abilities of the filters investigated to reduce certain hydrocarbons. No acute effects on NAL, rhinometry, and lung function variables were found. CONCLUSIONS: This study has shown that the use of active charcoal filters, and a particle filter, clearly reduced the intensity of symptoms induced by diesel exhaust.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Exposure to {{particulate}} matter (PM) air pollution especially derived from traffic {{is associated with}} increases in cardiorespiratory morbidity and mortality. In this study, we evaluated the ability of novel vehicle <b>cabin</b> air inlet <b>filters</b> to reduce diesel exhaust (DE) -induced symptoms and markers of inflammation in human subjects. METHODS: Thirty healthy subjects participated in a randomized double-blind controlled crossover study where they were exposed to filtered air, unfiltered DE and DE filtered through two selected particle filters, one with and one without active charcoal. Exposures lasted for one hour. Symptoms were assessed before and during exposures and lung function was measured before and after each exposure, with inflammation assessed in peripheral blood five hours after exposures. In parallel, PM were collected from unfiltered and filtered DE and assessed for their capacity to drive damaging oxidation reactions in a cell-free model, or promote inflammation in A 549 cells. RESULTS: The standard particle filter employed in this study reduced PM 10 mass concentrations within the exposure chamber by 46 %, further reduced to 74 % by the inclusion of an active charcoal component. In addition use of the active charcoal filter was associated by a 75 % and 50 % reduction in NO 2 and hydrocarbon concentrations, respectively. As expected, subjects reported more subjective symptoms after exposure to unfiltered DE compared to filtered air, which was significantly reduced by the filter with an active charcoal component. There were no significant changes in lung function after exposures. Similarly diesel exhaust did not elicit significant increases {{in any of the}} inflammatory markers examined in the peripheral blood samples 5  hour post-exposure. Whilst the filters reduced chamber particle concentrations, the oxidative activity of the particles themselves, did not change following filtration with either filter. In contrast, diesel exhaust PM passed through the active charcoal combination filter appeared less inflammatory to A 549 cells. CONCLUSIONS: A cabin air inlet particle filter including an active charcoal component was highly effective in reducing both DE particulate and gaseous components, with reduced exhaust-induced symptoms in healthy volunteers.
