The layout artist who designed it worked on the drawings for more than two days, but ultimately it was cut.

5|$|In 1990, {{the city}} {{released}} a china plate with the Peace Candle {{along with a}} Christmas tree, which was meant to symbolize the first tree in the nation, which was {{believed to have been}} erected in Easton in 1816. During the 2000 holiday season, the Easton Holiday Committee produced and sold commemorative plates marking the 50th anniversary of the Peace Candle, which included a painting of the structure by local artist Preston Hindmarch. They were sold for $32 along with ceramic ornaments of the Easton eatery Colonial Pizza, which sold for $22. Over the years, <b>Christmas</b> <b>cards</b> depicting the Peace Candle have continued {{to be used as a}} means of raising funds for the structure.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1914, van Meegeren moved his family to Scheveningen. That year, he {{completed}} the diploma examination at the Royal Academy of Art in The Hague. The diploma allowed him to teach, {{and he took a}} position as the assistant to Professor Gips, the Professor of Drawing and Art History, for the small monthly salary of 75 guldens. In March 1915, his daughter Pauline was born, later called Inez. To supplement his income, Han sketched posters and painted pictures for the commercial art trade, generally <b>Christmas</b> <b>cards,</b> still-life, landscapes, and portraits. Many of these paintings are quite valuable today.|$|E

5|$|The new candle was {{designed}} by the Allentown firm Alvin Butz Co., the Allentown firm Barry Isett & Associates, and Bethlehem Steel Corp. Supplies were provided by Dugan & Marcon Inc., Eisenhardt Mills, Ingersoll-Rand Co. and Dectis Painting, and the construction done by the Carpenters Union Local 600, Electricians Union Local 367 and the Northampton County Labor Council. It looked {{almost exactly the same}} as the old previous candle, with eight flood lights installed to illuminate the white shaft. The candle cost $35,000 to build, but Panto said without the help from volunteers, it would have cost around $150,000, not including labor. In order to cover the $15,000 shortfall in funds raised, the city sold <b>Christmas</b> <b>cards,</b> posters, ornaments and $10 Peace Candle ownership shares. The first lighting ceremony for the new candle was held November 23, 1990.|$|E

25|$|Blampied was a {{prolific}} illustrator and over 600 issues of {{magazines and newspapers}} have been recorded containing his work between 1905 and 1939.

He also designed menu cards, loyal addresses, sheet music, <b>Christmas</b> <b>cards,</b> commercial advertising material and bookplates.|$|E
25|$|Unlike other mob bosses {{who were}} remote and {{reluctant}} to talk to outsiders, Salerno was very accessible. Mafiosi from Cleveland, Philadelphia, New England, Buffalo and other cities would visit Salerno to talk about various internal problems they wanted resolved. Salerno preferred a low-key existence and led an unpretentious life. He was never spotted at glitzy mob parties, nightclubs or other popular Mafia bistros. He even sent out <b>Christmas</b> <b>cards</b> {{with a picture of}} himself in pajamas on the front cover.|$|E
25|$|Santa Claus {{received}} some attention in 1961 when several advertisements {{appeared in the}} 1961 issue of Popular Mechanics, an American magazine devoted to science and technology.

The remailing service would result in a United States Postal Service postmark on the envelope reading Santa Claus, Arizona, something desirable around the annual Christmas holiday.|$|E

25|$|The logo for {{the company}} showed Fun Ho! in a script like form within an oval that {{included}} an odd portrait of a clown-like face that looks {{kind of like a}} laughing child with a beanie cap...or...a yelling oriental martial arts specialist. The riddle is solved when looking at a company catalog (leaflet) that zooms out showing a clown complete with ruffles and a tall pointed hat and carrying a Fun Ho! sign (Jordan 2015). The clown was most often printed in red, and was even used for company <b>Christmas</b> <b>cards</b> once upon a time (Jordan 2015). The logo was probably OK from the 1930s through the 1960s, but as an advertising gimmick, the design would probably would not work well with children today.|$|E
25|$|People try to {{stay awake}} and eat toshikoshisoba, noodles to be eaten at midnight. People also visit Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines. Traditionally three are visited. This is called sansha-mairi. In the Imperial Palace at dawn on the 1st, the Emperor {{performs}} the rite of shihōhai (worship of the four-quarters), in which he offers prayers {{for the well-being of}} the nation. On January 2 the public is allowed to enter the inner palace grounds; the only other day this is possible is the Emperor's birthday (December 23). On the 2nd and 3rd days acquaintances visit one another to extend greetings (nenshi) and sip otoso (a spiced rice wine). Some games played at New Year's are karuta (a card game), hanetsuki (similar to badminton), tako age (kiteflying), and komamawashi (spinning tops). These games are played to bring more luck for the year. Exchanging New Year's greeting cards (similar to <b>Christmas</b> <b>Cards)</b> is another important Japanese custom. Also special allowances are given to children, which are called otoshidama. They also decorate their entrances with kagami mochi (two mochi rice balls placed {{one on top of the}} other, with a tangerine on top), and kadomatsu (pine tree decorations).|$|E

500|$|Potter {{asserted}} her tales {{would one}} day be nursery classics, and part of the [...] "longevity of her books comes from strategy", writes Potter biographer Ruth MacDonald.

Similar [...] "side-shows" [...] (as she termed the ancillary merchandise) were produced throughout her life.

Suzy comes in and tells Fauna of the date; that Doc made no pass at her, and that Doc confided how lonely he is. She is convinced Doc [...] "don't need nobody like me"; he needs a wife. Fauna is encouraging, but Suzy believes that Doc, knowing what he does of her history and work, will not want her. The Flophouse is to host a fancy dress party the following night, at which the raffle is to take place—Fauna proposes that at the party, Suzy sing [...] "Will You Marry Me?" [...] to Doc. Suzy is still nervous; Fauna reminds her that the previous night, Doc did not treat her like a tramp, and she did not act like one. As word spreads of the celebration, the community becomes enthusiastic about the get-together ("The Party That We're Gonna Have Tomorrow Night") ...|$|E
