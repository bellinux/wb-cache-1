An innovation could be to incorporate a proposal for burden sharing between countries in Living Wills. This may enable burden sharing on an institution by institution basis. There remain, however, problems arising from the inconsistencies and incompatibility of the laws relating to the insolvency procedures in the various countries.

40|$|Two {{international}} banking challenges {{will provide}} the future growth and rationale for information technology (IT) outsourcing in the financial sector. The first challenge is the multi-faceted risk associated with <b>cross-border</b> <b>financial</b> flows. <b>Institutions</b> are attempting to manage long-term risk {{through the use of}} financial derivative products. However, most short-term risk relates to structural (i. e. time zone or regulatory constraints) or settlement system shortcomings and individual institutions have few risk management tools. The second challenge involves the difficulty of developing truly global full-service financial firms. National regulations remain the major obstacle to foreign direct investment. However, de-regulation, particularly within Europe and North America has highlighted the difficulty of developing critical mass within fragmented national financial sectors. IT outsourcing could be a powerful tool in addressing these challenges, however, it is not currently structured, promoted or perceived as such. ...|$|R

40|$|This Article {{compares the}} {{development}} of cross-border solutions for resolving and reorganizing commercial entities to those solutions available for <b>financial</b> <b>institutions.</b> This Article argues that the resolution regime for <b>financial</b> <b>institutions</b> needs to move forward from the existing international best practices approach, embodied in the Financial Stability Board (FSB) Key Attributes for Resolution Regimes, to a more formal legal framework for cross-border resolution, similar to the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) Model Law for Cross-Border Insolvency. In doing so, this Article identifies {{a gap in the}} international infrastructure for resolutions. While UNCITRAL promulgated a model law to provide for cross-border insolvencies in 1997, there has been reluctance to take a similar path with regard to the resolution of international <b>financial</b> <b>institutions,</b> even though the stakes are very high. This Article addresses possible reasons for this reluctance, draws lessons from the commercial sphere, and explores the relevance of the UNCITRAL Model Law framework to <b>financial</b> <b>institutions.</b> This Article also analyzes the recent FSB initiative on cross-border resolution and the recently promulgated International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) Resolution Stay Protocol that seek to promote certainty in the application of resolution measures across borders. This Article argues that these primarily contract-based initiatives are important contributions to the standardization and improvement of the standards on the treatment of financial contracts in insolvency and resolution.

The design of trade policy should therefore emphasize the nexus with the macroeconomic framework and other financial sector policies, especially prudential and capital account regulations.

Moreover, international policy coordination {{is less likely to}} be sustained when the policy maker is short-sighted and the banking sector has greater political influence.

40|$|After the {{introduction}} of the euro in 1999, the debate on the financial stability architecture in the EU focused on the adequacy of a decentralised setting based on national responsibilities for preventing and managing crises. The Financial Services Action Plan in 1999 and {{the introduction}} of the Lamfalussy process for financial regulation and supervision in 2001 enhanced the decentralised arrangements by increasing significantly the level of legal harmonisation and supervisory cooperation. In addition, authorities adopted EU-wide MoUs to safeguard <b>cross-border</b> <b>financial</b> stability.

Before detailing the own proposition, this paper looks into the relationship between sovereign debt and banking crises that drive regulatory reactions to the financial turmoil in the Euro area. These initiatives inter alia affirm effective prudential supervision as a pivotal element of crisis prevention.
