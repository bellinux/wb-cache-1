The derived algorithm is {{applicable to the}} learning of fuzzy connection weights with various shapes such as triangular and trapezoid. First we briefly describe how a feedforward neural network can be fuzzified. Inputs, targets, and connection weights in the fiuzzified neural network can be fuzzy numbers. Next we define a cost function that measures the differences between a fuzzy target vector and an actual fuzzy output vector. Then we derive a learning algorithm from the cost function for adjusting fuzzy connection weights. Finally we show some results of computer simulations...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper reports {{preliminary}} work on developing methods automatically to index cases described in text {{so that a}} case-based reasoning system can reason with them. We are employing machine learning algorithms to classify fulltext legal opinions {{in terms of a}} set of predefined concepts. These factors, representing factual strengths and weaknesses in the case, are used in the case-based argumentation module of our instructional environment CATO. We first show empirical evidence for the <b>conncetion</b> between the factor model and the vector representation of texts developed in information retrieval. In a set of hypotheses we sketch how including knowledge about the meaning of the factors, their relations and their use in the case-based reasoning system can improve learning, and discuss in what ways background knowledge about the domain can be beneficial. The paper presents initial experiments that show the limitations of purely inductive algorithms for the task. 1...|$|E
40|$|A major {{research}} topic at our institute {{is to build}} an atlas of planet Venus based on the image data received from the Magellan satellite. Most of the algorithms involved are very time consuming, and there are about 400 GByte of raw data to process. This requires high performance computing and parallel processing. We analyzed {{two of the most}} demanding algorithms [...] - Matching and Shape-fromShading. Although the structure of these algorithms di#er, using data decomposition in <b>conncetion</b> with an appropriate handling of the halo and dynamic load balancing leads to good performance results. Although our approach is very coarse grained, we demonstrate that e#ciency is above 80 % for most data sets. However, scaleup massively is limited by the I/O capabilities of the hardware. Our experiments were based on socket communication, Intel's NX-calls and MPI on machines like SGI CoW, SGI Power Challenge, Intel Paragon, Meiko CS 2 and Cray T 3 D. We found that all machine types can run radar [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The minisuperspace approximation, {{widely used}} in quantum cosmology, is used to study the {{properties}} of the wave function of a spherically symmetric quantum bubble. The case of the free bubble illustrtes the method which is then applied to the case of a bubble minimally coupled to the totally anti-symmetric tensor gauge potential Aμvp. The minisuperspace approximation fully preserves the relativistic properties of bubble dynamics but reduces the problem to that of the motion of a relativistic point-particle in an external electromagnetic potential in 1 + 1 dimensions. In this <b>conncetion</b> we discuss the analogue of the Klein effect for quantum bubbles: while a free bubble can exist in discrete levels of positive energy, with large bubbles being exponentially depressed, the interaction with the Aμvp potential leads to the crossing of positive and negative energy levels; this phenomenon gives rise to a finite probability that a bubble might tunnel to a classical configuration of arbitrarily large radius...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{doctoral}} {{project has}} been to study so-called non-idiomatic improvisation in ensembles consisting {{of two or three}} musicians who play together without any restrictions regarding style or genre and without having predetermined what is to be played or how they should play. The background to this thesis has been the author’s own free improvising, which he has pursued since 1974, and the questions that have arisen whilst music-making. The thesis takes three of these questions as its point of departure: – what is free ensemble improvisation, what characterizes free ensemble improvisation and how can it be defined – how does free ensemble improvisation relate to: – – instrumental technique – – idiomatic improvisation and stylistic influences – – composition – – interpretation – – aleatorics and indeterminacy – – different types of sytems (e. g. biological, social, dynamic/chaotic systems) – what might a conceptual model as a theoretical base for free ensemble improvisation look like? The artistic/performative part of this research project has primarily consisted of public concerts, as a result of longer/shorter periods of cooperation with four permanent and a number of temporary (ad hoc) ensembles. The results provide a better understanding of what free ensemble improvisation is, in what respects it differs from other forms of music-making and how it can be defined. Free ensemble improvisation’s relations to the points mentioned above were found to be more multifaceted than expected. However, it was possible to attain a basic twolayered conceptual model as a theoretical base for free ensemble improvisation and, in its extension, as a basis for the analysis of free ensemble improvisation. The study includes numerous concert projects, of which several are recorded and included in this book on two CDs with MP 3 files. There are two CDs with MP 3 -files attached to the thesis.

40|$|The {{association}} of Ankylosing Spondylitis(AS) and HLA B 27 {{is the strongest}} {{association of}} an autoimmune disease with a certain MHC known so far. Therefore different hypotheses have been developped to explain this <b>conncetion,</b> but still the pathogenensis of this disease remains unknown. In a previous study it has been shown, that HLA B 27 positive healthy donors and patients suffering from AS have a lower expression of proinflammatroy cytokines in CD 4 + and CD 8 + T-cells. Aim {{of the current study}} was to identify subpopulations of CD 4 + and CD 8 + T-cells that are responsible for this defect. The stimulation of sorted CD 4 + and CD 8 + T-cells and the definition of subpopulations of CD 4 + and CD 8 + T-cells according to the expression of CD 45 RA and CD 27 allowed a separate and exact analysis of cytokine production. Additionally the frequency of these subpopulations in the peripheral blood was determined. Thereby it was possible to identify antigen-experienced memory and effector CD 8 + T-cells as responsible for the lower TNF&# 61537; and IFN&# 61543; production observed in HLA B 27 positive persons. In contrast in all of the analysed subpopulations of CD 4 + T-cells no significant differences could be detected concerning cytokine production or in vivo TH 1 /TH 2 differentiation in HLA B 27 positive as compared to HLA B 27 negative donors. Also the frequencies of the subpopulations defined by CD 27 and CD 45 RA did not differ significantly. Altogether this might imply that in HLA B 27 positive donors there is a defect in CD 8 + T-cell differentiation or the activation of antigen-experienced CD 8 + T-cells, while this {{does not seem to have}} significant effects on CD 4 + T-cells. Further studies should aim to identify the molecular mechanisms that enable HLA B 27 to influence the magnitude of CD 8 + T-cell cytokine expression. This knowledge could help to understand the pathogenesis of the disease and thereby point to novel strategies for an improved therapy and possibly prophylaxis of Ankylosing Spondylitis...|$|E
