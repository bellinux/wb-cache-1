40|$|Two {{dates in}} 1999 {{can serve as}} pivots for space-related {{educational}} outreach. On August 11 a total solar eclipse will sweep across Europe and also across the Near East, where it will come remarkably close to matching the ancient eclipse (probably in 129 BC) used by Hipparchus to estimate {{the distance of the}} Moon. Using published eclipse data, students may conduct a similar calculation for 1999 and in the process obtain insights about astronomy, history and the way scientists work. October 19, 1999 will be the 100 th anniversary of the day when a teen-age Robert Goddard <b>climbed</b> a <b>cherry</b> tree near the Worcester home where his family was staying, intending to prune it. Sitting in that tree, Goddard began daydreaming about space flight, {{and by the time he}} came down he had resolved to dedicate his life to implementing that dream. He later marked that day as "Anniversary day," a personal holiday. Material on both subjects can be reached from [URL] sections 8 a and 26. The section on Goddard includes his experiments with a ballistic pendulum and the DeLaval nozzle, which laid the essential scientific foundation of spaceflight and which is also suitable for classroom presentation...|$|R
40|$|Quotation: "Every {{vision is}} a joke until the first man accomplishes it. " A Closer Look: Robert H. Goddard became {{interested}} in science {{at the age of}} five. He dreamed of rockets, and his fascination with flight remained with him throughout his life. In 1914 he {{came up with the idea}} of building a rocket while watching people launch fireworks. Throughout his life, he referred to his "Anniversary Day, " a day on which he dedicated his life to the development of attaining great heights and building space vehicles. This day was based on his experience on October 19, 1899, when at the age of 17, Goddard <b>climbed</b> a <b>cherry</b> tree in the back yard of his family's home. As he looked up to the evening sky, he thought of building a device that might reach the moon, or even Mars. He had recently read H. G. Wells' War of the Worlds, which had spurred his interest in planetary discovery. When he climbed down from the tree, he was filled with a sense of purpose in life. Goddard earned a Bachelor of Science degree from Worcester Polytechnic Institute in 1908 and became an instructor of physics there that same year. In 1912 Goddard first explored the practicality of using rocket power to reach high altitudes. He developed fundamental concepts for liquid-fueled rockets that continue to be used in space vehicles today...|$|R
5000|$|On {{this day}} I <b>climbed</b> a tall <b>cherry</b> tree {{at the back}} of the barn … and as I looked toward the fields at the east, I {{imagined}} how wonderful it would be to make some device which had even the possibility of ascending to Mars, and how it would look on a small scale, if sent up from the meadow at my feet. I have several photographs of the tree, taken since, with the little ladder I made to climb it, leaning against it.It seemed to me then that a weight whirling around a horizontal shaft, moving more rapidly above than below, could furnish lift by virtue of the greater centrifugal force at the top of the path.I was a different boy when I descended the tree from when I ascended. Existence at last seemed very purposive.|$|R
40|$|It is the {{scientists}} who have thought hardest and best about the realities of Mars [...] But there are artists in here too, and writers, and poets, and people whose dreams take no such articulated form, but still focus themselves on the same rock in the sky. They illuminate Mars; Mars illuminates them. ”-Oliver Morton, Mapping Mars Mars has long attracted our gaze and our imagination. This fascination has been well documented, {{but there are a}} few stories that stand out for me. I read of Robert Goddard, <b>climbing</b> a <b>cherry</b> tree as teenager in Massachusetts in the 1890 s and imagining a voyage to Mars. He learned to keep this dream to himself, but he did go on to pioneer the use of liquid-fueled rockets. In his audio reading of The Martian Chronicles, Ray Bradbury recounts how he stretched out his arms in 1930 s Illinois and tried to will himself to Mars. In Cosmos, Carl Sagan tells how he attempted to repeat this experiment in 1940 s New York. I found myself wondering if the young people in school today still have Martian dreams. In the closing minutes of class one day last February, I read to them a passage from Michael Benson’s Beyond about the images sent back by our interplanetary probes: Sifting through a self-congratulatory final press release archived at the Mars Pathfinder site, I was suddenly, unexpectedly, moved. Contact with the lander was lost, it said, in early October o...|$|R
60|$|May 21.--Early {{this morning}} we {{proceeded}} upwards, our prospect more gloomy than ever. The path, which still lay up steep ridges, was very slippery, owing to the rain upon the clayey soil, and was only passable from the hold afforded by interlacing roots of trees. At 8000 feet, some enormous detached masses of micaceous gneiss rose abruptly from the ridge, they were covered with mosses and ferns, and from their summit, 7000 feet, {{a good view of}} the surrounding vegetation is obtained. The mast of the forest is formed of:-- (1) Three species of oak, of which Q. annulata ? with immense lamellated acorns, and leaves sixteen inches long, is the tallest and the most abundant.--(2) Chesnut.--(3) Laurineae of several species, all beautiful forest-trees, straight-holed, and umbrageous above.--(4) Magnolias.* [Other trees were Pyrus, Saurauja (both an erect and <b>climbing</b> species), Olea, <b>cherry,</b> birch, alder, several maples, Hydrangea, one species of fig, holly, and several Araliaceous trees. Many species of Magnoliaceae (including the genera Magnolia, Michelia, and Talauma) are found in Sikkim: Magnolia Campbellii, of 10,000 feet, is the most superb species known. In books on botanical geography, the magnolias are considered as most abounding in North America, east of the Rocky Mountains; but this is a great mistake, the Indian mountains and islands being the centre of this natural order.]--(5) Arborescent rhododendrons, which commence here with the R. arboreum. At 8000 and 9000 feet, a considerable change is found in the vegetation; the gigantic purple Magnolia Campbellii replacing the white; chesnut disappears, and several laurels: other kinds of maple are seen, with Rhododendron argenteum, and Stauntonia, a handsome climber, which has beautiful pendent clusters of lilac blossoms.|$|R
