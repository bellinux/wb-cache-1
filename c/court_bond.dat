The AECOM Building currently stands as the 29th-tallest building in the city, tied in rank with the Ohio Savings Plaza and Ameritech Center.

5000|$|In 1900, Kirby {{founded a}} surety bond company {{to provide the}} <b>court</b> <b>bonds</b> he and other lawyers needed in {{connection}} with the practice of law. The only source of those bonds was a handful of companies on the East Coast and they couldn't provide fast service. He learned about the surety business from fellow passengers on a train while back east attending a hearing at the U.S. Supreme Court. Western Surety Company went on to become an important business in the state and a national leader in the area of small fidelity and surety bonds.|$|R

40|$|In a {{city that}} is notorious for {{political}} corruption and consistent street crime, Chicago’s worst offender is the Cook County Central <b>Bond</b> <b>Court.</b> Aside from the financial burden that it places on taxpayers, the more serious problem is the inefficiencies in the system resulting in morally questionable treatment of defendants. Using research conducted by The Chicago Reader and the Justice Advisory Council of Cook County as well as my own personal observations of the <b>Bond</b> <b>Court,</b> I argue that the Central <b>Bond</b> <b>Court</b> is doing an injustice to both tax payers of Cook County and the accused. Because of these inefficiencies, defendants are not adequately represented as they would be in other bond courts; with only one courtroom in use, each defendant is allowed only 40 seconds in front of a judge. This alone, regardless of the deplorable conditions of the jail, is certainly a cause for moral concern. In this essay I will discuss the concerns with these inefficiencies and the overall impact they have to society through a philosophical analysis...|$|R
