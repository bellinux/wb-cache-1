40|$|Different {{strategies}} to produce thermoplastic materials using starch and zein were studied, aiming to investigate {{their effect on}} the compatibility of starch and zein. Research strategies comprised the use of two different plasticizers for starch, two different compatibilizing agents, and two blending procedures. The plasticizers were mixtures of sorbitol and glycerol (SG) or urea and formamide (UF). UF and maleated starch (MS) were used as compatibilizing agents. The blending procedures included: (1) thermoextruding starch and zein as premixed powder materials (TP[Mix]) and (2) <b>coextruding</b> the biopolymers previously thermoplasticized with suitable plasticizers. As observed by the tensile tests, scanning electronic microscopy, and dynamic mechanical analysis, segregation of phases occurred at different extents in all the starch–zein blends. Materials made with MS through the TP[Mix] procedure presented the most severe phases segregation, while the materials made with UF showed higher compatibility between starch and zein. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) suggests that increased zein content leads to a lower molecular order, which was ascribed to diminished molecular entanglement. Thermogravimetric analysis and FTIR analysis showed that the chemical interaction between starch and zein occurred more extensively in slabs made with UF than those made with MS. In addition, foamability was evaluated for the selected materials using supercritical CO 2. Neat thermoplasticized starch plasticized with UF and themoplasticized zein with polyethylene-glycol 400 showed good suitability to be foamed, producing foams with porosities above 85 %. Starch plasticized with SG and starch–zein blends yielded compact structures with low porosity values after foaming...|$|R

40|$|<b>Coextruded</b> {{products}} for the medical device industry, involving layers of filled and unfilled polymers, are difficult to fabricate, especially due to the various degradative processes {{taking place in the}} absence of stabilizers. Significant differences in the degradation behavior and the subsequent rheological behavior of unfilled and BaSO 4 filled TPUs generally give rise to severe fluctuations at the interfaces and poor <b>coextruded</b> products.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{effect of}} {{coextrusion}} on the microstructure of polypropylene (PP) and low-density polyethylene (LDPE) bilayer films was {{investigated by the}} use of Raman spectroscopy. The onset crystallization-time difference for PP versus LDPE components is an important parameter that controls the orientation and morphology of the <b>coextruded</b> films. Although the overall molecular orientation of PP and LDPE was not significantly different in multi-layer films, single-layer LDPE films displayed some row-nucleation of crystals that was not observed in the LDPE layer in <b>coextruded</b> films. Also, there was a slight decrease of crystalline a-axis orientation for <b>coextruded</b> LDPE layer relative to that obtained for single-layer LDPE films...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} light stabilizer’s {{addition}} method into wood-plastic composites (WPCs), i. e., surface versus bulk, on their photostability was evaluated. Blends of ultraviolet absorbers (benzotriazole or hydroxyphenyl-triazine) with a hindered amine light stabilizer {{were used as}} the stabilizing additives. Both unstabilized and photostabilized uncapped (control) samples, as well as <b>coextruded</b> WPCs counterparts, were exposed to up to 3000 h of accelerated artificial weathering. The light transmittance, surface morphology, and color of the samples before and after weathering were analyzed by UV-vis spectroscopy, SEM, and Chroma Meter. The experimental {{results indicated that the}} method of add-ing the light stabilizer had a significant effect on the WPC photostability. While bulk addition reduced the degree of fading in uncapped composite, it did not suppress it completely. On the other hand, <b>coextruded</b> WPCs with photostabilized cap layers showed no visi-ble signs of fading, thus clearly indicating that the sta-bilized cap layers blocked most of the UV radiation, and thereby prevent of UV light to reach the surface of the inner layer of <b>coextruded</b> composites. Cost-analysis considerations indicated that 50 times more light stabilizer was needed when it was incorporated into the bulk of the composites rather than in the cap layer of <b>coextruded</b> samples. Clearly, these results suggest that adding light stabilizers at the surface of WPCs not only protects them against UV degradation, but also is a most efficient and cost-effective method of photostabilization than bulk addition.

40|$|In recent years, we have {{investigated}} gas-transport phenomena in <b>coextruded</b> linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) membranes. For the most part, <b>coextruded</b> LLDPE membranes were investigated {{because of their}} excellent mechanical properties, which explain their extensive use in the packaging industry. Because of the small thickness of <b>coextruded</b> LLDPE membranes, significant errors can {{be involved in the}} determination of the diffusion coefficient of gases in the membranes by the time-lag method. To obtain more precise transport parameters for LLDPE membranes, we determined the permeability and diffusion coefficients for O- 2, CO 2, He, and N- 2 from 298 to 348 K by employing an alternative method recently developed. The results indicate that the procedure used in this study for determining the diffusivity of gases in membranes was precise and more efficient than a method based on the evaluation of the time-lag parameter. With respect to permeability, the coefficients obtained in this work agree satisfactorily with those obtained by the time-lag method. In general, the permeability and diffusivity results are in satisfactory agreement with the literature values reported for semicrystalline polyethylene membranes...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the effect coextruding a clear HDPE cap layer onto HDPE/wood-flour composites has on the discoloration of <b>coextruded</b> composites exposed to accelerated UV tests. Chroma meter, XPS, SEM, and UV vis measurements accounted {{for the analysis of}} discoloration and degree of oxidation of both uncapped (control) and <b>coextruded</b> composites before and after UV exposures. Two separate discoloration characteristics occurred in the discoloration of composites. For uncapped WPCs (control), chemical changes due to photooxidation resulted in darkening followed by physical changes, including loss of colored wood components from the surface, as well as increased roughness on the surface, which led to lightening of WPCs. By contrast, because a hydrophobic cap layer prevented the loss of colored components from the surface, coextruding a clear hydrophobic HDPE cap layer over WPCs significantly decreased the discoloration during the weathering process. Photooxidation of wood components at the interface accounted for the discoloration of <b>coextruded</b> WPCs before the failure of cap layer. Moreover, as the cap layer absorbed a specified amount of UV light and reduced oxygen available to interface, it decreased the photooxidation rate at the interface compared to that at the WPCs surface. ...|$|E
40|$|Beginning in the mid- 1960 s, {{increasing}} {{energy costs}} in Finland and Sweden made energy recovery more {{critical to the}} cost-effective operation of a kraft pulp mill. Boiler designers responded to this need by raising the steam operating pressure, but almost immediately the wall tubes in these new boilers began to corrode rapidly. Test panels installed in {{the walls of the}} most severely corroding boiler identified austenitic stainless steel as sufficiently resistant to the new corrosive conditions, and discussions with Sandvik AB, a Swedish tube manufacturer, led to the suggestion that <b>coextruded</b> tubes be used for water wall service in kraft recovery boilers. Replacement of carbon steel by <b>coextruded</b> tubes has solved most of the corrosion problems experienced by carbon steel wall tubes, however, these tubes have not been problem-free. Beginning in early 1995, a multidisciplinary research program funded by the US Department of Energy was established to investigate the cause of cracking in <b>coextruded</b> tubes and to develop improved materials for use in water walls and floors of kraft recovery boilers.

The fire retardancy of <b>coextruded</b> wood-plastic {{composites}} (WPCs) containing melamine, ammonium polyphosphate (APP), natural graphite, expandable graphite {{and carbon}} nanotubes (CNTs) {{in the shell}} layer was characterized with a cone calorimeter test. A <b>coextruded</b> composite manufactured without any fire retardant (FR) in the shell layer {{was used as a}} reference. The incorporation of different combinations of FRs in the shell layers of WPCs reduced the peak heat release rate by 3 - 43 %, depending on the FR combination. Other studied parameters, such as ignition time, total heat release and mass loss rate were improved after FR systems loading. The best improvement of flammability characteristics was observed with melamine/natural graphite combinations, whereas the melamine/expandable graphite system resulted only in slight improvement of the studied parameters. However, {{it should be noted that}} the amount of expandable graphite loading was 2 - 4 times lower than the amount of natural graphite loadings.

The aim of this work was to study the effectiveness of different plastic films in reducing the top losses in maize silage. The following treatments were evaluated: (i) <b>coextruded</b> polyethylene/polyamide oxygen barrier film (OB), (ii) polyethylene film (PE), (iii) polyvinyl chloride film (PVC), and (iv) <b>coextruded</b> PE/polyvinyl alcohol film (PVOH). These treatments differed according to oxygen permeability with values of 75, 722, 982 and 289 cm(3) m(- 2) per 24 hour respectively. OB and PVOH films had better temperature and fermentation profiles than the more permeable films. The OB film was effective in reducing the dry-matter (DM) losses during storage (82 g kg(- 1)), and the PVOH film had an intermediate value of DM loss (101 g kg(- 1)). PE and PVC films had higher losses (138 and 145 g kg(- 1) respectively). Oxygen permeability of the films promoted a positive correlation with DM losses (P < 0. 05; r 2 = 0. 945). The results indicate that O 2 permeability through the plastic film is a crucial factor for maintaining silage quality in the upper layer of the silo when it is perfectly sealed.
