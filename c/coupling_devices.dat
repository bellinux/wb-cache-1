25|$|As {{part of a}} {{restructuring}} of the company Alfons Håkans converted two tugboats to become pushers and established a charter contract with Rautaruukki Oyj. In 1991 Herakles was refitted with a new bridge and <b>coupling</b> <b>devices</b> by Oy Laivateollisuus Ab in Turku, the same shipyard where she was originally built, and became the third pusher for the Finnish integrated tug barge system, Finnpusku, {{which is used to}} transport raw materials to the steel mills of Rautaruukki Oyj.|$|E
25|$|Integrated tug barge {{systems are}} {{generally}} {{divided into three}} generations {{by the type of}} coupling. In the first generation systems the tug is connected to the barge by wires or chains. However, because the two vessels are subject to different motion responses due to their shape, displacement and position on a wave, such operation is only possible in calm sea conditions — in rough weather the tug has to disconnect from the barge and continue the journey by towing it in a traditional way. The second generation systems are designed with a deeper stern notch and improved <b>coupling</b> <b>devices</b> to allow operation in heavier seas while still permitting relative motion between the two vessels. The third generation systems such as the Finnpusku system, equipped with rigid or articulated mechanical coupling, allow operation in all sea states and even in ice conditions as the pusher-barge combination behaves hydrodynamically like a conventional ship. However, in some cases the specialized hull form of the pusher, designed to form a streamlined hull when coupled to the barge, might lead to problems with stability and seakeeping when the pusher is operated independently.|$|E

This <b>coupling</b> <b>device</b> connects the buffer system and the flexible pipe. The motion of the buffer system, flexible pipe and mining robot {{are affected by the}} <b>coupling</b> <b>device.</b> So the <b>coupling</b> <b>device</b> should be considered as a major factor when this device is designed. Therefore, we find a stable kinematic device, and apply it to the design <b>coupling</b> <b>device</b> through this study. The kinematic characteristics of the <b>coupling</b> <b>device</b> are analyzed by multi-body dynamics simulation method, and finite element method. The dynamic analysis model was built in the commercial software DAFUL. The Fluid Structure Interaction (FSI) method is applied to build the deep-seabed environment. Hydrodynamic force and moment are applied in the dynamic model for the FSI method. The loads and deformation of flexible pipe are estimated for analysis results of the kinematic characteristics...|$|R

In order to do this a new type of steering system with a <b>coupling</b> <b>device</b> is designed and a closed-loop control strategy based on speed is adopted to improve the lateral stability of the vehicle. The work done entails modeling and simulating the 2 MDTV and the proposed control strategy in RecurDyn and Matlab/Simulink.

40|$|Solid-phase extraction-pipette tips {{were used}} for micro {{solid-phase}} extraction of lidocaine and diazepam. Off-line desorption was done after in-vial collection for reference purposes, whereas with on-line desorption the eluate was directly introduced in the gas chromatograph. With both methods the total eluate (100 mu l) was introduced into the GC system, which was equipped with a programmed-temperature vaporiser (PTV) for large volume injection. For on-line desorption a laboratory-made <b>coupling</b> <b>device</b> was developed to connect the pipette tips with the injector of the PTV. The <b>coupling</b> <b>device</b> was applied successfully since no leakage occurred at the connection of the <b>coupling</b> <b>device</b> and the pipette tip. No significant differences in recovery of lidocaine and diazepam and in presence of impurities were observed between chromatograms obtained with either off-line or on-line desorption. Preliminary experiments with standard solutions showed recoveries of about 75 % for a concentration level of 1 mu g/ml. The system seems particularly suitable for high-throughput analysis.
