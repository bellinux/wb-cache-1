5|$|None of the {{original}} engines survived into preservation, however {{progress is being made}} by a Registered Charity (No. 1062320), the Standard Steam Locomotive Company, on constructing a new locomotive {{that would have been the}} first of the uncompleted batch of 15, number 72010 Hengist. As 999 BR standard steam locomotives were built in the years up to 1960 the builders consider this is the 1000th locomotive build to be commenced to a British Railways standard design. The Standard Steam Locomotive Company believes that significant costs will be avoided as many of the required <b>cast</b> <b>parts</b> can be made from patterns held by fellow members of the British Railways Standard Locomotive Owners Group (BRSLOG).|$|E
25|$|Aluminum media: Aluminium {{media are}} {{typically}} <b>cast</b> <b>parts</b> {{and are available}} {{in a wide variety}} of shapes and sizes. Aluminum scrubs parts and can work in conjunction with cleaning compounds to clean parts. Since aluminum is fairly nonabrasive it tends to remove surface impurities without affecting the part's surface qualities. Its cost is typically higher than other cast media. Wear rates are lower than ceramic but higher than steel media.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to the largest bore and stroke, the [...] AMX 390 motor also received heavier main bearing support webbing and a forged steel crankshaft and connecting rods. Forged cranks and rods were used for their known strength—there was inadequate time for testing <b>cast</b> <b>parts</b> for durability without delaying AMC's introduction schedule. Once forging dies were made it was not cost effective to test <b>cast</b> <b>parts</b> due to the relatively low number of engines produced. The use of these stronger components was also continued with the production of 401 engines.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a comparative analysis between the practical results of pig iron die-type <b>part</b> <b>casting</b> {{and the results}} reached by simulation. The insert was made of polystyrene, and the casting was downward vertical. As after the <b>part</b> <b>casting</b> and heat treatment cracks were observed in the part, it became necessary to locate and identify these fissures and to establish some measures for eliminating the casting defects and for locating them. The research method was the comparisons of defects identified through verifications, measurements, and metallographic analyses applied to the <b>cast</b> <b>part</b> {{with the results of}} some criteria specific to simulation after simulating the casting process. In order to verify the compatibility between reality and simulation, we then simulated the <b>part</b> <b>casting</b> respecting the real conditions in which it was cast. By visualising certain sections of the <b>cast</b> <b>part</b> during solidification, relevant details occur about the possible evolution of defects.

40|$|The {{formation}} of oxide {{film on the}} surface of aluminium melts, i. e. bifilms, are known to be detrimental when they are incorporated into the <b>cast</b> <b>part.</b> These defects causes premature fractures under stress, or aid porosity formation. In this work, Al- 12 Si alloy was used to cast a step mould under two conditions: as-received and degassed. In addition, 10 ppi filters were used in the mould in order to prevent bifilm intrusion into the <b>cast</b> <b>part.</b> Reduced pressure test samples were collected for bifilm index measurements.

40|$|The complex {{motorcycle}} wheel {{components of}} AM 50 A magnesium alloy had been formed by double control forming and die casting, respectively. The surface quality of components formed by double control forming {{was much better}} than die <b>casting</b> <b>parts.</b> When double control forming was used to replace die casting to form motorcycle wheel components, the tensile strength increased from 149. 4 MPa to 207. 0 MPa and the elongation increased from 5. 6 % to 10 %. The fracture mode was transformed from brittle one of die <b>casting</b> <b>parts</b> to ductile one of double control forming parts. The average grain sizes in the spoke region and the hub region of double control forming wheels were 16 μm and 20 μm, respectively, which were smaller than those of die casting components. The matrix phase of the spoke part was α-Mg, the second phase was Mg 17 Al 12. A fishbone morphology of {{the second phase of}} die <b>casting</b> <b>parts</b> was found in the grain boundaries.
