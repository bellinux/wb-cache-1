60|$|It was a {{depressing}} afternoon when Carsluith Maxwell found Dane lounging in the smoking-room of a London hotel. The air outside was foul with smoke and fog; {{and it was}} little more cheerful within. Dane was in distinctly low spirits. He had spent a fortnight haunting the offices of engineering firms, financiers, and company promoters, and had discovered once more that anybody willing to take up his invention would require the lion's share of the <b>contingent</b> <b>profit.</b> He could hear of no remunerative professional engagement; and the contractors who had promised him the foreign commission stated that the work would not be begun for some time.|$|E
50|$|It is {{a complex}} of {{autonomous}} private activities realized by different types of organizations that have the aim to serve their members or local community first of all by doing business. The social economy is oriented on solving issues of unemployment, social coherence and local development. It is created and developed {{on the base of}} concept of triple bottom line - economic, social and environmental benefits. Social economy enables citizens to get involved actively in the regional development. Making profit/surplus is desirable, however is not a primary goal. <b>Contingent</b> <b>profit</b> is used in preference for development of activities of organization and for the needs of local community. Internal relations in the social enterprises are headed to the maximum involvement of members/employees in decision-making and self-management while external relations strengthen social capital. Legal form of social economy entities is not decisive - what is crucial is observing public benefit aims as listed in the articles. Subjects of the social economy are social enterprises and organizations supporting their work in the areas of education, consulting and financing.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the feasibility}} of profit and loss sharing (PLS) contracts in presence of moral hazard between the principal (financier) and the agent (entrepreneur). It shows that introducing a rule for sharing profits and losses in contingence with {{the outcome of the}} entrepreneur’s project enlarges the feasibility region of the PLS contracts by enabling more entrepreneurs to access external financing. More specifically, in the <b>contingent</b> <b>profit</b> and loss sharing contract (C-PLS) losses are shared according to the capital participation of each party. But, in case of success, the entrepreneur receives a higher share of the profit which is endogenously determined according to the opportunity cost of capital of the financier (risk-free rate of return) and the characteristics of the project. It is also interestingly shown that having two subsequent C-PLS contracts where the second-period expected profit of the entrepreneur is positively correlated to the first-period probability of success, has an even more incentive effect when the entrepreneur is sufficiently fore-sighted {{and the size of the}} project inferior to a determined threshold. Finally, the developed framework sets the rationale for a list of policy recommendations to enhance the use of the C-PLS contracts. ...|$|E
60|$|Also it must {{be remembered}} that {{it is one thing to}} talk of {{restoring}} Cetywayo, and another to carry his restoration into effect. It would not simply be a question of turning him down on the borders of Zululand, and letting him find his own way back to his throne, for such a proceeding would be the signal for the outbreak of civil war. It is not to be supposed that John Dunn, and those whose interests are identical with Dunn's, would allow the ex-king to reseat himself on the throne without a struggle; indeed the former has openly declared his intention of resisting the attempt by force of arms if necessary. He is by no means anxious to give up the 15,000 pounds a year his hut-tax brings in, and all the <b>contingent</b> <b>profits</b> and advantages of his chieftainship. If we wish to restore Cetywayo we must first depose Dunn; in fact, we must be ready to support his restoration by force of arms.|$|R

The sale price was $110 million, with an {{additional}} $60 million <b>contingent</b> on Calma's <b>profits</b> {{over the next five}} years. The acquisition was completed on April 1, 1981.

50|$|Undaunted, Parretti bought Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1990 for $1.2 billion, using money {{borrowed}} from a Dutch subsidiary of Crédit Lyonnais and <b>contingent</b> on future <b>profits</b> financing the purchase from mogul Kirk Kerkorian. Parretti then merged the former Cannon with the MGM purchase {{to create the}} short-lived MGM-Pathé Communications.|$|R
25|$|In Lamparello v. Falwell, {{however, the}} court {{clarified}} that {{a finding of}} initial interest confusion is <b>contingent</b> on financial <b>profit</b> from said confusion, such that, if a domain name confusingly similar to a registered trademark is used for a non-trademark related website, the site owner will not be found to have infringed where they do not seek {{to capitalize on the}} mark's goodwill for their own commercial enterprises.|$|R
40|$|What are the {{consequences}} of laws imposing profit-sharing rates in the compensation {{of all forms of}} labor, when only a limited share of the productive sector is really making profit ? This problem is examined in the case of competitive labor markets, when firms of the profitable sector are facing a predetermined participation constraint. The proposed model details how legal profit-sharing contracts offer a form of evasion from wage-based social contributions in permitting substitution of wages with <b>contingent</b> claims on <b>profits.</b> Labor contracts are examined in a context in which effort is monitored or in which free-riding effects thwart the incentive effects of profit-sharing.

40|$|Recently, it {{has been}} argued that {{contemporary}} conditions facilitating the growth of profit sharing and employee share ownership schemes represent a fundamental break with the past. The contemporary combination of government, employer and union support for profit sharing schemes amounts, {{it has been}} suggested, to a series of ‘favourable conjunctures’. These conjunctures are viewed as constituting a break with the previous cyclical pattern. Given Irish government, employer and trade union support for profit sharing, Ireland appears as an excellent exemplar of ‘favourable conjunctures’. Using the Irish example, the authors test a number of hypotheses including the favourable conjunctures thesis to explain the trend in profit sharing schemes. Although there was a dramatic increase in the adoption of profit sharing/employee shareholding schemes during the 1990 s, this subsequently declined. The Irish case suggests that the cyclical and <b>contingent</b> nature of <b>profit</b> sharing appears likely to persist...|$|R
40|$|How do markets {{spread risk}} when events are unknown or unknowable and where not {{anticipated}} in an insurance contract? While the policyholder can "hold up" the insurer for extra contractual payments, the continuing gains from trade {{on a single}} contract are often too small to yield useful coverage. By acting as a repository of the reputations of the parties, we show the brokers provide a coordinating mechanism to leverage the collective hold up power of policyholders. This extends both the degree of implicit and explicit coverage. The role {{is reflected in the}} terms of broker engagement, specifically in the ownership by the broker of the renewal rights. Finally, we argue that brokers can be motivated to play this role when they receive commissions that are <b>contingent</b> on insurer <b>profits.</b> This last feature questions a recent, well publicized, attack on broker compensation by New York attorney general, Elliot Spitzer.
