500|$|The term [...] "Munchausen by Internet" [...] {{was first}} used in an article {{published}} in the Southern Medical Journal written by Marc Feldman in 2000. Feldman, a <b>clinical</b> <b>professor</b> <b>of</b> psychiatry at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, gave a name to the phenomenon in 2000, but he co-authored an article on the topic two years earlier in the Western Journal of Medicine, using the description [...] "virtual factitious disorder". Factitious disorders are described in the [...] (DSM) as psychological disorders involving the production of non-existent physical or psychological ailments to earn sympathy. These illnesses are feigned not for monetary gain or to avoid inconvenient situations, but to attract compassion or to control others. Chronic manifestation of factitious disorder is often called Munchausen syndrome, after a book about the exaggerated accounts of the adventures of Baron Munchausen, a German cavalry officer in the Russian Army, that was written by Rudolf Erich Raspe. When the symptoms of another person, such as a child or an elderly parent, are purposely induced by the caregiver, it is called factitious disorder by proxy, or Munchausen syndrome by proxy.|$|E

At times the theory has been reversed and it has instead been non-falsifiably claimed that cases of pregnancy distinguish [...] "real" [...] rape from other acts.
