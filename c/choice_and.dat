40|$|In {{experimental}} games, task-related {{incentives are}} payments to experimental subjects that {{vary according to}} their strategy <b>choices</b> <b>and</b> the consequent outcomes of the games. Limited evidence exists regarding incentive magnitude effects in experimental games. We examined one-off strategy <b>choices</b> <b>and</b> self-reported reasons for choices in eight 3 × 3 and four 4 × 4 normal-form games under task-related incentives of conventional magnitude and compared them with <b>choices</b> <b>and</b> reasons in the same games under incentives five times as large. Both strategy <b>choices</b> <b>and</b> self-reported reasons for choices were almost indistinguishable between the two conditions. These results {{are in line with}} earlier findings on individual decision making and with a parametric model, in which the incentive elasticity of effort is very small when compared with other factors, such as the complexity of the decision problem...|$|R

40|$|We study {{experimentally}} {{the nature}} of dominance violations in three minimalist dominancesolvable guessing games. We examine how subjects’ reported reasoning processes translate into their stated <b>choices</b> <b>and</b> beliefs about others’ <b>choices,</b> <b>and</b> how both reasoning processes <b>and</b> <b>choices</b> relate to their measured cognitive and personality characteristics. Only {{about a third of}} subjects reason in line with dominance; they all make dominant <b>choices</b> <b>and</b> almost all expect others to do so. By contrast, nearly two-thirds of subjects reason inconsistently with dominance, yet a quarter of them actually make dominant <b>choices</b> <b>and</b> half of those expect others to do so. Reasoning errors are more likely for subjects with lower ability to maintain and allocate attention, as measured by working memory, and for subjects with lower intrinsic motivation and premeditation attitude. Dominance-incompatible reasoning arises mainly from subjects misrepresenting the strategic nature (payoff structure) of the guessing games.

Following a coin flip, Toronto was given first <b>choice</b> <b>and</b> selected Chicago Bulls point guard and three-point specialist B. J. Armstrong. Armstrong refused to report for training, and Thomas promptly traded him to the Golden State Warriors for power forwards Carlos Rogers and Victor Alexander.
