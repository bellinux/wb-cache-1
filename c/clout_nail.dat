The sheathings used were 3. 8 mm, Hydroline, 4. 8 mm Hydroline, and 5. 5 mm special formula Fineline. The framing used in each test was 90 x 45 mm, F 8 Radiata pine. Stud centres were 600 mm, and the nails 2. 8 mm diameter x 40 mm long galvanised <b>clouts,</b> and the <b>nail</b> centres 150 mm on edges and 300 mm centres on interval studs. All tests were of short duration and conducted under laboratory {{conditions in the}} Heavy Structures Laboratory, Department of Civil Engineering, CIAE. " [...] P. (i...|$|R
