40|$|Collaboration scripts are a {{powerful}} means to improve <b>collaborative</b> inquiry <b>learning.</b> More specifically, {{they can be}} designed to support argumentative knowledge construction, a core activity in inquiry learning. However, not only externally induced collaboration scripts but also the learners' internal scripts on collaborative argumentative knowledge construction influence the way they argue with scientific concepts and evidence, thereby affecting what kind of knowledge is acquired during collaboration. In this study, 98 students (49 dyads) from two German secondary schools participated. We implemented two versions (high vs. low structured) of an external collaboration script designed to support argumentative knowledge construction into a web-based <b>collaborative</b> inquiry <b>learning</b> environment called WISE. Further, we classified the learners' internal scripts as either high or low structured and composed homogeneous dyads, thereby establishing a 2 x 2 -factorial design. We investigated how external and internal scripts {{as well as their}} interaction influenced the acquisition of both domain-general and domain-specific knowledge. Results suggest that for the acquisition of domain-general knowledge, web-based <b>collaborative</b> inquiry <b>learning</b> environments can be improved by implementing a high structured external script. For the acquisition of domainspecific content knowledge, however, the learners' internal scripts on collaborative argumentative knowledge construction appeared to be more influential.

40|$|In this thesis, {{we study}} <b>Collaborative</b> Reinforcement <b>Learning</b> (CRL) {{in the context}} of Information Retrieval in {{unstructured}} distributed systems. <b>Collaborative</b> reinforcement <b>learning</b> is an extension to reinforcement learning to support multiple agents that both share value functions and cooperate to solve tasks. Specifically, we propose and develop an algorithm for searching in peer to peer systems by using <b>collaborative</b> reinforcement <b>learning.</b> We present a search technique that achieve higher performance than currently available techniques, but is straightforward and practical enough to be easily incorporated into existing systems. Theapproach is profitable because reinforcement learning methods search for good behaviors gradually during the lifetime of the learning peer. However, we must overcome the challenges due to the fundamental partial observability inherent in distributed systems which have highly dynamic nature and changes in their configuration are common practice. Also, we undertake a performance study of the effects that some environment parameters, such as the number of peers, network traffic bandwidth, and partial behavioral knowledge from previous experience, have on the speed and reliability of learning. In the process, we show how CRL can be used to establish and maintain autonomic properties of decentralized distributed systems. This thesis is an empirical study of <b>collaborative</b> reinforcement <b>learning.</b> However, our results contribute to the broader understanding of learning strategies and design of different search policies in distributed systems.

Results of changes implemented at the provider level on access and retention are outlined.

Key lessons include: creating a clear plan and shared vision, recognizing that one size does not fit all, using data can help fuel participant engagement, a long collaborative may benefit from breaking it into smaller segments, and paying providers to offset costs of participation enhances their engagement.
