5|$|William Monahan's screenplay, {{based on}} the novel of the same name by David Ignatius, {{examines}} contemporary tension between Western and Arab societies and the <b>comparative</b> <b>effectiveness</b> of technological and human counter-intelligence methods. The film was shot largely on location in the United States and Morocco, after authorities in Dubai refused permission to film there because of the script's political themes. The film's photography sought to emphasize the contrast between the gold and dust of the desert and Arab cities, and the blue and gray of bureaucracy and Washington. Accordingly, they used natural light wherever possible. Marc Streitenfeld arranged the musical score.|$|E

The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the <b>comparative</b> treatment <b>effectiveness</b> and safety between tissue and non-tissue ACE inhibitors among elderly patients after AMI. This is a retrospective cohort study with intention to treatment design using Medicare service claims files from 2007 to 2009 with Medicare beneficiaries 65 years or older after the index AMI hospitalization and who survived to discharge between January 1 2008 to December 31 2008 and received ACE inhibitors (N= 34, 679).

Both the risk adjustment and IV analyses showed no significant differences between tissue and non-tissue ACE inhibitors for the investigated outcomes of the <b>comparative</b> treatment <b>effectiveness</b> and safety in the study cohort.

40|$|AbstractAll {{patients}} with stable {{ischemic heart disease}} (SIHD) should be managed with guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT), which reduces progression of atherosclerosis and prevents coronary thrombosis. Revascularization is also indicated in {{patients with}} SIHD and progressive or refractory symptoms, despite medical management. Whether a strategy of routine revascularization (with percutaneous coronary intervention or {{coronary artery bypass graft}} surgery as appropriate) plus GDMT reduces rates of death or myocardial infarction, or improves quality of life compared to an initial approach of GDMT alone in patients with substantial ischemia is uncertain. Opinions run strongly on both sides, and evidence may be used to support either approach. Careful review of the data demonstrates the limitations of our current knowledge, resulting in a state of community equipoise. The ongoing ISCHEMIA trial (International Study of <b>Comparative</b> Health <b>Effectiveness</b> With Medical and Invasive Approaches) is being performed to determine the optimal approach to managing patients with SIHD, moderate-to-severe ischemia, and symptoms that can be controlled medically.

40|$|The lucrative {{world of}} {{comparative}} advertising has been attractive to marketers, who seek economic types of persuasive communication. Nevertheless, {{research in the}} actual <b>effectiveness</b> of <b>comparative</b> advertising has been inconclusive, contradicting, and insufficient. The increasing importance of comparative advertising in the current competitive global environment requires immediate findings about how comparative advertising can work effectively. This study is the first study to develop an integrated conceptual model of the factors, which influence <b>comparative</b> advertising <b>effectiveness.</b> Particularly, the conceptual model comprehensively indicates that two advertising features (namely, intensity of comparative claims, and source attractiveness) and five characteristics of the ad recipients (namely, NFC, product involvement, gender, familiarity with comparative advertising, and culture) determine the <b>effectiveness</b> of a <b>comparative</b> ad. The study adopts a critical-realist approach and a multi-method design to explore the research topic. The research questions are addressed using qualitative and quantitative data in a cross-cultural approach. Two phases of exploratory interviews conducted in Greece {{and a series of}} pilot tests conducted in the UK and Greece inform an extensive experimental study of 820 participants to explore the research questions and test all research hypotheses. The research findings empirically validate the conceptual model of the study in both countries. It is largely confirmed that the above mentioned factors influence claim believability and perceptions of manipulation intent in comparative advertising. Further persuasion effects are also examined. The results of the study contribute to knowledge about <b>comparative</b> advertising <b>effectiveness</b> and provide information and guidance to practitioners on how to develop and implement effective comparative ads. Overall, comparative advertising is a powerful marketing tool, which has to be applied with caution as there are factors which can {{have a negative impact on}} <b>comparative</b> advertising <b>effectiveness.</b> The novel findings of this study endow future research with a new avenue to proceed...|$|R
