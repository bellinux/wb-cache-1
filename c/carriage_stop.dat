6000|$|... "Have {{you gone}} to bed, Jean? Some one is {{knocking}} at the door, and a minute ago I thought I heard a <b>carriage</b> <b>stop</b> close by. Perhaps the farmer has driven Mr. Dishart home." ...|$|E
60|$|The event {{showed that}} Mr. George {{was right in}} his calculations. The Hotel d'Amerique was full. The waiter, who came out, {{as soon as he}} saw the <b>carriage</b> <b>stop</b> at the door, told Mr. George this in French.|$|E
6000|$|Behold my lady's <b>carriage</b> <b>stop</b> the way. [...] With {{powdered}} lacquey {{and with}} charming bay; [...] She sweeps the matting, treads the crimson stair. [...] Her arduous function solely [...] "to be there." [...] Like Sirius rising o'er the silent sea. [...] She hides her heart in lustre loftily.|$|E
60|$|Presently {{the road}} became {{smoother}} {{and in a}} few minutes the <b>carriage</b> <b>stopped.</b>|$|R
60|$|At {{that moment}} {{they heard the}} sound of a <b>carriage</b> <b>stopping</b> at the door.|$|R
60|$|They soon {{approached}} the coast near Idmouth. The <b>carriage</b> <b>stopped.</b> Margery awoke from her reverie.|$|R
60|$|He {{was just}} getting into the cab, on his return to London, when a closed carriage, with one person in it, passed him {{on its way to}} Redburn Road. In that person he {{recognised}} Mr. Henley. As the cab-driver mounted to his seat, Hugh saw the <b>carriage</b> <b>stop</b> at Number Five.|$|E
60|$|Night fell--the long night; {{would she}} wake again? Both watched with her, ready at the faintest {{movement}} to administer oxygen and brandy. She was still breathing, but very faintly, when {{at six o'clock}} they heard the express come in, and presently the <b>carriage</b> <b>stop</b> before the house. Mademoiselle stole down to let them in.|$|E
6000|$|At {{the same}} moment, Isabel {{burst into the}} room {{in a state of}} {{excitement}} which actually ignored the formidable presence of Miss Pink. [...] "I beg your pardon, aunt! I was upstairs at the window, and I saw the <b>carriage</b> <b>stop</b> at the gate. And Tommie has come, too! The darling saw me at the window!" [...] cried the poor girl, her eyes sparkling with delight as a perfect explosion of barking made itself heard over the tramp of horses' feet and the crash of carriage wheels outside.|$|E
60|$|And so, {{in a few}} minutes, Lady Bellair's <b>carriage</b> <b>stopped</b> {{opposite}} the house of Miss Grandison.|$|R
60|$|She seemed shy, at once {{very near}} and very remote. I {{held her hand}} awkwardly until the <b>carriage</b> <b>stopped.</b>|$|R
60|$|The <b>carriage</b> <b>stopped</b> {{at one end}} of the Coliseum, {{where there}} was a passage way leading through stupendous arches into the interior.|$|R
60|$|As {{he spoke}} a girl, {{who was sitting}} reading under a tree, leapt to her feet, on hearing a <b>carriage</b> <b>stop,</b> and then, {{catching}} sight of Peter waving his hat, while Tom made frantic efforts to open the door, gave a scream of delight, and rushed towards them, threw her arms round Tom's neck as he jumped out, and then leapt into the chaise and hugged and cried over Peter. He was soon helped out, and as they turned to go towards the house they saw their aunt coming out to meet them.|$|E
60|$|Rollo {{had ordered}} the coachman {{to stop at the}} {{entrance}} to Virgil's Tomb, and the carriage accordingly drew up before a gate which seemed to be set in the solid wall of rock which formed one side of the entrance to the grotto. There was a man standing at this gate, {{and as soon as he}} saw the <b>carriage</b> <b>stop,</b> he unlocked it. They all got out of the carriage, and went in. The way led up a long and narrow, and very steep flight of stone steps, which brought the party out at last into a sort of vineyard, or garden, on the surface of the ground above.|$|E
60|$|The {{moment of}} the meeting between these two warm-hearted and {{sincerely}} attached young women, was one of great interest and anxiety to both. They retained for each other the tenderest love, though the years that had separated them had given rise to so many new impressions and habits {{that they did not}} prepare themselves for the interview without apprehension. This interview took place about a week after Eve was established in Hudson Square, and at an hour earlier than was usual for the reception of visits. Hearing a <b>carriage</b> <b>stop</b> before the door, and the bell ring, our heroine stole a glance from behind a curtain and recognized her cousin as she alighted.|$|E
60|$|At {{the gate}} of Coed {{farmyard}} the <b>carriage</b> <b>stopped,</b> and the old farmer came out {{to say a few}} words to her.|$|R

60|$|He had Mr. Van Astrachan's latch-key; and, {{when the}} <b>carriage</b> <b>stopped,</b> he helped Rose to alight, {{and went up}} {{the steps of the}} house.|$|R
60|$|Captain Asher {{had seen}} the <b>carriage</b> <b>stop,</b> and knew that Mrs. Easterfield was talking to Olive, {{but he did not}} think himself called upon to intrude upon them. But now it was {{necessary}} for him to go to the tollhouse. Two men in a buggy with a broken spring and a coffee bag laid over the loins of an imperfectly set-up horse had been waiting for nearly a minute behind Mrs. Easterfield's carriage, desiring to pay their toll and pass through. So the captain went out of the garden-gate, collected the toll from the two men, and directed them to go round the carriage and pass on in peace, which they did.|$|E
60|$|They had now {{reached the}} promenade, which, {{owing to the}} governor's order that all {{inhabitants}} should keep their houses, was entirely deserted, except by a few Russian officers walking or riding. These all saluted as the general's carriage passed them. On reaching {{the end of the}} drive the coachman was about to turn, when the lads jumped to their feet, and commanded him to stop. The coachman looked round astonished, but at the sight of two pistols pointed at their heads, he and his fellow-servant, with a cry of alarm and astonishment, leaped from the box. Jack in an instant scrambled over and seized the reins. The soldiers had halted upon seeing the <b>carriage</b> <b>stop,</b> and remained stupefied with astonishment as they saw the two servants leap off, and one of the ladies climb into their seat. Nor did they move until the servants, running up hastily, explained what had happened. Then, putting the spurs into their horses, they galloped forward. Dick, who was looking back, saw at the same moment several horsemen at full gallop appear {{at the other end of}} the promenade.|$|E
60|$|It came in, {{louder and}} louder with every gust of wind--the joyous, rapid {{gathering}} roll of wheels. My eyes fastened on her {{as if they could}} see to her heart, while she stood there with her sweet face turned on me all pale and startled. I tried to speak to her; I tried to break away from Owen's arms, to throw my own arms round her, to keep her on my bosom, till he came to take her from me. But all my strength had gone in the long waiting and the long suspense. My head sank on Owen's breast--but I still heard the wheels. Morgan loosened my cravat, and sprinkled water over my face--I still heard the wheels. The poor terrified girl ran into her room, and came back with her smelling-salts--I heard the <b>carriage</b> <b>stop</b> at the house. The room whirled round and round with me; but I heard the eager hurry of footsteps in the hall, and the opening of the door. In another moment my son's voice rose clear and cheerful from below, greeting the old servants who loved him. The dear, familiar tones just poured into my ear, and then, the moment they filled it, hushed me suddenly to rest.|$|E
6000|$|Gaily-dressed people {{surrounded}} the entrance, and, amid triumphant strains from the band, the <b>carriage</b> <b>stopped,</b> and Oliver {{held out his}} hand, saying, 'Welcome home, mother!' ...|$|R
60|$|Two {{or three}} very nicely dressed {{servants}} came {{out when the}} <b>carriage</b> <b>stopped,</b> {{and opened the door}} of it in a very assiduous and deferential manner.|$|R
60|$|Susan, {{drawing in}} her head from the window, thrust it out again, drew it in again as the <b>carriage</b> <b>stopped,</b> {{and stared at her}} {{mistress}} in amazement.|$|R
60|$|But still Selina {{failed to}} come in--even {{to take that}} advantage; yet in {{proportion}} as her waiting was useless did the girl find it impossible to go to bed. A new fear had seized her, the fear {{that she would never}} come back at all--that they were already {{in the presence of the}} dreaded catastrophe. This made her so nervous that she paced about the lower rooms, listening to every sound, roaming till she was tired. She knew it was absurd, the image of Selina taking flight in a ball-dress; but she said to herself that she might very well have sent other clothes away, in advance, somewhere (Laura had her own ripe views about the maid); and at any rate, for herself, that was the fate she had to expect, if not that night then some other one soon, and it was all the same: to sit counting the hours till a hope was given up and a hideous certainty remained. She had fallen into such a state of apprehension that when at last she heard a <b>carriage</b> <b>stop</b> at the door she was almost happy, in spite of her prevision of how disgusted her sister would be to find her. They met in the hall--Laura went out as she heard the opening of the door, Selina stopped short, seeing her, but said nothing--on account apparently of the presence of the sleepy footman. Then she moved straight to the stairs, where she paused again, asking the footman if Mr. Berrington had come in.|$|E

5000|$|Morton was in New York City in July 1868. He {{was riding}} in a {{carriage}} with his wife when he suddenly demanded the <b>carriage</b> <b>stop,</b> and he ran into the lake in Central Park [...] "to cool off". This peculiar behavior was because he had, in fact, suffered a major stroke (cerebrovascular accident) which proved fatal soon after. He is buried at Mount Auburn Cemetery in Watertown and Cambridge, Massachusetts. His son William J. Morton was a noted physician and authority in electrotherapeutics.|$|E
60|$|Bartley slept {{all the way}} to Clover Street, {{and when}} the <b>carriage</b> <b>stopped</b> at his door, they had {{difficulty}} in waking him sufficiently to get him out.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, sir," [...] {{said a man}} who was {{standing}} {{by the side of the}} door when the <b>carriage</b> <b>stopped,</b> and who now came forward. [...] "I speak English." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{thanked him}} with one fleeting, tearful glance {{that was as}} a grant of all her priceless possessions. The <b>carriage</b> <b>stopped,</b> but it was some moments before they {{realized}} it.|$|R
50|$|In 1824, the Marquis de Lafayette {{returned}} to the United States {{at the invitation of}} President James Monroe. He made a tour of all 24 states, in which he was met by huge crowds and everywhere feted as a hero. While in Virginia where he visited Washington's grave and gave a speech to the House of Delegates, he abruptly had his <b>carriage</b> <b>stop</b> when he saw Armistead in the crowd and rushed to embrace him. At around this time, he also wrote a testimonial on Armistead's behalf.|$|E
50|$|Early on, the {{property}} was self-sufficient, with its own power plant, a post office, railroad station, <b>carriage</b> <b>stop,</b> lodgings for 40 ranch hands, and a chapel. The family grew {{fruits and vegetables and}} raised its own livestock. Everis A. Hayes and Jay Hayes went on to help develop the Santa Clara Valley fruit industry and became the publishers of the San Jose Mercury. Three U.S. Presidents visited the mansion during their prominence.The family sold {{the property}} during the 1950s, after which the building remained vacant for some time then became dilapidated. Purchased by the City of San Jose during the 1990s, {{the property was}} renovated and expanded to its present state. The building now contains 33000 ft2 m2 of meeting space and 214 guest rooms and is surrounded by a 20 acre park.|$|E
5000|$|Beebe's Corners, the {{original}} settlement {{in what would}} become the city of Warren, was founded in 1830 at the corner of Mound Road and Chicago Road; its first resident was Charles Groesbeck. [...] Beebe's Corners was a <b>carriage</b> <b>stop</b> between Detroit and Utica, and included a distillery, mill, tavern, and trading post. [...] It was not until 1837 that the now-defunct Warren Township was organized around the settlement, first under the name Hickory, then renamed Aba in April 1838, and finally renamed Warren shortly thereafter. [...] It was named for War of 1812 veteran, and frontier cleric, Rev. Abel Warren. However, when it was originally organized the township was named for Rev. Warren who was a Methodist Episcopal preacher who left his native New York in 1824 for Shelby Township. He went throughout the present-day Macomb, Lapeer, Oakland, and St. Clair Counties, baptizing, marrying, and burying pioneers of the area, as well as establishing congregations and preaching extensively. [...] He was the first licensed preacher in the State of Michigan.|$|E
6000|$|Lothair {{lapsed into}} silence, which {{subsequently}} {{appeared to be}} meditation, for, when the <b>carriage</b> <b>stopped,</b> and the monsignore assisted him to alight, he said, [...] "I must see Lord St. Jerome." ...|$|R
60|$|As the <b>carriage</b> <b>stopped,</b> several anxious {{faces were}} {{seen on the}} watch, but the Doctor signed them back till he had {{deposited}} Henry in his study, and then came among them.|$|R
60|$|It was on {{the next}} {{afternoon}} that the Broadstone <b>carriage</b> <b>stopped</b> at the toll-gate. Mrs. Easterfield sprang out of it, asking for nobody, for she had spied Olive in the arbor.|$|R
