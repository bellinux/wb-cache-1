5|$|The {{number of}} {{orphaned}} children in Malawi {{has increased dramatically}} since the HIV/AIDS epidemic began in 1985, with certain surveys indicating that more than 35% of schoolchildren have experienced the death {{of at least one}} parent due to HIV/AIDS. Because HIV is transmitted sexually, married couples who engage in unprotected sexual relations put their children at increased risk of becoming double orphans, or <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> lost both parents to HIV/AIDS. Older <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> lost both parents to HIV/AIDS often become responsible for the care of their younger siblings, and many double orphans drop out of school or migrate to urban areas to try to support themselves and their siblings. Girls who have been orphaned by HIV/AIDS have unusually high rates of school absenteeism in Malawi.|$|E

Analyses had been done based on data provided by the Tweede Nederlandse Prevalentiestudie naar Mishandeling van Kinderen en Jeugdigen (NPM- 2010). It appeared that more then half of the <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> witnessed domestic violence suffered from {{at least one other}} form of maltreatment. No differences were found in the nine characteristics that had been tested in their distributions for <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> witnessed domestic violence compared with <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> maltreated in another form. With this study is confirmed that witnessing domestic violence does not significantly deviates from other maltreatmentforms...|$|R

5|$|The game's story {{focuses on}} the Yoshi clan {{as they attempt to}} rescue newborn <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> been kidnapped by Kamek. Yoshi's Island DS uses the same updated {{graphical}} style as Yoshi Touch & Go but retains the same core gameplay as its Super Nintendo Entertainment System predecessor; but whereas the SNES game featured only Baby Mario and Baby Luigi, DS introduces Baby Peach, Baby Donkey Kong, and Baby Wario, while allowing the player to control Baby Bowser. Each baby bestows a different ability upon Yoshi. The objective of the game is to use these abilities to progress through various themed worlds.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work. In this episode, Mulder becomes obsessed {{with a number of}} <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> vanished while investigating the bizarre disappearance of a young girl from her home. In the meanwhile, Scully fears that he is emotionally involved due to his sister's disappearance 27 years earlier. Her fears are heightened when Mulder's mother dies, apparently of suicide.|$|E

40|$|THESIS ANNOTATION Title: The Impact of Baby Swimming on Introductory and Elementary Swimming Training Aim: To {{assess the}} impact of 'baby swimming' on the successfulness in {{introductory}} and partly in elementary swimming training, and to find out whether also other circumstances (for example the length of attendance at 'baby swimming') have some influence on introductory swimming training. Methods: We used a questionnaire method for the parents of <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> attended 'baby swimming' and for instructors Swimming Training. Results: It was proved that <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> attended 'baby swimming' were noticeably more successful in elementary swimming skills compared with <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> not attended baby swimming. However, the differences in mastering the basic swimming skills were only slightly better in the group of <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> done baby swimming. Adaptation to water surroundings progressed in the same way for both groups of <b>children.</b> Nevertheless, <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> attended 'baby swimming' looked more confident in general. Furthermore, it has been proved that there is a connection between a child's successfulness in introductory swimming training and the length of their attendance at 'baby swimming'.

5|$|When {{properly}} treated, {{people with}} malaria can usually expect a complete recovery. However, severe malaria can progress extremely rapidly and cause death within hours or days. In {{the most severe}} cases of the disease, fatality rates can reach 20%, even with intensive care and treatment. Over the longer term, developmental impairments have been documented in <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> suffered episodes of severe malaria. Chronic infection without severe disease can occur in an immune-deficiency syndrome associated with a decreased responsiveness to Salmonella bacteria and the Epstein–Barr virus.|$|E
5|$|Antibiotics are {{not usually}} used for gastroenteritis, {{although}} they are sometimes recommended if symptoms are particularly severe or if a susceptible bacterial cause is isolated or suspected. If antibiotics are to be employed, a macrolide (such as azithromycin) is preferred over a fluoroquinolone due to higher rates {{of resistance to the}} latter. Pseudomembranous colitis, usually caused by antibiotic use, is managed by discontinuing the causative agent and treating it with either metronidazole or vancomycin. Bacteria and protozoans that are amenable to treatment include Shigella Salmonella typhi, and Giardia species. In those with Giardia species or Entamoeba histolytica, tinidazole treatment is recommended and superior to metronidazole. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the use of antibiotics in young <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> both bloody diarrhea and fever.|$|E
5|$|Newborn {{children}} with hypothyroidism may have normal birth weight and height (although the head may {{be larger than}} expected and the posterior fontanelle may be open). Some may have drowsiness, decreased muscle tone, a hoarse-sounding cry, feeding difficulties, constipation, an enlarged tongue, umbilical hernia, dry skin, a decreased body temperature and jaundice. A goiter is rare, although it may develop later in <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> a thyroid gland that does not produce functioning thyroid hormone. A goiter may also develop in children growing up in areas with iodine deficiency. Normal growth and development may be delayed, and not treating infants may lead to an intellectual impairment (IQ 6–15 points lower in severe cases). Other problems include the following: large scale and fine motor skills and coordination, reduced muscle tone, squinting, decreased attention span, and delayed speaking. Tooth eruption may be delayed.|$|E

40|$|Third- and fourth-grade {{boys and}} girls (mean age 7 years, 10 months) were {{directly}} instructed to share half their winnings from a bowling game under one of three types of verbal appeal: a power assertive appeal emphasizing punitive consequences for noncompliance, an inductive appeal emphasizing the child 2 ̆ 7 s potential contribution to the well being of another person, or a neutral appeal. While they complied with this request, half the children were monitored by television camera; the other half were not. A measure of generalized sharing (noninstructed sharing under anonymous conditions) was then collected. It was predicted that generalized sharing would be greater for <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> heard the inductive appeal than for <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> heard the power assertive appeal and would be greater for <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> shared without television surveillance than for <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> shared under survellance. As predicted, generalized sharing was highest among <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> received the inductive appeal. However, prior surveillance depressed noninstructed sharing only for girls <b>who</b> <b>had</b> received the power assertive appeal. There was one additional and unexpected finding: when children were asked to reinforce themselves for having shared in the instructed sharing phase, boys <b>who</b> <b>had</b> shared in compliance with a power assertive appeal indulged themselves more than children in any other condition...|$|R
5|$|Researchers {{have argued}} that {{cognitive}} flexibility is also a component of multiple classification, as originally described by psychologist Jean Piaget. In multiple classification tasks, participants (primarily <b>children,</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> already developed or {{are in the process}} of developing this skill) must classify objects in several different ways at once - thereby thinking flexibly about them. Similarly, in order to be cognitively flexible they must overcome centration, which is the tendency for young children to solely focus on one aspect of an object or situation. For example, when children are young they may be solely able to focus on one aspect of an object (i.e. color of object), and be unable to focus on both aspects (i.e. both color and kind of object). Thus, research suggests if an individual is centrated in their thinking, then they will be more cognitively inflexible.|$|E
5|$|Students in Malawi have {{expressed}} {{high levels of}} dissatisfaction regarding the HIV/AIDS-related education and support they receive at school. According to a survey of students in Malawi, most secondary students {{do not believe that}} the HIV/AIDS curricula at their schools provide them with an adequate understanding of the disease. Although the Malawian government and non-governmental organizations have conducted many campaigns to improve awareness about HIV/AIDS in schools, there is still a significant shortage of age-appropriate audio and visual educational materials relating to HIV/AIDS available to instructors, particularly in rural areas. In addition, most teachers cannot identify the students in their classes who have been personally affected by the epidemic, either through friends or relatives, which suggests that school-based support for HIV/AIDS is minimal. However, despite this lack of support, surveys indicate that <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> been affected by the epidemic do not usually experience HIV/AIDS-based discrimination at school.|$|E
5|$|The more {{positive}} emotions and behavior that a 12- to 24-month-old toddler displays when coping with separation from a parent, the better s/he is 3.5 years later at using cooling strategies {{in order to}} delay gratification. This suggests that the emotional skills and processes required for coping with social and interpersonal frustrations {{are similar to those}} utilized for coping with the aggravation of goal-directed delay of gratification. Maternal attachment also influences the development of a child's ability to delay gratification. An interaction has been found between a mother's level of control and how close a child stays to the mother while exploring the environment. <b>Children</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> controlling mothers and explore their environment at a far distance from her are able to employ more cooling strategies and delay rewards longer. Similarly, children who stay close to a non-controlling mothers also use more cool strategies and demonstrate longer delays. This suggests that some children of controlling mothers have better learned how to distract themselves from or effectively avoid intrusive stimuli, although additional effects on their emotional competency are speculated but unknown. A greater capacity to delay gratification by using effective attentional strategies is also seen in preschoolers whose mothers had been responsive and supportive during particularly stressful times of self-regulation when the child was a toddler, indicating that maternal responsiveness during highly demanding times is crucial for the development of self-regulation, self-control and emotional competency.|$|E

40|$|Aim: High {{rates of}} {{paediatric}} ear, nose and throat (ENT) surgery persist. Little {{is known about}} its impact on health service utilisation. This study investigated whether <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> ENT surgery used more health services prior to surgery (excluding the perisurgery period), and, if so, whether surgery resulted in reduced utilisation. Methods: A retrospective population cohort study of health services use (measured by Medicare claims) by 6239 New South Wales children {{from the time of}} their birth in January 1990 until December 1997. We compared: (i) number of claims during the 8 -year period for the 359 <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> privately-funded ENT surgery (tonsillectomy, myringotomy or adenoidectomy) with claims made by 5880 <b>children</b> <b>who</b> did not <b>have</b> ENT surgery; and (ii) among <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> surgery: we compared claims made before surgery with those made after surgery. Results: <b>Children</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> privately funded ENT surgery (comprising 59 % of all paediatric ENT surgery) used significantly more services than other children in total (103. 8 claims vs. 57. 1 over 8 years) and in each three months of age from birth to eight years, including services for non-ENT-related conditions. Tonsillectomy resulted in a decline in claims, but not to the level of <b>children</b> <b>who</b> did not <b>have</b> surgery. Most <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> myringotomy continued high-level health services use following surgery. Conclusions: High volume health services utilisation is a potential predictor of ENT surgery in this population. These results suggest a need to investigate non-clinical factors that influence service utilisation, which may include higher parental expectations or anxiety regarding their children's health. 7 page(s...|$|R
