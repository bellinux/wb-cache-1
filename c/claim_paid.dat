40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{distribution}} of malpractice claims among physicians {{is not well}} understood. If claim-prone physicians account for a substantial share of all claims, the ability to reliably identify them {{at an early stage}} could guide efforts to improve care. METHODS: Using data from the National Practitioner Data Bank, we analyzed 66, 426 <b>claims</b> <b>paid</b> against 54, 099 physicians from 2005 through 2014. We calculated concentrations of claims among physicians. We used multivariable recurrent-event survival analysis to identify characteristics of physicians at high risk for recurrent claims and to quantify risk levels over time. RESULTS: Approximately 1 % of all physicians accounted for 32 % of <b>paid</b> <b>claims.</b> Among physicians with <b>paid</b> <b>claims,</b> 84 % incurred only one during the study period (accounting for 68 % of all <b>paid</b> <b>claims),</b> 16 % had at least two <b>paid</b> <b>claims</b> (accounting for 32 % of the claims), and 4 % had at least three <b>paid</b> <b>claims</b> (accounting for 12 % of the claims). In adjusted analyses, the risk of recurrence increased with the number of previous <b>paid</b> <b>claims.</b> For example, as compared with physicians who had one previous <b>paid</b> <b>claim,</b> the 2160 physicians who had three <b>paid</b> <b>claims</b> had three times the risk of incurring another (hazard ratio, 3. 11; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 2. 84 to 3. 41); this corresponded in absolute terms to a 24 % chance (95 % CI, 22 to 26) of another <b>paid</b> <b>claim</b> within 2 years. Risks of recurrence also varied widely according to specialty [...] for example, the risk among neurosurgeons was four times as great as the risk among psychiatrists. CONCLUSIONS: Over a recent 10 -year period, a small number of physicians with distinctive characteristics accounted for a disproportionately large number of <b>paid</b> malpractice <b>claims...</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{examine the}} role of {{business}} interruption insurance in business recovery following the Christchurch earthquake in 2011 in the short- and medium-term. In the short-term analysis, we ask whether insurance {{increases the likelihood of}} business survival {{in the aftermath of a}} disaster. We find only weak evidence that those firms that had incurred damage, but were covered by business interruption insurance, had higher likelihood of survival post-quake compared with those firms that did not have insurance. This absence of evidence may reflect the high degree of uncertainty in the months following the 2011 earthquake and the multiplicity of severe aftershocks. For the medium-term, our results show a more explicit role for insurance in the aftermath of a disaster. Firms with business interruption insurance have a higher probability of increasing productivity and improved performance following a catastrophe. Furthermore, our results show that those organisations that receive prompt and full payments of their claims have a better recovery, in terms of profitability and a subjective ‘”better off” measure’ than those that had protracted or inadequate claim payments (less than 80 % of the <b>claim</b> <b>paid</b> within 2. 5 years). Interestingly, the latter group does worse than those organisations that had damage but no insurance coverage. This analysis strongly indicates the importance not only of good insurance coverage, but of an insurance system that also delivers prompt claim payments. As a first paper attempting to empirically identify a causal effect of insurance on business recovery, we also emphasize some caveats to our analysis...|$|E
40|$|U radu se izlažu generalne postavke maksimalne (okvirne hipoteke) te uređenje ovog oblika hipoteke općenito i u crnogorskom pravu prema Zakonu o svojinsko-pravnim odnosima Crne Gore. Posebno se analiziraju elementi prema kojima se maksimalna hipoteka razlikuje od fiksne hipoteke. Razrađuju su specifičnosti i podvrste maksimalne hipoteke te posebno kontinuirana hipoteka. Maximum amount {{mortgage}} is a subtype {{of mortgage}} for the securing, {{to the maximum}} amount, {{of one or more}} claims whose total amount is not specified at the moment of concluding a mortgage loan contract, but can be specified. It is used for securing claim(s) whose total amount cannot be known at the moment of entering into contract so an approximate amount is stipulated instead. Maximum amount mortgages are mostly characterised by their connection to a specifiable claim. This way they derogate to a substantial degree two traditional principles of security interests on real property: accessoriness (by securing future planned and possible claims) and speciality (at the moment of placing a mortgage lien the claim is not specified, but is specifiable). Certainly, these special characteristics entail differences in relation to the so-called fixed-rate mortgage. This primarily pertains to the stage in which the mortgage is created both in terms of the contents of the mortgage contract and entry into the cadastral register. Unspecifiedness and the maximum possible amount of claim guaranteed by a maximum mortgage are its main peculiarities. The amount of claim can remain unspecified for a longer period, even {{for as long as the}} mortgage is “concealed”, i. e. during the pre-settlement phase. However, in the settlement phase the amount of <b>claim,</b> <b>paid</b> from the value of the mortgaged property, can no longer remain unspecified, at least in terms of the principal. Maximum mortgage is usually constituted as a guarantee mortgage, a credit mortgage, or as one of the two variants of the continuous-repayment mortgage. It can also be constituted as one of the following: a mortgage for own or another’s debt; annuity mortgage; mortgage on state-owned property; joint mortgage; mortgage on civil fruits; submortgage; public notary mortgage (on the basis of an agreement between parties); public notary mortgage on a vessel or an aeroplane or a yacht on the basis of an agreement between parties; mortgage on the basis of a directly enforceable public notary act; mortgage on a property under construction, etc...|$|E
40|$|Takaful is the Islamic {{counterpart}} of conventional insurance, where {{it relies on}} a combination of tabarru (donation) and agency or profit-sharing. The takaful fund is considered a musharaka (partnership) among participants (policyholders). The relationship between the takaful operator and participants’ fund is based on either wakala contracts to manage the underwriting activities, and/or a mudaraba contracts to manage the underwriting or investment activities. Participants (Policyholders) in the takaful scheme are the main stakeholders; their equity consists of ownership of the underwriting activities and the investment funds. Participants’ relationship with Takaful Operators (TOs) depends on the percentage of the contributions premium they pay. They have a claim on assets of these funds in case of liquidation and they are entitled to have their <b>claim</b> <b>paid</b> if there is enough underwriting funds to finance payout; they are also entitled to share in the distribution of any investment and underwriting surplus. However, the only right that participants can exert on the takaful scheme is to disconnect their contractual relationship with the company in case of dissatisfactions. Participants’ undeserved rights might be due to management prioritizing interest towards shareholders as they are the main stewards of the takaful company. In other words, one of the main challenges faced in the takaful industry is shareholders and management discretions, power and activities due to the unclear structure of the takaful operational scheme. The Takaful operational scheme should follow the two-tier hybrid structure (mutual and proprietorship) as it has been identified by the prominent regulatory bodies such as AAOIFI and IFSB. However, almost all regulators, of which the Saud Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA) is one, treat the TOs as a proprietorship, as it can be easily regulated and supervised which requires an identified share capital and shareholders. The main aim of this study, hence, is to recommend proper protection channels for participants, by conducting two parallel ways research, (i) exploring participants’ perceptions, knowledge, preferences and satisfactions levels about the service and products presented by the TOs in Saudi Arabia (ii) reviewing and comparing the current directives and laws imposed by the Saudi insurance regulatory authorities with the standards and polices imposed by the international insurance and takaful bodies. In fulfilling the aim of the study, primary data collection research was adopted through a survey questionnaire technique. The questionnaire was structured with 4 main dimensions (Disclosure, Knowledge, Preference and Satisfaction) with a total of 26 variables to cover the research objectives and themes. The survey questionnaire was distributed to 9 TOs in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. A total of 300 out of 500 returned questionnaires were complete and found fit for analysis purposes. The data were analysed using various statistical analysis techniques ranging from simple frequency distribution analysis to the more advanced analyses such as non-parametric statistical analysis, Spearman’s correlation and multinomial logistic regression. In general, {{the results of the study}} show that participants’ overall perceptions and knowledge on TOs services and products is low, while participants reported high overall preferences which implies that participants are demanding more services from the TOs as they have more wants and needs. In term of satisfaction levels, participants reported a weak to moderate satisfaction levels, as a result of participants’ low perception, weak knowledge and high preferences which was obvious from the significant relationship between participants perceptions, knowledge and preferences as independent variables with participants’ satisfaction levels as dependant variables. In other words, in order for the TOs to satisfy their participants, they need to disclose more detailed information about different sorts of financial returns (investment return and underwriting surplus), as participants are financially motivated and there is no effect at all for religious motivation. The results of reviewing and comparing SAMA with the international insurance and takaful bodies, indicated that SAMA did not implement directive laws that address the takaful business nor any directive that address Shari’ah issues. Accordingly, it is highly recommended that SAMA adopts the well-established Corporate Governance and Market Conduct & Disclosure standards and polices that have been set by the international bodies such as AAOIFI and IFSB for better protection for the takaful participants in Saudi Arabia. The results of the research have established effective instrumental tools to measure the desired environment that should be available for the perspective policyholders and participants for their ultimate protection. These tools are based on participants’ perceptions, knowledge, preferences and satisfaction levels and based on the country’s regulatory assessments to support and protect participants’ and policyholders’ rights in the takaful fund. ...|$|E
