The structure of each of these compounds is discussed and a scheme for their formation is proposed. The oxidation of voachalotine N‐oxide without added acetic acid gives the same reaction mixture containing (2), (3) and (5). Finally the oxidation of dehydroxymethylvoachalotine (12) in dilute acetic acid gives 6 ‐oxodehydroxymethylvoachalotine (13). dehydroxymethylpolyneuridine oxindole (14) and dehydroxymethylvoachalotine oxindole (15).

The introduction reviews past work in this field. Once a satisfactory procedure for following thereactions had been decided upon, the order of theinitial stages of each reaction was determined. Concerning the <b>chromic</b> acid <b>oxidation</b> of iodide, which was examined by titrimetry, the effect of altering the experimental conditions e. g. by changing the ionic strength, dieletric constant and solvent was studied. By measuring rates at various temperatures it became possible to find the activation energy for the reaction. Experiments were also carried out in the attempt to ascertain the intermediate oxidation stage of chromium involved in the reaction, both by studies of induced oxidation and by analysis of the products formed when hydrobenzoin was added to the reaction mixture. A similar investigation was made of the reaction of Cr(VI) with ferrous iron, using a spectrophotometic technique. The reactive Cr(VI) species is at least closely allied to H Cr O 4. It was therefore important to haveinformation about the equilibriumunder the various experimental conditions. This equilibrium constant was measured spectrophotometrically, and the results were considered in relation to the determinations of other workers. In the last section, following a brief discussion of the equilibria existing in acid chromate solutions, the proposed rate expressions and the rate constants for the expressions are given.

In {{the present}} investigation, kinetic studies of {{oxidation}} of formic acid {{with and without}} catalyst and promoter in aqueous acid media were studied under the pseudo-first order conditions [formic acid]T>>[Cr(VI) ]T at room temperature. In the 1, 10 -phenanthroline (phen) promoted path, the cationic Cr(VI) phen complex is the main active oxidant species under-goes a nucleophilic attack by the substrate to form a ternary complex which subsequently experiences a redox decomposition through several steps leading to the products CO 2 and H 2 along with the Cr(III) phen complex. The anionic surfactant (i. e., sodium dodecyl sulfate, SDS) and neutral surfactant (i. e., Triton X- 100, TX- 100) act as catalyst and the reaction undergo simultaneously in both aqueous and micellar phase with an enhanced rate of oxidation in the micellar phase.

The syntheses of a number of alkyl isothiazolo[5, 4 -b] pyridines from 5 -amino- 3 -methylisothiazole under conditions of the Skraup reaction are described and their nuclear magnetic resonance spectra are discussed. The reactions of 3 -methyl- and 3, 6 -dimethylisothiazolo[5, 4 -b] pyridine have been studied. In particular they did not undergo nitration under the conditions employed and whereas the 3 -methyl compound did not condense with benzaldehyde, 3, 6 -dimethylisothiazolo[5, 4 -b] pyridine gave mono-styryl products with benzaldehyde, and p-nitrobenzaldehyde. Potassium permanganate oxidation gave isothiazolo[5, 4 -b] pyrid- 3 (2 H) -one 1, 1 -dioxides rather than the expected isothiazolo[5, 4 -b] pyridine carboxylic acids and <b>chromic</b> acid <b>oxidation</b> resulted in cleavage of the isothiazole ring to give 2, 3 -disubstituted pyridines. Ethyl 4 -hydroxy- 3 -methylisothiazolo[5, 4 -b] pyridine- 5 -earboxylabe was readily obtained by thermal cyclisation of the malonate from 5 -amino- 3 -methylisothiazole and ethoxymethylenemalonic ester. The hydroxyl ester was converted to a number of substituted isothiazolo[5, 4 -b] pyridines. In addition it has been established that methylation at nitrogen rather than oxygen occurs with both the 4 -hydroxy ester and the 4 -hydroxy compound which has been shown to exist preferentially in the carbonyl form, namely 3 -methylisothiazolo[5, 4 -b] _ 7 pyrid- 4 -one. The reaction of 5 -amino- 3 -methylisothiazole with ethylacetoacetate and with acetylacetone under the conditions of the Conrad Limpach reaction and the Combes reaction respectively, did not give isothiazolo[5, 4 -b] pyridines. The latter gave a product which has been tentatively formulated as 5 -acetyl- 3, 4 -dimethylisothiazole.

Section (a) was described in four parts. Firstly, the oxidation of adamantane and its bridgehead methyl derivatives was studied. Adamantane (1), 1, 3 -dimethyl-(2), and 1, 3, 5 -trimethyladamantane (3) were oxidised with concentrated sulphuric acid. Adamantane gave 2 - adamantanone (4), but no products were isolated from (2) and (3). The monohydroxy bridgehead derivatives of (2) and (3), however, gave the 6 -oxo- and the 4 -oxo-derivatives, respectively, after treatment with sulphuric acid. Ozonolysis of (2) gave the 2 -oxo-, 4 -oxo-, and 5 -hydroxy derivatives, and of (3) gave the 4 -oxo and 7 -hydroxy derivatives. Aerial oxidation gave the highest yields of monoketones, and the 2 -oxo-, 4 -oxo-, 6 -oxo- (total 11 %), and 5 -hydroxy derivatives of (2), and the 2 -oxo-, 4 -oxo- (total 10 %), and 7 -hydroxy derivatives of (3) were obtained. Separation of these ketones was achieved by alumina chromatography, and their structures were established from studies of their infrared, mass and NMR spectra. The oxidation of (3) with chromic acid produced mainly the 7 -hydroxy derivative and its acetate. 1, 3, 5, 7 -Tetramethyladamantane (5) gave the 2 -acetoxy-(6) 2 -oxo-(7), and 2, 4 -dioxo-(8) (but not the 2, 6 -dioxo-(9)), derivatives with <b>chromic</b> acid. <b>Oxidation</b> of the ketone (7) with chromic acid gave the 2, 4 -dione (8) and 4 -oxa- 1, 3, 6, 8 -tetramethylhomoadamantan- 5 -one (10), whereas the acetate (6) gave material, which was hydrolysed and oxidised to give the 2, 6 -dione (9) among other products. The ketone (7) and the three possible monoacetoxyketones, (11) (12) and (13), were identified in the product of oxidation of the acetate (6). Secondly, some derivatives of adamantane (1) were prepared to provide compounds suitable for the studies described in sections (b) and (c). Adamantanone (4) was converted via 2 -methyleneadamantane (14) into the epoxide (15), and thence into the 2 -aldehyde (16). A previously described preparation of (14) gave mainly a dimer. The 1, 3 -dioxane (17) was made from the 2 -aldehyde [see section (b) ]. Reduction of the ketone (4) gave 2 -adamantanol, which was converted via the tosylate into diethyl 2 -adamantylmalonate (18), which was reduced to the propan- 1, 3 -diol (19). The 1, 3 -dioxane (20) was prepared from the diol (19) with paraformaldehyde. Treatment of the ketone (4) in methanol with an excess of diazomethane gave almost exclusively 4 -homoadamantanone (21) with traces of higher homologues, which were formed in much larger amounts when the reaction was catalysed by aluminium chloride in ether. The 1, 3 -dibromide of (1) was converted into the 1, 3 -dicarboxylic acid, which was used to make the 1, 3 -dinitrile [see section (c) ]. Thirdly, some bridgehead derivatives of (3) were prepared providing further examples of the correlation between substituents and changes in chemical shift. The hydrocarbon (3) was used for the synthesis of the 7 -bromide, the 7 -acetate, the 7 -carboxylic acid and its methyl ester, and the 7 -nitrile [see section (c) ]. Fourthly, exploratory studies of the chemistry of the 2 -oxo-(7) and 2, 4 -dioxo-(8) derivatives of (5) were made. The monoketone (7) was reduced to the alcohol (22), which was converted into the 2 -acetate (6), the 2 -bromide, the 2 -carboxylic acid and its methyl ester (23), the 2 -methyl ketone and the 2 -nitrile. The ketone (7) was converted via the 2 -methylene derivative (24) into the epoxide, and thence to the 2 -aldehyde (25), from which the 0 -methyl oxime was made [see section (b) ]. The methyl ester (23) was reduced to the primary alcohol (26), and the solvolysis of its tosylate gave the olefin (24), but not homoadamantanoid derivatives. The ketone (7) was treated with diazomethane, and the product mixture was analysed by gas liquid chromatography. 1, 3, 6, 8 -Tetramethylhomoadamantan- 4 -one (27) was isolated and a bishomologue (28) was detected. The 2, 4 -dione (8) was treated with (i) methyl magnesium iodide giving syn-cis- 2, 4 -dihydroxy- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 -hexamethyladamantane (29), (ii) phenyl lithium giving syn-cis- 2, 4 -dihydroxy- 2, 4 -diphenyl- 1, 3, 5, 7 -tetramethyladamantane (30) and 4 -axial-hydroxy- 4 -phenyl- 1, 3, 5, 7 -tetramethyladamantan- 2 - one (31), and (iii) lithium aluminium hydride giving a mixture of isomeric diols, which was carbonylated with formic acid and converted into the lactone (32), and into an acid or acids which by treatment with acetic anhydride gave the cyclic anhydride (33) in low yield. The hydroxy-ketone (31) was reduced to syn-cis- 2, 4 -dihydroxy- 2 -phenyl- 1, 3, 5, 7 - tetrarnethyladamantane (34), which had a most unusual NMR spectrum, which included one hydroxyl singlet resonance, and another hydroxyl signal coupled to the secondary alcohol proton in a well resolved AB quartet. Very large intra-molecular hydrogen-bonded spectral shifts were observed for the diols, (29), (30) and (34), the value for (30) being 172 cm - 1. Section (b) was described in 3 parts. Firstly, derivatives of adamantane were used as models for correlating structure and NMR chemical shifts. NMR spectra were run on hydrocarbons (2) (3) and (5), and on all their monoketone derivatives,in carbon tetrachloride and tetramethylsilane as solvent. Assignments of protons were mostly straightforward, and in other cases, solvent shifts in benzene were used. The effects on the chemical shifts of other protons in the molecule of changing a methylene group to a carbonyl group were tabulated and compared with the chemical shift differences calculated due to magnetic anisotropy using a modified form of McConnell's equation. The values of carbonyl anisotropies used had been derived from a series of steroids and the calculated shifts were found to be much smaller than those measured experimentally for the adamantanes, which was explained by the flattened geometry of the steroids leading to overestimates in the 'geometric factor', and consequently underestimates in the anisotropies derived. More importantly, however, it was found the effect on the chemical shift of a C-H bond caused by changing a C-H bond or bonds by other groups (e. g. carbonyl or bromide) at a point distant from the first C-H bond is also dependent on the environment of that C-H bond. Secondly, NMR chemical shifts were used to determine the conformation of the carbonyl group in 1, 3, 5, 7 -tetramethyladamantane- 2 -carboxylic acid and related compounds. In all cases except the 2 -aldehyde (25), {{it was found that the}} carbonyl group pointed into the ring. The reverse conformation was predominant for the aldehyde (25). trans can be estimated than has been generally possible with the systems studied previously, which should lead to more confident predictions about conformation equilibria in such systems. Section (c) described the use of adamantane derivatives in determining the magnitude and sign of the electric dipole movement of a C-CH 3 group relative to a C-H group in a saturated system. Previous studies, which were not unambiguous, had suggested that a methyl group is electron-withdrawing relative to hydrogen when attached to (sp 3) carbon. The dipole moments of two pairs of bromides, nitriles, and monoketones were measured. The structure of the molecules in each pair was identical except for the substitution in one at bridgehead positions of two or three methyl groups. The moments induced in the methyl groups by the polar group or groups were taken into account giving a 'corrected' dipole moment for the methyl substituted compounds. A comparison between the 'corrected' moments and the dipole moments of the non-methyl analogues led directly to values of the dipole moment of a methyl group relative to hydrogen in a saturated system. The average value obtained was 0. 082 Â± 0. 02 D, the negative end of the dipole being on the methyl group. </p...|$|R
