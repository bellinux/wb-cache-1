The chapter first expands the concept of intrinsic motivations, then introduces a taxonomy of three classes of intrinsic-motivation mechanisms (based on predictors, on novelty detection, and on competence), and finally introduces and reviews the various <b>contributions</b> <b>of</b> the book. The contributions are organised into six parts. The <b>contributions</b> <b>of</b> the first part provide general overviews {{on the concept of}} intrinsic motivations, the possible mechanisms that may implement them, and the functions that they can play. The <b>contributions</b> <b>of</b> the second, third, and fourth parts focus on the three classes of the aforementioned intrinsic-motivation mechanisms. The <b>contributions</b> <b>of</b> the fifth part discuss mechanisms that are complementary to intrinsic motivations. The <b>contributions</b> <b>of</b> the sixth part introduce tools and experimental paradigms {{that can be used to}} investigate intrinsic motivation...|$|R
