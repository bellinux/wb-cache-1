40|$|The {{hyaluronate}} {{component of}} the extracellular matrix is a powerfully hydrophilic polymer, <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> osmotically <b>swelling</b> and deswelling by a volume factor of 5 or more. At the time of cartilage condensation in the limb bud the chondrocytes start to produce hyaluronidase, an enzyme which degrade hyaluronate. The consequent deswelling brings the chondrocytes closer together - close enough for intercellular cell tractions to become effective and intercellular junctions to form. By analysing the physiochemical situation we show how these processes, principally the coupling of the osmotic deswelling with cellular traction forces, can produce cartilage condensation patterns resembling those in the early limb bud. In distinction from our earlier model for chondrogenic condensations this mechanism {{does not depend on}} cell motions other than convective transport by contraction...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAn {{elastomeric}} gel is a cross-linked {{polymer network}} swollen with a solvent, and certain gels can undergo large reversible volume changes {{as they are}} cycled about a critical temperature. We have developed a continuum-level theory to describe the coupled mechanical deformation, fluid permeation, and heat transfer of such thermally-responsive gels. In discussing special constitutive equations we limit our attention to isotropic materials, and consider a model based on a Flory-Huggins model for the free energy change due to mixing of the fluid with the polymer network, coupled with a non-Gaussian statistical-mechanical model for the change in configurational entropy — a model which accounts for the limited extensibility of polymer chains. We have numerically implemented our theory in a finite element program. We have shown that our theory is <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> simulating <b>swelling,</b> squeezing <b>of</b> fluid by applied mechanical forces, and thermally-responsive swelling/deswelling of such materials...|$|R
40|$|Hydrogels {{are three}} {{dimensional}} hydrophilic polymer networks <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>swelling</b> in water or biological fluids. Their ability to absorb water {{is due to}} the presence of hydrophilic groups. Hydrogels {{play a critical role in}} many tissue engineering scaffolds, biosensor and bioMEMS devices and drug carries. Hydrogels have attracted considerable attention as excellent candidates for controlled release devices. Hydrogels can also be engineered to exhibit bio-adhesiveness to facilitate drug targeting, especially through mucus membranes, for non-invasive drug administration. Hydrogel based drug delivery devices have become a major area of research interest with several commercial products already developed. With ongoing research in advanced drug delivery formulations to provide stable and economical drug delivery systems, the focus is on hydrogel which are known to reduce the problems of not only conventional dosage forms but also of novel drug delivery systems which require a biocompatible, convenient and stable drug delivery system for molecules as small as NSAIDs (Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) or as large as proteins and peptides.

Clay-based PCs are <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> reversible <b>swelling</b> and accommodating changes in the effective refractive index of the layers by both adsorption and ion-exchange processes, and key issues in chemo-optical sensing such as accessibility, reversibility and selectivity are demonstrated. The utilization of nanoscale particles as active layer components is highlighted by the integration of microporous materials - zeolites - into a photonic crystal backbone.

40|$|The solvent-induced <b>swelling</b> {{behaviour}} <b>of</b> Victorian brown coals {{was examined}} in detail {{to probe the}} bonding mechanisms in very low rank coals (in this case Victorian brown coal). Correlation of solvent properties with differences in observed swelling behaviour were interpreted {{in terms of the}} coal structure, and means of predicting the observed behaviour were considered. Modification of the coal structure via physical compression (briquetting), chemical digestion, thermal modification, and functional group alkylation was used to further elucidate those structural features which govern the <b>swelling</b> behaviour <b>of</b> Victorian brown coals. Briquette weathering (i. e. <b>swelling</b> and disintegration <b>of</b> briquettes when exposed to variations in humidity and temperature) was examined by making alterations to briquette feed material and observing the effects on swelling in water. The application of solubility parameter alone to prediction <b>of</b> coal <b>swelling</b> was rejected due to the many exceptions to any proposed trend. Brown coal swelling showed a minimum when the solvent electron-donor number (DN) minus its electron-acceptor number (AN) was closest to zero, i. e. when DN and AN were of similar magnitude. The degree <b>of</b> <b>swelling</b> increased either side of this point, as predicted by theory. In contrast to the solubility parameter approach (which suffers from the uncertainty caused by specific interaction between coal and solvent), the electron donor/acceptor approach is about specific interactions. It was concluded that a combination of total and three-dimensional solubility parameters and solvent electron donor/acceptor numbers may be used to predict solvent <b>swelling</b> <b>of</b> unextracted brown coals with some success. Solvent access to chemically densified coal was found to be insensitive to a reduction in pore volume, and chemical effects were dominant. Thermal modification of the digested coal resulted in reduced swelling for all solvents, indicating that the structure had adopted a minimum energy configuration due to decarboxylation and replacement of hydrogen bonds with additional covalent bonds. <b>Swelling</b> <b>of</b> oxygen-alkylated coals demonstrated that the more polar solvents are able to break relatively weak hydrogen bonded crosslinks. The large difference between the rate and extent <b>of</b> <b>swelling</b> in water (and hence weathering) of Yallourn and Morwell briquettes was shown to be almost entirely attributable to exchanged magnesium. Magnesium exchange significantly increases the rate and extent <b>of</b> <b>swelling</b> <b>of</b> Yallourn coal. It was also shown that the <b>swelling</b> <b>of</b> briquettes due to uptake of water by magnesium-exchanged coals is reduced significantly with controlled ageing of the briquettes. The solvent <b>swelling</b> behaviour <b>of</b> Victorian brown coals is consistent with the notion that coal is a both covalently and non-covalently crosslinked and entangled macromolecular network comprising extractable species, which are held within the network by a wide range of non-covalent, polar, electron donor/acceptor interactions. Solvents <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> significant extraction of whole brown coals are also <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> significant <b>swelling,</b> but not dissolution, of the macromolecular coal network, which supports the view that the network is comprised of both covalent and ionic bonding. Victorian brown coals have also been shown to exhibit polyelectrolytic behaviour due to a high concentration of ionisable surface functionalities...|$|R
40|$|Chronic pain may {{be defined}} as pain which {{persists}} in a patient for a prolonged period of time. Although {{this period of time}} may range from 3 - 12 months, it is most commonly described as pain which extends beyond the time required for healing. Chronic pain may also be classified into two different categories depending on the cause. The first category is nociceptive, which is chronic pain caused by activation of nociceptors. This may be due to several factors such as trauma or temperature. The second category is neuropathic chronic pain. These are chronic pains which are not necessarily caused by trauma, but more likely due to the malfunction of the nervous system. For this study, our aim is to develop a patient-controlled, externally actuated hydrogel system which is capable of ‘ON-OFF’ drug release. The model drug which was incorporated into the SAPD was a Non- Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAID), and thus our drug release system would be beneficial primarily for nociceptive chronic pain. This subcutaneously implanted SAPD is produced with an electroactive polymer which allows drug release in the presence of electrical stimulation. This would result in direct availability of drug at the site of actuation with reduced side-effects and increased drug bio-availability. The SAPD was formed by crosslinking polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) with diethyl acetamidomalate (DAA). The result was a hydrogel which was <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>swelling</b> while remaining insoluble when placed in various solvents.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} by which virions of cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (CCMV) disassemble and allow for translation of the virion RNA is not well understood. Previous models have suggested that virion swelling is required to expose the virion RNA for translation in a process referred to as cotranslational disassembly (M. Brisco, R. Hull, and T. M. A. Wilson, Virology 148 : 210 - 217, 1986; J. W. Roenhorst, J. W. M. van Lent, and B. J. M. Verduin, Virology 164 : 91 - 98, 1988; J. W. Roenhorst, J. M. Verduin, and R. W. Goldbach, Virology 168 : 138 - 146, 1989). Previous work in our laboratory has identified point mutations in the CCMV coat protein which result in virions with altered swelling characteristics (J. Fox, F. G. Albert, J. Speir, and M. J. Young, Virology 227 : 229 - 233, 1997; J. M. Fox, X. Zhao, J. A. Speir, and M. J. Young, Virology 222 : 115 - 122, 1996). The wild-type and mutant CCMV virions were used to correlate virion swelling with the ability of virion RNA to be translated in a cell-free wheat germ extract. Mutant virions unable to swell (cpK 42 R) are as infectious as wild-type virions in vivo, and the levels of translated encapsidated virion RNA {{are similar to those}} of wild-type virions in vitro. Mutant virions <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>swelling</b> but not of disassembling in vitro (cpR 26 C) are noninfectious and have severely reduced levels of translation of the encapsidated virion RNA in vitro. These studies suggest that virion swelling is not required for the cotranslational disassembly of CCMV. Additionally, the results indicate that there is a pH-dependent structural transition in the virion, other than swelling, that results in the RNA's being exposed for translation in vitro. An alternative model suggesting that cotranslational disassembly of CCMV involves presentation of the virion RNA through the virion fivefold axis is proposed...|$|E

"This {{research}} was {{aimed to develop}} the analytical model of functional spinal unit {{with the intent of}} understanding the contribution of Intervertebral disc condition on the failure mechanism of End-plates under high rate dynamic loading, The condition of the disc for young people is healthy as compared to old person. The simple single degree of freedom DRI (Dynamic response Index) model was utilized to measure the spinal deflection under the influence of dynamic loading is incapable of estimating the potential injury due to disc swelling. The failure considered is always the vertebral body failure due to crushing, but in reality, condition of disc plays important role in deciding the failure of the vertebrae. The detailed axis-symmetry model was utilized to understand the effect of various factors on the end-plate failure mechanism and it is observed that deflection of the end plate is critical failure criteria. The age and the peak load were found to be the significant factors dictating end-plate failure. In young people the deflection of end plate was higher as compared to the old people due to hydrated disc <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>swelling</b> under dynamic loads. The simplified three dimensional model of vertebral motion segment L 2 -L 3 was developed {{in order to understand the}} effect of nucleus pulpous pressure in end-plate deflection and to incorporate this model into the DRI model in order to estimate the effect of dynamic loading on the resulting spinal injury. The three dimensional model utilizes the MADYMO material models. The relaxation modulus for the nucleus and the annulus are obtained from the published results and the material parameters were mapped from these published data. Results of a sensitivity analysis indicated the major contribution of age on the end-plate failure. The result clearly indicated the need of modifying the present way of modeling the nucleus as incompressible fluid to viscoelastic incompressible fluid. This study indicated that failure of the end-plate was an important link in the failure mechanism of the spinal unit; this failure lead to the transmission of the disc tissue into the vertebrae and caused the burst fracture...|$|E

CCS {{is a common}} inactive ingredient used in tablet formulations. However, CCS is known to bind with certain drugs in solution through ionic interactions to form insoluble drug-CCS complexes. These complexes prevent the drug from being easily released and absorbed. Furthermore, CCS is <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> rapidly <b>swelling</b> and entrapping aqueous solutions. These properties make CCS an ideal candidate {{in the development of}} medications which can resist abuse via intravenous injection. Methods. Aqueous drug solutions containing low (200 μg/mL) and high (1000 μg/mL) concentrations of either acetaminophen, diclofenac sodium, dextromethorphan hydrobromide, lidocaine hydrochloride, and verapamil hydrochloride were prepared. To simulate extraction conditions, increasing amounts of CCS (25, 50, 100 mg) were then added to 10 mL of each drug solution. After 1 min, the solutions were centrifuged, the supernatant filtered, and drug concentration measured using UV-Vis spectroscopy at corresponding of 248, 275, 276, 263, and 278 nm, respectively. The amount of drug bound to CCS was determined indirectly from the amount of free drug remaining in the supernatant. Results. The percent of drug bound to CCS from solution greatly varied from 2. 6 % to 93 % depending {{on the nature of the}} drug and starting concentration of drug and CCS. Overall, acetaminophen showed the least tendency to binding, whereas verapamil hydrochloride showed highest binding percentage over all concentrations. Conclusion.

40|$|Diblock {{copolymers}} {{have enormous}} potential use as templating {{materials for the}} fabrication of highly ordered materials on a nanometer scale. This derives from the complexity of phase behavior in microphase-separated block copolymer systems. In the ordered state block copolymers commonly self-organize into ordered lamellae, cylinders or spheres. Recently, high-pressure diluents {{have been used as}} a processing aid when using block copolymers as a templating material. In this study several aspects of polymer-diluent phase behavior have been investigated using high-pressure carbon dioxide as a diluent. ^ It is well established that dilation of a copolymer changes the characteristic interdomain spacing of a phase-separated system. The interdomain spacing decreases with dilation by non-selective diluents and increases with selective diluents. The characteristic spacing of poly(styrene-block-dimethyl siloxane) has been measured using small angle neutron scattering (SANS) in high-pressure CO 2. A new power-law scaling for the change in interdomain spacing induced by dilation, which accounts for selectivity of the diluent, is presented. ^ The effect of high-pressure carbon dioxide on the order-to-disorder transition (ODT) of poly(styrene-block- 2 -vinyl pyridine) has been investigated using static birefringence. The results of these experiments indicate that in addition to the suppression of the ODT, dilation of a copolymer by carbon dioxide can induce the appearance of a second morphology. Further the appearance of this second morphology is strongly dependant on the sample history. ^ Methods for measuring the <b>swelling</b> <b>of</b> homopolymers in carbon dioxide have also been investigated.

40|$|Introduction: Water {{shortage}} in arid and semiarid regions is {{the most}} serious factor in limiting agricultural activities as it leads to the rapid reduction of yields from both a quantitative and qualitative perspective. Under conditions of water scarcity, leaf temperature rises, which causes plant wilting and premature senescence of leaves and, eventually, severes reduction of dry matter production. Use of high-efficient irrigation practices, improvement of soil's physical properties, and use of soil amendments such as superabsorbent polymers are some ways of compensating for water shortage, especially during the growing season. Some materials such as plant residues, manure, various types of compost, and superabsorbent polymeric hydrogels can store various amounts of water and thus increase water retention and storage capacity of soils. Superabsorbent hydrogels, which are also called superabsorbent polymers (SAPs) or hydrophilic polymeric gels, are hydrogels that can absorb substantial quantities of water. Hydrogels are a class of polymeric materials having network structures (with physical or chemical crosslinks) that are very <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>swelling</b> and absorbing large amounts of water. These materials are formed from water-solublepolymers by crosslinking them either using radiation or a crosslinker. Superabsorbents are widely used in many products such as disposable diapers, feminine napkins, soils for agricultural and horticultural purposes, gel actuators, water blocking tapes, medicine for the drug delivery systems and absorbent pads where water absorbency or water retention is important. Water is a major constraint for crop growth in arid and semi-arid regions, as the precipitation is low and uncertain in these areas. Efficient utilization of meager soil and water resources necessitates the adaptation of appropriate water management techniques. Suitable soil moisture increases the biological activities as result of physical and chemical condition of soil improving the crop production finally. Material and Methods: This experiment was conducted under greenhouse conditions in Shushtar city at northern Khuzestan Province using the randomized complete block design using 13 treatments and with 3 replications. Soil samples were taken from a field in the study area, air dried, and passed through a 2 mm sieve. Seven concentration (0, 0. 25, 0. 5, 0. 75, 1. 0, 1. 25, and 1. 5 percentage) of superabsorbent polymers (Aquasorb and Accepta) were used in greenhouse condition. Superabsorbent and 10 Kg soil thoroughly mixed in each pot. All treatments were irrigated when the plants at control showed sign of wilting. There were three replications of each treatment. NPK fertilizers were applied as urea, diammonium phosphate (DAP) and potassium sulphate (K 2 SO 4) based the soil test. Soil samples were again collected which were analyzed for nitrate-N, total organic carbon (TOC), phosphorus and potassium, bulk density, particle density and saturation percentage. NPK of plant samples were also determined. Data were statistically analysed by Duncan test using SPSS. Results and Discussion: Results had shown that the highest bulk density (1. 515 gr/cm 3) seen in control treatment and with increasing the polymer, bulk density decreased significantly to 0. 91 gr/cm 3 in treatment No. 2. Also the treatments No. 4 and 11 shown decreasing EC significantly from 0. 9 in control treatment to 0. 68 in No. 4. Adding superabsorbent had significant effect on Potassium amount of soil. Using superabsorbent had no significant effect on real density, pH, N amount, Phosphorous, soil organic carbon after yield harvesting in soil and amount of Phosphorous in plant. Significant increasing in number of leaves, branches, fresh weight of plant, and fruit weight with using superabsorbent polymers and the highest used polymer level (treatments No. 7 and 13) had the highest effect on fresh weight of plant which reported 47. 2 g for No. 7 and 90. 47 g for No. 13. Also using 1 percentage of Accepta superabsorbent (No. 12) caused the significant increasing of fruit weight (502. 9 g) instead of control (73. 5 g). Based on the presented results No. 2 and 9 had the most effects on N of plants, which the N amount in control was 1. 31 percentage and in No. 2 and 9 were 2. 88 and 2. 82 measured respectively. Treatments No. 7, 8, 9, and 11 had the most measured plant potassium. Final results had shown the number of bacteria and fungi increased significantly using superabsorbent and the number of bacteria increased to 215 × 104 in No. 13 and the number of fungi to 176500 in each gram of soil. Conclusion: The overall results of this research had shown the promotion of physical, biological, and finally increase the yield as results of using superabsorbent especially Accepta type. Using these superabsorbent polymers in farms need more studies because of more effective climate parameters...|$|E

We have shown that metabolic processes and membrane integrity are required for concealing this FCD as slices of rat cortex swelled immediately (within 30 [*]min) following dissection if treated with 2 deoxyglucose + cyanide (2 DG+CN) or Triton X- 100.

Three criteria {{were used to}} assess cell-mediated delayed-type hypersensitivity: footpad swelling, i. d. skin tests and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) production. Guinea-pigs sensitized with egg albumin (EA) and treated with DS showed strong positive delayed skin tests. Control animals given only EA showed negative skin tests. Lymphocytes from mice sensitized s. c. with EA and treated with DS showed an increase in MIF production. Delayed footpad swelling responses in mice sensitized s. c. with sheep red blood cells (SRBC) and treated with DS were increased when the mice were challenged 8 days after sensitization. Doses of DS which were effective in increasing delayed footpad swelling ranged from 50 - 200 mg DS/kg body weight. DS was only <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> increasing delayed footpad swelling responses when both SRBC and DS were injected s. c. at the same site.

The absorbency and degradability of SAP can be enhanced by utilization of carbon filler. In this research, SAP with carbon filler has been synthesized using graft polymerization method. Acrylic acid (AA) used as monomer, N, N-methylbisacrylamide (MBA) used as crosslinking agent, ammonium persulphate (APS) as initiator and different size of natural carbon filler used as filler. Water absorbency test showed that SAP with 500 µm carbon filler has highest degree <b>of</b> <b>swelling</b> while SAP with 125 µm and 71 µm carbon filler has degree <b>of</b> <b>swelling</b> lower than degree <b>of</b> <b>swelling</b> <b>of</b> control hydrogel. Scanning electron microscopic (SEM) image showed 500 µm carbon filler has better surface morphology and alignment to make interfacial contact with hydrogel besides buil excellent capillary effect to absorb and store more water. In conclusion, smaller in particle size of filler will decrease the degree <b>of</b> <b>swelling</b> <b>of</b> SAP...|$|R
40|$|The {{in vitro}} <b>swelling</b> action <b>of</b> L-thyroxine on rat liver {{mitochondria}} as examined photometrically represents an acceleration {{of a process}} which the mitochondria are already inherently <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> undergoing spontaneously, {{as indicated by the}} identical kinetic characteristics and the extent of thyroxine-induced and spontaneous swelling, the nearly identical pH dependence, and the fact that sucrose has a specific inhibitory action on both types <b>of</b> <b>swelling.</b> However, thyroxine {{does not appear to be}} a "catalyst " or coenzyme since it does not decrease the temperature coefficient <b>of</b> spontaneous <b>swelling.</b> The temperature coefficient is very high, approximatNy 6. 0 near 20 °. Aging of mitochondria at 0 ° causes loss of thyroxine sensitivity which correlates closely with the loss of bound DPN from the mitochondria, but not with loss of activity of the respiratory chain or with the efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation. Tests with various respiratory chain inhibitors showed that the oxidation state of bound DPN may be a major determinant of thyroxine sensitivity; th...|$|R

40|$|Although the <b>swelling</b> <b>of</b> {{a number}} of {{colloidal}} materials has been studied intensely, {{little attention has been}} given the thermodynamic aspects <b>of</b> <b>swelling.</b> This lack <b>of</b> attention is perhaps because the major part <b>of</b> sorption and <b>swelling</b> data are not subject to thermodynamic calculations. Katz (2) has pointed out that thermodynamics deals only with true equilibrium conditions and hence such effects as those <b>of</b> sorption and <b>swelling</b> hysteresis and changing surface of sorption during a single cycle must be eliminated in order that the results have theoretical significance.

40|$|The {{importance}} of the r 61 e which elasticity plays in the mechanism <b>of</b> <b>swelling</b> <b>of</b> a gelatin gel is well recognized in Procter-Wilson's theory <b>of</b> <b>swelling</b> <b>of</b> gelatin in acid or alkali. According to this theory (1) there are two opposing forces acting on a block of gel when placed in an aqueous solution of acid or alkali, first, the osmotic force which is {{brought about by the}} excess of diffusible ions in the gel over those in the outside solution and which causes the gel to swell, and second, the elastic force produced by the rigidity of the gel structure and which limits the extent <b>of</b> <b>swelling.</b> At equilibrium the two forces balance each other. Thus the elasticity of the gel plays the same r 61 e in the <b>swelling</b> <b>of</b> gelatin as hydrostatic pressure in osmosis phenomena. Proeter-Wilson's theory <b>of</b> <b>swelling</b> has been applied by Northrop and the writer (2) to the mechanism <b>of</b> <b>swelling</b> <b>of</b> isoelectric gelatin in the absence of acid or alkali. Swelling in this case is caused by the presence in gelatin of a soluble fraction which produces osmotic pressure. But the swelling in this case also is regulated by the elasticity of the iblock as a whole. When a gelatin solution is cooled and allowed to set, the gel formed is under no elastic stress, but as soon as it is placed in water and allowed to swell the gel undergoes an elastic strain producing a stress in it which resists the swelling until an equilibrium is established between the two opposing forces. Both the equilibrium conditions <b>of</b> <b>swelling</b> <b>of</b> isoelectric gelatin (3) as well as the kinetics <b>of</b> <b>swelling</b> (4) have been found to agree quantitatively with the described theory. The peculiar phenomena observed by Arisz (5) and others that gels of various concentrations when dried to an identical high concentration swell rapidly to their original concentrations and then take up water slowly, and also the effect o...|$|R
