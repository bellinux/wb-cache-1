This actualizes the problem of studying the communicative paradigm of <b>complex</b> <b>sentences</b> in general and the <b>complex</b> <b>sentences</b> with cause-subordinate clause in particular. In our research, we have aimed to study the communicative paradigm of <b>complex</b> <b>sentences</b> with cause-subordinate clause found in the texts of multi-genre Ukrainian prose fiction of the late 20 th – early 21 st century. The results of the conducted analysis allow us to state that the communicative paradigm of <b>complex</b> <b>sentences</b> with cause-subordinate clause is realized by means of such communicative types of sentences as declarative, proper interrogative, declarative-interrogative, imperative- declarative, and optative-declarative ones.

40|$|The {{mastery of}} English {{compound}} and <b>complex</b> <b>sentences</b> is of a paramount importance {{because it can}} help us to study the basic utterances of English spoken and written sentences. In addition, compound and <b>complex</b> <b>sentences</b> {{can also be used}} to express ideas that are impossible to express in one word, one phrase, or even in one simple sentence. In fact, they can be used to produce the effectiveness and clarity in English oral or written communication. Thus, the analysis of errors in English compound and <b>complex</b> <b>sentences</b> can be used as an input for the remedial teaching program. The present research tries to study three types of compound sentences and three types of <b>complex</b> <b>sentences</b> with the limitation on twenty five coordinators and thirty five subordinators being tested. The problems which were investigated in this study were: 1) the types of errors made by the students in constructing English compound and <b>complex</b> <b>sentences,</b> 2) the frequency of occurrence of each type of error made by the students in constructing compound and <b>complex</b> <b>sentences,</b> and 3) the areas of difficulties encountered by the students in constructing compound and <b>complex</b> <b>sentences.</b> With these problems, the present study had three purposes: 1) to find out the types of errors made by the students in constructing compound and <b>complex</b> <b>sentences,</b> 2) to find out the frequency of the occurrence of each type of error made by the students in constructing compound and <b>complex</b> <b>sentences,</b> and 3) to describe the areas of difficulties encountered by the students in constructing compound and <b>complex</b> <b>sentences.</b> The subjects of this study consisted of 79 sixth semester students of the English Department who were taking the translation course at Widya Mandala Surabaya Catholic University.

40|$|Relevance of {{research}} {{is due to the}} scientific need to systematize reasons of syntactic structures in the works of influencing the choice of the writer at work writing. On this basis, the need of clarifying the factors that influenced the choice of writer for writing the work is updated. This means that researchers pay attention not only to structural, semantic and communicative features of <b>complex</b> <b>sentences,</b> but special attention pay to the study of their writing potential. Of course, expressive features and functions of <b>complex</b> <b>sentences</b> that are directly involved in its formulation and design composition are shown in fiction. In the contextual environment we are able to explore more features of such syntactic structures. To constructions that were not the subject of this comprehensive analysis, are <b>complex</b> <b>sentences</b> with subordinate purposes and reasons as varieties of sentences dismembered with a meaning of condition in the novels by Boris Kharchuk «The Square», «Borders and Immensity». The object of our scientific research is <b>complex</b> <b>sentences</b> with subordinate purposes and reasons as a variety of sentences of segmented structure with the meaning of condition in the novels by Boris Kharchuk «The Square», «Borders and Immensity. » The aim of this research is to define the features of <b>complex</b> <b>sentences</b> with subordinate purposes and reasons in both kinds of sentences with segmented structure and their role in Boris Kharchuk’s texts. The aim involves the following tasks: describe the linguistic status of <b>complex</b> <b>sentences</b> with subordinate purposes and reasons (both kinds of sentences segmented structure with the meaning of condition in modern science); to analyze and justify the use of such structures (based on novels by Boris Kharchuk «The Square», «Borders and Immensity»). Results and conclusions. At the material of Boris Kharchuk’s novels «The Square», «Borders and Immensity» 77 <b>complex</b> <b>sentences</b> with subordinate purpose are discovered, which is 45, 8 %, and 45 sentences of reasons, which is 26, 8 % of all <b>complex</b> <b>sentences</b> segmented structure with the meaning of condition. Monitoring the operation of <b>complex</b> <b>sentences</b> with subordinate purposes in the works of Boris Kharchuk confirms their broad use. These statistical processing of <b>complex</b> <b>sentences</b> of this kind, drawn from novels, clearly show that they make up 45, 8 % of all analyzed segmented structure of <b>complex</b> <b>sentences</b> with a meaning of condition. This sentence structures perform a variety of functions: help to express the position of the author as for depicted events, reveal the inner world of the hero, a true atmosphere of sincere conversation. <b>Complex</b> <b>sentences</b> with subordinate reason in the analyzed novels by B. Kharchuk are also represented, though not distinguished by the diversity of communication. They dominate in the stories of the characters, monologues and dialogues, landscape descriptions. These designs clearly eliminate ambiguity of complexity and provide high culture expression. General contractors and sentences with purpose and reason with contractors play an important role and {{are an integral part of}} the language sys-tem texts of B. Kharchuk. Their functioning, semantic and stylistic role is regulated by individual author’s style. Most sentences contain emotional and evaluative components, help to outline the spiritual ideals of the writer, his inner world and feelings.
