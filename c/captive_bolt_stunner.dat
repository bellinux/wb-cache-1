40|$|In {{anticipation}} {{of the need to}} euthanize large numbers of cattle {{in the event of a}} foreign animal disease outbreak, two models of captive bolt gun and various firearms and ammunition loads were tested in order to assess their suitability. In the first phase of the project, two models of <b>captive</b> <b>bolt</b> <b>stunner</b> were used in an abattoir, and assessed for effectiveness. In the second phase, several firearms and ammunition were used on isolated bovine heads and assessed for effectiveness. Little difference was found between the two captive bolt stunners. Of the firearms and ammunition evaluated, the Ruger Mini- 14 and the Core-Shot round, a prefragmented projectile, were determined to be most suitable. In situations where large herds of livestock are to be depopulated, and where the restraint required for the use of captive bolt stunners is not practical, there are commercially available firearms and ammunition that are suitable for this purpose...|$|E

40|$|Owing to {{the demand}} for genuine mozzarella, some 330 water buffaloes are being {{slaughtered}} every year in Switzerland albeit a stunning procedure meeting animal welfare and occupational safety requirements remains to be established. To {{provide a basis for}} improvements, we sized anatomical specifics in water buffaloes and cattle and we assessed brain lesions after stunning with <b>captive</b> <b>bolts</b> or handguns by diagnostic imaging. In water buffaloes and cattle, the median distance from the frontal skin surface to the inner bone table was 74. 0 mm (56. 0 – 100. 0 mm) vs 36. 6 mm (29. 3 – 44. 3 mm) and from skin to the thalamus 144. 8 mm (117. 1 – 172. 0 mm) vs 102. 0 (101. 0 – 121. 0 mm), respectively. Consequently, customary <b>captive</b> <b>bolt</b> <b>stunners</b> may be inadequate. Free bullets are potentially suitable for stunning buffaloes but involve occupational safety hazards. The {{results of the present study}} shall be used to develop a device allowing effective and safe stunning of water buffaloes...|$|R
40|$|Apart {{from one}} article {{published}} by Rabl and Sigrist in 1992 (Rechtsmedizin 2 : 156 - 158), {{there are no}} further reports on secondary skull fractures in shots from <b>captive</b> <b>bolt</b> guns. Up to now, the pertinent literature places particular emphasis on the absence of indirect lesions away from the impact point, when dealing with the wounding capacity of slaughterer's guns. The recent observation of two suicidal head injuries accompanied by skull fractures {{far away from the}} bolt's path gave occasion to experimental studies using simulants (glycerin soap, balls from gelatin) and skull brain models. As far as ballistic soap was concerned, the dimensions of the bolt's channel were assessed by multi-slice computed tomography before cutting the blocks open. The test shots to gelatin balls and to skull-brain models were documented by means of a high-speed motion camera. As expected, the typical temporary cavity effect of bullets fired from conventional guns could not be observed when <b>captive</b> <b>bolt</b> <b>stunners</b> were discharged. Nevertheless, the visualized transfer of kinetic energy justifies the assumption that the secondary fractures seen in thin parts of the skull were caused by a hydraulic burst effect...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} brain damage in sheep {{resulting}} from penetrating and non-penetrating <b>captive</b> <b>bolt</b> stunning. DESIGN: The unrestrained heads of anaesthetised lambs were impacted in the temporal region with penetrating and non-penetrating <b>captive</b> <b>bolt</b> pistols (humane <b>stunners)</b> using a constant charge. Two hours after head impact, brains were perfusion-fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde. Coronal sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin and immunohistochemically for amyloid precursor protein, a sensitive marker of axonal and neuronal reaction in brains after trauma. Pathological changes in these brains were then quantified by morphometric analysis. RESULTS: The skull was fractured in 50 % of lambs after a non-penetrating head impact {{and in all}} animals after a penetrating head wound. Impact contusions were present in 80 % of lambs receiving a non-penetrating head injury and in all of those with a penetrating wound. Total contusion area was similar in both groups. Amyloid precursor protein-positive axons and neurons, and haemorrhage, were widely distributed in the brain after both head impact types, {{but there was no}} statistically significant difference between the two groups. Multifocal necrosis of the cerebellar granular layer was found in all lambs with non-penetrating head injury, but in none with a penetrating injury. CONCLUSIONS: The structural brain damage, a mixture of focal and diffuse injury, produced by penetrating and non-penetrating <b>captive</b> <b>bolt</b> pistols was overall similar and of sufficient severity to suggest that both types of weapon are acceptable for euthanasia...|$|R
50|$|A <b>captive</b> <b>bolt</b> pistol or gun (also {{variously}} {{known as}} a cattle gun, stunbolt gun, <b>bolt</b> gun, or <b>stunner)</b> is a device used for stunning animals prior to slaughter.|$|R
50|$|The free <b>bolt</b> <b>stunner</b> is {{used for}} the emergency, in-the-field {{euthanasia}} of large farm-animals that cannot be restrained. It differs from a true <b>captive</b> <b>bolt</b> gun in that the projectile is not retractable; it is similar in operation to a powder-actuated nail gun or conventional firearm. Capable of firing only when pressed firmly against a surface (typically the animal's forehead), the device fires a small projectile through the animal's skull. The veterinarian can then either leave the animal to die from the projectile wound, or administer lethal drugs.|$|R
50|$|Mechanical (<b>Captive</b> <b>bolt</b> pistol): This method can be {{used for}} sheep, swine, goats, calves, cattle, horses, mules, and other equines. A <b>captive</b> <b>bolt</b> pistol is applied {{to the head of the}} animal to quickly render them {{unconscious}} before being killed. There are three types of <b>captive</b> <b>bolt</b> pistols, penetrating, non-penetrating and free bolt. The use of penetrating <b>captive</b> <b>bolts</b> has, largely, been discontinued in commercial situations to minimize the risk of transmission of disease when parts of the brain enter the bloodstream.|$|R

40|$|Context: During {{commercial}} harvesting or non-commercial kangaroo culling programs, dependent {{young of}} shot females {{are required to}} be euthanased to prevent suffering and because they {{would be unlikely to}} survive. However, the current method for killing pouch young, namely a single, forceful blow {{to the base of the}} skull, is applied inconsistently by operators and perceived by the public to be inhumane. Aims: To determine whether an alternative method for killing pouch young, namely a spring-operated <b>captive</b> <b>bolt</b> gun, is effective at causing insensibility in kangaroo pouch young. Methods: Trials of spring-operated <b>captive</b> <b>bolt</b> guns were conducted first on the heads of 15 dead kangaroo young and then on 21 live pouch young during commercial harvesting. We assessed the effectiveness at causing insensibility in live animals and damage caused to specific brain areas. We also measured depth of bolt penetration and skull thickness. Performance characteristics (e. g. bolt velocity) of two types of spring-operated guns were also measured and compared with cartridge-powered devices. Key results: When tested on the heads of dead animals, the spring-operated <b>captive</b> <b>bolt</b> gun consistently produced a large entrance cavity and a well defined wound tract, which extended into the cerebrum, almost extending the full thickness of the brain, including the brainstem. When tested on live pouch young, the <b>captive</b> <b>bolt</b> gun caused immediate insensibility in only 13 of 21 animals. This 62 % success rate is significantly below the 95 % minimum acceptable threshold for <b>captive</b> <b>bolt</b> devices in domestic animal abattoirs. Failure to stun was related to bolt placement, but other factors such as bolt velocity, bolt diameter and skull properties such as thickness and hardness might have also contributed. Spring-operated <b>captive</b> <b>bolt</b> guns delivered 20 times less kinetic energy than did cartridge-powered devices. Conclusions: Spring-operated <b>captive</b> <b>bolt</b> guns cannot be recommended as an acceptable or humane method for stunning or killing kangaroo pouch young. Implications: <b>Captive</b> <b>bolt</b> guns have potential as a practical alternative to blunt head trauma for effective euthanasia and reducing animal (and observer) distress. However, operators must continue to use the existing prescribed killing methods until cartridge-powered <b>captive</b> <b>bolt</b> guns have been trialled as an alternative bolt propelling method...|$|R

50|$|<b>Captive</b> <b>bolt</b> : Commonly {{used for}} cattle and other livestock. The bolt is fired through the {{forehead}} causing massive {{disruption of the}} cerebral cortex.

40|$|Five {{trials were}} {{conducted}} {{to determine the effects}} of various alternative stunning and restraining methods on the quality of chicken broiler meat. The stunning methods used were electrical whole-body and head-only stunning with different voltages (25 vs 100 V) and frequencies (50 vs 200 Hz), and mechanical <b>captive</b> <b>bolt</b> stunning. Before being stunned, the broilers were restrained either by shackling them by the feet, restraining their heads while they were standing, or placing them in a cone. Convulsions during and after stunning were subjectively scored. At 1 d post-mortem, the pH, color, and the intensity and number of hemorrhages, of breast and thigh muscles were measured. Convulsions were, in order of increasing intensity, observed after whole-body stunning using 50 Hz, whole-body stunning using 200 Hz, head-only stunning, and <b>captive</b> <b>bolt</b> stunning. No differences in ultimate pH were measured. A consistent difference in color was observed between whole-body and head-only stunning. Head-only stunning resulted in darker and more red (P ≤ 0. 01) breast muscles. Head-only and <b>captive</b> <b>bolt</b> stunning resulted in hemorrhages that were located more distal in the breast muscle than those observed after whole-body stunning. <b>Captive</b> <b>bolt</b> stunning (in a cone) resulted in fewer (P ≤ 0. 01) hemorrhages in breast and thigh muscles than whole-body stunning (100 V, 50 Hz, shackled), and in a similar level of hemorrhaging as electrical head-only stunning (25 V, 200 Hz, in a cone) ...|$|R

50|$|Exsanguination {{is used as}} {{a method}} of slaughter. Before the fatal {{incision}} is made, the animal may be rendered insensible to pain by various methods, including <b>captive</b> <b>bolt,</b> electricity or chemical. Without prior sedation, stunning or anesthetic, this method of slaughter is understood by some to cause a high degree of anxiety, although other studies contradict these findings. The <b>captive</b> <b>bolt</b> is placed against the skull of the animal, and penetrates to cause tissue destruction in the brain, incapacitating the animal so that the procedure may take place. Electricity is used mostly in porcine, poultry and domestic sheep, whereas chemical is used in injured livestock.|$|R
50|$|Beyond {{the initial}} cost of {{purchasing}} a <b>captive</b> <b>bolt,</b> continued {{usage of the}} method is very inexpensive. The animal is incapacitated {{for the duration of}} the procedure, so it is one of the safest methods for the slaughterer.|$|R
40|$|Due to {{concerns}} about {{a link between}} variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans and similar prion protein-induced disease in cattle, i. e., bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), strict controls are in place to exclude BSE-positive animals and/or specified risk materials including bovine central nervous system (CNS) tissue from the human food chain. However, current slaughter practice, using <b>captive</b> <b>bolt</b> guns, may induce disruption of brain tissues and mobilize CNS tissues into the bovine circulatory system, leading to the dispersion of CNS tissues (including prion proteins) throughout the derived carcass. This project used a marker (antibiotic-resistant) strain of Pseudomonas fluorescens to model the effects of commercial <b>captive</b> <b>bolt</b> stunning procedures on the movement of mobilized CNS material within slaughtered animals and the abattoir environment. The marker organism, introduced by injection through the bolt entry aperture or directly using a cartridge-fired <b>captive</b> <b>bolt,</b> was detected in the slaughter environment immediately after stunning and in the abattoir environment at each subsequent stage of the slaughter-dressing process. The marker organism was also detected on the hands of operatives; on slaughter equipment; and in samples of blood, organs, and musculature of inoculated animals. There {{were no significant differences}} between the results obtained by the two inoculation methods (P < 0. 05). This study demonstrates that material present in, or introduced into, the CNS of cattle during commercial <b>captive</b> <b>bolt</b> stunning may become widely dispersed across the many animate and inanimate elements of the slaughter-dressing environment and within derived carcasses including meat entering the human food chain...|$|R
5000|$|In Islamic and Jewish law, <b>captive</b> <b>bolts</b> {{and other}} methods of pre-slaughter {{paralysis}} {{are generally not}} permissible, as consumption of animals found dead are regarded as carrion and stunned animals that are later killed will come into this category.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} effect of impact with a nonpenetrating <b>captive</b> <b>bolt</b> pistol in pigs by {{studying}} the resulting traumatic brain injury (TBI) and to compare the pathological changes with those found previously in the brains of sheep using a similar experimental paradigm. PROCEDURE: The unrestrained heads of six, anaesthetised, 7 - to 8 -week-old, Large White pigs were impacted in the temporal region with a nonpenetrating <b>captive</b> <b>bolt</b> pistol. Four hours postimpact, brains were perfusion-fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde. Coronal sections from six levels along the brain were cut and stained with haematoxylin and eosin and immunohistochemically for amyloid precursor protein, a sensitive marker of axonal injury (AI) in the brain after trauma. RESULTS: TBI in pigs was characterised only by very mild AI, whereas AI in sheep after <b>captive</b> <b>bolt</b> impact to the same head region was much more severe and widely distributed and often associated with vascular damage such as contusions, subarachnoid and intraparenchymal haemorrhage.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} the severity {{and distribution of}} structural changes in the brains of adult sheep stunned by penetrating <b>captive</b> <b>bolt.</b> PROCEDURE: The unconstrained heads of ten, anaesthetised, unhorned, 2 -year-old Merino sheep were impacted at {{the summit of the}} head with a penetrating <b>captive</b> <b>bolt</b> pistol. Six sheep were ventilated and four received no respiratory support. Two hours after impact, brains from the six ventilated sheep were perfusion-fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde. Sixteen whole, serial coronal sections from each brain were stained with haematoxylin and eosin and immunohistochemically for amyloid precursor protein, a sensitive marker of axonal and neuronal reaction in the brain after trauma. Pathological changes in these brains were then quantified by morphometric analysis. RESULTS: Structural change in all impacted brains was a mixture of focal injury around the wound track and more widely distributed damage in the cerebral hemispheres, cerebellum and brainstem, but varied considerably in severity between individual sheep. All nonventilated sheep died rapidly following respiratory arrest. CONCLUSIONS: After penetrating <b>captive</b> <b>bolt</b> stunning, damage to the central reticular formation, axonal connections, and the cortical mantle is the likely reason for failure of respiratory control and traumatic loss of consciousness...|$|R

40|$|European {{legislation}} {{states that}} after stunning regular checks {{should be performed}} to guarantee animals are unconscious {{between the end of}} the stunning process and death. When animals are killed without prior stunning these checks should be performed before the animal is released from restraint. The validity of certain indicators used to assess unconsciousness under different stunning and slaughter conditions is under debate. The aim {{of this study was to}} validate the absence of threat-, withdrawal-, corneal- and eyelid reflex as indicators to assess unconsciousness in calves subjected to different stunning and slaughter methods. Calves (201 ± 22 kg) were randomly assigned to one of the following four treatments: (1) <b>Captive</b> <b>bolt</b> stunning followed by neck cut in an inverted position (n= 25); (2) Non-stunned slaughter in an upright position (n= 7); (3) Non-stunned slaughter in an inverted position (180 ° rotation) (n= 25); (4) Non-stunned slaughter in an upright position followed by <b>captive</b> <b>bolt</b> stunning 40 s after the neck cut (n= 25). Each calf was equipped with non-invasive electroencephalogram (EEG) electrodes before the slaughter procedure. All reflexes were verified once before the slaughter procedure. At the beginning of the procedure (T= 0 s) calves were stunned (treatment 1) or neck cut in an upright position (treatment 2, 4) or inverted position (treatment 3). Calves of treatment 4 were <b>captive</b> <b>bolt</b> stunned 34 ± 8 s after the neck cut. Reflexes were assessed every 20 s from T= 15 s for all treatments until all reflex tests resulted in a negative response three times in a row and a flat line EEG was observed. In addition, reflexes were assessed 5 s after <b>captive</b> <b>bolt</b> stunning in calves of treatments 1 and 4. Visual assessment of changes in the amplitude and frequency of EEG traces was used to determine loss of consciousness. Timing of loss of consciousness was related to timing of loss of reflexes. After <b>captive</b> <b>bolt</b> stunning, absence of threat-, withdrawal-, corneal- and eyelid reflex indicated unconsciousness as determined by EEG recordings. After non-stunned slaughter, both threat- and withdrawal reflex were on average lost before calves were unconscious based on EEG recordings. The eyelid- and corneal reflex were on average lost after calves had lost consciousness based on EEG recordings and appeared to be distinctly conservative indicators of unconsciousness in non-stunned slaughtered calves since they were observed until 76 ± 50 and 85 ± 45 s (mean±SD), respectively, after EEG-based loss of consciousness. </p...|$|R
