As pension funds run a mismatch risk, fu-ture surpluses and shortfalls will occur. Surpluses are divided between bene ciaries and sponsor through <b>conditional</b> <b>indexation</b> and refund-ing.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{investment}} policy of collective pension plans. We focus on funds with a collective Defined Contribution character. We suggest two reasons {{to invest in}} equities: {{the lack of a}} well-developed market in index-linked bonds, and deliberate deviations from the Defined Benefit nature of the plan. Furthermore, this paper assesses the value of limited or <b>conditional</b> <b>indexation</b> options found in many plans. ...|$|E
40|$|Collective pension {{contracts}} {{can generate}} advantages for their participants by implementing forms of risk sharing. To ensure {{the continuity of}} a collective scheme, {{it has to be}} monitored whether the contracts offered to participants are financially fair in terms of their market value. When risk sharing is implemented by means of optionalities such as <b>conditional</b> <b>indexation,</b> the analysis of financial fairness is not straightforward. In this paper, we use a stylised overlapping generations model to study financial fairness for a <b>conditional</b> <b>indexation</b> scheme. We find that financial fairness for all participants at all times is not feasible within a scheme of this type, unless the nature of indexation is such that the scheme is reduced to DC. However, financial fairness for incoming generations at the moment of entry can be realised. We show how to compute the fair contribution rate {{as a function of the}} current nominal asset/liability ratio for a given level of nominal entitlements. At low levels of the ratio, the fair contribution for incoming generations is also relatively low; nevertheless, the joining of a new generation still has a positive effect on the asset/liability ratio...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} a Heston type inflation model {{in combination with}} a Hull-White model for nominal and real interest rates, {{in which all the}} correlations can be non-zero. Due to the presence of the Heston dynamics our derived inflation model is able to capture the implied volatility skew/smile, which is present in the inflation option market data. We derive an efficient approximate semi-closed pricing formula for two types of inflation dependent options: index and year-on-year inflation options. The derived pricing formulas allow for an efficient calibration of the inflation model. We also illustrate our approach using a real-life pension fund example, where the Heston Hull-White model is used to determine the value of <b>conditional</b> future <b>indexations...</b>|$|R
40|$|Pension funds {{evolved over}} time towards the {{adoption}} of more complex risk-sharing schemes {{in order to keep}} up with the financial market complexities and volatility. Among these, {{the adoption of}} an indexation policy is widespread and it is now conditional to the solvability of the fund. Pension funds recognizing <b>conditional</b> inflation <b>indexation</b> targets are obliged to pay an additional payoff that is linked to the inflation rate through some specific rule. The additional payoff normally takes the form of a contingent claim conditional to a “measure” of sustainability of the payoff itself. This contingent claim can be valued with the same techniques that are used to value options. This valuation technique is an indispensable tool for improving pension fund risk management and correlated fair valuation issues. The paper provides a valuation methodology for the inflation indexation as embedded option by means of scenario-based analysis. Results derive from a simulation procedure applied to an exemplar case and give the opportunity to state the nature and the value of the indexation option...|$|R

40|$|The {{principal}} {{purpose of}} this article is to analyse the trade-off between the (un) certainty in contributions on the one hand and benefits on the other that is embedded in different pension arrangements. The article employs the funding ratio (ratio of assets to liabilities) and the replacement rate (ratio of benefits to salaries) as key criteria for evaluating the risk sharing characteristics of a private pension plan from the perspective of the plan member. The stochastic simulations performed show that hybrid plans (those in between traditional DB and individual DC) appear to be more efficient and sustainable forms of risk sharing than either of the other two. Of the three main hybrid plans analysed, <b>conditional</b> <b>indexation</b> plans appear to have the greatest potential as sustainable forms of risk sharing. ...|$|E
40|$|Market {{valuation}} {{is becoming}} more and more popular, both in accounting and regulation, as well as in academic circles. For pension funds and their participants, the knowledge that market-valued pension liabilities can indeed be transferred to a third party, if necessary, is a great virtue. Using a simulation model, this paper demonstrates the implicit costs and benefits of using market valuation for a typical Dutch pension fund, which offers a guaranteed average pay nominal pension with <b>conditional</b> <b>indexation.</b> The impact turns out to be fairly small, if fixed discount rates are still used for conditional rights. However, if market valuation is used for both unconditional and conditional rights, contribution volatility increases significantly. A remedy is to increase the duration of assets considerably. It is not clear, though, whether this option is available for large pension funds given the limited supply of long-term bonds. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC. 2008...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{financial}} sustainability {{of a typical}} U. S. state defined benefit pension fund under the continuation of current policies and under alternative policies, such as changes in contribution, indexation and investment allocation policies. We explore the "classic" asset-liability management (ALM) results, which indicate that a policy of <b>conditional</b> <b>indexation</b> may substantially improve the financial position of the fund. We also investigate the value-based ALM results, which provide a market-based evaluation of the net benefit changes to the various stakeholders {{of changes in the}} fund's policies. All cohorts of participants derive a substantial net benefit from the current pension contract, implying that tax payers have to make substantial contributions. The aforementioned adjustment measures can be instrumental in alleviating the burden on the tax payer, although this will happen at the cost of a reduction {{in the value of the}} contract to the fund participants...|$|E
40|$|The {{financial}} {{crisis of the}} beginning of the millennium and the recent crisis have led many pension funds to adopt different management approach to overcome the arising difficulties to maintain a solid financial status. Among these, the adoption of an indexation policy which is now conditional on the solvability of the fund have been widely adopted. Pension funds recognizing <b>conditional</b> inflation <b>indexation</b> targets are obliged to pay an additional payoff that is linked to the inflation rate through some specific rule. The additional payoff normally {{takes the form of a}} contingent claim conditional to a “measure” of sustainability of the payoff itself; in most cases, the measure is linked to an asset and liability ratio able to capture and guarantee the solvability of the fund itself. Therefore, a full valuation of the obligation towards fund’s participants and the definition of an optimal investment strategy cannot exclude the proper appraisal of this additional option. The option payoff is conditional to a measurement asset that is different from the reference underlying asset. This structure recalls a barrier option with different measurement and payoff asset. The paper investigates the opportunity to apply barrier option scheme to the case of a pension fund, whose <b>indexation</b> target is <b>conditional</b> to a specific value of the funding ratio, in order to provide a full valuation of the obligation towards participants. The main objective is to provide a value for the inflation indexation as embedded option. Results derive from a simulation procedure applied to an exemplar case by means of scenario-based analysis. Numerical results gives the opportunity to state the absolute value of the “inflation option” and the relative value with respect to the fund’s liability...|$|R
40|$|The European Union is {{currently}} preparing {{a new set}} of rules for the supervision of insurance companies, and is considering implementing these rules for pension funds as well. This framework is known as Solvency II. Similar to the Basle II framework for banking supervision, Solvency II is based on market-consistent valuation and risk management techniques. Market-consistent valuation means that the value of any entry in a balance sheet is determined by the price for which an asset or liability could be traded in a market transaction between two willing and knowledgeable counter-parties. Thus, a "mark-tomarket" approach should be used for assets and liabilities whenever the prices can be observed in a liquid market. In other cases, a "mark-to-model" approach must be used to value the assets or liabilities, where the valuations models should incorporate all of the relevant market information. The benefits of market valuation are clearly found in increased transparency and accountability of pension schemes. However, there is a widespread fear— typically prevalent on pension fund boards— that market valuation based on the actual term structure of interest rates leads to excessive volatility in funding ratios. If regulators then impose solvency regulations in terms of these market-based funding ratios, contribution rates may become much more volatile. For pension fund boards, this means tougher negotiations with the sponsor of the pension scheme, and more frequent bad-news messages, caused by downward spikes in the discount rate. In order to circumvent these problems, the FTK still allows pension funds to use a smoothed or fixed discount rate to determine contribution levels, even though their solvency is always determined by the prevailing term structure of interest rates. Moreover, the solvency rules are applied only to guaranteed (in practice, nominal) pension rights. The use of market-consistent valuation- and risk management techniques is not uncontroversial in the case of pension liabilities— particularly for pension liabilities with <b>conditional</b> <b>indexation...</b>|$|E
