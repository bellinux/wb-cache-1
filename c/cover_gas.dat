40|$|Abstract—Graphite {{sublimation}} {{tests have}} been conducted in a high-temperature oven, which is operated either in high vacuum or in a 1 -atm <b>cover</b> <b>gas</b> of helium (or argon). Preliminary data of the sublimation rate of graphite foils at ~ 2400 K in vacuum are consistent with theoretical prediction. Additional tests of graphite rods (15 mm in diameter and 300 mm long) {{have been conducted}} in high vacuum and in cover gases of helium as well as argon. The sublimation rate at 2350 K is 1. 7 mg/h for static argon <b>cover</b> <b>gas</b> (> 1 atm) and 0. 78 mg/h for static helium <b>cover</b> <b>gas.</b> These values of sublimation rate for <b>cover</b> <b>gas</b> cases are {{lower than that of}} 5. 8 mg/h in high vacuum.

The {{purpose of this}} study was to investigate the effect of varying <b>cover</b> <b>gas</b> compositions on the microstructure and mechanical properties of single run gas-metal arc welds (GMAW) on HSLA- 100 plate and seven different <b>cover</b> <b>gas</b> compositions containing varying amounts of argon, oxygen, and carbon dioxide were evaluated. A statistical and quantitative analysis of the nonmetallic inclusions in the welds metal was performed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive analysis of x-rays (EDX). These results showed that increasing the oxygen content of the <b>cover</b> <b>gas</b> reduced the inclusion size but increases the number density compared with pure argon <b>cover</b> <b>gas,</b> and that this was reflected in the weld metal microstructure since increasing amounts of acicular ferrite were detected predominantly to be of the spessartite composition (3 MnO, Al 2,O 3 3 SiO 2). As a result of increasing <b>cover</b> <b>gas</b> oxygen the strength of the weld metal appeared to be lowered due to the oxidation of aluminum, silicon, manganese, and possibly titanium.

40|$|The {{global demand}} for Mg alloys {{continually}} {{grew in the}} last 20 years, motivating a wide interest in {{the improvement of the}} mechanical properties of Mg-alloy castings. In addition, the existence of double oxide film defects, which were widely recognised as {{a major factor in the}} quality and reproducibility of the properties of light-alloy castings, has been demonstrated in Mg-alloy castings. Thus it became important to understand behaviour of double oxide film defects formed in Mg-alloys. In the work reported here, three different Mg alloys (commercial pure Mg, AZ 91 alloy, and Mg-Y alloys) and two <b>cover</b> <b>gases</b> (SF 6 /air and SF 6 /CO 2), were used, in order to involve different doubled oxide films which may have different behaviours.

In addition, oxide films growing on the corresponding Mg-alloy melt surfaces were also investigated. Based on the observed film structures in conjunction with a thermochemical calculation, evolution processes of the different double oxide film defects were suggested. The quality of Mg-alloy castings was evaluated by the Weibull modulus, which is popularly used to discriminate “good” and “bad” castings. A shortcoming of the traditional Weibull estimation method (i. e. linear least square method) was demonstrated, and a new estimation method was therefore come up with. The Weibull modulus result revealed that air can confer an improvement in the quality of AZ 91 castings, compared with CO 2...|$|R
