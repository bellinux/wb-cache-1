60|$|It is the {{absolute}} demoralisation of the host, in consequence of the strange test of their Lord, Agamemnon, making a feigned proposal to fly, and it is their confused, bewildered return to the assembly under the persuasions of Odysseus, urged by Athene, that alone, in the poem, give Thersites his unique opportunity to harangue. When the Over-Lord had called an assembly the first word, of course, was for to speak, as he does in the poem as it stands. That Thersifes should rise in the arrogance bred by the recent disorderly and demoralised proceedings is one thing; that he should open the debate when excitement was eager to hear Agamemnon, and before demoralisation set in, is quite another. We never hear again of Thersites, or of {{any one of the}} commonalty, daring to open his mouth in an assembly. Thersites sees his one chance, the <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>life</b> time, and takes it; because Agamemnon, by means of the test--a proposal to flee homewards-- which succeeded, it is said, in the case of Cortès,--has reduced the host, already discontented, to a mob.|$|E

Jang attempts to make amends for abandoning his college sweetheart by trying to give the orphaned Nayeon a home, to the anger of Yugyeong and the jealousy of his daughter Sejin.

40|$|Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) {{is among}} the most {{frequent}} neurological disorders. Of all TBIs 90 % are considered mild with an annual incidence of 100 - 300 / 100. 000. Intracranial complications of Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (MTBI) are infrequent (10 %), requiring neurosurgical intervention in a minority of cases (1 %), but potentially life-threatening (case fatality rate 0, 1 %). Hence, a true health management problem exists because of the need to exclude the small <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>life</b> threatening complication in large numbers of individual patients. The 2002 EFNS guidelines used a best evidence approach based on the literature until 2001 to guide initial management with respect to indications for CT, hospital admission, observation and follow up of MTBI patients. This updated EFNS guideline version for initial management in MTBI proposes a more selectively strategy for CT when major(dangerous mechanism, GCS< 15, 2 points deterioration on the GCS, clinical signs of (basal) skull fracture, vomiting, anticoagulation therapy, post traumatic seizure) or minor(age, loss of consciousness, persistent anterograde amnesia, focal deficit, skull contusion, deterioration on the GCS) risk factors are present based on published decision rules {{with a high level of}} evidence. In addition clinical decision rules for CT now exist for children as well. Since 2001 recommendations, although with a lower level of evidence, have been published for clinical in hospital observation to prevent and treat other potential threads to the patient including behavioral disturbances (amnesia, confusion and agitation) and infection...|$|E

60|$|That {{ultimate}} {{failure in}} her matrimonial projects {{would be the}} same as drowning she never for a moment doubted. It had never occurred to her to consider with equanimity the prospect <b>of</b> living as <b>an</b> old maid. It was beyond the scope of her mind to contemplate the <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>life</b> in which marriage might be well if it came, but in which unmarried tranquillity might also be well should that be her lot. Nor could she understand that others should contemplate it for her. No doubt the battle had been carried on for many years so much under the auspices of her father and mother as to justify her in thinking that their theory of life was the same as her own. Lady Pomona had been very open in her teaching, and Mr Longestaffe had always given a silent adherence to the idea that the house in London was to be kept open in order that husbands might be caught. And now when they deserted her in her real difficulty,--when they first told her to live at Caversham all the summer, and then sent her up to the Melmottes, and after that forbade her marriage with Mr Brehgert,--it seemed to her that they were unnatural parents who gave her a stone when she wanted bread, a serpent when she asked for a fish. She had no friend left. There was no one living who seemed to care whether she had a husband or not. She took to walking in solitude about the park, and thought of many things with a grim earnestness which had not hitherto belonged to her character.|$|R
50|$|The {{struggling}} DuMont Television Network {{offered little}} during the 1955-56 television season.

By September 23, What's the Story {{was off the}} air. DuMont honored its few remaining network commitments until August 6, 1956, when it ceased operations as a major television network. DuMont hoped to go into independent television production; the company's studio facilities and Electronicam system were used to produce CBS's The Honeymooners during the 1955-1956 season. DuMont's loss was ABC's gain, as some of DuMont's most popular programs, including Life Is Worth Living, <b>Chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Lifetime, <b>Life</b> Begins at Eighty, and Down You Go, found their way onto ABC's 1955-1956 prime time schedule.|$|R

50|$|Selective {{recruitment}} is {{the notion}} that, when making peer comparisons, an individual selects their own strengths and the other's weaknesses in order that they appear better on the whole. This theory was first tested by Weinstein (1980); however, this was in an experiment relating to optimistic bias, rather than the better-than-average effect. The study involved participants rating certain behaviors as likely to increase or decrease the <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> series <b>of</b> <b>life</b> events happening to them.
