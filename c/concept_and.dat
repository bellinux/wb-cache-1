He emailed it to Seeley, Norton, and Chew artist Rob Guillory, and after reading it they all agreed to participate. It was constructed as a double-sided book with two stories, one by each creative team.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{identify}} {{the most commonly}} used biostatistical <b>concepts</b> <b>and</b> tests in three journals read by family physicians. DESIGN: Descriptive study of the biostatistical content of 12 issues of the Canadian Medical Association Journal (CMAJ), Canadian Family Physician (CFP), and the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Frequency of citations of <b>concepts</b> <b>and</b> tests, and Spearman's correlation coefficients comparing the biostatistical profiles of the three journals. RESULTS: Biostatistical content of NEJM was diverse (on average, 39 <b>concepts</b> <b>and</b> 21 tests per issue). In CFP, we found 10 <b>concepts</b> <b>and</b> four tests per issue. In CMAJ, there were, on average, nine <b>concepts</b> <b>and</b> five tests per issue.

40|$|Abstract—The article {{discusses}} abstract {{spaces of}} <b>concepts</b> <b>and</b> features. <b>Concepts</b> correspond to real-world objects. Concepts are described by their features. The study {{is devoted to}} relations {{in the space of}} <b>concepts</b> <b>and</b> in the space of features. Of greatest interest is similarity of structures in the <b>concepts</b> <b>and</b> features spaces. There is a direct link between features <b>and</b> <b>concepts.</b> Therefore, similarity may be analyzed through structures of both <b>concepts</b> <b>and</b> features. Authors propose generalized similarity relation, applicable to the developed framework. In addition, similarity of nested sets of the space of features <b>and</b> <b>concepts</b> is discussed. Authors introduce an algorithm, which calculates similarity of two structures of nested structures. Developed semantics leads to the set-theoretic model, which allows to flexibly describe abstract information. I...|$|R
