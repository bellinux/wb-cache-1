The linguistic expert for the petitioners, Geoffrey Nunberg, successfully argued that whatever its origins, [...] "redskins" [...] was a slur {{at the time}} of the trademarks, based upon the passages from books and newspapers and the movie clips in which the word is inevitably associated with contempt, derision, condescension, or sentimental paeans to the noble savage. [...] "Nigger" [...] also began as a benign reference to skin color, only to become a racial slur through disparaging use. On June 18, 2014, the TTAB again voted to cancel the trademarks in a two to one decision that held that the term [...] "redskins" [...] is disparaging to a [...] "substantial composite of Native Americans." [...] Evidence of disparagement include the frequent references to [...] "scalping" [...] made by sportswriters for sixty years when reporting the Redskins loss of a game, and passages from movies made from the 1940s to the 1960s using [...] "redskin" [...] to refer to Native Americans as a savage enemy.

50|$|In 2004, the National Bureau of Economic Research found {{data that}} {{suggested}} Charter Schools increase competition {{in a given}} jurisdiction, thus {{improving the quality of}} traditional public schools (noncharters) in the area. Using end-of-year test scores for grades three through eight from North Carolina's state testing program, researchers found that charter school competition raised the <b>composite</b> <b>test</b> scores in district schools, even though the students leaving district schools for the charters tended to have above average test scores. The introduction of charter schools in the state caused an approximate one percent increase in the score, which constitutes about one quarter of the average yearly growth. The gain was roughly two to five times greater than the gain from decreasing the student-faculty ratio by 1. This research could partially explain how other studies have found a small significant difference in comparing educational outcomes between charter and traditional public schools. It may be that in some cases, charter schools actually improve other public schools by raising educational standards in the area.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the development of}} a new method for incorporating station related outages in composite or bulk system reliability analysis. Station related failures can cause multiple component outages that can propagate to other parts of the network resulting in severe damages. In order to minimize the effects of station related outages on the composite system performance it is necessary for the designer to assess their effects. This task can be achieved by including station related outages in the composite system evaluation. Monte Carlo simulation is used in this research to assess composite system reliability. The new method described in this thesis is used to include station related outages in the reliability evaluation of two <b>composite</b> <b>test</b> systems. This new method is relatively simple and can be used to consider multiple component outages due to station related failures in composite system reliability evaluation. In this approach, the effects of station related outages are combined with the connected terminal failure parameters. Reliability studies conducted on the two <b>composite</b> <b>test</b> systems demonstrates that station failures significantly affect the system performance. The system reliability can be improved by selecting appropriate station configurations. This is illustrated by application to the two <b>composite</b> <b>test</b> systems...|$|E

30|$|Recently, Dai et al. (Dai et al. 2015 b), {{investigated}} the notch sensitivity of carbon fibre reinforced polymers (CFRP) ORT and AI woven <b>composites</b> <b>tested</b> in quasi-static tension and tension-tension fatigue. The scope of both tests was the on-axis loading either along the warp or the weft direction. For quasi-static testing, DIC {{was used to}} monitor the damage evolution up to failure while an infra-red camera {{was used in the}} case of fatigue testing to monitor the development of fatigue damage. To address the effect of the notch size on the notched response of 3 D woven composites, two hole sizes with a diameter to width ratio of 1 / 6 and 1 / 2 respectively were tested. The study concluded that regardless of the hole size, the reduction in the strength of the investigated architectures did not exceed 17 % compared to the un-notched strength in the case of on-axis loading. Although 3 D woven <b>composites</b> <b>tested</b> along the warp or weft directions have been proven to be relatively notch insensitive (Mubeen 2014; Dai et al. 2015 b), there is very limited literature reporting the behaviour/sensitivity of 3 D woven composites loaded along the off-axis direction exists.|$|R
