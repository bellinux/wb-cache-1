50|$|Embezzlement {{differs from}} larceny in three ways. First, in embezzlement, an actual {{conversion}} must occur; second, the original taking {{must not be}} trespassory, and three, in penalties. To say that the taking was not trespassory {{is to say that}} the person(s) performing the embezzlement had the right to possess, use, and/or access the assets in question, and that such person(s) subsequently secreted and converted the assets for an unintended and/or unsanctioned use. Conversion requires that the secretion interfere with the property, rather than just relocate it. As in larceny, the measure is not the gain to the embezzler, but the loss to the asset stakeholders. An example of conversion is when a person logs checks in a <b>check</b> <b>register</b> or transaction log as being used for one specific purpose and then explicitly uses the funds from the checking account for another and completely different purpose.|$|E

It is important to make clear that embezzlement is not always a form of theft or an act of stealing, since those definitions specifically deal with taking something that does not belong to the perpetrator(s). Instead, embezzlement is, more generically, an act of deceitfully secreting assets by one or more persons that have been entrusted with such assets. The person(s) entrusted with such assets {{may or may not have}} an ownership stake in such assets.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to compare the {{financial}} management habits of Ball State University first-year students and seniors living on campus. A stratified, systematic sample of 100 first-year students and 100 seniors were surveyed during December 2000. Data were collected on 25 variables, 4 describing personal characteristics, and 21 describing personal financial management habits. It was determined that Ball State University first-year students and seniors have similar financial management habits. Statistically significant differences between first-year students and seniors existed on the following variables: having a student loan, knowing when the loan must be repaid, having one or more credit cards, carrying a balance on one or more credit cards, having a savings account, and recording expenditures in a <b>check</b> <b>register.</b> Financial management {{is an area that}} Student Affairs practitioners may want to consider investing more time educating students.

40|$|Abstract: In {{recent years}} the {{complexity}} of digital systems has increased dramatically. Although semiconductor manufacturers try {{to ensure that their}} products are reliable, it is almost impossible not to have faults somewhere in a system at any given time. As a result, reliability has become a topic of major concern to the designers and to the users of these systems. Unfortunately as the scale of integration has increased so also has the occurrence of intermittent faults. The characteristics of these types of faults render them undetectable by standard test strategies. This is particularly problematic with the wide use of complex circuits in safety-critical applications. Ensuring the reliability of these systems is a major testing challenge. The detection of intermittent faults requires the use of Concurrent Error Detection (CED) techniques, which continually monitor the operation of the circuit. One method of implementing CED in VLSI/ULSI circuits is through the use of information Redundancy or coding techniques. This paper investigates the use of Berger code as a means of incorporating CED into a self <b>checking</b> <b>register</b> file...|$|R

The paper discusses various rather typical RTL blocks that were subject to formal verification: FIFO control logics and arbiter blocks. These real-world examples provide a set of interesting verification challenges such as proper clock descriptions, synchronous constraints, multiple unaligned clock domains, usage of partial reference models, applica-tion of reduction techniques. ...|$|R
