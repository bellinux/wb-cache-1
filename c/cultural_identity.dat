40|$|In {{this study}} I {{describe}} how individuals living in Laredo, Texas, a city {{situated in the}} U. S. -Mexico border region, {{make sense of their}} identities through their experiences in the Washington Birthday Celebration (WBC). By focusing on communication as means for creating <b>cultural</b> <b>identities,</b> this study provides insight into how communication is used in the construction and performance of <b>cultural</b> <b>identities.</b> Specifically, I focus on The Society of Martha Washington, one of the several affiliate organizations that participates in the WBC, in order to answer the following research questions about the enactment of <b>cultural</b> <b>identities</b> in the WBC: (1) What <b>cultural</b> <b>identities</b> are enacted at the WBC and how do participants use communication to enact these expressed identities? (2) How do participants enact their <b>cultural</b> <b>identities</b> beyond the WBC? I argue that although the WBC is intended to foster a collective identity, it poses a problematic contradiction since it implicates the enactment of various identities wherein status differentials are enhanced.

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} I {{examine how}} preservice teachers explore <b>cultural</b> <b>identities</b> when using mapping and children's literature. Twenty-four preservice teachers {{enrolled in a}} one-semester children's literature course looked at their own <b>cultural</b> <b>identities</b> and the <b>cultural</b> <b>identities</b> of others. The preservice teachers were mostly white, middle class women. During the study they explored various aspects of their <b>cultural</b> <b>identities,</b> interacted with issues of culture, and reflected upon how class engagements influenced their understandings of culture and <b>cultural</b> <b>identities.</b> Data sources for the study included the following: several kinds of written reflections; student artifacts, such as physical and conceptual maps; and interviews that were conducted with seven preservice teachers after the semester ended. Data from four preservice teachers was highlighted in the findings. This research shows that these preservice teachers had difficulty moving from an individualistic view of their identities to considering issues of group membership. The preservice teachers preferred to discuss individual characteristics such as personality and how they spent their free time. This shifted somewhat {{over the course of}} the semester as I asked them to focus on aspects of <b>cultural</b> <b>identities</b> such as racial-, ethnic-, gender-, and class-based group membership. The preservice teachers exhibited high levels of ethnocentrism and often lived out attitudes of white privilege. Their interactions with other cultures proved complex and sometimes contradictory. They promoted learning about other cultures as a way to reduce prejudice and discrimination and believed that they had a responsibility as future teachers to help their students understand other cultures. They saw our semester long theme of <b>cultural</b> <b>identities</b> as valuable, and highlighted using multiple avenues to explore the theme, such as multicultural children's literature, mapping, written and sketched reflections, and literature discussions. This study emphasized the need for considerations of cultural issues to be integrated throughout the teacher education program. Preservice teachers need to understand their own <b>cultural</b> <b>identities</b> before they can understand their students as cultural beings. Explorations of whiteness and white privilege also need to occur...|$|R
5|$|Many {{of these}} forms of {{assimilation}} are still at work today. For example, when a central authority nationalizes one language, that attaches economic and social advantages to the prestige language. As generations pass, use of the indigenous language often fades or disappears, and linguistic and <b>cultural</b> <b>identity</b> recede as well. However, some groups are seeking to revive their indigenous identities. One important political aspect of this pursuit is petitioning the government for official recognition as a separate and distinct ethnic group.|$|E

This article examines this supposed clash and {{suggests that it is}} possible to frame a human rights approach in such a way that it becomes the starting point and constraining framework for all non-deficient <b>cultural</b> <b>identities.</b> In other words, it is possible to depict human rights in a culturally sensitive way so that universal human rights can meet the demands of a moderate version of meta-ethical relativism which acknowledges a small universal core of objectively true or false moral statements and avers that, beyond that small core, all other moral statements are neither objectively true nor false...|$|R

5|$|Although early {{assertions of}} a {{distinct}} Mangalorean Catholic identity {{date from the}} migration period, a developed Mangalorean Catholic <b>cultural</b> <b>identity</b> only emerged following the captivity.

After migration, they adopted some aspects of the local Mangalorean culture, but retained many of their Goan customs and traditions, and like their Goan ancestors, modern Mangalorean Catholic culture can be best described as an increasingly Anglicised Indo-Latin culture. The Mangalorean Catholic diaspora is mostly concentrated in the Arab states of the Persian Gulf and the English-speaking world.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} how the valence of cultural cues {{in the environment}} moderates the way biculturals shift between multiple <b>cultural</b> <b>identities.</b> The authors found that when exposed to positive cultural cues, biculturals who perceive their <b>cultural</b> <b>identities</b> as compatible (high bicultural identity integration, or high BII) respond in culturally congruent ways, whereas biculturals who perceive their <b>cultural</b> <b>identities</b> as conflicting (low BII) respond in culturally incongruent ways. The opposite was true for negative cultural cues. These results show that both high and low BIIs can exhibit culturally congruent or incongruent behaviors, and have implications for understanding situations where high and low BIIs might adapt differently...|$|R

40|$|English {{language}} Literacy {{education has}} recently {{focused attention on}} <b>cultural</b> <b>identity(s).</b> In these studies, <b>cultural</b> <b>identities</b> are defined as a significant “source of meaning and experience” constructed by and connected to {{the social context of}} the external world. More precisely, <b>cultural</b> <b>identities</b> are constructed by increasingly complexities of what construct literacy and multi literate practices in 21 century as a constantly changing socially and culturally diverse, globalized and technological era. This view can open a new horizon to English language literacy education in the new era which is supposed to go beyond merely 4 -skill dominant pedagogical orthodoxy. The current study as a qualitative case study framed in New London Group focuses on how literacy practices and consequently <b>cultural</b> <b>identities</b> are constructed in an Iranian EFL classroom. To do so, we applied a critical classroom discourse analysis as the main technique of data collection. Results of this study can enrich the research literature in new literacy studies in which EFL contexts are still less visible...|$|R
5|$|As an example, the {{execution}} scene in The Kingdom of This World puts European and autochthonous cultures in opposition {{through the use}} of the spectator-performer relationship. In this spectacle situation, Carpentier is able to juxtapose the Europeans' experience of Macandal's body falling into the flames with the autochthonous (Afro-Haitian) experience of Macandal's body flying off the stake. Through the different, mutable views of the performance that he creates, Carpentier is able to represent an unstable <b>cultural</b> <b>identity.</b> As a second example, the scene that Ti Noel constructs around himself after the sacking of the Sans-Souci Palace presents the reader with a dramatic rehearsal in which Ti Noel represents culturally mobile subjectivity by performing different identities on his own.|$|E
5|$|For centuries, Taiwan's {{aboriginal}} inhabitants experienced economic {{competition and}} military conflict {{with a series}} of colonising newcomers. Centralised government policies designed to foster language shift and cultural assimilation, as well as continued contact with the colonisers through trade, intermarriage and other intercultural processes, have resulted in varying degrees of language death and loss of original <b>cultural</b> <b>identity.</b> For example, of the approximately 26 known languages of the Taiwanese aborigines (collectively referred to as the Formosan languages), at least ten are now extinct, five are moribund and several are to some degree endangered. These languages are of unique historical significance, since most historical linguists consider Taiwan to be the original homeland of the Austronesian language family.|$|E
