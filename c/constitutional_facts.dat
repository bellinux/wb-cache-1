Congress {{has not been able}} to destroy the army, in the present war, though it did its best to attain that end; and all because the nucleus was too {{powerful}} to be totally eclipsed by the gas of the usual legislative tail of the Great National Comet, of which neither the materials nor the orbit can any man say he knows. One day, it declares war with a hurrah; the next, it denies the legislation necessary to carry it on, as if it distrusted its own acts, and already repented of its patriotism. And this is the body, soulless, the very school of faction, as a whole of very questionable quality in the outset, that, according to certain expounders of the constitution, is to perform all the functions of a government; which is not only to pass laws, but is to interpret them; which is to command the army, aye, even to wheeling its platoons; which reads the constitution as an abbe mumbles his aves and paters, or looking at everything but his texts; and which is never to have its acts vetoed, unless in cases where the Supreme Court would spare the Executive that trouble. We never yet could see either the elements or the fruits of this great sanctity in the National Council. In our eyes it is scarcely ever in its proper place on the railway of the Union, has degenerated into a mere electioneering machine, performing the little it really does convulsively, by sudden impulses, equally without deliberation or a sense of responsibility. In a word, we deem it the power of all others in the state that needs the closest watching, and were we what is termed in this country [...] "politicians," [...] we should go for the executive who is the most ready to apply the curb to these vagaries of faction and interested partisans! Vetoes. Would to Heaven we could see the days of Good Queen Bess revived for one session of Congress at least, and find that more laws were sent back for the second thoughts of their framers than were approved! Then, indeed, might the country be brought back to a knowledge of the very material <b>constitutional</b> <b>facts</b> that the legislature is not commander- in-chief, does not negotiate or make treaties, and has no right to do that which it has done so often--appoint to office by act of Congress.|$|E
40|$|Facts play an {{essential}} role in constitutional cases, ranging from giving meaning to the text’s words to giving those words operational effect. Yet the Supreme Court does not take facts seriously, preferring to see them as a constituent part of doctrine. The Court does not find facts, it interprets them to conform to, or buttress, conclusions reached on other grounds. This constructive view of facts has the salutary effect of consistency, in that doctrine need not change as facts, or our knowledge of the facts, change. This consistency comes at a cost, however, for doctrine built on erroneous factual premises lacks legitimacy. In this Article, I provide a theoretical justification for an empirically enlightened constitutional jurisprudence and a framework through which such a jurisprudence might be practiced. Along the way, I set forth a taxonomy of <b>constitutional</b> <b>facts,</b> consider how different kinds of <b>constitutional</b> <b>facts</b> might be proven, and examine the responsibilities and capacities of different constitutional fact-finders, including juries, Congress, and the Supreme Court.

40|$|This essay reviews David L. Faigman’s Constitutional Fictions: A Unified Theory of <b>Constitutional</b> <b>Facts</b> (Oxford U. P. 2008). Constitutional Fictions is {{a highly}} {{original}} book that promises to (and should) have {{an enormous impact on}} both constitutional law scholarship and practice. The book focuses on the methods, or lack thereof, that the Court employs in receiving evidence and resolving disagreements about questions of fact in constitutional cases. In doing so, the book does the legal profession an invaluable service by identifying and articulating the many frequently unspoken questions that arise in the context of judicial consideration and resolution of legislative facts in constitutional cases. The book also documents the largely unremarked ubiquity of these questions, the wide variety of circumstances in which they occur, and the depth of the theoretical issues they implicate. Professor Faigman accomplishes all this in crisp, lucid, and admirably concise prose. Nor could Professor Faigman’s book be more timely. Several of the Roberts Court’s most salient and controversial constitutional decisions have turned on questions of legislative fact. Constitutional Fictions treats an important topic with impressive insight. But it will not be the last word on the subject. When Constitutional Fictions finally comes round to normative and prescriptive analysis of the status quo, Faigman shies away from the broader implications of his critique. After reviewing Professor Faigman’s arguments, this review essay explores how alternative analyses might compel more sweeping changes than he suggests...|$|E
40|$|Central bank {{independence}} {{has become}} over {{time one of}} the key concepts in modern theory and policy. Most economists agree that central bank independence is desirable because it helps achieving and maintaining the long â€“ term goal of price stability. Although one might think about alternative mechanisms to reach lower inflation rates, central bank independence is clearly the most often recomended. The empirical trends upon a more independent central bank with a more transparent and accountable monetary policy regime has emerged in economic literature regarding central banking and monetary economics. In recent years, starting from the Maastricht Treaty central bank independence has become the panacea of the monetary economics and monetary policy approaches. Moreover it is important to analyze and assess the impact of this key issue in central banking upon the inflation performances of the central banks. In this article we provide a qualitative overview upon some recent trends in the central bank independence field: does it still matter? How can be it evaluate and stress itâ€™s impact upon macroeconomic performances, especially upon inflation. As we can observe in the economic literature upon central bank independence there are several approaches to use several indices in order to measure this qualitative and quatitative institutional variables. The most important debate is to eliminate the gap between de jure and de facto independence in order to flatten the measuring of institutional aspects, the legal implication, the <b>constitutional</b> <b>facts</b> and the actual practices of the central banks. Finally, we suggest that according to the new index for measuring central bank independence and inflation targeting index we can evaluate more accurate the degree of the de jure and de facto independence and stress the impact on inflation performance with a case study for ten developed countries and ten developing countries...|$|E
40|$|A panel, at the National Lawyers Convention, {{discussed}} procedure as {{it relates}} to First Amendment rights. The panel set forth how First Amendment procedures have historically protected First Amendment substance and discussed modern applications of the issue. For example, the prior restraint doctrine, overbreadth doctrine, the allocation of the burden of proof and relaxation of ripeness rules have important implications for challenging restrictions on speech and defending against libel and defamation. The interaction of free speech and due process is often seen in litigation involving civil harassment orders, or civil protection orders. In many jurisidictions the definition of harassment permits the finding that harassment can be based solely on speech, meaning speech itself can provide a basis for liabilty. In addition, speech may be restricted as a remedy in litigation addressing harassment. Investigations of wrongdoing in the realm of campaign finance law and political speech cases can also have serious implications for speech, both reputational and legal. Further cases involving political speech and campaign finance once exclusively litigated in the civil arena, are now the subject of criminal investigations and prosecutions. This is particularly problematic where many issues in this area remain unsettled. Good lawyering is particularly important in First Amendment cases. Ineffective assistance of counsel can be considered as great an evil in First Amendment cases as in criminal cases. Unfortunately, practicing lawyers often do not understand the process by which <b>constitutional</b> <b>facts</b> are pleaded and proved in First Amendment cases and this problem begins with the way Constitutional Law 101 is taught in law schools. In proving facts in First Amendment litigation the question becomes how does the government prove its justification of a restriction on speech or how does one opposing the government’s restriction on speech respond when the government asserts certain interests as being their justification. In First Amendment litigation the government often relies on legislative facts – newspaper reports, television stories, and criminal cases discussed in the media, arguably the government should be obligated to present more than rumors and speculation...|$|E

40|$|I {{share with}} Fred Schauer the {{relatively}} unpopular {{belief that the}} positivist insistence that we keep separate the legal 2 ̆ 2 is 2 ̆ 2 from the legal 2 ̆ 2 ought 2 ̆ 2 is a logical prerequisite to meaningful legal criticism, and therefore, in the constitutional context, is a logical prerequisite to meaningful criticism of the Constitution. As Schauer argues, despite the modern inclination to associate positivism with conservatism, the positivist 2 ̆ 2 separation thesis, 2 ̆ 2 properly understood, facilitates legal criticism and legal reform, not reactionary acquiescence. If we want to improve law, we must {{resist the urge to}} see it through the proverbial rose-colored glasses; we must be clear that a norm 2 ̆ 7 s legality implies nothing about its morality. To reverse the classical natural lawyer 2 ̆ 7 s formulation of the issue, if we wish to make our laws just, we must first see that many of our laws are unjust, and if we are to understand that simple truth, we must understand that the legality of those norms implies nothing about their justice. Surely the lessons of positivism are more compelling, not less compelling, in the constitutional context where the capacity for self-delusion is so great, given the moralistic content and peculiar history of the Constitution, and where the stakes are highest: the consequences of merging <b>constitutional</b> <b>fact</b> with <b>constitutional</b> virtue are that we preclude even the logical possibility of fundamental criticism of our most foundational legal document. As I have argued at some length elsewhere, by merging in our own minds and in the public mind 2 ̆ 2 constitutional morality 2 ̆ 2 and critical morality, we have closed the door to meaningful criticism of the Constitution. The positivist 2 ̆ 7 s classic and even enlightened insistence on the 2 ̆ 2 separation 2 ̆ 2 of law and morality, if it would free up criticism of constitutional norms, could bring a welcome breath of fresh air. Today, 2 ̆ 2 legal positivism 2 ̆ 2 is widely taken to imply not just a conservative stance against legal change, but much worse: a refusal even to engage the issue, a denial of the coherence of legal criticism, and a denial of the relevance, in some sense, of legal reform. Given the historical grounding of positivism in an insistence on the need for legal criticism and legal reform, this modern belief about the reactionary consequences of legal positivism is strikingly peculiar: how did black become white? Where did this belief, so widely shared yet so wildly at odds with both the clear history and the apparent logic of legal positivism, come from? In these comments I want to supplement Fred Schauer 2 ̆ 7 s discussion and general defense of positivism with a brief response, in a sense, to Cover 2 ̆ 7 s quite chilling indictment. I will ultimately argue that whatever the (limited) force of Cover 2 ̆ 7 s indictment of the positivism of the abolitionist judges, that argument has no force against the positivism of the nonjudge constitutional critic. The critic, unlike the judge, is interested in competing theories of the relationship between law and morality, not as a guide to legal interpretation, but rather as a guide to clear-headed legal criticism. The constitutional critic, almost by definition, will rarely if ever be a judge. For such a critic, contrary to contemporary opinion and for the reasons stressed by the classical positivists, positivism does indeed facilitate the kind of constitutional criticism that natural law thinking obscures...|$|R

As the main character of Schlink’s book struggles with the need to cope with his nation’s past and his own feelings towards the former Nazi guard Hanna, he hesitates endlessly about his career.

The German Constitutional Court's preliminary ruling on 12 September 2012, capping Germany's ESM risk exposure at 2 ̆ 0 ac 190 billion, has not rendered further examination of the topic irrelevant. Indeed, Germany's aggravated risk exposure bomb continues to tick, because EFSF funds have already been promised as guarantees for ailing states and {{they will continue to}} be used thusly. The article quantifies these risks, in addition to the Target II risk exposure, to confront the <b>Constitutional</b> Court with <b>facts</b> that it - consciously or unconsciously - ignored in its aforementioned ruling. If the Court had been more diligent or more open to financial expertise, the worst-case scenario of a near doubling of German public debt (from about 2 ̆ 0 ac 2 trillion to 2 ̆ 0 ac 3. 7 trillion) makes it hard to understand how the Court could have considered such risk compatible with its own postulate of sustained fiscal democracy...|$|R
40|$|Do {{we really}} need another law review article about foreign law in <b>constitutional</b> interpretation? In <b>fact,</b> we do. In the vast {{literature}} on the subject, a fundamental point has received scant attention. In the recent rulings that have stoked the present controversy, the Supreme Court has employed foreign law not as law, but rather merely as evidence of a legislative fact made relevant by domestic constitutional law. Commentators, however, have largely directed {{their attention to the}} merits of a genuine constitutional comparativism in which foreign law serves {{as a model for the}} creation of domestic constitutional doctrine. Many commentators have advocated just such an approach, and at least one sitting Justice has joined in this chorus in both extrajudicial commentary and in a dissenting opinion. But to date, the Court has yet to take this much-mooted step, perhaps due to an awareness of the complex theoretical challenges such an approach would raise. A few opponents to the Court 2 ̆ 7 s actual practice have forcefully observed that the Court 2 ̆ 7 s use of foreign law has lacked the rigor and impartiality that would be necessary to make it credible. What even these scholars have not done, and what this Article ventures, is to consider these claims within the broader context of the Court 2 ̆ 7 s use, and misuse, of all manner of evidence employed in connection with questions of legislative <b>fact</b> in <b>constitutional</b> adjudication...|$|R
40|$|In Coyote Publishing, Inc. v. Miller, the Ninth Circuit {{considered}} {{the constitutionality of}} a Nevada statute that regulates commercial advertising of legal brothels. The Ninth Circuit held that severe restrictions on brothel advertising, even in counties where brothels are legal, are valid under the First Amendment. The court concluded that Nevada Revised Statutes sections 201. 430 (1) and 201. 440, which largely prohibit the advertising of licensed brothels, met the four prongs of the Central Hudson test. Although the Ninth Circuit held that Nevada Revised Statutes section 201. 430 (1) was <b>constitutional,</b> the <b>facts</b> of the case {{did not apply to}} Nevada Revised Statutes section 201. 430 (2) and therefore the Ninth Circuit never addressed the constitutionality of this portion of the statute. Nevada Revised Statutes section 201. 430 (2) nevertheless facially restricts more than just purely commercial speech. Consequently, section 201. 430 (2) is over broad and should be subject to a strict scrutiny analysis, as opposed to the more moderate Central Hudson test. This Note discusses how Nevada Revised Statutes section 201. 430 (2) facially restricts more than just purely commercial speech and would fail strict scrutiny analysis. The Ninth Circuit in Coyote Publishing, Inc. v. Miller did not address the constitutionality of this section because {{the facts of the case}} pertained to advertising of licensed brothels, which is regulated by section 201. 430 (1), as opposed toadvertising of unlicensed brothels, which is regulated by section 201. 430 (2). Part I of this Note gives a brief history of prostitution, outlines the constitutionality of commercial speech regulations pursuant to the Central Hudson test and explains the Ninth Circuit’s reasoning in Coyote Publishing for concluding that Nevada Revised Statutes section 201. 430 (1) applies solely to commercial speech. Part II argues that although the Ninth Circuit held that Nevada Revised Statutes section 201. 430 (1) applies solely to commercial speech, section 201. 430 (2) should be invalidated by the doctrine of overbreadth because it regulates commercial as well as noncommercial speech. Finally, Part III proposes that a strict scrutiny analysis is the appropriate level of scrutiny to analyze Nevada Revised Statutes section 201. 430 (2). This Part also argues that section 201. 430 (2) would fail a strict scrutiny analysis because it is not narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling state interest...|$|R
