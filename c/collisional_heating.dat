50|$|Advances in laser {{technology}} have recently enabled {{the observation of}} self-focusing in the interaction of intense laser pulses with plasmas. Self-focusing in plasma can occur through thermal, relativistic and ponderomotive effects. Thermal self-focusing is due to <b>collisional</b> <b>heating</b> of a plasma exposed to electromagnetic radiation: the rise in temperature induces a hydrodynamic expansion which leads to an increase of the index of refraction and further heating.|$|E
40|$|The {{identification}} of the mechanism(s) responsible for heating asteroids is among the major problems in planetary science. Because of difficulties with models of electromagnetic induction and the decay of short-lived radionuclides, it is worthwhile to evaluate the evidence for <b>collisional</b> <b>heating.</b> New evidence for localized impact heating comes from the high proportion of relict type- 6 material among impact-melt-bearing ordinary chondrites (OC). This relict material was probably metamorphosed by residual heat within large craters. Olivine aggregates composed of faceted crystals with 120 deg triple junctions occur within the melted regions of the Chico and Rose City OC melt rocks; the olivine aggregates formed from shocked, mosaicized olivine grains that underwent contact metamorphism. Large-scale <b>collisional</b> <b>heating</b> is supoorted by the correlation in OC between petrologic type and shock stage; no other heating mechanism can readily account for this correlation. The occurrence of impact-melt-rock clasts in OC that have been metamorphosed along with their whole rocks indicates that some impact events preceded or accompanied thermal metamorphism. Such impacts events, occurring during or shortly after accretion, are probably responsible for substantially melting approximately 0. 5 % of OC. These events must have heated {{a larger percentage of}} OC to subsolidus temperatures sufficient to have caused significant metamorphism. If <b>collisional</b> <b>heating</b> is viable, then OC parent asteroids must have been large; large OC asteroids in the main belt may include those of the S(IV) spectral subtype. <b>Collisional</b> <b>heating</b> is inconsistent with layered ('onion-shell') structures in OC asteroids (wherein the degree of metamorphism increases with depth), but the evidence for such structures is weak. It seems likely that <b>collisional</b> <b>heating</b> {{played an important role in}} metamorphosing chondritic asteroids...|$|E
40|$|Nuclear and Coulomb {{collisions}} in GRB jets {{create a}} hot electron-positron plasma. This <b>collisional</b> <b>heating</b> starts when the jet is still opaque and {{extends to the}} transparent region. The e+- plasma radiates its energy. As a result, a large fraction of the jet energy is converted to escaping radiation with a well-defined spectrum. The process is simulated in detail using the known rates of collisions and accurate calculations of radiative transfer in the expanding jet. The result reproduces the spectra of observed GRBs that typically peak near 1 MeV and extend to much higher energies with a photon index β - 2. 5.

40|$|Abstract. The overlap of the ring-current {{with the}} outer {{plasmasphere}} {{is thought to}} play a major role in storm-time related increases in the sub-auroral ambient topside elec-tron temperature. Instabilities generated within the overlap region, Coulomb collisions of plasmaspheric electrons with the ring-current ions, and charge exchange are all thought to work either individually or together to generate a downward heat flux into the iono-sphere to produce the increase in temperature. Analysis of IMAGE 2 D ring current and plasmasphere density maps together with in-situ DMSP ambient electron temperature data shows that the heating generally occurs over a small radial extent within the plas-masphere / ring current overlap region and may be significantly earthward of the plasma-pause. This argues against <b>collisional</b> <b>heat</b> conduction as the source of the heat flux and for an instability based process.

In this paper, we report the use of centrally peaked electron heating and current drive to study transport in plasmas with negative central shear (NCS).

5000|$|His spectroscopic {{observations}} of the Orion nebula showed that the green nebular line is sharp, symmetrical and narrow and not ‘fluted’ under examination with several spectroscopes and magnifications with the 16½ inch telescope, thus putting the ‘meteoric hypothesis’ of the nebulae by Norman Lockyer to the sword. According to this hypothesis, the lines arise from <b>collisional</b> <b>heat</b> of the meteoric particles, and require the nebular line to be fluted (extended or shaded like molecular bands-the likely molecular band at this wavelength is that of MgO). Even before Naegamvala’s observations, others, notably Huggins, Vogeland, and James Keeler at Lick showed the lines to be sharp, {{there was still a}} major controversy. As Osterbrock says [...] "although Keeler’s paper convinced most of his contemporaries, Lockyer and his partisans could not accept the result, and {{at a meeting of the}} Royal Astronomical Society on 8 May 1891, with neither Huggins nor Lockyer present, an argument welled up. It began with the reading of a paper from K.D.Naegamvala of Poonah, India, who had been observing the Orion nebula with his 16½-inch telescope and three prism spectroscope and found that the chief nebular line was sharp under all circumstances, and therefore not the remnant of magnesium fluting, as Lockyer had suggested. Captain William Noble, a friend and partisan of Huggins, rose and smoothly congratulated Naegamvala, through the Secretary who had read the paper." [...] Noble is supposed to have said [...] "The theory (meteoric)... has been already three times killed by Dr Huggins in England, Dr Vogel in Germany and Professor Keeler at Lick observatory, and I think that we must look on Mr Naegamvala as having finally killed and buried it".

40|$|An {{investigation}} of collisionality's role in turbulent transport in magnetized plasma using the GS 2 gyrokinetic simulation software is presented. The investigation {{consists of three}} parts, conducted by way of numerical modeling: 1) input calibration using the conditions and results of a reference {{investigation of}} a different parameter's influence on turbulence, 2) direct variation of electron-electron and ion-ion collisionality parameters, and 3) comparison between results calculated with the inclusion and exclusion of an additional <b>collisional</b> <b>heating</b> term. The calibration exercise demonstrates reliable agreement between results obtained in the present investigation and those obtained in other studies, the variation of collisionality parameters suggests a stronger dependence of ITG-driven turbulence on electron-electron collisionality than on ion-ion collisionality, and {{the evaluation of the}} <b>collisional</b> <b>heating</b> diagnostic shows a diminished influence of collisional heat drive on turbulent transport as this parameter increases. Several significant changes in some steady-state turbulent fluxes are observed at certain "threshold" values of electron-electron or ion-ion collisionality (e. g. time-averaged particle flux changing sign twice as the normalized electron-electron collisionality parameter varies between 0 and 2. 5) as well as a lack of correspondence between steady-state heat, momentum and particle flux changes. These seemingly unrelated sensitivities to different ranges of collisionality parameters suggest different drives for these different transport quantities, implying a complex relationship between collisionality and turbulent heat, momentum, and particle transport of which a deeper understanding is fundamental to the design and performance of magnetic fusion projects. by Martin L.

If the Ly-alpha luminosity is used as a measure of L(UV), a weak dependence of Ly-alpha/H-alpha on the X-ray luminosity is found (valid at the 94 percent confidence level), similar to previous results.
