40|$|Advanced marine design, {{particularly}} in the United States, advocates the use of cross-functional design teams, or Integrated Product Teams (IPT’s), who will undertake a concurrent engineering approach to all phases of ship design. Further, {{the study of the}} world-class Toyota automotive design process has highlighted the potential of a set-based design approach in concurrent engineering to provide a greater probability of achieving a global optimum for the overall design. A hybrid humancomputer agent approach is introduced to facilitate set-based conceptual ship design by a crossfunctional team of naval architects and marine engineers. The disciplinary/technical specialists are organized and tasked as agents within a design network that can be either be co-located or interconnected across the web. Computer agents are introduced between each pair of human design agents to facilitate their communication and negotiation. A systematic market approach, developed in the Defense Advance Research Projects Agency (DARPA) sponsored Responsible Agents for Product-Process Integrated Design (RAPPID) project, was utilized as an initial approach to facilitate this team, set-based design. The conceptual design of a hatch-covered, cellular, <b>feeder</b> <b>container</b> <b>ship</b> was undertaken by a team of student design agents to assess the effectiveness of this design approach.

40|$|A fast sail {{assisted}} <b>feeder</b> <b>container</b> <b>ship</b> {{concept has}} been developed for the 2020 container market in the South East Asian and Caribbean regions. The design presented has met the requirements of an initial economic study, with a cargo capacity of 1270 twenty-foot equivalent unit containers, meeting the predictions of container throughput derived from historical data. In determining suitable vessel dimensions, account has also been taken for port and berthing restrictions, and considering hydrodynamic performance. The vessel has been designed for a maximum speed of 25 knots, allowing it {{to meet the demand}} for trade whilst reducing the number of ships operating on the routes considered. The design development of the fast feeder concept has involved rigorous analyses {{in a number of areas}} to improve the robustness of the final design. Model testing has been key to the development of the concept, by increasing confidence in the final result. This is due to the fact that other analysis techniques are not always appropriate or accurate. Two hull forms have been developed to meet requirements whilst utilising different propulsor combinations. This has enabled evaluation of efficiency gains resulting from different hydrodynamic phenomena for each design. This includes an evaluation of the hydrodynamic performance when utilising the sail system. This has been done using a combination of model test results and data from regression analysis. The final propulsor chosen is a contra-rotating podded drive arrangement. Wind tunnel testing has been used to maximise the performance of a Multi-wing sail system by investigating the effects of wing spacing, stagger and sail-container interactions. This has led to an increase in lift coefficient of 32 % from initial predictions. The savings in power requirement due to the sail system are lower than initially predicted. However, another benefit of their installation, motion damping, has been identified. Whilst this has not been fully investigated, additional fuel savings are possible as well as improved seakeeping performance. The design is shown to be environmentally sustainable when compared to existing vessels operating on the proposed routes. This is largely due to the use of low-carbon and zero-sulphur fuel (liquefied natural gas) and improvements in efficiency regarding operation. This especially relates to cargo handling and scheduling. Green house gas emissions have been predicted to fall by 42 % and 40 % in the two regions should the design be adopted. These savings are also due to the use of the Multi-wing sail system, which contributes to reductions in power requirement of up to 6 % when the vessel operates at its lower speed of 15 knots. It is demonstrated that the fast feeder is also economically feasible, with predicted daily cost savings of 27 % and 33 % in the South East Asian and Caribbean regions respectively. Thus the fast <b>feeder</b> <b>container</b> <b>ship</b> concept is a viable solution for the future of container transhipment. <br/...|$|R

In response to this challenge an environmentally sustainable feeder-container ship concept has been developed for the 2020 container market. The concept utilises higher speed and larger capacity than typical <b>feeder</b> <b>ships,</b> whilst halving the fleet size. The use of low-carbon and zero-sulphur fuel (liquefied natural gas) and improvements in operational efficiency (cargo handling and scheduling) mean predicted Greenhouse gas emissions should fall by 42 % and 40 % in the two selected operational regions. The predicted daily cost savings are respectively 27 % and 33 % in South East Asian and the Caribbean. A Multi-wing sail system also contributes to these savings whilst providing the additional benefit of motion damping. Propulsion and manoeuvrability is provided through a contra-rotating podded drive. Performance predictions have been made based on physical testing of both hull form and sail system. Use of ship-borne gantry cranes and the podded based manoeuvrability permit reduced times in port, thus improving operational efficiency. A typical round trip voyage has been simulated taking into account: realistic wind and wave environment data; physical model testing data and a representative operational profile including port operations.

In the scenarios three factors where changed: time in port, transit time and the average speed on the sea legs. For calculating the port times and transit times in the two scenarios, a benchmark approach was used. The scenario results were looked at with the use of three parameters for making sea transport a more attractive choice of transport: lead time, cost and flexibility. This showed that with the improvements the sea transport can become a more attractive mode of transport. The findings show that the feeder lines can reduce their route trip time, with the improvements in the three factors.

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this paper is to suggest the {{possibility}} of modal shift by developing a mobile harbor (MH) with a container crane on board for container transport. As per the technical specification of MH, it has 8 ∼ 15 knots speed, 250 TEU laden capacity, 4 meters draft, 92 meters LOA, 26 meters breadth, 30 moves handling rate capacity per hour. With this specification, the strong point of MH is to reduce port time of the mother ship by implementing a cross-docking handling system alongside the mother <b>ship</b> or <b>feeder</b> <b>ship.</b> Furthermore, due to the crane on board, the berthing place will be expanded, i. e. MH is able to approach general cargo handling berth without a dedicated quay crane. The paper concludes that MH may be used as a useful modal shift tool. The transit distance of 100 nautical miles is a decisive point to win the road mode regardless of the ship's speed. If the distance is more than 100 nautical miles, mobile harbor has the competitive advantage in pulling cargo from road transportation mode. Even though the result of analysis shows a positive signal for modal shift, the real situation does not go that way. That means modal shift has several attributes applicable to the real world...|$|R
