50|$|The {{arrangement}} {{consisted of}} a self-aligning spherical roller (ball) bearing at the pinion end and a parallel roller bearing at the <b>commutator</b> <b>end</b> of the traction motor. The bearings were grease-lubricated and were carried in a split cannon box to which the traction motor was attached by means of two clamps which engaged cylindrically-machined seatings {{on the outside of}} the housing. The roller-type suspension bearings required little attention other than the replenishment of the grease when the wheels were removed for tyre-turning.|$|E

Introduction: The {{rotary converter}} {{as a practical}} element in the transmission of power is a machine of comparatively recent date. Among the first practical converters noted was one exhibited at the Frankfort Exposition of 1891. This machine was of the flat ring, Schuckert make, fitted with four collecting rings outside of the bearing at the <b>commutator</b> <b>end.</b> This machine was operated successfully in its manifold and diverse functions. The rapid growth of the converter and its extension into a large field of usefulness has taken place during the past eight years. A brief comparison of its growth will be mentioned later in this discussion...|$|E

Shortcomings are addressed and new perspectives given. Comment: 34 pages, no figures; invited contribution to the symposium on "Threshold meson production in pp and pd interaction", extended COSY- 11 collaboration meeting, Cracow, Poland, June 20 - 24, 2001; final correction: two anticommutators replaced by <b>commutators</b> at the <b>end</b> of section...|$|R
40|$|In {{the current}} article we study {{structure}} of a Chevalley group $G(R) $ over a commutative ring $R$. We generalize and improve the following results: (1) standard, relative, and multi-relative commutator formulas; (2) nilpotent structure of [relative] $K_ 1 $; (3) bounded word length of <b>commutators.</b> To this <b>end</b> we enlarge the elementary group, construct a generic element for the extended elementary group, and use localization in the universal ring. The key step is a construction of a generic element for a principle congruence subgroup, corresponding to a principle ideal...|$|R
50|$|A {{motor-generator}} set, {{mainly of}} historical interest, {{consists of an}} electric motor and generator coupled together. A dynamotor combines both functions into a single unit with coils for both the motor and the generator functions wound around a single rotor; both coils share the same outer field coils or magnets. Typically the motor coils are driven from a <b>commutator</b> on one <b>end</b> of the shaft, when the generator coils output to another commutator {{on the other end}} of the shaft. The entire rotor and shaft assembly is smaller in size than a pair of machines, and may not have any exposed drive shafts.|$|R
40|$|AbstractA well-designed runner and {{gating system}} is very {{important}} to produce good quality die castings by providing a homogenous mould filling pattern. Flow analysis of the component is done in order to visibly analyse the cavity filling process. In this study, a <b>Commutator</b> <b>End</b> (CE) bracket, a cold chamber die casted product was chosen. Initially when the component was casted numerous defects such as Cold shuts, Misrun, Shrinkage porosity and Gas porosity were found. This in turn led to rejection of number of components. In order {{to improve the quality of}} the castings produced, the gating system was changed from the existing flat gate to modified spoon fed gate. The component was designed using Pro- Engineer and flow analysis was carried out using Rotork Flow 3 D Software. The process parameters like metal temperature, fill velocity and filling time are considered for optimizing the process. Quality assessment for the die casting parts was made by microstructure analysis...|$|E
50|$|While a {{motor-generator}} set may consist of distinct motor and generator machines coupled together, a single unit dynamotor (for dynamo-motor) has the motor coils and the generator coils wound around a single rotor; both the motor and generator therefore {{share the same}} outer field coils or magnets. Typically the motor coils are driven from a <b>commutator</b> on one <b>end</b> of the shaft, while the generator coils provide output to another commutator {{on the other end}} of the shaft. The entire rotor and shaft assembly is smaller, lighter, and cheaper than a pair of machines, and does not require exposed drive shafts.|$|R
