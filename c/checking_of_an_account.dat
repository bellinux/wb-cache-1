40|$|Many governments block their citizens’ {{access to}} much of the Internet. Simple workarounds are unreliable; censors quickly {{discover}} and patch them. Previously proposed robust approaches either have non-trivial obstacles to deployment, or rely on low-performance covert channels that cannot support typical Internet usage such as streaming video. We present Salmon, an incrementally deployable system designed to resist a censor with the resources of the “Great Firewall” of China. Salmon relies on <b>a</b> network <b>of</b> volunteers in uncensored countries to run proxy servers. Although any member of the public can become a user, Salmon protects the bulk of its servers from being discovered and blocked by the censor via an algorithm for quickly identifying malicious users. The algorithm entails identifying some users as especially trustworthy or suspicious, based on their actions. We impede Sybil attacks by requiring either <b>an</b> unobtrusive <b>check</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> social network <b>account,</b> or <b>a</b> referral from a trustworthy user...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} formal model for {{qualitative}} spatial reasoning with cardinal directions utilizing a co-ordinate system.

We introduce the first algorithm for this problem, prove its correctness and analyze its computational complexity. Using the above algorithm, we {{prove that the}} consistency <b>checking</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> set <b>of</b> basic (i. e., non-disjunctive) cardinal direction constraints can be performed in O(n 5) time. We also show that the consistency <b>checking</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> set <b>of</b> unrestricted (i. e., disjunctive and non-disjunctive) cardinal direction constraints is N P-complete. Finally, we briefly discuss an extension to the basic model and outline an algorithm for the consistency <b>checking</b> problem <b>of</b> this extension. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} novel highly {{sensitive}} wave front detection method for <b>a</b> quick <b>check</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> flat wave front by taking advantage <b>of</b> <b>a</b> non-zero-order pi phase plate that yields a non-zero-order diffraction pattern. When a light beam {{with a flat}} wave front illuminates a phase plate, the zero-order intensity is zero. When there is <b>a</b> slight distortion <b>of</b> the wave front, the zero-order intensity increases. The ratio of first-order intensity to that of zero-order intensity is used as the criterion with which to judge whether the wave front under test is flat, eliminating the influence of background light. Experimental results demonstrate that this method is efficient, robust, and cost-effective and should be highly interesting for <b>a</b> quick <b>check</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> flat wave front <b>of</b> <b>a</b> large-aperture laser beam and adaptive optical systems.
