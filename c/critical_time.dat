Some of these trips included shuttling three men per plane {{back and forth to}} Guantanamo Bay, including the pilot, co-pilot, and the photographer. He was awarded the Air Medal.|$|E
5|$|The British {{authorities}} in the area refused to support the raid, which they considered a breach of Spanish neutrality. Permission for the operation to go ahead eventually came from the Foreign Office in London. On 14 January 1942, while the ships' officers were attending a party arranged by an SOE agent, the commandos entered the port aboard two tugs, overpowered the ships' crews and sailed off with the ships, including the Italian merchant vessel Duchessa d'Aosta. The raid boosted SOE's reputation at a <b>critical</b> <b>time</b> and demonstrated its ability to plan and conduct secret operations no matter the political consequences.|$|E

The 5th Mounted Brigade had been completely surprised; its commander and his important reserve force {{had been out of}} position at a <b>critical</b> <b>time</b> following false intelligence, and could not support his regiments.

40|$|Problem statement: Most of {{synchronous}} generator applied in power {{system is the}} salient pole type. Most of previous researches use non-salient model to evaluate the <b>critical</b> clearing <b>time.</b> Thus the results of <b>critical</b> clearing <b>time</b> of power system may be error. Approach: Thus this paper investigate the <b>critical</b> clearing <b>time</b> of power system with synchronous machine. The mathematical model of non-salient pole and salient pole synchronous machine model in power system are symmetrically derived. The <b>critical</b> clearing <b>time</b> of both models are tested and compared on various cases. Results: The <b>critical</b> clearing <b>time</b> of the power system with synchronous including saliency is slightly higher that of non saliency model. Conclusion: It is found from simulation results that even swing curve of both models is obviously different. Their <b>critical</b> clearing <b>times</b> are slightly different...|$|R

5|$|After {{resting on}} their arms through the night, the 21st awoke to light {{fighting}} in their front. Over {{the course of}} the morning, Union forces gradually shifted to the left, including the 21st, and it became apparent that the Union right flank had collapsed. Meanwhile, Lee's forces had joined Jackson's and were pressing the Union left flank with a massive and rapid assault. Pope's entire army was soon in retreat. Ferrero's brigade was moved by Brig. Gen. Reno to a position on Henry House Hill to cover the Union retreat along the Centreville Turnpike. The brigade, with the 21st in the center, successfully held off Confederate advances from 7 to , buying <b>critical</b> <b>time</b> for the Union army. Finally, under the cover of darkness, the brigade quietly retired across Bull Run. During this defeat for the Union army, the 21st suffered light casualties of seven wounded, or two percent.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, Shashthi came to {{represent}} all goddesses and forces responsible for causing diseases {{in children and}} their mothers, who needed to be propitiated on the sixth day after childbirth to prevent these illnesses. Consequently, Shashthi came to personify the sixth day of a child's life. The sixth day of the lunar fortnight is itself called Shashti, a name derived from {{the name of the}} goddess. The Yajnavalkya Smriti, composed during Gupta rule between the 3rd and 5th centuries CE, describes the rites of Shashthi Puja in which Shashthi is worshipped on the sixth day after childbirth to ensure the protection of the newborn baby. According to one explanation for the worship of Shashthi on this day, folk belief associates this <b>critical</b> <b>time</b> in an infant's life with great susceptibility to diseases related to childbirth, such as puerperal fever and tetanus, and that worship of Shashthi is performed to help ward off these diseases.|$|E
5|$|Fighting {{in support}} of the Nam River front in the {{northern}} part of the 25th Division sector were five batteries of the 159th and 64th Field Artillery Battalions, firing 105mm howitzers, and one battery of the 90th Field Artillery Battalion which fired 155mm howitzers, for a total of 36 guns. One 155mm howitzer fired from Komam-ni to the area north of Chungam-ni, the route for the NK 6th Division's supplies. Another forward artillery piece kept the Iryong-ni bridge over the Nam under fire. The 25th Division artillery estimated it killed approximately 1,825 North Korean soldiers during the first three days of September. In this <b>critical</b> <b>time,</b> the US Fifth Air Force added its firepower to that of the division artillery {{in support of}} the ground force. Walker attributed the UN victory in this sector directly to the extensive air support his division received in the battle.|$|E

5|$|Niels Bohr {{and his son}} Aage, a {{physicist}} who acted as his father's assistant, arrived on 30 December {{on the first of}} several visits as a consultant. Bohr and his family had escaped from occupied Denmark to Sweden. A De Havilland Mosquito bomber brought him to England where he joined Tube Alloys. In America, he was able to visit Oak Ridge and Los Alamos, where he found many of his former students. Bohr acted as a critic, a facilitator and a role model for younger scientists. He arrived at a <b>critical</b> <b>time,</b> and several nuclear fission studies and experiments were conducted at his instigation. He {{played an important role in}} the development of the uranium tamper, and in the design and adoption of the modulated neutron initiator.

Promoted to wing commander on 1 July 1947, his next posting was as the senior instructor on the leadership course at Digby, Lincolnshire. Subsequently, he was appointed station commander at Wattisham, Suffolk. He was promoted to group captain on 1 January 1954. Edwards was the Station Commander of the RAF base RAF Habbaniya in Iraq during the Suez Crisis of 1956, and also the <b>critical</b> <b>time</b> of the Iraqi Revolution of 14 July 1958.

5|$|Tank was a {{commercial}} success and {{is credited with}} buoying the finances of the newly merged Atari at a <b>critical</b> <b>time</b> for the company. It sold over 10,000 units, considered a large hit at the time, though Ralph H. Baer claims that was only the 1974 sales, with a further 5,000 sold in 1975. Atari produced a second version of the game, a cocktail cabinet form {{in which the two}} players sat across a circular table from each other. A sequel, Tank II, was released in 1974 to sales of around 1,000 units; gameplay was identical, though the maze could be changed to a new format by modifying the circuitry and more sound effects were added. It was followed by three further sequels: Tank III in 1975, the first game to be third in a series; the color Tank 8 in 1976, which featured eight tanks and players simultaneously; and Ultra Tank in 1978, which reverted to a two-player black and white game with the ability to select multiple different maze types and have invisible tanks.|$|E

5|$|The British mission {{consisting}} of Akers and fifteen British experts arrived in December 1943. This was a <b>critical</b> <b>time.</b> Severe problems had been encountered with the Norris-Adler barrier. Nickel powder and electro-deposited nickel mesh diffusion barriers were pioneered by American chemist Edward Adler and British interior decorator Edward Norris at the SAM Laboratories. A decision {{had to be}} made whether to persevere with it or switch to a powdered nickel barrier based upon British technology that had been developed by Kellex. Up to this point, both were under development. The SAM Laboratory had 700 people working on gaseous diffusion and Kellex had about 900. The British experts conducted a thorough review, and agreed that the Kellex barrier was superior, but felt that it would be unlikely to be ready in time. Kellex's technical director, Percival C. Keith, disagreed, arguing that his company could get it ready and produce it more quickly than the Norris-Adler barrier. Groves listened to the British experts before he formally adopted the Kellex barrier on 5 January 1944.|$|E

In all first-class cricket he scored 789 runs, averaging 56.35, with an innings of 281 not out the highest of his three centuries. The four-Test series, which England lost 2–1, was another matter. Wisden noted that the West Indian pace attack, considered {{the best in the}} world by Bob Wyatt, unsettled the English batsmen; the home bowlers were accused of intimidation by some of the England side. Hammond had a top score of 47 and scored 175 runs at an average of 25.00. He played well in difficult batting conditions, which he believed were among the worst he ever faced, in the first Test.
