5|$|According to Atlury Murali, Indian <b>Congress</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1920s {{appealed to}} Andhra Pradesh peasants by {{creating}} Telugu language plays that combined Indian mythology and legends, linked them to Gandhi's ideas, and portrayed Gandhi as a messiah, a reincarnation of ancient and medieval Indian nationalist leaders and saints. The plays built support among peasants steeped in traditional Hindu culture, according to Murali, and this effort made Gandhi a folk hero in Telugu speaking villages, a sacred messiah-like figure.|$|E

5|$|After a {{bruising}} primary {{battle with}} another incumbent whose district was combined with his, in which McEwen faced charges of bouncing checks on the House bank, he narrowly lost the 1992 general election to Democrat Ted Strickland. Following an unsuccessful {{run in the}} adjacent Second District in 1993, McEwen was largely absent from the Ohio political scene for a decade, until in 2005 he unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination for <b>Congress</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Second District special election to replace Rob Portman, who beat him in 1993, and finished second to the winner in the general election, Jean Schmidt. McEwen's 2005 platform was familiar from his past campaigns, advocating a pro-life stance, defending Second Amendment rights, and promising to limit taxes and government spending. In 2006, he unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination in the Second District.|$|E
5|$|After his defeat, McEwen {{remained}} {{active in}} politics, but press accounts said {{he spent most}} of his time in the Washington, D.C., area residing in northern Virginia.

Hockey Canada's chief negotiator for international events, Alan Eagleson, accused the CAHA of attempting to sabotage the Canada Cup and threatened to cancel the tournament if the CAHA refused to compromise with his body.|$|E
5|$|By early 1896, {{many in the}} Democratic Party were bitterly {{opposed to}} President Cleveland and his policies. The United States was by then {{in the third year}} of a deep recession, the Panic of 1893. Cleveland was a firm {{supporter}} of the gold standard, and soon after the recession began forced through repeal of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act, which he believed had helped cause it. Sherman's act, although not restoring bimetallism, had required the government to purchase and coin large quantities of silver bullion, and its repeal outraged supporters of free silver. Other Cleveland policies, such as his forcible suppression of the Pullman strike, led to the Democrats losing control of both houses of <b>Congress</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1894 midterm elections, and to a revolt against him by silver supporters within his party.|$|E

5|$|Frank E. Holman, {{president}} of the American Bar Association (ABA), called attention to Federal court decisions, notably Missouri v.

Senator Bricker was influenced by the ABA's work and first introduced a constitutional amendment in 1951. With substantial popular support and the election of a Republican president and <b>Congress</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> elections of 1952, together with support from many Southern Democrats, Bricker's plan seemed destined to be sent to the individual states for ratification.|$|E

It was later used as a supply road for Fort Gratiot in Port Huron under authorization from the US <b>Congress</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1820s. The roadway was included in the State Trunkline Highway System in 1913 and signposted with a number in 1919. Later, it was used as a segment of US Highway25 (US25) before that highway was functionally replaced by Interstate94 (I-94) in the 1960s. The M-3 designation was applied to the current highway in 1973, and a southern section was reassigned to M-85 in 2001.|$|E

5|$|Long {{was elected}} to the United States <b>Congress</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1882 election, and served until 1889, declining to run for reelection in the 1888 election. In 1886, he was {{encouraged}} to stand for the Senate by Henry Cabot Lodge, although Lodge's support was apparently part of a ruse to test the strength of the state party leadership. Lodge withdrew his support at the last minute, throwing it instead to the incumbent Henry L. Dawes, and the legislature reelected Dawes to the seat. The incident cooled relations between Lodge and Long. In the wheeling and dealing that preceded the Senate election, Long was offered Democratic support by Butler, but refused, believing that such votes would be seen as tainted by an unsavory political deal.|$|E

Pratap left India for Geneva {{at the beginning of the}} war, where he was met by Virendranath Chattopadhyaya of the Berlin Committee. Chattopadhyaya's efforts—along with a letter from the Kaiser—convinced Pratap to lend his support to the Indian nationalist cause, on the condition that the arrangements were made with the Kaiser himself. A private audience with the Kaiser was arranged, at which Pratap agreed to nominally head the expedition.|$|E
