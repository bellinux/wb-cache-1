5|$|Many {{vegetarian}} {{restaurants and}} producers of vegetarian foods acquire a hechsher, certifying that a Rabbinical organization has approved their products as being kosher. The hechsher usually certifies that certain vegetables have been <b>checked</b> <b>for</b> insect infestation and steps {{have been taken}} to ensure that cooked food meets the requirements of bishul Yisrael. Vegetables such as spinach and cauliflower must be <b>checked</b> <b>for</b> insect infestation. The proper procedure for inspecting and cleaning varies by species, growing conditions, and views of individual rabbis.|$|E
5|$|During the trial, {{evidence}} was presented that Wang often had trouble staying awake during AWACS missions.

5|$|On 10 March 2000, a {{passenger}} train collided {{with an empty}} stock train in platform 5 due to driver error. Thirty-five people were injured. On 15 August 2017, a Class 456 electric multiple unit collided with an engineers' train at the station. The passenger train was derailed, causing disruption {{for the remainder of}} the day. Three people were <b>checked</b> <b>for</b> injuries, but nobody was hospitalised.|$|E
5|$|A {{wide variety}} of small vessels {{from all over the}} south of England were pressed into service to aid in the Dunkirk evacuation. They {{included}} speedboats, Thames vessels, car ferries, pleasure craft, and many other types of small craft. The most useful proved to be the motor lifeboats, which had a reasonably good capacity and speed. Some boats were requisitioned without the owner's knowledge or consent. Agents of the Ministry of Shipping, accompanied by a naval officer, scoured the Thames for likely looking vessels, had them <b>checked</b> <b>for</b> seaworthiness, and took them downriver to Sheerness, where naval crews were to be placed aboard. Due to shortages of personnel, many small craft crossed the Channel with civilian crews.|$|E

5|$|In Wilmington, Delaware, blocks fell to {{the street}} from the steeple of St. Thomas the Apostle Church, and the New Castle County Courthouse was evacuated, as was the air traffic control tower of the New Castle County Airport in nearby Wilmington Manor. Fire marshals and {{building}} inspectors were called to assess structures throughout Dover, the capital city, where the city hall was evacuated. Numerous buildings in Georgetown, the Sussex County seat, were evacuated while crews <b>checked</b> <b>for</b> damage; the Emergency Operations Center there reported 200 calls to 9-1-1. Delaware Department of Transportation crews were dispatched statewide to inspect interstate highways, the under-construction replacement Indian River Inlet Bridge, the Delaware Memorial Bridge on I-295, and other bridges and roads.|$|E
5|$|The {{borders in}} the region had been disputed since the American {{purchase}} of Alaska from Russia in 1867, {{and most of the}} influx of prospectors were American. Amid fresh concerns that the United States might annex the gold fields, the mounted police were tasked to assert Canadian control along the border line. The force set up control posts at the borders of the Yukon and at easily controlled mountain passes, equipping the posts with Maxim guns. The police <b>checked</b> <b>for</b> illegal weapons and prevented the entry of criminals and collected customs duties, while helping protect and guide the flow of migrants, mediating in their disputes and providing practical advice.|$|E
5|$|Western Australia's Deputy Mineralogist gave {{evidence}} that he had identified magnesium hydroxide, a corrosion product, in fuel passages in one of Amana's engines. Counsel for the Department of Civil Aviation explained that evidence gathered during investigation of the crash indicated water {{in some of the}} fuel on board Amana was responsible for the corrosion products found in engines numbers 1 and 4; for the rough running of an engine heard by a number of witnesses; and for the intermittent failure of all engines, leading to the aircraft descending to ground level. The Inquiry heard evidence from the Department of Civil Aviation's Acting Chief Inspector of Air Accidents, C.A.J. Lum, a former RAAF Douglas Dakota pilot, who described his personal experience of a flight in 1946 in which all fuel tanks were <b>checked</b> <b>for</b> the presence of water prior to take-off and the flight proceeded normally for 20 minutes until both engines began running roughly. Lum returned to the aerodrome and checked again for water in the tanks, this time finding a significant amount of water. Counsel for the Vacuum Oil Co. explained that it was almost impossible for water to be introduced to an aircraft during refuelling, and vigorously rejected the theory that water in the fuel contributed to the crash.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} the model <b>checking</b> problem <b>for</b> probabilistic pushdown automata (pPDA) and properties expressible in various probabilistic logics. We start with properties {{that can be}} formulated as instances of a generalized random walk problem. We prove that both qualitative and quantitative model <b>checking</b> <b>for</b> this class of properties and pPDA is decidable. Then we show that model <b>checking</b> <b>for</b> the qualitative fragment of the logic PCTL and pPDA is also decidable. Moreover, we develop an error-tolerant model <b>checking</b> algorithm <b>for</b> PCTL and the subclass of stateless pPDA. Finally, we {{consider the}} class of ω-regular properties and show that both qualitative and quantitative model <b>checking</b> <b>for</b> pPDA is decidable. 1...|$|R
