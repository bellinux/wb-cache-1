40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that {{education}} systems have been heavily investing in technology since the early eighties, international indicators on technology uptake and use in education are missing. This book aims to {{provide a basis for}} the design of frameworks, the identification of indicators and existing data sources as well as gaps in areas where further research is to be initiated. The contributions included stem from an international expert meeting which took place in April 2009 when CRELL, in <b>cooperation</b> <b>with</b> <b>OECD</b> (CERI), organised and hosted an international expert meeting on the issue of benchmarking technology use and effects in education. The contributions clearly demonstrate {{that there is a need}} for the development of consensus around widely accepted approaches, indicators and methodologies. The book is organised around four different blocks: contexts of ICT impact assessment in education, state-of-the-art of ICT impact assessment, conceptual frameworks and case studies. JRC. DG.

40|$|This Chapter aims at {{analyzing}} {{the state of}} the art in industrial robotics, in terms of successful industrial applications, from the perspective of robotic manufacturers and system integrators. It is worth to note that some of the solutions presented hereafter as innovative may be well known among the scientific community. However, due to many reasons, they only recently reached the market. The idea is to highlight the gap between recent research results and industrial applications to stimulate the technology transfer from academia to common practice. Firstly, the current market of industrial robotics will be analyzed and future trends discussed, in term of number and type of installed robots as well as in term of available technology. At the beginning the paper presents official statistics updated to 2010. These statistics are derived from those collected by IFR (International Federation of Robotics) in <b>cooperation</b> <b>with</b> <b>OECD</b> and UNECE. The selected data describe the size of the market, the more consolidated applications and the new trends. The second part of the chapter describes the robotic technology available on the market, in term of kinematical structure of the manipulators, programmability of robotized cells, and sensors to improve flexibility. The different robot typologies are reviewed with respect to the robot applications and commercially available models. The topics are discussed with several references to standard and innovative applications highlighting where technology transfer and/or some degree of innovation is still necessary...|$|E
40|$|Context: The {{physiological}} {{changes in}} the humoral immune system of patients with orofacial epithelial cancers (OECs) are considered key factors in the pathogenesis, prognosis, and management of these individuals. Aim: This study assessed the serum and salivary immunoglobulin M (IgM) levels in patients <b>with</b> <b>OECs.</b> Settings and Designs: This is a cross-sectional study of the serum and salivary IgM profile among patients <b>with</b> <b>OEC</b> and healthy controls. Materials and Methods: There were 78 subjects comprising 30 patients <b>with</b> untreated <b>OEC,</b> 18 patients <b>with</b> <b>OEC</b> receiving treatment and 30 healthy, age and gender matched individuals. The serum and salivary samples from the participants were analyzed for IgM using the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay technique. Results: The mean value of serum IgM in OEC patients receiving treatment was significantly lower compared to untreated OEC patients and healthy controls (P = 0. 01). However, the mean serum IgM among untreated OEC patients was not significantly different compared with healthy controls. In contrast, the salivary IgM level did not show any significant difference among the three groups (P = 0. 06). Furthermore, there was no correlation between the serum and salivary levels of IgM among the subjects. Conclusion: The {{findings from this study}} suggest that serum IgM levels in OEC patients receiving treatment might be good biomarker while salivary IgM may not be reliable as a marker in these individuals...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} {{behind the}} repairing {{effects of the}} cotransplantation of olfactory ensheathing cells (<b>OECs)</b> <b>with</b> bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs) have not been fully understood. Therefore, we investigated {{the effects of the}} cotransplantation of <b>OECs</b> <b>with</b> BMSCs on antiapoptotic effects in adult rats for which the models of SCI are induced. We examined the changes in body weight, histopathological changes, apoptosis, and the expressions of apoptosis-related proteins after 14 days and 28 days after transplantation. We also assessed animal locomotion using BBB test. We found that treatment <b>with</b> <b>OECs</b> and BMSCs had a remissive effect on behavioral outcome and histopathological changes induced SCI. Furthermore, we observed the significant antiapoptotic effect on cotransplant treated group. In addition, cotransplantation of <b>OECs</b> <b>with</b> BMSCs was found to have more significant repairing effect than that of OECs or BMSCs alone. Furthermore, the recovery of hind limb could be related to antiapoptotic effect of OECs and BMSCs through downregulating the apoptotic pathways. Finally, our data suggested the cotransplantation of <b>OECs</b> <b>with</b> BMSCs holds promise for a potential cure after SCI through the ability to incorporate into the spinal cord...|$|R
40|$|Background and Aim: Synthetic nerve {{conduits}} {{have been}} sought for repair of nerve defects as the autologous nerve grafts causes donor site morbidity and possess other drawbacks. Many strategies {{have been investigated}} to improve nerve regeneration through synthetic nerve guided conduits. Olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) that share both Schwann cell and astrocytic characteristics {{have been shown to}} promote axonal regeneration after transplantation. The present study was driven by the hypothesis that tissue-engineered poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) seeded <b>with</b> <b>OECs</b> would improve peripheral nerve regeneration in a long sciatic nerve defect. Materials and Methods: Sciatic nerve gap of 15 mm was created in six adult female Sprague-Dawley rats and implanted with PLGA seeded <b>with</b> <b>OECs.</b> The nerve regeneration was assessed electrophysiologically at 2, 4 and 6 weeks following implantation. Histopathological examination, scanning electron microscopic (SEM) examination and immunohistochemical analysis were performed {{at the end of the}} study. Results: Nerve conduction studies revealed a significant improvement of nerve conduction velocities whereby the mean nerve conduction velocity increases from 4. 2 ΁ 0. 4 m/s at week 2 to 27. 3 ΁ 5. 7 m/s at week 6 post-implantation (P < 0. 0001). Histological analysis revealed presence of spindle-shaped cells. Immunohistochemical analysis further demonstrated the expression of S 100 protein in both cell nucleus and the cytoplasm in these cells, hence confirming their Schwann-cell-like property. Under SEM, these cells were found to be actively secreting extracellular matrix. Conclusion: Tissue-engineered PLGA conduit seeded <b>with</b> <b>OECs</b> provided a permissive environment to facilitate nerve regeneration in a small animal model...|$|R

40|$|Effective transplant-mediated {{repair of}} ischemic brain lesions entails {{extensive}} tissue remodeling, {{especially in the}} ischemic core. Neural stem cells (NSCs) are promising reparative candidates for stroke induced lesions, however, their survival and integration with the host-tissue post-transplantation is poor. In this study, we address this challenge by testing whether co-grafting of NSCs with olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs), a special type of glia with proven neuroprotective, immunomodulatory, and angiogenic effects, can promote graft survival and host tissue remodelling. Transient focal cerebral ischemia was induced in adult rats by a 60 -min middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) followed by reperfusion. Ischemic lesions were verified by neurological testing and magnetic resonance imaging. Transplantation into the globus pallidus of NSCs alone or in combination <b>with</b> <b>OECs</b> was performed at two weeks post-MCAo, followed by histological analyses at three weeks post-transplantation. We found evidence of extensive vascular remodelling in the ischemic core as well as evidence of NSC motility away from the graft and into the infarct border in severely lesioned animals co-grafted <b>with</b> <b>OECs.</b> These findings support a possible role of OECs {{as part of an}} in situ tissue engineering paradigm for transplant mediated repair of ischemic brain lesions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Toll-like receptors (TLR) are {{a family}} of pattern {{recognition}} receptors that constitutes {{a major part of}} the innate immune system. The TLR 4 /(Myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD 88) signaling pathway has been shown to have oncogenic effects. Methods To demonstrate the role of TLR 4 /MyD 88 signaling in ovarian epithelial cancers (OECs), we examined the expression of TLR 4, MyD 88 and nuclear factor- κB (NF-κB) in OECs. The expression of TLR 4, MyD 88, and NF-κB was detected by immunohistochemistry, and the relationships between these and clinicopathologic features in 123 cases of OECs were also analyzed. Results The expression of TLR 4, MyD 88, and NF-κB in OECs was observed in 46. 3 % (57 / 123), 36. 6 % (45 / 123) and 65 % (80 / 123) of OEC cases, respectively. The TLR 4, MyD 88, and NF-κB expressions were associated with the histologic type of <b>OECs,</b> particularly <b>with</b> the clear cell type of OEC. There was no significant correlation between TLR 4 or NF-κB expression and histologic grade, tumor size, mitotic count, FIGO (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) stage, disease recurrence. However, there was a significant correlation between MyD 88 expression and FIGO stage, disease recurrence as well as histologic type. In univariate analysis, the expression of TLR 4 and MyD 88, and the coexpression of TLR 4 /MyD 88 and TLR 4 /MyD 88 /NF-κB had a significant impact on the survival of patients <b>with</b> <b>OECs.</b> Only MyD 88 expression had an independent prognostic significance in multivariate analysis. Conclusions Our findings suggest that the TLR 4 /MyD 88 signaling pathway is associated with the survival of patients <b>with</b> <b>OECs,</b> and that MyD 88 is an independent prognostic predictor in patients <b>with</b> <b>OECs.</b> The TLR 4 /MyD 88 signaling pathway may be a mechanism responsible for poor prognosis in patients with clear cell type of OEC. </p...|$|R

40|$|After mating, inseminated {{spermatozoa}} are {{transported to}} the oviduct. They attach to and interact with oviductal epithelial cells (OEC). To investigate sperm-OEC interactions, we used chlortetracycline to study the capacitation status of boar sper-matozoa in coculture <b>with</b> homologous <b>OEC</b> and cells of non-reproductive origin (LLC-PK 1, porcine kidney epithelial cell line). Boar spermatozoa were cocultured <b>with</b> <b>OEC</b> and LLC-PK 1 cells for 15, 60, 120, or 240 min. The proportion of capac-itated spermatozoa in coculture with the isthmic and ampullar cells increased significantly (p, 0. 05) during incubation. How-ever, most spermatozoa in coculture with LLC-PK 1 cells or blank (medium only) remained uncapacitated. In addition, preferential binding of uncapacitated, capacitated, or acrosome-reacted boar spermatozoa to OEC and the other cell type was investi-gated. Our approach was to vary the proportions of uncapaci-tated, capacitated, or acrosome-reacted boar spermatozoa in suspension using long preincubation and lysophosphatidylcho-line treatment of semen prior to a very short incubation <b>with</b> <b>OEC</b> or LLC-PK 1 cells. The {{results showed that the}} majority of spermatozoa that were bound to OEC or LLC-PK 1 cells were uncapacitated and that a significant relationship existed be-tween the relative proportion of uncapacitated spermatozoa in the control samples and those bound to LLC-PK 1 cells (r 2 5 0. 43, p, 0. 005). However, there was no correlation between the proportion of uncapacitated spermatozoa in the control samples and the proportion of those bound to isthmic or am-pullar cells. In conclusion, the results clearly demonstrated the specific nature of the sperm-OEC interaction in the porcine species. This interaction is initiated by uncapacitated spermatozoa binding to OEC and is continued by the induction of capacitation in co-cultured spermatozoa...|$|R
