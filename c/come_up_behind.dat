25|$|According to {{the book}} Who Killed Karen Silkwood, the {{assassination}} scene in the movie The China Syndrome, in which the character Hector's car is run off the road, {{is based on a}} theorized version of Silkwood's death. In the film, the power plant's agents <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>behind</b> Hector's vehicle and ram him, repeatedly, from behind until a device on their front bumper engages his rear bumper and lets them lift the rear end of his vehicle off the road, thereby pushing his car over a cliff. Subsequently, police officers remove the evidence from his vehicle and hand it to the villains because their company's name is on the documents. This could be construed as an attempt by the film's producers to influence the jury in the Silkwood case. According {{to the book}}, it was for this reason that the jury was forbidden from seeing that then-new movie while they were hearing the case and deliberating.|$|E
500|$|The boats, however, {{had drifted}} {{slightly}} off course: instead of landing {{at the base}} of the road, many soldiers found themselves {{at the base of}} a slope. A group of 24 volunteers led by Colonel William Howe with fixed bayonets were sent to clear the picket along the road, and climbed the slope, a manoeuvre that allowed them to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>behind</b> Vergor's camp and capture it quickly. [...] Wolfe followed an hour later when he could use an easy access road to climb to the plain. Thus, by the time the sun rose over the Plains of Abraham, Wolfe's army had a solid foothold at the top of the cliffs.|$|E
500|$|Production of Crash Bandicoot: Warped {{began on}} January 1998, with Naughty Dog given only ten {{and a half}} months and a budget of 2.2 million to {{complete}} the game. Crash Bandicoot - Time Line ] |publisher=Naughty Dog |accessdate=April 4, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }} Programmers Andy Gavin, Stephen White and Greg Omi created three new gameplay engines for the game. Two of the three new engines were three-dimensional in nature and were created for the airplane and jet-ski levels; the third new engine was created for the motorcycle levels in the style of a driving simulator. The new engines combined make up a third of the game, while the other two-thirds of the game consist of the same engine used in the previous games. Jason Rubin explained that the [...] "classic" [...] engine and game style was preserved due {{to the success of the}} previous two games and went on to say that [...] "were we to abandon that style of gameplay, that would mean that we would be abandoning a significant proportion of gamers out there." [...] An arbitrary plane z-buffer was created for the jet-ski and flooded Egyptian hallway levels of the game. To create a completely fluid feel for the water on these levels, an environment map that reflects the sky was fitted onto the surface of the water. A real shadow was given to the Crash character at the request of the Sony Computer Entertainment America producers, who were [...] "sick of that little discus that's following him around." [...] To create an [...] "arcade" [...] experience in the airplane levels and to differentiate them from flight simulators, the enemy planes were programmed to come out in front of the player and give the player ample time to shoot them before they turn around and shoot the player rather than <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>behind</b> the player and hit them from behind. The Relic system was introduced to give players a reason to return to the game after it has been completed.|$|E

2500|$|At this point, the Confederate hold on Fort Fisher was untenable. The seaward {{batteries}} {{had been}} silenced, {{almost all of}} the north wall had been captured, and Ames had fortified a bastion within the interior. Terry, however, had concluded to finish the battle that night. Ames, ordered to maintain the offensive, organized a flanking maneuver, sending some of his men to advance outside the land wall, and <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>behind</b> the Confederate defenders of the last traverse. Within a few minutes the Confederate defeat was unmistakable. Colquitt and his staff rushed back to their rowboats just moments before Abbott's men seized the wharf. Major Reilly held up a white flag and walked into the Union lines to announce the fort would surrender. Just before 10:00 p.m. [...] Terry rode to Battery Buchanan to receive the official surrender of the fort from Whiting.|$|E

60|$|In a {{few moments}} the captain <b>came</b> walking rapidly <b>up</b> to us. He was a tall man, dressed in blue, with side-whiskers, and an oil-cloth cap. The purser <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>behind</b> him.|$|R
60|$|On this {{occasion}} he <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>behind</b> Nancy {{as she was}} leaving Sophy's gate and immediately sounded the alarm. She leaped in the air, dropped her school-books and whirled on him.|$|R
60|$|STEAM TACTICS I {{caught sight}} of their faces as we <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>behind</b> the cart in the narrow Sussex lane; but {{though it was not}} eleven o'clock, they were both asleep.|$|R

60|$|The Irishwoman had <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>behind</b> Hal so softly--she wore rubbers--that {{the youth}} {{did not hear}} her, and he was, therefore, {{thoroughly}} startled when she made the exclamation quoted {{at the end of}} the preceding chapter.|$|E
60|$|In the meantime, Hank Stiger {{was making}} a détour, expecting to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>behind</b> Dan and {{surprise}} him. He had drank just enough to be utterly reckless, and carried his pistol in his hand ready for another shot.|$|E
25|$|A Tusken Raider flees a bar {{when the}} {{bartender}} <b>comes</b> <b>up</b> <b>behind</b> him. Obi-Wan tells the bartender that they startle easily, but will return {{in greater numbers}} (much to the barman's pleasure).|$|R
6000|$|... "They've robbed me!" [...] moaned the old lumberman. [...] "They <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>behind</b> me, and {{somebody}} {{hit me in}} the head with a rock! Then they ran away with my tin box!" ...|$|R
60|$|The tread {{of a horse}} which <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>behind</b> him, {{interrupted}} his reverie, and he soon saw he {{was mounted}} by the same wild rider whom he had left at the tower.|$|R
6000|$|... --In a knockingshop it was {{count of}} a tryon between two smugglers. Fellow hid behind a door, <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>behind</b> him. Like that. Prepare {{to meet your}} God, says he. Chuk! It went into his {{back up to the}} butt.|$|E
60|$|While he was {{speaking}} Buster Beggs had <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>behind</b> Horsehair and placed something attached to a dark string on the box, between the driver's feet. It was an imitation snake, made of rubber and colored up to look very natural.|$|E
60|$|But, here {{a startling}} right hand is laid on Edwin’s shoulder, and Jasper stands between them. For, {{it would seem}} that he, too, has strolled round by the Nuns’ House, and has <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>behind</b> them on the shadowy side of the road.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{know how}} it goes," [...] {{interrupted}} Smarty Mellor, as we called him; [...] "seen it done heaps o' times!

60|$|While he was {{speaking}} Larry Colby had <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>behind</b> him. Ere Baxter could stop the movement, Larry pushed his hand {{into one of the}} bully's pockets and turned it out. A jagged stone as big as a walnut dropped to the ground.|$|E

60|$|Gazing around he {{saw that}} nobody was within sight and then he arose to his feet. With a cat-like tread he <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>behind</b> Tom, who still looked at the waves, totally {{unconscious}} of danger.|$|R
