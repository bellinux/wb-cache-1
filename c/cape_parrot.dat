40|$|Psittacine beak and feather disease (PBFD), {{the most}} {{prevalent}} viral disease affecting psittacines, is caused by beak and feather disease virus (BFDV). An outbreak of the disease {{has been reported in}} wild endangered <b>Cape</b> <b>parrots</b> (Poicephalus robustus), which is endemic to South Africa. No treatment or vaccine is commercially available. In this study, an investigation into the outbreak was undertaken. BFDV diversity was assessed and viral load and clinical signs correlated. A plant-produced BFDV subunit vaccine was produced in parallel with a corresponding challenge model. <b>Cape</b> <b>parrots</b> were assessed and 53 blood samples collected. Viral load was determined using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), and 22 BFDV full-length genome sequences acquired to infer phylogenetic relatedness. The capsid gene (cp) was optimised for transient Agrobacterium-mediated expression in whole-plant Nicotiana benthamiana (N. benthamiana). Virus-like particles (VLPs) were purified and analysed using transmission electron microscopy. Virions from a Palm cockatoo (Probosciger aterrimus) were purified and a BFDV dsDNA molecular clone was synthesised and replication assessed in 293 TT mammalian cells and N. benthamiana using rolling circle replication and qPCR. Two distinct BFDV phylogenetic clusters were reported for <b>Cape</b> <b>parrots,</b> and a direct correlation was seen between viral load in the blood and clinical signs in PBFD-afflicted birds. The CP was successfully expressed in N. benthamiana, and increased through optimisation of Agrobacterium infiltration density and the inclusion of the NSs silencing suppressor. The CP formed VLPs, which were shown to be morphologically similar to infectious virions. The dsDNA molecular clone was shown to replicate autonomously in mammalian 293 TT cells, and in plants {{with the assistance of the}} Bean yellow dwarf virus replication associated protein (Rep). BFDV genetic diversity in <b>Cape</b> <b>parrots</b> highlights the importance of ensuring new strains are not inadvertently introduced into the wild. This is the first systematic investigation of virus diversity in <b>Cape</b> <b>parrots</b> and assessment of BFDV viral load in a wild psittacine population. The CP was successfully produced in planta and presence of VLPs suggests the possibility of developing pseudovirions. This is the first reported replication of BFDV in tissue culture, and will greatly expand the scope of available research...|$|R
50|$|More {{detailed}} {{genetic analysis}} of the three taxa published in 2015 confirmed the distinctness of brown-necked and <b>cape</b> <b>parrots,</b> showing that ancestors of the two had diverged between 2.13 and 2.67 million years ago—in the late Pliocene to early Pleistocene epoch. This period {{was a period of}} changes in climate, where grassland and forest were expanding and contracting, which led to isolation and eventually speciation of separate populations.|$|R
5000|$|The fruit are {{eaten by}} people, vervet monkeys, bushpigs, <b>Cape</b> <b>parrots,</b> black-bellied glossy {{starlings}} and yellow-streaked bulbuls. [...] These trees serve {{to lift the}} vegetative canopy in coastal dune vegetation, thereby allowing space and protection for more delicate plant species such as Isoglossa woodii (which is fed on by blue duiker) and the large-leaved dragon tree (Dracaena aletriformis). The robust structure of these trees also allows support for climbing plants such as Rhoicissus rhomboidea. Monkeys and birds spread the seeds of Mimusops caffra, which are also buoyant and often wash up along the shore.|$|R

50|$|The old {{name for}} the three taxa was <b>Cape</b> <b>parrot,</b> with {{virtually}} all the individuals in captivity belonging to what became P. fuscicollis. Jean Pattison called them Uncape parrots because of this.|$|E
50|$|Over {{one hundred}} P. robustus parrots are kept as cage birds, {{most of which}} are wild-caught birds {{although}} they do breed reasonably well in captivity. To date there have not been any successful releases of captive birds and the survival of this species is dependent on habitat conservation to maintain wild populations. Trade and export of wild-caught <b>Cape</b> <b>parrots</b> from South Africa has been made illegal by the international CITES agreement (appendix list II) and by South African law. They are rare as pets, despite low-levels of ongoing illegal collection and trade. Those that are kept have demonstrated wonderful personalities, and a talking ability that rivals their larger cousin the African grey parrot. A small trade still persists in the related Grey-headed and brown-necked parrots.|$|R
40|$|Monthly fruiting data {{including}} general fruit-fall {{of species}} fruiting, and stage of fruit development {{and quantity of}} Podocarpus spp. were collected for two southern African afromontane forests, Hlabeni and Ingeli, {{over a period of}} three years. Fruits of the dominant Podocarpus species were the most abundant fruit resource at Hlabeni. The percentage of species fruiting (fruit-fall) differed significantly between months for each study site. Peak fruiting period, expressed as a percentage of species in fruit, occurred during winter months (June – August) and was lowest during spring (September – November). Peak fruiting production occurred during winter at Ingeli, but was not significantly different between months at Hlabeni. Most of the dominant canopy fruiting species, particularly the Podocarpus spp., showed unpredictable fruiting patterns. Fruiting periods were extended (greater than 2 months) in some species including the Podocarpus spp. However, total fruit production of some canopy fruiting species differed monthly rather than seasonally. During periods of low fruit production, spring, Kiggelaria africana and Ptaeroxylon obliquum were available. However, these are not keystone species as they are not a food source for avian frugivores, including <b>Cape</b> <b>Parrots</b> Poicephalus robustus...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFragmented {{forests are}} under threat worldwide. Understanding fruiting {{phenology}} {{of these is}} {{important in terms of}} food supply to frugivores, particularly avifauna, which can move varying distances between forest fragments. Fragmentation can affect tree species' diversity, which in turn determines fruit availability and quality. Many forest types have predictable, synchronous fruiting which is often linked to climatic cues. However, some forest types show no seasonality in fruiting and have varying fruit outputs between years. We investigated the fruiting phenology of four forest fragments in the Ngele Mistbelt Forest complex, which forms part of the Eastern Mistbelt Forests in KwaZulu-Natal, using fruit-fall traps. We hypothesized that fruit availability would vary with forest fragment size and with season. Fruiting in three of the forest fragments did not show seasonal fruiting trends and had increased fruiting in late summer and autumn months. Middlebrook showed trends. Fruiting varied significantly between months for all fragments, and where annual variation was observed trends were insignificant. The number of fruiting species per fragment varied significantly and numbers of fruiting species per fragment per month were generally low. Tree species varied in their fruiting patterns between fragments and fruiting of Afrocarpus/Podocarpus trees and the implications for endemic, endangered <b>Cape</b> <b>Parrots</b> are discussed as an example. In summary, these forests have variable and unpredictable fruiting between fragments. These results highlight the need to conserve forest fragments of varying sizes as a network to provide a year round supply of fruits to frugivores...|$|R

5000|$|German naturalist Heinrich Kuhl {{described}} the brown-necked parrot in his 1819 work Conspectus Psittacorum.

50|$|The <b>Cape</b> <b>parrot</b> (Poicephalus robustus) or Levaillant's parrot is a large, {{temperate}} forest dwelling parrot {{of the genus}} Poicephalus endemic to South Africa. It was formerly grouped as a subspecies along with the savanna-dwelling brown-necked parrot (P. fuscicollis fuscicollis) and grey-headed parrot (P. f. suahelicus), but is now considered a distinct species.|$|E
5000|$|The name <b>Cape</b> <b>parrot</b> only applies {{strictly}} {{to the form}} in South Africa. The name un-cape parrot has gained limited popularity as a general name for the two savanna forms (as [...] "brown-necked", used by most sources, is an inaccurate description of the [...] "grey-headed" [...] form in the east African savanna).|$|E
50|$|The IUCN Redlist 3.1, {{which uses}} the Birdlife International checklist, lumps the common and {{widespread}} grey-headed parrot with Cape parrots and brown-necked parrots, {{each of which}} are more narrowly distributed and more threatened, leading to an assessment of least concern. This contrasts with alternative assessments of the South African endemic P. robustus, as endangered and possible threatened status of the brown-headed parrot of West Africa. There are only about 400 in the wild, and the <b>Cape</b> <b>Parrot</b> Project is trying to save them.|$|E
50|$|There are {{conflicting}} classifications of {{this population}} due {{to the existence of}} three geographically separated but closely related forms that differ in habitat, size and plumage. The dominant view of the ornithological community, especially in Africa, considers these as two species, with the temperate, montane forest dwelling <b>Cape</b> <b>parrot,</b> P. robustus distinct from the savanna species, P. fuscicollis, including the brown-necked parrot, P. f. fuscicollis of West Africa and the grey-headed parrot, P. f. suahelicus of eastern and southern Africa. This view is reflected in the 2011 IOC World List (adopted by many, including Wikispecies, as the global standard) along with recent reviews and field guides from Southern Africa. These may in fact be three separate species but this view needs substantiation through studies of plumage, ecology and genetic variation within and among the two forms of P. fuscicollis. The multiple species interpretations are supported by the lack of overlap in distribution between the three forms, by the distinct biomes and dietary preferences of the <b>Cape</b> <b>parrot</b> (P. robustus) and the other two forms (which occur in different types of tropical savanna) and by limited data on mitochondrial DNA differences among forms. The Birdlife International taxonomic checklist of the world's birds conflicts with these sources by considering all three forms as subspecies of a single species Poicephalus robustus. This disagreement impacts on the perceived global conservation status of these parrots.|$|E

50|$|South Africa-based ornithologist Phillip Clancey {{proposed}} the Cape and brown-necked parrots were separate species in 1997 {{based on the}} shape {{and size of the}} bill, head coloration and preferred habitat. Mike Perrin observed that species status would facilitate protection of the endangered <b>Cape</b> <b>parrot.</b> Genetic analysis of the three taxa published in 2015 supported the distinctness of brown-necked and cape parrots, showing that ancestors of the two had diverged between 2.13 and 2.67 million years ago—in the late Pliocene to early Pleistocene epoch.

50|$|The <b>Cape</b> <b>parrot</b> is a short-tailed {{moderately}} large {{bird with}} a very large beak used to crack all sorts of hard nuts and fruit kernels, especially those of African yellowwood trees (Podocarpus spp.). This contrasts with the closely related savanna species (Poicephalus fuscicollis) which feeds on and {{a wide variety of}} tropical woodland trees such as marula, Commiphora spp. and Terminalia spp. These species are sexually dimorphic, with females typically sporting an orange frontal patch on the forehead. Juveniles also show a larger orange - pink patch on the forehead but lack the red on shoulders and legs of adults. These plumage characteristics vary among individuals and among the three recognized forms.|$|E
5000|$|Female trees bear their fruit irregularly, {{only every}} few years. The fleshy epimatium of the strobilus (or [...] "cone") covers {{all of the}} seed, and ripens to a yellow colour, when it acquires a soft, jelly-like consistency. The main agents of seed {{dispersal}} are fruit bats, which eat the fleshy covering but discard the hard, woody seed. Many birds feed on the fruits, such as <b>Cape</b> <b>parrot,</b> purple-crested turaco, Knysna turaco, Ross's turaco, African olive pigeon, African green pigeon, and eastern bronze-naped pigeon. [...] Animals that feed on the seeds include colobus monkeys, bushpigs, hornbills, turacos, and rodents. These may not be effective seed dispersal agents, because it appears that seeds that have gone through animal guts do not germinate well.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Cape</b> <b>parrot</b> is {{endemic to}} South Africa. It occurs in Afromontane forests at {{moderate}} altitudes in eastern South Africa from the coastal escarpment near sea-level to the midlands at around 1000m. These forests {{occur as a}} series of small patches around the south and east of South Africa and are dominated by yellowwood trees (Podocarpus latifolius, P. falcatus and P. henkelii). Cape parrots have a disjunct distribution with the largest population around in the Amathole mountains of the Eastern Cape Province and extending east, with several large gaps, through the Mthatha escarpment and Pondoland in the Eastern Cape and the southern midlands of KwaZulu-Natal Province to Karkloof, near Pietermaritzburg. A very small population, of around 30 individuals occurs over 600 km to the north in the Magoebaskloof area of Limpopo Province. Cape parrots are absent from large areas of afromontane forests such as those along the southern coast of South Africa, near Knysna, the higher altitude Afromontane forests in the Drakensberg mountains of KwaZulu-Natal, or the moderate-altitude forests of northern KwaZulu-Natal province and Swaziland, which separate the KwaZulu-Natal midlands and Limpopo escarpment populations. All of these areas are within the dispersal range of the parrots and there are old records of Cape parrots from northern KwaZulu-Natal.|$|E
40|$|Most <b>Cape</b> <b>Parrot,</b> Poicephalus robustus, nests {{have been}} {{recorded}} in snags (standing dead trees) making monitoring of nest contents and nest activities difficult and dangerous.

40|$|The taxonomic {{position}} of the <b>Cape</b> <b>Parrot</b> (Poicephalus robustus robustus) {{has been the focus}} of much debate. A number of authors suggest that the <b>Cape</b> <b>Parrot</b> should be viewed as a distinct species separate from the other two P. robustus subspecies (P. r. fuscicollis and P. r. suahelicus). These recommendations were based on morphological, ecological, and behavioural assessments. In this study we investigated the validity of these recommendations using multilocus DNA analyses. We genotyped 138 specimens from five Poicephalus species (P. cryptoxanthus, P. gulielmi, P. meyeri, P. robustus, and P. rueppellii) using 11 microsatellite loci. Additionally, two mitochondrial (cytochrome oxidase I gene and 16 S ribosomal RNA) and one nuclear intron (intron 7 of the β-fibrinogen gene) markers were amplified and sequenced. Bayesian clustering analysis and pairwise FST analysis of microsatellite data identified P. r. robustus as genetically distinct from the other P. robustus subspecies. Phylogenetic and molecular clock analyses on sequence data also supported the microsatellite analyses, placing P. r. robustus in a distinct clade separate from the other P. robustus subspecies. Molecular clock analysis places the most recent common ancestor between P. r. robustus and P. r. fuscicollis / P. r. suahelicus at 2. 13 to 2. 67 million years ago. Our results all support previous recommendations to elevate the <b>Cape</b> <b>Parrot</b> to species level.

40|$|Background Illegal {{trade in}} rare {{wildlife}} species {{is a major}} threat to many parrot species around the world. Wildlife forensics {{plays an important role in}} the preservation of endangered or threatened wildlife species. Identification of illegally harvested or traded animals through DNA techniques is one of the many methods used during forensic investigations. Natural populations of the South African endemic <b>Cape</b> <b>Parrot</b> (Poicephalus robustus) are negatively affected by the removal of eggs and chicks for the pet trade. Methods In this study, 16 microsatellite markers specifically designed for the South African endemic <b>Cape</b> <b>Parrot</b> (P. robustus) are assessed for their utility in forensic casework. Using these 16 loci, the genetic diversity of a subset of the captive <b>Cape</b> <b>Parrot</b> population was also assessed and compared to three wild <b>Cape</b> <b>Parrot</b> populations. Results It was determined that the full 16 locus panel has sufficient discriminatory power to be used in parentage analyses and can be used to determine if a bird has been bred in captivity and so can be legally traded or if it has been illegally removed from the wild. In cases where birds have been removed from the wild, this study suggests that a reduced 12 locus microsatellite panel has sufficient power to assign confiscated birds to geographic population of origin. Discussion The level of genetic diversity observed within the captive <b>Cape</b> <b>Parrot</b> population was similar to that observed in the wild populations, which suggests that the captive population is not suffering from decreased levels of genetic diversity. The captive Cape Parrots did however have double the number of private alleles compared to that observed in the most genetically diverse wild population. This is probably due to the presence of rare alleles present in the founder population, which has not been lost due to genetic drift, as many of the individuals tested in this study are F 1 –F 3 wild descendants. The results from this study provide a suit of markers that can be used to aid conservation and law enforcement authorities to better control legal and illegal trade of this South African endemic...|$|E
40|$|Factors {{affecting}} {{the decline of}} the endangered <b>Cape</b> <b>parrot,</b> which is endemic to South Africa, are presented. Its abundance and status were investigated during annual intensive national surveys. The merits of such a census are reported. Presence of birds was unpredictable at forest patches throughout its range. Present distributions in forest fragments reflect past distribution in a larger mosaic of forest patches. Numbers are low and the best estimate of numbers is 300 – 350 birds in the Eastern Cape, 170 – 220 in KwaZulu-Natal, and 50 – 60 in Limpopo Province. This suggests less than 1000 Cape parrots remain in the wild.

40|$|Behaviour, {{movements}} {{and numbers of}} the rare <b>Cape</b> <b>parrot</b> (Poicephalus robustus) were investigated at two study sites to assess its conservation status and {{as the basis for}} an action plan for their conservation.

Mean monthly (±SE) number of birds observed daily was 21. 8 ± 2. 5 (n = 45) but ranged from 0 – 80. Activity was bimodal: it commenced at sunrise, lasted  several hours, and was followed by inactivity through mid-day; activity recommenced a few hours before sunset and continued until sunset. Activity reflected changing day length. Causes of localized movements included food and water availability, and in summer some birds fed in fruit orchards.

40|$|Little {{is known}} about snags in South African {{indigenous}} forests. Because of their value to wildlife, we initiated this study to quantify snag characteristics and dynamics. We also investigated forest structure (woody component and snags) and forest use by avian species of conservation concern. We examined tree species composition, abundance and tree size in eight Afromontane mixed Podocarpus forests in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. In addition, we investigated the succession of snags {{at the level of}} individual trees. Large Podocarpus species were less abundant in forests of the Dargle district than forests in the Creighton district. Mean diameter at breast height (dbh) of trees in the forests in these two districts differed significantly. Emergent and upper canopy trees (trees > 50 % of estimated 100 % canopy height) were smaller in the Dargle district than those in the Creighton district. Although frequency of smaller trees (dbh = 10 – 60 cm) compared with larger trees was high in both districts, forests in the Creighton district had more large trees. Snags were rare in all forests, but were larger (dbh) in forests of the Creighton district. The availability of large snags in these forests has implications for the conservation of secondary cavity nesting bird species including the Endangered <b>Cape</b> <b>Parrot,</b> Poicephalus robustus, as they are necessary for reproduction and recruitment of these birds...|$|E
40|$|Psittacine beak and feather disease (PBFD), {{caused by}} Beak and feather disease virus (BFDV), {{is the most}} {{significant}} infectious disease in psittacines. PBFD is thought to have originated in Australia but is now found worldwide; in Africa, it threatens the survival of the indigenous endangered <b>Cape</b> <b>parrot</b> and the vulnerable black-cheeked lovebird. We investigated the genetic diversity of putative BFDVs from southern Africa. Feathers and heparinized blood samples were collected from 27 birds representing 9 psittacine species, all showing clinical signs of PBFD. DNA extracted from these samples was used for PCR amplification of the putative BFDV coat protein (CP) gene. The nucleotide sequences of the CP genes of 19 unique BFDV isolates were determined and compared with the 24 previously described sequences of BFDV isolates from Australasia and America. Phylogenetic analysis revealed eight BFDV lineages, with the southern African isolates representing at least three distinctly unique genotypes; 10 complete genome sequences were determined, representing at least one of every distinct lineage. The nucleotide diversity of the southern African isolates was calculated to be 6. 4 % and is comparable to that found in Australia and New Zealand. BFDVs in southern Africa have, however, diverged substantially from viruses found {{in other parts of the}} world, as the average distance between the southern African isolates and BFDV isolates from Australia ranged from 8. 3 to 10. 8 %.
