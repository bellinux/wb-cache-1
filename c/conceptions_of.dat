40|$|TITLE: Teacher's <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> {{the pupil}} SUMMARY: This diploma thesis {{deals with the}} {{relationship}} between the objectified <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> a pupil and the teacher's subjective <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> a pupil. The first chapter introduces teacher's <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> a successful pupil and especially different success criteria varying on the base of different personality of the teacher. The thesis also describes the aspects of pedagogic interaction affecting school success of pupils. The second chapter describes the basic educative styles reflecting the teacher's <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> a pupil. The intention of the practical part of the thesis is to confirm or disprove the influence <b>of</b> the objectified <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> a pupil. To reveal the relations between phenomena, the qualitative research has been used as well as the case studies from the schools, which are consistent in a pupil <b>conception.</b> The contribution <b>of</b> the work {{can be found in the}} analysis <b>of</b> the teacher's <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> a pupil and in the interpretation of results of the research. These results indicate, that the subjective <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> teachers acting according to the modern pedagogy findings is not being updated by the objectified school conception, because it was in accordance with when the teacher started an employment.

5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1817 Captain George Woodbine, one of Nicolls's former {{subordinate}} officers, was present in Spanish East Florida together with the former British soldier and Scottish mercenary lieutenant of Simon Bolivar, Gregor MacGregor. Woodbine and MacGregor both left Spanish East Florida to rejoin the Latin American revolutionary movement prior to U.S. military intervention in East Florida. The names of Nicolls, Woodbine, and MacGregor had become associated with the arming of blacks as soldiers, militiamen, and even as mercenaries.

5|$|Philosopher G. H. R. Parkinson notes {{a common}} {{objection}} to Kant's argument: that {{what ought to}} be done does not necessarily entail that it is possible. He also argues that alternative <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> morality exist which do not rely on the assumptions that Kant makes – he cites utilitarianism as an example which does not require the summum bonum. Nicholas Everitt argues that much moral guidance is unattainable, such as the Biblical command to be Christ-like. He proposes that Kant's first two premises only entail that we must try to achieve the perfect good, not that it is actually attainable.|$|E

5|$|A salient {{feature of}} Buddhist {{philosophy}} which sets it apart from Indian orthodoxy is {{the centrality of}} the doctrine of not-self (Pāli. anatta, Skt. anātman). The Buddha's not-self doctrine sees humans as an impermanent composite of five psychological and physical aspects instead of a single fixed self. In this sense, what is called ego or the self is merely a convenient fiction, an illusion that does not apply to anything real but to an erroneous {{way of looking at the}} ever changing stream of five interconnected aggregate factors. The relationship between these aggregates is said to be one of dependent-arising (pratītyasamutpāda). This means that all things, including mental events, arise co-dependently from a plurality of other causes and conditions. This seems to reject both causal determinist and epiphenomenalist <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> mind.|$|E

5|$|Beliefs in {{the divine}} and in the afterlife were {{ingrained}} in ancient Egyptian civilization from its inception; pharaonic rule {{was based on the}} divine right of kings. The Egyptian pantheon was populated by gods who had supernatural powers and were called on for help or protection. However, the gods were not always viewed as benevolent, and Egyptians believed they had to be appeased with offerings and prayers. The structure of this pantheon changed continually as new deities were promoted in the hierarchy, but priests made no effort to organize the diverse and sometimes conflicting myths and stories into a coherent system. These various <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> divinity were not considered contradictory but rather layers in the multiple facets of reality.|$|E
5|$|Chapter seven {{deals with}} <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> {{morality}} and ethics, arguing that whereas High Magic typically envisions a dualistic world view of good versus evil, Wicca adheres to a monistic worldview in which malevolence and benevolence {{are seen as}} intrinsic parts of the whole. Disagreeing with Luhrmann's view that morality's place in the occult is to hide the pseudo-scientific nature of magic, Greenwood discusses how magic and witchcraft developed in Europe {{as a part of}} moral discourse. She looks at the internal source of morality in High Magic, explaining concepts such as that of the Qliphoth, before examining the internal source of morality in Wicca and Feminist Witchcraft.|$|E
5|$|The {{gender roles}} {{of men and}} women, as well as societies' <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> the {{associated}} concepts, are frequent themes in Achebe's writing. He has been criticised as a sexist author, in response to what many call the uncritical depiction of traditionally patriarchal Igbo society, where the most masculine men take numerous wives, and women are beaten regularly. Paradoxically, Igbo society immensely values individual achievement but also sees the ownership over or acquisition of women as a signifier of success. As seen in Things Fall Apart, Igbo society condemns violence but Okonkwo's ability to control ‘his’ women is inextricably connected to his dignity. Thus, women are automatically disenfranschised in terms of achieving high status related to personal achievement. Others suggest that Achebe is merely representing the limited gendered vision of the characters, and they note that in his later works, he tries to demonstrate the inherent dangers of excluding women from society. It is also suggested that Achebe purposefully created exaggerated gender binaries in order to render Igbo history recognizable to international readers. Still others suggest that reading Achebe through a womanist lens enables an understanding of Igbo <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> gender complementarity. Womanism is “an afrocentric concept forged out of global feminism to analyze the condition of Black African women” that acknowledges the patriarchal oppression of women, but also highlights the resistance and dignity of African women. As the representation of Igbo society and kinship structures in novels such as Things Fall Apart differs considerably {{from the work of}} African feminist anthropology, the representation should not be taken literally; rather, the reader should consider the roles of both women and men as intentionally stark and in opposition. In any case, a careful reading of Achebe paradoxically recognizes the hyperbolic representation of gender politics in Igbo society, while acknowledging the necessary nuance that gives Achebe’s women some agency and prominence.|$|E

40|$|This paper proposes an {{interpretation}} <b>of</b> the <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> morality that remains relatively vague in John Rawls' political liberalism. It begins with Rawls' remark {{that the political}} <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> justice is also a moral conception, which is puzzling when taking into consideration Rawls' explicit avoidance of comprehensive moral doctrines in constructing the political <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> justice. In response, this paper proposes the public <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> morality that is structurally justificatory rather than substantively foundationalist. This conception is then further developed by addressing two critical questions concerning the necessity of avoiding comprehensive moral foundations {{and the source of}} objective prescriptivity in a justificatory view of morality. The former is situated in an analysis and reinterpretation of Alasdair MacIntyre's reading of Søren Kierkegaard's Either/Or, and the latter is demonstrated through a comparative study of two leading justificatory theories of morality by Rainer Forst and Thomas Scanlon. Finally, the public <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> morality is fully developed to show that it both defines and defends the political <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> justice...|$|R
