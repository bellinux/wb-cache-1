40|$|The {{demand for}} {{automatic}} counting of pedestrians at event sites, buildings, or streets has been increased. Existing systems for counting pedestrians in video sequences {{have a problem}} that <b>counting</b> <b>accuracy</b> degrades when many pedestrians coexist and occlusion occurs frequently. In this paper, we introduce a method of clustering optical flows extracted from pedestrians in video frames to improve the <b>counting</b> <b>accuracy.</b> The proposed method counts the number of pedestrians by using pre-learned statistics, based on the strong correlation {{between the number of}} optical flow clusters and the actual number of pedestrians. We evaluate the accuracy of the proposed method using several video sequences, focusing in particular on the effect of parameters for optical flow clustering. We find that the proposed method improves the <b>counting</b> <b>accuracy</b> by up to 25 % as compared with a non-clustering method. We also report that using a clustering threshold of angles less than 1 degree is effective for enhancing <b>counting</b> <b>accuracy.</b> Furthermore, we compare the performance of two algorithms that use feature points and lattice points when optical flows are detected. We confirm that the <b>counting</b> <b>accuracy</b> using feature points is higher than that using lattice points especially when the number of occluded pedestrians increases...|$|E

40|$|The flow cytometers {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{powerful}} devices used to measure the properties of individual particles passing through a sensing region. In this thesis, a low cost cytometer using a Blu-ray pickup is analysed and further developed. This includes the characterisation of the existing system and its performance as well as the evaluation of count rate for different flow rates and focuses. Based on that, the best parameters for measurement conditions have been determined. The system was set up for forward scatter as well as for fluorescence, both were to be measured at the same time and it was found that both could be recorded and counted. In addition, it was found that fluorescing particles can give a fluorescent count as well as scatter count and it was noticed that different sizes of non-fluorescent particles can produce scatter count. The count rate for a mixture of fluorescent and non-fluorescent particles was measured. This required the installation of two different amplifiers (for fluorescent and non-fluorescent particles) and building a new LabView program containing two channels. In a later part of the thesis, the system was improved to progress towards a setup of avalanche photodiode as detector for forward scattering as well as fluorescence. This gives a very good <b>counting</b> <b>accuracy</b> of 90 % at speed of 10 μl/s. However, this <b>counting</b> <b>accuracy</b> drops to 80 % at speed of 1 μl/s when mixing fluorescent and non-fluorescent particles. The <b>counting</b> <b>accuracy</b> is the ratio (in percent) of the measured count to the actual one. As a new detection approach, a beam stop was installed in front of the photo detector so scattered laser light from particles was detected instead of a reduction of laser intensity. This part of the project proves Mie theory which states that the the forward scattered light is in the forward direction. To double check this result, a beam pass was installed in front of the photo detector and the calculated percentage of <b>counting</b> <b>accuracy</b> was very close to the one without a beam stop. It was also checked that the system was capable of detection fluorescent particle after the installation of a high bass filter which passes fluorescent wavelength signals (green) and blocks the blue ray signals.

40|$|Active ageing is {{presented}} as a potential panacea for the challenges faced due to population ageing. Work presented in this Thesis improves the integration and evaluation of sensor technology, embedded within a clothing system, designed specifically for the active ageing. A review of wearable sensors highlighted issues involving sensor integration, placement, validation and the effects of body shape and size as key challenges. These issues guided the focus of four studies within the Thesis. A study assessing the effect placing an accelerometer within clothing had on step <b>count</b> <b>accuracy</b> has been undertaken. Results demonstrated that a reliable step-count can be achieved from accelerometers placed within clothing at the sternum, waist or lower back. Subsequently, an investigation into the optimal location of an accelerometer to classify a range of everyday activities was perfonned. Results demonstrated data from the hip as the best single location to perfonn activity recognition. Following on from this, 3 D body scanning was used to assess the effect of adiposity on the <b>accuracy</b> of step <b>count</b> obtained from an accelerometer. This study established that neither BMI, waist circumference nor ABVol had an effect on step <b>count</b> <b>accuracy</b> obtained from an accelerometer placed at the chest, waist or lower back. This adds clarity to the current inconsistencies within the literature. Considering a different fonn of sensor technology, the perfonnance of textile electrodes, integrated within custom fitted garments was investigated. Performance tests indicated that the custom garments did not perform accurately during tasks which included movement of the arms and torso. The performance during these tasks, did, however, vary considerably between subjects. The incorporation of these findings within the design of smart garments will help to ensure that wearable sensors and systems meet their potential, particularly in the role of supporting the health and wellbeing of an active ageing society.

When subjects monitored these sequences of tones for the duration of a probe tone, recognition leveled off at a lower asymptote for sequences of tones alternating in frequency.

Nonetheless, step <b>counting</b> <b>accuracy</b> can be hampered by fluctuations in walking pace or demeanor. Here, we assess whether the use of various sensor fusion techniques, each combining bilateral wrist accelerometer data, may increase step count robustness. By collecting data from 27 healthy subjects, we find that high-level step fusion leads to substantially improved accuracy across diverse walking scenarios. Gait cycle analysis illustrates that wrist devices can recurrently detect steps proximal to toe-off events. Collectively, our study suggests that dual-wrist sensor fusion may enable robust gait quantification in free-living environments. Comment: NIPS 2017 Machine Learning for Health Worksho...|$|E
