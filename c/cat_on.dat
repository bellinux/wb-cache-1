5|$|After he {{graduated}} from high school in 1973, Willis took a job as a security guard at the Salem Nuclear Power Plant and transported work crews at the DuPont Chambers Works factory in Deepwater, New Jersey. After working as a private investigator (a role he would play in the television series Moonlighting and the 1991 film The Last Boy Scout), Willis turned to acting. He enrolled in the Drama Program at Montclair State University, where he was cast in the class production of <b>Cat</b> <b>on</b> a Hot Tin Roof.

5|$|During February 1966, {{as part of}} an American road-building program {{designed}} to challenge the Viet Cong's ability to manoeuvre in the areas around Saigon, the US 1st Engineer Battalion—under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Howard Sargent—had been engaged in constructing an all-weather road between Route 13 and Route 15 in central Binh Duong Province, west of Ben <b>Cat,</b> <b>on</b> the northern apex of the Viet Cong base area known as the Iron Triangle. This road was planned to cut the communist supply routes between War Zone C, the Mekong Delta, the Iron Triangle and War Zone D, while it would also link the two forward brigades of the US 1st Infantry Division between Phuoc Vinh and Lai Khe and help to extend the authority of the South Vietnamese government.|$|E
5|$|Hector and Tabitha leave. Katy is spooked by the house, {{especially}} when she finds a stuffed <b>cat</b> <b>on</b> the sofa. She sees an old photograph of Hector, Tabitha and Andras as children, but Andras does not look disabled. Katy's friend Shell arrives and plays with Hector's stairlift, sending it upstairs. Katy warns Shell not to break anything, and is startled to see the now-live cat. Katy tries to call her father so she can leave, but the house has no mobile phone signal and the house phone's party line is tied up. As she prepares to leave, the stairlift returns downstairs and Andras's bell rings. Katy is scared of going upstairs, but, at Shell's insistence, the two go to check on him.|$|E
5|$|In {{the mid-1970s}} Olivier became {{increasingly}} involved in television work, a medium {{of which he}} was initially dismissive. In 1973 he provided the narration for a 26-episode documentary, The World at War, which chronicled the events of the Second World War, and won a second Emmy Award for Long Day's Journey into Night (1973). In 1975 he won another Emmy for Love Among the Ruins. The following year he appeared in adaptations of Tennessee Williams's <b>Cat</b> <b>on</b> a Hot Tin Roof and Harold Pinter's The Collection.

40|$|Cats are generalist predators {{that have}} been widely {{introduced}} to the world's 179 000 islands. Once introduced to islands, <b>cats</b> prey <b>on</b> a variety of native species many of which lack evolved defenses against mammalian predators and can suffer severe population declines and even extinction. As islands house {{a disproportionate share of}} terrestrial biodiversity, the impacts of invasive <b>cats</b> <b>on</b> islands may have significant biodiversity impacts. Much of this threatened biodiversity can be protected by eradicating cats from islands. Information on the relative impacts of <b>cats</b> <b>on</b> different native species in different types of island ecosystems can increase the efficiency of this conservation tool. We reviewed feral <b>cat</b> impacts <b>on</b> native island vertebrates. Impacts of feral <b>cats</b> <b>on</b> vertebrates have been reported from at least 120 different islands on at least 175 vertebrates (25 reptiles, 123 birds, and 27 mammals), many of which are listed by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. A meta-analysis suggests that cat impacts were greatest on endemic species, particularly mammals and greater when non-native prey species were also introduced. Feral <b>cats</b> <b>on</b> islands are responsible for at least 14 % global bird, mammal, and reptile extinctions and are the principal threat to almost 8 % of critically endangered birds, mammals, and reptiles...|$|R

In November 1963 the Robbins Report {{recommended}} that the CATs should become technological universities; and on 4 April 1967 a Charter was established creating the University of Salford.
