40|$|A {{previous}} study explored land–ocean {{differences in the}} warm-rain formation process. In that study, aerosol effects were removed, or at least partially removed, but some land–ocean differences remained. Therefore, the study hypothesized that the land–ocean difference in the microphysical structure of warm clouds and {{in the formation of}} warm rain can be explained by differences in the nature of updraughts. To test this hypothesis, this study provides a detailed analysis of the land–ocean differences in warm clouds using a combination of CloudSat and MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) observations, ground-based measurements obtained from Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM), as well as a simple model framework. Our results show that a stronger updraught increases the height at which significant coalescence begins, and also prolongs the lifetime of falling drops promoting larger droplet growth. A consequence of this difference is that drizzle is less frequently observed at cloud base over land. Our results point to the critical role of the strength of the <b>convective</b> <b>updraught</b> in the warm-rain formation process...|$|E
40|$|At present, {{anthropogenic}} halogens and oceanic {{emissions of}} very short-lived substances (VSLSs) both {{contribute to the}} observed stratospheric ozone depletion. Emissions of the long-lived anthropogenic halogens have been reduced and are currently declining, whereas emissions of the biogenic VSLSs are expected to increase in future climate due to anthropogenic activities affecting oceanic production and emissions. Here, we introduce a new approach for assessing the impact of oceanic halocarbons on stratospheric ozone by calculating their ozone depletion potential (ODP) -weighted emissions. Seasonally and spatially dependent, global distributions are derived within a case-study framework for CHBr 3 for the period 1999 – 2006. At present, ODP-weighted emissions of CHBr 3 amount up to 50 % of ODP-weighted anthropogenic emissions of CFC- 11 and to 9 % of all long-lived ozone depleting halogens. The ODP-weighted emissions are large where strong oceanic emissions coincide with high-reaching convective activity and show pronounced peaks at the Equator and the coasts with largest contributions from the Maritime Continent and western Pacific Ocean. Variations of tropical convective activity lead to seasonal shifts in the spatial distribution of the trajectory-derived ODP with the updraught mass flux, used {{as a proxy for}} trajectory-derived ODP, explaining 71 % of the variance of the ODP distribution. Future climate projections based on the RCP 8. 5 scenario suggest a 31 % increase of the ODP-weighted CHBr 3 emissions by 2100 compared to present values. This increase is related to a larger <b>convective</b> <b>updraught</b> mass flux in the upper troposphere and increasing emissions in a future climate. However, at the same time, it is reduced by less effective bromine-related ozone depletion due to declining stratospheric chlorine concentrations. The comparison of the ODP-weighted emissions of short- and long-lived halocarbons provides a new concept for assessing the overall impact of oceanic halocarbon emissions on stratospheric ozone depletion for current conditions and future projections...|$|E
40|$|The salient facts {{concerning}} the dynamical, physical and electrical properties of a thunderstorm, {{and of the}} detailed structure and associated electric field-changes of lightning flashes, are marshalled to deduce the criteria for a satisfactory quantitative theory of charge generation and separation leading {{to the growth of}} electric fields strong enough to initiate and to sustain lightning activity. A quantitative theory is presented of how charges are generated and separated when supercooled cloud droplets make grazing contact with the undersides of hail pellets (graupel) polarized initially by the Earth's fine-weather electric field. The rebounding droplets acquire a positive charge and are carried by the <b>convective</b> <b>updraught</b> towards the top of the cloud, while the hail pellets carrying a net negative charge fall towards cloud base. This creates a vertical dipole field which increases the polarizing charges on the hail pellets and so accelerates the rates of charge generation and separation, and so reinforces the vertical electrical field, which grows exponentially until insulation of the air breaks down and triggers a lightning flash. It is demonstrated that a thunderstorm cell, 2 km in diameter, producing small hail falling at 30 mm h- 1 can produce vertical electric fields of 5000 V cm- 1 in about 10 min involving the separation of 50 C of charge, enough to initiate a lightning flash which, on average, neutralizes about 20 C. As long as the hail persists, it continues to generate and separate sufficient charge to produce a succession of lightning flashes at about 30 s intervals. More frequent discharges at say 10 s intervals would require high rates of hail production in larger cells but {{are more likely to be}} produced by large multi-cellular storms sustained by strong convective currents for perhaps several hours...|$|E

We analyze the dynamics and kinematics of ex-Gaston to investigate the role of dry, environmental air in the failed redevelopment.

40|$|Idealised convection-permitting {{simulations}} {{are used}} to quantify the impact of embedded convection on the precipitation generated by moist flow over midlatitude mountain ridges. A broad range of mountain dimensions and moist stabilities are considered to encompass a spectrum of physically plausible flows. The simulations reveal that convection only enhances orographic precipitation in cap clouds that are otherwise unable to efficiently convert cloud condensate into precipitate. For tall and wide mountains (e. g. the Washington Cascades or the southern Andes), precipitate forms efficiently through vapour deposition and collection, {{even in the absence}} of embedded convection. When embedded convection develops in such clouds, it produces competing effects (enhanced condensation in updraughts and enhanced evaporation through turbulent mixing and compensating subsidence) that cancel to yield little net change in precipitation. By contrast, convection strongly enhances precipitation over short and narrow mountains (e. g. the UK Pennines or the Oregon Coastal Range) where precipitation formation is otherwise highly inefficient. Although cancellation between increased condensation and evaporation still occurs, the enhanced precipitation formation within the <b>convective</b> <b>updraughts</b> leads to a net increase in precipitation efficiency. The simulations are physically interpreted through non-dimensional diagnostics and relevant time-scales that govern advective, microphysical, and convective processes...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{importance}} of dimensionality for the characteristics of simulations performed with cloud-system resolving models (CSRMs). In addition to intrinsic questions related to dimensionality in CSRMs, the issue has gained added interest since CSRMs can be utilized instead of conventional cloud parametrizations to represent deep convection within global climate models. Such CSRMs may be either two- or three-dimensional. CSRM simulations of five observed cases of deep convection are performed in both two and three dimensions (2 D and 3 D) {{with the aim of}} elucidating the impact of dimensionality on overall cloud statistics. Observed profiles of the large-scale average of advection of temperature and humidity are applied to initiate and maintain the convection. Two of the cases are from tropical oceanic regions. The other three cases are continental. The average ascent rate in deep <b>convective,</b> cloudy <b>updraughts</b> is about 20 - 50 % higher at mid-levels of the troposphere in 3 D than in 2 D, for all cases. This corresponds to an increase by a similar percentage in the vertical mass flux of deep updraughts in the oceanic cases. Furthermore, the weak ascent (0. 1 < w < 1 m s(- 1)) outside the deep <b>convective</b> <b>updraughts</b> is much less prevalent in 3 D than in 2 D, with vertical velocities being about 20 % lower for a given cumulative frequency and a lower vertical mass flux. Downdraughts are weaker in 3 D, for most cases. There is a substantial sensitivity of the vertical profiles of cloud liquid and cloud ice, and of other microphysical species, to dimensionality. This is consistent with the sensitivity of the dynamics of convection. Corresponding changes in radiative transfer, especially in the short-wave band, result from the cloud-radiative interactions. In particular, the peak in domain-averaged cloud liquid content in the melting layer is about 50 % higher in most of the 2 D simulations. The land cases display more sensitivity of the short-wave radiative flux to the choice of orientation of the vertical plane of 2 D simulations...|$|R

Idealized numerical model experiments are presented to investigate the convective generation of vertical vorticity in a tropical depression.

Another aim is to isolate the effects of a unidirectional boundary layer wind profile on storm structure, especially on vertical vorticity production. A third aim is to isolate the effects of a vortex boundary-layer wind profile on tropical deep convection, focusing especially on the morphology of vertical vorticity that develops. The growing convective updraughts, that are initiated by a near surface thermal perturbation, amplify locally the ambient rotation at low levels by more than an order of magnitude and this vorticity persists long after the updraught has decayed, supporting the results of an earlier study.

40|$|Simulations of {{tropical}} convection from an operational {{numerical weather prediction}} model are evaluated with {{the focus on the}} model's ability to simulate the observed high ice water contents associated with the outflow of deep convection and to investigate the modelled processes that control the phase composition {{of tropical}} convective clouds. The 1  km horizontal grid length model that uses a single-moment microphysics scheme simulates the intensification and decay of convective strength across the mesoscale convective system. However, deep convection is produced too early, the OLR (outgoing longwave radiation) is underestimated and the areas with reflectivities >  30  dBZ are overestimated due to too much rain above the freezing level, stronger updraughts and larger particle sizes in the model. The inclusion of a heterogeneous rain-freezing parameterisation and the use of different ice size distributions show better agreement with the observed reflectivity distributions; however, this simulation still produces a broader profile with many high-reflectivity outliers demonstrating the greater occurrence of convective cells in the simulations. Examining the phase composition shows that the amount of liquid and ice in the modelled convective updraughts is controlled by the following: the size of the ice particles, with larger particles growing more efficiently through riming and producing larger IWC (ice water content); the efficiency of the warm rain process, with greater cloud water contents being available to support larger ice growth rates; and exclusion or limitation of graupel growth, with more mass contained in slower falling snow particles resulting in an increase of in-cloud residence times and more efficient removal of LWC (liquid water content). In this simulated case using a 1  km grid length model, horizontal mass divergence in the mixed-phase regions of convective updraughts is most sensitive to the turbulence formulation. Greater mixing of environmental air into cloudy updraughts in the region of − 30 to 0  °C produces more mass divergence indicative of greater entrainment, which generates a larger stratiform rain area. Above these levels in the purely ice region of the simulated updraughts, the <b>convective</b> <b>updraught</b> buoyancy is controlled by the ice particle sizes, demonstrating the importance of the microphysical processes on the convective dynamics in this simulated case study using a single-moment microphysics scheme.  The single-moment microphysics scheme in the model is unable to simulate the observed reduction of mean mass-weighted ice diameter as the ice water content increases. The inability of the model to represent the observed variability of the ice size distribution would be improved {{with the use of a}} double-moment microphysics scheme...|$|E
40|$|As long as {{convection}} is {{not completely}} resolved by the model grid, a subgrid deep convection scheme has to provide its contribution to the clouds and precipitation. How to combine this with the contribution from resolved condensation, {{in a way to}} get results independent of numerical issues, is a tough problem. From the Clausius-Clapeyron and the energy equations, it can be shown that the saturation moisture decreases when the vertical velocity increases. This is also true at the scale of the grid box averages. In presence of <b>convective</b> <b>updraughts</b> on a fraction of the grid box σu ¿ 1, the resolved vertical velocity ω results from averaging large updraught velocities ωu with a near zero upwards velocity ωe in the updraughts environment.

40|$|Die Vorhersagbarkeit von Einzelzellgewittern im Alpenraum, insbesondere in Abwesenheit von Fronten unter sogenannten Schönwetterbedingungen, gestaltet sich als schwierige Aufgabe für Meteorologen. Umso wichtiger ist es, das Wissen über Faktoren, die zur Initiierung von hochre- ichender Feuchtekonvektion (deep moist convection, DMC) unter solchen Umgebungsbedingun- gen beitragen, stets zu verbessern. Fallstudien mit Satellitenbildern haben gezeigt, dass Feuchte- gradienten in der mittleren oder oberen Troposphäre (upper tropospheric {{moisture}} gradients, UTMG) eine bevorzugte Lage für die erste Initiierung von DMC unter Schönwetterbedinungen bei weitverbreiteter flacher Konvektion über dem Gebirge darstellen. (Krennert and Zwatz- Meise, 2003). Anhand von zwei WRF-Simulationen mit drei genesteten Domänen (20 km, 4 km, 800 m) werden Faktoren, die zur Initiierung von DMC beigetragen haben könnten, für zwei repräsentative Fälle im Alpenraum analysiert. Dazu werden verschiedene Hypothesen im Zusammenhang mit UTMG und deren Rolle bei der Initiierung von DMC untersucht. Ein wesentlicher Teil besteht darin, verschiedene Instabilitäten zu untersuchen, einschließlich der feucht-symmetrischen Instabilität (moist symmetric instability, MSI) als mögliche begünstigende Ursache für den Übergang von flacher zu hochreichender Konvektion. Die Ergebnisse der ersten Fallstudie vom 7. Juli 2014 zeigen, dass die Initiierung von DMC tatsächlich in Zusammenhang mit einem Gradienten der relativen Feuchte in 300 hPa auftritt. Sowohl die 4 -km, als auch die 800 -m Domäne erweisen sich als konvektionsauflösend und in guter Übereinstimmung mit den Beobachtungen. Zudem stellt sich heraus, dass die Umgebung beim Übergang von flacher zu hochreichender Konvektion von Bereichen negativer (gesättigter) poten- tieller Vorticity in der unteren bis mittleren Troposphäre und hohen SCAPE-Werten (slantwise convective available potential energy) geprägt ist, die beide Indikatoren für symmetrische, jedoch auch statische Instabilität sind. Für eine bessere Abgrenzung dieser beiden Instabilitäten wur- den Trajektorien berechnet. Es hat sich herausgestellt, dass es unter Verwendung des gewählten Modells keinen eindeutigen Hinweis auf eine begünstigende Rolle von MSI auf die Entwicklung hochreichender Konvektion gibt, da die Größenordnung der vertikalen Windkomponente jene der beiden horizontalen Windkomponenten im Aufwindbereich zu jeder Zeit übertrifft. Die Ergebnisse der zweiten Fallstudie zeigen zwar, dass die Konvektion wieder entsprechend gut aufgelöst wird, jedoch zeigt sich die konvektive Aktivität mehr verbreitet als dies in den Satel- litenbildern der Fall ist. Zudem ist der Gradient der relativen Feuchte vergleichsweise schwächer ausgeprägt. Auch die Indikatoren für symmetrische Instabilität (negative EPV, SCAPE) sind in Zusammenhang mit der Initiierung von DMC nur wenig bedeutsam. The predictability of single-cell convection in the Alpine region, {{especially in}} the absence of fronts under so called fair-weather situations, remains a challenging task for forecasters. There- fore it is important to gain knowledge about the key factors that contribute to the initiation of single-cell deep moist convection (DMC) under these conditions. Satellite studies have shown that favourable locations for the first initiation of DMC under fair-weather conditions with widespread shallow convection over mountainous terrain are water vapour gradients in the middle or upper troposphere, as of now termed UTMG (upper tropospheric moisture gradient) (Krennert and Zwatz-Meise, 2003). Based on two WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting) hindcast simulations with three nested domains (20 km, 4 km, 800 m), the factors that {{may have contributed to the}} initiation of DMC are analysed for representative cases in the Alpine region. Therefore, different hypotheses re- lated to UTMG are investigated with regard to their role in supporting the initiation of DMC. In particular, different types of instabilities, including moist symmetric instability (MSI), are inves- tigated as possible mechanisms for favouring the transition from shallow to deep moist convection. Analysis of the simulated case of 7 July 2014 reveals that the initiation of DMC can actually be related to a gradient in relative humidity at 300 hPa. Both the 4 -km and 800 -m domain resolve convection in reasonably good agreement with the observations. The transition from shallow to deep convection takes place in an environment characterized by negative (saturated) equivalent potential vorticity (EPV) at lower and mid-levels of the troposphere and high values of slantwise convective potential available energy (SCAPE), both of which are indicators for moist symmet- ric instabilities, but also gravitational instabilities. Forward trajectories have been computed to provide a better distinction between the different types of instabilities. It has turned out that there is no clear evidence for a contribution of MSI to the evolution of DMC regarding the chosen model and settings. Here, the vertical wind component seems to dominate the horizontal wind components within the <b>convective</b> <b>updraught</b> at any time. A second simulated case (21 July 2013) shows that the convection is again resolved by the model. In this case the first initiation of DMC is not clearly related to the UTMG and convec- tion is generally more widespread. The strongest gradient in relative humidity is found at lower levels, i. e. at 400 hPa, the gradients being generally lower as compared to case 1. Indicators for MSI in terms of negative EPV and SCAPE are much weaker and can not be clearly connected to the area where DMC was initiated...|$|E
40|$|A {{conceptual}} model of tropical convection frequently used in convective parametrization schemes {{is that of}} a parcel process in which boundary-layer air, characterized by high equivalent potential temperature, ascends to great heights in <b>convective</b> <b>updraughts,</b> while air above the planetary boundary layer with lower equivalent potential temperature mixes into convective downdraughts and sinks. However, airborne Doppler-radar data show that organized deep convective systems over the western tropical Paci c warm pool are often characterized by layers of ascending in ow » 0. 5 – 4 km in depth. These in ow layers do not consist merely of boundary-layer air. In this study a high-resolution numerical cloud model is employed to investigate these in ow layers.

40|$|This study {{presents}} {{an evaluation of}} the size and strength of <b>convective</b> <b>updraughts</b> in high-resolution simulations by the UK Met Office Unified Model (UM). Updraught velocities have been estimated from range–height indicator (RHI) Doppler velocity measurements using the Chilbolton advanced meteorological radar, as part of the Dynamical and Microphysical Evolution of Convective Storms (DYMECS) project. Based on mass continuity and the vertical integration of the observed radial convergence, vertical velocities tend to be underestimated for convective clouds due to the undetected cross-radial convergence. Velocity fields from the UM at a resolution corresponding to the radar observations are used to scale such estimates to mitigate the inherent biases. The analysis of more than 100 observed and simulated storms indicates that the horizontal scale of updraughts in simulations tend to decrease with grid length; the 200 m grid length agreed most closely with the observations. Typical updraught mass fluxes in the 500 m grid length simulations were up to an order of magnitude greater than observed, and greater still in the 1. 5 km grid length simulations. The effect of increasing the mixing length in the sub-grid turbulence scheme depends on the grid length. For the 1. 5 km simulations, updraughts were weakened though their horizontal scale remained largely unchanged. Progressively more so for the sub-kilometre grid lengths, updraughts were broadened and intensified; horizontal scale was now determined by the mixing length rather than the grid length. In general, simulated updraughts were found to weaken too quickly with height. The findings were supported by the analysis of the widths of reflectivity patterns in both the simulations and observations...|$|R

The integrity of the simulation is judged by comparing analyses thereof with those of the unprecedented observational data gathered in Earl. Consistent with the classical view of spin-up, the amplification of the tangential wind field above the boundary layer is found to occur as the absolute angular momentum surfaces are drawn inwards by the aggregate heating of the rotating convective clouds in the interior of the vortex. In addition to this classical pathway, spin-up occurs within the inner-core boundary layer, where the maximum tangential winds occur. The latter is another element of the new paradigm. Despite the detrimental influence of the shear on the vortex alignment and in depressing the pseudo-equivalent potential temperature outside the developing eyewall, the combined eddy processes associated with the vortical plume structures in and around the developing eyewall region are shown to contribute to an enhanced overturning circulation and an intensifying storm. These eddy processes are distinctly agradient effects that are not features of the classical spin-up mechanism.

40|$|International audienceOn {{the evening}} of 9 August 2006, a {{mesoscale}} convective system (MCS) having a north-south oriented squall-line organization formed over the border between Chad and Nigeria. It propagated westward, intensified over Nigeria on 10 August, and reached Niamey (Niger) at 0320 UTC on 11 August. Its passage over Niamey was accompanied by dust lifting and was well tracked by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Doppler radar. The three-dimensional structure of the airflow and precipitation pattern is investigated from regular radar volume scans performed every ten minutes between 0200 and 0321 UTC. The 3 D wind components are deduced from the multiple-Doppler synthesis and continuity adjustment technique (MUSCAT) applied {{to a set of}} three volume scans obtained over a time period of one hour, which are equivalent to a three-radar observation of the squall line when considering a reference frame moving with the system and the hypothesis of a stationary field. Results of the wind synthesis reveal several features commonly observed in tropical squall lines, such as the deep convective cells in front of the system, fed by the monsoon air and extending up to 15 km altitude, and the well-marked stratiform rain region at the rear, associated with mesoscale vertical motions. Forward and trailing anvils are clearly identified as resulting from the outflow of air reaching the tropopause and transported to this level by the sloping <b>convective</b> <b>updraughts</b> occurring in a sheared environment. In the northern part, a deeper and stronger front-to-rear flow at mid-levels is found to contribute to the rearward deflection of the leading line and to promote a broader (over 300 km) stratiform cloud region. Eddy vertical transports of the cross-line momentum mainly accounts for the mid-level flow acceleration due to a momentum redistribution from low to higher levels. The height distribution of hydrometeors and their associated production terms derived from a one-dimensional microphysical retrieval model indicate the distinct roles of the convective and stratiform regions in the formation of graupel and rain, and the respective contributions of cold (riming) and warm (coalescence, melting) processes. Cooling from melting, and heating/cooling from condensation/evaporation processes yield a net decrease and increase of the potential temperature at low and mid-to-upper levels, respectively, with respect to an environmental thermodynamic profile taken three hours ahead of the analysis. Finally, the upper-level rearward flow could convey the non-negligible proportion of ice particles farther from the leading deep convection to the trailing stratiform region, thereby favouring the extent of this region...|$|R
