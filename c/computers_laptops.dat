500|$|Threshold {{was officially}} {{unveiled}} during a media event on September 30, 2014, {{under the name}} Windows 10; Myerson said that Windows 10 would be Microsoft's [...] "most comprehensive platform ever", providing a single, unified platform for desktop <b>computers,</b> <b>laptops,</b> tablets, smartphones, and all-in-one devices. He emphasized that Windows 10 would take steps towards restoring user interface mechanics from Windows 7 to improve the experience for users on non-touch devices, noting criticism of Windows 8's touch-oriented interface by keyboard and mouse users. Despite these concessions, Myerson noted that the touch-oriented interface would evolve as well on 10. In describing the changes, Joe Belfiore likened the two operating systems to electric cars, comparing Windows 7 to a first-generation Toyota Prius hybrid, and Windows 10 to an all-electric Teslaconsidering the latter to be {{an extension of the}} technology first introduced in the former.|$|E

This study focuses on: i) How <b>laptop</b> <b>computers</b> are used in the mathematics classroom, concentrating on the types of software used and the type and the activities conducted. ii) Teachers' attitudes towards the use of <b>laptop</b> <b>computers</b> in the mathematics classroom, in particular how their attitudes and experiences may effect the use of <b>laptop</b> <b>computers.</b> iii) Teachers' perceptions of student benefits in terms of understanding and performing mathematical tasks using <b>laptop</b> <b>computers.</b> This study shows that there is a wide variety of software used and a large number of activities completed in mathematics classrooms with <b>laptop</b> <b>computers.</b> Teachers favoured using spreadsheets above any other type of software and tended to use the <b>laptop</b> <b>computers</b> for computational, open-ended activities rather than conceptual tasks. Teachers had varying attitudes about how and when <b>laptop</b> <b>computers</b> should be used in the mathematics classroom. There appeared to be connections between a teacher's own use of the computer and the way the teacher used the <b>laptop</b> <b>computer</b> in the classroom. Some teachers used the <b>laptop</b> <b>computer</b> very frequently whilst others used them sparingly. The most valuable type of in-service about using computers came from the teacher's own faculty, through formal and informal discussions. Finally, not all teachers believed there were benefits for their students from using <b>laptop</b> <b>computers.</b> There was no conclusive evidence about whether teachers believed their students had an increased ability to understand mathematics due to using <b>laptop</b> <b>computers,</b> but, there was evidence of increased student motivation.
