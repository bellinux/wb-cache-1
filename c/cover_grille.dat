40|$|The {{efficiency}} of the vehicle cooling system strongly depends on the air flow through the radiator core. The flow through the radiator core in turn depends on other panels {{that are in the}} vicinity of the radiator and these include the radiator <b>cover,</b> <b>grille,</b> front inner panel, cowl, floor, etc. A clear understanding of the flow pattern inside the radiator cover is essential for optimizing the radiator cover shape to increase the flow through the radiator core, thereby increasing the thermal {{efficiency of}} the radiator. In this paper, CFD enabled optimization of airflow distribution inside the radiator cover is discussed. Starting from a CFD solution of the baseline design that was validated against indoor test data, a series of optimization cases were executed to arrive at the optimum configuration of the radiator cover. The airflow distribution inside the radiator cover and the flow through the radiator core was monitored to provide a quantitative basis for the optimization process. The CFD analysis was conducted using the commercial software FLUENT™, while the surface and volume mesh were generated using ANSA ™ and TGRID™, respectively. Use of ANSA ™ for surface meshing was instrumental in reducing the CFD cycle time. CFD analysis of the baseline design that was validated against test data showed that significant regions of re-circulating flow existed inside the radiator cover. This recirculation reduced the flow through the radiator core, leading to a build-up of hot air pockets close to the radiator surface and subsequent degradation of radiator thermal efficiency. The CFD enabled optimization led to radiator cover configuration that eliminated these recirculation regions and increased the flow through the radiator core by 34 %. It is anticipated that this increase in radiator core flow would significantly increase the radiator thermal efficiency...|$|E

5000|$|For the 1996 model year, the {{exterior}} {{was given a}} significant facelift, similar to its MN12 cousin Ford Thunderbird. The front and rear bumper <b>covers,</b> headlights, <b>grille,</b> and moulding were updated, giving the car a more modern look. The 4.6-L engine received an updated composite intake manifold, giving the car [...] of additional torque over the 1995 model and the transmission was improved for increased reliability. The interior was given a minor update, which included a revised instrument cluster, much {{like that of the}} Ford Taurus/Mercury Sable of the time and a center console with cup holders. The ashtray and cigarette lighter were relocated to the space previously occupied by the information center, now integrated in the instrument cluster. Another anniversary edition car was built to commemorate 30 years.|$|R

5000|$|In {{automotive}} engineering, a <b>grille</b> <b>covers</b> {{an opening}} in the body of a vehicle to allow air to enter. Most vehicles feature a grille {{at the front of the}} vehicle to protect the radiator and engine. Merriam-Webster describes grilles as [...] "a grating forming a barrier or screen; especially: an ornamental one at the front end of an automobile." [...] Other common grille locations include below the front bumper, in front of the wheels (to cool the brakes), in the cowl for cabin ventilation, or on the rear deck lid (in rear engine vehicles).|$|R
50|$|By 1960, Vox had forsaken {{the more}} {{conservative}} TV-front look for the now legendary cabinet design that has remained largely unchanged since 1960. The new cabinets featured a different covering known as fawn Rexine, which {{was a sort of}} beige leathercloth with a subtle printed grain. The front baffle was now divided by a thin gold-toned strip with the upper valence covered in fawn Rexine, and the lower <b>grille</b> <b>covered</b> in brown diamond cloth. Ventilation was provided by three small brass vents {{on the top of the}} cabinet, and the TV-front's single suitcase type handle was replaced with three leather straps.|$|R
50|$|The VL2C further {{upgraded}} {{the light}} source to 600 W, {{driven by an}} APS600-X lamp PSU. The internal ventilation system was accordingly redesigned to better cool the head—especially the colour / gobo wheels and the beam iris leaves were upgraded for better heat resistance. The speed of the cooling fan was also increased—which led to some complaints (especially from TV studios) about noise. Detachable, external baffles were designed to <b>cover</b> the ventilation <b>grilles</b> {{in the side of}} the luminaire's Upper Enclosure (UPE), in order to deal with this issue; but could occasionally cause overheating in warm environments, leading to lamp shutdown.|$|R
50|$|Standard axial case {{fans are}} 80, 92, 120, 140, 200 and 230 mm in width and length.

Air filters are often used over intake fans, to prevent dust from entering the case and clogging up the internal components. Heatsinks are especially vulnerable to being clogged up, as the insulating effect of the dust will rapidly degrade the heatsink's ability to dissipate heat.|$|R
50|$|The raised {{basement}} {{is finished}} with rusticated granite, while {{the upper floors}} are constructed of brick and concrete and finished in stucco. The north elevation features a centrally placed, projecting, multi-curved parapet and flanking entry portals. The loggias, hallmarks of the Spanish Colonial Revival Style, provide ventilation and shelter from the weather. The openings are segmentally arched with projecting keystones topping the openings. Classically inspired pilasters divide the openings and are skillfully combined with wrought-iron balusters that are located on the second level. Windows are <b>covered</b> with wrought-iron <b>grilles.</b> The clay tile roof with wide overhanging eaves reflects indigenous architectural influence. Supported by paired brackets and set over the building's ornamental cornice, the eaves provide relief from the hot sun and protect the building from rain.|$|R
50|$|After discontinuing {{the first}} {{generation}} LeBaron coupe and convertible in 1986, Chrysler released a new LeBaron for 1987, built on the J platform (a K platform derivative) and available as a coupe or convertible. The all-new LeBaron looked modern and aerodynamic compared to its boxy predecessor. It featured headlights hidden behind retractable metal <b>covers,</b> a waterfall <b>grille,</b> steeply raked windshield, full-width taillight lenses (though only the edges actually lit up), and curved (Coke bottle) style rocker panels. In Mexico, these models were marketed as the Chrysler Phantom.Available engines were the stock 2.2-liter and 2.5-liter, naturally aspirated or turbocharged, and for the 1990 model year a 3.0-liter Mitsubishi V6 became available, although the Mexican Chrysler Phantom R/T DOHC 16V also offered the same 2.2-liter turbo engine as used in the US market Dodge Spirit R/T.|$|R
50|$|The facade, {{consisting}} of loggias to both floors, {{is divided into}} five bays.

50|$|The 1968 Imperial {{was little}} {{changed from the}} {{previous}} year. The grille changed to a brightly chromed one with thin horizontal bars, split in the middle by vertical chrome and a round Imperial Eagle badge. The cornering lamp lenses were now <b>covered</b> by matching <b>grilles.</b> At the rear, the horizontal bars over the taillights remained, but the gas filler door pull was changed to a cast metal eagle instead of a round knob containing a plastic emblem. All 1968s came with a Federally mandated energy absorbing steering column. The base level model was cancelled after only one year and the four-door sedan {{became part of the}} Crown level of trim. This was also the last year for the Imperial convertible. A total of 15,367 Imperials were sold in 1968.|$|R

25|$|The new car {{featured}} a more prominent long hood short deck styling, and was longer lower and {{wider than the}} 1969 models. The roofline was lower, while all models now {{featured a}} much less formal roof line than previous years. The windshield rake was increased, and the SportsRoof models had an even flatter fastback roofline. The overall styling appeared much more aerodynamic than years previous, and featured a pointed front end. The <b>grille</b> <b>covered</b> the full width of the front fascia, and surrounded the quad headlights. The front fender line extended to front door, sloping downward and gradually disappearing in the quarter panel. Both front and rear bumpers were slim tight fitting chromed units, that carefully followed the body lines. The taillights were situated in the rear panel above the bumper, and were now long rectangular units with rounded outer edges.|$|R

40|$|Aero-engines {{incorporate}} various bearing {{chambers and}} these typically contain bearings, seals, rotating shafts, stationary walls and struts, and sometimes gears. Oil is supplied for lubrication and cooling and is removed (scavenged) from the sump {{region of the}} chamber (note that {{in some parts of}} the world the entire bearing chamber is referred to as the sump). Depending on the location and function of the bearing chamber, the sump region may be deep or shallow. Effective oil removal is essential as unnecessary working of the oil can lead to excessive heat generation and reduced overall efficiency. Therefore the design of the scavenge region in a bearing chamber, as well as the ability to assess its performance is very important. Previous work, much of which was conducted at the University of Nottingham Technology Centre in Gas Turbine Transmission Systems (UTC) suggests that oil often does not flow cleanly into the off-take due to a combination of several factors: oil momentum, windage, three-dimensional air flow that blocks the off-take flow or transports oil away from the off-take, and pooling because of separated air flow that acts on the oil once oil momentum is dissipated. Experimental research at the UTC found that scavenge performance is highly affected by the sump geometry, especially its depth. Variations of shallow sumps, although some are better than the others, cannot offer the same level of performance as a deep one. However space limitation in an engine often only allows for a shallow sump. This paper presents some experimental exploration on new design ideas. They are in the form of various inserts and attachments that were designed to improve scavenge performance of a shallow sump. These “custom” sumps were tested on the UTC’s scavenge test facility at various flow settings (wall film/flying droplets, liquid flow rates, scavenge ratios, shaft speeds). The residence volumes were measured and compared to a baseline configuration with reduction in residence volume desirable. The inserts tested were a <b>Grille</b> <b>Cover,</b> a Stepped Spillway, a Perforated Plate and a Porous Insert. Both the Porous Insert and the Perforated Plate showed reduced residence volumes in the demanding droplet/windage dominated flow condition with the Perforated Plate offering the best improvement over baseline...|$|R
40|$|An aero-engine {{bearing chamber}} is a {{structure}} {{that is used to}} contain and collect oil used in lubricating and cooling the bearings supporting the high-speed engine shafts. There are various bearings in an aero-engine. Within the bearing chambers, there are typically the bearings, rotating shafts, seals and gears (in some designs). The walls of the bearing chamber are stationary and there are vents and sumps to take out the oil, via an offtake pipe, and the sealing air. The oil collected via the sump and vents is recycled and used again in the loop. To prevent oil degradation and reduce chance of coking in the chamber, it is desired that all of the oil goes through the recycling loop, with no oil staying longer than necessary in the chamber. The sealing air is used to maintain a positive pressure to keep the oil within the chamber. The flow inside a bearing chamber is highly turbulent and consists of a rotating mixture of oil and air. A smaller amount of the oil, mostly as oil-droplets, exits at the vents and is separated from the air using de-aerators [1]. It is expected that by gravity, most of the oil collects at the sump and can be easily scavenged. This is provided the sump can be large enough. The geometry of a bearing chamber is, however, complex largely because of space limitations. It is very important that oil is not resident longer than necessary to prevent over-heating and therefore deterioration or coking. Experimental observations by Chandra & Simmons [2], have shown that bearing chambers with deep sumps perform better that those with shallow sumps. Since shallow sumps are inevitable, a number of innovative studies have been done to improve bearing chamber designs. The presence of air in the oil (e. g. as bubbles) reduces the efficiency of the scavenging pump. Other factors such as oil momentum and windage can take oil away from the off-take pipe potentially increasing oil residence volume. Chandra & Simmons [2] placed inserts such as <b>grille</b> <b>cover,</b> perforated plate, etc, on a side of the bearing wall and improvements in the residence volume were seen. In this work, we are looking at a detailed computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation of one of the inserts that performed well. This will aid understanding of the flow characteristics of using an insert to improve oil residence in a bearing chamber...|$|R
