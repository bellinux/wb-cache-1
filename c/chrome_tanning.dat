Apart from environmental problems, this costs the industry ninety million dollars worth of valuable <b>chrome</b> <b>tanning</b> agents annually. The research was aimed at minimising the environmental impact of <b>chrome</b> <b>tanning</b> by the improvement of the {{efficiency of the}} classical system through the addition of auxiliary chemicals during <b>chrome</b> <b>tanning,</b> changing the present technology and by modifying the <b>chrome</b> <b>tanning</b> agent itself. Two different chemicals were synthesised. These were included in a detail study with six other commercial auxiliary chemicals to improve the classical system. Here the possibilities of improving the availability of carboxylic groups for better efficiency of <b>chrome</b> <b>tanning</b> were explored. A considerable improvement, about 90 - 93 % for hides and 95 - 96 % for lamb skins was obtained with these two synthesised chemicals. A novel chrome terming technique for tanning of lamb skins was developed where conventional acid-salt pickling was completely eliminated and tanning conducted after deliming at pH 7 to 8. 5. This novel technique also did not require basification and masking agents for the completion of <b>chrome</b> <b>tanning</b> and saved considerable amount of money for the tanner. This new approach of tanning gave higher exhaustion of chrome to the extent of 96 - 97 % with improved physical properties and yield of leather. The mechanism of the new tanning system was also postulated. Seventy percent of sodium sulphate, one of the pollutants of <b>chrome</b> <b>tanning,</b> was removed from the commercial sulphur dioxide reduced 33 % basic chrome sulphate by crystallisation technique. Attempts were made to separate various species of chrome complexes with HPLC, Gel filtration (Saphadex G 25) and Ion exchange chromatography (SP Saphadex C 25) and finally six species of chrome complexes were separated from the commercial sulphur dioxide reduced 33 % basic chrome sulphate liquor with ion exchange columns (Dowex 50 W x 8 and Dowex IX 8 - 50). It was interesting to find that about 20 % of the commercial basic chrome sulphate were anionic and nonionic complexes. In an attempt to understand their reactivity, separated species of complexes were studied for their ageing and tanning characteristics. This showed {{that as long as the}} pH of the liquor was kept constant, there was no significant change in these complexes due to ageing. Tanning affinity of each of these complexes was studied on pickled lamb skins at three different temperatures, namely 20, 30 and 40 °C. In general, anionic complex had no reactivity and the noniontc species was less reactive at normal tanning pH between 3. 0 and 4. 2. Similar tanning trials with cationic complexes showed that the affinity of these complexes with skin collagen increased progressively with the cationic charge of the complexes up to (Cr) 4 +, and then remained constant for complexes with higher charges than (Cr) 4 +. The reactivity of the combined cationic complexes was studied against standard commercial chrome control on similar pickled and degreased lamb skins. It was found that this combined cationic fraction tanned leather rapidly and more efficiently. The exhaustion of chrome, established through the analysis of chrome in the exhaust chrome liquor with the atomic absorption spectrophotometer, was 95. 11 % against 72. 25 % for the control. The quality of leather obtained was shown to meet the requirements of leather prescribed in the European Commission's guide lines. A polyamide resin was synlhcsised. Initially 0. 75 g to 1. 25 g resin/mole of Cr 2 O 3 was used to modify the 33 % basic chrome sulphate liquor. The ageing characteristics of these complexes were also studied over a six month period. It was clear that the polyamide formed a stable complex with basic chrome sulphate and the ageing did not alter their characteristics significantly. Ion exchange separation (Dowex 50 W x 8) of the chrome-polyamide complex showed that this complex had an ionic distribution closer to phthalate masked basic chrome sulphate. Tanning trials with chrome-polyamide complex on pickled lamb skins and cow hides at low pH like the conventional <b>chrome</b> <b>tanning</b> showed slightly better chrome exhaustion for lamb skin but no significant improvement for side leather. But when lamb skins were tanned according to the newly developed <b>chrome</b> <b>tanning</b> process, a significant improvement in <b>chrome</b> <b>tanning</b> was obtained.

The spectra also showed other elements that potentially provide useful information on how both modern and historic leather artifacts were processed. VIII. Further Research Further analysis of leather objects dating from the 1890 s onward would confirm the effectiveness of XRF in identifying <b>chrome</b> <b>tanning,</b> as well as shed light on various factors that may affect the levels of chromium detected in the leather, such as thickness/density, changes in the <b>chrome</b> <b>tanning</b> manufacturing process, the use of combination tannages, or the possible presence of other chromium-containing compounds, for instance colorants, used in the finishing process. Investigating the efficacy of a vacuum chamber-based or helium flow XRF technique to detect aluminum would also be important, as <b>chrome</b> <b>tanning</b> was primarily used at first to imitate kid leathers traditionally produced by alum tawing. Many of the 20 th century kid leather objects present in museum collections may have been produced via <b>chrome</b> <b>tanning</b> alone or in combination with alum tawing or even a pale vegetable tanning, and knowing these differences would allow these objects to be put in a clearer historical and technological context. Finally, future experiments should include the development of reference standards for quantitative XRF so that the minimum detection limits for this type of analysis can be determined...|$|E
40|$|Tannery {{effluents}} {{are one of}} {{the major}} sources of environmental pollution with various toxic parameters and the effluent generated during liming and pickling operations of leather processing are even more dangerous due to their high and low pH range, respectively. In the present work, liming and pickling streams generated during the production of <b>chrome</b> <b>tanned</b> cow hide shoe upper was treated at different ratios and optimized the pH range 6. 5 - 7. 5. The effluents were mixed at different ratios without adding any foreign chemicals and obtained the results 88 % reduction of COD, 94 % reduction of BOD and 97 % removal of total solids...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAcrylic {{copolymer}} nanoemulsions {{were prepared}} based on methyl methacrylate (MMA) and butyl acrylate (BA). The prepared acrylic copolymer emulsions were characterized using solid content, rheological properties, molecular weight, MFFT and TEM. The prepared polymers {{were used as}} pre-tanning of the depickled hide to enhance the physico-mechanical properties of tanned leather. The key parameters which affect exhaustion and fixation of <b>chrome</b> <b>tan</b> as well as shrinkage temperature of the tanned leather were studied and evaluated using SEM, shrinkage temperature and the mechanical properties of the pre-tanned leather. The results showed that, the prepared polymers A & C are the best polymers in improving the physical properties of the treated leather. Furthermore, the shrinkage temperature and the mechanical properties of the tanned leather were improved. In addition, a significant enhancement in {{the texture of the}} leather treated by the polymers was noticed as proved by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) ...|$|R
50|$|The acidity of hides {{once they}} have {{finished}} pickling will typically be between pH of 2.8-3.2. At this point the hides are loaded in a drum and immersed in a float containing the tanning liquor. The hides are allowed to soak (while the drum slowly rotates about its axle) and the tanning liquor slowly penetrates through the full substance of the hide. Regular checks {{will be made to}} see the penetration by cutting the cross section of a hide and observing the degree of penetration. Once an even degree of penetration is observed, the pH of the float is slowly raised in a process called basification. This basification process fixes the tanning material to the leather, and the more tanning material fixed, the higher the hydrothermal stability and increased shrinkage temperature resistance of the leather. The pH of the leather when <b>chrome</b> <b>tanned</b> would typically finish somewhere between 3.8-4.2.|$|R
