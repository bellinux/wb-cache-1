40|$|Summary A {{registry}} of haematopoietic malignancies {{was established}} on January 1, 1980 {{in order to}} accurately determine the incidence and epidemiological features of these diseases {{in the department of}} C 6 te d'Or (population 478, 000). Over five years (1980 - 1984), 704 new cases were recorded. The crude incidence rates were 32. 7 per 100, 000 for males and 24. 9 per 100, 000 for females. The corresponding age standardized rates were 26. 4 and 16. 7. The sex ratio was 1. 6 : 1. In males, <b>chronic</b> <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>leukaemias</b> were the most common haematopoietic malignancies, followed by non Hodgkin's lymphomas, acute leukaemias and multiple myelomas. In females, multiple myelomas and acute leukaemias preceeded non Hodgkin's lymphomas and <b>chronic</b> <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>leukaemias.</b> For men and women, the risk of haematopoietic malignancies was higher in urban areas than in rural areas.

All IgVH 3 - 72 B-CLLs revealed a homogeneous immunophenotypic profile, expressing all the markers associated with good prognosis, but not those representing the signature of bad prognosis B-CLLs, including ZAP- 70.

25|$|Rituximab is a {{chimeric}} monoclonal IgG1 antibody specific for CD20, {{developed from}} its parent antibody Ibritumomab. As with ibritumomab, rituximab targets CD20, making it effective in treating certain B-cell malignancies. These include aggressive and indolent lymphomas such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma and leukaemias such as B-cell <b>chronic</b> <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>leukaemia.</b> Although {{the function of}} CD20 is relatively unknown, CD20 may be a calcium channel involved in B-cell activation. The antibody's mode of action is primarily through the induction of ADCC and complement-mediated cytotoxicity. Other mechanisms include apoptosis and cellular growth arrest. Rituximab also increases the sensitivity of cancerous B-cells to chemotherapy.|$|E

5000|$|The human miR-16 {{precursor}} {{was discovered}} through detailed expression profile and Karyotype analyses of patients by Calin and colleagues. Karyotyping of chromosome structures from individuals with B-cell <b>chronic</b> <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>leukaemias</b> (B-CLL) {{found that more}} than half have alterations in the 13q14 region.

Comprehensive screenings of the region at the time did not provide consistent evidence of involvement from any of the known genes at the time. Using CD5+ B-lymphocytes, which is known to accumulate with B-CLL progression, the minimal region lost from 13q14 region was scrutinised for regulatory elements. Publicly available sequence databases were used to identify a gene cluster which encodes the homologue to the human miR15 and miR16 from the Caenorhabditis elegans.|$|R
40|$|The {{candidate}} oncogene bcl- 3 {{was discovered}} as a translocation into the immunoglobulin alpha-locus {{in some cases}} of B-cell <b>chronic</b> <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>leukaemias.</b> The protein Bcl- 3 contains seven so-called ankyrin repeats.

No biological function has yet been described for Bcl- 3, but it was noted recently that Bcl- 3 interferes with DNA-binding of the p 50 subunit of NF-kappa B in vitro. Here we demonstrate that Bcl- 3 can aid kappa B site-dependent transcription in vivo by counteracting the inhibitory effects of p 50 /NF-kappa B homodimers. Bcl- 3 may therefore aid activation of select NF-kappa B-regulated genes, including those of the human immunodeficiency virus. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|In the {{majority}} of 188 non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) investigated in this study, we found a simultaneous expression of the receptors for c 3 b and c 3 d (CR 1 & CR 2; cccorr = 0. 69, P less than 0. 0005). An analysis of the different histological entities of the Kiel classification revealed that this coexpression was most pronounced for germinal centre-derived (cccorr = 0. 63, P = 0. 0004) and immunocytic NHL (cccorr = 0. 86, P = 0. 0024), whereas in <b>chronic</b> <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>leukaemias</b> there tended {{to be a more}} heterogeneous pattern of complement receptor (CR) expression (cccorr = 0. 29, P greater than 0. 10).

40|$|The {{lysosomal}} protease Cathepsin D (CD) {{has been}} implicated in the homeostasis of lymphatic tissues. We investigated whether the level of CD expression influences the progression and the clinical outcome in Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphomas (NHLs). The expression of CD was assessed by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence in biopsies of Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphomas (DLBCL, 35 cases), Follicular Lymphomas (FL, 9 cases of grade I-II plus 14 cases of grade IIIB), <b>Chronic</b> <b>Lymphocytic</b> <b>Leukaemias</b> (CLL, 17 cases) and Peripheral T-cell Lymphomas (PTCL, 5 cases). CD staining showed a cytoplasmic punctate pattern compatible with its lysosomal localization. Based {{on the level of}} CD expression and the proportion of positive cells, lymphomas were classified as ‘low expressing’ ( 40 % CD-positive cells compared to that of patients bearing a NHL with < 20 % CD-positive cells (~ 70 % at 5 year). This correlation was statistically significant (log-rank test, p = 0. 01). In Cox multivariate analysis CD failed to be a prognosticator independent of pathologic stage, though the hazard ratio confirmed the association of low expression with a better survival probability. These data indicate that the presence of a high percentage of CD-positive tumor cells negatively reflects on the progression of NHLs...|$|R

40|$|In this {{retrospective}} study, {{we reviewed}} our list-mode recorded data of flow cytometry analayses of lymphocytes from patients with CD 5 + B leukaemia {{to evaluate the}} feasibility of cell size analysis as a diagnostic complementto {{the determination of the}} fluorescent cell surface markers. We estimatedthe cell size of CDS-positive B leukaemic cells by reference to the normalCDS-positive T cells. Typically, a B/T size ratio below 1 (small cell) wasencountered in true <b>chronic</b> <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>leukaemias</b> (CLL, Group 1), and higher values were frequently found in CLL with prolymphocytic features and leukaemic lymphomas (Group 2), or in chronic B leukaemias with atypical patterns of surface fluorescence or atypical clinical presentation (Group 3). The B/T size ratio was measured as 1. 07 +/- 0. 17 (means +/- SD) in Group 2, and was significantly different from Group 1 (0. 88 +/- 0. 06, P < 0. 001) and Group 3 (0. 94 +/- 0. 11, P < 0. 05). B cell size estimation is a useful by-product of fluorescence flow cytometry in the classification of CD 5 -positive chronic leukaemias. A high BIT ratio argues against the diagnosis of classical CLL. On the other side, because of wide overlaps, a low B/T ratio is anunspecific finding.

40|$|In {{a variety}} of adult and {{childhood}} leukaemia cell samples collected at different states of the disease, we analysed {{in a series of}} sequentially performed slot-blot or Northern-blot hybridisation experiments the expression of genes possibly involved in multiple drug resistance (MDR) (mdr 1 /P-glycoprotein, DNA topoisomerase II, glutathione-S-transferase pi), and the expression of the DNA topoisomerase I and histone 3. 1 genes. Occasionally, P-glycoprotein gene expression was additionally examined by indirect immunocytofluorescence using the monoclonal antibody C 219. No significant difference in mdr 1 /P-glycoprotein mRNA levels between primary and relapsed state acute <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>leukaemias</b> (ALL) was seen on average. Second or third relapses, however, showed a distinct tendency to an elevated expression of this multidrug transporter gene (up to 10 -fold) in part well beyond the value seen in the moderately cross-resistant T-lymphoblastoid CCRF-CEM subline CCRF VCR 100. Increased mdr 1 /P-glycoprotein mRNA levels were also found in relapsed state acute myelogenous leukaemias (AML), and in <b>chronic</b> <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>leukaemias</b> (CLL) treated with chlorambucil and/or prednisone for several years. Topoisomerase I and topoisomerase II mRNA levels were found to be very variable. Whereas in all but one case of CLL topoisomerase II mRNA was not detected by slot-blot hybridizations, strong topoisomerase I and topoisomerase II gene expression levels, frequently exceeding the levels monitored in the CCRF-CEM cell line, were seen in many cell samples of acute leukaemia. If topoisomerase II mRNA was undetectable, expression of topoisomerase I was clearly visible throughout. These observations might be valuable considering the possible treatment with specific topoisomerase I or topoisomerase II inhibitors. Significant positive correlations were found (i) for topoisomerase I and histone 3. 1 gene expression levels in general (P less than 0. 001), and (ii) in the CLL samples additionally for the expression levels of the mdr 1 gene, and the histone 3. 1, topoisomerase I, and glutathione-S-transferase pi genes, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Among 12 {{cases of}} chronic T {{lymphoproliferative}} disorders we observed, six patients showed {{an expansion of}} mononuclear cells with azurophilic granules usually referred to as large granular lymphocytes or LGL. Cells obtained from five patients with these abnormal LGL proliferations were studied with several surface markers including their reactivity with the HNK- 1 monoclonal antibody reported to be specific for LGL. Cells in {{four out of five}} cases were HNK- 1 positive. Whereas normal LGL have been reported to be unreactive with several T cell markers, three cases showed the co-existence of HNK- 1 and surface markers expressed by T cells. Two cases were characterized by the proliferation of OKT 8 cells. Cells from one patient were HNK- 1 positive but did not express T or monocytic antigens. These cells were apparently not completely mature since alpha-naphthyl acetate acid esterase activity was negative. Cells from the remaining case were HNK- 1 negative and positive for T and monocytic antigens. An increase of OKT- 10 cells was observed in only one patient. Our data indicate that proliferations of LGL represent a remarkable proportion of the rare cases of sheep erythrocyte rosetting <b>chronic</b> <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>leukaemias</b> or lymphomas. Besides the morphology of LGL, the rosetting ability and the negativity for peroxidase, cells from these cases showed a vast heterogeneity of other structural and functional markers, possibly reflecting different stages in the maturation of these cells.

40|$|Rosette {{techniques}} are presented for the enumeration and separation of both Ig+ T- and Ig- T+ human lymphocytes. In order to enumerate Ig+ cells, the direct immunocytoadhesion technique was employed using human erythrocytes (E) coated with purified anti-kappa or anti-lambda light chain antibodies. Specificity of these rosettes was shown with <b>chronic</b> <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>leukaemias</b> {{of either the}} kappa or lambda type. T+ cells were enumerated by a new indirect rosette technique in which the lymphocytes were initially treated with rabbit anti-human thymus cell antiserum followed by direct rosetting with human E coated with purified anti-rabbit light chain antibody. For normal individuals, 24 - 32 % Ig+ T- cells and 65 - 71 % Ig- T+ cells were found among the lymphocytes of peripheral blood as well as tonsils with these rosette methods. The Ficoll-Hypaque method was used to obtain purified Ig- T+ and Ig+ T- cells by removing rosetted Ig+ cells or T+ cells, respectively. The purity of the Ig- T+ cells was indicated by greater than 99 % indirect rosetting of cells sensitized with anti-human thymus cell antibody (Ab) and by less than 1 % direct rosetting with anti-kappa Ab-E+ anti-lambda Ab-E. The purity of the Ig+ T- cells obtained was indicated by 92 - 96 % direct rosetting with anti-kappa Ab-E+anti-lambda Ab-E and by less than 1 % indirect rosetting with anti-human thymus cell antibody. A small percentage of Ig- T- 'null' cells could not be identified by either reagent. Thus, essentially pure Ig- T+ and Ig+ T- cells were readily and efficiently isolated by 'negative selection' thereby lessening the possibility of functional changes that may develop by more extensive manipulation of lymphocytes...|$|R

Between 1974 and 1993, 1767 cases of NHL, 351 of CLL, 1678 of cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM), 4131 of {{squamous cell carcinoma}} (SCC) and 10575 of BCC were registered, and contributed {{to a total of}} 120103 person-years at risk. Following NHL, 36 cases of SCC were registered compared with 5. 1 expected, corresponding to a standardised incidence ratio (SIR) of 7. 0 (95 % confidence interval, CI, 4. 9 - 9. 7); 37 cases of BCC were observed compared with 10. 2 expected (SIR = 3. 6; 95 % CI 2. 6 - 5. 0). Following CLL, nine cases of SCC were observed compared with 1. 8 expected (SIR = 5. 0; 95 % CI 2. 3 - 9. 5) and nine cases of BCC were observed compared with 3. 3 expected (SIR = 2. 7; 95 % CI 1. 2 - 5. 2). After SCC, 23 cases at NHL were observed compared with 9. 0 expected (SIR = 2. 6; 95 % CI 1. 6 - 3. 8); after BCC, 43 cases of NHL were registered compared with 22. 5 expected (SIR = 1. 9; 95 % CI 1. 4 - 2. 6); and after CMM, four cases of NHL were observed compared with 2. 0 expected (SIR = 2. 0). No significant excess of CLL was recorded following skin cancer, but the absolute numbers were small and the SIR was above unity. The findings of this study, conducted in populations {{with a high level of}} ascertainment and registration of skin cancers, confirm an excess of skin cancers including BCC, following NHL and CLL, and an excess of NHL following skin cancers.

40|$|The {{recently}} described interleukin- 13 (IL- 13) {{has been}} shown to share many of the effects of IL- 4 on normal B cells, including growth-promoting activity and induction of CD 23. In this study, we compared the effects of IL- 13 and IL- 4 on B <b>chronic</b> <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>leukaemias</b> (B-CLL) cells. After anti-CD 40 activation, both IL- 13 and IL- 4 promoted the DNA synthesis of B-CLL cells and increased the recovery of viable cells. The time kinetics of the proliferative response of B-CLL cells to IL- 13 or IL- 4 were superimposable and showed the long-lasting effect of both cytokines. As on normal B cells, both IL- 4 and IL- 13 synergized with IL- 10 to enhance B-CLL DNA synthesis. Moreover, IL- 13, like IL- 4, was able to increase CD 23 expression on anti-CD 40 -activated leukaemic B cells. The CD 23 up-regulation and the DNA synthesis induced by IL- 13 on anti-CD 40 -activated B-CLL cells, were significantly reduced when B-CLL cells were cultured with anti-IL- 4 receptor monoclonal antibody, suggesting a common pathway for IL- 13 and IL- 4 signalling. However, after cross-linking of surface IgM, IL- 4 strongly inhibited the IL- 2 -induced DNA synthesis of B-CLL cells, whereas IL- 13 did not inhibit IL- 2 -driven proliferation of anti-IgM-activated B-CLL cells. Furthermore, while IL- 4 strongly up-regulated the expression of CD 23 on anti-IgM-activated leukaemic B cells, IL- 13 only marginally increased it. Finally, IL- 13, in contrast to IL- 4, did not prevent the entry of B-CLL cells into apoptosis. Thus IL- 13 and IL- 4 display comparable effects on anti-CD 40 -activated B-CLL cells, which are blocked by anti-IL- 4 receptor (IL- 4 R) monoclonal antibodies. However, IL- 13 -dependent effects are absent or inefficient in non-activated or anti-IgM-activated B-CLL cells. This suggests that such cells may lack functional IL- 13 receptors, though IL- 13 R and IL- 4 R on B-CLL cells share a common component...|$|R
40|$|The {{underlying}} immunopathogenic {{mechanism of}} CVID has been suspected to involve a chronic viral infection or an autoimmune condition. However, formal proof of viral infection is lacking. Measurement of MxA-protein in leucocyte lysates is a sensitive test {{for evaluating the}} activation of the host's interferon system. Both viral infections and autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) strongly induce MxA-protein in peripheral leucocytes. We therefore examined 15 patients with longlasting hypogammaglobulinaemia for MxA-protein induction in vivo: 13 patients suffered from CVID, one from hyper-IgM syndrome, and one patient had <b>chronic</b> B <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>leukaemia</b> associated with immunoglobulin deficiency and chronic papilloma virus infection (condylomata accuminata). Only the latter patient exhibited a strong MxA-protein expression; two CVID patients were borderline positive, and the remaining 12 patients including the hyper-IgM syndrome were MxA-protein-negative. There was no relationship between MxA expression and low CD 4 /CD 8 ratios or increased CD 8 /CD 57 + T cell counts, although both conditions are often observed in CVID {{as well as in}} chronic viral infections.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} our study was to {{evaluate}} the microsatellite instability (MSI) at selected loci with known involvement in the oncogenesis of <b>chronic</b> B-cell <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>leukaemia</b> (B-CLL). DNA from B cells (tumour cells) and from T cells (normal controls) of 27 samples of 26 patients with previously untreated B-CLL was extracted. Microsatellite instability in six microsatellite markers was tested using GeneScan Analysis Software. The rate of replication errors positive phenotype (RER+) was determined (MSI in more than 30 % of examined loci). RER+ was found in four out of 27 paients (14. 8 %). A larger proportion of patients with stage C B-CLL exhibited RER+ than those with stage A or B (P< 0. 05). A higher prevalence of RER+ was demonstrated in a subgroup of patients with additional malignancies (three out of eight patients) in comparison with patients with B-CLL alone (1 / 19) (P= 0. 031). In conclusion, our study demonstrated that MSI might have a more prominent role in pathogenesis of B-CLL than reported todate. This may result from a selection of microsatellite markers adjacent to chromosomal loci, which are involved in B-cell malignancies, and using GeneScan Analysis Software, which is most modern and precise method of microsatellite analysis...|$|R
