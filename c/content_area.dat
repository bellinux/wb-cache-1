Selected students enrolled in Science and Discovery High School earn college credits while earning credits towards high school graduation. Students receive instruction from college professors on the school's campus. Students receive extra help through tutoring during and after school using computer assisted programs such as Achieve 3000 (reading) and Apangea for mathematics. In September 2011, students staged a walkout in protest over several grievances, including class size and unqualified teachers. According to a Pennsylvania Department of Education report, the school has 16 Non‐Highly Qualified Teachers and 6 with emergency certification. In Pennsylvania, a Highly Qualified teacher is one who: (1) holds full certification, (2) has at least a bachelor's degree, (3) has completed a <b>content</b> <b>area</b> major, (4) has passed a <b>content</b> <b>area</b> test, and (5) has completed teacher education coursework In 2009–10, enrollment was 176 pupils. There were 7 teachers.|$|E

In the following sections, we discuss each of these areas in which variation may occur in relation to the models we have identified.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to obtain information on the content of education within cardiac rehabilitation programs, methods of administering education, what the barriers are to providing education and which professionals administer education. To reach this goal, a questionnaire was modified from a previous study and a pilot study was undertaken to establish reliability of the questionnaire. The questionnaire was then sent to a sample of 100 directors of cardiac rehabilitation programs belonging to The American Association of Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Rehabilitation (AACVPR). The questionnaire focused on 13 established areas of education within cardiac rehabilitation programs. Once the questionnaires were completed, the information was transferred to a table format based upon the 13 <b>content</b> <b>areas.</b> The following conclusions were drawn from the research and the data gathered: 11 of the 13 <b>content</b> <b>areas</b> are offered at least 84 % of the time, the major barriers for the 13 <b>content</b> <b>areas</b> were lack of time and lack of interest on the patient's behalf, the most frequent methods of education for all 13 <b>content</b> <b>areas</b> were individual education, print materials, and group education, and the primary educator overall for all 13 <b>content</b> <b>areas</b> was the nurse followed by the exercise physiologist and dietitian/nutritionist.

40|$|Graduation date: 1987 The {{primary focus}} {{of this study was}} to {{determine}} the competencies required to manage an athletic club. Also, the intention was to determine if differences existed in required competencies between managing varying sizes of clubs: namely, mini, maxi, and super; and to identify course <b>content</b> <b>areas</b> for purposes of developing sport management curricula. The instrument utilized in the research was developed from a study of the literature, validated by a Delphi panel, and field tested. The final questionnaire contained 33 competencies and 30 course <b>content</b> <b>areas,</b> with a six-point scale used to indicate each item's importance. The computed coefficients were +. 92 for the competencies and +. 91 for the course <b>content</b> <b>areas.</b> Questionnaires were completed by 264 randomly selected athletic club managers, representing the three groups. A one-way analysis of variance was employed for hypothesis testing. Tukey's w Method was used for group comparison of rejected hypotheses, and factor analysis was utilized for clustering competencies and course <b>content</b> <b>areas.</b> The following findings were noted: The two highest ranked competencies were Communication with clientele and Employee motivation. The two highest ranked course <b>content</b> <b>areas</b> were Marketing and Business management. Twenty-one of the 33 competency items and 28 of the 30 course <b>content</b> <b>areas</b> were retained. Tukey's w test revealed that the mean scores of the super clubs were higher than mini or maxi club scores in 13 instances. The R-mode of factor analysis identified clusters with factor loadings of ±. 47 or higher for curricula development. A six-factor solution was extracted for competencies: I Design Components; II Communication; III Sport Skills; IV Presentations; V Accounting, and VI Budgeting. A five-factor solution was extracted for course content areas: I Foundations; II Business Management; III Hotel/Restaurant Management; IV Accounting,; and V Use of Computers. Based on the findings of this study, it was concluded that there is little significant difference in managing various sizes of athletic clubs. Sport management curricula should be developed for athletic club managers using the identified competencies and course <b>content</b> <b>areas</b> of this study as a guide...|$|R
30|$|The {{number of}} <b>content</b> <b>areas</b> {{typically}} {{coincides with the}} number of preps for teachers. That is, with fewer <b>content</b> <b>areas</b> to teach, a specialist has fewer unique lessons to prepare for each day. On the continuum for the number of preps (Fig.  1), this is generally true, with the exception of models E and F; these models are shifted towards a greater number of preps, due to the number of grade levels for which these specialists prepare. Despite content specialization, these specialists may have almost as many preps as a self-contained teacher. Thus, {{there seems to be a}} distinct trade-off that occurs with these two models: specialists have an ability to focus on particular <b>content</b> <b>areas,</b> without a significant reduction to the number of preps.|$|R
