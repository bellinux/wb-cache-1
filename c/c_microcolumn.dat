40|$|A {{new method}} based on {{reversed}} phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), positive ion electrospray time-of-flight mass spectrometry (ESI-TOF/MS) {{has been developed}} for the characterization of insulin in commercial insulin injection. With reversed phase <b>C,</b> <b>microcolumn</b> (2. 1 min x 30 mm, 3. 5 mu m) and water and acetonitrile (66 : 34, V/V) containing 1 % HAc as mobile phase, insulin and other compounds could be separated rapidly within I min. The factors including flow rate, pH, fragmentor affecting the MS signal of insulin have been optimized. Under the optimum conditions, insulin could be ionized efficiently and only 0. 174 pmol sample was required to satisfiy the quantitative analysis of insulin. Meanwhile, MS peaks with + 3, + 4, + 5, + 6 and + 7 charges were formed in mass spectrum under the ESI positive scan mode. After deconvolution analysis, the exact mass of insulin in different samples could be obtained. Compared to the theoretical mass, the relative error of the mass could be down to 1. 72 x 10 (7) ...|$|E
30|$|Tryptic {{peptides}} {{from each}} sample were redissolved in 100  mmol/L triethylammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.5). Subsequently, for light labeling, 4  µL of formaldehyde-H 2 (4 % in water) {{was added to}} the solution (1 : 25 v/v) and vortexed for 1  min, followed by the addition of freshly prepared sodium cyanoborohydride to reach a final concentration of 25  mmol/L. The resultant mixture was incubated with shaking for 1  h at room temperature. A total of 16  µL of ammonia (1 %) was added to consume the excess formaldehyde. Finally, 8  µL of formic acid (5 %) was added to acidify the solution. For heavy labeling, 4  µL of formaldehyde-D 2 (4 % in D 2 O) was added. The light and heavy dimethyl-labeled peptides derived from equal amount of wild-type and HDAC 6 knockout mouse liver protein extracts were pooled and desalted using <b>C</b> 18 <b>microcolumns.</b> Forward and reverse labeling was performed separately for independent biological replicates.|$|R
