5000|$|Under {{the third}} direction, {{researchers}} propose to use text mining and sentiment analysis algorithms to extract information about investors’ mood from social networks, media platforms, blogs, newspaper articles, and other relevant sources of textual data (sometimes referred as news analytics). A thread of publications (Barber & Odean (2008), Dougal et al. (2012), and Ahern & Sosyura (2015)) report a significant influence of financial articles and sensational news on behavior of stock prices. It {{is also not}} surprising, that such popular sources of news as Wall Street Journal, New York Times or Financial Times have a profound influence on the market. The strength of the impact can vary between different columnists even inside a particular journal (Dougal et al. (2012)). Tetlock (2007) suggests a successful measure of investors’ mood by counting the amount of [...] "negative" [...] words in a popular Wall Street Journal column [...] "Abreast of the market". Zhang et al. (2011) and Bollen et al. (2011) report Twitter to be an extremely important source of sentiment data, which helps to predict stock prices and volatility. The usual way to analyze {{the influence of the}} data from micro-blogging platforms on behavior of stock prices is to construct special mood tracking indexes. The easiest way would be to count the number of [...] "positive" [...] and [...] "negative" [...] words in each relevant tweet and construct a <b>combined</b> <b>indicator</b> based on this data. Nasseri et al. (2014) reports the predictive power of StockTwits (Twitter-like platform specialized on exchanging trading-related opinions) data with respect to behavior of stock prices. An alternative, but more demanding, way is to engage human experts to annotate a large number of tweets with the expected stock moves, and then construct a machine learning model for prediction. The application of the event study methodology to Twitter mood shows significant correlation to cumulative abnormal returns (Sprenger et al. (2014), Ranco et al. (2015), Gabrovšek et al. (2017) [...] ). Karabulut (2013) reports Facebook to be a good source of information about investors’ mood. Overall, most popular social networks, finance-related media platforms, magazines, and journals can be a valuable source of sentiment data, summarized in Peterson (2016). However, important to notice that it is relatively more difficult to collect such type of data (in most cases a researcher needs a special software). In addition, analysis of such data can also require deep machine learning and data mining knowledge (Hotho et al. (2005)).|$|E

3000|$|The {{comparative}} analysis of ordinary naturalisation policies uses, {{in addition to}} the MIPEX Access to Nationality indicator, a <b>combined</b> <b>indicator</b> measuring both the law (CITLAW) and administrative procedure (CITIMP). This indicator (CITLAW_CITIMP) is based on new publically-available indicators within the EU Democracy Observatory on Citizenship ([URL] These indicators measure the situation as of 31 December 2011 based on a common typology, comprehensive qualitative database, and expert state reports (CITLAW) as well as questionnaires to national independent legal experts (CITIMP). 3 Both sets of indicators drew inspiration from the existing MIPEX indicators on Access to Nationality, but since they have been independently constructed, they can serve as validating measure (see e.g. Helbling, 2013 on the importance of validating citizenship and integration policy indicators). The two datasets include the same states as MIPEX as well as a half-a-dozen non-EU European states (Iceland, Macedonia, Montenegro, and Serbia). Both sets of indicators included many additional aspects of naturalisation not covered by MIPEX and coded applying a 0 -to- 1 coding scale. This report measures ordinary naturalisation policies through a simple average of the CITLAW <b>combined</b> <b>indicator</b> on the ordinary naturalisation law (ANATORD) and the overall indicator on ordinary naturalisation administrative procedures (CITIMP). The averaging of the law and the procedure is necessary to capture both the legal and administrative obstacles to ordinary naturalisation.

(ii) To compare this proxy with a mortality-based proxy for population relative needs. (iii) To evaluate the additional value of a proxy based {{on a combination of}} non-mortality and mortality based proxies. Design - Estimation of the relative odds of levels of self-assessed health by selected socioeconomic variables using population survey data. Application of the estimates to regional populations to calculate socioeconomic-based population ‘scores’. Comparison of the correlations of socioeconomic indicator (SEI) scores, standardized mortality rates (SMR) and <b>combined</b> <b>indicator</b> scores with regional populations’ self-assessed health levels. Setting - The province of Quebec, Canada. Coverage - The populations of the 15 health regions in Quebec. Main outcome measure: Performance of proxy indicators in explaining variations in self-assessed health levels among regions’ populations. Results - Variations in SEI scores among regions explain 37 % of the observed variation in self-assessed health, 4 % more than the level of variation explained by SMR scores. A weighted combination of both mortality and socio-economic based proxies explains 56 per cent of variation in self-assessed health. Conclusions - Justification of ‘deprivation weights’ in population-based resource allocation formulae should be based on empirical support concerning the performance of such weights as proxies for relative levels of need among populations. The SEI developed in this study provides a closer proxy to the self-assessed health of the populations under study than the SMR. The superior performance of the <b>combined</b> <b>indicator</b> suggests that the development of social deprivation indicators should be viewed as a complement to, as opposed to substitute for mortality-based measures in needs-based resource allocation exercises. population needs, mortality, deprivation...|$|E

Survey based indicators (ifo business climate, ZEW index of economic sentiment) and composite leading indicators (Handelsblatt, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Commerzbank) are considered.

In contrast to the single indicator approach, the <b>combined</b> <b>indicator</b> forecasts are able to beat the benchmark at each forecasting horizon.

Deviating from individualist {{measures of}} inequality {{such as the}} Gini coefficient, recent studies have found a statistical link between group-level inequalities and conflict onset. Yet, this connection remains controversial, not least because of the difficulties associated with conceptualizing and measuring group-level differences in development. In an effort to overcome weaknesses afflicting specific methods of measurement, we introduce a new composite indicator that exploits the strengths of three sources of data. The first step of our method combines geocoded data from the G-Econ project with night lights emissions data from satellites. In a second step, we bring together the combined spatial values with survey estimates in order to arrive at an improved measure of group-level inequality that is both more accurate and robust than {{any one of the}} component measures. We evaluate the effect of the <b>combined</b> <b>indicator</b> and its components on the onset of civil violence.

40|$|Drought {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} climate/weather-induced phenomena with severe impacts on different areas such as agriculture, energy production, society, forestry, and so on. From a meteorological point of view, drought can be induced and/or reinforced by a lack of precipitation and a reduced evapotranspiration due to hot temperatures. We present pan-European meteorological drought trends for the period 1950 - 2012 based on a multi-indicator approach. As input data, we used monthly precipitation and temperature from the E-OBS (v 10, spatial resolution: 0. 5 °x 0. 5 °) gridded dataset of the European Climate Assessment and Dataset (ECA&D) of the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI). Precipitation, temperature, and the derived potential evapotranspiration (PET) data have been used to compute the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), and the Reconnaissance Drought Index (RDI). SPI, SPEI, and RDI, calculated at a monthly scale and for two accumulation periods (3 and 12 months), have been merged into a <b>combined</b> <b>indicator</b> used as the basis for drought frequency, duration, and severity. Such quantities have been computed at regional and country level, together with areas “prone” to drought conditions.
