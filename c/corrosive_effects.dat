25|$|Stirling engine designs require heat {{exchangers}} for heat input and for heat output, and these must contain {{the pressure of}} the working fluid, where the pressure is proportional to the engine power output. In addition, the expansion-side heat exchanger is often at very high temperature, so the materials must resist the <b>corrosive</b> <b>effects</b> of the heat source, and have low creep. Typically these material requirements substantially increase the cost of the engine. The materials and assembly costs for a high temperature heat exchanger typically accounts for 40% of the total engine cost.|$|E
25|$|Like most medieval buildings, {{the windows}} at Chartres {{suffered}} badly from the <b>corrosive</b> <b>effects</b> of atmospheric acids during the Industrial Revolution and subsequently. The majority of windows were cleaned and restored by the famous local workshop Atelier Lorin {{at the end}} of the 19th century but they continued to deteriorate. During World War II most of the stained glass was removed from the cathedral and stored in the surrounding countryside to protect it from damage. At the close of the war the windows were taken out of storage and reinstalled. Since then an ongoing programme of conservation has been underway and isothermal secondary glazing was gradually installed on the exterior to protect the windows from further damage.|$|E

2500|$|Solder ( [...] , [...] or in North America [...] ) is a {{fusible metal}} alloy {{used to create}} a {{permanent}} bond between metal workpieces. The word solder comes from the Middle English word soudur, via Old French solduree and soulder, from the Latin solidare, meaning [...] "to make solid". In fact, solder must be melted in order to adhere to and connect the pieces together, so a suitable alloy for use as solder will have a lower melting point than the pieces it is intended to join. Whenever possible, the solder should also be resistant to oxidative and <b>corrosive</b> <b>effects</b> that would degrade the joint over time. Solder that is intended for use in making electrical connections between electronic components also usually has favorable electrical characteristics.|$|E

There are many critiques of ecotourism as exploitative and a highly consumer-centered and contradictory activity including detrimental effects on the environment from the amount of jet engine fuel burned on the flight there and back, the additional amenities that must be built to cater to Western expectations, the pollution and garbage associated with a Western lifestyle, the disturbance of flora and fauna and a bevy of other concerns expressed by environmentalist voices.|$|E
2500|$|Josephine Seaton, a keen {{observer}} {{and the daughter}} [...] of {{the publisher of the}} National Intelligencer,William Seaton, states the navy yard strikers {{played a significant role in}} the Snow riot: [...] "Snow will certainly be torn to pieces by the mechanics if he be caught, and they are in full pursuit of him. Unfortunately, several hundred mechanics of the navy yard are out of employment, who, aided and abetted by their sympathizers, create the mob, — the first I have ever seen, not recollecting those of Sheffield, and it is truly alarming." [...] Seaton was one of the few whites to record the strike, a strike which revealed the <b>corrosive</b> <b>effects</b> of racism on the navy yard workforce as white workers sought to blame their own precarious economic situation on free and enslaved African Americans. The riot was widely publicized in many newspapers and alarmed the white community. As their economic situation deteriorated and stung by public criticism of their actions the navy yard mechanics and laborers sought to end the strike. The two sides came together in an agreement that both Hull and the workers accepted through the offices of an outside mediator, Dr. Alexander A. McWilliams, who had a medical practice adjacent to the navy yard and was known to both the workforce and Hull as a result the Department of the Navy encouraged mediation and the navy yard labor strike ended on 15 August 1835 when the mechanics returned to work.|$|E
2500|$|On 15 August 1835 {{the navy}} yard strikers {{were allowed to}} return to work. The strike had ended through {{mediation}} with both Commodore Hull and the strikers acknowledging the two week labor strike as simply a [...] " [...] misunderstanding". While publicly accepting mediation neither party was happy with the result. The Commodore only reluctantly accepted the Secretary of the Navy's recommendation to allow the strikers to return. [...] The strikers too were not happy for they had failed to achieve any of their goals. Commodore Isaac Hull left the navy yard in September 1835, never to return but the regulation regarding the workers lunch restrictions remained in place and the hours of work continued the same until 1840. For navy yard workers, the strike of 1835 revealed the weakness and tenuous nature of their bargaining situation. As day labor in a protracted dispute, absent effective organization and financial resources they inevitably suffered. [...] Most of all the strike revealed the <b>corrosive</b> <b>effects</b> of racism on the workforce as white workers sought to blame their own precarious economic situation on free and enslaved African Americans. [...] Further, the strike left as part of its legacy a deep and abiding racial mistrust, which would linger. For next century, the history of the Washington Navy Yard strike of 1835 and Snow race riot remained an embarrassment to be glossed over and disassociated from the District of Columbia and Washington Navy Yard’s official histories. Historical understanding of the strike has improved with the transcription and publication of important documents such as the correspondence of Issac Hull and the Diary of Michael Shiner. Prior to the 2007 publication of the complete Michael Shiner diary, one historian for example actually saw the strike as an example of early inter-racial worker solidarity. “In a number of instances, however, Negro and white workers [...] worked and went on strike together. Thus white carpenters and caulkers and Negro caulkers employed in the navy yard in Washington joined in a strike in July 1835.” [...] Alternately another historian has argued that the 1835 participants in the riot [...] "were mostly mechanics and [...] "mostly Irish". [...] More recent scholarship on Michael Shiner and Isaac Hull has focused on the participation of the 1835 navy yard strikers in the riot as noted in the letters of Josephine Seaton and correspondence of Isaac Hull [...]|$|E
