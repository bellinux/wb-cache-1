40|$|In The Third Life of Grange Coneland, Alice Walker {{distinctly}} {{stretches out}} the customs, natural features, and folk {{heritage of the}} South in which she portrays how black women strive toward self-realization in a hostile environment (Perkins 2037). Most of the time, Walker?s black women in the novel, Margaret, Mem, and Josie are perpetually faced, both, to physical and emotional battle in their own home. They abide in an unfavorable world where slavery, and violence as well as brutality really reach the peak. Nevertheless, the black female characters here are manifested as strong heroines who possess solid inner power so that they arc capable to front such a pathetic condition. An outstanding black critics, Arthur P. Davis identifies that inner power as their survival technique, a technique that is always applied by all minority groups. He asserts that survival technique always exists in black literature from the eighteenth century down to the present (Davis 673). This thesis would analyze how Margaret, Mem, and Josie cope with their own men?s brutality and why they carry on such {{the same way as}} well as analyze the difference of their style in their same way in coping with their men?s oppression. Therefore, this thesis employs Davis? survival technique as the principal theory to analyze Margaret, Mem, and Josie?s deportment in facing their inimical neighborhood. Furthermore, literary theory of <b>conflict,</b> <b>of</b> <b>characterization,</b> and of setting would be the other devices used in the analysis. Theories of psychology would also be included in this thesis since it closely related to the black women?s characters, a weighty element which constitutes the influential factor in providing a deep and relevant analysis at the end, it is discovered that the female characters, Margaret, Mem, and Josie are those who everlastingly accept all their severe anguish caused by their own men?s brutality. The dissimilarity of human characters and of unpleasant experiences they have, understandably, creates variant reactions while accepting their men?s bad conduct...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. From the {{software}} engineering perspective, {{the notion of}} Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) has been receiving significant attention within {{the software}} design and development community. This attention {{has led to the}} proliferation <b>of</b> <b>conflicting</b> <b>characterizations</b> <b>of</b> SOA, resulting in an ambiguous understanding of SOA entities and relationships among them. To achieve a common understanding, OASIS and SeCSE propose reference models that introduce a comprehensive ontology for modeling software services around the well known service-oriented interaction pattern. However OASIS and SeCSE models abstract the actual interaction pattern runtime support, which is generally provided by a Service Oriented Middleware (SOM). In this paper we propose a reference model for architecting SOM solutions over next generation networking environment and evaluate it by designing a conforming lower-level model for the SOM developed for the PLASTIC project. ...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, I {{focus on}} {{analyzing}} {{the causes and}} the effects of the main character's (Christopher Chubb) personality change. Based on Chubb's behaviors and actions, I realize Chubb is changing into a person with narcissistic personality. I am interested in revealing the causes, and effects of Chubb's narcissistic personality. In this analysis, I decide to use literary theory and narcissism concept. Literary theories that I use are the theory <b>of</b> <b>characterization</b> and the theory <b>of</b> <b>conflict.</b> Theory <b>of</b> <b>characterization</b> and theory <b>of</b> <b>conflict</b> help me to know Christopher Chubb's past and present life and also some people's opinions on his narcissistic personality. Moreover, I also use narcissism concept to understand the symptoms, the causes {{and the effects of}} Chubb's narcissistic personality. By using these theories and concept I am able to analyze deeper about the personality change of Christopher Chubb. I find out that the causes of narcissistic personality that happened in Chubb's life are the parental rejection, and his feeling of failure. Moreover, this concept also helps me to recognize the effects of Chubb's narcissistic personality. The effect caused by Chubb's narcissistic personality is his disturbed interpersonal relationship. Finally, Christopher Chubb does not have a happy life but his life is full of fake and miserable because he always tries to reach his unrealistic expectation. Tragically, until the end of his life, he still cannot make his dream come true and his ego also makes other people suffer. I conclude Chubb, as a human being, has a choice in his life to be a good man or bad man. It depends on the thinking of him. He can be a good person by always having positive thinking and giving thanks for all he has and become happy with that...|$|R

40|$|This study {{discusses}} one of Louisa MayAlcott?s novels entitled A Long Fatal Love Chase. This discussion {{talks about}} {{the failure of the}} main female character?s efforts to escape from her miserable life. It is focusing on Rosamond?s efforts and failure to escape from her miserable life. I am interested to talk about her efforts and failure in order to find out the ways Rosamond uses to escape from her miserable life and also the reasons that cause her failure to get out from it. In analyzing the novel, I use the literary theories such as the theory <b>of</b> <b>characterization</b> and the theory <b>of</b> <b>conflict.</b> The theory <b>of</b> <b>characterization</b> is useful to analyze Rosamond as the main female character in the novel while the theory <b>of</b> <b>conflict</b> is useful to analyze the inner and the outer conflicts that she faces. Rosamond?s efforts and failure appear because Rosamond wants to get out from her miserable life caused by her grandfather?s lack of affection and Phillip Tempest?s obsessive love. She does not easily give up to her fate. She does a lot of efforts to make her miserable life end. Besides, she also experiences inner conflicts and outer conflicts during her efforts to escape from her miserable life. She experiences her inner conflict when she has to choose between Phillip and De Luneville, while her outer conflict is when she consistently refuses Phillip?s offer to be his wife. Unfortunately, all her efforts are useless. She experiences failure because she is incapable to escape from Phillip?s obsessive love, but she gets her freedom through her death...|$|R
5|$|In {{the late}} 20th century, Griffiths {{focused on the}} {{inconsistent}} portrayal of Horus and Set as brothers and as uncle and nephew. He argued that, {{in the early stages}} of Egyptian mythology, the struggle between Horus and Set as siblings and equals was originally separate from the murder of Osiris. The two stories were joined into the single Osiris myth sometime before the writing of the Pyramid Texts. With this merging, the genealogy of the deities involved and the <b>characterization</b> <b>of</b> the Horus–Set <b>conflict</b> were altered so that Horus is the son and heir avenging Osiris's death. Traces of the independent traditions remained in the <b>conflicting</b> <b>characterizations</b> <b>of</b> the combatants' relationship and in texts unrelated to the Osiris myth, which make Horus the son of the goddess Nut or the goddess Hathor rather than of Isis and Osiris. Griffiths therefore rejected the possibility that Osiris's murder was rooted in historical events. This hypothesis has been accepted by more recent scholars such as Jan Assmann and George Hart.|$|R

40|$|Despite its ubiquity in {{debate over}} the justifiability of civil disobedience and {{conscientious}} objection, “conscience” remains an opaque concept. The attempt to define and employ it properly is not a purely academic exercise. The political language and behavior we associate with conscientiousness are empty {{to the point of}} being vulnerable to co-option by manifestly non-conscientious, violent, and reactionary movements. 	My argument is that the ease with which political actors adopt the language of conscience is due, not poor public understanding of the concept of “conscience,” but to the concept itself. In modern philosophical interpretations of conscience, such as that of Martin Luther and John Locke, the conscience is reified as a moral faculty or interior conversation of the individual. This is a departure from classical views of conscientiousness (for instance, Augustine’s), which emphasize the shared, fragile and habitual nature of conscience. Once “conscientiousness” is reified as “conscience,” it becomes difficult to characterize, except in negative terms, as an inner space free from tradition and force. My thesis is that the co-option of the language of conscience stems, in part, from the empty and <b>conflicted</b> <b>characterization</b> <b>of</b> philosophy in modern contract theory. 	One example <b>of</b> this <b>conflicted</b> <b>characterization</b> <b>of</b> conscience is the abortive project of distinguishing civil disobedience and conscientious objection. In law, politics, and philosophy, it is difficult to offer sound reasons for distinguishing these latter categories, despite frequent attempts to do so. The attempt fails on conceptual as well as practical grounds. I criticize two prominent treatments of civil disobedience and conscientious objection in evidence of this claim (John Rawls and Michael Walzer). 	When it comes to the language of conscience, modern American culture has committed the philosophic fallacy (John Dewey). We have substituted the clear divisions and images created by conscientious movements for the process that created them. I argue that “conscience” is best seen as a quality of healthy debate between adversaries—debates over problems so fundamental that they will be carried on in extra-legal and even illegal spheres. Conscience is a not a language that just any political actor can speak at will. It is a series of decisions that indicate to a public that we are not political enemies but political adversaries, seeking a political future together (Chantal Mouffe) ...|$|R

40|$|Amorphous {{silicon oxycarbide}} (SiOC) {{is of great}} {{technological}} interest. However, its atomic-level structure is not well understood. Using density functional theory calculations, we show that the clustering tendency of C atoms in SiOC is extremely sensitive to hydrogen (H) : without H, the C-C interaction is attractive, leading to enrichment of aggregated SiC[subscript 4] tetrahedral units; with hydrogen, the C-C interaction is repulsive, leading to enrichment of randomly distributed SiCO[subscript 3] tetrahedral units. Our results suggest that <b>conflicting</b> experimental <b>characterizations</b> <b>of</b> C distributions {{may be due to}} differing amounts of H present in the samples investigated.

In this article, I analyze the {{progress}} Chilean women have made since {{the transition to democracy}} by focusing on what is inarguably a core component of progress on women's rights: the passage of legislation that promotes the goals of the feminist movement. While the passage of legislation is, of course, not the only test of a society's openness to women's rights, it is undeniably a critical component of any larger program of political, cultural and economic transformation of women's status. The feminist movement that arose under the dictatorship (1973 - 1989) articulated a well-developed agenda for political change, and the political parties vying for representation in the new government promised to respond to these concerns. To what extent did democracy allow feminists to achieve political change and implement the demands they had developed over the previous sixteen years?
