40|$|Plate {{tectonics}} is the kinematic {{theory that}} describes the large-scale motions and events of the outermost shell of the solid Earth {{in terms of the}} relative motions and interactions of large, rigid, interlocking fragments of lithosphere called tectonic plates. Plates form and disappear incrementally over time as a result of tectonic processes. There are currently about a dozen major plates {{on the surface of the}} Earth, and many minor ones. The present-day configuration of tectonic plates is illustrated in Figure 7. 1. As the <b>interlocking</b> <b>plates</b> move relative to each other, they interact at plate boundaries, where adjacent plates collide, diverge, or slide past each other. The interactions of plates result in a variety of observable surface phenomena, including the occurrence of earthquakes and the formation of large-scale surface features such as mountains, sedimentary basins, volcanoes, island arcs, and deep ocean trenches. In tum, the appearance of these phenomena and surface features indicates the location of plate boundaries.

Some automatic locking differential designs ensure that engine power is always transmitted to both wheels, regardless of traction conditions, and will [...] "unlock" [...] only when one wheel is required to spin faster than the other during cornering. These would be more correctly termed [...] "automatic unlocking" [...] differentials, because their at-rest position is locked. They will never allow either wheel to spin slower than the differential carrier or axle as a whole, but will permit a wheel to be over-driven faster than the carrier speed.

Others, sometimes referred to as [...] "lunchbox lockers," [...] employ the stock differential carrier and replace only the internal spider gears and shafts with <b>interlocking</b> <b>plates.</b> Both types of automatic lockers will allow for a degree of differential wheel speed while turning corners in conditions of equal traction, but will otherwise lock both axle shafts together when traction conditions demand it.|$|R

In comparison, the results shows that the interlocking joint panels with CCwA are passing the entire requirement in specified MS and BS. This is showing that interlocking panels with CCwA can be an alternative in replacing the natural aggregates. The study shows that the interlocking panels using CCwA under three loading points are good enough to be used in industry. This will promote application of interlocking panel in construction and give out a solution on the wastage of construction material and shortage in natural aggregate...|$|R

By using British Pendulum Tester, skid resistance of sidewalk was measured in a wet after snow-melt, sludgy, and snowy conditions. METHODS: The skid resistance was measured on surfaces including <b>Concrete</b> <b>Interlocking</b> Block Paving, Colour Asphalt Pavement, Granite Block Paving, Manhole, and Tactile Paving for Visually Impaired. Five trials at each measurement were made, and the average and standard deviation were derived. RESULTS: The skid resistance measured in wet after snow-melt, sludgy, and snowy conditions for the various surface types are summarized and compared. Reduction rates of skid resistance of sludgy and snowy against wet after snow-melt are also analysed. The skid resistance variation between measurement points which mimic pedestrian route in study site are analysed to check out the consistency of the skid resistance along the sidewalk. CONCLUSIONS: The study concluded that the skid resistance of sidewalk surfaces varied depending on the surface types and weather conditions. Secondly, reduction rates of skid resistance according to weather changes are varied depending on the surface types, Thirdly, consistency of skid resistance along the pedestrian route is hardly acquired in the study site at least.

40|$|This article {{compares the}} {{performance}} of three permeable pavement materials: porous asphalt, pervious <b>concrete</b> and permeable <b>interlocking</b> <b>concrete</b> pavers that have been implemented on low volume residential road applications via a thorough literature review and an analysis of four case studies in the United States. The research was undertaken due to the common belief that permeable road surfaces are deficient in structural integrity due to their porous nature and therefore limiting their use to footpaths, driveways and car parks. Their reduced structural integrity is said to cause a reduction in their design life when compared to traditional surface options. Recent advancements in technology and mix designs have produced successful applications of all three pavement types to low volume road applications therefore dispelling these common beliefs. This study is important as urbanisation is creating more runoff which needs to be sustainably handled and the current infrastructure and land space is already strained. Although the case studies analysed {{in this study are}} in their infancies, all three pavement types are wearing as designed. Porous asphalt, pervious <b>concrete</b> and permeable <b>interlocking</b> <b>concrete</b> pavers have each been successfully implemented on various projects and the current results show that each are feasible for low volume residential road applications. However it is difficult to nominate which pavement type is best for low volume residential road applications as each application and intended use will be unique. Early indications show that pervious concrete may be the most well rounded surface type in terms of costs, maintenance factors, availability of materials, water infiltration effectiveness and desired secondary benefits. This study also discovered that there are no common practices in terms of maintenance techniques and frequencies and recommends this as a further research area. ...|$|R

Purpose. To evaluate the functional and radiological results of treating unstable distal radius fractures with the volar locking plate. Patients and methods. A retrospective review was conducted of patients from one institution using the volar locking plate to treat intra-articular and extra-articular distal radius fractures. Unstable distal radius fractures in 15 patients, comprising 3 men and 12 women {{with a mean age of}} 64. 4 years (34 – 76 years), were treated with a volar locking compression plate (Acu-Loc distal radius plate system; Acumed, Oregon, USA) and followed up for a minimum of 1 year. Fractures were classified using the AO classification. Radiographic parameters of preoperative, postoperative, and final follow-up radiographs were compared. The time to initiation of active range of motion was determined. Final follow-up range of motion and complications were reported. Results. At final functional assessment, the scores of 5 patients were excellent, 7 patients good, and 3 patients fair according to Cooney’s Clinical Scoring Chart. No non-union or infection occurred. Rupture of the flexor pollicis longus tendon occurred in 1 patient. Conclusion.
