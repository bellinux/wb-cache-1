5|$|Calhoun's {{publication}} {{of letters from}} the Seminole in the Telegraph <b>caused</b> <b>his</b> relationship with Jackson to deteriorate further, thus contributing to the Nullification Crisis. Jackson and Calhoun began an angry correspondence that lasted until Jackson stopped it in July.|$|E
5|$|On 20 May 1789, Prittwitz was {{appointed}} {{general of the}} cavalry by the new Prussian king Frederick William II. His penchant for gambling <b>caused</b> <b>his</b> dismissal as inspector in 1790. He died on the 4 June 1793 in Berlin, and his body was removed to his estate in Quilitz for burial.|$|E
5|$|The {{pastoral}} {{profession of}} Zimmerman's father <b>caused</b> <b>his</b> family {{to relocate to}} a number of towns throughout Maryland, Virginia, and West Virginia. Zimmerman spent the majority of his youth in Woodstock and Salem, Virginia, before his father transferred to Romney, West Virginia, to preside over the Moorefield district of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South.|$|E

5|$|After {{the murder}} of Archbishop Thomas Becket at the cathedral in 1170, Canterbury {{became one of the}} most notable towns in Europe, as pilgrims from all parts of Christendom came to visit his shrine. This pilgrimage {{provided}} the framework for Geoffrey Chaucer's 14th-century collection of stories, The Canterbury Tales. Canterbury Castle was captured by the French Prince Louis during his 1215 invasion of England, before the death of John <b>caused</b> <b>his</b> English supporters to desert his cause and support the young Henry III.|$|E
5|$|Balzac {{borrowed}} {{money from his}} family and friends, and tried to build a printing business, then a typefounder enterprise. His inexperience and lack of capital <b>caused</b> <b>his</b> ruin in these trades. He gave the businesses to a friend (who made them successful) but carried the debts for many years. As of April 1828 Balzac owed 50,000 francs to his mother.|$|E
5|$|Eckfeldt {{served a}} quarter century as chief coiner, during which time the Philadelphia Mint moved to new premises. As he set aside unusual coins brought in as bullion, he started the Mint's coin cabinet, which evolved into the National Numismatic Collection. Even after his 1839 retirement, Eckfeldt {{continued}} {{to perform the duties}} of chief coiner; his death in 1852 <b>caused</b> <b>his</b> replacement, Franklin Peale, to seek an assistant.|$|E

5|$|Eventually {{a little}} after noon Wilton arrived at the inquest, and gave a full account of the incident. Lord Granville (half-brother of the Marquess of Stafford) told the jury that Huskisson had been {{suffering}} from numbness in his leg from a previous operation, and that this may have <b>caused</b> <b>his</b> apparent problems with movement. No witnesses recollected seeing any signal flags raised {{from any of the}} locomotives involved, including Rocket, although a system of warning flags {{was supposed to have been}} in place.|$|E
5|$|Field's {{failure to}} secure {{independence}} concurrently {{with the end}} of the Federation <b>caused</b> <b>his</b> Cabinet's support for him to waver during late 1963 and early 1964. The RF caucus in January 1964 revealed widespread dissatisfaction with him on the grounds that the British seemed to be outwitting him. The Prime Minister was put under immense pressure to win the colony's independence. Field travelled to England later that month to press Douglas-Home and Sandys for independence, and raised the possibility of UDI on a few occasions, but returned empty-handed on 2 February.|$|E
5|$|Gaudí's {{personal}} appearance—Nordic features, {{blond hair}} and blue eyes—changed radically {{over the course of}} time. As a young man, he dressed like a dandy in costly suits, sporting well-groomed hair and beard, indulging gourmet taste, making frequent visits to the theatre and the opera and visiting his project sites in a horse carriage. The older Gaudí ate frugally, dressed in old, worn-out suits, and neglected his appearance to the extent that sometimes he was taken for a beggar, such as after the accident that <b>caused</b> <b>his</b> death.|$|E

5|$|He started 2017 {{season with}} his fourth win in All England Open. He nearly {{missed out on}} the tournament after tearing the medial {{collateral}} ligament during a training session at the new Academy Badminton Malaysia (ABM), this <b>caused</b> <b>his</b> feud with technical director Morten Frost, as Frost was not receptive to his complaint, asking for the slippery mats to be replaced. Lee lost to Lin Dan for two consecutive tournaments, {{the first in the}} final of Malaysia Open, and the second in semifinals of Badminton Asia Championships.|$|E
5|$|His {{marriage}} with Jobst soon collapsed and they divorced. He married twice thereafter and his third wife, Helga Schröck (whom he married in May 1959), {{gave birth to}} a son, Hermann-Ulrich, in 1959, and a daughter, Birgit, in 1961. In 1965, Graf was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, a condition that seemed to affect many former high-altitude flyers and which <b>caused</b> <b>his</b> health to slowly deteriorate. Graf died in his hometown of Engen on 4 November 1988.|$|E
5|$|In 1913, {{he entered}} the Royal Military College, Duntroon in Canberra. Of 33 members of his class, in which Vasey {{graduated}} tenth, nine died in the Great War. Six later became generals: Leslie Beavis, Frank Horton Berryman, William Bridgeford, John Austin Chapman, Edward James Milford and George Vasey. The war <b>caused</b> <b>his</b> class to be graduated early, in June 1915.|$|E

5|$|Olaf {{knows that}} Kjartan, who was {{involved}} in a love triangle with Bolli and Bolli's wife Gudrun Osvifrsdottir, <b>caused</b> <b>his</b> own downfall by acting aggressively. In Icelandic terms, Kjartan had surpassed the acceptable limits of immoderation. Whereas Olaf wants to maintain the solidarity of the larger family, keeping workable relations with his siblings and their children, Thorgerd's concerns are different. She focuses more narrowly on the honour of her nuclear family.|$|E
5|$|On 1 September 1863, {{twelve days}} after his sixteenth birthday, Prus {{took part in a}} battle against Russian forces at a village called Białka, four {{kilometers}} south of Siedlce. He suffered contusions to the neck and gunpowder injuries to his eyes, and was captured unconscious on the battlefield and taken to hospital in Siedlce. This experience may have <b>caused</b> <b>his</b> subsequent lifelong agoraphobia.|$|E
5|$|On 6 January 1966, Nell {{was driving}} the family car with Harry as a passenger; {{they were going to}} the south coast of Queensland for a holiday. A tyre blew out and the car rolled on the Leichhardt Highway near Condamine. Murray was taken to Miles District Hospital with broken ribs. He had {{suffered}} heart trouble for some time, and the shock of the accident is believed to have <b>caused</b> <b>his</b> death the following day. Murray was interred at Mount Thompson Crematorium with full military honours after a funeral service at St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church, Brisbane.|$|E

5|$|On June 24, Jake Peavy {{surrendered}} three earned runs in five innings, which <b>caused</b> <b>his</b> ERA to {{rise from}} 1.98 to 2.14. This gave Young, who had a 2.08 ERA, the National League-leading average for one day. The next day, Brad Penny allowed only one earned run over eight innings {{to take the lead}} with a 2.04 ERA.|$|E
5|$|Taraborrelli {{stated that}} Jackson was {{diagnosed}} with lupus, that the vitiligo partially lightened his skin, and the lupus was in remission, and both illnesses made him sensitive to sunlight, which could have <b>caused</b> <b>his</b> lupus condition to recur. Jackson's autopsy did not confirm or refute the claim that he had lupus, but it did confirm that he had vitiligo. His skin {{was found to have}} reduced (though not absent) melanocytes, the cells active in skin pigmentation.|$|E
