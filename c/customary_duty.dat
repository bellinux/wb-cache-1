Having {{learned from his}} previous campaign, Combs now attacked Chandler for allegedly requiring state employees to donate 2% of their salaries to his campaign. According to Combs, Chandler had deposited the money in a Cuban bank, but the money was lost when Fidel Castro overthrew {{the government in the}} Cuban Revolution. Ultimately, Combs prevailed in the primary by a vote of 292,462 to 259,461. Republicans nominated John M. Robsion, Jr. to oppose Combs, and when Democratic President Harry S.

Instead, in a letter to Truman, Chandler launched a blistering attack on his party's nominees, calling Combs a liar and alleging that his running mate, Wilson W. Wyatt, who had previously served in Truman's administration, had actually tried to undermine Truman by helping found Americans for Democratic Action. Combs ultimately won the general election by a wide margin.|$|E

The answers were satisfactory in general, though {{one or two of}} the vessels made such replies as induced the commander-in-chief to resort to a still more direct mode of ascertaining the real condition of his fleet. In order to effect this important object, Sir Gervaise waited two hours longer, for the double purpose of letting all the messes get through with their dinners, and to permit the wind to abate and the sea to fall, as both were now fast doing.

6000|$|The poet finds {{and makes}} his mask in disappointment, the hero in defeat. The desire that is {{satisfied}} {{is not a great}} desire, nor has the shoulder used all its might that an unbreakable gate has never strained. The saint alone is not deceived, neither thrusting with his shoulder nor holding out unsatisfied hands. He would climb without wandering to the antithetical self of the world, the Indian narrowing his thought in meditation or driving it away in contemplation, the Christian copying Christ, the antithetical self of the classic world. For a hero loves the world till it breaks him, and the poet till it has broken faith; but while the world was yet debonair, the saint has turned away, and because he renounced Experience itself, he will wear his mask as he finds it. The poet or the hero, no matter upon what bark they found their mask, so teeming their fancy, somewhat change its lineaments, but the saint, whose life is but a round of <b>customary</b> <b>duty,</b> needs nothing the whole world does not need, and day by day he scourges in his body the Roman and Christian conquerors: Alexander and Caesar are famished in his cell. His nativity is neither in disappointment nor in defeat, but in a temptation like that of Christ in the Wilderness, a contemplation in a single instant perpetually renewed of the Kingdom of the World; all, because all renounced, continually present showing their empty thrones. Edwin Ellis, remembering that Christ also measured the sacrifice, imagined himself in a fine poem as meeting at Golgotha the phantom of [...] "Christ the Less," [...] the Christ who might have lived a prosperous life without the knowledge of sin, and who now wanders [...] "companionless a weary spectre day and night." ...|$|E

50|$|A notable {{example of}} ISDS, {{which has been}} in {{existence}} for two decades now, is Chapter 11 of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). NAFTA Chapter 11 allows investors of one NAFTA party (Canada, United States or Mexico) to bring claims directly against the government of another NAFTA party before an international arbitral tribunal. Because NAFTA Article 1121 waives the local remedies rule, investors are not required to exhaust local remedies before filing Chapter 11 claims. While this fact has been amply criticized in public, proponents of ISDS tend to point out that speedy dispute resolution through ISDS is critical in modern economic environments and would be defeated by adding several instances of local remedies. On the other hand, there is no other situation in international law where a private party can sue a state without showing that the state's domestic courts are not independent or reliable. The removal of the <b>customary</b> <b>duty</b> to exhaust local remedies, where they are reasonably available, is claimed to be a factor in the explosion of investment treaty claims since the late 1990s, although a more obvious explanation is the explosion in the number of bilateral free trade agreements since the breakdown of the multilateral WTO Doha round in the mid 2000s.|$|E
40|$|Purpose of {{the essay}} is to inquire into the legal issues {{concerning}} the ownership of the war booty during the Roman Republic. The article aims to distinguish the booty (praeda) from the single objects that each civilian-soldier took directly away from the enemy (res hostium). Just {{with the beginning of}} the Republic probably the plebs succeed in imposing to the patricians not to keep what each soldier stripped from the enemies, imposing on the contrary a <b>customary</b> <b>duty</b> to deposit each object of the enemies {{in the middle of the}} camp. Thus the concept of preaeda, previously referred only to the land booty, were now extended to the movable objects. This praeda were neither property of the State nor common property of the soldiers.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{evolution}} of the principle of International environmental law prohibiting the use of the territory of a State for activities which may damage the territory of another State. This principle started to develop in relation to strictly trans-boundary situations as a sort of corollary of the well-established principle of sovereignty of States over their territory. In the last decades, International law has been increasingly faced to contexts in which pollution concerns resources over which States have no jurisdiction, such as the atmosphere. Therefore the question arises as to whether these elements - as evidence of practice and opinion juris – form the basis of a <b>customary</b> <b>duty</b> to preserve shared resources or, vice versa, if the legal problems inevitably associated with the protection of res communes omnium prevent the birth of a customary principle. A further evolution of the principle might consist in the duty not to pollute the environment in absolute terms, thus implying the prohibition, for the State, to damage its own territory. This formulation would, contrarily to what observed with respect to the first version of the principle, contradict the dogma of national sovereignty over population and territory; still, the existence of this evolution is supported by different elements. In the first place, the existence of International instruments protecting certain resources independently from their location. Secondly, the growing presence of a human right to a decent environment in legal instruments pertaining to different subsystems of International law. The jurisprudence of International tribunals confirms this tendency, therefore suggesting the idea of the protection of the environment per se is becoming one of the aims pursued by the International community...|$|E

50|$|Depending on the culture, {{and family}} and social structures, {{same-sex}} preferences {{have been found to}} develop between 3 and 9 years old. (LaFreniere, Strayer,& Gauthier, 1984; Jacklin& Maccoby, 1978; Harkness & Super, 1985). LaFreniere, Strayer, and Gauthier (1984) conducted a three-year-long study observing fifteen peer groups between the ages of 1 to 6 years old, 98 boys and 93 girls. As they looked into sex-segregation in childhood, the researchers found that segregation rose with age and that most Western children exhibit these preferences around 3-4 years old. However, in a study by Harkenss and Super, Kenyan children were not found to have sex-preference in playmates until the ages of 6 to 9 years old. Researchers observed 152 Kenyan children in rural settings and found that this change didn’t occur until parental expectations and <b>customary</b> <b>duties</b> increased. “Just when and how such gender segregation appears, is the joint product of the individual and the culturally constructed niche” (Harkness & Super, 1985).|$|R

40|$|This Article {{discusses}} the competences and {{powers of the}} UN Security Council in securing compliance with international humanitarian law, in particular through {{the adoption of the}} measures provided in Chapter VII of the Charter: The competence of the Council in this field can be founded on several legal grounds: on a broad interpretation of the notion of “threat to the peace” (Article 39 of the Charter), on Article 94 (2) with regard to the International Court of Justice's judgments establishing violations of the jus in bello and also on the <b>customary</b> <b>duty</b> to ensure respect for international humanitarian law as reflected in Article 1 Common to the 1949 Geneva Conventions on the Protection of the Victims of War. In particular, such customary provision empowers the Security Council to react to any violation of international humanitarian law regardless of a nexus with concerns of international stability. Although the Council has adopted a variety of measures in relation to violations of the laws of war, the most incisive ones are those provided in Articles 41 and 42 of Chapter VII, which however are not without problems. The role the Security Council has played in the enforcement of international humanitarian law has been criticized because of its selective and opportunistic approach, which is due to the political nature of the organ. Also, in several instances the Council, far from securing compliance with the jus in bello, has instead interfered with its application. However selective and imperfect the Council's approach might be, though, its power to adopt decisions binding on UN members and its competence to take or authorize coercive measures involving the use of force make it potentially a formidable instrument against serious violations of international humanitarian law, partly remedying the lack of enforcing mechanisms in the treaties on the laws of war...|$|E

40|$|Recent American {{research}} has explored developmental trends in gender segregation of children's peer groups. However, {{it is important}} to differentiate systematic trends in children from systematic changes in their environments. This report, based on data gathered from 1972 to 1975, presents evidence on gender segregation in Kipsigis children's peer groups in Kokwet, a rural community in Kenya. Gender segregation is examined in culturally characteristic settings and is discussed in relation to both developmental and cultural issues. Observational data from 152 children ages 18 months to 9 years reveal that there is no segregation by gender in peer groups until around the age of 6. At that time, changes in settings, parental expectations, and <b>customary</b> <b>duties</b> result in an increase in the proportion of same-sex peers in the peer group. Even within this pattern, {{there is some evidence that}} children do not interact more with same-sex peers. A contrast is drawn with the adult pattern of gender segregation, and emphasis is given to the importance of culture and development as interactive systems.

The trooper's indoctrination in the mission of the Constabulary gave him a knowledge of his responsibilities and the functions of the Constabulary. The Constabulary School had standards comparable to those of Army Service Schools in the United States. A graduate of Sonthofen was qualified, not only to perform his duties, but also to serve as an instructor in his unit.

40|$|Definitions of Japan’s Shugendo {{tradition}} often emphasize how its adherents, {{known as}} yamabushi or shugenja, took {{as their primary}} goal the acquisition of supernatural power and enlightenment via ascetic practice in the mountains. While mountain austerities were central to the tradition, settled, spouse-keeping yamabushi organized into households constituted {{the majority of its}} members in the late medieval and early modern periods; the study of their economic, political, and social activities have been neglected. The Shugendo organization headquartered at Mt. Haguro, one of the Dewa Sanzan triad of sacred mountains within present-day Yamagata prefecture, administered yamabushi and miko priestesses based in communities throughout northern Japan. Using the Sanada Shichirozaemon and Sanada Shikibu households, elite yamabushi families based in Toge at the foot of Mt. Haguro, this study investigates the lives and activities of spouse-keeping shugenja within the Shugendo tradition during Japan’s early modern period (1600 - 1867). ^ Existing in a liminal space between the seeming dichotomies of worldly and ascetic, lay and monastic, and folk and elite, the Sanadas and their peers navigated a complicated web of relationships to preserve their positions and fortunes. Working with documents from the previously unread Sanada Gyokuzobo archive, this study argues for the centrality of the household unit within Japanese religious traditions. The privileges and obligations of the Sanada households, as well as their relationships with superiors and subordinates, both at Mt. Haguro and in its parishes, were based on the household rather than the individual, and were passed on from house head to house head. As local elites, the Sanada households enjoyed a hereditary place of honor within Haguro’s social, ritual, and political hierarchies. Documentation was a necessary strategy to maintain their <b>customary</b> privileges and <b>duties</b> both at the organization’s headquarters at Mt. Haguro and within its parishes across northern Japan. Networks that linked the Sanada families with superiors on Haguro’s summit and subordinates in parishes, as well as their lay patrons, the Nanbu family of daimyo, were defined and defended by documents exchanged within these networks. ...|$|R
40|$|Oceans cover 70 % of the world's {{surface and}} {{are a source of}} 90 % of the world's biomass. Oceans provide the world's populations with food and {{facilitate}} international trade in goods. The shipping industry is a notable source (although not leading source) of marine pollution both from operational discharges and maritime incidents. With a vast number of ships navigating the world's oceans the impact of maritime incidents, especially of bulk carriers of oil, on the marine environment can be devastating. Ships which become distressed often attempt to find a 'place of refuge', being nearby port or a sheltered area within the territorial waters of a nearby coastal state. Traditionally these ships in distress had the customary law right of entry into port {{in order to ensure that}} persons on board could be saved. This position seems to have changed in the modern age. With the advancement of modern technology persons on board can be saved without bringing the distressed ship into port. In addition, these ships in distress present a serious risk to the marine environment within the waters of the coastal state. Coastal state practice seems to indicate that coastal states prioritise the preservation of their own sovereign waters over the needs of the particular ship in distress, especially where there is no risk to human life. It would seem that the traditional customary law rights of ships in distress do not apply to circumstances where there is no risk to the persons on board and where there is only a risk to the marine environment. These ships are now commonly called ships in need of assistance and are differentiated from ships in distress due to the fact that the risk is one to the marine environment and not to human life. The result of the refusing places of refuge creates the problem of ships in need of assistance as such ships proceed to beg for entry from other nearby coastal states usually being refused along the way. Through the discussion of notable maritime incidents of this nature it will be shown that such refusal of entry by coastal states into a place of refuge is a leading factor that increases the probability of a maritime incident occurring and thereby increasing the likelihood of damage to the marine environment. The concept of state sovereignty has been utilised as a justification for coastal states refusing entry into a place of refuge. This dissertation will discuss the concept of coastal state sovereignty paying particular attention to the legislative and enforcement rights of coastal states in the regulation of pollution and the protection of the marine environment. The international community has long since recognised that the protection of the marine environment is a general state duty and a principle of international <b>customary</b> law. The <b>duty</b> to protect and preserve the marine environment guides, informs and restricts coastal state action. This dissertation analyses the relationship between sovereignty and the duty to protect the marine environment in the context of ships in need of assistance in modern international law. This dissertation seeks to conclude with an overall analysis of the current customary and modern international law rights of ships in need of assistance in order to determine whether coastal states are obliged to grant places of refuge. The IMO Guidelines will be discussed to analyse whether same add any value to the problem of ships in need of assistance and to what end such guidelines indicate further development on this issue...|$|R
