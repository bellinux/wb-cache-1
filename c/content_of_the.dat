40|$|In some {{critical}} application areas, {{it is not}} allowed to modify <b>the</b> <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> text, like military, legal and literature fields. Therefore, restoring <b>the</b> original <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> text becomes a practical and important issue for text watermarking. This study aims to deal with this problem. We firstly present <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> reversible text watermarking and then bring forth an effective scheme to achieve reversible text watermarking. Based on the synonym substitution method, the proposed algorithm applies an invertible transform to embed watermark, extract watermark and recover <b>the</b> original <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> text. By using the reversible watermarking scheme, one can not only protect <b>the</b> interests <b>of</b> <b>the</b> author <b>of</b> <b>the</b> text, but also get <b>the</b> original <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> text, if the receiver has the wish and right to revert <b>the</b> original <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> text. Moreover, the scheme improves the payload capacity via using high embedding level, compressing the watermark or repeating the algorithm more than one time...|$|R

5|$|Another {{way of life}} of chemotrophs in {{the absence}} of {{possible}} electron acceptors is fermentation, wherein the electrons taken from the reduced substrates are transferred to oxidised intermediates to generate reduced fermentation products (e.g., lactate, ethanol, hydrogen, butyric acid). Fermentation is possible, because the energy <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> substrates is higher than that of the products, which allows the organisms to synthesise ATP and drive their metabolism.|$|E

5|$|Caddisfly {{cases are}} open at both ends, the larvae drawing oxygenated water through the {{posterior}} end, over their gills, and pumping {{it out of}} the wider, anterior end.

This mechanism enable caddisfly larvae to live in waters too low in oxygen content to support stonefly and mayfly larvae.|$|E

During the campaign, Bevin criticized McConnell for voting in favor of those actions as a senator. When Beck asked Bevin about the issue during an interview, Bevin said the <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> report had been written by the fund's chief investment officer, {{and that he had}} only signed it because he was legally required to do so as president of the fund. Later, Bevin added that he had not physically signed the letter, but that his signature was added to the document digitally. Lawyers interviewed by the Lexington Herald-Leader said it would have been legal for Bevin to change the <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> letter, but not the accompanying facts and financial data. The Herald-Leader further noted that Bevin had not signed some previous investor letters. His campaign offered no explanation for the inconsistency.|$|E
