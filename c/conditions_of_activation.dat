A recent study by another group (4) using a mouse model of endotoxin-induced acute lung injury confirmed the importance <b>of</b> NF-B <b>activation</b> in induction <b>of</b> lung injury by demonstrating a complete preven-tion of lung edema by a specific IB kinase inhibitor.

40|$|It is {{now well}} {{established}} that immune responses involve intricate, highly regulated interactions between functionally different sets and subsets of lymphocytes. The available evidences indicate that helper T lymphocytes, in particular, play {{an essential role}} in the initiation of most antibody or cell mediated responses. Activation of mature T helper cells leads to the production of regulatory factors that {{have an effect on the}} activation and function of other cells of the immune system. Numerous studies therefore are devoted to the <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>activation</b> and inactivation of these lymphocytes. In the present work we focus more specifically on the induction of long-lasting unresponsiveness after interaction of Interleukin- 2 (I 1 – 2) producing T helper cells with antigen. This phenomenon is important for the downregulation of a normal immune response, and might also participate in the mechanisms of self-tolerance. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

40|$|Listeria monocytogenes is a {{foodborne}} pathogen {{known for}} its tolerance to <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> osmotic and chill stress. Accumulation of glycine betaine {{has been found to}} be important in the organism’s tolerance to both of these stresses. A procedure was developed for the purification of membranes from L. monocytogenes cells in which the putative ATP-driven glycine betaine permease glycine betaine porter II (Gbu) is functional. As is the case for the L. monocytogenes sodium-driven glycine betaine uptake system (glycine betaine porter I), uptake in this vesicle system was dependent on energization by ascorbate-phenazine methosulfate. Vesicles lacking the gbu gene product had no uptake activity. Transport by this porter did not require sodium ion and could be driven only weakly by artificial gradients. Uptake rates could be manipulated under conditions not affecting secondary transport but known to affect ATPase activity. The system was shown to be both osmotically activated and cryoactivated. Under <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> osmotic <b>activation,</b> the system exhibited Arrhenius-type behavior although the uptake rates were profoundly affected by the physical state of the membrane, with breaks in Arrhenius curves at approximately 10 and 18 °C. In the absence <b>of</b> osmotic <b>activation,</b> the permease could be activated by decreasing temperature within the range of 15 to 4 °C. Kinetic analyses of the permease at 30 °C revealed Km values for glycine betaine of 1. 2 and 2. 9 mM with Vmax values of 2, 200 and 3, 700 pmol/min z mg <b>of</b> protein under <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> optimal osmotic <b>activation</b> as mediated by KCl and sucrose, respectively...|$|R

The effect of the GAL 4 protein-upstream activation sequence complex on the structure of adjacent chromatin required no other promoter sequences. Although sequences protected by histones in the repressed state became more accessible to micrococcal nuclease and (methidiumpropyl-EDTA) iron(II) cleavage following induction of transcription, DNA-protein particles containing these sequences retained the electrophoretic mobility of nucleosomes, indicating that the promoter region can be associated with nucleosomes under <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> transcription <b>activation...</b>|$|R

40|$|Invariant NKT (iNKT) cells {{modulate}} innate {{and adaptive}} immune responses through <b>activation</b> <b>of</b> myeloid dendritic cells and macrophages and via enhanced clonogenicity, differentiation, and egress of their shared myeloid progenitors. Because these same progenitors {{give rise to}} osteoclasts (OCs), which also mediate the egress of hematopoietic progenitors and orchestrate bone remodeling, we hypothesized that iNKT cells would extend their myeloid cell regulatory role to the development and function of OCs. In this study, we report that selective <b>activation</b> <b>of</b> iNKT cells by α-galactosylceramide causes myeloid cell egress, enhances OC progenitor and precursor development, modifies the intramedullary kinetics of mature OCs, and enhances their resorptive activity.

Upon ectopic expression in mammalian cells, the EGFR/ret chimera was correctly synthesized and transported to the cell surface, where it was shown capable of binding EGF and transducing an EGF-dependent signal intracellularly. Thus, the EGFR/ret chimera allows us to study the biological effects and biochemical activities of the ret kinase under controlled <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>activation.</b> Comparative analysis of the growth-promoting activity of the EGFR/ret chimera expressed in fibroblastic or hematopoietic cells revealed a biological phenotype clearly distinguishable {{from that of the}} EGFR, indicating that the two kinases couple with mitogenic pathways which are different to some extent. Analysis of biochemical pathways implicated in the transduction of mitogenic signals also evidenced significant differences between the ret kinase and other receptor tyrosine kinases.

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} {{feasibility}} of using a spent fluid catalytic cracking catalyst (SFCC) as precursor {{for the production of}} geopolymers. The mechanical and structural characterization of alkali-activated SFCC binders formulated with different overall (activator + solid precursor) SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 and Na 2 O/SiO 2 molar ratios are reported. Formation of an aluminosilicate ‘geopolymer’ gel is observed under all <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>activation</b> used, along with formation of zeolites. Increased SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 induces the formation of geopolymers with reduced mechanical strength, for all the Na 2 O/SiO 2 ratios assessed, which is associated with excess silicate species supplied by the activator. This is least significant at increased alkalinity conditions (higher Na 2 O/SiO 2 ratios), as larger extents of reaction of the spent catalyst are achieved. SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 and Na 2 O/SiO 2 ratios of 2. 4 and 0. 25, respectively, promote the highest compressive strength (67 MPa).
