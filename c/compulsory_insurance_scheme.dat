This paper provides an empirical assessment {{of the influence of}} Vietnam's health insurance schemes on both hospital admission and the length of stay (LOS) using the Vietnam National Health Survey 2001 - 2002 and an appropriate count data regression model. Our findings suggest that the influence of health insurance on hospital admission and the LOS varies across insurance schemes. The <b>compulsory</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>scheme</b> and the insurance scheme for the poor increase the expected LOS by factors of 1. 18 and 1. 39, respectively, while the voluntary insurance scheme has minimal effect on the expected LOS. Insurance also increases the likelihood of hospital admission far more for compulsory members than for members of the other two insurance schemes. The positive influence of insurance on hospital admission and the LOS also varies across income quintiles, regions and types of health facilities. While the compulsory and voluntary schemes increase the likelihood of hospital admission more for lower and middle income individuals, the influence of the compulsory scheme on the expected LOS is more pronounced for patients in the middle income groups. The influence of insurance on the LOS is also found to be stronger in the North than in the South and stronger for patients admitted to provincial hospitals rather than district hospitals.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{break-up}} of the USSR brought considerable disruption {{to health}} services in Russia. The uptake of {{compulsory health insurance}} rose rapidly after its introduction in 1993. However, by 2000 coverage was still incomplete, especially amongst the disadvantaged. By this time, however, the state health service had become more stable, {{and the private sector}} was growing. This paper describes subsequent trends and determinants of healthcare insurance coverage in Russia, and its relationship with health service utilisation, as well as the role of the private sector. Methods Data were from the Russia Longitudinal Monitoring Survey, an annual household panel survey (2000 – 4) from 38 centres across the Russian Federation. Annual trends in insurance coverage were measured (2000 – 4). Cross-sectional multivariate analyses of the determinants of health insurance and its relationship with health care utilisation were performed in working-age people (18 – 59 years) using 2004 data. Results Between 2000 and 2004, coverage by the <b>compulsory</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>scheme</b> increased from 88 % to 94 % of adults; however 10 % of working-age men remained uninsured. Compulsory health insurance coverage was lower amongst the poor, unemployed, unhealthy and people outside the main cities. The uninsured were less likely to seek medical help for new health problems. 3 % of respondents had supplementary (private) insurance, and rising utilisation of private healthcare was greatest amongst the more educated and wealthy. Conclusion Despite high population insurance coverage, a multiply disadvantaged uninsured minority remains, with low utilisation of health services. Universal insurance could therefore increase access, and potentially contribute to reducing avoidable healthcare-related mortality. Meanwhile, the socioeconomically advantaged are turning increasingly to a growing private sector. </p...|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{increasing}} {{availability of}} generic drugs (GD) {{resulted in a}} remarkable reduction in treatment costs that allowed a better access to health care. The {{aim of this study}} is to evaluate the share of anti-asthmatic generic drugs during the period 1999 - 2010 in Morocco and to look at the factors influencing generic development. Methods: In this study, we used Moroccan sales data from IMS Health (Intercontinental Marketing Services). The consumption of the drugs was expressed in DDD/ 1000 inhabitants/day according to the WHO ATC/DDD methodology. Results: Between 1999 and 2010, anti-asthmatic consumption increased from 3. 91 to 14. 43 DDD/ 1000 inhabitants/day. The market of anti-asthmatic generic drugs progressed from 1. 83 (47 %) to 2. 18 (23 %) DDD/ 1000 inhabitants/day from 1999 to 2010. In 2010, inhaled glucocorticosteroids ranked first (0. 83 DDD/ 1000 inhabitants/day), followed by inhaled short acting beta agonists (0. 73 DDD/ 1000 inhabitants/day). The number of brands went from 27 in 1999 to 34 in 2010, with a generic share increasing from 55. 55 % to 70. 59 %. The number of anti-asthmatic pharmaceutical preparations increased from 57 to 64 during the same period, of which 31 and 42 were generic preparations. In 2010, the total cost of anti-asthmatic dugs was about 22 million euro, the generics representing 14 million euro. Conclusion: Despite the introduction of a <b>compulsory</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>scheme</b> called “AMO”, that allows a refund for 69. 5 % of anti-asthmatic specialties marketed in Morocco, anti-asthmatic generic drug consumption remains limited.

40|$|The Brazilian Health Care System {{involves}} a large {{variety of sources}} of finance and methods of organising medical care. Inpatient care {{in the country is}} mainly financed by a <b>compulsory</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>scheme</b> - INAMPS. The most relevant providers of inpatient care for INAMPS are contracted private hospitals which are reimbursed on a prospective payment scheme. Hospitals' claims - AIH forms are processed by a central computer system. This study aimed to investigate inequalities in health care in Brazil - more specifically, to assess inequalities in the use of contracted private hospitals in the city of Rio de Janeiro in 1986. The main hypothesis was that contracted private hospitals would be treating selective groups within the population and that the pattern of use of these services would vary across social groups. This investigation was based on data originated from the AIH forms and a study was conducted to assess the reliability of these data. Contracted private hospitals were shown to treat a limited and selective share of the health care market in the city of Rio de Janeiro - split between the areas of maternity and geriatric care using low technology. Variations in the patterns of use between the social groups are discussed in relation to age and sex distribution, case-mix, process and outcome of care. The explanatory role of the social variable (payment status) was tested. Payment status was shown to be a significant variable in explaining variations in use between patients. The less prestigious social groups, such as the unemployed, appeared less likely to receive appropriate care.

40|$|The {{courses of}} {{individual}} people's working lives constitute {{the object of}} research into the patterns of working life. In the context of socio-medical research into working life patterns, the health-related consequences of gainful employment and interruptions in it (research into causes of sickness), the consequences of impaired health on the course of working life, (research into the consequences of sickness) as well as interactions between career progression and poor health are examined. Using a progression perspective makes it possible in these analyses {{to take into account}} the progressions of illnesses and chronicity processes, to recognise selection effects (e. g. so-called healthy and unhealthy worker effects) and to demonstrate risk accumulation as well as processes of weakening, increasing disability and stabilisation, all of which remain invisible in studies based on cross-sectional data. Agood data basis for many issues, especially in socio-medical research into the pattern of working life, is the personal data of insured members and their benefits recorded by the <b>compulsory</b> health <b>insurance</b> companies (<b>compulsory</b> health <b>insurance</b> <b>scheme</b> data) which accumulates continuously in the course of the administrative processes. This data not only includes progression- related details concerning periods of incapacity for work, stays in clinics and diagnoses, but over and above that also documents important events in the course of working life for the members of health <b>insurance</b> <b>schemes</b> on a longitudinal basis exact to the day. In this article a number of possibilities are shown for analysing relationships between sickness and the course of working life on the basis of health insurance data and these are illustrated using examples of empirical research results.

40|$|Using {{household}} panel data from Vietnam, this paper compares out-of-pocket health expenditures on outpatient care at a health facility between insured and uninsured patients {{as well as}} across various providers. In the random effects model, the estimated coefficient of the insurance status variable suggests that insurance reduces out-of-pocket spending by 24 % for those with the compulsory and voluntary coverage and by about 15 % for those with the health insurance for the poor coverage. However, the modest financial protection of the compulsory and voluntary schemes disappears once we control for time-invariant unobserved individual effects using the fixed effects model. Additional analysis of the interaction terms involving the type of insurance and health facility suggests that the overall insignificant reduction in out-of-pocket expenditures {{as a result of}} the <b>insurance</b> <b>schemes</b> masks wide variations in the reduction in out-of-pocket sending across various providers. Insurance reduces out-of-pocket expenditures more for those enrollees using district and higher level public health facilities than those using commune health centers.
