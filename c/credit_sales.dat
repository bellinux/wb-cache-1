25|$|After {{his term}} as {{governor}} expired, Coles returned briefly to Virginia, {{where his mother}} had died that spring. Coles then returned to his farm outside of Edwardsville. He focused on agricultural and business pursuits, between continued trips to Virginia and Philadelphia to visit {{family and friends and}} to search for a wife. His friend Daniel Pope Cook was defeated by a proslavery opponent in 1826, and legislators had selected their pro-slavery speaker John McLean to fill unexpired U.S. Senate terms in 1824 and 1829 (voters ultimately electing Elias Kent Kane and John McCracken Robinson to those seats). Coles made his last run for public office in 1831. As candidate for Congress, running against eight candidates including pro-slavery Democrats Joseph Duncan (allied with Treasury Secretary William H. Crawford) and Sidney Breese (a Jacksonian Democrat), Coles polled a distant third. He had been out of public view for some years, and refused to align himself with any political party. Instead, Coles campaigned on his successful term as governor, proclaimed his association with the founding fathers, and criticized the Jacksonian platform. Still, Coles felt devastated by the political defeat, and moved back east. Nonetheless, in 1835, Illinois legislators authorized Coles to sell bonds to finance his canal project, but since they also refused to back the bonds with state <b>credit,</b> <b>sales</b> proved slow.|$|E

40|$|AbstractCredit {{transactions}} between enterprises {{are getting}} increasingly common, and <b>credit</b> <b>sale</b> (<b>Credit</b> <b>Sale,</b> CS) risk management {{has become an}} important part of modern business activity and management. Currently, the accounts in arrears between enterprises have become a very serious problem, due to the imperfect internal management mechanism and lack of effective <b>credit</b> <b>sale</b> risk management system. In order to make products quickly enter market to win time and achieve scale effect, <b>credit</b> <b>sale</b> has inevitably become the choice of emerging market enterprise. Based on this, we carry out the study to discuss the <b>credit</b> <b>sale</b> risk of emerging market enterprise. Firstly, we do the costs analysis of product <b>credit</b> <b>sale</b> of the emerging market enterprise, and establish a theoretical relationship between the accounts receivable holdings and the credit costs. Secondly, the general analytical expression of optimal accounts receivable holdings and the lowest credit costs is deduced; further, the concept and calculation method of risk-adjusted return on <b>credit</b> <b>sale</b> is proposed. Finally, based on the characteristics of emerging markets, we propose the concept of “credit sale risk capital”, which should be reserved {{in order to avoid the}} unexpected losses caused by the product <b>credit</b> <b>sale</b> risk, thus making the return of <b>credit</b> <b>sale</b> match the risk of emerging market enterprise...|$|R

25|$|By {{the timing}} of collection, VAT (as well as {{accounting}} in general) can be either accrual or cash based. Cash basis accounting is a very simple form of accounting. When a payment is received {{for the sale of}} goods or services, a deposit is made, and the revenue is recorded as of the date of the receipt of funds—no matter when the sale had been made. Cheques are written when funds are available to pay bills, and the expense is recorded as of the cheque date—regardless of when the expense had been incurred. The primary focus is on the amount of cash in the bank, and the secondary focus is on making sure all bills are paid. Little effort is made to match revenues to the time period in which they are earned, or to match expenses to the time period in which they are incurred. Accrual basis accounting matches revenues to the time period in which they are earned and matches expenses to the time period in which they are incurred. While it is more complex than cash basis accounting, it provides much more information about your business. The accrual basis allows you to track receivables (amounts due from customers on <b>credit</b> <b>sales)</b> and payables (amounts due to vendors on credit purchases). The accrual basis allows you to match revenues to the expenses incurred in earning them, giving you more meaningful financial reports.|$|E

Of the five U.S. state supreme courts that have addressed the question, three (Massachusetts, Arkansas and Maine) concluded that the transaction was a lease.
