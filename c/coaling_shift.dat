25|$|Over time, African Americans {{migrated}} from agricultural communities to urban areas, {{and from the}} river towns to the coal mines of southern Iowa. This urban shift started around 1870, while the <b>coal</b> mining <b>shift</b> started in 1880. The <b>coal</b> mining <b>shift</b> began when African-Americans were brought from the southern states to the southern Iowa coal mines as strikebreakers, after which they remained employed there. This immigration was augmented by poor economic conditions in the southern states resulting from discrimination, flood and pest-induced crop failures, and disadvantaged post-reconstruction economic arrangements like sharecropping. The relatively significant African-American immigration to the southern Iowa coal fields led to largely African-American settlements such as Buxton.|$|R

5000|$|Normally, {{the long}} hood is {{the rear of}} the locomotive. For early hood unit models, this was not the case; railroads {{preferred}} to run with the long hood at the front and the cab at the rear (referred to as operating long hood forward or LHF). It is a common misconception that locomotives were run LHF to provide greater protection, although {{it may have been a}} secondary benefit. Southern Railway and Norfolk and Western Railway operated their locomotives bidirectionally to make <b>coal</b> <b>shifting</b> more efficient. By putting the engineer on the right side with the Long Hood Forward, the engineer could see signals down the long hood and around the short hood for operations in both directions. [...] Later, preferences changed to having the short hood at the front and the long hood at the rear for better visibility and with the advent of Wide, or Comfort, cabs. Visibility became a deciding factor when more powerful engines required larger, visibility-obscuring radiator units.|$|R

50|$|As the furnaces, {{shipping}} {{industry and}} the trains {{all of whom were}} the most important buyers of <b>coal</b> <b>shifted</b> to other energy sources Lota's coal industry begun to struggle for survival in the late 20th century. This situation was not totally unforeseen as, as early as the 1920s, there were concerns for the vulnerability of the coal-dependent local economy. One of the problems Lota's coal industry had to remain competitive was the difficulty to mechanize as coal beds are thin in nature and displaced by many geological faults. Costs did also increased as the prizes of wood beams increased and easily accessible coal beds were depleted and mining had to be done below the sea bed. The mines were closed in the 1990s after demand for Lota's coal resources diminished and cheaper Colombian coal arrived on the market, plunging the residents of Lota into poverty. The endpoint came in 1997 when Empresa Nacional del Carbón closed the mines definitively and sold the industrial equipment. Subsequently, the mines were flooded.|$|R

50|$|During the 1860s {{the railroads}} {{had become the}} king of {{transportation}} with their improved power and speed of travel, so like most North American canals, the Schuylkill Canal began to decline in use for general freight and the wealthier westward bound passengers had long since used the Philadelphia and Columbia Railroad to reach the Pennsylvania Canal System to cross the Alleghenies. In 1857, the Pennsylvania Railroad had connected Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, would eventually add New York City and Chicago, and {{was instrumental in the}} declining fortunes of Pennsylvania's far flung network of canals. Railroads could reach mine heads and coal breakers where no stream existed to support the costly digging of a new ditch. <b>Coal</b> <b>shifted</b> away from canals to the more flexible means of bulk goods transportation.

30|$|The dynamic {{optimization}} of {{the real}} options model in this study yields two main results: option values and optimal trigger price. The option values at every period of investment are obtained by maximizing the value of using <b>coal</b> or <b>shifting</b> to renewables subject to stochastic prices of coal. From the options values, the trigger price is determined as the minimum price of coal that maximizes the option values between the initial period and the terminal period of investment. At this price of coal, switching to renewables is optimal.|$|R

50|$|The Civil War {{created a}} shift in the makeup of the {{anthracite}} coal industry. Prior to the war, the industry involved many small-scale mines with short-term leases resulting in increasing production levels but an overall trend of falling prices. In 1830 anthracite coal was selling for $11 per ton, in 1840 it was $7 per ton, and by 1860 it was $5.50 a ton in NYC, while total production was increasing (Adams, “US Coal Industry”). This was due in part to a general anti-charter sentiment towards the coal industry by the Pennsylvania state government, making it difficult for coal corporations to receive charters (Adams, “Different Charters”), as well as a seasonal market that experienced fluctuation in demand for anthracite (Dublin, Licht, 17). The onset of the war brought an increased need for fuel for the army, and in turn an expected increase in demand for coal. The boom of investment in the coal industry and predicted large-scale production of anthracite <b>coal</b> <b>shifted</b> the mentality of the Pennsylvania state government, and the legislature dramatically increased the number and quality of charters it granted to mining companies (Adams, “Different Charters”). Individual proprietors fell to the expansion of corporations who could master the large-scale production and efficient transportation that the wartime economy called for. The major railroad companies came to dominate the industry as they began to purchase coalfields in order to control both the production and shipping aspects. With increased concentration of capital among the smaller number of operations they were able to create deeper and deeper mining shafts to reach new levels of coal (Dublin, Licht, 18-9). By the end of the 19th century the Pennsylvania anthracite industry was controlled by a handful of major railroad corporations.|$|R
50|$|Ukrainian {{reserves}} of hard coals {{are concentrated in}} the Donets Basin. More than two hundred coal mines of Donbass account for 90% of Ukrainian coal output; the balance comes from 18 mines in Lviv Oblast and Volyn Oblast. Metallurgical-grade coals account for 54% of national coal reserves. In the 2000s the mix of Ukrainian <b>coal</b> output <b>shifted</b> in favor of energy coals and the steel mills compensated for the deficit of metallurgical coals with imports of coke from Russia (7 million tonnes in 2007) and other countries. Coal mining in Donbass is in continuous financial distress: the majority of coal mines, owned by the government, operate at a loss and require regular financial aid. Labor productivity in the Ukrainian coal industry is three to eight times lower than in Russia, Central Europe and the United States.|$|R
40|$|The {{proposition}} {{of combining}} {{the application of}} algae in wastewater treatment, CO 2 fixation, and energy production maximizes the opportunity of algal bioremediation. In this paper, the freshwater macroalga Oedogonium, a key target species for the bioremediation of waste waters, was investigated for its utilization in energy production via gasification or co-gasification with coal. The pyrolysis characteristics of Oedogonium {{and the effects of}} pyrolysis conditions on char reactivity were investigated in this paper, and an Australian lignite was also studied for comparison purposes. The pyrolysis process of Oedogonium and coal can be divided into three stages: moisture evaporation, volatile release, and decomposition of the remaining carbonaceous compounds. However, the devolatilization of Loy Yang coal was slower and occurred over a wider temperature range compared to Oedogonium. As the heating rate increased, the pyrolysis curves for both Oedogonium and Loy Yang <b>coal</b> <b>shifted</b> to higher temperatures. To investigate the effects of pyrolysis conditions on char reactivity, a tube reactor was employed to generate char samples under a range of pyrolysis conditions. The produced char samples were characterized using a CHN analyzer and scanning electron microscopy technique. It was found that char samples almost maintain their original shape following pyrolysis at a low heating rate. However, evidence of char swelling was observed in the structure of chars prepared at a high heating rate. Pyrolysis conditions also had a significant influence on the reactivity of the derived chars. Char reactivity for both fuels was enhanced at a higher heating rate and lower pyrolysis temperature. Oedogonium char reactivity was around 2 – 5 times that of Loy Yang char prepared under the same pyrolysis conditions. However, the differences in reactivity became less significant as the pyrolysis temperature increased. Oedogonium has a higher devolatilization rate and higher char reactivity than Loy Yang lignite. It implies that it is easier to be gasified, and the co-gasification with lignite is advantageous...|$|R
