Rainfall is distributed fairly evenly throughout the year. The early convict settlements obtained most of their water from nearby streams, although some water was collected from roofs of buildings and wells. Present supplies are taken largely from the same sources and farmers have constructed dams for irrigation supplies and stock. Some development of groundwater resources from fractured rock aquifers and from <b>coastal</b> <b>sand</b> <b>deposits</b> has been undertaken. Small irrigation quantities are sometimes obtained although usually the bores are only capable of domestic and stock supplies.

30|$|Surficial and {{subsurface}} sediments of {{the area}} comprise of Quaternary to Recent alluvial <b>deposits</b> and <b>coastal</b> plain <b>sands</b> of the Dahomey Basin (Fig.  1; Jones and Hockey 1964; Durotoye 1975; Longe et al. 1987). The Dahomey Basin is an extensive Cretaceous, Tertiary and Recent sedimentary basin covering three southwestern states (Lagos, Ogun and Ondo) in the Nigeria sector of the basin (Jones and Hockey 1964; Whiteman 1982; Olabode and Mohammed 2016). The basal Cretaceous deposits of the Dahomey Basin, known as the Abeokuta Group, consist essentially of coarse-grained sandstones with interlayered shale in the lower part. Locally, the Abeokuta Group has been sub-divided into Ise, Afowo, and Araromi formations (Omatsola and Adegoke 1981). The overlying Tertiary deposit is composed of the Ewekoro, Akinbo shales, Oshoshun, Ilaro, and Alluvial <b>coastal</b> plain <b>sand</b> formations (Fig.  1). The uppermost alluvial and <b>coastal</b> plain <b>sands</b> <b>deposit</b> of Quaternary to Recent age consist of alternating successions of unconsolidated sands and clays, occurring along the coastal belt and as alluvial deposits along major rivers.|$|R
50|$|The thalli of Cetraria aculeata form shrubby {{tufts of}} up to 1-5 cm height, main {{branches}} are from 1 to 4 mm wide, terminal branches up to 1 mm wide, chemical tests K - and P -. The species is found fertile, and seems to propagate mainly by thallus fragmentation. Despite the apparent lack of ascospores, which can be dispersed across long distances, C. aculeata has a very wide distribution. It is frequent in open polar and boreal environments from the maritime Antarctic to the high Arctic.

40|$|Ancient {{collagen}} {{is used as}} archive {{for multiple}} pre-mortem traits. Testing {{the quality of the}} collagen extract is a common concern of those who engage in the reconstruction of ancient diets. The aim {{of this study is to}} improve our understanding of the pyrolysis fingerprints of human bone collagen especially in relation with diagenetic alteration. Pyrolysis-GC-MS was applied to 28 collagen samples extracted from archaeological human bone, corresponding to different chronological periods (Bronze Age to post-Medieval period; 1900 BC- 1800 AD) and different types of burial environment (acidic and alkaline) from NW Spain. Collagen was extracted following the common methodology used in paleodiet analysis, and a commercial gelatin sample was included for comparison. Data evaluation was based on 58 pyrolysis products using Principal Components Analysis (PCA). Principal component 1 (PC 1, 45 % of total variance) was related to the relative abundances of pyrolysis products of specific amino acids, with relatively degraded samples having larger proportions of the pyrolysis products of Pro/Hyp, Phe and Ala, while more intact samples showed larger proportions of Tyr, Trp and pyrolysis products of unspecific amino acid origin. PC 1 scores were related to the period to which the samples corresponded, which reflects differences in diagenetic impact, probably controlled by a combination of age and burial deposit characteristics. PC 2 (15 %) probably reflects the well-known effects of disruption of the amino acid sequence (depolymerization), causing a decline in dimerization products (diketopiperazines) upon pyrolysis. This process was more intense in the collagen samples from acidic deposits than in the samples from alkaline deposits (a calcareous cave and <b>coastal</b> <b>sand</b> <b>deposits</b> with biogenic carbonates). The relationships between the PCA and individual pyrolysis products with known parameters of collagen quality (% C, % N, C/N ratio, % extractable collagen) were generally insignificant or weak. This might be explained by the rather narrow C/N range (3. 19 - 3. 36) of the samples, which had to meet the criteria for suitability for paleodiet analysis. Moreover, there was no significant relation between the isotopic composition of the extracted collagen (δC, δN) and pyrolyzate composition, suggesting that diagenesis has little effect on the isotopic fingerprints used in palaeodietary studies. Finally, no substantial contamination of microbial or exogenous tissue from the deposition environment to the osteological collagen extracts was identified. It is concluded that the δC and δN as proxies of palaeodiet from these diverse necropoleis in NW Spain is sustained.

40|$|<b>Sand</b> {{extraction}} from <b>coastal</b> <b>sand</b> dunes {{results in}} significant loss of sand {{from the natural}} system, destruction of dune vegetation and dramatic geo-technical modification. This can place significant limitations on land use. The identification of, and extraction from sand bodies that {{are not part of}} active coastal barriers or dune structures is therefore considered to be a more environmentally sound practice. Sedimentological investigation of several back-barrier estuarine sequences have located several marine <b>sand</b> <b>deposits</b> within the Illawarra region that meet the above criteria. The action of overwash, possibly by tsunami waves in the late Holocene has deposited large volumes of <b>sand</b> from <b>coastal</b> barrier systems into their respective back-barrier environments. Several of these deposits are identified and mapped with detailed data on one of the deposits presented in this paper. These <b>sand</b> <b>deposits</b> are dominated by fine- to medium-grained quartz sand and hence represent a potential resource for construction sand in particular sand for concrete production. Advances in the understanding of late Holocene overwash activity on coastal sediments could assist in the identification of other <b>sand</b> <b>deposits</b> removed from the coastal zone. Such <b>deposits</b> may allow <b>sand</b> mining activities, providing significant resources of fine- to -medium-grained sand for the construction industry and beach nourishment programs under the principles of sound environmental management...|$|R
3000|$|... 19 {{representative}} {{samples were}} selected for the massive fine-grained sandstones (MFGS) lithofacies (Fig.  3). Thin-section images obtained under both plane and cross-polarized lights show moderately sorted and medium to fine quartz grains. The quartz grains are mainly monocrystalline, with random and moderate occurrence of medium-sized grains (Fig.  9), which is ascribed to the intrusion of <b>coastal</b> to coastal-fluviomarine <b>sand</b> <b>deposited</b> northwestwards of the prograding delta since the Middle Miocene (from Cycle IV onwards) (Abdulrahman et al. 2014). The lithofacies exhibits minor occurrence of K-feldspar dissolution (Fig.  8), indicating early stage of diagenesis after deposition (Boggs 2009). The quartz grains vary from sub angular to sub-rounded (Fig.  9), due to relatively far distance from source and several cycles of transport and abrasion (Boggs 2009). This lithofacies is characterized by significant amount of pore-filling fine-grained fractions that obliterate intergranular pores (Fig.  9), which is indicative of low-energy depositional environment and thus interpreted as wave-dominated middle to upper shoreface environment. Porosity distribution in this lithofacies averages at 16 % including intrapores (developed within embedded shell fragments; Fig.  9) and matrix-fracture porosity (Fig.  9). The thin sections show moderate abundance of both float and point contacts, {{which is consistent with}} the inferred slight to moderate compaction during burial, although random occurrence of concavo-convex contacts is observed in regions with high rock fragments and fine-grained fractions which modified the intergranular pore spaces.|$|R

The mineral content was analysed using X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and Joint Committee for Powder Diffraction Standard (JCPDS) program. The result showed that Lhok Mee <b>coastal</b> <b>sand</b> was physically characterized as white, sub-angular rounded shape and 0. 21 mm of size, while Beureunut <b>coastal</b> <b>sand</b> was light brown, rounded-well rounded shape and 0. 19 mm of size, then Leungah <b>coastal</b> <b>sand</b> was black, angular-well rounded shape and 0. 13 mm of size.
