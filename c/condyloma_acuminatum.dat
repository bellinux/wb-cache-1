SUBJECTS: 25 patients (24 males, 1 female) with a history of <b>condyloma</b> <b>acuminatum.</b> Twenty had failed previous treatment for <b>condyloma</b> <b>acuminatum.</b> In each patient, 3 distinct lesions were selected for treatment. Each selected lesion was randomly assigned to receive intralesionally one of the following: r-hIFN-beta 33, 000 IU/day, r-hIFN-beta 1 x 10 (6) IU/day, or matching placebo. SETTING: Institut Alfred Fournier, Paris, France. OUTCOME MEASURES: Response was evaluated colposcopically at the end of treatment (day 22) and 5 weeks later (month 2). Complete response (CR) was defined as disappearance of the treated lesion. Partial response (PR) was defined as at least a 50 % reduction in size, but not disappearance of the treated lesion.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{clinical}} {{course of}} human papillomavirus (HPV) associated with Bowenoid papulosis and <b>condyloma</b> <b>acuminatum</b> of anogenital tumors are still unknown. Here we evaluated molecules {{that are relevant}} to cellular proliferation and regulation of apoptosis in HPV associated anogenital tumors. Methods We investigated the levels of telomerase activity, and inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) family (c-IAP 1, c-IAP 2, XIAP) and c-Myc mRNA expression levels in 20 specimens of Bowenoid papulosis and 36 specimens of <b>condyloma</b> <b>acuminatum</b> in anogenital areas. Overall, phosphorylated (p-) AKT, p-ribosomal protein S 6 (S 6) and p- 4 E-binding protein 1 (4 EBP 1) expression levels were examined by immunohistochemistry in anogenital tumors both with and without positive telomerase activity. Results Positive telomerase activity was detected in 41. 7 % of Bowenoid papulosis and 27. 3 % of <b>condyloma</b> <b>acuminatum</b> compared to normal skin (p p p p = 0. 022, respectively) and normal skin (p p = 0. 002, p = 0. 034, respectively). Overall, 30 % of Bowenoid papulosis with high risk HPV strongly promoted IAPs family and c-Myc but <b>condyloma</b> <b>acuminatum</b> did not significantly activate those genes. Immunohistochemically, p-Akt and p-S 6 expressions were associated with positive telomerase activity but not with p- 4 EBP 1 expression. Conclusion Combined analysis of the IAPs family, c-Myc mRNA expression, telomerase activity levels and p-Akt/p-S 6 expressions may provide clinically relevant molecular markers in HPV associated anogenital tumors. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Introduction Giant <b>condyloma</b> <b>acuminatum,</b> {{also called}} a Buschke-Löwenstein tumor, first {{described}} in 1925, is a slow-growing, locally aggressive, destructive tumor of the ano-genital region. Scrotal tumors are rare. Reports on giant <b>condyloma</b> <b>acuminatum</b> lesions {{in patients with}} HIV and AIDS are surprisingly even rarer. Case presentation In this report, we present {{the case of a}} 42 -year-old African man with AIDS who was undergoing anti-retroviral therapy. He was found to have a giant <b>condyloma</b> <b>acuminatum</b> of the scrotum.

Conclusion Decision making regarding the goals of surgical intervention in the terminally ill is a complex process. The options include conservative medical palliation or palliative excision versus a curative excision that has the potential for significant morbidity. Wide surgical excision with local flap reconstruction significantly improved {{the quality of life of}} the patient described herein. The challenges presented by emerging or unusual presentations of surgical pathology secondary to HIV and AIDS in patients who are on anti-retroviral therapy provide an opportunity for research and the establishment of guidelines for the use of adjuvant chemotherapy in these patients. </p...|$|E

40|$|In {{urogenital}} lesions, {{human papillomavirus}} (HPV) {{has been known}} {{as the cause of}} <b>condyloma</b> <b>acuminatum,</b> which has long been {{considered one of the most}} commonly diagnosed sex-ually transmitted diseases (STD). HPV has received much attention clinically because HPV has also been detected at a high rate in genital cancers, such as penile cancer and uterine cervical cancer. Accordingly, since it has been shown that HPV is related to the occurrence of not only <b>condyloma</b> <b>acuminatum</b> but also genital cancers, the author studied HPV in urogenital lesions. 1) HPV has been detected at quite a high incidence even from genital organs without any abnormal findings. In subjects in their twenties, an age of high sexual activity, the HPV-positive rate was 8. 0 % (9 / 113) in males and 5. 3 % (10 / 189) in females. After several weeks, follow-up studies were conducted on HPV-positive cases. HPV was detected in one of 17 males and two of nine females, and the HPV DNA was the same type as at the first examination. However, after 3 - 4 months, all three cases had become negative for HPV DNA. It was thus speculated that HPV disaappears spontaneously. A multistep process must be necessary for HPV to attach to epithelial cells and form tumors. 2) The HPV-positive rate of <b>condyloma</b> <b>acuminatum</b> tissues was 95. 0 % (19 / 20) in males, while it was 100 % (2 / 2) in females. All of these cases were positive for HPV types 6 / 11, and two cases were also positive for HPV 16. Similar high rates of HPV detection were recorded for the smear specimens of <b>condyloma</b> <b>acuminatum</b> lesions : HPV types 6 / 11 were found in 95. 8 % (23 / 24) of males and 100 % (7 / 7) of females'. HPV can thus be detected using only smears of lesions. It is notewor-thy that four male cases of <b>condyloma</b> <b>acuminatum</b> underwent malignant changes after a long time, and HPV 16 was detected in the tissues of all of the resultant penile cancers. 3) HPV was detected in 63. 1 % (70 / 111) of untreated penile cancers and there was a clear ten-dency for HPV 16 to be the most prevalent type. HPV 18 was detected in two cases (1. 8 %), but HPV 33 could not be detected. The HPV DNA in the penile cancer tissues was located in the nuclei of the cancer cells. HPV 16 was also detected in six lymph node metastatic tissues of penile cancer, and the HPV type was the same as the HPV DNA type in the primary cancer. In cases treated with radiation and chemotherapy, the HPV-positive rate was reduced to 16. 7 % (2 / 12). 4) One case of <b>condyloma</b> <b>acuminatum</b> of the urinary bladder was positive for HPV 6 / 11. It is considered a possibility that HPV entered the urinary bladder by the transurethral route and caused the <b>condyloma</b> <b>acuminatum.</b> HPV was not detected in cases of prostate cancer, benign prostatic hyperplasia, bladder cancer or vulvar cancer...|$|E
40|$|Among 237 {{cases of}} {{condyloma}} diagnosed in Uganda between 1964 and 1975 seven types of lesions were defined. Three {{of these were}} found within a wide age range in both young and elderly people, namely, the common (49. 4 %) and the flat (2. 0 %) <b>condyloma</b> <b>acuminatum,</b> and <b>condyloma</b> <b>acuminatum</b> of irregular outline (13. 5 %). Four variants, on the other hand, fell into different age groups. <b>Condyloma</b> <b>acuminatum,</b> showing marked cell death (5. 1 %) and observed exclusively among girls {{in the first decade}} of life, displayed numerous aciophil bodies, presumably reflecting single cell necroses. Condylomata acuminata showing marked acanthosis (16. 9 %) were found in patients between 12 and 30 years, dysplastic condylomata acuminata (5. 9 %) between 20 and 62 years, and proliferative (giant) condylomata acuminata (7. 2 %) between 31 and 80 years of age. In the latter two groups of lesions, the inflammatory stromal infiltrate was more prominent, but cytoplasmic vacuolation, often believed to be a sign of viral infection, was seen less frequently than in the remaining types. In young people, the features seen resemble, therefore, a cytocidal and/or vacuolating viral infection, whereas the dysplastic and proliferative changes observed in older patients are compatible with malignant transformation being under way...|$|E
