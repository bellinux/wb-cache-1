40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} potential of land use as a mobility tool to affect travel, a subject of long and ongoing policy debate. Land use strategies such as densification, mixed-use development, and non-driving-oriented design have been recommended by many to reduce vehicle travel. Others argue that land use is an ineffective mobility tool; direct and effectual policies are economic measures such as pricing. This dissertation suggests that either is necessary but not sufficient. To achieve the environmental and social objectives of transportation, the two should act together as complements. The mobility role of land use is to modify transportation supply and to support expansion of travel choices, whereas pricing is to manage and redirect vehicle travel demand. This dissertation presents two case studies: Metropolitan Boston and Hong Kong.

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to study in a unique {{framework}} some of the most relevant aspects that have been shown to influence mobility choices. On one side we consider those factors related to individual travellers, such as the socioeconomic characteristics of the household, the kind of built environment and mobility-relevant factors such as the availability of vehicles. On the other, we take into account trip-specific contextual factors such as mode <b>choice,</b> <b>trip</b> purpose and related activity patterns. By using a relatively recent and powerful development of association analysis techniques, namely sequential pattern mining, we can add a longitudinal perspective in studying the related decision making process, therefore moving from a trip-based to a tour-based approach. We apply such technique to the public use trip file of the 2009 U. S. National Household Travel Survey. Some interesting results emerged from the preliminary analyses here reported. Different ways of using motorised private means according to the gender of the traveller were highlighted, with females travelling more with others and performing more complex tours; shorter trip chains were observed for non-motorised means, whereas the patterns of use of public transport services are different according to the kind of urban environment, with longer trip tours and more differentiated users where the service offer is likely to be more attractiv...|$|E
40|$|Understanding {{joint and}} causal {{relationships}} among multiple endogenous variables {{has been of}} much interest to researchers {{in the field of}} activity and travel behavior modeling. Structural equation models have been widely developed for modeling and analyzing the causal relationships among travel time, activity duration, car ownership, trip frequency and activity frequency. In the model, travel time and activity duration are treated as continuous variables, while car ownership, trip frequency and activity frequency as ordered discrete variables. However, many endogenous variables of interest in travel behavior are not continuous or ordered discrete but unordered discrete in nature, such as mode choice, destination <b>choice,</b> <b>trip</b> chaining pattern and time-of-day choice (it can be classified into a few categories such as AM peak, midday, PM peak and off-peak). A modeling methodology with involvement of unordered discrete variables is highly desired for better understanding the causal relationships among these variables. Under this background, the proposed dissertation study will be dedicated into seeking an appropriate modeling methodology which aids in identifying the causal relationships among activity and travel variables including unordered discrete variables. In this dissertation, the proposed modeling methodologies are applied for modeling the causal relationship between three pairs of endogenous variables: trip chaining pattern vs. mode choice, activity timing vs. duration and trip departure time vs. mode choice. The data used for modeling analysis is extracted from Swiss Travel Microcensus 2000. Such models provide us with rigorous criteria in selecting a reasonable application sequence of sub-models in the activity-based travel demand model system...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to assess the {{advantages}} and limitations of a low-cost, telephone-based traveler information system through the analysis of Fastline, a free, dial-in, traffic information service. Fastline is particularly well suited to this study because, unlike many other Advanced Traveler Information Systems (ATIS), it is already in use in the San Francisco Bay Area. Fastline is easily accessible and requires neither infrastructure development nor technology development; rather, it uses existing infrastructure and technology. This evaluation of the Fastline system is based upon user perceptions of the system's capacity to provide them with the information they need, desire, and will use to help pre-plan trips and encourage changes in trip-making behavior. Changes in trip characteristics, such as route <b>choice,</b> <b>trip</b> start-time, and perhaps, mode choice, may occur based upon the information provided by the system. The key to the study is an assessment of the degree to which users avail themselves of information to consider alternate route and/or mode choice, and to waht degree the alternatives considered effect trip-making behavior. A review of other ATIS projects indicates that there are varying levels of technological complexity and system accuracy leasing to use or non-use of such systems. This research is designed to assess system user's expectations and experiences, as well as the resulting changes, if any, in their trip-making behavior. Thus, the intent of this study is to determine 1) information user's consider important; 2) system use patterns; 3) user's evaluation of the information service attributes such as accuracy, timeliness, and ease of use; and 4) alteration of trip-making behavior due to system information.

40|$|As {{transportation}} {{engineering and}} planning evolve from “data poor” to “data rich” practices, methods to automate {{the collection and}} translation of data to information become increasingly important. Advances in wireless communications and technologies provide the opportunity to collect detailed data on travel trajectories using smartphones equipped with GPS and accelerometers. These types of smartphones are ubiquitous and, as such, present an opportunity to conveniently collect spatial and temporal data at regular time intervals. This can be useful to utilize as a method to document trip attributes of interest, namely origin, destination, departure time, route <b>choice,</b> <b>trip</b> purpose, and mode choice. Though some of these attributes can be relatively easily extracted from the smartphone data, inferring transportation mode(s) used by the trip maker remains a challenging problem. This research presents a data-driven classification model to infer the transportation mode(s) used by trip makers {{on the basis of}} data collected with GPS equipped smart phones. Rather than making a priori assumptions, we instead employ an optimization method to objectively produce the following classifier components and methods: a ranked feature vector based on the power of differentiation between different modes; the classification technique between the range of candidate classifiers; the number of ranked attributes to include in the feature vector; data formatting; and optimal model parameters. The model is trained and tested using labelled trip data. The calibrated model is evaluated by testing its ability to classify travel mode correctly for GPS data at a different level of disaggregation than the one used in the model training step. The model provides an accuracy of approximately 86 % at the disaggregated level (e. g., Walk, Bike, Transit, and Private Automobile) and approximately 94 % at aggregated level (e. g., Non-Motorized and Motorized.) The results obtained from the optimized model are supplemented with a GIS based model to improve the identification of transit trips. The method employed integrates GIS data such as the locations of transit stops and signalized intersections with observed travel patterns from the GPS embedded smartphone data. The combination of these two data sources generates new classification features that, when applied to the collected data, demonstrate that this technique vastly improves the accuracy of the classification model for identifying transit mode usage. 4 month...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{evaluate}} the transportation estimation in Metropolitan Muncie for the year 2000 done in 1975. The basis for evaluation is the present situation data. From these findings I expect to learn from what was correct and what was inaccurate in their projections. Finally, this study could present several recommendations for long-range transportation planning study in the future. Barton-Aschman Associates (B-A-A) transportation planning for Metropolitan Muncie for the year 2000 based on the year 1975 is a part of Delaware-Muncie Metropolitan Transportation Estimations. The B-A-A had done many studies for Metropolitan Muncie, including a comprehensive plan, to support transportation projections. Land-use, socio-economic, and vehicle travel were examined in order to produce accurate transportation estimates. Socio-economic variables for Metropolitan Muncie are population, occupied dwelling units, employment, and automobiles. Trip generation, trip distribution, mode <b>choice,</b> <b>trip</b> assignment, and traffic volume are projected in the final estimations. But this project focuses on relationships among variables: land-use, zoning change, population, occupied dwelling units, employment, average daily traffic volume (ADT), assigned over service volume, and level of service (L. O. S.) that were projected by the B-A-A and for the present situation in Metropolitan Muncie. Overall proposed land-uses in the transportation study coincide well with the actual situation 1992. But commercial land-use growth along West Bethel Ave and McGsllinrd Ave in Metropolitan Muncie was not foreseen by the transportation study. Overall estimations of population and occupied dwelling units in Metropolitan Muncie agree well with the present situation. But in tract 9. 01, 19. 01, and 19. 02 in north Metropolitan Muncie the present situation does not follow the transportation estimations closely and major differences appear between socio-economic estimations and the actual situation. Estimations of employment by the B-A-A are not closely with the present situation. Overall transportation estimates of average daily traffic volume and assigned over service volume in Metropolitan Muncie picture the present situation well on several roads but also not so well on the other roads. The B-A-A projections of Level of Service (L. O. S.) are very close with the present situation. Department of Urban PlanningThesis (M. U. R. P. ...|$|E
40|$|The trip {{timing and}} mode choice are two {{critical}} decisions of individual commuters mostly define peak period traffic congestion in urban areas. Due {{to the increasing}} evidence in many North American cities that {{the duration of the}} congested peak travelling periods is expanding (peak spreading), it becomes necessary and natural to investigate these two commuting decisions jointly. In addition to being considered jointly with mode <b>choice</b> decisions, <b>trip</b> timing must also be modelled as a continuous variable in order to precisely capture peak spreading trends in a policy sensitive transportation demand model. However, in the literature to date, these two fundamental decisions have largely been treated separately or in some cases as integrated discrete decisions for joint investigation. In this paper, a discrete-continuous econometric model is used to investigate the joint decisions of trip timing and mode <b>choice</b> for commuting <b>trips</b> in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA). The joint model, with a multinomial logit model for mode choice and a continuous time hazard model for trip timing, allows for unrestricted correlation between the unobserved factors influencing these two decisions. Models are estimated by occupation groups using 2001 travel survey data for the GTA. Across all occupation groups, strong correlations between unobserved factors influencing mode <b>choice</b> and <b>trip</b> timing are found.

40|$|AbstractThe primary {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to understand the effects of the low-carbon constraints on the route and mode <b>choices</b> of <b>trip</b> makers, and their impacts on the performance of a transportation network which is composed of buses and private cars. A combined mode split/traffic assignment model that considered the low-carbon constraints was proposed. The low-carbon constraints considered both the system CO 2 reduction constraint and the link CO environmental traffic capacity constraint. The effects of low-carbon constraints were estimated using the equilibrium solution of the proposed combined mode split/traffic assignment model, which was obtained using the generalized lagrangian multiplier solution method. The proposed model was tested in two hypothetical test networks. It was found that by changing the route and mode <b>choices</b> of <b>trip</b> makers the network equilibrium results under the low-carbon constraints can be achieved. Both system travel time and carbon emissions of the congested network can be reduced when low-carbon constraints were used. However, for the non-congested network, the use of low-carbon constraints will increase the system travel time. The proposed model can be directly used by transportation decision makers to evaluate the effects of various policies that focus on limiting low-carbon emissions on the overall performance of the road network...|$|R

This dissertation presents two case studies: Metropolitan Boston and Hong Kong. Taking a disaggregate approach, the empirical analysis builds on the economic choice theory and focuses on three aspects of travel behavior: mode <b>choice,</b> <b>trip</b> frequency and automobile dependence. Logit models of mode choice and trip frequency are estimated to examine the importance and magnitude of land use affecting travel when travel costs and socio-demographic factors are controlled for. (cont.) The effects of densification and pricing on mode choice are extrapolated with incremental logit modeling while controlling for the impacts of these policies on individual accessibility, i. e., the utility associated with all available modes. Logit captivity models are estimated to quantify and explain automobile dependence {{in the process of}} choice set generation. The analysis shows that densification has significant influence on mode choice and automobile dependence due to the differentiated impacts of land use on modal supply. The influence of street patterns on travel is not much from the geometric difference between gridiron and cul-de-sac, but from the viability of the circulation systems for alternatives to driving. Automobile dependence in the Boston area displays certain patterns in the spatial, social and activity dimensions. The sources of automobile dependence are diverse, often lying beyond the physical environment. The Hong Kong case demonstrates that the presence of economic measures is a precondition for land use to be an effective mobility tool. Hong Kong's non-driving-dominated travel does not come by default from its unique land use pattern, but is accompanied by strong fiscal and regulatory constraints to private transportation. by Ming Zhang.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a first approach to dynamic frequency-based transit assignment. As such the model aims {{to close the}} gap between schedule-based and frequency-based models. Frequency-based approaches have some advantages compared to schedule-based models, however, when modelling highly congested networks a static frequency-based approach is not sufficient as it does not reveal the peaked nature of the capacity problem. The central idea for dealing with the line capacity constraints is the introduction of a "fail-to-board" probability as in some circumstances passengers are not able to board the first service arriving due to overcrowding. The common line problem is taken into account and the search for the shortest hyperpath is influenced by the fail-to-board probability. An assumption that passengers mingle on the platform allows a Markov network loading process which respects the priority of on-board passengers with respect to those wishing to board. The study period is divided into several time intervals and those passengers who failed to board are added to the demand in the subsequent time interval and so might reconsider their route <b>choice.</b> <b>Trips</b> that are longer than one interval are also carried over to subsequent time intervals. The approach is first illustrated with a small example network and then with a case study relating to London, where transit capacity problems are experienced daily during the peak period. ...|$|R

The proposed model extends classical time allocation models while considering departure/arrival time choices and relaxes the constant marginal utility assumption to derive an analytical model for VOTT {{as well as to}} investigate the theoretical relationship between VOTT, departure/arrival time choice, income, and travel time. Using the traveler survey data collected to evaluate the NJTPK time-of-day pricing program, VOTT functions are estimated for different departure time <b>choices</b> and for <b>trip</b> purposes. The main contribution of the empirical results presented in this study is that in the presence of time-of-day pricing applications, when the main choice of commuters is departure time rather than alternative routes and/or modes, VOTT is influenced from the departure time, trip purpose, desired arrival time, and deviation from the desired arrival time in addition to the travel time, toll, and income parameters. Mean VOTT values are found to range between $ 15 Â per hour and $ 20 Â h- 1, depending on departure time <b>choice</b> and <b>trip</b> purpose. This result indicates relatively high VOTT values, explaining the low level of response to the minor toll differentials introduced by the NJTPK Authority. ...|$|R

However our understanding of factors influencing their mode choice is still limited. In this research {{the focus is on}} mode <b>choice</b> for shopping <b>trips</b> as these are the most frequent trips of older people. The study is not limited to trips to the shopping centre, but investigates the combined mode <b>choice</b> of <b>trips</b> to and from the shop in order to understand also which factors influence mode changes. Two types of models - the multinomial logit (MNL) and the nested logit (NL) - are fitted to data from the London Area Travel Survey. The nesting structure is used to test the correlation in mode choice before and after shopping. A particular focus of the models is on the importance of accessibility variables such as bus and rail stop density and service quality for specific areas of London. The results show that mode choice combinations such as “walk to shop and take the bus back” are not as frequent as sometimes thought and that bus stop density is of more significance to older people than attributes describing the quality of the bus services like service frequency...|$|R
40|$|Whilst {{traditional}} {{modeling and}} research efforts put {{emphasis on the}} effect of congestion on travel choices, recently more and more studies examine the notion of travel time uncertainty on travel decision. In particular, travel time reliability forms an important component in modeling route <b>choice</b> and <b>trip</b> scheduling. This paper considers equilibrium trip scheduling under random travel delay in a single bottleneck. Travelers form a heterogeneous population with distinctive requirements on the probability of punctual arrival and each with a different valuation toward earliness and lateness. The analysis shows that random delay plays a significant role in travel costs and introduces substantial differences in the queuing pattern, departure and arrival times, as compared with the traditional deterministic model...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Incompatibilities between urban {{transport}} {{and land use}} are rapidly growing in developing countries. Due to this mismatch, vehicle ownership is increasing dreadfully causing urban areas for various problems including congestion and air pollution. This study attempts to investigate the household travel behaviour on vehicle ownership, mode <b>choice</b> and <b>trip</b> sharing aspects by developing a nested logit (NL) model as a basic step of the analysis. Then, the estimated NL model is used for integrated policy assessments based on relocation of residences, road pricing, and reduction of transit fares. The policy impacts are presented as the reductions of vehicle kilometres of travel and air pollution considering Bangkok Metropolitan Region as a case study. 1...|$|R
