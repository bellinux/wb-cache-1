25|$|The Operations Integrated Emergency Management {{service is}} {{responsible}} for ensuring that the force is ready to respond to major incidents, that business continuity plans are in place and that the force's duty under the Civil Contingencies Act 2004 is satisfied. This work includes running exercises and drills to test readiness and working closely with other emergency services and local authorities. As part of the service's work, the force also maintains a number of <b>Casualty</b> <b>Bureau</b> facilities at which calls from the public are taken and collated following a major incident such as a plane crash or terrorist attack.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{important}} use of HOLMES 2 lies {{in disaster}} management. The {{reason for this}} {{can be seen in the}} similarities that exist between the investigation of a major incident and a major disaster. In case of a disaster, HOLMES 2 collaborates with the facilities for disaster management via the <b>Casualty</b> <b>Bureau.</b> The additional functions required for <b>Casualty</b> <b>Bureau</b> operations, like recording Interpol data and specific action management facilities, are fully integrated into the HOLMES 2. HOLMES 2 also provides the ability to pool resources in order to handle more effectively the initial peak load of missing person calls from the public.|$|E
50|$|HOLMES {{was also}} used to support the Police UK <b>Casualty</b> <b>Bureau</b> {{providing}} facilities to record reported missing persons, casualties, survivors and evacuees. The application provides matching facilities to aid the reconciliation of missing persons with {{those involved in the}} incident.|$|E
5000|$|Mass {{casualty}} events generate numerous {{calls to}} government agencies: for example, the 2005 London subway bombing generated some 42,000 {{calls to the}} UK. <b>Casualty</b> <b>Bureau</b> call centers within the Bureau's first hour of operation. [...] The Call Center module can handle {{tens of thousands of}} calls from individuals reporting or enquiring about missing persons, and record basic information about both the missing person and the caller.|$|E

50|$|When the Royal Air Force left Hendon in the 1960s, the Metropolitan Police {{decided to}} rebuild the college, and the new Peel Centre, named after Sir Robert Peel, was opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 31 May 1974, forty {{years to the day}} after her uncle opened the {{original}} Metropolitan Police College. The Queen has returned twice since then, on the 21 October 2001 when she dedicated the memorial to Metropolitan Police officers and staff who have lost their lives on duty, and on 3 January 2005 when she went to visit the <b>Casualty</b> <b>Bureau</b> dealing with British nationals missing after the Asian tsunami.|$|E

50|$|Led by DAC Ron McPherson and Dr Amanat Hussain, the C3i {{programme}} (Communication, Command, Control & Information) was {{the largest}} police transformation programme undertaken in the UK.
