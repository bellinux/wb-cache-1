5|$|On 3 August 2009, {{shortly after}} the death of former President <b>Corazon</b> Aquino, widow of Benigno Aquino, Jr., {{legislative}} measures have been filed calling for her official recognition as a national hero. Congresswoman Liwayway Vinzons-Chato filed a house resolution declaring <b>Corazon</b> Aquino a national hero. Although, a week after she filed the resolution, she realized that there is no Filipino historical figure declared through law. On 10 August 2009, she cited on her privilege speech in Congress the nine Filipino heroes recommended by National Heroes Committee in 1995. She then urge Congress to sign the resolutions declaring the nine Filipinos recommended by the National Heroes Committee plus Benigno Aquino, Jr. and <b>Corazon</b> Aquino as national heroes. Congressman Salvador Escudero interpellated Vinzons-Chato's speech and stated that heroes are made in {{the hearts and minds of}} people and not through legislation. After the interpellation, it was moved by House of Representatives to refer the privilege speech of Vinzons-Chato to the Committee of Basic Education and Culture.|$|E
5|$|In August 2009, a {{bill has}} been filed calling for <b>Corazon</b> Aquino's {{official}} {{recognition as a}} national hero. In 2003, Benigno Aquino Jr., was already officially declared {{as one of the}} national heroes by then President Gloria Arroyo through an executive order.|$|E
5|$|Badajoz's oldest two cemeteries are Cementerio de San Juan and Cementerio de Nuestra Señora de la Soledad. The cemeteries {{in active}} use are the Cementerio de San Juan, Cementerio Virgen de las Nieves de Balboa, Cementerio de la Inmaculada Concepción de Gévora, Cementerio San Isidro de Novelda, Cementerio Inmaculado <b>Corazón</b> de María de Valdebótoa and Cementerio Santiago Apóstol de Villafranco.|$|E
5|$|Belgrano {{also met}} María Dolores Helguero in Tucumán, and briefly {{considered}} getting married, {{but the war}} forced a postponement. María Dolores married another man; the relationship ended, but was briefly restarted in 1818. While he was near the frontiers of Córdoba, Santa Fe, and Buenos Aires, and in a delicate state of health, he learned that María Dolores {{had given birth to}} his daughter, Manuela Mónica del Sagrado <b>Corazón,</b> who was born on 4 May 1819.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} storm had {{weakened}} drastically by this time, Tess killed 37people in Vietnam, destroyed thousands of homes, and inflicted $11million in damage. Following Tess, Philippine President <b>Corazon</b> Aquino visited the provinces of Pangasinan and Pampanga, both situated {{to the north of}} Manila to tour damaged areas, distribute relief, aid and inaugurate an infrastructure project. A mere few days after Tess, Typhoon Skip became the third cyclone to hit the archipelago in two weeks.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the success}} of the People Power Revolution and the {{installation}} to the presidency of <b>Corazon</b> Aquino, Ople was relieved of his Cabinet post. Ople returned to the Philippines and immediately attempted to position himself {{as the leader of the}} political opposition against Aquino. Nonetheless in May 1986, Ople accepted an offer by President Aquino to serve in the Constitutional Commission that drafted a new Philippine Constitution.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, she {{starred in}} the Spanish {{production}} El <b>Corazón</b> de la tierra, or The Heart of the Earth, {{and later in the}} year finished filming the horror/thriller Victims and the fantasy novel adaptation Inkheart. In Inkheart, she plays Resa, the wife of Brendan Fraser's character and the mother of Eliza Bennett's. Guillory acted alongside Helen Mirren, a friend of the Guillory family who was a role model when she first had aspirations towards acting.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 2013, Barea started dating actress and Miss Universe Puerto Rico 2011 Viviana Ortiz. In February 2016, they {{confirmed}} that they were expecting their first child. Their daughter Paulina Barea Ortiz was born in March 31, 2016. Barea and Ortiz got married on August 20, 2016 in a lavish ceremony at {{the church of the}} Universidad del Sagrado <b>Corazón</b> in San Juan, Puerto Rico.|$|E
5|$|Manuel José Joaquín del <b>Corazón</b> de Jesús Belgrano (3 June 1770 – 20 June 1820), usually {{referred}} to as Manuel Belgrano, was an Argentine economist, lawyer, politician, and military leader. He {{took part in the}} Argentine Wars of Independence and created the Flag of Argentina. He is {{regarded as one of the}} main Libertadores of the country.|$|E
5|$|On August 21, 1983, Marcos' chief rival, {{opposition}} leader Benigno Aquino, Jr., was assassinated {{on the tarmac}} at Manila International Airport. Marcos eventually called snap presidential elections in 1986. Marcos was proclaimed the winner, but the results were widely regarded as fraudulent, leading to the People Power Revolution. Marcos and his allies fled to Hawaii and Aquino's widow, <b>Corazon</b> Aquino was recognized as president.|$|E
5|$|On December 4, 1993, <b>Corazón</b> de León won the NWA World Middleweight Championship on a CMLL {{show and}} then took the title {{with him when he}} began working in Japan. On November 8, 1994, Último Dragón won the {{championship}} and for the next 10 years the title was promoted primarily in Japan. On September 3, 2004, Averno defeated Zumbido to win the vacant championship, bringing it back under CMLL's control.|$|E
5|$|Several of {{his stories}} have {{inspired}} other writers and directors. In 1987, the Italian director Francesco Rosi directed the movie Cronaca di una morte annunciata based on Chronicle of a Death Foretold. Several film adaptations {{have been made in}} Mexico, including Miguel Littin's La Viuda de Montiel (1979), Jaime Humberto Hermosillo's Maria de mi <b>corazón</b> (1979), and Arturo Ripstein's El coronel no tiene quien le escriba (1998).|$|E
5|$|Some of the awarded albums {{have also}} earned the Grammy Award, such as No Es Lo Mismo and Paraíso Express, {{recorded}} by Sanz, La Vida... Es un Ratico by Juanes and Vida by Draco Rosa, for Best Latin Pop Album; La Llave de Mi <b>Corazón</b> by Guerra, for Best Traditional Tropical Latin Album; Fijación Oral Vol. 1 by Shakira, for Best Latin Rock/Alternative Album; and Los de Atrás Vienen Conmigo by Calle 13 for Best Latin Urban Album.|$|E
5|$|The {{assassination}} of opposition leader Benigno Aquino Jr. in 1983 caused mass protests that {{eventually led to}} the People Power Revolution. The Marcos family were forced into exile, and Aquino's widow <b>Corazon</b> was installed as president. After the death of her husband Ferdinand, Marcos returned to the Philippines and was later elected four times to the House of Representatives as a congresswoman for Leyte in 1995 and for Ilocos Norte in 2010, 2013 and 2016.|$|E
5|$|Three {{other former}} Jesuit missions– San Juan Bautista (now in ruins), Santo <b>Corazón</b> and Santiago de Chiquitos– {{which have not}} been named UNESCO {{heritage}} sites – lie east of San José de Chiquitos {{not far from the}} town of Roboré. The capital of José Miguel de Velasco Province, San Ignacio de Velasco was founded as a Jesuit mission but also is not a World Heritage Site as the current church is a reconstruction, not a restoration.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the country, 90 {{fatalities}} {{resulted from}} the typhoon. Additionally, 386 people were injured while another 3 were listed as missing. A total of 8,845 homes were destroyed and another 46,269 sustained damage. An estimated 120,000 people were left homeless due to Gordon. Losses from the typhoon amounted to 1.36billion pesos ($62million USD). By July18, relief operations began across northern Luzon. Philippine President <b>Corazon</b> Aquino {{declared a state of}} calamity for five provinces and three towns by this time.|$|E
5|$|Nine {{deaths were}} {{attributed}} to Bertha, including six crew members of the Greek freighter <b>Corazon</b> who perished off the Canadian coast after their ship broke up. Another fatality was caused when one person fell off the ship Patricia Star and into the Atlantic; the other two deaths were from two people drowning in north Florida. Damage to crops and a suspension bridge were reported from Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island; this damage totaled to $4.427million (1990CAD; $3.912million 1990USD, $ USD).|$|E
5|$|On November2, {{following}} an investigation, President <b>Corazon</b> Aquino ordered Sulpicio Lines temporarily closed {{while the government}} was asked to inspect the company's crews and ships. Company officials felt that the indefinite closing was unfair and argued it would disrupt shipping across the island nation, and that the inspection can take place without shutting the entire company down. Typhoon Ruby {{was the first of}} three tropical cyclones to affect the island chain in a span of a mere two weeks; Ruby was followed by Tropical Storm Tess and Typhoon Skip in early November1988.|$|E
5|$|The MFR {{serves as}} an outdoor {{laboratory}} to students, primarily of the College of Forestry and Natural Resources. ₱5million (US$156,000) was designated for its conservation and development in 2011. The MFR was created in 1910 under the Bureau of Forestry. Jurisdiction over MFR was transferred to UP in 1960. The National Power Corporation acquired complete jurisdiction of the MFR in 1987 {{as part of the}} Philippines' energy development program under President <b>Corazon</b> Aquino. The MFR was returned to UPLB three years later under the terms of Republic Act 6967.|$|E
5|$|The {{return of}} {{democracy}} and government reforms beginning in 1986 were hampered by national debt, government corruption, coup attempts, disasters, a persistent communist insurgency, and a military conflict with Moro separatists. During <b>Corazon</b> Aquino's administration, U.S. forces withdrew from the Philippines, due to {{the rejection of the}} U.S. Bases Extension Treaty, and leading to the official transfer of Clark Air Base in November 1991 and Subic Bay to the government in December 1992. The administration also faced a series of natural disasters, including the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in June 1991. After introducing a constitution that limited presidents to a single term, Aquino did not stand for re-election.|$|E
5|$|There are urban legends that persist to {{the present}} {{concerning}} Luna diverting millions of pesos from the Republic's treasury, particularly from Ilocos and Pampanga, to the hometown of his alleged sweetheart, Ysidra Cojuangco. Ysidra was the aunt of Jose Cojuangco, father of <b>Corazon</b> Aquino. Luna's wealth was rumored to have been entrusted to Ysidra, resulting in the latter {{becoming one of the}} richest women in the Philippines by 1900. However, there were no recorded comments or printed insinuations of Luna's financial impropriety from anti-Luna figures of the Aguinaldo government during and immediately after the Philippine–American War.|$|E
5|$|A {{third period}} of mission {{foundations}} began in 1748 {{with the establishment}} of San Ignacio de Velasco, which was not declared a part of the World Heritage Site. The church is nonetheless a largely faithful 20th-century reconstruction – as opposed to renovation (a key criterion for inclusion in the World Heritage Site group) – of the second Jesuit templo built in 1761. In 1754 the Jesuits founded the mission of Santiago de Chiquitos. This church also is a reconstruction, dating from the early 20th century and likewise {{is not part of the}} World Heritage Site group. In 1755 the mission of Santa Ana de Velasco was founded by the Jesuit Julian Knogler; it is the most authentic of the six World Heritage Site missions dating from the colonial period. The last mission in the Chiquitania to be established was founded by the Jesuits Fr. Antonio Gaspar and Fr. José Chueca as Santo <b>Corazón</b> in 1760. However, nothing of the original settlement remains in the modern village.|$|E
5|$|Low on {{funds for}} an {{upcoming}} competition trip, glee club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) suggests that the club members sell saltwater taffy to raise money. New Directions members Mike Chang (Harry Shum, Jr.), Artie Abrams (Kevin McHale) and Tina Cohen-Chang (Jenna Ushkowitz) reveal {{they are on the}} academic decathlon team, which is also having funding problems. Brittany Pierce (Heather Morris) is the fourth, stand-in member, and proves surprisingly knowledgeable about cat diseases. Will's girlfriend, substitute teacher Holly Holliday (Gwyneth Paltrow), suggests holding a benefit concert for the decathlon team instead of selling additional taffy. Former McKinley student Sunshine <b>Corazon</b> (Charice), who defected to rival glee club Vocal Adrenaline, is awarded the closing number at the concert after promising to bring her six hundred Twitter followers.|$|E
5|$|Marcos {{was allowed}} to return to the Philippines by <b>Corazon</b> Aquino on 4 November 1991. The {{following}} year, she ran for president in the presidential elections on 11 May 1992, finishing 5th out of 7 candidates. On 8 May 1995, she was elected as a congresswoman of Leyte, representing the first district, despite facing a disqualification lawsuit in which the Supreme Court ruled in her favor. She sought the presidency again on 11 May 1998, but later withdrew to support the eventual winner Joseph Estrada and she finished 9th among 11 candidates. In November 2006, she started her own business, a fashion label that included designing jewelry. In March 2008, she was acquitted of charges of having illegally taken money from the country by the Manila Regional Trial Court due to reasonable doubt.|$|E
5|$|She {{attended}} {{primary school}} at the Sagrado <b>Corazón</b> de Jesús (Sacred Heart of Jesus) school in Rivas and the French school in Granada. Barrios began her secondary education at the Colegio La Inmaculada in Managua and then transferred to an American boarding school, as her parents wanted her to perfect her English. She first attended Our Lady of the Lake Catholic High School for Girls in San Antonio, Texas, and then in 1945 changed to Blackstone College for Girls in Virginia. In June 1947, her father was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer and though he died before she could make it home, she returned to Nicaragua, without graduating in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Six of the {{reductions}} were listed {{as part of}} the World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1990. The churches of San Ignacio de Velasco, Santiago de Chiquitos and Santo <b>Corazón</b> have been reconstructed from scratch and {{are not part of the}} World Heritage Site. In San Juan Bautista only ruins remain. UNESCO listed the site under criteria IV and V, acknowledging the adaption of Christian religious architecture to the local environment and the unique architecture expressed in the wooden columns and banisters. Recently ICOMOS, the International Council on Monuments and Sites, warned that the traditional architectural ensemble that makes up the site has become vulnerable following agrarian reforms from 1953 which threatened the fragile socioeconomic infrastructure of the region. At the time of the nomination, the World Heritage Site was protected by the Pro Santa Cruz committee, Cordecruz, Plan Regulador de Santa Cruz, and the local mayoral offices of the mission towns.|$|E
5|$|The MFR {{serves as}} an outdoor {{laboratory}} to students, primarily of the College of Forestry and Natural Resources. ₱5million (US$156,000) was designated for its conservation and development in 2011. The MFR was created in 1910 under the Bureau of Forestry. Jurisdiction over the MFR {{was transferred to the}} UP in 1960. NAPOCOR acquired complete jurisdiction of the MFR, however, in 1987 as part of the Philippines' energy development program under President <b>Corazon</b> Aquino. The MFR was returned to UPLB three years later by effect of RA 6967. In 2008 representative Del De Guzman of the 2nd district of Makati filed HB 1143 which, if passed into law, would have transferred jurisdiction of the MFR to the Boy Scouts of the Philippines. The bill was strongly opposed by the UPLB, citing possible mismanagement and deforestation of the site if placed under the BSP among others.|$|E
5|$|There were twenty-two number-onealbums in 2007, {{including}} tworeleases by Mexican band RBD: Celestial and Empezar Desde Cero. Celestial, {{the last}} number-one album of 2006, spent fiveweeks at number one and sold 498,000units; this album became the best-selling Latin album of 2007. Empezar Desde Cero debuted {{at the top}} of the chart and sold 102,000 units. Vencedor, the last recording by Mexican performer Valentín Elizalde, who was killed at the age of 27 on November 25, 2006 in the city of Reynosa, Tamaulipas, spent three non-consecutive weeks {{at the top of}} the chart. La Llave de Mi <b>Corazón</b> by Dominican singer-songwriter Juan Luis Guerra spent one week at number one and won fiveLatin Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year and the Grammy Award for Best Tropical Latin Album. The greatest hits collection Historia de un Idolo by Vicente Fernández became the first album to peak at number one in 2001 and 2007.|$|E
5|$|Initially, it {{took more}} than 24hours for word of the level of devastation to reach {{officials}} in Manila as communications across Leyte were largely destroyed. By November7, search and rescue operations were underway across Leyte and Negros Occidental. The first shipment of relief supplies, consisting of food rations, rice, sardines, and used clothing, was to be shipped from Cebu later that day. On November8, Philippine President <b>Corazon</b> Aquino declared all of Leyte a disaster area. A Philippine Navy vessel set out with heavy earth-moving machinery and the Philippine Air Force deployed aircraft to assist in rescue efforts. Relief efforts in Ormoc City were hampered by a lack of clear roads and fuel. Amateur radio reports stated that an AC-130 was able to land at a local airport but materials had to be moved by helicopter from there since roads were blocked. Relief efforts were also hampered by continuing rains and the rough terrain of the affected region. By November11, approximately 8,300families had been rescued and another 7,521were evacuated from affected regions.|$|E
5|$|Some Jesuit {{institutions}} {{still exist}} in the Chiquitania. For example, the towns of San Rafael de Velasco, San Miguel de Velasco, Santa Ana de Velasco and San Ignacio de Velasco have functioning town councils (cabildos), and the caciques and the sexton still retain their capacities. The {{majority of the population}} of the Chiquitania is staunchly Catholic; the Chiquitano cosmovision is now only a dimly understood mythology for its inhabitants. Between 1992 and 2009, the populations of San Xavier and especially Concepción tripled, and more than doubled in San Ignacio de Velasco, now the region’s fastest-growing municipality. In other mission towns the population also increased, albeit on a smaller scale. As of 2011, San José de Chiquitos, San Xavier and Concepción have around 10,000inhabitants each; and San Ignacio de Velasco, the largest town in the Chiquitania, has about 35,000 and is now boasts a campus of a national university. On the other hand, in Santa Ana de Velasco there are currently only a few hundred people. The remoter settlements of Santiago de Chiquitos and Santo <b>Corazón</b> are quite small as well. According to various sources, in Bolivia the number of ethnic Chiquitanos is between 30,000 and 47,000 of which less than 6,000– mainly elderly people– still speak the original language. Only a few hundred are monolingual in the Chiquitano language.|$|E
5|$|The Jesuits in the Chiquitania had a {{secondary}} objective, {{which was to}} secure a more direct route to Asunción than the road then being used via Tucumán and Tarija to link the Chiquitania with the Jesuit missions in Paraguay. The missionaries in Chiquitos founded their settlements increasingly further east, towards the Paraguay River, while those south of Asunción {{moved closer to the}} Paraguay River by establishing their missions increasingly farther north, thereby avoiding the impassable Chaco region. Although Ñuflo de Chávez had attempted a route through the Chaco on an expedition as early as 1564, subsequent Jesuit explorations from Chiquitos (e.g. in 1690, 1702, 1703, and 1705) were unsuccessful. The Jesuits were stopped by the hostile Payaguá and Guaycuru tribes, and by the impenetrable swamps of Jarayes. In 1715, de Arce, the co-founder of the first mission in San Xavier, set out from Asunción on the Paraguay River with the Flemish priest Fr. Bartolomé Blende. Payaguá warriors killed Blende during the journey, but de Arce struggled on to reach San Rafael de Velasco in the Chiquitania. On the return trip to Asunción he too was killed in Paraguay. Not until 1767, when the missions had encroached sufficiently on the hostile region and just before the Jesuits were expelled from the New World, did Fr. José Sánchez Labrador manage to travel from Belén in Paraguay to Santo <b>Corazón,</b> the easternmost Chiquitos mission.|$|E
