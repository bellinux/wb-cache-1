25|$|Outdooring ceremonies {{can vary}} in {{practice}} {{among the different}} Ghanaian ethnic groups. The Ga place drops of water and alcohol onto the child's tongue to symbolize teaching them the difference between good and evil, and they may also place a piece of food such as kenkey so the child will appreciate a staple food of the Ga. Some groups practice raising the baby toward the sky three times to introduce them to heaven and Earth. Libations are also poured and live sacrifices of chickens or goats are made to ensure good health and protect the child from evil. The father or an elder will call out the child's name for the guests to repeat aloud to formally welcome the <b>child</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> community. After the naming concludes, friends and relatives give gifts to the family, and feasting and dancing follows.|$|E
25|$|On October 17, 2008, Zach is in {{the process}} of looking for Kendall buried under rubble due to a tornado having just struck Pine Valley. He finds Bianca instead, and is {{surprised}} to see that she is pregnant. He later finds an unconscious Kendall. As an ambulance arrives for her, it is stated that there is not enough room for Bianca and Zach to ride along to the hospital. There is, however, enough room for Zach and Kendall's children to ride in the front seat of the ambulance. Zach and Bianca stay behind and discuss Kendall's fate. They also discuss Bianca's secret that she is pregnant with Zach's child via sperm donation, and Bianca's new lover named Reese. Zach had agreed to father Bianca's child for the couple, but did not know that she had gone through with the procedure of artificial insemination, until now. The two wonder how Kendall, who is unaware of this pregnancy, will react to the news when they tell her. As Zach and Bianca continue to talk, Bianca goes into labor. Zach helps deliver the new <b>child</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> world.|$|E

500|$|Writer Brian K. Vaughan {{conceived}} Saga in his childhood, {{calling it}} [...] "a fictional universe that I created when I was bored in math class. I just kept building it." [...] He {{was inspired by}} such influences as Star Wars, Flash Gordon and children's books, and has also invoked the awe and wonder of first seeing the Silver Surfer, which seemed an [...] "incredible and different" [...] concept to him. It was not until his wife became pregnant with his second daughter, however, that he conceived of the protagonists, the winged Alana and the horned Marko, two lovers from warring extraterrestrial races who struggle to survive with their newborn daughter, Hazel, who occasionally narrates the series. It was also {{at this point that}} the central theme that Vaughan wanted for the book emerged. Vaughan explains, [...] "I wanted to write about parenthood, but I wanted to Trojan-horse it inside some sort of interesting genre story, to explore the overlap between artistic creation {{and the creation of a}} child." [...] Vaughan, who intended to return to writing a comics series following the 2010 conclusion of his previous series, Ex Machina, and who notes that the publication of Saga #1 coincided with the birth of his daughter, saw parallels between the caution advised by colleagues against launching a new book in the poor economy and those who cautioned against bringing a new <b>child</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> world, observing: ...|$|E

It's kind of bratty, especially with me, my mom is German and Mozart is Austrian and in Germany it's like messing with the Pope or something." ...|$|E

2500|$|Proponents of childfreedom posit that {{choosing}} not to {{have children}} is no more or less selfish than choosing to have children. Choosing to have children may be the more selfish choice, especially when poor parenting risks creating many long term problems for both the children themselves and society at large. As philosopher David Benatar explains, {{at the heart of}} the decision to bring a <b>child</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> world often lies the parents' own desires (to enjoy child-rearing or perpetuate one's legacy/genes), rather than the potential person's interests. [...] At very least, Benatar believes this illustrates why a childfree person may be just as altruistic as any parent.|$|E

The Gypsies break camp while Azucena confesses to Manrico that after stealing the di Luna baby she had intended to burn the count's little son along with her mother, but overwhelmed by the screams and the gruesome scene of her mother's execution, she became confused and threw her own <b>child</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> flames instead (Aria: Condotta ell'era in ceppi / [...] "They dragged her in bonds").|$|E

2500|$|At {{approximately}} 4:10p.m., a Mexican couple, Astolfo and Maricela Felix, drove {{toward one}} of the service areas of the restaurant. Noting the shattered glass, Astolfo initially thought renovation work was in progress and that Huberty—striding toward the car—was a repairman. Huberty fired his shotgun and Uzi at the couple and their 4-month-old daughter, Karlita, striking Maricela in the face, arms and chest, blinding her in one eye and permanently rendering one hand unusable. Her baby was critically wounded in the neck, chest and abdomen. Astolfo was wounded in the chest and head. As Astolfo and Maricela staggered away from Huberty's line of fire, Maricela put her shrieking <b>child</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> arms of a fleeing woman and shouted in Spanish, [...] "Please save my baby", before slumping against a parked car. The woman rushed the baby to a nearby hospital as her husband assisted Astolfo and Maricela into a nearby building. All three members of the Felix family survived.|$|E
2500|$|To {{demonstrate}} this point, Popper gave {{two cases}} {{of human behavior}} and typical explanations from Sigmund Freud and Alfred Adler's theories: [...] "that {{of a man who}} pushes a <b>child</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> water with the intention of drowning it; and that of a man who sacrifices his life in an attempt to save the child." [...] From Freud's perspective, the first man would have suffered from psychological repression, probably originating from an Oedipus complex, whereas the second had attained sublimation. From Adler's perspective, the first and second man suffered from feelings of inferiority and had to prove himself which drove him to commit the crime or, in the second case, rescue the child. Popper was not able to find any counterexamples of human behavior in which the behavior could not be explained in the terms of Adler's or Freud's theory. Popper argued it was that the observation always fitted or confirmed the theory which, rather than being its strength, was actually its weakness.|$|E
