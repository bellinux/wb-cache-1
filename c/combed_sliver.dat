50|$|The {{rectilinear}} comb uses a circular comb {{mounted on a}} drum to comb out the fringe and remove short fiber (set by a scale so fibers less than, for example, 25 mm are removed) not held by a clamping mechanism. The row of pins known as a top comb is a very fine tooth comb, for example 25 teeth per inch; it is inserted in cylindrical combed fringe {{to act as an}} impediment to contaminates (burr, seed etc.) flow. The top comb acts as an impediment to contamination moving into a <b>combed</b> <b>sliver.</b> On a next circular combing short finer and contaminates are removed. The circular combing without short fibers are placed on a moving belt in an overlapping motion. The circular combing and top comb insertion is repeated and combed fibers - now called tuft are overlapped. The overlapping produces some cohesion allowing the tuft then to be twisted to form a <b>combed</b> <b>sliver.</b> This sliver is weak and unsuitable for spinning. To allow spinning to take place additional gilling is required to introduce fiber end irregularity (Sokolov 1994).|$|E
40|$|It will be {{seen that}} {{irrespective}} {{of the type of}} feed, the precentage of hooked fibers in the outcoming sliver is fairly high, and varies only between the narrow limits 66 - 74. Further, in every case the trailing hooks are in the majority as in normally processed sliver. It should be particularly noted that there is hardly any difference between slivers B and C with regpect to the percentages of trailing and leading hooks, in spite of large differences in the percentages of such hooks fed to the card. Also, the percentages of trailing hooks in sliver B and of leading hooks in sliver C are less than those in the feed. It is clear, therefore, that the card more or less obliterates the fiber arrangement in the feed and gives it a treatment which results in a fairly constant percentage of hooked fibers in the sliver. From an examination of slivers D and E one might conclude that with combed feed the percentage of trail-ing hooks is significantly reduced while that of leading hooks is increased, but this conclusion is not borne out by the fiber arrangement of sliver F which is also from a combed feed. The combing ratio of the different slivers indicates that while there is hardly any difference in the fiber disorder of slivers prepared from blow room lap or from card slivers, the general fiber disorder is sig-nificantly less in slivers D, E, and F, which were pre-pared from <b>combed</b> <b>sliver.</b> The lower combing ratio of these slivers may be ascribed to greater fiber extent and better alignment of fibers arising out of the combed feed with its straightened and well separated fibers. The smaller percentage of short fibers in slivers D, E, and F, as compared to slivers A, B and C, would also be. partly responsible for lowering the value of the combing ratio in the former set of slivers.

25|$|The <b>combed</b> <b>slivers</b> {{produced}} on {{any type of}} combing machine are passed through {{a process known as}} finishing. This process takes place in a series of gill boxes in which the fibres are redistributed, the slivers made uniform in thickness and moisture added in order to give the wool its natural suppleness and condition. Blending is done where necessary to keep the top up to a given standard of quality and, if dyed, consistency of colour. The top ball produced is suitable for packing for transport and unwinding. The top represents the wool comber's finished product, and it is in this form that the wool is bought and sold as the spinner's raw material.|$|R
50|$|In short draw spinning, spun from <b>combed</b> roving, <b>sliver</b> or wool top, the spinners {{keep their}} hands {{very close to}} each other. The fibres are held fanned out in one hand while the other hand pulls a small number from the mass. The twist is kept between the second hand and the wheel â€” there is never any twist between the two hands.|$|R
25|$|Short draw {{spinning}} is used {{to create}} worsted yarns. It is spun from <b>combed</b> roving, <b>sliver</b> or wool top. The spinner keeps his/her hands very close to each other.

5000|$|Short draw is the {{spinning}} technique {{used to create}} worsted yarns. It is spun from <b>combed</b> roving, <b>sliver</b> or wool top - anything with the fibers all lined up parallel to the yarn. It is generally spun from long stapled fibers. Short draw spun yarns are smooth, strong, sturdy yarns, and dense. [...] Short draw spun yarns also tend to not be very elastic. These characteristics make them good for use in weaving.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{properties}} of plain fiber assembly are discussed, and the fiber alignment {{in the assembly}} is investigated. Some theories in yarn irregularity research are applied {{to the study of}} the random and parallel fibers in fiber assembly and a stochastic method is used to generate the fiber assembly. For a given fiber length distribution, the combing process is simulated on the basis of the plain fiber assembly. If the main parameters in cotton combing are known, the simulation can be conducted, yielding the fiber length distributions in <b>combed</b> cotton <b>slivers</b> and in waste cotton that is combed down. With the variation of combing parameters, the influence of combing parameters on the combing results can be discussed from the simulation...|$|R
25|$|In the French <b>comb</b> the <b>slivers</b> of wool are fed {{forward by}} ratchet-operated rollers and a pinned feed grid, the leading {{end of the}} fibres being pushed beyond the nipper jaws which open and shut to receive and hold them, leaving a fringe of fibres {{protruding}} through which the pins of the revolving cylinder comb pass, removing the short fibres or noil and any impurities. These are carried round to the underside and deposited in a box for removal. Whilst the above initial combing is taking place the drawing-off rollers, mounted on a carriage, move towards the nipper jaws and grip the fringe of fibres {{as soon as the}} last row of pins on the comb cylinder has passed through the fringe projecting from the nipper jaws. As the drawing-off rollers grip the projecting fringe, the intersector comb descends, piercing the fringe of fibres, the nipper jaws open and the fibres are given their second combing by the rotation and recession of the drawing-off rollers pulling the fibres through the pins of the intersector comb and the pins of the feed grid. The combed fibres are then conveyed by the leather apron of the drawing-off rollers to the front rollers of the carriage, down a funnel and through the calender rollers, into a can placed directly underneath.|$|R
25|$|This {{was used}} when {{the best results}} were wanted from long fibred wools and hairs such as mohair, alpaca, long English and {{crossbred}} wools. In the Lister <b>comb,</b> the <b>slivers</b> of wool or hair are fed into the machine over the back plate, through the fluted feed rollers, under the spreader roller and onto the pins of the fallers which disentangle and transport the fibres to the nip jaw. The nip jaw, with its swinging motion, closes in upon the fringe of fibres, grasping them and pulling them out from the faller pins; thus partially combing the fibres which are then received by the carrier comb and conveyed to the pins of the large combing circle into which they are pressed by the dabbing brush. As the large circle rotates, the unique feature of the machine, the side circle comb gives the fibres a secondary combing, removing not the short fibres, but any excessively long ones. The large comb circle carries the remaining fibres to the drawing-off rollers which give the fibres their final combing by removing the long fibres from the circle pins, with the short ones being left behind. The long fibres or top pass through a revolving funnel to the crimping box and into a can directly underneath. The short fibres or noils are removed from the pins of the large comb circle by lifting knives, and deposited into a can ready for removal.|$|R
40|$|A {{new method}} is proposed, {{validated}} {{in the industrial}} practice, to determine possible bacterial and microbial degradation in textile wools and hairs. It is applied to wools of variable fineness between 18 and 34 microns and to alpaca fibers between 20 and 36 microns. It {{is based on a}} dynamometer test to determine tribocharge excision the <b>slivers</b> <b>combed.</b> The rheological behavior of degraded fiber slivers is quite different in the spinning process in addition to the major problems that appear in dyeing textiles made thereof. We propose two new indices {{to determine the extent of}} degradation that are well correlated to the results of the test the pH of the aqueous extract. The proposed new method for determining microbial and bacterial degradation is very sensitive for this type of degradation and keep a very good relationship with the results obtained by measuring the pH of the aqueous extract. The variation of the slope of the ascending curve of the excision tribocharge-elongation is a good indicator of degradation. The conventional parameters are complemented with isocharging elongation of the tape in addition to indicate the degree of degradation of the fibers, orients the spinner to the behavior of these materials in successive stretched degraded in the process of spinning machines. The results of industrial application of the new method in industry environment conditions, have been very successful in the full range of wool and alpaca fibers studied...|$|R
