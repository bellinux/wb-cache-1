40|$|A presente dissertaÃÃo analisa a traduÃÃo da personagem Lolita, de Vladimir Nabokov, para o filme homÃnimo de 1997, dirigido por Adrian Lyne. No romance Lolita (1955), a protagonista Ã uma menina de 12 anos que tem sua vida transformada apÃs ser alvo de uma paixÃo obsessiva por parte de Humbert Humbert, um homem adulto e bem mais experiente do que ela e que logo se torna seu padrasto. Diante de tal situaÃÃo, a personagem apresenta alguns traÃos de comportamento que podem gerar certo grau de ambivalÃncia quanto Ã composiÃÃo de seu carÃter na narrativa literÃria, as quais muitas de suas atitudes podem ser interpretadas tanto como fruto de uma ingenuidade infantil quanto como jogos de atributos sedutores de uma mente ardilosa. Nesta pesquisa, investigamos, especificamente, as estratÃgias do diretor na transmutaÃÃo das ambiguidades da personagem Lolita do romance para o cinema. Partimos da hipÃtese de que a protagonista como sÃmbolo da ninfeta, isto Ã, da garota sedutora, foi a faceta mais enfatizada na adaptaÃÃo fÃlmica, devido Ãs questÃes inerentes tanto Ã poÃtica do diretor, quanto Ãs produÃÃes hollywoodianas da dÃcada de noventa. Como fundamentaÃÃo teÃrica, recorremos aos pressupostos de Even-Zohar (1978), sobre a teoria dos polissistemas, e Ãqueles de Toury (1995), que se referem aos estudos da traduÃÃo com Ãnfase no fator {{cultural}}, considerando a influÃncia que a cultura de chegada exerce sobre o processo tradutÃrio. Trabalhamos tambÃm com o conceito de reescritura de Lefevere (2007), que enfatiza o contexto histÃrico e cultural dos textos traduzidos. Sobre a relaÃÃo entre literatura e cinema, empregamos os estudos de Cattrysse (1992), Stam (2008) e Xavier (2003). Por fim, baseamo-nos tambÃm nos postulados de CÃndido (2007) e Gomes (2007), no que se refere Ã construÃÃo de personagens literÃrias e fÃlmicas, alÃm de estudos prÃvios sobre Lolita, tais como aqueles de Agueros (2005) e Lazarin (2010). Os resultados mostraram que as estratÃgias utilizadas para apresentar a personagem Lolita nas telas intensificam o mito da ninfeta, da femme fatale, que permeia seu nome desde suas primeiras traduÃÃes. Por isso, na adaptaÃÃo, Lolita pode ser interpretada como a anti-herÃina de sua prÃpria histÃria enquanto Humbert se torna o herÃi apaixonadoThis dissertation {{analyzes the}} translation of Lolita character, by Vladimir Nabokov, to the eponymous film made in 1997, directed by Adrian Lyne. In the novel Lolita (1955), the man character is a 12 year-old girl whose life changed when she had started being stalked by Humbert Humbert, a grown-up and much more experienced man who soon becomes stepfather of hers. By facing this situation, Lolita {{is seen as a}} character who has some behavioral traits that give us an ideia of ambivalence about her presentation in the novel. Many of Lolita&# 8223;s attitudes can be interpreted either the result of a childish naivety or as kinds of games created by a <b>cunning</b> <b>mind.</b> In this study, we investigate, specifically, the strategies used by the director to transmute Lolita&# 8223;s ambiguities from the novel Lolita to the cinema. Our hypothesis is that the protagonist as a symbol of nymphet, that is, the seductive girl, was the most emphasized aspect in the film adaptation due to the inherent issues both related to the director&# 8223;s poetic and the types of Hollywood productions in the nineties. As theoretical background, we take the Even-Zohar&# 8223;s assumptions (1978), on the theory of polysystem, and the Toury&# 8223;s ones (1995), which refer to translation studies with emphasis on cultural factor, considering the influence of the target culture has on the translation process. We also work with the concept of rewriting by Lefevere (2007), which emphasizes the historical and cultural context of the translated texts. On the relationship between literature and film, we deal with the studies by Cattrysse (1992), Stam (2008) and Xavier (2003). Finally, we also rely on postulates by Candido (2007) and Gomes (2007), regarding to the construction of literary and filmic characters, and Lolita previous studies, such as those by Agueros (2005) and Lazarin (2010). The results pointed that the strategies to present the character Lolita on screen intensify the myth of the nymph, the femme fatale, which permeates its name from its first translations. Therefore, in the adaptation, Lolita can be interpreted as the anti-heroine of her own story while Humbert becomes the passionate her...|$|E
