5|$|Recent studies, {{as well as}} anecdotal evidence, {{show that}} fishers have begun making inroads into {{suburban}} backyards, farmland, and periurban areas in several US states and eastern Canada, {{as far south as}} most of northern Massachusetts, New York, Connecticut, Minnesota and Iowa, and even rural New Jersey. Having virtually dissapeared after the construction of the <b>Cape</b> <b>Cod</b> Canal in the early 1900's, some reports have shown that populations have become re-established on <b>Cape</b> <b>Cod,</b> although the populations are likely smaller than the populations {{in the western part of}} New England.|$|E

5|$|The Pilgrim {{settlers}} {{realized that}} they did not have a patent to settle in the region, so they signed the Mayflower Compact prior to disembarking. The Pilgrims explored various parts of <b>Cape</b> <b>Cod,</b> and eventually sought a suitable location for a permanent settlement to the westward in <b>Cape</b> <b>Cod</b> Bay. The Pilgrims eventually came across the sheltered waters of Plymouth Harbor on December 17. The appealing protected bay led to a site in the present-day Harbor District being chosen for the new settlement after three days of surveying.|$|E
5|$|The area {{in which}} the Flanders family's beach house is located in is based on the <b>Cape</b> <b>Cod</b> peninsula. Many of the writers of The Simpsons spent time on <b>Cape</b> <b>Cod</b> so they decided to model the new {{locations}} on it. The animators looked at <b>Cape</b> <b>Cod</b> photographs to get inspiration for the episode, and one of the show's background designers, Lance Wilder, grew up in that area. The beach house is based on then-show runner Josh Weinstein's parents' house in New Hampshire, to which the writers had visited many times. They played several board games when they were there, which gave them the idea to have to the Simpson family play the Mystery Date board game in the episode. Silverman said that the episode was difficult to animate and direct because it had so many new and detailed backgrounds and completely different locations.|$|E

5|$|From 1969 until 1987, {{the eastern}} {{terminus}} of Route 25 {{was at a}} junction with Maple Springs Road, US 6 and Route 28 in Wareham near the modern location of Exit 2. The MassDPW and the Massachusetts Highway Department (MassHighway) had plans to extend the freeway eastward to <b>Cape</b> <b>Cod</b> as early as 1953, when the route {{was included in the}} proposed <b>Cape</b> <b>Cod</b> Expressway that would connect New York City with <b>Cape</b> <b>Cod.</b> Route 25 was originally planned to connect to the Sagamore Bridge, which carried US 6 over the <b>Cape</b> <b>Cod</b> Canal and was used to access the towns of Hyannis and Provincetown. In 1962, however, the MassDPW conducted traffic studies on the two bridges crossing the canal and found that the Sagamore Bridge was above vehicular capacity, whereas the more southern Bourne Bridge had excess capacity. The Route 25 freeway was then redesigned to cross over the Bourne Bridge and connect with the Mid-Cape Highway (US 6) on the southern side of the canal via the proposed Southside Connector. The connector would have been constructed through the Massachusetts Military Reservation in Bourne, but was canceled by the MassDPW and MassHighway in 1977 when environmental tests indicated the freeway would disturb underground aquifers serving as water sources for the region. MassDPW instead changed the proposed eastern terminus of the Route 25 expressway to the approach ramps of the Bourne Bridge.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Edouard passed about 95miles (150km/h) {{southeast}} of Nantucket while moving at only 12mph (19km/h), much slower than previous New England hurricanes. This resulted in {{several hours of}} strong waves, winds, and rain. The hurricane produced wave heights of up to 31feet (9.4m), which washed twelve boats ashore and damaged numerous others. The strong waves and a storm surge of up to 2.1feet (.6m) in Nantucket flooded a few coastal roads. Edouard also produced tropical storm force winds across much of Massachusetts, {{as well as one}} hurricane-force gust on Nantucket. In addition, there were unofficial reports of stronger gusts, including 77mph (124km/h) on <b>Cape</b> <b>Cod,</b> 80mph (129km/h) on Martha's Vineyard, and 90mph (145km/h) on Nantucket. The strong winds caused power outages to 2/3 of Nantucket, all of Martha's Vineyard for six hours, and most of <b>Cape</b> <b>Cod</b> for several hours. Power outages, effecting 35,000 to 40,000 were reported throughout Massachusetts, though far from the power outages caused by Hurricane Bob five years prior. The winds also downed numerous trees, and blew off the roof of the fire station in Hyannis. Rainfall was moderate from the slow-moving hurricane, peaking at 6.37inches (162mm) in West Dennis with many other locations reporting over 3inches (76mm). The rainfall produced minor street flooding. Damage on <b>Cape</b> <b>Cod</b> totaled to $3.5million (1996USD, $4.6million 2007USD).|$|E
