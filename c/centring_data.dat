The data concern the selectivity of fishing nets and logistic regression is used to relate the size of a fish to the probability it will be retained or escape from a trawl net. Hierarchical models relate information from different trawls and posterior distributions are determined using MCMC. <b>Centring</b> <b>data</b> is shown to radically reduce autocorrelation in chains and Rao-Blackwellisation and chain-thinning are found to have little effect on parameter estimates. The results of four convergence diagnostics are compared and the sensitivity of the posterior distribution to the prior distribution is examined using a novel method.

These data are processed, stored, managed and exchanged in <b>data</b> <b>centres</b> but there is limited general awareness appreciation of the role such centres play as the driving hub of the economy. With this in mind, {{the purpose of this paper}} is to provide a simple review of the <b>data</b> <b>centre</b> property market and the changing geography of such centres and to review a number of the environmental and planning issues associated with the development of new <b>data</b> <b>centres.</b> Design/methodology/approach – The paper begins with a description of the characteristics and origins of <b>data</b> <b>centres,</b> outlines the <b>data</b> <b>centre</b> property market and the changing geography of new purpose built <b>data</b> <b>centres</b> within the UK and discusses a range of the environmental and planning issues associated with the development of such centres.

40|$|Abstract- Computing {{today is}} used to migrate from hosting {{services}} using servers {{owned and operated by}} individual organizations to large-scale <b>data</b> <b>centres</b> which provide resources on-demand to different organizations using a shared infrastructure. One commonly used form of such on-demand computing, is an Infrastructure as a Service (Iaas) cloud, which provides low level access to virtualized resources. Scalable and qualitative management of these <b>data</b> <b>centres</b> is becoming {{one of the most important}} challenges (to achieve) because the scale of <b>data</b> <b>centres</b> is becoming larger. Centralized management can make good load balancing in small <b>data</b> <b>centres,</b> but if <b>data</b> <b>centres</b> grow in size, centralized management systems perform badly due to the bad scalability of this type of solutions. A possible solution is fully-distributed management which improves scalability. However, this type of management loses the complete view of the <b>data</b> <b>centre</b> state, so it is more difficult to make a good global load balancing. In this paper, we evaluate a hierarchical management solution which consists in organizing the hosts of the <b>data</b> <b>centre</b> in tree form. This solution has better scalability than centralized solutions, and has better <b>data</b> <b>centre</b> overview than fully-distributed solutions. As experimenting with real physical <b>data</b> <b>centres</b> is impractical, simulation can be used to analyze, in a rapid way, the behavior of <b>data</b> <b>centres</b> using different management approaches.

The <b>Data</b> <b>Centres</b> Code of Conduct {{has been created}} in response to increasing energy consumption in <b>data</b> <b>centres</b> {{and the need to}} reduce the related environmental, economic and energy supply impacts.

40|$|The {{rapid growth}} in <b>data</b> <b>centres</b> has {{resulted}} in their consumption of up to 100 times more energy per square metre than office accommodation. IT equipment and systems, housed in <b>data</b> <b>centres,</b> consume {{a considerable amount of}} electricity. Energy consumption of <b>data</b> <b>centres</b> can be severely and unnecessarily high due to inadequate localised cooling and densely packed server rack layouts. To highlight the importance of cooling issues in <b>data</b> <b>centres,</b> operational <b>data</b> <b>centres</b> are studied using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Field measurements of temperature are performed. Numerical analysis of flow and temperature fields is conducted in order to evaluate the thermal behaviour of the <b>data</b> <b>centre.</b> A number of undesirable hotspots are identified. To rectify the problem, a few practical design and remedial solutions to improve the cooling effectiveness are proposed and examined to allow a reduced air-conditioning power requirement. Rack-level architecture and layouts have also been found to {{have a significant impact on}} the performance of server cooling systems. In this regard, semi-populated racks are modelled with various server arrangements and void positioning accommodated in a prototype <b>data</b> <b>centre.</b> In raised-floor <b>data</b> <b>centres,</b> the perforated tile flow rate distribution is fundamentally a fluid mechanics problem. The effects of position of the under-floor blockages and percentage opening of perforated tile are studied using CFD.
