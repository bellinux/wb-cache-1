McKinsey recommended that Swissair avoid high operating <b>costs</b> <b>in</b> its home country by developing partnerships with airlines based in other regions. In order to attract partners, Swissair acquired more than $1 billion in shares of other airlines, {{many of which were}} failing. This led to huge losses for Swissair.|$|E

5|$|Bird {{migration}} is the regular seasonal movement, often {{north and south}} along a flyway, between breeding and wintering grounds. Many species of bird migrate. Migration carries high <b>costs</b> <b>in</b> predation and mortality, including from hunting by humans, and is driven primarily by availability of food. It occurs mainly in the northern hemisphere, where birds are funnelled on to specific routes by natural barriers such as the Mediterranean Sea or the Caribbean Sea.|$|E
5|$|Dementia, and {{specifically}} Alzheimer's disease, may {{be among the}} most costly diseases for society in Europe and the United States, while their <b>costs</b> <b>in</b> other countries such as Argentina, and South Korea, are also high and rising. These costs will probably increase with the ageing of society, becoming an important social problem. AD-associated costs include direct medical costs such as nursing home care, direct nonmedical costs such as in-home day care, and indirect costs such as lost productivity of both patient and caregiver. Numbers vary between studies but dementia costs worldwide have been calculated around $160billion, while costs of Alzheimer's disease in the United States may be $100billion each year.|$|E
30|$|Meanwhile, {{it can be}} {{seen from}} the Fig.  13 that the total cost of each Case is in terms of fuel cost, valve-point cost, and carbon tax cost.

The fuel cost and valve-point <b>cost</b> <b>in</b> Case 3 are {{decreased}} to 22364 $/hr and 13019 $/hr, which demonstrates that the minimal total <b>cost</b> <b>in</b> Case 3 is obtained at the cost of increasing carbon tax cost and decreasing fuel cost as well as valve-point cost.|$|R

In some cases, the Army had representatives at the factories where items were made who designated them for use by Project Camel.

5|$|In 2009, NASA held a {{symposium}} on project costs which presented {{an estimate of}} the Apollo program <b>costs</b> <b>in</b> 2005 dollars as roughly $170 billion. This included all research and development costs; the procurement of 15 Saturn V rockets, 16 Command/Service Modules, 12 Lunar Modules, plus program support and management costs; construction expenses for facilities and their upgrading, and costs for flight operations. This was based on a Congressional Budget Office report, A Budgetary Analysis of NASA's New Vision for Space, September 2004. The Space Review estimated in 2010 the cost of Apollo from 1959 to 1973 as $20.4 billion, or $109 billion in 2010 dollars.|$|E
5|$|Indiana Jones is {{distributed}} by one entity, Paramount, but owned by another, Lucasfilm.
