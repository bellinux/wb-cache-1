40|$|Multimodal {{transportation}} {{is a key}} component of modern logistics systems, especially for long-distance transnational transportation. This paper explores the various alternative routes for laptop exports from Chongqing, China to Rotterdam, the Netherlands. It selects seven available routes for laptop transportation from Chongqing to Rotterdam. The multimodal model was adopted to demonstrate alternative routes using various factors such as transport cost, transfer cost, transit time, transport distance, document charge, port <b>congestion</b> <b>surcharge,</b> customs charge, confidence index and so on. Among possible alternative routes, the results indicate that the route 6 was the fastest routes except for the air transport (route 7), while the route 1 was the cheapest and safest way. Nonetheless, route 1 may be not suitable for the laptop transport due to the importance of timeliness. The logisticians may able to utilize this research's findings to make a balance between transit time and transport cost for effective multimodal transport of laptops from Chongqing to Rotterdam...|$|E

The Cape Town Container Terminal (CTCT) {{facilitates}} the handling process ofImport and Export containers for the Western Cape and other regions. South African Port Operations (SAPO), {{a division of}} the transport parastatal Transnet, is the operator that handles container volumes through the terminal. Due to the nature of its operations, it focuses on service standards within the industry. The International Shipping Industry expects this container terminal to conform by providing the same operational standards and service they receive from other international ports. Container terminal efficiency and productivity were not providing a reliable and efficient service for vessels calling to CTCT. Delays became so endemic that the shipping lines instituted a seventy-five dollar <b>congestion</b> <b>surcharge</b> on each container being handled This surcharge was passed on to the consumer therefore increasing the logistical cost of goods and services. The fact that a shipping line was bypassing Cape Town altogether was an indication that the Terminal was experiencing difficulty in maintaining its port status as a prominent and efficient container terminal at the southern tip of Africa...|$|E
40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of travel demand {{to changes in}} the generalized cost of travel can be tailored, through disaggregate mode choice models, to reflect specific trip conditions. The logit mode split function can provide share elasticities that vary not only with tripmaker characteristics, but also with travel conditions encountered along the individual route. Frequently however, average estimates of elasticities are used to predict aggregate or market wide changes in mode share which may result from <b>congestion</b> <b>surcharges.</b> Grouping individual elasticities into market averages is mandated by lack of time and money, or insufficient detail in the travel data. To the extent that logit-based elasticities reflect wide variations across tripmaker and trip characteristics, group averaging can introduce significant distortions in obtaining an accurate market response to travel cost modifications. In the absence of transferability, a reliable evaluation of congestion pricing strategies would be difficult to obtain. The main objective {{of this paper is to}} compare a cross-sectional sample of point elasticities obtained from a binary logit function against an overall average and to assess the nature of any variability in terms of selected contextual travel variables. ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Studies {{in earlier}} stages of {{motorization}} {{looked into the}} ownership and use of automobiles {{as a function of}} population density and public transit service levels. The issue then was how to cope with the wave of motorization, and how much infrastructure would be needed. As motorization progressed, it has become increasingly evident that the traffic congestion "problem" cannot be solved by building more road infrastructure (e. g., Downs, 1992). Alternatives to infrastructure expansion, such as travel demand management (TDM) schemes, are being considered and implemented in many urban areas of North America, Europe and Japan. One common aim of these schemes is to reduce trips by single-occupant vehicles by inducing solo drivers to rideshare, take public transit, walk, ride a bicycle, or work at home. One approach to achieve this objective is to make the use of automobiles more costly by means of <b>congestion</b> pricing, parking <b>surcharges,</b> or increased gasoline taxes, or t...|$|R
