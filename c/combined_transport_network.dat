40|$|Because {{of their}} {{critical}} strategic role, ports have all traditionally {{been subject to}} some form of government control even if the legal form and the intensity of this control have varied across countries. The member countries of the European Union have not been {{different from the rest of}} the world in this respect. A significant difference however is the recurrent effort to integrate, in a coordinated way, the port sector in a trans-European <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> (TEN-T) through the adoption of a common legal framework. In this context, if the objective of the reforms is to ensure that port <b>networks,</b> integrated in <b>combined</b> <b>transport</b> <b>networks,</b> become competitors of the road network, the concept of port efficiency becomes central. This paper provides an overview of the evolution of the European Port Legislation and shows how comparative economic measures can be used to highlight the scope for port efficiency improvements, essential to allow short sea shipping transport to compete with road transport in Europe. To our knowledge, this paper is also the first effort of estimating technical efficiency of European Port Authorities. The average port efficiency in 2002 was estimated to be around 60 %, denoting that ports could have handled 40 % more traffic with the same resources.

30|$|In [11 – 13], {{the authors}} {{addressed}} HSDPA flow control. It {{is a common}} assumption in these papers that Iub <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> capacity is not limiting. These flow controls are optimized only for efficient use of the air interface. In [14], the authors introduced a <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> overload control algorithm for Best-Effort DCH traffic. They showed that already {{in the case of}} DCHs, this improves <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> utilization. In [15], the authors introduced cross-layer backpressure in the RNC, which allows good <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> utilization, when the <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> bottleneck buffer is in the RNC. In [4], an HSDPA flow control algorithm which solves not only the efficient usage of air interface but also the congestion situation on <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> is proposed. The proposed algorithm {{can be used in a}} more general <b>transport</b> <b>network,</b> because it does not require the <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> bottleneck buffer to be in the RNC.

30|$|With {{more and}} more {{increased}} air interface throughput, the efficient utilization of the often limiting <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> became more important. To meet this demand a per-flow HSUPA <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> flow control algorithm has been proposed. The need for <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> congestion control was shown and <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> congestion detection and avoidance techniques were described. The introduced algorithm can support quality of service differentiation among HSUPA flows as well as different <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> bottlenecks for the flows of the same Node B. It was shown by simulations that the proposed algorithm can maintain high <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> utilization and good fairness among the flows while also keeping the delay and loss in the <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> low. The solution {{has been compared to}} a scenario where we rely only on TCP congestion control and {{it has been shown that}} the lack of HSUPA flow control causes serious performance degradation in the system when the <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> capacity is limiting the throughput.|$|R

30|$|The {{introduction}} of High Speed Uplink Packet Access (HSUPA) greatly improves achievable uplink bitrate but it presents new challenges {{to be solved}} in the WCDMA radio access <b>network.</b> In the <b>transport</b> <b>network,</b> bandwidth reservation for HSUPA is not efficient and TCP cannot efficiently resolve congestion because of lower layer retransmissions. This paper proposes an HSUPA <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> flow control algorithm that handles congestion situations efficiently and supports Quality of Service differentiation. In the Radio <b>Network</b> Controller (RNC), <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> congestion is detected. Relying on the standardized control frame, the RNC notifies the Node B about <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> congestion. In case of <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> congestion, the Node B part of the HSUPA flow control instructs the air interface scheduler to reduce the bitrate of the flow to eliminate congestion. The performance analysis concentrates on <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> limited scenarios. It is shown that TCP cannot provide efficient congestion control.

40|$|<b>Transport</b> <b>networks</b> have {{to provide}} {{carriers}} with time-efficient alternative routes in case of disruptions. It is, therefore, essential for <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> planners and operators to identify sections within the network which, if broken, have a considerable {{negative impact on the}} networks performance. Research on <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> analysis provides lots of different approaches and models in order to identify such critical sections. Most of them, however, are only applicable to mono-modal <b>transport</b> <b>networks</b> and calculate indices which represent the criticality of sections by using aggregated data. The model presented, in contrast, focuses on the analysis of intermodal <b>transport</b> <b>networks</b> by using a traffic micro simulation. Based on available, real-life data, our approach models a <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> as well as its actual traffic participants and their individual decisions in case of a disruption. The resulting transport delay time due to a specific disruption helps to identify critical sections and critical networks, as a whole.
