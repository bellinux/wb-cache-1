5000|$|FSL constructs, when in {{solution}} (saline) and in contact, will spontaneously {{incorporate into}} cell membranes. The methodology involves simply preparing {{a solution of}} FSL construct(s) {{in the range of}} 1-1000 µg/mL, with the concentration used determining the amount of antigen present on the kodecyte. The ability to <b>control</b> <b>antigen</b> levels on the outside of a kodecyte has allowed for manufacture of quality control sensitivity systems and serologic teaching kits incorporating the entire range of serologic agglutination reactions. The actual concentration will depend on the construct and the quantity of construct required in the membrane. One part of FSL solution is added to one part of cells (up to 100% suspension) and they are incubated at a set temperature within the range of 4-37 °C (39-99 °F) depending on temperature compatibility of the cells being modified. The higher the temperature, the faster the rate of FSL insertion into the membrane. For red blood cells incubation for 2 hours at 37 °C achieves >95% FSL insertion with at least 50% insertion being achieved within 20 minutes. In general, for carbohydrate based FSLs insertion into red blood cells, incubation for 4 hours at room temperature or 20 hours at 4 °C are similar to one hour at 37 °C [...] The resultant kodecytes do not required to be washed, however this option should be considered if an excess of FSL construct is used in the koding process.|$|E

SUMMARY AND EXPLANATION The use of Difco Salmonella O Antisera in the serologic identification of Salmonella requires the use of quality control test suspensions to verify that the antisera are performing as expected. Most laboratories are required to test antisera with positive and negative controls prior to use. 1, 2 Difco QC Antigens Salmonella O are chemically stabilized and inactivated suspensions of known strains of the genus Salmonella designed for use as homologous controls for testing the efficacy of the Salmonella typing antisera employed in routine laboratory procedures.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{demonstrate}} the in vitro production of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) -specific antibodies by peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) harvested from piglets infected with TGEV. Piglets were infected with the virulent Purdue strain of TGEV and at intervals postinfection their PBL were cultivated in the presence of TGEV antigen, <b>control</b> <b>antigen</b> or pokeweed mitogen (PWM). The culture supernatants were tested for TGEV antibodies by a fixed cell enzyme immunoassay. Antibodies were never found in the supernatants of unprimed PBL cultures from control piglets, nor in cultures stimulated with <b>control</b> <b>antigen,</b> and antibodies were produced more frequently in response to stimulation of primed PBL with viral antigen than with PWM. In PBL cultures stimulated with viral antigen, TGEV antibodies of the IgG class were produced more frequently than IgA class antibodies. Optimal antibody responses were produced by PBL harvested two weeks after infection and cultivated at a concentration of 10 (7) cells/mL for five days...|$|E

40|$|Mucosa-associated {{lymphoid tissue}} 1 (MALT 1) <b>controls</b> <b>antigen</b> receptor–mediated {{signalling}} to nuclear factor kB (NF-kB) through both its adaptor and protease function. Upon antigen stimulation, MALT 1 forms a complex with BCL 10 and CARMA 1, which {{is essential for}} initial IkBa phosphorylation and NF-kB nuclear translocation. Parallel induction of MALT 1 protease activity serves to inactivate negative regulators of NF-kB signalling, such as A 20 and RELB. Here we demonstrate a key role for auto-proteolytic MALT 1 cleavage in B- and T-cell receptor signalling. MALT 1 cleavage occurred after Arginine 149, between the N-terminal death domain and the first immunoglobulin-like region, and did not affect its proteolytic activity. Jurkat T cells expressing an un-cleavable MALT 1 -R 149 A mutant showed unaltered initial IkBa phosphorylation and normal nuclear accumulation of NF-kB subunits. Nevertheless, MALT 1 cleavage was required for optimal activation of NF-kB reporter genes and expression of the NF-kB targets IL- 2 and CSF 2. Transcriptome analysis confirmed that MALT 1 cleavage after R 149 was required to induce NF-kB transcriptional activity in Jurkat T cells. Collectively, these data demonstrate that auto-proteolytic MALT 1 cleavage <b>controls</b> <b>antigen</b> receptor-induced expression of NF-kB target genes downstream o...|$|R

A microtiter plate was coated with anti-human IgG and consecutively incubated with serum specimens, enzyme-labeled CMV antigen made from CMV-infected cell nuclei, and substrate. The CMV IgG antibody content was determined spectrophotometrically and expressed as absorbance. Furthermore, to reveal any nonspecific reactions, all sera were tested against an enzyme-labeled <b>control</b> <b>antigen</b> made from uninfected cell nuclei. The problem with nonspecific reactions was small and was circumvented by the addition of unlabeled <b>control</b> <b>antigen</b> to the conjugates. For epidemiological studies the test was not as sensitive as other serological tests. On the other hand, the IgG antibody capture ELISA was highly sensitive for detecting the serological antibody response in patients with primary and recurrent CMV infections. Thus, one positive serum remained positive at a serum dilution of 1 : 10 (7). The specificity of the test was shown by a blocking experiment and by testing 126 complement fixation-positive sera, of which 97 % were positive. There was a rather good correlation between the complement fixation test and the IgG antibody capture ELISA (rs = 0. 79, P less than 0. 001).

Crude or semipurified measles virus antigens were satisfactory for EIA, but antigens derived by pelleting virus from infected cell culture fluids were slightly more specific in their reactivity than were antigens produced from lysates of infected cells. However, reliable rubella EIA antigens could be produced only from infected cell culture fluids, and they required density gradient purification to render them suitably specific.

Specific CMC was reduced after treatments of effector cells with antithymocyte serum plus complement.

It is not known whether optimal activation of these T cells requires costimulation via interaction of B 7 (CD 86 /CD 80) with CD 28. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), isolated from 10 house dust mite Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Der p) -allergic asthma patients and 10 non-allergic control individuals, were stimulated with house dust mite (Der p) and the <b>control</b> <b>antigens</b> Candida albicans (CA) and tetanus toxoid (TT). The role of costimulation in activation for proliferation and cytokine mRNA production of peripheral blood T cells was studied by blocking CD 28, CTLA- 4, and their ligands CD 80 (B 7 - 1) and CD 86 (B 7 - 2). The proliferation and the production of type 1 and 2 cytokine mRNA by T cells in response to Der p as well as the <b>control</b> <b>antigens</b> TT and CA was inhibited by simultaneously masking CD 80 and CD 86 using CTLA 4 -Ig, a soluble form of CTLA- 4. Notably, Der p-specific proliferation of T cells from Der p-allergic asthma patients and non-allergic controls were inhibited equally well. Additional experiments with MoAbs revealed that activation of these T cells was optimally inhibited by blocking the interaction of CD 28 with CD 86. In vitro responses of allergen- and antigen-specific T cells of allergic patients and non-allergic control persons are equally dependent on costimulation via the CD 28 -CD 86 pathway, suggesting that inhibition of this pathway may prevent complete activation of allergen-specific T cells in allergic individuals in viv...|$|R

The lymphocytes from the first group gave a weak, and apparently P. falciparum specific proliferation, peaking after 3 - 4 days, but waning within 5 - 6 days, suggesting the induction of suppression. No such responses were obtained with <b>control</b> <b>antigen</b> consisting of normal RBC membranes. The P. falciparum antigen-induced proliferative response was completely lacking in the second group of patients. Since both groups responded equally to T cell mitogen, the results are indicative of a malaria specific non-responsiveness. In contrast T cells from a group of apparently immune donors living in highly endemic P. falciparum malaria areas developed strong and long lasting proliferative responses to P. falciparum antigen with a peak on days 5 - 6. T cells from acutely infected P. vivax patients did not respond to either the P. falciparum antigen or to the <b>control</b> <b>antigen.</b> The cellular basis of the proliferative responses were investigated by surface marker studies with monoclonal antibodies. Within the T cell preparations, the T 4 +/T 8 + cell ratio was close to normal for both the immune donors and for those with acute P. vivax infection. In contrast, this ratio was depressed for both groups of patients with acute P. falciparum infection.

Supernatants from cultures of P. falciparum patients frequently contained anti-P. falciparum antibodies when nanogram quantities (10 - 100 ng/ml) of either one of the two malaria antigen preparations was used for stimulation. No anti-P. falciparum antibodies were induced by the <b>control</b> <b>antigen</b> at any concentration. The induced anti-P. falciparum antibodies were directed to intracellular parasites and. at lower frequencies, to Pf 155 as detected on the surface of infected erythrocytes.

The lymphocytes of only one out of eight P. vivax patients responded to antigen stimulation by secreting anti-P. falciparum antibodies. However, this donor (but not any of the others), was also P. falciparum seropositive. Taken together, these results indicate that the induction of anti-P. falciparum antibody secretion reflects a secondary response in vitro of cells primed in vivo.

Here we discuss the complexity of, at times seemingly opposing roles played by these cells and propose that the CX 3 CR 1 -mediated pathogen-exclusion {{is part of a}} defensive strategy against infections that includes multiple effector mechanisms acting synergistically at the intestinal mucosal...|$|R
40|$|By rosetting techniques, peritoneal exudate cells (PEC) from mice stimulated intraperitoneally with starch {{have been}} shown to be a mixed {{population}} of cells consisting of the following subpopulations of cells: 75 % FcR, 26 % C 3 R, 18 % Ig+, 29 % Ia+, Ig- and 5 % Thy- 1 +, Ig-. By separating rosetting from non-rosetting cells, it was possible to establish the phenotype of the PEC which was cytostatic for tumour cells. This cell possessed receptors for Fc and C 3 but lacked surface Ig, the Thy- 1 <b>antigen</b> and I-region <b>controlled</b> <b>antigens</b> and was NSE positive. Thus by presently available criteria, the cytostatic PEC can be identified as a macrophage. The lack of Ia distinguishes this type of macrophage from the antigen-presenting macrophage which bears Ia...|$|R
40|$|Considerable {{progress}} has been made in characterizing four key sets of interactions <b>controlling</b> <b>antigen</b> responsiveness in T cells, involving the following: the T cell antigen receptor, its coreceptors CD 4 and CD 8, the costimulatory receptors CD 28 and CTLA- 4, and the accessory molecule CD 2. Complementary work has defined the general biophysical properties of interactions between cell surface molecules. Among the major conclusions are that these interactions are structurally heterogeneous, often reflecting clear-cut functional constraints, and that, although they all interact relatively weakly, hierarchical differences in the stabilities of the signaling complexes formed by these molecules may influence the sequence of steps leading to T cell activation. Here we review these developments and highlight the major challenges remaining as the field moves toward formulating quantitative models of T cell recognition...|$|R
