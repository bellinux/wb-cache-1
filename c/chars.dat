5|$|Originally, 300 AMX-30s {{were ordered}} by the French Army, and by 1971 the order had been {{increased}} to 900, divided between eight batches, including all variants based on the chassis. Beginning in 1966, ten AMX-30s were assembled per month, and the first five were issued in August 1966 to the 501st Régiment de <b>Chars</b> de Combat. Monthly production grew to 15–20 tanks as new factories began to manufacture components of the vehicle and existing factories increased their production potential. However, in April 1969, production was again reduced to ten per month. By 1971, about 180 vehicles were in service; in 1975 delivery began of the last 143 units of the final eighth batch of the original order. In 1985, the number of AMX-30s had risen to 1,173. By the end of production, France had accepted 1,355 AMX-30s into service, including 166 brand-new AMX-30B2s. Another 493 tanks were refitted and modernized to AMX-30B2 standards; originally 271 new and 820 refitted vehicles had been planned. The French Army also accepted {{a large number of}} variants, including 195 self-propelled howitzers, 44 AMX-30 Pluton tactical nuclear missile launchers, 183 AMX-30Rs, 134 AMX-30Ds and 48 engineer vehicles (AMX-30EBG). The last 35 new battle tanks were in 1989 ordered by Cyprus and the last new variant vehicles, a batch of twenty GCTs, in 1994 by France.|$|E

25|$|The annual {{consumption}} of antimony(III) oxide in the United States and Europe is approximately 10,000 and 25,000 tonnes, respectively.

25|$|There is no legally adopted term in Russia for artisanal fisheries. Artisanal or {{subsistence}} fishing usually refers to fishing mainly with traditional gear, with production {{delivered to the}} market but also used for subsistence. In Russia, the term covers also several kinds of fisheries classified as industrial, such as salmon, <b>chars,</b> whitefish, navaga, flounders and greenling fisheries in the Baltic, the Arctic and the Far Eastern Seas. Subsistence fishing by indigenous groups is also an issue. Indigenous fishers mainly work estuaries, lagoons and rivers (for anadromous fish). Legally, they are bound to use their catch for local consumption only. They {{are not allowed to}} sell their catch, but in reality, this is not always the case.|$|E
25|$|Other {{than the}} burbot and {{northern}} pike, {{most of the}} large fish found in Yukon rivers, lakes and streams are salmonids. Four species of Pacific salmon (Chinook, sockeye, coho and chum) breed in Yukon rivers and lakes in the Pacific and Yukon River watersheds. The Yukon River has the longest freshwater migration route of any salmon; Chinook salmon swim over 3,000 kilometres from its mouth in the Bering Sea to spawning grounds upstream of Whitehorse. There are also land-locked kokanee (sockeye salmon) and rainbow trout. <b>chars</b> are represented by lake trout present in most large Yukon lakes, as well as Dolly Varden, bull trout and Arctic char. The Arctic grayling is ubiquitous, while the lakes have various whitefish and inconnu.|$|E
25|$|In {{the wake}} of the mutinies Philippe Pétain was {{appointed}} supreme commander. He tried to restore confidence by abstaining from overambitious offensive plans. Only in 1918 when the influx of American troops and new armoured vehicles would tip the balance in favour of the Entente, could decisive attacks be considered. His motto was therefore: J'attends les Américains et les <b>chars</b> ("I wait for the Americans and the tanks"). However, remaining purely inactive would undermine the morale; to bolster it a series of meticulously prepared small-scale offensives were undertaken in which success was guaranteed by deploying an overwhelming numerical superiority, especially in artillery, to conquer a limited objective. On 23 October 1917 Pétain in one blow took the notorious Chemin-des-Dames crest, including the fortress of La Malmaison. The attack was supported by Groupement Chaubès, at the time consisting of AS 8, 11 and 12. Due to the losses in April, each AS now deployed twelve tanks. Including the supply vehicles the Schneider total numbered forty-one. The command vehicles of AS 11 and AS 12 were that day the first French tanks ever to use radio equipment in battle.|$|E

500|$|Rainbow trout are predators with {{a varied}} diet and will eat nearly {{anything}} they can capture. They are not as piscivorous or aggressive as brown trout or <b>chars.</b> Rainbow trout, including juvenile steelhead in fresh water, routinely feed on larval, pupal and adult forms of aquatic insects (typically caddisflies, stoneflies, mayflies and aquatic diptera). [...] They also eat fish eggs and adult forms of terrestrial insects (typically ants, beetles, grasshoppers and crickets) that fall into the water. Other prey include small fish up to one-third of their length, crayfish, shrimp, and other crustaceans. As rainbow trout grow, the proportion of fish consumed increases in most populations. Some lake-dwelling forms may become planktonic feeders. In rivers and streams populated with other salmonid species, rainbow trout eat varied fish eggs, including those of salmon, brown and cutthroat trout, mountain whitefish and the eggs of other rainbow trout. Rainbows also consume decomposing flesh from carcasses of other fish. [...] Adult steelhead in the ocean feed primarily on other fish, squid and amphipods.|$|E
500|$|The AMX-30 is a main {{battle tank}} {{designed}} by Ateliers de construction d'Issy-les-Moulineaux (AMX, then GIAT) and first {{delivered to the}} French Army in 1966. The first five tanks were issued to the 501st Régiment de <b>Chars</b> de Combat (Tank Regiment) in August of that year. The production version of the AMX-30 weighed , and sacrificed protection for increased mobility. The French believed {{that it would have}} required too much armour to protect against the latest anti-tank threats, thereby reducing the tank's maneuverability. Protection, instead, was provided by the speed and the compact dimensions of the vehicle, including a height of 2.28 metres. It had a 105mm gun, firing a then advanced high explosive anti-tank warhead known as the Obus G. The Obus G used an outer shell, separated from the main charge by ball bearings, to allow the round to be spin stabilized by the gun without affecting the warhead inside. Mobility was provided by the [...] HS-110 diesel engine, although the troublesome transmission adversely affected the tank's performance.|$|E

500|$|After the {{fighting}} in North Africa ended, Leclerc's L Force, now about 4,000 strong, became the 2e Division Française Libre (2e DFL). In June 1943, de Gaulle informed him the 2e DFL would be re-equipped by the Americans as an armoured division, the 2e Division Blindée (2e DB). It was often called La Division Leclerc. Although organised along American lines, its units had French titles. The non-white units were transferred out. The remainder of 2e DFL became the Regiment de Marche du Tchad (RMT), 2e DB's motorised infantry regiment. Free French armoured units serving with the Eighth Army became the 501e Régiment de <b>chars</b> de combat (501e RCC). The artillery {{and the other two}} armoured regiments of 2e DB, the 12e Régiment de Cuirassiers (12e RC) and the [...] (12e RCA), were drawn from the Vichy Armée d'Afrique. [...] Perhaps the most unusual unit in the division was the [...] (RBFM), sailors who served as a tank destroyer regiment. Leclerc had to weld the various units, some of whom had recently been fighting against the Allies, into a team. This was no easy task. When two men from the 501e RCC upset a former Vichy officer by singing a disrespectful song about Général d'armée Henri Giraud, resulting in a fight, he told the officer concerned that respect had to be earned.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn {{fixed bed}} gasifiers, the <b>char</b> bed {{gasification}} zone where <b>char</b> is converted into syngas {{plays a major}} role in terms of efficiency and control of the process. This zone is particularly complex as many phenomena compete, i. e. heterogeneous and homogeneous chemical reactions, gas flow in porous medium and flow of solid particles. This paper investigates the mechanical and thermochemical behavior of the <b>char</b> bed gasification zone and focuses particularly on bed compaction. To achieve this, a low-density biomass <b>char</b> from wood chips and a high-density one from wood pellets were gasified in a pilot scale continuous fixed bed reactor. Measurements of profiles were taken along the <b>char</b> bed for temperature, gas species concentration, <b>char</b> composition, <b>char</b> bed density and <b>char</b> particle velocity using fine instrumentation and specific <b>char</b> and gas sampling techniques. In our operating conditions, the <b>char</b> bed reactive zone is 3 times longer for chips (45 cm) than for pellets (16 cm).
