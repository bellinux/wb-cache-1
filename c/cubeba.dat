5|$|The {{volatile}} oil, oleum <b>cubebae,</b> was {{the form}} in which cubeb is most commonly used as a drug, the dose being 5 to 20 minims, which may be suspended in mucilage or given after meals in a wafer. The drug exhibited the typical actions of a volatile oil, but exerted some of these to an exceptional degree. As such, it was liable to cause a cutaneous erythema {{in the course of}} its excretion by the skin, had a marked diuretic action, and was a fairly efficient disinfectant of the urinary passages. Its administration caused the appearance in the urine of a salt of cubebic acid which was precipitated by heat or nitric acid, and was therefore liable to be mistaken for albumin, when these two most common tests for the occurrence of albuminuria were applied.|$|R
500|$|The modern use of cubeb in England {{as a drug}} {{dates from}} 1815. There were various preparations, {{including}} oleum <b>cubebae</b> (oil of cubeb), tinctures, fluid extracts, oleo-resin compounds, and vapors, which were used for throat complaints. A small percentage of cubeb was commonly included in lozenges designed to alleviate bronchitis, in which the antiseptic and expectoral properties of the drug are useful. The most important therapeutic application of this drug, however, was in treating gonorrhea, where its antiseptic action was of much value. William Wyatt Squire wrote in 1908 that cubebs [...] "act specifically on the genito-urinary mucous membrane. (They are) given in all stages of gonorrhea". As compared with copaiba in this connection cubeb has the advantages of being less disagreeable to take and somewhat less likely to disturb the digestive apparatus in prolonged administration.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Aromatic {{essential}} oils extracted from fresh fruits of Litsea <b>cubeba</b> (Lour.) Pers., have diverse medical and economic values. The dominant components in these {{essential oils}} are monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of terpenoid biosynthesis {{is essential for}} improving the yield and quality of terpenes. However, the 40 available L. <b>cubeba</b> nucleotide sequences in the public databases are insufficient for studying the molecular mechanisms. Thus, high-throughput transcriptome sequencing of L. <b>cubeba</b> is necessary to generate large quantities of transcript sequences {{for the purpose of}} gene discovery, especially terpenoid biosynthesis related genes. RESULTS: Using Illumina paired-end sequencing, approximately 23. 5 million high-quality reads were generated. De novo assembly yielded 68, 648 unigenes with an average length of 834 bp. A total of 38, 439 (56 %) unigenes were annotated for their functions, and 35, 732 and 25, 806 unigenes could be aligned to the GO and COG database, respectively. By searching against the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes Pathway database (KEGG), 16, 130 unigenes were assigned to 297 KEGG pathways, and 61 unigenes, which contained the mevalonate and 2 -C-methyl-D-erythritol 4 -phosphate pathways, could be related to terpenoid backbone biosynthesis. Of the 12, 963 unigenes, 285 were annotated to the terpenoid pathways using the PlantCyc database. Additionally, 14 terpene synthase genes were identified from the transcriptome. The expression patterns of the 16 genes related to terpenoid biosynthesis were analyzed by RT-qPCR to explore their putative functions. CONCLUSION: RNA sequencing was effective in identifying a large quantity of sequence information. To our knowledge, this study is the first exploration of the L. <b>cubeba</b> transcriptome, and the substantial amount of transcripts obtained will accelerate the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of essential oils biosynthesis. The results may help improve future genetic and genomics studies on the molecular mechanisms behind the chemical composition of essential oils in L. <b>cubeba</b> fruits...|$|E

Methods and Results: The EO showed the prevalence of linalool (95 %, n = 5). It was bactericidal against the majority of tested strains, with minimum inhibitory concentrations ranging from 0. 72 to 2. 89 mg ml(- 1) (Aer. hydrophila, Edwarsiella tarda, Vibrio furnissii, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Streptococcus garvieae, Escherichia coli, Salmonella Typhimurium). The fish was fed with 0 (control), 2, 4 and 8 % leaf powder supplementation diets for 21 days. Nonspecific immunity parameters (lysozyme, haemolytic and bactericidal activities of plasma) were assessed 21 days after feeding period and before the experimental infection. Weight gain, specific growth rate and feed conversion ratio were improved by supplementation of L. <b>cubeba</b> in a dose-related manner, and a significant difference appeared at the highest dose (8 %) when compared to the control. The increase in plasma lysozyme was significant for all the treated groups. Haemolysis activity was higher for the groups fed with 4 and 8 % plant powder. Antibacterial activity increased significantly for the 8 % dose only. Conclusions: Litsea <b>cubeba</b> leaf powder increased nonspecific immunity of carps in dose-related manner. After infection with Aer. hydrophila, survivals of fish fed with 4 and 8 % L. <b>cubeba</b> doses were significantly higher than those fed with 2 % dose and the control. Significance and Impact of the Study: A range of 4 - 8 % L. <b>cubeba</b> leaf powder supplementation diet (from specific linalool-rich chemotype) can be used in aquaculture to reduce antibiotic burden and impacts of diseases caused by Aer. hydrophila...|$|E

On day 8, 1  h after L. <b>cubeba</b> fruit oil administration, each mouse was placed {{in the center of the}} open-field arena. The distance of movement, mean speed and the time spent immobile during a 5 -min observation period were recorded to indicate the exploratory activity of mice.|$|E

Litsea <b>cubeba</b> has recently received much attention due to multiple functions as antibacterial, antifungal, insecticidal, antioxidant and anticancer agent. The application of Litsea <b>cubeba</b> essential oil (LC) in this investigation {{is one of the first}} experiments made in order to improve shelf-life of minimally processed fruits. The aim of this work was to investigate the effect of LC at different concentrations (50, 100 and 250 ppm), on shelf-life of fresh-cut pears ‘Packham’s Triumph’ variety. Colour of fresh-cut pears as well as, polyphenol content, antioxidant activity and flesh firmness of untreated and treated samples, were determined. Analysis were carried out immediately following oil treatments, and on 1, 7, 14 day of storage at 2 °C. Treatment with 50 ppm of LC was the most effective treatment to maintain colour of fresh-cut pears during 14 day of storage. Phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity in samples treated with solutions of LC remain stable during 14 day of storage. The lowest loss of firmness was detected in fresh-pears treated with 250 ppm LC. Essential oil of Litsea <b>cubeba</b> has promising application as a treatment of fresh-cut pears...|$|E

Prof. Yen-Hsueh Tseng from the Department of Forestry, National Chung-Hsing University, confirmed taxonomic identification, and voucher specimens were deposited at the Herbarium of the Department of Forestry, National Chung-Hsing University, Taiwan.|$|E
