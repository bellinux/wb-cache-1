40|$|I]f the assured is not {{entitled}} to retain an excess against the insurer, and the insurer … is not entitle to receive the excess from the assured, {{what happens to the}} excess?” This question, posed by Lord Justice Megaw in L. Lucas Ltd. v. Export Credits Guarantee Department, is bred by the juxtaposition of two subrogation rules. The right to subrogation, being in nature like restitution, entitles the holder of the right only to reimbursement and, under a <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> insurance, “the assured … shall be fully indemnified, but shall never be more than fully indemnified. ” The confusion that distribution of windfall profits in subrogation has brought to American and English courts derives from both the difficulty of the question and its rarity. Because insurance agreements are <b>contracts</b> <b>of</b> <b>indemnity,</b> the issue <b>of</b> which party is entitled to any possible excess once both the insurer and the insured have been indemnified has seldom been litigated. This comment will evaluate a subrogee’s right to recover more than it paid to the subrogor. The purpose of subrogation and insurance will be outlined, focusing on those few recent cases in England and the United States dealing with the profit-in-subrogation issue. Next, this Comment will examine the circumstances under which a windfall might accrue to the insurer and the possible justifications and consequences of such a windfall award. A flexible approach for courts confronted with allocating a windfall in an equitable subrogation suit will then be proposed. Finally the implications of choosing a flexible approach to windfalls in subrogation will be contrasted with the view that the windfall be awarded strictly to either the insured or the insurer...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} London Market Excess of Loss Spiral (“LMX Spiral”), a {{phenomenon}} based upon excess <b>of</b> loss reinsurance <b>contracts</b> that developed within the London reinsurance market of the 1980 s. The unwinding of the LMX Spiral {{was a key}} factor in the crisis the Lloyd’s insurance market had to face in the early 1990 s. However, whilst the crisis resulted in a wave of litigation in the English courts, there is no legal appraisal of the additional element of risk brought by the LMX Spiral itself. The case law instead focuses on the duties of the underwriters and various agents that fuelled its development. This situation is unsatisfactory for two reasons. Firstly, reinsurance spirals are a potential side-effect of XL reinsurance markets and therefore other spirals may develop in the future. Secondly, this thesis shows that once a reinsurance spiral reaches a certain point, it becomes unsustainable, generating instability within the relevant reinsurance market. This thesis provides a detailed legal appraisal of reinsurance spirals and a new analysis of excess <b>of</b> loss reinsurance <b>contracts.</b> The first part sets out the relevant legal principles and describes the LMX Spiral and its impact; listing, for the first time, the “Spiral Effects” identified through reports and actuarial models. The second part reviews the case law and assesses the legal nature of the excess of loss “Spiral Contracts” at the core of any reinsurance spiral, concluding that the Spiral Effects can distort the Spiral Contracts {{to the point where they}} become simple <b>contracts</b> <b>of</b> <b>indemnity.</b> The third part explores the nature of excess of loss reinsurance in light of the review <b>of</b> the Spiral <b>Contracts,</b> submitting that excess <b>of</b> loss reinsurance <b>contracts</b> cover both the liability of the reinsured and the relevant insured peril...|$|R
50|$|The cost of homeowner's {{insurance}} often {{depends on}} {{what it would cost}} to replace the house and which additional endorsements or riders are attached to the policy. The insurance policy is a legal contract between the insurance carrier (insurance company) and the named insured(s). It is a <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>indemnity</b> and will put the insured back to the state he/she was in prior to the loss. Typically, claims due to floods or war (whose definition typically includes a nuclear explosion from any source) are excluded from coverage, amongst other standard exclusions (like termites). Special insurance can be purchased for these possibilities, including flood insurance. Insurance is adjusted to reflect the cost of replacement, usually upon application of an inflation factor or a cost index.|$|E

This vexed problem was presented in Gilbert v. Selleck (1919, Conn.) 106 AtI. 439, where the Connecticut Supreme Court of Errors decided that the statute, {{in the case of a}} contract obligation, does not destroy the debt but merely takes away the remedy, and that one has no 2 ̆ 2 property 2 ̆ 2 in the bar of the statute, thus distinguishing a debt from realty or chattels where the 2 ̆ 2 property 2 ̆ 2 passes and both 2 ̆ 2 legal title 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 real ownership 2 ̆ 2 become vested by the running of the statute.

40|$|The {{principle}} <b>of</b> <b>indemnity</b> is well-accepted in {{the field}} of insurance and is also commonly assumed in the literature <b>of</b> optimal <b>contract</b> design. However, should this principle be imposed on all insurance contracts without exceptions? Does there exist an insurance contract that is optimal for both the insurer and the insured even as the principle <b>of</b> <b>indemnity</b> is violated? The answer is yes. This paper demonstrates that in the insurance market there do exist contracts in which optimality is accompanied by a violation <b>of</b> the <b>indemnity</b> principle if the insurer and insured have deviant beliefs in loss distribution. We further use retrospective rating as an example to explain why an insurance contract, violating the principle <b>of</b> <b>indemnity,</b> commonly exists in commercial insurance, especially where moral hazard and adverse selection is less severe...|$|R

5000|$|The Divine Principle goes on {{to explain}} three types <b>of</b> <b>indemnity</b> {{conditions}}. Equal conditions <b>of</b> <b>indemnity</b> pay back the full value of what was lost. The biblical verse [...] "life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth" [...] (Exod.21:23-24) is quoted as an example <b>of</b> an equal <b>indemnity</b> condition. Lesser conditions <b>of</b> <b>indemnity</b> provide a benefit greater than the price that is paid. Faith, baptism, and the eucharist are mentioned as examples <b>of</b> lesser <b>indemnity</b> conditions. Greater conditions <b>of</b> <b>indemnity</b> come about when a person fails in a lesser condition. In that case a greater price must be paid {{to make up for}} the earlier failure. Abraham's attempted sacrifice of his son Isaac (Gen. 22:1-18) and the Israelites' 40 years of wandering in the wilderness under Moses (Num.14:34) are mentioned as examples <b>of</b> greater <b>indemnity</b> conditions. The Divine Principle then explains that an indemnity condition must reverse the course by which the mistake or loss came about. Indemnity, at its core, is required of humans because God is pure, and purity cannot relate directly with impurity. Indemnification is the vehicle that allows a [...] "just and righteous" [...] God to work through mankind. Jesus' statement that God had forsaken him (Matt.27:46) and Christianity's history of martyrdom are mentioned as examples of this. The Divine Principle then states that human beings, not God or the angels, are the ones responsible for making indemnity conditions.|$|R
