5|$|The {{derivative}} of a function can, in principle, be computed from the definition by <b>considering</b> <b>the</b> difference quotient, and computing its limit. In practice, once the derivatives {{of a few}} simple functions are known, the derivatives of other functions are more easily computed using rules for obtaining derivatives of more complicated functions from simpler ones.|$|E

His graduate student, Richard Feynman, found this hard to believe, but the idea that positrons were electrons traveling backwards in time intrigued him and Feynman incorporated the notion of the reversibility of time into his Feynman diagrams.|$|E
