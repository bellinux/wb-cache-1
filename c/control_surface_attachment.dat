The fuselage, wing halves, tail surfaces and control surfaces are already constructed. ARF airplanes typically only include the airframe and some accessories such as pushrods, fuel tank, etc. Therefore, the power system (glow engine, gas engine, or electric motor and any required accessories) and radio system (servos, transmitter, receiver, and battery) must be purchased separately.|$|E

The DLR-F 19 is a “flying wing” configuration with a geometry based on previous research conducted in the scope of the “Mephisto” project and its predecessors “FaUSST” and “UCAV 2010 ”. While there is a considerable amount of knowledge for conventional configurations, unconventional configurations lack of experience, and data for comparison is rarely available.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the first example}} of reversible photoregulation of the binding of a protease, α-chymotrypsin, to a surface. A modular approach is used involving the azobenzene photoswitch group, a surface linker and an enzyme binding group. This approach {{is designed to be}} easily extended to the photoregulation of binding of other proteases to surfaces by use of enzyme binding groups selective to these proteases. Chapter one gives a brief outline of some of the important areas involved in to this work, including molecular switches, proteases and surface modification. Chapter two describes the synthesis of azobenzene-containing boronate esters designed as photoswitch inhibitors of α-chymotrypsin. Boronate esters were prepared containing the aminophenylboronate group or the peptidomimetic borophenylalanine group for enzyme binding and a range of substituents designed for enzyme affinity and/or <b>surface</b> <b>attachment.</b> Syntheses primarily involved peptide coupling reactions and azobenzene formation by condensation of nitrosobenzenes and anilines. Coupling reactions were successfully carried out using EDCI or isobutyl chlorofomate in several cases where other reagents gave unacceptable decomposition. Chapter three describes the syntheses and HPLC stability studies of derivatives of a noncovalent α-chymotrypsin inhibitor. Several dipeptide-based compounds containing either an amide group for <b>surface</b> <b>attachment</b> or an azobenzene group for photoswitching were prepared, primarily using peptide coupling reactions. Each compound was incubated with α-chymotrypsin to assess its stability, and all were found by HPLC monitoring to be stable to α-chymotrypsin catalysed hydrolysis. Chapter four describes syntheses of azobenzene-containing trifluoromethylketones and α-ketoesters designed as photoswitch inhibitors of α-chymotrypsin. Trifluoromethylketones/α-ketoesters containing amine groups for <b>surface</b> <b>attachment</b> were prepared, primarily using peptide coupling reactions, but could not be isolated due to the incompatibility of the electrophilic ketone and primary amine groups. Trifluoromethylketones/α-ketoesters containing terminal alkynes for <b>surface</b> <b>attachment</b> were prepared either by the attachment of an alkyne substituent group to a symmetrical azobenzene core or by Pd-catalysed reaction of a protected alkyne with an azobenzene having a halide substitutent. Chapter five describes syntheses of sulfur-containing surface linkers for use in <b>surface</b> <b>attachment</b> of the photoswitch inhibitors described in chapters 2 - 4. A range of compounds containing disulfide or protected thiol groups for <b>surface</b> <b>attachment</b> and azide or carboxylic acid groups for inhibitor attachment were prepared. Syntheses primarily involved coupling of functionalised alcohols/amides to carboxylic acid-containing disulfides/thioacetates. Selected linkers were attached to azobenzenes by amide coupling or azide-alkyne cycloaddition for <b>surface</b> <b>attachment,</b> photoswitching and/or enzyme assay. Azide-alkyne cycloaddition yields were initially poor, but were improved by use of stoichiometric amounts of copper catalyst. Chapter six describes UV/vis photoisomerisation studies and enzyme assays carried out to assess enzyme photoswitching of the compounds described in chapters 2 - 5. The trifluoromethylketones and α-ketoesters described in chapter 4 gave the best results, with moderate inhibition of α-chymotrypsin (µM affinity constants) and up to 5. 3 fold changes in inhibition on UV/vis irradiation. Many of the boronate esters described in chapter 2 were found to inhibit α-chymotrypsin, but were somewhat unstable to irradiation. The dipeptide-based compounds described in chapter 3 were inactive against α-chymotrypsin. Good photoisomerisation was obtained for an azobenzene containing a symmetrical disulfide surface linker and poor photoisomerisation was obtained for an azobenzene containing a lipoic acid surface linker. Chapter seven describes <b>surface</b> <b>attachment</b> of selected photoswitch inhibitors and studies of photoregulated enzyme binding to the resultant functional surfaces. Self assembled monolayers (SAMs) of disulfides were formed on gold surfaces and characterised by electrochemistry and contact angle measurements. Binding of α-chymotrypsin to SAMs containing a photoswitch inhibitor was detected by quartz crystal microbalance (QCM), but was found to be largely irreversible. An alkyne-containing photoswitch inhibitor was attached to a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) chip in a two step procedure involving generation of an azide modified surface followed by azide-alkyne cycloaddition. Binding of α-chymotrypsin to the resultant modified surface was detected by SPR and successfully regulated by UV/vis irradiation. Chapter eight provides conclusions for the work described in this thesis and suggests future directions. Chapter nine gives experimental details for the work described in this thesis...|$|R

40|$|P>The chaplin {{proteins}} ChpA-H {{enable the}} filamentous bacterium Streptomyces coelicolor to form reproductive aerial structures by assembling into surface-active amyloid-like fibrils. We here demonstrate that chaplins also mediate attachment of S. coelicolor to <b>surfaces.</b> <b>Attachment</b> {{coincides with the}} formation of fimbriae, which are connected to the cell surface via spike-shaped protrusions. Mass spectrometry, electron microscopy and Congo red treatment showed that these fimbriae are composed of bundled amyloid fibrils of chaplins. Attachment and fimbriae formation were abolished in a strain in which the chaplin genes chpA-H were inactivated. Instead, very thin fibrils emerged from the spike-shaped protrusions in this mutant. These fibrils were susceptible to cellulase treatment. This enzymatic treatment also released wild-type fimbriae from the cell <b>surface,</b> thereby abolishing <b>attachment.</b> The reduced attachment of a strain in which the gene of a predicted cellulose synthase was inactivated also indicates a role of cellulose in <b>surface</b> <b>attachment.</b> We propose that the mechanism of attachment via cellulose-anchored amyloidal fimbriae is widespread in bacteria and may function in initiation of infection and in formation of biofilms...|$|R

40|$|A {{simulation}} {{framework is}} developed {{for assessing the}} effect of <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> inertial loads on hypersonic vehicle response.

This approach is advantageous in that it does not require direct coupling of the fuselage and <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> models, and therefore allows for the models to be of dissimilar form.

40|$|We report {{here the}} effects of chain {{stiffness}} and <b>surface</b> <b>attachment</b> on the effective interactions between polyelectrolyte-grafted colloidal particles in monovalent salt obtained using Monte Carlo simulations. Our approach involves computation of the distance-dependent potential of mean force between two polyelectrolyte-grafted colloidal particles treated at a coarse-grained resolution. Two chain stiffnesses, flexible and stiff, and two <b>surface</b> <b>attachment</b> modes, free and constrained, at low grafting densities are examined. PMF calculations {{across a range of}} surface and polyelectrolyte charge allows us to map out the strength and extent of the attractive and repulsive regime in the two-dimensional charge space. We observe striking differences in {{the effects of}} chain stiffness between the two modes of attachment. When the chains are freely attached, the stiff-chains colloids exhibit a marginal reduction in the attraction compared to their flexible-chain counterparts. In contrast, when the chains are attached in a constrained manner, the colloids with stiff chains exhibit a significantly stronger attraction and a broader attractive regime compared to flexible-chain colloids. These differences in the effects of stiffness between the two attachment modes are explained in terms of differences in the energetic and entropic forces balancing adsorption of chains at their own surface versus chain extension to mediate bridging interactions across two particles. Our results thus underscore the importance of <b>surface</b> <b>attachment</b> of chains and its proper accounting in computational and experimental studies and suggests the mode of chain attachment as an additional control parameter for modulating intercolloid interactions for applications such as stabilization of colloidal systems and bottom-up self-assembly of nanostructures. 1...|$|R
