5|$|By the 1960s, the Aldeburgh Festival was {{outgrowing}} its customary venues, {{and plans}} to build a new <b>concert</b> <b>hall</b> in Aldeburgh were not progressing. When redundant Victorian maltings buildings in the village of Snape, six miles inland, became available for hire, Britten realised that the largest of them could be converted into a <b>concert</b> <b>hall</b> and opera house. The 830-seat Snape Maltings hall was opened by the Queen {{at the start of the}} twentieth Aldeburgh Festival on 2 June 1967; it was immediately hailed as one of the best concert halls in the country. The hall was destroyed by fire in 1969, but Britten was determined that it would be rebuilt in time for the following year's festival, which it was. The Queen again attended the opening performance in 1970.|$|E
