40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{an investigation}} {{into one of the}} important functions of the banking system: to transform short-term liquid deposits into long-term illiquid financial assets that can fund long gestation activities and, thus, raise the rate of economic growth. To investigate this function empirically, the dissertation uses two new data sets on the maturity of bank credit to the private sector. First data set contains yearly observations covering 74 countries during the period from about 1990 to 2005, while the second data set contains quarterly observations covering 14 transition countries from about 1995 to 2006. Using the data on a broad set of countries, the dissertation shows that economic growth is enhanced in countries where the financial system extends more long-term credit. This finding is the first empirical confirmation of the theoretical predictions regarding the liquidity transformation function of banks. Furthermore, using the same data set, the dissertation shows that <b>credit</b> <b>maturity</b> depends on a number of institutional and economic factors. The determinants of <b>credit</b> <b>maturity</b> have an impact on economic growth via their influence on the availability of long-term external financing. <b>Credit</b> <b>maturity</b> is longer in countries with strong legal institutions, with low inflation, with deeper financial markets, and with schemes for sharing credit information between financial institutions. From a policy perspective, the institutions for sharing credit information probably present the most interest because their establishment is a policy choice. Findings from the broad set of countries are confirmed in the second data set using several definitions of maturity. Additional results from the second data set suggest that <b>credit</b> <b>maturity</b> is longer in countries at the higher level of economic development, with less liquid stock markets, and with more privately owned domestic banks. Furthermore, the results suggest that credit information sharing mechanisms lengthen the maturity of credit if credit information sharing institutions are privately owned or have greater quality of information...|$|E

Finally, we find evidence that the security level (our proxy for the recovery rate) is inversely related to the at issue time to maturity. This suggests that lenders use the promised maturity and security level bond covenants as screening mechanisms to overcome some of the asset substitution and adverse selection problems associated with buying bonds that are subject to <b>credit</b> risk. <b>maturity,</b> <b>credit</b> risk, security level, duration, macroeconomic factors...|$|R

40|$|Credit {{constraints}} can undermine livelihood sustenance {{strategies of}} farmers faced with prolonged droughts. Marginal farmers with low wealth endowments could be especially vulnerable. The model developed {{in this paper}} explores the role of credit in enhancing long-term drought resilience. When repeated droughts increase reliance upon groundwater resources, credit availability may promote or undermine groundwater sustainability. Timely availability of credit {{can be used for}} water-saving technology adoption and towards maintaining minimum consumption levels during drought years. It is demonstrated here that high costs of credit coupled with a high risk of repeated droughts occurring in the future could be detrimental to groundwater sustainability. This is counter to the earlier findings in the literature that cheap credit could be damaging to groundwater sustainability. The duration to <b>credit</b> <b>maturity</b> also has a bearing on farmers’ groundwater extraction strategies and hence there could be a role for credit granting financial institutions in influencing sustainable outcomes. Specifically, medium-term loans have a better effect on groundwater sustainability as compared to long-term loans. 25 page(s...|$|E

40|$|The {{rapid growth}} of the market-based {{financial}} system since the mid- 1980 s {{changed the nature of}} financial intermediation in the United States profoundly. Within the market-based financial system, "shadow banks" are particularly important institutions. Shadow banks are financial intermediaries that conduct maturity, credit, and liquidity transformation without access to central bank liquidity or public sector credit guarantees. Examples of shadow banks include finance companies, asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) conduits, limited-purpose finance companies, structured investment vehicles, credit hedge funds, money market mutual funds, securities lenders, and government-sponsored enterprises.; Shadow banks are interconnected along a vertically integrated, long intermediation chain, which intermediates credit through a wide range of securitization and secured funding techniques such as ABCP, asset-backed securities, collateralized debt obligations, and repo. This intermediation chain binds shadow banks into a network, which is the shadow banking system. The shadow banking system rivals the traditional banking system in the intermediation of credit to households and businesses. Over the past decade, the shadow banking system provided sources of inexpensive funding for credit by converting opaque, risky, long-term assets into money-like and seemingly riskless short-term liabilities. Maturity and credit transformation in the shadow banking system thus contributed significantly to asset bubbles in residential and commercial real estate markets prior to the financial crisis.; We document that the shadow banking system became severely strained during the financial crisis because, like traditional banks, shadow banks conduct <b>credit,</b> <b>maturity,</b> and liquidity transformation, but unlike traditional financial intermediaries, they lack access to public sources of liquidity, such as the Federal Reserve's discount window, or public sources of insurance, such as federal deposit insurance. The liquidity facilities of the Federal Reserve and other government agencies' guarantee schemes were a direct response to the liquidity and capital shortfalls of shadow banks and, effectively, provided either a backstop to credit intermediation by the shadow banking system or to traditional banks for the exposure to shadow banks. Our paper documents the institutional features of shadow banks, discusses their economic roles, and analyzes their relation to the traditional banking system.

40|$|The {{dramatic}} increase in securitisation activity experienced in Europe {{in the years following}} the introduction of the euro has altered the liquidity, <b>credit</b> and <b>maturity</b> transformation role traditionally performed by banks. We claim that the changing role of credit intermediaries due to securitisation has also modified the effectiveness of the bank lending channel and banks' ability to grant loans. We use a novel database of securitisation activity and a large sample of European banks and find that the use of securitisation shelters banks' loan supply from the effects of monetary policy. Securitisation activity has also strengthened banks' capacity to supply new loans. This capacity, however, depends on business cycle conditions and, notably, on banks' risks positions. The recent credit crisis is instructive in this respect. Asset securitisation Bank lending channel Monetary policy...|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates whether bank {{integration}} {{measured by}} cross-border bank flows can capture the co-movements across housing markets {{in developed countries}} by using a spatial dynamic panel model. The transmission can occur through a global banking channel in which global banks intermediate wholesale funding to local banks. Changes in financial conditions are passed across borders through the banks’ balance-sheet exposure to <b>credit,</b> currency, <b>maturity,</b> and funding risks resulting in house price spillovers. While controlling for country-level and global factors, we find significant co-movement across housing markets of countries with proportionally high bank integration. Bank integration can better capture house price co-movements than other measures of economic integration. Once we account for bank exposure, other spatial linkages traditionally used to account for return co-movements across region – such as trade, foreign direct investment, portfolio investment, geographic proximity, etc. – become insignificant. Moreover, {{we find that the}} co-movement across housing markets decreases for countries with less developed mortgage markets characterized by fixed mortgage rate contracts, low limits of loan-to-value ratios and no mortgage equity withdrawal...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{measures of}} emerging market credit spreads for the 1990 s, {{based on data}} on new bond issues and bank loans, that cover {{a broader range of}} borrowers than the Brady bond spreads most commonly used to date. These measures are used to identify the impacts of <b>credit</b> ratings, <b>maturity</b> and currency denomination on spreads. We find important regional differences in spreads across the developing world, even after controlling for risk and maturity. We also identify the evolution of spreads during the 1990 s up until the advent of the Asian financial crisis, holding other determinants constant, and find that emerging market spreads declined by more than can be explained by improvements in risk. However, for emerging market instruments with relatively favourable credit ratings, trends in spreads differed considerably from those experienced by Brady bonds. Finally, and in contrast to much market commentary, we find that variations in industrial country short-term interest rates explain relatively little of the decline in emerging market bond spreads. Longer-term trends, perhaps reflecting globalisation, along with the temporary impact of the Mexican financial crisis, may have been more important factors in the behaviour of emerging market spreads. ...|$|R
