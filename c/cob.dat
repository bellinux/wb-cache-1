5|$|In {{the regions}} of Saint-Lo and Cotentin, the Norman <b>Cob</b> was {{widespread}} in agricultural uses until 1950, and the population continued to increase {{in the first half}} of the 20th century, even through the occupation during World War II. Even the Percheron, which was internationally recognized as the Norman draft horse, was not as popular in the homeland of the Norman <b>Cob</b> breed. In 1945, Norman <b>Cob</b> stallions accounted for 40% of the conscripted horses, and in 1950 a studbook was created for the breed.|$|E
5|$|Like all French draft breeds, the Norman <b>Cob</b> was {{threatened}} by the advent of mechanization in farming. The only option left to many breeders was to redirect their production to the meat markets. However, the Norman <b>Cob</b> avoided this, {{through the efforts of}} Laurens St. Martin, the head of the Saint-Lo stud in 1944 and the developer of the Selle Francais. He began crossing Thoroughbred stallions with Norman <b>Cob</b> mares to produce Selle Francais horses, and the success of this program allowed a reorientation of the <b>Cob</b> breeding programs. Although population numbers continued to decline until 1995, the physical characteristics of the breed remained much the same, not growing heavier and slower as many of the French draft breeds did due to breeding for the production of meat. Even today, some Selle Francais from Norman bloodlines are similar to the Norman <b>Cob</b> in appearance.|$|E
40|$|We {{previously}} generated separate {{lines of}} transgenic mice that specifically overexpress either the Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF- 2) {{low molecular weight}} isoform (TgLMW) or the high molecular weight isoforms (TgHMW) in the osteoblast lineage. Vector/control (TgVector) mice were also made. Here we report use of isolated calvarial osteoblasts (<b>COBs)</b> from those mice to investigate whether the FGF- 2 protein isoforms differentially modulate bone formation in vitro. Our hypothesis states that FGF- 2 isoforms specifically modulate bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP- 2) function and subsequently, bone differentiation genes and their related signaling pathways. We found {{a significant increase in}} alkaline phosphatase (ALP) positive colonies in TgLMW <b>COBs</b> compared with TgVector controls. BMP- 2 treatment significantly increased mineralized colonies in TgVector and TgLMW <b>COBs.</b> BMP- 2 caused a further significant increase in mineralized colonies in TgLMW <b>COBs</b> compared with TgVector <b>COBs</b> but did not increase ALP positive colonies in TgHMW <b>COBs.</b> Time course studies showed that BMP- 2 caused a sustained increase in SMAD 1 / 5 / 8, Runx- 2, and Osterix protein in TgLMW <b>COBs.</b> BMP- 2 caused a sustained increase in phospho-p 38 MAP kinase in TgVector but only a transient increase in TgLMW and TgHMW <b>COBs.</b> BMP- 2 caused a transient increase in phospho-p 44 / 42 MAP kinase in TgVector <b>COBs,</b> no increase in TgLMW <b>COBs</b> but a sustained increase was found in TgHMW <b>COBs.</b> Basal expression of FGF receptor 1 (FGFR 1) protein was significantly increased in TgLMW <b>COBs</b> relative to TgVector <b>COBs</b> and, while BMP- 2 caused a transient increase in FGFR 1 expression in TgVector <b>COBs</b> and TgHMW <b>COBs,</b> there was no further increase TgLMW <b>COBs.</b> Interestingly, while basal expression of FGF receptor 2 (FGFR 2) was similar in <b>COBs</b> from all genotypes, BMP- 2 treatment caused a sustained increase in TgLMW <b>COBs</b> but decreased FGFR 2 in TgVector COBS and TgHMW <b>COBs...</b>|$|R

5000|$|<b>Cobs</b> are the {{original}} [...] "treasure coins." [...] Struck and trimmed by {{hand in the}} 16th through 18th centuries at Spanish mints in Mexico, Peru, and Colombia (among others), silver and gold <b>cobs</b> are handsomely crude, nearly all with a cross as the central feature {{on one side and}} either a coat-of-arms (shield) or a tic-tac-toe-like [...] "pillars and waves" [...] on the other side. Silver <b>cobs</b> are known as [...] "reales" [...] and gold <b>cobs</b> are known as [...] "escudos,", with two 8 reales (about 27 grams each) equaling one escudo. Some <b>cobs</b> were struck with a date, and most show a mintmark and an initial or monogram for the assayer, the mint official who was responsible for weight and fineness. Size and shape were immaterial, which means that most <b>cobs</b> are far from round or uniform in thickness. <b>Cobs</b> were generally accepted as good currency all around the world, and were the exact coins pirates referred to as [...] "pieces of eight" [...] (8 reales) and [...] "doubloons" [...] (any gold <b>cobs</b> but originally 2 escudos). Their design and history have made <b>cobs</b> a very popular choice for jewelry.|$|R
5|$|The Norman <b>Cob</b> is {{also used}} for riding, and {{may be used for}} most equestrian disciplines. It is {{particularly}} well suited for vaulting. Elderly and nervous riders often appreciate the breed's calm temperament. Lighter Cobs can be used for mounted hunts. Crosses between the Norman <b>Cob</b> and Thoroughbred continue to be made to create saddle horses, generally with 25 to 50 percent <b>Cob</b> blood. Some Norman Cobs are bred for the meat market. The breed is sometimes preferred by butchers because of the lighter carcass weight and increased profitability over the Thoroughbred, {{while at the same time}} retaining meat similar in flavor and appearance to that of the Thoroughbred.|$|E
5|$|The Normandy {{region of}} France {{is well known}} for its horse breeding, having also {{produced}} the Percheron and French Trotter.

The two materials were combined at mixing percentages of 90 : 10, 70 : 30 and 50 : 50 (C. pentandra/maize <b>cobs).</b> Briquettes wereproduced using a laboratory hydraulic press. Compacting pressure was varied from 20 to 50  MPa at an interval of 10  MPa. The results indicated that therelaxed density of briquettes produced from particles of maize <b>cobs</b> only rangedfrom 541 to 659  kg/m 3 whilst that made from a mixture of maizecobs and C. pentandra ranged from 565 to 774  kg/m 3.Compressive strength in cleft of briquettes produced from maize <b>cobs</b> only rangedfrom 0.12 to 0.54  N/mm whilst that produced {{from a combination of}} maizecobs and C. pentandra ranged from 7.72 to 59.22  N/mm.Additionally, at all compacting pressure levels, briquettes made from maize cobsonly had an impact resistance index of 0 %.

5|$|The modern Norman <b>Cob</b> is {{slightly}} heavier {{than it was}} in the early 20th century, due to lighter horses of the breed being absorbed into the Selle Francais breed. In 1976, the National Stud at Saint-Lo had 186 stallions, including 60 Norman Cobs. In the same year, the breed registry was reorganized, and the Norman <b>Cob</b> placed in the draft horse category. The reorganization of the breed registry helped to reinvigorate Norman <b>Cob</b> breeding, and to bring attention to the risk of extinction of the breed. In 1980, the Institut national de la recherche agronomique and Institut national agronomique performed demographic and genetic analysis of threatened breeds of horses within France. In 1982, researchers concluded that the Norman <b>Cob</b> has been inbred and suffered genetic drift from its original population. The increasing average age of Norman <b>Cob</b> breeders also made the breed's situation precarious.|$|E
5|$|Today, Norman Cobs {{are mainly}} {{found in the}} {{departments}} of Manche, Calvados and Orne, which form {{the area where the}} breed was originally developed. The region of Saint-Lo, which ranks first in the production of Norman Cobs, represents 35 percent of new births. The Norman <b>Cob</b> is also present around the Haras de la Vendee (Stud at Vendee), which represents 25 percent of births, the Haras du Pin and in central Massif. In 2004, there were just over 600 French breeders of the Norman <b>Cob,</b> and in 2005, 914 Norman <b>Cob</b> mares were bred, with 65 stallions recorded as active in France. In recent years, the number of Norman Cobs has remained relatively stable. In 2011, there were 319 Norman <b>Cob</b> births in France, and numbers of annual births between 1992 and 2010 ranged between 385 and 585.|$|E
5|$|Enthusiasts {{worked to}} reorient the breed towards driving and {{recreation}} pursuits, and since 1982 have again reorganized the breed association. In 1992, a new studbook {{was created for}} the breed, with new selection criteria designed to preserve {{the quality of the}} breed, particularly its gaits. The latest editions of the breed registry and studbook are controlled by the Syndicat national des éleveurs et utilisateurs de chevaux <b>Cob</b> normand (SNEUCCN, National Union of Farmers and Users of Normandy <b>Cob</b> Horses), based in Tessy-sur-Vire. The association works to preserve and promote the breed throughout France, focusing especially on Normandy, Vendee and Anjou. In 1994, Normandy contained 2000 Percheron and Norman <b>Cob</b> horses, and annually bred around 600 foals of these two breeds. This included approximately half of the Norman Cobs bred in France.|$|E

5|$|In 1901 English and Welsh breeders {{established}} a breeders' association, the Welsh Pony and <b>Cob</b> Society, {{and the first}} stud book was published in 1902. It was decided that the Welsh Stud Book should be separated into sections divided by type and height. Welsh Ponies were originally only classified as Section A, but in 1931, with the rising demand for riding ponies for children, Section B was added. In the first stud books, the Section B was the Welsh Pony of <b>Cob</b> Type, and the Welsh <b>Cob</b> was Section C and Section D. The upper height limit for Section D Cobs was removed in 1907 and in 1931 Sections C and D were combined as simply Section C. The current standards of Cobs as Sections C and D were finalised in 1949. Until the mid 20th century, the British War Office considered the Welsh <b>Cob</b> so valuable that they paid premiums to the best stallions. After World War II, only three stallions were registered in Section C, but numbers have since recovered.|$|E

5|$|Rio de Janeiro's {{bidding process}} began on July 28, 2006, when the Executive Council of the Brazilian Olympic Committee (<b>COB</b> in the Portuguese acronym) met to {{consider}} the possibility of nominating a Brazilian city to host the 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics. This meeting was prompted by the fact that several cities in the world demonstrated interest around the election, some having already announced their bidding intention. Then a technical analysis was commissioned by <b>COB</b> to evaluate the conditions of the city, unveiled on August 25, 2006. A week later, on September 1, 2006, the COB's Annual Assembly decided by acclamation that Rio de Janeiro would be the Brazilian representative seeking to host the Olympic and Paralympic Games in 2016. The Assembly felt it was the only city in Brazil and South America which would possess Olympic-level facilities ready for an Olympic and Paralympic bid, a legacy of its upcoming hosting of the XV Pan American Games in 2007, later considered to be the best in history. Another positive aspect was that Rio de Janeiro could host all Olympic sports within the city limits, although the Olympic football tournament is hosted by multiple cities. The Brazilian government immediately expressed its support to the bid. Carlos Arthur Nuzman, president of <b>COB,</b> and César Maia, then Mayor of Rio de Janeiro, approved the decision, thus making the bid official.|$|E
40|$|Summary. The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to evaluate sweet corn kernels cutting from the <b>cobs</b> for the processing purposes.

Before freezing <b>cobs</b> were blanched in boiling water for 2 minutes and dried. Mesh analysis showed that cutting in variant I was affected by an increase of mesh fractions on the sieves of 6 and 8 mm holes as well as decrease on the sieves of 2 and 4 mm holes. A drop of share of inferior kernels quality and increased demand for energy during cutting were observed. Key words: sweet corn, freezing, cutting, mesh analysis, demand for energy...|$|R

5|$|The Norman <b>Cob</b> or <b>Cob</b> Normand is a {{breed of}} light draft horse that {{originated}} {{in the province of}} Normandy in northern France. It is a mid-sized horse, with a range of heights and weights, due to selective breeding {{for a wide range of}} uses. Its conformation is similar to a robust Thoroughbred, and it more closely resembles a Thoroughbred cross than other French draft breeds. The breed is known for its lively, long-striding trot. Colors accepted by the breed registry include chestnut, bay and seal brown. There are three general subsets within the breed: horses used under saddle, those used in harness, and those destined for meat production. They are popular for recreational and competitive driving, representing France internationally in the latter, and are also used for several riding disciplines.|$|E
5|$|The {{advent of}} {{mechanization}} threatened all French draft breeds, and while many draft breeders turned their production towards the meat market, Norman <b>Cob</b> breeders instead crossed their horses with Thoroughbreds {{to contribute to}} the fledgling Selle Francais breed, now France's national saddle horse. This allowed the Norman <b>Cob</b> to remain relatively the same through the decades, while other draft breeds were growing heavier and slower due to selection for meat. Between the 1970s and 1990s, the studbook went through several changes, and in the 1980s, genetic studies were performed that showed the breed suffered from inbreeding and genetic drift. Breed enthusiasts worked to develop new selection criteria for breeding stock, and population numbers are now relatively stable. Today, Norman Cobs are mainly found in the departments of Manche, Calvados and Orne.|$|E

5|$|At {{the very}} {{beginning}} of the 20th century, the Carrossier Normand was considered the best carriage horses available. The arrival of automobiles, and corresponding decline in demand for carriage horses, coincided with a split in the breed. A distinction was made between the lighter, faster horses in the breed, used for sport, and larger horses, used for agricultural work. The lighter horses eventually became the French Trotter (for driving) and Anglo-Norman (for riding and cavalry), while the heavier horses became the Norman <b>Cob.</b> In 1912, when French horse populations were at their highest, there were 422 stallions at the Saint-Lo stud, mainly cobs and trotters. When the original Carrossier Normand became extinct in the 1920s, breeding focused on the two remaining types, with the Norman <b>Cob</b> continuing to be used for farming and the Anglo-Norman being used to create the Selle Francais, the national French sport horse.|$|E
