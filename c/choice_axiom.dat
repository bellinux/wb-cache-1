40|$|This article {{presents}} an axiomatic {{analysis of the}} best choice decision problem from a reflexive crisp binary relation on a finite set (a digraph). With respect to a transitive digraph, optimality and maximality are usually accepted as the best fitted <b>choice</b> <b>axioms</b> to the intuitive notion of best choice. However, beyond transitivity (resp. acyclicity), optimality and maximality can characterise distinct choice sets (resp. empty sets). Accordingly, different and rather unsatisfying concepts have appeared, such as von Neumann-Morgenstern domination, weak transitive closure and kernels. Here, we investigate a new family of eight <b>choice</b> <b>axioms</b> for digraphs: relative <b>choice</b> <b>axioms.</b> Within <b>choice</b> theory, these <b>axioms</b> generalise top-cycle for tournaments, gocha, getcha and rational top-cycle for complete digraphs. We present their main properties such as existence, uniqueness, idempotence, internal structure, and cross comparison. We then show their strong relationship with optimality and maximality when the latter are not empty. Otherwise, these axioms identify a non-empty choice set and underline conflicts between chosen elements in strict preference circuits. Finally, we exploit the close link between this family and transitive closures to compute choice sets in linear time, followed by a relevant practical application.

50|$|Kurt Gödel {{simplified}} Bernays' theory {{by making}} every set a class, which {{allowed him to}} use just one sort for classes and one membership primitive.

5000|$|Von Neumann {{approached}} this consistency {{problem by}} first replacing the axiom of limitation of size {{with two of}} its consequences—namely, replacement and the choice axiom: [...] "Every relation R has a subclass which is a function and has the same domain as R." [...] This axiom {{is equivalent to the}} axiom of global choice. Next, he proved that if this weaker axiom system is consistent, it remains consistent after adding the axiom of regularity. This produces the axiom system that (after modifications by Bernays and Gödel) would become NBG. Finally, he showed that this axiom system implies the axiom of limitation of size. Therefore, his 1925 axiom system is relatively consistent with an axiom system that is closer to ZFC—the major remaining differences are that this system uses classes and its <b>choice</b> <b>axiom</b> is stronger.|$|E

40|$|This {{survey is}} divided into three major sections. The first {{concerns}} mathematical results about the <b>choice</b> <b>axiom</b> and the choice models that devoIve from it. For example, its relationship to Thurstonian theory is satisfyingly understood; much is known about how choice and ranking probabilities may relate, although little of this knowledge seems empirically useful; and there are certain interesting statistical facts. The second section describes attempts that have been made to test and apply these models. The testing has been done mostly, though not exclusively, by psychologists; the applications have been mostly in economics and sociology. Although it is clear from many experiments that the conditions under which the <b>choice</b> <b>axiom</b> holds are surely delicate, the need for simple, rational underpinnings in complex theories, as in economics and sociology, leads one to accept assumptions that are at best approximate.

This research challenges this assumption and demonstrates that preferences for risky options are constructed contingent on which other options constitute {{the decision maker}} 2 ̆ 7 s choice set, and {{the context of the}} decision making situation. This leads to systematic violations of normative <b>choice</b> <b>axioms</b> thereby leading to inefficient choice. Expertise in evaluating risky options may mitigate these effects in certain domains, but may exacerbate choice inefficiency in others. Also, as expected, situational ambiguity and complexity exacerbate these effects. Priming participants into an affective problem-solving mode also enhances menu-dependence.
