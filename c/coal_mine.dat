In October, 1971, the Coking <b>Coal</b> <b>Mines</b> (Emergency Provisions) Act, 1971 provided for taking over in public interest of the management of coking <b>coal</b> <b>mines</b> and coke oven plants pending nationalization. This was followed by the Coking <b>Coal</b> <b>Mines</b> (Nationalization) Act, 1972 under which the coking <b>coal</b> <b>mines</b> and the coke oven plants other than those with the Tata Iron & Steel Company Limited and Indian Iron & Steel Company Limited, were nationalized on May 1, 1972 and brought under the Bharat Coking Coal Limited (BCCL), a new Central Government Undertaking. Another enactment, namely the <b>Coal</b> <b>Mines</b> (Taking Over of Management) Act, 1973, extended the right of the Government of India to take over the management of the coking and non-coking <b>coal</b> <b>mines</b> in seven States including the coking <b>coal</b> <b>mines</b> taken over in 1971. This was followed by the nationalization of all these mines on May 1, 1973 with the enactment of the <b>Coal</b> <b>Mines</b> (Nationalization) Act, 1973 which now is the piece of Central legislation determining the eligibility of <b>coal</b> <b>mining</b> in India.|$|R
