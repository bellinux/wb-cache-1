5|$|The {{blackcurrant}} leaf midge {{can cause}} browning, crimping and distortion of leaves at {{the tips of}} shoots but it is seldom a serious problem. The blackcurrant sawfly (Nematus ribesii) lays its eggs {{on the underside of}} the leaves and the voracious larvae work their way along the shoots, stripping off leaf after leaf. In a serious attack, the bush can be denuded of leaves. Larvae of the <b>currant</b> <b>borer</b> drill their way along the centres of shoots, which wilt and die back. Other insect pests include scale insects, aphids and earwigs.|$|E

40|$|The <b>currant</b> shoot <b>borer,</b> Lampronia capitella (Lep., Prodoxidae), is an {{important}} pest of currants, Ribes spp., in northern Europe. Oviposition was studied in cage experiments and the flight period was monitored in field studies using pheromone-baited traps. Blackcurrant, Ribes nigrum, was the host species in both studies. The total egg supply of females was on average 107 eggs and oviposition started 2 - 5 days after emergence. About 60 % of the eggs were laid during {{the first day of}} the oviposition period. Eggs were laid in currant fruitlets, in batches comprising several, usually four to seven eggs. The flight period started shortly after the end of the flowering period of blackcurrant, and lasted for about 3 weeks...|$|R
50|$|Prodoxidae are {{a family}} of {{primitive}} monotrysian Lepidoptera. Some of these small-to-medium sized moths are day flying, like Lampronia capitella, known to European gardeners as the <b>currant</b> shoot <b>borer.</b> Others occur in Africa and Asia. The other common genera are generally confined to dry areas of the United States. Tetragma gei feeds on mountain avens (Geum triflorum) in the US. Greya politella lay eggs in the flowers of Saxifragaceae there. Prodoxoides asymmetra occurs in Chile and Argentina (Nielsen and Davis, 1985), but all other prodoxid moth genera have a northern distribution. The enigmatic genus Tridentaforma is sometimes placed here and assumed {{to be close to}} Lampronia, while other authors consider it incertae sedis among the closely related family Adelidae.|$|R
40|$|Background: Moths {{have evolved}} highly {{successful}} mating systems, relying on species-specific mixtures of sex pheromone components for long-distance mate communication. Acyl-CoA desaturases are key enzymes in the biosynthesis of these compounds {{and to a}} large extent they account for the great diversity of pheromone structures in Lepidoptera. A novel desaturase gene subfamily that displays Delta 11 catalytic activities has been highlighted to account for most of the unique pheromone signatures of the taxonomically advanced ditrysian species. To assess the mechanisms driving pheromone evolution, information is needed about the signalling machinery of primitive moths. The <b>currant</b> shoot <b>borer,</b> Lampronia capitella, is the sole reported primitive non-ditrysian moth known to use unsaturated fatty-acid derivatives as sex-pheromone. By combining biochemical and molecular approaches we elucidated the biosynthesis paths of its main pheromone component, the (Z,Z) - 9, 11 -tetradecadien- 1 -ol and bring new insights into the time point of the recruitment of the key Delta 11 -desaturase gene subfamily in moth pheromone biosynthesis. Results: The reconstructed evolutionary tree of desaturases evidenced two ditrysian-specific lineages (the Delta 11 and Delta 9 (18 C> 16 C)) to have orthologs in the primitive moth L. capitella despite being absent in Diptera and other insect genomes. Four acyl-CoA desaturase cDNAs were isolated from the pheromone gland, three of which are related to Delta 9 -desaturases whereas the fourth cDNA clusters with Delta 11 -desaturases. We demonstrated that this transcript (Lca-KPVQ) exclusively accounts for both steps of desaturation involved in pheromone biosynthesis. This enzyme possesses a Z 11 -desaturase activity that allows transforming the palmitate precursor (C 16 : 0) into (Z) - 11 -hexadecenoic acid and the (Z) - 9 -tetradecenoic acid into the conjugated intermediate (Z, Z) - 9, 11 -tetradecadienoic acid. Conclusion: The involvement of a single Z 11 -desaturase in pheromone biosynthesis of a non-ditrysian moth species, supports that the duplication event leading to the origin of the Lepidoptera-specific Delta 11 -desaturase gene subfamily took place before radiation of ditrysian moths and their divergence from other heteroneuran lineages. Our findings uncover that this novel class of enzymes affords complex combinations of unique unsaturated fatty acyl-moieties of variable chain-lengths, regio- and stereo-specificities since early in moth history and contributes a notable innovation in the early evolution of moth-pheromones...|$|R
