500|$|A {{motorway}} connecting Zagreb and Split {{was designed}} in the early 1970s, and a public loan was started in order to collect sufficient funds for its construction. However, due to political upheavals in Croatia and Yugoslavia, construction of the motorway was labeled a [...] "nationalist project" [...] and cancelled in 1971. After Croatian independence and conclusion of the Croatian War of Independence, efforts to build the motorway were renewed and construction started in 2000. The Zagreb–Split section of the route was completed by 2005, while the first sections between Split and Dubrovnik opened in 2007 and 2008. Construction costs incurred so far amount to 3 billion euro. The figure includes funds approved for construction work scheduled {{to be completed by}} 2013. On the other hand, the amount does not include construction <b>cost</b> <b>related</b> to Lučko–Bosiljevo2 section since that section was funded as a part of Rijeka–Zagreb motorway construction project through Autocesta Rijeka–Zagreb, current operator of that sector.
