40|$|DE 102006030273 A 1 UPAB: 20080128 NOVELTY - The {{receiving}} device (180) has an optical inlet (110), a fiber-optical plate (100), which is arranged at the optical inlet. An image sensor (170) and optics (130) represent a real picture at an optical outlet (120) of the fiber-optical {{plate on the}} image sensor in a pre-determined measuring unit. The {{receiving device}} has cassette housing with an opening, which forms the optical inlet of the receiving device.

50|$|When still cameras using 35 mm film, {{originally}} {{used for}} cinematography, were introduced they were widely known as miniature cameras to distinguish {{them from the}} then commonplace rollfilm cameras.

50|$|At long last, Rollei had {{a camera}} that could match the Hasselbad 500C. Indeed, {{had it been}} {{released}} earlier, around 1960 say, {{it could have been}} enormously successful. On top of that, despite declining profit margins and tough competition from the Japanese, Rollei continued to target its advertising at the amateur market. In contrast, other companies such as Leitz and Hasselblad had better understood how to promote their expensive cameras in photographic magazines - not just through paid advertising, but also through feature articles in the editorial pages. As a result, the SL66 never sold in the numbers that the company had hoped for or needed. Nevertheless, Rollei owes its survival as a company to the SL66 camera system, along with its enduring reputation for quality. Its successor, the SL66E, was released in 1984; externally the camera was largely unchanged, but it now had a built-in light meter. Additional lenses were released, such as the Fisheye-Distagon (f/3.5, 30 mm), the Distagon (f/4, 40 mm), and the Sonnar (f/4, 150 mm) with a between-the-lens shutter along with more accessories including close-up lenses, extension bellows, a Polaroid <b>film</b> <b>cassette,</b> a sheet <b>film</b> <b>cassette,</b> an underwater housing, and a ring flash unit. Its successor, the SL66-X, released in 1968 only had TTL flash metering, while the SL66-SE (Special Edition) also included a standard light meter. Prior to this, TTL metering required a special prism viewfinder with a built-in light meter. The release in 1992 of the SE Exclusive Professional incorporating selective gold-plating on the housing marked the end of the SL66 series.|$|R
