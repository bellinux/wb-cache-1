40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{boundaries}} between, {{on the one}} hand, controlled operations and activities under Chapter 5 of the Police Powers and Responsibilities Act 2000 (Qld) and, on the other hand, entrapment of a kind liable {{to lead to the}} exclusion of evidence. ‘Entrapment’ involves improper facilitation or inducement of an offence for the purpose of obtaining evidence for its prosecution. Chapter 5 was designed primarily to authorise participation in otherwise unlawful activities during <b>covert</b> <b>investigations,</b> and thereby to avoid evidence being excluded on the ground that the offence committed to obtain evidence was disproportionate to the offence to be prosecuted. It is, however, still possible for evidence to be excluded because an improper mode of facilitation or inducement was used or because the target of the investigation was selected in an improper way. The article examines the scope for either of these other forms of entrapment to occur following the enactment of Chapter 5...|$|R

Integrity agencies include the range of agencies that have oversight across the sector, including Ombudsman offices, Auditors General, Public Sector Commissions, Information Commissioners and offices that focus on anti corruption processes, these include: ICAC (NSW), CCC (WA), ICAC (SA), IBAC (Vic), CMC (Qld) and IC(Tas.) and the Australian Government also began developing a National Anti-Corruption Plan in 2011 (Australian Government 2011). As agencies that specialise in scrutinising the behaviour of public figures, they constitute a form of accountability that is integral to the processes of modern democratic practice.

For all integrity and oversight agencies however, these powers can result in tensions between the integrity agency, the parliament, the public sector and the broader community. In some cases the tension exists around jurisdiction, such as between police and the integrity agency (Brown and Head 2005); for others, the tensions reside in relationship between parliamentary privilege and the investigative powers of integrity bodies (Sheen 2012); for the broader community however, tensions can result from legislation that authorises the covert intrusion into citizens' lives...|$|R

40|$|The {{whole world}} is in some way {{affected}} by terrorism. It has many faces, different causes, and comes about by distinct ways around the globe. As a consequence, in the Brazilian Tri-border Area (TBA) terrorism has its own characteristics. In the TBA, terrorist groups are focused on supporting activities for their organizations. The problems related to terrorism in the TBA are connected with the struggle between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East. Terrorist groups, such as Hezbollah and HAMAS, have operatives in the TBA {{in order to raise}} money and provide logistics to support their groups. In addition, these supporting activities are, as a rule, criminal efforts. So in the TBA, the best statecraft instrument to combat terrorism is law enforcement. In the Triple Frontier crime is the center of gravity for terrorism, and, as a consequence, the police are the most capable agency to deal with this situation. They can better prosecute organizations that perpetrate crimes to support terrorist groups. Hence, Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay must develop a strategic law enforcement approach to combat terrorism, based on ends, ways and means, with emphasis on police intelligence operations and <b>covert</b> criminal <b>investigations.</b> Federal Police Commissioner, Brazilian Federal Police author (civilian) ...|$|R

"This research used an integrated approach {{to investigate the}} research participants' attitudes to standard Arabic, colloquial Arabic and English, and also to examine how the participants actually used these language varieties. In addition, the study aimed to gain an insight into the factors behind such attitudes. The integrated design of the research included a questionnaire to investigate participants' conscious attitudes, a matched guise test to examine their subconscious attitudes, and a focus group protocol to examine the factors behind these attitudes. The research population {{was based on a}} random cluster sample of Saudi male undergraduate students at King Saud University. About 260 students took part in the questionnaire and the matched guise test and 17 participants were involved in the focus group protocol. In regard to actual use, the findings showed that standard Arabic and English were 'rarely' used in comparison to colloquial Arabic which was found 'always' to be used, particularly in social interactions. Although the use of standard Arabic was rare, it was used more in the media than in social interactions and in education. Remarkably, the research participants were of the opinion that they used English more than they used standard Arabic. An additional surprising finding was that colloquial Arabic was used widely in informal written discourse. Broadly speaking, the overall results from both the overt and <b>covert</b> <b>investigations</b> of attitudes were similar. While the findings revealed that the participants clearly had a positive attitude to English, their attitudes to the two varieties of Arabic were found to be similar but less positive than their attitude to English. However, in some statements it was found that attitudes were different based on the level of consciousness. That is, whereas the participants overtly agreed that standard Arabic was superior to colloquial Arabic and English, the outcome of the indirect investigation revealed that subconsciously they believed that English was superior. In the direct investigation {{it was found that the}} participants generally had a positive attitude to standard Arabic in all three aspects of attitude: knowledge, emotion and action. This attitude was positively influenced by religious, linguistic and cultural factors. The participants strongly believed that using standard Arabic was important because it is the language of the Qur'an. On the other hand, the participants had a positive attitude to colloquial Arabic for both emotion and action, although their attitude to colloquial Arabic was negative for knowledge. These views had been constructed by the influence of several linguistic, social and cultural factors. It was found that participants had a common belief about the simplicity of colloquial Arabic. As for social factors, the acquisition of colloquial Arabic is an aspect that the participants recognised had positively influenced their attitudes. The knowledge aspect of attitude to colloquial Arabic has been negatively affected by its impact on Arabic culture, identity and pan-Arabism. English was evaluated positively for knowledge, emotion and action. The findings revealed several linguistic, social and instrumental factors behind the participants' favourable attitude to English, including self-image, the prestige associated with using English, and the occupational opportunities afforded by knowledge of English. In the investigation of subconscious attitudes to language, the standard Arabic guises were evaluated positively for both competence and personal integrity but negatively for social attractiveness, which may have been affected by the position of standard Arabic as a high variety of the language used in formal settings. On the other hand, the colloquial Arabic guises received a positive assessment for both social attractiveness and personal integrity but was viewed negatively for competence, due to its position as a low variety of the language. The English guise commonly received a positive judgment for competence and personal integrity but the evaluation was slightly negative for social attractiveness. The results of the investigation into the participants' conscious and subconscious attitudes have implications for language planning in Saudi Arabia. " [...] Abstract.

40|$|Background. Despite recent {{evidence}} suggesting that some severely brain-injured patients retain some capacity for topdown processing (covert cognition), the degree of sparing is unknown. Objective. Top-down attentional processing was assessed in patients in minimally conscious (MCS) and vegetative states (VS) using an active event-related potential (ERP) paradigm. Methods. A total of 26 patients were included (38 ± 12 years old, 9 traumatic, 21 patients > 1 year postonset) : 8 MCS+, 8 MCS−, and 10 VS patients. There were 14 healthy controls (30 ± 8 years old). The ERP paradigm included (1) a passive condition and (2) an active condition, wherein the participant was instructed to voluntarily focus attention on his/her own name. In each condition, the participant’s own name was presented 100 times (ie, 4 blocks of 25 stimuli). Results. In 5 MCS+ patients {{as well as in}} 3 MCS− patients and 1 VS patient, an enhanced P 3 amplitude was observed in the active versus passive condition. Relative to controls, patients showed a response that was (1) widely distributed over frontoparietal areas and (2) not present in all blocks (3 of 4). In patients with covert cognition, the amplitude of the response was lower in frontocentral electrodes compared with controls but did not differ from that in the MCS+ group. Conclusion. The results indicate that volitional top-down attention is impaired in patients with <b>covert</b> cognition. Further <b>investigation</b> is crucially needed to better understand top-down cognitive functioning in this population because this may help refine brain-computer interface–based communication strategies...|$|R
