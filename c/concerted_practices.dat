However, a coincidental increase in prices will not in itself prove a concerted practice, there must also be evidence that the parties involved were aware that their behaviour may prejudice the normal operation of the competition within the common market. This latter subjective requirement of knowledge is not, in principle, necessary in respect of agreements. As far as agreements are concerned the mere anticompetitive effect is sufficient to make it illegal even if the parties were unaware of it or did not intend such effect to take place.|$|E

40|$|Practice {{is one of}} the key {{concepts}} of our time. During the last 30 years, the Practice-Based Studies have spread all over the world. The “rediscovery” of practice has inspired many reflections and empirical researches, contributing to the recent development of the organizational and management studies. This article aims, on the one hand, to reconstruct the debate around the concept of practice and, on the other hand, discuss its meaning, as defined within the PBS. In this paper, it will be argued that practice should be conceived as a “radial concept”. This idea, coming from the political science, is the key to explore new universes of meaning and to read and compare the practitioners' activities, the functioning of organizations and the collective learning processes. The paper will introduce the phenomenon of the so-called Observatories of Civil Justice. These interprofessional communities represent a unique window on the Italian judicial system.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examines}} {{the impact of}} several industry characteristics on the propensity to collude using a dataset {{on the existence of}} collusion across Dutch industries during the late 1990 s and early 2000 s. The results of the Probit model with sample selection indicate that our sample of Dutch <b>concerted</b> <b>practices</b> is non-random {{in the sense that it}} only consists of anti-competitive agreements that were subject of an antitrust immunity behavior. Our bivariate probit model with sample selection indicates that <b>concerted</b> <b>practices</b> are less likely to be seen in service industries relative to manufacturing industries. The results also show that it is more likely that firms engaged in <b>concerted</b> <b>practices</b> in unconcentrated industries. Furthermore, we could not find a non-linear relationship between concentration and the presence of collusion. There is also strong evidence from all the regressions that <b>concerted</b> <b>practices</b> are less likely in industries where entry is more possible. Interestingly, our estimation results indicate that there is a positive correlation between cartel prevalence and import penetration, which implies that import competition did not discipline firm behavior and foreign importers joined the cartel paradise in the Netherlands. As to the role of measures of asymmetry on concerted practice prevalence, the association between patenting activity and propensity to engage in collusion is ambiguous in the current setting, while advertising intensity, as the second measure of asymmetry, is associated with increased likelihood of collusion. Contrary to the previous empirical findings, market growth has been found to have a negative effect on the probability of a concerted practice in an industry. Furthermore, our proposition that growing demand might attract new entrants, which, in turn, hampers collusion, has been falsified in the current context. ...|$|E
40|$|In their {{economic}} activity, undertakings conclude many agreements between them. But {{agreements between undertakings}} which can distort the competition -anticompetitive agreements- are prohibited. The Romanian and EU law prohibit &# 39;all agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings and <b>concerted</b> <b>practices</b> which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition&# 39;. However, the terms &# 39;agreements&# 39;, &# 39;decisions&# 39; or &# 39;concerted practices&# 39; are nowhere defined in the EU Treaties or in the Romanian law. These terms are key concepts {{in the analysis of}} anticompetitive agreements which can distort the competition. In the lack of a legal definition, these concepts have generated a complex body of jurisprudence, which has to be identified. The analysis of these key concepts necessarily entails the conceptual delimitation of the notions. On this purpose, the relevant legal provisions will be identified in the Romanian and EU law, as well as the decisions of the European Court of Justice in this matter.

40|$|One of {{the results}} of the Harper Review is the {{insertion}} of a new form of cartel conduct into s 45 of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) ('CCA').

40|$|On several {{occasion}} the European Commission {{has come}} to examine reciprocal representation agreements under which the national collecting societies typically mandate to one another the management of their own repertories. Although it has not questioned {{the validity of the}} whole representation agreements, the Commission’s intervention highlighted the anti-competitive nature of the clauses and of the conclusive conduct aimed at preserving the existence of territorial barriers within the market and, therefore the existence of national monopolies which appeared to be no longer justifiable in light of the cross-border circulation of intellectual property and the new technologies that enable the remote monitoring of the actual use of said works. The CISAC case is particularly interesting because the General Court has partially reversed the Commission’s finding of art. 101 TFEU infringement by holding that collecting societies’ parallel conduct, allegedly aimed at partitioning the market, was not a <b>concerted</b> <b>practice</b> as it was justified by reasons related to a better enforcement of rights on a local level...|$|R

Approximately 50 percent of the expenses of small ISPs are local connection costs paid to the state-owned company controlling the market.

40|$|The {{competition}} {{represents a}} desirable {{state of the}} market in every society. Putting a lot of effort in trying to be better than each other, the competitors of the market, where there is a fair competition, contribute to making that market more advanced than the other one with the weaker competition. However it has become quite frequent to come across the violation of the competition in modern society. It is usually done by making different agreements or with explicit or tacit coordination of conduct on the market. Apart from these, there are many other ways for doing so, with the aim of getting certain benefits, especially making extra profit. In addition to that, there are some restrictions on the competition on oligopolistic markets too, yet, those markets are covered with different market forms which cannot be easily distinguished from the forbidden ones.

40|$|This article {{evaluates the}} {{allocation}} of the legal burden of proof in cases concerning the application of Article 101 TFEU, as prescribed by Article 2 of Regulation 1 / 2003 which provides that the Commission is responsible for establishing that an agreement or <b>concerted</b> <b>practice</b> constitutes a restriction of competition by object or effect, whereas {{it is for the}} undertakings to demonstrate the ‘defence’ of Article 101 (3) TFEU. The article investigates how this shared division of the legal burden instructs competition analysis under Article 101 TFEU and affects its enforcement; and secondly, whether such a bifurcated apportionment of the burden of persuasion respects the evidential prescriptions of the presumption of innocence. The analysis of these two questions yields the conclusion that shifting the legal burden of establishing the conditions of Article 101 (3) TFEU on the undertakings is prone to distort the substantive scope of Article 101 TFEU and increase the risk of over-enforcement, whilst it is also at odds with the presumption of innocence. On this basis, it is submitted that Article 2 of Regulation 1 / 2003 must be re-read as placing the whole legal burden on the Commission and imposing only an evidential burden on defendant undertakings...|$|R

Second, I shall elaborate on the structure of Article 101 TFEU. As a consequence of the "more economic approach" taken by the Commission and the repeal of the individual exemption system under Article 101 (3) TFEU, the distinction between the concept of object offences and the concept of effect offences is slowly disappearing while having detrimental implications for legal certainty. Moreover, the conceptual distinction between considerations of ancillary restraints under Article 101 (1) TFEU and consideration of pro-competitive and anti-competitive effects under Article 101 (3) TFEU is slowly disappearing as well.

40|$|The {{algorithm}} driven {{conduct of}} platform operators, as the expert handlers of big data, {{is starting to}} challenge {{the way in which}} competition law needs to be enforced. Businesses, especially platform operators, acquire data and particularly pricing information from other businesses in real-time. This leads to specific potential problems with autonomous actors engaged in algorithmic tacit collusion. These problems are compounded when usual legal tests for collusive price fixing require both a meeting of the minds of the colluding firms and a commitment to the price fixing conduct. It is not clear that bots meet either of these tests. The paper finds that price fixing is unethical using multiple analytical lenses but that the illegality of algorithmic tacit collusion is less clear. By considering the issues associated with <b>concerted</b> <b>practices</b> from a legal and ethical perspective, the paper charts some approaches that might be applied. It uses changes in competition law in Australia to highlight potential ways of dealing with algorithmic tacit collusion, but also highlights the potential unintended consequences associated with such changes...|$|E

Many social scientists claim that middle class parents <b>practice</b> <b>concerted</b> cultivation, meaning a child's life is filled with organized activities and social interactions with adults.

[...] On the other hand, many working class parents practice the accomplishment of natural growth, where children have more control over their free time and are exposed to fewer interactions with adults that are outside of the home.

40|$|The OECD Competition Committee debated {{competition}} in bidding markets in October 2006. Competition authorities {{become interested in}} auctions {{by a number of}} routes. In competition advocacy, they may advise other parts of government on how to design auctions in order to improve their efficiency—the degree of competition. They may evaluate mergers and agreements between firms that operate in auction markets. And they may be concerned with collusion and abuse of a dominant position in auctions. Because their formal rules reduce “noise” and make communication among rivals easier, auctions can promote collusion, compared with ordinary “posted-price” markets.

40|$|This thesis {{undertakes}} {{a critical}} {{assessment of a}} very topical and highly debated question {{in the development of}} EU competition law: does the European Merger Control Regulation apply to concentrations that result in collective (or joint respectively oligopolistic) dominance? And, if so, under what conditions?The study suggests that the Merger Control Regulation does, indeed, cover cases of collective dominance. It recommends, however, that a proposed transaction should only be blocked on grounds of collective dominance if it raises substantive doubts that the transaction will create an anti-competitive market structure (like, for example, the Gencor/Lonrho case). Should the doubts not attain the required level, then a two-stage approach is suggested. The first stage would have to screen the proposed transaction as being reasonably capable of guaranteeing a competitive environment (despite the initial doubts as to the collective dominance issue). The second stage would be opened only if the Commission has legitimate reasons to believe that the firms concerned are effectively involved in either <b>concerted</b> <b>practices</b> (Art. 85 EEC Treaty) or in a collective abuse of a dominant position (Art. 86). Interestingly, the Commission seems to have adopted a similar approach in some of the latest border-line cases. After an extensive analysis of the landmark decision Nestle/Perrier, this thesis finds that the described two-stage approach would also have been appropriate in this case...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} theorizes {{the dance}} career of Desmond Richardson through the related paradigms of race, gender, and sexuality {{in order to}} generate a socio-culturally nuanced understanding {{of the concept of}} virtuosity in performance. I have selected four distinct performance contexts of the 1990 s through which to analyze Richardson's contribution to ballet and contemporary dance. Keeping questions of identity in the foreground, I interrogate both the racialized and gendered politics of concert dance companies and the role of versatility in Richardson's career. Central to this dissertation are both the discourse of virtuosity and the mechanics of the production of virtuosity as a mode or quality. Richardson's virtuosity is especially distinct in its harnessing of multiple dance styles and techniques. Despite his overall signature style, one that privileges hybridity over singularity, Richardson knowingly emphasizes certain techniques in certain settings in order to respond to the call of the work in question. Richardson's concert dance career began at Alvin Ailey, and in 1994 he both co-founded Complexions and began dancing with Ballett Frankfurt. It was three years later that he embarked on ABT and SFB's Othello. The dissertation opens by questioning the relationship between the moving body and the photograph's supposed stillness. Through a reading of surface and stasis, it explores the status of labor as manifested in the particular photo-choreographic context of the Alvin Ailey poster. Placing dance studies into conversation with critical race studies and visual studies, I ask how skin, flesh, mutability, and labor coalesce to present or undermine a multicultural ideology. The chapter engages with Anne Anlin Cheng's concept of mutability, Vijay Prashad's discussion of AfroAsian identity and polyculturalism, Krista Thompson's notion of shine, and Elizabeth Grosz and Hortense Spillers' writing on flesh. The next chapter puts forward the concept of choreographic falsetto in analyzing the queer of color aesthetics of Complexions Contemporary Ballet. In locating the vernacular influences on ballet in Richardson and Dwight Rhoden's hybrid style, the chapter comes into conversation with Roderick Ferguson on queer of color analysis, Bettina Brandl-Risi and Gabrielle Bradstetter on virtuosity, André Lepecki on stillness, and Brenda Dixon Gottschild and Thomas DeFrantz on Africanist aesthetics. In thinking the role of virtuosity in terms of gender transgression, this chapter posits that hyperkinetic corporeal performance appears to be both a space of license, on the one hand, and a space of shame, on the other. I claim that virtuosity operates at [...] and blurs [...] the border between popular and high art, defining the location of the virtuoso's potential transgression. The third chapter engages with themes of visibility and authenticity in the blackface practices of American Ballet Theatre and San Francisco Ballet's Othello. To reconcile the production's use of blackface in the absence of Richardson in the title role, I turn to Linda Williams' theorization of melodrama to demonstrate how blackface and virtuosity continually complicate the (in) visibility of blackness in Othello. The final chapter, on Ballett Frankfurt, explores how Richardson and choreographer William Forsythe's combined modes of improvisation create a notable shift in their practices to a "black radical tradition. " I cite George Balanchine and Steve Paxton as influences on Forsythe. Richardson and Forsythe's collaboration collapses racial and choreographic signifiers, lingering in the difficult space of illegibility. Through <b>concerted</b> <b>practice,</b> such illegibility functions as a refiguring of the relationship between subjectivity and blackness. I trace the way Frankfurt dancers describe an otherwise modernist aesthetic of difficulty as "fun," ultimately positioning the body as the locale of choreographic and ontological agency. In doing so, I traverse the interval between what Forsythe calls a "[staging] of disappearance" and what Fred Moten refers to as the inevitably "improvisatory exteriority" of blackness...|$|R
40|$|Numerous {{normative}} {{models have}} been developed to determine optimal inventory levels, and several articles and case studies have been written about the <b>concerted</b> efforts and <b>practices</b> adopted by manufacturing firms in the United States to reduce inventories. But little is known about whether inventories have indeed decreased in U. S. manufacturing and whether such a decrease has been restricted to a few well-publicized firms or is true at an industry level. Using data published by the U. S. Census Bureau, the authors study trends in materials, work-in-process, and finished-goods inventory ratios during the period 1961 to 1994 in 20 manufacturing industry sectors and the total U. S. manufacturing sector to determine whether a significant decrease was seen in these ratios. Further, since a great deal of momentum for inventory reduction began in the early 1980 s, the authors investigate whether greater improvement was seen in the post- 1980 period as compared with the pre- 1980 period. We find that material and work-in-process inventories did decrease in a majority of the two-digit industry sectors from 1961 to 1994 and showed greater improvement in about half the sectors in the post- 1980 period relative to the pre- 1980 period. Finished-goods inventories did decrease in some industry sectors and increase in a few others but did not show a significant trend in more than half the sectors. Total manufacturing inventory ratios decreased from 1961 to 1994 at all three stages [...] -material, work-in-process, and finished goods. However, total manufacturing inventory ratios did not improve at a higher rate during the post- 1980 period as compared with the pre- 1980 period in any of the three stages. Overall, the analysis provides an encouraging but somewhat mixed picture about the results of U. S. manufacturing inventory-reduction efforts.

This assumption is explored through an interpretive examination of the fields of literature that are commonly identified as informing occupational therapy, supplemented by selected popular literature. The exploration takes a philosophical approach, guided by notions from philosophical hermeneutics, including pre-understandings, the hermeneutic circle and fusion of horizons. The conclusion reached is that people informed by Western philosophies interpret the identity meanings of objects in both rational and Romantic ways. To inform the study, the nature of rationalism and Romanticism are then explained, and the implications of these philosophical traditions in relation to objects and identity are teased out. This interpretation is guided by a history of ideas methodology, which entails approaching historical texts from a new perspective, in this case the identity meanings of objects. Thus informed, occupational therapy literature, primarily that published in Britain between 1938 and 1962 is examined from the perspective of objects and identity. What is revealed is that rational and Romantic understandings of objects, and of patients' and their own identity are clearly discernible. Such understandings afforded early occupational therapists both ways to organise their growing knowledge of the therapeutic application of crafts and the transformative outcomes of occupational therapy intervention. Gradually however, factors both internal and external to the profession served to undermine therapists' Romanticism. Primary amongst these were World War II, which saw a redeployment of occupational therapists from mental health to physical rehabilitation settings; advances in rehabilitative medicine, which brought a reduction in secondary complications and the adoption of teamwork; and the development of new practice areas including domestic rehabilitation using gadgets to enhance function and pre-vocational rehabilitation. As a result, tensions between rational and Romantic understandings crystallised around two long-standing controversies. These were whether or not craft equipment such as weaving looms should be adapted to serve specific remedial purposes, and whether it was the process of making a crafted object or the quality of the finished product that was more important. In the event, these contested ideologies became largely irrelevant as craftwork was sidelined from mainstream practice. With it, occupational therapists' Romantic vision of transforming people's lives through creative activity also slipped away. Several reasons for this loss of one of the profession's founding philosophies are proposed. They include the substantial absence of the professions' philosophical foundations from its education, and the paucity of theory and research methodologies that might have informed the nature and process of transformative change that earlier occupational therapists had observed and reported. The thesis concludes by arguing for the importance of recovering a balance between rationalism and Romanticism. A call to action is issued, addressing change in educational <b>practice,</b> <b>concerted</b> research effort to identify and articulate transformative processes within occupational therapy, and political action focusing on the inclusion of Romantic perspectives within policy and strategic documents...|$|R
