5|$|Although {{players had}} {{previously}} recorded segments of gameplay, these were usually deathmatches or speedruns, attempts {{to complete a}} map as quickly as possible. Diary of a <b>Camper</b> was the first demo to contain a narrative with text-based dialogue, instead of merely showing gameplay. Commentators have called the work primitive, but acknowledge its importance in establishing video games as a medium for filmmaking.|$|E
5|$|Diary of a <b>Camper</b> {{is a short}} American film {{made using}} id Software's 1996 first-person shooter video game Quake, {{released}} in 1996. It was created by United Ranger Films, then a subdivision of a popular group of video game players, or clan, known as the Rangers. The film was first released over the Internet as a non-interactive game demo file. The video is generally considered the first known example of machinima—the art of using real-time, virtual 3D environments, often game engines, to create animated films. The story centers on a lone <b>camper,</b> a player waiting in a strategic location instead of seeking active battle, who faces {{five members of the}} Rangers clan in a deathmatch, a type of multiplayer game in which the goal is to kill as many opponents as possible.|$|E

5|$|An {{isolated}} severe thunderstorm in {{the outer}} bands of Allison produced an F1 tornado in Worcester and Middlesex Counties in Massachusetts, impacting over 100trees and damaging one house and one small <b>camper.</b> A microburst in Leominster and another in Shirley damaged several trees. Lightning from the storm hit two houses, causing significant damage there but little elsewhere. Allison also produced moderate rainfall in the state, mainly ranging from 3 to 5inches (75 to 125mm). The rainfall caused drainage and traffic problems. Damage in Massachusetts totaled to $400,000 (2001USD, $520,000 2012USD).|$|E
5|$|Because of its significance, Diary of a <b>Camper</b> {{continues}} to be featured in machinima presentations. It {{was one of the}} first works to be included in the Machinima Archive, a collaboration among Stanford University, the Internet Archive, the AMAS, and machinima.com. In a 2005 event at Stanford University, the film was presented with later machinima works, such as Red vs. Blue. Likewise, the Australian Centre for the Moving Image included it in a 2006 machinima exhibit.|$|E

50|$|Designed with 8 and 9 {{year old}} <b>campers</b> in mind, mini camp {{is meant to}} be an {{introduction}} to the camp experience. At just three days and three nights long, mini <b>campers</b> are able to get a taste of many of the activities of traditional camp. The mini <b>campers</b> are able to stay in enclosed cabin units, Aonnetta (girls) and Chiwatenwha (boys). Some activities are modified to account for the difference in age of mini <b>campers</b> from traditional <b>campers.</b> Participants of the program stay in one of the units and are accompanied by extra staff members at all times to provide enhanced guidance and companionship for the younger <b>campers.</b> Mini camp explorers is for more adventurous 8 and 9-year-olds who feel capable of spending the entire week at camp. Because of the extended nature of their stay, <b>campers</b> are able to participate in all the activities of traditional camp in a modified form for their age and abilities. <b>Campers</b> spend their nights in either Chiwatenwha or Aonnetta with staff trained to take on the challenges of younger <b>campers</b> experiencing their first week-long sleepaway camp stay.|$|R

5|$|On October 26, 1996, a {{well-known}} gaming clan, the Rangers, surprised the Quake community with Diary of a <b>Camper,</b> the first widely known machinima film. This short, 100-second demo file contained {{the action and}} gore of many others, but {{in the context of}} a brief story, rather than the usual deathmatch. An example of transformative or emergent gameplay, this shift from competition to theater required both expertise in and subversion of the game's mechanics. The Ranger demo emphasized this transformation by retaining specific gameplay references in its story.|$|E

5|$|The first {{studies of}} the Javan {{rhinoceros}} by naturalists from outside of its region took place in 1787, when two animals were shot in Java. The skulls {{were sent to the}} renowned Dutch naturalist Petrus <b>Camper,</b> who died in 1789 before he was able to publish his discovery that the rhinos of Java were a distinct species. Another Javan rhinoceros was shot on the island of Sumatra by Alfred Duvaucel, who sent the specimen to his stepfather Georges Cuvier, the famous French scientist. Cuvier recognized the animal as a distinct species in 1822, and in the same year it was identified by Anselme Gaëtan Desmarest as Rhinoceros sondaicus. It was the last species of rhinoceros to be identified. Desmarest initially identified the rhino as being from Sumatra, but later amended this to say his specimen was from Java.|$|E
5|$|If the Bruins were swept, {{it would}} have {{marked the first time}} an overall top-seed was swept from the opening round of the playoffs since the Cleveland Barons ousted the Buffalo Bisons in 1954.
