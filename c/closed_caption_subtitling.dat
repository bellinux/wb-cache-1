50|$|Lake Windfall is a 2013 American post-apocalyptic movie {{written by}} Tony Nitko and Roger Vass Jr, and {{directed}} by Roger Vass Jr. The film was produced by Rustic Lantern Films, as subsidiary of Deaf Empowerment Awareness Foundation. The film focuses on the interaction between five friends who set off for a weekend of camping. It explores issues around Deaf, hard-of-hearing, and hearing people. The primary language is American Sign Language with <b>closed</b> <b>captioned</b> <b>subtitles</b> throughout, though {{early stages of the}} movie contain dialog in voice, with subtitles.|$|R

40|$|A {{system for}} on-line {{generation}} of <b>closed</b> <b>captions</b> (<b>subtitles)</b> for broadcast of live TV-programs is described. During broadcast, a commentator formulates a possibly condensed, but semantically correct {{version of the}} original speech. These compressed phrases are recognized by a continuous speech recognizer, and the resulting captions are fed into the teletext system. This application will provide the hearing impaired with an option to read captions for live broadcast programs, i. e., when off-line captioning is not feasible. The main advantage in using a speech recognizer rather than a stenography-based system (e. g., Velotype) is the relaxed requirements for commentator training. Also, the amount of text generated by a system based on stenography tends to be large, thus making it harder to read. 1...|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} {{efficient}} multi-level chart parser {{that was designed}} for syntactic analysis of <b>closed</b> <b>captions</b> (<b>subtitles)</b> in a real-time Machine Translation (MT) system. In order to achieve high parsing speed, we divided an existing English grammar into multiple levels. The parser proceeds in stages. At each stage, rules corresponding to only one level are used. A constituent pming step is added between levels to insure that constituents {{not likely to be}} part of the final parse are removed. This results in a significant parse time and ambiguity reduction. Since the domain is unrestricted, out-of-coverage sentences are to be expected and the parser might not produce a single analysis spanning the whole input. Despite the incomplete parsing strategy and the radical pruning, the initial evaluation results show that the loss of parsing accuracy is acceptable. The parsing time favorable compares with a Tomita parser and a chart parser parsing time when run on the same grammar and lexicon...|$|R

Overlay Mixer also supports Video Port Extensions (VPE), enabling it to work with analog TV tuners with overlay capability (sending video directly to a video card via an analog link rather than via the PCI bus). Overlay Mixer also supports DXVA connections. Because it always renders in overlay, full-screen video to TV-out is always activated.|$|R

Although he is credited with both the screen story and screenplay of Mars Attacks!, Gems dedicates his novelization of the movie to Burton, who [...] "co-wrote the screenplay and didn't ask for a credit". Warner Bros. was dubious of the Martian dialogue and wanted Burton to add <b>closed</b> <b>captioning</b> <b>subtitles,</b> but he resisted. Working with Burton, Gems pared the film's 60 leading characters down to 23, and the worldwide destruction planned for the film was isolated to three major cities.

50|$|VHS {{releases}} {{included the}} initial Streamline Video offering (May 1991), later wider distribution by MGM/UA Home Video, and a subtitled edition from Orion Home Video (September 1993). In the UK, Akira {{was released on}} video by Island World Communications in 1991. The success of this release {{led to the creation}} of Manga Entertainment, who later took over the release. The original VHS release of Akira started up Manga Entertainment Australia and VHS distribution was handled by Ronin Films and PolyGram until 1994 when Siren Entertainment took over all of Manga Entertainment Australia's distribution including Akira under a special license from PolyGram, who handled Island's video distribution. Akira was re-released on video in 1994, and again on DVD in 2001 and distributed by Madman Entertainment and The AV Channel. Pioneer Entertainment issued a DVD and a VHS with a new English dub (the dub produced by Animaze) in 2001. This was one of the few releases from Geneon to feature THX-certified audio and video, making it the first anime certified with THX. In 2002, Manga released a two-disc DVD featuring the new Pioneer/Animaze English dub followed in 2004 by another two-disc set containing the original Japanese as well as both the Streamline and Pioneer/Animaze dubs. This version did not contain standard English <b>subtitles,</b> only <b>closed</b> <b>captioning</b> <b>subtitles.</b> In 2005, Manga Entertainment and Boulevard UMD released Akira on UMD for the Sony PSP in the United Kingdom using the original Streamline dub.|$|R

25|$|Although same-language <b>subtitles</b> and <b>captions</b> are {{produced}} primarily with the deaf and {{hard of hearing}} in mind, many hearing film and television viewers choose to use them. This is often done because the presence of <b>closed</b> <b>captioning</b> and <b>subtitles</b> ensures that not one word of dialogue will be missed. Bars and other noisy public places, where film dialogue would otherwise be drowned out, often make <b>closed</b> <b>captions</b> visible for patrons. Viewers may also find thick regional accents from other same-language countries hard to understand without subtitles. Films and television shows often have subtitles displayed in the same language if the speaker has a speech impairment. In addition, captions may reveal information {{that would otherwise be}} difficult to obtain from hearing. Some examples would be song lyrics, dialog spoken quietly or by those with accents unfamiliar to the intended audience, or supportive, minor dialog from background characters. It is argued that such additional information and detail enhances the overall experience and allows the viewer a better grasp of the material. Furthermore, people learning a foreign language may sometimes use same-language subtitles to better understand the dialog without having to resort to a translation.|$|R
2500|$|On December 28, 2004, DreamWorks (parent {{company of}} {{theatrical}} distributor Go Fish Pictures) released Innocence on DVD in the US.

In addition to reading dialogue, audiences saw cues like [...] "Footsteps..." [...] or [...] "Helicopter approaches..."

5000|$|<b>Closed</b> <b>captioning</b> (CC) and <b>subtitling</b> {{are both}} {{processes}} of displaying text on a television, video screen, or other visual display {{to provide additional}} or interpretive information. Both are typically used as a transcription of the audio portion of a program as it occurs (either [...] or in edited form), sometimes including descriptions of non-speech elements. Other uses have been to provide a textual alternative language translation of a presentation's primary audio language that is usually burned-in (or [...] "open") to the video and unselectable. HTML5 defines subtitles as a [...] "transcription or translation of the dialogue ... when sound is available but not understood" [...] by the viewer (for example, dialogue in a foreign language) and captions as a [...] "transcription or translation of the dialogue, sound effects, relevant musical cues, and other relevant audio information ... when sound is unavailable or not clearly audible" [...] (for example, when audio is muted or the viewer is deaf or hard of hearing).|$|R
40|$|Learning in a {{multimodal}} environment {{entails the}} presentation of information in a combination {{of more than one}} mode (i. e. written words, illustrations, and sound). Past research regarding the benefits of multimodal presentation of information includes both school age children and adult learners (e. g. Koolstra, van der Voort & d'Ydewalle, 1999; Neumen & Koskinen, 1992), as well as both native and non-native language learners (e. g. d'Ydewalle & Gielen, 1992; Kothari et al, 2002). This dissertation focuses how the combination of various modalities are used by learners of differing proficiencies in English to gain better comprehension (cf. Mayer, 1997, 2005; Graber, 1990; Slykhuis et al, 2005). The addition of the written mode (<b>closed</b> <b>captioning)</b> to the already multimodal environment that exists in film and video presentations is analyzed. A Multimodal Multimedia Communicative Event is used to situate the language learner. Research questions focus on the eye movements of the participants as they read moving text both with and without the audio and video modes of information. Small case studies also give a context to four participants by bringing their individual backgrounds and observations to bear on the use of multimodal texts as language learning tools in a second or foreign language learning environment. It was found that Non Native English Speakers (NNS) (L 1 Arabic) show longer eye movement patterns in reading dynamic text (<b>closed</b> <b>captioning),</b> echoing past research with static texts while Native Speakers of English (NS) tend to have quicker eye movements. In a multimodal environment the two groups also differed: NNS looked longer at the <b>closed</b> <b>captioning</b> and NS were able to navigate the text presentation quickly. While associative activation (Paivio, 2007) between the audio and print modalities was not found to alter the eye movement patterns of the NNS, participants did alternate between the modalities in search of supplementary information. Other research using additional <b>closed</b> <b>captioning</b> and <b>subtitling</b> have shown that viewing a video program with written text added turns the activity into a reading activity (Jensema, 2000; d'Ydewalle, 1987). The current study found this to be the case, but the results differed in regard to proficiency and strategy...|$|R

5000|$|VHS {{became the}} leading {{consumer}} tape format for home movies after the [...] "videotape format war", though its follow-ups S-VHS, W-VHS and D-VHS never {{caught up in}} popularity. In the late 1990s in the prerecorded video market, VHS began to be displaced by DVD. The DVD format has several advantages over VHS tape. A DVD is much better able to take repeated viewings than VHS tape, which can crack or break, which makes DVDs a better format from a rental store's perspective. As well, whereas a VHS tape can be erased if it is exposed to a rapidly changing magnetic field of sufficient strength, DVDs and other optical discs are not affected by magnetic fields. Even though DVDs {{do not have the}} problems of tapes, such as breakage of the tape or the cassette mechanism, DVDs can still be damaged by scratches. Another factor for movie rental stores is that DVDs are smaller and take less space to store. DVDs offer a number of advantages for the viewer: DVDs can support both standard 4x3 and widescreen 16x9 screen aspect ratios and DVDs can provide twice the video resolution of VHS. As well, a viewer who wants to skip ahead {{to the end of a}} movie can do so much faster with a DVD than with a VHS tape (which has to be rewound). DVDs can have interactive menus, multiple language tracks, audio commentaries, <b>Closed</b> <b>Captioning</b> and <b>subtitling</b> (with the option of turning the subtitles on or off, or selecting subtitles in several languages). Moreover, a DVD can be played on a computer.|$|R
