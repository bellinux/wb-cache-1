Haemophilus pleuropneumoniae, strain W, serotype 1, given in 1 X 10 (8) <b>colony-forming</b> <b>units,</b> produced a lethal acute pleuropneumonia in four pigs. Nonlethal localized pulmonary necrosis was induced in four groups of two pigs given 1 X 10 (7), 1 X 10 (6), 1 X 10 (5) and 1 X 10 (4) respectively of the same strain. Two groups of four pigs developed chronic lesions when inoculated with 1 X 10 (7) <b>colony-forming</b> <b>units</b> of H. pleuropneumoniae, strain Shope 4074, serotype 1 and 1 X 10 (7) <b>colony-forming</b> <b>units</b> of H. pleuropneumoniae, strain WF 83, serotype 7, respectively. Of 20 pigs given 1 X 10 (8) <b>colony-forming</b> <b>units</b> of strain 1536, serotype 2, two died of acute pleuropneumonia and 18 had lesions of pulmonary necrosis or abscessation and pleuritis.

50|$|In microbiology, a <b>colony-forming</b> <b>unit</b> (CFU, cfu, Cfu) is a unit used to {{estimate}} the number of viable bacteria or fungal cells in a sample. Viable {{is defined as the}} ability to multiply via binary fission under the controlled conditions. Counting with colony-forming units requires culturing the microbes and counts only viable cells, in contrast with microscopic examination which counts all cells, living or dead. The visual appearance of a colony in a cell culture requires significant growth, and when counting colonies it is uncertain if the colony arose from one cell or a group of cells. Expressing results as colony-forming units reflects this uncertainty.|$|E

50|$|STEMvision is a bench-top {{instrument}} and computer system {{designed specifically for}} automated imaging and counting of hematopoietic colonies in <b>colony-forming</b> <b>unit</b> (CFU) assays of human cord blood, bone marrow and mobilized peripheral blood cells. This system has been optimized for use with MethoCult media and meniscus-free SmartDish cultureware. Instead of manually identifying and counting colonies using a microscope, the user simply loads a SmartDish culture plate into STEMvision. The instrument then captures an image of each 35 mm well in approximately 30 seconds, and uses image analysis software to identify and classify colonies produced by the four major sub-types of hematopoietic progenitor cells: CFU-E, BFU-E, CFU-G/M/GM and CFU-GEMM.|$|E
5000|$|Early erythroid {{progenitors}} {{are found}} at a quite low frequency relative to later stages of erythroid differentiation, such as the pro-erythroblast and the basophilic erythroblast stages which can be detected by flowcytometry directly ex-vivo (Socolovsky et al. 2001 [...] ). Furthermore, unlike for the pro-erythroblast and later stages of erythroid development, no truly reliable and unique positive flow-cytometric markers exist, though {{it is possible to}} use negative exclusion markers to deplete a cell population of other precursors and differentiated cells by cell sorting, thus greatly enriching it for the CFU-e activity (Prospective isolation and global gene expression analysis of the erythrocyte <b>colony-forming</b> <b>unit,</b> Terszowski G. et al. Blood 2005). CFU-e cells express Epo receptor, c-Kit (Stem cell factor receptor), transferrin receptor (CD71+), and are Ter119(glycophorin-A associated antigen)-negative. For the above reasons, the CFU-e assay, as inefficient and variable as it can often be, is still in use today.|$|E
