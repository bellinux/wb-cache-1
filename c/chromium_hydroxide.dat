5000|$|The {{chromium}} ion {{found in}} chromium oxide greens and <b>chromium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> is the Cr3+ ion, which has relatively low toxicity and mobility in soils. However, through an oxidation with manganese (IV) oxide, the Cr3+ ion {{can be transformed}} to the Cr6+ ion:Cr(OH)2+ + 1.5 MnO2 ↔ HCrO4− + 1.5 Mn2+In order for the Chromium (III) hydroxide ion to properly oxidize, it must form a surface complex with manganese oxides. Additionally, organic chelating agents that promote dissociation of minerals can, by extension, promote oxidation of Cr(OH)2+ to Cr6+ ions. The Cr6+ ion is extremely toxic and motile, and causes negative effects to photosynthesis as well as general health in plants. HCrO4− proceeds to dissociate further in water under the reaction:HCrO4− ↔ CrO42− + H+Keq = 3.0 x 10−7 Although this Keq appears low, CrO42− is a highly oxidative carcinogen which can cause toxicity to plants from [...]5 ppm in water and 5 ppm in soil. This reaction is plasuible, as Manganese (IV) oxide is naturally occurring {{as well as being}} present in batteries, with around 500,000 tons being used for dry-cell batteries per year. Despite both dry-cell batteries and nail polish being considered potential household hazardous waste products by the EPA, if nail polish is improperly disposed, it is a rational assumption that some batteries would be improperly disposed as well. Further study needs to be done about whether nail polish disposal on its own can cause harmful environmental effects, but [...]5 ppm is equivalent to [...]029 grains/gallon, so even if this reaction is extremely rare, any reaction has the potential to cause toxicity to plants.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to verify {{procedure}} for preparation of acrylic acids esters with glycidol and epichlohydrin, which could become the base for the producing of special hydrophilic polymers with polar groups. Reaction {{was carried out in}} a non-solvent system using the <b>chromium</b> (III) acetate <b>hydroxide</b> (CAH) as a catalyst. The influence of reaction temperature, time, ratio of reactants and the catalyst content on reaction conversion was studied. The purity of products was monitored by thinlayer chromatography and IR spectroscopy. In case of acrylic acid ester and epichlohydrin, the highest conversion of 98, 6 % was reached in 1 hour at 90 ° C using 20 % molar excess of epoxide and 0, 4 % (w/w) catalyst charge. When ester was prepared from glycidol, the conversion of 98 % was reached at the same reaction conditions. The experimental results confirmed that preparation of esters by the epoxy ring opening using chromium complexes as catalysts is a suitable, simple and perspective method for the hydrophilic monomers preparation...|$|R
40|$|Background : One of the {{industrial}} type which use hazardous materials in its production process is leather tanning industry, by using chromium compound (Cr). Chromium is a heavy metal compound which recognized has a high poison energy. Result of analysis of sampel industrial liquid waste of leather tanning of PT Trimulyo Kencana Mas (TKM) Semarang showed that total chromium concervation was 49, 575 m/l. This total Chromium rate was still above the standard quality of which enabled maximal 2, 0 mg/l, according to Kep 51 /MENLH/ 110 / 1995. Alkali compound of Ca(OH) 2, NaOH and NaHC 03 is chemicals able {{to be used for}} the processing of industrial liquid waste of pregnant leather tanning of chromium, functioning to boost up condensation pH andprecipitated chromium so that obtained chrome in theform of <b>hydroxide</b> <b>chromium</b> (Cr(OH) 3). Methods : which used in this research is (quasi experimental), with experiment variable repeated or referred as one group pretest posttest design. Results : of this research showed that optimum pH for the compound of each alkali at condition of pH 8, with the efficiency dissociation of chromium was equal to 99, 28...|$|R

Sonia Recillas and Joan Colón thank Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona for the award of a post-doctoral and pre-doctoral fellowship respectively [...] In this study, suspended cerium oxide nanoparticles stabilized with hexamethylenetetramine were used for the removal of dissolved chromium VI in pure water. Several concentrations of adsorbent and adsorbate were tested, trying to cover a large range of possible real conditions. Results showed that the Freundlich isotherm represented well the adsorption equilibrium reached between nanoparticles and chromium, whereas adsorption kinetics could be modeled by a pseudo-second-order expression. The separation of chromium–cerium nanoparticles from the medium and the desorption of <b>chromium</b> using sodium <b>hydroxide</b> without cerium losses was obtained. Nanoparticles agglomeration and morphological changes during the adsorption–desorption process were observed by TEM. Another remarkable result obtained in this study is the low toxicity in the water treated by nanoparticles measured by the Microtox® commercial method. These results can be used to propose this treatment sequence for a clean and simple removal of drinking water or wastewater re-use when a high toxicity heavy metal such as chromium VI is the responsible for water pollution...|$|R
