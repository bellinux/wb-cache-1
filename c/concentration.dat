40|$|In {{phenylketonuria}} (PKU), cerebral neurotransmitter deficiencies {{have been}} suggested to contribute to brain dysfunction. Present treatment aims to reduce blood phenylalanine <b>concentrations</b> by a phenylalanine-restricted diet, while in some patients blood phenylalanine <b>concentrations</b> also respond to cofactor treatment with tetrahydrobiopterin (BH 4). Recently, a repurposing approach of BH 4 was suggested to increase cerebral neurotransmitter synthesis. To investigate whether BH 4 may improve cerebral dopamine <b>concentrations</b> in PKU patients beyond its effect through lowering blood phenylalanine <b>concentrations,</b> we investigated blood prolactin concentrations-as a parameter of brain dopamine availability. We retrospectively compared blood prolactin in relation to blood phenylalanine <b>concentrations</b> of nine (male) BH 4 -responsive PKU patients, when being treated without and with BH 4. Blood prolactin <b>concentrations</b> positively correlated to blood phenylalanine <b>concentrations</b> (p= 0. 002), being significantly lower with than without BH 4 treatment (p= 0. 047). In addition, even in this small number of male patients, blood prolactin <b>concentrations</b> tended to be lower at increasing BH 4 dose (p= 0. 054), while taking blood phenylalanine <b>concentrations</b> into account (p= 0. 002). In individual BH 4 -responsive patients, median blood prolactin <b>concentrations</b> were significantly lower while using BH 4 than before using BH 4 treatment (p= 0. 024), whereas median blood phenylalanine <b>concentrations</b> tended to be lower, but this did not reach statistical significance (p= 0. 107). Therefore, these data show that high blood phenylalanine in BH 4 -responsive PKU male patients seems {{to be associated with}} increased blood prolactin <b>concentrations,</b> suggesting reduced cerebral dopamine availability. Moreover, these data suggest that BH 4 treatment in itself could decrease blood prolactin <b>concentrations</b> in a dose-responsive way, independent of blood phenylalanine <b>concentrations.</b> We conclude that these preliminary data indicate that BH 4 treatment may improve cerebral dopamine <b>concentrations</b> in PKU patients beyond its effect through lowering blood phenylalanine <b>concentrations,</b> possibly in a dose-dependent manner, but further research would be warranted...|$|R
