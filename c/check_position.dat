50|$|The {{purpose of}} this exam is to palpate organs which cannot be seen with visual inspection. The index and middle finger are {{inserted}} into the vagina. This maneuver allows the doctor to check the orientation, length and width of the vagina. Next, the cervix and vaginal fornices are palpated, to <b>check</b> <b>position,</b> size, consistency, mobility and sensibility. The other hand {{is placed in the}} pubis pressing it to feel the uterus between both hands. The most important characteristics to examine are the size of the uterus, presence of nodes or agglomerations, consistency, size, tilt, and mobility. With this technique, the ovaries are also palpable.|$|E
5000|$|To {{perform an}} axel, the skater {{typically}} approaches the jump on a right back outside edge in a strongly held <b>check</b> <b>position</b> before stepping on a left forward outside edge. He or she vaults over the toe {{pick of the}} left skate and [...] "steps up" [...] into the jump with the right leg. The skater crosses the left {{foot in front of}} the right, which is known as a back spin position (similar to the loop jump), to bring the center of rotation around the right side of the body. This act is often described as a weight shift in the air. Uncrossing the legs during the landing checks the rotation and allows the skater to flow out of the jump with good speed.|$|E
5000|$|Next, {{the weight}} is shifted {{forward from the}} ball of the {{stationary}} foot to the ball of extended foot. This motion is called [...] "rolling through". Because this is the primary [...] "stepping" [...] motion, {{it is important that}} it be as fluid as possible. Even after [...] "rolling through", the stationary leg should still be as straight as possible. Only after the weight has been shifted {{from one foot to the}} next should the back leg be bent slightly to allow it to glide forward (while the foot remains as close to the ground as possible) into the next [...] "check" [...] position. From this <b>check</b> <b>position,</b> the leg smoothly transitions into the next [...] "extend" [...] position, and so on. At the halfway point of the motion, the moving foot should be passing the ankle of the stationary foot.|$|E

40|$|Surfacing, {{steaming}} {{and freezing}} {{are widely used}} pretreatment methods to improve the drying rate and to reduce drying defects of wood. In this study, Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) wood samples were treated with steaming or freezing, and the resulting drying behaviors such as drying rate, drying strain and drying defects were investigated and {{compared with those of}} control wood using an optical measurement system and a digital image correlation (DIC) method. In the case of steaming pretreatment, the observed drying rate was faster and drying strain was milder than control wood. However, there were almost no differences between control and pre–frozen wood regarding the drying behaviors. Tangential strain (e 2) of steam–treated wood was larger than that of control and freeze–treated wood. Moreover, the effect of pretreatment was not uniform over the entire wood specimen. The drying <b>check</b> <b>position</b> could be approximately predicted by the analyzing of the strain ratio (μ) and strain velocity (v) graphs during the final drying period...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to enhance the {{validity}} of existing evolutionary topology optimization procedures. As this hard-killing scheme related to the element sensitivity values may lead to incorrect predictions of inefficient elements to be removed and the value of the objective function becomes sharply deteriorated during the iterations, a <b>check</b> <b>position</b> (CP) control is proposed to prevent the erroneous topology design generated by the rejection criteria of evolutionary methods. For this purpose, we introduce a sort of orthotropic cellular microstructure (OCM) element with moderate pseudodensity that acts as a compromising element between solid element and void OCM element. In this way, all inefficient elements removed previously are automatically replaced with the moderate OCM elements depending upon the deterioration of the objective function. Erroneously removed elements are then identified in the updated finite element model through a direct sensitivity computing of the moderate OCM elements and will be finally recovered by the bi-directional element replacement. Besides, detailed structures with checkerboard patterns are eliminated by controlling the local structural bandwidth with the so-called threshold method. Typical optimization examples of structural compliance and natural frequency that were difficult to tackle are solved by the proposed design procedure. Satisfactory numerical results are obtained.

40|$|Abstract. Hamming Code is {{the oldest}} and the most {{commonly}} used single error correcting and double errors detecting code. For implication, it is constructed over the field GF(2). For each r ≥ 2, there is a [n, k, 3] Hamming Code where = 2 − 1 and. A message word of length k is encoded using a generating matrix G into a codeword of length n. This amounts to inserting r parity check digits into the message word. The positions of the parity check digits in the codeword are called the <b>check</b> <b>positions</b> of the code (with respect to G). A received word is then r n k = 2 r − r − 1 th th th decoded using a parity check matrix H. If the <b>check</b> <b>positions</b> of the code are in the 1, 2,, r i i i � th th th coordinates of the codeword, then the i 1, i 2, �, ir rows of H are called the check rows of the code. We proved in this paper that for any parity check matrix of a Hamming Code, there exists a generating matrix G of the code, such that the check rows of the code are linearly independent. We believe that this fact is contained implicitly in a paper of Hamming [7] but we cannot find any explicit proof in existing literature. Using the above fact, we construct a 2 EC-AUED code. 1...|$|R
30|$|As expected, the {{proposed}} algorithm outperforms both search algorithms. However, the TRs and speed-ups obtained {{are lower than}} the ones obtained when using the Main Profile. This behaviour occurs because there is more redundancy in a 3 D video sequence than in a 2 D video sequence and the reference encoder consumes less time. The execution time of {{the proposed}} algorithm is almost constant (it is content independent), while the reference search algorithms are content dependent. Full search is implemented using an early-out termination which is able to skip some search area positions based on the cost obtained for previously <b>checked</b> <b>positions,</b> and the UMHexagonS algorithm carries out less algorithm iterations.|$|R
