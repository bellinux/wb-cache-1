5|$|Astronomers have {{discovered}} nearly 500 planetary systems with multiple planets. Regularly these systems include a few planets with masses several {{times greater than}} Earth's (super-Earths), orbiting closer to their star than Mercury is to the Sun, and sometimes also Jupiter-mass gas giants <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> star.|$|E
5|$|Exocomets {{beyond the}} Solar System {{have also been}} {{detected}} and may be common in the Milky Way. The first exocomet system detected was around Beta Pictoris, a very young A-type main-sequence star, in 1987. A total of 10 such exocomet systems have been identified , using the absorption spectrum caused by the large clouds of gas emitted by comets when passing <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> star.|$|E

5|$|For the old Diefenbaker {{was in full}} cry. All {{the agony}} of the {{disintegration}} of his government was gone, {{and he seemed to}} be a giant revived by his contact with the people. This was Diefenbaker's finest election. He was virtually alone on the hustings. Even such loyalists as Gordon Churchill had to stick <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> own bailiwicks, where they were fighting for their political lives.|$|E

40|$|On {{the basis}} of model from paper Barrio and Szymanski (2009) I {{estimate}} if the teams are <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> profit or performance maximizing positions. I found teams in MLB are in short run on average <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> win maximizing position. Another interesting conclusion is there are almost no differences between clubs in open league system represented by Spanish and English football league and closed league system represented by Major League Baseball in profit maximizing choices. That means the closed league system which is usually used in North America does not help teams <b>to</b> maximize <b>their</b> profits. I examined club characteristics that might explain variations in teams maximizing choices and found that clubs, which are incorporated companies, are on average <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> profit maximizing choices...|$|R

5|$|Albatrosses {{combine these}} soaring {{techniques}} {{with the use}} of predictable weather systems: albatrosses in the Southern Hemisphere flying north from their colonies will take a clockwise route, and those flying south will fly counterclockwise. Albatrosses are so well adapted to this lifestyle that their heart rates while flying are <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> basal heart rate when resting. This efficiency is such that the most energetically demanding aspect of a foraging trip is not the distance covered, but the landings, take-offs and hunting they undertake having found a food source. A common assumption is that albatrosses must be able to sleep in flight, although no direct evidence has ever been obtained.|$|E
5|$|Crested and marbled newts {{live and}} breed in vegetation-rich ponds or similar aquatic {{habitats}} {{for two to}} six months and usually {{spend the rest of}} the year in shady, protection-rich land habitats <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> breeding sites. Males court females with a ritualised display, ending in the deposition of a spermatophore that is picked up by the female. After fertilisation, a female lays 200–400 eggs, folding them individually into leaves of water plants. Larvae develop over two to four months before metamorphosing into land-dwelling juveniles.|$|E
5|$|Flaming arrows {{required}} the shooter to get quite <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> desired target and most will have extinguished themselves {{before reaching the}} target. In response, another form of fire arrow was developed which consisted of curved metal bars connecting a tip and hollow end for the shaft. The resulting cage was filled with hot coals or other solid object which could be fired from a much stronger bow or ballista without fear of extinguishing and {{would be used to}} ignite straw or thatch roofs from a safer distance.|$|E

It is believed that the young Tzara completed his secondary education at a state-run high school, which is identified as the Saint Sava National College or as the Sfântul Gheorghe High School. In October 1912, when Tzara was aged sixteen, he joined his friends Vinea and Marcel Janco in editing Simbolul. Reputedly, Janco and Vinea provided the funds. Like Vinea, Tzara was also <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> young colleague Jacques G. Costin, who was later his self-declared promoter and admirer.|$|E
5|$|Historically, Salukis {{were used}} for hunting by nomadic tribes. Typical quarry {{included}} the gazelle, hare, fox and jackal. While hunting hares, Bedouin hunters would sometimes ride <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> quarry on a camel holding a Saluki, which would be thrown towards the prey while at speed to give the dog a running start. Gazelle hunters also used hawks to gouge out {{the eyes of the}} prey so that a Saluki could then bring down the blinded animal.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, other {{proteins}} {{have evolved}} to bind to particular DNA sequences. The most intensively studied of these are the various transcription factors, which are proteins that regulate transcription. Each transcription factor binds to one particular set of DNA sequences and activates or inhibits the transcription of genes that have these sequences <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> promoters. The transcription factors do this in two ways. Firstly, they can bind the RNA polymerase responsible for transcription, either directly or through other mediator proteins; this locates the polymerase at the promoter and allows it to begin transcription. Alternatively, transcription factors can bind enzymes that modify the histones at the promoter. This changes the accessibility of the DNA template to the polymerase.|$|E

5|$|In most {{of their}} range, egg laying begins in late February. In colder climates, it is later, e.g. April in Greenland and Tibet. In Pakistan, {{egg-laying}} takes place in December. Eggs and hatchlings are preyed on, rarely, by large hawks and eagles, large owls, martens and canids. The adults, which are very rarely predated, are often successful in defending their young from these predators, due to their numbers, large size and cunning. They have been observed dropping stones on potential predators that venture <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> nests.|$|E
5|$|Machinima {{productions}} {{can remain}} <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> gaming roots and feature stunts or other portrayals of gameplay. Popular genres include dance videos, comedy, and drama. Alternatively, some filmmakers attempt {{to stretch the}} boundaries of the rendering engines or to mask the original 3-D context. The Academy of Machinima Arts & Sciences (AMAS), a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting machinima, recognizes exemplary productions through Mackie awards given at its annual Machinima Film Festival. Some general film festivals accept machinima, and game companies, such as Epic Games, Blizzard Entertainment and Jagex, have sponsored contests involving it.|$|E
5|$|Mardikh II's periods {{shared the}} same culture. the {{population}} of Ebla during Mardikh IIB1 is estimated to have numbered around 40,000 in the capital, and over 200,000 people in the entire kingdom. The Eblaites of Mardikh II were Semites, <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> North-Western Semitic neighbors, such as the Amorites. Giovanni Pettinato said the Eblaite language, {{one of the oldest}} attested Semitic languages, was a West Semitic language; Gelb and others said it was an East Semitic dialect closer to the Akkadian language. Academic consensus considers Eblaite an East-Semitic language which exhibits both West-Semitic and East-Semitic features.|$|E

The Bears chose to punt rather than risk a play so <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> own end zone, but Tech's Vance Maree blocked Lom's punt for a safety, giving Georgia Tech a 2–0 lead.|$|E
5|$|The Field Spaniel {{can be a}} {{good family}} dog while it has a job to do. They are {{suitable}} for dog agility and hunting. Without some sort of purpose, the dog can often try to amuse itself and cause mischief. However, they are patient with children and like to stay <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> family. When socialised, they are good with other dogs. They are generally docile and independent, and are not as excitable as Cocker Spaniels. Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs lists the breed as being above average in working intelligence.|$|E
5|$|The Vietnamese {{attempted}} {{to reclaim the}} citadel by sending reinforcements.

These militia engaged in ambushing French patrols near the citadel, as well as evacuating local inhabitants, {{in order to create}} an open space <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> target. The local militia were supported by wealthy southern landowners, who supplied them with food and resources.|$|E
