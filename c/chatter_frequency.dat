40|$|In {{the present}} study, the {{influences}} of the bearing clearance, which is a common fault for machines, to the chatter stability of milling process are examined by using numerical simulation method. The results reveal {{that the presence of}} bearing clearance could make the milling process easier to enter the status of chatter instability and can shift the <b>chatter</b> <b>frequency.</b> In addition, the spectra analysis to vibration signals obtained under the instable milling processes show that the presence of bearing clearance could introduce more frequency components to the vibration responses but, however, under both the stable and instable milling processes, the generated frequency components will not violate the ideal spectra structures of the vibration responses of the milling process, which are usually characterized by the tooth passing frequency and its associated higher harmonics for the stable milling process and by the complex coupling of the tooth passing frequency and the <b>chatter</b> <b>frequency</b> for the instable milling process. This implies that, even under the case with bearing clearance fault, the stability of the milling process can still be determined by viewing the frequency spectra of the vibration responses. Moreover, the phenomena of the <b>chatter</b> <b>frequency</b> shift and the generation of more components provide potential ways to detect the bearing clearance in machines. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|AbstractActive {{fixtures}} represent one of {{the most}} industrially relevant alternatives among active chatter control techniques in milling, even though control logics and actuation strategies could directly reflect on their effectiveness. Closed-loop controls targeted in the <b>chatter</b> <b>frequency</b> range are commonly adopted for this purpose, but this approach lacks of applicability when <b>chatter</b> <b>frequency</b> exceeds the achievable actuation bandwidth. The purpose of this work is to investigate the effectiveness of potential low-frequency actuation strategies in suppressing chatter vibrations. A dedicated time-domain simulation model, developed and validated by authors, is used to test different actuation strategies in order to highlight the most relevant factors in assessing actuation effectiveness. The simulation results demonstrated that employing actuation frequencies close to the first half-harmonic of the tooth-pass frequency could disrupt the regenerative effect. This allows the mitigation and suppression of chatter phenomenon, increasing the critical axial depth of cut, as discussed in the paper...|$|E

40|$|Analytical {{force and}} dynamic models for {{material}} removal {{processes such as}} end and face milling do not account for material and process related uncertainties such as tool wear, tool breakage and material inhomogeneity. Optimization of material removal processes thus requires not only optimal process planning using analytical models but also on-line monitoring of the process so that adjustments, if needed, can be initiated to maximize the productivity or to avoid damaging expensive parts. In this thesis, a Polyvinylidene Fluoride (PVDF) sensor based process monitoring method that is independent of the cutting conditions and workpiece material is developed for measuring the cutting forces and/or torque in milling. The research includes the development of methods and hardware for wireless acquisition of time-varying strain signals from PVDF sensor-instrumented milling tools rotating at high speeds and transformation of the strains into the measurand of interest using quantitative physics-based models of the measurement system. Very good agreement between the measurements from the low cost PVDF sensors and the current industry standard, piezoelectric dynamometer, has been achieved. Three PVDF sensor rosettes are proposed for measuring various strain components of interest and are shown to outperform their metal foil strain gauge counterparts with significantly higher sensitivity and signal to noise ratio. In addition, a computationally efficient algorithm for milling chatter recognition that can adapt to different cutting conditions and workpiece geometry variations {{based on the measured}} cutting forces/torque signals is proposed and evaluated. A novel complex exponential model based <b>chatter</b> <b>frequency</b> estimation algorithm is also developed and validated. The chatter detection algorithm can detect chatter before chatter marks appear on the workpiece and the <b>chatter</b> <b>frequency</b> estimation algorithm is shown to capture the <b>chatter</b> <b>frequency</b> with the same accuracy as the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The computational cost of the chatter detection algorithm increases linearly with data size and the <b>chatter</b> <b>frequency</b> estimation algorithm, with properly chosen parameters, is shown to perform 10 times faster than the FFT. Both the cutting forces/torque measurement methodology and the chatter detection algorithm have great potential for shop floor application.

40|$|Miniature {{components}} {{with complex}} shape {{can be created}} by micromilling with excellent form and finish. However, for difficult-to-machine materials, such as Ti-alloys, failure of low-flexural stiffness microtools is a big limitation. High spindle speeds (20, 000 - 100, 000 rpm) {{can be used to}} reduce the undeformed chip thickness and the cutting forces to reduce the catastrophic failure of the tool. This reduced uncut chip thicknesses, in some cases lower than the cutting edge radius, can result in intermittent chip formation which can lead to dynamic variation in cutting forces. In addition, the run-out and the misalignment effects are amplified at higher rotational speeds which can induce dynamic force variation. These dynamic force variations coupled with low-flexural rigidity of micro end mill can render the process unstable. Consequently, accurate prediction of forces and stability is essential in high-speed micromilling. Most of the previous studies reported in the literature use constant cutting coefficients in the mechanistic cutting force model which does not yield accurate results. Recent work has shown significant improvement in the prediction of cutting forces with velocity-chip load dependent coefficients but a single-function velocity-chip model fails to predict the forces accurately at very high speeds (> 80, 000 rpm). This inaccurate force prediction affects the predicted stability boundary at those speeds. Hence, this paper presents a segmented approach, wherein a function is fit for a given range of speeds to determine the chip load dependent cutting coefficients. The segmented velocity-chip load dependent cutting coefficient improves the cutting force prediction at high speeds, which yields much accurate stability boundary. This paper employs two degrees-of-freedom (2 DOF) model with forcing functions based on segmented velocity-chip load dependent cutting coefficients. Stability lobe diagram based on 2 DOF model has been created for different speed ranges using Nyquist stability criterion.

40|$|AbstractChatter {{detection}} {{is necessary}} to carry out stable machining. It is extremely critical in high speed micromilling (spindle speeds > 100, 000 rpm) where the limited tool stiffness and small fluctuations in the cutting forces can lead to dynamic instability. Chatter can deteriorate the surface finish and is detrimental to the tool as well. Hence, chatter identification is important to obtain stable cutting parameters. This chatter free process parameters can be identified by carrying out experiments at different machining conditions. Chatter detection can be accomplished via in-process real time techniques based on force and displacement signals or off-line machined surface characterization. It may be noted that micromilling process uses a miniature end mill whose natural frequencies corresponding to higher modes can {{be as high as}} 10 KHz. Consequently, the sensor bandwidth should be sufficient to detect high <b>chatter</b> <b>frequencies</b> in high speed micromilling. The conventional way of detecting chatter via force sensor may not be applicable in high speed micromilling due to its limited bandwidth. The displacement sensors can also have issues with proper placement and the noise. The chatter surface identification is relatively easy via visual inspection of the surface topography but quantitatively specifying a surface parameter which captures chatter is challenging. To address the issues of chatter identification in high speed micromilling, three different experimental techniques have been studied for chatter characterization. Four different experimental conditions (two stable and two unstable processing conditions based on visual surface inspection of scanning electron micrographs) have been characterized by all three methods and a comparative assessment of different chatter detection techniques has been carried out in high speed micromilling of Ti 6 Al 4 V. It has been observed that force sensor is unable to identify the chatter and the displacement sensor is noisy but can be used to determine chatter under certain conditions. However, average power spectral density (APSD) obtained from the surface topography can clearly identify chatter.

40|$|In {{the early}} days of the {{manufacturing}} industry, the limiting factor in obtaining higher material removal rates was 'Chatter', an unstable cutting condition with excessive vibrations. Maximum productivity can only be obtained using the knowledge of the theory of regenerative chatter. In the era of modem manufacturing industry, where the greater quality and productivity are increasingly demanded, especially the requirement to understand and avoid chatter is even greater. The key answering to this challenge is to increase the rate of material removal while maintaining stable cutting conditions through reducing chatter during machining operations. In this regard, an active vibration absorber can be used to effectively reduce the undesired vibrations of the structure, thereby increasing the border line of chatter stability. However, to date there has been little attention in applying this technique in the application ofmilling chatter suppression, especially for a flexible workpiece. In this thesis, the stability of milling process dynamics is theoretically investigated using the method of semi-discretization. An alternative means of improving stability in milling is also presented by developing the extended method of semi-discretization for the milling systems with variable time delay. This can be used to predict not only the stability but also the <b>chatter</b> <b>frequencies</b> for milling with irregular pitch cutters. Motivated by an interest in practically improving the stability margin in the milling process, a practical and straightforward active vibration control system with acceleration feedback is implemented using a proof-mass actuator. Based on the general framework of virtual passive control, three controller strategies are first demonstrated and evaluated through a laboratory based vibration study, consisting of virtual sky-hook damper, virtual passive absorber and virtual passive-active absorber. TheÃ‚Â· results indicate that virtual passive absorber control could be a simple and robust solution to the application ofmachining chatter reduction. Through the initial study of the theory of regenerative chatter, analytical optimizations of dynamic vibration absorbers are developed for application to chatter suppression. The performance of a virtual passive absorber to suppress workpiece chatter during high speed machining is then experimentally investigated for each tuning scheme, including the virtual sky-hook damper scheme. The results demonstrate that although the performance of the active milling chatter suppression system is limited by the actuator saturation, the chosen control strategy can provide at least a 6 -fold improvement in the workpiece stability using a small actuator.
