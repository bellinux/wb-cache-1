40|$|Tourism is the {{brilliant}} and efficient {{combination of the}} natural elements existing in a geographical space, of the general components of human existence (language, culture, traditions, folklore, hospitality), of the human factor and of the infrastructure. If one of these elements is inefficient, then their combination will be an unfortunate one. What Romanian tourism needs is the infrastructure and efficiency in the exploitation of its rich natural elements. If to all these we add an unhealthy mentality of tourism performers, then we may say we sketched {{the image of the}} Romanian tourism. A special natural foundation is an absolutely wonderful thing, but without the rest of the components, without attractive <b>tourist</b> <b>programmes</b> to highlight those natural beauties, and without material basis at European standards, tourism will remain one of the national economy fields insufficiently exploited.
