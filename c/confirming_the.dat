5|$|The Confirmatio Cartarum (Confirmation of Charters) {{was issued}} in Norman French by Edward I in 1297. Edward, needing money, had taxed the nobility, {{and they had}} armed {{themselves}} against him, forcing Edward to issue his confirmation of Magna Carta and the Forest Charter to avoid civil war. The nobles had sought to add another document, the De Tallagio, to Magna Carta. Edward I's government {{was not prepared to}} concede this, they agreed to the issuing of the Confirmatio, <b>confirming</b> <b>the</b> previous charters and <b>confirming</b> <b>the</b> principle that taxation should be by consent, although the precise manner of that consent was not laid down.|$|E

5|$|Unlike many archaeological finds, {{the human}} {{remains at the}} site were able to be dated with environmental, geological, and archaeological methods. Human remains at the site are the oldest {{that have been found}} in Washington, and at the time were the oldest set of remains found in North America. Later {{radiocarbon}} work has confirmed the original dating of this site, indicating that these human remains, albeit very fragmentary, are still some of the oldest ever excavated in the New World. This finding was useful in <b>confirming</b> <b>the</b> early chronology of the region and <b>confirming</b> <b>the</b> antiquity of the styles of associated bone tools.|$|E
5|$|Article III has one section, <b>confirming</b> <b>the</b> {{principle}} {{of separation of}} powers between the legislative, executive and judicial branches of government.

Separation between the branches of government is also listed as a {{right of the people}} in §5 of Article I.|$|E
5|$|Experiments <b>confirming</b> <b>the</b> role of kin {{selection}} in worker policing demonstrate {{the effects of}} multiple matings, {{which can lead to}} lower average relatedness between workers. Queens of the social wasp Dolichovespula saxonica mate singly or multiply. Researchers who study these wasps have observed a strong positive correlation between worker relatedness and male production. After controlling for the absolute number of eggs laid, these scientists conclude that the queen's multiple matings favor mutual worker policing.|$|E

5|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{overcome}} this compartmentalization, Andrews bypassed {{the chain of command}} on 8 January 1938, in a memorandum of his own regarding a minor joint air exercise held in November 1937 off the Virginia Capes.

5|$|Wittgenstein {{believed}} {{that religion is}} significant because it offers a particular way of life, rather than <b>confirming</b> <b>the</b> existence of God.

Wittgenstein believed that religious language is different from language used to describe physical objects because it occupies a different language game.|$|E

5|$|Ancient Hawaiians {{were the}} first to {{recognize}} the increasing age and weathered state of the volcanoes to the north as they progressed on fishing expeditions along the islands. The volatile state of the Hawaiian volcanoes and their constant battle with the sea was a major element in Hawaiian mythology, embodied in Pele, the deity of volcanoes. After the arrival of Europeans on the island, in 1880–1881 James Dwight Dana directed the first formal geological study of the hotspot's volcanics, <b>confirming</b> <b>the</b> relationship long observed by the natives. 1912 marked the founding of the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory by volcanologist Thomas Jaggar, initiating continuous scientific observation of the islands. In the 1970s, a mapping project was initiated to gain more information about the complex geology of Hawaii's seafloor.|$|E

5|$|Being {{the last}} male {{member of the}} House of Árpád, Andrew was elected king {{after the death of}} King Ladislaus IV in 1290.

At least three pretenders—Albert of Austria, Mary of Hungary, and an adventurer—challenged his claim to the throne. Andrew expelled the adventurer from Hungary and forced Albert of Austria to conclude a peace within a year, but Mary of Hungary and her descendants did not renounce their claim. The Hungarian bishops and Andrew's maternal family from Venice were his principal supporters, but the leading Croatian and Slavonian lords were opposed to his rule.|$|E
